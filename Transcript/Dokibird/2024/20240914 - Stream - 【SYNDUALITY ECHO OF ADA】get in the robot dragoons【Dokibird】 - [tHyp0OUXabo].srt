00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
Hello!

2
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,200
Hello, everybody!

3
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,000
Hello, hello!

4
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,240
Welcome!

5
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Today is a special stream today!

6
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:39,020
If you guys didn't know, I'm sponsored by Senuality slash Bandai to check out their Closed Network Test.

7
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,620
So, some of you guys, dragoons, might have already played this already because it came out.

8
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,140
The Closed Network Test was out yesterday.

9
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,440
So, for those who registered for the Closed Network Test, you might have been lucky to try it out yesterday.

10
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,460
I chose today because I didn't realize it came out yesterday.

11
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,840
So, I was like, the 14th.

12
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,080
That's really it.

13
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,240
I was like, I chose 14th.

14
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,940
I was literally like, which day do I do it?

15
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,140
I was like, the 14th because I bet that's the first day it's out.

16
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,640
And then they're like, well, and then I found out.

17
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,300
I was like, oh, wait, it comes out on the 18th.

18
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,420
I was like, what?

19
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,300
Well, it's too late.

20
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,460
I already tweeted it out.

21
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,640
All right, you know what?

22
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,740
I tweeted out the whole, like, hey, guys, I'm going to check out Senuality on September 14th.

23
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,880
All right, and then after I tweeted that out, I was like, wait, that's day two.

24
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,080
I was like, wait, the 13th is when it comes out.

25
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,480
Well, I already tweeted it.

26
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,860
I can't just be like, JK, let me reschedule that.

27
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
Anyhow, I'm a professional right here.

28
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,360
I am a fucking professional.

29
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,380
So, yes, I am going in blind.

30
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,800
I have not played the game yet.

31
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,220
The only thing I know is that it's related to mechas.

32
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,200
So, I am going in blind.

33
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,620
I know there's some pew-pewing going on, too.

34
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,280
So, like, it's mechas and there's pew-pew.

35
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,140
So, I'm going in with a blind reaction to it and let you guys see what the game is all about.

36
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,160
And also, because...

37
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,300
It's very fitting that we have this, too.

38
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,600
Get in the robot dragons!

39
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
Get in the robot dragons!

40
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,840
I felt like it's very fitting that we have this today for this stream especially.

41
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:50,400
So, I just felt like, you know, it's good timing, you know?

42
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,120
Good timing.

43
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,780
Congratulations.

44
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,700
S였습니다.

45
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,780
Um... what other stuff do I wanna... Okay, also... life update.

46
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,560
I cheat went out today!

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,100
I win out!

48
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,840
Uh, usually.

49
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,860
I know this is a sponsored stream, but I wanna give you guys a life update, too.

50
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,100
I might be paid to do the stream, but it doesn't mean I won't give you guys an update on my life.

51
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,700
It doesn't exempt from giving life updates.

52
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,740
Um, I'm actually touch grass!

53
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
You know, like, ever since moving out...

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Ever since moving out.

55
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm going out to a new place.

56
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,900
I've been super... in the past, I would not go out when I have days where I'm streaming.

57
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,920
So... but like lately, the past couple of weeks, I've been going out and like actually going out doing stuff.

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,320
Outside of just like stream... like on stream days as well.

59
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,760
So today I went to a farmer's market.

60
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,760
It was nice.

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,520
I got some... I got some stuff at farmer's market.

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,360
I actually went to a farmer's market today.

63
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,700
And I bought a lot of bread.

64
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,580
Guys, okay.

65
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,560
I know I could Google this.

66
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,420
But like why Google when I... you guys can tell me.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,420
But how long before bread expires?

68
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,100
Like...

69
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,140
How long?

70
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,220
I bought a lot of bread.

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,540
I bought a lot of baked... bakery stuff.

72
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,280
So like... how long before they expire?

73
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,290
Wait, do I freeze it?

74
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,390
I bought a lot.

75
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:21,970
I... I...

76
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,030
I bought way too much.

77
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,910
I bought like two bags of like bakery things.

78
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,290
Because I was like, ooh, fresh bread.

79
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:41,610
But like... but like can I just eat bakery things for like the next two or three days?

80
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,530
Like for lunch and dinner?

81
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,690
And then like I'll just survive off that?

82
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,330
Or should I freeze it now?

83
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,990
Or do I put it in the fridge?

84
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,090
Freeze it and it can last for...

85
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,350
Forever?

86
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:52,910
Okay.

87
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,270
You can... yeah.

88
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,530
You can freeze bread?

89
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:55,930
Yeah.

90
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,370
You can... apparently... apparently you can freeze bread.

91
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,310
Two weeks in the fridge.

92
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,890
Oh!

93
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,710
So I can live off of...

94
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,090
You know what?

95
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,690
I'm gonna do it.

96
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,530
I'm gonna live off of...

97
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm gonna live off of baked goods for the next two weeks.

98
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,090
I'm gonna...

99
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,670
I could...

100
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:13,810
Whoa!

101
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,010
This looks so good.

102
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,050
I was like... oh my god.

103
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,890
The closest bakery near me is so far.

104
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,370
Well, to be fair, the closest bakery next... near me is not that far.

105
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,590
But then, like, when you're at a farmer's market, you buy a lot of stuff, you know, from...

106
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,690
I don't know if they're actually farmers, but like...

107
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,050
You buy a lot of food.

108
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,330
And I was like...

109
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,550
Whoa!

110
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,750
Fresh bread?

111
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,310
I mean, it's not gonna be fresh after I fucking put it in the fridge.

112
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,090
But like...

113
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,370
Whoa!

114
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,330
Fresh baked goods?

115
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,530
So then I bought...

116
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,270
A lot.

117
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,910
Cause I...

118
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,830
I was like...

119
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,070
Wow!

120
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,210
I am...

121
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,390
Making good business decisions.

122
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,650
So, look, I'm...

123
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,410
It's not like...

124
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,470
Guys, I didn't buy that much.

125
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,250
Two bags does not equal three months of food, guys.

126
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,270
It doesn't...

127
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,890
It doesn't equal three months of food.

128
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,830
I think it'll last me, like, maybe a week.

129
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,730
If I eat it for lunch and dinner for the next week...

130
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,110
For the next week, I think we'll be fine.

131
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,690
We'll be fine.

132
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,850
Alright.

133
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,870
So...

134
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,130
We will...

135
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,770
We will...

136
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,530
I'll basically have a bread diet for the next two weeks.

137
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,210
I don't know if that's healthy.

138
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,410
There's no meat...

139
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:31,850
I don't...

140
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,450
I have chicken.

141
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,650
I have chicken.

142
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,750
So, like...

143
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,370
If anything, I will...

144
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,070
I will...

145
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,790
Add protein if I need to.

146
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,210
Cause I'm thinking, like, that's not that healthy if I just eat bread the entire time.

147
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,630
But it's really good bread!

148
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,150
It's, like, all natural bread!

149
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,190
It was made by an old lady!

150
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,250
So, I assume...

151
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,130
It was made by, like, an old Asian granny.

152
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,490
So, like, I assume it's really good bread.

153
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,050
Well, it was made by, like, several grannies.

154
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,210
So, like, I assume it's really, really good bread.

155
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,250
Uh...

156
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,870
But, yes.

157
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,750
I bought two bags worth of bread.

158
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,270
There was so many!

159
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,610
There was so many stalls at the farmer market that were just selling bread!

160
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,170
I can't help it!

161
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,950
There...

162
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,830
It was, like...

163
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,130
There were several...

164
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,970
It was a farmer's market!

165
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:35,950
Guys!

166
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,910
It was so...

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,490
Every other stall was, like, bakery...

168
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,110
Good...

169
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,210
Bakery stuff.

170
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,670
So, I was, like, wow!

171
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,270
It wasn't just bread.

172
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,730
I also bought...

173
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,530
I bought cookies, too.

174
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,230
But, like, I was, like, wow!

175
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,050
It's not bread bread!

176
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,630
It was, like, baked...

177
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,130
You know, it has some form of bread in it.

178
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,970
I, like...

179
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,310
And I also bought honey, too.

180
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:05,870
So...

181
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,130
It...

182
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,930
It...

183
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,130
It...

184
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,290
It smelled really good.

185
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:09,690
Okay.

186
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,730
It smelled really nice.

187
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,930
So, I couldn't help myself.

188
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,270
Like, won't it go...

189
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,130
That's why I was, like...

190
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,710
It was a...

191
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,330
It was a bad idea that I bought two bags, but I...

192
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,090
There was...

193
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
It was so many.

194
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,570
Like...

195
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,610
It looked really good.

196
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,350
Some of them were shaped like cute animals.

197
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,270
Like, can you really blame me?

198
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,450
There was one that was shaped like a cute animal.

199
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,190
It was shaped like a bear.

200
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,450
I was, like, oh my god!

201
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,650
I need that!

202
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,530
I...

203
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,730
I need...

204
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,450
I need...

205
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:41,750
I need...

206
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:42,450
I need...

207
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,730
I need...

208
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,690
I need...

209
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,230
I need...

210
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:46,930
Anyway.

211
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,250
So, today I went to the farmer's market.

212
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,450
Another life of...

213
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:50,610
Yeah.

214
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,730
I've been going outside a lot more lately in the last couple of weeks, which I...

215
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:03,350
Which has been really nice in general because, like, you know, I feel like I have a lot more energy to actually go outside now.

216
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,130
And it was nice to go to the farmer's market and just, you know, look around.

217
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,070
Look at the food.

218
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,370
And just look at the...

219
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,610
Just buy two bags of bread.

220
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:14,490
And...

221
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,190
And...

222
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,430
Especially on a stream day, too.

223
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,590
It did not feel like a stream day for me today.

224
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,470
So, like, it was really nice to just go outside during stream day.

225
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,530
Like, not be worried.

226
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,870
Being like, oh, I have to be at home.

227
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,910
I have to be at home and, like, prepare for the stream.

228
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,310
And, like, just focus on work, work, work.

229
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:42,370
So, it's nice to, like, have half the day just going outside and relaxing a little bit before coming back to stream the day.

230
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,390
So, it was a nice change of pace, you know.

231
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,170
But, yeah.

232
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,190
Another life update.

233
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,890
Doki Amber Doge, a.k.a.

234
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:55,650
Dad, has found out that the bathroom floor has heated tiles.

235
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,950
This is not good for me.

236
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,710
Why do you ask?

237
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,230
It's not good for me.

238
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,730
Because he found out today.

239
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,390
Because I...

240
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,930
And, you know, it's getting closer.

241
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,050
It's getting...

242
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,830
It's fall now.

243
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,150
So...

244
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,770
And the summer's over.

245
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,570
So, it's fall now.

246
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,110
And...

247
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,930
So, the bathroom floor has heated tiles...

248
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,690
So...

249
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,370
And he...

250
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,530
He basically...

251
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,810
I would use the bathroom.

252
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,470
I use the bathroom today.

253
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,170
And then he went inside, and I was, like, leave.

254
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,290
I was, like, Doki, now leave.

255
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,210
And then he looked at me and sat down.

256
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,150
I am a Doki.

257
00:12:45,150 --> 00:13:12,010
And then I tried pushing his butt to the door, cause like, the thing is, the wish part is my bathroom door, my bathroom door cannot fully close, it always has like, if he pushes the door, it opens, so like, he can open doors if you don't fully close, if you don't fully close the door,

258
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,130
he knows how to open doors.

259
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:39,170
All he does is just push the door, and so, and so, so, so, anyway, anyway, so he found out the towels are heated, so I was like, leave, and then he just looks at me, and just sits down, and I push him out, with my, I was like, leave, and I push him out,

260
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,670
and he just sits there, and looks at me.

261
00:13:47,070 --> 00:14:03,390
And then, and then, like, and then I'll be, and I opened the door, and was like, please, dad, please, go, and then he just, he walks to the door, and then looks at me, and then lies down, and I'm like, are you fucking serious?

262
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,950
Am I getting serious?

263
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,590
I'm just like, oh my god, anyway, so yes.

264
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:28,530
Now he knows the towels are heated, and now that it's starting to get colder, it's starting to get colder here in Canada, I am very afraid of life, I'm very afraid now.

265
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:40,630
All right, anyway, Senuality, Echo of Ada, life update over, time for the sponsored portion.

266
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,870
I want to say again, huge thank you to Bandai.

267
00:14:45,150 --> 00:15:02,790
For, uh, for the sponsor, I really appreciate, um, I really appreciate, um, them sponsoring me to check out this game, um, we're looking forward to it, I really am, um, like I said, I heard there's, like, mechas, and there's pew-pew, so it's perfect for me.

268
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,650
Uh, did you guys know here about Transformers 1?

269
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,510
I heard, like, I heard it was really, I heard it was really good, um, um, from the reviews.

270
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,230
All right, enter player name.

271
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,990
Not Doki Bird.

272
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,590
All right, you can use up to six, is this six?

273
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,690
One, two, guys, I don't think this is six.

274
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,170
One, two, three, four, five, six.

275
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,110
Okay.

276
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,730
Wait, oh, I can!

277
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,670
Oh, digits is numbers!

278
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,290
Sorry, I'm illiterate.

279
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,230
That's, sorry, I'm, I'm illiterate.

280
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,390
Yeah, okay.

281
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,170
You'll never expect it's me, because it says not Doki Bird.

282
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,490
All right, let me know the volumes, okay?

283
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:50,930
Oh, no.

284
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,050
The Drifters?

285
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,630
Wait, is that co- voice coming out of that thing?

286
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,750
Tears of the New Moon?

287
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,290
Who is this handsome little critter?

288
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:27,350
Who is this little child doing a donut here?

289
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,770
Oh, this is the place I was going to think about, when I was a kid with Boss Lamp.

290
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,050
If they smile, they're crazy kids.

291
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,610
When can fashionable kids playое?

292
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,590
I love to play.

293
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:45,130
How's that thing called again?

294
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,530
Stop!

295
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,970
Leave him alone!

296
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,790
He's just trying to be a cool guy!

297
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,590
That's us!

298
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,510
We're the Drifters!

299
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:10,990
We're heroes!

300
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,190
Of course we cannot forget the Human Duality Cognitive Androids, Magus.

301
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,490
Oh, the sound guy, is it better now?

302
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,570
We have become a necessary part of our world.

303
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,650
And soon we'll be fully integrated into our daily lives.

304
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,710
Oh, so they're cyborgs!

305
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,310
We just talk on the back of our bipedal mecha, helping to power them.

306
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,410
This is called...

307
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,790
The Cradle Coffins!

308
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,030
Precisely, Yoshio.

309
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,650
Thanks for the Cradle Coffins.

310
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:28,850
That's us!

311
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,610
The heroic Drifters were able to face even harsher conditions than ever before.

312
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,790
That's nice!

313
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,590
Every mecha has a waifu.

314
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,970
To work with their Magus and master the Cradle Coffins.

315
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,790
To battle humanity's greatest enemy, the Enders.

316
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,490
And gather the precious AO Crystals.

317
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,750
Let us continue to fight for the glory of the...

318
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,750
The robot waifus!

319
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,050
However, due to the chaos following the collapse of Amasia, some...

320
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,690
That's cool!

321
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,450
We have robot waifus and then we have mecha waifus!

322
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,810
We have the best of both worlds!

323
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,190
...and a dark side to society.

324
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,870
Without electricity, how is Yoshio supposed to make food?

325
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,350
How is the mecha supposed to work?

326
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,330
Drifter Support Association comes in.

327
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,790
Wait, without electricity, then how would the mechas work?

328
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,650
Regular AO Crystal excavation and trade.

329
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,850
So that every human has equal access to our precious energy.

330
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:23,310
Oh!

331
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,390
Thank you Drifter Support Association!

332
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,730
So they have all the power!

333
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,670
So listen up, all you cool kids who want to be cool Drifters!

334
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,930
Are you a cool kid?

335
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,290
You want to join the army?

336
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,530
It's like whatever plans he has.

337
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,150
It's like the army using anime girls.

338
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,390
To recruit people.

339
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,050
To recruit soldiers.

340
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,990
Hello fellow children.

341
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,530
Would you like to sign up?

342
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,430
To represent your country?

343
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,930
We have anime girls.

344
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,550
And the recruiter.

345
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,350
...

346
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,470
The lineup sequence complete.

347
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,810
Display incoming.

348
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,330
Good.

349
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,250
First, check your visuals.

350
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,190
Check my visuals?

351
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,990
Look for the three displays.

352
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,010
Okay.

353
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,290
Oh, alright let's...

354
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,710
Okay, let me adjust the sensitivity real quick.

355
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,910
Okay, give me...

356
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,710
Oh, escape?

357
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,090
Oh, I can't yet.

358
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,550
I have to do the camera first.

359
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,630
Am I doing it correctly?

360
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,010
Clear!

361
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,610
I did it!

362
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,210
Okay.

363
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,250
Sorry, I wasn't looking at the right thing.

364
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,050
I partially did it.

365
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,990
Oh, nice!

366
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,250
It took me to the audio settings right off the bat!

367
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,950
Thank god!

368
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:52,550
I'm gonna get three... I'm gonna turn that down.

369
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,510
And I think it should be fine.

370
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,210
I think.

371
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,050
Okay, confirm.

372
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,930
Yeah, that's convenient, actually.

373
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,030
I really like that.

374
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,650
Wait, did it not confirm?

375
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,170
Oh, I have to do return!

376
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:07,590
Okay.

377
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,070
I'm gonna go outside for the first time?

378
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,670
I'm gonna touch grass?

379
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,570
Okay.

380
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,470
I got you.

381
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,050
Okay.

382
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,970
Batteries deplete the longer they are used, so keep an eye on the clock so you can make a safe return to the underground.

383
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,130
Alternatively, you can use a spare battery to recharge.

384
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,710
Okay.

385
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,050
Here I go.

386
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,710
Alright.

387
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,070
Here I go.

388
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,690
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

389
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,230
I'm jumping.

390
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,570
Okay.

391
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,690
My range is not that far.

392
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,290
Wait, I wanna customize her.

393
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,190
I don't like her.

394
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,450
Sorry!

395
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,730
You can customize her, right?

396
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,610
To make, like, your perfect waifu.

397
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,990
I wanna make a better waifu.

398
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,910
Keep an eye on your temps.

399
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,910
I have a bunch of things to say!

400
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,770
What do you mean?!

401
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,330
I want my robot waifu to look like the girl in the picture!

402
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,310
I want...

403
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,650
What do you think?

404
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,830
I wanna dress up my waifu!

405
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,750
Oh my god.

406
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,770
Oh my god.

407
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,050
Woah.

408
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:23,730
Woah.

409
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,870
Give me a sec.

410
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,230
Use all your search to find crystals.

411
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,890
I didn't mean that.

413
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,270
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,050
Please let me...

415
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,670
Please stop lagging me.

416
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,570
I didn't mean that.

417
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,490
You're so beautiful.

418
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,290
I didn't...

419
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,870
I didn't mean that!

420
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:38,790
Please.

421
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,770
I didn't mean that.

422
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,930
Don't lag me.

423
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,290
I swear.

424
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,150
I did not mean that!

425
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,330
This is what you get.

426
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,050
Okay.

427
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,190
Oh, please.

428
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,730
Woman, please.

429
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,790
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,670
Detected.

431
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,110
Go to the location shown at the top right of your display.

432
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,010
Okay.

433
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,150
Let me... let me fix this.

434
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,590
Let me fix this.

435
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,330
Okay.

436
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,690
Give me a sec.

437
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,470
Oh, no.

438
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,570
Where's the graphics?

439
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,330
Oh, it's not because we're in tutorial.

440
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,050
It's because we're in tutorial.

441
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,710
Okay.

442
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,590
Bring up the sound effects by 80.

443
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,070
Okay.

444
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:23,930
Alright.

445
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,410
Nice.

446
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,850
No graphics.

447
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,910
I'm sorry.

448
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,450
I didn't mean it.

449
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,470
I'm so sorry.

450
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,690
Please give me the graphics settings.

451
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,390
I would never change you.

452
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,010
You're beautiful.

453
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,870
You're so beautiful.

454
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,170
I would never change you.

455
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,270
Please don't lock the graphics settings.

456
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,970
Don't...

457
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,030
Don't lock the graphics settings.

458
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,490
They took away my graphics setting privileges.

459
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,050
They took it away.

460
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,590
Okay.

461
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,150
Tips.

462
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,230
Range weapons can be split into two categories.

463
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,270
Can be split into those that use energy and those that use live ammo.

464
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,630
Weapons... Oh, my God.

465
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,450
Please.

466
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,270
I'm so sorry.

467
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,070
I'm... I'm so sorry.

468
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,030
Oh, my God.

469
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,430
I'm so sorry.

470
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,730
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

471
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,370
Please don't take away my privileges.

472
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,110
Oh, shit.

473
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,350
I did it ever since I insult today.

474
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,110
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,710
I'm so sorry.

476
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:50,510
Oh, my God.

477
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,010
Okay.

478
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,230
I deserve that.

479
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,230
Honestly, I deserve it.

480
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,490
Okay.

481
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,070
I deserve that chat.

482
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,190
I'll never insult a beautiful robot waifu again.

483
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:21,090
I'll never insult this beautiful anime robot waifu again.

484
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,410
I'll never insult this beautiful anime robot waifu again.

485
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,830
I'll never insult this beautiful anime robot waifu again.

486
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,890
I'll never insult this beautiful anime robot waifu again.

487
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:25,990
I'll never insult this beautiful anime robot waifu again.

488
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,410
I'll never insult this beautiful anime robot waifu again.

489
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,090
Oh, I have to execute.

490
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,110
Oh nice, got a drill.

491
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,670
Don't you forget it.

492
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:49,130
It only happened because I said I wanted to customize her and make her more beautiful, but she was already beautiful inside and out.

493
00:24:49,330 --> 00:25:01,970
She was already... she was already beautiful and it only took her to take away my frame privileges to realize how beautiful she is, no matter what.

494
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,250
Okay, nice.

495
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,450
I got a grab.

496
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,910
Oh, I got rare!

497
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,010
Return elevator?

498
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,030
Use return points to summon an elevator and ride it?

499
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:23,990
Okay.

500
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,730
How do I... oh I can emote though.

501
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,310
Wait, I can't emote.

502
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,190
Wait, how do I take the return... Oh it's on the other side!

503
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,530
Okay.

504
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,730
Is it?

505
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,190
Where is it?

506
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,030
Where is the...

507
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,150
It's here!

508
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,630
There's like a yellow over there.

509
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,390
No, I won't customize her.

510
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,090
She's...

511
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,750
She's beautiful.

512
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,970
Wait, what's wrong with rain?

513
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,530
What's wrong with rain?

514
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,430
Oh, I forgot it's acid rain.

515
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,690
I forgot the whole story was that the rain is poisonous!

516
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,770
I'm like, what's wrong with that?

517
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,050
What's wrong?

518
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,830
It is a non-perious effect of weather.

519
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,970
Once your weather reaches zero, you will become to the environment.

520
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,930
Be careful of how much damage your unit takes.

521
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,090
Okay.

522
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,370
Thank you.

523
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,210
I will never replace you, I swear.

524
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,470
That's fast!

525
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,010
That's really fast!

526
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,370
For like...

527
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,930
Oh wait, okay, never mind.

528
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,790
Okay, I was going to say, did it stop raining?

529
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,890
But it didn't.

530
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,690
Okay.

531
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,450
Jeez.

532
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,970
This is why I hate rain.

533
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,370
Please stop talking.

534
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,010
Please!

535
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,630
Please!

536
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,310
Robot wife!

537
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,550
I need you to stop talking because I need to shoot him!

538
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,230
Sorry, I didn't mean you...

539
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,530
Sorry, you're perfect.

540
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,510
I'm so sorry.

541
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,190
I didn't mean that.

542
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,090
I'm so sorry.

543
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,250

00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,480
I can't tell the difference.

733
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,160
I can't tell the difference.

734
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,320
Alright, wait.

735
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:19,880
Can I...

736
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh, I think...

737
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,100
Oh my god.

738
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,920
The red though?

739
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,380
The red.

740
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,100
Actually...

741
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,300
No, I actually like the default a lot.

742
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,520
Alright, we'll confirm.

743
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,940
Can I take away her...

744
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,240
Appearance?

745
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,000
No.

746
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,800
Can I...

747
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,360
No.

748
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,060
Oh, I can't.

749
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,400
Okay, I want to take away her jacket, but they won't let me.

750
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,440
They won't!

751
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,940
Oh, I can give her one of her eyes!

752
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,240
Uh...

753
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,720
Right eye color.

754
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay.

755
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,060
We'll give that... Okay, no.

756
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,840
We'll give this one.

757
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,140
...

758
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,200
Yeah.

759
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,860
Oh, I don't know, actually.

760
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't know if that looks good.

761
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,360
No, that's too much.

762
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,340
That's too much, guys.

763
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,780
The eye is too much, guys.

764
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,220
Yeah, no.

765
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,160
We're gonna keep it there.

766
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,060
That's too much of a red flag, guys.

767
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,080
That's too much of a red flag.

768
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:20,540
Okay.

769
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm sad.

770
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,520
Alright.

771
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,800
What should we call her?

772
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,740
...

773
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,100
...

774
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,860
Alpha.

775
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,440
...

776
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,800
...

777
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,360
...

778
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,340
...

779
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,400
...

780
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,100
Okay.

781
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,720
Or no red flags.

782
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,320
...

783
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,940
Alpha real.

784
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,040
There you go.

785
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,720
Okay.

786
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,840
Real alpha.

787
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,120
...

788
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,720
Okay.

789
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,620
There you go.

790
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,080
Nice.

791
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,440
No!

792
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,560
Okay.

793
00:36:59,620 --> 00:36:59,900
Here.

794
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,400
There you go.

795
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,060
Real alpha.

796
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,780
Nice.

797
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,320
Yay!

798
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,380
...

799
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,440
...

800
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,840
...

801
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,300
...

802
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,660
We picked her!

803
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,100
...

804
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,780
Oh my god.

805
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,880
We picked her.

806
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,660
...

807
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,240
...

808
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,400
Oh my god!

809
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,000
I got my own garage!

810
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,780
...

811
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,220
...

812
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,280
...

813
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,740
...

814
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,260
...

815
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,260
...

816
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,160
What could go wrong?

817
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,280
We have a real alpha on our team.

818
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
She speaks.

819
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
She's here to guide us.

820
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,620
How do I...

821
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,920
I honestly like her outfit more without the jacket.

822
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,340
...

823
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,680
She's not gonna let me down!

824
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,820
I literally just got it!

825
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,640
Like, why is she judging me?!

826
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,540
I just got here!

827
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,920
It's okay, she's a real athlete, she can judge me all she wants.

828
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,240
Oh!

829
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,360
That doesn't sound hard.

830
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,140
Oh!

831
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,220
I got a job!

832
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,180
Guys!

833
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,360
I got a job!

834
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,620
Okay.

835
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,100
Maintenance.

836
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,400
Oh, that's just the main- Oh, there she is!

837
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,280
She's cleaning my garage!

838
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,180
Wow, Drifter, you live like this!

839
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,020
Thank you for the super chat!

840
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,580
I've tried my best here!

841
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,620
I literally just got here!

842
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,120
Welcome to the life of a brand new Drifter!

843
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,120
Drifter is a member of the Drifter Support Association.

844
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,360
You can expect a variety of requests from the association as well as other organizations.

845
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,200
Okay.

846
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,840
Completing requests earns you rewards.

847
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,700
The most achievements you racked up, the higher your evaluation would be, which unlocks new requests.

848
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,340
Okay.

849
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,760
It permits fighting other association members as a general rule.

850
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,820
If you intentionally and repeatedly attack- You hear that, guys?!

851
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,960
If you intentionally and repeatedly attack!

852
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,320
If you intentionally and repeatedly attack!

853
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:38,400
Association members, you will be expelled from the association!

854
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,080
So, if you attack me, i.e.

855
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,700
a member of our association, you will be kicked out!

856
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
That's all I'm saying.

857
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm saying, if you want to keep your hot robot anime waifu, then you would think about, you know, not attacking your fellow association member!

858
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,780
Or you're gonna get hunted by Rensetsu!

859
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,880
Fucking- Oh, Miltian too?!

860
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,120
This game just came out!

861
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,340
How many fucking boundaries are there?!

862
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,680
This game literally came out yesterday!

863
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,260
The closed network test!

864
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,540
This guy is gonna fucking get you!

865
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,360
Wait, I can see their waifus!

866
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,620
How do their waifus look like?

867
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,760
Oh my god!

868
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,940
They actually gave- They're like- Oh my god!

869
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,840
Wait, I like how- I like how this is default.

870
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,980
They made- They didn't even customize her a lot.

871
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,060
They didn't even- Customize her?

872
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Oh.

873
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,360
But then this guy went all out on the customization.

874
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,380
Alright.

875
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,520
Oh my god.

876
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,040
Oh, they gave her like a red- Oh, that's cute!

877
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,340
Yeah, this guy's default dad.

878
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,900
He's like- Thank god you can tell a lot about a person by what they made their character!

879
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,860
You can really- You can really tell a lot about- What kind of- What kind of waifu they want.

880
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,260
Oh, what kind of anime husband they want!

881
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,020
This guy doesn't care.

882
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,140
This guy's just here to grind.

883
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,480
I don't think he cared about customization chat.

884
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,020
This guy literally is just here to grind the game.

885
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,120
Like, everybody else is custom- This guy's just here.

886
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
He's just here.

887
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,980
But everybody else, you can tell a lot about the person.

888
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,500
With like, how they- How they customize.

889
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,980
I like how he's the only one with a guy, too.

890
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,340
He's like the only one with this guy.

891
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,900
Eleven- Oh, wait.

892
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,100
Okay.

893
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,060
Okay.

894
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,920
I was like, what the fuck?

895
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,520
It's interesting.

896
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,280
Bro, I hope this guy gets top ten.

897
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,920
I hope- I hope- I hope he gets top ten!

898
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,840
Oh my god, he is- Holy shit.

899
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,260
He's almost there!

900
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,180
Guys!

901
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:26,660
Guys!

902
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,860
He's almost there!

903
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,660
We gotta hope this guy gets top ten!

904
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,600
Yeah.

905
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,660
Alright.

906
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,880
Oh my god, dragon killer.

907
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,400
I love- I love like, the customized- Guys!

908
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I have not seen anybody use guy number two yet.

909
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,040
I- I actually haven't seen anybody use- Guy number two.

910
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,460
I saw two guy number fours.

911
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,840
But like, where's guy number two?

912
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,440
Is this guy number two- Is this guy number two?

913
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,480
Is that- Four- Is that him?

914
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,280
Wait, is that- That- Is that Beta- Beta?

915
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,140
Wait, there he is!

916
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,020
Beta two!

917
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,340
Oh my god!

918
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,480
I didn't recognize him at all!

919
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,740
I- To be fair, like, okay.

920
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,840
I- I should have recognized him when, you know...

921
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,120
I- I think I wanna- Oh, wait.

922
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,160
Okay.

923
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,820
Let's see, bro!

924
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,060
I- I didn't- Guys, I didn't look down.

925
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,440
I didn't look- I didn't look down, guys.

926
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,760
That was my issue.

927
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,600
Wait, I wanna- I really like this outfit.

928
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,360
Even though, like, I know it's her underwear.

929
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,880
But like, it's actually so cute.

930
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,140
Um, the innerwear there.

931
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,340
Oh!

932
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,600
That one- Wait, was it this one?

933
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,160
This one.

934
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,740
I think this is really cute!

935
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,060
I think this is so cute!

936
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,580
His shoes.

937
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,040
Oh, my gosh.

938
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,700
Oh!

939
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,820
Wait, that's so cute!

940
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,420
Oh, my God!

941
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,460
It looks like Dragon Ball with this!

942
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,840
Okay.

943
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,420
What about- Uh...

944
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:29,800
Uh...

945
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,120
What about the pants?

946
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,060
Okay, I- Guys!

947
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,520
Guys!

948
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,440
I know- It's actually so cute!

949
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,820
Guys!

950
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,000
Like, I know this is like, technically her underwear, but it's such a cute outfit!

951
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,380
It's actually really cute!

952
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,660
Okay, I'm gonna keep this.

953
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,020
Okay, I'm gonna keep this.

954
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,740
I actually really like this.

955
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,100
Alright, request.

956
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,180
What am I supposed to do?

957
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,620
So you're new.

958
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,040
We'll just find the crystals.

959
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,040
Oh, we've done this before!

960
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,960
We've done the crystals.

961
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah, I did it!

962
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,820
Hello fellow kids.

963
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,100
So hold on to your cradles and check this out.

964
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,180
Welcome, Rookie Drifter.

965
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,300
Today I'll be explaining everything you need to...

966
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,880
That's cute.

967
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,460
Out there, your cradle and Magus are your best friends.

968
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,300
So let's head out for a nice stroll on the surface.

969
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,100
We're best friends!

970
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,100
Take note of where materials can be found.

971
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,960
She's forced to be my friend because she was made just for me.

972
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,620
And keep your eyes out for the ever important AO Crystals.

973
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,240
Collect those AO Crystals because you can exchange them for cash.

974
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,520
But get beat up by an enemy.

975
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,100
And you lose all the stuff you found.

976
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,020
That's so cute.

977
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,460
I like the animation.

978
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,820
Find the nearest elephant.

979
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,720
Yeah, it's a pug suit.

980
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,840
Exactly, Miracle.

981
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,840
Thank you for the super chat.

982
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,180
Thank you.

983
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,320
It's not underwear, guys.

984
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,920
Technically...

985
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,680
Technically...

986
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,020
Since they are a robot...

987
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,220
The skin is a robot's underwear.

988
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,720
So like...

989
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,760
The clothes above it...

990
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,020
Is technically clothes.

991
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,700
If you think about it.

992
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,720
Because the skin is a robot underwear.

993
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,920
If you think about it, guys.

994
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,620
Okay.

995
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,520
Oh, I can watch you sleep.

996
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,320
I didn't mean to sound creepy, but...

997
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,420
Wait, wish list?

998
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:40,820
Register...

999
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,100
Oh my gosh, can I put...

1000
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,840
Okay.

1001
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,160
Collect... withdraw money.

1002
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,280
Lock, collect supplies.

1003
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,300
Item...

1004
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,260
Guys, robots don't sleep, guys.

1005
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,820
How can I watch something that doesn't sleep?

1006
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,080
What's this?

1007
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,120
Oh!

1008
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,180
Oh, it's like extraction.

1009
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,400
So like...

1010
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,140
This is my inventory.

1011
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,240
Repair kit.

1012
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,640
Sealing kit.

1013
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,560
Small ammunition.

1014
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,880
So I can buy these.

1015
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,300
Oh wait, no.

1016
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,160
These are my storage.

1017
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,180
So I get...

1018
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,980
All this in my storage...

1019
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,520
For now.

1020
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,180
I feel like I'm gonna keep all of this for now.

1021
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,380
Oh my gosh, she's making me mushrooms.

1022
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,160
What the fuck you doing?

1023
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,980
You don't need to eat.

1024
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,620
We have limited...

1025
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,420
You don't need to eat.

1026
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,160
Eating is cosmetics for you.

1027
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,560
It's just recreation.

1028
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,920
It's food.

1029
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,620
You don't know that.

1030
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,320
She's a robot.

1031
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,280
She doesn't...

1032
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,480
She just needs battery.

1033
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,460
What do you mean?

1034
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,120
I can't afford to feed both of us.

1035
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,500
She's testing for poison.

1036
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,660
It's called biofuel.

1037
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,600
Oh, there's insurance.

1038
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,080
I can have my stuff.

1039
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,640
Guys, please don't kill me.

1040
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,220
I'm not insured, guys.

1041
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,140
Guys, I'm not insured.

1042
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,580
Please do not kill me.

1043
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,960
Please.

1044
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,080
I have no insurance, guys.

1045
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,040
I have no health insurance and I'm visiting America.

1046
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:47,740
Okay, with the completion of the Great Shield, a base for drifters was also established inside the vertical shaft and the surrounding region was quickly stabilized.

1047
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:55,460
Dorms for the construction workers were also created inside the shaft and subsequent work proceeded quickly.

1048
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:01,580
But also, when around 80% of the construction work on the residential districts have...

1049
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,120
Oh, okay.

1050
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,720
So I'll never know what happened after.

1051
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
Okay, that's me.

1052
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,880
No, it's raining.

1053
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,000
Why is it raining?

1054
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,600
I really just got here.

1055
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,700
Why is it raining?

1056
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,360
Is there any crystals?

1057
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,200
Okay.

1058
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,640
Okay.

1059
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,260
Okay, where...

1060
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,780
Alright, don't worry.

1061
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,400
I got you.

1062
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
I got a monster.

1063
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,840
Okay, so he is melee.

1064
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,580
Where the fuck are all the crystals?

1065
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,280
Did you guys steal all the crystals?

1066
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,700
Oh, shit.

1067
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:54,980
Nice.

1068
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,520
I got loot.

1069
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,220
Guys, I need to remind... I am not insured, guys.

1070
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,460
I... Please, guys.

1071
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,600
I am... I'm not insured, guys.

1072
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,880
I need... Please, everybody.

1073
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,020
I'm not insured, so please.

1074
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,960
Where is he?

1075
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,640
There's the crystal.

1076
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,820
This enemy is known as a chaser.

1077
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,060
These things are quick.

1078
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,600
Keep your head on a swivel.

1079
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,200
What if I just shoot it?

1080
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,540
What is he gonna do?

1081
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,040
Kill me?

1082
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,820
Is there any...

1083
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,700
He is not dead.

1084
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,680
What is he gonna do?

1085
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,420
Jump up?

1086
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,660
Bro, he's just down there.

1087
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,040
He can't do jack shit.

1088
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,200
Like, what is he gonna do?

1089
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,760
Jump?

1090
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,860
So easy.

1091
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm just gamer.

1092
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,720
Okay, we need to figure out where the crystals are.

1093
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,280
Alright.

1094
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,060
AO search.

1095
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,940
I'm not detecting any new AO crystal readings.

1096
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,200
No crystals anywhere?

1097
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,380
Robot waifu!

1098
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,300
How am I gonna provide for our robot family?

1099
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,920
I'm, like, scared of, like, actually going... like, using my speed.

1100
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,800
Cause, like, what if...

1101
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,180
Oh, another chaser.

1102
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,260
Don't worry, I got you.

1103
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,940
Check the map.

1104
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,160
The map just gives me the elevators.

1105
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,820
I have to search.

1106
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,300
I detect faint gunfire.

1107
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,980
Faint gunfire?

1108
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,840
Oh, no.

1109
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,000
No, no, they're here.

1110
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,980
Guys, we're working in the same association, guys.

1111
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,980
Just remember that we are working together.

1112
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,040
We are part of the same team.

1113
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,040
Okay, I think we're okay, right?

1114
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,220
I do hear, like, gunshots.

1115
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,600
Gunshots nearby.

1116
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,520
I'm trying to find... guys, please, I'm on my first mission, guys.

1117
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,620
There's still no crystals anywhere.

1118
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,480
Did you guys take all the crystals?

1119
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,220
Wait, is there fall damage?

1120
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,760
Well, time to find out.

1121
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,060
Damage is catastrophic.

1122
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,680
Be ready to bail out.

1123
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,440
You should perform repairs in a safe area.

1124
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,340
Guys, can you...

1125
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,980
Guys, please don't...

1126
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
Guys, there's... guys, there's...

1127
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,220
Guys, we're out.

1128
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,940
Guys, there's fall damage.

1129
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,560
How do I...

1130
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,460
I don't have repairs.

1131
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,980
How do I...

1132
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,940
How do I...

1133
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,880
Guys, there's fall damage.

1134
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,960
Guys, please, I swear to God.

1135
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,740
No!

1136
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,840
What do you mean?

1137
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,060
It starts raining!

1138
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,220
What the fuck do you mean it starts raining?

1139
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,240
How do I fucking... how do I heal myself?

1140
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:43,900
Confirm.

1141
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,480
Oh, no.

1142
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,480
I detect a faint sound.

1143
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,720
What's the button?

1144
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,120
An Ender has detected us.

1145
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,660
No!

1146
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,620
Fable detected.

1147
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,640
Ender incoming.

1148
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,580
Now, sustained.

1149
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:56,920
Oh, no.

1150
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,820
Nice aim.

1151
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,640
Ender has sustained damage.

1152
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,100
Oh, God.

1153
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,640
Okay, okay.

1154
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,140
How do I heal?

1155
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,740
How do I heal?

1156
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,740
Age, okay.

1157
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,620
Age, okay.

1158
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,720
Wait, I thought he could heal me.

1159
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,920
He not heal me?

1160
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,100
Is that your heal?

1161
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,720
Don't you have an ability?

1162
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,480
The system has been recovered in full.

1163
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,740
I used the wrong one.

1164
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,740
I forgot green goes to green.

1165
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,100
Green goes to green.

1166
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,160
Detected by a chaser.

1167
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,900
Green is green, blue is blue.

1168
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,000
Okay, we're learning, guys.

1169
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,600
Okay.

1170
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,980
Is there a crystal?

1171
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,080
I'm not detecting any new enemies.

1172
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,360
How is there no crystal?

1173
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,320
Did you guys take all the crystals I just got here?

1174
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,420
Okay, what's this?

1175
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,100
Oh, a sheet.

1176
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:45,840
Metal sheet.

1177
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,480
Looks like a mild drizzle.

1178
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,320
Alright, mild drizzle.

1179
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,900
Green goes to green, guys.

1180
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,900
You guys didn't know that.

1181
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,940
See, I can swap my gun.

1182
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,720
What gun is this?

1183
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,140
This is a better gun.

1184
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,780
Make a skill primed and ready to go.

1185
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,500
You can now deploy a field that will recover durability.

1186
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,420
Really?

1187
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,700
The weather's gotten better.

1188
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,560
Oh, it's like these items have cooldowns.

1189
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,260
I see.

1190
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,280
I see now.

1191
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,120
Oh my god, why is there so much acid rain everywhere?

1192
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,260
AO search.

1193
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:18,880
Please.

1194
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,160
I'm not detecting any new AO crystal readings.

1195
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,440
How is there still no crystals?

1196
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,880
How is there still no...

1197
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,560
Guys, please.

1198
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,280
I just need crystals.

1199
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,260
Guys, please.

1200
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,440
Stop farming all the crystals, guys.

1201
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,460
Guys, okay.

1202
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,360
I found out there's fall damage, so...

1203
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,220
If I could get on this rope...

1204
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,100
Explore.

1205
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,720
I'm trapped.

1206
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,300
Wait, what's this?

1207
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,680
Oh, copper scrap.

1208
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,100
Oh my god, rare find.

1209
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:50,700
This is quite a rare item.

1210
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,020
Okay.

1211
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,460
Let's see.

1212
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,680
I thought this was open, not gonna lie.

1213
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,300
Oh, I don't have any room.

1214
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,920
What's more important?

1215
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,100
Oh, I do have room.

1216
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,300
Oh, I can carry like two more pounds.

1217
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,080
Wait, is that red, a crystal?

1218
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,740
AO search.

1219
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,180
I'm not detecting any new AO crystals.

1220
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,740
Is that red?

1221
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,640
No, it's not.

1222
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,320
Another chaser?

1223
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,380
Okay.

1224
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,080
This is... I don't know.

1225
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,640
I don't know if this gun is better or not.

1226
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,100
Okay, it's not.

1227
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,240
I can't tell.

1228
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,620
I think the recoil is not the best.

1229
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,240
I might use the light ammo.

1230
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,060
Is this PvP?

1231
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,940
If you want to be kicked out of the association...

1232
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,320
It's not PvP, guys.

1233
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:36,660
It's...

1234
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,260
Guys, it's not PvP, guys.

1235
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,120
It's not PvP.

1236
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,320
I like to say it's not PvP, chat.

1237
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,040
If you're in my lobby right now, it's not PvP.

1238
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,820
Another chaser?

1239
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,420
Yeah, I like this gun more.

1240
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,600
I'm running out of ammo, though.

1241
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,460
Like, I'm actually running out of ammo.

1242
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,960
Oh, it's PvE, everybody.

1243
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,520
If you're a dragoon, it's PvE.

1244
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,560
How is there still no...

1245
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,620
What do you mean there's still no... I fucking...

1246
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,160
I walked so far.

1247
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,280
Real alpha.

1248
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,420
I walked so far.

1249
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,260
There is melee.

1250
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,460
It's E.

1251
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,180
E is melee.

1252
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:37,900
See?

1253
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,080
But I'm like... I'm literally trying to find...

1254
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,220
A crawler.

1255
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,340
A crawler?

1256
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:44,940
Watch out.

1257
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,440
What the fuck is a crawler?

1258
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,320
Wait, is that crystal?

1259
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,020
Is that fucking crystal?

1260
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,200
What the fuck is going on?

1261
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:52,960
Where are they going?

1262
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,240
It's raining.

1263
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,360
Oh, it's because it's raining.

1264
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,020
Okay.

1265
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,120
Oh my god, I think that's a crystal.

1266
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,040
Guys.

1267
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,040
Guys.

1268
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,500
Guys, I...

1269
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,280
Guys, I found the first crystal.

1270
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,620
Guys, oh my god.

1271
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,620
The one crystal.

1272
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:07,920
The...

1273
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,560
The one...

1274
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,880
The one...

1275
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,760
Fucking...

1276
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,660
Finally...

1277
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,520
Oh my god, there's so many!

1278
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,200
Wait, that's not a crystal.

1279
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,800
That's...

1280
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,460
That's not a crystal.

1281
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:17,820
Sorry.

1282
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,920
Wait, is that a crystal?

1283
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,560
Where is it?

1284
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,060
Where the fuck is this...

1285
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,560
Oh, there it is.

1286
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,280
Oh my god.

1287
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,560
That's what it looks like.

1288
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:29,820
Please.

1289
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,680
Please get away.

1290
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,340
Please.

1291
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,680
Oh god.

1292
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,140
Oh, thank god.

1293
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:35,400
Okay.

1294
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,180
Oh, thank god.

1295
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,780
We found...

1296
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,780
Fucking finally found the crystal.

1297
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,560
We need one more.

1298
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,340
We literally need one more crystal.

1299
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,880
Oh no.

1300
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,160
It's okay.

1301
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,380
They'll repair me.

1302
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,580
Oh no.

1303
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,980
I have only 57 bullets left.

1304
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,900
What are they looking at?

1305
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,340
What the fuck is going on for this guy?

1306
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,320
He's just jumping.

1307
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:04,880
Okay.

1308
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,420
Goddammit!

1309
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,940
You guys farmed everything!

1310
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,380
It's okay.

1311
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,340
My armor can repair itself later.

1312
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,120
Guys, my armor is not repairing itself.

1313
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,000
It's...

1314
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,140
I'm just trying to find the one crystal.

1315
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,740
Why is it always...

1316
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,400
Who fucked up the environment?

1317
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,320
Why not?

1318
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:32,680
Oh god.

1319
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,300
Who did this?!

1320
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,760
Guys, I have no ammo.

1321
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,820
I've been here so long trying to fucking find this one crystal.

1322
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,580
One last crystal.

1323
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,180
Get out!

1324
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,400
Oh shit, okay.

1325
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,600
Okay, this is bad.

1326
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,480
This is bad.

1327
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,560
I need a repair.

1328
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,360
You repair me here?

1329
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,620
Okay, nice.

1330
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,480
Oh my god, who fucked up this environment?

1331
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,760
Okay, I need to find this crystal.

1332
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,800
The last crystal.

1333
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,280
Guys, I don't... there's no cover, guys.

1334
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,740
It's over.

1335
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,140
There's no cover.

1336
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,780
Wait, what's this?

1337
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,000
Is she gonna heal me?

1338
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,440
Oh!

1339
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,240
Oh nice!

1340
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,800
I'm getting healed.

1341
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,240
Oh, that's the ability!

1342
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,820
That's the support cradle!

1343
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,320
That's what I was trying to find earlier.

1344
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,460
Oh!

1345
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,740
Okay, that's actually really good.

1346
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,300
What the?

1347
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,360
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

1348
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,740
Ah, that's the best thing!

1349
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,420
I'm sorry!

1350
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,180
We're friends!

1351
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,720
I'm sorry, you scared me!

1352
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:51,920
You scared me!

1353
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:52,740
Please!

1354
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:53,720
Please!

1355
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,820
I worked... Please, I'm so sorry!

1356
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,340
Please, you scared me!

1357
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,820
Please, no!

1358
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,580
Please!

1359
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,920
Oh, it's abandoned?

1360
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:06,920
Oh, thank god.

1361
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,780
I thought he was a... I thought... guys, there's no PvP, by the way.

1362
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,200
I'm not scared because I thought he was a real...

1363
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,900
Guys, I... guys, there's no PvP.

1364
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,420
It's not because I was... I was scared that this was another real person.

1365
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:22,960
Okay?

1366
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,580
I just need you guys to know that.

1367
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:28,980
Okay...

1368
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,940
Um, no, we're okay.

1369
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,580
We're... we're okay.

1370
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:40,640
Oh my god, I guess I'll go downstairs then.

1371
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,580
There must be like... it must be downstairs because I don't see anything from... um...

1372
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,920
Um, I don't see anything downstairs... like upstairs here.

1373
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,680
So it has to be down here, right?

1374
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,020
I just need one... one tiny crystal.

1375
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,400
Literally, I'm missing one.

1376
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,180
I just need one... one tiny crystal.

1377
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:02,320
Literally, I'm missing one.

1378
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,240
Only ten more minutes.

1379
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,760
Wait, I only have ten... it's fine.

1380
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,080
There's no way I can fuck this up.

1381
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,640
There's no way I can fuck this up.

1382
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,400
Please... please, Robot Waifu, I need one more crystal.

1383
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,880
That's all I need.

1384
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,920
That's all I fucking need.

1385
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,540
Go check under the rocks.

1386
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,620
I'm scanning, though.

1387
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,680
I should be able to find it from just scanning.

1388
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,560
Okay.

1389
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,240
Okay.

1390
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,160
It has to be one.

1391
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,420
There has to be one.

1392
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,740
They can't fuck with me like this.

1393
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,620
You guys... you guys are taking a... took everything.

1394
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,280
Like, this is a barren wasteland now.

1395
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,100
Everybody else on day one fucking scavenged this land.

1396
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,280
There's nothing left.

1397
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,820
There's nothing left.

1398
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,420
Chaser...

1399
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,340
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1400
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,820
How is there...

1401
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,220
How far do I have to fucking go?

1402
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,600
There's no way it sees me, right?

1403
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,980
What the fuck is that?

1404
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,040
Does it see me?

1405
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,180
Okay, nice.

1406
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,420
Okay, what does it drop?

1407
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,020
What is this?

1408
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:17,940
Oh, nice.

1409
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,840
A crawler core.

1410
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,700
Okay, maybe if I scan here...

1411
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,080
Guys, I don't think there's crystals at a base, guys.

1412
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:26,520
I don't...

1413
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,000
I don't think... I don't think there's crystals...

1414
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,700
Oh, jeez!

1415
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,420
Oh, god, it's green!

1416
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:34,980
It's green!

1417
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,480
Okay, I did it.

1418
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:41,840
Okay.

1419
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,220
Okay, I was a little worried because it was green.

1420
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,320
I thought green means it's gonna be stronger.

1421
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,960
I was a little worried.

1422
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:53,380
I don't think there's crystals here, guys.

1423
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:53,960
I don't...

1424
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,580
I don't think there's crystals here.

1425
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,520
I...

1426
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,180
I have eight minutes left.

1427
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,280
Thank you.

1428
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,460
Thank you, Real Alpha.

1429
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,740
But I really...

1430
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,180
I really need to find this one crystal.

1431
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,120
Oh my god!

1432
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,240
Fucking finals!

1433
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,980
And it starts raining!

1434
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:15,600
This is...

1435
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,980
When would my luck...

1436
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,760
When would my luck change?

1437
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,160
And it starts raining.

1438
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:22,720
Okay.

1439
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,320
You know what?

1440
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,220
Fuck me, I guess.

1441
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,740
I didn't like rain.

1442
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,740
No, lord.

1443
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,700
Only crystals.

1444
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,080
Alright.

1445
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,060
Here we go.

1446
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:37,740
I found the last... the last remaining crystal that people have not scavenged yet.

1447
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,660
I swear to god, if I get there and another player took...

1448
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,840
What the fuck?

1449
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,080
Wait, is he?

1450
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
Oh, no.

1451
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,180
Oh, I have zero ammo, guys.

1452
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,860
Oh, this is very bad.

1453
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:56,160
This is actually... Oh, this is actually very bad for me.

1454
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,300
Oh, JK.

1455
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,140
JK.

1456
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

1457
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,860
Is he dead?

1458
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,300
Okay.

1459
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:16,860
Thank god.

1460
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,180
Okay.

1461
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,240
Okay.

1462
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:19,720
Okay.

1463
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:20,260
Thank god.

1464
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:20,720
Okay.

1465
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,200
I was... I was scared.

1466
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,500
Guys, I was very scared.

1467
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,360
I had no ammo.

1468
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:33,820
Okay.

1469
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,720
We got it.

1470
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,320
We fucking finally...

1471
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,060
Went and dealt melee.

1472
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,480
The last fucking crystal in the world.

1473
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,640
There's no way I needed more crystals.

1474
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,000
There's no fucking way.

1475
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,140
Oh, my god.

1476
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Just at 5,000, too.

1477
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,400
Okay, we're gonna head to the elevator.

1478
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:53,680
Alright.

1479
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,820
Elevator time.

1480
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,440
How far is it?

1481
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:57,880
Oh, god.

1482
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:58,840
It's pretty far.

1483
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,020
Okay.

1484
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:01,860
We're gonna go this way.

1485
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,720
It overheats really fast, so I need to, like, balance my... my run.

1486
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,160
No, please.

1487
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:08,580
No.

1488
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:09,560
Please.

1489
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,720
Oh, he's in the water.

1490
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,920
He can't get out of the water.

1491
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,360
That's good.

1492
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,900
I need to, like, manage my run.

1493
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,280
It's okay.

1494
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:18,940
I'm gonna make it.

1495
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,420
There's no way.

1496
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:22,700
Okay.

1497
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:23,220
Ascend.

1498
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:24,780
They can't climb.

1499
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,140
They don't have opposable thumbs.

1500
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,600
That's fucking right.

1501
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,240
I know they don't have opposable thumbs.

1502
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,260
Okay.

1503
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,620
I'm, like, balancing my run ability now.

1504
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,540
No, it's blocking me from the elevator.

1505
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,000
Please.

1506
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,740
I have zero ammo.

1507
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,360
Please.

1508
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,000
Zoom.

1509
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,580
No, there's two of them.

1510
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,620
No, I overheated!

1511
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:44,960
It's okay.

1512
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:45,860
They don't see me.

1513
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,680
Their AI can't see me.

1514
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,240
Guys, it's okay.

1515
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,680
Their pathway's not gonna hit me all the way here.

1516
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,040
Yeah, see?

1517
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,720
It gave up.

1518
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,260
It had to run a little bit more and it gave up.

1519
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,220
Thank fucking god.

1520
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,060
Zero ammo but two big arms.

1521
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,980
Oh my god, please.

1522
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,320
We're almost there.

1523
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,520
We're so close.

1524
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,080
Oh, why is there so many of you?

1525
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,060
You can keep going.

1526
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,440
Just make sure you have enough battery to return.

1527
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,240
Don't worry.

1528
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,160
I do.

1529
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,860
Did I, like, fucking go the longest way possible?

1530
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,160
Like...

1531
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,180
No.

1532
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:26,920
No.

1533
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,120
No!

1534
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:28,420
No!

1535
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,060
No!

1536
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,120
Please!

1537
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,320
I worked so hard to be here!

1538
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,440
Oh god.

1539
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,900
Heal me.

1540
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,140
Heal me.

1541
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,320
No.

1542
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,720
Does he see me?

1543
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,520
Guys, I think I chose, like, the longest area to be in.

1544
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,300
Like...

1545
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,000
Like, really?

1546
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,240
Oh my god.

1547
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,190
And it starts raining.

1548
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,320
Okay.

1549
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,400
Okay, 300 meters.

1550
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,460
We're so close.

1551
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,560
We're so close.

1552
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:09,340
I know it's raining but I know I'm in choice.

1553
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,360
Oh god.

1554
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,980
They're almost there.

1555
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:19,160
This has to be the roughest journey of my life.

1556
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,020
Alright.

1557
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,540
We don't...

1558
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,100
Oh no, here you go.

1559
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:26,740
Return.

1560
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,080
Please.

1561
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,120
Oh my god.

1562
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:31,960
The Sia.

1563
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,040
What about the Sia?

1564
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,360
Weather resistance depleted.

1565
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:37,200
Please.

1566
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,920
Further weather and contamination damage will...

1567
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,340
Please!

1568
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,300
No!

1569
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,020
My HP is raining!

1570
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,540
Fifteen seconds until elevator evolves.

1571
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,680
Fifteen seconds, please!

1572
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,100
I'm dying out here!

1573
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:51,860
That's okay.

1574
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,360
I can live fifteen seconds.

1575
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,760
This has been very rough on me.

1576
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,480
Real alpha.

1577
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,120
Does that...

1578
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,560
Five seconds.

1579
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,360
No, it's okay.

1580
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,200
I'll be fine.

1581
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,320
The elevator is...

1582
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,140
I'm not gonna... It's okay.

1583
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,840
A little acid rain is not gonna hurt anybody, right?

1584
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,600
See, we made it.

1585
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,540
Elevator will descend in fifteen seconds.

1586
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,020
Please, I swear to god.

1587
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:13,880
We're good people.

1588
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,120
Analysis complete.

1589
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,800
Holy fuck.

1590
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,980
That scared the shit out of me.

1591
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,380
No violence.

1592
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,280
Please, I'm unarmed.

1593
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,300
I'm...

1594
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,660
Good timing.

1595
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,780
I thought I was actually dead at the time.

1596
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,180
Just kidding.

1597
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,800
Oh my god.

1598
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,680
We got lucky out there.

1599
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:43,320
The timing.

1600
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,760
Let's hope we didn't use it all up.

1601
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,900
All right.

1602
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,300
How about we go over...

1603
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,280
Oh my god.

1604
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,440
That was actually...

1605
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,540
Look at me go.

1606
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,460
You can see me fucking...

1607
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,840
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

1608
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,900
You can see me walk around in a circle trying to figure out where the crystal is.

1609
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,560
I was so confused.

1610
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,340
I was so fucking confused.

1611
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,180
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

1612
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,680
All right.

1613
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,080
Nice.

1614
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,340
Where the fuck is...

1615
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,020
Oh my god.

1616
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,940
There were so many players around me.

1617
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,600
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

1618
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,380
We did it.

1619
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,660
There's Odin Lover right here.

1620
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,100
Encountered a chaser at this location.

1621
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,720
Yeah, but chasers are so weak.

1622
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,700
It's not even...

1623
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,400
Successfully escaped.

1624
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,560
It's not even that scary.

1625
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,120
The rain clouds cleared up...

1626
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,260
I didn't realize... This map is actually a lot bigger than I expected.

1627
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,920
Encountered an ender...

1628
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,940
Everyone's avoiding me.

1629
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,940
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

1630
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,720
This is where I'm like...

1631
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,400
Guys, it's because of all of you guys, I couldn't find a fucking crystal.

1632
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,220
You mind it all.

1633
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,200
Like...

1634
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,440
The rain clouds cleared up here.

1635
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,880
All right.

1636
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,020
Then I got another tool here.

1637
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,680
This is a 19-minute report?

1638
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,020
How fucked...

1639
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,660
How confused was I?

1640
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,020
How is this a 19-minute report?

1641
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,480
I was so confused.

1642
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:17,660
No,

1643
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,220
I don't...

1644
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,140
I just think it's so funny.

1645
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:26,620
Okay.

1646
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,900
Oh my God.

1647
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,200
I was so...

1648
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,020
What the fuck?

1649
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:32,580
Wait.

1650
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,620
Wait.

1651
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,460
Wait.

1652
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,040
No, I...

1653
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,280
No, I have to go back after that.

1654
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,200
Like, what the fuck happened there?

1655
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,480
Like, I traveled so far.

1656
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:45,840
Like...

1657
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,140
Like, like how...

1658
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,240
Oh my God.

1659
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,040
I was so confused.

1660
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,020
Like, I was actually...

1661
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,180
I was so...

1662
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,340
I went everywhere.

1663
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,680
I was...

1664
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,960
I was everywhere.

1665
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,800
I was so fucking confused.

1666
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,500
The entire world tour.

1667
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:08,780
I like...

1668
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,040
I traveled across the world.

1669
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,260
I truly lost child.

1670
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,560
I did not expect myself to like be that confused.

1671
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,200
If you PVP you couldn't...

1672
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,620
Guys, this is my first mission.

1673
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,820
I'm not winning any PVP battles.

1674
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,800
I'm not winning any.

1675
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm going on my own journey to the west.

1676
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:38,480
My channel is still here.

1677
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,620
Not a bad haul.

1678
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,120
Oh my God.

1679
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,100
Where was I?

1680
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,600
Where the fuck was I?

1681
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,560
I went to a new area.

1682
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,280
Where the fuck...

1683
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,160
Why was there so many people here?

1684
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,600
Why was that so...

1685
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,720
Why did I not bump into any of these people?

1686
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,800
There were four different people here?

1687
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,360
Why did I miss all of them?

1688
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:10,780
And then there's that guy.

1689
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,320
Oh, and then I met that guy.

1690
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,780
He went and won.

1691
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,040
Why did I miss those guys?

1692
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:21,320
Guys!

1693
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,460
Holy shit!

1694
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,240
You're not invited to the meeting.

1695
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,760
Alright, nice.

1696
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,380
Yeah.

1697
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,240
Anyway guys, there is PvP.

1698
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,060
There is PvP in this game.

1699
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,400
I was just very scared about PvP.

1700
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,000
Alright.

1701
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:48,380
Oh!

1702
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,000
I made so much money!

1703
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,100
What a journey.

1704
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,880
I literally explored so much.

1705
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,600
Trying to find these goddamn crystals.

1706
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,920
Oh my god, I'm rich!

1707
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,280
I have a hand grenade?

1708
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,560
I have like crafting stuff?

1709
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,200
Alright, proceed.

1710
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,000
Okay, I got it.

1711
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,860
I brought like five or some shit.

1712
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:16,880
I did that!

1713
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,360
I did real alpha!

1714
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,440
Oh my god, now I can spend my money!

1715
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,090
They weren't on the map yet.

1716
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:34,350
The game seems to start tracking people who are on the map at the end.

1717
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,230
Even though they might join halfway through.

1718
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,130
Oh, that's interesting.

1719
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,710
Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

1720
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:39,630
Thank you, thank you.

1721
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,090
Oh my god!

1722
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,150
I'm marketable!

1723
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:45,230
We need resources.

1724
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:48,490
Once we've got that secured, we can revamp our production space.

1725
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:54,670
If we fix up the floor and do something about the walls, we can make a craft station in here.

1726
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,230
Oh, that's true!

1727
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:01,550
Wait, so I don't get auto-repaired afterwards?

1728
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:05,070
Okay, make sure to report back after...

1729
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:09,070
Oh, I need to collect a completion request, please.

1730
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:14,370
Yeah!

1731
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,130
I can make my house prettier!

1732
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:21,910
So my robot anime waifu would love me more.

1733
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:23,430
Nice.

1734
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,030
Stay sharp and prepare for the next one.

1735
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,010
Yeah!

1736
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:34,610
Put your adult pants on.

1737
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,790
Time to learn about job requests.

1738
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,150
There's more?

1739
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:43,030
Time for a little lesson about requests.

1740
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,170
Go forth and complete these requests.

1741
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:50,230
Oh, she's like a little Navi.

1742
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:51,270
I just realized that.

1743
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:56,810
You'll get access to new products at the store.

1744
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,010
New crafting recipes.

1745
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:58,770
Yeah!

1746
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,790
You'll also be allowed to sortie into more regions.

1747
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:07,450
I get to go to the west.

1748
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,730
The more you'll have available to you.

1749
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:10,930
Or the south, sorry.

1750
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:15,530
So remember, helping others helps you.

1751
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,930
She's like Navi but hotter.

1752
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:22,150
Because she's not a fucking circle.

1753
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,610
She's not a circle anymore.

1754
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,730
Okay, upgrade my...

1755
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,690
Upgrade your craft station.

1756
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:30,730
I mean...

1757
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,670
Oh, I automatically accepted it.

1758
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:33,150
Okay.

1759
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,210
Is she doing my dishes?

1760
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,250
Like...

1761
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:41,650
Is she doing my dishes?

1762
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:42,870
Okay.

1763
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:44,970
Okay.

1764
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,250
Okay, production.

1765
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,930
Okay, to really put...

1766
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:53,290
Yeah, Navi wouldn't do my dishes.

1767
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:56,230
I hate to really think...

1768
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:00,090
To really put your garage to use.

1769
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,710
Try repairing the walls, ceilings, and floor.

1770
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:05,390
Register items you need for renovations to your wish list.

1771
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:10,570
Your magus will remember them and offer you relevant advice while out on expeditions.

1772
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:11,650
Oh, so like...

1773
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,550
So tell me what I need to...

1774
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:14,930
To like...

1775
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,250
To renovate.

1776
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:16,710
Okay.

1777
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:17,970
What would it look like?

1778
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,850
What would it look like if I quick build?

1779
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,650
Like...

1780
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:23,510
Do I just...

1781
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:24,310
I don't want to spend anything.

1782
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,610
I'm worried that it's going to make me spend stuff when I do quick build.

1783
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,210
Okay, complete.

1784
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:29,490
Does it look better?

1785
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,610
Does it actually look better?

1786
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,050
Did she just snap her fingers and it's just going to be better now?

1787
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,780
Okay.

1788
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:58,200
What do you think?

1789
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,280
What the fuck did she do?

1790
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,220
And I think that should do it.

1791
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,020
Like, there's still stuff on the floor.

1792
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,400
Like, what did you do?

1793
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,360
Like, there's still garbage on the floor.

1794
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,800
What did you do?

1795
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,880
It looks worse?

1796
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,800
Like, I can't tell.

1797
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,140
Like, there's still...

1798
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,760
Why is there dirt on the floor?

1799
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,260
Why is there...

1800
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,080
Floor!

1801
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,380
There's grass on the floor!

1802
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,240
How did you have this grass on the...

1803
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:49,940
There's fucking...

1804
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,020
An environment.

1805
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,820
There's fucking terrarium.

1806
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,240
There's...

1807
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,300
An entire ecosystem is growing on my floor.

1808
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:59,960
How is that helpful?

1809
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,420
I don't understand.

1810
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,580
Oh, yeah.

1811
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,580
This money.

1812
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,760
I'm not spending money.

1813
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,240
We're waiting.

1814
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,080
Wait.

1815
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,820
What is in the corner now?

1816
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,040
There are no brooms.

1817
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,420
Okay.

1818
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,300
What is she going to do here?

1819
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:21,800
Okay.

1820
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,020
Yeah, we need to make a craft station.

1821
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,680
The alpha cleans your mecha and makes your floor worse.

1822
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:32,100
Imagine.

1823
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,900
What the beta would do.

1824
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:34,400
All right.

1825
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1826
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:36,260
Thank you.

1827
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:36,860
Thank you.

1828
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,520
Pretty sure those weeds are...

1829
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,780
That's not what weeds are.

1830
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,040
What do you...

1831
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,140
Weeds are not supposed to be edible.

1832
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,540
What are you trying to do to me?

1833
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,440
Okay.

1834
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,500
That looks a little better.

1835
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,940
Not the ceiling.

1836
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,420
Did he...

1837
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,680
Is she trying to make me eat weeds?

1838
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,080
Guys, I think I chose the wrong one.

1839
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,500
The wrong...

1840
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:03,620
The wrong...

1841
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,580
I'm mad at you, bro.

1842
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:07,900
Okay.

1843
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,660
There's less...

1844
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:08,900
All right.

1845
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,640
That's better.

1846
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,940
There's less of a fucking ecosystem.

1847
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,540
But, like, how is this a max level?

1848
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:25,440
Guys, I don't understand how a hole in my ceiling is the max level.

1849
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,640
But...

1850
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,140
All right.

1851
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:30,920
Poster girl.

1852
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:31,340
Exactly.

1853
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,060
Thank you.

1854
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,300
The girl on the cover wouldn't do this to me.

1855
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,920
All right.

1856
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,420
Let's see.

1857
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,640
Set up a craft station.

1858
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,280
Okay.

1859
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,200
All right.

1860
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,220
Eat the weed, Doki.

1861
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,620
All right.

1862
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,360
Complete.

1863
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,100
What do I have?

1864
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,270
Time to put in the craft station.

1865
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,350
Come on.

1866
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:00,290
Let's get to it.

1867
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:00,930
Yeah!

1868
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:02,690
The craft station.

1869
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:04,470
All right.

1870
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,830
I just wonder if I'm just sitting there watching her do all of this.

1871
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:11,470
Like, I'm complaining, but, like, I won't do anything to help her out.

1872
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,250
God, I'm perfect.

1873
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:20,450
Don't mock the ventilation system.

1874
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:23,530
Miracle, thank you for the super chat.

1875
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:24,350
Thank you.

1876
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,690
I'm just getting into the immersion, guys.

1877
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,610
Oh, that's a lot better.

1878
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:37,930
Okay.

1879
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:42,510
I just want to get she can do all of that, guys.

1880
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:42,970
Oh, my God.

1881
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:43,690
She can, like...

1882
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,670
She's like an engineer.

1883
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:46,870
She can do everything.

1884
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:49,930
Oh my God.

1885
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,450
Oh, my God.

1886
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:51,690
Looks so much better now.

1887
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,230
It looks so nice.

1888
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:53,870
I wish I...

1889
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:56,010
I wonder if I could visit other people's houses.

1890
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,230
And craft equipment and consumables as well as make repairs.

1891
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:05,030
As you venture to a more challenging location, upgrading your equipment is a must.

1892
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:05,550
Okay.

1893
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,950
Wait, I need a repair.

1894
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,130
Can I repair?

1895
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,110
That's for sure.

1896
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,010
Like, I am...

1897
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,070
Did I repair?

1898
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,410
I guess I repaired everything.

1899
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,690
Can I... weapons.

1900
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,030
Can I upgrade my weapon?

1901
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:21,270
Oh!

1902
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:24,070
This is just repairing everything.

1903
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,030
I want to craft.

1904
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,270
Oh, I didn't repair all!

1905
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:30,590
Okay.

1906
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:31,950
Wait, how do I repair all?

1907
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,730
How do I repair all though?

1908
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:39,010
Uh...

1909
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,710
No, I want to repair all.

1910
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:43,650
How do I do it?

1911
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,050
All items?

1912
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:45,990
Oh, there it is!

1913
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:48,820
6,800 and...

1914
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,910
Guys, I don't...

1915
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,050
Guys...

1916
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:58,330
Guys...

1917
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:00,110
Guys...

1918
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,910
We don't need repairs.

1919
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:03,790
We...

1920
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,750
Oh, wait.

1921
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,130
Oh, it cost 2?

1922
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:10,370
Why did it say 6,890?

1923
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:12,450
Oh!

1924
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,590
Oh!

1925
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,390
It means it uses... Oh!

1926
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:18,570
Oh!

1927
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,330
Sorry, I can't math.

1928
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,070
Sorry.

1929
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,030
Guys, I can't math.

1930
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:23,950
I think you guys know that.

1931
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,030
Can I make anything cool?

1932
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:27,990
No, I cannot.

1933
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,050
Okay.

1934
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,630
I need aluminum scrap and first gen.

1935
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:34,210
Oh, these are heals!

1936
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,070
I can't afford that.

1937
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:37,850
I haven't been...

1938
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,670
I haven't been like scrounging for stuff.

1939
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:42,770
Are these all my materials?

1940
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,970
Are these all my materials?

1941
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,150
I guess they are.

1942
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:47,690
I guess they are.

1943
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:49,030
What do you mean cleaning?

1944
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:52,470
Am I gonna make her clean?

1945
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:53,810
Like, what is this?

1946
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:55,670
What do you mean like...

1947
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,030
What do you mean like cleaning?

1948
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,370
What do you mean like cleaning?

1949
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,690
Okay, I surrender.

1950
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:02,150
Surrender?

1951
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:04,050
Okay, I want...

1952
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,810
What do I have?

1953
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:10,450
Okay, we gotta have this so we make sure nobody tries to kill us.

1954
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:15,610
Okay, Roger.

1955
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,490
Okay, there we go.

1956
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,010
We need...

1957
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,650
We need this.

1958
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,850
Wait, she takes a bath?

1959
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,930
Wait, at what point do I unlock that?

1960
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,430
Like, what?

1961
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,480
Okay.

1962
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:35,780
What?

1963
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:37,800
What?

1964
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,160
Wait, excuse me?

1965
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:43,960
Okay.

1966
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,180
I got money.

1967
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,120
Excuse me?

1968
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,640
She takes a bath?

1969
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,200
Okay.

1970
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,720
Okay.

1971
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,160
I think we're fine.

1972
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,280
Prep.

1973
01:23:58,380 --> 01:23:58,900
220.

1974
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,520
What is this?

1975
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,280
Hand grenade.

1976
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,280
Repair kits.

1977
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,840
Okay, we need ammo.

1978
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,080
I just realized I have...

1979
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,800
Wait, what happened to my inventory?

1980
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:15,310
Wait, what happened to my inventory?

1981
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,310
What the fuck happened to my inventory?

1982
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:18,430
What?

1983
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,570
Wait, did I...

1984
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:22,270
Did I accidentally...

1985
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:23,710
What happened?

1986
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,110
Oh, I cleared all?

1987
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:28,710
How the fuck did I...

1988
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,710
How did I...

1989
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,390
Oh, how did I do that?

1990
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:34,930
Press M?

1991
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:36,610
Oh.

1992
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:38,250
Okay, nice.

1993
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:39,150
What is this?

1994
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:40,550
Light energy...

1995
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,850
Oh, okay, nice.

1996
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,250
We'll grab more light ammo.

1997
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,450
Because I feel like I...

1998
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:45,210
Actually, no.

1999
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,230
I need to make sure I don't use all my...

2000
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,710
Uh, alright.

2001
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:52,810
I think we're good.

2002
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:53,950
I think we're good to go.

2003
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:55,590
Uh, alright.

2004
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:56,230
Let's see.

2005
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:57,230
I'm ready.

2006
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,590
Okay, at one point...

2007
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,710
Um, do I...

2008
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:04,290
Guys, at one point...

2009
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,290
All I'm saying...

2010
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,010
Is do I unlock the cleaning?

2011
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:13,990
So, I'll be right back.

2012
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:16,190
I'm gonna grab more water.

2013
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:16,770
I'll be right back.

2014
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,600
Guys, I don't have insurance.

2015
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,060
I need to remind you guys.

2016
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,320
I do not have insurance.

2017
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,880
Please.

2018
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,780
I can't afford...

2019
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,420
Insurance right now, bro.

2020
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,820
Guys, please.

2021
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,940
I have a robot.

2022
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,860
And I have a waifu...

2023
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:24,940
To take care of.

2024
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,740
Guys, please.

2025
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,180
I...

2026
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,420
Wait,

2027
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:36,260
the insurance...

2028
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:36,820
Is free?

2029
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:38,540
I...

2030
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,320
I'm sorry.

2031
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,980
I live in North America.

2032
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,720
I never realized insurance...

2033
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:44,460
Is free.

2034
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,700
Insurance can be free?

2035
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,080
When was that?

2036
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,540
What the fuck is...

2037
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,140
There's no way.

2038
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,380
How would the insurance company...

2039
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,140
Make thousands, millions of dollars...

2040
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:58,760
Off of people?

2041
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,900
Okay, let's get this crystal.

2042
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,480
Yay!

2043
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:09,940
Guys.

2044
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:10,980
Guys.

2045
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,320
Guys.

2046
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,780
In Canada...

2047
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:16,060
Even though health insurance...

2048
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,040
Is free...

2049
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,580
You gotta wait 2 million hours...

2050
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,920
Until like you get...

2051
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,740
You get to see a doctor.

2052
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:24,780
So...

2053
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:26,240
Like...

2054
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,120
You guys don't understand.

2055
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:30,780
Free healthcare...

2056
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,840
Is not as great as you think it is.

2057
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,400
Like...

2058
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:36,460
Like...

2059
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,920
We've got contact from another doctor.

2060
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:40,980
It's not...

2061
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:41,900
It's not as like...

2062
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,760
The perfect world.

2063
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,480
If you got stabbed...

2064
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,540
And you have free insurance...

2065
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,220
You're still waiting...

2066
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,120
Like 2 million hours, guys.

2067
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,180
If it's not a...

2068
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:57,420
If it's not like an emergency stab.

2069
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:00,080
If it stabbed you in a place...

2070
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,340
Where it's like...

2071
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,720
As long as you won't bleed out...

2072
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,180
And it's not in your internal organs...

2073
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:06,740
Then it's fine.

2074
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,280
And so like...

2075
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,660
They're not gonna see you.

2076
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,180
If you have free insurance.

2077
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,080
Wait.

2078
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,720
Where's the monster?

2079
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,980
It's still free though.

2080
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:24,660
Oh, chaser.

2081
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,460
That's what we have to kill.

2082
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:28,980
Okay, nice.

2083
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,720
Oh, we got you.

2084
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,460
A chaser?

2085
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:35,900
Oh, he's dead.

2086
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,740
Just don't get stabbed.

2087
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:39,540
Easy.

2088
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:41,820
The only difference is that...

2089
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,660
For Americans, you guys still have to wait...

2090
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,700
2 million hours.

2091
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,920
To be paid.

2092
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,380
Yeah, you guys have to think.

2093
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,680
You guys have to pay.

2094
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,020
And still wait the same amount.

2095
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,720
We get it for free.

2096
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,540
But we still have to wait a long time.

2097
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,160
We gotta pay more.

2098
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,840
We won't wait less.

2099
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,260
Okay.

2100
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:08,680
Alright.

2101
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,160
Hello, George.

2102
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,620
Thank you for the super chat.

2103
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,080
Thank you.

2104
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,300
Where the fuck are they?

2105
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,340
I found 200 monsters.

2106
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:18,840
But now I find 2 million crystals?

2107
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,520
What is this?

2108
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,620
Now I can't find...

2109
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,460
A single monster.

2110
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:25,760
Okay.

2111
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,620
An incoming...

2112
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:30,920
What?

2113
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,420
What did I detect?

2114
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:33,740
Guys.

2115
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:34,200
Okay.

2116
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,280
I need to know.

2117
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:35,660
Guys.

2118
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,160
Nobody has explained to me...

2119
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,820
When do I unlock...

2120
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:41,360
Cleaning.

2121
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,560
Nobody has yet...

2122
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,640
Said anything about that.

2123
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,080
From a new what?

2124
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,460
Oh, Cradle is a robot.

2125
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,340
Oh, am I getting stalked?

2126
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,780
Am I getting stalked?

2127
01:29:58,780 --> 01:29:59,920
Who's fucking stalking me?

2128
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:00,960
Like...

2129
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,620
Who's stalking me?

2130
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,480
Okay.

2131
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,260
I can't find a single monster.

2132
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,180
It's like they know.

2133
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,040
Mobility has decreased.

2134
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,280
It's like they know that I need like...

2135
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,920
I need to kill monsters.

2136
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,640
I detect a faint sound of an engine somewhere.

2137
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,580
Oh, thank fucking god.

2138
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:20,920
Okay.

2139
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:21,840
There is a...

2140
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,800
There is the monster.

2141
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,740
This is the target of the hunt request.

2142
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,680
Can you upgrade the base to get a fucking...

2143
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,580
Bathtub?

2144
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,920
Oh no, please.

2145
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:33,240
Why is it raining?

2146
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,760
Ender has sustained damage.

2147
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,060
Is he dead yet?

2148
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,360
Why is he just standing there?

2149
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,460
Okay, nice.

2150
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,220
Alright, we gotta go inside.

2151
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,020
Wait, is that a bad guy?

2152
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,880
It's a bad guy.

2153
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,000
That is absolutely a bad guy.

2154
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,680
Oh my god, that is a bad guy.

2155
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,060
Wait, where is he?

2156
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,920
That's fine, he's dead.

2157
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,940
Oh, there's so much loot here!

2158
01:30:59,460 --> 01:30:59,860
Nice!

2159
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,380
Okay, we got a lot of good loot though.

2160
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,300
Okay, we got a lot of good loot though.

2161
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,140
A lot of upgradeable loot.

2162
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:06,860
Wait, what's this?

2163
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:08,960
Who needs...

2164
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,140
Oh no, Jonesy.

2165
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,280
Thank you for the super chat.

2166
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,300
Thank you, thank you.

2167
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,640
Yes, that's money!

2168
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:18,200
Okay, we gotta wait here until it stops raining.

2169
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:20,620
Is it still...

2170
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,000
God damn it, it's still raining.

2171
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,020
Okay.

2172
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,100
I'm reloading.

2173
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,360
Guys, please.

2174
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,380
Guys, when you fix the environment, I can't...

2175
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:36,140
I can't deal with this rain, guys.

2176
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:40,420
I can't deal with the rain every...

2177
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:42,800
every 10 seconds, guys.

2178
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,300
Please.

2179
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,160
I just passed the target?

2180
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,980
Ooh, loot though.

2181
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,120
There's one here.

2182
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,020
Isn't that just Canada?

2183
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:57,580
Yeah.

2184
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,500
That's the West Coast for you.

2185
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,720
That's the worst part about living in the West Coast.

2186
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,100
We don't get snow.

2187
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,040
We just get rain.

2188
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,120
We literally just get rain.

2189
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:08,680
That's it.

2190
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:12,960
Alright.

2191
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,380
Let's see.

2192
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,640
We need two more.

2193
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,520
I heard him.

2194
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:21,040
I heard a guy.

2195
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,060
Oh, there he is.

2196
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,380
There's one.

2197
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,900
There's one more.

2198
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:26,940
Snow is fun.

2199
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,700
I hate the snow.

2200
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:28,860
Honestly, like...

2201
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:34,920
If I had to choose between snow or rain, I'd choose rain.

2202
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:42,120
Just because snow is such a bitch in general when it comes to like...

2203
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,440
When it comes to like having a dog.

2204
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,700
At least a dog would...

2205
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:53,380
His dad would still like go use the bathroom.

2206
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,260
But like, when it's snowing, he refuses.

2207
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,840
He fucking refuses.

2208
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,080
Oh, thank god.

2209
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:01,840
That's a large...

2210
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,820
Oh no, it's a small one.

2211
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,940
Okay, we'll go for that.

2212
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:07,880
Alright, that's the last one.

2213
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,420
Oh my god, this was easier than the crystal.

2214
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,820
I didn't go on a fucking adventure like last time.

2215
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,580
Thank god.

2216
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,140
Bye.

2217
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,200
Alright, he's almost dead.

2218
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:24,140
Okay, nice.

2219
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,360
We did it.

2220
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,300
Where's the closest?

2221
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:26,460
What's this?

2222
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,140
Oh my god, remember when I went all the way here?

2223
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,680
When there was like two near me?

2224
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:37,220
I can't believe I went that way.

2225
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,060
Oh my god.

2226
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,460
Oh hey, there's more here.

2227
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,260
Oh, I need green barrels.

2228
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:45,820
Okay.

2229
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,820
I need to find more of that.

2230
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,400
Is this just like in the wild?

2231
01:33:51,640 --> 01:34:00,400
Yeah, tiny dogs don't like snow because it's like bad because their legs are too tiny so it touches the floor.

2232
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,480
So their stomach touches the floor so they fucking hate that shit.

2233
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,540
Oh my god.

2234
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,420
I need to find...

2235
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,560
Guys, is there any dragoons in my world right now?

2236
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,560
Can you drop me like five green barrels?

2237
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,540
I don't know where to find them.

2238
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,300
Where do I find the green barrels?

2239
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:22,900
That's an engine.

2240
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,540
That's an engine?

2241
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,520
Guys, I don't know where to find this.

2242
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:30,300
Guys, I don't know where to find this.

2243
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:30,900
I'm so bad.

2244
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,320
I'm so bad at exploring.

2245
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,540
How do I get up top?

2246
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:35,260
How do I get up top?

2247
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,460
What the fuck?

2248
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,440
I'm like stuck down here.

2249
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,420
Oh, it's a bandit.

2250
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,480
Maybe he has them.

2251
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:46,740
Oh, shit.

2252
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:47,180
Okay.

2253
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,260
Oh, shit.

2254
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,100
Oh, he's doing so much damage!

2255
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,040
I'm sorry!

2256
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:54,680
Help!

2257
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:56,880
That's right.

2258
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,700
What you gonna do?

2259
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,240
Walk up to me in my heels?

2260
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,260
Wait, where did he go?

2261
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:01,860
Did he die?

2262
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,380
Oh.

2263
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,580
Oh no, he reset itself.

2264
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,540
Wait, why the fuck did you reset yourself?

2265
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,400
What are you doing?

2266
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,280
Wait, where did he go?

2267
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:13,840
My...

2268
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,420
Oh, we're going like merry-go-round right now.

2269
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,260
Oh no.

2270
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,440
Please leave me alone.

2271
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:21,740
Are you serious?

2272
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,300
How strong are you?

2273
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,640
Oh, he's dead.

2274
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:24,900
Okay.

2275
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,140
Okay, he was that strong.

2276
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,020
Is there any green barrels?

2277
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,080
Okay, no.

2278
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,180
That's just normal stuff.

2279
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,240
Oh no, I don't have enough inventory space.

2280
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:37,520
Okay.

2281
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,080
Okay, I can keep taking stuff.

2282
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,960
That should be fine.

2283
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,580
Yeah, 99?

2284
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,480
That's fine.

2285
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,200
Oh, overloaded.

2286
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:53,640
Oh, overloaded.

2287
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,660
Oh, but they're good stuff.

2288
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,080
They're good stuff.

2289
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,220
They're good stuff.

2290
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:02,600
No!

2291
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,140
I don't have green barrels!

2292
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,540
Okay, I guess we just go.

2293
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,360
We just leave.

2294
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,500
Okay, we have to find a way to go up.

2295
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:17,000
Okay, we have to find a way to go up.

2296
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Is it up here?

2297
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,460
How the fuck do I go up?

2298
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:19,800
I have to go upstairs.

2299
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,320
I can't read maps.

2300
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:22,720
Are you fucking...

2301
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,280
Okay, I need to go this way.

2302
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,520
Alright, this is it.

2303
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,520
Guys, are you...

2304
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,780
Guys, please.

2305
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,760
Guys, if you're in my map area, please, I need green barrels.

2306
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,240
That's all I want.

2307
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,720
I need green barrels.

2308
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,020
Am I going the right way?

2309
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:46,880
Oh wait, it's this way.

2310
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,740
I can read a map, guys.

2311
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:51,460
Drop the trash.

2312
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,400
Oh, there it is!

2313
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,120
I see the elevator!

2314
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,280
Nice.

2315
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,340
Alright, we did it.

2316
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,440
We found our way.

2317
01:36:59,200 --> 01:36:59,940
I can't.

2318
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,480
I can't find the last two green barrels.

2319
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,980
I only need green barrels.

2320
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,740
Well, I'm like full HP, technically.

2321
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:15,000
I just want upgrades so I can unlock a very special thing.

2322
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,280
I'm not going to end stream until I unlock it.

2323
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,120
This is like my goal.

2324
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,840
This is my goal in life.

2325
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:26,880
That is actually my only goal in life right now for this game.

2326
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,260
I didn't bump into anybody.

2327
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:34,620
I guess like nobody really PVPs because they don't want to get banned from the association.

2328
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:35,960
Wait, is this a guy?

2329
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:37,500
Hey!

2330
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,100
Please.

2331
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,420
Please.

2332
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,920
I am unarmed.

2333
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,920
That gun is just cosmetics.

2334
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,520
Guys.

2335
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,240
I'm unarmed.

2336
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,100
This gun is just cosmetics.

2337
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,480
I swear to God.

2338
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,340
I swear.

2339
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,520
Alright, nice.

2340
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,220
I should be fine.

2341
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,400
Nobody here.

2342
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,840
A return request?

2343
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:10,980
What?

2344
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,760
Oh, that means they're leaving on a different area.

2345
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,960
It's just...

2346
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,880
It's my cosplay.

2347
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:22,220
It's my cosplay gun.

2348
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:23,980
We did it!

2349
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:28,040
We did it!

2350
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,720
I wonder if there will be teams in the future for this game.

2351
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,520
Did I make money?

2352
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,080
How much money did I make?

2353
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:43,460
Alright.

2354
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:44,980
Oh, there's the guy I met!

2355
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,280
We found somebody.

2356
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:55,960
That's the guy I met!

2357
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:00,980
Oh, he has the anime husband!

2358
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,920
We were literally like side by side.

2359
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,880
Did not see him at all until we fucking...

2360
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,340
I saw him like 30-50 meters away in the distance.

2361
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:16,380
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

2362
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:18,980
That's us.

2363
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,760
Who the fuck is this guy?

2364
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,440
Oh, is he fighting a boss there?

2365
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,480
Who's that guy?

2366
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,560
Oh, is he a bounty?

2367
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,180
Is that why there's red there?

2368
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,880
I don't understand what the red is.

2369
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:33,960
Rain confirmed here.

2370
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:35,040
A light shower.

2371
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,580
More entered the fray and things escalated to a multi-cradle fight.

2372
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,180
Oh, there was a hunter here?

2373
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,000
Here's where we obtained crafting materials.

2374
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,500
Wait, was he a real guy?

2375
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:49,480
Wait, was he a...

2376
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,960
Wait, who the fuck was that guy?

2377
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,660
Wait, was he a real guy?

2378
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,620
Who's that?

2379
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,760
Oh, he wasn't.

2380
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,760
Okay, I was like...

2381
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,420
Oh, that's an NPC.

2382
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,440
Okay, thank god.

2383
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,240
I was like, there's no way.

2384
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,840
Why did he look like that?

2385
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,700
Why can't my anime waifu look like that?

2386
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,460
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

2387
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,440
This is where we obtained a requested item.

2388
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,940
Never seen this item in this location before.

2389
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,040
Never seen this item in this location before.

2390
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,180
Logging coordinates for reference.

2391
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:24,480
We encountered a crawler Where was I?

2392
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,460
How did I get here?

2393
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:30,200
How the fuck?

2394
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,640
How the fuck did I get here?

2395
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,140
Oh, and I walked back.

2396
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,140
Okay, I was gonna say.

2397
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,940
I went that far?

2398
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:37,520
What?

2399
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,120
Okay, this is...

2400
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,780
Oh, this is another bandit that I killed.

2401
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,640
Yeah, I got another bandit here.

2402
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,620
And I just walked backwards.

2403
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:56,500
And then...

2404
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,260
I saw him again!

2405
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,140
This is where I saw that guy again.

2406
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,840
Alright, exit.

2407
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:04,380
Oh my god, I just went like...

2408
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,860
Let's start by reviewing your AO Crystal Hall.

2409
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:11,980
Alright.

2410
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:14,480
Yay!

2411
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,500
We're gonna be rich!

2412
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,440
Real alpha!

2413
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:24,600
I'm gonna... I'm gonna spoil you!

2414
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:28,060
Looks like you got some valuable items.

2415
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:28,540
Oh, I did.

2416
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:29,400
I got a lot of shit.

2417
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,800
Wait, is race... Oh, it's materials.

2418
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,460
Okay.

2419
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,620
And now, let's take a look at the request progress you've made.

2420
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,200
Okay, that is my bad.

2421
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:42,160
I... I could not find more green barrels.

2422
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,000
I have no idea where the fuck to find these.

2423
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,200
Be sure to apply.

2424
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,960
I tried my best, ma'am.

2425
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,860
I don't know where to find green barrels.

2426
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,540
I don't know this map good enough.

2427
01:41:53,920 --> 01:42:01,060
There was no dragoons in my lobby, so I couldn't... I couldn't mooch off of other dragoons.

2428
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,380
Alright.

2429
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,220
Completion!

2430
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,380
By the way, I heard there's short staff at the lab.

2431
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,940
Maybe you can see if there's anything you could help out with.

2432
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,920
I need to go to the foresty money...

2433
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:14,480
area.

2434
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,620
I got arms!

2435
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,320
I got cosmetic arms.

2436
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,500
I have crafting stuff.

2437
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,200
New request has been made.

2438
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,600
What did they give me?

2439
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,100
Use the following amount of mag... Oh, this one!

2440
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,380
Buy the following amount.

2441
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,960
Defeat the following amount of enders with an assault rifle.

2442
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,320
Defeat the following amount...

2443
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:42,700
Oh, okay.

2444
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:43,840
So...

2445
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:45,520
Do I need to repair anything?

2446
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:46,400
Okay.

2447
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:47,660
Repair.

2448
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:48,640
Alright.

2449
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,000
So I need a craft.

2450
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,260
Is this a sub machine?

2451
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:58,120
Oh.

2452
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:06,670
I don't have the B grade sub machine part.

2453
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:08,270
Okay.

2454
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:11,450
Uh...

2455
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:12,890
Oh, wait.

2456
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:14,070
What does the arms do?

2457
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:16,790
Oh!

2458
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:21,010
It's makes it... What does it do?

2459
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:22,410
Oh!

2460
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,590
It makes it stronger!

2461
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:26,290
Okay, I see.

2462
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:27,370
That's what it does.

2463
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:28,630
Okay, I still need...

2464
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:29,850
I need one more!

2465
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:30,810
Can I buy that?

2466
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:33,250
I wonder if I... Is there a shop?

2467
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:34,990
That I can buy that from?

2468
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:36,870
No.

2469
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:38,230
I can only craft.

2470
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:38,870
There's no...

2471
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:39,410
Wait!

2472
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:40,090
There has to be!

2473
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:40,230
Yeah!

2474
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:40,970
There's an item shop!

2475
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:45,370
Do I have enough?

2476
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:48,110
No, it doesn't matter.

2477
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:51,130
I need to actually...

2478
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:53,910
Wait, can I just buy the sub machine?

2479
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:54,870
Do I need a craft?

2480
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:56,310
Oh, I need to craft it!

2481
01:43:58,450 --> 01:43:58,810
Oh!

2482
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:00,990
But, um...

2483
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:07,630
It says that I need a... It says I need to like buy... I need to craft the barrels.

2484
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:08,670
Don't I?

2485
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:10,870
Does buying it count?

2486
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:13,310
I wonder if it counts.

2487
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:14,230
I'll just buy one.

2488
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:18,850
Okay, I'll buy five.

2489
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:19,970
I have enough money.

2490
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:22,550
Can I do it?

2491
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:26,190
Yes, you fucking liars.

2492
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:27,830
It still says craft.

2493
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:32,250
I need to buy...

2494
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:33,450
You meant the machine.

2495
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:34,270
Oh my god.

2496
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:36,370
You were talking about the fucking machine gun.

2497
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:39,210
You were talking about the fucking machine gun.

2498
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:39,670
You were talking about the fucking machine gun.

2499
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,070
Okay.

2500
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,190
Okay.

2501
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:42,110
Let's buy it.

2502
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:46,730
Okay, I bought it.

2503
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:50,330
I thought you meant...

2504
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:51,870
Okay.

2505
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:52,790
Probably the following.

2506
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:53,370
The fee.

2507
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:53,690
Okay.

2508
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:54,230
There we go.

2509
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,570
I thought you guys...

2510
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:57,810
I thought you guys meant the machine gun.

2511
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:59,430
The fucking... Oh my god.

2512
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,070
Okay, how do I find...

2513
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:05,050
Okay.

2514
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:05,670
Prep.

2515
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:07,890
Where's my other arm?

2516
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:09,450
There we go.

2517
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:10,190
We're gonna...

2518
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:12,850
Change it to... Oh, wait.

2519
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:13,250
No.

2520
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:14,470
We'll change this.

2521
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:15,110
Okay.

2522
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:18,150
She's so good at reading.

2523
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,130
What do I have to press?

2524
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:23,810
M, right?

2525
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:25,470
M.

2526
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:25,670
Okay.

2527
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:26,210
Automatic.

2528
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:26,650
Yeah.

2529
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:28,690
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

2530
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,650
I'll be right back, guys.

2531
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:14,320
Back, guys.

2532
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:15,540
I'm back.

2533
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,080
Alright.

2534
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,640
What do I have to do?

2535
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,880
When do I... Please.

2536
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,480
When do I unlock this?

2537
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,120
Oh my god.

2538
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:24,780
Okay.

2539
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:27,180
No, we can do... Is it living space?

2540
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:28,520
Yes.

2541
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,640
What is it?

2542
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,380
Is it flooring?

2543
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:32,940
Okay.

2544
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:33,880
Maybe it's flooring.

2545
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:35,780
It can't be.

2546
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,220
It's not... Maybe it's flooring.

2547
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,700
Guys, what do I...

2548
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:43,280
What do I have to do to unlock living space?

2549
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,300
Do we...

2550
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:51,620
Okay.

2551
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,500
We'll do floor space first.

2552
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,260
I have to upgrade the bathroom?

2553
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,420
How do I get the bathroom?

2554
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,800
How do I get the bathroom?

2555
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:04,700
Okay.

2556
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:05,700
We got the pit space.

2557
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:06,980
Okay.

2558
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:07,900
We got the floor.

2559
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:08,440
Alright.

2560
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,260
My anime robot waifu.

2561
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,180
Fix the floor for me while I watch.

2562
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:25,060
We never had the bathroom in the first place?

2563
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:32,100
Guys, I just want to unlock everything, you know?

2564
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,960
We'll make sure that you guys see everything it gives us, you know?

2565
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:39,180
Like, you guys get like a clear vision on what this game is about.

2566
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:39,760
You know?

2567
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:40,600
I'm just doing what...

2568
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:44,080
I'm just trying to be a good um, chiller.

2569
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:48,460
I'm just trying to chill really well and just give you guys everything!

2570
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:49,580
I...

2571
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:54,120
We'll be able to sort you much more safely with the options this way.

2572
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:54,380
Oh, hey.

2573
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,480
Actually, it's nicer now.

2574
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:56,920
Let's turn to the ceiling walls.

2575
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,080
How could you do that for the first place?

2576
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:00,820
There was like dirt on the floor.

2577
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,720
This one actually doesn't have dirt on the floor now.

2578
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:03,920
Okay.

2579
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:07,000
I need brittle iron ore infusion compound.

2580
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,640
I don't know where the fuck I can get that.

2581
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,500
Oh my god, please.

2582
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:12,420
We're so close to getting living space.

2583
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,020
Come on.

2584
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,060
Please.

2585
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:18,100
Okay.

2586
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,300
I need to look at my quest.

2587
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:19,780
Okay.

2588
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:21,220
We need...

2589
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,080
Guys, I need you guys to remind me.

2590
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:23,340
Okay.

2591
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,980
We need to get green barrels.

2592
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:29,080
We need a kill enders with the assault... the assault rifle.

2593
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,600
The assault rifle... Do I have assault rifle?

2594
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:34,980
And then we need to use...

2595
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,200
AO searches and mag...

2596
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,380
Okay.

2597
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:39,060
We can do all of this at once.

2598
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:39,440
Okay.

2599
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,900
Let me... Wait.

2600
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:41,720
What do I have?

2601
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:43,320
Do I have assault rifle on?

2602
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:44,980
Is that...

2603
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:45,880
That's not assault rifle.

2604
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:46,660
Oh!

2605
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,360
Okay.

2606
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:48,040
Assault rifle.

2607
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:48,280
Okay.

2608
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:49,220
We need more light ammo.

2609
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:50,600
We actually need more light ammo.

2610
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:52,500
Um... Okay.

2611
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:53,120
We got...

2612
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:53,760
We got this.

2613
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,180
This is fine.

2614
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,120
Okay.

2615
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:56,480
Sort.

2616
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:00,660
There's more?

2617
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:05,910
Guys, okay.

2618
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:07,030
I'm gonna put insurance in there.

2619
01:51:11,190 --> 01:51:12,470
Okay.

2620
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:21,030
And we can...

2621
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,570
in the gun.

2622
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:31,590
I didn't even know that the gun wouldn't hit the gun.

2623
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:31,750
Okay.

2624
01:51:33,190 --> 01:51:33,910
Okay.

2625
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:34,870
Okay.

2626
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:36,370
Now...

2627
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:37,510
We got one.

2628
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:41,950
How do I run away if they have the same speed as me?

2629
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:46,550
Why do I look like PlayStation 1 and he looks like PlayStation 5?!

2630
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:49,410
Like, that's so messed up!

2631
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:54,710
Okay, how do I...

2632
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:55,510
Um...

2633
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:57,950
Wait, how do I put you in insurance?

2634
01:51:58,990 --> 01:52:00,030
Guys, I wanna...

2635
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:01,350
Okay...

2636
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:03,330
Can I apply all insurance?

2637
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:06,590
Wait, no, that... I need money for that.

2638
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:08,430
Wait, that costs money.

2639
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:12,690
No, I don't...

2640
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:13,170
No.

2641
01:52:14,030 --> 01:52:14,750
No.

2642
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:17,250
Okay, guys, we're not gonna have insurance, guys.

2643
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:19,230
See?

2644
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,790

It's 135 dollars!

2650
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:40,570

01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:58,070
We don't need lore.

2656
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:01,150
We don't need lore.

2657
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:05,610
If you wanna know what robot inflation is like...

2658
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:08,050
Look up robot inflation on Google.

2659
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:09,450
Okay.

2660
01:53:09,570 --> 01:53:10,590
Hey, there's crystals!

2661
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:13,830
There's so much crystals!

2662
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:17,530

We need this!

2670
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:40,710
We actually needed this!

2671
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,110
Alright, nice.

2672

01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:51,550
Nice.

2676
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:53,430
Okay, we got another chaser.

01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,550
Oh, you found one?

2678
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:01,970

You're so useful!

2684
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:10,590
Okay, what the fuck?

2685
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:13,110

2686
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:15,130
Please, I can't...

2687
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:16,150
Oh god, please.

2688
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:18,910
Oh no, I don't have enough.

2689
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:22,910
Wait, when...

2690
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,350
When does it show up?

2691
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,290
When do you start...

2692
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:28,910
Oh, it's loading!

2693
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:29,470
Okay.

2694
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,710
Did it stop raining yet?

2695
01:54:31,710 --> 01:54:32,010
No.

2696
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:34,010
Okay, I have two...

2697
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:34,930

I can't...

2700
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:38,690
Guys, I can't!

2701
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,770
I have to use her ability!

2702
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:41,930

2703
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:43,270
Guys, it's okay.

2704
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:44,650
There's no way I'll die.

2705
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:46,510
Guys, there's no way.

2706
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:49,010
There's no possible way I could die, guys.

2707
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:49,410
There's...

2708
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:50,290
No way.

2709
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:51,790
I can't be that unlucky, guys.

2710
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:52,150
Like...

2711
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:58,910
Guys, we have to use our abilities for the objective, guys.

2712
01:54:58,990 --> 01:54:59,810
There's no way.

2713
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:01,690
There's no way I could die.

2714
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:03,270
We don't need it.

2715
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:03,690
We'll be...

2716
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:04,570
We're so healthy.

2717
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:05,890
We're so healthy, guys.

2718
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:07,330
Oh my god.

2719
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:08,970
Please, save the environment.

2720
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:10,870
Oh, hello.

2721
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,950
Hello.

2722
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:17,830
Oh, yeah!

Just looks at me and walks away!

2724
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:23,190
Where are they fighting?

2725
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:25,910
Oh, they're friends!

2726
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:28,350
Oh, they're friends!

2727
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:30,190
Wait, how did you guys fight each other?

2728
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:30,830
I'm by myself!

2729
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:31,670
How do you guys have friends?

2730
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:33,230

2731
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:33,690
Wait, what?

2732
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:37,550
How did he find friends?

2733
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:43,490
I just said, stop fear.

2734
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,910
How did he get friends?

2735
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:52,870
I don't understand.

2736
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:56,930
I don't understand.

2737
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:57,350
I don't understand.

2738
01:56:00,010 --> 01:56:02,730
Yes, I'm saying to play with other people.

2739
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:05,770
Did it stop raining?

2740
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,730
How is it still?

2741
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:08,170
Please, it's right there.

2742
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:10,750
I just want the green barrels.

2743
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:12,570
It's literally right there.

2744
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:13,310
Please.

2745
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,590
Oh my god.

2746
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:22,330
Why is it still raining?

2747
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:26,010
Oh my god.

2748
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:27,370
Why?

2749
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:29,630
No, it didn't.

2750
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:29,870
Look.

2751
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:33,130
Look, I'm literally taking damage.

2752
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:35,610
Okay, now it hasn't.

2753
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:37,050
I can't believe you guys...

2754
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:39,010
I can't believe that one guy baited me.

2755
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:40,070
He was like, no, it stopped raining.

2756
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:40,430
Look.

2757
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:42,010
God damn it.

2758
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:44,990
Okay.

2759
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:52,330
How many more do I have to do here?

2760
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:54,610
I need to find more enders.

2761
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:55,750
Oh wait, there you go.

2762
01:56:55,790 --> 01:56:56,290
We found one.

2763
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:57,690
That's good.

2764
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:01,230
Dude, lost like five shields.

2765
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:02,410
Look, five...

2766
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:03,590
I still lost!

2767
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:05,290
Okay,

2768
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,090
we gotta kill this guy.

2769
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,150
I need him to get closer to me so I can...

2770
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:12,890
Can you look at me?

2771
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:14,610
Oh my god, please.

2772
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:17,370
Nice.

2773
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:20,170
Okay, that is...

2774
01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:21,530
How much more do I need?

2775
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:24,390
Oh, he doesn't say.

2776
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:27,070
Wait, where?

2777
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:27,850
Oh, this guy!

2778
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:32,230
Okay, I need a...

2779
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:34,770
How do I look up my objectives?

2780
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:36,290
How do I look up my objectives?

2781
01:57:36,370 --> 01:57:36,730
Uh...

2782
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:42,590
Wait, does it tell you how to look up my objectives?

2783
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:43,170
Wait, does it tell you how to look up my objectives?

2784
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:44,350
I don't know, actually.

2785
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:44,970
I don't know, actually.

2786
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:47,690
Oh my god, I almost have...

2787
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:48,910
Is it open the map?

2788
01:57:49,190 --> 01:57:49,450
Oh!

2789
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:49,650
Oh!

2790
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:53,810
Okay, I need some machine guns.

2791
01:57:53,950 --> 01:57:54,670
Okay, this one.

2792
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:56,190
I need to use this one then.

2793
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:57,690
Oh my god, I got the...

2794
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:58,870
See, I told you guys!

2795
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:00,010
I can use the ability!

2796
01:58:01,150 --> 01:58:01,590
Nice.

2797
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:05,090
Okay, we did it.

2798
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:05,830
We used one.

2799
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:10,350
Okay, and then we need...

2800
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:12,190
We need one more green barrel.

2801
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:14,130
And then we need...

2802
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:16,930
To use our thingy two more times.

2803
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:17,930
And then we should be good.

2804
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:19,210
Okay.

2805
01:58:21,130 --> 01:58:21,670
Oh, hey!

2806
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:24,550
Hey, are you friendly?

2807
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:27,390
Hey!

2808
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:31,610
Is that...

2809
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:35,130
Is that a robot husband you got there?

2810
01:58:35,530 --> 01:58:36,310
Oh, hey there!

2811
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:39,490
Wait, is this a bandit?

2812
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:40,590
Why is there a bandit here?

2813
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:45,010
Like, why is there a bandit?

2814
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:46,230
Why is there two bandits?

2815
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:47,850
What have you been doing?

2816
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:52,930
Why did you bring two bandits here?

2817
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:56,070
Okay.

2818
01:58:57,510 --> 01:59:00,490
Okay, that one guy brought like two fucking bandits here.

2819
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:01,590
It's crazy.

2820
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:03,830
I hate your hat.

2821
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:04,990
He ignored it.

2822
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:06,690
He literally brought all of them here.

2823
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:07,670
Hey there.

2824
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:08,930
Hey.

2825
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:15,510
He doesn't know.

2826
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:17,830
He didn't know he got hit.

2827
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:22,650
He didn't know.

2828
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,910
He didn't know.

2829
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:26,330
He didn't...

2830
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:28,250
Oh no, where is he coming?

2831
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:30,410
He didn't know.

2832
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:32,710
He actually...

2833
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:38,970
He actually didn't notice at all.

2834
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:40,410
They might attack.

2835
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:41,530
They might not.

2836
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:42,970
Commencing analysis.

2837
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:44,210
Hey.

2838
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:45,430
Are you friendly?

2839
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:49,250
I'm sorry.

2840
01:59:49,490 --> 01:59:50,250
Hey.

2841
01:59:51,930 --> 01:59:53,610
Oh god, die!

2842
01:59:53,910 --> 01:59:54,410
Oh shit!

2843
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:58,070
Oh my god, he's so friendly!

2844
01:59:58,590 --> 01:59:59,950
He's so...

2845
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:01,630
He's taking...

2846
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:02,390
Guys!

2847
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:05,470
Oh my god, he's so funny!

2848
02:00:06,710 --> 02:00:07,650
Oh my shit!

2849
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:10,950
That's so funny!

2850
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:11,430
Please!

2851
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:13,650
Oh please!

2852
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:15,870
Please, I just want to...

2853
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:16,710
Please, I...

2854
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,510
Please!

2855
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,710
My robot!

2856
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:32,410
My robot!

2857
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:33,090
Please!

2858
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:34,130
Please!

2859
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:35,810
Please!

2860
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:38,110
Please!

2861
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:38,510
Please!

2862
02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:41,190
Commencing replay.

2863
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:46,490
We've not been able to destroy this location.

2864
02:00:46,650 --> 02:00:47,210
We've not been able to destroy this location.

2865
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:48,630
We engaged in battle and defeated the enemy.

2866
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:48,950
I knew!

2867
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:53,510
Please, I just want to give her a bathroom!

2868
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:55,270
I knew!

2869
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:57,670
Please, my wife needs a bathroom!

2870
02:00:57,930 --> 02:00:58,310
Please, my wife needs a bathroom!

2871
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,430
Please!

2872
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,950
Please!

2873
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:05,790
He needs a bathroom!

2874
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:07,330
He needs a bathroom, guys!

2875
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:07,650
He needs a bathroom, guys!

2876
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:12,130
I thought...

2877
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,550
He shot me first!

2878
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:15,610
I thought I was gonna die regardless!

2879
02:01:16,830 --> 02:01:17,330
I thought I was gonna die regardless!

2880
02:01:17,490 --> 02:01:17,570
I thought I was gonna die regardless!

2881
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:22,050
We encountered bandits at this location.

2882
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:23,110
Oh my god...

2883
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:26,390
I thought I...

2884
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:26,970
I thought I...

2885
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:28,230
I already was like 30 HP!

2886
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:31,010
There was nothing I could do!

2887
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:33,890
I was already 30 HP!

2888
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:35,190
I was already 30 HP!

2889
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:38,190
Anton, thank you for the super chat!

2890
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:39,450
Thank you, thank you!

2891
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:41,070
I bailed out.

2892
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:43,070
I don't know what bailing out would do.

2893
02:01:43,410 --> 02:01:43,890
Honestly.

2894
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:47,630
Like, do I just lose everything?

2895
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:51,070
As for things lost, here's a readout.

2896
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:52,710
Nooooooo!

2897
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:54,270
Please, I read a lesson.

2898
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:55,610
No need to feel down.

2899
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:57,550
Use this as a springboard...

2900
02:01:57,550 --> 02:01:59,150
No need to feel down?!

2901
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:00,930
Look at all the items I lost!

2902
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:04,110
And now, let's take a look at...

2903
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:05,990
What do you mean, no need?

2904
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:06,750
I... God!

2905
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:07,830
I was so close!

2906
02:02:13,110 --> 02:02:14,070
Our bathroom...

2907
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:15,390
Our fucking... Please!

2908
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:17,030
I just want the bathroom!

2909
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:19,010
Please, guys!

2910
02:02:19,670 --> 02:02:20,830
I just...

2911
02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:24,290
You will lose all the items you're carrying.

2912
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:25,790
The items that you wish to keep.

2913
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:29,810
Be sure to put them in your safe pocket to keep them protected.

2914
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:33,310
Even if you lose all your equipment, you can pick up starter arms for free.

2915
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:37,910
If you want to get used to life as a drifter, it's probably best you only take starter equipment.

2916
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:39,830
Oh my god.

2917
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:41,930
Oh my god.

2918
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:44,430
Oh my god.

2919
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:46,590
I'm broke.

2920
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:48,730
I hate this.

2921
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:50,910
Wait, what?

2922
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,370
Do I just need the...

2923
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:54,850
Nooo!

2924
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:57,390
I don't have the assault rifle!

2925
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:03,480
I did!

2926
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,100
I did pay 135!

2927
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:08,240
I did pay 135!

2928
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:10,200
Wait, what do I need?

2929
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:14,460
No, I didn't finish the fucking assault machine gun!

2930
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:16,480
I only had to buy this stupid fucking...

2931
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,560
And I can't afford it!

2932
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,120
I can't...

2933
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:24,580
I can't afford it.

2934
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:27,000
I literally just needed two more.

2935
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,340
I needed two more kills!

2936
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,220
I can't afford it!

2937
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,220
I can't afford it!

2938
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,880
I am...

2939
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:35,460
I am...

2940
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:37,700
so broke.

2941
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,660
Please!

2942
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:41,400
I just wanted to give her...

2943
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,700
I just wanted to give her a fucking bathroom!

2944
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:47,700
Okay.

2945
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:50,100
I swear if I die again, we're just GG's.

2946
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,560
I swear.

2947
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:54,540
Okay.

2948
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,720
Okay.

2949
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:00,020
Okay.

2950
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:00,920
I'm okay.

2951
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:02,860
I'm okay.

2952
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:04,600
I'm okay.

2953
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,460
I don't need...

2954
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:10,020
I did!

2955
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:12,600
I even paid 135 dollars!

2956
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:14,120
I...

2957
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:15,140
I...

2958
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:21,600
I even paid 135 dollars!

2959
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:22,780
I even paid 135 dollars!

2960
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:23,900
I can't believe it!

2961
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,260
I can't believe it!

2962
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:27,520
Don't worry.

2963
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:28,860
Oh my god.

2964
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,180
I can't believe it.

2965
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:34,640
I can't believe it.

2966
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:37,120
I have to fucking find two more barrels!

2967
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,260
Okay.

2968
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:42,940
I don't have enough for the fucking...

2969
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,000
Okay.

2970
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:46,900

02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,260
I hope you get fucking...

2975
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,360
Whoever killed me...

2976
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:59,920
I hope you get bounty hunted by the rank one guy.

2977
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:01,980
Hey.

2978
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:03,220
Oh he seems friendly.

2979
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:04,720
Hey.

2980
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,180
Okay.

2981
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:06,960
Nice.

2982
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:07,300
Okay.

2983
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:08,320
He's friendly.

2984
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:08,760
Okay.

2985
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:09,240
Thank god.

02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:11,540
Thank... Thank fucking god.

2987
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:12,600
Alright.

2988
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:14,260
Okay.

2989
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,480
We just gotta...

2990
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:17,220
Wait.

2991
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:17,700
AO Crystal?

2992
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:18,880
Okay.

2993
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:19,700
We'll get the crystal.

2994
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,620
We might as well.

2995
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:21,640
We need the crystal.

2996
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:25,240
We need a fusion compound and the ore shit.

2997
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,480
Wow.

2998
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:30,320
If only I have the machine gun for this.

2999
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,820
If only I have the machine gun.

3000
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:36,280
No!

3001
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:37,140
What?!

3002
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,700
You're not dead?!

3003
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:40,760
Oh wait.

3004
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:41,560
This is a shotgun.

3005
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:42,960
Wait.

3006
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,420
This is good.

3007
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,500
Okay.

3008
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:48,940
Nice.

3009
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:49,340
Alright.

3010
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:50,980
Alright.

3011
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:53,340
This is our first time getting the shotgun.

3012
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:57,900
I mean, shotgun is pretty good.

3013
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:58,380
Yeah!

3014
02:05:58,480 --> 02:05:59,060
Oh my god.

3015
02:05:59,080 --> 02:05:59,540
That shit is...

3016
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:01,280
That shit is a lot of damage.

3017
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:02,440
Okay.

3018
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,480
We got a crystal though.

3019
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,720
We got a crystal.

3020
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:08,380
Oh.

3021
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:08,880

02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:10,240
Guys.

3024
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:11,080
We don't need a heal.

3025
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:11,400
Guys.

3026
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:12,600
We don't need a heal.

3027
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:13,580
We have...

3028
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:16,160
We'll be fine.

3029
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,360
We'll be fine.

3030
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:19,160
We need to use our abilities.

3031
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:19,680
Guys.

3032
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:21,500
Okay.

3033
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,900
Maybe if I can get up here.

3034
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:25,480
Okay.

3035
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:28,000
I wanna get... They must have like good loot over here.

3036
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,300
As long as there's nobody here to kill me, we'll be fine.

3037
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:33,680
Or get up there.

3038
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:35,780
Or get up there.

3039
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:39,040
Guys.

3040
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:39,900
Combat unlikely.

3041
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:41,240
Guys.

3042
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:42,020
Guys.

3043
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:42,660
We'll be fine.

3044
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,600
There's no way it happens twice in a row.

3045
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:46,980
Guys.

3046
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:48,520

Okay.

3052
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,300
It has to be material.

3053
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,680
I'm so broke.

3054
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:56,020
Guys.

3055
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:56,360

I need money.

3057
02:06:58,640 --> 02:06:59,860

3062
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:09,840
Oh my god.

3063
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:10,320
None of this.

3064
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,680
I don't need any of this.

3065
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,500
I don't need any of this.

3066
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:15,600
I need the fusion core and the iron ore.

3067
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:17,440
And I need green barrels.

3068
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:22,260
Oh my god.

3069
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:23,400

02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,420
I need green barrels.

3074
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:34,100
Where am I?

3075
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,620

02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,460
Where are the green barrels?

3077
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,800
Where are the barrels?

3078
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:45,540
Oh.

3079
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,160
Repair kit.

3080
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:48,240
Oh.

3081
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,120

Okay.

3085
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:51,620
There's loot here.

3086
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:53,160
Yeah.

3087
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:55,840
But she... Do you see that green bar at the bottom?

3088
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:00,300
We have to wait until that is like uh... full before I can use it.

3089
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:00,820
Which sucks.

3090
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:03,060
Please.

3091
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:04,500

02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:07,020
Please stop taking all the green barrels.

3095
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:07,500
Please.

3096
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,520
I need to finish this one quest.

3097
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:11,280
I've been holed isolated.

3098
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:14,380
Please stop taking all the green barrels.

3099
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:14,920
Guys.

3100
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:17,300
That's all I asked for.

3101
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:24,040
This is the hardest fucking material to find in this world.

3102
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:25,260
Like I...

3103
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:26,680
It's not even the crystal.

3104
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:29,100
It's literally the green fucking barrel.

3105
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,640
Oh my god.

3106
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:35,660
Oh.

3107
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:36,540
That's a lot of chasers.

3108
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:41,840
If only I had the gun to do this.

3109
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:45,480
But I guess not.

3110
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:46,300
Guys.

3111
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:47,300
Is there any green barrels?

3112
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:51,280
Are there any dragoons that won't kill me that has green barrels?

3113
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:51,600

3114
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:54,480
I've been on three different missions out here.

3115
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,900
I've been on three different missions.

3116
02:08:59,200 --> 02:08:59,760
Okay.

3117
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:02,640
Okay.

3118
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:04,660
Bandit boss?

3119
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:07,040
What do you mean bandit boss?

3120
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,020

3121
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:12,000
Please.

3122
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:13,980

3123
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:14,880
Please.

3124
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:15,760
I can't.

3125
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,480
I can't deal with any of this.

3126
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:21,600
Association member?

3127
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,320
There's a barrel?

3128
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:27,640
There's a fucking...

3129
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:29,120
Oh.

3130
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:30,000
Oh.

3131
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:30,960
Is that green barrel?

3132
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,000
Oh my god.

3133
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,340
We fucking did it.

3134
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:35,880
We fucking did it.

3135
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,740
We found a green barrel.

3136
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:38,700
Holy shit.

3137
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,220
We found...

3138
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:41,800
We found Narnia.

3139
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,120
We found Narnia.

3140
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:45,180
Oh my god.

3141
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:46,900
We did it.

3142
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:51,300
Oh my god.

3143
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:52,260
There's another one.

3144
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:53,700
Oh my god.

3145
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,560
It's my birthday.

3146
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:57,540
Holy shit.

3147
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:00,380
It's my fucking birthday.

3148
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,840
That should be it, right?

3149
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:03,640
I got three.

3150
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,300
How's... How am I missing one more?

3151
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:10,580
Wait.

3152
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:11,460
It wasn't...

3153
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,340
Oh my god.

3154
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:13,780
I'm missing one more.

3155
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,240
I need one more green barrel.

3156
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:18,320
Hold.

3157
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:19,740
What's that?

3158
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,520
Oh, okay.

3159
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:21,180
That's the...

3160
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:22,960
Okay.

3161
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:23,300
Wow.

3162
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:27,220
If only I have... If only I have the gun for this guy.

3163
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:28,040
If only.

3164
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:31,120
If only I have the right gun.

3165
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:36,320
Oh my god.

3166
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:36,820
Please.

3167
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:40,140
Please.

3168
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:42,340
I don't need any of this.

3169
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:46,500
I need another green barrel.

3170
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:51,420
Where the fuck?

3171
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,360
Please.

3172
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:55,660
Where's the last barrel?

3173
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,060
Where the fuck is it?

3174
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,360
Where the fuck is it?

3175
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:01,180
Hey.

3176
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:06,100
Hey.

3177
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:06,140
Hey.

3178
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:09,860
We're friendly?

3179
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:11,740
Oh, thank god.

3180
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:14,120
Oh, thank god.

3181
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:15,700
I'm so happy.

3182
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:20,400
Oh, thank god.

3183
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:23,280
I can't deal with this right now.

3184
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:25,700
Oh my god.

3185
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:25,920
What's that?

3186
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:26,100
No.

3187
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:26,960
That's just the exit.

3188
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:28,200
God damn it.

3189
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:31,620
Oh, wait.

3190
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:32,980
This guy has fusion core.

3191
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:34,400
Wait.

3192
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:34,960
I need this.

3193
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,060
This guy has fusion core.

3194
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:37,920
Nice.

3195
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:40,840
Okay.

3196
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:41,360
That's... Yeah.

3197
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:41,500
Yeah.

3198
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:42,340
I need like a core.

3199
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:45,840
Oh my god.

3200
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,140
Just one more.

3201
02:11:47,780 --> 02:11:51,580
I... I... I literally need just one more.

3202
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,480
Hit confirmed.

3203
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:54,880
Hit confirmed.

3204
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:56,220
Please.

3205
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,300
Please.

3206
02:11:58,520 --> 02:11:59,840
I need one more.

3207
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:02,200
You can't do this to me.

3208
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,080
Why is this like the hardest thing to find?

3209
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,540
Why is it... Wait.

3210
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:11,120
Is that blue equals... No.

3211
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:12,220
That's just... No.

3212
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:14,560
You mean my map shows it.

3213
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:17,260
It just shows like enemy.

3214
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:19,140
No, it doesn't.

3215
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,600
Are you lying?

3216
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:22,760
Wait.

3217
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:24,540
Where does it say it?

3218
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,240
Where does that... Where?

3219
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:32,740
No.

3220
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:35,260
We're not coming back with... I swear to god.

3221
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:36,380
We're gonna find...

3222
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:37,920
Guys.

3223
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,240
No.

3224
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:40,240
These are... I can't do these objectives.

3225
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:40,760
Wait.

3226
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:41,520
There it is.

3227
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:42,560
Oh my god.

3228
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:43,480
The last one.

3229
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:45,500
There it is.

3230
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,500
Oh my god.

3231
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,180
This is it.

3232
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:50,020
This is the promised land.

3233
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,460
Oh my god.

3234
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,040
We fucking...

3235
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,000
found the promised land.

3236
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:57,180
Holy shit.

3237
02:12:57,240 --> 02:12:59,740
And then there's... There's a mud stone.

3238
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:00,680
Oh my god.

3239
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:01,400
And there's...

3240
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:03,000
Oh my god.

3241
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:03,860
Look at all these rewards.

3242
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:06,620
Oh.

3243
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:09,200
Why does it rain when it rains?

3244
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,240
Makes me so sad.

3245
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:13,960
Okay.

3246
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:14,460
We gotta leave.

3247
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,500
We gotta leave.

3248
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:18,300
The promised land.

3249
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:18,740
Okay.

3250
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:19,580
Where is the closest?

3251
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:20,840
This is the closest.

3252
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:22,060
Okay.

3253
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,120
Oh my god.

3254
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:25,860
This is it.

3255
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:28,440
We just gotta go home.

3256
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:31,380
We finally got our barrels.

3257
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,760
It took 20 years.

3258
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:38,100
We just need to heal one last time and we're fucking free.

3259
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:42,840
Where?

3260
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:44,960
Where?

3261
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:47,380
I can't jump.

3262
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:48,200
I'm overheated.

3263
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,500
Okay.

3264
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:51,520
How do I get there?

3265
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:51,800
Okay.

3266
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:52,280
It's right here.

3267
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:53,720
Okay.

3268
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:54,960
We're so close.

3269
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:56,740
We're so close to freedom.

3270
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:59,320
The bath is within the reach.

3271
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:00,560
The bathroom.

3272
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:03,560
Please.

3273
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:05,580
Please.

3274
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:05,880
Why?

3275
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:06,200
Okay.

3276
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:08,160
Alright.

3277
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:11,040
We're okay.

3278
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:12,900
Oh my god.

3279
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:13,980
It took 20 years.

3280
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:16,980
The fable bathroom is so close, guys.

3281
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:18,780
It's almost there.

3282
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:21,480
I can taste it.

3283
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:28,660
I just need to buy the stupid submachine gun again.

3284
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,120
And then we can have the bathroom.

3285
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,940
It's worth it.

3286
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:35,160
It's gonna be worth it.

3287
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:37,500
It's gonna be so worth it.

3288
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:41,460
Oh the ability.

3289
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:42,220
The ability right.

3290
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:44,220
Alright.

3291
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:44,840
We did it.

3292
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:45,280
Now we...

3293
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:46,000
Thank god.

3294
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:46,380
Okay.

3295
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:47,720
We fucking actually did it.

3296
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,320
I almost forgot the one other ability.

3297
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,220
I didn't want to do that again.

3298
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:52,120
Okay.

3299
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:57,080
And then we gotta craft the stupid barrel sh...

3300
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:57,860
I swear to god.

3301
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:58,880
Somebody shoots me.

3302
02:14:58,940 --> 02:14:59,280
I swear.

3303
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,980
If anybody comes near me, I'm gonna shoot them.

3304
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:02,380
I swear to god.

3305
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:03,520
I swear to god.

3306
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:05,480
If you come near, I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

3307
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:06,580
I swear to god.

3308
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:08,600
I swear to god.

3309
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,280
I swear to god.

3310
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:13,060
I can't do this again.

3311
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:13,880
I...

3312
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:18,520
I can't do this stupid barrel search again.

3313
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:19,400
I...

3314
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:23,880
Alright.

3315
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,380
I had my shotgun out.

3316
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:25,980
I was ready.

3317
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,000
I was fucking ready.

3318
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:29,580
Alright.

3319
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:30,020
Nice.

3320
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:32,240
Alright.

3321
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:38,580
That's me trying to find this stupid fucking green barrel.

3322
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:39,820
Oh my god!

3323
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:40,700
How far was I?

3324
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:42,780
No.

3325
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:43,640
What the fuck?

3326
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:45,640
How did I travel that far?

3327
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:49,580
It always surprises me how far I traveled in general.

3328
02:15:50,420 --> 02:15:52,880
Let's start by reviewing your AO crystal home.

3329
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,500
Let's cash out...

3330
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:55,520
Zero.

3331
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:59,540
I was gonna say, did I actually have like, okay, $800?

3332
02:15:59,740 --> 02:16:00,300
That's fine.

3333
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:01,520
I'm fine with that.

3334
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,400
I'm fine with that.

3335
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:04,420
I have rare materials.

3336
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:05,820
That's fine.

3337
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:07,040
Now let's take a look at the...

3338
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:08,200
Oh thank god.

3339
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,660
You've completed a request.

3340
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:10,660
Oh thank you.

3341
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,400
Thank you robot waifu.

3342
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:15,840
Oh my god.

3343
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:16,320
It's okay.

3344
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:16,900
It's okay.

3345
02:16:16,940 --> 02:16:18,340
The quest will give me money.

3346
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:18,900
Guys.

3347
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:19,560
It's okay.

3348
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:22,520
The quest will give me money and I should be able to afford it.

3349
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,980
Looks like you've got the hang of going on expeditions.

3350
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:27,200
Now here's what you do with the spoils.

3351
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:30,620
Okay.

3352
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:32,740
Time for a lesson about cradle equipment.

3353
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,680
Hope you brought back some AO crystals from your latest sorting.

3354
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:41,540
You can use those mountains of cash to buy some strong equipment.

3355
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:45,580
Equipment here is sorted by grade.

3356
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:48,600
Good weapons are strong.

3357
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,640
Good cradles have fancy features.

3358
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,160
As he looks very fancy.

3359
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,920
So go on and grab some equipment first.

3360
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:04,200
I used to have good equipment.

3361
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:09,020
I used to have good equipment guys.

3362
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:13,380
Thank you.

3363
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:17,040
Thank you.

3364
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,060
You're such a dear.

3365
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:19,140
Thank you.

3366
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:21,780
Did he just give me a t-shirt?

3367
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:26,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

3368
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:30,580
Are you fucking...

3369
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:34,580
Okay.

3370
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,120
That gives me 5000.

3371
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:37,720
Okay.

3372
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:38,680
That's a lot better.

3373
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,300
It's gonna be like...

3374
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:41,320
There's no way.

3375
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:45,020
There's no fucking way that all I got was a t-shirt.

3376
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:46,240
There's no way.

3377
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:50,300
There's no fucking way after all that work I did.

3378
02:17:50,540 --> 02:17:53,320
I just got a fucking t-shirt.

3379
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:55,700
I couldn't believe it.

3380
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:57,300
14 minutes?

3381
02:17:58,260 --> 02:17:58,840
Okay.

3382
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:05,860
Okay.

3383
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:06,220
Let's...

3384
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:06,840
Let's...

3385
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:10,060
Okay.

3386
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:17,010
It's fine.

3387
02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:19,250
I'm okay.

3388
02:18:19,890 --> 02:18:21,430
I got the...

3389
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:22,430
Okay.

3390
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:24,610
That's funny.

3391
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:26,110
That t-shirt is...

3392
02:18:26,110 --> 02:18:26,770
Yeah.

3393
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:30,270
Did I do it?

3394
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,430
Nice.

3395
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:36,150
Oh my.

3396
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,490
That's quite lovely as well.

3397
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:38,770
Shan, you have a favorite outfit.

3398
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:42,010
But you do need to change your pace every once in a while.

3399
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:45,570
You must find new clothes for your beautiful maggots to wear or else.

3400
02:18:46,530 --> 02:18:47,090
Alright.

3401
02:18:47,150 --> 02:18:47,450
Nice.

3402
02:18:47,990 --> 02:18:50,090
A new request has been completed.

3403
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:51,070
Let's fucking go.

3404
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:53,150
Okay.

3405
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:56,590
Upgrade your treasury to level 1 or higher.

3406
02:18:56,830 --> 02:18:58,470
Do I have enough for that?

3407
02:18:58,550 --> 02:18:59,870
Use the EQS.

3408
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:02,330
The following... Are you making...

3409
02:19:02,330 --> 02:19:08,370
Try selecting EQS when you see another cradle on which you will... Oh!

3410
02:19:09,210 --> 02:19:09,650
Okay.

3411
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:10,870
I didn't know you could do that.

3412
02:19:11,270 --> 02:19:12,050
That's interesting.

3413
02:19:12,890 --> 02:19:13,790
Oh my god.

3414
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:14,930
That's $15,000.

3415
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:16,030
Wait!

3416
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:16,750
It's $15...

3417
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:16,910
Wait!

3418
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:17,570
It's worth it!

3419
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:18,970
It's fucking... Okay.

3420
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:19,950
Fuck yeah.

3421
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:20,710
It's worth it.

3422
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:22,390
Guys, I literally get...

3423
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:24,650
I literally get $15,000.

3424
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:26,890
Like, it adds up.

3425
02:19:28,770 --> 02:19:29,210
Okay.

3426
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:29,730
Thank god.

3427
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:30,070
Okay.

3428
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:31,670
It's $15,000.

3429
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:33,470
Like, it makes up for the money.

3430
02:19:33,570 --> 02:19:34,770
Like, I was like...

3431
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:37,110
Thank fucking god.

3432
02:19:37,170 --> 02:19:37,410
Okay.

3433
02:19:37,930 --> 02:19:40,050
10, 8, Of course there's...

3434
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:42,750
Use the treasury?

3435
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:43,610
Oh, my god!

3436
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,170
I still can't fucking upgrade this.

3437
02:19:45,310 --> 02:19:46,730
I still can't...

3438
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:48,490
Can I still... I need...

3439
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:51,910
I need brittle iron ore and a fusion compound.

3440
02:19:52,090 --> 02:19:54,030
How the fuck do I find that?

3441
02:19:54,070 --> 02:19:55,430
Do I put that on my wishlist?

3442
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:59,930
How do I put that on my wishlist?

3443
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:06,570
I thought you could put stuff on your wish...

3444
02:20:06,570 --> 02:20:06,750
Oh!

3445
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:07,270
Here you go.

3446
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:09,750
Unable to... Oh!

3447
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:09,930
There.

3448
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:11,910
Alright, wishlist.

3449
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:12,890
Okay, there we go.

3450
02:20:12,970 --> 02:20:13,810
Now she will...

3451
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:17,190
Now she'll help me find this.

3452
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:18,370
Oh my god, we're so close.

3453
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:18,710
Please.

3454
02:20:19,350 --> 02:20:20,270
We're so close.

3455
02:20:20,410 --> 02:20:22,170
We're actually so close.

3456
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:22,830
Okay, buy.

3457
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:24,490
We gotta buy.

3458
02:20:24,670 --> 02:20:25,630
What do we have to buy again?

3459
02:20:26,370 --> 02:20:29,130
Oh my god, was it the assault rifle?

3460
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:31,790
Was it... Oh, it's zero dollars!

3461
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:34,370
Are you trying to... There's no way.

3462
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:37,150
Wait, there's no way.

3463
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:38,570
Okay.

3464
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:44,670
Oh, submachine gun plus... Okay, submachine gun.

3465
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:45,890
Okay, submachine gun.

3466
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:47,510
Alright.

3467
02:20:49,870 --> 02:20:51,290
It's 4,000!

3468
02:20:51,330 --> 02:20:52,810
Wasn't this 11k before?

3469
02:20:52,830 --> 02:20:53,330
Okay, whatever.

3470
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:54,350
I'm not gonna complain.

3471
02:20:54,570 --> 02:20:57,530
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna complain.

3472
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:03,650
It's 4,000 dollars now and that's... I could have done this mission a long time ago, but that's okay.

3473
02:21:04,090 --> 02:21:05,450
That's... That's okay.

3474
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:07,670
That's... That's okay.

3475
02:21:09,230 --> 02:21:10,170
That's alright.

3476
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:14,570
That's... That's... That's okay.

3477
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:18,990
Babe.

3478
02:21:25,230 --> 02:21:25,890
Let's see.

3479
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:27,570
What else do I need to do?

3480
02:21:27,950 --> 02:21:29,750
Alright, we gotta get the crystals.

3481
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:31,530
We gotta kill two Enders.

3482
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:34,310
We gotta get the EQS.

3483
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:35,890
We gotta get the treasury?

3484
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:38,790
Nice to meet you.

3485
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:41,250
I'm just running for possibly to help.

3486
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:43,310
First, I'll have to check your garage so you have all the necessary.

3487
02:21:43,570 --> 02:21:46,670
Okay, we can't get the treasury because we don't have anything.

3488
02:21:46,830 --> 02:21:47,390
That's fine.

3489
02:21:47,970 --> 02:21:48,750
Okay, repair.

3490
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:49,930
Nice.

3491
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:50,910
Alright, let's go in!

3492
02:21:51,130 --> 02:21:51,910
This is it.

3493
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:53,410
We're so ready.

3494
02:21:54,010 --> 02:21:54,910
This is it.

3495
02:21:56,350 --> 02:21:57,590
Okay, insurance though.

3496
02:21:57,850 --> 02:21:58,330
Insurance.

3497
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:01,570
I've... I've learned my lesson regarding insurance.

3498
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:04,270
I've... I've learned my...

3499
02:22:06,730 --> 02:22:07,630
I forgot.

3500
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:08,670
I forgot to replenish ammo.

3501
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:16,910
I forgot to replenish ammo, guys.

3502
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:17,610
I forgot to replenish ammo, guys.

3503
02:22:21,470 --> 02:22:22,090
Hey...

3504
02:22:24,250 --> 02:22:25,070
Don't worry.

3505
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,950
You have me at your side.

3506
02:22:26,950 --> 02:22:27,210
Hey.

3507
02:22:27,350 --> 02:22:29,310
I forgot to...

3508
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:34,170
I took the wrong ammo, guys.

3509
02:22:35,050 --> 02:22:37,170
I took the wrong ammo.

3510
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:40,030
Okay, 40 bullets in the dream.

3511
02:22:40,510 --> 02:22:43,690
We can kill them in 40 bullets, it's fine.

3512
02:22:44,510 --> 02:22:45,410
It's fine.

3513
02:22:46,850 --> 02:22:49,250
We can do this in 40 bullets.

3514
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:51,190
There's no way.

3515
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:56,010
40 bullets, that's fine.

3516
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:00,870
40 bullets.

3517
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:08,580
We killed one.

3518
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:15,440
We got one.

3519
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:17,400
We got one, guys.

3520
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:19,960
Maybe we'll find bullets!

3521
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:21,020
You don't know that!

3522
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:25,420
We could find bullets in the end!

3523
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:32,100
We could find bullets in the end!

3524
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:34,200
It'll be possible.

3525
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:37,700
We can do this, I believe.

3526
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,680
We're gonna find bullets in the end.

3527
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:42,620
Alright, nice.

3528
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:45,120
We got the crystal, too.

3529
02:23:48,340 --> 02:23:52,160
Alright, Jesus Christ, why does it take you so long to excavate?

3530
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:55,720
It's okay!

3531
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:57,680
We'll find it!

3532
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:00,780
Is that it?

3533
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,260
Oh shit, high purity.

3534
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:05,300
Wow.

3535
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:09,380
Okay, we have two high qualities.

3536
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:11,160
We need to find...

3537
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:15,300
We need to find another guy.

3538
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:17,640
So we have one gun.

3539
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:19,360
Like, what's the worst that could happen?

3540
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,800
We have one gun.

3541
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:23,020
Okay, guys, that's okay.

3542
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:23,920
That's...

3543
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:26,740
Alright, there's another crystal here.

3544
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:28,280
We're gonna do this.

3545
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:30,840
If we kill the bandits, we'll get bullets.

3546
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:32,260
The bandits drop bullets.

3547
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:36,880
Guys, I figured it out.

3548
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:40,240
If I kill the bandits, we'll get bullets, guys.

3549
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:42,540
Guys, I'm so smart.

3550
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:44,520
Okay, how do I get up there?

3551
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:47,640
It's fine.

3552
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:52,940
Guys, we'll just kill the bandits!

3553
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,400
Guys, we'll just kill the bandits!

3554
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:56,340
They can't kill me!

3555
02:24:57,780 --> 02:24:58,780
There's no way!

3556
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,360
I've been gaming for so long for my anime wife!

3557
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,540
Please.

3558
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:06,420
Guys, it'll be so worth it.

3559
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:09,200
Guys, I swear to God, it'll be so worth it.

3560
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:14,540
I swear to God.

3561
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:17,940
How the fuck do I get there?

3562
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:23,260
Okay, it has to be, like, somewhere here.

3563
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:25,100
Where is it?

3564
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:27,500
Oh, is that it?

3565
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,380
Why is it a target?

3566
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:31,460
Oh, it's right here.

3567
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:31,860
Okay.

3568
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:33,940
What's that target over there?

3569
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:34,560
Is that the ore?

3570
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:41,740
Where I'm going, I'm trying to get the fucking pure crystal.

3571
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:43,700
Wait, why is there a heart here?

3572
02:25:43,780 --> 02:25:44,820
Oh, it's the iron ore!

3573
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:45,460
Oh, thank God.

3574
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:47,320
Oh, thank God.

3575
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:47,600
Okay.

3576
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:49,860
That was on our wish list.

3577
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:50,880
We got our brittle ore.

3578
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:53,380
Okay, we need, like...

3579
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:55,880
We got brittle ore complete.

3580
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,340
Oh, thank God.

3581
02:25:57,380 --> 02:25:58,580
We got the brittle ore shit.

3582
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,160
Okay, we got...

3583
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:05,220
There has to be another bandit somewhere.

3584
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:07,920
There has to be bandits somewhere!

3585
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:12,640
Alright.

3586
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:14,840
Where?

3587
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,540
Wait, where, where, where?

3588
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:19,280
I need to look at him.

3589
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:20,280
Where?

3590
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:21,760
Where is he?

3591
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:23,960
Where, where is he?

3592
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:24,960
Oh, my God.

3593
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:25,340
No!

3594
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:26,060
Stop!

3595
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:27,780
Stop!

3596
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:29,220
I need you to stop!

3597
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:30,400
Please!

3598
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:33,260
Please, I need you to stop!

3599
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:36,120
No!

3600
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:36,880
He left!

3601
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:39,180
I can't believe he left.

3602
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:42,620
I can't believe he fucking left.

3603
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:43,660
I need him here.

3604
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,040
Where?

3605
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:48,120
Where?

3606
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,500
Oh, that's not... Where?

3607
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:49,840
Where?

3608
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:51,780
Who's looking at me?

3609
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:54,220
Where?

3610
02:26:56,460 --> 02:26:57,580
I literally...

3611
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:58,440
Where?

3612
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:02,780
Someone's watching me, but I don't know.

3613
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:06,600
Okay, we need... Oh, my God.

3614
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:07,800
We literally need one more.

3615
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:08,620
No!

3616
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:09,960
They took the crystal!

3617
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:12,000
Okay.

3618
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:14,200
This is quite the rare item.

3619
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:14,480
What?

3620
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:17,260
She literally said there's someone next to me.

3621
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,660
But where?

3622
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:21,920
Make a skill prime and ready to go.

3623
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:22,520
Oh, it's over there.

3624
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:22,820
Okay.

3625
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,260
I can make this.

3626
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:25,580
Woo!

3627
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:27,220
Okay, nice.

3628
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:28,900
Oh, thank God.

3629
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:29,440
There's...

3630
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:31,780
I detect the faint sound of an engine somewhere.

3631
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:33,520
Where?

3632
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:34,040
Please!

3633
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,160
Where are you?

3634
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:37,280
It's part of my mission to look at you.

3635
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,180
Please let me look at you.

3636
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,600
That's all I asked for.

3637
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:46,540
Okay, I need to watch this.

3638
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:48,420
There we go.

3639
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:48,660
See?

3640
02:27:48,820 --> 02:27:49,580
No fall damage.

3641
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:51,880
Okay, excavate.

3642
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:56,420
Oh, my God.

3643
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,940
Am I being stalked right now?

3644
02:27:58,060 --> 02:28:00,420
Am I fucking being stalked right now, guys?

3645
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:01,800
Is that... Is that it?

3646
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:03,660
Is that it?

3647
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:07,200
Okay, please.

3648
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:10,180
I literally need one person, guys.

3649
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:12,320
I need one of you guys.

3650
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:15,700
Oh, low purity AOE crystal.

3651
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,000
Oh, no.

3652
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:19,940
I already have that.

3653
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,080
Is there any, like, wish list?

3654
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:22,760
AOE crystal.

3655
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:24,540
What do I need?

3656
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:26,580
I need, like, core, right?

3657
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:27,460
The fusion core.

3658
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:29,880
Oh, my God, guys.

3659
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:30,980
I swear to God.

3660
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:33,740
I swear to God.

3661
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:34,380
I need...

3662
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:35,260
Please.

3663
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:42,760
I need one person to, like, exist in my lobby.

3664
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:45,200
Like, that's really... That's all I need.

3665
02:28:46,060 --> 02:28:46,840
There's abandon!

3666
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:47,340
Yes!

3667
02:28:47,580 --> 02:28:48,120
Oh, wait.

3668
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:48,540
There's lose.

3669
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:53,000
Okay.

3670
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:55,580
We're fine.

3671
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,060
We're okay.

3672
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:58,460
Heal.

3673
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:02,240
Is that it?

3674
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:03,800
Did I get... No, I didn't get bullets.

3675
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:04,420
Okay.

3676
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:05,720
Alright.

3677
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:07,920
As soon as it stops raining, guys.

3678
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:11,960
As soon as it stops raining, we'll be fine.

3679
02:29:12,460 --> 02:29:13,540
We'll be fine.

3680
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,940
How do I...

3681
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:18,400
Okay.

3682
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:19,860
It's fine.

3683
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:21,680
We're just safe in our little hut.

3684
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:22,320
Wait.

3685
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:23,480
I'm still taking damage.

3686
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:25,920
Keep your wits about you.

3687
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,060
Please.

3688
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:27,520
I just...

3689
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:29,480
Please.

3690
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:30,660
I just need a...

3691
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,260
I need to kill this one abandon.

3692
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:34,520
He must have light ammo.

3693
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:36,160
Please.

3694
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:38,980
Please.

3695
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:40,120
I just...

3696
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:42,860
I didn't look at one person.

3697
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,580
Where are all the people in my life?

3698
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:47,920
I just need to look at one person.

3699
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:53,520
There has to be one person somewhere.

3700
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:56,640
Did he kill the abandon?

3701
02:29:59,960 --> 02:30:00,480
Please.

3702
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:01,700
Where is that one person?

3703
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:02,580
Where is he?

3704
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:06,480
Oh, my God.

3705
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:07,780
I swear to God.

3706
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:09,240
I swear to God.

3707
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:12,720
The things I do for my fucking hot anime robot wife.

3708
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:18,460
Why is there rain?

3709
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,960
Have you ever heard of acid rain?

3710
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:23,820
Yeah, apparently this rain is so fucking acidic that it burns my armor.

3711
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:26,220
So I'm just chilling here.

3712
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:31,680
You can't, like, look up in the sky and just go, ahh.

3713
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:32,880
Precipitation levels decreasing.

3714
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:35,040
Oh, my God.

3715
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,300
Someone saved the environment.

3716
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:40,260
I detect the faint sound of an engine somewhere.

3717
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:41,440
There's an engine somewhere.

3718
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:42,560
AO Search.

3719
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:44,100
AO Crystal detected.

3720
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:46,540
Expect little in terms of size.

3721
02:30:46,760 --> 02:30:47,620
Oh, my God.

3722
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:48,880
I hear him.

3723
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:50,660
Why are you outside?

3724
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:53,140
AO Search.

3725
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,720
AO Crystal detected.

3726
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,060
Expect little in terms of size.

3727
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:57,920
No!

3728
02:30:58,460 --> 02:31:00,920
It's still raining and thundering!

3729
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,940
Oh, thank God.

3730
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,260
There.

3731
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:05,240
It should be over now.

3732
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,920
It should be fucking over now.

3733
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:08,700
But it's gotten better.

3734
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:09,840
Okay.

3735
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,180
What the fuck is that sound?

3736
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:16,840
It's locked.

3737
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:19,280
And without a code, there's no getting in.

3738
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:20,140
Wait.

3739
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:21,300
Oh, Blue Barrel.

3740
02:31:21,580 --> 02:31:23,840
Why is there so many dead people here?

3741
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:25,160
What is this?

3742
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:26,220
C-Grade?

3743
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:30,860
Should I keep anything here?

3744
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:33,560
Wait, that's pretty good.

3745
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:37,780
No, I've overloaded.

3746
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:40,280
Did somebody die here?

3747
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:43,500
Like, why is there such good loot here?

3748
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:48,560
Are people killing people?

3749
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,560
I should leave.

3750
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:50,660
I should leave.

3751
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:52,480
I'm way over my head here.

3752
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:54,280
I should leave.

3753
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:55,360
I...

3754
02:31:58,280 --> 02:32:00,280
Wait, the elevator is closed!

3755
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:03,580
Oh, my God!

3756
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:05,440
Okay, we should leave.

3757
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:06,700
We should...

3758
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:09,000
We should leave.

3759
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:09,460
I...

3760
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:12,660
I realized, like...

3761
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:15,240
I realized these are dead people.

3762
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:16,060
Yeah.

3763
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:20,960
I realized...

3764
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,480
I realized those are...

3765
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:23,880
other dead...

3766
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:24,440
Oh!

3767
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:27,960
Okay.

3768
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:29,220
Okay.

3769
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:30,420
Okay.

3770
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:31,620
Okay.

3771
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:33,140
We've got contact from another Drifter.

3772
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:35,440
This one's in good standing with the Association.

3773
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:35,900
Did I do it?

3774
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:38,240
Cargo details coming up.

3775
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:39,120
Did I do it?

3776
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:40,860
No!

3777
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:41,560
Get over here!

3778
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:42,140
Wait!

3779
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:42,760
Get over here!

3780
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:44,120
I didn't do these twice correctly!

3781
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:45,340
I didn't...

3782
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:46,460
I didn't do these twice!

3783
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:47,060
Come over here!

3784
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,480
Come back!

3785
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:50,380
This package was left behind by another Drifter.

3786
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:51,960
Come back!

3787
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:52,900
I didn't do these twice!

3788
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:53,840
Come back!

3789
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:55,460
Come back!

3790
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:57,900
Come back here!

3791
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:00,560
Come back here!

3792
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:01,040
Come back here!

3793
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:01,380
Come back here!

3794
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:01,540
Come back here!

3795
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:02,000
I didn't...

3796
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:04,740
Please, I'm not stalking you.

3797
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:05,520
I just...

3798
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,820
Okay, okay.

3799
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:07,520
I did it.

3800
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:08,220
I did it.

3801
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:10,520
I did it correctly.

3802
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:11,760
Okay.

3803
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:13,920
I did it correctly, guys.

3804
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:15,000
I...

3805
02:33:17,380 --> 02:33:20,460
It's gonna be like, why is she chasing after me?

3806
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:24,880
Please, I didn't do it correctly.

3807
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:25,720
I'm sorry.

3808
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:30,260
Okay, we're okay.

3809
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:30,740
We're okay.

3810
02:33:32,860 --> 02:33:33,780
We're okay.

3811
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:35,820
We can drive back now.

3812
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:38,600
Guys, I wasn't stalking him!

3813
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:40,700
I needed to do my one mission!

3814
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:43,580
Okay.

3815
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,940
Okay, that's fine.

3816
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:48,740
We don't need to do that one mission.

3817
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:51,620
I'm trying my best!

3818
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:53,320
I'm just super slow!

3819
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:55,040
I...

3820
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:55,460
I...

3821
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:57,180
You think I don't wanna leave?

3822
02:33:59,140 --> 02:33:59,740
Like...

3823
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:01,380
I'm just so slow.

3824
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:01,520
I...

3825
02:34:01,540 --> 02:34:01,620
No!

3826
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:02,760
I have too much loot!

3827
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:07,180
All right.

3828
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:07,620
Nice.

3829
02:34:08,620 --> 02:34:10,000
Oh, thank God.

3830
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:18,900
Oh, God.

3831
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:19,680
Okay, nice.

3832
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:23,100
I swear to God.

3833
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:23,580
Please.

3834
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:24,680
Please.

3835
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:25,700
We're okay, right?

3836
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:26,560
We're...

3837
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:28,160
Oh, thank God.

3838
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,360
Oh, thank God.

3839
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:29,780
Okay.

3840
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:31,520
Now we're in good standing.

3841
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:34,460
That's a cautionary association member.

3842
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:35,960
They might attack.

3843
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:37,180
They might not.

3844
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:37,620
Commencing analysis.

3845
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:38,740
Guys, this is not fair!

3846
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:41,580
Guys, this is not fair!

3847
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:42,660
Guys...

3848
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:48,920
Are we...

3849
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:50,500
Are we good?

3850
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:51,540
Please?

3851
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:52,140
Are we good?

3852
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:52,540
Please?

3853
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:52,960
Please?

3854
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:53,500
Please?

3855
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:53,900
Please?

3856
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:54,020
Please?

3857
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:54,580
Are we okay?

3858
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:55,280
Please?

3859
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:55,820
Please?

3860
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:56,720
PLEASE!

3861
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:57,580
PLEASE!

3862
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:58,020
PLEASE!

3863
02:34:58,020 --> 02:34:59,200
PLEASE DON'T ATTACK ME!

3864
02:34:59,260 --> 02:34:59,820
PLEASE!

3865
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:00,960
PLEASE!

3866
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:02,200
PLEASE DON'T ATTACK ME!

3867
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:03,060
PLEASE!

3868
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:05,140
Please don't attack me.

3869
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:07,200
I'm going around you so you can't aim.

3870
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:08,040
I...

3871
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:13,080
Stop being weird.

3872
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:18,560
I thought he was gonna fucking... I need to go around him so he couldn't shoot me.

3873
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:19,980
I need...

3874
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:28,620
It said 47%.

3875
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:31,860
It was... I was scared.

3876
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:34,040
Commencing replay.

3877
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:37,640
It was 47% chat.

3878
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:43,380
I thought he was gonna fucking shoot me.

3879
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:46,540
Like, why was it 47?

3880
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:49,180
Let's start by reviewing your videos.

3881
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:51,140
Why are you circling him?

3882
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:54,460
So like, if he tries... if he thinks about shooting...

3883
02:35:54,460 --> 02:35:55,280
Oh my god!

3884
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:56,520
Okay, I'm fucking rich.

3885
02:35:56,820 --> 02:36:00,680
So like, it's harder for him to shoot me because I'm circling him.

3886
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:01,880
That's how it goes.

3887
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:02,740
It's hard.

3888
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:04,580
Oh, nice.

3889
02:36:05,480 --> 02:36:07,680
Oh my god, I completed so many requests.

3890
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:13,500
He said he may shoot you, he may not!

3891
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:20,540
He's like, he may shoot you, he may not!

3892
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:22,760
And I don't wanna risk the me!

3893
02:36:26,300 --> 02:36:27,360
Alright, nice.

3894
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:30,680
Oh my god, so much money now.

3895
02:36:31,020 --> 02:36:31,400
Yay!

3896
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,480
Okay, wait.

3897
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:39,480
I DID DO IT THREE TIMES!

3898
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:40,960
I didn't read the fucking fine print.

3899
02:36:41,220 --> 02:36:42,060
I couldn't...

3900
02:36:42,060 --> 02:36:44,460
I didn't read the fine print.

3901
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:45,900
God fucking...

3902
02:36:45,900 --> 02:36:46,700
Okay.

3903
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:51,020
I never read the fine print apparently.

3904
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:53,800
I couldn't scan 200.

3905
02:36:54,320 --> 02:36:55,000
I...

3906
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,620
I didn't read the goddamn fine print.

3907
02:37:00,620 --> 02:37:03,060
I never read the fucking fine print.

3908
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:04,680
I always forget to read.

3909
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:05,860
Okay.

3910
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:07,840
Wait, can I...

3911
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:08,500
God...

3912
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:09,540
God damn it.

3913
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:09,780
Okay.

3914
02:37:10,220 --> 02:37:11,060
I'll upgrade.

3915
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:17,060
This game is going to be the end of Toki.

3916
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:19,320
I could have scanned him!

3917
02:37:24,750 --> 02:37:26,850
Do I have the bathroom yet?

3918
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:28,590
Okay.

3919
02:37:28,910 --> 02:37:31,030
Let's get rid of these weeds first, yes?

3920
02:37:31,310 --> 02:37:33,950
Once we do, this will be a great space for us.

3921
02:37:34,510 --> 02:37:37,110
Just needs a little sprucing up, shall we say.

3922
02:37:40,850 --> 02:37:42,330
It'll be worth it, guys.

3923
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:44,930
I swear to God, it'll be so worth it.

3924
02:37:45,410 --> 02:37:47,230
I swear to God.

3925
02:37:50,170 --> 02:37:51,570
I swear to...

3926
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:54,210
You know, like, I was supposed to end after an hour.

3927
02:37:59,030 --> 02:38:01,090
The hard days were finished.

3928
02:38:01,650 --> 02:38:05,350
You guys see how I'm supposed to end after an hour?

3929
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:11,630
You don't understand.

3930
02:38:11,970 --> 02:38:14,090
I need a bathroom.

3931
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:17,190
I know it may not be ideal but we must be conscious that we spend our funds.

3932
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:18,750
Are we eating the weeds right now?

3933
02:38:20,670 --> 02:38:23,190
I'll even throw in some of the homegrown mushrooms.

3934
02:38:23,510 --> 02:38:24,190
So be careful.

3935
02:38:24,190 --> 02:38:25,550
Be a good drifter and eat up.

3936
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:26,570
I need protein!

3937
02:38:27,210 --> 02:38:28,230
Ma'am!

3938
02:38:28,890 --> 02:38:29,490
Wife!

3939
02:38:31,310 --> 02:38:33,450
I can't just eat mushrooms all the time!

3940
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:35,510
Like, I need protein!

3941
02:38:36,810 --> 02:38:38,790
Do I not have a fusion cut?

3942
02:38:39,090 --> 02:38:39,690
Fucking...

3943
02:38:40,290 --> 02:38:41,530
Oh my god!

3944
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:45,190
Okay.

3945
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:48,430
Okay, guys.

3946
02:38:48,490 --> 02:38:49,570
I figured it out.

3947
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:50,210
Alright.

3948
02:38:50,770 --> 02:38:53,710
Okay, we gotta collect.

3949
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:54,430
Okay.

3950
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:56,350
Oh, I can grow!

3951
02:38:56,530 --> 02:38:59,050
And I can grow resources later!

3952
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:00,970
Okay, prep.

3953
02:39:01,090 --> 02:39:02,150
We need...

3954
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:05,510
Alright, now we should have energy ammo.

3955
02:39:05,890 --> 02:39:06,370
Now...

3956
02:39:07,530 --> 02:39:09,510
Now... Now it should be okay.

3957
02:39:10,190 --> 02:39:13,270
Okay, we gotta get rid of this and then grab more of this.

3958
02:39:13,450 --> 02:39:13,770
Okay.

3959
02:39:13,870 --> 02:39:14,990
This should be fine.

3960
02:39:16,850 --> 02:39:17,550
We're fine.

3961
02:39:17,670 --> 02:39:18,370
This should be fine.

3962
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:19,110
We're okay now.

3963
02:39:19,530 --> 02:39:20,190
Everything is fine.

3964
02:39:20,210 --> 02:39:20,610
Everything is okay.

3965
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:21,530
Is this common?

3966
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:22,490
Uncommon, right?

3967
02:39:24,010 --> 02:39:25,930
Okay, and then we need...

3968
02:39:28,070 --> 02:39:30,350
We need to... Uncommon.

3969
02:39:30,370 --> 02:39:30,650
Okay.

3970
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:34,870
Alright, we gotta get rid of ammo we don't really need.

3971
02:39:34,930 --> 02:39:36,570
So we can get rid of this.

3972
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:37,810
And this.

3973
02:39:38,370 --> 02:39:39,190
Okay, we're fine.

3974
02:39:40,090 --> 02:39:41,170
Everything's gonna be okay.

3975
02:39:41,830 --> 02:39:43,410
Everything will be okay.

3976
02:39:43,650 --> 02:39:45,430
Alright, and then...

3977
02:39:46,330 --> 02:39:48,610
Please, I... We're so close, guys.

3978
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:49,030
We're...

3979
02:39:50,390 --> 02:39:52,050
We're so close, guys.

3980
02:39:52,630 --> 02:39:55,170
We're so close to what we need.

3981
02:39:55,610 --> 02:39:55,930
We...

3982
02:39:56,470 --> 02:39:57,690
We're... Please...

3983
02:39:58,570 --> 02:39:59,990
We're almost there.

3984
02:40:00,350 --> 02:40:02,350
We're... Guys, I swear to God.

3985
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:03,730
We're so close.

3986
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:05,630
We're so close.

3987
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:11,650
Can you just...

3988
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:13,750
Maybe this is it.

3989
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:15,470
Maybe this is it.

3990
02:40:19,690 --> 02:40:21,210
We can do this.

3991
02:40:21,370 --> 02:40:25,310
This has to be the last mission to get what we want.

3992
02:40:25,850 --> 02:40:27,930
This has to be.

3993
02:40:27,970 --> 02:40:31,830
Why did they kept the lock so far ahead?

3994
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:33,130
Why?

3995
02:40:35,870 --> 02:40:37,230
This is it, guys.

3996
02:40:37,410 --> 02:40:38,110
This is it.

3997
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:40,990
This has to be it, guys.

3998
02:40:41,650 --> 02:40:42,750
No way.

3999
02:40:43,390 --> 02:40:44,030
Okay.

4000
02:40:44,750 --> 02:40:46,630
We gotta get...

4001
02:40:46,630 --> 02:40:47,430
We gotta scan.

4002
02:40:47,430 --> 02:40:48,310
And then we...

4003
02:40:48,310 --> 02:40:50,870
We have our fucking energy gun now.

4004
02:40:52,090 --> 02:40:52,610
So...

4005
02:40:54,290 --> 02:40:55,790
So we'll be okay.

4006
02:40:58,730 --> 02:41:01,090
This can't damage me too bad, right?

4007
02:41:01,310 --> 02:41:02,210
Oh God, thank God.

4008
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:03,370
Okay, there's a...

4009
02:41:03,370 --> 02:41:04,670
Oh God, thank God.

4010
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:05,790
Okay, we don't need...

4011
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:06,470
We don't need crystal.

4012
02:41:08,110 --> 02:41:10,030
Guys, we don't need crystals at all.

4013
02:41:11,370 --> 02:41:12,350
Okay, nice.

4014
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:14,750
We just need materials.

4015
02:41:15,910 --> 02:41:17,390
We literally just...

4016
02:41:17,390 --> 02:41:18,750
We just need materials, guys.

4017
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:19,770
We...

4018
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:20,870
We don't need...

4019
02:41:20,870 --> 02:41:24,530
We need materials to upgrade our area.

4020
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:25,790
We don't need crystals.

4021
02:41:25,890 --> 02:41:27,190
We have enough money.

4022
02:41:27,550 --> 02:41:28,630
Oh, thank God.

4023
02:41:28,730 --> 02:41:28,990
Okay.

4024
02:41:30,090 --> 02:41:30,610
Okay.

4025
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:33,870
Guys, we have materials.

4026
02:41:34,030 --> 02:41:34,730
Oh my God.

4027
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:35,190
Thank God.

4028
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:36,670
Thank God.

4029
02:41:36,710 --> 02:41:37,490
We got...

4030
02:41:38,650 --> 02:41:40,330
We got the fusion compound.

4031
02:41:40,610 --> 02:41:41,150
Oh my God.

4032
02:41:41,170 --> 02:41:43,170
Things are going okay for us right now.

4033
02:41:43,610 --> 02:41:44,130
Things...

4034
02:41:44,130 --> 02:41:45,030
Things are...

4035
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:47,310
Things are already going okay.

4036
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:49,810
I can't believe it.

4037
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:53,330
Okay, nice.

4038
02:41:53,350 --> 02:41:54,630
We need crafting materials.

4039
02:41:55,850 --> 02:41:58,090
Wait, there is a guy right here.

4040
02:41:58,390 --> 02:41:59,870
Wait, somebody already used...

4041
02:41:59,870 --> 02:42:00,930
Got the crystal here.

4042
02:42:02,850 --> 02:42:04,070
Wait, these guys...

4043
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:05,110
These guys drop materials.

4044
02:42:06,150 --> 02:42:07,270
No, they don't.

4045
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:08,570
Okay, nice.

4046
02:42:08,570 --> 02:42:10,010
We have...

4047
02:42:10,010 --> 02:42:11,930
Okay, I have to keep thinking that is like...

4048
02:42:11,930 --> 02:42:12,450
Oh my God.

4049
02:42:12,530 --> 02:42:13,570
Oh, there's another chest.

4050
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:14,850
Thank God.

4051
02:42:16,250 --> 02:42:17,150
I'll take it.

4052
02:42:17,330 --> 02:42:17,350
Okay, nice.

4053
02:42:17,350 --> 02:42:17,750
Okay, nice.

4054
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:19,110
Okay, nice.

4055
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:19,490
Wait, what's this?

4056
02:42:19,730 --> 02:42:20,470
Oh, they are grenades.

4057
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:21,210
We don't need that.

4058
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:22,230
Oh my God.

4059
02:42:22,250 --> 02:42:22,790
We are so close.

4060
02:42:22,930 --> 02:42:24,470
I can feel the bathroom.

4061
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:25,410
I can use...

4062
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:28,930
I'll be able to use the bathroom soon, chat.

4063
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:29,670
What?

4064
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,510
What?

4065
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:32,270
What?

4066
02:42:32,990 --> 02:42:34,510
What's going to be today?

4067
02:42:34,670 --> 02:42:35,890
What's going to be today?

4068
02:42:35,890 --> 02:42:36,570
It's going to be this run.

4069
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:37,230
It's going to be this run.

4070
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:39,910
This is it.

4071
02:42:41,210 --> 02:42:43,090
This is going to be it, guys.

4072
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:47,330
I can almost smell the run right now.

4073
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:47,690
I'm right here!

4074
02:42:49,970 --> 02:42:50,790
Oh god.

4075
02:42:51,210 --> 02:42:52,130
Please.

4076
02:42:52,230 --> 02:42:54,670
I don't need crystals, guys.

4077
02:42:55,250 --> 02:42:57,170
I just...

4078
02:42:57,170 --> 02:42:59,410
I just need...

4079
02:42:59,410 --> 02:43:01,070
I just need my materials.

4080
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:04,270
Please, I just need my materials.

4081
02:43:07,390 --> 02:43:10,050
Where are any of the materials?

4082
02:43:12,510 --> 02:43:14,810
Oh my god.

4083
02:43:17,330 --> 02:43:18,330
Alright, we go up.

4084
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:21,290
If we go up, there has to be ores.

4085
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:23,890
There has to be ores right here.

4086
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:24,870
There has to be.

4087
02:43:25,330 --> 02:43:26,910
Guys, where can I...

4088
02:43:26,910 --> 02:43:29,550
Where can I grab my upgrade items, guys?

4089
02:43:29,890 --> 02:43:31,290
That's really all I need.

4090
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:34,550
I need more upgrade items.

4091
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:38,470
Okay.

4092
02:43:41,550 --> 02:43:42,410
On the ground.

4093
02:43:42,470 --> 02:43:43,110
Thank you, guys.

4094
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,130
Thank you.

4095
02:43:44,170 --> 02:43:44,830
Oh my god.

4096
02:43:45,570 --> 02:43:46,930
I just found out.

4097
02:43:47,330 --> 02:43:48,410
I can't even grab items on the ground.

4098
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:49,730
Guys, where are the people?

4099
02:43:50,010 --> 02:43:51,650
Where are the other mechs?

4100
02:43:53,550 --> 02:43:55,030
Where the fuck are they at?

4101
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:56,490
Okay, we'll excavate one.

4102
02:43:56,750 --> 02:43:58,130
We'll get at least $1000.

4103
02:44:03,150 --> 02:44:04,150
Alright, here we go.

4104
02:44:06,210 --> 02:44:07,410
We'll grab like...

4105
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:11,070
We'll grab like one- a thousand dollars.

4106
02:44:11,270 --> 02:44:13,910
And then we're gonna try and find more mats.

4107
02:44:14,730 --> 02:44:15,950
Oh my god...

4108
02:44:15,950 --> 02:44:17,490
Where is it?

4109
02:44:18,030 --> 02:44:19,250
Where is it?

4110
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:20,390
Please, I'm desperate.

4111
02:44:20,570 --> 02:44:22,310
I've been here for so long.

4112
02:44:23,650 --> 02:44:25,610
I'm going to travel all the way to this area.

4113
02:44:26,490 --> 02:44:31,950
I swear to God, I'm going to travel all the way right here to find this fucking thing.

4114
02:44:33,470 --> 02:44:35,170
I don't need any of this.

4115
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:36,570
I don't need any of this.

4116
02:44:36,610 --> 02:44:38,830
That's... I don't... I'll just take it.

4117
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:42,610
I'll just take it.

4118
02:44:42,610 --> 02:44:46,330
I'll go all the way to that area.

4119
02:44:48,350 --> 02:44:50,750
Okay, we need to kill these guys anyway.

4120
02:44:52,410 --> 02:44:53,650
Whoa, whoa.

4121
02:44:53,790 --> 02:44:55,750
Do you self-destruct or something?

4122
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:59,310
Okay, we need...

4123
02:45:00,330 --> 02:45:03,370
We need five more.

4124
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:05,370
Five more crawlers.

4125
02:45:07,130 --> 02:45:09,930
Don't you need it for plumbing?

4126
02:45:11,410 --> 02:45:14,050
We haven't even made it to the part.

4127
02:45:14,510 --> 02:45:18,390
We're still trying to fucking decorate the pit.

4128
02:45:20,930 --> 02:45:23,370
Okay, we don't need the crawler shit here.

4129
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:25,690
Somebody was here.

4130
02:45:28,730 --> 02:45:31,030
Like, I know somebody was here.

4131
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:33,470
Okay, this is six.

4132
02:45:33,690 --> 02:45:34,570
Six one.

4133
02:45:37,450 --> 02:45:39,410
I should be allowed to buy materials.

4134
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:40,390
I don't understand.

4135
02:45:40,730 --> 02:45:41,890
Oh, there is three.

4136
02:45:42,230 --> 02:45:42,770
Wait, that's good.

4137
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:43,150
That's good.

4138
02:45:43,170 --> 02:45:44,070
That's good that there's three.

4139
02:45:44,110 --> 02:45:46,690
We need to kill as many as we can.

4140
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:48,430
Okay, that's two.

4141
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:50,710
Okay, one last one.

4142
02:45:51,650 --> 02:45:52,530
Not one last.

4143
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:53,010
Two last.

4144
02:45:53,050 --> 02:45:53,790
Sorry, I can't count.

4145
02:45:54,030 --> 02:45:55,050
Okay, two more.

4146
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:57,770
Oh my God, we're two more away.

4147
02:45:59,890 --> 02:46:00,330
Please.

4148
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:03,250
How is there nobody here?

4149
02:46:04,570 --> 02:46:06,570
Oh, I can't jump because I'm tired.

4150
02:46:06,810 --> 02:46:09,510
I can't jump because I'm fucking tired.

4151
02:46:10,090 --> 02:46:11,570
And it's raining!

4152
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:14,310
It's fine.

4153
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:16,090
We don't care about the rain.

4154
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:17,630
It's okay.

4155
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:19,370
It's okay.

4156
02:46:19,370 --> 02:46:20,750
We don't care about the rain.

4157
02:46:20,810 --> 02:46:22,210
It's gonna be sunny again anyway.

4158
02:46:24,450 --> 02:46:26,610
Why is there nobody around me?

4159
02:46:27,010 --> 02:46:31,550
Is no one this deep into the... into the zone?

4160
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:34,690
Is nobody else here?

4161
02:46:35,910 --> 02:46:36,590
Guys.

4162
02:46:37,410 --> 02:46:39,670
Guys, where... where is everybody?

4163
02:46:40,330 --> 02:46:41,010
Please.

4164
02:46:41,390 --> 02:46:43,590
Don't you all need a big bathroom too?

4165
02:46:44,110 --> 02:46:47,590
I can't be the only one here grinding out a fucking bathroom.

4166
02:46:48,630 --> 02:46:52,550
This can't be my... this can't be only me.

4167
02:46:54,330 --> 02:46:56,150
There has to be a...

4168
02:46:56,150 --> 02:46:56,730
Oh.

4169
02:46:57,490 --> 02:46:58,170
Wait.

4170
02:46:58,390 --> 02:47:01,450
Wait, where is... get over here.

4171
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:02,430
Please.

4172
02:47:03,990 --> 02:47:04,750
No!

4173
02:47:05,510 --> 02:47:06,810
No, no, no, no, no!

4174
02:47:06,810 --> 02:47:07,450
No!

4175
02:47:08,170 --> 02:47:09,350
You fucking...

4176
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:10,610
You...

4177
02:47:10,610 --> 02:47:11,730
You fucking...

4178
02:47:11,730 --> 02:47:12,130
It's raining.

4179
02:47:12,450 --> 02:47:13,870
You fucking...

4180
02:47:13,870 --> 02:47:16,090
Current rainfall levels should not pose a problem.

4181
02:47:16,290 --> 02:47:16,850
Please.

4182
02:47:18,270 --> 02:47:20,550
I can't believe it.

4183
02:47:22,680 --> 02:47:23,840
So messed up.

4184
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:24,740
Precipitation levels rising.

4185
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:25,780
Precipitation levels decreasing.

4186
02:47:25,780 --> 02:47:27,920
I needed to scan you.

4187
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:31,860
I needed to fucking scan you.

4188
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:32,600
Please.

4189
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:33,100
Please.

4190
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:34,680
Wow.

4191
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,000
Guys, literally...

4192
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:40,440
And then it starts raining.

4193
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:43,320
Oh my God.

4194
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:46,180
Fifteen seconds until elevator arrives.

4195
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:47,620
No friends.

4196
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:49,500
Go to the...

4197
02:47:49,500 --> 02:47:51,900
I'm not walking all the way over here guys.

4198
02:47:52,060 --> 02:47:52,620
I'm not...

4199
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:55,260
I'm not walking all the...

4200
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:57,200
Guys, I am not walking all the...

4201
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,000
Guys, I can't.

4202
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,240
I cannot walk here.

4203
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:00,820
I can't.

4204
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:04,840
I cannot walk.

4205
02:48:05,080 --> 02:48:08,220
The next run, it will be...

4206
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:15,580
We'll do the next run.

4207
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:18,320
There's nobody here in this area.

4208
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:21,460
There's not anybody in this area.

4209
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:23,500
I can't believe it.

4210
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:24,740
I can't believe it!

4211
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:29,560
You made it.

4212
02:48:29,860 --> 02:48:32,240
No, the next run won't be the last.

4213
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:33,920
The next run is where we're going to make it.

4214
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:36,980
The next run is the real one.

4215
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:40,860
Guys, the next run is the real one, I swear.

4216
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:42,140
I swear.

4217
02:48:43,060 --> 02:48:45,560
Okay, I don't want to see this.

4218
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:47,800
It's just me going right.

4219
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:52,040
It's me going...

4220
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:54,520
I win.

4221
02:48:54,740 --> 02:48:55,420
Okay.

4222
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:58,600
Alright.

4223
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:02,020
There's no way.

4224
02:49:02,140 --> 02:49:04,820
There's no way to lock it that far.

4225
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:08,220
Oh my god, please.

4226
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:10,120
We're so close.

4227
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:14,920
Somebody said it should have taken me an hour, like two hours ago.

4228
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:17,700
They baited me so hard.

4229
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:21,520
They baited me so fucking hard.

4230
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,120
Just one more.

4231
02:49:24,140 --> 02:49:26,020
Thank you for the super chat.

4232
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:27,180
Thank you, thank you.

4233
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:28,640
I got baited so hard.

4234
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:32,000
They said it would be done in an hour.

4235
02:49:34,040 --> 02:49:34,640
Okay.

4236
02:49:35,500 --> 02:49:38,240
Alright, we need to find two more people.

4237
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:41,640
And deliver the following amount of vicious stones.

4238
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:42,440
I need...

4239
02:49:43,240 --> 02:49:45,900
Oh my god, I need that many?

4240
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:49,220
Okay, we still need to get two more.

4241
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:49,640
Wait.

4242
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:50,900
What can I craft?

4243
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:52,440
Oh, I can craft these.

4244
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:53,760
Okay, I'm gonna repair then.

4245
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:55,300
Repair.

4246
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:56,240
Nice.

4247
02:49:56,360 --> 02:49:56,680
Okay.

4248
02:49:58,600 --> 02:49:58,920
Alright.

4249
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:01,320
What can I... Okay, cradle parts.

4250
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:04,560
Why can't you give me like materials?

4251
02:50:04,800 --> 02:50:05,440
Please.

4252
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:10,580
Please, I just... Please, I just want like materials.

4253
02:50:10,600 --> 02:50:12,140
That's all I want.

4254
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:13,260
Please.

4255
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:16,100
I still don't have brittle iron ore.

4256
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:19,300
I forgot to... Oh my god, I forgot that.

4257
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:21,740
I... Oh my god!

4258
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:26,240
This is the last run, guys.

4259
02:50:26,380 --> 02:50:28,980
This is the run where we're gonna get everything, I believe.

4260
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:34,400
This is the run where we're gonna... we're gonna get everything we ever needed in life, guys.

4261
02:50:34,540 --> 02:50:36,280
I... I can feel it.

4262
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:38,440
I can actually... I can feel it.

4263
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:44,920
I can... I can feel it.

4264
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:45,920
This is it.

4265
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:47,500
This is it.

4266
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,180
This is it.

4267
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:52,520
I can craft iron ore?

4268
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:54,280
With what?

4269
02:50:54,540 --> 02:50:56,080
What... How do I craft it?

4270
02:51:02,940 --> 02:51:03,700
With what?

4271
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,320
Why didn't you tell me?

4272
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:08,760
And it's raining!

4273
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:14,200
Alright.

4274
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:17,020
Guys, like, I... I'm going home.

4275
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:19,040
I can apparently craft iron ore.

4276
02:51:19,060 --> 02:51:20,160
I'm fucking running back.

4277
02:51:21,080 --> 02:51:23,720
I'm fucking... I'm heading to the next exit.

4278
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:27,960
I'm heading... I'm heading to the next exit right now.

4279
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:28,940
I'm fucking... I'm ready.

4280
02:51:29,880 --> 02:51:31,500
I'm crafting this shit.

4281
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:35,420
I'm crafting this shit and I'm fucking leaving.

4282
02:51:35,960 --> 02:51:36,480
I'm...

4283
02:51:39,640 --> 02:51:41,660
I'll grab some money real quick, too.

4284
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:44,220
Dude, guys, thank you for the super chat.

4285
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:45,200
Thank you, thank you.

4286
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:48,440
Okay.

4287
02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:49,180
Don't worry.

4288
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:49,260
Don't worry.

4289
02:51:50,320 --> 02:51:52,940
There has to be another player somewhere near me.

4290
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:57,700
I swear to god, if I get one, guys, I swear to god.

4291
02:51:58,980 --> 02:51:59,500
Target.

4292
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:03,620
Oh!

4293
02:52:03,860 --> 02:52:04,680
There's a stone!

4294
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:06,760
That's what we needed!

4295
02:52:07,900 --> 02:52:08,600
There's two!

4296
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:12,440
Nice, we got two.

4297
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:14,720
Nice!

4298
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:18,340
We got two of that thing!

4299
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:20,580
Where's the other target?

4300
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:22,340
Oh, it's like behind... I'm not going there.

4301
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:23,200
It's way too far.

4302
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:24,000
Alright.

4303
02:52:26,300 --> 02:52:28,140
Alright, guys, we're fucking sca... Oh, wait!

4304
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:28,860
Is that another one?

4305
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:29,180
Nice!

4306
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:32,460
Oh my god, we're getting all the stones we need.

4307
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:33,900
This is it.

4308
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:36,080
We're fucking rich for once.

4309
02:52:37,340 --> 02:52:40,000
For once, things are going my way.

4310
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:43,420
Things are actually going my way.

4311
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:45,120
Thank god.

4312
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:48,080
God, I'm gonna cry.

4313
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,280
Okay, we gotta jump here.

4314
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:57,320
And then...

4315
02:52:58,060 --> 02:52:59,640
Is there anybody else here?

4316
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:02,800
Is there anybody here?

4317
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:06,100
Wait, how do I...

4318
02:53:07,380 --> 02:53:10,460
Wait, there's like a box somewhere, but is it below me?

4319
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:11,620
Oh, it's below me!

4320
02:53:13,140 --> 02:53:14,860
It's fucking below me.

4321
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:16,980
Wait, there's stuff here.

4322
02:53:17,940 --> 02:53:18,660
Oh, nice.

4323
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:19,100
Okay.

4324
02:53:21,780 --> 02:53:22,660
Is it here?

4325
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:25,280
Oh, there it is!

4326
02:53:28,890 --> 02:53:29,890
Okay, nice.

4327
02:53:30,030 --> 02:53:31,010
Alright, we're crafting.

4328
02:53:32,530 --> 02:53:34,090
We'll craft the iron ore.

4329
02:53:34,230 --> 02:53:34,950
This is it.

4330
02:53:35,670 --> 02:53:38,990
We're gonna head back and we're gonna craft this stupid iron ore.

4331
02:53:39,230 --> 02:53:40,990
And then my...

4332
02:53:40,990 --> 02:53:41,530
Oh?

4333
02:53:42,770 --> 02:53:44,050
Is that him?

4334
02:53:44,270 --> 02:53:44,830
Guys!

4335
02:53:45,090 --> 02:53:47,770
I swear, I'm not suspicious, guys, please.

4336
02:53:48,330 --> 02:53:48,890
I...

4337
02:53:50,370 --> 02:53:51,130
Wait, where?

4338
02:53:51,890 --> 02:53:53,010
Where, where, where?

4339
02:53:53,510 --> 02:53:54,770
I can't hear them all.

4340
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:55,430
Thank you for the...

4341
02:53:56,070 --> 02:53:57,610
Thank you, thank you.

4342
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:58,550
Where is he?

4343
02:53:59,050 --> 02:54:01,770
Where is he?

4344
02:54:02,290 --> 02:54:05,890
I know you are...

4345
02:54:05,890 --> 02:54:08,290
I know you're a person.

4346
02:54:10,990 --> 02:54:12,250
Oh my god!

4347
02:54:12,650 --> 02:54:13,610
Please let me...

4348
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:15,250
Please let me scan you.

4349
02:54:15,410 --> 02:54:15,890
Please, I...

4350
02:54:16,570 --> 02:54:17,090
Please...

4351
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:18,630
Please let me...

4352
02:54:18,630 --> 02:54:19,270
Please...

4353
02:54:19,270 --> 02:54:20,310
Please let me scan...

4354
02:54:20,310 --> 02:54:20,490
Hi.

4355
02:54:26,310 --> 02:54:26,830
Hello.

4356
02:54:31,370 --> 02:54:32,410
Who are...

4357
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:34,750
Who are fucking...

4358
02:54:34,750 --> 02:54:35,190
How do I...

4359
02:54:35,190 --> 02:54:36,790
Why can't I scan you?

4360
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:38,550
Why can't I scan you?

4361
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:39,190
How do I...

4362
02:54:39,770 --> 02:54:40,430
How do I...

4363
02:54:40,430 --> 02:54:41,110
How do I...

4364
02:54:41,110 --> 02:54:41,210
Please!

4365
02:54:42,290 --> 02:54:42,810
Please!

4366
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:44,650
I need to scan you!

4367
02:54:44,790 --> 02:54:45,490
Don't leave!

4368
02:54:46,930 --> 02:54:47,450
I...

4369
02:54:47,450 --> 02:54:49,630
I want that...

4370
02:54:50,470 --> 02:54:53,730
Please, I swear to god, I'm not suspicious, I...

4371
02:54:53,730 --> 02:54:54,510
I just...

4372
02:54:54,510 --> 02:54:55,730
Please, I just...

4373
02:54:55,730 --> 02:54:57,670
I just want to know what you are.

4374
02:54:58,350 --> 02:54:58,870
Please...

4375
02:54:58,870 --> 02:55:01,470
I swear, I'm not trying to kill you.

4376
02:55:01,590 --> 02:55:02,450
Please, I...

4377
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:04,610
Oh, please, leave me alone!

4378
02:55:04,810 --> 02:55:06,570
I just want to scan him.

4379
02:55:06,870 --> 02:55:07,310
What?

4380
02:55:07,390 --> 02:55:07,650
What?

4381
02:55:07,890 --> 02:55:08,030
What?

4382
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:08,530
What?

4383
02:55:12,330 --> 02:55:14,990
I swear to god, I just...

4384
02:55:17,230 --> 02:55:20,710
Oh my god, please let me see you!

4385
02:55:24,110 --> 02:55:26,390
Why can't I watch you?

4386
02:55:26,970 --> 02:55:29,830
Is it the rain?

4387
02:55:30,410 --> 02:55:35,650
I swear to... oh my god, please, I'm going through a lot right now.

4388
02:55:36,170 --> 02:55:37,350
Where did he go?

4389
02:55:37,350 --> 02:55:38,830
I lost him!

4390
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:42,470
No!

4391
02:55:44,210 --> 02:55:45,230
Oh, that's him.

4392
02:55:45,470 --> 02:55:46,450
Oh, he died.

4393
02:55:47,390 --> 02:55:48,010
Nice.

4394
02:55:49,930 --> 02:55:50,550
Alright.

4395
02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:53,410
Oh, he's dead.

4396
02:55:53,490 --> 02:55:54,230
I'll take his blame.

4397
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:00,560
I mean, I guess I'll just...

4398
02:56:01,310 --> 02:56:02,630
I'm outgunned now.

4399
02:56:02,930 --> 02:56:04,550
Wait, does he have iron ore?

4400
02:56:05,570 --> 02:56:06,190
How?

4401
02:56:07,350 --> 02:56:08,110
Why did I kill him?

4402
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:09,090
He literally died!

4403
02:56:12,810 --> 02:56:13,330
Okay.

4404
02:56:14,950 --> 02:56:15,690
Let's see.

4405
02:56:17,590 --> 02:56:19,030
Wait, what's that behind me?

4406
02:56:19,510 --> 02:56:20,270
Oh, hey.

4407
02:56:21,130 --> 02:56:21,970
Hey, guys.

4408
02:56:22,510 --> 02:56:24,850
Guys, I... please, please, I...

4409
02:56:24,850 --> 02:56:27,330
Please, please, I... please.

4410
02:56:28,930 --> 02:56:31,850
Okay, nice.

4411
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:32,770
Does he have iron ore?

4412
02:56:34,350 --> 02:56:35,510
No, he doesn't.

4413
02:56:38,310 --> 02:56:39,730
He doesn't have what I need.

4414
02:56:39,810 --> 02:56:41,590
How come I can scan that guy?

4415
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:48,470
Oh my god.

4416
02:56:48,890 --> 02:56:49,950
Guys, they'll be fine.

4417
02:56:52,290 --> 02:56:53,070
We're fine.

4418
02:56:53,970 --> 02:56:54,690
We're fine.

4419
02:56:54,930 --> 02:56:55,870
We'll heal here.

4420
02:56:56,090 --> 02:56:57,010
We'll heal in the rain.

4421
02:56:57,090 --> 02:56:58,150
It'll, like, counteract it.

4422
02:56:59,650 --> 02:57:00,850
It'll counteract everything.

4423
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:02,590
Oh my god, we did it, guys.

4424
02:57:03,230 --> 02:57:04,810
We fucking did it, everybody.

4425
02:57:05,430 --> 02:57:06,810
See, I told you guys.

4426
02:57:06,830 --> 02:57:08,050
It counteracts everything.

4427
02:57:09,910 --> 02:57:12,930
I don't know how he died, but now I have his gun.

4428
02:57:13,410 --> 02:57:15,510
He has some sick-ass guns, though.

4429
02:57:15,570 --> 02:57:16,230
Like, look at this.

4430
02:57:16,850 --> 02:57:18,070
Like, oh my god.

4431
02:57:18,150 --> 02:57:18,490
Look at...

4432
02:57:18,490 --> 02:57:20,830
He has a fucking bolt sniper rifle.

4433
02:57:21,790 --> 02:57:23,730
Like, I don't need to craft that anymore.

4434
02:57:26,170 --> 02:57:27,250
Oh, it's so far.

4435
02:57:27,390 --> 02:57:28,250
The weather's gotten better.

4436
02:57:28,390 --> 02:57:29,210
It's so far.

4437
02:57:29,830 --> 02:57:31,310
It's so far.

4438
02:57:32,010 --> 02:57:34,390
I don't know how she fucking died.

4439
02:57:34,450 --> 02:57:35,690
She has, like, loot.

4440
02:57:35,930 --> 02:57:36,790
That's the thing.

4441
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:41,990
It was... Oh, we got...

4442
02:57:44,050 --> 02:57:46,530
Yeah, he died to the mobs and the rain.

4443
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:47,610
Am I stuck?

4444
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:49,570
Oh my god.

4445
02:57:49,570 --> 02:57:50,190
Damn it.

4446
02:57:50,210 --> 02:57:50,850
There's all...

4447
02:57:50,850 --> 02:57:52,010
No, there's no way.

4448
02:57:52,210 --> 02:57:53,630
There's no way I can jump out of this.

4449
02:57:53,690 --> 02:57:54,570
There's no fucking way.

4450
02:57:54,690 --> 02:57:55,790
There's no fucking way.

4451
02:57:56,090 --> 02:57:57,410
There's no... Oh, thank god.

4452
02:57:57,490 --> 02:57:57,730
Okay.

4453
02:57:57,850 --> 02:58:01,510
I was gonna say, after all of that, and then...

4454
02:58:03,550 --> 02:58:06,650
I was gonna say, there's no fucking way they do this to me.

4455
02:58:08,070 --> 02:58:09,890
Like, I just want one thing.

4456
02:58:10,050 --> 02:58:12,110
I literally... I just want one thing.

4457
02:58:13,490 --> 02:58:13,970
Alright.

4458
02:58:15,530 --> 02:58:16,290
There we go.

4459
02:58:16,290 --> 02:58:16,610
We're fine.

4460
02:58:16,670 --> 02:58:17,110
We're safe.

4461
02:58:18,050 --> 02:58:18,750
We're safe.

4462
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:23,230
We got her loot and then we, like, got a part of him inside me.

4463
02:58:23,890 --> 02:58:24,610
Look, see?

4464
02:58:24,710 --> 02:58:25,290
Look at that.

4465
02:58:25,410 --> 02:58:26,950
We have... Oh my god!

4466
02:58:27,390 --> 02:58:28,790
Wait, can I wear this?

4467
02:58:29,790 --> 02:58:30,470
I'm him!

4468
02:58:34,490 --> 02:58:36,470
Wait, I can have his arms!

4469
02:58:36,810 --> 02:58:38,370
Look at my fucking arms.

4470
02:58:38,530 --> 02:58:39,070
Look at that.

4471
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:40,350
Look at that.

4472
02:58:40,550 --> 02:58:42,270
I didn't have to fucking do anything.

4473
02:58:42,430 --> 02:58:43,410
I got his arms.

4474
02:58:43,530 --> 02:58:44,030
Boink.

4475
02:58:44,030 --> 02:58:44,830
My arms now.

4476
02:58:45,730 --> 02:58:46,750
Oh my god.

4477
02:58:47,270 --> 02:58:49,150
Look, my arms are orange now.

4478
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:51,110
I look like a gamer.

4479
02:58:51,650 --> 02:58:53,210
I'm not default anymore.

4480
02:58:53,610 --> 02:58:55,590
I look like a fucking gamer now.

4481
02:58:57,250 --> 02:58:58,410
We did it!

4482
02:58:59,790 --> 02:59:00,590
I'm tripped!

4483
02:59:02,430 --> 02:59:03,910
Oh my god, we did it, guys.

4484
02:59:05,730 --> 02:59:06,910
I left his legs.

4485
02:59:08,250 --> 02:59:11,890
I left his... I mean, he died, so, like, might not be very good legs in the end.

4486
02:59:12,490 --> 02:59:12,890
Like...

4487
02:59:13,530 --> 02:59:14,630
I'm off-gamer now!

4488
02:59:15,070 --> 02:59:16,310
I didn't even spend money for that!

4489
02:59:16,630 --> 02:59:19,030
I literally just stalked him until he died.

4490
02:59:21,650 --> 02:59:23,030
Okay, how do I... Okay, there we go.

4491
02:59:23,530 --> 02:59:24,350
Okay, this is it.

4492
02:59:24,390 --> 02:59:26,430
This is where we're gonna get our bathroom, ma'am.

4493
02:59:27,290 --> 02:59:28,310
We're gonna do this.

4494
02:59:29,210 --> 02:59:33,330
We're gonna get the bathroom, my lovely robot wife.

4495
02:59:34,070 --> 02:59:35,110
This is it.

4496
02:59:35,130 --> 02:59:36,990
There's no way I can fuck this up.

4497
02:59:37,090 --> 02:59:37,710
This is it.

4498
02:59:37,730 --> 02:59:38,930
I got so many things.

4499
02:59:39,470 --> 02:59:43,130
I... I got so many... I'm a scavenger.

4500
02:59:43,450 --> 02:59:44,970
I'm literally a vulture.

4501
02:59:45,070 --> 02:59:47,470
I fucking stalked him until he fucking died.

4502
02:59:47,570 --> 02:59:49,450
It took all... It took most of his stuff.

4503
03:00:00,920 --> 03:00:01,840
This is it.

4504
03:00:02,580 --> 03:00:03,960
This has to be it.

4505
03:00:04,540 --> 03:00:06,680
Alright, what happened?

4506
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,960
Who was it, anyway?

4507
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:15,220
Is it him?

4508
03:00:15,460 --> 03:00:17,000
Oh yeah, he's the one that died.

4509
03:00:17,240 --> 03:00:17,600
Yeah.

4510
03:00:17,840 --> 03:00:18,360
Nerd.

4511
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:23,240
At least I didn't die to the fucking rain.

4512
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:29,080
All I'm saying is I didn't die to the rain, guys.

4513
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:30,440
Like...

4514
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:34,440
A lot of stuff happened, but at least I didn't die to the fucking rain.

4515
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:42,900
Alright, this is it.

4516
03:00:42,940 --> 03:00:44,120
This has to be it.

4517
03:00:44,320 --> 03:00:45,320
There's no way.

4518
03:00:45,700 --> 03:00:46,780
There's no...

4519
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:49,000
Oh my god.

4520
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:50,500
There's no fucking way.

4521
03:00:50,620 --> 03:00:51,080
Oh my god.

4522
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:52,360
Oh my god!

4523
03:00:53,480 --> 03:00:56,500
She has the red... the red bodysuit now.

4524
03:00:56,860 --> 03:00:59,460
We've been granted permission to form alliances now.

4525
03:00:59,460 --> 03:01:01,780
Oh my god, that's how people get friends?

4526
03:01:02,460 --> 03:01:04,940
They finally unlocked friendship?

4527
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:08,180
It only took three hours, guys.

4528
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:13,300
It only took three hours and now I have friends.

4529
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:14,220
Oh my god.

4530
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:16,980
Oh my god, that's all it took.

4531
03:01:17,260 --> 03:01:20,080
It took three hours to get friendship.

4532
03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:23,060
Friendship unlocked.

4533
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:26,200
Nice, I got more money too.

4534
03:01:29,460 --> 03:01:30,280
Oh my god.

4535
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:31,200
Finally.

4536
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:34,300
I can finally have friends.

4537
03:01:34,780 --> 03:01:36,960
Oh, it took so long.

4538
03:01:38,060 --> 03:01:39,960
It took so long.

4539
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:41,700
But we made it.

4540
03:01:41,820 --> 03:01:43,400
Okay, we gotta be able to...

4541
03:01:43,400 --> 03:01:45,840
Okay, we should be able to craft rocks apparently.

4542
03:01:46,820 --> 03:01:47,460
Materials.

4543
03:01:47,500 --> 03:01:49,160
Is it brittle iron ore?

4544
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:51,220
Oh my god, we have enough.

4545
03:01:54,020 --> 03:01:55,960
Are you... one?

4546
03:01:57,060 --> 03:01:58,080
Okay, wait.

4547
03:01:58,980 --> 03:02:00,000
There's no way.

4548
03:02:03,340 --> 03:02:04,540
Can I craft more?

4549
03:02:06,860 --> 03:02:07,460
I...

4550
03:02:08,480 --> 03:02:09,080
Okay.

4551
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:10,680
Okay.

4552
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:15,600
Your warehouse is full so you cannot...

4553
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:16,420
I... what?

4554
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:21,080
How much do... what do I have?

4555
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:23,080
Holy shit.

4556
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:23,540
Okay.

4557
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:25,740
Alright, we gotta figure this out.

4558
03:02:25,880 --> 03:02:27,100
I did not realize.

4559
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:29,460
I have a lot of stuff.

4560
03:02:29,640 --> 03:02:30,700
What do I sell?

4561
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:34,920
And not just...

4562
03:02:36,120 --> 03:02:38,000
What the fuck do I have?

4563
03:02:38,140 --> 03:02:39,260
What do I sell?

4564
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:41,760
I don't know what to sell.

4565
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:44,760
How do I have so much stuff?

4566
03:02:44,900 --> 03:02:46,060
I don't know what to sell.

4567
03:02:48,460 --> 03:02:49,240
Press Z?

4568
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:51,960
What does Z do?

4569
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:56,780
Oh, Z the stack?

4570
03:02:56,780 --> 03:02:57,120
How?

4571
03:02:57,740 --> 03:02:58,480
No, it doesn't...

4572
03:02:58,480 --> 03:02:59,240
It doesn't stack.

4573
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:02,920
Wait, it doesn't stack.

4574
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:05,540
Unless I have to go...

4575
03:03:05,540 --> 03:03:07,640
Wait, how do I go to my warehouse?

4576
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:08,360
Is it here?

4577
03:03:09,240 --> 03:03:10,000
Oh, it's here.

4578
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:10,380
Okay.

4579
03:03:14,090 --> 03:03:15,490
Anyways, we'll be grouped together.

4580
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:15,970
Oh, okay.

4581
03:03:16,990 --> 03:03:18,230
Oh, it's stacked.

4582
03:03:18,730 --> 03:03:19,910
Everything's stacked up.

4583
03:03:19,970 --> 03:03:20,350
Nice.

4584
03:03:20,470 --> 03:03:20,910
Okay.

4585
03:03:21,370 --> 03:03:22,310
Alright, that's good.

4586
03:03:25,010 --> 03:03:25,450
Nice.

4587
03:03:27,290 --> 03:03:27,990
Oh, five.

4588
03:03:27,990 --> 03:03:28,950
Oh my god.

4589
03:03:28,990 --> 03:03:29,170
Wait.

4590
03:03:29,370 --> 03:03:29,890
Oh my god.

4591
03:03:29,910 --> 03:03:30,430
This is it.

4592
03:03:30,930 --> 03:03:32,150
This is so close.

4593
03:03:32,290 --> 03:03:33,370
We're actually so close.

4594
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:35,050
We're so close.

4595
03:03:36,290 --> 03:03:37,210
This is it.

4596
03:03:37,290 --> 03:03:39,010
I knew this was the last one.

4597
03:03:40,950 --> 03:03:42,250
I have enough money.

4598
03:03:51,290 --> 03:03:56,150
Alright, you guys watch her fucking clean up.

4599
03:03:56,230 --> 03:03:57,310
I'm gonna use the bathroom again.

4600
03:04:03,970 --> 03:04:05,470
Did a pretty good job there.

4601
03:04:13,850 --> 03:04:17,530
With this complete, we can store just tons of equipment and supplies.

4602
03:04:18,550 --> 03:04:20,850
Starting to feel like you're a real drifter.

4603
03:04:21,810 --> 03:04:26,430
With the technical work done, now we can focus on making our space more livable.

4604
03:04:26,690 --> 03:04:29,290
With that said, next, let's focus on the living area.

4605
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:06,040
There.

4606
03:06:06,160 --> 03:06:07,060
We made it.

4607
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:08,460
We got the...

4608
03:06:09,360 --> 03:06:10,200
Oh my god.

4609
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:11,360
Okay.

4610
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:13,700
The degraded plaster piece.

4611
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:14,800
And the fireplace.

4612
03:06:14,800 --> 03:06:16,200
I swear to god.

4613
03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:16,760
Do I...

4614
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:17,920
Are we there?

4615
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:19,040
Did we...

4616
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:22,880
Are we close to the finish line?

4617
03:06:23,160 --> 03:06:24,080
Is it...

4618
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:25,400
I would...

4619
03:06:25,400 --> 03:06:26,220
Oh my god.

4620
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:26,540
Please.

4621
03:06:26,980 --> 03:06:30,280
We don't have the fusion core.

4622
03:06:30,340 --> 03:06:31,360
You fucking...

4623
03:06:31,360 --> 03:06:34,240
We don't have the fusion core.

4624
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:35,360
I swear to...

4625
03:06:35,360 --> 03:06:35,820
No.

4626
03:06:37,320 --> 03:06:40,380
We don't have a fusion core.

4627
03:06:40,800 --> 03:06:44,780
We can't craft a fusion core.

4628
03:06:44,780 --> 03:06:45,220
Score!

4629
03:06:46,080 --> 03:06:49,240
I know, I think it's so sad.

4630
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:52,160
What the fuck do I do?

4631
03:06:52,180 --> 03:06:53,340
I'm an item manager.

4632
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:56,140
And what was the item manager for?

4633
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:59,220
Oh, what is it for?

4634
03:06:59,380 --> 03:07:01,060
I don't fucking pay for this.

4635
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:09,300
Okay, okay, we can do this.

4636
03:07:09,560 --> 03:07:12,900
We get one last, one last job!

4637
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:16,460
One last job!

4638
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:20,740
Degraded plaster piece, what the fuck is that?

4639
03:07:22,900 --> 03:07:28,400
Okay, iron horde degraded.

4640
03:07:29,260 --> 03:07:33,400
Okay, one last, one last run!

4641
03:07:35,690 --> 03:07:37,520
One last job.

4642
03:07:37,920 --> 03:07:41,220
No, you don't understand, this is so important.

4643
03:07:42,900 --> 03:07:43,100
Okay.

4644
03:07:43,580 --> 03:07:47,520
Okay, degraded plaster piece and fusion comp.

4645
03:07:47,800 --> 03:07:52,500
Guys, one last job and we'll be there.

4646
03:07:55,470 --> 03:08:00,080
We'll be able to do the last job.

4647
03:08:02,770 --> 03:08:04,960
Oh my fucking...

4648
03:08:04,960 --> 03:08:07,440
I can feel it.

4649
03:08:08,550 --> 03:08:11,460
Okay, we're gonna put these guys away.

4650
03:08:11,460 --> 03:08:12,800
And then...

4651
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,260
And then we'll put these guys away.

4652
03:08:17,420 --> 03:08:18,720
And then we should be good.

4653
03:08:19,340 --> 03:08:20,700
We should be good.

4654
03:08:21,380 --> 03:08:21,980
There's...

4655
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:23,660
In the city, right?

4656
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:24,520
In the city.

4657
03:08:24,620 --> 03:08:25,880
Alright, one last job.

4658
03:08:26,360 --> 03:08:27,340
This is it.

4659
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:31,260
One last...

4660
03:08:31,260 --> 03:08:32,360
The...

4661
03:08:32,360 --> 03:08:33,800
The last heist.

4662
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:36,000
The last heist!

4663
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:41,280
This is it.

4664
03:08:41,280 --> 03:08:42,380
I can feel it.

4665
03:08:42,740 --> 03:08:45,440
I can feel the last job!

4666
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:50,720
This is it, I believe.

4667
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:52,440
No, you don't understand.

4668
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:54,360
Guys, it will be so worth it!

4669
03:08:54,540 --> 03:08:56,960
It will be so worth it!

4670
03:08:57,300 --> 03:08:58,720
When we get it!

4671
03:08:58,720 --> 03:08:59,860
You have me at your side.

4672
03:08:59,860 --> 03:09:00,820
I'm at your side.

4673
03:09:00,820 --> 03:09:01,560
I'm at your side.

4674
03:09:03,080 --> 03:09:04,040
I'm at your side.

4675
03:09:04,040 --> 03:09:04,900
It will be fun.

4676
03:09:05,380 --> 03:09:08,300
It will be so worth it!

4677
03:09:08,620 --> 03:09:13,020
Alright, we have three bullets on the shotgun, but we don't need that.

4678
03:09:13,180 --> 03:09:14,280
We don't need that.

4679
03:09:14,780 --> 03:09:15,740
Where's the city?

4680
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:17,100
Where the fuck...

4681
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:18,440
Okay, the city is here.

4682
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:20,780
Okay, one last job.

4683
03:09:21,900 --> 03:09:23,180
One last...

4684
03:09:23,960 --> 03:09:25,960
Guys, we don't need the shotgun!

4685
03:09:26,540 --> 03:09:28,240
We don't need it.

4686
03:09:29,220 --> 03:09:30,400
This is it.

4687
03:09:30,760 --> 03:09:33,520
Oh my god, how the fuck do I...

4688
03:09:34,420 --> 03:09:34,940
Oh...

4689
03:09:34,940 --> 03:09:35,280
Okay.

4690
03:09:37,100 --> 03:09:39,160
Okay, I fucked up a little bit, guys.

4691
03:09:39,260 --> 03:09:40,780
I hope I don't die.

4692
03:09:40,900 --> 03:09:41,320
I need it.

4693
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:42,340
Okay.

4694
03:09:43,580 --> 03:09:45,340
No, you haven't lost me.

4695
03:09:45,380 --> 03:09:46,060
This is it.

4696
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:47,440
Guys!

4697
03:09:48,820 --> 03:09:50,020
It's gonna feel...

4698
03:09:50,020 --> 03:09:53,100
It's gonna feel so good when we fucking do this.

4699
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:53,940
When we...

4700
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:56,720
It's gonna feel so good.

4701
03:09:56,980 --> 03:09:58,200
I swear to god.

4702
03:10:00,460 --> 03:10:01,020
That's fine.

4703
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:06,700
Oh, a rare find.

4704
03:10:06,800 --> 03:10:07,780
Another rare find.

4705
03:10:07,860 --> 03:10:10,040
How many rare finds are we gonna fucking get?

4706
03:10:11,460 --> 03:10:11,980
Okay.

4707
03:10:12,320 --> 03:10:15,840
We don't need to deal with the people.

4708
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:18,440
This is it.

4709
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:20,840
This is fucking it.

4710
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:24,200
If you're in my lobby, I'm in the fucking city.

4711
03:10:24,200 --> 03:10:25,820
I'm heading to the city ruins.

4712
03:10:26,540 --> 03:10:28,220
We don't need the crystals.

4713
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:29,540
We know what we need.

4714
03:10:30,380 --> 03:10:32,300
We know what we fucking need.

4715
03:10:34,900 --> 03:10:35,260
Okay.

4716
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:36,460
But what if I...

4717
03:10:36,920 --> 03:10:37,460
Oh, shit.

4718
03:10:37,540 --> 03:10:37,740
Okay.

4719
03:10:37,840 --> 03:10:38,280
Give me a sec.

4720
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:39,640
Okay.

4721
03:10:39,680 --> 03:10:40,120
He missed.

4722
03:10:40,240 --> 03:10:40,620
That's fine.

4723
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:45,060
All right.

4724
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:45,620
This is it.

4725
03:10:46,140 --> 03:10:46,600
All right.

4726
03:10:46,620 --> 03:10:48,060
We'll get a little bit of crystals.

4727
03:10:51,380 --> 03:10:52,720
I'm trying to get a little crystals.

4728
03:10:52,760 --> 03:10:53,080
All right.

4729
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:54,440
We're getting a little bit of crystals.

4730
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:55,080
Don't worry.

4731
03:10:56,300 --> 03:10:57,020
Don't worry.

4732
03:10:57,200 --> 03:10:57,960
This is it.

4733
03:11:00,140 --> 03:11:01,040
This is it.

4734
03:11:02,700 --> 03:11:03,640
We're so good.

4735
03:11:03,700 --> 03:11:04,020
We're right there.

4736
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:05,300
We're heading to the...

4737
03:11:05,300 --> 03:11:06,500
Oh, shit!

4738
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:07,820
No!

4739
03:11:10,740 --> 03:11:11,860
Ha-ha!

4740
03:11:12,140 --> 03:11:13,020
I forgot!

4741
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:18,480
Oh, my god.

4742
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:21,200
I forgot that was an abandoned boss.

4743
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:23,880
I forgot that was an abandoned boss.

4744
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:24,640
I was like an abandoned boss.

4745
03:11:24,920 --> 03:11:25,560
Who cares?

4746
03:11:26,700 --> 03:11:27,760
Oh, my god.

4747
03:11:27,780 --> 03:11:28,800
That guy was so strong.

4748
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:30,720
Holy shit.

4749
03:11:31,900 --> 03:11:32,460
Okay.

4750
03:11:32,940 --> 03:11:33,420
It's fine.

4751
03:11:33,460 --> 03:11:33,860
We're okay.

4752
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:36,260
We're okay.

4753
03:11:36,260 --> 03:11:36,580
We're okay, guys.

4754
03:11:36,760 --> 03:11:38,280
It's like nothing bad happened.

4755
03:11:38,740 --> 03:11:41,780
It's like nothing bad happened at all.

4756
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:44,400
Okay, nice.

4757
03:11:44,680 --> 03:11:45,420
Oh, hey, ammo.

4758
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:48,680
Guys, look at that.

4759
03:11:48,860 --> 03:11:50,980
I found- I told you I can find ammo.

4760
03:11:51,620 --> 03:11:52,800
I told you guys.

4761
03:11:54,120 --> 03:11:56,160
Oh my god, why did it have to rain?

4762
03:11:56,300 --> 03:11:58,900
Like, I'm already going through a lot, please, ma'am.

4763
03:11:58,900 --> 03:12:04,280
Like, I'm already- I'm already going through a lot, please.

4764
03:12:04,640 --> 03:12:06,260
Like, we- guys.

4765
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:09,700
Just one last job.

4766
03:12:11,460 --> 03:12:12,440
We'll be okay.

4767
03:12:14,560 --> 03:12:17,080
What the fuck is trying to shoot me?

4768
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:20,780
Okay, we just gotta get rid of him.

4769
03:12:22,020 --> 03:12:22,620
Nice.

4770
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:24,360
Okay.

4771
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:28,740
It has to be- We're almost to the city.

4772
03:12:29,800 --> 03:12:30,540
The city ruins.

4773
03:12:31,160 --> 03:12:33,640
We're almost to the promised land.

4774
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:38,720
They told me I can find so many scrap over there.

4775
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:41,940
The promised land is so close.

4776
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:44,540
The promised land.

4777
03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:49,380
No, this is the final heist.

4778
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:51,020
The last job.

4779
03:12:51,160 --> 03:12:52,120
Son of a gun.

4780
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:52,760
I'm in.

4781
03:12:54,020 --> 03:12:56,300
Okay, the city ruins.

4782
03:12:56,420 --> 03:12:57,900
It has to be here.

4783
03:12:58,900 --> 03:13:00,360
It has to be- Exactly.

4784
03:13:01,860 --> 03:13:07,960
They said this is where- They said this is where I can find the stuff.

4785
03:13:10,380 --> 03:13:12,100
Oh my god, maybe it's in the container.

4786
03:13:13,260 --> 03:13:15,060
Maybe it's in the fucking container.

4787
03:13:16,660 --> 03:13:18,440
It has- Is this one of those containers?

4788
03:13:18,700 --> 03:13:19,640
The fable containers?

4789
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:20,100
No.

4790
03:13:20,480 --> 03:13:21,480
Oh wait, there is.

4791
03:13:23,140 --> 03:13:25,840
Okay, no, that's nothing I need, but okay.

4792
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:26,960
Okay.

4793
03:13:29,400 --> 03:13:30,160
Please.

4794
03:13:31,540 --> 03:13:32,300
Alright.

4795
03:13:33,180 --> 03:13:33,520
Alright.

4796
03:13:35,640 --> 03:13:37,420
There has to be stuff in the ruins.

4797
03:13:39,140 --> 03:13:40,420
There's crawlers?

4798
03:13:40,500 --> 03:13:42,360
I don't care about the crawlers.

4799
03:13:42,980 --> 03:13:45,340
Hello, are you- Please!

4800
03:13:47,360 --> 03:13:47,860
Please!

4801
03:13:49,660 --> 03:13:52,320
Please don't do this to me!

4802
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:53,020
I- Please!

4803
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:56,100
I went through so much!

4804
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:02,100
Please, I swear, please.

4805
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:06,220
Oh my god, please.

4806
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:09,100
Please don't do this.

4807
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:12,560
I'm just the fucking- I'm just trying to find my loot.

4808
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:15,540
Why are you so evil?

4809
03:14:16,300 --> 03:14:17,960
Why are you so mean?

4810
03:14:21,600 --> 03:14:23,320
Oh my god, there's a target.

4811
03:14:23,540 --> 03:14:24,560
Oh my god, this is it.

4812
03:14:25,260 --> 03:14:26,460
Oh, I found one.

4813
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:29,440
I found what I need here.

4814
03:14:29,860 --> 03:14:31,600
I'm just a little guy.

4815
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:36,720
I- I'm just a little guy, please.

4816
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:40,700
I swear to god, ow.

4817
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:43,320
Oh, if he shoots me, I'm so fucked.

4818
03:14:43,400 --> 03:14:44,920
If he shoots me, I'm so fucked.

4819
03:14:46,860 --> 03:14:48,200
Oh, thank god.

4820
03:14:48,600 --> 03:14:50,280
Heal me, heal me, girl.

4821
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:53,120
Okay, durability's partially back on track.

4822
03:14:53,480 --> 03:14:56,080
Okay, is this on my- is there my wishlist items?

4823
03:14:56,320 --> 03:14:57,100
I don't kno- no.

4824
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:00,260
The city.

4825
03:15:00,520 --> 03:15:01,140
AO search.

4826
03:15:01,620 --> 03:15:03,240
I'm not detecting any new AO crystal pieces.

4827
03:15:03,240 --> 03:15:04,640
I'm just a little bird.

4828
03:15:04,860 --> 03:15:06,620
I'm trying- Durability has been reduced.

4829
03:15:06,960 --> 03:15:10,380
I'm trying to find the graded plaster piece.

4830
03:15:10,620 --> 03:15:12,320
I found the material where I- Oh, thank god.

4831
03:15:12,660 --> 03:15:13,660
This item is on our wishlist.

4832
03:15:13,720 --> 03:15:14,680
Our fusion core.

4833
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:17,420
AO search.

4834
03:15:17,780 --> 03:15:19,480
I'm not detecting any new AO crystal pieces.

4835
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:21,120
Wait, there's a- there's a chest here.

4836
03:15:21,540 --> 03:15:22,360
Container confirmed.

4837
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:24,920
Okay, scrap.

4838
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:26,360
Maybe they'll be good scrap.

4839
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:27,300
We don't know that.

4840
03:15:27,760 --> 03:15:28,300
AO search.

4841
03:15:28,720 --> 03:15:30,380
I'm not detecting any new AO crystal pieces.

4842
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:30,760
Any more?

4843
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:32,440
Please.

4844
03:15:32,580 --> 03:15:33,980
We have arrived at the city rooms.

4845
03:15:34,400 --> 03:15:36,460
I'm working so hard for her.

4846
03:15:36,660 --> 03:15:37,640
This area is rich with resources.

4847
03:15:38,040 --> 03:15:41,840
I'm working overtime for my lovely anime wife robot.

4848
03:15:43,240 --> 03:15:45,580
No, why does it have to rain?

4849
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:47,940
My- Please.

4850
03:15:49,480 --> 03:15:52,100
All she wants is to get clean.

4851
03:15:53,360 --> 03:15:57,880
I have to do overtime because she deserves it.

4852
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:01,780
She deserves it.

4853
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:03,440
AO search.

4854
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:04,780
I'm not detecting any new AO crystal pieces.

4855
03:16:04,780 --> 03:16:06,560
She deserves everything in life.

4856
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:08,600
The weather's gotten better.

4857
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:10,380
It just rained for one second.

4858
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:11,600
That's actually so fucked.

4859
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:14,820
That's actually so fucked.

4860
03:16:16,120 --> 03:16:17,840
There has to be...

4861
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:21,720
AO search.

4862
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:24,600
Where is- I'm not detecting any new AO crystal readings.

4863
03:16:24,820 --> 03:16:31,900
Where is- Where is the- Oh my god, I literally need like degraded- Guys, where is the easiest place to find degraded plaster piece?

4864
03:16:32,220 --> 03:16:33,880
Is it still the city ruins?

4865
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:37,780
Please tell me there's like another area.

4866
03:16:39,420 --> 03:16:41,000
Do it for her, guys.

4867
03:16:41,540 --> 03:16:42,900
Do it for her!

4868
03:16:43,640 --> 03:16:44,400
AO search.

4869
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,040
AO crystal detected.

4870
03:16:46,580 --> 03:16:48,120
Nothing to note about size.

4871
03:16:49,140 --> 03:16:49,940
Training grounds?

4872
03:16:50,220 --> 03:16:51,820
Where the- Okay, training arena.

4873
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:52,160
Okay.

4874
03:16:52,820 --> 03:16:53,220
Peter.

4875
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:54,480
There it is.

4876
03:16:54,580 --> 03:16:55,260
Training arena.

4877
03:16:56,420 --> 03:16:58,480
Okay, we're gonna head to the training arena.

4878
03:16:58,900 --> 03:16:59,880
When we get there.

4879
03:16:59,980 --> 03:17:00,920
Oh hey, barrel crystals.

4880
03:17:01,220 --> 03:17:02,880
I don't know, maybe we'll need it in the end.

4881
03:17:03,440 --> 03:17:04,700
How do I get there?

4882
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:07,980
How do I get out of this fucking hole that I dug myself in?

4883
03:17:08,300 --> 03:17:09,020
Hit confirmed.

4884
03:17:09,780 --> 03:17:10,420
Okay, nice.

4885
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:11,120
Nice aim.

4886
03:17:11,540 --> 03:17:13,100
Ender has sustained damage.

4887
03:17:13,140 --> 03:17:13,460
Okay.

4888
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:14,660
Pass me here.

4889
03:17:15,460 --> 03:17:17,660
Oh my god, how the fuck do I get out of this hole?

4890
03:17:18,120 --> 03:17:21,240
I'm behind- Oh my god, there's no- AO crystal detected.

4891
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:23,100
Curity has passed.

4892
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:24,540
The last dice.

4893
03:17:25,060 --> 03:17:27,160
No, there's no way to get out of this hole!

4894
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:28,140
Wait, there is!

4895
03:17:28,300 --> 03:17:29,020
There is!

4896
03:17:29,020 --> 03:17:30,100
I'll jump for you!

4897
03:17:30,900 --> 03:17:33,260
I'll jump for you, ma'am!

4898
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:34,400
This is it.

4899
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:38,020
Guys, I can't get out of the hole!

4900
03:17:38,420 --> 03:17:41,180
I can't even get out of this hole!

4901
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:43,540
I- City ruins.

4902
03:17:44,540 --> 03:17:48,100
I'll be stuck in the goddamn city ruins for 20 years.

4903
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:49,420
What better place to escape?

4904
03:17:49,900 --> 03:17:51,880
I'll never leave the ruins.

4905
03:17:52,960 --> 03:17:54,520
I'll be here forever.

4906
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:56,260
Keep on fighting a little longer now.

4907
03:17:56,360 --> 03:17:57,480
Wait, there it is!

4908
03:17:57,780 --> 03:17:58,600
There's up!

4909
03:17:59,660 --> 03:18:00,540
Wait, what's this?

4910
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:04,880
Oh, it's- Goddammit, it's regular plastic!

4911
03:18:05,860 --> 03:18:07,540
I don't need regular plastic!

4912
03:18:07,820 --> 03:18:11,460
I need- Though combat is unlikely, I'll analyze just in case.

4913
03:18:11,480 --> 03:18:12,560
I need fucking...

4914
03:18:13,720 --> 03:18:14,280
degraded!

4915
03:18:15,220 --> 03:18:17,180
Please, please, I'm so sorry.

4916
03:18:17,180 --> 03:18:19,340
The monsters are currently excavating AO Crystals.

4917
03:18:19,760 --> 03:18:21,120
Okay, you can have them.

4918
03:18:23,160 --> 03:18:24,040
Crawler defeated.

4919
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:25,960
You can have it.

4920
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:27,700
I'm just trying to get out of this pit.

4921
03:18:28,120 --> 03:18:31,820
I'm fucking baiting it up right now, trying to find the exit.

4922
03:18:32,960 --> 03:18:36,500
I'm trying to climb out of the fucking pit right now.

4923
03:18:36,740 --> 03:18:37,900
There's a target?

4924
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:41,540
Oh my god, there's a degraded!

4925
03:18:41,720 --> 03:18:43,400
Oh, we did it!

4926
03:18:43,480 --> 03:18:45,500
Guys, we found one.

4927
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:51,760
We- Why is the world so cruel?

4928
03:18:52,580 --> 03:18:52,820
I-

4929
03:18:55,920 --> 03:18:57,200
Oh shit!

4930
03:18:58,420 --> 03:18:59,700
Oh shit!

4931
03:19:00,200 --> 03:19:00,720
Fuck!

4932
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:02,020
Okay, there you go, it's fine.

4933
03:19:02,340 --> 03:19:03,140
It's fine.

4934
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:04,660
Good target.

4935
03:19:05,720 --> 03:19:07,120
Okay, that's fine, man.

4936
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:11,420
This isn't- I'm trying to get out of the city ruins!

4937
03:19:12,100 --> 03:19:14,860
I'm not even trying to be here anymore!

4938
03:19:15,500 --> 03:19:17,520
I'm trying to get out!

4939
03:19:20,200 --> 03:19:21,700
Oh my god.

4940
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:25,820
How the fuck do I get the- God!

4941
03:19:26,260 --> 03:19:27,680
Oh shit!

4942
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:33,420
Guys, when you pause the video game, it doesn't pause the game.

4943
03:19:33,620 --> 03:19:35,200
I don't know if you know that.

4944
03:19:38,280 --> 03:19:41,320
You can't pause the video game with that.

4945
03:19:43,240 --> 03:19:47,220
Oh my god, I feel like I've been stuck here for 20 years.

4946
03:19:47,380 --> 03:20:00,840
I- I- I- I- I- I - I- I- I- I- I- I- I - I - I- Please, I do.

4947
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:10,200
Oh my god, I don't even want- I don't have ammo!

4948
03:20:10,320 --> 03:20:14,580
I've been stuck here for 20 years that I have to use up all my ammo!

4949
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:17,800
I'm stuck here with the super chat.

4950
03:20:17,940 --> 03:20:20,320
How do I get to the training area?

4951
03:20:21,400 --> 03:20:26,320
Please, I need- I need three pieces.

4952
03:20:27,020 --> 03:20:28,900
I need three pieces.

4953
03:20:30,920 --> 03:20:31,440
Please!

4954
03:20:31,860 --> 03:20:32,380
Please!

4955
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:35,220
Are you- Oh my god!

4956
03:20:35,400 --> 03:20:36,680
P-Tink-Tink.

4957
03:20:37,240 --> 03:20:37,760
Hello.

4958
03:20:38,200 --> 03:20:38,700
Hello.

4959
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:42,740
I wish I could pipe.

4960
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:44,000
Sure.

4961
03:20:47,140 --> 03:20:48,820
Oh my god, do you have items?

4962
03:20:48,880 --> 03:20:49,880
Are you a dragoon?

4963
03:20:50,180 --> 03:20:52,620
Please drop your- Are you a dragoon?

4964
03:20:53,020 --> 03:20:54,360
Are you a dragoon?

4965
03:20:54,380 --> 03:20:56,160
Please drop- Please!

4966
03:20:56,420 --> 03:20:58,440
Please give me your fucking pipe!

4967
03:20:58,540 --> 03:20:58,880
Please!

4968
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:01,260
Please, for the love of god, give me your pipe!

4969
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:04,360
This is the only reason why I'm- No!

4970
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:06,340
No!

4971
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:08,580
They're just a regular person!

4972
03:21:12,020 --> 03:21:14,960
I don't want to do your fucking mission!

4973
03:21:15,320 --> 03:21:17,840
I'm trying to find my pipe!

4974
03:21:18,520 --> 03:21:19,860
I- No!

4975
03:21:21,420 --> 03:21:22,140
No!

4976
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:24,560
You're just a regular fucking person.

4977
03:21:24,580 --> 03:21:26,660
Now to do your stupid fucking mission!

4978
03:21:27,060 --> 03:21:28,140
I- No!

4979
03:21:28,140 --> 03:21:28,860
No!

4980
03:21:31,320 --> 03:21:32,100
No!

4981
03:21:33,560 --> 03:21:35,900
I don't want to do this stupid mission.

4982
03:21:36,220 --> 03:21:37,980
Oh my god.

4983
03:21:38,640 --> 03:21:39,320
Please- No!

4984
03:21:39,520 --> 03:21:42,760
No, not that!

4985
03:21:43,060 --> 03:21:43,640
Please, I'm sorry.

4986
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:45,740
What, am I?

4987
03:21:45,820 --> 03:21:46,600
I'm sorry.

4988
03:21:46,740 --> 03:21:47,000
Please, don't do this to me!

4989
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:48,200
I can't do this!

4990
03:21:48,820 --> 03:21:51,200
Oh my god.

4991
03:21:51,340 --> 03:21:52,120
Please, don't!

4992
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:52,840
Please, don't!

4993
03:21:52,840 --> 03:21:53,900
Oh my god, it was dumb.

4994
03:21:54,200 --> 03:21:54,480
Yes!

4995
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:55,040
Oh my god.

4996
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:55,060
Please, no!

4997
03:21:55,140 --> 03:21:55,240
Please, no!

4998
03:21:55,280 --> 03:21:55,680
Please, no!

4999
03:21:56,020 --> 03:21:57,580
Please, no!

5000
03:21:58,760 --> 03:21:58,840
Please!

5001
03:21:59,920 --> 03:22:03,920
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

5002
03:22:07,740 --> 03:22:08,460
No!

5003
03:22:09,300 --> 03:22:10,020
Shit!

5004
03:22:10,060 --> 03:22:11,200
I turned away!

5005
03:22:12,600 --> 03:22:14,800
Oh my god, I turned away.

5006
03:22:16,440 --> 03:22:19,440
Please, I'm going through so much more now.

5007
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:22,760
Oh my god, I'll help.

5008
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:23,520
I'll help.

5009
03:22:24,780 --> 03:22:25,500
Nevermind.

5010
03:22:29,560 --> 03:22:30,200
Okay.

5011
03:22:31,100 --> 03:22:33,120
Please, I have two bullets.

5012
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:33,500
Please.

5013
03:22:33,560 --> 03:22:36,200
I have two bullets.

5014
03:22:36,300 --> 03:22:37,960
Don't do this to me.

5015
03:22:38,060 --> 03:22:40,160
Please, I have zero bullets.

5016
03:22:40,500 --> 03:22:44,360
I don't have the ammo.

5017
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:44,900
Please.

5018
03:22:45,820 --> 03:22:50,260
I don't have friends.

5019
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:51,960
Oh my god.

5020
03:22:52,020 --> 03:22:53,460
I thought I was on the triangle.

5021
03:22:53,700 --> 03:22:56,680
This is the only reason why I said yes.

5022
03:22:57,060 --> 03:22:58,200
It's so...

5023
03:22:58,880 --> 03:23:01,400
This is the only reason why I said yes.

5024
03:23:01,400 --> 03:23:02,420
All missions complete.

5025
03:23:02,720 --> 03:23:04,300
Oh my god.

5026
03:23:04,300 --> 03:23:06,660
It doesn't even...

5027
03:23:06,660 --> 03:23:09,060
We'll work together again sometime.

5028
03:23:09,620 --> 03:23:11,660
We'll work together again sometime.

5029
03:23:11,660 --> 03:23:12,900
We'll work together again sometime.

5030
03:23:14,900 --> 03:23:18,920
He didn't even have the plastic piece.

5031
03:23:19,240 --> 03:23:19,640
He didn't even have the plastic piece.

5032
03:23:19,700 --> 03:23:21,220
Jesus Christ.

5033
03:23:21,380 --> 03:23:24,660
I'm thinking I'm going through so much right now.

5034
03:23:24,820 --> 03:23:26,920
I don't even have the ammo now.

5035
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:28,860
I don't even have the ammo now.

5036
03:23:28,860 --> 03:23:30,860
This isn't fun.

5037
03:23:31,480 --> 03:23:34,120
I just wanted to do one last job.

5038
03:23:37,140 --> 03:23:38,980
You helped a friend in need.

5039
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:40,840
What about me?!

5040
03:23:41,480 --> 03:23:43,060
What about me?!

5041
03:23:46,440 --> 03:23:55,460
Oh my god, please tell me, Oh my god, please tell me You have

5042
03:23:59,580 --> 03:24:02,000
What does it look like?

5043
03:24:02,760 --> 03:24:04,440
Are you serious?

5044
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:07,840
He doesn't have... He doesn't have it!

5045
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:13,260
And now it's... Oh my god, he doesn't have... Wait, it does?

5046
03:24:13,400 --> 03:24:14,780
It has fusion compound!

5047
03:24:15,140 --> 03:24:16,120
I need...

5048
03:24:16,800 --> 03:24:17,780
What do I need?

5049
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:18,620
What is it called again?

5050
03:24:19,200 --> 03:24:20,360
Guys, what is it called?

5051
03:24:20,560 --> 03:24:21,240
I don't remember.

5052
03:24:21,720 --> 03:24:23,320
Wait, is there... What is it called?

5053
03:24:23,580 --> 03:24:25,420
I actually don't remember what it's called.

5054
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:27,820
They created plastic piece?

5055
03:24:27,900 --> 03:24:28,200
Okay.

5056
03:24:29,240 --> 03:24:29,960
So this?

5057
03:24:30,400 --> 03:24:31,520
What does it look like?

5058
03:24:31,840 --> 03:24:32,600
No damage.

5059
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:33,840
No, please.

5060
03:24:33,920 --> 03:24:35,100
I don't know what it looks like.

5061
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:36,180
What does it look like, guys?

5062
03:24:36,260 --> 03:24:37,220
What does it look like?

5063
03:24:37,260 --> 03:24:38,660
What does it look like?

5064
03:24:40,980 --> 03:24:43,980
What does the plastic piece look like?

5065
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:45,100
I can't find it!

5066
03:24:49,860 --> 03:24:51,060
It's like a pipe.

5067
03:24:51,140 --> 03:24:51,940
Then it's not it!

5068
03:24:52,040 --> 03:24:55,400
It's a plastic... It's just a normal... It's just a normal plastic...

5069
03:24:55,400 --> 03:24:56,120
Oh, I should take the ammo.

5070
03:24:56,200 --> 03:24:56,560
You're right.

5071
03:24:56,780 --> 03:24:57,960
I should take the ammo.

5072
03:24:58,040 --> 03:24:59,040
I need this.

5073
03:24:59,300 --> 03:25:02,380
And I need... I need this.

5074
03:25:03,080 --> 03:25:03,480
Okay.

5075
03:25:05,540 --> 03:25:06,440
I knew it.

5076
03:25:06,480 --> 03:25:07,540
I knew they didn't have it.

5077
03:25:07,580 --> 03:25:08,640
I'll fucking take this though.

5078
03:25:09,320 --> 03:25:10,400
Fucking hell yeah.

5079
03:25:15,100 --> 03:25:17,820
Wait, I should take their... I should take their fusion compound.

5080
03:25:18,660 --> 03:25:19,200
Okay.

5081
03:25:19,320 --> 03:25:21,180
Oh, thank God somebody died here.

5082
03:25:21,300 --> 03:25:22,540
Thank fucking God.

5083
03:25:22,680 --> 03:25:23,220
Okay.

5084
03:25:24,960 --> 03:25:26,040
Thank God.

5085
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:28,480
Holy shit.

5086
03:25:28,620 --> 03:25:31,620
At least I have zero ammo still.

5087
03:25:32,040 --> 03:25:33,620
Like... Oh, I should take their gun.

5088
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:34,160
You're right.

5089
03:25:34,420 --> 03:25:36,180
I have ammo for their gun.

5090
03:25:38,500 --> 03:25:39,040
Okay.

5091
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:44,040
I'm gonna take... Oh, I should take this shotgun.

5092
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:48,460
And then I'll take their... What ammo do I have?

5093
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:49,140
I have an assault rifle.

5094
03:25:49,280 --> 03:25:50,280
I'll take their assault rifle.

5095
03:25:50,660 --> 03:25:51,380
I'll take this.

5096
03:25:52,220 --> 03:25:54,060
I don't think they know.

5097
03:25:54,800 --> 03:25:56,800
I don't think... Oh, wait.

5098
03:25:56,840 --> 03:25:57,200
You're right.

5099
03:25:57,280 --> 03:25:57,920
I have to heal.

5100
03:25:58,320 --> 03:25:59,300
You're so right.

5101
03:25:59,380 --> 03:26:01,180
I'm going through so much right now.

5102
03:26:01,300 --> 03:26:05,400
I'm going through so fucking much right now.

5103
03:26:06,120 --> 03:26:06,600
Okay.

5104
03:26:06,680 --> 03:26:08,380
I have... Wait.

5105
03:26:08,420 --> 03:26:09,220
None of... Wait.

5106
03:26:09,280 --> 03:26:10,980
I don't have ammo for any... Oh, wait.

5107
03:26:11,020 --> 03:26:11,300
I do.

5108
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:11,680
83.

5109
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:12,180
Okay.

5110
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:14,000
I'm gonna remove this.

5111
03:26:15,100 --> 03:26:16,800
At least I'll have ammo somewhere.

5112
03:26:17,440 --> 03:26:19,820
At least I'll have ammo somewhere.

5113
03:26:20,460 --> 03:26:21,100
Alright.

5114
03:26:22,820 --> 03:26:24,180
Oh my God.

5115
03:26:26,740 --> 03:26:27,640
Oh no.

5116
03:26:27,800 --> 03:26:29,120
That's the... Okay.

5117
03:26:29,180 --> 03:26:31,440
We gotta not let that guy hurt us.

5118
03:26:32,620 --> 03:26:33,260
Okay.

5119
03:26:33,400 --> 03:26:34,600
Oh my God.

5120
03:26:34,660 --> 03:26:37,260
Is this... Is this another dead person?

5121
03:26:38,040 --> 03:26:39,180
Oh, it is.

5122
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:40,840
It is.

5123
03:26:41,120 --> 03:26:42,540
Do you have ammo?

5124
03:26:42,680 --> 03:26:43,880
You don't have...

5125
03:26:43,880 --> 03:26:44,900
You do.

5126
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:46,080
Oh my God.

5127
03:26:46,260 --> 03:26:48,140
He died to the rain.

5128
03:26:48,380 --> 03:26:49,560
And that's gonna be me.

5129
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:52,100
Because I can't find cover.

5130
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:54,440
Oh my God.

5131
03:26:54,440 --> 03:26:54,740
Please.

5132
03:26:56,520 --> 03:26:58,040
That's gonna be me.

5133
03:26:58,140 --> 03:27:00,640
Because I don't know where cover is.

5134
03:27:02,260 --> 03:27:03,240
Oh my God.

5135
03:27:03,280 --> 03:27:04,200
I have ammo.

5136
03:27:05,700 --> 03:27:07,080
I'm fucking rich.

5137
03:27:09,640 --> 03:27:10,520
We have hope.

5138
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:11,280
I told you.

5139
03:27:11,280 --> 03:27:12,960
I told you, everybody.

5140
03:27:13,140 --> 03:27:14,440
This will be the last...

5141
03:27:14,440 --> 03:27:16,240
The last job.

5142
03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:17,560
The final heist.

5143
03:27:18,340 --> 03:27:19,040
Aluminum scrap.

5144
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:19,740
I'll take that.

5145
03:27:20,760 --> 03:27:21,280
Okay.

5146
03:27:21,280 --> 03:27:22,520
I don't need any of this.

5147
03:27:22,860 --> 03:27:25,720
I don't need any of this.

5148
03:27:26,540 --> 03:27:27,460
It's so close.

5149
03:27:27,580 --> 03:27:28,660
I can feel it.

5150
03:27:28,820 --> 03:27:29,320
Wait.

5151
03:27:29,320 --> 03:27:29,920
This is it.

5152
03:27:31,340 --> 03:27:31,860
Please.

5153
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:35,220
Abandoned boss?

5154
03:27:37,700 --> 03:27:40,060
Oh, thank God.

5155
03:27:40,120 --> 03:27:40,360
Okay.

5156
03:27:40,400 --> 03:27:41,260
There's no actual boss.

5157
03:27:41,260 --> 03:27:41,720
Abandoned boss.

5158
03:27:41,880 --> 03:27:42,060
Okay.

5159
03:27:42,140 --> 03:27:42,540
That's good.

5160
03:27:42,820 --> 03:27:43,500
That's good.

5161
03:27:45,680 --> 03:27:46,200
Guys.

5162
03:27:46,400 --> 03:27:46,720
Okay.

5163
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:48,720
This might not be the final, final job.

5164
03:27:49,160 --> 03:27:50,580
Because we still need to...

5165
03:27:51,220 --> 03:27:53,380
We still need to find the gun.

5166
03:27:56,060 --> 03:27:56,580
Guys.

5167
03:27:57,880 --> 03:27:58,400
Guys.

5168
03:27:58,620 --> 03:27:59,380
Where is...

5169
03:27:59,380 --> 03:28:02,100
Where can I find degraded plastic piece?

5170
03:28:03,880 --> 03:28:04,400
Chat.

5171
03:28:05,320 --> 03:28:06,180
Where is...

5172
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:10,860
Where is the place most likely for degraded plastic piece?

5173
03:28:10,860 --> 03:28:12,880
Is it actually the training area?

5174
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:17,340
Do I have to go all the way over here?

5175
03:28:17,860 --> 03:28:19,300
It's all done.

5176
03:28:20,500 --> 03:28:20,980
Okay.

5177
03:28:21,800 --> 03:28:22,280
Alright.

5178
03:28:22,440 --> 03:28:23,400
New adventure.

5179
03:28:28,700 --> 03:28:30,120
New adventure.

5180
03:28:33,400 --> 03:28:34,840
New adventure.

5181
03:28:35,800 --> 03:28:36,280
Alright.

5182
03:28:36,980 --> 03:28:38,500
Newest adventure.

5183
03:28:38,880 --> 03:28:40,680
All the way.

5184
03:28:42,020 --> 03:28:42,540
No.

5185
03:28:42,660 --> 03:28:43,200
It's fine.

5186
03:28:43,900 --> 03:28:44,720
It's fine.

5187
03:28:44,860 --> 03:28:45,580
This is it.

5188
03:28:46,780 --> 03:28:47,900
I told you.

5189
03:28:47,900 --> 03:28:48,860
The last job.

5190
03:28:49,980 --> 03:28:51,620
The last job.

5191
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:53,980
13 minutes is plenty of time.

5192
03:28:55,780 --> 03:28:58,120
It's plenty of enough time, guys.

5193
03:28:58,220 --> 03:28:59,600
This is the final job.

5194
03:29:01,480 --> 03:29:02,000
Okay.

5195
03:29:02,840 --> 03:29:04,040
We'll figure this out.

5196
03:29:04,100 --> 03:29:04,780
I swear to God.

5197
03:29:04,820 --> 03:29:07,140
If he shoots me after everything I've been through.

5198
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:08,480
Please don't be that mean.

5199
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:11,200
Oh, please.

5200
03:29:15,720 --> 03:29:17,240
Oh, please.

5201
03:29:17,340 --> 03:29:19,460
Just pretend I don't exist.

5202
03:29:20,240 --> 03:29:21,000
Please.

5203
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:22,280
We're so close.

5204
03:29:23,620 --> 03:29:26,260
We won't get killed by the raid.

5205
03:29:27,200 --> 03:29:29,180
There's still hope for us.

5206
03:29:29,320 --> 03:29:31,600
There's still so much hope.

5207
03:29:35,040 --> 03:29:37,060
It's gonna be so worth it.

5208
03:29:37,060 --> 03:29:40,520
You guys are gonna love what I'm gonna do after.

5209
03:29:40,720 --> 03:29:42,860
It's gonna be so worth it, guys.

5210
03:29:43,020 --> 03:29:44,740
Like, it's the journey.

5211
03:29:44,820 --> 03:29:47,160
It's the end that matters.

5212
03:29:50,380 --> 03:29:52,500
It's gonna be so worth it.

5213
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:54,680
There's no way.

5214
03:29:54,860 --> 03:29:56,820
There's no way I did all that.

5215
03:29:57,080 --> 03:29:58,000
And then...

5216
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:01,240
There's no way it'll be...

5217
03:30:01,240 --> 03:30:02,580
It'll be so worth it.

5218
03:30:02,860 --> 03:30:04,680
I can feel the bathroom.

5219
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:05,220
I...

5220
03:30:05,220 --> 03:30:10,560
I detect the faint sound of an engine.

5221
03:30:10,660 --> 03:30:14,160
How did I not find a single fucking...

5222
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:14,800
Oh my God.

5223
03:30:14,820 --> 03:30:16,120
I'm not going back to the city.

5224
03:30:16,240 --> 03:30:16,860
I can't.

5225
03:30:17,460 --> 03:30:19,320
I can't do this to myself.

5226
03:30:19,700 --> 03:30:21,920
I can't go back to the city, guys.

5227
03:30:22,420 --> 03:30:23,500
I... I can't.

5228
03:30:24,820 --> 03:30:26,840
I can't do the city again.

5229
03:30:26,940 --> 03:30:28,180
I'm... I cannot.

5230
03:30:29,820 --> 03:30:31,760
Okay, we're gonna go through this way.

5231
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:34,400
This has to be the way to go to the training area.

5232
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:36,340
There... There...

5233
03:30:36,340 --> 03:30:38,700
This has to be the only way.

5234
03:30:40,140 --> 03:30:41,480
How do I select it?

5235
03:30:43,080 --> 03:30:46,000
I can't move my map out of the area.

5236
03:30:46,960 --> 03:30:48,920
I... I can't.

5237
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:52,080
How do I move it out of the area?

5238
03:30:55,040 --> 03:30:56,160
This is it.

5239
03:30:56,280 --> 03:30:57,200
I feel...

5240
03:31:01,200 --> 03:31:02,360
I feel it.

5241
03:31:04,400 --> 03:31:05,160
I feel it right here.

5242
03:31:05,300 --> 03:31:06,560
I'm almost...

5243
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:09,080
Oh my God.

5244
03:31:09,460 --> 03:31:10,700
Oh my God.

5245
03:31:10,720 --> 03:31:12,200
That's not what I need!

5246
03:31:13,240 --> 03:31:14,360
That is...

5247
03:31:17,760 --> 03:31:20,960
I heard... I found the material and I got...

5248
03:31:20,960 --> 03:31:23,120
I felt hope for like one second.

5249
03:31:23,940 --> 03:31:26,840
I legitimately felt hope for one second, guys.

5250
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:31,620
I was like, oh my God, is that...

5251
03:31:32,220 --> 03:31:33,260
Is that it?

5252
03:31:35,920 --> 03:31:36,940
Is that it?

5253
03:31:38,540 --> 03:31:39,040
Okay.

5254
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:40,840
All right.

5255
03:31:40,880 --> 03:31:41,300
Here we go.

5256
03:31:41,740 --> 03:31:43,660
We're almost to the training area.

5257
03:31:44,140 --> 03:31:46,340
Holy shit, we're so close to the training area.

5258
03:31:46,460 --> 03:31:49,880
And we have an escape point right next to us.

5259
03:31:50,800 --> 03:31:52,800
Nothing can fuck with us now.

5260
03:31:54,200 --> 03:31:56,400
There... Oh my God, it's literally right there.

5261
03:31:56,780 --> 03:31:57,280
.....

5262
03:31:58,120 --> 03:31:59,060
Right there.

5263
03:31:59,080 --> 03:31:59,740
Nine minutes.

5264
03:31:59,820 --> 03:32:01,200
We have a training area.

5265
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:04,880
The escape route is right next to us!

5266
03:32:06,780 --> 03:32:09,680
It's literally right next to us!

5267
03:32:13,880 --> 03:32:15,400
Okay, this is it.

5268
03:32:16,240 --> 03:32:17,360
This is it.

5269
03:32:19,180 --> 03:32:20,600
We're here in the train!

5270
03:32:21,740 --> 03:32:23,200
Am I here in the train?

5271
03:32:23,560 --> 03:32:26,500
Oh my god, I'm not even close to the training area yet.

5272
03:32:26,620 --> 03:32:28,700
Are you- are you fucking kidding me?

5273
03:32:28,800 --> 03:32:29,140
Like...

5274
03:32:29,140 --> 03:32:30,860
Are you fucking kidding me?

5275
03:32:30,920 --> 03:32:32,020
I have to walk all the way there.

5276
03:32:32,140 --> 03:32:32,640
It's okay.

5277
03:32:32,860 --> 03:32:35,160
Okay, give a five-minute walk mark.

5278
03:32:35,340 --> 03:32:37,760
We're gonna have to run to the escape port.

5279
03:32:39,880 --> 03:32:40,900
This is it.

5280
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:42,220
We're here.

5281
03:32:45,380 --> 03:32:46,680
This is it.

5282
03:32:46,780 --> 03:32:47,400
We're here.

5283
03:32:51,080 --> 03:32:52,400
This is it.

5284
03:32:53,320 --> 03:32:56,820
Where- where is it?

5285
03:32:57,960 --> 03:32:59,080
Where are the materials?

5286
03:32:59,080 --> 03:32:59,120
Where are the materials?

5287
03:32:59,120 --> 03:32:59,120
Where are the materials?

5288
03:32:59,120 --> 03:32:59,120
Where are the materials?

5289
03:33:01,700 --> 03:33:02,500
Where are the materials?

5290
03:33:02,500 --> 03:33:04,920
Where is the materials that I must seek?

5291
03:33:07,880 --> 03:33:10,700
Where are the materials that I seek?

5292
03:33:11,700 --> 03:33:14,760
Please, no.

5293
03:33:16,810 --> 03:33:18,300
What the fuck is that?

5294
03:33:18,460 --> 03:33:20,840
Okay, alright, we walk this way now.

5295
03:33:21,020 --> 03:33:22,880
We walk this way now.

5296
03:33:22,880 --> 03:33:23,540
Okay.

5297
03:33:23,820 --> 03:33:26,360
We walk this way.

5298
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:29,840
Alright, that's- that's fine.

5299
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:33,560
Wait, is that- is that it?

5300
03:33:34,060 --> 03:33:38,640
Oh my god, is that- it's a sniper rifle grade bullshit!

5301
03:33:39,340 --> 03:33:44,740
It's a sniper rifle grade- aww, I don't have cover because there's fucking holes everywhere!

5302
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:48,320
There's like holes everywhere!

5303
03:33:50,600 --> 03:33:54,680
How is there no- I swear, I went to the training area.

5304
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:59,080
I swear to god, there's- there's other stuff!

5305
03:33:59,380 --> 03:34:01,040
There's other stuff!

5306
03:34:01,500 --> 03:34:02,560
Is this cover?

5307
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:04,700
I can't, I'm too tired.

5308
03:34:04,780 --> 03:34:05,660
I'm overheated.

5309
03:34:05,660 --> 03:34:07,840
I can't even get cover if I want to.

5310
03:34:07,880 --> 03:34:08,600
I'm too tired.

5311
03:34:10,920 --> 03:34:11,480
Okay.

5312
03:34:12,940 --> 03:34:15,440
This is- this is a grenade.

5313
03:34:15,640 --> 03:34:16,460
This is a frame.

5314
03:34:22,200 --> 03:34:24,240
Oh my god, there's you.

5315
03:34:24,440 --> 03:34:25,300
I need two.

5316
03:34:26,760 --> 03:34:27,800
Holy fuck.

5317
03:34:28,500 --> 03:34:29,020
Okay.

5318
03:34:30,860 --> 03:34:31,600
Don't worry.

5319
03:34:32,160 --> 03:34:34,600
There has to be just- no, no, no!

5320
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:36,000
We're gonna do this!

5321
03:34:36,180 --> 03:34:39,140
We're gonna find- we're gonna find it.

5322
03:34:39,220 --> 03:34:41,620
At the five minute mark, we'll leave.

5323
03:34:41,740 --> 03:34:43,700
Oh my god, I'm just gonna get to this.

5324
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:45,300
We lost it.

5325
03:34:46,100 --> 03:34:47,120
It's too easy.

5326
03:34:51,620 --> 03:34:52,940
We're so close, guys.

5327
03:34:53,920 --> 03:34:56,320
At the five- we leave at five minutes!

5328
03:34:56,600 --> 03:35:00,980
We'll make it to the extraction point when we have five minutes of that!

5329
03:35:02,020 --> 03:35:03,280
Okay, we'll extract.

5330
03:35:04,460 --> 03:35:08,220
After our last job, we are literally missing two more.

5331
03:35:09,820 --> 03:35:13,060
Are you ser- please stop raining on me!

5332
03:35:15,780 --> 03:35:21,220
Oh my god, maybe by the time I head home, maybe I'll- maybe I'll- Oh, thank you!

5333
03:35:21,500 --> 03:35:23,720
The graded plastic pieces!

5334
03:35:24,000 --> 03:35:26,100
You know, maybe- maybe it'll happen!

5335
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:28,660
Maybe it'll happen.

5336
03:35:28,780 --> 03:35:29,760
You don't know.

5337
03:35:30,740 --> 03:35:33,380
Oh my god, there's a container here.

5338
03:35:34,340 --> 03:35:36,560
Oh my god, maybe there's plastic pieces.

5339
03:35:37,540 --> 03:35:40,440
There's- there's just waste gra- oh, that's fine.

5340
03:35:40,760 --> 03:35:43,640
I- I didn't need that.

5341
03:35:43,700 --> 03:35:44,420
That's fine.

5342
03:35:45,300 --> 03:35:47,540
Why is it still raining?!

5343
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:48,760
Why?!

5344
03:35:51,220 --> 03:35:59,400
Oh my god, I just realized I can't- Oh my god, I have to get out of here to get there because that's a military base!

5345
03:36:01,480 --> 03:36:02,840
Oh my god, please.

5346
03:36:03,180 --> 03:36:04,600
It's literally right here.

5347
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:07,200
It's literally right here.

5348
03:36:07,300 --> 03:36:11,460
I've been- I've been trapped in this world for so long.

5349
03:36:14,540 --> 03:36:16,420
I'm overheated, I'm tired.

5350
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:20,320
I- I need- Oh my god, Andy!

5351
03:36:20,320 --> 03:36:27,500
Andy, are you- are you- please, Andy, I wish I could just type in chat and be like, please, plastic pieces, please.

5352
03:36:27,580 --> 03:36:32,760
I just wanna type in chat and be like, plastic pieces, please.

5353
03:36:33,300 --> 03:36:35,080
This is a rough world.

5354
03:36:35,180 --> 03:36:37,060
This is such a rough world.

5355
03:36:38,200 --> 03:36:39,660
It's so rough.

5356
03:36:42,240 --> 03:36:43,720
Oh my god.

5357
03:36:43,980 --> 03:36:45,920
Guys- guys, one last job.

5358
03:36:46,140 --> 03:36:49,120
The- the last- the final last job.

5359
03:36:49,120 --> 03:36:50,260
I swear to god.

5360
03:36:50,820 --> 03:36:51,900
I swear.

5361
03:36:52,200 --> 03:36:54,120
In between the road tunnels?

5362
03:36:54,500 --> 03:36:55,220
Where's west?

5363
03:36:55,940 --> 03:36:57,420
On the west side?

5364
03:36:57,940 --> 03:36:58,980
That's left side.

5365
03:36:59,200 --> 03:37:01,040
Why did you make me go to the training area?

5366
03:37:01,340 --> 03:37:02,300
What do you mean?

5367
03:37:02,380 --> 03:37:03,680
This is the west side!

5368
03:37:04,560 --> 03:37:06,700
Where would it be on the west side?

5369
03:37:07,720 --> 03:37:08,280
Okay.

5370
03:37:09,560 --> 03:37:12,220
This is the west side!

5371
03:37:14,260 --> 03:37:15,740
The- the- the- the east side!

5372
03:37:15,740 --> 03:37:17,420
This- this is the west side!

5373
03:37:17,420 --> 03:37:17,840
Okay, guys.

5374
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:22,520
It's making me laugh.

5375
03:37:22,600 --> 03:37:22,760
Holy.

5376
03:37:22,760 --> 03:37:22,980
It's making me laugh!

5377
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:23,480
That's the east side!

5378
03:37:24,860 --> 03:37:29,880
That's the east side.

5379
03:37:29,880 --> 03:37:29,880
Mom!

5380
03:37:30,420 --> 03:37:32,360
We're actually so close!

5381
03:37:38,210 --> 03:37:42,250
Trust me, guys.

5382
03:37:44,590 --> 03:37:45,310
Like...

5383
03:37:45,310 --> 03:37:47,690
It's gonna be so worth it.

5384
03:37:47,770 --> 03:37:50,510
I swear to God, it's gonna be so worth it.

5385
03:37:50,630 --> 03:37:51,770
I swear to God.

5386
03:37:57,510 --> 03:37:59,110
I swear.

5387
03:37:59,370 --> 03:38:02,750
Okay, how fucked up were we?

5388
03:38:04,030 --> 03:38:07,070
Look at this adventure we had.

5389
03:38:09,490 --> 03:38:11,070
Oh my God.

5390
03:38:11,310 --> 03:38:12,870
Where were we?

5391
03:38:12,970 --> 03:38:15,710
We explored the entire world.

5392
03:38:16,570 --> 03:38:20,490
This is when she fucking tricked me into doing her fucking mission.

5393
03:38:23,610 --> 03:38:25,410
Oh my God.

5394
03:38:25,870 --> 03:38:27,570
Holy shit.

5395
03:38:32,470 --> 03:38:35,310
I went everywhere.

5396
03:38:35,690 --> 03:38:37,810
I actually went everywhere.

5397
03:38:37,930 --> 03:38:40,270
I fucking went everywhere.

5398
03:38:40,650 --> 03:38:43,450
No wonder, for real.

5399
03:38:44,090 --> 03:38:46,230
This is my whole journey.

5400
03:38:46,550 --> 03:38:48,190
My actual journey.

5401
03:38:49,510 --> 03:38:50,470
Okay.

5402
03:38:51,770 --> 03:38:52,830
Alright, what did I get?

5403
03:38:54,690 --> 03:38:56,030
I'm gonna buy better legs.

5404
03:38:56,150 --> 03:38:56,850
I can't.

5405
03:38:56,850 --> 03:38:58,270
I need to buy better legs.

5406
03:38:58,550 --> 03:39:00,710
I was not fucking...

5407
03:39:00,710 --> 03:39:01,970
Oh, I completed a request.

5408
03:39:02,610 --> 03:39:03,170
Nice.

5409
03:39:05,730 --> 03:39:07,450
I went everywhere.

5410
03:39:10,550 --> 03:39:11,890
Oh my God.

5411
03:39:11,970 --> 03:39:13,090
We're so close.

5412
03:39:13,350 --> 03:39:14,830
It's literally...

5413
03:39:15,890 --> 03:39:16,870
Oh my God.

5414
03:39:16,870 --> 03:39:17,890
It's literally right there.

5415
03:39:18,770 --> 03:39:19,330
It's...

5416
03:39:19,330 --> 03:39:19,830
No!

5417
03:39:22,990 --> 03:39:23,810
It's okay.

5418
03:39:24,090 --> 03:39:26,150
We're so close to the end.

5419
03:39:27,030 --> 03:39:28,410
Okay, repair everything.

5420
03:39:28,830 --> 03:39:30,830
Okay, we gotta put stuff away though.

5421
03:39:30,890 --> 03:39:33,010
We have too much useless junk here.

5422
03:39:33,370 --> 03:39:34,870
Okay, we're gonna...

5423
03:39:34,870 --> 03:39:36,090
Which one's best?

5424
03:39:36,810 --> 03:39:37,450
68%.

5425
03:39:38,590 --> 03:39:39,230
64%.

5426
03:39:39,230 --> 03:39:40,890
Oh wait, this is better.

5427
03:39:41,270 --> 03:39:41,830
Wait, what?

5428
03:39:41,930 --> 03:39:43,010
No, 7000.

5429
03:39:43,330 --> 03:39:44,630
Wait, which is better?

5430
03:39:45,210 --> 03:39:45,850
Whoops.

5431
03:39:47,810 --> 03:39:48,690
Firing speed.

5432
03:39:48,830 --> 03:39:49,870
Oh no, this is better.

5433
03:39:49,950 --> 03:39:52,070
The one I fucking stole is so much better.

5434
03:39:52,170 --> 03:39:52,790
What the fuck?

5435
03:39:53,290 --> 03:39:53,730
Okay.

5436
03:39:54,590 --> 03:39:56,450
Okay, and then which one is this?

5437
03:39:56,570 --> 03:39:57,610
Okay, firing speed.

5438
03:39:59,890 --> 03:40:01,770
I guess we'll go with this.

5439
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:02,190
Alright.

5440
03:40:02,530 --> 03:40:03,190
Wait, no.

5441
03:40:03,370 --> 03:40:04,230
Wait, this is...

5442
03:40:04,230 --> 03:40:05,010
This is green.

5443
03:40:05,430 --> 03:40:06,410
Alright, we're gonna put...

5444
03:40:06,410 --> 03:40:07,750
Wait, what the fuck is this?

5445
03:40:08,290 --> 03:40:08,630
You know what?

5446
03:40:08,850 --> 03:40:10,290
Fuck it, we're sniping.

5447
03:40:10,390 --> 03:40:11,150
Might as well.

5448
03:40:12,070 --> 03:40:13,230
Might as well.

5449
03:40:13,550 --> 03:40:14,890
Might as well.

5450
03:40:14,890 --> 03:40:15,210
Might as well.

5451
03:40:16,370 --> 03:40:18,550
Okay, get all this in here.

5452
03:40:18,850 --> 03:40:20,170
Get all this in here.

5453
03:40:20,230 --> 03:40:21,930
We're never gonna have no ammo.

5454
03:40:24,210 --> 03:40:25,790
Alright guys, we have to...

5455
03:40:26,310 --> 03:40:27,690
We have to make legs.

5456
03:40:27,930 --> 03:40:29,010
I can't anymore.

5457
03:40:29,350 --> 03:40:30,850
Like, I have to have legs.

5458
03:40:31,570 --> 03:40:32,090
I...

5459
03:40:32,090 --> 03:40:33,810
I need feet.

5460
03:40:34,170 --> 03:40:34,990
Better feet.

5461
03:40:35,170 --> 03:40:36,290
Okay, purchase restrictions.

5462
03:40:36,430 --> 03:40:37,430
One out of one.

5463
03:40:39,170 --> 03:40:39,690
230...

5464
03:40:39,690 --> 03:40:40,450
200...

5465
03:40:40,450 --> 03:40:41,270
300 and...

5466
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:42,210
Alright.

5467
03:40:42,390 --> 03:40:43,090
Boost speeds.

5468
03:40:43,250 --> 03:40:44,410
Okay, this should be better.

5469
03:40:45,390 --> 03:40:45,690
Alright.

5470
03:40:46,270 --> 03:40:46,870
Nice.

5471
03:40:47,310 --> 03:40:47,750
Okay.

5472
03:40:47,910 --> 03:40:48,510
Birds.

5473
03:40:48,670 --> 03:40:49,130
We're...

5474
03:40:49,870 --> 03:40:51,530
We should be okay now.

5475
03:40:51,790 --> 03:40:52,090
Right?

5476
03:40:53,950 --> 03:40:54,550
We're...

5477
03:40:54,550 --> 03:40:54,830
We're...

5478
03:40:54,830 --> 03:40:55,090
We're...

5479
03:40:55,090 --> 03:40:56,570
We have weather resistance.

5480
03:40:57,050 --> 03:40:57,350
Alright.

5481
03:40:57,530 --> 03:40:59,190
Guys, we don't need heal.

5482
03:40:59,210 --> 03:41:00,010
Okay, we need heal.

5483
03:41:00,050 --> 03:41:00,330
Let's win.

5484
03:41:03,130 --> 03:41:03,430
Okay.

5485
03:41:05,250 --> 03:41:05,850
How...

5486
03:41:05,850 --> 03:41:06,830
What can go wrong?

5487
03:41:08,190 --> 03:41:09,830
What can go wrong now?

5488
03:41:10,270 --> 03:41:10,870
Alright.

5489
03:41:13,110 --> 03:41:14,310
How is there...

5490
03:41:14,890 --> 03:41:16,370
Oh my god, we're so close.

5491
03:41:16,470 --> 03:41:18,830
We just need two more degraded plaster piece.

5492
03:41:19,170 --> 03:41:21,190
Guys, where is the plaster piece again?

5493
03:41:21,590 --> 03:41:23,750
Guys, I need to know where...

5494
03:41:23,750 --> 03:41:24,150
Where...

5495
03:41:25,950 --> 03:41:28,050
Where is the plaster piece, guys?

5496
03:41:28,370 --> 03:41:28,570

5497
03:41:28,570 --> 03:41:29,210
I...

5498
03:41:29,210 --> 03:41:30,810
This is really...

5499
03:41:31,290 --> 03:41:33,470
I'm like at my wit's end here.

5500
03:41:33,710 --> 03:41:35,230
I need to know.

5501
03:41:36,970 --> 03:41:38,850
Okay, left side of the map.

5502
03:41:39,150 --> 03:41:40,450
Okay, we gotta ensure everything.

5503
03:41:41,630 --> 03:41:43,190
Okay, apply all...

5504
03:41:43,190 --> 03:41:44,710
Okay, a thousand dollars.

5505
03:41:44,970 --> 03:41:45,350
Okay.

5506
03:41:46,410 --> 03:41:47,450
This is it.

5507
03:41:47,770 --> 03:41:48,790
This has...

5508
03:41:48,790 --> 03:41:49,310
This is it.

5509
03:41:50,550 --> 03:41:52,030
God dammit, I'm in.

5510
03:41:52,750 --> 03:41:55,050
God dammit, I'm fucking in, guys.

5511
03:41:59,530 --> 03:42:00,510
Oh my god.

5512
03:42:01,990 --> 03:42:04,570
It's really the last job.

5513
03:42:08,710 --> 03:42:10,250
God fucking dammit.

5514
03:42:11,010 --> 03:42:12,610
The final last score.

5515
03:42:13,690 --> 03:42:14,890
The last ride.

5516
03:42:16,090 --> 03:42:16,970
Look at me.

5517
03:42:17,410 --> 03:42:19,310
Oh my god, look at my arms.

5518
03:42:19,910 --> 03:42:20,830
Where did I spawn?

5519
03:42:21,070 --> 03:42:23,070
Oh, thank fucking god I spawned there.

5520
03:42:23,570 --> 03:42:28,470
Okay, we're gonna run here and then maybe...

5521
03:42:32,270 --> 03:42:34,010
This has to be it.

5522
03:42:34,070 --> 03:42:35,510
There's no other way.

5523
03:42:37,370 --> 03:42:39,670
There's no other... oh my god, I'm so fast.

5524
03:42:42,890 --> 03:42:43,370
Okay.

5525
03:42:43,790 --> 03:42:46,050
Holy shit, why did I not upgrade sooner?

5526
03:42:48,170 --> 03:42:48,650
Okay.

5527
03:42:49,430 --> 03:42:50,550
Gotta go this way.

5528
03:42:50,950 --> 03:42:52,230
Yeah, we're zooming now.

5529
03:42:52,730 --> 03:42:53,850
We're so zooming.

5530
03:42:56,650 --> 03:42:58,650
Oh shit, what the fuck?

5531
03:42:59,750 --> 03:43:02,510
Oh my god, I fucking hit it.

5532
03:43:03,010 --> 03:43:04,390
Holy shit.

5533
03:43:05,310 --> 03:43:06,430
That was strong.

5534
03:43:08,530 --> 03:43:12,590
Wait, is this... okay, we're grabbing... I don't know if we need this, but like I don't...

5535
03:43:12,610 --> 03:43:12,890
I don't know.

5536
03:43:13,210 --> 03:43:14,550
I'm too scared.

5537
03:43:14,890 --> 03:43:17,050
I don't know anymore.

5538
03:43:18,470 --> 03:43:20,130
I don't know anymore.

5539
03:43:20,310 --> 03:43:21,810
I'm desperate.

5540
03:43:25,470 --> 03:43:26,010
Okay.

5541
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:26,850
This is it.

5542
03:43:27,970 --> 03:43:30,390
Oh my god, and I can go on forever.

5543
03:43:31,630 --> 03:43:33,290
Look at how fast I go.

5544
03:43:33,430 --> 03:43:33,670
Okay.

5545
03:43:34,410 --> 03:43:36,150
Into the roads we go!

5546
03:43:39,370 --> 03:43:41,490
Okay, plastic pipe.

5547
03:43:41,570 --> 03:43:43,030
I'm just gonna grab this for now.

5548
03:43:43,350 --> 03:43:44,070
Who knows?

5549
03:43:44,090 --> 03:43:44,450
Who knows?

5550
03:43:44,470 --> 03:43:45,150
We might need it.

5551
03:43:46,830 --> 03:43:47,790
Oops, sorry.

5552
03:43:49,310 --> 03:43:50,550
This has to be it.

5553
03:43:52,490 --> 03:43:53,790
This has to be it.

5554
03:43:54,010 --> 03:43:55,930
In the... in the... down here.

5555
03:43:56,350 --> 03:43:57,810
Hello, are you friendly?

5556
03:43:58,970 --> 03:43:59,850
Oh my god!

5557
03:44:00,210 --> 03:44:01,910
I know you do, Blaster!

5558
03:44:02,130 --> 03:44:04,170
Give me fucking Blaster right now!

5559
03:44:04,170 --> 03:44:04,170
No!

5560
03:44:04,470 --> 03:44:05,270
You're a jerk!

5561
03:44:05,370 --> 03:44:06,770
Yes, I recognize you!

5562
03:44:06,810 --> 03:44:07,750
Where's your Blaster?

5563
03:44:07,990 --> 03:44:08,910
What the fuck?

5564
03:44:08,950 --> 03:44:13,270
I swear to god, if you did... I swear to god, you did not bring Blaster, did you?

5565
03:44:13,550 --> 03:44:16,010
You didn't bring Blaster!

5566
03:44:16,730 --> 03:44:18,290
Oh, thank god, he got it.

5567
03:44:18,990 --> 03:44:20,050
Okay, I got it.

5568
03:44:20,110 --> 03:44:21,850
But this is not Blaster!

5569
03:44:22,730 --> 03:44:25,330
Oh, thank god, he has Blaster!

5570
03:44:28,010 --> 03:44:28,490
Okay.

5571
03:44:28,490 --> 03:44:30,210
Oh my god.

5572
03:44:30,210 --> 03:44:33,550
Oh my god, there's a guy!

5573
03:44:33,810 --> 03:44:35,330
We fucking did it!

5574
03:44:35,490 --> 03:44:38,570
Holy shit, we fucking did it!

5575
03:44:38,730 --> 03:44:40,370
Oh my god!

5576
03:44:41,190 --> 03:44:44,550
Holy shit, how much was it?

5577
03:44:44,810 --> 03:44:46,970
What does it even look like?

5578
03:44:47,070 --> 03:44:49,050
Oh my god, he got me five things!

5579
03:44:49,710 --> 03:44:51,010
We fucking did it!

5580
03:44:51,070 --> 03:44:53,090
We fucking did it!

5581
03:44:53,490 --> 03:44:56,850
Oh, I don't choose the last job!

5582
03:44:57,690 --> 03:44:59,570
We fucking did it!

5583
03:45:00,210 --> 03:45:03,570
Oh my god, we can leave!

5584
03:45:05,330 --> 03:45:10,650
Oh my god, my dad still had to walk so far to get home.

5585
03:45:10,850 --> 03:45:13,610
And that's what I told you.

5586
03:45:13,770 --> 03:45:19,710
When he walked away, I almost thought he did not have it.

5587
03:45:19,810 --> 03:45:23,770
When he walked away, I thought he was just playing the game.

5588
03:45:26,850 --> 03:45:29,910
Oh my god, thank god he had it.

5589
03:45:30,210 --> 03:45:31,210
He actually had it.

5590
03:45:31,550 --> 03:45:34,050
I got so worried there.

5591
03:45:34,150 --> 03:45:35,610
I was like, there's no way.

5592
03:45:36,330 --> 03:45:39,410
There's no way you don't actually have it.

5593
03:45:42,510 --> 03:45:45,270
Oh my god, okay, we have to go this way.

5594
03:45:45,510 --> 03:45:47,110
The fakeout.

5595
03:45:47,210 --> 03:45:51,730
When he turned around, that actually fucked me up.

5596
03:45:53,170 --> 03:45:54,790
Alright, off we go.

5597
03:45:55,750 --> 03:45:56,770
You like my gun?

5598
03:45:56,890 --> 03:45:57,790
Thanks, I stole it.

5599
03:45:59,630 --> 03:46:01,770
No, I recognized the name.

5600
03:46:02,070 --> 03:46:04,610
I recognized Airborne Ninja.

5601
03:46:04,690 --> 03:46:06,390
I know he was a dragon.

5602
03:46:06,770 --> 03:46:09,630
But I legitimately thought he was fucking with me.

5603
03:46:09,650 --> 03:46:11,930
And was like, sorry, I don't have any.

5604
03:46:12,990 --> 03:46:14,670
Oh no, no, please.

5605
03:46:15,150 --> 03:46:18,630
Oh no, please, I overheated.

5606
03:46:18,930 --> 03:46:19,510
No!

5607
03:46:23,690 --> 03:46:25,310
Oh god, no!

5608
03:46:25,310 --> 03:46:25,430
Get out!

5609
03:46:27,050 --> 03:46:28,330
Analysis failed.

5610
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:29,530
Oh god, please.

5611
03:46:30,010 --> 03:46:30,770
Hit confirmed.

5612
03:46:31,050 --> 03:46:32,890
We have caused significant damage.

5613
03:46:32,890 --> 03:46:33,770
Oh god, please.

5614
03:46:35,650 --> 03:46:37,650
Enemy has repaired their durability.

5615
03:46:38,590 --> 03:46:40,010
Oh god, please.

5616
03:46:41,830 --> 03:46:42,470
Live!

5617
03:46:47,910 --> 03:46:48,930
Alright, okay.

5618
03:46:49,350 --> 03:46:50,330
Calm down.

5619
03:46:51,070 --> 03:46:53,110
Calm down, need to get out of here.

5620
03:46:53,690 --> 03:46:55,150
Calm, calm down.

5621
03:46:56,490 --> 03:46:57,570
Calm down.

5622
03:46:57,570 --> 03:46:59,090
I need to get out of here.

5623
03:46:59,410 --> 03:47:00,970
Oh my god, please.

5624
03:47:02,470 --> 03:47:04,070
Please, we're stuck.

5625
03:47:04,210 --> 03:47:04,710
I swear.

5626
03:47:06,390 --> 03:47:08,210
Oh my god, we're almost there.

5627
03:47:08,330 --> 03:47:11,770
I'm running as fast as my legs can take me.

5628
03:47:11,790 --> 03:47:12,710
My little legs.

5629
03:47:12,890 --> 03:47:14,470
My little fucking legs.

5630
03:47:16,030 --> 03:47:17,490
Oh, we're here.

5631
03:47:19,790 --> 03:47:20,790
We're here.

5632
03:47:21,850 --> 03:47:22,970
Return request transmitted.

5633
03:47:23,370 --> 03:47:25,410
Oh my god, thank god.

5634
03:47:26,290 --> 03:47:28,190
Thank fucking god.

5635
03:47:28,770 --> 03:47:30,170
Don't you dare, kiddo.

5636
03:47:30,190 --> 03:47:30,830
Don't you dare.

5637
03:47:31,510 --> 03:47:35,110
Please, I worked so hard for this last job.

5638
03:47:35,550 --> 03:47:36,150
Please.

5639
03:47:37,350 --> 03:47:39,830
Oh my god, I can feel the finish line.

5640
03:47:41,410 --> 03:47:42,370
Oh, there he is.

5641
03:47:42,570 --> 03:47:43,410
What if I shot him?

5642
03:47:45,970 --> 03:47:48,490
If I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that though.

5643
03:47:51,110 --> 03:47:53,070
We worked so hard.

5644
03:47:56,170 --> 03:47:57,910
Don't do it.

5645
03:47:58,050 --> 03:47:59,310
He worked so hard.

5646
03:47:59,470 --> 03:48:00,010
Wee!

5647
03:48:00,350 --> 03:48:03,310
This is a group effort chat.

5648
03:48:04,650 --> 03:48:05,370
Wee!

5649
03:48:05,770 --> 03:48:06,590
Worked hard.

5650
03:48:07,350 --> 03:48:08,770
Oh god, okay.

5651
03:48:08,890 --> 03:48:11,070
This was a group effort.

5652
03:48:12,970 --> 03:48:14,830
Oh my god, please.

5653
03:48:14,930 --> 03:48:15,790
I swear to...

5654
03:48:16,610 --> 03:48:18,050
We did it, guys.

5655
03:48:19,350 --> 03:48:21,150
We did it.

5656
03:48:21,290 --> 03:48:22,710
Oh my god.

5657
03:48:23,590 --> 03:48:24,470
Oh my god.

5658
03:48:24,470 --> 03:48:25,550
I'm so happy.

5659
03:48:30,630 --> 03:48:32,690
Oh my god, this is it?

5660
03:48:33,470 --> 03:48:34,990
Did we make it?

5661
03:48:35,110 --> 03:48:36,910
Guys, this was supposed to be a one hour stream.

5662
03:48:37,210 --> 03:48:38,370
But like...

5663
03:48:42,430 --> 03:48:44,070
We don't need to watch this.

5664
03:48:44,350 --> 03:48:45,710
We know what happened.

5665
03:48:48,090 --> 03:48:49,450
Oh my god.

5666
03:48:50,110 --> 03:48:51,050
This is it.

5667
03:48:51,050 --> 03:48:51,770
This is it.

5668
03:48:51,870 --> 03:48:52,530
I believe.

5669
03:48:52,750 --> 03:48:53,710
This is it.

5670
03:48:54,110 --> 03:48:55,570
This has to be it.

5671
03:48:55,650 --> 03:48:56,830
What else do I need?

5672
03:48:57,130 --> 03:48:57,610
This...

5673
03:48:57,610 --> 03:49:00,530
You can't make the bathroom gonna cry.

5674
03:49:01,690 --> 03:49:03,050
You're gonna cry?

5675
03:49:06,670 --> 03:49:08,090
Oh my god.

5676
03:49:13,070 --> 03:49:14,150
Alright, here we go.

5677
03:49:16,570 --> 03:49:17,110
Complete.

5678
03:49:17,170 --> 03:49:20,170
Today's the perfect day to get started on the living area.

5679
03:49:20,470 --> 03:49:21,310
This is it.

5680
03:49:21,310 --> 03:49:23,830
You never even begin to tell you how long I've waited for this.

5681
03:49:23,910 --> 03:49:26,190
How long you've waited?!

5682
03:49:27,370 --> 03:49:30,430
How long you've waited?!

5683
03:49:30,430 --> 03:49:30,450
...

5684
03:49:31,310 --> 03:49:38,510
I want a bath and a huge sofa and I am getting rid of that grimy mattress as well as that, and that, and those.

5685
03:49:39,250 --> 03:49:40,850
I have lots of work ahead.

5686
03:49:40,930 --> 03:49:43,430
But feels good to have someone like anyways.

5687
03:49:52,440 --> 03:49:54,580
It feels good to have someone like.

5688
03:49:56,080 --> 03:49:57,240
What did she do?

5689
03:49:59,820 --> 03:50:00,540
That's it?

5690
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:04,120
What did she do?

5691
03:50:04,500 --> 03:50:06,220
The mattress is still there!

5692
03:50:06,800 --> 03:50:08,580
The mattress is...

5693
03:50:09,160 --> 03:50:10,300
At least we recycled.

5694
03:50:12,360 --> 03:50:14,220
I like how she was like...

5695
03:50:14,220 --> 03:50:18,360
Thank god we can finally replace the mattress and it's still there.

5696
03:50:18,580 --> 03:50:20,340
It's literally still there.

5697
03:50:21,960 --> 03:50:22,600
I...

5698
03:50:30,900 --> 03:50:33,360
There's no fucking way.

5699
03:50:36,320 --> 03:50:38,580
There's no fucking way.

5700
03:50:40,300 --> 03:50:42,600
There's no fucking way.

5701
03:50:52,520 --> 03:50:58,380
Guys, be truthful to me.

5702
03:50:58,580 --> 03:50:59,980
How much do I need?

5703
03:51:00,500 --> 03:51:01,820
How much?

5704
03:51:02,220 --> 03:51:03,660
Oh, I can craft it.

5705
03:51:03,680 --> 03:51:04,820
Wait, I can craft it.

5706
03:51:04,920 --> 03:51:05,660
Wait, really?

5707
03:51:06,320 --> 03:51:08,620
Can I actually craft it?

5708
03:51:09,560 --> 03:51:11,240
Don't fuck with me.

5709
03:51:11,340 --> 03:51:14,360
No, I cannot, you fucker.

5710
03:51:14,960 --> 03:51:15,640
You...

5711
03:51:15,640 --> 03:51:18,160
Why did you give me hope?

5712
03:51:18,640 --> 03:51:21,740
Why the fuck did you give me hope?

5713
03:51:22,200 --> 03:51:24,280
That's so fucked up.

5714
03:51:30,900 --> 03:51:32,460
Oh my god.

5715
03:51:34,220 --> 03:51:35,420
Oh my god.

5716
03:51:38,600 --> 03:51:40,660
Guys, give it to me straight.

5717
03:51:41,140 --> 03:51:44,220
How much more do we need?

5718
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:47,180
Jenner says thank you for the super chat.

5719
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:48,140
Thank you, thank you.

5720
03:51:48,240 --> 03:51:50,680
The Last Sight saga continues.

5721
03:51:51,260 --> 03:51:52,660
Thank you for the super...

5722
03:51:52,660 --> 03:51:54,040
You're so close.

5723
03:51:54,360 --> 03:51:55,320
How much?

5724
03:51:55,460 --> 03:51:58,560
Guys, just give me the number and I'll find it all on the list.

5725
03:51:58,560 --> 03:51:59,140
The next one.

5726
03:51:59,440 --> 03:52:01,400
Just give me a number.

5727
03:52:01,660 --> 03:52:04,280
I need to know how much I need to find.

5728
03:52:04,820 --> 03:52:06,540
I need to know.

5729
03:52:07,040 --> 03:52:08,860
Thank you for the super chat.

5730
03:52:08,960 --> 03:52:09,260
Thank you.

5731
03:52:09,460 --> 03:52:09,860
Thank you.

5732
03:52:09,880 --> 03:52:10,340
Thank you.

5733
03:52:10,460 --> 03:52:12,540
We need some bathroom anyway.

5734
03:52:13,180 --> 03:52:15,840
I invested four hours.

5735
03:52:16,580 --> 03:52:20,200
I invested four fucking hours.

5736
03:52:20,980 --> 03:52:22,220
I'm almost...

5737
03:52:22,220 --> 03:52:22,780
Oh my god.

5738
03:52:25,380 --> 03:52:26,000
What?

5739
03:52:26,120 --> 03:52:28,340
Who told me about the bathroom?

5740
03:52:28,560 --> 03:52:32,280
Who the fuck told me about the goddamn bathroom?

5741
03:52:34,260 --> 03:52:39,420
What the fuck?

5742
03:52:39,520 --> 03:52:43,660
I blame the person that told me about the fucking bathroom.

5743
03:52:44,140 --> 03:52:46,840
I wouldn't be here if I didn't know.

5744
03:52:54,310 --> 03:52:55,040
Oh my...

5745
03:52:55,040 --> 03:52:57,000
Guys, please give it to me straight.

5746
03:52:57,000 --> 03:53:00,440
How many materials do we need?

5747
03:53:00,780 --> 03:53:02,840
How many materials?

5748
03:53:04,900 --> 03:53:06,140
Oh my god.

5749
03:53:06,500 --> 03:53:09,620
We'll just watch our wife fucking clean, I guess.

5750
03:53:10,720 --> 03:53:12,400
Lunar, thank you for the super chat.

5751
03:53:12,480 --> 03:53:12,760
Thank you.

5752
03:53:12,940 --> 03:53:13,200
Thank you.

5753
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:16,960
When the one hour bathroom turns into a four hour bathroom.

5754
03:53:17,340 --> 03:53:18,960
Thank you for the super chat.

5755
03:53:19,020 --> 03:53:19,460
Thank you.

5756
03:53:19,500 --> 03:53:20,140
Thank you.

5757
03:53:20,560 --> 03:53:22,000
I need a number.

5758
03:53:22,680 --> 03:53:24,700
I need a number.

5759
03:53:24,700 --> 03:53:26,620
Guys, I can't.

5760
03:53:26,620 --> 03:53:27,580
I can't.

5761
03:53:27,580 --> 03:53:30,320
Like, you just grab the necessary...

5762
03:53:30,320 --> 03:53:31,720
Give me a number.

5763
03:53:31,800 --> 03:53:34,620
I need the number of materials.

5764
03:53:34,900 --> 03:53:38,040
I don't think the next one is the bathroom.

5765
03:53:38,100 --> 03:53:39,720
That's what's so fucked.

5766
03:53:39,840 --> 03:53:42,820
I don't think this is the bathroom.

5767
03:53:43,920 --> 03:53:44,640
Five.

5768
03:53:44,680 --> 03:53:45,380
Five what?

5769
03:53:45,660 --> 03:53:47,020
You can't just...

5770
03:53:47,020 --> 03:53:48,400
You can't give random...

5771
03:53:48,400 --> 03:53:49,200
Five what?

5772
03:53:49,300 --> 03:53:50,460
What do I need?

5773
03:53:51,280 --> 03:53:53,380
What the fuck do I need?

5774
03:53:53,380 --> 03:53:55,180
I'm doing everything for her.

5775
03:53:55,320 --> 03:53:57,940
I'm doing everything for this girl.

5776
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:02,800
Okay.

5777
03:54:05,080 --> 03:54:06,700
Okay, this is the last run.

5778
03:54:06,980 --> 03:54:10,500
This will be the last run.

5779
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:14,040
This will be the last fucking run.

5780
03:54:18,620 --> 03:54:19,720
Oh my god.

5781
03:54:19,900 --> 03:54:21,100
How many upgrades?

5782
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:24,060
Guys, how many fucking upgrades?

5783
03:54:24,060 --> 03:54:24,840
How many upgrades left?

5784
03:54:25,600 --> 03:54:26,800
Oh my god.

5785
03:54:28,280 --> 03:54:29,880
The last job.

5786
03:54:30,160 --> 03:54:30,960
God damn it.

5787
03:54:30,980 --> 03:54:31,660
I'm fucking in.

5788
03:54:32,820 --> 03:54:35,200
I'm fucking in on this last job.

5789
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:44,420
Guys, I don't think it's raining.

5790
03:54:44,620 --> 03:54:46,060
I don't think it's the last...

5791
03:54:46,960 --> 03:54:47,820
Oh my...

5792
03:54:47,820 --> 03:54:48,780
Where am I?

5793
03:54:50,100 --> 03:54:51,260
Oh, thank god.

5794
03:54:51,320 --> 03:54:52,320
I'm next to the city.

5795
03:54:52,380 --> 03:54:53,160
The game knows.

5796
03:54:53,160 --> 03:54:56,140
The game knows.

5797
03:54:57,320 --> 03:54:59,200
The game fucking...

5798
03:54:59,200 --> 03:55:00,260
I didn't even enshrine.

5799
03:55:00,640 --> 03:55:01,920
I didn't enshrine.

5800
03:55:01,920 --> 03:55:02,920
I went straight in.

5801
03:55:02,960 --> 03:55:04,120
I'm so fucking...

5802
03:55:04,120 --> 03:55:05,140
Oh my, I'm going crazy.

5803
03:55:05,440 --> 03:55:08,300
I didn't even enshrine.

5804
03:55:11,060 --> 03:55:11,660
Alright.

5805
03:55:15,200 --> 03:55:17,500
Okay, I just wanted to get rid of this guy.

5806
03:55:18,900 --> 03:55:19,840
Oh my god.

5807
03:55:19,880 --> 03:55:22,520
There has to be the fusion core here.

5808
03:55:23,140 --> 03:55:24,600
This is the city.

5809
03:55:24,880 --> 03:55:26,260
I'm in the ruins.

5810
03:55:31,220 --> 03:55:31,760
Okay.

5811
03:55:32,640 --> 03:55:33,180
Alright.

5812
03:55:33,700 --> 03:55:35,480
I can see the materials?

5813
03:55:35,500 --> 03:55:35,980
Where?

5814
03:55:37,460 --> 03:55:39,800
Wait, how do you guys see the materials?

5815
03:55:41,760 --> 03:55:43,240
How do you do it?

5816
03:55:45,120 --> 03:55:45,660
Okay.

5817
03:55:49,260 --> 03:55:50,580
Fusion core is here.

5818
03:55:50,640 --> 03:55:51,940
I know because I was here.

5819
03:55:51,940 --> 03:55:54,500
I did so much to be here.

5820
03:55:55,320 --> 03:55:59,440
Alright, I don't need the crystals.

5821
03:55:59,600 --> 03:56:00,520
I literally...

5822
03:56:02,260 --> 03:56:02,900
Caution?

5823
03:56:04,800 --> 03:56:07,060
Wait, the drifters die here?

5824
03:56:07,500 --> 03:56:09,060
Why did I get caution?

5825
03:56:10,400 --> 03:56:11,040
Oh!

5826
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:11,920
Up down?

5827
03:56:12,240 --> 03:56:13,640
Oh my god, this is it.

5828
03:56:17,200 --> 03:56:18,520
Oh my god.

5829
03:56:19,100 --> 03:56:20,580
Oh my god.

5830
03:56:21,940 --> 03:56:24,260
Oh my fucking god.

5831
03:56:24,420 --> 03:56:24,860
Okay.

5832
03:56:28,380 --> 03:56:29,280
Okay.

5833
03:56:31,180 --> 03:56:32,080
Okay.

5834
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:41,360
We're gonna find our fusion core.

5835
03:56:43,180 --> 03:56:44,960
We have copper scrap.

5836
03:56:46,280 --> 03:56:49,480
Where the fuck is the fusion core?

5837
03:56:50,390 --> 03:56:52,060
I'm in the area.

5838
03:56:56,010 --> 03:56:58,030
What do you mean it's over there?

5839
03:57:00,990 --> 03:57:02,510
Did they take it?

5840
03:57:05,810 --> 03:57:06,970
Oh my god.

5841
03:57:07,010 --> 03:57:08,590
It's just... It's just this.

5842
03:57:12,730 --> 03:57:13,270
Please.

5843
03:57:13,510 --> 03:57:14,510
Please don't.

5844
03:57:14,510 --> 03:57:14,870
Please.

5845
03:57:14,990 --> 03:57:15,810
Please don't.

5846
03:57:15,810 --> 03:57:16,070
Please.

5847
03:57:16,130 --> 03:57:16,850
I don't have insurance.

5848
03:57:17,030 --> 03:57:17,870
Please leave me alone.

5849
03:57:18,050 --> 03:57:18,290
Please.

5850
03:57:18,350 --> 03:57:19,390
I don't have insurance.

5851
03:57:19,670 --> 03:57:20,950
I... Please.

5852
03:57:21,270 --> 03:57:22,450
Oh my god.

5853
03:57:22,470 --> 03:57:23,090
He's friendly.

5854
03:57:23,090 --> 03:57:23,950
He's jumping.

5855
03:57:23,950 --> 03:57:26,050
But I don't know if he's baiting me.

5856
03:57:26,130 --> 03:57:27,030
I don't know.

5857
03:57:29,570 --> 03:57:32,470
I found the material we're after.

5858
03:57:32,470 --> 03:57:33,190
Oh my god.

5859
03:57:33,190 --> 03:57:33,610
Oh.

5860
03:57:33,610 --> 03:57:34,390
Oh my god.

5861
03:57:34,430 --> 03:57:35,430
It's a dragon.

5862
03:57:36,110 --> 03:57:37,730
Oh my god.

5863
03:57:37,730 --> 03:57:38,490
It's a dragon.

5864
03:57:38,850 --> 03:57:41,070
Who are you?

5865
03:57:41,970 --> 03:57:43,450
Who are... Oh fuck.

5866
03:57:43,890 --> 03:57:46,510
Give me... Give me... Give me... You have... Give me everything.

5867
03:57:46,610 --> 03:57:48,310
You know how many materials there are.

5868
03:57:48,470 --> 03:57:50,910
Give me... You must have more.

5869
03:57:51,630 --> 03:57:53,050
You must have more.

5870
03:57:53,050 --> 03:57:55,470
There has to be more in your fucking inventory.

5871
03:57:55,710 --> 03:57:58,130
There has to be more, Alan.

5872
03:57:58,330 --> 03:57:59,490
You don't understand.

5873
03:57:59,750 --> 03:58:00,350
I'm desperate.

5874
03:58:00,810 --> 03:58:02,530
You don't understand.

5875
03:58:02,590 --> 03:58:03,770
I'm so desperate.

5876
03:58:03,770 --> 03:58:06,110
I need the bathroom for my wife.

5877
03:58:06,530 --> 03:58:09,690
I need... I need the bathroom.

5878
03:58:09,750 --> 03:58:10,910
I'm so desperate.

5879
03:58:11,250 --> 03:58:12,410
Oh, please.

5880
03:58:12,830 --> 03:58:14,870
Will you...

5881
03:58:14,870 --> 03:58:16,830
Oh, do you... Oh, you had something.

5882
03:58:16,830 --> 03:58:17,270
Okay.

5883
03:58:17,570 --> 03:58:18,270
Okay.

5884
03:58:18,730 --> 03:58:18,990
Okay.

5885
03:58:21,650 --> 03:58:22,170
Okay.

5886
03:58:22,170 --> 03:58:22,810
Oh, my god.

5887
03:58:23,010 --> 03:58:24,930
Oh, my god.

5888
03:58:24,950 --> 03:58:25,210
Okay.

5889
03:58:25,470 --> 03:58:25,910
Okay.

5890
03:58:25,910 --> 03:58:26,150
All right.

5891
03:58:26,150 --> 03:58:26,730
That's fine.

5892
03:58:27,230 --> 03:58:27,750
Okay.

5893
03:58:27,850 --> 03:58:28,590
I'm happy.

5894
03:58:28,890 --> 03:58:29,810
I'm going to leave.

5895
03:58:30,790 --> 03:58:31,310
Okay.

5896
03:58:33,670 --> 03:58:35,230
Where's the closest...

5897
03:58:35,230 --> 03:58:35,650
Okay.

5898
03:58:36,870 --> 03:58:37,910
All right.

5899
03:58:37,990 --> 03:58:38,790
Now fight each other.

5900
03:58:38,930 --> 03:58:39,730
Fight each other.

5901
03:58:40,090 --> 03:58:41,150
Oh, my god.

5902
03:58:41,290 --> 03:58:41,690
Nice.

5903
03:58:41,830 --> 03:58:42,290
Okay.

5904
03:58:43,010 --> 03:58:43,530
Nice.

5905
03:58:43,590 --> 03:58:43,930
All right.

5906
03:58:43,950 --> 03:58:44,610
What does he have?

5907
03:58:45,470 --> 03:58:45,990
Okay.

5908
03:58:46,030 --> 03:58:47,010
He has...

5909
03:58:47,010 --> 03:58:47,830
Oh, look at that!

5910
03:58:47,830 --> 03:58:48,870
Yeah, that's a cool head.

5911
03:58:49,130 --> 03:58:50,810
Okay, I'll get this.

5912
03:58:51,670 --> 03:58:54,510
And then... oh my god, look at this arm.

5913
03:58:54,710 --> 03:58:56,530
And then I'll grab these too.

5914
03:58:56,710 --> 03:58:57,470
Alright, nice.

5915
03:58:57,830 --> 03:59:01,450
Wait, did it drop more?

5916
03:59:01,810 --> 03:59:02,610
Do you have more?

5917
03:59:02,630 --> 03:59:03,630
Please, I'm so desperate.

5918
03:59:03,750 --> 03:59:04,710
Do you have more, please?

5919
03:59:05,230 --> 03:59:06,930
Please, she wants so much.

5920
03:59:11,950 --> 03:59:14,370
This is fine, I have more than enough.

5921
03:59:14,910 --> 03:59:17,570
Where we can... okay, we gotta go this way.

5922
03:59:17,830 --> 03:59:28,130
This is where... this is... this is... this is where... where... oh my god, is that the way I have to go?

5923
03:59:29,430 --> 03:59:30,730
This is where...

5924
03:59:32,470 --> 03:59:34,750
Alright, this is where we have to go.

5925
03:59:36,310 --> 03:59:38,710
Oh my god, I went through so much.

5926
03:59:39,270 --> 03:59:42,570
I... I... I went through so much.

5927
03:59:43,710 --> 03:59:47,030
Oh my god, it might piss you off.

5928
03:59:48,490 --> 03:59:51,150
I... oh my god, I don't care anymore.

5929
03:59:53,970 --> 03:59:55,370
Anything for her.

5930
03:59:56,530 --> 03:59:57,910
Anything for her.

5931
03:59:59,050 --> 04:00:01,010
The things I do for her.

5932
04:00:02,170 --> 04:00:03,650
Okay, is this better?

5933
04:00:04,790 --> 04:00:06,850
360... oh wait, no, mine's better.

5934
04:00:06,970 --> 04:00:10,110
The guy that fucking jumped to his death.

5935
04:00:11,930 --> 04:00:14,230
Oh my god, we're so close.

5936
04:00:14,290 --> 04:00:15,690
This has to be it.

5937
04:00:15,830 --> 04:00:17,110
This has to be it.

5938
04:00:17,110 --> 04:00:20,490
There's no way... I'll do it for her.

5939
04:00:21,210 --> 04:00:22,570
Do it for her.

5940
04:00:26,850 --> 04:00:28,030
Oh my god.

5941
04:00:28,930 --> 04:00:31,130
We're so close to the finish line.

5942
04:00:32,210 --> 04:00:33,850
Okay I have to go this way.

5943
04:00:35,170 --> 04:00:36,730
Try to figure out where to go.

5944
04:00:37,390 --> 04:00:39,430
Okay, I go this way and then I turn around.

5945
04:00:41,850 --> 04:00:42,370
Alright.

5946
04:00:44,070 --> 04:00:44,930
This is it.

5947
04:00:46,370 --> 04:00:47,010
It's alright.

5948
04:00:47,530 --> 04:00:49,030
We should have enough now.

5949
04:00:49,670 --> 04:00:52,190
We literally have... there's no way!

5950
04:00:52,330 --> 04:00:53,650
Look at this!

5951
04:00:53,970 --> 04:00:56,070
There's no way she wants more.

5952
04:00:56,530 --> 04:00:58,310
I gave you everything.

5953
04:00:59,470 --> 04:01:01,530
I don't have a life anymore.

5954
04:01:04,310 --> 04:01:06,490
I gave you all I have.

5955
04:01:06,710 --> 04:01:07,890
What more do you want?

5956
04:01:08,010 --> 04:01:10,110
I don't even have friends anymore.

5957
04:01:10,470 --> 04:01:12,230
I don't have friends.

5958
04:01:12,250 --> 04:01:13,670
I do all of this for you.

5959
04:01:13,670 --> 04:01:14,370
I...

5960
04:01:17,510 --> 04:01:19,490
But I just have a broken man.

5961
04:01:24,030 --> 04:01:25,150
Oh my god.

5962
04:01:26,770 --> 04:01:27,290
Okay.

5963
04:01:27,290 --> 04:01:28,030
There we go.

5964
04:01:32,750 --> 04:01:35,130
Oh my god, please don't do this.

5965
04:01:37,190 --> 04:01:39,230
How the fuck are you not dead?

5966
04:01:41,910 --> 04:01:42,430
Alright.

5967
04:01:45,710 --> 04:01:47,130
Alright, here we go.

5968
04:01:48,190 --> 04:01:48,910
Who's this?

5969
04:01:50,310 --> 04:01:52,370
Extortion Blackmail Priory.

5970
04:01:52,490 --> 04:01:53,490
All for her.

5971
04:01:53,990 --> 04:01:55,530
All for her.

5972
04:01:55,730 --> 04:01:56,990
It's all for you.

5973
04:01:57,590 --> 04:01:59,070
It's all for you.

5974
04:01:59,170 --> 04:02:00,530
Number three.

5975
04:02:04,250 --> 04:02:05,710
Oh my god, here it is.

5976
04:02:06,190 --> 04:02:07,310
This is it.

5977
04:02:07,430 --> 04:02:08,430
This is it.

5978
04:02:09,250 --> 04:02:11,010
Oh my god, this is it.

5979
04:02:12,030 --> 04:02:12,650
What?

5980
04:02:12,770 --> 04:02:14,190
What more do you want from me?

5981
04:02:17,610 --> 04:02:18,850
A chaser?

5982
04:02:19,530 --> 04:02:21,750
How the fuck is he so far away?

5983
04:02:23,010 --> 04:02:24,970
How did that detect me?

5984
04:02:27,290 --> 04:02:28,470
Alright, we're fine.

5985
04:02:29,710 --> 04:02:31,390
Oh my god.

5986
04:02:32,290 --> 04:02:33,790
This has to be it.

5987
04:02:33,910 --> 04:02:34,850
There's no other...

5988
04:02:34,850 --> 04:02:35,890
This has to be it.

5989
04:02:36,650 --> 04:02:38,470
There's no way.

5990
04:02:38,470 --> 04:02:39,970
This has to be it.

5991
04:02:39,970 --> 04:02:40,890
This has to be it.

5992
04:02:44,310 --> 04:02:44,910
Okay.

5993
04:02:45,270 --> 04:02:47,410
Alright, we don't need to see this.

5994
04:02:48,430 --> 04:02:51,290
We don't need to see this.

5995
04:02:51,690 --> 04:02:52,350
We don't need to see this.

5996
04:02:53,550 --> 04:02:54,150
Okay.

5997
04:02:57,490 --> 04:02:58,470
Let's go.

5998
04:02:58,690 --> 04:02:59,890
There's no way.

5999
04:03:00,570 --> 04:03:03,210
What more does she want from me?

6000
04:03:03,250 --> 04:03:04,170
There's no way.

6001
04:03:05,430 --> 04:03:06,990
Okay, walls and ceiling.

6002
04:03:08,170 --> 04:03:11,850
I'm so tempted to quick fill ten seconds.

6003
04:03:12,090 --> 04:03:15,130
I'm so tempted to quick fill ten seconds.

6004
04:03:15,130 --> 04:03:15,490
I'm so tempted to quick fill ten seconds.

6005
04:03:15,490 --> 04:03:15,610
Okay.

6006
04:03:17,070 --> 04:03:19,110
We got the walls and ceiling.

6007
04:03:19,250 --> 04:03:21,310
The next one has to be the bathroom, right?

6008
04:03:21,950 --> 04:03:23,130
The next one has to be the bathroom, right?

6009
04:03:26,190 --> 04:03:28,610
Nothing like a little weeding to start the day.

6010
04:03:28,750 --> 04:03:28,930
Nothing like a little weeding to start the day.

6011
04:03:28,930 --> 04:03:31,550
Starting to feel less like amagus and more like a...

6012
04:03:31,550 --> 04:03:32,430
Oh my god.

6013
04:03:34,190 --> 04:03:35,670
Oh yeah, even...

6014
04:03:37,050 --> 04:03:37,610
Oh...

6015
04:03:37,610 --> 04:03:37,930
Oh!

6016
04:03:38,490 --> 04:03:39,390
Weed soup!

6017
04:03:39,570 --> 04:03:40,350
Let's go!

6018
04:03:41,170 --> 04:03:42,050
Let's go!

6019
04:03:42,410 --> 04:03:44,490
I work... I work...

6020
04:03:45,790 --> 04:03:48,670
7 to 9 with overtime.

6021
04:03:48,950 --> 04:03:53,190
And then my wife, RobiAnimeGirl, makes me weed soup.

6022
04:03:55,770 --> 04:03:56,750
What a life.

6023
04:03:58,170 --> 04:04:00,450
What... What a life.

6024
04:04:02,390 --> 04:04:04,950
You can actually see the ceiling display at long last.

6025
04:04:07,610 --> 04:04:10,250
Next up on our list is the one we've all been waiting for.

6026
04:04:11,350 --> 04:04:12,450
Oh my god!

6027
04:04:12,630 --> 04:04:13,050
Yes!

6028
04:04:14,030 --> 04:04:14,910
Oh my...

6029
04:04:15,610 --> 04:04:16,010
Yes!

6030
04:04:16,210 --> 04:04:17,470
This has to be it!

6031
04:04:17,670 --> 04:04:20,830
The next one on the list we've all been waiting for!

6032
04:04:24,010 --> 04:04:25,130
Oh shit!

6033
04:04:25,230 --> 04:04:26,110
I can craft that!

6034
04:04:26,190 --> 04:04:26,990
Oh thank god!

6035
04:04:27,170 --> 04:04:29,470
I was gonna fucking freak out.

6036
04:04:29,670 --> 04:04:33,110
I was gonna fucking freak out if I have to.

6037
04:04:33,190 --> 04:04:36,590
Oh thank fucking god I can craft this.

6038
04:04:36,710 --> 04:04:37,730
This is it!

6039
04:04:38,350 --> 04:04:39,590
This is it!

6040
04:04:40,350 --> 04:04:41,030
This is it!

6041
04:04:41,030 --> 04:04:42,010
Oh my god!

6042
04:04:42,050 --> 04:04:43,010
This is it!

6043
04:04:43,150 --> 04:04:44,710
This is actually it!

6044
04:04:45,850 --> 04:04:47,090
Oh my god!

6045
04:04:47,090 --> 04:04:47,890
We were here!

6046
04:04:48,070 --> 04:04:48,710
We were here!

6047
04:04:49,630 --> 04:04:52,210
We were fucking... You know, fucking...

6048
04:04:53,710 --> 04:04:55,730
I can't wait 8 seconds.

6049
04:04:55,810 --> 04:04:56,890
I literally cannot.

6050
04:04:57,230 --> 04:05:00,030
I cannot wait 8 more seconds.

6051
04:05:02,670 --> 04:05:04,310
Oh my god!

6052
04:05:06,850 --> 04:05:08,150
We were here!

6053
04:05:10,030 --> 04:05:12,950
Now, let's get started on that dream bathroom.

6054
04:05:13,230 --> 04:05:13,890
What do you say?

6055
04:05:14,090 --> 04:05:14,870
Oh my god!

6056
04:05:14,950 --> 04:05:15,230
Yes!

6057
04:05:19,030 --> 04:05:20,970
That goes there.

6058
04:05:21,410 --> 04:05:23,070
Four hours and...

6059
04:05:23,070 --> 04:05:26,290
The one... I told you the last job!

6060
04:05:29,190 --> 04:05:29,990
Fuck!

6061
04:05:29,990 --> 04:05:30,510
Fuck!

6062
04:05:30,510 --> 04:05:30,910
Okay.

6063
04:05:32,170 --> 04:05:32,970
Okay.

6064
04:05:34,810 --> 04:05:35,750
It's finished.

6065
04:05:36,710 --> 04:05:37,510
Bathroom.

6066
04:05:38,110 --> 04:05:39,150
It's beautiful.

6067
04:05:40,270 --> 04:05:41,550
It is.

6068
04:05:41,550 --> 04:05:42,070
It is.

6069
04:05:42,330 --> 04:05:42,970
It's beautiful.

6070
04:05:43,390 --> 04:05:46,010
Look, this is a lot better than nothing, alright?

6071
04:05:46,770 --> 04:05:48,590
This is four hours of work.

6072
04:05:48,610 --> 04:05:49,610
This was...

6073
04:05:49,610 --> 04:05:52,550
This is four hours.

6074
04:05:52,890 --> 04:05:53,550
It's so round to work.

6075
04:05:53,550 --> 04:05:56,530
You look like a magus you wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen with?

6076
04:05:57,210 --> 04:05:58,150
I feel...

6077
04:05:58,930 --> 04:06:01,390
No, there's no way!

6078
04:06:01,930 --> 04:06:03,650
There's no way that's it!

6079
04:06:03,830 --> 04:06:04,170
Please!

6080
04:06:04,370 --> 04:06:05,430
Oh my god!

6081
04:06:05,470 --> 04:06:05,930
Please!

6082
04:06:06,170 --> 04:06:07,530
What is this?

6083
04:06:07,670 --> 04:06:08,670
Perform cleaning?

6084
04:06:08,670 --> 04:06:08,890
Cleaning?

6085
04:06:10,010 --> 04:06:11,190
Wait, what?

6086
04:06:12,710 --> 04:06:14,290
You got it wrong!

6087
04:06:20,790 --> 04:06:21,530
This is it!

6088
04:06:21,910 --> 04:06:22,970
This is it!

6089
04:06:23,750 --> 04:06:24,910
This is it!

6090
04:06:25,590 --> 04:06:26,910
Pay the ones!

6091
04:06:26,910 --> 04:06:28,210
I can't believe it!

6092
04:06:35,000 --> 04:06:36,160
Oh my god!

6093
04:06:38,120 --> 04:06:40,620
I paid a thousand dollars!

6094
04:06:40,760 --> 04:06:42,380
She's my wife!

6095
04:06:42,380 --> 04:06:43,700
I was just not...

6096
04:06:43,700 --> 04:06:44,420
That's it!

6097
04:06:50,280 --> 04:06:53,020
I have to pay my wife a thousand dollars.

6098
04:06:59,050 --> 04:07:00,650
There's no way!

6099
04:07:01,150 --> 04:07:03,030
There's no way that's all!

6100
04:07:03,390 --> 04:07:05,330
There's no way that's all!

6101
04:07:05,350 --> 04:07:06,730
I got out of it...

6102
04:07:07,130 --> 04:07:07,870
What are you...

6103
04:07:07,870 --> 04:07:08,090
That's...

6104
04:07:08,090 --> 04:07:10,130
It's a new cutscene!

6105
04:07:13,990 --> 04:07:19,890
I need a thousand dollars to watch it!

6106
04:07:20,210 --> 04:07:22,230
A thousand...

6107
04:07:24,810 --> 04:07:25,770
Oh my god!

6108
04:07:28,090 --> 04:07:29,270
There's no way.

6109
04:07:29,410 --> 04:07:35,090
I need like another... I need her to do it again to make this worth it.

6110
04:07:35,150 --> 04:07:35,890
I can't.

6111
04:07:37,090 --> 04:07:40,790
I need her to clean herself for every hour.

6112
04:07:41,670 --> 04:07:43,430
For every hour.

6113
04:07:49,790 --> 04:07:53,250
JL, thank you for the super chat.

6114
04:07:53,370 --> 04:07:54,990
Thank you, thank you.

6115
04:07:55,770 --> 04:07:58,270
Oh my god.

6116
04:07:58,730 --> 04:08:06,050
I can't believe I paid her $4,000 just to clean herself.

6117
04:08:06,450 --> 04:08:08,490
How many times?

6118
04:08:12,770 --> 04:08:15,390
Four hours per minute.

6119
04:08:16,530 --> 04:08:18,130
Oh my god.

6120
04:08:18,550 --> 04:08:21,750
Oh my god, I need one more.

6121
04:08:22,390 --> 04:08:25,110
The fourth hour just to commemorate.

6122
04:08:25,410 --> 04:08:25,750
The fourth hour just to commemorate.

6123
04:08:25,770 --> 04:08:26,650
The fourth hour.

6124
04:08:29,190 --> 04:08:37,730
Guys, if you want a bathroom, make sure to check us in UALITY when it comes out.

6125
04:08:40,830 --> 04:08:42,910
I did it.

6126
04:08:43,550 --> 04:08:46,390
You're so... you're beautiful.

6127
04:08:48,730 --> 04:08:50,790
You're so beautiful.

6128
04:08:51,270 --> 04:08:52,990
I better as well get the lounge.

6129
04:08:53,350 --> 04:08:54,550
Go for it.

6130
04:08:54,550 --> 04:08:54,970
Go.

6131
04:08:55,010 --> 04:08:56,870
I can't believe I even quick-filled it too.

6132
04:08:57,190 --> 04:08:58,890
I hate it.

6133
04:09:01,290 --> 04:09:03,250
Oh my god, Popro, thank you for the...

6134
04:09:03,250 --> 04:09:05,090
You want to give the chips?

6135
04:09:05,170 --> 04:09:06,250
Thank you, thank you.

6136
04:09:10,270 --> 04:09:12,850
You're so beautiful and clean.

6137
04:09:13,770 --> 04:09:17,750
Anything for my robot anime girl wife.

6138
04:09:17,770 --> 04:09:19,510
Goodbye to this old piece of plastic.

6139
04:09:21,530 --> 04:09:23,710
And we'll put the sofa here.

6140
04:09:26,570 --> 04:09:33,390
Thing is, people nobody, if they knew...

6141
04:09:33,390 --> 04:09:35,310
That's the hard part.

6142
04:09:35,350 --> 04:09:36,630
You kind of knew.

6143
04:09:37,090 --> 04:09:43,690
You told me, they were four hours.

6144
04:09:44,230 --> 04:09:48,270
The garage really has come a long way.

6145
04:09:48,330 --> 04:09:50,110
This calls for a celebration.

6146
04:09:50,750 --> 04:09:51,650
Nice.

6147
04:09:52,670 --> 04:09:57,410
Bye-bye, guys.

6148
04:09:57,410 --> 04:10:04,490
At this point, this garage has the bare minimum of everything a drifter needs.

6149
04:10:04,730 --> 04:10:05,150
Yay!

6150
04:10:05,350 --> 04:10:07,090
The bare minimum!

6151
04:10:08,110 --> 04:10:11,210
All future renovations to your discretion, my igniter.

6152
04:10:12,010 --> 04:10:14,690
Let's build a base of operations worthy of...

6153
04:10:14,690 --> 04:10:18,530
Wait, if I upgrade the bathroom more, does the cutscene last at least longer?

6154
04:10:18,530 --> 04:10:21,610
Like... like that's... I need...

6155
04:10:21,610 --> 04:10:22,910
What the fuck?

6156
04:10:23,610 --> 04:10:27,910
Not to fucking give you a kitchen and a piggy...

6157
04:10:27,910 --> 04:10:31,090
You don't need a fucking piggy bank!

6158
04:10:31,530 --> 04:10:32,670
You wanna...

6159
04:10:33,170 --> 04:10:35,910
What the... where did all of this come from?

6160
04:10:36,430 --> 04:10:41,490
Where did all of this...

6161
04:10:41,490 --> 04:10:44,330
What the fuck, where did all of this come from?

6162
04:10:44,570 --> 04:10:45,770
Oh my god!

6163
04:10:48,530 --> 04:10:50,770
Why do you need a piggy bank?

6164
04:10:50,870 --> 04:10:51,790
I don't understand!

6165
04:10:52,550 --> 04:10:54,990
What the fuck, we need an elevator?

6166
04:10:56,030 --> 04:10:58,030
We need a fucking elevator!

6167
04:11:01,450 --> 04:11:02,650
Oh my god.

6168
04:11:03,110 --> 04:11:04,830
Alright guys, we're gonna call it here.

6169
04:11:05,030 --> 04:11:06,970
We... we did a lot today.

6170
04:11:07,250 --> 04:11:09,270
We really did a lot.

6171
04:11:09,650 --> 04:11:11,630
That was... that was fun.

6172
04:11:11,910 --> 04:11:13,230
That was... that was fun.

6173
04:11:13,410 --> 04:11:14,690
Thank you again for...

6174
04:11:15,350 --> 04:11:17,650
Bandai for sponsoring me today.

6175
04:11:17,650 --> 04:11:18,150

6176
04:11:18,550 --> 04:11:21,090
Thank you to Bandai for the sponsor.

6177
04:11:21,610 --> 04:11:22,270
We...

6178
04:11:22,270 --> 04:11:24,250
We got so far.

6179
04:11:25,430 --> 04:11:29,290
We even paid for insurance too.

6180
04:11:29,390 --> 04:11:30,610
Thank you for the super chat.

6181
04:11:30,730 --> 04:11:31,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6182
04:11:33,430 --> 04:11:34,610
We did it.

6183
04:11:35,440 --> 04:11:36,970
Our anime wife...

6184
04:11:36,970 --> 04:11:38,530
Robot wife is happy.

6185
04:11:38,770 --> 04:11:40,090
We... we did it.

6186
04:11:40,270 --> 04:11:43,150
We did it for her.

6187
04:11:43,610 --> 04:11:45,790
We did our one last job.

6188
04:11:49,650 --> 04:11:50,850
Thank you everybody.

6189
04:11:50,910 --> 04:11:54,250
I hope you guys check out Sinuality when it comes out.

6191
04:11:54,890 --> 04:11:55,770
It was great.

6192
04:11:55,870 --> 04:11:56,250
I had...

6193
04:11:56,250 --> 04:11:57,310
It was fun though.

6194
04:11:57,330 --> 04:11:57,710
It was fun.

6195
04:11:57,830 --> 04:11:59,610
I hope you guys enjoyed the ride.

6196
04:12:00,090 --> 04:12:00,870
I'm gonna...

6197
04:12:00,870 --> 04:12:01,690
I'm gonna...

6198
04:12:01,690 --> 04:12:03,270
I'm fucking...

Happy wife.

6205
04:12:11,750 --> 04:12:12,410
Happy life.

6206
04:12:12,510 --> 04:12:13,130
I'm so happy.

6207
04:12:13,550 --> 04:12:14,210
Next scene.

Thank you as always everybody.

6213
04:12:16,890 --> 04:12:17,530
Stay hydrated.

6214
04:12:17,710 --> 04:12:18,290
Pause the chat.

6215
04:12:18,290 --> 04:12:19,910
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6216
04:12:20,170 --> 04:12:22,430
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

6217
04:12:22,610 --> 04:12:24,150
Cause you deserve it.

6218
04:12:24,190 --> 04:12:25,790
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6219
04:12:26,550 --> 04:12:27,250
Bye guys.

6220
04:12:27,950 --> 04:12:28,390
Bye.
