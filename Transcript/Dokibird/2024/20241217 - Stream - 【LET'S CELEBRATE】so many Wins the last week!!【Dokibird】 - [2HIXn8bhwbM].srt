94
00:08:47,900 --> 00:09:34,010
Yeah, he's just like no please Don't take me away It reminded me It reminded me of this tweet I saw today um or yesterday um, where it was like, um, this guy's cat disappeared because like this guy was allergic to cats But he still really wanted a cat but he was also like poor And then so like the cat ran away And found a rich owner And then the guy found his cat on like he saw his cat at a window and then the guy's driving like parking Like the garage had like a porsche and then he was like,

95
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,870
oh, I understand

96
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,480
The cat's a gold digger there's a fucking gold digger

97
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,080
The fact that the the cat ran away to a rich guy's house that's so fucked up

98
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,660
So like it's like I when I pick him up he's gonna be like no

99
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,780
No, no mommy don't let her take me away

100
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,300
All right, let me put away my food real quick We didn't have a natural way to eat.

101
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,880
We didn't have a natural way to eat We didn't have a natural conversation

102
00:10:31,120 --> 00:11:01,440
All right Putting the food away anyway today we're just gonna hang out because um Well today was gonna be like the stream where I do the stream and then we're gonna be on a little break but then I forgot my manager was like Yeah, I was sponsored stream like like they didn't know I was gonna stream today Because they thought I was taking I was taking my break today Starting today because I didn't put my waiting room out So they didn't know I was gonna stream today And they're like,

103
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,240
what do you mean?

104
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,840
What do you mean?

105
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,460
You're streaming today?

106
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,520
You have a stream tomorrow I was like, what do you mean?

107
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:16,920
I have a stream tomorrow I was just like um, no I'm streaming today because I want to take my break right after that and they're like you have a bandai sponsored

108
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,640
I was like

109
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:42,040
so so The thing is and then I remembered because like we were setting up the date because okay I had a choice of either streaming it before I left to atlanta Or like after I came home, so we're streaming sinuality again because there's a beta test open.

110
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,180
Um, the The beta test is like open again.

111
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,480
So we're streaming that tomorrow Uh to check out the new beta tests and the new updates and stuff like that.

112
00:11:52,560 --> 00:12:06,240
So that's at 5 p.m Pst tomorrow and then after that I would break until the apex tournament, which by the way I still don't have my full team yet because I fucked up because there's like, um the point system.

113
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:17,560
I didn't realize the point system um, because I okay, this is how um, I need to like find a replacement team member because apparently the points I The points weren't over.

114
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:46,040
So that's why I I need to figure that shit out by today because the tournament's on the 20th so the reason why is that um I always see how I see predator was like because I have two predator badges um in my head I see season one As a as an as a apex season so like it's apex one two and three So if I go by that order,

115
00:12:46,260 --> 00:13:29,940
I have apex two and three print badges, but regular people Regular people see it as season rank starts at season two and in two three four so like When so there was a requirement That was like oh you get lower points if you haven't touched pred in a long if you have only haven't touched pred in a long time But it's only two and three So I thought I was two and three season two and three But then I found out my print badges were actually season three and four Because like I miss I count differently compared to the regular people because like I see like this apex rank says System starts at one,

116
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:58,480
but then regular people would say apex rank season starts at two So my prep badges are three and four So like and then they're like you missed and then I got the message they're like, oh you submitted the wrong point system Because and then they and then they sent me the tweet of me being like ranked 20 Watson and My friend number break ring friend number 23 I was like,

117
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,840
yeah, that's four years ago.

118
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,800
But yeah, but it's season four

119
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,000
Fuck and at first I was gonna argue I was like, what do you mean?

120
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:17,780
Three and then reread this I was ready to argue and then like and I read it and then

121
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:34,000
Also like I just finished the concert so I was really tired so I was just like what a fuck you be Like that was four years ago.

122
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:50,540
You can't put me up to that standard and then I was like Three and that reread what they wrote and I deleted my messages Oh, no, I'm wrong never Never mind.

123
00:14:50,600 --> 00:15:08,660
I was like just woke up to like it was like a day after the concert I just woke up and then like and then I didn't I was like, oh wait my bad, I Hope they didn't see it Because it was like late at night for them.

124
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:21,060
Wait, let me I'll show you guys what they said Look, I won't show you the message sent me but what they said like the picture they sent me and I was like, oh, I'm wrong When I saw that I was like, oh, sorry

125
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:37,240
So like they sent me it they sent me this and They were like they were like cuz like oh my god, I need to lock this I don't know why this isn't

126
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,600
Know why which one was it?

127
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,180
Which is this?

128
00:15:44,260 --> 00:16:00,380
Okay, it's that so they sent me this so you see is like 28 But I was like, yeah, that's me it literally says jokey bird This is when I actually play the game, but then I was like, I was like, I was like what?

129
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:10,440
Yeah, but I thought that Cuz they were like they were like the point so like I'm my points are higher My points are high even though this was four years ago.

130
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
Cuz this is when I actually play the game now I just play Marvel Rivals.

131
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:41,620
So They said that to me and now I was ready to argue with them because I like that's four years ago It says I can do two and three and then cuz I thought that was season three, but that's season four Cuz like they don't count season one I count season one because season one to me is when rank started When rank didn't start I call it season zero because there was no rank,

132
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,160
but then I was wrong

133
00:16:48,260 --> 00:17:17,440
So I got a reef rethink the team I got like I got like reorganize the team and everything So that's the issue anyway, all right, so Congratulations dragons you guys won a best fan base of the year I am so proud of you guys That you guys got your your own.

134
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:17,780
Oh wait.

135
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,580
Yeah, they send me like my manage my other manager.

136
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,040
I have two managers so What's funny?

137
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,600
Is that?

138
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,180
Um During the okay.

139
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:46,460
It's so funny during the one of my managers Cuz they're like my they're mostly my events manager JK They're not just my manager manager the one of them is an events manager and the other ones the manager manager So the events manager actually went to the concert.

140
00:17:46,640 --> 00:18:05,680

230
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:52,370
I bought I bought so much at Awa, I think I spent a thousand plus dollars There because like I'm sorry There were so many artists Stuff there were so many things at the at the exhibitors slash artists What did I buy?

231
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,410
I bought clothes.

232
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,270
That's what was making us so expensive.

233
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:12,650
There's so many cute clothes Like I need a new wardrobe In general, I need a new wardrobe and everything because a lot of my clothes are like getting old and old old cuz I usually Don't shop for clothes that much anymore So I have like a lot of clothes that are like you like,

234
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:28,570
you know Three plus years old for like not even three like four to five plus years old So I was like, oh man, I'm Oh USC No it's one more than 1k USC cuz like I had to log into my bank account and like pay off my credit card like

235
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:46,970
Like at the almost the end of shopping I hit my credit card limit So then I had to like log in to my bank account on my phone to pay off the limit So like so I could

236
00:27:51,450 --> 00:28:10,330
Use up all the limit in the artist alley It was because like, um, I have it so that it pays off a set amount of money But a credit card every month so it doesn't pay it all the way So obviously it builds up a lot late over time because like, you know,

237
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:28,290
it just gives like a set amount It doesn't like it doesn't like it's just auto pays So like obviously it builds up closer Closer to the limit so I had to like so then like I didn't realize I already hit it like I was gonna hit it I could have paid it off before I went to Atlanta,

238
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,970
but like I you know, I'm fucking stupid

239
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,840
It doesn't matter as long as I Always pay it as long as it auto pays it off.

240
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:46,120
It's fine for me So like I don't always have to lock so I don't have to log in just to pay off my credit card limit Because I always pay it off.

241
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:53,940
It just does the auto thing and also like it doesn't really matter Anyway Kaz, thank you for the Akasupa.

So like you guys got free ramen on the side of the Acrylic stand so for this also like you guys didn't know there is a plastic plastic top on the acrylic stand So make sure to peel that off and you see there's scratches on your stand.

265
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,540
They're not scratches It's like it's just it's just a plastic covering all of it up.

266
00:30:46,840 --> 00:31:02,760
But yes GamerSup's is my new distributor And I thought it was just very convenient because like, you know, they already are They like they already well are well-versed with everything and as long as like I As this is like the test run.

267
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,920

323
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,540

324
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,260
Oh!

325
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,140

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,480

327
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,560
I need to show you guys this.

328
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,140
I don't remember the artist, so if anybody knows the artist...

329
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,160
I'll post pictures of all the stuff I bought another time.

330
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,340
Because, like I said, I didn't unpack yet, so maybe I'll do it tomorrow.

331
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,140
Today's a Marvel Rivals day.

332
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,080

333
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,420

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,980

335
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,740
Look, it's so cute!

336
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,560
Look!

337
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,480
Oh my god!

338
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,060
Oh my god, I bought a bunch of jackets and hoodies from this artist.

339
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:23,920
But I bought like... I bought the cat jacket, the space cat jacket, and the sheave hoodie.

340
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,700
And then I also got... There was like other stuff too, but I thought it was so pretty.

341
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,160
So I bought like a lot of...

342
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,900
I bought like a lot of clothes from AWA.

343
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,460
I think most of my merch was literally just clothes.

344
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,800
Because I love... I just love how creative artists are with like designs.

345
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Like the hoodies designs and then the jackets and shirts and everything.

346
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,460
And I needed a new wardrobe because...

347
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,820
Oh no, I bought an empty suitcase.

348
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,820
Well, not an empty suitcase.

349
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,220
My suitcase, my check-in bag just had like, you know, my laptop and stuff.

350
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,760
And then a pair of clothes for one day.

351
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,120
Like outfit... like clothes for... change of clothes for one day.

352
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,100
And then when I came back, basically my entire suitcase was stuffed with merch.

353
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:27,520
And like with merch, with like stuff I got from the concert, with like stuff I bought from AWA and everything.

354
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,280
It was just fucking stuffed to the brim at that point.

355
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,060
Like it was so fucking heavy after that.

356
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,800
So like I was ready.

357
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,960
I knew I was gonna shop a lot.

358
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,200
I knew I was gonna... I knew I was gonna fucking...

359
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,040
Yeah, one pair because I literally arrived on the 14th.

360
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,960
I... I took a late night flight.

361
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,760
So I arrived on the 14th and I was ready to go.

362
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,340
I was ready.

363
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,060
But yeah, yeah.

364
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah, like I said, Finn and I didn't go to AWA together.

365
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,420
Because like we were worried that like separately we'd be fine.

366
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,420
It won't be like recognizable.

367
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,880
But like together it might be bad.

368
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,940
Oh yeah, when I bought... so like I didn't buy most of the...

369
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,700
Okay, the thing is I only bought Doki merch once.

370
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,840
And then after that, I had my... not my event manager, not my manager.

371
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,100
But like I had a personal... like I said, I had a personal chauffeur.

372
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,420
From the organizer gave me a personal chauffeur to help me take me around.

373
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,240
And like take me to places.

374
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,740
So like the thing is like I got worried because I saw a lot of dragoons and wisps walking around.

375
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,460
I saw... I saw a lot of them.

376
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,800
And how do I know they were dragoons or wisps?

377
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,540
You'd know.

378
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,900
Because they were wearing the phantom thief or like Doki happies.

379
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,980
And also were carrying a lot of Doki bird stuff.

380
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,740
So then I got worried.

381
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,280
So then I was like... I like texted the chauffeur.

382
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,160
And I was like, can you come here to help me buy Doki merch?

383
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,700
Because I... because like the thing is...

384
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,460
Okay, the thing that worried me the most was that there were a lot of guys too.

385
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,820
So like... so like...

386
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,080
Which is understandable because I know my percentages of viewership of guys versus girls.

387
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,660
And like I think my... I think like I have 20% female.

388
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,960
I think it dropped down to 15%.

389
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,840
But like... it's like 15 to 20% female audience.

390
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,120
And then it was like... and the rest are like male.

391
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,080
So like... so there's a lot of guys.

392
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,180
And I felt like, oh no, I'm like the only girl trying to buy Doki bird merch on this table.

393
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,440
So I'll be like, will they know?

394
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,180
So I was just like... I was like, okay.

395
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,180
So I was like, I shouldn't.

396
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,320
So I called... I called my...

397
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,500
Like it was at that table.

398
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,940
There was a table that had like Doki bird stuff.

399
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,800
But then there was also a lot of guys there too.

400
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,120
And I'll be like the only girl walking up and be like, I'd like a Doki bird merch.

401
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,220
So then I was like, oh my god.

402
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,040
This is gonna be... I'm so paranoid.

403
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,080
I was so paranoid.

404
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,640
So I was like...

405
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,980
15% is a high amount for blending in.

406
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,340
They'll think you're the 15% Doki.

407
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,520
Yes, but I'm paranoid as fuck, guys.

408
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,520
So I called the staff to be like...

409
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,140
Hey, can you like, you know, come over and like buy my Doki stuff?

410
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,100
I did it for one table.

411
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,060
And then...

412
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,100
The...

413
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,520
They were asking me...

414
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,500
Because I bought like...

415
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,080
I bought like Doki and Mint stuff.

416
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,940
And like, I think like...

417
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,080
I bought like Doki and Mint and some other stuff.

418
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,500
So obviously it would seem like I'm going to the concert.

419
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,040
And then they were like...

420
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,820
Oh my...

421
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm not even gonna say who of course.

422
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,560
Because then it will narrow me down.

423
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,220
So they're like...

424
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,400
Are you going to the concert?

425
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,680
And I was like...

426
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,840
Yeah, I'm going to the concert.

427
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,840
Oh, you too?

428
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,880
I was like...

429
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,360
I'm so excited.

430
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm so excited.

431
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,800
I'm so excited.

432
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,440
And then...

433
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,240
After that, I called...

434
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,940
I texted the chauffeur.

435
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,020
And was like...

436
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,880
I need you to buy Doki Burn stuff.

437
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,940
I was like...

438
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,740
That's...

439
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,420
That's way too close to comfort.

440
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,740
That's way too close.

441
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,460
Not for comfort.

442
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,300
So...

443
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,320
So yeah.

444
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,540
After that, I was like...

445
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,160
Alright, I'm not buying my own merch anymore.

446
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,460
With all these dragoons and wisp roaming around.

447
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,800
That one dragoon.

448
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,780
Wait!

449
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,080
Wait!

450
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,290
Pretty sure...

451
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,910
There's a lot.

452
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,670
I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that was asked that.

453
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,090
I'm pretty sure.

454
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,630
But yeah, after that, I was just like...

455
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,470
Nope, not buying.

456
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,510
No, I didn't laugh at all.

457
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,290
I was by myself.

458
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,030
So there was no way for me to laugh when I'm by myself.

459
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,490
Just walking around shopping.

460
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,750
Also, I bought so much.

461
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,930
I don't know if I told you guys.

462
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,030
I bought so much stuff.

463
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,130
That...

464
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:06,290
Afterwards, I texted the chauffeur.

465
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,470
To come over.

466
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,990
So I could drop the stuff I have.

467
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,350
And then went back in shopping.

468
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,480
I thought I was holding on to.

469
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,940
I was like, oh man.

470
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,860
It's so heavy.

471
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,440
But I still need to shop.

472
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,140
He come over so I could drop my...

473
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,760
So I could drop all my things.

474
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,780
All the things I bought.

475
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,260
And then go back in.

476
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,120
He was like, yeah sure.

477
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,740
I was like waiting.

478
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,380
Here's the drop off.

479
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:32,960
Bye.

480
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,480
And I went back in shopping.

481
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,940
I went back in.

482
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,420
Okay.

483
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,700
And then I saw some of you guys.

484
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,920
Posting your merch haul.

485
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,860
From AWA.

486
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,240
And I was like, wait, I didn't see any of these.

487
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,240
And I walked around a lot.

488
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,980
I was so tired too.

489
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,960
No, that's a lie.

490
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,000
I didn't walk around a lot.

491
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,380
I walked around everything.

492
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,540
But I heard some stuff sold out.

493
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,660
On day one.

494
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,620
I was like, day one?

495
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,320
Because I saw people posting their merch haul.

496
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,000
And I was like, I didn't see 50% of this.

497
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,140
I was going to be really sad.

498
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,840
Because I was like, oh man.

499
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,520
There's not a lot of Doki stuff.

500
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,400
I was like, aww.

501
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,580
There's not a lot.

502
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,200
I thought there would be more.

503
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,740
And then later I found out.

504
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,680
Because everybody sold out on day one.

505
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,320
I didn't know.

506
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,260
I was like, aww.

507
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,740
Even IRL Doki is stuck.

508
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,000
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

509
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,420
Thank you, thank you.

510
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,680
I was like, aww.

511
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,100
And I'm like, wait a minute.

512
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,920
There's like wallets and stuff.

513
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:45,980
And everything.

514
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,520
And I was like, wait a minute.

515
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,660
I didn't see those.

516
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,920
I didn't see those prints.

517
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,520
I didn't see those keychains.

518
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,100
Where the fuck were they?

519
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,040
Brokenbon, thank you for the super chat.

520
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,820
Thank you, thank you.

521
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,940
Have you ever seen someone with handfuls of Doki merch?

522
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,360
You did not see anything.

523
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,500
Thank you for the super chat.

524
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,420
No, it's not true.

525
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,520
I couldn't even get...

526
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,600
I could barely...

527
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,520
I was only able to get like...

528
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,620
Six...

529
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,680
Five or six Doki things.

530
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,640
But there were so many.

531
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,940
I heard that even...

532
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,100
Yeah, the display stuff were gone too.

533
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,780
I was like...

534
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,240
I saw people's merch hauls.

535
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,000
And I was like...

536
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,180
I'm like one-eighth of that.

537
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,420
Like...

538
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,340
Like...

539
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,220
Most likely I've seen somebody walking around with Doki merch.

540
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,240
It's an actual dragon and it's not me.

541
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,760
I'd be the one person with zero Doki merch.

542
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,260
Because all of you guys gobbled it up.

543
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,000
Which I really appreciate.

544
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,920
I was like...

545
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,300
I really appreciate it, guys.

546
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,960
Like to see all the support.

547
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,160
That you guys gave the artists.

548
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,360
And like the love you gave the other artists, Ally.

549
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,040
And like...

550
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,780
Just like buying Doki stuff.

551
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,920
And supporting...

552
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,980
Supporting artists and stuff.

553
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,740
I just thought it was really funny.

554
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,220
I thought it was really funny.

555
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,900
That like...

556
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,180
I couldn't even get the merch.

557
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,960
I couldn't even get it.

558
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,540
Because they're all gone.

559
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,260
But yeah.

560
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,600
But it was fun.

561
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,200
I was only there for like a day and a half.

562
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,760
And...

563
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,000
And...

564
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,880
So like obviously I didn't get to do a lot.

565
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,680
At Atlanta, I didn't see a doctor.

566
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,280
Or anything because I literally...

567
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,700
I forgot about that.

568
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,680
Like after the 14th.

569
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,780
I literally just...

570
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,040
Passed out.

571
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,640
And then woke up.

572
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,880
And I was like it's time.

573
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,200
I almost missed my flight.

574
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,540
Because I was so fucking tired.

575
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,260
I was so sad.

576
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,330
Because the...

577
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,070
The Atlanta airport.

578
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,530
The Atlanta airport looked so cool.

579
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,250
There's so much...

580
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,830
It's such a big airport.

581
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,830
And there seemed to be so much food.

582
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,610
I had to go straight to take...

583
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,370
When I got there.

584
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,450
I obviously had to leave the Atlanta airport.

585
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,630
When I got to Atlanta.

586
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,930
I had to leave to catch my...

587
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,390
So that I could be driven.

588
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,990
To the convention and stuff.

589
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,370
And like to the hotel.

590
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,430
And things.

591
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,690
And then when I left.

592
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,150
Obviously I couldn't walk around.

593
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,330
And it's like...

594
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,410
I'm so sad.

595
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,250
It's a mega mall.

596
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,660
I caught the flight.

597
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,060
And went to my transfer.

598
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,120
And then went home.

599
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,160
I was so sad.

600
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,600
I really wanted to explore the mega mall.

601
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,800
Because it looked so cool.

602
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,320
Also what really sucked.

603
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,460
Is the fact that...

604
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,720
I had a child sitting behind me.

605
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,160
Oh my god.

606
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,260
Okay.

607
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,440
Also another thing is that...

608
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,780
Because I had to do a transfer too.

609
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,820
So I couldn't go...

610
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,720
There was no like direct flight.

611
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,660
So I had to do a transfer.

612
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,820
So the second flight.

613
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,900
I had a child sitting behind me.

614
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
And then...

615
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,060
And before I talk about the child.

616
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,060
I apparently got an exit seat.

617
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,120
And because like...

618
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,400
It looked a lot roomier.

619
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,240
Like the exit seats have more leg room.

620
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,680
So I got the exit seat.

621
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,020
But I didn't realize it's like a lot colder.

622
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,620
When you're next to the exit seat.

623
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,180
Because that's where the fucking door is.

624
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,280
Like...

625
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,440
That's where the fucking door is.

626
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,840
So like...

627
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,020
Obviously it's not...

628
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,460
It was very cold.

629
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,580
Anyway...

630
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,360
I learned.

631
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,560
It was like...

632
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,200
The cold is good.

633
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,600
I'm like one door away from fucking the sky.

634
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,340
Like...

635
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,760
Anyway...

636
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,200
So...

637
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,240
They're like...

638
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,120
When I checked my ticket in.

639
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,160
For...

640
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,060
For the flight.

641
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,780
The flight attendant.

642
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,380
That was checking me in.

643
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,560
Was like...

644
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,300
You apparently got an exit seat.

645
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,680
Would you be able to help out in an emergency?

646
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,260
And obviously.

647
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,860
I lied and said yes.

648
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,140
So...

649
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,520
Because like...

650
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:37,820
I don't know.

651
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,600
It's my first time sitting at an exit seat.

652
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,700
I don't fucking know what my job is.

653
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,840
I just thought like...

654
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,140
There's more room there.

655
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,440
No, if I say no.

656
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,540
They're gonna transfer my seat.

657
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,080
I was like...

658
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,960
Alright, well.

659
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,360
Obviously I have to say yes.

660
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,280
Because I want to sit there.

661
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,080
I want to sit at the exit seat.

662
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,460
Anyway.

663
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,500
So yeah, obviously.

664
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,460
I don't fucking know what my job was.

665
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,420
And then...

666
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,440
A flight attendant came over to me.

667
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,640
And was like...

668
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,080
In case of an emergency, just pull this lever.

669
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,540
And then I was like...

670
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,780
That's so much responsibility.

671
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,020
I could pull this like...

672
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,640
Intrusive thoughts.

673
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,440
Coming in and was like...

674
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,040
I could pull this lever right now.

675
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,520
Like...

676
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,920
That's all...

677
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,060
That's all I could think of.

678
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,940
I was like...

679
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,570
I could pull this lever right now.

680
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,980
I'm joking.

681
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:36,860
No.

682
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,320
So...

683
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,540
I don't think I should sit there.

684
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,380
Again.

685
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,060
I don't think I should sit at the exit seat again.

686
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,920
Also because it was really fucking cold too.

687
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,800
There's also that.

688
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,940
It was a really fucking cold...

689
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,420
Area to sit in.

690
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,920
And I was not happy.

691
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,440
About that.

692
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,400
And there was a child sitting behind me.

693
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,620
So the child sitting behind me was...

694
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,660
I think it was like...

695
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,140
I don't know if it's like...

696
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,040
Her first flight or whatever.

697
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,300
But this child was...

698
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,160
Oh my god, this child was so annoying.

699
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,680
She was like kicking my seat.

700
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,560
And then mom was like...

701
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,600
Honey, please don't kick the seat.

702
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,840
If you do that, karma's gonna come.

703
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,400
And I was like...

704
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,320
What the fuck?

705
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,840
Karma's gonna come?

706
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,760
I was like...

707
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,940
What kind of fucking warning is that?

708
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,580
You'll get karma...

709
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,640
If you keep doing it.

710
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,400
And then...

711
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,360
She was like...

712
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,400
She kept opening the tray and closing the tray.

713
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,760
And she had a fucking...

714
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,440
Hot wheel.

715
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,540
Cause she was like...

716
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,560
Yeah, I'm a hot wheel driver.

717
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,440
I'm like... Oh my god.

718
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,940
I'm just like...

719
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,060
Oh my god, please.

720
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,100
Oh my god.

721
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,900
I was surprised I was even able to sleep.

722
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,320
During that too.

723
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:06,900
But...

724
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,580
See this?

725
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,460
Karma's gonna come when I open this fucking door.

726
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,460
And they're like...

727
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,880
Yeah, hot wheels!

728
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,300
But...

729
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,540
It was not great.

730
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,640
It was not great having that child sit behind me.

731
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,660
Yeah, kids...

732
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,360
I think this is the first time I've ever had a child near me.

733
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,160
Like, on a plane.

734
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,240
It's not like I'm like...

735
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
If you're a child, please get the fuck away from me.

736
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,860
But like, a child sitting...

737
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,500
Close to me on a plane.

738
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,880
And now I realize...

739
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,020
Like I said, I rarely ever do economy.

740
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,500
But lately, I'm like...

741
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,320
It's such a short flight.

742
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:52,900
You know?

743
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,740
It's such a short flight.

744
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,000
It's not like I'm flying across the ocean.

745
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,380
So I was like...

746
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,860
Okay, I'm gonna do economy.

747
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,120
I'm gonna do economy.

748
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,220
It's not that bad.

749
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,120
And then of course, who the fuck is gonna give their kid business class seats?

750
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,900
Who's gonna give their child a business class seat?

751
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,460
Obviously.

752
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,860
So, like...

753
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,980
I was very fortunate...

754
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,080
To not experience...

755
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,960
Um...

756
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,680
Children until now.

757
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,400
And now I'm like, this is another reason why I don't want to do economy again.

758
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,460
This is...

759
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,640
I just...

760
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,420
I can't...

761
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,520
I don't think I can handle a child sitting behind me or close to me.

762
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,120
It was so bad.

763
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,140
She kept kicking my seat.

764
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,100
Opening and closing the tray.

765
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,280
And then her mom...

766
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,280
All her mom said was like, don't let karma get you.

767
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,480
And I'm like, control your child!

768
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,520
Don't fuck...

769
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,660
Do you think this child knows what the fuck karma is?

770
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,460
This child doesn't care!

771
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,320
Like...

772
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,240
Like...

773
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,300
You really think a child can process karma?

774
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,320
Like...

775
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,240
I'm like...

776
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,360
Just say it's wrong!

777
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,240
Just say it's wrong!

778
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,360
Don't fucking say you'll get karma!

779
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,620
Just say it's fucking wrong!

780
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,600
Karma is one lever away.

781
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,580
That's true.

782
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,460
That's true.

783
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,400
Karma is only one lever.

784
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,420
One lever away.

785
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,540
I could pull this lever right now.

786
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,080
Uh...

787
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,740
Libari, thank you for the super chat.

788
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,460
Thank you, thank you.

789
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,660
There was a really young child in business class on the way home today, but surprisingly well behaved.

790
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,780
Thank you for the super chat.

791
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,460
Thank you, thank you.

792
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,500
Because that child thinks he's better than you.

793
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,360
Cause you know that child's raised rich as fuck.

794
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,740
So he's like...

795
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,360
I don't...

796
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,600
I...

797
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,380
I don't need to degrade myself to...

798
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,120
That's the thing!

799
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,340
If there's a child in...

800
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,660
Um...

801
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,620
The child is better than me.

802
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,740
Because like...

803
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,460
If a child is in business class...

804
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,460
That child has to be the most fucking entitled shit ever.

805
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,440
Like...

806
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,400
That's all I can say.

807
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,320
Like...

808
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,140
Cause they're like...

809
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,860
Yeah, I'm better than all of you people.

810
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,500
Cause I get to sit here.

811
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:37,600
Um...

812
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,300
Anyway...

813
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,300
So that was my flight.

814
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,160
That was my flight home.

815
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,600
It was not the best of flights.

816
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,500
I mean, I slept most of it.

817
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:45,900
Um...

818
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,680
Actually, no.

819
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,160
The flights were okay.

820
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,480
Because this time I actually got the window seats.

821
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,860
This time for all my flights.

822
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,960
The only bad thing was the child.

823
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:54,740
That's really it.

824
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,000
All the other ones were okay.

825
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,320
I literally just slept the entire time.

826
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,800
I didn't do anything else.

827
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,580
I was just sleeping cause I was so fucking tired.

828
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,260
Anyway, I got home.

829
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,080
I played Marvel Rivals.

830
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,680
I slept and woke up.

831
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,040
We're gonna play Marvel Rivals in like 10 minutes.

832
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,780
LAUGHS LAUGHS LAUGHS Just so you guys know.

833
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,420
In 10 minutes we're playing Marvel Rivals.

834
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,200
In 10 minutes we're playing Marvel Rivals.

835
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,580
In 10 minutes we're playing Marvel Rivals.

836
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,340
I don't I don't have yes on stream.

837
00:58:30,420 --> 00:59:28,360
I don't have a problem I just need to win one game and when I win one game, we're we're fine I just win one game so I can be diamond one You gotta feed my addiction Um, but yeah, I'm trying to think if there's anything else I want to talk about Regarding the concert and like my trip Or like the VTuber Awards or everything but like I'm just really happy that you know Like I was actually asked if I could like film some stuff for the VTuber Awards I was so busy like if it wasn't like on the same day as the concert I would have but like other than the recordings I could all I could do was just do the recordings for the speech except like the Septon's Award recordings I could do that like that was really it but then like the rest of this stuff was just like I was just way too Busy that I couldn't like I was put like they wanted me to be part of some skits and stuff I was just like I can't I'm sorry for the and I fucking I'm booked as fuck

838
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,000

842
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,400
Thank you, thank you!

843
00:59:47,400 --> 01:00:02,920

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,840
We just need diamond one guys guys We just need diamond one And

847
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:37,070
Awesome Thank you, thank you, I know you're humble about it, but your dancing was really cool This concert was done in a short period of time so I can't imagine the possibilities you can do in the future I really hope there'll be more fan of thieve concert in 2025 and beyond!

848
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:38,590
Thank you for the Akasupa!

849
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:39,750
Thank you.

850
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,230
Thank you.

851
01:00:40,350 --> 01:01:14,030
Yeah, it was like, um, you guys didn't know this concert was Set up organized and everything we're in three months and then one month was just the organizers getting all the logistics done of Regarding like before we haven't even picked and we were picking songs still so like one month was spent just picking songs and deciding what we want to do and then second and third month was when we actually started like Figuring out the choreo and then in dancing and like lyrics and everything So,

852
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:23,110
the thing is, I already had 3D made... was in progress of being made before the concert.

853
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:29,650
So, you guys didn't know, my 3D model is made by a person that's worked on Hololive.

854
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,130
That is my official 3D model.

855
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,830
Like, it's not like I'm gonna get another one.

856
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,450
So, insane quality.

857
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,690
Apparently, there's a lot of polygons.

858
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:44,970
Because, you guys didn't know, also, the stage was originally gonna be a normal stage.

859
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:49,190
But Min and I requested to have a custom stage, but we had to find the people.

860
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:55,710
So, I found 3D artists to work on the whole custom stage and everything for it.

861
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:04,290
I scouted people out to work on it for us in the short amount of time that we had to make the concert stage for the concert.

862
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,510
And we wanted it to be super personalized and everything.

863
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:12,790
And obviously, we had to send the 3D models to them so that they could scale everything together.

864
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:16,850
And create props and stuff for it.

865
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:21,670
Create the props and the backgrounds and everything.

866
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:31,650
So, it was a lot of work for them and I really appreciate them for working so hard in the short amount of time they had.

867
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:36,170
That's why I got a lot of people in it, because I didn't want to make it so that one person has to do all of it.

868
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,750
So, there was a whole fucking team that worked on everything.

869
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:44,730
But yeah, my modeler was the one that's done Hololive models before for their 3D debuts.

870
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,150
It was very, very expensive.

871
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,750
It was very, very expensive.

872
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,170
Because it works for motion capture, animation, and everything.

873
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:59,330
What I did show you guys that was not in the concert was that I also have...

874
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:00,650
Oh, hello Phoebe!

875
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,150
Thank you for the raid!

876
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,350
Thank you, thank you!

877
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,630
What is this?

878
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:07,230
Phoebe from the openers?

879
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,090
Phoebe that did the opener for us?

880
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,470
Also, Skellum, thank you for the superchat!

881
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,430
Thank you, thank you!

882
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,030
We can have a playoff against the 2023 FPS...

883
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,390
I don't know.

884
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:21,350
The 2023 FPS Gamer of the Year.

885
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,070
Wait, no, that's me.

886
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:29,690
Well, past Doki was more of an Apex person.

887
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:32,790
Current Doki is like Marble Rivals brain rot right now.

888
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,890
And it's two different games.

889
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,170
It's two very different games.

890
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,690
Oh my god, yes!

891
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:40,990
Phoebe!

892
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,070
It's Phoebe the...

893
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,470
She did one of our openers.

894
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:44,570
She's one of our opener acts.

895
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,770
Amazing singing and everything.

896
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,310
Where was I?

897
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:48,670
Fuck.

898
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:49,030
Okay.

899
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,110
Oh yeah, I was gonna show you guys.

900
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,270
This technically my... Well, not technically, it is.

901
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,230
This is my official 3D.

902
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:03,850
Oh my god, the quality is insane though.

903
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,170
There's apparently a lot of polygons.

904
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:14,530
So I already had my 3D in the works before the concert.

905
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:16,890
So it was just like, obviously, it was like...

906
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:18,870
See, that's me.

907
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:20,550
Right here.

908
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:21,530
That's me.

909
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:22,670
It looks just like me.

910
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,330
Right here.

911
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,670
Right here.

912
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:24,710
Right here.

913
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,630
But obviously, I will have a more official debut with this.

914
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:33,610
With all the other stuff.

915
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:37,110
So the thing you guys didn't see, I'm not gonna show it because I don't wanna spoil it.

916
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,110
I wanna show it during my official 3D debut.

917
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,390
Is that we actually have a separate dad model.

918
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:44,410
Like, not the one that's on top of my head.

919
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,490
Like, one that's like a separate model in itself.

920
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,570
Where like, he can walk around and stuff.

921
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:50,950
So...

922
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,130
We weren't able to show that at the concert.

923
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:57,450
Because like, how the fuck are we gonna motion capture a fucking dog?

924
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:59,190
Like...

925
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:04,370
We're gonna put a motion capture suit on a fucking dog?

926
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,490
So, I do have it.

927
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,990
I just, we just have it.

928
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,910
We just didn't show it at the concert.

929
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,730
Will dad get motion captured too?

930
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,530
So yes, that is my official 3D model.

931
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:23,270
I'm not gonna, I will release it in the future.

932
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,870
So you guys can do like, MMDs and stuff.

933
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:26,770
Or like, animation stuff.

934
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:30,790
But it'll be after my official 3D debut.

935
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,490
Which I've not yet planned or anything.

936
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,670
I need to start planning that soon.

937
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:39,150
But I will release that after my 3D debut.

938
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,730
Not like, after this concert.

939
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:43,910
Because I do wanna use it for my actual 3D.

940
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,230
G, thank you for the super chat.

941
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:46,770
Thank you, thank you.

942
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:47,730
The 3D looks amazing.

943
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:48,430
Thank you.

944
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:53,830
Also, for those who are wondering when we'll upload the official recording of the concert videos.

945
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,850
It will not be right away.

946
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:04,650
Because we wanna like, we wanna see if there's like, anything we can do to improve upon the videos and stuff.

947
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,450
So, we're gonna look into that.

948
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:10,550
So, or like, improve like, the quality or like, the audio or anything.

949
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:14,870
So, we'll let you guys know when.

950
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:15,550
I don't know.

951
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,530
I'll let you guys know when it'll be released.

952
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:22,970
But I picked Last Cup of Coffee and the FNAF song as my official uploads.

953
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:30,370
And I think Mint's gonna upload Break Stuff and I Just Had Sex.

954
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:34,830
And then Doobie is obviously gonna upload her song with us.

955
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,670
Which I requested if Doobie could.

956
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:43,510
Because like, you know, I figured it would be a great gift for her fans and our fans to have an official upload of it.

957
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:47,150
And I was really thankful that we had the licensing for it too.

958
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:52,430
Because originally, we weren't, the song with Doobie wasn't gonna be uploaded.

959
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:55,930
But I requested for it to be uploaded.

960
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:58,970
Oh yeah, by the way, I did Club Penguin Dance in the concert.

961
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,470
It's up to you to figure out which song it was that I did it in.

962
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,190
Uh...

963
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:11,050
Yeah, it's up to you guys to find where I did the Club Penguin Dance.

964
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,810
You know, Mint was supposed to do it with me and then she forgot.

965
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,750
Oh, you guys found it?

966
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:16,950
You guys did?

967
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:21,630
You know, she was supposed to do it with me.

968
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,810
And I looked at the concert recording.

969
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,510
And I was like, we're

970
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,220
both gonna do it, right?

971
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,680
We're gonna do the Club Penguin Dance at that part, right?

972
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,780
And then she did it!

973
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,140
It was just me!

974
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,980
She forgot!

975
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,960
It's just me doing the...

976
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,560
I forgot or baited.

977
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,700
Honestly, I won't be surprised if she baited me.

978
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,640
I won't be surprised.

979
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,940
In my head, I'll be like, this is gonna look so funny.

980
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,760
When we both do the Club Penguin Dance together.

981
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,300
Oh my god, it'll be so fucking funny.

982
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,160
And it was just me.

983
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,300
And it was just me.

984
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,840
So funny.

985
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,420
Uh, Warren, thank you for the super chat.

986
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,240
Thank you, thank you.

987
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,800
I realized something while I was at the concert.

988
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,960
Something that's becoming increasingly obvious.

989
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,500
I can no longer deny.

990
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,780
I am small now!

991
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,720
Thank you for the super chat.

992
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,360
Thank you, thank you.

993
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,980
Oh no!

994
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,880
Also, make sure you're refilling your...

995
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,400
Refilling your Dokium right now.

996
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:51,060
Because, like, after tomorrow, it's gonna be sporadic when I'm streaming.

997
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,900
So, if I stream in the next couple...

998
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,440
Well, I have to stream tomorrow for the sponsor.

999
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,140
Anyway, guys, it's time.

1000
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,060
Guys, I don't know if there's anything else.

1001
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,100
Is there anything else you guys want to ask me about the concert?

1002
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,660
Or the VTuber Awards?

1003
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,100
Or, like, anything else that happened this last week?

1004
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,800
There were so many things that happened this last week.

1005
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,100
There's so many convention announcements I'm supposed to announce.

1006
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,400
I mean, I did it on Twitter, but obviously...

1007
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,100
Oh yeah, I received, like, all your letters.

1008
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,260
I haven't read them yet.

1009
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,140
Because, like, when I received them, I was, like, literally trying to check out.

1010
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,500
Like, I was like...

1011
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,960
I was like, I need to check out, I'm sorry.

1012
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,540
Like, I can't stay and chat.

1013
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,820
I'm gonna be late.

1014
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,740
So, I haven't read the letters yet.

1015
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,380
And, um, but I did receive a lot of, like, gifts and letters.

1016
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,540
From Dragoons and Wisps who came to the concert.

1017
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,100
And, um...

1018
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,400
I'm gonna start unpacking them.

1019
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,220
Either late at night or, like, tomorrow.

1020
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,040
Potapot, thank you for the super chat.

1021
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:43,940
Thank you, thank you.

1022
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,540
InflatedDragoon and Wisps at the stage were so cute.

1023
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:51,380
I hope we can see real, like, cutie roomie Dragoons one day.

1024
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1025
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,400
I was, like, talking, I don't know, did I talk about it on...

1026
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,120
Did I talk about it on the Off Collab?

1027
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,280
I'm wondering if I want to make, like, a beach ball version of it.

1028
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,860
Like, you know, like, and inflate up, like, you can blow it.

1029
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,900
And then it'll, like, uh, like, it'll inflate and stuff.

1030
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,580
So I thought it would be, like, really cute to have, like, a version.

1031
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:10,740
Like, a smaller version.

1032
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,140
Miniature version of that, too.

1033
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,200
You hear Marvel Rivals?

1034
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, I'm booting up the game.

1035
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,120
Oh, you guys know.

1036
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,500
Don't worry, don't worry, we're not gaming yet.

1037
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:28,940
No, we're not.

1038
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,100
Not time yet.

1039
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,780
It's not time.

1040
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:37,980
Oh,

1041
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,420
yeah, so, like, um...

1042
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:46,940
The...

1043
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:47,640
The...

1044
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,820
Okay, so you can tell in the concert which ones I had dance lessons for and which ones I just winged it.

1045
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,000
Like, I didn't even know, like, what I was gonna do.

1046
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,040
Like, I didn't really know what I was gonna do.

1047
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,460
I was just like, what happens, happens.

1048
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,580
So, like, obviously, it was, at best, like, two months.

1049
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,480
Two, like, one and a half months of dance lessons.

1050
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,380
And there was a lot of songs.

1051
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,120
There were...

1052
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,540
There were a lot of songs.

1053
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:23,120
So I was like, okay, I'm just gonna focus on these songs that I know I sound alright in.

1054
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,340
And then the encore one was so fucking hard.

1055
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:26,720
Like...

1056
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,480
The encore was really rough on me.

1057
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:36,400
Like, it was so... Singing and dancing-wise, it was so fucking rough on me.

1058
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:37,660
But...

1059
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,100
We don't mention about the singing part of the encore.

1060
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,100
But...

1061
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,560
But you can sort of tell which one...

1062
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,580
Like, I literally was like, I don't know what I'm doing.

1063
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,280
But, like, we'll see how it goes.

1064
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,380
And which one I actually had dance lessons for.

1065
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:02,000
Because, like I said, I had so many dance lessons that I couldn't keep up with having too many...

1066
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,740
I couldn't keep up with, like, a bunch of songs to know all the dance choreo for it.

1067
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,980
So, like, I tried to, like, just be like, alright, these songs are the ones I really want choreo with.

1068
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,280
And these other songs...

1069
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,720
I'll just fucking shake my ass.

1070
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,200
I'm gonna play a guitar and shake my ass.

1071
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,960
How bad can I be?

1072
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,900
Hunter, thank you for the superchat.

1073
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,240
Thank you, thank you.

1074
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,700
Your concert was my very first concert.

1075
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,720
It was so good!

1076
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,760
I don't think anything will top it.

1077
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,900
What if 2025?

1078
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:45,040
I don't know.

1079
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,860
I don't know if there's gonna be a 2025 concert.

1080
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:49,820
But, like, I hope I do get to do another concert in the future.

1081
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,380
Hunter, thank you for the superchat.

1082
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,380
Your very first superchat.

1083
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,020
Dude, thank you, thank you.

1084
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,120
Nexi, thank you for the superchat.

1085
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:56,720
Thank you, thank you.

1086
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,960
Your dancing really felt like you.

1087
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,820
It was so cool to see.

1088
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,380
Thank you, thank you for the superchat.

1089
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,220
Thank you, thank you.

1090
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,200
I'm really glad.

1091
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,860
I'm really glad you guys liked the dancing.

1092
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,020
I didn't get to do singing lessons, though.

1093
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:12,260
Unfortunately, because I was already, like, super, like, overloaded with dance lessons.

1094
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,080
Plus, also, like, all the other stuff I had behind the scenes.

1095
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,380
So, like, obviously, like, all this was going on.

1096
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,640
Plus my other responsibilities on top of it.

1097
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,780
So, like, I, like I said, I, oh, wait.

1098
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,880
Like, what the fuck is Grandmaster?

1099
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,820
So, like I said, there was, like, not a lot of time to, like, balance everything out.

1100
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,020
So, I was really worried about the singing, too.

1101
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,220
I was really, really worried about it.

1102
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:42,220
Um...

1103
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,260
So, I'm just happy it all turned out, like, good.

1104
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,780
I'm happy everybody enjoyed it.

1105
01:13:53,200 --> 01:14:01,100
I think, like I said, I, like, on stream, if we ever get another opportunity to do another concert...

1106
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:06,580
I won't accept it if we can have streaming tickets sold.

1107
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,540
Because, like, I won't, because, like, you know, I know, like, we had recording of...

1108
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:13,580
But, like, obviously you guys deserve, like, better quality recordings of it.

1109
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,380
So, like, I don't mind if, uh...

1110
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,780
But also, like, because...

1111
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:23,040
Because I know a lot, I saw people were, like, really amazed that we're allowed up recordings and stuff like that.

1112
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:27,700
Because, like, we thought that, like, you know, you guys didn't have, like, the only people who are there can watch it.

1113
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,360
So, we were fine with having recordings and stuff.

1114
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,260
Um, I mean, like, a lot of Western concerts allow recordings and things.

1115
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:38,020
Because you don't publish it out to, like, there's no, like, streaming tickets or anything.

1116
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,060
So, um, so we were fine with having recordings.

1117
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,920
Just because, like, you know, there's no other way to actually watch this.

1118
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,260
Um, but obviously if we have streaming tickets, um...

1119
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,260
We won't allow recordings in the future.

1120
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,480
Because they'll just, like, take the whole fucking...

1121
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,300
They'll just, they'll just take the streaming...

1122
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,400
The, the streaming...

1123
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,080
Oh my god, I'm a single diamond!

1124
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,440
Oh my god!

1125
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,680
What do, I'm the, the diamond in this game!

1126
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,040
What do I do?

1127
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,940
Also, where am I?

1128
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,920
Oh, I'm over here.

1129
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,920
Okay, there we go.

1130
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:16,980
What the fuck?

1131
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,420
I'm just a...

1132
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,600
Lonely diamond!

1133
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,780
What am I doing here?

1134
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,960
I'm diamond too!

1135
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,080
Like, what the fuck?

1136
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,300
There's no way this is balanced.

1137
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,520
There's no fucking way.

1138
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,320
Oh my god, and then I'm healing with surefire.

1139
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:37,900
I'm...

1140
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,500
We're back in the Marble Rivals funds.

1141
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,340
We're...

1142
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,060
We're...

1143
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,540
We're...

1144
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,540
We're back here in...

1145
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,880
We're back here in the mines.

1146
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,780
Oh my god, alright, back in it again.

1147
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,200
We're doing...

1148
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:10,580
They're like, you had one job!

1149
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,720
You're supposed to ban Hawkeye!

1150
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:13,840
You...

1151
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,540
We had one job, guys!

1152
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,320
Why did we not ban Hawkeye?

1153
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,480
We not...

1154
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,580
Okay, we're banning strange.

1155
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,020
Okay.

1156
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,240
Alright, it'll be fucking funny if we got...

1157
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,580
If it took Punisher from us.

1158
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,940
Okay, there we go.

1159
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,740
Alright, they got the Hawkeye in.

1160
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:33,240
There we...

1161
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,540
Alright, it's Luna time.

1162
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,880
Yes, we're back in it.

1163
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,500
Guys, we're...

1164
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,900
We're back in...

1165
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,580
Wait, I won more without my aimbot eye.

1166
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,520
Let's take that away.

1167
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,240
Let's actually take that away.

1168
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,060
Guys, I don't have a problem.

1169
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,760
I swear, it's just...

1170
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,040
It's a really good game!

1171
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:02,020
It's a really, really good game, guys.

1172
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,380
I don't have a problem.

1173
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,300
Okay.

1174
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,820
It's just...

1175
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,720
It's healthy.

1176
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,980
It's so healthy.

1177
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,960
I can't believe it.

1178
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,560
I'm in a GM game.

1179
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,660
Oh my god.

1180
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,420
Oh my god.

1181
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,440
And Surefour is on fucking support.

1182
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,860
Oh my god.

1183
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,680
You'd think the other team would also have...

1184
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,140
I'm not even Diamond 1.

1185
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,300
I'm Diamond 2.

1186
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,080
So you'd think the other team would also have a Diamond 2 with me.

1187
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,860
But no, the other team is just all GMs.

1188
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,680
It's just all GMs.

1189
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,420
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?

1190
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,600
Where's our tanks?

1191
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,940
Oh, there he is.

1192
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,380
Where's our singular tank?

1193
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,560
Sorry, I meant where's our tank?

1194
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,720
Whoops, I fell down.

1195
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,000
I intentionally fell down.

1196
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,060
I intentionally fell down, guys.

1197
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,060
Okay.

1198
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,360
Guys, it was all intentional.

1199
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,500
Oh my god, we gotta get him away.

1200
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,100
Get him away.

1201
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:27,700
Get him away.

1202
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,320
Alright.

1203
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,600
Thank you.

1204
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:34,380
Alright.

1205
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,800
It's very tactical, guys.

1206
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,880
Oh my god.

1207
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,660
I'm so stressed out already.

1208
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,220
Oh, Pia, thank...

1209
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,140
Oh, shit!

1210
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Hey, Pia.

1211
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,220
This is a real content now.

1212
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,860
Guys, this is very concerning because...

1213
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:56,980
No!

1214
01:18:59,160 --> 01:18:59,680
Alright.

1215
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:01,960
Alright, so...

1216
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,980
I don't know what happened to Surefour there.

1217
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,120
I looked...

1218
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,560
I turned around and he got fucking eaten.

1219
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,000
Okay.

1220
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,340
Alright, where's our Ironman?

1221
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,800
Alright, Ironman, you better fucking carry.

1222
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,180
You're getting the...

1223
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,520
You're getting the...

1224
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,540
The mark...

1225
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,360
Wait, how did he know he had the mark?

1226
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,920
How did he know?

1227
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,240
I'm surprised he's playing Sharp Jeff.

1228
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,210
I'm a little worried here.

1229
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,470
Okay, that's fine.

1230
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,510
Oh, this is so fine.

1231
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:44,770
We're so healthy.

1232
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,190
Oh, it's fine.

1233
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,330
We're so healthy.

1234
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:52,390
We're so...

1235
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:53,330
Oh, he's dead.

1236
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:57,270
I don't know how he's dead, but...

1237
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,050
Oh my god.

1238
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:00,890
Don't...

1239
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,310
Oh, I'm dead too.

1240
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:06,870
Oh, it's fine.

1241
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:08,570
It's fine.

1242
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:10,970
He's mad now.

1243
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:12,090
We're so okay.

1244
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,010
It's so okay.

1245
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,750
It's fine.

1246
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:18,490
See, we won the fight.

1247
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:19,830
I told you guys.

1248
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:21,570
What were you guys so worried about?

1249
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,090
We won the fight, chat.

1250
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,770
There's nothing to be worried about.

1251
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,570
Everything is fine.

1252
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:30,670
Everything is fine.

1253
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,750
Oh, everything is fine.

1254
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:36,730
Everything is still fine.

1255
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:42,990
Everything is still very fine.

1256
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,170
Everything...

1257
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,650
Everything is okay.

1258
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,050
I'm not stressed out.

1259
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,510
I love this game.

1260
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,570
I love Marvel Rivals.

1261
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:57,450
Oh my god.

1262
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:58,610
He's okay.

1263
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,330
Oh my god.

1264
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,310
My hands are shaking a little bit, guys.

1265
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,170
Oh my god.

1266
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,430
My hands are shaking, but I'm okay.

1267
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,770
I'm okay.

1268
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,010
Okay.

1269
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,590
Don't worry.

1270
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:21,950
Iron Man, I got you.

1271
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,850
I got you.

1272
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,910
We dance!

1273
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,450
We keep dancing!

1274
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:34,740
Just...

1275
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:37,410
Just dance!

1276
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:38,490
No!

1277
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,830
Shit.

1278
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,630
Please.

1279
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,150
There's a Venom.

1280
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,750
Dance like it's my concert.

1281
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,450
Okay, see?

1282
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,070
I'm having a great time.

1283
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,570
Oh my god.

1284
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:57,850
He is alive.

1285
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,570
I'm having a great time.

1286
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:09,250
Holy shit.

1287
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:10,990
Oh wait, there's a Bourne again.

1288
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,150
But where is the Bourne?

1289
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,590
Where is he gonna give birth?

1290
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:21,630
Where is he gonna give birth?

1291
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:25,210
It's okay.

1292
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,230
I got you, Iron Man.

1293
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:29,810
We're all okay.

1294
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:33,650
Because I need more stress in my life right after the concert.

1295
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:42,450
That's definitely what I needed right after a stressful concert.

1296
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:47,930
Oh no.

1297
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:49,730
Mad.

1298
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:53,330
Holy shit.

1299
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,050
He went to Ning.

1300
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:54,930
Oh, goodbye.

1301
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:58,990
Oh my god.

1302
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:00,350
Oh my god, he lives?

1303
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,390
Oh, never mind.

1304
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:05,650
Never mind.

1305
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:11,570
Never mind.

1306
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,530
He's still alive.

1307
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,470
Jesus Christ.

1308
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:18,390
I did nothing.

1309
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:19,510
Go!

1310
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:20,170
Live!

1311
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,370
Live!

1312
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,490
Dance!

1313
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:24,710
Dance, everybody!

1314
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:25,870
Don't!

1315
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:26,430
You died.

1316
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,110
That's fine.

1317
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,110
Keep dancing!

1318
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,590
Okay.

1319
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:34,310
That...

1320
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,950
I did not think he was gonna do all of that.

1321
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:45,970
That's fine.

1322
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,370
He's so low.

1323
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:49,770
Oh my god, he's so low.

1324
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,370
Oh, and then the Bourne again.

1325
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:53,450
That's okay.

1326
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,830
That's okay, he just gave birth to one guy.

1327
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:58,210
Go, Adam, go!

1328
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:00,930
What?!

1329
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:04,670
Okay, I did not think he was gonna...

1330
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,830
Oh my god, please.

1331
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,330
I'm so scared.

1332
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,370
We got it!

1333
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:20,050
We got it!

1334
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,310
No!

1335
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:23,970
It's fine!

1336
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:26,650
Oh no, he's not fine!

1337
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,250
Oh, he got it!

1338
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:28,370
He got somebody in!

1339
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,050
We're so fine!

1340
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:34,590
I'm fucking...

1341
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:35,270
I'm skating!

1342
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:37,170
I'm skating!

1343
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:44,550
I'm still skating!

1344
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:51,750
Oh my god.

1345
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,410
I don't know if I can grab ult in time, though.

1346
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,770
No, I'm asleep!

1347
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,670
What do you mean?!

1348
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:12,930
He just appeared!

1349
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:19,510
He only leaves him when he's dead!

1350
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,050
Oh my god!

1351
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,130
It only leaves Arman when he's dead!

1352
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,510
I had to heal somebody!

1353
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:28,330
I...

1354
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:31,610
I literally...

1355
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,710
I had to heal someone!

1356
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:35,530
He's not the...

1357
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,350
When he's not alive!

1358
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:41,290
Like...

1359
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:44,610
It's not like he lives forever!

1360
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,610
Sometimes he's dead!

1361
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,650
Oh my god.

1362
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:56,190
We're all dancing!

1363
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:59,790
We're still dancing!

1364
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:01,150
Oh,

1365
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,560
he's still angry.

1366
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,280
He's still so angry.

1367
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:16,800
No!

1368
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,400
What do you mean?!

1369
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:23,920
No!

1370
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:37,980
Oh, he's frozen!

1371
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,100
Oh my god!

1372
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,320
Why am I in a gym?!

1373
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:51,730
Oh my god, please!

1374
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:58,150
You're getting so many kills!

1375
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,950
Please!

1376
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:03,590
You're getting...

1377
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,860
Oh my god, I'm trying!

1378
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,340
Please, no!

1379
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,780
I just need a little bit!

1380
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,420
Just a little bit of a heal still!

1381
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,960
No, I'm coming back!

1382
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:34,680
They said...

1383
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:35,000
No!

1384
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,760
I am 98!

1385
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,100
Oh my god.

1386
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,860
I know, it's so... I'm so...

1387
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,720
I'm so relaxed right now.

1388
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,540
I'm so fucking relaxed.

1389
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,980
I'm so...

1390
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,600
No, they're yelling!

1391
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,520
He's actually not even close, bro.

1392
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,200
He's good with the Hulk passive.

1393
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,680
But without it, he's useless.

1394
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,140
He's obviously trolling you.

1395
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,440
This game's not our fault, bro.

1396
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,200
LOL

1397
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,860
I'm healing for my fucking life right now!

1398
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,640
This is my second time on Ironman, bro.

1399
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,620
This is my second time on Ironman!

1400
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,700
What's going on?

1401
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,120
What's going on to our team right now?

1402
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,660
It's all falling apart!

1403
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:54,300
No!

1404
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:01,560
LOL Dance harder, Doki!

1405
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,480
You gotta keep dancing!

1406
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,760
I'm hurt.

1407
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,320
I'm scared.

1408
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,100
I'm hurt and I'm scared.

1409
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,620
Bro, he's flying.

1410
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,780
He's flying so much.

1411
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,660
Please, Ironman, don't die!

1412
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,900
Just live!

1413
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,760
Just live!

1414
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,680
Please!

1415
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,720
Every resource possible is going to you!

1416
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,260
Please!

1417
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,340
We're putting everything into you!

1418
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,680
If I don't, they'll yell at me and I'll cry!

1419
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,100
LOL

1420
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:18,680
Legitimately, every single resource went to him.

1421
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,300
How are we still fighting this?

1422
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:27,440
I need help!

1423
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,530
It's okay, a minute.

1424
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,490
You need me.

1425
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:41,830
We're on a show!

1426
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:43,910
Yep, I'm looking out for you.

1427
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,050
I wish I could do it easier.

1428
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,710
Oh my god!

1429
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:54,130
How are we still fighting this?

1430
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,370
You got a Venom on you?

1431
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:57,830
Okay, there you go.

1432
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,050
You got a Venom on you?

1433
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:01,830
Where is he?

1434
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,030
Just slam the wall.

1435
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:09,550
Where's the Ironman?

1436
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,010
Where's this fucker?

1437
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:12,450
Alright.

1438
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:15,690
That's fine.

1439
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:20,090
I like how we have commers that don't even comm who they're fucking attacking.

1440
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:21,310
Then why open your mouth?

1441
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:31,770
Why even talk at that point if you're not even gonna say who you're gonna fucking target?

1442
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:45,620
Okay.

1443
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,860
Alright, that's fine.

1444
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,040
I'm going for more, hold on.

1445
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:52,320
Oh

1446
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:59,870
my god, just slam please!

1447
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:07,270
Like why use comms if you don't even comm anything?

1448
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:11,650
I'm just, I don't understand!

1449
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:17,070
What's the point of opening your mouth?

1450
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,130
It's fine.

1451
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:25,210
We're fine.

1452
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:26,290
I'm so fine.

1453
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:31,870
You better live, you fuck- Are

1454
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:41,220
we okay?

1455
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,380
Is it safe now?

1456
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:48,360
I like how we just walked in the- like do we come out?

1457
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:50,560
Do we come out of our hidey hole?

1458
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:51,940
Are we okay?

1459
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:01,440
Oh no.

1460
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,820
Oh no.

1461
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,460
What if it's again?

1462
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:14,230
Please!

1463
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:16,350
No!

1464
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,380
Oh my god, they're using their mouths!

1465
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,080
They're using their mouths, guys!

1466
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,820
They're comming who they're attacking!

1467
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,640
Just kill point, just kill whoever touches.

1468
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,920
Oh my god!

1469
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,720
Oh we're gonna, oh we're gonna commit to this?

1470
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,520
Okay, we're- he committed!

1471
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,020
Why did he commit?

1472
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:51,200
He committed!

1473
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,600
Oh my god.

1474
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,160
Do they have a better team than us?

1475
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,420
Is that it?

1476
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,920
I'm running in the skybox.

1477
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,640
Do they see me?

1478
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,940
Is it cause they have- oh!

1479
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:19,900
Oh goodbye!

1480
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,220
Hello!

1481
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:27,840
Hello!

1482
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,780
Oh no, not again.

1483
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,580
Oh my god, what?!

1484
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:40,880
Okay, I didn't see that.

1485
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,660
I was like, where's that?

1486
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,840
Where's- oh, right there!

1487
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,340
I was like, where did that come from?

1488
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,200
We have zero targeting.

1489
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,180
What's the problem?

1490
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:04,000
I don't know, maybe like we don't work together?

1491
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1492
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:10,480
What?

1493
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,830
You're literally the first person I see!

1494
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:29,090
What do you mean I don't see anybody else in front of me?!

1495
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,670
What?

1496
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:38,310
I'm only putting it on because I don't see anyone else!

1497
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:45,220
Like, what am I supposed to do when no one else is in my view?!

1498
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:53,870
Like, I don't- Like, please!

1499
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:08,010
Winning the last lane.

1500
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:10,870
Everyone loves that.

1501
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:14,370
Like, I spawn in and it's like, why do I have orb?

1502
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:17,450
I don't fucking know, why are you in front of me?!

1503
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:20,950
Alright.

1504
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:38,070
Why the fuck is this fucker in front of me?!

1505
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:42,110
Okay.

1506
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,220
Fine, that's fine.

1507
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,660
That's fine.

1508
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,360
Where is this?

1509
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:14,500
No!

1510
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,220
Bro, they're roasting!

1511
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:26,700
They're actually flaming Shurifor!

1512
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,400
Bro, you're so fucking stupid!

1513
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,480
Imagine flaming Shurifor!

1514
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:37,020
Holy shit!

1515
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,420
Imagine flaming Shurifor!

1516
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:43,120
That's actually crazy!

1517
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:48,540
That man is like a fucking gamer and you're gonna flame him!

1518
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,560
Deserved!

1519
01:37:52,140 --> 01:38:00,320
Holy shit, if you don't- Oh my god!

1520
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,060
That's actually crazy.

1521
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,980
That's- That's actually- He doesn't know!

1522
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,860
Oh my god!

1523
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,160
That's actually insane!

1524
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:36,000
Who the fuck is- Just assume me, I'm confused.

1525
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,400
Bro has no idea.

1526
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:46,260
And the fact that I'm streaming and he's streaming too!

1527
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,920
This bro has no idea!

1528
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,610
He fucking roasted-

1529
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:58,740
He roasted a guy who is like known as one of the best Overwatch League players.

1530
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,600
That's actually insane!

1531
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,140
That he got literally paid to play video games.

1532
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:15,620
He's so- And he's just a fucking lowly G Grandmaster 3 on Magneto.

1533
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,240
They don't know, they don't know I'm Shurifor.

1534
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:44,240
Wait, he was?

1535
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,060
I thought he was just a dude!

1536
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,080
Just like some guy, you know?

1537
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:49,740
Just some guy.

1538
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,680
Alright, I'm focusing up right now.

1539
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:16,760
By the way.

1540
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:24,860
Thank you.

1541
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,800
Thank you for the little poke, I got a little worried.

1542
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,420
When I'm not full HP.

1543
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,640
And when you're not full HP, it's a little worrisome.

1544
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:41,980
Oh my god.

1545
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:56,380
You're all one!

1546
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,500
Alright, we're fine.

1547
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:12,100
I know him as Doki's friend!

1548
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:13,600
Oh, don't tell him that.

1549
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,040
Don't hurt his ego.

1550
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,800
Doki's plus one.

1551
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:41,100
I have no idea, he's just a guy that's just really, really good at video games.

1552
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,320
He's just some guy.

1553
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:48,720
Yeah, he was known as one of the best Widowmakers in Overwatch League.

1554
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,840
He also was like... I used to watch him in Overwatch.

1555
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:57,740
He was like one of the most famous Overwatch streamers back then.

1556
01:41:58,580 --> 01:41:59,900
But he's just some guy.

1557
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,520
Now he's gonna throw the game.

1558
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:18,520
He's...

1559
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,360
He's just a chill guy.

1560
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:27,620
Okay, now he's a furry.

1561
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:27,680
Sorry.

1562
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,950
I still think it was fucking wild.

1563
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:43,130
That...

1564
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:47,770
That he was like...

1565
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,680
You're fine.

1566
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,080
Oh nice, we did it!

1567
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:04,720
We won!

1568
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,720
We fucking won!

1569
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,040
Oh my god!

1570
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,090
Nice, we did it.

1571
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:17,730
EZ carry!

1572
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:20,610
The lack of self-awareness!

1573
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,850
Holy fuck!

1574
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:25,530
He wasn't even like MVP!

1575
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:27,890
Oh my god!

1576
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:30,990
The lack of self- Look at that diamond one, here we go.

1577
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:37,130
The lack of fucking self-awareness this guy has is crazy.

1578
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:40,590
No fucking way.

1579
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:48,430
That's like crazy!

1580
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,770
Look at this dude.

1581
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:52,650
Oh my god.

1582
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:56,230
I can't believe he said that.

1583
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,870
That's insane.

1584
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:00,010
That's insane.

1585
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:03,290
Wait, 22k?

1586
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,210
Bro, he's like catching up.

1587
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,690
Oh my god.

1588
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:16,930
And we got diamond one.

1589
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:18,870
That's nothing.

1590
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:21,470
You're either grandmaster or bust.

1591
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,270
Oh my god.

1592
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,850
Stupid diamond one play, I'm sorry.

1593
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:27,990
Hello everybody.

1594
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:34,050
I'm the child that showed up.

1595
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:40,010
You know, when they bring a child to like a group hangout.

1596
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,180
When they bring the child.

1597
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,980
You want to just super again?

1598
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:02,610
Sure.

1599
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:05,690
Yo, what's up, what's up, what's up?

1600
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:06,350
I'm here, I'm here.

1601
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:07,670
They banned my wolverine!

1602
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:09,830
Are you throwing, bro?

1603
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:13,750
They banned my fucking wolverine!

1604
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:16,490
Alright, where is it?

1605
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,990
You're already ruining your mental, so...

1606
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:21,710
Uh, where's mine?

1607
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:23,370
Have you just been running it on wolverine, bro?

1608
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:24,750
Yes, I have!

1609
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:26,610
Dude, my fucking win rate is high.

1610
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:27,590
I'm nominated.

1611
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:28,290
Well, not last game.

1612
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:30,090
We shit on you.

1613
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:31,410
Wait, what's your win rate?

1614
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:35,150
Fucking 80 to 10 on wolverine?

1615
01:45:35,490 --> 01:45:38,070
8 to 10?

1616
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:39,490
Wait, 8 to 10?

1617
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,830
You don't know about my iron man.

1618
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:45,670
If you got a hulk?

1619
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,530
Yeah, we got a hulk right now.

1620
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:52,050
No, he only won.

1621
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:53,490
Oh my god.

1622
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:59,450
Alright, time to lock in.

1623
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:03,550
They don't know about my iron man.

1624
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:05,730
Has he even played iron man?

1625
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:06,890
Has he?

1626
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:08,950
No longer.

1627
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:10,990
Yo, check me out.

1628
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,050
I can't check it mid game.

1629
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:14,810
It's inspiring.

1630
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:20,090
Alright, this will be fun.

1631
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:21,530
I'll do like what they did.

1632
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:23,990
Just have it on the iron man, right?

1633
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,920
Oops, I messed up.

1634
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,220
I have like 4 of them falling.

1635
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,620
And 3 of them just fall out of it.

1636
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,700
Wait, tell me if they're TPing.

1637
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,240
One of our teammates just shit talked to you, man.

1638
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,400
I see that, man.

1639
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,280
I don't really acknowledge that.

1640
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,220
They are running at you guys right now.

1641
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:05,680
No TP though?

1642
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,140
Nope, no TP.

1643
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:10,340
Okay.

1644
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,160
Okay.

1645
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,200
I don't think they're stupid.

1646
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,120
Wait, they actually walked?

1647
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,420
Oh my god.

1648
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,420
We can't see you guys over there for heals.

1649
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:48,980
I'm gonna go back up here.

1650
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:59,060
Alright, they actually- They actually took the portal!

1651
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,460
Is that fucking crazy?

1652
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,740
That's so dumb.

1653
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,540
I can't believe they actually took the portal.

1654
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,800
That's actually crazy that that worked.

1655
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,340
You don't expect that to work.

1656
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:26,640
I need to give it to one of the tanks.

1657
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,440
Okay, I got on the tank.

1658
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:36,140
I have to heal here because I don't want to get fucking arrowed to the head.

1659
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:40,620
Oh no, he's mad.

1660
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,200
He's so mad.

1661
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,860
It's fine.

1662
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:55,060
Alright.

1663
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,920
Oh my god.

1664
01:48:58,660 --> 01:48:59,980
Get in the ult!

1665
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,240
Get in the ult!

1666
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:09,920
She's one, she's one!

1667
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:12,620
No!

1668
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,380
She's so low!

1669
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:25,760
What the fuck is going- Oh, he was trying to- I danced, but the dancing was no use.

1670
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,600
I'm coming over!

1671
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,770
Oh my god.

1672
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:52,330
Oh my god, okay.

1673
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:54,710
Oh!

1674
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:57,010
I danced so hard!

1675
01:49:57,130 --> 01:50:00,290
How much more do I have to dance?!

1676
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:10,650
How much more do I have to dance?!

1677
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:15,510
Okay.

1678
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,050
It's fine.

1679
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:29,280
Oh, Sylar?

1680
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:35,410
Oh my god, he's so mad!

1681
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:40,070
Oh my god, I don't know what he's doing!

1682
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:43,130
He's trying to do what they did last game!

1683
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:54,950
Oh my god.

1684
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:56,110
Is our Hulk still alive?!

1685
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:58,050
What's he doing over there?!

1686
01:50:58,650 --> 01:50:59,830
Okay, alright.

1687
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,850
Nevermind.

1688
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:03,370
He was still alive.

1689
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:19,410
Nice.

1690
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:24,300
Oh.

1691
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,920
My god, I'm still okay.

1692
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,500
I'm still okay.

1693
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,760
I'm a little scared.

1694
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:41,260
We're gonna dance!

1695
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,840
We go!

1696
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,520
Oh my god, okay.

1697
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,620
She's frozen?

1698
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,570
You're alive?

1699
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,560
Oh my god, please!

1700
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:15,700
I'm still dancing!

1701
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,280
Oh my god, you're still alive!

1702
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:33,280
You're still...

1703
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:40,240
Oh my god, how much more?!

1704
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,840
Oh my god, he takes so much damage!

1705
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:56,400
It's fine!

1706
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,960
Everything is fine!

1707
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,720
Don't look at Surefour's KDA.

1708
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:05,400
Surefour, what's up with your KDA?

1709
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:22,510
Oh my god.

1710
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:26,990
I'll do this after his.

1711
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:29,290
Okay, I'll do it now!

1712
01:53:29,870 --> 01:53:30,850
I'll do it now!

1713
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,210
I'll do it now!

1714
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:39,350
Alright, that's fine.

1715
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:45,090
That's fine.

1716
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,180
Nice.

1717
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:53,560
Wait, born again?!

1718
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:54,560
What?

1719
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:57,140
Alright, we're fine.

1720
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:02,500
Yeah, this is how I celebrate my win!

1721
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,880
I play Marvel Rivals.

1722
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:07,020
That's how I celebrate.

1723
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:11,100
That's how we should always celebrate Marvel Rivals.

1724
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:18,640
Oh my god, the Atom gave birth to six tuplets and they all died.

1725
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:19,860
That's so sad.

1726
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:23,840
That's so sad.

1727
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:25,700
I hate the Luna skin.

1728
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:27,080
I might buy the Christmas one.

1729
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:30,180
I might buy the Christmas skin, because that one's pretty.

1730
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,180
Guys, we're celebrating.

1731
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:35,500
We're celebrating.

1732
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:42,840
The concept was the pre-show for the...

1733
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,660
For Marvel Rivals.

1734
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:46,120
True.

1735
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:50,850
True.

1736
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:51,490
I don't know if I said that!

1737
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:53,490
I don't even keep this on him!

1738
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:08,250
Wait, is my mic working?

1739
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:11,170
I don't even know if he heard me.

1740
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:12,830
Oh, that sucks.

1741
01:55:14,930 --> 01:55:16,970
I was just gonna ask if you still play Deadlock at all.

1742
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:23,850
I don't know if he heard me say, what's wrong with your KDA.

1743
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:24,790
I'm TP'ing!

1744
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:25,810
I'm TP'ing!

1745
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:26,890
Mine's gonna be to the right.

1746
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,710
Mine's the good one.

1747
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:30,770
What are they trying to do?

1748
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:33,330
I'm right behind them.

1749
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:33,930
I'm doing it fast.

1750
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:34,470
Go, go, go!

1751
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:40,230
What the...

1752
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:40,630
What?

1753
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:43,030
Oh my god, I got him.

1754
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:45,890
Oh my god, that's so scary!

1755
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:47,330
That's so...

1756
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:49,030
That's such a scary TP!

1757
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,270
Holy shit!

1758
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:53,330
I'm so scared!

1759
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:54,710
I was gonna jump!

1760
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:01,710
I was so scared!

1761
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:03,730
I was gonna jump into that.

1762
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:06,750
Oh my god, I got fucking shit on.

1763
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:10,370
Now we're thinking with portals, right?

1764
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:14,330
I was like, oh my god, we're gonna accidentally walk into the fucking portal.

1765
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:18,810
They try to counter the TP with TP.

1766
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:20,470
That's actually fucking crazy.

1767
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,730
That was such a crazy tech there.

1768
01:56:26,810 --> 01:56:28,330
That's grandmaster right there.

1769
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:39,150
Oh no.

1770
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,030
Am I just...

1771
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:43,470
That's so fucking scary!

1772
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:45,890
That's fucking...

1773
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:47,650
That's a freaking flyswatter.

1774
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:55,810
That's crazy.

1775
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:01,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

1776
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,090
I had...

1777
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:06,270
Oh, I'm so fucking dead.

1778
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:11,290
Unless...

1779
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:12,950
Oh no, I could've ulted!

1780
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:13,430
No!

1781
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,680
I fucked up.

1782
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,840
I could've ulted there.

1783
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:20,840
I didn't ult.

1784
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,960
I was too busy looking up.

1785
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:31,500
It's fine.

1786
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:32,840
We're baiting ults.

1787
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:37,020
Alright.

1788
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:42,690
I'm gonna make sure he doesn't die.

1789
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,700
It'll be fine.

1790
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,400
I'm going in.

1791
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,280
I'm going in.

1792
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:00,540
We're dancing!

1793
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,400
He has the eye!

1794
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,240
He has the eye!

1795
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,200
I knew it.

1796
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:09,140
I knew it.

1797
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,340
I fucking knew it.

1798
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,000
No, he's so low!

1799
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:12,260
No!

1800
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,940
He's going again!

1801
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,300
Don't let him do it!

1802
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,420
No, he gave birth!

1803
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:22,620
Oh nice, we got it.

1804
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:25,540
Alright, we got it.

1805
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,440
Oh no, he used me for again.

1806
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:37,640
When he goes again...

1807
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,420
What do I do?

1808
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:41,020
What do I do when he goes again?

1809
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,800
I just die.

1810
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:48,870
No.

1811
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,520
Okay.

1812
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:57,480
Don't worry, he'll do something with this.

1813
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:02,300
Oh my god, whenever he comes in, I fucking...

1814
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,220
I don't know what to do.

1815
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:04,440
He scares me.

1816
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,980
Whenever he jumps in like that...

1817
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,300
It's like a fucking fly.

1818
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:11,680
It's like...

1819
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:17,100
It's like a fucking Hulk roll out there.

1820
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:25,150
Yay!

1821
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:35,490
Yeah, he won with...

1822
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:37,130
He raised his win rate.

1823
01:59:37,410 --> 01:59:38,850
He raised his...

1824
01:59:40,330 --> 01:59:42,130
His Ironman win rate.

1825
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:43,070
He's not wrong.

1826
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:44,970
He has a positive win rate on Ironman.

1827
01:59:45,290 --> 01:59:47,870
He's not wrong about that.

1828
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,230
Oh my god, they have...

1829
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:57,450
They have two diamond players.

1830
01:59:57,450 --> 01:59:58,450
Oh my god.

1831
01:59:58,450 --> 01:59:59,930
I'm not alone.

1832
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:02,130
Oh my god, guys.

1833
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:06,490
We have one of the OG goat creators.

1834
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:07,870
This is the fucker.

1835
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:09,910
One of the fuckers that made goats.

1836
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:11,470
That's him.

1837
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:13,790
That's him.

1838
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:15,750
He did this.

1839
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:23,250
He created...

1840
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:24,730
He was part of the problem.

1841
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,890
Yeah, that's him.

1842
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:30,610
He's one of the guys that made goats.

1843
02:00:31,710 --> 02:00:32,770
The founder.

1844
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:38,510
It's goading time.

1845
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:45,170
Alright, what are they banning?

1846
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:46,210
Wait, who this guy?

1847
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:47,250
Kalug?

1848
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:48,310
He's part of...

1849
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:50,430
He was in the OG goats team.

1850
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:53,870
That created one of the worst metas in Overwatch.

1851
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:55,090
But they won.

1852
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:56,930
They won the Overwatch.

1853
02:00:57,170 --> 02:00:57,990
What is it?

1854
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:59,790
Open division?

1855
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:06,700
He did it.

1856
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:08,720
At what cost?

1857
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:09,360
He won.

1858
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,920
Basically, that's the cost.

1859
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:14,160
They won.

1860
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:15,900
It was open division.

1861
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,320
Basically, for those who don't know...

1862
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,220
Overwatch stuff but know Apex...

1863
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,560
It's basically like pro league.

1864
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,200
He won pro league.

1865
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:26,240
Pro league.

1866
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,860
It's not always about winning.

1867
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,580
At least he's not in the C9 team.

1868
02:01:31,740 --> 02:01:33,240
Oh, you know who's in the C9 team?

1869
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:34,020
Surefour?

1870
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:42,040
He was part of the team where C9 originated from.

1871
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,380
He was there.

1872
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:47,320
We have history all here.

1873
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,880
They're all here.

1874
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:53,140
He was actually in that game when it happened.

1875
02:01:58,380 --> 02:01:59,820
He was part of it.

1876
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,120
What?

1877
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:08,280
They're like, at least it's not Cloud9.

1878
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,260
Oh, but we have someone in there who is.

1879
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:11,800
He's right here.

1880
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,660
What about me?

1881
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:16,540
I was just here.

1882
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:30,980
The world is an endless circle.

1883
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,160
They're all standing in a nice line.

1884
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,120
They stopped standing in a nice line.

1885
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,920
I forgot to re-bind my audio stuff.

1886
02:02:57,820 --> 02:02:59,560
We can kill him.

1887
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:04,740
It's fine.

1888
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:09,310
Nice.

1889
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:12,790
Okay, we should go back to the front.

1890
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:16,210
Two people with the most important esport history.

1891
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:17,230
You're right.

1892
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:22,430
They were all part of the most important esport history.

1893
02:03:23,370 --> 02:03:25,790
And they're all in this game right now.

1894
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:30,470
I know he's good.

1895
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:41,300
Really?

1896
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:41,620
Who?

1897
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:49,250
I'm gonna play my favorite spot after I drop down here.

1898
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:52,210
And then play my favorite spot, which is here.

1899
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,450
Let's hope they don't die after I turn around.

1900
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:01,790
I turned around and I was like, I hope they're okay.

1901
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:03,390
I'm not looking at anything right now.

1902
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:06,550
I'm not gonna look at them for healing.

1903
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:09,850
Because I wanna show you my favorite spot on stream.

1904
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:17,730
Two out of three of my people I watch are on Marble Rivals as it should be.

1905
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:20,650
Isn't that great?

1906
02:04:22,230 --> 02:04:24,430
Yeah, but are they in my elo?

1907
02:04:25,410 --> 02:04:30,090
Are they as high quality gaming as this right now?

1908
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:32,570
That's right.

1909
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:37,090
It is.

1910
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:41,570
Okay, but are they on Luna Snow?

1911
02:04:44,050 --> 02:04:47,890
Are they dancing like I am dancing right now?

1912
02:04:48,730 --> 02:04:49,570
Are they dancing?

1913
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:55,170
Yeah, that's right.

1914
02:04:56,450 --> 02:05:01,530
You get to see the cool ass dancing that I'm doing on the other streams.

1915
02:05:03,790 --> 02:05:05,050
Oh well.

1916
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:10,620
Get your dances here.

1917
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:14,000
Whoa, real dancing?

1918
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:22,300
Oh god, please, please don't die.

1919
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:22,680
Please.

1920
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:24,020
Please don't die.

1921
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:25,380
Please.

1922
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,140
Please don't die.

1923
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,680
That's all I ask.

1924
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:32,400
Don't die.

1925
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,820
Don't die.

1926
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:38,920
I just realized Surefour is on Moon Knight.

1927
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:43,760
Wait, where's...

1928
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:44,960
Oh shit.

1929
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,180
Oh he's... Oh my god!

1930
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:48,600
That block was insane though!

1931
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:51,040
Okay, they're dead.

1932
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:51,820
Our team's dead.

1933
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,420
That was an insane block though!

1934
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,320
But our team's dead, but that's okay.

1935
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,880
At least that block was crazy cool.

1936
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:04,240
Like, you know?

1937
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:05,640
It's cool to watch.

1938
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:13,210
Let's keep dancing.

1939
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:15,350
We're all just...

1940
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:18,430
I guess we just keep dancing.

1941
02:06:22,290 --> 02:06:23,590
That's cool.

1942
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:30,210
We're still dancing!

1943
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:31,850
Yeah!

1944
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:35,990
We're putting on a show!

1945
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:42,450
Dance the pain away!

1946
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:44,010
See?

1947
02:06:44,150 --> 02:06:44,890
They're not dancing.

1948
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:46,650
I'm not like other VTubers.

1949
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:51,670
I dance in the video game too.

1950
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:54,030
Okay, let's get rid of this.

1951
02:06:54,370 --> 02:06:55,730
I don't want to push this.

1952
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:57,390
I don't want to talk to people anymore.

1953
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:00,190
I only talk because Super was there.

1954
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:06,610
And I know Surefour likes talking when Super was there, so I was like I want to be part of this.

1955
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:09,170
I don't want to be left out.

1956
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:13,130
Don, thank you for the magenta super!

1957
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:14,630
Thank you, thank you!

1958
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:21,290
If all else perished and he remained, I should still continue to be.

1959
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:24,790
And if all else remains and he were annihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger.

1960
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:27,890
If your world wanted your friend dead, would you still try to save her?

1961
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:28,970
Is this about dancing?

1962
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:31,610
Thank you for the magenta super!

1963
02:07:31,930 --> 02:07:33,050
Thank you, thank you!

1964
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:35,550
Is this part of dancing?

1965
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,990
Is this about dancing, Don?

1966
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:47,310
Yeah, you're welcome!

1967
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:49,250
You know why he hasn't died once?

1968
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:51,430
That's right!

1969
02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:52,250
It's me!

1970
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:53,230
Yeah!

1971
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:54,830
It's me!

1972
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:56,210
That's right!

1973
02:07:57,950 --> 02:07:59,370
I did that!

1974
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:00,870
Yep!

1975
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:14,610
What?!

1976
02:08:14,610 --> 02:08:15,970
Oh, I can heal from here.

1977
02:08:16,690 --> 02:08:17,330
Don't worry!

1978
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:18,970
Don't worry, I got you!

1979
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:22,510
Don't worry!

1980
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:22,550
Don't worry!

1981
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:26,470
When this portal is gone, he's so fucked!

1982
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:28,190
He's so fucked!

1983
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:28,870
The portal!

1984
02:08:29,210 --> 02:08:30,110
I'm sorry, bro!

1985
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:31,630
We can't help you anymore!

1986
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:33,550
We can't, bro!

1987
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:35,630
I'm sorry, bro!

1988
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:38,510
When you're alive?!

1989
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:42,510
When he's alive?!

1990
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:45,230
That is...

1991
02:08:45,230 --> 02:08:46,790
That's actually crazy that he lived.

1992
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:48,870
I'm actually so surprised.

1993
02:08:50,690 --> 02:08:52,870
Well, guys...

1994
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:53,970
His one...

1995
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:55,050
No more one death.

1996
02:08:56,570 --> 02:08:59,810
He lived longer when he was away from us.

1997
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:03,050
The clip portal is amazing!

1998
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:07,130
Oh, surefour!

1999
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:08,290
Oh!

2000
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,750
It's okay, I'll pretend I...

2001
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:15,590
Don't tell him I saw that.

2002
02:09:18,090 --> 02:09:19,650
Don't tell him I saw that.

2003
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:24,220
Oh my god, wait.

2004
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,060
That was weird.

2005
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,900
I, like, lagged there a little bit.

2006
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:29,440
Oh!

2007
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:30,340
That's fine.

2008
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:33,340
I have ult soon.

2009
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:34,620
That's fine.

2010
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:38,500
Alright.

2011
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:43,200
I'm gonna save this a little bit and then I'll use it right now!

2012
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:44,920
Oh!

2013
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:46,200
It's fine.

2014
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:49,360
That's fine.

2015
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,560
We're dancing!

2016
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:54,340
We're gonna keep dancing!

2017
02:09:59,020 --> 02:09:59,900
Yes!

2018
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:02,060
I'm a gamer!

2019
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:14,190
There we go.

2020
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:18,490
There we go, we did it.

2021
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:21,250
We're fine.

2022
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:22,930
I counter-danced.

2023
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:25,090
Easy.

2024
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:26,050
I'm gaming.

2025
02:10:26,650 --> 02:10:28,370
Thank you for freelo.

2026
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:36,070
Bro, this guy does not know we have two Overwatch legends on our team.

2027
02:10:36,270 --> 02:10:37,910
We literally have...

2028
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:39,990
It's not because he was freelo.

2029
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:44,410
We literally have two Overwatch legends.

2030
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:47,450
He doesn't know.

2031
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:49,550
He doesn't know.

2032
02:10:55,610 --> 02:10:57,450
Oh my god.

2033
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:00,010
We're winning!

2034
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:01,430
Yippee!

2035
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:06,670
Make that three?

2036
02:11:06,910 --> 02:11:07,870
No, I wasn't...

2037
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:09,330
I wasn't nobody.

2038
02:11:09,870 --> 02:11:12,410
I just loved the game a lot.

2039
02:11:12,750 --> 02:11:15,470
I just really, really liked Overwatch.

2040
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,490
What even is his...

2041
02:11:20,490 --> 02:11:22,610
I need to check his win rate on Ironman.

2042
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:25,310
Statistic.

2043
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:29,310
57 minutes.

2044
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:31,130
Oh shit, wait!

2045
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:33,350
That's actually a really good win rate.

2046
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:35,930
Wait a minute.

2047
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:38,110
We gave him that.

2048
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,770
We did lose one though.

2049
02:11:40,270 --> 02:11:44,670
Wait, I was not expecting his win rate to actually be that good.

2050
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:46,090
Oh my god, that's crazy.

2051
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:48,850
Wait, yeah.

2052
02:11:49,230 --> 02:11:50,130
That's really good.

2053
02:11:50,130 --> 02:11:55,190
I guess we enabled him so hard that...

2054
02:11:57,730 --> 02:12:03,450
Sorry, I got a DM and it was like, oh here are some photos from the streamer and I'm just like, but I wasn't there.

2055
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:11,750
Technically, I was there.

2056
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:13,490
I was on the iPad.

2057
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:17,390
But I was just like, how would there be any photos of me there?

2058
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:23,610
I guess you just see me see my iPad.

2059
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:25,670
I guess that's it.

2060
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:31,140
Yippee!

2061
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:34,140
That was the PNG.

2062
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:34,840
That was me.

2063
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:35,700
That was the PNG.

2064
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:37,380
Alright.

2065
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:39,520
If we win this, we'll end it.

2066
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,540
Wait, actually, if we win, I think we need two games.

2067
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,160
I don't think the next game...

2068
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:45,240
The next game is GM.

2069
02:12:45,480 --> 02:12:46,200
I don't think so.

2070
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:49,300
I think I need to win another game for that.

2071
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:49,360
What is that?

2072
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,220
Is Surefour top 500 yet?

2073
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:56,060
What is it?

2074
02:12:57,380 --> 02:12:58,280
Oh my god, it's him.

2075
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:03,540
For those who don't remember this guy, this was like...

2076
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,920
I think this... Was this the Hulk guy?

2077
02:13:05,820 --> 02:13:06,600
Was that him?

2078
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:11,160
The guy that was like, what the fuck are you doing to like, me and Surefour?

2079
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:13,080
The guy...

2080
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,800
Was it that guy?

2081
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:18,360
Bro, fuck that guy.

2082
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:22,580
Let's see.

2083
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:22,960
It's GM3.

2084
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:25,480
Is he even in here?

2085
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:26,700
Let's see.

2086
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:29,060
Flower...

2087
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,620
Guys, I know I said one game.

2088
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,320
This is still the one game, guys.

2089
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:35,320
We're still at that one game.

2090
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,160
I mean, it's GM3.

2091
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:39,600
So...

2092
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:41,000
I feel like GM3 is a lot harder.

2093
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:42,000
It must be a lot harder.

2094
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,190
I mean, I'm winning GM games, so...

2095
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:45,520
It's not...

2096
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:47,700
To be fair, I am duoed with Surefour, so...

2097
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:50,220
I just enable him to do the shit he does.

2098
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:51,540
Oh, he's not on it yet.

2099
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:54,460
Oh, it's rank 256?

2100
02:13:58,230 --> 02:13:59,010
Wait, no.

2101
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:00,370
No, that's not even right.

2102
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:02,190
The fuck is 256?

2103
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:05,050
What?

2104
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:16,370
Oh,

2105
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:19,430
wait.

2106
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:21,250
Is he GM2?

2107
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:25,210
No, he's not in there.

2108
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:27,770
He's not in there.

2109
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:30,590
Unless I'm spelling it wrong.

2110
02:14:32,270 --> 02:14:33,110
Sad.

2111
02:14:35,070 --> 02:14:35,910
Sadness.

2112
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:40,190
How is he not there?

2113
02:14:40,330 --> 02:14:41,110
Wait a minute.

2114
02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:44,270
Wait, he's GM2?

2115
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:50,350
Oh, he's 202.

2116
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:56,350
God, but he's GM2 already.

2117
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:02,390
He's GM2 already.

2118
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:03,550
That's fucking crazy.

2119
02:15:05,150 --> 02:15:07,930
No wonder games are taking much longer now.

2120
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:10,130
No wonder.

2121
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:15,890
Oh my god.

2122
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:17,070
We're too high rank.

2123
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:21,290
Games are taking so much longer because we're so high rank now.

2124
02:15:24,070 --> 02:15:25,790
Do I recognize anybody?

2125
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:26,770
No.

2126
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:28,470
Not on our team or the enemy team.

2127
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:29,430
Oh my gosh.

2128
02:15:29,890 --> 02:15:30,910
Hello, everybody.

2129
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:33,530
I'm Diamond 1.

2130
02:15:33,670 --> 02:15:35,210
It's nice to meet you all.

2131
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:48,040
It's me.

2132
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:53,480
Sitting in the grown-up table.

2133
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:55,600
Don't worry.

2134
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:57,660
I'm wearing my big boy pants today.

2135
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:03,460
Squeaker alert.

2136
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:04,560
Squeaker.

2137
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:06,820
Get the fuck out of our lobby.

2138
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:07,520
Squeaker.

2139
02:16:12,190 --> 02:16:14,050
Can I have some chicken nuggets?

2140
02:16:20,230 --> 02:16:22,490
I wanna be Luna Snow.

2141
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:23,410
Like the moon.

2142
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:27,930
Is that a 12-year-old boy or a girl?

2143
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:29,750
Oh, I got that a lot.

2144
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:33,450
I got that a lot.

2145
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:35,510
Growing up.

2146
02:16:35,570 --> 02:16:36,570
I'll be like, a girl.

2147
02:16:38,310 --> 02:16:42,370
Remember when they were like, buy an Iron Fist.

2148
02:16:42,410 --> 02:16:44,430
Is there an Iron Fist player on their team?

2149
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:45,410
We'll do a second one.

2150
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:45,770
I mean.

2151
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:47,090
No.

2152
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:50,610
Oh yeah, because we have an Iron Fist player.

2153
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:58,070
Oh, is Captain Raz a fucking Hawk player?

2154
02:16:58,770 --> 02:16:59,710
A banned Hawk.

2155
02:16:59,810 --> 02:17:00,770
What do I do?

2156
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:01,790
No!

2157
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:04,970
He is a one-trick!

2158
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:13,010
How do you one-trick in GM?

2159
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,510
Like, how?

2160
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:16,950
How do you?

2161
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:21,910
Last night.

2162
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:25,650
Last night, I was playing in Shatter 2K.

2163
02:17:28,930 --> 02:17:31,770
Told me to avoid Mike, and I didn't.

2164
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:33,090
But I didn't listen.

2165
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:33,870
Mike!

2166
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:36,950
No!

2167
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:39,950
Everything's going down!

2168
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:41,870
Why would you say that?

2169
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:43,390
He's literally here!

2170
02:17:45,350 --> 02:17:50,250
And last game, my entire team told me to avoid Mike.

2171
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:51,550
Okay, so.

2172
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:55,730
Last night, I kept queuing into Shatter 2K, and I farmed him.

2173
02:17:56,030 --> 02:18:01,490
Because my team was always like ban Magic and, oh my god, he's a two-trick.

2174
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:02,450
I'm trying to remember what he is.

2175
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:05,310
Ban Magic and Psylocke, because he's a two-trick.

2176
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:10,230
So like, he literally, if he can't play Magic or Psylocke, he loses.

2177
02:18:10,650 --> 02:18:11,610
And that's what I did.

2178
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:15,130
I avoided him, and then I just, we just ban Magic and...

2179
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:21,770
We just ban Magic and Psylocke And he couldn't do anything!

2180
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:25,130
That's so evil!

2181
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:28,770
I like, farmed three games off of him from that.

2182
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:31,070
That's so cruel!

2183
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:34,350
Because, if you're a two-trick, you're doing it wrong.

2184
02:18:39,470 --> 02:18:41,930
I didn't even start it, dude!

2185
02:18:42,110 --> 02:18:45,290
Someone on my team was like, you gotta ban this, and then I learned.

2186
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:48,430
No, I'm not I can ban Luna one-trick.

2187
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:50,250
I can play Cloak and Mantis.

2188
02:18:50,790 --> 02:18:52,410
I just like playing Luna more.

2189
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:54,730
When they ban Luna, I just play Mantis.

2190
02:18:54,830 --> 02:18:58,130
If they ban Mantis and...

2191
02:18:58,130 --> 02:19:00,530
If they ban either of it, I just do the other two.

2192
02:19:02,310 --> 02:19:07,190
The thing is, people would rather ban the support, I mean the DPS than the support.

2193
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:09,090
So they ban one support.

2194
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:12,850
And then, that's all I have to worry about.

2195
02:19:15,370 --> 02:19:17,090
That's how you game the system.

2196
02:19:17,730 --> 02:19:19,930
You have to game the system if you want to climb.

2197
02:19:22,010 --> 02:19:25,130
You always ban people's one-tricks.

2198
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:28,930
It teaches them a lesson to not one-trick.

2199
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:30,890
Because then they can't one-trick anymore.

2200
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:38,130
Oh no, they didn't.

2201
02:19:41,370 --> 02:19:43,870
I think we're gonna die here.

2202
02:19:46,330 --> 02:19:47,490
Don't worry, I got you.

2203
02:19:49,390 --> 02:19:51,650
I don't think we can contest this.

2204
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:53,950
Unless... No, we can't.

2205
02:19:54,910 --> 02:19:55,690
No, we cannot.

2206
02:19:56,490 --> 02:19:58,250
No, we cannot contest this.

2207
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:00,070
Oh, I'm...

2208
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:01,350
My poor Mantis.

2209
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:04,070
My poor Mantis.

2210
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:09,310
Oh.

2211
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:12,990
Oh.

2212
02:20:13,230 --> 02:20:14,510
Oh, I'm just...

2213
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:18,710
Oh my god, I'm just gonna dance!

2214
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:22,710
I'm...

2215
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:23,230
Whoa!

2216
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:24,810
Okay.

2217
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:26,630
Goodbye.

2218
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:36,760
You know, now I know which two players I'm fucking avoiding.

2219
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:39,800
I'm fucking... Now I know.

2220
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:42,360
They were right about Mike.

2221
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:47,660
And our Hulk one-trick.

2222
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:50,080
They were right about two people.

2223
02:20:59,030 --> 02:21:00,010
They were right.

2224
02:21:00,310 --> 02:21:01,510
That's the worst part.

2225
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:06,320
Oh god.

2226
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:08,680
I'm trying to help you.

2227
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:10,380
I'm trying to help you.

2228
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:13,460
Oh my god.

2229
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:14,860
Oh!

2230
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:15,940
Goodbye!

2231
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:18,920
Nice.

2232
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:20,140
He got double.

2233
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:24,440
Um...

2234
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:26,100
What do we do with that?

2235
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:29,180
I'm... I'm dancing!

2236
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:31,440
I'm... I'm dancing!

2237
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:33,160
I'm...

2238
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:34,420
I'm dancing!

2239
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,880
I'm dancing!

2240
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:43,460
I'm dancing.

2241
02:21:45,060 --> 02:21:45,220
Oh.

2242
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:50,360
Oh, he's back.

2243
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:51,280
No!

2244
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:56,640
I felt joy for one second and then our match's rage quit.

2245
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:05,140
That was fucking crazy.

2246
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:11,660
Bro, bro.

2247
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:17,250
Oh my god.

2248
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:20,490
No!

2249
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:21,970
I'm gathering!

2250
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:28,370
Oh, oh, I'm...

2251
02:22:30,890 --> 02:22:32,070
I'm so scared.

2252
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:34,830
Hey guys, hey tanks.

2253
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,990
Oh my god!

2254
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:43,610
Guys, I...

2255
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:45,510
I think...

2256
02:22:46,610 --> 02:22:48,150
I think this is it.

2257
02:22:48,370 --> 02:22:52,390
I think maybe... oh, goodbye.

2258
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:53,930
Goodbye, Mantis.

2259
02:22:54,050 --> 02:22:55,050
If you die, you die.

2260
02:22:56,670 --> 02:22:57,990
Goodbye, I skate.

2261
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:00,270
I skate.

2262
02:23:01,370 --> 02:23:02,290
I still skate.

2263
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:07,970
Oh shit, I might have accidentally baited him.

2264
02:23:08,770 --> 02:23:09,710
I'm still skating.

2265
02:23:11,770 --> 02:23:13,730
Oh my god, he's on Wolverine.

2266
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:17,350
He's gaming now.

2267
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,380
I believe in surefire.

2268
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:26,900
I believe in him.

2269
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:31,820
It's fine.

2270
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:38,820
Oh my god!

2271
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:41,020
Wait, that was so good.

2272
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:42,680
Wait, that was pretty hot.

2273
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:43,840
Did you see that?

2274
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:46,280
Whoa, my FPS brain went...

2275
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:47,920
went whoa.

2276
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:53,540
Yeah, man, that was really cool.

2277
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:53,680
Ow.

2278
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:58,400
Did you guys see that?

2279
02:24:00,020 --> 02:24:02,420
Bro, did you guys see what he did?

2280
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:05,500
He fucking slammed a rock into him and it's all...

2281
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:07,600
We're dead.

2282
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:08,660
We're dead.

2283
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:10,080
Oh, we're alive.

2284
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:16,840
Look, I can appreciate good gameplay.

2285
02:24:24,910 --> 02:24:26,130
Okay, that's fine.

2286
02:24:27,410 --> 02:24:28,450
That's fine.

2287
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,650
That's two minutes left.

2288
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:33,730
Oh, he's so low.

2289
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:36,670
It's fine.

2290
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:37,530
Everything's fine.

2291
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:39,890
Everything's so fine.

2292
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:43,150
We stabilized.

2293
02:24:45,910 --> 02:24:47,150
Yeah, exactly.

2294
02:24:47,330 --> 02:24:48,670
You can appreciate good gamers.

2295
02:24:49,210 --> 02:24:49,730
Good gaming.

2296
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:59,200
I need to learn how to aim my ice better.

2297
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:03,880
Like, I do panic aim instead of, like, actually using it to, like, stop shit.

2298
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:12,480
Come to my concert!

2299
02:25:14,300 --> 02:25:14,880
Yay!

2300
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:17,500
And I leave now.

2301
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:19,140
I leave now.

2302
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:21,480
I... whoop, whoop.

2303
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:22,180
I leave now.

2304
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:23,220
I gotta go.

2305
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:25,500
Oh, this is where we die.

2306
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:27,480
This is where we die.

2307
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:31,420
There's too many offensive ults.

2308
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:32,620
What do I do?

2309
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:37,300
Oh, no.

2310
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:42,600
No way.

2311
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:43,340
No way.

2312
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:44,400
They're blocking the door.

2313
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:47,300
Oh, no.

2314
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:50,520
Go left, we go right.

2315
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:51,120
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

2316
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:56,880
Oh, shit!

2317
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,020
Goodbye, everybody.

2318
02:25:58,120 --> 02:25:59,160
It was nice knowing you all.

2319
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:02,120
I like how they're like, go left!

2320
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:04,060
We all went right.

2321
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:11,120
What the fuck?

2322
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:17,280
You know, we held it pretty well after they steamrolled us for minutes.

2323
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:24,000
They did steamroll us for a long time.

2324
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:29,200
Not very nice.

2325
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:34,980
Okay, I'm gonna avoid Captain Roz and I'll avoid Mike.

2326
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:38,220
How did he get the GM?

2327
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:44,260
How the fuck did Mike get the GM like that?

2328
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:47,260
Of course, it would never happen.

2329
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:48,380
It would never be that easy.

2330
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:54,500
Of fucking course.

2331
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:59,420
It's never that easy.

2332
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:09,230
It was too good to be true, guys.

2333
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:11,630
It was too good to be true.

2334
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:13,290
We saw it.

2335
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:15,490
We saw it.

2336
02:27:15,810 --> 02:27:18,670
Dude, I got like three players, three from my friends a GM.

2337
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:19,710
It's so not fair.

2338
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:22,890
It's um, it's actually not fair.

2339
02:27:22,890 --> 02:27:26,750
I played with three different people and they all got the GM with my duo.

2340
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:29,170
And then like I'm still here in Diamond.

2341
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:32,010
I'm so- It's not fair!

2342
02:27:33,370 --> 02:27:35,390
I wanna be there too!

2343
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:41,930
You were left behind.

2344
02:27:44,930 --> 02:27:50,870
One of them was like, one of them like stopped after I needed like one game to rank up.

2345
02:27:51,570 --> 02:27:54,130
Not to die to GM, but to like, um...

2346
02:27:56,250 --> 02:27:58,350
But to like Diamond 1.

2347
02:27:58,590 --> 02:27:59,530
I was so sad.

2348
02:27:59,830 --> 02:28:01,730
I was like, but I need one!

2349
02:28:07,070 --> 02:28:07,710
Yeah.

2350
02:28:10,390 --> 02:28:11,030
Bro.

2351
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:17,320
Okay, we gotta heal this guy.

2352
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:20,140
Just Rambo.

2353
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:21,720
Just Rambo things.

2354
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:26,340
I was like, you got the GM!

2355
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:32,140
Jesus Christ.

2356
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,580
Oh my god.

2357
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:35,980
There's so much damage.

2358
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:38,420
Okay, that's on you.

2359
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:43,200
Why the fuck were you- He's literally one.

2360
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:43,920
He's literally one.

2361
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:46,600
He's one too.

2362
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:48,860
Go!

2363
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:49,240
Go, Mike!

2364
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:49,860
Go!

2365
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:51,500
Beat the shit out of him!

2366
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:53,300
Oh my god, Mike!

2367
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:55,140
What the fuck happened over there?

2368
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:58,680
What kind of fight club did I miss out on?

2369
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:06,880
Bro, I missed out on some fight club shit on the other side.

2370
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:13,140
Nice.

2371
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:13,780
Nice.

2372
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:15,920
Yeah, he does.

2373
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,440
He heals during punches.

2374
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:22,540
But you have to out-damage his punch.

2375
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:27,700
Well, that'll be fine.

2376
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:30,600
Yeah, I didn't ult because I was like, they'll be okay.

2377
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:35,800
I- I relied very heavily on the, they'll be okay.

2378
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:41,820
I had to like, hope that they'll be okay.

2379
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:46,980
Oh my god, nice.

2380
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:49,540
Go!

2381
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:49,960
Go!

2382
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:50,480
Go!

2383
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:50,960
Run!

2384
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:51,280
Run!

2385
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:51,700
Run!

2386
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:52,320
Gas!

2387
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:52,580
Gas!

2388
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:53,060
Gas!

2389
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:58,540
Keep punching!

2390
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:00,940
Just keep punching!

2391
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:04,780
Alright.

2392
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:08,640
We're going to where?

2393
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:10,560
Oh!

2394
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:13,100
Oh, oh, where's that portal?

2395
02:30:14,140 --> 02:30:14,940
Where's that?

2396
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:17,140
Oh, that's where that portal is.

2397
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:19,560
Hey guys.

2398
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:22,640
Keep punching like your heart's desire!

2399
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:26,180
Punch so fuck- yeah, keep doing it!

2400
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:27,420
Keep punching!

2401
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:31,480
I just watched, bro.

2402
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:34,400
That fucking guy punched so fucking hard.

2403
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:34,860
Oh.

2404
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:38,480
Oh, goodbye.

2405
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,060
I guess this is where I die.

2406
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:40,800
I guess.

2407
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:41,620
I guess.

2408
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:43,480
Go, buddy!

2409
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:44,120
Go!

2410
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,300
Wait, we lost that fight?

2411
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:48,460
No way!

2412
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:52,320
We had so many picks!

2413
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:53,960
He punched so hard!

2414
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:58,280
How did we lose that fight?

2415
02:30:58,300 --> 02:30:59,720
All he did was punch!

2416
02:31:04,930 --> 02:31:05,950
I can't.

2417
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:07,990
I- I- I have to reload one day.

2418
02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:12,170
I- Oh my god!

2419
02:31:12,610 --> 02:31:19,110
I- Oh my- I don't know how- That's why I'm- I deserve to be GM.

2420
02:31:19,710 --> 02:31:22,390
This is exactly why I deserve it.

2421
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:23,810
Oh my god, keep going, Mikey!

2422
02:31:24,350 --> 02:31:25,370
Keep punching!

2423
02:31:29,350 --> 02:31:33,930
Oh my god, there you go.

2424
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:35,210
I am strengthened.

2425
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:38,510
No, no!

2426
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:48,740
Oh my god, we're always like just there.

2427
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:52,560
We get like 200 picks?

2428
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:55,220
Why can't we do anything with 200 picks?

2429
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:02,340
Mike punched so much, but nothing happened!

2430
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:09,240
All he did was punch!

2431
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:14,740
Okay, we got a pick though.

2432
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:19,320
I have to reload.

2433
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:20,260
Please, I can't.

2434
02:32:24,210 --> 02:32:30,920
Okay, I have all- Okay, I'm just gonna push up.

2435
02:32:35,230 --> 02:32:35,970
That's fine.

2436
02:32:40,310 --> 02:32:41,470
Let's go!

2437
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:44,090
Please!

2438
02:32:47,580 --> 02:32:49,040
Oh my god, please!

2439
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:49,320
Please!

2440
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:55,120
Are you alive?

2441
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:56,580
He is not alive.

2442
02:32:57,240 --> 02:33:00,060
He- he is absolutely not alive.

2443
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:05,100
Oh my god!

2444
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:10,520
Oh, you guys are all disgusting!

2445
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:15,140
Loki pissed me off!

2446
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:19,300
I'm just- I'm just a Yui!

2447
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:21,820
What am I supposed to do?

2448
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:27,420
It's okay.

2449
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:30,460
It's never that easy.

2450
02:33:36,370 --> 02:33:37,510
Goodbye, Mikey.

2451
02:33:38,110 --> 02:33:40,290
I can't wait to see you never.

2452
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:49,040
What's that?

2453
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:56,540
He's putting on a show!

2454
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:00,100
Oh my god.

2455
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:01,420
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

2456
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:05,480
Haha, he's- He's so dead.

2457
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:14,600
I think- I think this was a team death.

2458
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:17,340
I think- Possibly.

2459
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:23,240
I think it was- The team was just not there.

2460
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:31,160
It was so- we had a hawk one trick and we had Mike.

2461
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:34,560
We had- we had fucking Mike.

2462
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:39,280
Bro, he's a little mad.

2463
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:42,260
He's low-key pissed off, guys.

2464
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:43,500
Low-key.

2465
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,660
Okay, avoid him.

2466
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:47,880
And where's Mike?

2467
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:49,220
Sorry, Mike.

2468
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:50,240
You're gone.

2469
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:52,820
Goodbye, Mike.

2470
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:52,980
Mike...

2471
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:57,960
Mike tried his best.

2472
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:07,880
I just like how- I like how he was like, not gonna lie, low-key pissing me off.

2473
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:08,640
Low-key!

2474
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:16,060
What do you mean low-key pissed off?

2475
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:17,600
I'm just a little mad.

2476
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:20,460
Just a little bit.

2477
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:26,460
Oh shit, I'm gonna do what he did!

2478
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:29,240
Guys, ban Hulk.

2479
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:32,300
They have Hulk one trick.

2480
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:44,520
Yes, sir!

2481
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:49,780
Wait, was- was Ross the Hulk player?

2482
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:51,200
I don't even know.

2483
02:35:52,820 --> 02:35:55,600
I don't- The intel.

2484
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:56,580
I'm banning Hulk.

2485
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:57,540
Fuck it.

2486
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:59,200
I get the point.

2487
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:01,180
Was it Captain Ross?

2488
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:01,940
Yeah, it was.

2489
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:02,780
Yeah, okay.

2490
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:06,840
You're evil.

2491
02:36:13,060 --> 02:36:13,700
Dance.

2492
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:15,340
Nice.

2493
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:28,900
I'm getting back- I'm getting back my elo that I lost.

2494
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:30,900
He knows.

2495
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:35,500
He fucking knows.

2496
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:40,380
That should be a one trick!

2497
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,260
Hulk mad.

2498
02:36:48,580 --> 02:36:52,020
It's a lesson to not be a one trick!

2499
02:36:54,920 --> 02:37:00,220
I was like, Hulk sucks, why you ban him?

2500
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,480
He's hulking out.

2501
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:10,360
I'm not a one trick!

2502
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:12,140
I can play other supports!

2503
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:14,440
I just like playing Luna!

2504
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:22,420
If they ban- when they ban Luna, I play Mantis or- I play Mantis or Cloak.

2505
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:29,920
I do play other supports!

2506
02:37:30,700 --> 02:37:31,640
I did!

2507
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:37,320
Don't make him angry.

2508
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:41,760
I'm getting back the elo I lost from a Hulk one trick.

2509
02:37:42,120 --> 02:37:46,600
I say as even though we ban Hulk, he's gonna- he's gonna win.

2510
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:52,480
Knowing my luck, he's gonna win this game because I ban Hulk.

2511
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:03,000
Lowkey though, the fucking counter portal that one game we had was actually insane.

2512
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:09,320
I think I was like, one of the crazy shit.

2513
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:12,180
Wait.

2514
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,280
I'm trying to keep our-

2515
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:24,770
Okay.

2516
02:38:26,970 --> 02:38:27,930
Jesus Christ.

2517
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:29,810
Everyone's taking so much damage.

2518
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:38,170
It's fine.

2519
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:41,810
Oh, it's fine.

2520
02:38:43,170 --> 02:38:44,790
That's fine, we're fine.

2521
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:49,320
We're fine.

2522
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:52,200
Oh, they put him on support!

2523
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:56,080
They put Captain Rez on support!

2524
02:38:56,820 --> 02:38:59,540
Because he can't play any other thing!

2525
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:07,120
Oh my god, I just noticed that they put him on support, that's so funny.

2526
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:12,340
I don't want him to throw.

2527
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:14,560
That's so funny.

2528
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:16,540
I love that.

2529
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:17,800
I love that for him.

2530
02:39:22,830 --> 02:39:25,870
It's not evil, I'm just gaming the system.

2531
02:39:28,970 --> 02:39:31,250
I'm literally just gaming the system.

2532
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:36,330
I'm touching, I'm touching.

2533
02:39:37,170 --> 02:39:39,530
It's all about the system, guys!

2534
02:39:42,250 --> 02:39:43,450
Oh my god.

2535
02:39:44,230 --> 02:39:44,950
Again!

2536
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:49,830
Where's my again?

2537
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:56,080
Oh, that's fucking right!

2538
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:57,220
Get predicted!

2539
02:39:57,960 --> 02:39:59,640
Oh, you're gonna walk up to me?

2540
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:02,500
What will you possibly do?

2541
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:04,200
That's fucking right!

2542
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:05,340
I deserve GM!

2543
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:07,540
Oh no.

2544
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:08,700
Oh no.

2545
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:11,140
Oh no.

2546
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:12,760
Oh no.

2547
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:16,340
Oh no.

2548
02:40:17,780 --> 02:40:18,360
Oh no.

2549
02:40:19,580 --> 02:40:21,340
They got point back since when?

2550
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:22,660
Oh my god, I had to reload.

2551
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:23,260
I'm sorry.

2552
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:25,280
I literally had to reload.

2553
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:31,990
Oops, sorry.

2554
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:33,270
I didn't realize he was asleep.

2555
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:34,910
I can't see!

2556
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:37,690
I didn't realize he was asleep.

2557
02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:41,250
Wait, they lost the control again?

2558
02:40:42,130 --> 02:40:44,950
Oh, that was such a good hook.

2559
02:40:47,270 --> 02:40:48,590
That's actually such a good hook.

2560
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:57,270
Gather around!

2561
02:40:57,670 --> 02:40:58,690
Friendship time!

2562
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:03,770
Come on!

2563
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:07,470
Oh no!

2564
02:41:08,250 --> 02:41:10,010
We lost one!

2565
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:14,380
Nice!

2566
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:19,140
Nice!

2567
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:20,600
Captain America!

2568
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:25,380
Nice, we got it back!

2569
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:29,660
The power of friendship!

2570
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:36,480
Don't be a one trick!

2571
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:39,020
Or I'll do what I did to Ross.

2572
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:44,180
That's so fucking funny.

2573
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:46,760
Hook is bad, why would you even ban him?

2574
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:48,020
Says the Hulk one trick.

2575
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:58,500
This is a threat.

2576
02:41:58,940 --> 02:41:59,560
Curse of Ra!

2577
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:07,720
He was stunned.

2578
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:10,200
He was like, bro, we were on the same team!

2579
02:42:10,940 --> 02:42:13,760
Yeah, the same team where we fucking lost!

2580
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:17,260
That was my GM game, you fucker!

2581
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:25,660
He's gonna do the Curse of Ra on me.

2582
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:29,440
That's right, I learned.

2583
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:30,580
I learned.

2584
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:33,460
We cursed him.

2585
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:39,100
What we need to do is capture the mission area.

2586
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:39,860
Got it?

2587
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:43,600
Part of me just wants to get back home.

2588
02:42:43,860 --> 02:42:45,540
But I know I'm needed here.

2589
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,960
Oh, wait a little.

2590
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:50,560
Where are they?

2591
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:54,660
Right side, right side.

2592
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:57,080
Oh shit, that's where they are.

2593
02:42:58,340 --> 02:42:59,180
Oh shit.

2594
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:01,360
That's where they were.

2595
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:05,600
That's okay.

2596
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,900
Everybody is okay.

2597
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,080
It's okay.

2598
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:12,860
He's so healthy.

2599
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:19,640
You want to reload?

2600
02:43:19,820 --> 02:43:20,560
I'm so sorry.

2601
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:25,460
If I didn't have to reload...

2602
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:28,240
You could have lived with us!

2603
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:33,440
Alright, you're gonna have to back up a little bit.

2604
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:34,280
Oh no.

2605
02:43:35,620 --> 02:43:36,400
Here we go.

2606
02:43:36,400 --> 02:43:38,520
You know what to do with that!

2607
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:40,580
Okay, apparently not.

2608
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:44,720
Just stay there, stay there, stay there!

2609
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:46,240
Stay there!

2610
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:47,120
Stop!

2611
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:49,340
Nevermind.

2612
02:43:50,180 --> 02:43:51,120
We didn't stay there.

2613
02:43:51,800 --> 02:43:52,820
We didn't stay there.

2614
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:57,700
Alright, we gotta go back.

2615
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:06,300
It's okay.

2616
02:44:06,300 --> 02:44:08,200
Our Moon Knight is alive.

2617
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:13,220
I realized Moon Knight is basically just Marvel Reaper.

2618
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:15,920
He's so fucking edgy.

2619
02:44:19,660 --> 02:44:20,700
It's fine.

2620
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:21,640
It's okay.

2621
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:27,920
Oh, I can't see you.

2622
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,360
I can't see you.

2623
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:31,580
I hope you're getting them.

2624
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:34,100
I hope you killed them.

2625
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:35,120
He didn't kill them.

2626
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:36,820
He didn't kill them.

2627
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:39,440
I hoped but nothing happened.

2628
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:45,380
I feel like I hear them.

2629
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:47,760
I fucking knew it.

2630
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:48,700
I fucking knew it.

2631
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:51,480
I was like, I hear.

2632
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:54,740
I hear our deaths.

2633
02:44:55,460 --> 02:44:56,520
Oh my god.

2634
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,220
I was like, I'm ready to die here.

2635
02:45:06,730 --> 02:45:07,690
Team up?

2636
02:45:08,350 --> 02:45:09,990
Oh, my team up is gone.

2637
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:11,950
Why?

2638
02:45:12,210 --> 02:45:12,970
Oh, Psylocke.

2639
02:45:15,090 --> 02:45:16,250
Oh, Venom.

2640
02:45:17,710 --> 02:45:19,450
Venom and Psylocke.

2641
02:45:21,950 --> 02:45:23,790
Oh, double tank.

2642
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:27,030
I just realized we were solo tanking this entire time.

2643
02:45:31,410 --> 02:45:32,090
No!

2644
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:32,430
No!

2645
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:39,410
It's okay.

2646
02:45:39,530 --> 02:45:41,450
We have ult for next round, right?

2647
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:43,290
No.

2648
02:45:43,750 --> 02:45:44,890
No, I banned Hulk.

2649
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:46,350
I might lose this now.

2650
02:45:46,670 --> 02:45:47,790
Oh, no.

2651
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:50,190
Wait.

2652
02:45:50,510 --> 02:45:52,670
Ross is on DPS now?

2653
02:45:53,310 --> 02:45:55,430
It's because I put Ross on DPS.

2654
02:46:01,250 --> 02:46:01,730
Oh, my god.

2655
02:46:02,110 --> 02:46:03,150
Oh, no.

2656
02:46:03,150 --> 02:46:04,350
Oh, no.

2657
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:07,070
Oh, no.

2658
02:46:07,490 --> 02:46:12,950
Oh, no.

2659
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:20,860
They are no longer one drinking.

2660
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,040
Oh, no.

2661
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:26,760
Oh, no.

2662
02:46:27,620 --> 02:46:28,100
No.

2663
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:31,040
Maybe I should have banned Hulk.

2664
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:33,500
Yes, he's bald.

2665
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:34,680
No!

2666
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:39,260
You made that man adapt.

2667
02:46:41,620 --> 02:46:43,560
I can't believe it.

2668
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:47,080
I can't fucking believe it.

2669
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:48,680
He has the most deaths, though.

2670
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:50,460
So, I don't think he's actually adapting.

2671
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:54,980
He's actually getting carried by his team.

2672
02:46:55,480 --> 02:46:56,680
He's not adapting.

2673
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,600
What happened to the portal?

2674
02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:04,980
Now, we're going to be there late.

2675
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:08,560
They must have been like, where are they?

2676
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:12,120
Little do they know.

2677
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:13,900
Our portal didn't work.

2678
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:18,360
We fucked up the portal.

2679
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:19,240
Little do they know.

2680
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:21,020
That's bad, though.

2681
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,720
Because they have the advantage.

2682
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:33,040
Can you get that man to figure out if she wants to go left or right?

2683
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:37,240
I'm like, looking left and right because he's...

2684
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:37,520
What?

2685
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:38,620
That hits me?

2686
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:40,980
Okay,

2687
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:51,080
I shouldn't just stand here because I realize if I just stand there it's just easier to fucking kill me.

2688
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:59,940
Oh, thank God.

2689
02:48:00,460 --> 02:48:01,460
Oh, thank God.

2690
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:04,420
I was going to say, I just did like the sickest fucking move.

2691
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:10,900
I just did like one of the sickest fucking moves possible.

2692
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:14,580
Just to like, get trolled like that.

2693
02:48:14,660 --> 02:48:16,220
I would have been so fucking sad.

2694
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:19,220
Come on, God.

2695
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:20,100
Kill Captain America.

2696
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:21,280
He's so...

2697
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:22,820
No way!

2698
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,140
They got the heal off.

2699
02:48:29,410 --> 02:48:30,550
No way.

2700
02:48:30,910 --> 02:48:32,090
No way.

2701
02:48:32,190 --> 02:48:32,510
No fucking way.

2702
02:48:32,650 --> 02:48:34,370
No fucking way!

2703
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:37,070
Oh my God!

2704
02:48:37,150 --> 02:48:38,130
Why did we fuck?

2705
02:48:38,590 --> 02:48:39,010
No!

2706
02:48:42,190 --> 02:48:42,950
Guys...

2707
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:45,710
I banned Hulk but it was no...

2708
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:50,170
I got karma'd for banning Hulk, guys.

2709
02:48:51,490 --> 02:48:54,110
I actually got karma'd for it.

2710
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:55,290
Who would have thought?

2711
02:49:00,090 --> 02:49:01,390
We didn't kill!

2712
02:49:01,430 --> 02:49:02,090
Thank God.

2713
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:03,570
I was going to be so mad if we didn't kill her.

2714
02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:08,970
I was going to be like, there's no fucking way we didn't.

2715
02:49:11,970 --> 02:49:13,410
You're fucking welcome.

2716
02:49:21,370 --> 02:49:22,770
We have one fight.

2717
02:49:27,740 --> 02:49:28,380
Okay.

2718
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:30,120
Okay.

2719
02:49:30,220 --> 02:49:31,580
Okay, my ice aren't been on point though.

2720
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:32,720
Not gonna lie.

2721
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:37,660
Who's monkey?

2722
02:49:40,420 --> 02:49:42,160
Wait, we don't have point yet?

2723
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:48,180
Oh no!

2724
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:49,980
Okay, that's fine.

2725
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:51,240
I used damage boost.

2726
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:53,400
That's fine.

2727
02:49:55,560 --> 02:49:56,200
That...

2728
02:49:56,200 --> 02:49:58,040
That's fine.

2729
02:49:58,140 --> 02:49:59,100
We killed nothing.

2730
02:50:00,780 --> 02:50:01,900
That's fine.

2731
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:06,660
This is not good.

2732
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,440
This is not good.

2733
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:08,760
No way!

2734
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:23,620
There's no fucking...

2735
02:50:29,700 --> 02:50:31,140
Oh my God!

2736
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:33,080
The curse of...

2737
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:34,380
Rawr!

2738
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:35,440
Oh

2739
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:42,140
my God!

2740
02:50:42,220 --> 02:50:43,680
That's actually crazy!

2741
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:46,220
That's actually crazy!

2742
02:50:46,220 --> 02:50:49,300
How did I fumble?

2743
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:51,640
I did my job!

2744
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:54,580
I literally did my job!

2745
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:56,880
Someone didn't do their job!

2746
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:04,140
I did what my role was required to do.

2747
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:08,820
I got cursed so raw.

2748
02:51:09,440 --> 02:51:12,300
I can't believe I actually got cursed so raw.

2749
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:15,300
I should...

2750
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,780
Cloak and dagger would not have helped us.

2751
02:51:18,700 --> 02:51:20,680
We needed a double...

2752
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:22,800
We needed a defensive ult.

2753
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:25,120
Sweet karma.

2754
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:27,940
Sweet karma.

2755
02:51:28,940 --> 02:51:29,600
I knew it.

2756
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,060
I had that feeling.

2757
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:32,840
I was like, it's gonna happen.

2758
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:36,620
I'm gonna be so excited that I banned...

2759
02:51:38,680 --> 02:51:41,240
That I banned a one trick character.

2760
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:42,920
Because we lost because of it.

2761
02:51:42,980 --> 02:51:45,460
But it didn't even matter.

2762
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:47,820
It didn't even matter.

2763
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:49,420
Wait, why do I have...

2764
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:50,620
Oh, they have two diamond one plays.

2765
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:54,980
That's actually crazy.

2766
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:56,780
I can't believe that happened.

2767
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:09,000
I can't believe it.

2768
02:52:17,740 --> 02:52:22,080
I can't believe the captain lived for so fucking long.

2769
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:28,620
Like, nobody killed her.

2770
02:52:28,940 --> 02:52:29,520
Or him.

2771
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:31,340
Nobody killed him.

2772
02:52:31,460 --> 02:52:33,040
What's wrong with people?

2773
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:34,880
I'm not banning.

2774
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:37,180
I don't care enough to ban.

2775
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:41,660
The last time I banned...

2776
02:52:41,660 --> 02:52:43,040
I strategically banned.

2777
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:44,320
I lost.

2778
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:46,900
I fucking...

2779
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:49,360
That's the last time.

2780
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:52,460
The last time I do it.

2781
02:52:55,270 --> 02:52:56,730
That was karma.

2782
02:52:59,790 --> 02:53:01,050
Actual karma.

2783
02:53:01,870 --> 02:53:04,450
And thus, I will never do it again.

2784
02:53:05,530 --> 02:53:06,390
Never.

2785
02:53:20,990 --> 02:53:22,710
One game.

2786
02:53:23,010 --> 02:53:25,920
I think that was...

2787
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:26,440
Yeah.

2788
02:53:29,060 --> 02:53:30,720
That was so close.

2789
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,700
It was one game.

2790
02:53:43,740 --> 02:53:45,700
Stop kicking their chair, karma.

2791
02:53:46,280 --> 02:53:49,220
That was the most fucking ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

2792
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:50,400
In terms of parenting.

2793
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:52,100
Just say it's bad.

2794
02:53:52,680 --> 02:53:55,200
You don't have to be like, karma's gonna get you.

2795
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:58,860
If you kick this lady's chair, you're gonna fucking die.

2796
02:54:01,960 --> 02:54:04,180
Just be like, it's rude.

2797
02:54:05,580 --> 02:54:07,180
You don't have to tell her about karma.

2798
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:11,040
Bro, that kid's too young to learn about fucking karma.

2799
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:13,120
Stop them from securing the mission area.

2800
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:14,320
Portal.

2801
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:15,500
They're doing a portal.

2802
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,360
What the hell does that mean?

2803
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:21,160
Like,

2804
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:28,680
I knew they were doing a portal, but it still scared me.

2805
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:31,860
I was just like...

2806
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:35,540
I didn't think it would be like that way, you know?

2807
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:41,240
I was like, oh, portal.

2808
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:43,260
And then it was like, on the...

2809
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:44,300
That was such a...

2810
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:46,580
Not weird, but like...

2811
02:54:46,580 --> 02:54:48,920
You gotta figure out where exactly they're gonna portal.

2812
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:57,600
Yeah, I like...

2813
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:02,760
That's fine, you're fine.

2814
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:09,710
Sorry, Mantis.

2815
02:55:10,190 --> 02:55:11,370
If you die, you die.

2816
02:55:15,970 --> 02:55:16,990
Sorry, Mantis.

2817
02:55:17,130 --> 02:55:19,050
I had to pick.

2818
02:55:21,410 --> 02:55:22,330
I had to pick.

2819
02:55:22,870 --> 02:55:24,450
I'm sorry, Mantis.

2820
02:55:28,410 --> 02:55:29,370
Oh my god.

2821
02:55:29,410 --> 02:55:30,630
They were everywhere.

2822
02:55:34,170 --> 02:55:36,170
Mantis, you should have played with us.

2823
02:55:36,230 --> 02:55:37,810
Why didn't you 1v1 him?

2824
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:44,940
You did not have to 1v1 him.

2825
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:49,060
Oh my god.

2826
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:52,800
Oh, thank god.

2827
02:55:54,780 --> 02:55:56,680
I don't know why you 1v1 him.

2828
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:59,520
Why did you 1v1 him?

2829
02:55:59,780 --> 02:56:00,060
Why?

2830
02:56:00,240 --> 02:56:03,900
If you 1v1 him, if you didn't 1v1 him, I would have been alive.

2831
02:56:04,360 --> 02:56:06,200
I would have been so fucking alive.

2832
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:09,980
Oh, no.

2833
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:11,660
No.

2834
02:56:12,460 --> 02:56:14,700
We double support Alston.

2835
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:15,820
No.

2836
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:20,720
We have two good reflexes.

2837
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:24,440
Our reflexes are too good.

2838
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:26,100
No.

2839
02:56:26,620 --> 02:56:27,700
We would not have lived through that.

2840
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:31,120
Even with two support ults, we would not have lived through that.

2841
02:56:33,400 --> 02:56:34,480
There was no way.

2842
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:36,920
I don't think there was no living.

2843
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:42,560
I don't even know how we can live through that.

2844
02:56:43,720 --> 02:56:46,640
Like, what kind of ult would let us live through that?

2845
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:58,300
Like, there was no ult that could have saved us from that hellhole.

2846
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:02,400
There was no ult.

2847
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:04,460
Oh, no.

2848
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:07,740
No, I'm alive?

2849
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:13,620
I'm not alive.

2850
02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:23,480
Guys, I think it was the curse of Ross.

2851
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:26,600
I think it was the curse of Ross.

2852
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:32,440
Guys, I got curse of Ross, guys.

2853
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:37,920
I got curse of Ross.

2854
02:57:40,100 --> 02:57:42,440
All because of that one guy.

2855
02:57:44,900 --> 02:57:47,020
All because of him.

2856
02:57:50,530 --> 02:57:52,110
It was his fault.

2857
02:57:55,010 --> 02:57:56,070
Don't do not.

2858
02:57:56,250 --> 02:57:56,890
Okay, thank God.

2859
02:57:58,450 --> 02:57:59,310
Oh, thank God.

2860
02:58:00,290 --> 02:58:01,490
Oh, thank God.

2861
02:58:01,810 --> 02:58:02,350
He didn't.

2862
02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:03,870
Oh, it's because he didn't have the support.

2863
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:06,570
Um, there's guys.

2864
02:58:13,250 --> 02:58:15,030
Oh, thank God I'm alive.

2865
02:58:15,770 --> 02:58:18,090
Oh, thank God I'm alive.

2866
02:58:21,900 --> 02:58:23,020
Oh, thank God.

2867
02:58:24,020 --> 02:58:27,260
Okay, thank God Mattison, Avholt, and I had ult there.

2868
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:34,500
So we could do that.

2869
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:39,840
Alright.

2870
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:41,540
That's fine.

2871
02:58:43,100 --> 02:58:44,480
Oh, no!

2872
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:45,380
No!

2873
02:58:46,860 --> 02:58:47,880
Not the moon!

2874
02:58:53,780 --> 02:58:55,490
Not the moon!

2875
02:58:57,580 --> 02:58:59,380
Not the moon!

2876
02:59:02,440 --> 02:59:06,140
Bro, that ult combo was actually crazy.

2877
02:59:07,260 --> 02:59:09,040
The fucking moon.

2878
02:59:11,620 --> 02:59:15,700
Like, I don't think there's any way to counter it.

2879
02:59:17,420 --> 02:59:19,000
I'm on it.

2880
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:21,600
Goodbye.

2881
02:59:23,740 --> 02:59:24,620
Goodbye.

2882
02:59:35,780 --> 02:59:37,100
Don't stack.

2883
02:59:37,380 --> 02:59:39,580
Wow, that sounds so easy.

2884
02:59:43,340 --> 02:59:47,520
It kills every support ult other than revive.

2885
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:53,460
Oh, the cloaking dagger?

2886
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:56,120
Nope, because the moon ult lasts too long.

2887
02:59:59,080 --> 03:00:00,860
We need to call it better.

2888
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:03,320
Luna

2889
03:00:08,060 --> 03:00:11,040
doesn't outheal that.

2890
03:00:16,580 --> 03:00:22,360
We just Luna does not outheal that.

2891
03:00:22,460 --> 03:00:25,520
I'm fucking I have too much experience.

2892
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:30,560
Yeah, there's nothing you can do.

2893
03:00:39,240 --> 03:00:44,000
Yeah, we just die.

2894
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:48,960
Nothing outheals it.

2895
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:56,360
The battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

2896
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:00,920
Don't forget, securing the mission area is your top priority.

2897
03:01:01,400 --> 03:01:04,780
I can't rez it because like we need these heals.

2898
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:10,180
We're taking so much damage and Adam's fucking heals do not sustain us.

2899
03:01:10,760 --> 03:01:17,050
I just, I've accepted it.

2900
03:01:20,570 --> 03:01:23,050
I've just accepted it.

2901
03:01:24,430 --> 03:01:26,290
I just

2902
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:33,590
Please Please Kill him!

2903
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:35,290
Kill him!

2904
03:01:38,010 --> 03:01:38,510
Kill him!

2905
03:01:41,110 --> 03:01:42,310
Kill him!

2906
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:49,900
Is that Moon Knight?

2907
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,420
They have Moon Knight.

2908
03:01:51,420 --> 03:01:52,500
There we go.

2909
03:01:52,740 --> 03:01:53,340
Yeah, that's fucking right.

2910
03:01:53,400 --> 03:01:54,300
Why are you running, bitch?

2911
03:01:57,100 --> 03:01:58,360
That's fucking right.

2912
03:01:59,400 --> 03:02:02,480
Oh shit, I got a little too overconfident there.

2913
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:05,940
Oh my god, what are you doing?

2914
03:02:11,450 --> 03:02:13,150
Oh my god!

2915
03:02:17,770 --> 03:02:20,110
Oh my god, I can't reach him!

2916
03:02:21,350 --> 03:02:22,770
He's too far up!

2917
03:02:26,650 --> 03:02:27,090
Oh, it's fine.

2918
03:02:27,670 --> 03:02:29,070
It's not fine.

2919
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:34,050
Oh, it's definitely- Oh!

2920
03:02:35,630 --> 03:02:37,950
I thought the Mantis was gonna ult.

2921
03:02:43,840 --> 03:02:44,600
Alright.

2922
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:45,960
It's fine.

2923
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:47,820
We're so fine.

2924
03:02:51,100 --> 03:02:52,480
What's that sound?

2925
03:02:52,920 --> 03:03:00,040
It's like- Guys, I just need I just need three games.

2926
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:02,200
Three games and I'll be Grandmaster, guys.

2927
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:05,420
Just three easy games, guys.

2928
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:08,100
Three such easy games.

2929
03:03:08,540 --> 03:03:12,800
Just three very easy games, guys.

2930
03:03:15,440 --> 03:03:16,000
Oh!

2931
03:03:16,690 --> 03:03:17,520
That's awkward.

2932
03:03:21,100 --> 03:03:22,040
No!

2933
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:22,240
No!

2934
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:33,940
That's so awkward.

2935
03:03:37,060 --> 03:03:38,120
She was frozen!

2936
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:43,920
How was I supposed to- This Mantis and I, we're not on the same wavelength.

2937
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:49,280
We're not- We have no chemistry, this Mantis and I.

2938
03:03:49,820 --> 03:03:50,840
It's not you.

2939
03:03:51,320 --> 03:03:52,240
No, it is you.

2940
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:55,100
I'm playing the game of my life right now.

2941
03:03:56,140 --> 03:03:57,680
It is you.

2942
03:03:58,520 --> 03:04:01,200
You've died eight times, Mantis.

2943
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:06,320
It's not me.

2944
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:10,840
I'm not the problem here.

2945
03:04:19,930 --> 03:04:22,210
I'm literally playing so well.

2946
03:04:22,810 --> 03:04:23,650
It can't be me.

2947
03:04:29,790 --> 03:04:35,070
We just have zero chemistry and it's just- It's just- It just be like that.

2948
03:04:37,550 --> 03:04:39,910
It just be like that.

2949
03:04:39,990 --> 03:04:42,250
We just, you know...

2950
03:04:43,830 --> 03:04:47,230
I literally have less deaths than you, so it can't be a me issue.

2951
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:01,420
I can feel the moon.

2952
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:04,080
I can feel the moon, guys.

2953
03:05:04,720 --> 03:05:07,180
I feel the moon coming in any moment.

2954
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:09,720
The moon!

2955
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:11,540
I feel it.

2956
03:05:13,780 --> 03:05:14,800
The moon!

2957
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:17,020
I

2958
03:05:24,630 --> 03:05:25,930
felt the moon.

2959
03:05:26,370 --> 03:05:29,130
The moon looked back at me.

2960
03:05:35,800 --> 03:05:36,980
Oh my god.

2961
03:05:38,380 --> 03:05:39,780
Oh my god.

2962
03:05:40,400 --> 03:05:40,920
The moon!

2963
03:05:42,380 --> 03:05:43,020
The moon!

2964
03:05:47,560 --> 03:05:48,960
We're alive!

2965
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:52,020
We are alive!

2966
03:05:52,120 --> 03:05:52,780
Surefour!

2967
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:57,560
We're actually alive!

2968
03:06:01,660 --> 03:06:04,200
Holy shit, it's fucking going a miracle round right now.

2969
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:08,320
Jesus Christ!

2970
03:06:16,480 --> 03:06:18,820
The moon is hitting really hard right now.

2971
03:06:24,550 --> 03:06:26,070
I think we're dead.

2972
03:06:30,870 --> 03:06:31,970
Venom, please!

2973
03:06:33,410 --> 03:06:35,010
I can't jump that high!

2974
03:06:36,890 --> 03:06:38,290
Oh shit, let's go!

2975
03:06:38,390 --> 03:06:38,930
Let's fucking go!

2976
03:06:39,310 --> 03:06:40,390
Get that thing!

2977
03:06:40,390 --> 03:06:42,030
Let's fucking go!

2978
03:06:43,770 --> 03:06:45,230
Oh no, the moon.

2979
03:06:45,650 --> 03:06:47,710
The moon's here.

2980
03:06:50,370 --> 03:06:51,410
The moon.

2981
03:06:54,410 --> 03:06:55,250
Kill him!

2982
03:06:55,430 --> 03:06:56,850
Kill him before the moon hits!

2983
03:06:57,430 --> 03:06:58,830
Kill him before it hits!

2984
03:07:00,470 --> 03:07:01,110
Please!

2985
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:17,080
Bro, not the moon!

2986
03:07:22,590 --> 03:07:23,290
No!

2987
03:07:29,380 --> 03:07:31,200
I hate the moon!

2988
03:07:39,480 --> 03:07:43,340
The fucking moon!

2989
03:07:44,460 --> 03:07:46,160
Stupid moon!

2990
03:07:50,480 --> 03:07:52,660
I hate the moon.

2991
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:01,200
I hate the moon.

2992
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:02,660
I wanna blow up the moon.

2993
03:08:02,820 --> 03:08:04,880
I wanna blow it up.

2994
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:08,880
The fucking moon!

2995
03:08:09,720 --> 03:08:11,420
That was so rough!

2996
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:13,620
The fucking moon!

2997
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:15,840
GG's.

2998
03:08:16,240 --> 03:08:17,660
GG's game.

2999
03:08:20,080 --> 03:08:22,360
Is he out of top 500?

3000
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:27,560
GG's.

3001
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:30,640
That's where I call it too.

3002
03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:35,220
We're gonna steal the fucking moon.

3003
03:08:38,880 --> 03:08:41,680
We're gonna recreate Despicable Me.

3004
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:44,460
That's crazy.

3005
03:08:49,040 --> 03:08:50,820
Oh my god.

3006
03:08:51,800 --> 03:08:52,780
That was great though.

3007
03:08:52,820 --> 03:08:54,520
That was a fun game.

3008
03:08:56,100 --> 03:09:04,420
I like checked SharePoint's chat and someone was like Throws Jokey's game Go to bed, Giga Chad.

3009
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:12,660
That's a good quote.

3010
03:09:12,860 --> 03:09:14,200
That's a good quote.

3011
03:09:14,520 --> 03:09:18,840
I will admit that's actually a really good quote right there.

3012
03:09:19,360 --> 03:09:20,020
Bro!

3013
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:27,760
What a fucking chat.

3014
03:09:29,360 --> 03:09:34,800
This is basically the quote of the day right here.

3015
03:09:36,340 --> 03:09:37,460
The moon!

3016
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:40,860
The fucking moon!

3017
03:09:52,940 --> 03:09:55,540
The stupid fucking moon.

3018
03:09:56,620 --> 03:09:57,560
Oh my god.

3019
03:09:57,660 --> 03:09:58,560
That was fun though.

3020
03:09:58,660 --> 03:10:00,620
Guys, this is how I celebrate.

3021
03:10:01,060 --> 03:10:01,720
Okay, guys?

3022
03:10:02,940 --> 03:10:06,320
You're celebrating by playing Yes, that's exactly it.

3023
03:10:06,380 --> 03:10:08,740
We celebrate by playing Marble Rivals.

3024
03:10:11,820 --> 03:10:13,100
Oh my god.

3025
03:10:13,220 --> 03:10:14,200
That was fun though.

3026
03:10:14,800 --> 03:10:20,640
Anyway, I want to say congratulations again, Dragoons, for winning Best Fanbase of the Year.

3027
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:28,680
I don't know if we could keep the title for Best Fanbase because by keeping the title, that means more fucked up shit is supposed to happen.

3028
03:10:30,740 --> 03:10:32,680
That's what I worry about.

3029
03:10:33,220 --> 03:10:36,220
I was like, what's gonna happen to me next year?

3030
03:10:36,520 --> 03:10:38,480
What's gonna happen to me?

3031
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:40,720
Doki, no!

3032
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:48,840
No, we're fine.

3033
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:50,780
Please don't say that.

3034
03:10:55,500 --> 03:10:58,620
What's the damage for next year?

3035
03:10:58,740 --> 03:10:59,720
We win again.

3036
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:04,540
What kind of character development am I gonna go through this time?

3037
03:11:09,340 --> 03:11:10,660
That was fun.

3038
03:11:10,760 --> 03:11:11,820
Congratulations again.

3039
03:11:12,380 --> 03:11:14,480
Huge support with everything.

3040
03:11:14,620 --> 03:11:15,360
The concert.

3041
03:11:17,160 --> 03:11:19,020
Watching me play Marble Rivals.

3042
03:11:21,240 --> 03:11:23,200
I don't have a problem.

3043
03:11:23,640 --> 03:11:25,940
I'm playing more Marble Rivals after this stream.

3044
03:11:26,380 --> 03:11:28,620
I'm gonna see if I can get Grandmaster tonight.

3045
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:29,580
Anyway, guys.

3046
03:11:29,940 --> 03:11:30,640
Thank you, guys.

3047
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:32,200
I hope you guys have a great time.

3048
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:41,340
I'm gonna rest now as I'm gonna play Marble Rivals and then tomorrow we have a sponsored stream and then we're chilling after that.

3049
03:11:43,040 --> 03:11:50,800
I don't know when I'll be back fully for now because I need to relax after such a long, long time of working.

3050
03:11:51,760 --> 03:11:52,980
Maybe I'll be back next week.

3051
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:54,320
We'll see how the schedule goes.

3052
03:11:54,540 --> 03:11:55,240
As always, everybody.

3053
03:11:55,420 --> 03:11:56,100
Stay hydrated.

3054
03:11:56,340 --> 03:11:58,360
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3055
03:11:58,480 --> 03:11:59,200
And you stay up for me?

3056
03:11:59,480 --> 03:12:01,140
Head to bed because you deserve it.

3057
03:12:01,240 --> 03:12:02,380
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3058
03:12:02,580 --> 03:12:03,260
Bye, guys.

3059
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:04,040
Bye.

3060
03:12:05,340 --> 03:12:06,440
Oh, yeah.

3061
03:12:06,500 --> 03:12:07,380
Check out my Nendoroid.

3062
03:12:07,500 --> 03:12:08,300
Nendoroid, Nendoroid.

3063
03:12:08,400 --> 03:12:09,620
Buy it, buy it, buy it.

3064
03:12:09,840 --> 03:12:10,420
I'll see you guys.

3065
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:10,780
Bye.
