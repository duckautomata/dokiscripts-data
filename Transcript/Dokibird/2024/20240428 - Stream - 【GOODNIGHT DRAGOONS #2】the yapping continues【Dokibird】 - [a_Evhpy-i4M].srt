get to like not worry about the stuff that made the day

17
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:49,020
rough you know it's a little i guess it's a little like a
pause on like the real world shit going outside it's like

18
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:58,480
you know uh You know, like, oh, if I stream right now, I
don't have, and I keep streaming, I don't have to worry

19
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,620
about what's going on until I stop my stream, and then it's
back to having a rough time.

20
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,720
It's like a symbiotic escapism.

21
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,820

Thank you, thank you.

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,920
Um, yeah, it was just a, it's just a really rough day today.

41
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,740
Um, just a lot of stuff going on, uh, behind the scenes and
stuff.

42
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,520
I think, okay, um, I had like, uh, I think like one of the
reasons why it was like super rough was because like okay

43
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,420
this is a little personal it's a little personal um but like
I did have like a little argument okay maybe it wasn't that

44
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:15,640
little maybe it wasn't that little but I had an argument um
with my parents about some things um so that's why it was

45
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:24,740
like super rough and um it's a little bit better now um but
yeah that's why i was like oh i can't wait to just stream

46
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:37,580
stream because then i can like escape from it and just spend
time with my dragoons it's never fun whenever you argue with

47
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:44,060
your parents it's never a fun time because you're just like
no and you're like yeah and they're like

48
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,800
And I'm like, I'm going to my room.

49
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,230
And then, you know, like, you go to your room and you're
like, and then you refuse to go out your room because when

50
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,210
you go out your room, they win.

51
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,550
You know, you know, when you have those types of arguments
and then you're like, oh, I want to.

52
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:27,150
I didn't I have not went out of my room yet, but then
eventually you have to eventually go out of your room and

53
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:40,190
then you and your parents pretend nothing happened You know,
and then when you finally and then oh yeah, you have to come

54
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:47,450
out to either eat or use the bathroom And then when you
finally do come out of your room you pretend nothing

55
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:59,030
happened never had that argument in the first place and it's
like the awkward silence and then they'll be like what do

56
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:11,910
you want to eat and then you're just like i don't care and
then and then the next day everything will just be fine um

57
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,250
you know think of the super chat thank you thank you i'll
have a better day tomorrow thank you thank you thank you

super chat thank you thank you yeah the social research just

61
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:42,970
just parents things that's why that's why you should never
have kids unless your kids subscribe to me

62
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:55,850
anyway that's why you should never have kids unless those
kids will become dokey bird subscribers then that's fine um

63
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:02,410
but other than that because then you know when you have kids
that's gonna happen to you too where you're gonna have those

64
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:10,390
exact same arguments and then you'll realize oh my god my
parents were right i was a piece of shit but for now i want

65
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:24,130
to think that i'm right for now i want to think that i'm
right and the knowledge of what it's like to be a parent to

89

If you have a child and they are becoming an iPad kid,
please make them subscribe to dokeybird You might as well

90
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:11,910
like dirty dirty fucked mentally because they're becoming
iPad kids if you guys don't know like Okay, no matter what

91
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:19,650
my content will always be better than cocoa melon because
apparently I've talked about this before but Coco Melon and

92
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:28,070
like a lot of like kids channels are known to actually harm
your child's brain development so no matter what I cannot be

93
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:40,110
worse than that at best they will learn some profanity but
they were going to learn it eventually so you might as well

94
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,130
start them off young like you don't want them to suddenly
learn it from their friends because like if their friend can

95
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,770
send means their friends are bad influences but if they
learn from me at least you know it's not because of a bad

96
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:09,230
influence it's because it's just so natural in my vocabulary
that it's just part of how I speak because like you don't

97
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:16,910
want your child to learn fuck from their friends because
like what would the context be but then you know if your

98
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:29,450
child learns fucking fucking from me it's just part of an
expression it just means like a lot of something so it's not

99
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:38,090
part of whatever context whatever bad influence that their
friends are doing to your child you know for me i'm a good

100
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:44,690
influence because even though i'm stupid um even though I'm
stupid.

101
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,270
I'm not influencing.

102
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,990
I'm not like...

103
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,510
I'm not fucking with your child's development.

104
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,230
10 minutes past.

105
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,730
I should be okay, I think.

106
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,930
He did the swears.

107
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,130

you.

118
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,110
Yeah, as a parent, I'm thankful that the realization that
used to be a rude dumb fuck happened before I had a kid.

119
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,370
Now I'm mostly a nice dumb fuck.

120
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,190
Thank you for the super chat.

121
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,830
Thank you.

122
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,770
Thank you.

123
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:40,650
Look, all I'm saying is that if you have children, please
make sure to have them subscribe to Doki Bird so I can get a

124
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:46,010
million subscribers before I don't I honestly at this I
don't think I'm gonna get millions of subscribers before the

125
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,720
end of the year unless I hit the algorithm hard I I don't
think it's possible

126
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:03,030
But I'm looking at like I actually calculated the cuz like
okay The reason why you guys must be like wow dokey Why are

127
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,770
you calculating when you're gonna hit a million subscribers?

128
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:14,270
It's cuz like at a million I want to make a huge I'm
planning a huge project for a million but the thing is I

129
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:23,350
need to know when I hit a million so I can debut this so I
can pinpoint the timing of the project for a million

130
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:33,010
subscribers I haven't started the plans for a million but I
need to know when will I hit it so I can calculate how many

131
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:44,610
months of planning I need to do for a project for a million
subscribers like so so that's why like I'm trying to I need

132
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:52,810
to know exactly because it's like oh my gosh if I like you
know if I like plan it advance like way to advance and I

133
00:13:52,810 --> 00:14:02,030
have it done by before I hit a million but then like so many
things happen afterwards and I hold on to this project on

134
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,390
standby for like I don't know half a year after it's
completed, then it'll be outdated.

135
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,790
I don't want something to be outdated.

136
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,510
So, like, that's why I'm trying to, like, I always, like,
try to figure out when I hit.

137
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,670
It's also, like, subscriber milestones, too.

138
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:23,090
I'm trying to, like, figure out, I think, like, at 800K
subscribers, there's something I want to do.

139
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,910
I hate 800K subscribers.

140
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:32,350
But, like, I also, I'm also worried that it would take too
long.

141
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:42,650
I'm a little worried that it's gonna take a little bit too
long And now I'm like, oh, it's gonna be so outdated But

142
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:50,990
it's gonna Like I would be like so impatient Because I would
rather just debut the project That I had planned for 800k

143
00:14:50,990 --> 00:15:01,650
earlier Then just waiting for 800k Um, it's just like wait
I'm just like impatient too I'm very impatient on things

144
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,830
Case in point, like, uh, there's, like, things I, um,
there's, like, things I want, I told you guys, there's

145
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:16,630
things I watch, and there's things, like, that I, like,
like, maybe I don't play a particular game or something, but

146
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,110
I, like, want to know the ending of something.

147
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,170
Oh, yeah, if I play a game, this is very, very rare.

148
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,750
Okay, not JK, I lie.

149
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,210
There's not the stream ones, not the stream games.

150
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:35,110
Okay, guys, I need you guys to know this, but there's a game
I haven't really played, or, Or I haven't really played or

151
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,130
like I'm not looking interested in playing.

152
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,410
But I want to know like the plot or story of the game.

153
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,270
I will actually look up the ending.

154
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,110
Because like I know I won't play it.

155
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,290
Like I know I won't play the game.

156
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,870
So like I'd be like oh I want to know like how the look.

157
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,410
It's like JRPGs.

158
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,830
I know I won't play JRPG games.

159
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:11,270
that like I'm curious about like I'll be like oh um what's
gonna happen like what's what's the story and stuff like

160
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:19,450
that so I just like look it up and I'll be like oh okay but
like JRPGs is such a terrible example for me because it's so

161
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:28,710
fucking long that you get sucked into a rabbit hole I think
that I only done that for like one JRPG and it was for uh no

162
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:37,650
two it was the one with the character and the other one was
like one of the personas because like i remember like i quit

163
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:46,110
playing the lightning one because it was terrible uh like
there's nothing else i can really say other than you know it

164
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:59,590
was pretty bad like i played up until um i played up until
like i think like I played like one to two hours and then I

165
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:07,890
was like okay yeah like I that this is not for me because
like I remember telling you guys like oh these were the

166
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,570
JRPGs I played like final like because you guys were like
have you ever played Final Fantasy and I was like yes

167
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:20,310
there's only been two Final Fantasy that I've played and
touched and like apparently both Final Fantasy games I've

168
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:27,850
tried to play were one of the worst installments in Final
Fantasy but they were literally the two I would be like,

169
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,470
let's give Final Fantasy a shot.

170
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,190
And then one of them was the one with the three girls.

171
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,430
I don't remember their names.

172
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,330
The one of the three girls that were the main characters.

173
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:43,930
And apparently that was supposed to be a sequel to the game
before, to the last Final Fantasy game.

174
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,090
But I played that.

175
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,310
Yeah, X2.

176
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,230
That was my very first Final Fantasy game.

177
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,110
And then I tried to play it.

178
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,710
And I was like, I don't know what the fuck is going on.

179
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,470
Because it's a sequel.

180
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,170
But I didn't realize it was a sequel.

181
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,490
I had, I was very young as well.

182
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,850
So I really had like no clue it was a sequel.

183
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,690
But I was like, I remember like going to like EB games.

184
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,150
And then like, for those who don't know what EB games, it's
like EA games.

185
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,910
But like B for Canadian.

186
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,650
Anyway, anyway.

187
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:32,430
I, and then I saw that I was like, I was like, Dad, I want
to buy this because Final Fantasy, it's everywhere.

188
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:40,890
And then, uh, and then, and then, you know, I tried it,
didn't know what the fuck is going on.

189
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:48,230
I think it's also because when I was young, when I was
younger, I was mega illiterate versus now, which is like

190
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,970
illiteracy by choice.

191
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,130
Back then, it was because I was just really stupid.

192
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:08,430
sort of illiterate and I like didn't really know how to read
but now it's by choice that I don't read and anyway um

193
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:19,870
anyway um and then a couple of years passed by like a
hundred years passed by oh my god Doki how old are you a

194
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,870
hundred years past it felt like a hundred years and then the

195
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:33,310
That's the lightning game came out and I was like, let me
give it another shot.

196
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:41,710
Maybe like, you know, I, I would, it would, maybe it was
just the game and it wasn't me, you know, maybe like, you

197
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,750
know, little, or like little dokey just back then little
dokey just wasn't into JRPGs.

198
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:56,570
And now slightly older dokey will be okay with it because
I'm more mature and like possibly I could read a little

199
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:56,910
better.

200
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:05,330
um and possibly the more mature you are and by the way tick
tock hasn't been invented yet nor has vine been invented yet

201
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:18,250
so like my attention span is still decent uh so so like i
haven't got like fucked over by like the lack of an

202
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:26,230
attention span because none of the short form content
existed yet it was like long form content meta still so like

203
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,790
it was still let's play meta where people will watch like
like one hour let's play videos because the 10 minute shit

204
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:44,770
hasn't hit yet um anyway uh so i was like all right the file
that fantasy 13 came out so i was like all right let's oh my

205
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:53,370
god lightning oh i saw an advertisement on about her where
she like modeled some louis vuitton haunt bags and she was

206
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,310
like a model and everything oh my god it can't be that bad

207
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:17,790
anyway so i tried i tried file fantasy 13 and i was and then
obviously we all know the reputation of file fantasy 13.

208
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:30,470
but at that time i was like maybe it's just me you know
maybe I was like I didn't know it was considered bad bad

209
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,990
because like also at that time I didn't really look at
reviews I was just like it was just like experience wise so

210
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:47,430
I stopped after I think like after like two like one to two
hours I stopped and I was like oh man Final Fantasy just

211
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:58,450
sucks for me I just I just I just I was like, oh man, Final
Fantasy, maybe it just sucks.

212
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:11,550
And then after that, I never touched, I think like after
that, I never like touched JRPGs again.

213
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,970
Oh no, that's a lie.

214
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,010
I try to play Persona as well.

215
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,890
And then I realized, I think like after I played Persona and
I try to play the Persona, the one that came out.

216
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,330
On the PlayStation

217
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:38,330
And then After Okay but like what are the odds That would
play two of the One two of the worst Like games In the

218
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,630
franchise Like what were the fucking odds That that would be
me

219
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:59,150
It's like Similar It's like similar to how I told you guys
for some fucking reason I was I managed to watch Two Cirque

220
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:10,310
I've only been to two Cirque de Soleil shows and for some
fucking reason I managed to to watch the same show Twice

221
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:21,430
from Cirque de Soleil How there was a 15 plus year gap
between two both of those shows But it happened to be the

222
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:35,990
same show I couldn't believe it but those who didn't hear
this story I told this story on the stream I think with with

223
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:45,430
with Gumi and what happened was that when I was really young
I went to see a Cirque du Soleil show and it was this show I

224
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:54,310
remember it very well because I bought the soundtrack of it
I bought the soundtrack of the show and so I was like oh

225
00:23:54,310 --> 00:24:02,950
shit hell yeah I fucking listened to that on my fucking
iPhone very regularly it was in my iTunes and my iPhone so I

226
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:12,110
like remember the song so well because it was like 15 plus
years of listening to that song to those songs when they

227
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:22,750
play on shuffle and then like 15 plus years later I realized
oh my god maybe like not even 15 i could i swear it could be

228
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:30,450
longer it could be 20 years honestly i will not be oh my
gosh i don't even know how long and i need you guys to know

229
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:37,090
how many shows cirque du soleil has okay cirque i'm gonna
look it up right now cirque du soleil that shit pissed me

230
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:45,150
off so much i i couldn't believe it because like we i bought
vip like i bought like front row seats for the second one

231
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,490
just to re-wash the same thing.

232
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,490

Thank you for some fucking reason.

235
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,810
You happen to be the best VTuber in the world, and I can't
fucking believe it, so keep doing what you do forever.

236
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,230
Thank you for the Akasupa.

237
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,790
Thank you, thank you.

238
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,710
I really appreciate that you think that way of me.

239
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,310
Alright, no, I need to look.

240
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,310
I need to tell you guys, because I looked it up.

241
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,930
I couldn't believe it.

242
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:20,990
I actually looked this up because I was like, I I couldn't
fucking believe that I managed to re-watch this fucking

243
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,810
show.

244
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:29,070
Like, I couldn't fucking believe it.

245
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,630
I, like, counted, too.

246
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,270
I was like, how many shows have they done?

247
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,930
And they've done, like, I remember counting it.

248
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,730
I, like, looked up on the Wikipedia and literally counted
how many shows they've done.

249
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,490
They've done.

250
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:50,830
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
11, 12, 30, 40, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,

251
00:25:51,250 --> 00:26:05,630
26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 44, 45, 36, 37, 38, 49, 40, 41,
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 48, they've done 53 different shows!

252
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,010
And I somehow managed to watch the same one twice!

253
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,510
It pissed me off.

254
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:26,110
Okay, anyway, as I was saying, so, yeah, so I bought, like,
I was like, oh, my God, I haven't seen Cirque du Soleil in

255
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,390
so fucking long, like, modern times.

256
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:39,350
So I was like, oh, shit, I'm gonna go watch Cirque du Soleil
because, obviously, I would think it'd be a new show if it's

257
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,410
touring again.

258
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:55,010
again they always they tour so much and they always come up
with new things so how the fuck was i supposed to know that

259
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:05,050
they will redo the same thing 15 year 15 to 20 years ago
anyway so yeah i remember i paid for the the one of the more

260
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:12,730
really expensive tickets because i wanted to be at the front
at the front because i hate sitting in the back because like

261
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:21,190
my eyes aren't as good as last okay not okay it might not
look like i'm wearing glasses right now but like when i wash

262
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:27,870
things i wear my glasses like yeah like oh i can still see
it but like i like seeing their like i could like seeing

263
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:34,170
their expressions and their faces because usually there's no
second or third screen because it's a circus if you guys

264
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:42,350
don't know for the yeah i paid for a fucking rerun like for
Cirque du Soleil they don't have like additional screens

265
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:48,590
where you can where zoom in on the faces and stuff like you
it's just like if you sit in the back it's just little

266
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:56,230
fucking stick figures so i didn't want to see that i was
like i really want like like experience the circus and like

267
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,830
experience like what they're what they're feeling when
they're performing and so i was like i ain't buying the back

268
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,110
seats i'm buying the front seats uh because i don't want to
see fucking stick figures trying to perform stuff because

269
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:20,070
it's not as impressive when they're so far TV because at
least a TV or DVD or the YouTube video has like close-ups

270
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:28,750
like I okay this is my opinion but like I rather just watch
if I'm going to watch something live I rather have watch it

271
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:35,510
like in the front rather than the back unless it's like a
huge concert thing I don't know I think like concerts that's

272
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,070
sort of different because for con performances it's a
different story but like concerts I'm fine with concerts if

273
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,810
I'm sitting in that back because it's all about the music
and like there's usually like screens where it'll close ups

274
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:56,050
and stuff of the performances but if it's like musicals
entertainment circuses stuff like that they usually don't

275
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:04,170
have an extra screen where you can like see what's going on
close up so like if I if I rather just sit in the front

276
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:10,050
where I can see what the fuck is going on then the back
because if I can't do that I might as well just watch the

277
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,870
thing on TV or like watch it on YouTube

278
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:29,130
Anyway So yeah I bought I got this in the front And I heard
the first song I heard the I even bought like overpriced

279
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:43,590
pretzels and Coke too I even spent money on overpriced
Concert food And Because that pretzel was so fucking dry was

280
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:49,090
like 15 canadian dollars so for you americans it's like five
dollars

281
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:58,150
so you americans out there it's like nothing for you guys
but for us it's like 15 canadian

282
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:17,250
anyway i i bought a fucking like i bought an overpriced dry
as fuck uh pretzel and uh and and an overpriced bottle of

283
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,310
coke just so watch a rerun and i was so fucking mad

284
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:36,110
like i heard the first song and i was like wait i know this
song why do i know this song it's like i i was like i was

285
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:42,110
like in denial at first i was like coping and being like why
do i I know this song.

286
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,970
There's no way I know this song.

287
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:51,310
And then after like the first 30 seconds, I was like, oh my
god, no, no.

288
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,120
So, so yeah, when I was in denial and then I was like
bargaining and then anger.

289
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,460
I'm sort of still like in, I'm still sort of like going
through the five stages of grief at the moment.

290
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,580
It's been months, but I'm still going through the five
stages of grief by the way.

291
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:28,860
I I felt so betrayed chat I felt so fucking betrayed um but
yes I feel like I'm just a very unlucky person sometimes I

292
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:37,880
feel like okay I'm either like of I'm either I'm so I'm I no
I know I am very unlucky I'm incredibly unlucky person and a

293
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,480
few times I'm like lucky is because I like

294
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:51,800
I would I get something or like if something good happens to
me is because I work so hard that it counteracts my

295
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,940
unluckiness I feel

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,240
No, no.

304
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,160
The Cirque du Soleil I've seen were the touring ones.

305
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,380
That's the worst part.

306
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,540
Like coincidentally, all the Cirque du Soleil, like the two
Cirque du Soleil shows I watched were the ones that they

307
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,200
decided to tour in my city.

308
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,260
And that was the worst part.

309
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,960
Yeah.

310
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,600

314
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:24,580
today i would now now i'm afraid because i don't remember
the name of the show i watched that's the worst part is that

315
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:31,440
i actually don't remember the show that i watched and i feel
like if i try to watch circus delay again for the third

316
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,720
fucking time i'm gonna just pay i'm gonna i will not be
surprised if it's the third time

317
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:56,820
mock me welcome to the welcome back to tomato farm welcome
back that's a me problem um let's see uh uh but yeah anyway

318
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:04,400
that's what i'm saying like uh oh my gosh how did i get to
this fucking tangent oh yeah it's because of my uh it's

319
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,860
because of how unlucky i was for for jrpgs i managed to
somehow choose two of the worst installments in the

320
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:25,600
franchise oh my god anyway i don't know you guys know this i
tweeted this out uh i tweeted this out but like um there was

321
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:34,660
like major fucking leaks in the animation uh in the
animation sector so for those who don't know i really really

322
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:47,260
love animation and like animated shows um i i i watched a
lot of them over the years because i honestly um especially

323
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:55,300
because like for drama stuff for drama shows i cannot do
like live action drama shows quite well because i just get

324
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:06,560
so depressed and i get i get so depressed and like I'm
already you know I'm already having a rough time I it's why

325
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:14,340
like I said this before but I normally watch like comedies
animation or like just things that are like super

326
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:24,500
light-hearted and I tend to avoid drama stuff or and like I
usually avoid like gore and things like I actually I hate

327
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:32,800
the gore and invincible I I hate it so much but like I
understand like in the show like it needs that but like i

328
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,560
always look away when the gore is coming in for invincible
because i can't handle that stuff like i actually look away

329
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:52,780
and like um and wait until it's over uh because like i'm
like bro life is already very depressing and i don't i i

330
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:03,720
don't need more of that um and like oh my okay also I I
don't understand people who complain the thing is okay you

331
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,700
guys don't know this but for those like some people might
not know is I actually read the invincible comics um and I

332
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:16,700
didn't finish reading it I think I read like I read the
ending of the comics for invincible and I read like um I

333
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,900
think like a couple of chapters in the beginning of
invincible but uh um anyway uh and like I know like the

334
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:34,140
major plot points in the comics too so like I know like
what's But anyway, apparently people who like read the

335
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,300
invincible comics, they were complaining about how little
the gore was.

336
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,920
I was like, are you fucking kidding?

337
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,000
They were like, you guys toned it down so much.

338
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,920
And I'm like, what?

339
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,200
What do you mean?

340
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,980
I was just like, you what?

341
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,860
more but if we had more the fucking ratings for that show
would be like like r18 at that point wait is it invincible

342
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:19,340
okay what what is invincible rating invincible rating uh
ratings for uh what is it parental rating i don't even know

343
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:26,860
what it's called oh it's mature yeah that's not even r18
it's mature but like i'm pretty sure if we go further it

344
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:39,200
would have been like heart heart it would have been like
r-a-t i was like there it was already too much for me and

345
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:49,860
like they added moments in there they added in their
thousand i was like what the fuck um yeah they said like the

346
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:58,400
people were complaining the like hardcore comic readers were
complaining that like they didn't go like hard enough I was

347
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,980
just like, are you what?

348
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,680
What do you I?

349
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:14,320
I was like, bro, I wish they toned it down I was like, bro,
I what do you mean?

350
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:22,760
It was like, oh my, I like, like, bro, I, like, bro,
sometimes I want to eat when I watch this show like

351
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:37,220
Sometimes, sometimes I want, yeah, but like M for mature is,
isn't M for mature, like less than R18?

352
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:46,620
Because like R18 is like a different, isn't it go like, uh,
um, what was it, what parental rating guide?

353
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,680
Okay, I need to look at the parental rating guide.

354
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm pretty sure 18 is the top and then mature is below that.

355
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,840
That's for video games.

356
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,200
There's different rating guides.

357
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,880
Bro, I can't keep up with this.

358
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,720
Like,

359
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,540
why can't it be universal?

360
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,100
I don't understand.

361
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:12,480
I, like, why can't just things be universal?

362
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,680
Just like how English is like one of the universal
languages.

363
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,480
We don't want like English too.

364
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh wait, British is English too.

365
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,880
And that is why the British aren't the universal English.

366
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,280
this is why this is why we don't acknowledge british english
and every time we're like how do you spell this okay that's

367
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:48,080
not true because is it fucked up for me to say that like
that's not true because the uk has uk has sort of forced a

368
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:56,360
lot of other countries to adopt the way of spelling in the
uk like color like okay like in canada we spell color with

369
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:04,120
c-o-l-o-u-r But I feel like we've sort of stopped doing that
because people make fun of us like the Americans make fun of

370
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,740
us whenever we do spell color that way

371
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:20,040
Whenever we we spell it that way because I don't spell it
like that anymore I've like assimilated into like Into like

372
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:29,680
mainstream universal England And I feel like the Americans
are wrong Why the fuck is there different?

373
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,300
There is, there's video games, movies, television, music,
comedy.

374
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,680
There's, what?

375
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,180
There's a max rate.

376
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,700
Okay, that's funny.

377
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:46,060
In comic books, instead of like mature, it's max, like for
explicit content.

378
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,700
That's pretty.

379
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,620
Okay, that's, that's funny that they don't even say mature.

380
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,600
It's like max com, max explicit content.

381
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,960
okay okay so in video games it's adults only with the a it's
mature and then a for adults only and then for a television

382
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:20,560
that it's mature audience oh okay no okay so the highest is
mature in television in movies it's restricted r and then nc

383
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,300
17.

384
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:30,140
oh may include violence sex behaviors or any other elements
that most parents would consider too mature for viewing by

385
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,980
their children.

386
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,040
Alright, that's good to know.

387
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,080
I wish it was universal because it makes it so much more
complicated.

388
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,880
Yeah, that's just way too complicated in my opinion.

389
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:48,400
I'd rather just be a universal thing because like, we
already have so many things to worry about,

390
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,260
We already have a lot of things.

391
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,300
Anyway, what was I saying?

392
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:03,260
How do I fucking how did I get to this topic oh my gosh
where was I oh no my tangents have its own tangents now

393
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:16,420
we're we're in too deep we're in too deep oh yeah animation
sorry I was supposed I was talking about animation so

394
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:29,360
recently there there has been a giant animation leak uh
where uh who I don't know some fucking insider in Disney

395
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:41,460
basically leaked a lot of pilots a lot of scripts a lot of
like pitch Bibles and a lot of like canceled show episodes

396
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:51,700
um uh on like anonymous forums and it was okay I read the
story behind it was so funny so I think like one of the main

397
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:59,340
discoverers was like some gravity falls fan that was like oh
my god guys somebody leaked everything on like twit like

398
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,860
they're like talking about it on twitter and then people
were like what what's going on and i was like reading the

399
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:14,340
story because i was like what how did all this got leaked so
apparently there was a thread and it was on anonymous forum

400
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:22,680
and it was a thread that was like um Oh my god, here's a
leak And then some other guy was like That's a shitty leak

401
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:29,280
Anyway, look here are all these other shows These other
shows that are so much better Than this leak that I'm

402
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:42,660
leaking That's so fucking funny Cause they're like They're
like Fuck that leak, that's a shitty one Let me show you a

403
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:55,140
good leak And then he proceeded to link He proceeded to link
like link all like a bunch of like unerred episodes And then

404
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:01,160
later on he was like even better here's some more links I
was like what

405
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:16,220
My god and then and then he was like he just started
Non-stop like there was like a leak war being like who has

406
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:24,520
the better Disney leak and it was all like Disney centric
because like the the the thread started talking about like a

407
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:34,200
dis like an unaired Disney pilot and and and then obviously
Twitter found out and was like oh my god these like Twitter

408
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:43,100
like um TV show stands found out and like especially Gravity
Falls because that fucking fandom is very um it's like it's

409
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:54,440
the fact that it's still two seasons if you guys didn't know
gravity falls technically only had two seasons and it it

410
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:12,240
ended let's see how long ago how long did gravity falls end
it ended in what wait what oh my god okay it ended on 23rd

411
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:23,500
okay 2016 oh my gosh is it 2016 yeah it ended on like 2016
really oh my god i need to like double check my information

412
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,100
at that point end of 2016.

413
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,060
oh my god

414
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:43,400
eight years and the fandom is still going incredibly strong
and like i'm not surprised that it was like a gravity falls

415
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:50,860
fan on twitter that made it like that brought the Tension of
it and then so then this another so then like people started

416
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,760
Compiling everything that came from that thread and They
were like freaking out and was like oh my anyway So I like

417
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:07,720
looked at the I looked at the there's like a folder with all
of it And I was so sad because okay, it was actually so

418
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:14,700
interesting because it talks about like people pitching
their ideas For Disney pilots for like Disney animated

419
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:21,360
pilots and stuff and there was like For different people
That tried to make DuckTales.

420
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,420
I thought that was so interesting.

421
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:33,840
Four different Animators, like four different Showrunners
try to Pitch their own version Of DuckTales.

422
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,920
And I actually I was like reading all four of them, and the
one That we got was the most interesting.

423
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:46,540
It was actually like, if you read the Pitch Bible, it was
actually Like the most interesting One and most creative

424
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:46,920
one.

425
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:54,700
out of the four um because like i think like two of them was
just based off of the original show and like it was just

426
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:00,960
like being like continuation of the original show i don't
remember the third one was also sort of creative but the the

427
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:11,800
one they picked that became ducktails the pitch bible was
like really creative and actually like put their own spin

428
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,940
because it wasn't just a lot of the DuckTales one was just
like a sketch and then words and then like a huge blurb of

429
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:25,120
words and being like blah blah blah this show is gonna start
out as blah blah blah blah blah but then the the one that

430
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:35,520
became the DuckTales reboot that we got was like an actual
comic I was like oh majority pictures I like that as

431
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,800
somebody that doesn't like to read

432
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,640
This catches my attention.

433
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,800
It's mostly visual.

434
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:52,780
Niji Night.

435
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,600
Thank you for the super chat.

436
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:53,860
Thank you.

437
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,380
Thank you.

438
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,260
I pooped a nose and now I go to sleep.

439
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,500
Work on Sunday is always exciting.

440
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,420
Hope you had nothing but fun and good times with chat.

441
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:01,880
Bye bye.

442
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,800
Also, I feel old because the PS2 is 24 years old this year.

443
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,580
Thank you for the super chat.

444
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:06,840
Thank you.

445
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,200
Thank you.

446
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:07,760
Oh my God.

447
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,260
The PS2 has graduated university and is trying to look for
its first job.

448
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,100
okay but it was actually interesting it was so interesting
because they got really they got really creative with their

449
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:32,300
pitch bible anyway within the leaks it was also like there
was also like darkwing duck as well and um and uh there was

450
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,900
also like darkwing duck and it was also like saying like
because it was going to be a re um it was going to be like a

451
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:46,300
reboot of darkwing duck and it was going to be like a
spiritual it was going to like follow up from ducktails but

452
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:53,080
apparently that got shelved and canceled if you guys didn't
know i was tweeting about it also but like disney animation

453
00:48:53,080 --> 00:49:04,220
is known to only make three seasons because like for them
analytic wise and research wise uh when they three seasons

454
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:15,540
is like the maximum they disney will usually go in terms of
like financing That by season four, they are really scared

455
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,900
that season four will lose money.

456
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:26,620
And three seasons to them, they think is the optimal
lifespan for any animated show.

457
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,800
Because it's like, they don't want to go to four.

458
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,940
Because they don't think they make profit.

459
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,180
Neb, thank you for the super chat.

460
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,420
Thank you.

461
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,020
Thank you.

462
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,140
You call that a leak.

463
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,740
This is a leak.

464
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:51,620
Yeah, and like, okay, the thing I don't understand is that a
lot of the, okay, the thing is, it really sucks too, because

465
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:57,960
a lot of these shows, they do really well with like tweens
and up, I'll say.

466
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,380
Kids don't like these shows.

467
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:06,780
You can say like kids are not like a super huge fan of like
the shows that we considered we would like.

468
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,020
Like Gravity Falls was really good.

469
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,380
I really like Gravity Falls.

470
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,880
I really like the Owl House.

471
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:20,300
um i really liked um star versus the forces of evil uh but
we don't talk about the last season okay apparently people

472
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:26,520
blame star versus the forces of evil last season four as the
one the main reasons why they don't do season four anymore

473
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:42,720
they're one of the reasons why they don't do season four
because uh stars versus the forces of got a season four and

474
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:52,460
like they lost a lot of money so so it like backed up
disney's ideas of like we never do a season four because

475
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,660
look at what they did

476
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:07,840
like look at what they did in season four do you want your
show to be like that so they and uh someone might i remember

477
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,100
like when i tweeted us i was like oh it wasn't canceled They
never had a plan to do season four.

478
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,940
They actually did.

479
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:23,040
It's just that it was super common knowledge for the
animation team, like in Disney, to know that, uh, to know

480
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:30,040
that, uh, most shows tend to not get a season four, that
they had, like, a backup plan.

481
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,780
Because, like, they had a backup plan to being like, okay,
if we don't get renewed, uh, if we don't get renewed, then,

482
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,460
like, this is how we're going to end it.

483
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:46,540
nude like this is always gonna be how we're gonna end this
show and it felt like i honestly felt it was super rushed

484
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:55,960
too and um and uh and even then the animation team was like
oh yeah like if we had more seasons i would want to do this

485
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:03,220
i would like love to do that and then they were planning on
having a season four and then uh duck tails and then having

486
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:08,720
and after season four is over that's when they end it and
then they'll do dark wing duck but they never did that

487
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,640
because disney was But the main reason is that they don't
make merch.

488
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,420
That's what pisses me off the most.

489
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:28,840
The only reason why Teen Titans Go has like 500,000 seasons
is that they spam so much fucking merch for Teen Titans Go.

490
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,700
None of these other Disney shows make merch.

491
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,920
I like that's what pisses me off because they're like, we
don't get it enough.

492
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,240
support for oh yeah an infinity train i'll fucking love
infinity train they're like we don't you're the shows you

493
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:54,140
love that you want us to make another season we don't get
enough uh we don't get enough profit from that because

494
00:52:54,140 --> 00:53:06,520
nobody's buying anything buy what what do you want us to buy
the fucking one dollar comic book

495
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:22,180
like where I'll go to a toy store as teen titans go where
the fuck is the outhouse buy the thing you don't make

496
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:35,820
exactly There's like there's like it's always merch but what
merch like what do we buy There's so much but but then

497
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:46,460
they're like oh Uh, but then they're like oh, but if we make
the merch no one's going to buy it because our data shows

498
00:53:46,460 --> 00:54:00,740
that like there it's just a lot loss of profit if we do make
that merch what data what fucking data if you don't make any

499
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,760
what data do you have What do I make?

500
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,340
Yeah.

501
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,580
Anyway.

502
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,720
It's crazy.

503
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,160
But they're willing to make the 500 fucking lightsaber for
Star Wars.

504
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,240
Yeah.

505
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,560
It's just...

506
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,380
Oh, man.

507
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,340
That's why I'm so sad.

508
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,800
Whenever shows get canceled.

509
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,680
Like, get, like, not renewed.

510
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:47,800
or cat like it shows i enjoy i really miss ducktails woohoo
but uh but um but uh ducktails woohoo yeah um they made

511
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:58,240
merch for graph barely like it wasn't like they barely did
made merch for gravity falls okay gravity uh falls you see

512
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:08,380
more shit for fucking teen titans goading dude was over
though but like i feel like there it did not exist as much

513
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:16,360
as like the other stuff going on there like especially like
a lot of merch they made for gravity falls was not geared

514
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:26,520
towards children they were clearly geared towards like
millennials like that's the issue they're like if this merch

515
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:34,880
does not sell for children there's no point in selling
anything and because of that There's no point in there's

516
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,440
this show does not make any profit

517
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:48,520
That's their data if they're fucking chose if the merch
doesn't sell enough for children They're like it's not

518
00:55:48,520 --> 00:56:09,490
profitable I still buy toys Disney but yeah when a company
is run by like 60 year old grandpa's who sometimes who some

519
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:16,390
of them still think animation is for children they just be
like it's not profitable because kids don't want to buy it

520
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:25,170
have you seen a kingdom hearts pile episode for disney's
channel it's on youtube moose thank you the super chat thank

521
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:35,290
you thank you i don't remember i think i have but um i think
i have but like i'm pretty sure i don't remember much of it

522
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:42,110
But I've also saw the, what is it, the Sailor Moon American
Sailor Moon cartoon.

523
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,870
And that one was a little silly too.

524
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:55,190
I think the American Sailor Moon cartoon was also a little
silly.

525
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:02,090
So I'm glad that they just brought over the Japanese Sailor
Moon over.

526
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,290
Doug, thank you for the super chatting thing.

527
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,830
you too fair we rather have three seasons than 13.

528
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:12,350
they tend to become a shell their former self so long as
they go on thank you that's super chat thank you thank you

529
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:19,010
that is true but like if there's still more of the story to
tell i don't see why like if the writers have more of

530
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:25,990
stories they want to tell and like i think it's different
when the show itself is not like it's not like a serialized

531
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:34,690
show where like um where the reason why a lot of shows don't
have any progression that's different a lot of like the

532
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:45,210
actual good animated shows um will have like a progression
of storyline and like where characters age um because like a

533
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:53,530
lot of them don't go like there's no it's very uncommon for
reruns to go that's why like a lot of like uh shows tend to

534
00:57:53,530 --> 00:58:00,850
have characters that just do not grow up for animation
because they can put reruns of that forever and ever so

535
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:13,770
and uh and uh because there's no like progression they can
just put random episodes for a rerun and stuff it's why like

536
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:21,370
the simpsons and like family guy and stuff they're all
fucking the same age forever they never age up because so

537
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:27,430
they can just put random simpsons episodes or random family
guy episodes because there's no like character progression

538
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:34,530
for anybody or like character development for anybody
they're just the same person but like what if this happens

539
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:43,170
and they're like what if that happens um i'm so moderately
bitter about where they ended the original team ties they're

540
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:49,250
never gonna bring it back because to them it's not
profitable because they're like whoa who bought the merch

541
00:58:49,250 --> 00:59:03,990
what they never made merch until team titans go like what
the do you mean like like the only started making actual

542
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:08,010
shit for teen titans the moment teen titans go drop like
what do you mean

543
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:25,890
um anyway yeah og teen titans is amazing but it's they're
never gonna bring it back because children like teen titans

544
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:31,850
go more like it's just more appealing to watch for little
kids like, I talked about this before.

545
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:37,430
I feel like, sorry, every time I talk about animation, I go
in a long ass tangent, but like this is one of my favorite

546
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,430
memes about Teen Titans Go.

547
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,970
Like, okay, schedule.

548
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:42,990
Let me see if I can find it.

549
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:43,570
I'll show it.

550
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,330
I, oh my god.

551
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:46,070
Okay.

552
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,690
All right.

553
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:54,050
This is one of my favorite, this is one of my favorite memes
about Teen Titans Go.

554
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,410
But this is, I showed this.

555
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:01,570
I talked about this before, but this is how profitable Teen
Titans Go was.

556
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:02,290
Like,

557
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:12,790
this was, this was the Teen Titans Go schedule.

558
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:20,030
It's like Teen Titans Go, Teen Titans Go, Teen Titans Go.

559
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:24,210
And then he gives a shout, whoa, Teen Titans Go Island
Adventure.

560
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:31,630
Oh my, and then there are two episodes of good for them good
good for them for putting that two episodes

561
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:46,550
like oh my god wow they gave steven universe a fucking bone
put two episodes at 7 30 p.m you know what it's good that

562
01:00:46,550 --> 01:01:00,450
they try to diverse a little bit you know um peter thank you
for the super chat thank you thank you uh could be worse

563
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:07,550
Batman Beyond didn't get comics until a decade later the
live action movie was also canned in the 2000s think of a

564
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:13,810
super chat think they they also can the animated movie
that's gonna be in the same style as like uh cost of the

565
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:22,310
spider-verse one too uh yeah they were they also canceled
that if you guys don't remember because it was totally it

566
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:30,410
was just they just didn't think it would be profitable uh oh
yeah no name thank you for the super chat thank you thank

567
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:37,570

01:02:56,710 --> 01:03:00,010
And it was so cool because I was doing the AIG with
everybody too.

578
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,190
And I was like super hyped for it.

579
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,050
But nothing happened!

580
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:04,350
Nothing happened.

581
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,010
Does Kids Next Door even have merch?

582
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:10,010
Obviously it doesn't because why don't we don't have a
sequel?

583
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:12,290
But at least it went more longer than three seasons.

584
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,430
At least we got six seasons of that.

585
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,550
But I would have loved to have the Galactic Kids Next Door.

586
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,370
I felt like that was like a missed opportunity.

587
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:26,490
um if they do it now they're just gonna be like banking on
nostalgia and like it's not gonna be the same it's just

588
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:34,790
gonna be flash animated and i don't want that i think i feel
like i feel like it's gonna it's gonna feel like so

589
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:44,070
different like i feel like it's gonna be it's just gonna
feel weird um like i i it's just gonna feel like super weird

590
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,110
i feel like the i feel like the budget wouldn't be the same.

591
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,790
It's like when like, what is it?

592
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:49,130
Okay.

593
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,810
It's like like Flash can be good.

594
01:03:52,150 --> 01:04:00,310
Flash animation can be good, but I feel like after a long
time, um, I mean like, obviously, oh wait, Flash is dead.

595
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,490
What's the newest one?

596
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:07,990
Um, but like, it can be good because like My Little Pony was
done on, uh, was it done on Flash?

597
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:13,390
No, what's the, what was he, what was the program they used?

598
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:20,690
But like, if you guys didn't know, the friendship is messed
magic episodes oh my god the budget for that shit was insane

599
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:33,510
oh yeah tune boon oh yeah tune boon um but okay uh budget
per episode it got really i was like reading up the budget

600
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:48,010
budget for each one six million what okay uh okay um what
okay it's like How much is it?

601
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,530
How much is that budget?

602
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,230
Budget for...

603
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,330
What was that budget?

604
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:54,750
Okay.

605
01:04:55,910 --> 01:05:00,350
It was like $200,000 to $300,000 per episode.

606
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,490
So each season would be like around $6,000.

607
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:10,650
Like, it was like, yeah, it was like $200,000 to $300,000
per episode.

608
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:14,190
But like, if you see how the production ran for that, you'd
understand it.

609
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,930
And then after...

610
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:28,830
yeah it was per episode merch fucking sold a lot though at
least anyway um anyway uh i read that like uh and then like

611
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:37,330
and then they try to like make a sequel for it but oh my god
the the the quality

612
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:55,030
like the the quality the quality of that the sequel was wow
wow we i was like looking at the animation quality i was

613
01:05:55,030 --> 01:06:07,970
like wow we that anime that's definitely not 200 to 300 000
per episodes anymore whoa anyway that's how i feel i feel

614
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:18,510
like if i felt like if we did if we do a sequel to kids next
door now the quality for that So it's like those who were so

615
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:29,090
hyped about Mega Man and People were so hyped because we're
like Mega Man's gonna get a secret and a show Okay, not Mega

616
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:29,210
Man.

617
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:29,790
Mega Man.

618
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,650
Sorry Mega Man.

619
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:39,150
Mega Man is gonna get a secret Movie and a show and everyone
was so hyped and people found out Will Ferro wasn't gonna

620
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:44,790
reprise this role as Mega Man And then that's when we all
know things are not gonna be as good as it seems and then

621
01:06:44,790 --> 01:07:00,490
the trailer dropped and then that's when everybody really
knew oh it's that type of sequel and and that's why i hope

622
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:09,030
that galactic kids next door stays fucking dead because i
feel like it's gonna be very similar

623
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:28,430
I could feel that if you wait too long if you wait too long
But like not long enough I feel like if you wait Too long

624
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:38,270
but not long enough The sequel will be really bad But if you
wait really long Really really long that like It's like some

625
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:46,250
fucking 90s 80s shit that you're rebooting Then it'll be
okay Because then like those people who reboot something uh

626
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:55,150
that long they want to make sure they take really good care
of the image of that like the reimagining of it but like i

627
01:07:55,150 --> 01:08:07,190
heard the new x-men animated show was like pretty decent too
um yeah is it x-men there's a new x-men show that seems to

628
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:15,590
uh that's like really good animation wise and uh i haven't
watched it yet but i heard the new x-men animated show was

629
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,370
like animation-wise, was really good.

630
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,210
I haven't watched it yet.

631
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,530
Um, I really love, I love the animated X-Men.

632
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:26,650
Not the, not the OG animated X-Men.

633
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:32,050
The one where they were like, fucking kid, like, not sorry,
where they were teenagers.

634
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,390
Okay, they were always teenagers.

635
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:38,550
But the one where they were like, it was like high school
drama, you know?

636
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:51,690
Where they were like, one was it watch x-men was that the
one where they was like high school drama almost every

637
01:08:51,690 --> 01:09:05,750
episode i was like x-men evolution yes yes i loved x-men
evolution that was that slaps um i love x-men evolution but

638
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:18,670
i think the funniest thing they did with uh the funniest
thing about the the new X-Men show is that they changed okay

639
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:31,930
what's his name they fuck what was his name okay X-Men 97
characters they like change people's powers because they're

640
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,070
like oh this is actually what it's like and I thought it was
so funny

641
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,870
Cyclops I don't know why I forgot Cyclops.

642
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:44,810
I'm sorry, my brain isn't working.

643
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,550
So Cyclops powers now.

644
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,510
So like, if you guys didn't know, it was so funny.

645
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:58,270
When I read the explanation, when I read the explanation for
Cyclops powers now, so like, you know how like we all know

646
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,670
it's laser eyes, right?

647
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,490
So like the reason why?

648
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:08,530
So we all know it's like laser eyes, like the normies, i.e.

649
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:10,530
me, or like laser eyes.

650
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,790
Yeah.

651
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:21,690
beams it shoots lasers but now modern wise it's kinetic
blast and now you guys are thinking oh doki what do you mean

652
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:33,670
by kinetic blast apparently his eyes are portals to the
fucking punch universe and the punch dimension and i and his

653
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:54,670
eyes pull out these punch lasers from a opens his eyes the
lasers punches you and it's like a fist so they're not

654
01:10:54,670 --> 01:11:02,510
actual like laser beams like you know super mad lasers it's
like a punch laser but like the normies always thought they

655
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:08,190
were you know super mad lasers and it's through this ad new
ad because there someone posted a

656
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:13,490
I am not, it's called the punch dimension.

657
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:20,750
His eyes are portals to the punch dimension so that when he
opens his eyes, he's punching people with his eye lasers.

658
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:25,710
I thought this was the dumbest thing I've ever read, but it
was also pretty funny.

659
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,470
Jonathan, thank you for the super chat.

660
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:34,750
Thank you, thank you.

661
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,490
Does Velma count as a reboot a series of Scoop?

662
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:38,770
We don't talk about Velma.

663
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:40,610
Do not hate watch Velma.

664
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:49,210
No, Matt, please, I beg of you, stop hate-watching things,
because the moment you start hate-watching things, you're

665
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:53,770
gonna give it attention and a reboot, or not reboot, a
renewal of a series.

666
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:54,810
Please don't.

667
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,670
We don't need another season of Velma.

668
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:58,970
Please stop hate-watching.

669
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:03,930
The only reason why Velma got another season is because we
all hate-watched it.

670
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:04,910
Oh my god.

671
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:17,690
suck the most is that the animation quality for Velma is
actually pretty good.

672
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,870
That's the worst part.

673
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:24,270
Like, I actually really like the animation budget for this.

674
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,370
Because they actually go hard on, like...

675
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,250
Guys, you know why I say stop hate watching it?

676
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,870
Because I also hate watched it.

677
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,450
I was part of the problem.

678
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:43,230
I was also part of the problem.

679
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:56,290
but the fucking animation quality was so good the writing
was fucking terrible of course but like oh my god the

680
01:12:56,290 --> 01:13:09,470
fucking the okay by the way not only did i guys i need you
all to stop hate watching felma because i already hate watch

681
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:15,750
season two and i need you guys to stop because i already did
my part and i need you guys to be stronger than me.

682
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,530
I need you.

683
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:21,310
I need you all to be stronger than me.

684
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:27,690
Like, it's not just me.

685
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,890
That's why I want you guys to be stronger.

686
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,630
Okay, no, I'll tell you the story.

687
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,870
I'll tell you the story of Alma.

688
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,810
I'll tell you season two.

689
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,090
Okay, Scrappy Do comes back in season two.

690
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:51,870
And I swear to God, I need this guy to stop being in every
animated show.

691
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:56,190
Not Scrappy Do, but the guy who fucking voices Scrappy Do.

692
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,330
So who voices Scrappy Do?

693
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,870
Okay, it is.

694
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,190
I need a fucking...

695
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,950
Okay, I need to like look up his name because I never
remember his name.

696
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:07,430
But his fucking voice is so iconic.

697
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:12,070
So the person is Jason Menzuka's.

698
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,390
And you guys are like...

699
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,530
Who's that?

700
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:22,930
He has been in every fucking animated show lately because
his voice is so recognizable, but he only voices as himself.

701
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:24,930
He only plays himself.

702
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:28,850
I swear to God, he has been typecasted as himself.

703
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:31,690
Every time.

704
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:34,570
It's some, okay, not himself, but like some fucking crazy
dude.

705
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,770
It's always some fucking crazy dude.

706
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:40,230
He's in everything now.

707
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,210
And I'm tired.

708
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,070
Like he has a great voice.

709
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:46,270
But I'm fucking tired of hearing him right now.

710
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:53,830
I'm fucking tired of hearing him in every animated show I'm
watching.

711
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,530
It's just, because he just plays the same guy.

712
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:01,110
Anyway, he's scrappy-doo, by the way.

713
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:06,330
He's, uh, uh, he's, he plays as a scrappy-doo.

714
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,750
And let me tell you the whole story.

715
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,490
Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell you season two of Velma.

hallucination is to eat so that throughout the He, he snacks

725

and eats a lot because he wants to stop the hallucinations.

726

01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,730
Quick Velma, give me a snack.

Yeah, he kills friends.

733
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:19,130
mom so he has like hallucinations but don't worry Fred's mom
was a bad person anyway the hex sisters are back but they're

734
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:33,510
old the hex sisters has a cameo by being like uh by being
like uh like like roommates with Daphne's parents um and um

735
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:41,310
and so like one of that it's like one of the hex sisters and
then like she has a child she's like old the hex sister is

736
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:50,310
old now it's one hex sister by the way it's one hex sister
and she's our mom now and she has a child who's a teenager

737
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:57,090
who go who are staying over at Daphne's place uh because
they're broke or something because they're open a witch

738
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:05,490
store anyway none of that is important the whole plot is
some fucking brain switching plot because Norville's fucking

739
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:13,250
grandmother is a scientist who was working on a thing called
Project Scooby and you're like what's Project Scooby Scooby.

740
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:18,150
What Project Scooby is like the brain swapping operation
thing.

741
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:25,210
So he like they Norville found out that his grandmother
never died and she was actually hiding out in the facility

742
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:34,310
where where she helps soldiers and helps people find the
true self by swapping their brains into a jar so they can

743
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:40,970
find themselves and they're like when they are when they are
in a jar when they're a brain in a jar um they realize what

744
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:46,690
they want to be in the future because they're like you know
they're they're just a brain in the jar so they can like uh

745
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:52,950
figure out what's their purpose in life and after they
figure out their purpose in life she swaps the brain back

746
01:18:52,950 --> 01:19:02,590
into that purse body so that's what project scooby is but
then there is a hidden person called uncle scooby and people

747
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:10,550
are trying to figure out who is the secret identity of uncle
scooby and the thing about that is that they created, Uncle

748
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:22,270
Scooby and the military created a project using the research
from Norville's grandmother to make scrappy do.

749
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,690
And scrappy do is like a fucking murderer.

750
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:29,210
Like, because, and the story starts off.

751
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:41,030
Let me just say, the story starts off in season two where
there has and now then they were wondering who committed

752
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:48,250
these murders and so they were trying to figure out who the
fuck committed all these murders and then later on they

753
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:53,950
found out that they that these people died by having their
dicks bit off so

754
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:16,340
some people were like oh my god all these middle-aged men
are getting our dick spit off what's going on and we

755
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:21,260
discovered it was scrappy dude this entire time

756
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:37,100
so um um um first person thank you for the super chat thank
you thank you thank you do anything for you to stop anything

757
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:52,080
you know what did you so anyway um anyway the ending of the
story is that everyone tries to stop scrappy dude from

758
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,800
fucking biting their tics

759
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:11,400
pay for my silence so people are trying to fucking um people
are trying to figure out like how to stop scrappy do from

760
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:22,520
killing everybody and it ends i'll just skip to the ending
chat and it basically ends where scrappy um where velma

761
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:34,420
sacrifices her life uh to to help stop scrappy do from
killing everybody and then she possesses and then scrappy do

762
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:47,080
and then like a fucking missile oh yeah the military sends a
missile at the school uh and and it hits scrappy do but

763
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:56,080
scrappy do survives but uh velma doesn't survive and then
scrappy do was like get ready to kill the rest of the the

764
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:02,740
rest of the gang and then he got possessed and died of a
heart attack i don't fucking know how he actually died it

765
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:09,940
just showed him getting possessed and then we found out
Velma becomes a ghost and ghosts are real

766
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:31,850
like people were like oh my god wait ghosts are real and
then um and then this the the season ends with a fact that

767
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:40,330
uh the season ends with them being like what do we do and
Velma Velma was like do I go to the light or do I stay here

768
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:50,530
and try to figure things out and and then the the heck
sister like daughter was like don't worry Velma I know a way

769
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:58,610
to get your body back and but I will need a study for we got
to wait until the summer so I need to study all these witch

770
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:08,090
books to figure out how to get your body back Velma and then
the show ends That was the end of season two

771
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:21,290
Look, I actually, like, took out all the fucking filler in
between So you're welcome, guys Because there was a lot of

772
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:33,230
things going on in between every Because, like, there was
one where Velma's mom gets together with Fred's dad And then

773
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:43,490
Velma's dad dad's new wife, like Velma's stepmom got
together, like Velma's stepmom was actually Uncle Scooby

774
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:52,990
this entire time, who was working behind the scenes
undercover as a waitress and like purposely tried to like

775
01:23:52,990 --> 01:24:03,110
get close to Velma's dad so that she could get more
information regarding like Regarding Project Scooby.

776
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:05,390
Like...

777
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:09,870
Anyway, Mercy, thank you for the Aka Supa.

My brain hurts.

785
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:24,050
Anyway, now you guys don't have to watch Velma Season 2.

786
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:27,430
Because all you need to know is that Scrappy Do is in it.

787
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:28,190
And he was biting.

788
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:32,150
Like, who, the first episode is, like, who are the murders?

789
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:33,390
It was Scrappy Do.

790
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:37,310
He was the one that bit everybody's dick off.

791
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:43,490
Anyway.

792
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:45,410
Also.

793
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,170
Also, by the way.

794
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,170
Oh, yeah.

795
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:52,390
Velma and Daphne are dating, too.

796
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:53,870
I don't know if that's relevant.

797
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:56,090
And Norville's dating a fucking brain.

798
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,110
And then Fred is just...

799
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:04,930
very stupid like i don't he has like mommy and daddy issues
uh

800
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:17,730
um wait thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you this
is my second time listening to your stream how how this

801
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:23,890

that i am playing a train simply simulator chuckling my ass

802
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:30,090

ghosts in a shell standalone complex thank you for the

803
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:45,270
akasupa thank you thank you um anyway that was velma season
two and after all of that i will have this okay to be fair

804
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:54,350
okay i have a confession i watched episode one to five of
season two and that skipped to the last episode because i

805
01:25:54,350 --> 01:26:06,290
was like because it was there was no progression i swear the
progression of the of season two was like 99% filler and

806
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:15,850
then 1% of the actual plot so I was like who the fuck is the
murderer I was so I swear to God I I couldn't like I was

807
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:25,270
just like who the fuck is the murderer I was just where
where every time it's just a filler episode I swear it was

808
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:34,070
like we make 1% progress of the fucking show plot and then
everything else was like Fred has mommy issues How is he

809
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:42,090
gonna solve that and like um, and Norville suddenly has no
empathy, but don't worry He's just gonna get it back in like

810
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,830
the next episode or something.

811
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:45,710
I'm like, where's the progression?

812
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:52,870
I just I just want to know who the fuck is the murderer
that's biting off people's dicks.

813
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,450
Who is it?

814
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:02,270
It's like at first you're like Oh somebody's chopping off
their dicks And I was like oh my god who the fuck is killing

815
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:07,950
people by chopping off their dicks And then later on we find
out that scrappy dude fucking eating it And I'm like what

816
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:14,410
the fuck and I got shown that in the last episode Like I
didn't find that out until the last episode where I just

817
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:17,790
skipped to the final episode To figure out what the fuck is
going on like

818
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,870
I need to take a break dookie.

819
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:37,330
I'm sorry This is too much Anyway Despite all of that I hate
how good the animation is Like the quality of the visuals

820
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:50,590
For Velma Is too good for what the show is about And it
hurts It actually is not fair It's not fair at all Why is

821
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:52,930
the quality so good

822
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:07,290
There was like moments in there where I was like, wow, the
animation and the face animation and the visuals and the and

823
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:13,730
there were moments where they do like insane shading and
like expressions and everything.

824
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:16,030
And I'm like, why does this look so good?

825
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:21,530
But why does this look so fucking good for the show I'm
watching?

826
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:30,710
Anyway, I hate watch that show, so you don't have to.

827
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:35,810
Please do not give, please do not give Velma another hate
watch.

828
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:36,790
I beg of you.

829
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,230
It does not deserve a season three.

830
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:43,210
I swear to God.

831
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:50,910
I know you guys are like now super curious, but I swear to
God, it was, it, it, it sounds better than what it actually

832
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:51,370
is.

833
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:56,690
Like, Scooby's not even in it, guys.

834
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,570
Scooby-Doo isn't even in it, chat.

835
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:02,490
Alright, anyway.

836
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:10,770
Anyway, there was, that was, I can't believe I said majority
of this chatting stream today.

837
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,070
Just talking about animation.

838
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:16,290
I was just incredibly passionate, chat.

839
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,250
I was, I was so fucking passionate.

840
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:22,910
Jumping on to another topic, what the fuck is Tarkov doing?

841
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:37,910
doing did you guys hear about it i didn't like i never like
joined uh i never played tarca um but like um for those who

842
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:46,310
don't know uh for those who don't know tarcaf like basically
like a little i guess like um speed run of what's going on

843
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:53,510
right now tarcaf basically tried to release a game that was
like 200 plus dollars and people were like what the fuck

844
01:29:53,510 --> 01:30:00,590
it's like this paid away oh yeah and it's like paid a win
dlc and it basically sort of killed tarcoff at the moment

845
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:08,270
but like not fully because i was talking to one of my
friends and i was because like they love tarcoff and i was

846
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:14,210
like yo and then they were like i don't know what to play
and then i was like what do you want playing and they're

847
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:16,390
like i'm gonna play tarcoff i was like what the fuck

848
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:30,010
they're like uh what do you mean why are you playing didn't
like didn't like shit happen why are you playing tarcoff and

849
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:38,550
then my friend was like my friend he was like oh it was on
sale because of all that drama

850
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:50,270
it was like it was like oh yeah you know like after
everything they put it on sale and i was like i couldn't

851
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,150
miss the opportunity like

852
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:03,830
yeah it was i think it was like 50 or something because he
was like oh yeah i don't know when it's gonna be like 50

853
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:07,630
again i might as well like buy buy the dip

854
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:19,190
yeah because because of everything that's going on at the
moment Tarkov decided to do like a huge fucking sale to like

855
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:25,190
convince people that they're they're like thinking about the
consumers now and they're like think like they're like sorry

856
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:34,070
for the mistake we made uh but we're gonna uh gaming
marketing is so it is it is I talked about this before

857
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:41,290
because don't matter how much like Nintendo does you the
moment they release a new legend of zelda you guys would

858
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:54,010
just eat that shit up it doesn't matter what they do like
the gaming audience is so easy to manipulate like like did

859
01:31:54,010 --> 01:32:06,130
you guys heard about about like uh get the gary's mod shit
like do you guys you sell that where where like it's like

860
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:12,330
okay the new the new the gary's mod thing where They're they
don't we don't know if it's like actually nintendo like

861
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:22,590
people don't know for sure yet But basically the whole gist
is that nintendo filed like copyright takedowns on uh on uh

862
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:32,790
gary's mod and um So gary's mod now has to take down like 20
years worth of nintendo ip stuff in in gary's mod and that's

863
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:42,090
20 years It was so sad that gary's the devs of gary's mod
was like It would help so much if you guys could take it

864
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:51,670
down yourself because there's 20 years of There's like
there's 20 years of content and it's so much to do

865
01:32:55,860 --> 01:33:07,080
And And They're like please and just don't re-upload it And
like the Viking desert like please take it down for us

866
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:19,800
it's not the first time and it's not going to be the last
and like the moment they release something oh my gosh and

867
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:32,420
then nintendo's gonna be like guys we're gonna make a legend
of zelda movie and you guys would just forget yes yes you

868
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:36,280
guys would be like next nintendo direct oh my god um
nintendo

869
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:57,020
yes you guys gamers you're just so easy to fucking like
we're very simple-minded I I'm simple-minded I would know

870
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:12,120
that's weird that's what I'm saying it's there's just so
simple-minded that would be like oh my god fucking 80% off

871
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:18,920
of Tarkov might as well like we don't know when that's gonna
happen again it just sucks because like Tarkov is like one

872
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:26,760
of the only it's only if somebody makes a better better
Tarkov-esque game because like every time somebody tries to

873

01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:03,080
It's going to be one collab because the other one got
rescheduled.

930
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:10,760
It was supposed to be a singing lessons with Yusun next
week, but then we had like conflict of schedules between the

931
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,220
two of us.

932
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:16,940
So, um, we decided to reschedule that to, um, two weeks
later.

933
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:22,260
I don't remember the exact date, but, like, uh, that's why
it's going to be one, one collab next week instead.

01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,300
So, next time, two.

So, just look forward to that other collab soon-ish.

01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:29,100
I think it's going to be, like, in two weeks or something.

937
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,820
Anyway, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.
