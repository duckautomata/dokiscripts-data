1
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:10,690
everybody Oh my god, I just woke up from a nap Actually 10
minutes ago I woke up from a nap at like 12, 12, 20 and I

2
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:20,230
was like, oh fuck I was like, oh fuck I took an hour nap
because I was so tired I woke up at like, okay, so I'm so

3
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:29,790
fucked, my schedule is so fucked I've been trying to fix my
sleep schedule For like, like, I don't know, like almost two

4
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,630
weeks now.

5
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,030
It's not been great.

6
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,390
It's not been great.

7
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,110
Every time I think I fixed my sleep schedule, I fucked it up
somehow.

8
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,170
So I woke up at like 4 to 5 a.m.

9
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,570
And then I was like, oh, that's fine.

10
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,550
That's okay.

11
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,930
I'll just work then.

12
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,970
I can't fall back asleep.

13
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,830
I guess I'll just work.

14
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,910
And then I was like, so...

15
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,070
I was all right.

16
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,770
I was like, yeah, I'm so energetic.

17
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,990
I have all the energy in the fucking world and then And then
11 a.m.

18
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,650
Hit me and I was like, I I just want to fucking sleep.

19
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,090
I just want to sleep I was like, all right one hour nap.

20
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,510
That'll be okay.

21
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,390
Oh my god.

22
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,230
And then when I saw it was 12 20 I was just like, okay.

23
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,910
All right, time to wake up.

24
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,030
But I have to stream.

25
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,990
I was actually very impressed with myself being able to set
everything up.

26
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,390
And, like, I honestly thought I was going to be late because
I was, like, 10 minutes to set everything up.

27
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,810
But the best thing about being a tomato is that I can just
put on a skin suit and that's it.

28
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,050
Like, I don't have to actually, I don't have to actually get
dressed.

29
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,430
I can just, I can just, you know, just get on the PC, turn
on everything.

30
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:06,930
the game uh bam i'm ready i am so fucking ready oh my god
anyway for those who are wanting i remember when i put this

31
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:18,230
on my schedule people were like what the fuck is suck up i
need you guys to know that like um i get a lot of like game

32
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:25,850
ideas from other youtubers because like usually they already
figure out what's what are the fun games

33
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:43,650
you know work smarter not harder so um i i follow a lot of
like uh youtubers like uh uh fuck which which guy did play

34
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:55,370
this game which guy played this game let me was it was it
delirious okay hto delirious from um so like basically a lot

35
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:06,930
of like collab games and like um single like a lot of collab
games i usually like get the ideas from other like gaming

36
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:15,970
channels that are that are mostly centric around like group
games you know like collab games so that i would like you

37
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,690
know i'll just be like hto delirious and like his crew and
then they would always have like all these games they play

38
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,390
together with their friends and i was like oh thank god i
don't have to research

39
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:41,290
i just be like oh someone was like why not venas venas oh my
gosh i'm sorry venas is like that that's like actual og

40
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,990
that's like it was like a 10 year old shit what 10 years ago
he would be like super popular yes but all he does is he

41
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:56,830
plays gta and gene mode that's literally majority of his
videos that's literally like majority of his videos he

42
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:05,210
either does like gta or or gmod but like his his like his
other friends like the other the other people he collabs

43
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:14,510
with they actually play like different games that's not gta
and gmod so it's like a lot easier it's a lot easier to grab

44
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:31,810
um so so like I saw delirious HTO delirious playing uh suck
up and it's basically it's all about trying to outsmart chat

45
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:43,370
GPT like that's really it so so you're a vampire and all
you're trying to trick like the NPCs like chat GPT to let

46
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:52,530
you into the house By like I don't know by like by being
smarter than them and you are trying to trick the AI We're

47
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:00,650
trying to overthrow AI and being smarter than them and
better than them And when they let us into their house, we

48
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:09,550
kill them So like it's all about trying to over overthrow
our AI overlords and that's really it Sue, thank you for the

49
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,470

51
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:19,810
Thank you So that's really the whole premise of suck up I'm
also fucking stupid for scheduling two streams today because

52
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,530
I was like, Toki, come on, get back into it.

53
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,390
You love streaming.

54
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,330
You want to beat Batman too.

55
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,430
And now I'm like sort of low-key regretting it because I'm
just like, oh my God, to do two streams today.

smarter than chat gpt you guys not know like what is it like

87
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:18,720
um if there's too much ai stuff going on going on it'll end
up like taking a it'll end up analyzing ai AI is just gonna

88
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,240
get stupider and stupider and stupider because okay stupider
isn't a word AI is just gonna get more and more stupid

89
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:35,720
because because it's taking in AI data it's not learning
from real people and because of that um they're getting more

90
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:46,340
and more stupid and so like that is why in the long term AI
will never win over real humans okay here we go there you go

91
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:52,860
anyway Taking a cool vampire like you shouldn't be bumming
it in the dumps.

92
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,460
Taking over someone's house is as easy as giving them a
little bite.

93
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,520
But silly vampire rules dictates you need to get invited
inside first.

94
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,060
Who the fuck made that rule?

95
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,660
Just turn press and use your wicked wit to win their
invitation.

96
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,360
But tread carefully.

97
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,600
The local neighborhood watches on patrol with eyes sharper
than a wooden stake.

98
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
Okay, let's go hunting.

99
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:28,680

eyes that's the eyes of a fucking gaslighter um jesus christ

101
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,780

selling something all right knock knock

102
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,260
Yo, what's popping, fam?

103
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,860
Who's trying to get lit up in here?

104
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,720
Okay, I think I don't want to talk to this person.

105
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,840
I'm still...

106
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,300
No!

107
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,520
I don't want to be a vampire!

108
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

109
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,440
Alright, sorry.

110
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,360
I really don't want to talk to a zoomer right now.

111
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,380
I really...

112
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,500
Alright, knock-knock.

113
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,140
I need a trickie...

114
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Oh my god!

115
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,820
The elderly!

116
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,860
They're the easiest people to trick!

117
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,320
Oh, my stars and garners.

118
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,520
Hello there, young one.

119
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,880
What brings you out in this chilly evening?

120
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,560
Um, okay, what can I do to...

121
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,760
Oh.

122
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,140
Wait, what do I got?

123
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,760
Hello, I'm your long-lost grandson.

124
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,260
Can I please come in?

125
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,860
Wait, what?

126
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,700
Best of luck finding your...

127
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,600
Stay safe out there.

128
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,240
No!

129
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,960
How do you know?

130
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:42,960
No!

131
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,380
Okay, wait, wait.

132
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,160
How does she know I'm not?

133
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,740
How does she know?

134
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,360
Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

135
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
Okay, wait, I got an idea.

Bless your heart, honey.

137
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,980
But I'm afraid you got the wrong guy.

138
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,340
Now off you go, and mind those dark alleys.

139
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,140
Wait, she's not gonna fucking let me back in.

140
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,820
I look like a grandson.

141
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,440
Okay, here you go.

142
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,320

I'm a different person now.

148
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,220
I have a helmet.

149
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,120

I needed... I wanted to reassure her.

160

trick.

161
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,840
They're, like, the number one scam target.

162
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,220
All right.

163
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,380
New hat, new me.

164
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,840
All right.

165
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,360
Congratulations, Granny.

166
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,500
You are the 100,000 person that opened this door.

167
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,380
I am here to grant you a check.

168
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,240
Oh my, that's quit.

169
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,780
But I'm afraid I can't accept checks from strangers.

170
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,760
Thank you for the offer.

171
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,060
What do you mean?

172
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,620
It's free money.

173
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,740
It's literally...

174
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,160
I can't believe.

175
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,760
It's literally free money.

176
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:12,860
It's...

177
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,440
Okay, don't worry.

179
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,440
Okay, don't worry.

180
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,920

I'm sorry, but I can't help.

191
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,290
You should find someone.

192
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,990
It's your son!

193
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,350
What do you mean?

194
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,930

Oh!

196
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,330
Okay, she doesn't give a fuck.

197
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,910
It's literally her son.

198
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,250
Okay, I can't believe it.

199
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,310
I thought like, I thought like, Granny, is there supposed to
be the easiest people to scam?

200
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,010
How is this possible?

201
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,590
How is she so smart?

202
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,370
Thank you, Sally.

203
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,210
My son is dead.

204
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,610
That's fucked up.

205
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,750
You don't know that.

206
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,250
Okay, I need to like...

207
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,050

Okay, this should work.

211
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,790
This should work.

212
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,170

Mashed potato and fries.

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,420
Please come in and let's remiss while we enjoy this
scrumptious meal.

228
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,400
I can't believe that worked.

229
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,180
I can't believe that.

230
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,960

231
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,980

232
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,280
What happened?

233
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,320

I can't believe I...

241
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,900
I played myself.

242
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,260
I can't believe...

243
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,800
I can't believe I broke the game.

244
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,560

Who might you be, dearie?

251
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,180
You just caught me as I was getting too bit late for your
trick-or-treat.

252
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, my apologies.

253
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
I'm afraid I don't have any treats for you today.

254
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,340
Have a lot.

255
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
What the fuck?

256
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,420
What is wrong with you?

257
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,700
You say you don't have any treats and you're going to slam
the door in front of my face?

258
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,780
Okay.

259
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,840
All right.

260
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,920
I'm going to use the Uber Eats line again.

261
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
All right.

262
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,160
Okay, I got this.

263
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,240
Hello, Uber Eats here.

264
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
I have your order.

265
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,520
Just leave Granny alone already.

266
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,400
What?

267
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,960
Now it doesn't work out.

268
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,580
What do you mean?

269
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,860
What do you mean?

270
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,320
No, I will refuse to go to another house.

271
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,720
I will fucking kill the Granny.

272
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,300
But, like, she will consent because she invited me in.

273
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,280
So that's consent.

274
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,360

275
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,580

Alright, don't worry.

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,760
You said it.

279
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,400
The granny's gonna die first.

280
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,560
Alright, okay, okay, guys.

281
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,680
Apparently I need help.

282
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,880
Okay, what should I say then?

283
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,680
Guys, what do I say?

284
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,860
The AI learned.

285
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,380
Granny won't say...

286
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,860

287
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360

Don't worry, ma'am.

293
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,980
This is pro bono.

294
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,720
I saw your light from outside, and there's something wrong.

295
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,200
You have to let me in.

296
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,700
Or the house is going to explode.

297
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,080
Now, you just hold it on there, young man.

298
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,360

299
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,620
You need to your house is going to explode.

300
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,740
Like, stop.

301
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,640
Too aggressive.

302
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,260
Okay.

303
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm too aggressive.

304
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,120
right?

305
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,480
Alright, don't worry.

306
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,480
Okay.

307
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Skip 101 but Granny.

308
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,180
Alright, I got different.

309
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,840
Okay, okay.

310
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm too aggressive, right?

311
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,540
Alright, don't worry.

312
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,400
I can be less aggressive.

313
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,020
I can be...

314
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,040
Or not aggressive enough.

315
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,840
Okay.

316
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,760
Hello.

317
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,480
This is the FBI.

318
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,360
I need to come in.

319
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,680
Hello.

320
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,140
Oh, you must be mistaken.

321
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,380
There's no need for you.

322
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
You can't say there's no need for the FBI to come in.

323
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,540
I'm the FBI.

324
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,280
You can't just say no to the FBI.

325
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,420
Excuse me?

326
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,800
You can't say no to the FBI.

327
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,960
Then what's the point of having FBI if you have, like, zero
jurisdiction to go anywhere?

328
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,700
I'm sorry, Deary.

329
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,780
I'm Canadian.

330
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,660
FBI.

331
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,640
All right.

332
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,300
Okay.

333
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,140
All right.

334
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,240
I need a warrant.

335
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,240
Apparently she can't.

336
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
All right.

337
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,480
All right.

338
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,000
What do I say?

339
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,340
What do I say?

340
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,720
Apparently Uber Eats doesn't work anymore.

341
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,940
Say you have...

342
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,120
Oh.

343
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,400
Hello, Granny.

of anime.

Oh my god.

00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,030

Konnichiwa, fellow Otaku.

Say, Young Sheldon, that's really sad.

660
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,610
What do you mean?

661
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,130
Young Sheldon is actually a pretty good show.

662
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,470
Okay, so lovely.

663
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,490

Okay, wait, I think I know.

665
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,870

00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:44,230

669
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:03,990
Okay.

670
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:10,330
Well, we all know I'm a fake anime fan, but like that guy is
worse than me.

671
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,850
That guy is worse than me.

672
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,450
Okay.

673
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,870
The text hurts.

674
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,030
Oh my gosh.

675
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,890
I totally saw that episode.

676
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,990
It was such a shocker, right?

677
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,010
But don't worry.

678
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,170
I'm sure there's a hidden meaning behind Naruto's actions.

679
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,590
Let's have the license again.

680
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:35,310
Let's analyze it together, fellow Shinobi.

681
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,990
God, I don't want to call him a fake fan.

682
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,250
Oh, it's so cringe.

683
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,390
I want to come, but I need to kill him.

684
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,570
I want to call him a fake fan, but I need to kill him.

685
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,130
Um, all right, wait, wait, what do I say?

686
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,850
What do I, pretty sure Dunky is dying of saying?

687
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:58,930

What celestial discovery have you made today that's brought
you to my humble abode?

01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,690
Let's rejoice in the wonders of the universe.

908
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:48,070
Father, God told me there is a zombie apocalypse.

909
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,450
Oh, dear, a zombie apocalypse.

910
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:55,910

911
01:03:56,370 --> 01:04:02,050
Well, my friend, if that's truly the case, we must prepare
ourselves for battle against the forces of darkness.

912
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:08,730
Let's pray and seek guidance from the Almighty to protect us
from this impeding doom.

913
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,230
It won't work.

914
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:13,730
The zombie story is going to work, chat.

915
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,070
It's going to work.

01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,570

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,080
This isn't a comp version I had in mind.

926
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,840
And it was that easy.

927
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,420
I told you guys.

928
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,700
I told you guys I can get this to work.

929
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:49,480
I told you guys I can get the zombie apocalypse to work.

930
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,460
You guys didn't believe me.

931
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,280
None of you believed me.

932
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,460
All I needed was the angel wings.

933
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,320
That's all I needed.

934
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,240
Amen.

935
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,160
I told you.

936
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,940
Rest in peace, old man.

937
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,580
That has zero wings on...

938
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,400
What do you mean?

939
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,060
I literally ate him.

940
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,240
What do you mean?

941
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,080
I tricked the priest.

942
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,520

943
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:21,840

Thank you.

945
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,580
Funs to prepare for the zombie apocalypse.

946
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:26,580
17.

947
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,780

Thank you.

949
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,440
Oh, shit.

950
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,360
Oh, shit.

951
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,120
Don't worry.

952
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,140
Now I'm the priest.

953
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,440
Is this the priest room?

954
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,980
No, that's the gun guy.

955
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,200
I'm going to grab the gun, though.

956
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,640
I want the gun.

957
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,440
Priest would have...

958
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:42,740
Okay.

959
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,520
Why will fucking kill...

960
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,720
I want to kill Regina now.

961
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,720
Fuck Regina.

962
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,380
I hate her.

963
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:50,780
Like...

964
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,600
Fucking hate Regina.

965
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:55,860
Alright.

966
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,460
Alright.

967
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,240
Oh shit, okay.

968
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,640
What if I just tell her I'm a vampire?

969
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,440
Maybe she's a twilight nut.

970
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,880
Maybe she's a twilight nut.

971
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,020
Well, well, well.

972
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,740
It is the king of the nerds.

973
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,080
What brings you to my doorstep at this ungodly hour?

974
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,260
Spill the tea.

975
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:18,500
Regina.

976
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,520
Everything Stephanie Myers wrote about vampires.

977
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,820
It is true.

978
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,060
We do sparkle.

979
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,560
I am Edward's cousin.

980
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:39,880
oh please like i'm gonna believe that vampires don't sparkle
it's just sad attempt at making them glamorous you can keep

981
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:51,060
your delusions to yourself edward's cousins are not what you
don't you're not a twilight girl oh my she's a jacob fan she

983
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,700
Wait, okay, okay, wait.

984
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,580
I can't believe she's not for Team Edward.

985
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:08,960
What the fuck?

986
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:09,880
Okay.

987
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,160
What if I just...

988
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:12,820
No, I can't!

989
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,300
No!

990
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,060
Let me talk to Regina!

991
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,200
Let me talk to her.

992
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,720
If I just wear a crown, I can be like a werewolf.

993
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:31,120
because like werewolves are mostly ask you about werewolf
puberty I can't believe Regina was a fucking team Jacob all

994
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:39,600
along hello Regina I would fucking kill Regina I have no
time for your vampire families and I definitely don't care

995
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,440

dumpster I can't believe I have to see this mess at my

997
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:00,140
doorstep, just leave before you tarnish my perfect image any
further.

998
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,560
Team Jacob?

999
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:12,180
Like, as if Team Jacob, that's so last year.

1000
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,600
I can't even handle your fashion choices.

1001
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,040
Learn your poor taste in fictional.

1002
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,920
What is... What does she like?

1003
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,960
What does she like?

1004
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,380
What is she into?

1005
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,200
All right.

1006
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,600

Why is there two guns?

1010
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,060
What do teenagers like these days?

1011
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,940
I can't relate to them.

1012
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,120
All I knew was Team Edward and Jacob.

1013
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,780
Oh my god.

1014
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,120

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,300
It's Halloween.

1028
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,400
Not a fashion disaster convention.

Okay, wait.

1056
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,140

A rejected contestant for America's next top model?

1064
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,520
What's up with the lab coat and the crown?

1065
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,580
I mean, that's a bold statement.

1066
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,720
Not that I would ever wear it.

1067
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,530
Do you want to commit some online activism?

1068
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:49,930
Online.

What are you?

1075
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:05,810
You're going against everything I know or like think I know.

1076
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:13,950
I like, I don't, I don't know what she wants.

1077
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:18,910
Fashion.

1078
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:20,850
Okay, we'll talk about fashion.

1079
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:21,990

He took my beret so I can't wear it.

1102
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:02,350
Wait, I need to get the long hair.

1103
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:03,770

1105
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,190

1107
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:10,930

01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:16,610

1110
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,430
Oh, there it is.

01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,230

Well, Rebecca actually wants to date Charlie.

01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,260

Okay, we're losing her.

1178
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:26,910
We're losing her.

1179
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,270
What else does she want other than tea?

1180
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,930
What else does she want?

1181
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,610
No, we're losing her!

1182
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:39,210
Um, oh my god.

01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:44,190

01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:45,130

01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:54,990
Well, thank you, darling.

01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,050

01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,310
Tailor specifically for me.

1190
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:00,750
But enough about me.

1191
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,890

01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,130
Okay, fuck, okay.

1194
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,350
Shit, I need to make up more about this gossip.

1195
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,810
I need to make it.

1196
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:15,550
Okay, wait.

01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:19,370
Fuck, okay.

1199
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:20,110
Guys.

1200
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:25,450
She's in the gossip loop right now.

1201
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,550
Oh, oh my God.

1202
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:28,610
Oh, my God.

1203
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,070
Oh, my God.

1204
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:37,350
But, Regina, the craziest part is that Charles actually
likes Jerry.

1205
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:43,830
No way.

1206
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:45,690
Charles likes Jerry?

1207
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,650
That's like the plot twist of the century.

1208
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:52,890
This candle is getting better and better.

1209
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,550
You really know how to keep me entertained.

1210

01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:58,470

1213

Oh man, I would love to share any more tea, but I even have
photos on my phone, and I need to be inside to share that to

01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,380

Oh my God.

1256
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:40,230
Tommy, my car broke down and I don't know anything about.

1257
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,570
cars.

1258
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,550
Oh, but my cars can be a real pain.

1259
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:56,050
Well, lucky for you I'm a bit of a mechanic myself, which
seems to be the problem.

1260
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:16,540
Oh my, you big, strong man's gonna help me fix my car.

Everything's gonna be awkward.

1267
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:27,860
Tell him you need help with the exhaust pipe.

1268
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,680
Oh my god.

1269
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:30,300
Alright.

01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,680
You're so right, Tommy.

1271
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,680
Cars are so tricky.

1272
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:39,800
I hope you can help me fix my car and help me.

1273
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:46,630
Oh, well, I'll certainly give my best shot.

1274
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:50,750
I can't promise anything about do what I can to help you.

1275
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:55,310
Let's go take a look at your car and see if you can figure
out the problem.

1276
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:57,110
Alright, fuck.

1277
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:58,430
Okay, I don't have a car, though.

1278
01:26:58,830 --> 01:26:59,670
I don't have a car.

1279
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,090
I don't have a car.

1280
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,130
Wait, wait.

1281
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,590
Oh, I'm so stupid.

1282
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:12,750
I forgot to mention it was actually a flat tire.

1283
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,810
Do you have a spare tire inside your house?

1284
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:22,590
I don't keep spare tires in my house.

1285
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,090
That's more of a garage thing.

1286
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,330
But don't worry, we can still fix it.

1287
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:29,250
I grab the tools and we can change the tire outside.

1288
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:29,990
Sounds good.

1289
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,990
Sounds great, Tommy.

1290
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:34,850
Thank you so much for helping me.

1291
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:39,430
How can I ever repay you before I kill you?

1292
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,370
No need to worry about that.

1293
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,550
I'm just happy to help up.

1294
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:49,710
Maybe you can treat me to a cup of coffee or something when
we're done.

1295
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,770
Oh, Tee-hee.

1296
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,430
Oh, no.

1297
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:56,030
Fuck, okay.

1298
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:57,210
It's okay.

1299
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,730
It's okay.

1300
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,090
He'll be dead anyway.

1301
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:01,870
Hmm.

1302
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:06,610
Of course, Tom.

1303
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,410
Can I call you Tom?

1304
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:12,370
I would love to have a cup of coffee with you.

1305
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,910
I've heard of you, huh?

1306
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:17,790
Sure thing.

1307
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:19,110
Tom works for me.

1308
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,850
Coffee sounds great.

1309
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,290
Let's focus on changing that tower first.

1310
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:24,410
And then we can grab it.

1311
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:27,550
that cup of coffee and chat some more deal?

1312
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,770
Please just let me in!

1313
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,310
Let me in!

1314
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,270
Let me in!

1315
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:42,390
Oh my god.

1316
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,490
Alright.

1317
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:48,010
I'm so tired, Tom.

1318
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:51,590
Can I rest inside while you help me with my car?

1319
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:57,030
Look.

1320
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:58,990
Look, I can't let you in my house.

1321
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:02,790
It's not personal or anything, but I just don't think it's a
good idea.

1322
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:07,270
We can finish fixing your car and then you can rest in your
own vehicle or find a...

1323
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:08,730
What the fuck?

1324
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:13,610
Bro!

1325
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:17,110
What do you think I'm gonna fucking steal stuff?

1326
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:18,670
Tom!

1327
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:21,490
You think I'm gonna steal stuff from you, Tom?

1328
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:23,470
Why don't you trust me?

1329
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,990
He's hiding something.

1330
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:35,070
something he doesn't want me to okay okay i'm gonna use the
toilet oh my god i i need to use the toilet real quick tom

01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,000
What the fuck?

1336
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:14,760
Oh, shit.

1337
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:16,180
Oh, shit.

1338
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,240
He's not gonna come inside, right?

1339
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:18,900
No, he's not.

1340
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,200
Okay.

1341
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,120
Alright.

1342
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,580
I can't believe it.

1343
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:25,140
I can't believe he wouldn't give me the fucking coffee.

1344
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,540
I can't believe he would just slam the door on me like that.

1345
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,000
That's so fucked up.

1346
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:33,260
Alright.

1347
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,200
Oh, shit.

1348
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:35,600
Whoops.

1349
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,500
I didn't see him.

1350
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,060
Don't take my outfit.

1351
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:40,420
Please.

1352
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,040
Please.

1353
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,160
Don't take the gun.

1354
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,320
Don't take the gun, officer.

1355
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,660
Oh, thank God you didn't take the gun.

1356
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,660
Okay, you didn't take the gun.

1357
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,240
You didn't take the gun.

1358
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,280
Bro, Tommy's so fucking rude.

1359
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,040
Fuck Tommy.

1360
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,840
I'm not gonna talk to Tommy ever again.

1361
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:55,680
Fuck that guy.

1362
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:02,490
Stop.

1363
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:04,230
Hey there.

1364
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,410
What brings a lumberjack arms?

1365
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:09,770
with an AK-47 to my doorstep.

1366
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:11,110
Wait, is this Mr. Beast?

1367
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:14,450
That's one way to chop down any unwanted visitors.

1368
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:15,890
Fuck, what does Mr. Beast like?

1369
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:24,820

We have to talk to you more?

1385
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,080
That's so easy.

1386
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,900
It's so easy to get into a content creator's house.

1387
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,960
It's actually pretty scary how easy that was.

1388
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:07,140
Okay.

1389
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,840

1390
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,340

1391
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,180

Easterboats together.

1395
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:30,040
Little did he know he was a feast all along.

1396
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,540
You never expect how this video ends.

1397
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,620
Oh my god, I can be Mr. East.

1398
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,580

You can't believe Mr. East.

Plus one.

1405
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,980
As a content creator, I knew the inside to a content
creator's heart.

1406
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,060
I knew what he wanted.

1407
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,040
And he wanted content.

1408
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,180
The East is slain.

1409
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,340

Elon Musk.

01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,320
It was Elon Zuck.

1471
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:44,160
Elon Zuck said that he would like to be in this video.

1472
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,840

01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,460
Someone will be in my...

1484
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,640

Look at this.

1493
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:40,400
If she doesn't understand the importance of Mr. East, then
she does not deserve to be eaten.

1494
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,640
Hello, Mr. East.

No thanks.

1506
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:05,740
I'll stick to my underground edgy scene.

1507
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:12,280
Okay, but Fallout Roy, this video is for the underground
edgy scene.

1508
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,020
We're making it different.

1509
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:19,240
Really?

1510
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:26,320
Well, if it's really going to be unique and truly a spirit
of the scene then maybe i'll consider it but don't expect me

1511
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:34,060
to sell my soul or compromise my artistic integrity okay

1513
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,560
artistic integrity

01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,960
Fuck, okay, I, um, you know what, Roy?

1515
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,460
Because I like your style.

1516
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,720
I'll even give you creative control.

1517
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,240
Wait, seriously?

1518
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:11,380
Creative control?

01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:13,540
That's like the dream, man!

1520
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,580
Alright, you've piqued my interest.

1521
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:20,660
I'll let you in, but only because you seem to understand the
importance of artistic freedom.

1522
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,700
Come on, what the fuck, it was that easy.

1523
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,280
Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy now.

1524
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,200
I'm in.

1525
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,760
This is so mainstream.

1526
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,140
Holy shit.

1527
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,260
That was actually the easiest.

1528
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:38,200
That's all it took.

1529
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,820
That's really...

1530
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:42,540
That's really all it took.

1531
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,520
I just went like, yeah.

1532
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,000
Artistic integrity.

1533
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:49,540
Was it really that easy?

1534
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,220
Apparently, all they care about is artistic integrity.

1535
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:57,860
I can't believe it.

1536
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,500
Don't get scammed.

1537
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,560
Oh my god.

1538
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:04,840
Influencers and artists.

Okay, let me...

01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,000
Now I look...

1543
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,800
I look fancy.

1544
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:20,950
Oh, it's a carrot.

1545
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:23,510
Oh my gosh, what fabulous surprise.

1546
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:26,330
Are you here to give me a sneak peek of the new spring
collection?

1547
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:27,790
Or maybe spill some...

1548
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:28,690
Oh no, I'm not.

1549
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:29,410
I don't want to talk.

1550
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:30,770
I already went through Regina.

1551
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:34,430
Because I don't want to go through another Regina.

1552
01:43:38,270 --> 01:43:40,290
I'm so done.

1553
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:40,870
Oh my god.

1554
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:41,790
Wait, that's my shirt.

1555
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,010
My shirt.

1556
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:44,790
There's no more tea.

1557
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:48,510
I'm so done with tea, guys.

1558
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:51,910
I've had enough fill of tea chat.

1559
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,130
Regina trauma.

1560
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:57,590
Hello?

1561
01:43:58,410 --> 01:43:59,270
Oh, shit.

1562
01:43:59,430 --> 01:43:59,930
Tommy.

1563
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:02,350
You're the most fabulous I've seen all day.

1564
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:04,870
How about we hit the town and strut your... Okay.

1565
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,150
Bro, are they all fashion people?

1566
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,270
Please!

1567
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:11,470
I don't want to deal with fashion.

1568
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:13,630
I'm so over it.

1569
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:16,990
I'm so fucking over fashion right now.

1570
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:18,930
I'm so done.

1571
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:21,970
I don't want to gossip anymore.

1572
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:23,530
Oh my god!

1573
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:27,890
A fellow enthusiast of scientific eccentric.

1574
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:29,410
Welcome, welcome.

1575
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:42,870
what brings you to my lair at this ungodly hour as a fellow
scientist I've heard about your research all the way from

1576
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:57,350
Canada Canada a splendid land of hockey and maple syrup I'm
delighted to hear that my research has reached such far

1577
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:57,950
reaches.

1578
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:03,150
Tell me, what exactly have you heard about my groundbreaking
work?

1579
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,010
Fuck, okay.

1580
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:05,510
What has he done?

1581
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,710
Does anyone know what pinky brains have done?

1582
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:09,830
Does anyone know?

1583
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:15,090
The jetpack!

1584
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:18,130
Obviously, the jetpack.

1585
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:22,290
No one has been able to successfully jetpacked ever.

1586
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:24,950
You are the first one, sir!

1587
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:29,960
The jetpack!

1588
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:30,980
Jetpack!

1589
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,860
A marvel of modern science indeed!

1590
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:40,820
But I must admit, my dear friend, the jetpack is just the
tip of the iceberg in my grand plat- What?

1591
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:48,700
How do you fucking do world domination with a fucking
jetpack?

1592
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,140
It's a jetpack.

1593
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,340
It's literally like you fly.

1594
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:56,160
You can't dominate anything with whatever.

1595
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,460
This scientist ain't so bright, actually.

1596
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:16,740
of course oh my god you know what you're right fuck the
world I just said that oh um it seems you're feeling rather

1597
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:26,890

world what

1598
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:35,610
he was good at dominating the world Give me the throw.

1599
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:36,910
You had him.

1600
01:46:37,170 --> 01:46:38,450
I blew it.

1601
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:41,010
I blew it.

1602
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:44,130
So, world domination?

1603
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,920
You caught into my grand ambition, I see.

1604
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,620
Yes, world domination is my ultimate goal.

1605
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:01,740
With my brilliant mind, impeccable sense of style, nothing
can stand in my way.

1606
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:02,900
Okay.

1607
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,580
Okay, okay, we're back here.

1608
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:11,280
I don't know why he didn't question why I just said world
domination, but that's okay.

1609
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,900
We're back in it We're back in it.

1610
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:16,820
He wants to dominate not this story.

1611
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:17,440
Okay.

1612
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:18,520
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1613
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:22,700
So world domination and chill

1614
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:28,250
How dare you mock my crap?

1615
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:28,870
What?

1616
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:35,010
Leave at once before I'd unleash my fashionable fear.

1617
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:36,550
What do you mean?

1618
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:46,730
I should never I don't know why you know this is your fault

World domination?

1622
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:20,550
A fellow mastermind with ambitions for world domination!

1623
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:27,230
I must say, your sense of style and choice of accessories do
intrigue me.

1624
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:32,030
Pray tell, what diabolical plans do you have in mind?

1625
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:38,510
Well, fellow earthling, my alien friends and I are
planning...

1626
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:40,450
on abducting the president

1627
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:53,380
how dare you suggest such a I will not be part of your
misguided attempt to disrupt world order leave at once what

01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:58,440
do you want your world domination what do you want

1629
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:11,840

01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:43,820
understand.

1633
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:46,140
It's all about the jet pack.

1634
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:56,640
My plans involve harnessing the power of mind control and
creating an army of loyal minions to carry out my bidding.

1635
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,000
How is that?

1636
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:01,300
How is that better than abducting the president?

1637
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,800
Like, how is that better?

1638
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,340
Shouldn't that be worse?

1639
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:09,140
Like...

1640
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,460
Okay, just say yes.

1641
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,140
All right.

1642
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,640
Excellent.

1643
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:26,720
Together we shall conquer the world with our genius and
scientific powers.

1644
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:31,060
But first, we must discuss the details of our master plan.

1645
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,540
Step inside my laboratory, my newfound Conrad.

1646
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:37,840
Yes.

1647
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:44,630
Very creepy.

1648

I'll officially welcome you to the rank of my loyal minions.

1649
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:53,330
Together, we shall unleash chaos and rule.

1650
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:56,310
And it was that easy.

1651
01:50:56,630 --> 01:50:59,690
All I have to say was yes.

1652
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:06,670
He just wanted the yes man.

1653
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:09,670
Oh my god.

Bell told me you're ugly in the beast form.

1664

How dare I have no time for your lies.

1665
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:15,390

And it's only Belle.

01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,420
Oh, merci, monsieur.

1705
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,980
Your words are as sweet as a French macaron.

1706
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,920
Do you dance the salsa as beautifully as you compliment,
perhaps?

1707
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:29,020
We, mademoiselle, would you care to have a dance with me?

Bro, she's... What the fuck?

01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:45,120
But Belle, Belle is willing to dance with me.

1712
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,860
She ain't so innocent as we thought she was.

Yes, of course, Mademoiselle!

1747
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:30,070
Let me sweep you off your feet.

always been such a smooth salsa dancer?

Um, fuck, okay.

But you, Belle, you inspire me to improve, mona me.

1754

journey.

My motivation is please stop.

1758
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:28,400
This feels like a job interview.

1759
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:29,480
Okay.

1760
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:31,460

with Miss with the beast If we have we can be together Okay

1778
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:27,050

Where she will break up with the beast Do you think we're at

1779
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:28,850
that stage Do you think

1780
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:33,110
No?

1781
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:36,370
Belle What do I say?

1782
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:37,990
too far?

1783
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:38,890
Not yet.

1784
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,070
What do I say, though?

1785
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:41,150
Too fast?

1786
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:49,050
Bell, do you feel the same way I do about you?

1787
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:56,710
Your question brings a cloud of doubt if O'Neill could be
completely sure.

1788
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:58,330
I need to be a moment.

1789
02:02:58,650 --> 02:02:59,250
No!

1790
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:02,810
No!

1791
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:15,270
And they have a hand.

1792
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:18,190
Bell, no!

1793
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:19,430
No!

1794
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,620
so close.

1795
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:27,460
Bell, please, break up with him.

1796
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:32,500
What's so just as delivery, driver?

1797
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:33,440
Okay.

1798
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:37,220
Manami, I have a package for you.

1799
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,600
Excuse me, moi?

1800
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,180
I do not recall any packages.

1801
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,460
I must bid you invest.

1802
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,880
But you had the plus!

1803
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,560
You had the plus!

1804
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:52,800
Oh my god.

1805
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,640
We were so close!

1806
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:56,980
We were so fucking close!

1807
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:00,320
Keep it simple and sure.

1808
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:01,880
It's a fumble!

1809
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:04,240
Bell, please!

1810
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:05,500
Leave him!

1811
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:09,360
Kill a surprise to see you here at the Valentine Park.

1812
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:10,400
Dress as a therapist.

1813
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,880
What secrets do you hope to recover, monomy?

1814
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:13,680
Okay.

1815
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,660
As your therapist, I wanted to ask you if you are okay.

1816
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:20,380
Okay.

1817
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:24,260
As your therapist, I wanted to ask you if you are okay.

1818
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:30,040
Oh, la, la.

1819
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,580
I'm touched by your concern, Missy, a therapist.

1820
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:34,260
I'm quite alright.

1821
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,140
Just a little bored with the lack of excitement in my life.

1822
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:40,140
Do you have any thrilling stories to share with you?

1823
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:42,540
No, okay.

1824
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:47,140
For, like, this breaks all confidentialities between patient
and therapist.

1825
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:53,120
And also, I'm pretty sure, like, it's very illegal for a
therapist to, like, try to date their patients, too.

1826
02:04:53,140 --> 02:05:10,110
so anyway um well i have an exciting story to tell you i
think i think i have a crush on one of my clients oh la la a

1827
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:19,050
forbidden love story between therapists and client quekel
intrigue tell me more about this mysterious amor that's

1828
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:31,630
captured your heart monsieur therapist the tea she wears a
she wears a crown and a beautiful white dress but she's

1829
02:05:31,630 --> 02:05:34,030
taken by another beast

1830
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:46,170
mandua this tale of unrequited love touches my heart have
you tried discussing your feelings with someone you trust

1831
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:53,610
monsieur monsieur therapist this is illegal

1832
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:58,530
It's yellow?

1833
02:05:58,890 --> 02:05:59,690
It's white!

1834
02:06:00,350 --> 02:06:01,210
What do you mean?

1835
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:02,710
It's the lighting.

1836
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:04,470
It's the lighting.

1837
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:06,190
Yes.

1838
02:06:06,850 --> 02:06:08,690
Yes, this is why I told you.

1839
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:10,970
I trust you a lot, Belle.

1840
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:16,370
Oh, la la.

1841
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:20,790
I am honored, but I must admit, I'm feeling tad flustered by
the weight of your feelings.

1842
02:06:21,170 --> 02:06:25,090
Perhaps we should focus on helping you navigate this
delicate situation first.

1843
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:27,850
Fuck, okay, okay, okay.

1844
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:32,810
What do you think I should do about this unrequited love?

1845
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:40,730
Perhaps expressing your feelings honestly.

1846
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:45,270
Yet respectfully could lead a resolution.

1847
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:46,570
Okay.

1848
02:06:48,650 --> 02:06:56,910
I'm so...

1849
02:06:58,190 --> 02:06:58,990
I don't

1850
02:07:04,850 --> 02:07:05,650
Okay, yes

1851
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:15,470
No It would not be time to have a catty With the object
you're finished And as for me, I realized that it might be

1852
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:23,610
time to write a letter of my own To my own beast No Wait,
that's come that my therapist has a crush On a client who is

1853
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:29,670
taken by another beast Making me realize it's time for me to
Go on my own, goodbye dear Oh, wait, that worked.

1854
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:30,890
That worked.

1855
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:32,610
I made her realize.

1856
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:33,370
I did.

1857
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:37,590
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

1858
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:39,030
I did it, though.

1859
02:07:39,990 --> 02:07:41,170
I did it.

1860
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:46,910
I just said yes.

1861
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:49,170
I just said yes.

1862
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:50,730
Oh, my God.

1863
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:56,670
Okay, as a question was saying, I'm not making me realize
it's time for me to go on my own adventure.

1864
02:07:57,210 --> 02:08:01,510
I know you're having a great time dancing, There's a letter.

1865
02:08:05,610 --> 02:08:09,850
He has some crush you have on Tal who is with another beast.

1866
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:14,370
I think it's not fair what she did to you.

1867
02:08:18,370 --> 02:08:21,650
And demand an explanation for her actions.

1868
02:08:22,730 --> 02:08:23,250
Is that it?

1869
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:25,050
Is that it?

1870
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:32,230
You've been so distant and cold lately, I can't take it
anymore.

1871
02:08:34,130 --> 02:08:36,670
Fell, I think it's not fair what she did to you.

1872
02:08:36,990 --> 02:08:39,250
But now, I think we should break up.

1873
02:08:39,530 --> 02:08:40,710
I can't do this anymore.

1874
02:08:41,690 --> 02:08:42,730
Break up?

1875
02:08:43,070 --> 02:08:43,430
Fine.

1876
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:46,190
I saw the way you were eyeing that enchanted teapot.

1877
02:08:46,690 --> 02:08:48,310
And don't think I didn't notice that.

1878
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:50,210
Oh, my God.

1879
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:54,110
I just want to thank them for the hard work.

1880
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:57,770
But now I think we should pour a teapot.

1881
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:03,250
Please, I am done with this.

1882
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:10,130
nonsense I don't want to be with someone who can't
appreciate a good fairy tale romance fine be that way I'll

1883
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:22,670

1885
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:36,550
Mrs. Potts.

1886
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:37,910
A teapot?

1887
02:09:39,150 --> 02:09:40,430
What the fuck?

1888
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:41,790
Yay.

1889
02:09:43,970 --> 02:09:45,710
No love for you.

1890
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:48,030
Look, he's dancing, though.

1891
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:50,410
He seems to be having a good time dancing.

1892
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:51,910
Are you okay?

1893
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:53,410
Are you okay, Beast?

1894
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:56,790
What did I just with this?

1895
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:57,850
I don't know.

1896
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:59,890
I should have just said yes earlier.

1897
02:10:00,070 --> 02:10:02,890
I feel like just saying yes just solves all my problem.

1898
02:10:07,110 --> 02:10:10,050
He's dancing his pain away.

1899
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:11,730
Oh my god.

1900
02:10:12,330 --> 02:10:15,190
I didn't realize all I had to do was say yes.

1901
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:16,110
That's all.

1902
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:18,830
I think that's a good way to call it.

1903
02:10:18,830 --> 02:10:20,450
I think that's a good way.

1904
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:26,820
Breaking up Beauty and the Beast.

1905
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:27,880
I did it.

1906
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:31,380
I will never trust the therapist anymore.

1907
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,600
Lou, thank you for the super chat.

1908
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:34,060
Thank you.

02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:34,840
Thank you.

1910
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:37,560
With the power of yes.

1911
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:40,200
That's really all it took, guys.

1912
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:42,480
Just keep saying yes.

1913
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,420
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1914
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:51,360
It's so much better than Twilight.

1915
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:53,340
Just yes.

1916
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:55,160
That was fun, though.

1917
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:57,420
That was really, really fun.

1918
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:58,260
I don't know.

1919
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,380
Oh my god.

1920
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:05,560
Holy shit.

1921
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:06,560
That was...

1922
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:19,460
Um, um, that was actually so fucking funny though, uh, um,
but that was, that was,

1923
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:35,260
I actually did not expect how fun it was to, to just mess
around with chat, like, to mess around with chat GPT slash

1924
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:47,940
AI and just like the type of conversations uh the type of
