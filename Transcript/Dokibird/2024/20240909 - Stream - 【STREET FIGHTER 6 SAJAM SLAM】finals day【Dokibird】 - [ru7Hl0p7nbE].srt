1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
It's like, I don't, I really don't know.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,500
I want you to just party.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,680
Get in your groove, party.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,820
If they start to counter you, then you play.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,720
Like, you know, it's more serious.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,600
That's it.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,080
Your party mode is too much for everyone to handle.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,580
You've been partying, it's been working.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,160
Let's keep the party going.

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,540
She could have done the...

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,620
She could have just been doing running grab the entire slam if she kept doing rank, though.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,040
No, that's not true.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,540
No, I would have.

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,200
No, what do you mean?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,260
Yeah, that's the one thing that's not working.

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,900
Every match, does she know?

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,840
Do they know?

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,060
And then she just runs at them.

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,420
Oh yeah, it's like a check.

20
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,300
But I think by now they might know.

21
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,380
I think they know now.

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,520
I think they all know.

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,840
If she didn't do dedicated stuff, she would have still been doing that.

24
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,480
Yeah.

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
I wish they would have stopped knowing.

26
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,740
What team is Serratina on?

27
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,700
The one that you were like...

28
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,040
Auto.

29
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,600
Automatic.

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Oh, okay.

31
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,120
Oh, that's the same as the Roy team.

32
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,600
That's Roy's team.

33
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,040
Yeah, that's your inner demon right there.

34
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,120
Yeah.

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,220
Your inner demon.

36
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,760
Yeah, I know.

37
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,200
Jamie is such a weird man.

38
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,400
What I do, like I was playing a bunch of Jamie's on rank two.

39
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah.

40
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,640
It's just like, they love to back up.

41
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,160
They love backing up.

42
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,060
They hardly crouch.

43
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,400
Yeah, they want to randomly drive rush in.

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,120
They back up to make space.

45
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
With that three hit punch, they drive rush in.

46
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,560
The heavy punch.

47
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,880
Yeah.

48
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,580
Or they back up fishing for the poke.

49
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,940
Or if that doesn't work, then they randomly drive rush in.

50
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,980
And if you don't approach, they just keep getting...

51
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,460
Drunk.

52
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,100
Yeah.

53
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,560
Yeah.

54
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,420
It's rough.

55
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:32,940
Yeah.

56
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
I bet that that matchup is kind of...

57
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, she's giving me player one.

58
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh, that's sick.

59
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,140
Ow.

60
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,720
Oh, she didn't...

61
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,580
Wait, she's still typing.

62
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh.

63
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,140
Oh.

64
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,480
Oh, okay.

65
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,740
I doubt Gumi is nice like that.

66
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,140
Oh, no.

67
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,300
Oh, damn it.

68
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,120
I got it.

69
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,360
I mean, she woke up and chose violence, bro.

70
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,700
All right, let's go.

71
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh, she's going in?

72
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,200
Okay, cool.

73
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,440
Cool.

74
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,220
All right, squad.

75
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,280
All right, let's do it.

76
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,640
Let's go, Doki.

77
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,140
It begins.

78
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,720
Oh, no.

79
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:57,920
No.

80
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
I really have to go to the back.

81
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm going.

82
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,220
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,600
Okay.

84
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,820
You got this.

85
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Oh, Doki.

86
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,880
Let's go.

87
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, no.

88
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,600
She's...

89
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,460
Okay.

90
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,840
Yep.

91
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,340
She's playing very passive.

92
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,560
She will.

93
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,480
But that's all right.

94
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,620
Nice.

95
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:23,900
Nice.

96
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Triangle.

97
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,380
Yep.

98
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,360
Nice.

99
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,720
Nice, Larry.

100
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,140
Oh.

101
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,680
Oh, I love the idea, though.

102
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,220
But you're good.

103
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,480
You're good.

104
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,840
Oh.

105
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,160
Nice.

106
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,440
Yes.

107
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,820
Oh.

108
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

109
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,020
Go, Doki.

110
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,400
Go.

111
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,300
Nice.

112
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,620
Good job.

113
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,420
Good job.

114
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,460
Yeah.

115
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,100
That was the feeler round.

116
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,820
You're feeling it out.

117
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,940
I think she was feeling me out, too.

118
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,100
Mm-hmm.

119
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,220
Like, she is, like...

120
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,720
She's kind of spooked.

121
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
She's playing super different.

122
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,100
She's scared, but...

123
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah.

124
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,740
But that's okay.

125
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,220
That's normal.

126
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,860
Oh.

127
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,320
Okay.

128
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,220
One of those is no problem.

129
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,560
Nice.

130
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
Keep approaching.

131
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,600
Yep.

132
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,660
Oh.

133
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,440
Nice.

134
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,740
Retaliation.

135
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,940
Okay.

136
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,980
Level three on the table.

137
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,900
Oh.

138
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,520
Keep walking towards her.

139
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,040
Walk and block.

140
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,060
That's fine.

141
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,620
Oh.

142
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,180
She's doing a lot of anti-airs, what I've noticed.

143
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,980
Mm-hmm.

144
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,320
Oh, no.

145
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:42,920
Nice jump.

146
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,280
Nice jump.

147
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,220
Oh, that's fine.

148
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,700
That's fine.

149
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,580
Nice.

150
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,380
That was sick.

151
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,780
That was sick.

152
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,400
Oh.

153
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,960
That's fine.

154
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,280
That's fine.

155
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,940
Good block.

156
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,960
Yeah.

157
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,540
There we go.

158
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:00,960
Okay.

159
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,980
Let's go.

160
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,260
That was so solid, Doki.

161
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,800
Nice block, Doki.

162
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,180
Doki.

163
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,780
Well played.

164
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,620
Nice.

165
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,320
That was clean.

166
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,660
And the neutral game was on point.

167
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,100
Yeah.

168
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,640
I love it.

169
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,760
She's so...

170
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,700
She's playing really, really different.

171
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,500
So I'm like not...

172
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:12,580
Yeah.

173
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,720
We trained for this.

174
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,060
You got it.

175
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,100
Yeah.

176
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,460
Oh.

177
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,840
Okay.

178
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,440
We take those.

179
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,800
Where are we at?

180
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,380
Oh, Doki won.

181
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,960
Let's go, baby.

182
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,920
Aw.

183
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,420
That's cool.

184
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:27,840
That's cool.

185
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,820
Okay.

186
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Yeah.

187
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,260
Okay.

188
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,100
Yeah.

189
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,600
Yeah.

190
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,260
Oh, I jumped that too.

191
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,710
Nice jump over.

192
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,910
Yeah.

193
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,390
Just keep walking towards her.

194
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,390
This is neutral.

195
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,710
Oops.

196
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,650
That was an accident.

197
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,250
She hit that first?

198
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:07,930
Oh.

199
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,730
Oh, no.

200
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:08,930
Yeah.

201
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,010
That was...

202
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,730
That was a low.

203
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,370
Good idea.

204
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:10,810
Good idea.

205
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,110
Yeah.

206
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,910
Just keep approaching her.

207
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,950
Make sure to keep moving forward.

208
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,650
And then you...

209
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,830
If you get closer, you can jump.

210
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,730
But just keep trying to bulldog your way closer.

211
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,850
Okay.

212
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,110
Yeah.

213
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,490
It...

214
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,710
She's going to move on wake up.

215
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,210
Okay.

216
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,310
Just block after she wakes up.

217
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,650
Yeah.

218
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,950
I understand now.

219
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,630
Yep.

220
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,790
Nice block.

221
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,550
Keep moving towards her.

222
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,890
Nice block.

223
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,010
Nice block.

224
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,880
Nice.

225
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,460
Nice.

226
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:46,860
Nice.

227
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,100
Nice.

228
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,160
Three.

229
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,900
Oh.

230
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,080
Save that meter.

231
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,960
Yeah, on us.

232
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,660
Yeah.

233
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,160
Watch your meter.

234
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,710
Okay.

235
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,350
You're still in it.

236
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,230
Nice.

237
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,570
One more.

238
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,800
Is he jump?

239
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh.

240
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,940
That thing.

241
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,620
That's fine.

242
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,340
You are still in it.

243
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,660
Guys, we are alive.

244
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:13,780
Guys, we are still in it.

245
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:13,880
We are alive.

246
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,300
Oh.

247
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,620
Nice.

248
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,300
That was great.

249
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,880
Unlucky.

250
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,100
Awww.

251
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,540
That's fine.

252
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,860
So Doki, you gotta make sure that you're not just walking back and forth from fullscreen.

253
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,260
You need to always be walking forward block.

254
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
You gotta get closer to her.

255
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,280
So even though she might threaten these random moves, while you're thinking about them and defending, you just gotta keep moving in to party.

256
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,900
And then just let her wake up here.

257
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,120
Okay.

258
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,980
There you go.

259
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,960
Her little fullscreen moves do way less damage than one of your grabs, so don't sweat it if you get hit by them.

260
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,700
Yeah, just keep bulldogging your way in.

261
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
Walk and block and get in.

262
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,840
There you go.

263
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,260
It's fine.

264
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,980
Just do it again.

265
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,280
Nice.

266
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,920
There you go.

267
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,040
You gotta save your meter.

268
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,640
That's fine.

269
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,560
Nice!

270
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,680
Nice throw.

271
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,960
Okay.

272
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,900
Let's go!

273
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,580
See?

274
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,760
Yeah, just keep approaching.

275
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,740
Don't be scared to keep walking towards her.

276
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,820
Oh my goodness.

277
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,540
Let's go.

278
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,060
Okay.

279
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,580
Okay, just watch your meter for a little while.

280
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,190
Nice.

281
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,190
Aww.

282
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,430
I have a feeling she's gonna do that too.

283
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:53,850
No worries.

284
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,330
No worries.

285
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,190
Keep walking towards her.

286
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:55,550
Nice.

287
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:55,930
Yep.

288
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,850
Keep walking towards her.

289
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,070
Nice.

290
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,690
Did she hit me first?

291
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,150
No.

292
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,030
You got her.

293
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,910
Aww.

294
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,870
Oh, too close.

295
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,630
I'm terrified.

296
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,590
Doki, level three on the table.

297
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,530
You got level three?

298
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,730
You got it.

299
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:08,910
Mm-hmm.

300
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,470
You got it, Doki.

301
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,030
Let's go.

302
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,910
Just keep doing what you're doing.

303
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,130
Wait.

304
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,350
No!

305
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,230
Oh, no!

306
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,890
That was an accident!

307
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,510
It's fine.

308
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,830
It's fine.

309
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,130
It's fine.

310
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,830
It's fine.

311
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,390
That wasn't even...

312
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,610
I didn't mean to press that.

313
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,010
Just chill.

314
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,810
That was so unlucky.

315
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,930
I, like, back-fingered it too.

316
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,530
No, you're in the game.

317
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:33,990
It's done.

318
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:37,890
Nice.

319
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,150
Good.

320
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,950
Nice.

321
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,350
Nice.

322
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,550
Wow.

323
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,170
Get in there.

324
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:44,730
Nice.

325
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,550
One more, Doki.

326
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,170
One more.

327
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,630
She's scared.

328
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,030
One more.

329
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,110
That's fine.

330
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,650
You're good.

331
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:53,790
Wait.

332
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,350
Does that kill me?

333
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:54,590
No.

334
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,050
Oh, maybe.

335
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,650
It's close.

336
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,350
Actually, it might.

337
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,770
It's close.

338
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,770
I mean, it kills me.

339
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,610
It's close.

340
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,070
Just focus.

341
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,870
Okay.

342
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,690
Oh, okay.

343
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,010
Focus.

344
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,630
No!

345
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,090
I jumped!

346
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,170
I jumped, too.

347
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,510
Nice try.

348
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,950
Nice try.

349
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,110
Nice try.

350
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,010
It was, like, down to the wire.

351
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,330
Yeah.

352
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,290
Down to the wire.

353
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,490
I even pressed jump.

354
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:15,890
Yeah.

355
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,190
I saw it either way.

356
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,570
Good try.

357
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,210
Good try, Doki.

358
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:19,790
That was a good fight.

359
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,090
I enjoyed that thoroughly.

360
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,550
Great fight.

361
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,730
I enjoyed that.

362
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,530
I didn't fat finger my level three.

363
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,490
That was, like, yeah.

364
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:27,890
Yeah.

365
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,990
All right.

366
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,950
Because I pressed lariat, and then it hit my level three for some reason.

367
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,250
All right.

368
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,850
Let's do this.

369
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,270
All right, SK.

370
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,310
Let's do this.

371
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,850
Let's game.

372
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,170
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

373
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,710
Confidence.

374
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,350
Have confidence.

375
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,550
Okay.

376
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,250
I never get nervous in Overwatch.

377
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,890
So weird.

378
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,130
So weird.

379
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,710
So weird.

380
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,130
Because you have four other people on the squad, maybe.

381
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,110
I don't know.

382
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,250
Yeah, probably.

383
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,330
All right, SK.

384
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,190
Let's play a game.

385
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,290
And 15,000 hours.

386
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,930
Play your game.

387
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,490
Just do your best.

388
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,730
Whatever happens.

389
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,670
Like, I mean, we still love you, right?

390
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,390
It doesn't matter.

391
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:10,690
Yeah.

392
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,390
Hell yeah.

393
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,010
Play your game.

394
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,690
Let's go, SK.

395
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,730
Oh,

396
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,280
nice.

397
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,150
Uh -oh.

398
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,830
It's fine.

399
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,110
It's fine.

400
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,810
Just chill.

401
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,020
Yeah.

402
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,300
Just gotta chill.

403
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,610
Nice grab.

404
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,260
Nice.

405
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,570
There we go.

406
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,990
Good offense.

407
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,750
Oh, nice offense.

408
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,150
Yeah.

409
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,720
Yeah.

410
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,040
He just...

411
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,100
He randomly DI's always.

412
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,740
Oh.

413
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,260
It's okay.

414
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,300
Hey.

415
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,540
Hey.

416
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,660
Yeah.

417
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,540
Just block it out.

418
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,220
Yeah.

419
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,120
That's fine.

420
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,960
Block.

421
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,580
Nice block.

422
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,540
Punish.

423
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh.

424
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Okay.

425
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,000
That's good.

426
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,440
That's good.

427
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,560
We're good.

428
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,460
Yeah.

429
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,180
If you block that, you can dash up punish.

430
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,760
But you're good.

431
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,520
You're playing great.

432
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:00,860
Gotcha.

433
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,760
Nice combo.

434
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,620
Yep.

435
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,360
All right.

436
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,040
That's fine.

437
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,120
Yeah.

438
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,960
We block and wake up.

439
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,220
Where you going?

440
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,780
Yeah.

441
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,460
Take this.

442
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,240
Yeah.

443
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,180
Good punish.

444
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,520
Nice punish.

445
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,080
Nice.

446
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,480
Nice.

447
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,380
Ooh.

448
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,260
That was a good idea.

449
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,820
What?

450
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,000
A stare down.

451
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,560
Yeah.

452
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,720
That was funny.

453
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,640
Nice.

454
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,160
No.

455
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,180
Aw.

456
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,640
That's close.

457
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,740
That's cool.

458
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:49,980
That's cool.

459
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,220
Remember.

460
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah.

461
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,960
You know how to play against him.

462
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,040
He just mashes DI.

463
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,280
And now...

464
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,420
And when he's cornered, he'll DP.

465
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,380
I feel like you can bait it out.

466
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,000
At least once.

467
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,360
Oh, yeah.

468
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,740
Okay.

469
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,520
Nice.

470
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,200
Nice.

471
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,240
Yeah.

472
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,700
Don't...

473
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,440
What's...

474
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,340
You got it.

475
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,860
Okay.

476
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,040
Okay.

477
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,120
Okay.

478
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,480
Okay.

479
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:36,940
He keeps throwing.

480
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,060
And you never...

481
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,940
Ow.

482
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,520
He just...

483
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,000
He never presses anything.

484
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,540
Yeah.

485
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:41,880
Just...

486
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,680
Just medium...

487
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,480
Just do medium punch.

488
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,460
Medium punch is the answer.

489
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:44,940
Just...

490
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,220
You know.

491
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
Do your medium punch pressure like we've drilled.

492
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,560
Don't worry about anything else.

493
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,620
That's...

494
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:50,920
Okay.

495
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,880
It's okay if you use a DP.

496
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,180
Okay.

497
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,620
What the heck?

498
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,120
Whoop.

499
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,320
Whoop.

500
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,120
There you go.

501
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,860
Get in there.

502
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,920
Good pressure.

503
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,420
Yeah.

504
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

505
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,540
Nice.

506
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,200
Lock him down.

507
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,560
Nice.

508
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,260
Nice throw.

509
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,180
Nice.

510
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,580
Careful with the DPs.

511
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,520
There you go.

512
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,500
Nice.

513
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,860
Nice block.

514
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,120
Yeah.

515
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,640
Oh.

516
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:19,980
Oh.

517
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,740
You almost had this.

518
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,520
Such a sick combo.

519
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,560
There you go.

520
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,840
Nice combo.

521
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,460
Oh, yeah.

522
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,340
That's what I'm talking about there.

523
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,360
Remember.

524
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,080
He's just mashing.

525
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,120
Just do medium punch.

526
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,960
That's your default.

527
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,640
Oh.

528
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,080
Nice.

529
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,480
Nice.

530
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,140
Nice combo.

531
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh.

532
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:47,740
Oh.

533
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,560
You're in the combo.

534
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,660
So just...

535
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,100
Don't get too close to him.

536
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,680
Just don't get yourself in the corner.

537
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,220
Yeah.

538
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,500
And don't press big buttons.

539
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,140
Just play defense a little bit.

540
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,940
Okay.

541
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,160
Yeah.

542
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,600
Nice block.

543
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,100
Jump away.

544
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,920
Get to mid screen.

545
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,480
Yeah.

546
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,100
You're good.

547
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,840
Now you're good.

548
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,280
Nice.

549
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,320
Nice.

550
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,120
Good defense.

551
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,500
Nice.

552
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,740
Oh.

553
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,120
That's a good jump.

554
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,960
Nice.

555
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,000
Nice.

556
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,380
That's crazy.

557
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,260
It's all right.

558
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,600
Oh.

559
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,940
He's nervous.

560
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,900
Yeah.

561
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,640
Nice move.

562
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,220
Nice throw.

563
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,400
Nice.

564
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,380
There you go SK.

565
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,700
Oh.

566
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:22,780
Nice prediction.

567
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,860
Oh.

568
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,240
Okay.

569
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:25,960
That's fine.

570
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,460
That's fine.

571
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,080
We take those.

572
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,060
We take those.

573
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,260
I can't watch this.

574
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,360
I can't believe you're doing optimal jury stuff.

575
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,980
That's sick.

576
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,540
Yeah.

577
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,900
You're capitalizing.

578
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,580
You're optimal.

579
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,400
Holy shit.

580
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,080
All right.

581
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,340
Nice.

582
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,720
Nice.

583
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,600
Here we go.

584
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,020
One more.

585
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,260
One more.

586
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh.

587
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,940
That block.

588
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,140
Nice.

589
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,020
Crazy block.

590
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,440
You're doing jury stuff.

591
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,960
I love it.

592
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,060
I love it.

593
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,360
I love it.

594
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,380
Oh.

595
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:50,960
Missed input.

596
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,640
It's fine.

597
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,080
Yeah.

598
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,400
It doesn't matter.

599
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,040
You got my ropes.

600
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,680
Oh.

601
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,380
Oh.

602
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,820
Oh.

603
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,900
Oh.

604
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,120
Oh.

605
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,200
Oh.

606
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,460
Oh.

607
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:02,660
Oh.

608
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,560
That's insane.

609
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,400
You're better at the game.

610
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,860
Get him.

611
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,660
Get him.

612
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,200
One more.

613
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,360
That's fine.

614
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,040
Eating a DP.

615
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,460
Let's go.

616
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,900
Let's fucking go.

617
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,760
Just keep playing your game.

618
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,720
Yes.

619
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,300
Holy.

620
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,680
You're out.

621
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:17,760
Oh.

622
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,740
You're locked in.

623
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Yes.

624
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,300
You're so different.

625
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,700
Yes.

626
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,460
He's scared.

627
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,500
Wait.

628
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:24,640
Wait.

629
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:24,800
Wait.

630
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,340
Can't do anything.

631
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,580
Nice break.

632
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:26,820
Take it easy.

633
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,860
No.

634
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,200
I love the control.

635
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,100
Woo.

636
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay.

637
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
You tried to do some crazy stuff.

638
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,480
Just chill.

639
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:34,900
Just chill.

640
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,400
Just chill.

641
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,960
Keep the corner.

642
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,140
Yep.

643
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,060
That's your corner.

644
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,260
Oh.

645
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,180
That's still your corner.

646
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,500
Oh my God.

647
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,540
You're a psych raid.

648
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,680
Oh.

649
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,640
That's fine.

650
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,540
Just chill.

651
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:47,980
Oh.

652
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,620
Do it.

653
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,140
Oh.

654
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,860
Oh.

655
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,640
Please tell me you got him.

656
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,120
Yes.

657
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,420
Yes.

658
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,840
Let's go.

659
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,300
Yeah.

660
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,880
Let's go.

661
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:54,920
Yes.

662
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,160
Let's go.

663
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Yes.

664
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:56,680
Yes.

665
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,180
Yes.

666
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,300
Yes.

667
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:58,940
Yes.

668
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,100
Yes.

669
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,140
Yes.

670
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,280
Yes.

671
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,760
You're so good.

672
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,980
You just proved it.

673
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,320
That practice was worth it.

674
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,160
That was ridiculous.

675
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,200
That was the plan you executed.

676
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,700
The training paid off.

677
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,100
That's all you gotta do.

678
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,580
The training did pay off.

679
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,080
Let's go.

680
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,180
Oh my God.

681
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,660
Okay, bravo.

682
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,620
Redeem me.

683
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,160
Hell yes.

684
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,760
Redeem my games.

685
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,900
You got this amigo.

686
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,480
I believe.

687
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,000
I believe in you.

688
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,660
I would try.

689
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,640
You got this.

690
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,940
I'll play my best.

691
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,000
You got this.

692
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,480
I believe.

693
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,420
I believe.

694
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,660
We've been in worse situations before, I promise.

695
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,020
No, SK has me hyped.

696
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,820
That was some crazy jury gameplay.

697
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,120
That cash-out combo.

698
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,200
Yeah, man.

699
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,840
That cash-out combo.

700
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,260
I was not... Nah, dude.

701
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,140
You freaking did that perfectly, dude.

702
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,920
Oh, man.

703
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,840
Let's go.

704
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,520
Let's go.

705
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,260
Absolutely amazing.

706
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,900
That was sick.

707
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,580
You played your game.

708
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,200
That's the thing.

709
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,460
See?

710
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,940
Yes.

711
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,980
You've been doing that.

712
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,300
You've been looping that same offensive sequence.

713
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,000
Just do it.

714
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,140
These players are not blocking.

715
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,280
They can't handle the pressure.

716
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,080
You got it.

717
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,880
Yeah.

718
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,420
Hell yes.

719
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Hell yes.

720
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,580
Shaking, man.

721
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,620
Where is he, man?

722
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,740
Where is he?

723
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,840
Where did he... He's getting, like, training.

724
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,000
Last-minute training.

725
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,400
Steamroll.

726
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,340
If you remember, this is S-Fan.

727
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,020
He plays a little weird.

728
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,700
He's a little jumpy.

729
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,900
But once you get in, just cage him.

730
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,800
Yeah.

731
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,980
Don't go to over-commit to grabs or whatever.

732
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,760
He's a jumpy motherfucker.

733
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,640
Did I get mentioned somewhere on the stage?

734
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,820
No.

735
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,020
They tagged S-Fan.

736
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,120
They're waiting for him to show up.

737
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,520
Is it Crawl Pro?

738
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,440
Crawl Pro!

739
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,820
Crawl Pro!

740
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,380
Crawl Pro!

741
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,080
That's an act of aggression.

742
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,380
I don't get it.

743
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,220
Can someone explain?

744
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,840
I don't even know what that means.

745
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,800
All I know is that you're living in his brain.

746
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,040
I think he's going to kick you until you're crawling.

747
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,720
Yeah, he's going to break your knees and then you're forced to crawl.

748
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,560
Crawl Pro, dude.

749
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,360
I don't... Okay.

750
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,980
I guess.

751
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,200
He, like, played against PDX and he renamed himself FeedDX.

752
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,180
Listen, all I know is that you're living in his brain rent-free.

753
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,580
Yeah.

754
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,820
Get him, dude.

755
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,660
Get him, brother.

756
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,140
Okay.

757
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,820
Let's not do that.

758
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,620
Yeah.

759
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,360
He's a jumper.

760
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,260
So, yeah.

761
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,920
There we go.

762
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
It's easy for you.

763
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,320
It's easy.

764
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,860
I believe.

765
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,280
I believe.

766
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,900
I believe.

767
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,400
That was almost...

768
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,300
That's a sick callout.

769
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,260
Nice job, MK.

770
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:32,980
Callout!

771
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,600
Let's go!

772
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:33,960
Oh, damn.

773
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,520
Oh, that was unlucky.

774
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,080
Resets!

775
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,840
Oh, that's so bad for me.

776
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,160
No worries.

777
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,620
We call that an American reset.

778
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,240
Brother, that move is not good.

779
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,620
Okay, you got this still.

780
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,280
Oh, okay.

781
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,020
You're tired.

782
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,640
You're EP.

783
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,880
Oh, you know he's gonna give it to you.

784
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,640
He knows I'm looking for him.

785
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,400
It don't matter.

786
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,940
That jackhammer is not good.

787
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,800
He's not doing anything.

788
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,380
Why isn't he doing it?

789
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,440
Yeah, do it!

790
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,140
Do it!

791
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,320
Spin your fireball!

792
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,200
He knows.

793
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,700
He doesn't want to get jackhammered again.

794
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,880
The last time it happened twice.

795
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,220
They were like, wait, when did you get level two again?

796
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,880
That happened last time.

797
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,030
There we go.

798
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,270
Oh!

799
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,190
Oh, that would have been sick, though.

800
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,430
Yeah.

801
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:28,890
Oh!

802
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,570
Oh, the second carry!

803
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,270
Yes!

804
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,210
That perfect parry.

805
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,910
I love keeping it tight.

806
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,450
Yes.

807
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,710
Yes.

808
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,190
Nice.

809
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,750
Nice.

810
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,090
And tires.

811
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,330
Good defense.

812
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,170
Yep.

813
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,650
Nice!

814
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,530
Nice.

815
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,270
Yeah, he can't be doing that against Gief.

816
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,390
I like that.

817
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,730
Nice grab.

818
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,290
Turn your chill.

819
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:55,670
That's okay.

820
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:55,970
All right.

821
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,270
Nice get up.

822
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,470
Yeah.

823
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,950
Nice!

824
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,690
Almost had it.

825
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,850
That's close.

826
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,230
That's close.

827
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,570
He's still got more health than him.

828
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,290
Yeah.

829
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:02,930
Yeah.

830
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,090
You just need one hit.

831
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,450
Yeah.

832
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,170
Is that going to work?

833
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,390
Oh!

834
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,790
Oh!

835
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,710
Oh!

836
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,850
Oh!

837
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:10,870
Oh!

838
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,890
That's okay, man.

839
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,750
Just...

840
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,110
Yeah.

841
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:13,410
Okay.

842
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,230
Don't spend your resources.

843
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:14,990
Just chill.

844
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,890
You're good, brother.

845
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,230
Yeah.

846
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,310
No need to be fancy.

847
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,150
Nice.

848
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,790
Nice.

849
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,410
Here I come.

850
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,230
Oh!

851
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:27,930
Yes!

852
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,850
Make him scared.

853
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,450
Make him scared.

854
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,810
Play some mind games with him.

855
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:31,570
Oh!

856
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:32,930
Oh!

857
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,590
Oh!

858
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,550
He's like, you're level one.

859
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,570
I don't need to throw fire.

860
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,770
I can throw all the fireballs.

861
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:38,890
Nice!

862
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,050
Get home!

863
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:41,890
Oh!

864
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,550
Okay.

865
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,390
That's close.

866
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:43,670
Yeah.

867
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,750
We got new combos now.

868
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,270
Let's go.

869
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:45,510
Holy shit.

870
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,450
Oh, yeah.

871
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:46,990
It's critical.

872
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,230
Wow.

873
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,610
That comes from so far.

874
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:53,670
Nice!

875
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,170
Nice kill!

876
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:54,690
We'll take that trade.

877
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,430
Yeah.

878
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,050
Just tap it in.

879
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,850
A jab or something.

880
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,130
Jab is really good with Gief, too.

881
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,710
To close out matches.

882
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:02,930
Yeah.

883
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,930
Oh, my goodness.

884
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,550
Big combo.

885
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:04,910
Oh!

886
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:05,690
Oh!

887
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,290
There we go.

888
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,730
Yes, sir.

889
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,590
Oh, he's scared.

890
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,190
He's scared.

891
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,950
Another combo.

892
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,310
He's scared.

893
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:12,730
I love it.

894
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,530
I love it.

895
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,090
I love it.

896
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,770
I love it.

897
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,050
We'll take it.

898
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,490
We'll take those.

899
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,290
The game just ended.

900
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,710
Okay.

901
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,910
The game just ended.

902
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,430
All right.

903
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,290
We'll take those pro.

904
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,510
Your offense is leveled up.

905
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,990
You're not like going in too close or keeping corner because these motherfuckers are jumping and mashing.

906
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,750
So that spot you held, just like let them have a little bit of range in the corner and then just punish them for trying to wiggle out.

907
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,650
That's so good.

908
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,370
Yeah.

909
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,610
Let's go.

910
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,010
Let's clean, dude.

911
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:37,950
Clean.

912
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,390
That looks good for everyone else, too.

913
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:39,510
Brawl pro.

914
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,250
We have no match for brawl pro.

915
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,590
Let's do this.

916
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,590
All right.

917
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,770
Play your game, man.

918
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:43,970
Let me lock in here.

919
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,210
Let's go.

920
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,590
Do your best, Cole.

921
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,070
We believe.

922
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,890
We believe, Cole.

923
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,030
Play your game.

924
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,610
Let's do it.

925
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,050
I love hearing Brian say these motherfuckers that he just said out of character or something.

926
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,010
I'm very nice one-on-one.

927
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,490
But to hype up my team, everyone else is fucking trash.

928
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,670
Just remember that.

929
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:07,970
Yup.

930
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,430
Yup.

931
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,110
Let's go.

932
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,090
Dad cursing.

933
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,350
Dad cursing.

934
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:11,870
My bad.

935
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,250
My bad.

936
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:19,870
Nice.

937
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,790
Oh.

938
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,510
Nice grab.

939
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:23,970
Yes, sir.

940
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,770
Oh, nice.

941
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,170
You got this.

942
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,410
His MR is lower than mine.

943
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:26,570
Choke him.

944
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,870
You got this.

945
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,230
Now he's...

946
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,490
That's all he's going to think about now.

947
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,370
He's like, oh, I hope he does that again.

948
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,470
Nice jump out.

949
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,010
Yes, sir.

950
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,810
You know the defense.

951
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,330
What a challenge.

952
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:45,930
Nice.

953
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:46,910
Nice grab.

954
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,290
Nice.

955
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:47,710
Yes, sir.

956
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,030
One more.

957
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,930
Yes, sir.

958
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,710
Oh, that's not a grab.

959
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,510
Let's go, Cole.

960
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,370
Play your game.

961
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,870
Play your game.

962
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:53,230
That's not a grab.

963
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,050
Throw a loop to master player?

964
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,650
Let's do this.

965
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,510
Yeah.

966
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,550
That's embarrassing for him.

967
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,390
Live on stream.

968
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,530
On the Sage Jam Slam stream, too.

969
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,330
Look.

970
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,890
We all get throw a loops on that.

971
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,210
Okay.

972
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:10,890
Okay.

973
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,390
I got throw a loop like 30 times on stream.

974
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,730
That's why it's funny.

975
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,690
Doki says that.

976
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,190
Is that just a master player?

977
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,130
They all get throw a loop.

978
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:21,810
Yeah.

979
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,990
It doesn't matter who you are.

980
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,920
Nice escape.

981
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,140
What a fucking sick escape there.

982
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,540
Yes, sir.

983
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,460
Oh, my God.

984
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,580
He's so locked in right now.

985
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
Nice and easy.

986
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,100
I love it.

987
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,980
Good, Oki.

988
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,740
Okay.

989
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,200
Sweet.

990
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,660
Good, Oki.

991
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:43,840
Cole.

992
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,220
One more.

993
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,440
Let's go.

994
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,800
Oh, my God.

995
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:44,940
He's so locked in right now.

996
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
Cole actually learned how to use the super.

997
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,800
I learned how to use my super.

998
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,100
Yes.

999
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,920
That is what you practice all night.

1000
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,360
Yesterday, I...

1001
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,420
Let's go.

1002
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:56,440
That was great.

1003
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,980
After Cole won, he started twerking on stream.

1004
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,480
I'm like, what?

1005
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,900
They got me off guard.

1006
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,560
Yeah.

1007
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
We can't open a stream after this.

1008
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,780
Oh, he's adapting.

1009
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,900
That's okay.

1010
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,360
Oh, he's not.

1011
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,980
He's just capping.

1012
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,620
No, he's not.

1013
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,700
He's just dead.

1014
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,260
What?

1015
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,920
That's okay.

1016
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,100
It's fine.

1017
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,860
See your mid screen.

1018
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,260
Let's go.

1019
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,220
Yeah.

1020
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,460
He did what we wanted him to do.

1021
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,260
Yup.

1022
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,220
Oh!

1023
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,240
I've never seen that throw before.

1024
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,100
Nice.

1025
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,420
And his drive meter is low.

1026
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,960
It's fine.

1027
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,400
I don't like this Ken skin.

1028
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,700
I don't like it either.

1029
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,240
It's all good.

1030
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,660
It's all good.

1031
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,320
This doesn't look like him.

1032
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,920
Oh, my God.

1033
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,830
Oh, nice grab!

1034
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,650
Oh my gosh.

1035
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,970
Oh, the grab is insane.

1036
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,560
It's all good.

1037
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,040
It's all good.

1038
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,720
It's not going to do too much.

1039
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
If you hit him, you got level three.

1040
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,620
Is that a kill?

1041
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,620
That's close, that's close.

1042
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,020
You know, play your game.

1043
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,980
Just don't jump when you're near the corner.

1044
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,480
If you're kind of like jumping into the corner, that's it.

1045
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,760
Everything else is great.

1046
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,080
You got this.

1047
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,080
You're better.

1048
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,820
Nice serve!

1049
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,260
That's fine.

1050
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,940
It's wasting all the bar.

1051
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,420
Yeah, he was mashing.

1052
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,150
There we go.

1053
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,190
You're back in the game.

1054
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,210
Oh, nice.

1055
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,930
Nice defense.

1056
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,270
Oh, another throw.

1057
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,790
There we go, Ko.

1058
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,990
That's a jelly, some burnout.

1059
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,210
Nothing to worry about.

1060
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,670
What?

1061
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,110
It's okay.

1062
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,950
Don't worry, you live this.

1063
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,500
Yes, sir.

1064
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:44,940
Hit him.

1065
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,780
You got to do the heavy.

1066
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,300
Okay, it's chill.

1067
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
Probably got an OD fireball, so be careful.

1068
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,920
Let's go, let's go.

1069
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,940
That was so close.

1070
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,500
I'll take it, I'll take it.

1071
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,560
There we go.

1072
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,200
That's the offense.

1073
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,020
That's the offense.

1074
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,520
Nice.

1075
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,760
Let's fucking go.

1076
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,220
It's Ko.

1077
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,600
There we go.

1078
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,180
That's fine.

1079
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,140
He's nervous now.

1080
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,260
We're flowing, we're flowing.

1081
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,200
That's our Latino diaphone.

1082
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,820
Yep.

1083
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,220
Be confident.

1084
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:17,760
Let's go.

1085
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,820
Nice.

1086
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,040
One more.

1087
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,640
Yes, sir.

1088
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,240
Is that it?

1089
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,180
That's it.

1090
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,120
One more, one more.

1091
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,880
That's okay.

1092
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,140
Nice defense, man.

1093
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,840
All right.

1094
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,260
We're good.

1095
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,140
Let's go.

1096
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,860
Oh, my God.

1097
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,200
All right.

1098
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,720
No coaches match.

1099
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,580
Let's fucking go.

1100
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,720
No coaches match.

1101
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,480
We move on.

1102
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,460
Let's fucking go.

1103
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,360
If you guys are confident, you're going to fucking smoke them.

1104
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,100
You're better than everyone in your team.

1105
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,340
It's so clear as day.

1106
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,100
We got the one match out of the way.

1107
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,680
We're set.

1108
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,380
Guys, I think like...

1109
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,800
All right.

1110
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,460
I think I realize I need to stop thinking.

1111
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,520
I need you guys to help me not think.

1112
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,640
Don't think.

1113
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,940
If I think, I lose.

1114
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,540
I need to not think.

1115
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:14,960
Just play your game.

1116
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,680
I need you guys to fill up the discussion.

1117
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,980
Talk about random stuff.

1118
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,880
Talk about random stuff.

1119
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,500
Yeah, yeah.

1120
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,960
If I start thinking, I start thinking too much and then I don't know how to play.

1121
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,260
Damn.

1122
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,120
Not that GG's Cosmo, I'm a big fan.

1123
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,200
I know.

1124
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,740
I love his videos.

1125
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,700
Toxic.

1126
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
I love his videos.

1127
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,860
I thought that was Doki's job.

1128
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,800
Oh, don't worry, I'll say that too.

1129
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,720
GG's doesn't matter if I lost.

1130
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,680
The GG's that was me is the number one thing in the fighting game world.

1131
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,360
You have to have the patience of a saint.

1132
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
GG's that was me.

1133
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,520
That is an everyday occurrence.

1134
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440
GG's that was sandbagging.

1135
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,660
GG's that was sandbagging.

1136
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,760
You've got to be kidding me.

1137
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,900
Oh man.

1138
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,920
GG's that was sandbagging.

1139
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,020
Dear God.

1140
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,480
Alright.

1141
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,600
Good shit team.

1142
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,240
That was awesome.

1143
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,480
Everyone's playing super good.

1144
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,360
I'm playing against Bison next.

1145
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,520
Yes.

1146
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,040
The only thing to worry about Doki is anti-airing and then partying.

1147
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,140
Cool.

1148
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,420
Jump triangle when she jumps and that's about it.

1149
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,980
Okay.

1150
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,640
You got this.

1151
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,040
And down triangle as well, the lariat.

1152
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,440
And you're good to go.

1153
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,860
Do you need water?

1154
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,340
I'll be right back.

1155
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,980
Are we doing it instantly or are we waiting?

1156
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,720
I don't know actually.

1157
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,700
They kind of tend to move us pretty quick.

1158
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,960
Well, he said that they'll all be on stream now though.

1159
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,960
Well, he said that they'll all be on stream now though.

1160
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,060
Oh yeah.

1161
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,240
Okay, so the next matchup is auto one dare matchup.

1162
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,320
Okay, so the next matchup is auto one dare matchup.

1163
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,640
I think.

1164
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,600
I'll double check.

1165
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,760
I think.

1166
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,900
I'll double check.

1167
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,360
So we got who we knew we were going to fight.

1168
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,140
Yeah, Aldo's going to fight Nephew's team.

1169
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,720
So Brawl Pro, do you want to play some JP real quick?

1170
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,980
Yeah, yeah.

1171
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,800
Yeah?

1172
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,100
For sure.

1173
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:07,920
Okay.

1174
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,400
Alright, let's do that.

1175
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,380
I don't know what her cheese is.

1176
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
What she does specifically though.

1177
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,080
She does fireball into portal.

1178
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,260
Okay.

1179
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,200
That is.

1180
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,560
And then she does a bunch of zoning.

1181
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,260
So...

1182
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,500
That's about it.

1183
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,620
I'm surprised Aldo won their matchup.

1184
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,880
Because Dia was winning their overall matchups in the first few days.

1185
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,700
Hey, did they stream that just now?

1186
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,580
No, they didn't.

1187
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,000
Auto matches were not streamed on the main stream.

1188
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,220
Oh, okay.

1189
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,340
It was...

1190
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,740
So, who won so far?

1191
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,160
What's the bracket looking like?

1192
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,520
It's Aldo versus Nephew.

1193
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,940
Oh, they did stream us.

1194
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,080
Yeah, they streamed us.

1195
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,600
But they didn't stream the other team.

1196
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,140
Gotcha.

1197
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,880
Okay.

1198
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,580
Guys, chat.

1199
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,700
I'm making a custom room.

1200
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
I need practice.

1201
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,260
Bison only.

1202
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,920
If you're not Bison, I'm kicking you out.

1203
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,680
Yeah, there you go.

1204
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,460
Modern Bison.

1205
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,620
If you play classic Bison, I'm plugging.

1206
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,840
Damn, dude.

1207
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,460
No, because I had a custom room where it was classic Bison.

1208
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,080
And all they did was doing the slide attack on me.

1209
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,420
And I was like, that doesn't exist in Modern Bison.

1210
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,140
You're giving me bad habits.

1211
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,940
Like, now I'm going to be blocking slides when she can't even do slides.

1212
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:35,900
True.

1213
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,920
Dude, I saw the...

1214
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,820
Once that happens, the Stand Fierce, the Fireball, you're going to get sent full screen, right?

1215
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,280
So, she's going to do...

1216
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,640
She's going to do this.

1217
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,320
And then Portal.

1218
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,880
So, if you parry this Fireball, and you see me go for...

1219
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,380
Like, hold it for a second.

1220
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,400
The parry.

1221
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,140
And you see that?

1222
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,660
Yes.

1223
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,480
And then...

1224
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,740
You didn't get all the way in through it, but you got pretty close.

1225
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,400
And you can even maybe threaten the overhead.

1226
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,140
Headbutt?

1227
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,540
Or Wheel Kick?

1228
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,460
The Wheel Kick.

1229
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,660
So, let's see if that works.

1230
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,940
So, if I do this...

1231
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,960
So, you didn't get it right away, but you get in range.

1232
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,220
And then you can even, like, dry brush into, like, something faster.

1233
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,780
But that's, like, the idea.

1234
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,940
Like, they're doing a lot of that.

1235
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,580
So, you can see when I do the snap.

1236
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,920
Yeah, you got in.

1237
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,680
So, whenever she gets you full screen, she's doing something like that.

1238
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,040
So, like, she gets a spike knockdown, right?

1239
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,500
She does this, and does this.

1240
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,540
And the only thing to worry about is if they teleport.

1241
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,640
But if the zoning is on top of you, you're playing a minigame with these spikes.

1242
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,420
So, yeah.

1243
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,520
When the Portal pops, you're kind of stuck.

1244
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,760
Like, these spikes have a lot more blocks.

1245
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,480
So, your gap is after the fireballs.

1246
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,100
Okay.

1247
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,980
After the fireballs.

1248
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,600
Not after Pierce.

1249
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,560
Yeah.

1250
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:00,520
So, after fireball, if I try to steal a turn, like, you actually block your parry and I do this, that's your main time to gain ground.

1251
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,400
Now, the other minigame is with your dry meter in general, right?

1252
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,680
Because he tears up your dry meter if you're parrying that.

1253
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,120
So, you do want to parry the fireballs, but if I hold the fireball, it doesn't attack you.

1254
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,240
So, you just want to actually, like, attack, like, parry late.

1255
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,500
Like, go for a perfect parry timing.

1256
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,680
You see how I...

1257
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,180
And every time you whip that parry, your dry meter is going down.

1258
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,800
I see.

1259
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,280
So, the fireball will hit you later than you think.

1260
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,780
See how much... See how late the fireball hits?

1261
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,520
Go, pop.

1262
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,860
Go, pop.

1263
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,640
See?

1264
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,060
Yeah.

1265
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,100
So, don't get baited by this.

1266
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,160
I see.

1267
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,680
And then, yeah.

1268
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,440
As you approach, empty jump in.

1269
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,640
You know, like, use your empty jumps to gain ground.

1270
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,300
Like, yeah, that's pretty good.

1271
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,580
The only thing you gotta worry about is, like, if you do it really late, like, if you empty jump after this, that can happen.

1272
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,660
But when you're up close, early jump MK.

1273
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,860
Like, early as fuck.

1274
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,460
So, Nephew was telling me that you can actually jump early, so they're crouching punch whiffs.

1275
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,940
That's called... Yeah, that's...

1276
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,020
And then you can, like...

1277
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,580
But, Ed, also, this is the same idea.

1278
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,540
If you empty jump, like, from this distance, like, right here, probably.

1279
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah, like...

1280
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,840
Yeah, do it.

1281
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,220
Empty jump.

1282
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,680
Like, that might still hit.

1283
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:26,860
There.

1284
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,640
But, like... See?

1285
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:27,700
Yeah.

1286
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,520
I'll do light.

1287
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,520
And in the heat of a moment, I might be like...

1288
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,020
You know, it's easy to catch off guard like that.

1289
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,860
Exactly like that.

1290
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,940
And then if you're a little bit closer, you're gonna do jump MK.

1291
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,460
Because jump MK is your earliest.

1292
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,420
See how early that hit?

1293
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,380
Yeah.

1294
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,380
So, say I whiffed this.

1295
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,820
You're, like, here, and you jump MK.

1296
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,140
I can't anti-air you.

1297
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,700
If I whiff...

1298
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,220
If I whiff Stand Fierce here, that's a punish.

1299
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,260
And you gotta do short jab, and not always dry brush cancel.

1300
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,720
This match, you gotta be really concerned about your dry meter.

1301
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,700
So, after you land your jump MK, do short jab.

1302
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,600
Or, sorry, Crushing Light Kick, Crushing Jab.

1303
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,640
What's the combo if you don't DRC?

1304
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,200
So, you can go into Lariat or OD Lariat.

1305
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,740
At least, OD Lariat is two bars.

1306
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

1307
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,220
So, it's short, jab, then OD Lariat.

1308
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,620
And then hold forward during your Lariat.

1309
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,100
So, you can try that, or that's two bars, so it's more meter efficiency.

1310
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,540
Or, just don't do anything.

1311
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,080
Like, you have a reset.

1312
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,860
Do headbutt.

1313
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Like, you always dry brush cancel.

1314
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,540
Just do short jab on hit as a combo, then headbutt them.

1315
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,420
Or SBD.

1316
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,400
Yeah.

1317
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,100
Right away.

1318
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,920
You know what I mean?

1319
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,620
Like, just don't mindlessly burn yourself out when you get a hit.

1320
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,580
That's all I'm saying.

1321
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,820
You gotta be really meter efficient.

1322
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:58,620
If you land a heavy SBD, I wouldn't even do the dry brush stand light kick pressure unless you have a ton of meter.

1323
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,080
Like, dry brush crash MK after heavy SBD.

1324
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,320
Or, like, dry brush up and, you know, stand heavy.

1325
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,200
Just don't burn yourself out.

1326
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,660
You need the meter in this matchup.

1327
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,720
Yeah, because he can chip you from full screen.

1328
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,700
Yes.

1329
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,280
Like that.

1330
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,560
Don't fall for this.

1331
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,880
Just keep walking block when that happens.

1332
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,820
If I give you a fake fireball, now you're at a threatening range.

1333
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,260
I could not anti-air you there.

1334
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,660
Don't dry brush cancel unless you have a ton of meter.

1335
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,040
Headbutt instead.

1336
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,600
If I block the short jab, you're in range to then do knee.

1337
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,040
Okay.

1338
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,480
I muted myself because I don't want to scream at...

1339
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
I was like...

1340
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,280
I was worried.

1341
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,520
I was going to distract them.

1342
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,800
You know what I'm saying?

1343
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,800
After short jab...

1344
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm so nervous.

1345
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,740
Okay, wait.

1346
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,280
Let me...

1347
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,480
I'll def in for now.

1348
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:03,420
The thing is, I'm super worried because the moment I have to think, I play a lot worse.

1349
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,240
I do better when I'm not thinking.

1350
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,260
Like...

1351
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,040
In a tournament, it doesn't matter if I'm practicing.

1352
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,620
Practicing is easier.

1353
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,960
To like...

1354
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,600
To not think.

1355
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,520
But when I'm like...

1356
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,460
When I'm in a tournament setting, if I don't think, it's just...

1357
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,940
It's easier for me.

1358
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,220
I start overthinking about what I should be doing.

1359
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,840
I do better with instinct and reaction than figuring strategy.

1360
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,120
I think that's why...

1361
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,760
Also, it threw me off because Gumi was playing so slow.

1362
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,080
She...

1363
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,300
The first two games I played against her, she played incredibly...

1364
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,440
She played incredibly fast.

1365
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,360
And now she played super slow.

1366
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,500
So that also threw me off so hard.

1367
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,080
I was not used to it.

1368
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,920
Yeah, she was like...

1369
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,020
She changed... She literally changed her playstyle.

1370
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,420
And I didn't...

1371
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,660
I didn't know what to do with that.

1372
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,160
And then I started thinking too.

1373
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,620
So...

1374
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,800
I started thinking too because she changed her playstyle.

1375
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,680
Because I was like, what the fuck do I do?

1376
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,260
Slap, slap, slap.

1377
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,920
Oh, unlucky.

1378
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,920
Okay, she...

1379
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,880
I also burned out too.

1380
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,220
But that's alright.

1381
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,520
I don't need my burn.

1382
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,120
What?

1383
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,260
Oh, I don't need it.

1384
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,020
I just don't do well with...

1385
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,040
I shouldn't say that because people will be like, oh, she doesn't do well in slow gameplay.

1386
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,100
I do so well when it's slow too.

1387
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,360
I shouldn't say that.

1388
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,100
Because everybody will be like, oh, she doesn't do well when it's slow.

1389
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,820
I just need to...

1390
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,780
Um...

1391
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,080
I can not think when I play.

1392
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,540
Not thinking has been what's costing me when it comes to fighting games.

1393
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,500
Oh.

1394
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,820
I didn't expect him to jump.

1395
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,760
Watch this though.

1396
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
Oh shit, okay.

1397
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,620
That would've been cool if it worked though.

1398
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,620
You know that would've been so cool if that worked.

1399
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,180
Guys, how did my first match go?

1400
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,280
I totally won my first match, guys.

1401
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,520
We didn't go to coach's match, so technically, technically I won.

1402
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,760
Oh, he missed.

1403
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,400
Thank you.

1404
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,130
Oh, whoa.

1405
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,150
I looked at chat.

1406
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,390
Hey, hey, hey.

1407
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,190
I looked at chat.

1408
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,250
I looked at chat, Jas.

1409
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,310
I looked at chat.

1410
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,870
Give me back my HP.

1411
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,630
I looked at chat.

1412
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,310
It's not fair.

1413
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,450
Does it hit?

1414
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,030
Oh, it does.

1415
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:14,350
Okay.

1416
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,370
Okay.

1417
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,050
Nice.

1418
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,190
Oh, what?

1419
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,630
I totally went backwards!

1420
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,350
Wait, I don't think I hit that.

1421
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,110
No!

1422
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,750
He jumped backwards!

1423
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,690
You're stream sniping.

1424
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,970
You're stream sniping, guys.

1425
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,830
This is not fair.

1426
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,490
He's literally stream sniping.

1427
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,230
Oh.

1428
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,050
Oh, that hits me.

1429
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:49,370
No!

1430
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,280
How dare you.

1431
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,060
How dare you stream snipe.

1432
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,920
I mean, I got one match off a plat player.

1433
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,220
I mean, that's pretty good.

1434
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,740
Shaking my head.

1435
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,500
Stream sniping?

1436
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,120
Stream sniping in my fucking...

1437
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,840
Oh, I need to remember to not do that anymore.

1438
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,820
Or not anymore, but like if they know.

1439
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,000
What?

1440
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,400
Oh.

1441
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,800
It's because of that little bomb.

1442
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,700
I've never had that hit before, so I never got used to it.

1443
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,030
Oh.

1444
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,810
I'm lucky.

1445
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,250
No!

1446
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,630
You're not supposed to be jumping!

1447
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,050
Sir!

1448
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,530
Sir!

1449
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,490
I need to cover my game.

1450
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,030
He's stream sniping.

1451
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,190
I need to cover my game.

1452
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,510
Okay.

1453
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,510
Oh, he definitely did not expect that, though.

1454
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,870
Oh, shit!

1455
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:54,990
Haha!

1456
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,310
Doesn't matter.

1457
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,450
He's cheating by winning.

1458
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,630
That should be illegal.

1459
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,730
Oh, we both...

1460
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,750
I don't want to do that, though.

1461
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,640
Oh!

1462
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,300
I also like...

1463
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,160
I don't like that everybody labbed me.

1464
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,400
I don't like that.

1465
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,760
I like being the underdog.

1466
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,300
I like it when people think I'm not good.

1467
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,800
I don't like that.

1468
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,300
People think I'm good now.

1469
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
Please, keep thinking I'm fat.

1470
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,840
That's all I want.

1471
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,380
Haha!

1472
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,040
No, I want to be the underdog.

1473
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,320
It's more fun.

1474
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,220
Haha!

1475
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,700
No!

1476
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,300
I'm still baby!

1477
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,600
I'm still baby, guys!

1478
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,960
I swear to God!

1479
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,060
Haha!

1480
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,320
I swear to God!

1481
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,800
I don't know what I'm doing.

1482
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,920
I still don't.

1483
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,240
To be fair, I actually still don't know what I'm doing.

1484
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:07,540
Haha!

1485
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,100
Nice.

1486
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:11,780
Alright.

1487
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,200
I want to be a child forever!

1488
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,840
That's why I'm a VTuber!

1489
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,300
I want to set against him.

1490
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,720
Alright, let's see.

1491
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,840
JesusRice, okay!

1492
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,800
Holy shit!

1493
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,240
Master versus...

1494
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,540
Okay, I'm going to watch this.

1495
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,800
Master Bison versus Master Bison.

1496
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,700
Let's see who's winning.

1497
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,220
Round two.

1498
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,720
Alright.

1499
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,440
Haha!

1500
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,260
What the fuck!

1501
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,220
Oh!

1502
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,700
Damn!

1503
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,900
I watched that just to see him lose.

1504
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,720
Hahaha!

1505
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,740
Just to see him lose!

1506
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,840
The Bison!

1507
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,860
Holy shit!

1508
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,680
What the fuck!

1509
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,060
A perfect K!

1510
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,760
Oh!

1511
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,420
Holy shit!

1512
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,600
When you're mastermatched, this is how your game looks like.

1513
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,280
Oh, we're finally...

1514
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,120
Oh, they're running Classic too.

1515
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,560
Hahaha!

1516
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,480
When you head to mastermatches, you have to play at that speed.

1517
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,260
Maybe you guys didn't know that.

1518
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,220
Okay, I just want to make sure that I didn't forget to join...

1519
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:17,780
Haha!

1520
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,040
Maybe I didn't forget to join a lobby or something.

1521
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,560
Because that would be embarrassing.

1522
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,260
Yeah, they actually play that fast.

1523
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,980
The moment you hit that elo...

1524
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,840
Holy shit!

1525
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,220
The Bison mirror match.

1526
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:34,820
This is the better Bison.

1527
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,180
They're all 1500 MR.

1528
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,880
So they're both, like, nearly the same.

1529
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,640
They can be hilariously one-sided.

1530
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,720
I mean, look at this.

1531
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,320
Hahaha!

1532
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,000
Hahaha!

1533
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,640
Hahaha!

1534
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,940
Hahaha!

1535
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,360
Hahaha!

1536
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,880
Holy shit!

1537
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,660
Oh my god!

1538
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,420
Bison won?

1539
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,020
Oh my god, guys!

1540
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,960
Bison won!

1541
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,700
Hahaha!

1542
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,300
Wait!

1543
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,460
How long are they going?

1544
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,980
No, I'm stopping.

1545
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,860
We're fucking...

1546
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,280
Hahaha!

1547
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,160
They're just...

1548
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,100
They're just fighting and fighting.

1549
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,540
Um...

1550
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,220
They're just fighting and fighting and fighting.

1551
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,120
Is there room to win...

1552
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,540
Matches to win too?

1553
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,180
So we can all queue into one slot?

1554
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:23,740
Okay.

1555
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,120
How do I do that?

1556
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,060
Matches to win...

1557
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,800
Uh...

1558
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,440
Oh, here you go.

1559
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,640
There you go.

1560
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,100
I did it.

1561
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,600
Alright, glue savant.

1562
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,020
Alright.

1563
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,440
I thought that was funny.

1564
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,720
Hahaha!

1565
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,280
They're just fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting.

1566
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:44,920
Hahaha!

1567
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,260
Hahaha!

1568
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,180
I can't believe it.

1569
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,340
Bison always wins.

1570
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,420
Fight forever!

1571
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,500
They're gonna fight forever!

1572
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,840
Hahaha!

1573
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,880
They're gonna keep fighting until it's over.

1574
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,620
Hahaha!

1575
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,500
I swear to god.

1576
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,340
If you're not modding, I'm gonna plug.

1577
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,400
Hahaha!

1578
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,240
I swear to god.

1579
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,040
Hahaha!

1580
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,720
I need you guys to be modding.

1581
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,760
I cannot.

1582
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,440
I was so tilted.

1583
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,020
There were Bison sliding and I was like, The fuck is that move?

1584
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,920
Hahaha!

1585
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,660
Today I was playing and I was like, What the fuck is that move?

1586
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,580
Why are you sliding?

1587
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,060
I've never seen that move before.

1588
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,480
Like, this should be legal.

1589
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,200
Hahaha!

1590
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,220
I'm lucky.

1591
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,300
Oh.

1592
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,720
Oops.

1593
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,140
I'm not thinking anymore.

1594
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,900
But like, negatively.

1595
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,480
Hahaha!

1596
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,500
Not like the good kind of not thinking.

1597
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,600
Oh shit.

1598
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,300
Oh.

1599
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:51,940
He does this.

1600
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:52,720
Okay.

1601
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,000
What?

1602
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,680
I'm not even...

1603
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,120
Okay.

1604
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:56,880
Oh.

1605
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,560
He knows how to...

1606
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,900
You've been stream sniping me!

1607
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,620
Hahaha!

1608
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:02,720
Hahaha!

1609
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:03,620
Hahaha!

1610
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,260
This is not fair.

1611
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,100
This is not fair.

1612
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,220
You clearly...

1613
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,040
You clearly know my move.

1614
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,340
Hahaha!

1615
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,960
Cover your screen.

1616
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,260
Hahaha!

1617
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,040
Hahaha!

1618
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,880
What do I do?

1619
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,480
He's doing anti-air.

1620
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,840
That's not what's supposed to happen.

1621
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,540
Hahaha!

1622
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,580
Oh shit.

1623
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,000
Okay.

1624
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,620
Oh shit.

1625
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Okay.

1626
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Oh.

1627
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,180
No.

1628
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,020
I don't want to.

1629
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,340
Oh.

1630
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,440
No.

1631
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,440
I don't want to.

1632
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Okay.

1633
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:36,820
Nice.

1634
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,920
Oh no!

1635
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:41,300
Oh no!

1636
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,180
I hate...

1637
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,420
The rock, paper, scissors didn't go my way.

1638
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,970
Us stream snipers.

1639
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:51,710
I know, right?

1640
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,450
How dare you stream snipe me.

1641
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,950
That's fucking right.

1642
00:48:58,830 --> 00:48:59,430
Whoa.

1643
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,730
Wait, what?

1644
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:01,290
Oh.

1645
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,190
No.

1646
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,270
Yes.

1647
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,990
That's fucking right.

1648
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,170
Yeah!

1649
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,550
Let's go.

1650
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,370
Goddamn stream sniper.

1651
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:24,550
I want to do headbutt more, but I always... I don't know when to use it sometimes.

1652
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,390
Which is like...

1653
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,830
That's like my biggest issue.

1654
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:29,910
Like, do I do this?

1655
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,790
Okay, I do.

1656
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:31,090
Okay.

1657
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,430
Nice.

1658
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:35,630
No!

1659
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,890
I was... I stopped because I knew he was going to do that.

1660
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,210
Oh.

1661
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,070
That's fucked up.

1662
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,290
That's fucked up.

1663
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,090
That's right.

1664
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:48,570
Impossible.

1665
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:50,710
Oh!

1666
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,850
I was going to do a lariat.

1667
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,050
I blame ping.

1668
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,630
I blame because you're on Wi-Fi.

1669
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,490
No!

1670
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,330
He jumped!

1671
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,770
Stream sniper!

1672
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,410
He saw my input!

1673
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,470
He had a second account that's just watching my inputs.

1674
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:12,370
Okay,

1675
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,210
I need to stop doing that.

1676
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,150
Because, like, I don't know.

1677
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,450
I don't know if, like, they're going to adapt to that.

1678
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,190
But, like, I definitely need to stop that.

1679
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:29,890
It's not fair.

1680
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,030
You're not supposed to be adapting.

1681
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,630
Okay.

1682
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,190
Okay.

1683
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,150
That's fucking right.

1684
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:54,130
It's my turn to drive impact.

1685
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,990
How are you adapting?

1686
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,290
This should be illegal.

1687
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,070
That's fucking right.

1688
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,070
Wait, what?

1689
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,250
Yeah, this guy's not bad.

1690
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,930
This guy's adapting so hard.

1691
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,600
No, please.

1692
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,180
No!

1693
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,900
There we go.

1694
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,370
Do I grab?

1695
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:31,710
No!

1696
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:33,830
I don't!

1697
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:35,670
He does that thing!

1698
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:40,990
No!

1699
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,870
He did it again!

1700
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,330
You're so fucking...

1701
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:44,830
You're mean.

1702
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:51,570
You're so fucking mean.

1703
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:52,910
That's fucking mean.

1704
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,330
That was the way.

1705
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:00,830
Alright.

1706
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,850
Oh, okay.

1707
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,110
Let's fight a masters player.

1708
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,450
Surely this will be okay.

1709
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,110
Alright, I'm going to death end just in case.

1710
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,190
Huntress might be an all sham no wow too.

1711
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,450
And then Nephew might...

1712
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,730
Yeah, they might make a comeback.

1713
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,810
Huntress is really good.

1714
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:22,510
Yeah.

1715
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,670
Well, automatically he beat Nephew last time, so who knows what happens here.

1716
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:27,510
Oh yeah, he did?

1717
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:29,970
That's a huge upset though.

1718
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,010
If he does it twice in a row, that'd be insane.

1719
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,970
Like, that's really unexpected.

1720
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,370
Well, Diophon also took out Nephew as well.

1721
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,610
So far he's the only two that he's lost to.

1722
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:41,750
They're the only two.

1723
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,670
Holy shit, Ross.

1724
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,970
He's doing really good.

1725
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,210
That was a great DI from Roy.

1726
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,330
He just needs one more round.

1727
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:51,850
Lock in Ross.

1728
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,650
Close it out here.

1729
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,710
I'm scared if he doesn't close it out here.

1730
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,730
Wait, we want Roy to win though.

1731
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,630
Yeah, I don't know.

1732
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:04,350
I think personally we do better against Team Automatic.

1733
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:05,550
I just...

1734
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,270
I want to watch a good match.

1735
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,390
I want to see the rest of them play.

1736
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,470
Let's go Roy!

1737
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:10,730
Woo!

1738
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,930
Oh, what a big...

1739
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,070
Oh, he's nervous.

1740
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,730
We're just gonna beat Shyme.

1741
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,570
You're Classic Bison!

1742
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,390
I'm plugging.

1743
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,390
I'm plugging.

1744
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,550
Oh, this is bad.

1745
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,110
No, if we beat Shyme, we're done.

1746
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,410
No, no, no.

1747
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:29,910
Wait a minute.

1748
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,270
Oh, so we're gonna...

1749
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,510
Even if we lose, we're good.

1750
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,950
Let me win your Classic.

1751
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,490
If you use Slide, I swear to God.

1752
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,490
If you use Slide, I swear to God, it's out.

1753
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,970
You're out.

1754
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,010
Uh oh.

1755
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,990
If I see a fucking Slide...

1756
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,210
No way, Zip.

1757
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,070
That's it.

1758
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:53,510
It's over.

1759
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,930
Oh my gosh.

1760
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,370
I can't focus.

1761
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:58,910
Damn.

1762
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,110
Okay, now we have...

1763
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:02,870
Might have an issue.

1764
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:04,610
That's crazy.

1765
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,710
Alright, well...

1766
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,830
Wait, who won?

1767
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:09,530
Wow.

1768
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,610
He actually did it.

1769
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:11,110
Good stuff.

1770
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,830
He saved his team.

1771
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,370
Good job for him.

1772
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,110
Damn.

1773
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,330
Got him upset, yeah.

1774
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,730
I haven't seen all Shyme, no WoW play.

1775
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:23,970
Like, at all.

1776
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,690
Is he... Can you do this?

1777
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,170
Uh, yeah.

1778
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,110
I mean, he played against me last time, and he beat me.

1779
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,010
I beat... We're 1-1.

1780
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,370
Moira lost?

1781
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,270
This is his first loss.

1782
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,110
That's crazy.

1783
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,330
That's actually his first loss.

1784
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,090
Both of them are probably the highest level MR.

1785
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,070
Okay.

1786
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,130
Oh, shoot.

1787
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,510
Oh my god.

1788
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,070
That's actually insane that he lost.

1789
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,050
Yeah, I feel like Petrus is the strongest opponent at that tier.

1790
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:53,970
Yeah.

1791
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,290
Alright, nice.

1792
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,090
I beat a master!

1793
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,890
She definitely is a grinder.

1794
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,890
I beat a master!

1795
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,030
Let's fucking go!

1796
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,510
Get out.

1797
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,270
I don't know if he was fucking with me, too.

1798
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,050
I don't...

1799
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,170
My loyal fans!

1800
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,650
No, you were on Classic.

1801
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,990
No.

1802
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:22,550
I definitely preemptively I was not expecting him to actually win.

1803
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,430
Let me pull this up.

1804
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,550
Let me see Sage and Sam.

1805
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:26,890
Yeah, they might run it back.

1806
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,030
Team Nepia has a really good chance to turn this all the way around now.

1807
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:30,630
Yeah.

1808
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,170
Oh, this would be interesting, though.

1809
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,030
This would be interesting.

1810
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,510
Whoever wins this...

1811
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:40,610
Oh!

1812
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,010
My god!

1813
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,290
I'm muted, by the way, so they can't hear me.

1814
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,270
Is it dying for you guys, too?

1815
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,390
It's back now.

1816
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,430
It was dying a little bit.

1817
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,850
You have to refresh, though.

1818
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:54,650
I'm muted.

1819
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,970
I'm just nervous.

1820
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:56,610
Alright, let's do this.

1821
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,130
Who do I play?

1822
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,750
You know what?

1823
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,310
Let's go.

1824
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,450
You better be fucking modern.

1825
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:06,230
You better be modern, I swear to god.

1826
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,570
You better be modern.

1827
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,750
Yeah, they, like, beat each other.

1828
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:11,930
I swear to god.

1829
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,770
If you use that one slide, I'm plugging.

1830
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,150
The other modern... Oh, thank god.

1831
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:21,830
Okay, I was gonna say, the other guy didn't use the slide, so...

1832
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,550
The other guy didn't use the slide, so I didn't plug him.

1833
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,650
But I did say, if I see you use that slide, it's over.

1834
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,770
Her anti-air stuff is so good.

1835
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,970
She's really good at converting those counter hits.

1836
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,870
I feel like he's just... There's no way.

1837
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,370
There's no way.

1838
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,370
He's fucking with me.

1839
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,450
He's giving me this win.

1840
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,250
There's no way.

1841
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,090
There's...

1842
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,690
You're just making me feel good, and then you're gonna destroy me now.

1843
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,190
There's no fucking way.

1844
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,370
I refuse to believe you play like this.

1845
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,030
Crazy anti-air conversion.

1846
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:00,350
Like, crazy combo.

1847
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,690
That was a crazy swift punish though.

1848
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:03,310
There's no way.

1849
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,850
There's no way you play like this.

1850
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,530
Alshan's really grinding for this comeback, though.

1851
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,390
Wow.

1852
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:12,650
I'll be honest, I...

1853
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,210
I'll face either of these...

1854
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,210
Both of these players are really good.

1855
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,790
I'm very much...

1856
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:19,750
That's no modern.

1857
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,110
That's true.

1858
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,030
I won't be surprised.

1859
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,690
Modern apparently is very different for Bison.

1860
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,350
Your offensive flowchart, it just... It's so good.

1861
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,630
It's overwhelming for everybody.

1862
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:30,450
Yeah.

1863
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,910
Like, you know once you get going, it's over.

1864
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,510
He does not look like he's played a modern control before.

1865
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,270
Oh, he's whiffing, and then neutral a lot.

1866
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,690
He's dead if he has this.

1867
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:45,750
Whiff punish and kill him.

1868
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,330
Damn, she got real combos.

1869
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,510
Oh shit.

1870
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:51,790
Oh!

1871
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,150
Oh, I don't... He is, because he lands that.

1872
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,570
Can't tell if you guys are behind or ahead.

1873
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,290
I know that combo.

1874
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,150
That she just did.

1875
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:58,670
Let's go.

1876
00:57:58,910 --> 00:57:59,750
Oh, I'm... Okay.

1877
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:00,990
Yeah.

1878
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,170
Ooh.

1879
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,510
The real chunk right here.

1880
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,710
Yup.

1881
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:12,690
Punish?

1882
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:12,970
Yeah.

1883
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:13,790
Nice punish.

1884
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,630
Driver reversal punishes.

1885
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:20,610
Oh, and he knows the perfect parry punish on the legs.

1886
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,270
Wait, does he get that?

1887
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,710
Oh yeah, that's fucky right.

1888
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:24,350
Look at that.

1889
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,650
He's so weird.

1890
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,050
DJ?

1891
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,450
Like, his move.

1892
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,490
Like that, right?

1893
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:31,350
That jump in.

1894
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,430
So weird.

1895
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,390
The bazooka knee.

1896
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,670
Yeah, he's mad annoying.

1897
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,810
He just shimmies in and out of all your ranges.

1898
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:42,710
Like, your typical defensive patterns for checking stuff just falls apart against him.

1899
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,090
He'll do like a low hatchet kick or the overhead.

1900
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:45,890
That's fucking right.

1901
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,510
Oh, what?

1902
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,430
That's not fucking right!

1903
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:48,370
Yeah, that down knee is really annoying too.

1904
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,570
That's not fucking right.

1905
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:54,450
He's probably like one of the most gimmicky characters we have right now.

1906
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,610
He's learning modern!

1907
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,890
Guys, he's learning it!

1908
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,150
Bison is also, right?

1909
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:58,710
Or is he not?

1910
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,430
Bison is more cheesy, I would say.

1911
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,890
Guys, I can't believe it!

1912
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,730
He's learning modern!

1913
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,330
But DJ is a little bit like that.

1914
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:12,830
But also like, you try to take your turn back on certain moves and he just sways out of the way and then kills you while he knee hops.

1915
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,570
His movement is very not standard.

1916
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,030
He's learning in real time!

1917
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:20,930
He's not at any Gordo level.

1918
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,230
But yeah.

1919
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,130
Yeah, it used to be super whack.

1920
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,330
Even though he's...

1921
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:25,970
4?

1922
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,970
He was so boring in 4, I hated that character.

1923
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,230
Low tier, but just so boring to fight.

1924
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:34,810
Wow.

1925
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,130
What the hell?

1926
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,730
I'm trying to do headbutt, but I feel like it's...

1927
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:37,830
Oh, she dropped it.

1928
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:41,870
Look at her confidence, like walk-up throw.

1929
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,210
Like, she knows to use the walk speed and...

1930
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,070
Ooh, the parry.

1931
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:46,930
Yes!

1932
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,030
Got it.

1933
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,150
Oh, you're mad behind.

1934
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,030
Oh, he jumped!

1935
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,330
I tried to be fast!

1936
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:56,330
Fancy!

1937
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,390
I wanted to be fancy!

1938
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,010
Oh, he's burnt though, man.

1939
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,930
Oh, she dropped it!

1940
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:04,330
I'm gonna watch.

1941
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,670
Oh, okay, never mind.

1942
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:07,030
We play.

1943
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,330
Yeah, that's the way you do the fireball.

1944
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:10,310
Is that...

1945
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:11,770
That was great.

1946
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,310
Oh my god.

1947
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,010
She has the combo.

1948
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:16,370
Who's winning?

1949
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,370
Damn, she did it.

1950
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:19,530
Okay.

1951
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,150
Yeah, she called out the fireball at level 2.

1952
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,130
Guys, who's winning right now?

1953
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,450
I gotta be careful.

1954
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:25,730
Nice.

1955
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,830
Yeah, when she had level 2, she called out the fireball.

1956
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:30,930
Huntress?

1957
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:31,990
Oh, it's Huntress?

1958
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:32,750
Oh, okay.

1959
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,890
DJ, OD fireball.

1960
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,670
Wait, isn't Roy in like...

1961
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:41,870
Yeah, playing his own game versus him is not good because he throws that out and he just dies.

1962
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,930
Wait, how come... Wait, I'm so confused.

1963
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,830
Yeah, he can level 2 a fireball also.

1964
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,510
How is... Yeah, but Roy is in...

1965
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,630
We'll see if he has the rhythm.

1966
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,090
He dropped the level 2 conversions.

1967
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,610
Oh, it's 4...

1968
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,290
It's 4 seed.

1969
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,150
Okay.

1970
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,770
So stupid.

1971
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,810
I thought I was thinking Roy is in the...

1972
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:02,890
Oh, wow.

1973
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,850
I thought Roy was last one in Coach's match.

1974
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,970
I keep thinking he's the anchor.

1975
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,990
I keep thinking that.

1976
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,890
I keep thinking he's the anchor because he's so good.

1977
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,830
But clearly...

1978
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:20,350
Not anymore.

1979
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,390
Sorry, I didn't mean that as toxic, but you know what I mean.

1980
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,410
Everybody always assumes...

1981
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,350
He's like the favorite.

1982
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,110
So, people are always surprised.

1983
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,130
That was a crazy grab.

1984
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:35,590
Yeah, because Justin was like you should be the anchor spot because of how good you are.

1985
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,290
Sorry, that was not meant to be toxic.

1986
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,950
It's actually the biggest upset.

1987
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,150
Oh, God.

1988
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,670
It's pretty common.

1989
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,470
Oh, the cheeky overhead reset.

1990
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:48,890
You're dead.

1991
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:49,770
Oh, my God.

1992
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:50,650
That was crazy.

1993
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:52,770
That's an overhead.

1994
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:54,510
Yeah, I'm muted because I'm practicing.

1995
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:55,850
It's not fun.

1996
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,260
I'm practicing.

1997
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,240
That's why I'm muted.

1998
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,460
Yeah, they're playing the game.

1999
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,400
Oh, he's higher MMR.

2000
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,880
Higher MMR.

2001
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,760
That's our GOAT.

2002
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:11,900
Huh?

2003
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,160
You're higher MMR than them.

2004
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,180
MMR don't mean nothing.

2005
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,880
No, no, no.

2006
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,480
It means everything.

2007
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,220
It's free for you.

2008
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,680
We're playing against Shines team.

2009
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,260
Next.

2010
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:27,900
That's unsafe.

2011
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,980
Have you blocked lightning legs?

2012
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,020
It depends on the version.

2013
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,040
The heavy one is safe.

2014
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:34,820
The other ones are punishable.

2015
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,680
But the heavy one has a big gap.

2016
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,080
The light one is unsafe, but sometimes it hits at a weird distance and it's awkward to punish.

2017
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:40,580
Okay.

2018
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,800
I just need to get over my nerves.

2019
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,900
That's really it.

2020
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,620
As long as I don't think, it will be fine.

2021
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,580
But the moment I start thinking, it's GG.

2022
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,200
The moment I start...

2023
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,280
The moment...

2024
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,220
She's grabbing a lot.

2025
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,960
I just need to make sure.

2026
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,360
Oh my gosh.

2027
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,820
Jump more.

2028
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,260
I need practice.

2029
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:03,960
Jump more.

2030
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,180
She jumps a lot.

2031
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:05,940
Jump more.

2032
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,640
If you're watching, jump more.

2033
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,060
She burnt herself.

2034
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,080
That's it.

2035
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:11,800
Jump more!

2036
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,060
Not now!

2037
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,500
Jump at me!

2038
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,640
Jump at me!

2039
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:18,900
That's right.

2040
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,720
Do that.

2041
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,480
Keep doing that.

2042
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,260
That was a crazy upset.

2043
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,080
I saw the match after a while.

2044
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,180
That's good.

2045
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,140
That's good.

2046
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,280
I definitely know you stream sniping.

2047
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,840
How was the match when you rewatched it?

2048
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,000
What did you notice?

2049
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,780
He was cooking, but I didn't think you were actually going to jump.

2050
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,380
Jump!

2051
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,040
Jump!

2052
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:41,580
Jump!

2053
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,080
Jump!

2054
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,640
Keep jumping!

2055
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:48,780
Keep jumping!

2056
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,760
I need you to jump!

2057
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,240
He had the guaranteed win.

2058
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,780
He was like, oh my god, I'm actually beating him.

2059
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,420
Keep jumping!

2060
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,260
Thank you.

2061
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,320
Yeah, he got it, but it was...

2062
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,820
He's really good.

2063
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:01,240
That's good.

2064
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:01,700
That's good.

2065
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,060
You don't have to jump anymore.

2066
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,680
He's actually really reaction heavy.

2067
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,700
More than the average player.

2068
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,820
Okay, now you don't have to jump anymore.

2069
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,460
You don't have to jump anymore.

2070
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:15,080
No way.

2071
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,760
Yeah.

2072
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,640
Thank you for jumping.

2073
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,620
I appreciate it.

2074
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,720
I appreciate the jump.

2075
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,400
Drink.

2076
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,640
Drink that drink.

2077
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,460
Both almost burned, dude.

2078
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,640
Nice.

2079
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,440
Nice delay on the media.

2080
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,960
Alright guys, that's enough practice.

2081
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,880
I want to watch the last match.

2082
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,220
Alright guys.

2083
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,400
GG's.

2084
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,400
How does he find it?

2085
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,340
We're gonna watch the games.

2086
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,980
No, anti-air again.

2087
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,040
He's playing like I play.

2088
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,940
Confirmed to the super nephew.

2089
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,240
Oh, it's nephew versus auto.

2090
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,120
Right here.

2091
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,480
Yep, yep.

2092
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
He threw it.

2093
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,340
He had it.

2094
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,380
He messed up.

2095
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,120
Hey, nephew deranged.

2096
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,980
Look at that jump.

2097
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,280
Nice.

2098
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,650
This is the last game and then it's us, right?

2099
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:13,830
Yeah.

2100
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:14,970
Should be, yeah.

2101
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,740
Nice counter hit confirm.

2102
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:20,960
Level one.

2103
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,220
It's gonna be near burnout.

2104
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,760
Meaty fireball is pretty much guaranteed here.

2105
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,540
Is that burnout with level one?

2106
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,460
Oh, he doesn't have fireball.

2107
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,140
That's rough.

2108
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,960
Okay, yeah, this is checkmate.

2109
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,480
Textbook nephew game.

2110
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,180
Yeah.

2111
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,120
Taught him everything he knows.

2112
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,380
He makes Jury look like top one.

2113
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:41,900
It's crazy.

2114
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,400
Nice punish.

2115
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,180
Ooh, dropped it.

2116
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:48,800
Rare drop.

2117
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,860
Jury is really good.

2118
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,260
I gotta chive in here.

2119
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,640
You guys always act like this character sucks.

2120
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,500
It drives me nuts too.

2121
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,260
No, she's bottom one coach.

2122
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,520
She won the biggest tournament in the world.

2123
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,060
Is she meta or not meta?

2124
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,240
I don't understand.

2125
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That's her Oshibuff.

2126
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:02,920
That's not how it works.

2127
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,080
That's the Oshibuff.

2128
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,900
Wait, but then why did everybody play Edge and Evo this year?

2129
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,800
They didn't.

2130
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,900
It's just players and there's like 20 characters you can win with.

2131
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,160
And Jury won Capcom Cup, the million dollar tournament.

2132
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,520
She's the biggest, most winningest character of all time in Street Fighter history.

2133
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:18,500
Oh!

2134
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,500
That is good.

2135
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:21,520
Jury is good.

2136
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,280
They're good.

2137
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,520
How come Jury wasn't in top eight?

2138
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,520
But that doesn't matter.

2139
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,340
That's one tournament.

2140
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,340
I thought...

2141
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,560
But people tell me Evo is the most important fighting game tournament.

2142
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,260
Was that a lie?

2143
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,400
Yes, but there's 200 people that go to Evo that could win it and one of them wins that day.

2144
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,660
That's just how it is.

2145
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,380
It's not like... you can't look at one tournament and think anything really.

2146
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,340
Listen, coach.

2147
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,480
But you're looking at one tournament for Jury and thinking something.

2148
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,620
Well, I'm trying to...

2149
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,620
Yeah, you're looking at one tournament for Capcom.

2150
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:53,520
Exactly.

2151
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,520
I can look at a tournament that Jamie won and say he's top tier.

2152
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,960
Listen to this though.

2153
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,440
When he won the million dollars, he retired because he knew.

2154
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,280
He knew Jury was nerfed?

2155
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,660
They buffed her.

2156
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,000
Wait, they buffed her?

2157
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,440
He won and they buffed her.

2158
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,900
That's a perfect team nephew.

2159
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,060
Oh yeah, and that's it.

2160
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,140
Wow, they made the comeback.

2161
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,160
Yep.

2162
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:18,500
Damn.

2163
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,180
That's just the difference, man.

2164
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:28,160
Alright, well, if we beat Shine, we have to play really, really hard.

2165
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:28,560
One round at a time.

2166
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,100
Let's just focus on Shine's team, guys.

2167
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,800
That does not matter.

2168
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,020
Think about Shine now.

2169
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:41,080
Yeah, because for us to play JP and then I have to make sure I don't think.

2170
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:41,840
What?

2171
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,680
I have to make sure I don't think.

2172
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,480
Yeah.

2173
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,860
I believe in you, Doki.

2174
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,740
I believe.

2175
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,360
Alright, well.

2176
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,460
Alright, let's do this.

2177
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,660
Let's do this.

2178
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:56,940
Woah, woah, woah.

2179
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,080
I'm waiting for my custom room.

2180
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,300
Gonna be fun.

2181
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,100
Don't think, just jam.

2182
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:05,780
Alright?

2183
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,740
I just need to not think.

2184
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,340
Just jam.

2185
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,500
Don't think, just jam.

2186
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,380
I can't believe it.

2187
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,980
People change their playstyle.

2188
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,880
That should be illegal.

2189
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,040
You stick with a plan and then you should never change.

2190
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,300
Yeah, it's crazy at these different tiers.

2191
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,940
Like, there's so many quick wins for people to quickly adapt and level up that it does change very quick.

2192
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:33,000
But, I also think that you guys are just a cut above, to be quite honest.

2193
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:33,760
So...

2194
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,820
There's not too much they can do.

2195
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,120
Yeah.

2196
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,500
What if I just pull a Bison as well?

2197
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,540
A Bison mirror match.

2198
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,380
Pull out Bison?

2199
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,680
Bison modern.

2200
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,400
That would be really, really not thinking Doki.

2201
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,720
She won't be ready.

2202
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,160
A mirror match.

2203
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,860
How can she be ready?

2204
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:57,900
Right, I wonder how.

2205
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah, if I just do the same thing she's doing then, like, I'll just mirror it fully.

2206
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,640
Mm-hmm.

2207
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,000
Doki, just don't think, just gif.

2208
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,600
Don't think, okay.

2209
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,860
I'll try my best.

2210
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,440
Everyone in her chat starts spamming, don't think, just gif.

2211
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,320
Yeah.

2212
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,860
All she does is jump.

2213
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,040
Yeah, but what if she just stops jumping?

2214
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,820
Then you know how to play.

2215
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,800
Then you party.

2216
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,280
If she stops jumping, you party.

2217
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,080
You know what to do when she starts jumping.

2218
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,700
When she jumps, that's when I know I can party.

2219
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,260
Her jumping makes me happy.

2220
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:41,760
Well, that's good.

2221
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,360
We got this, we got this.

2222
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:48,200
You guys got this.

2223
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,780
I'm waiting for the invite.

2224
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:51,780
Yeah.

2225
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,120
Yeah, they're taking their time.

2226
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,620
Like, let's go.

2227
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,240
Let's go.

2228
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,440
Oh, it's cause it's gonna be streamed.

2229
01:09:59,440 --> 01:09:59,880
That's why.

2230
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,460
That's why they're waiting for SageM to get ready.

2231
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,300
And everything.

2232
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,460
I hate being first match.

2233
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,400
Doki, my chat right now.

2234
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,620
You should look at it.

2235
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,020
What is your chat?

2236
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,400
BroadPro's chat is actually really funny.

2237
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:19,900
I like them.

2238
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,240
What is...

2239
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,780
Oh my god.

2240
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,900
That's your brain right now.

2241
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,300
My loyal fans.

2242
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,260
My loyal fans.

2243
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:33,920
My loyal fans.

2244
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,900
Look at them go, dude.

2245
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,600
Look at them go, dude.

2246
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,900
My loyal fans.

2247
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,840
My loyal fans.

2248
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,100
My loyal fans.

2249
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,580
Oh, did they send me in?

2250
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,300
I think they sent it out.

2251
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,520
Dude, that's such a great combo.

2252
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,500
How did they do that?

2253
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,040
That's great.

2254
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,040
Oh, yeah.

2255
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,400
They're Twitch monsters.

2256
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Damn, man.

2257
01:10:59,240 --> 01:10:59,940
That's so good.

2258
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,920
Chat, copy them.

2259
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,260
Let's do it.

2260
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,200
Yoink mine now.

2261
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:06,420
Copy it, dude.

2262
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,440
Yoink.

2263
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,520
For freaky-ass Twitch chat.

2264
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,180
Freaky-ass Twitch chat.

2265
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,490
I swear to god if I have to heads or tails this, I swear to god.

2266
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,750
Man, I'm gonna miss the heads or tails mind games, dude.

2267
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:35,110
That's gonna be something I will miss.

2268
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,570
I'm not gonna say anything until they're like heads or tails.

2269
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,730
She does better on P2 LMAO.

2270
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:49,230
She does better on P2 LMAO.

2271
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,090
You did go 5-0 last time.

2272
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:51,870
You did go 5-0 last time.

2273
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,510
No, I was swapping between P2 and P1.

2274
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,690
No, I was swapping between P2 and P1.

2275
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:57,650
I still hate P2.

2276
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,910
We're all close matches.

2277
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,170
I still hate P2.

2278
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,170
P2, you rolled them.

2279
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:04,930
You know.

2280
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,990
Alright.

2281
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:07,890
Good luck.

2282
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,750
Good luck.

2283
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,390
Let's go, Doki.

2284
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:13,890
Oh, she...

2285
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,370
Yeah, she doesn't...

2286
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,290
Oh, okay.

2287
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,650
I mean, that works.

2288
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,190
Nice.

2289
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:23,950
Oh, okay.

2290
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:24,750
Don't lock in.

2291
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:25,610
Don't lock in.

2292
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:27,990
Oh, whoa.

2293
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:30,190
Okay.

2294
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,030
Oh, yeah.

2295
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,270
You're in there.

2296
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,690
Let's go.

2297
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,770
Get in there.

2298
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:35,610
Oh.

2299
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:36,970
Okay.

2300
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:37,410
Oh,

2301
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:41,450
okay.

2302
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,910
Now I know for sure she's doing that.

2303
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,410
So, like, does Genji still suck?

2304
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,490
What's going on over there?

2305
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:49,870
What?

2306
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,230
Okay, no.

2307
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,670
We don't have these conversations.

2308
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:57,970
I think she was lying.

2309
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:58,730
Now I'm confused.

2310
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,530
Oh, lock that.

2311
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:03,290
Now you're confusing...

2312
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,090
I thought she was, like, Genji?

2313
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:07,290
You put Genji in her mind?

2314
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,570
Bro?

2315
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:11,030
We don't talk about that, though.

2316
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,770
Just have a casual Overwatch talk.

2317
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:15,230
Go ahead.

2318
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,070
Oh, the anti-airs.

2319
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,990
Okay.

2320
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,330
So, Hanzo, huh?

2321
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:23,290
The anti-airs are cute.

2322
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,910
Yeah, I hear they're brothers.

2323
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,190
One has a sword, one has a bow.

2324
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,150
No way.

2325
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:35,610
Yeah.

2326
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,670
Pretty crazy, actually.

2327
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,250
They actually have a sister, too, now.

2328
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,650
Do they have a sister now?

2329
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,570
What?

2330
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:45,590
Kiriko, I thought was, like, a friend.

2331
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:46,770
Yeah.

2332
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:48,390
I thought she was a sister.

2333
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:50,930
No, because it's, like, a friend.

2334
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,810
No, because, like, she's, like, from a different family.

2335
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,010
You're an Overwatch streamer!

2336
01:13:56,250 --> 01:14:01,950
You think she actually cares about Overwatch story?

2337
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:02,510
Wait, do you?

2338
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:06,270
I don't think anybody cares about Overwatch story anymore.

2339
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:06,770
You're like a fighting game player.

2340
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,410
We don't care about Free Fighter lore, dude.

2341
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,050
We just beat ass.

2342
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,070
I care about Reyna lore.

2343
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:12,050
Okay, that makes sense.

2344
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,910
She's not part of the family?

2345
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,870
No, she's never been, yeah.

2346
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:20,090
What the fuck?

2347
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:22,830
No, she's literally a different person.

2348
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,950
Oh.

2349
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:27,930
Okay.

2350
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:29,530
Oh, nice.

2351
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,070
That's cool.

2352
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,610
She's adapting.

2353
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,650
And she stopped jumping.

2354
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,470
Oh my god.

2355
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:46,190
That was sick.

2356
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,610
Is there anybody else that's, like, a family member in Overwatch?

2357
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,190
Hanzo and Genji?

2358
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,630
Well, other than that.

2359
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,370
I mean, like, other than them.

2360
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:56,710
That's the obvious one.

2361
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,910
Oh, Brig and Torbjorn.

2362
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,950
Oh yeah, Dottie.

2363
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,350
Which one's Brig?

2364
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,930
Brigitte, with the shield.

2365
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:08,350
Oh, I think I left before she came out.

2366
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:10,250
She ruined Overwatch.

2367
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:11,330
That's what everyone says.

2368
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:12,190
Really?

2369
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,310
I thought it was the hamster.

2370
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:13,530
I agree.

2371
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,470
No, no.

2372
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:17,710
Hamster sucks.

2373
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,350
Oh, the hamster sucks.

2374
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:20,690
Sucks.

2375
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,560
Oh.

2376
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,520
Just press square.

2377
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:32,840
Okay.

2378
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,960
Down square, down square.

2379
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:35,860
Whoa.

2380
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,440
Oh,

2381
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,270
no.

2382
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:42,770
Ah.

2383
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:46,310
Yeah, you just gotta press square when they're like that.

2384
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:46,590
Yeah.

2385
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,750
When they're super low health, just jab.

2386
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:51,050
Just hit their team, you know?

2387
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,370
Just when you're crouching, press square.

2388
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,170
Like you're doing the big moves when they're low health.

2389
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:57,090
Just keep playing your game.

2390
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:00,390
Keep talking about Overwatch and what the fuck is going on.

2391
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,770
I don't even understand.

2392
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:05,190
Nice, let's go.

2393
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:10,550
Nice.

2394
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:12,130
Good bait, good bait.

2395
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:14,210
There we go.

2396
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:15,370
Let's go, Dottie.

2397
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:20,150
Yes.

2398
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:24,830
Oh.

2399
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,230
Yeah, we just gotta block after we get hit.

2400
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:32,530
Good block.

2401
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,190
Okay.

2402
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:34,810
Good squares.

2403
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:36,270
See the squares?

2404
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,450
Yeah, you block and square and then you can play your game again.

2405
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:41,370
One of the best down squares in the game, Dottie.

2406
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,010
Just laying in on her.

2407
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:46,600
Ah.

2408
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,740
Sometimes she doesn't, so I'm like, I risk it sometimes.

2409
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,800
Which is not a good risk.

2410
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,180
Same thing.

2411
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,540
Yeah, it's fine.

2412
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,040
Oh, I think she hits that, right?

2413
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:58,320
Yeah.

2414
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,560
Yeah, she's gonna get the auto-combo, but she's burnt out, so...

2415
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,380
What do I do here?

2416
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,280
Block and square.

2417
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,520
Oh, nice jump.

2418
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,100
That's fine.

2419
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,640
Yep, now you can use DI also.

2420
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,060
What?

2421
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,060
You can use DI.

2422
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,480
No.

2423
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,340
No, I lost my thing, too.

2424
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,120
Oh, that was so close.

2425
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,180
That's alright, Dottie.

2426
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:21,640
Lock in.

2427
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,180
Let's do this.

2428
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,860
Go, Dottie.

2429
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:30,980
There you go.

2430
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,400
Nice.

2431
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,420
Get those triangles.

2432
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,040
Let's go.

2433
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:34,640
Careful with the meter and you're good.

2434
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:35,900
Don't think...

2435
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,820
Nice jump.

2436
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,660
Nice triangle.

2437
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:40,540
Let's go.

2438
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,380
Let's go.

2439
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,440
Get some meter back.

2440
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:46,980
Nice jump.

2441
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:47,580
Nice jump.

2442
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,200
Perfect jump.

2443
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:48,660
More Dottie.

2444
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:49,380
Let's do this.

2445
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,960
Go for it.

2446
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,540
Okay.

2447
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:54,980
Don't think.

2448
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:55,760
Just Dottie.

2449
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:01,170
Okay.

2450
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:02,970
Oh, no.

2451
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:03,430
Okay.

2452
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,170
That's cool.

2453
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:05,570
Does this hit?

2454
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:06,730
No.

2455
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,490
Just block here.

2456
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:09,830
Just block.

2457
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:11,870
That's fine.

2458
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:12,950
You're killing.

2459
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:15,730
No.

2460
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:17,270
No.

2461
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:18,810
She got it.

2462
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:19,710
That was close.

2463
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:22,830
Very close.

2464
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:28,470
Yeah, when they're low on life, you don't have to do the big moves.

2465
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:30,390
Yeah.

2466
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:32,590
Well, you started doing it.

2467
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:37,950
We stopped talking about Overwatch and that's what happened.

2468
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:38,330
That's true.

2469
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,190
You guys stopped talking about Overwatch.

2470
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:41,830
I started thinking again.

2471
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:44,770
She was in her happy place, you know.

2472
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,650
All those payload missions.

2473
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:48,150
Yeah.

2474
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,790
They all prepped for me.

2475
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:50,370
Let's go.

2476
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,070
She just likes to anti her a lot.

2477
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:56,150
So just be careful about the jumps and play your game.

2478
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,230
Get those medium punches.

2479
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,090
That was very close.

2480
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,890
I was so close.

2481
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:05,270
Good job.

2482
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,630
I believe.

2483
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,030
I believe.

2484
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,910
Me too, for once.

2485
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:12,610
I believe.

2486
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:13,350
Yes.

2487
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:14,090
Let's go.

2488
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:17,310
Your adaptation last game was crazy.

2489
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,450
That was ridiculous.

2490
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,050
Let's go.

2491
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:22,410
I'm pouty.

2492
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,250
Wait,

2493
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:27,950
what?

2494
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,670
A problem has occurred.

2495
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:32,690
I got that too.

2496
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,070
But it's working still.

2497
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,290
Nope.

2498
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,930
This time for sure.

2499
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:40,190
I'm still in the lobby though.

2500
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:41,750
We're still in the lobby.

2501
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,690
It hasn't started yet.

2502
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:45,190
A problem has occurred.

2503
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:48,110
I kicked you guys.

2504
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,630
Victoria is back in there.

2505
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:51,970
All right.

2506
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,030
Go ahead and try again.

2507
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:00,130
Don't forget to take a break.

2508
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,890
If you need something.

2509
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:03,990
Yeah.

2510
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,870
If it doesn't go well, we'll just take a break.

2511
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:06,530
Yeah.

2512
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,310
It's not working?

2513
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:10,470
You might have to remake the lobby.

2514
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,710
Yeah, a problem has occurred.

2515
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,370
Oh, is the lobby down?

2516
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,980
Sometimes two players just can't connect for some reason.

2517
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:23,900
Yeah.

2518
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,440
Yeah, try leaving and then coming back.

2519
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,560
Victoria is back in the lobby.

2520
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,340
SK is too, but it may persist.

2521
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,580
Oh, a save.

2522
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:45,780
Did we?

2523
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,100
Hmm.

2524
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,720
A problem has occurred.

2525
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,580
I think we have to remake the lobby.

2526
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,080
Remake the lobby.

2527
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:55,560
Yeah.

2528
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,680
I think they're going to try remaking the lobby.

2529
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,780
Yeah, that's what Claire said.

2530
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,840
She said if it doesn't work, we'll just remake it.

2531
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:01,540
Okay.

2532
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,340
Let's do it.

2533
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,080
You know what's funny about the coin flipping thing?

2534
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:25,260
Because the coaches are like, that's not a thing because only we were the main ones that, you know, kind of call for it sometimes.

2535
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,940
But the thing is, the other players will agree to it.

2536
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,920
They won't just be like, yeah, you can have your side.

2537
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,840
They also want their side.

2538
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,160
So I guess it is a thing.

2539
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,480
Oh, I got P1.

2540
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:40,520
Yeah.

2541
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,480
Let's go.

2542
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,520
It's P1, yeah.

2543
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,680
I'm good on both sides.

2544
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,680
Yeah, but you took the side that you know she's invested in.

2545
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,280
It's all about nerfing her.

2546
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:51,860
Exactly.

2547
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,480
Whatever you guys want to do.

2548
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,400
I do not understand.

2549
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:01,720
He's just in the back.

2550
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:04,900
It's Tekken coach.

2551
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,600
It's the Tekken in us.

2552
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,220
Are you sending invites yet?

2553
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,540
Or are you still making the room?

2554
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:19,700
Brian, if this was a hypothetical car like a Volkswagen or something, how many times would you pull over the car in this whole event?

2555
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,520
You know what?

2556
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,340
You guys aren't too bad.

2557
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,660
I'd give you disapproving looks in the rearview mirror, but that's about it.

2558
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,100
Oh, sweet.

2559
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,360
So no pullovers yet?

2560
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:31,780
Let's go.

2561
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:37,900
Maybe when you're talking about piss buff in the backseat, maybe then I'd pull over and force us to go to a rest stop.

2562
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,540
But other than that, we're good.

2563
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,380
But what about the one and dones?

2564
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,740
Why the piss buff?

2565
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:45,140
I mean, cause that's way worse.

2566
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,980
Yeah, I think for my next game, you can't let me focus.

2567
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,620
I'm thinking too much again.

2568
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,580
The moment I start focusing, it's over.

2569
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,600
You know, are you sure about that?

2570
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:08,340
Cause I feel like you won when I was barking random commands before, and I tried to let you play this time, and then you keep waking up with level 2 super and new things that I've never seen you do before.

2571
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:14,540
I think like I just can't have like no talk, like when people stop talking, that's when I get in my head.

2572
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,280
Yeah, so normally I'm yelling at you what to do almost.

2573
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:25,840
I'm saying block, block, block, block, square, square, square, square, and then you do that and yeah, but like this time, like you're waking up with stuff that is getting you killed when normally you just kind of chill.

2574
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:26,840
Yeah, yeah.

2575
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,640
And I think, so do you want me to bark commands?

2576
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,220
I'll do that.

2577
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:36,900
I do like, I like like not too much backseating cause like then I start thinking too much about what I'm doing.

2578
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:37,360
Sure.

2579
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,680
I like what, I don't know, I don't remember what we were doing like two days ago, but like that was like the optimal for me.

2580
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:44,160
Okay.

2581
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:44,760
Gotcha.

2582
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,600
Whatever that was.

2583
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,080
We'll find the flow.

2584
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:49,620
Alright.

2585
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,120
Are you in there, SK?

2586
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,720
Uh, Victoria's gonna do a mission error.

2587
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,280
Yeah, she needs to restart.

2588
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,880
She might need to restart the game.

2589
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,560
Yeah.

2590
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,320
I think I'm stuck in this screen.

2591
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:04,880
Oh, nevermind.

2592
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,460
You could, you could try to restart too, SK.

2593
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,380
I don't know.

2594
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:09,860
Okay.

2595
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,620
I restarted or, ah, fuck it.

2596
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,800
Oh, if you already did, then you're good, but...

2597
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,980
Nah, it was right before the, right before we joined the lobby the first time.

2598
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,390
Yeah, CFN be doing this sometimes.

2599
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,930
Just falls apart.

2600
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:43,210
I'm gonna play some Path of Exile after this.

2601
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:44,150
I can't wait.

2602
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:48,930
Have you guys been stressed all week long?

2603
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:49,810
Yeah.

2604
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,410
Yes.

2605
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:51,050
Yes.

2606
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:55,050
You guys have been putting in a lot of work, so you should feel proud either way.

2607
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,170
You too, Coach.

2608
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:58,950
You guys learned a lot in the past week.

2609
01:24:59,070 --> 01:24:59,350
Yeah.

2610
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:02,230
Making videos that aren't watched, that can't be watched or anything.

2611
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:02,630
Very true.

2612
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,690
You know, documents that aren't read.

2613
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:09,030
That video started getting a bunch of comments from, ah, from Doki's fans.

2614
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:09,930
They found it.

2615
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:10,750
It's unlisted.

2616
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,770
They're like, Coach, if Doki won't watch it, we will.

2617
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,890
I was like that.

2618
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:17,290
I was like that.

2619
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:21,730
Wdragoons, bro.

2620
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,200
Alright.

2621
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,520
Please make a public coach.

2622
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,220
Go easy on me.

2623
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,300
I like Reyna too.

2624
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,520
Oh, did they send the invites out?

2625
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:43,640
No.

2626
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:44,660
Not yet.

2627
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,620
It's the same invite.

2628
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,560
I don't have it.

2629
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,940
Yeah, I don't have it.

2630
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:49,860
I don't have it.

2631
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,120
Maybe you guys should not start yet.

2632
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:54,840
Hold on.

2633
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,720
Maybe we should go with the second...

2634
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,900
the third match?

2635
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,660
See?

2636
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,580
That's not working.

2637
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:04,480
If you have an invite from Klair, join that, but...

2638
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,060
I don't have any invite.

2639
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,240
These two are trying to start right away.

2640
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,760
And it keeps failing.

2641
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,160
But no one else is in the lobby, so we should get everyone in the lobby also.

2642
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,060
Interesting.

2643
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,900
Hmm.

2644
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:20,160
Is it Klair's Should we get somebody else making it?

2645
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,980
I restarted my game but the error still kept going.

2646
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,320
And SK, you restarted your game too?

2647
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,820
Are you getting the error too, SK?

2648
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:31,780
Or is it just her?

2649
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,340
I should try the battle hub maybe.

2650
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:35,680
I don't know.

2651
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,020
Battle hub?

2652
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,460
We're going...

2653
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,260
We're running the next match.

2654
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:44,460
Uh oh.

2655
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,040
Okay.

2656
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:46,220
We're running Brawl's match.

2657
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,700
Well, we're going to skip for now.

2658
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,480
Alright, skip I guess.

2659
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,820
Alright, Brawl's match.

2660
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,320
Well, let's get everyone in the lobby.

2661
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,320
I don't know why no one's in the lobby.

2662
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:59,000
I don't have an invite.

2663
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,000
I don't either.

2664
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,600
Got that on lock, huh?

2665
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:14,280
That looks like Myspace, doesn't it?

2666
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:17,100
I don't know if anyone's as old as me.

2667
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,180
I've never been on Myspace or know what it looks like.

2668
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,200
But I heard of it.

2669
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,540
Wait, how old are you, Ko?

2670
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,940
I haven't actually officially said on the internet how old I am.

2671
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,900
I'll keep it ambiguous.

2672
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:31,920
That's cool, man.

2673
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,280
I got the...

2674
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,140
I can tell you like...

2675
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,550
I'm 61, yes.

2676
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:40,950
Correct.

2677
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:42,250
Someone said, so he's old.

2678
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:47,730
Alright, it is Brawl Pro versus GP.

2679
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,030
Are you in Brawl Pro?

2680
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,330
Yes, I'm in.

2681
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:56,970
Brawl Pro playing Wipeout.

2682
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,090
Alright, man.

2683
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,310
Gotta get through the obstacle course.

2684
01:27:59,310 --> 01:27:59,650
I gotta remember.

2685
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:01,930
Don't be scared of Driver Shin.

2686
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,270
Driver Shin is sweet, baby.

2687
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:05,390
And threaten your jumps up close.

2688
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:08,150
Oh, right.

2689
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:09,870
We can't skip because...

2690
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:12,410
Oh, wait.

2691
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,390
So we're not doing the next match?

2692
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:15,610
Oh.

2693
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:18,570
No, I thought we were doing Brawl Pro's match.

2694
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:21,590
No, SolidBone said we can't skip.

2695
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:22,890
Yeah.

2696
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,290
They're gonna have to walk you guys through making a lobby.

2697
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,450
Oh, God.

2698
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:34,640
Can't skip.

2699
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:35,600
We got a problem solved.

2700
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,960
So maybe they're just gonna watch one of your streams.

2701
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:39,660
Possibly.

2702
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,960
I don't know.

2703
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,080
They better not watch my stream.

2704
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,400
I'm running copyrighted music.

2705
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,680
They're gonna get owned if they watch my stream.

2706
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:54,860
I am too.

2707
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,380
Yeah.

2708
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:15,230
We just queue-sniped each other.

2709
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:17,290
Yeah.

2710
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:17,790
Nice.

2711
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:19,790
Or the same rank.

2712
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:20,110
Might take all day.

2713
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,430
Have you ran into each other in ranks?

2714
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:25,550
No, I haven't ran into anyone.

2715
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:26,650
Okay.

2716
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:27,570
That'd be crazy.

2717
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:40,530
And then if this doesn't work, maybe Battle Hub.

2718
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:41,370
Yeah.

2719
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,750
Because me and Amor had the issue.

2720
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:44,390
And it worked out.

2721
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:44,810
Battle Hub.

2722
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:47,550
I don't know why it's not working.

2723
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:48,990
Yeah, let's settle it with points.

2724
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:51,710
Why aren't we doing the third match though?

2725
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:53,670
I don't know.

2726
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:54,390
They want to go in order.

2727
01:29:54,790 --> 01:30:00,390
It's like if it goes 3-0 or like 1-3 or something like this.

2728
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:01,170
Yeah, it influences.

2729
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:02,330
Like the match could end early.

2730
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:03,310
Yeah.

2731
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:07,950
Okay, gotcha.

2732
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:09,970
Yeah, I think they want us to just watch your streams.

2733
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,830
Okay.

2734
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,770
Oh, so it's just a private stream?

2735
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:16,110
Yeah, just to try to make it happen.

2736
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:17,990
You're sharing on Discord?

2737
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:18,330
Yeah.

2738
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,610
That way there's no lag.

2739
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:21,490
Perfect.

2740
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:21,750
I guess.

2741
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,870
Oh, share on Discord?

2742
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:23,550
That'd be great.

2743
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:23,870
Yeah.

2744
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,470
If I'm lagging though, I'm going to turn it off.

2745
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:28,210
Sometimes the screen share makes me lag.

2746
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,490
Oh, then make it like the lowest possible resolution.

2747
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,790
Yeah, you're doing 1080p 60 FPS.

2748
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,770
You can definitely lower the resolution to at least 720.

2749
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:36,090
Yeah.

2750
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:36,390
Just make it.

2751
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:37,310
Give us PowerPoint.

2752
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:38,530
So it doesn't affect you.

2753
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:39,310
I mean, it's 720.

2754
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:40,330
Yeah.

2755
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:41,710
I don't think it makes a difference though.

2756
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:44,490
It's usually just like it happens or it doesn't.

2757
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:45,150
Okay.

2758
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:45,830
Yeah.

2759
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,930
If it happens, let's cut it out.

2760
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,530
For sure.

2761
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:49,030
Yeah.

2762
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:50,950
We'll just pull up your Twitch channel.

2763
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,310
Oh, you're in there.

2764
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:52,870
Let's go.

2765
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:53,470
Let's go, SK.

2766
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:54,250
All right.

2767
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:54,870
Let's do this.

2768
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:55,770
Play your game.

2769
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,170
You got this.

2770
01:30:58,170 --> 01:30:59,290
I believe.

2771
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:00,450
Okay.

2772
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:01,550
Play your game.

2773
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,240
Slideshow time.

2774
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,020
Oh my God.

2775
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:36,640
The slideshow.

2776
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,400
Nice parry.

2777
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:41,500
Okay.

2778
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:44,340
Nice.

2779
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,080
Get in there.

2780
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,280
Okay.

2781
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:53,620
Nice.

2782
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,440
Nice parry.

2783
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,310
Oh, nice try.

2784
01:31:59,490 --> 01:31:59,990
Nice try.

2785
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:00,670
Nice try.

2786
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:01,050
Nice try.

2787
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:02,550
No worries.

2788
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:02,810
No worries.

2789
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:03,190
Time to throw.

2790
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,970
After the grab, remember, she's plus.

2791
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,730
She can move first.

2792
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:07,010
Okay.

2793
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:07,850
Yeah.

2794
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:09,290
I was trying to throw break at that time.

2795
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:10,070
Yeah.

2796
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:12,130
You can take throws sometimes.

2797
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:13,550
Yeah.

2798
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:14,030
Just don't jump.

2799
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:14,250
True.

2800
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:17,170
Nice.

2801
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:17,890
Let's go.

2802
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,200
Yep.

2803
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:30,780
That's fine.

2804
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,600
You're back to neutral now.

2805
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,060
Oh.

2806
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:36,120
Oh.

2807
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,080
Nice.

2808
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:38,860
Oh, nice.

2809
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:39,820
Nice combo.

2810
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:41,160
Let's go.

2811
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,040
Okay.

2812
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:44,340
Oops.

2813
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:45,680
That's cool.

2814
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:46,240
It's fine.

2815
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,060
Oh, I think I'm dead.

2816
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:48,820
Yeah.

2817
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:49,100
Yeah.

2818
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:49,760
Yeah.

2819
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,040
Okay.

2820
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:50,760
Let's...

2821
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:51,720
Let's...

2822
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,420
Do you want to back out?

2823
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:52,980
Yeah.

2824
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:53,400
Let's process.

2825
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:53,640
Let's back out.

2826
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:53,840
Yeah.

2827
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,680
Let's chill for a second.

2828
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,160
Okay.

2829
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:56,500
Yeah.

2830
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:58,360
Am I watching the stream?

2831
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,280
Just don't jump.

2832
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:00,980
No jumping.

2833
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:01,640
Play your game on the ground.

2834
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,680
Remember, your goal is to just get in there and press medium.

2835
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,000
And then when they finally block throw.

2836
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:05,960
That's all you're trying to do.

2837
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:06,520
Yeah.

2838
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,640
When you jump, they anti-air or you jump into the corner.

2839
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:09,480
There's...

2840
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,440
There's no reason to do that.

2841
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:11,240
So you don't...

2842
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,720
You don't need to jump at her at all.

2843
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:13,100
Okay.

2844
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,680
And then once your pressure ends, she's just going to match DI.

2845
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,780
So you get medium, medium and she blocks, she's just going to match DI.

2846
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,460
So just get your dry brush medium.

2847
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,940
If she blocks it, you try to throw.

2848
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,220
If not, it's cool.

2849
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,300
Just chill.

2850
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:27,480
And...

2851
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:27,960
Okay.

2852
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:28,460
Just counter.

2853
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:29,060
More neutral.

2854
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:30,960
But not in there.

2855
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,560
I'm not using the dry brush medium.

2856
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,220
You know what I mean?

2857
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:34,420
Just don't jump.

2858
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:34,520
Yeah.

2859
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:34,940
Just...

2860
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,560
The jumping is not going to work.

2861
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,560
Everything else you're doing, your basic flowchart will work against her.

2862
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,280
100%.

2863
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:41,340
Okay.

2864
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,000
She's just mashing on wake up.

2865
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:43,660
And you'll get...

2866
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,080
Good luck, SK.

2867
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,380
Let's do this.

2868
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:46,420
Let's go.

2869
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:47,720
Let's go.

2870
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,520
I'm not shaking at all for the first time.

2871
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:50,420
Let's go.

2872
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:50,940
Let's go.

2873
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,580
Let's go.

2874
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:52,540
Kill her eyes.

2875
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,340
I'll take these.

2876
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:57,320
That's right.

2877
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,120
Ooh!

2878
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,300
Get them!

2879
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:01,420
Nice.

2880
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:02,240
Let's go.

2881
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:03,040
That was beautiful.

2882
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:03,500
Huh?

2883
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:03,640
Huh?

2884
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:03,980
Huh?

2885
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:04,060
Huh?

2886
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:04,860
Uh-uh.

2887
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,020
Oh, I missed my timing.

2888
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:08,240
Okay.

2889
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:09,520
Cool.

2890
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,280
Oh, thank you.

2891
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:12,380
Yep.

2892
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,040
You're out of the corner.

2893
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:13,760
Careful with your drive.

2894
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:14,880
It'll let your...

2895
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,160
Yeah.

2896
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:15,600
Just chill.

2897
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,660
Nice.

2898
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:17,940
You got it.

2899
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:20,140
Just play safe.

2900
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:20,920
You're in burnout.

2901
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:25,140
Okay.

2902
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:37,750
Nice.

2903
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:38,170
Nice.

2904
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:39,330
Good recovery.

2905
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:42,310
Okay.

2906
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:43,730
Nice combo.

2907
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:46,210
Yeah.

2908
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:46,830
You just want to...

2909
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:47,030
Yeah.

2910
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:52,940
Cool.

2911
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:53,880
I jumped.

2912
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,240
That's okay.

2913
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,160
That's all right.

2914
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:56,440
It happens.

2915
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,400
Chill.

2916
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,060
Yeah.

2917
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,480
She's just mashing on wake up.

2918
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,120
You just want to...

2919
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,280
No!

2920
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:01,940
Don't even throw her.

2921
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,620
Just driverish medium.

2922
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,760
You just want to press medium.

2923
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:04,580
Okay.

2924
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,140
Play your game.

2925
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:06,380
No

2926
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:21,580
worries.

2927
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:22,920
Yep.

2928
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,400
All good.

2929
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:27,380
Nice jumping.

2930
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:30,420
Let's go.

2931
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:31,700
Ooh!

2932
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,040
Nice.

2933
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:32,920
Nice hits.

2934
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,040
Nice.

2935
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:35,600
Nice.

2936
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,180
Okay.

2937
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,160
I'm jumping.

2938
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:41,340
Nice.

2939
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,180
You got the momentum.

2940
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,240
She's also jumping.

2941
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:44,580
That's good.

2942
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,260
Yeah.

2943
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,020
Nice.

2944
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:47,820
Nice.

2945
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,300
Take her to that corner.

2946
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:51,680
See?

2947
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:53,420
Yeah.

2948
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,220
It might be too late though.

2949
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:56,620
Okay.

2950
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:56,980
No.

2951
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:57,600
You're good.

2952
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:57,840
You're good.

2953
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:57,960
You're in there.

2954
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,080
You're alive and you have level three.

2955
01:35:59,200 --> 01:35:59,600
This is...

2956
01:35:59,600 --> 01:35:59,780
Yes.

2957
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,240
You're good.

2958
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:00,460
You're alive.

2959
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:01,420
Oh, I'm going to kill with one hit.

2960
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:02,220
Yes.

2961
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:02,620
Yes.

2962
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,260
Don't worry about it.

2963
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,060
Just stay...

2964
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:04,880
Stay in the game.

2965
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,240
You're in the game.

2966
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:06,480
You got this.

2967
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:07,680
I believe.

2968
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:17,670
No!

2969
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:18,830
Good try.

2970
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:19,190
Good try.

2971
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:19,810
Oh, nice try.

2972
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:20,470
Nice try.

2973
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:21,710
Good try.

2974
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,050
Good try.

2975
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:22,430
Good try.

2976
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,170
You tried.

2977
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:24,670
It's okay.

2978
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,110
It's okay.

2979
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:26,330
Damn.

2980
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:27,550
You played really well.

2981
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:28,270
The lobby took us out of the flow.

2982
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:30,590
Not bad.

2983
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:31,110
Playing modern...

2984
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:32,290
Modern players are...

2985
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:33,870
It's an anomaly, man.

2986
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,690
I wonder if the lobby works now.

2987
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:38,830
Yeah.

2988
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:40,730
Let's see if the lobby works.

2989
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:41,370
Dang.

2990
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,210
Good try though.

2991
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:43,530
Alrighty.

2992
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:47,010
Well, here we go.

2993
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:47,570
We're still in this.

2994
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:48,810
We're still in this.

2995
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:49,250
Absolutely.

2996
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:50,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2997
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:50,550
I believe.

2998
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:51,070
We got 100%.

2999
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:51,630
No worries.

3000
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:51,930
We got this.

3001
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:52,810
I believe in our last three.

3002
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,830
Yes.

3003
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:54,790
We got this, dude.

3004
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:57,430
They're all mortal.

3005
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:59,490
They can all bleed.

3006
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:00,490
Yeah.

3007
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,120
Alright.

3008
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:06,840
You got this, BP.

3009
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,180
Just don't hate me.

3010
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,040
No, no.

3011
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:13,940
Nah, man.

3012
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,120
No pressure.

3013
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,360
No, it won't be, man.

3014
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:19,380
Even if it doesn't work out, we can still take it through losers.

3015
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:22,820
I think you're going to smoke, first of all.

3016
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,120
I actually think that.

3017
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:25,860
Second of all, no pressure.

3018
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:31,600
I feel no more pressure after that.

3019
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,080
No pressure.

3020
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,140
The super TF slot is brutal.

3021
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,660
Yeah, I got the super slot.

3022
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,900
The third one.

3023
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:42,420
Super.

3024
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:43,500
Super slot.

3025
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:44,280
Super slot.ds Can they get the...

3026
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:44,280
know what I'm talking about.

3027
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,320
Are they sending invites out yet, right?

3028
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,680
Oh, there they are.

3029
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,620
They're going up now.

3030
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,020
Oh, okay.

3031
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,120
We sent one to me.

3032
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:50,840
Let's see.

3033
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,500
There we go.

3034
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,640
All right.

3035
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,920
It's reverse sweep, baby.

3036
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,360
Okay.

3037
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:56,740
I got it.

3038
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,300
I believe.

3039
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,500
Let me know when I can start.

3040
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,300
They're still sending invites.

3041
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:13,860
Yeah.

3042
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,800
Because is waiting.

3043
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,220
I think everyone's all mixed up.

3044
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:19,960
Yeah.

3045
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,460
People are slowly coming in.

3046
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,960
I believe... in the reverse sweep.

3047
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,420
SK, you stop shaking.

3048
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,900
I'm still shaking.

3049
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,040
But it's cool.

3050
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,260
You just got to remember that they're scared shitless of Keef running at them.

3051
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:58,980
Oh yeah.

3052
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,700
You have the scary character.

3053
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:04,280
Even when they're trying to fight you off, they're terrified of you approaching.

3054
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:07,380
So just remember they're scared of you.

3055
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:10,040
That's right.

3056
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,180
Alright, y'all can game.

3057
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:15,720
They're all here.

3058
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,520
Let's do it.

3059
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,020
Let's do it.

3060
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:20,420
I'm ready.

3061
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,100
Let's go!

3062
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,040
I believe, raw pro.

3063
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:24,800
I believe, I believe.

3064
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,000
Alright.

3065
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,080
Alright.

3066
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,180
I believe.

3067
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:38,920
Hands up.

3068
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:39,380
I believe.

3069
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:42,680
Let's do this.

3070
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,300
Look at that smile.

3071
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,060
Super speed.

3072
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:50,920
Here we go.

3073
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,520
Make sure to quick rise if you get knocked down.

3074
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,940
Don't press buttons when you get knocked down.

3075
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:12,680
Nice.

3076
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,260
Good defense.

3077
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:14,480
Okay, control.

3078
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:15,200
You got this.

3079
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:16,720
Fuck.

3080
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,020
That's fine.

3081
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:18,520
You got the corner.

3082
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:20,180
Nice.

3083
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:20,380
Exactly.

3084
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,060
There you go, Larry.

3085
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,900
They just want to jump out over and over.

3086
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,500
Okay, that was fun.

3087
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:27,380
Nice!

3088
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:28,620
So smart.

3089
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,020
Let's go.

3090
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:29,380
Exactly.

3091
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:32,280
Yes, good control.

3092
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,160
Just keep them in that corner.

3093
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:34,640
That's fine.

3094
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:37,780
No worries.

3095
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,280
Nice.

3096
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,540
Dry brush in there.

3097
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:44,580
It's okay.

3098
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,360
Alright, alright, alright.

3099
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:47,700
No worries.

3100
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:48,860
But you got the game plan.

3101
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:49,500
You got the rhythm.

3102
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,420
You're feeling it out.

3103
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,280
If they put the mid oil, don't dry brush.

3104
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,200
But other than that, you're good.

3105
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:54,100
You're going to get in the flow.

3106
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:55,420
Yes.

3107
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:55,560
Yeah.

3108
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:57,420
It's okay.

3109
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:57,900
Just block.

3110
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,060
Yeah.

3111
01:40:59,480 --> 01:40:59,960
You're good.

3112
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:01,620
Okay.

3113
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:03,780
Yep.

3114
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,020
That's fine.

3115
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:06,220
It's alright.

3116
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,480
See, they're going to start teleporting.

3117
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,780
So just chill in the parry.

3118
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,120
Okay.

3119
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:11,500
Just parry.

3120
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,420
Yeah, you have to parry the fireballs, but you're good.

3121
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,000
Nice.

3122
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,820
Alright, you're in there.

3123
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:20,180
There we go.

3124
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:20,940
Control that corner.

3125
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:26,960
Alright, there we go.

3126
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,300
Let's go.

3127
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:27,720
They're scared now.

3128
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:35,830
They messed up.

3129
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:37,150
Just control.

3130
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,030
They're going to try and jump out.

3131
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:40,270
Just get the guarantee on you.

3132
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:40,790
Yes!

3133
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:41,470
Yes!

3134
01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:42,010
Yes sir!

3135
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:42,270
Get him!

3136
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,590
Oh my god.

3137
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:44,410
That's cool.

3138
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:44,750
That's cool.

3139
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:45,870
Combo draw.

3140
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:47,270
That's alright dude.

3141
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:47,850
That's fine.

3142
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:48,750
That's cool.

3143
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:49,490
Do you want to take a breather?

3144
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:50,050
Take a breather.

3145
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:50,930
No, it's fine.

3146
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:51,330
It's fine.

3147
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:54,250
Okay, just make sure to not press buttons when you're knocked down and you got this.

3148
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:54,950
Yeah.

3149
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,180
Nice block.

3150
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:05,780
Okay.

3151
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,500
Oh yeah, you're doing good.

3152
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,160
Oh yeah, you're doing good.

3153
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,040
Nice.

3154
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,400
Bro, I hate this character.

3155
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,040
Bro, I hate this character.

3156
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,840
Yeah, this character is obnoxious.

3157
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:29,880
Drive rush.

3158
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,440
Drive rush.

3159
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,980
After this pierce, they're going to throw fireballs.

3160
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:33,680
Yep, there it is.

3161
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,800
Okay, that's fine.

3162
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:43,080
I feel like I've just seen like two moves.

3163
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,440
I feel like I've just seen like two moves.

3164
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,360
Yeah.

3165
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:48,440
Just make sure to just try the drive rush.

3166
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:51,940
Don't always parry, but when you do parry, look for the portal and just drive rush.

3167
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:53,940
Get in there amigo.

3168
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:54,720
Yes.

3169
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:54,940
Yes.

3170
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,340
Don't be...

3171
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,200
Wait for this.

3172
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:56,720
Parry it out.

3173
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:57,480
Yes.

3174
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:57,840
Nice.

3175
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:58,900
There you go.

3176
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,900
Get in there dude.

3177
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:01,900
You're playing too slow.

3178
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:02,520
Scrap it up.

3179
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:02,940
Let's go.

3180
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:03,740
Let's go!

3181
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:04,960
Let's go.

3182
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,820
Get in there amigo.

3183
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:12,300
Yep.

3184
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:12,700
Okay.

3185
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,020
That's the game.

3186
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:15,500
There you go.

3187
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:16,020
There we go.

3188
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:16,420
Easy.

3189
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,180
It's the round.

3190
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:19,160
Yeah, just don't be scared to go in.

3191
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:22,840
Nice!

3192
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,760
They're so scared now.

3193
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:28,560
Alright.

3194
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,060
That's cool.

3195
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:29,400
That's cool.

3196
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:30,600
Cool.

3197
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:31,840
Whatever.

3198
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,460
That was a tickle.

3199
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:34,700
Yes.

3200
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:37,080
Nice.

3201
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,560
They just always want to jump out.

3202
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,300
Let's go!

3203
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,260
Party time!

3204
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:45,460
Party time baby!

3205
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:46,120
Let's go!

3206
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,980
See, all they want to do is jump out.

3207
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:48,480
You got this.

3208
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:48,900
You know.

3209
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:49,520
You know what to do now.

3210
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,500
You know what to do.

3211
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:51,700
Let's go.

3212
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:01,310
It's alright.

3213
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:05,810
It's alright.

3214
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:09,350
It's alright.

3215
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:12,050
Get in there.

3216
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,470
Just chill.

3217
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:14,110
Just chill for a second.

3218
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:15,710
When they have double portal, just chill.

3219
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:16,190
But you're good.

3220
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:17,090
Now you can drive rush in.

3221
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:19,490
Is that overhead?

3222
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:20,370
Yes.

3223
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,530
You need to parry the fireballs.

3224
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:23,490
Good.

3225
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:24,050
You're in there.

3226
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:24,470
Nice!

3227
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:25,830
They're going to want to jump.

3228
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:26,530
Just remember that.

3229
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:26,810
Yep.

3230
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:29,550
Yes sir!

3231
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,070
Control the corner.

3232
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:34,570
Oh no way.

3233
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:35,610
It's cool.

3234
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:35,970
It's cool.

3235
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:36,570
Control the corner.

3236
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:37,310
Yep.

3237
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:40,790
Yes sir!

3238
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:42,150
Parry.

3239
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:42,510
Hold parry.

3240
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:42,890
Hold parry.

3241
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:44,850
That's alright.

3242
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:46,390
Yes!

3243
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:46,970
Oh nice hit!

3244
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:48,050
Hold that corner.

3245
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:50,710
Hold parry.

3246
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:51,730
Sorry.

3247
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:54,430
Alright.

3248
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:56,050
Okay.

3249
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:56,370
Okay.

3250
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:56,530
Okay.

3251
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:57,250
I see.

3252
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:58,870
You're seeing it.

3253
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:00,470
Wait a second and then hold parry.

3254
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:01,410
Other than that you're doing great.

3255
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:06,660
Nice!

3256
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,120
Nice!

3257
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:10,120
Uh huh.

3258
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,420
That was your time to drive rush.

3259
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,160
After the fireball you can drive rush.

3260
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,360
Wait this out.

3261
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:24,580
There.

3262
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,240
Get in there.

3263
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,300
There it is.

3264
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:26,520
Okay.

3265
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:26,940
Just chill.

3266
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,300
Just chill.

3267
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:30,720
Okay.

3268
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,260
That was good.

3269
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:31,740
Good.

3270
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:32,100
Nice.

3271
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,000
Nice parry.

3272
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:33,900
Okay.

3273
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:35,940
Cool.

3274
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,520
I believe.

3275
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:37,980
Let's go bro.

3276
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,160
Bro.

3277
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:43,960
Oh I'm going to get shipped out.

3278
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,860
Get in there Migos.

3279
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,420
You're good.

3280
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,620
Just jump out.

3281
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:49,580
Aw.

3282
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:50,520
Nice try.

3283
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:51,020
That was pretty nice.

3284
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:51,480
GG.

3285
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:51,960
GG.

3286
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:53,200
Sorry.

3287
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,680
Yeah.

3288
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,280
It's tough.

3289
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:57,140
Did your best.

3290
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,600
That's alright.

3291
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,260
It's okay.

3292
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:00,720
You tried.

3293
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,020
That was...

3294
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:03,500
God this character is so lame.

3295
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,900
I watched that and I'm like I'm mad at this character.

3296
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:08,720
Yeah.

3297
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,000
No.

3298
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:10,440
I'm upset at that character.

3299
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,800
That character doesn't look fun to play at all.

3300
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,280
No dude.

3301
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,040
Alright.

3302
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:15,380
GG.

3303
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:15,860
GG.

3304
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,720
Do we go straight into our next match?

3305
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:19,640
Or is there a buffer?

3306
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:22,900
Who do we play?

3307
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:23,600
We play against...

3308
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:24,480
Diaphone.

3309
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,500
They're probably going to play on stream.

3310
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,260
So we probably got a long break.

3311
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:29,980
Oh actually no.

3312
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:30,900
We might not.

3313
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,740
We're going straight away.

3314
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:34,680
Okay.

3315
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,740
So we're doing losers.

3316
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:39,100
So if we win this we're going to Twitchcon.

3317
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:39,820
We're done for the day.

3318
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:43,860
Do they...

3319
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:44,520
I guess so right?

3320
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,760
They're only doing losers round one.

3321
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:48,660
Okay.

3322
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,100
So who are these players against?

3323
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,460
Amore, PDX, BoxBox, Diaphone.

3324
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:53,960
Okay.

3325
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:56,560
We know these players.

3326
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,380
Is Amore actually playing Honda now?

3327
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,020
Or is that just...

3328
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:01,520
I don't know.

3329
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:03,640
Can we pull up her stream and see?

3330
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:05,120
I doubt it.

3331
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,140
I think she played Honda versus Atlink.

3332
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:10,480
Interesting.

3333
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,660
Is it the same lobby?

3334
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,000
Or is it a different lobby?

3335
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:18,660
They will tell us.

3336
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:19,080
Let's see.

3337
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:23,500
Time to beat Saekuno again Doki.

3338
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,640
You know what to do.

3339
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,280
You know what to do.

3340
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,140
You gave him emotional damage.

3341
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:30,480
And he'll permanently stay there.

3342
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,240
I think he's playing Cammy.

3343
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,000
I think.

3344
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,640
Because Punk gave him Cammy.

3345
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,360
Geek counters with Cammy.

3346
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:38,880
That don't matter.

3347
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,880
I think we have to wait for that.

3348
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,500
They're going to run the other team first.

3349
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:45,160
Are they going to run winners finals first?

3350
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,500
They're running winners finals?

3351
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,480
It looks like they're doing automatic JV right now.

3352
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:49,060
Okay.

3353
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,620
So we got a break.

3354
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:54,300
Alright guys.

3355
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,040
It's time to practice classic Cammy.

3356
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:00,000
Do you know how to not back roll?

3357
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,320
I definitely...

3358
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,780
Okay, we're back at it again.

3359
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:04,940
Not...

3360
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,280
Look up...

3361
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,480
Not Doki...

3362
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,480
Uh...

3363
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:16,200
For...

3364
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:17,900
The...

3365
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,500
Custom room.

3366
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:21,340
I think it's also the vibes.

3367
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:24,200
The vibes is like much more stressful.

3368
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:27,160
Only playing against...

3369
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:29,020
Um...

3370
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:29,780
Cammy.

3371
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,080
Classic Cammy.

3372
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:34,060
It's like the vibes too.

3373
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:35,960
And...

3374
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,960
Uh...

3375
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:39,720
It's like...

3376
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,400
Yeah, the vibes are way too serious.

3377
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,780
I don't fuck with these vibes.

3378
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:45,960
It's like...

3379
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,320
It's like a combination of everything.

3380
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,240
Cause like now a lot of people are depending on me to win.

3381
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,600
And like in the past...

3382
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,940
You know, it's just whatever.

3383
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:56,940
What happens to me doesn't matter.

3384
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:57,520
Like...

3385
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,420
Yeah, it's just way...

3386
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,720
Everybody's like super quiet.

3387
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,620
And every...

3388
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:08,160
And then like I'm not worried about saying stuff.

3389
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:11,320
Because like everybody is so serious and focused.

3390
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,100
So then it's fucking with me too.

3391
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:14,440
Uh...

3392
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:15,880
So like...

3393
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,300
It's like...

3394
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,940
It's like fucking with me.

3395
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:20,120
Like the vibes in general.

3396
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:22,540
Like everybody is so...

3397
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,600
Like I understand why.

3398
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,920
But like...

3399
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,700
It's like affecting how I play.

3400
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:28,980
So...

3401
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,720
Cause like my vibes are like...

3402
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,000
Oh I need to be serious now.

3403
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,040
Like...

3404
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,940
Oh I need to be serious.

3405
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:41,580
Um...

3406
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:44,040
Cause I'm trying to be vibey too.

3407
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,100
But then like...

3408
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,460
No one's talking.

3409
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:48,240
It's only...

3410
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,680
It's only me and Ko trying to talk.

3411
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:51,460
And I'm like...

3412
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:52,640
I don't know what to do.

3413
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:01,520
And like I get so nervous too.

3414
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:03,320
I get really nervous.

3415
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,460
And I can't...

3416
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,300
Uh...

3417
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,800
It's so hard for me to...

3418
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,760
Lock in.

3419
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:13,100
Cause I play better when I'm like...

3420
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,840
Super casual.

3421
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,860
So like...

3422
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:19,580
When it's not casual...

3423
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:21,560
It just... It fucks with me so much.

3424
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:22,700
Yeah.

3425
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,480
We need Kony.

3426
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,440
Can I call Kony?

3427
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:27,400
I'd be like...

3428
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,100
Kony I need a vibe check right now.

3429
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,580
I need a vibe check.

3430
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:36,160
I can't.

3431
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,920
I'm definitely learning a lot.

3432
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,360
I think like...

3433
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:42,860
Cause like my enjoyment...

3434
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:45,160
Of these tournaments heavily depends...

3435
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,900
On the vibes of the team.

3436
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:50,760
Like when things get too serious I just...

3437
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,000
I also crumble.

3438
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:54,420
Because it's like...

3439
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,400
Cause it's like...

3440
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:56,960
Oh no.

3441
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,640
I crumble...

3442
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,480
Really hard when things get like...

3443
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,260
Super serious.

3444
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:11,330
Yeah.

3445
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:18,330
I didn't practice against Cammy at all today.

3446
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:18,710
I didn't practice against Cammy at all today.

3447
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:20,070
I didn't practice against Cammy at all today.

3448
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:23,450
I got like so in my head too.

3449
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:23,930
I got like so in my head too.

3450
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,690
I got like so in my head too.

3451
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:32,160
Like I was...

3452
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,620
I don't wanna say I crumbled.

3453
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:35,980
I was like over thinking a lot.

3454
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:37,100
When I'm...

3455
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:39,400
I need to mentally reset myself too.

3456
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,320
Cause like...

3457
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,960
I start over thinking about how to play.

3458
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:43,940
Because...

3459
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:44,800
Uh...

3460
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,440
Because I'm like...

3461
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,500
Oh okay are they gonna do that now?

3462
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,000
Because I did that last game?

3463
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:52,220
Or are they gonna...

3464
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:53,400
Uh...

3465
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:55,900
And then it's like...

3466
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:56,880
Uh...

3467
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,020
No I slept a lot.

3468
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,340
I've been sleeping way too much.

3469
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,880
I've been sleeping way too much too.

3470
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:05,980
I even get like coffee.

3471
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,480
But I'm still so...

3472
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,640
Like not tired but like...

3473
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:12,880
Uh...

3474
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:16,400
Okay.

3475
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,580
Let me make sure I'm doing what I usually do.

3476
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,200
Yeah I'm hesitating a lot too.

3477
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,060
Because I'm like...

3478
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,060
Oh are they gonna do that?

3479
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,320
Did they lab that?

3480
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,960
Like oh if I do this it used to work before.

3481
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,820
But like I'm also like really nervous.

3482
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:33,640
Because I know a lot of people...

3483
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:35,800
Labbed me too.

3484
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:37,300
So it's like...

3485
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,240
I'm like oh no.

3486
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,400
Like are they gonna...

3487
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:42,700
Doing this instead?

3488
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,520
Because they know that I wanna do this.

3489
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,740
So it's like...

3490
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:47,640
Ow my head is like so full.

3491
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,000
I don't know if Kony...

3492
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,520
I don't know if Kony is online.

3493
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,360
I'll call Kony.

3494
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,060
Yeah I just need team vibes.

3495
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:01,660
Honestly.

3496
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:05,880
I hope like the next matchup the team vibes would be...

3497
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,820
Better.

3498
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:10,380
Because everybody...

3499
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:11,300
Everybody is so serious.

3500
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,600
Everybody is so serious.

3501
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:15,540
Everybody is so serious.

3502
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,480
And I'm like...

3503
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,360
I'm nervous.

3504
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:19,340
I'm so nervous.

3505
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:23,100
Oh.

3506
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:25,320
Oh no.

3507
01:53:30,450 --> 01:53:32,030
Is he still on vacation?

3508
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:34,730
I don't know.

3509
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,210
Nice.

3510
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:41,250
Yeah.

3511
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:41,410
Yeah.

3512
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:44,230
Yeah I do better when everybody fucks around more.

3513
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:50,290
Because like...

3514
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:53,690
When we were spectating the last two games...

3515
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:54,350
I like...

3516
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:54,790
I don't know.

3517
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:56,190
Everybody was so quiet.

3518
01:53:56,490 --> 01:53:56,970
I don't...

3519
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:00,230
I'm like worried too of talking.

3520
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:01,590
Because nobody is talking.

3521
01:54:02,110 --> 01:54:02,630
So I...

3522
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:05,590
I get nervous.

3523
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:05,670
I get nervous.

3524
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:06,950
I get nervous.

3525
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:09,190
I get nervous.

3526
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:14,180
Yeah.

3527
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,900
Even though I was like...

3528
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:16,900
Guys no more Overwatch talk.

3529
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,440
I think the Overwatch talk was actually working.

3530
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:21,220
I actually was winning with the Overwatch talk.

3531
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:26,700
I actually was winning with the Overwatch talk.

3532
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:27,220
Don't think.

3533
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:31,700
Okay.

3534
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:32,500
Okay.

3535
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,580
Yeah it was.

3536
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:36,120
Yeah it was.

3537
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:37,660
I was like no.

3538
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:38,620
No more Overwatch talk.

3539
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,100
But then I realized.

3540
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:39,920
Wait I was...

3541
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,460
I was actually doing really good.

3542
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:49,980
Oh no.

3543
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,000
Okay I need to focus.

3544
01:54:55,420 --> 01:55:01,000
I think it's

3545
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:05,370
also because like...

3546
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:06,450
A lot of people...

3547
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:08,590
Depend on me winning that first match.

3548
01:55:08,730 --> 01:55:10,050
So then I got so in my head.

3549
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:12,570
I got so in my head.

3550
01:55:13,390 --> 01:55:14,930
I got so in my head there.

3551
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:16,370
But I'm gonna...

3552
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:17,770
I'm gonna mentally reset myself.

3553
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:20,210
I'm gonna try and mentally reset myself.

3554
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:21,370
Because I'm here to vibe.

3555
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:28,960
Oh my god no.

3556
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,100
And then when I fat fingered...

3557
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:33,940
When I fat fingered the level 3...

3558
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:34,960
I was so mad.

3559
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:43,020
The fat finger of the level 3 messed me up too.

3560
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,900
That actually messed my vibes up.

3561
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:45,800
Because I was like...

3562
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:46,020
How?

3563
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,620
How did that happen?

3564
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,040
How did I fat fingered...

3565
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:50,940
My level 3?

3566
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,700
I've never fat fingered...

3567
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:54,680
The level 3 before.

3568
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:07,530
I did warm up.

3569
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:08,730
I played 3 hours.

3570
01:56:09,190 --> 01:56:10,590
I did 3 hours.

3571
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:12,250
I played 3 hours.

3572
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:14,350
2 to 3 hours of Street Fighter...

3573
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:15,850
Custom Runes before...

3574
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:19,610
Before the...

3575
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:21,510
Match.

3576
01:56:21,730 --> 01:56:22,910
Before the tournament.

3577
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:25,530
But it was just the pressure.

3578
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:29,470
Because I've always done better when...

3579
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:30,530
Like during the Tekken...

3580
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:32,370
During the Tekken...

3581
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:34,550
I would...

3582
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:35,890
Like we were just fucking around.

3583
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:38,610
Like when I was playing...

3584
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:41,870
It was just mostly me...

3585
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:42,790
It was just mostly me...

3586
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:44,590
I had no intention of winning.

3587
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:46,670
I was just doing whatever.

3588
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:47,790
And we were just talking.

3589
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,730
While I played.

3590
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:50,990
But it was so quiet.

3591
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:52,610
It was so quiet.

3592
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:53,690
When I'm playing.

3593
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:58,150
Yeah, it was just a hangout.

3594
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,470
When it gets way too quiet...

3595
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,210
I don't know what to do.

3596
01:57:04,970 --> 01:57:07,250
Because I like talking while playing.

3597
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:08,510
And when...

3598
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:10,850
I get so in my head when it's too quiet.

3599
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:13,130
And so I make so many mistakes.

3600
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:13,970
Because of it.

3601
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:17,110
Okay.

3602
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:19,570
I need to know...

3603
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:21,270
I need to do a drive wake up here.

3604
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:25,610
Okay.

3605
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:28,730
Okay, nice.

3606
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:34,380
Alright.

3607
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:36,440
Nice, okay.

3608
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:39,160
I need to get...

3609
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,320
I need to reset my mental.

3610
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:42,440
I need to reset my mental.

3611
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:45,000
I'm going to see if Kony...

3612
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,120
I'm going to see if Kony is online.

3613
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:48,940
Kony.

3614
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,260
Kony, are you...

3615
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:52,540
Are you online right now?

3616
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:54,940
Oops, sorry.

3617
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,980
Sorry, I'll do one more game with you.

3618
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,080
I was messaging Kony.

3619
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:00,760
I don't think he is though.

3620
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,600
Or Matman.

3621
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,280
I'm just going to get Matman in here.

3622
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:07,740
Are you online right now?

3623
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:13,300
I need to reset.

3624
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:15,200
Show me everything you have.

3625
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,380
Round one.

3626
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,340
Okay.

3627
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:22,900
I'm coming.

3628
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,520
Get...

3629
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:28,810
Alright.

3630
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:31,350
Oh, Matman is online.

3631
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:31,770
Okay.

3632
01:58:32,650 --> 01:58:33,090
Get...

3633
01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:35,110
Take...

3634
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:36,950
Okay.

3635
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:39,530
Give me a sec.

3636
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:40,070
Give me a sec.

3637
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:41,850
Pause, pause, pause, pause.

3638
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:43,290
If you're watching this stream, pause.

3639
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:44,250
Go to the other corner.

3640
01:58:44,370 --> 01:58:45,830
If you're watching, go to the other corner.

3641
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:46,670
Okay, thank you.

3642
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,350
Hello?

3643
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:55,410
Okay, I need you to hype me up.

3644
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:56,130
I'm like...

3645
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:58,730
I need some vibes.

3646
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,470
Matt, I need some vibes.

3647
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:01,890
I need you to hype me up right now.

3648
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:02,650
Alright.

3649
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:05,370
I'm going to hype you up, but in a non-hype way.

3650
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:06,810
Because that's just the way it is.

3651
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:08,330
Wait, why?

3652
01:59:09,490 --> 01:59:11,390
You're going to fucking dominate.

3653
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:11,890
Okay?

3654
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:13,890
You're going to go crazy.

3655
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:15,990
You're going to hit the grab button.

3656
01:59:16,230 --> 01:59:18,550
And then you're going to hit the armor button.

3657
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:20,630
And then, when they don't expect it...

3658
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:21,030
Yeah?

3659
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:23,130
You're going to hit the grab.

3660
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:24,290
The grab button?

3661
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:25,190
Okay, okay.

3662
01:59:25,490 --> 01:59:28,090
No, it got too serious, Matt.

3663
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,150
It got too serious.

3664
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:30,890
And I...

3665
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:32,010
I'm choking.

3666
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:32,590
I'm crumbling.

3667
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:35,490
It's fine.

3668
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:35,970
I know.

3669
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,610
I hear the call.

3670
01:59:36,690 --> 01:59:37,230
It's like, damn.

3671
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:39,730
It's so tense, right?

3672
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:42,070
It's so fucking tense.

3673
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:44,290
And I'm like, I don't know what to do.

3674
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:46,570
It's fine.

3675
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:48,910
You know, it's just video games.

3676
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:49,570
It's okay.

3677
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:51,210
It's just...

3678
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:54,810
I mean, I was watching Brawl Pro streaming.

3679
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:56,270
I got it on the background while I'm editing.

3680
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:57,490
Everyone's like, oh, damn.

3681
01:59:58,510 --> 02:00:00,390
It's so nerve-wracking.

3682
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:02,970
And I'm like, guys, I don't want to fuck with that.

3683
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:03,370
I...

3684
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:05,290
I know, I know.

3685
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:06,950
Tekken's like a lot like, oh, yeah.

3686
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:09,030
Like, do the funny move, you know?

3687
02:00:09,730 --> 02:00:11,790
Yeah, I was like, nobody's talking.

3688
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:13,590
And I'm like, I'm so tense.

3689
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:14,930
No, don't worry.

3690
02:00:15,110 --> 02:00:17,290
I mean, who doesn't want to win?

3691
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:19,070
But like, yeah, it's for fun anyway.

3692
02:00:19,310 --> 02:00:20,230
Yeah, yeah.

3693
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:22,130
Okay, thanks.

3694
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:23,390
I needed that vibe reset.

3695
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:24,970
Okay, you're good.

3696
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:27,410
Just remember, video games.

3697
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:28,270
Good luck.

3698
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:28,790
I'll watch.

3699
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:28,830
Video games.

3700
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:29,630
Thank you.

3701
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:31,710
Bye, Matt.

3702
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:35,470
Okay, we got the Matt reset.

3703
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:37,590
We got the...

3704
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:41,010
Matt reset.

3705
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:43,330
All right.

3706
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:44,290
We got the Matt reset.

3707
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:45,790
We should be okay now.

3708
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:48,390
All right, I'm joining back into the team call.

3709
02:00:49,130 --> 02:00:49,690
All right.

3710
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:54,790
Yeah.

3711
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:57,750
What combo are you trying to do, SK?

3712
02:00:58,550 --> 02:00:59,390
I'm just...

3713
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:00,910
This one.

3714
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:01,850
Okay.

3715
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:05,970
Remember, it's that one you can do stand medium to heavy.

3716
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:08,250
Because it's a punish counter.

3717
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:09,570
Yes.

3718
02:01:09,730 --> 02:01:10,910
That will work.

3719
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:12,070
And look at your timing.

3720
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:12,630
It's so good.

3721
02:01:16,590 --> 02:01:20,030
So the worst thing is to just get beat up over and over, right?

3722
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:21,290
So like, just...

3723
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:22,650
Yeah.

3724
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:26,630
If you don't get the perfect parry, you might not get much.

3725
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:31,050
But just don't let this turn into multiple hits.

3726
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:32,650
If she lands a headbutt, just chill.

3727
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:34,430
If you get hit by it, don't worry about it.

3728
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,430
She might just do it again.

3729
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:37,770
See how you're getting hit again?

3730
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:37,950
Yeah.

3731
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:38,810
That...

3732
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:40,530
We just gotta avoid the meltdown.

3733
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:43,130
If you get hit by something, you get up and you block her parry.

3734
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:44,730
Okay.

3735
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:46,570
And that's about it.

3736
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:46,990
Right?

3737
02:01:47,130 --> 02:01:47,570
Yeah.

3738
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:52,490
I just ruined a Ryu's 9 win streak and I won and done him.

3739
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:53,090
Nice.

3740
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:54,410
That's what I need.

3741
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:55,270
Just for you.

3742
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:56,150
Nice.

3743
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:56,650
Thank you.

3744
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:58,250
I think also like...

3745
02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:03,530
I don't do well when the vibes get super tense too.

3746
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:04,950
I think that's also it.

3747
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:06,710
I was like talking to my chat about it.

3748
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:10,070
Cause I get so nervous and...

3749
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:11,790
Now that we lost, I'm kind of...

3750
02:02:11,790 --> 02:02:12,330
I'm like...

3751
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:14,910
Alright.

3752
02:02:15,910 --> 02:02:16,850
Attention's out the window.

3753
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:17,810
I don't give a shit anymore.

3754
02:02:18,850 --> 02:02:20,490
I'm just gonna chill.

3755
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,190
I'm just gonna have a good time.

3756
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:24,710
If you guys just play your game, I'm telling you.

3757
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:25,770
Yeah, yeah.

3758
02:02:25,810 --> 02:02:26,210
We're just gonna play our game.

3759
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:28,390
The only thing that's wrong is nerves right now.

3760
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:28,810
That's it.

3761
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:29,810
Yeah, exactly.

3762
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:31,510
Just don't let the nerves get to you.

3763
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:32,450
Just have a good time.

3764
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:33,470
I'm vibing now.

3765
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:34,110
Yeah, yeah.

3766
02:02:34,230 --> 02:02:37,370
That might be due to one of my magic dummies, but that's okay.

3767
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:38,410
Oh, wait.

3768
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:38,730
What?

3769
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:40,150
What?

3770
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:43,210
You didn't hear anything.

3771
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:44,750
Wait a minute.

3772
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:45,850
There's nothing.

3773
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:47,530
Have you been...

3774
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:50,110
During the other matches?

3775
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:51,290
What?

3776
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:54,370
Well, you know...

3777
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:55,890
The first one, no.

3778
02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:59,830
I couldn't even get to the second one cause you guys lost.

3779
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:01,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3780
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:02,570
Sheesh.

3781
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:04,550
I don't even know how I'm gonna perform.

3782
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:07,190
I'd live for this Akuma game.

3783
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:09,770
You'd live for the Akuma game.

3784
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:11,410
And I'm like, alright, I guess I'm just leaving.

3785
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:16,470
So I say, if you block this, do you stand medium to crash medium kick?

3786
02:03:17,070 --> 02:03:18,110
Do you stand medium to crash medium kick?

3787
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:19,230
Do you stand medium to crash medium kick?

3788
02:03:19,230 --> 02:03:21,470
I gotta face against Mbox.

3789
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:23,130
I gotta face against Mbox.

3790
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:24,830
Wait, did you do okay against M?

3791
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:27,190
Stand medium punch like you're doing to crash medium kick.

3792
02:03:27,490 --> 02:03:28,990
Boxbox, we're 1-1 right now.

3793
02:03:29,070 --> 02:03:32,810
But I went and dunned him in rank on accident, but I still did it.

3794
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:34,650
Technically speaking, we're 2-1.

3795
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:35,170
Yeah, technically you.

3796
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:38,650
Technically speaking, you lose the bracket.

3797
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:39,910
Yeah.

3798
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:41,490
But it's okay.

3799
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:42,390
I mean, it's fine.

3800
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:46,210
I'm not that worried about Boxbox.

3801
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:48,010
And then you dash into it.

3802
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:49,470
Let's go to the practice room, SK.

3803
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:54,790
I am worried that he has my portrait on like a board or something though.

3804
02:03:54,850 --> 02:03:54,910
I am worried that he has my portrait on like a board or something though.

3805
02:03:54,910 --> 02:03:56,210
Cause he said, I will remember this.

3806
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:59,050
He remembers this?

3807
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:00,770
I'm a little worried.

3808
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,510
And I never know when that guy is serious.

3809
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:04,610
That's what worries me.

3810
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,110
That's true actually.

3811
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:07,970
Cause he...

3812
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:10,510
I played against his Asuka in Tekken 8.

3813
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:11,650
And he said, watch this.

3814
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:14,170
It's gonna work 100% of the time.

3815
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:16,590
And then it didn't work and I believed him.

3816
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:18,510
And he did it and it didn't work.

3817
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:19,450
He's like, oh, never mind.

3818
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:21,150
I'm like, wait, I actually believed you.

3819
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,160
That's crazy.

3820
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:29,440
It's kinda a little different.

3821
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,400
That's fine.

3822
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:31,940
Who else is on that team?

3823
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:32,600
Oh, Sykkuno.

3824
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:33,820
Just give him emotional damage.

3825
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:35,000
It's not that big of a deal.

3826
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,760
Yeah, but he has...

3827
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:39,220
Oh, shit.

3828
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:39,460
No!

3829
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,500
Sorry, I was playing against somebody.

3830
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:44,480
I pressed the wrong button and died.

3831
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:46,480
He's been...

3832
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,280
He's been like...

3833
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:48,620
Labbing?

3834
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:49,340
Yeah.

3835
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:51,060
Who cares, dude?

3836
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,960
He had Pawn coach him.

3837
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,160
Dude, come on, man.

3838
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:58,000
You think he's gonna doubt...

3839
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:00,960
Master's degree in one night?

3840
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:05,020
No, it takes months to be able to write a thesis and...

3841
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,220
I hope he plays Zangief.

3842
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,640
I hope I won a mirror match Zangief.

3843
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:09,760
Oh, gosh.

3844
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:10,480
That would be so...

3845
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:11,480
I don't even care if I lose.

3846
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:13,220
I think that would be so fun to watch.

3847
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,860
For my health, I hope not, to be honest with you.

3848
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:16,740
But it's so fun.

3849
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:18,060
It's so fun to play and watch.

3850
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,820
I mean, that's fine, but I really like seeing, you know, you versus Cammy.

3851
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,440
I think it's a really good matchup.

3852
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:25,520
You should think about that more.

3853
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:27,840
So good.

3854
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:29,420
And SK really appreciates this.

3855
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,200
I like that, too, to be honest.

3856
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:32,540
Just letting you know.

3857
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:34,860
Wait, what?

3858
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:35,500
Wait, how do you adapt?

3859
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,660
Stop adapting to me.

3860
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:41,120
Yeah, adapting... I mean, like...

3861
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:41,920
It's just gonna happen.

3862
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:44,220
I don't know what you do.

3863
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,380
The thing is, they can't adapt fast enough.

3864
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:46,940
That's the thing.

3865
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:50,960
You just gotta hit them so fast that they don't even know what's going on.

3866
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:52,020
Look what hit them.

3867
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:55,280
That's why when I'm like...

3868
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,080
Oh, no.

3869
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:00,440
Everybody is trying to actually play the matchup.

3870
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,300
It's like, nah, dude.

3871
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,740
Get in there.

3872
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:04,320
Get in there, dude.

3873
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:04,900
Who cares?

3874
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:08,760
Like, on paper, they know what's going on.

3875
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,340
It's like, they have all the answers, right?

3876
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,920
But, dude, they have to still go to the...

3877
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,480
They're not dealing...

3878
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:15,920
Their brains, they're like...

3879
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,000
They're not even SSDs, right?

3880
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:19,640
They're just like Western Digital Blues.

3881
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,900
So, like, the write speed is a little slow.

3882
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:26,540
So they can't get the information fast enough to be able to deal with the thing.

3883
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,980
If you can throw them fast enough.

3884
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:28,580
You know what I mean?

3885
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:33,880
Now, if they had, like, M.2s for brains, now we got a problem.

3886
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,000
I don't think anyone would do it.

3887
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,040
What the fuck?

3888
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,120
What is this Cammy doing?

3889
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:46,240
Oh, no!

3890
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:47,180
That's what he's doing!

3891
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:50,760
What's he doing?

3892
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,700
He fucking baited me.

3893
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,420
That's what happened.

3894
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:03,680
I need to get some more water.

3895
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:04,980
My mouth is dry.

3896
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:05,700
I got dry mouth.

3897
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:13,660
I don't hold down back sometimes.

3898
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:15,440
I get blown up for it.

3899
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,440
You need to larry it more, brother.

3900
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:19,520
Yeah.

3901
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,100
They jump at you, you spin around like a tornado.

3902
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:22,700
Wait, who are you fighting?

3903
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:24,620
Who are you fighting next?

3904
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:26,080
I think B.

3905
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:26,940
B?

3906
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:27,440
BDX?

3907
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:28,460
Yeah.

3908
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:28,920
Okay.

3909
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,500
You see them jumping.

3910
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:32,760
Oh, it's another Cammy.

3911
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:40,120
What the fuck?

3912
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,260
Oh, I'm empty.

3913
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:46,980
That's not good.

3914
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:53,300
Is co-op an edible right now?

3915
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:54,240
What?

3916
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:05,720
I'm practicing all the Cammy's because I didn't lap Cammy at all.

3917
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:09,140
I don't wanna lap him.

3918
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:11,100
I run into a lot of those in ranked.

3919
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:12,620
Yeah, but I don't play ranked.

3920
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:15,480
Street Fighter ranked just makes me too mad.

3921
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,940
To be fair, Street Fighter makes me mad in general.

3922
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:24,280
But ranked just makes me more mad than usual.

3923
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,640
Oh my god.

3924
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:34,480
Yeah, and I was like, I won't fight Sykkuno.

3925
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,400
And then I fight Sykkuno.

3926
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:45,850
Now I have to actually practice Cammy now.

3927
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:53,670
You know, other ranked games don't make me as mad as Street Fighter ranked.

3928
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:54,530
I don't know what it is.

3929
02:08:55,190 --> 02:08:59,410
I'm not even happy when I win a Street Fighter ranked game.

3930
02:09:00,290 --> 02:09:01,050
Oh man.

3931
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:03,730
I almost fell down the stairs.

3932
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:04,290
That was crazy.

3933
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:05,210
Oh, that is not good.

3934
02:09:05,210 --> 02:09:06,070
What if you have to play?

3935
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:08,430
Yeah, what if you have to play?

3936
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:10,510
Nah, it's okay.

3937
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:11,050
I'm not scared.

3938
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:12,290
I've been watching too much GEEF.

3939
02:09:13,650 --> 02:09:15,390
Wait, you're not playing against GEEF?

3940
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:17,670
No, I've been watching too much of it.

3941
02:09:17,790 --> 02:09:20,670
So I'm like, I vicariously am GEEF.

3942
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:21,970
That's what I'm trying to say.

3943
02:09:24,450 --> 02:09:25,190
No, we're good.

3944
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:28,730
You guys wanna know a song that really gets me going?

3945
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,670
Yeah.

3946
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:33,190
Have you ever heard of Dig a Hole by Windrose?

3947
02:09:33,570 --> 02:09:33,970
What?

3948
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:34,250
No.

3949
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:37,230
Boot that shit up real quick.

3950
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:39,710
And tell me that doesn't make you wanna dig a hole.

3951
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,450
Off stream.

3952
02:09:43,710 --> 02:09:44,430
Not on stream.

3953
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:45,310
Unless you have it split.

3954
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:45,910
That's fine.

3955
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:49,310
That gets me going, dude.

3956
02:09:51,590 --> 02:09:53,070
Is that the Minecraft one?

3957
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:54,610
Minecraft?

3958
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:57,330
I don't know.

3959
02:09:57,450 --> 02:09:59,770
There's a Minecraft version of...

3960
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:01,430
Not Minecraft, but like...

3961
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:04,490
There's a Minecraft song that has that...

3962
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:05,770
Oh.

3963
02:10:09,110 --> 02:10:10,790
Dude, this song right here.

3964
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:14,150
Gets my blood going.

3965
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:16,510
Dig a hole?

3966
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:17,590
Yeah, dude.

3967
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:18,610
I got this weird...

3968
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:21,110
I actually bought a tactical shovel because of this song.

3969
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:23,110
A tactical shovel?

3970
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:27,850
Yeah, so you unscrew the handle and it's like a knife.

3971
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:30,990
And then the shovel actually comes undone too.

3972
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:32,250
So it can be like a...

3973
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:34,310
It's like a survival shovel.

3974
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:38,330
You take it with you, you're supposed to survive with it.

3975
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:39,390
What?

3976
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:41,170
Yeah, dude.

3977
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:42,090
It's so good.

3978
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:43,650
It's got like seven different...

3979
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:45,890
It's like a Swiss army, but a shovel.

3980
02:10:46,810 --> 02:10:47,830
Swiss army knife.

3981
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:48,390
That's what I meant.

3982
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:55,330
Oh no, I'm in the corner.

3983
02:10:55,410 --> 02:10:56,170
Don't do this to me.

3984
02:10:56,850 --> 02:10:57,290
Please.

3985
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:58,870
What's a Yogscast?

3986
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:02,270
That's where the song is from.

3987
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:04,290
Oh, I heard this song.

3988
02:11:05,170 --> 02:11:06,870
I didn't hear this song from them.

3989
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:08,150
This is a Minecraft song?

3990
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:09,170
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3991
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,350
It's a Minecraft song.

3992
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:12,110
That's almost like the Minecraft song.

3993
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:17,650
Wait, is it this exact one, chat?

3994
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:20,090
This makes you want to dig a hole, you said?

3995
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:20,870
Yeah!

3996
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:22,390
Yeah, it does.

3997
02:11:22,670 --> 02:11:23,910
It's the Minecraft song.

3998
02:11:25,830 --> 02:11:29,290
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole.

3999
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:32,250
Yeah, that is the Minecraft song.

4000
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:33,150
Yeah!

4001
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:34,970
I didn't know it was a Minecraft song.

4002
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:37,650
That's like... that one?

4003
02:11:39,250 --> 02:11:41,090
Still made of gold.

4004
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:45,150
Common brothers sing with me!

4005
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:50,470
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole.

4006
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:54,330
I want to go dig one right now.

4007
02:11:54,630 --> 02:11:57,130
Wait, so you buy a shovel because of that?

4008
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:58,230
Yeah, dude.

4009
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:03,830
Unfortunately, my landlords were like, no, you cannot build dig a hole in our backyard.

4010
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:04,970
But, you know...

4011
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:07,870
There's no way you actually... that has to be...

4012
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:11,450
I want to dig a hole so bad, but I can't.

4013
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:12,290
There's no way.

4014
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:14,490
My HOA won't let me.

4015
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:17,110
Let's go to a public park and dig a hole.

4016
02:12:17,770 --> 02:12:19,590
I might go in the middle of nowhere, though.

4017
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,650
Yeah, go to like a forest.

4018
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:29,010
Chat, would you guys watch a shovel livestream, like an IRL stream of me digging a hole?

4019
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,830
Honestly, people watch anything.

4020
02:12:35,410 --> 02:12:36,510
Inside my house?

4021
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:37,110
I think that's illegal.

4022
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:39,010
It is.

4023
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:42,630
It's 100% not legal.

4024
02:12:43,170 --> 02:12:44,310
I think that's illegal.

4025
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:45,530
I don't know if I'm gonna do that.

4026
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:46,750
But, you know...

4027
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:49,550
Whatever happens, happens, you know?

4028
02:12:54,130 --> 02:12:55,910
I've never played Shovel Knight, actually.

4029
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:56,790
I should play that.

4030
02:12:56,850 --> 02:12:57,430
It's got a shovel.

4031
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:58,430
It's fun.

4032
02:12:59,010 --> 02:12:59,510
I've never played Shovel Knight.

4033
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:00,310
It's pretty fun.

4034
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:03,250
Isn't it like, uh...

4035
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:05,270
Have you played Hollow Knight?

4036
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:07,870
No, I've never played Hollow Knight.

4037
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:09,870
Hollow Knight is really long, too.

4038
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:11,170
Is it?

4039
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:11,770
Yeah.

4040
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:15,610
Go to a cemetery?

4041
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:20,870
No, go to the abandoned cemetery.

4042
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:23,990
People clean abandoned cemeteries for content.

4043
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,290
I'd do it.

4044
02:13:26,530 --> 02:13:28,070
I'd go to an abandoned cemetery.

4045
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:31,050
I'll just make friends with the ghosts.

4046
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:31,410
It's fine.

4047
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:34,350
Actually, I don't know.

4048
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:38,630
I'm pretty sure legally, you can't do anything.

4049
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:41,970
But it's abandoned, so what are you gonna do?

4050
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:43,910
Yeah, what are you gonna do, bro?

4051
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:46,050
There's no way there's cameras or anything.

4052
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:47,110
It's literally abandoned.

4053
02:13:48,610 --> 02:13:54,250
I'm just wondering, yeah, it's against the law, but what are you gonna do?

4054
02:13:56,630 --> 02:13:57,650
Yeah, exactly.

4055
02:13:59,150 --> 02:13:59,590
Exactly.

4056
02:14:00,610 --> 02:14:03,070
Anyways, that's my little obsession with shovels and holes.

4057
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:05,090
I mean, uh, digging holes.

4058
02:14:05,230 --> 02:14:05,690
Digging holes.

4059
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:07,210
I don't have an obsession with holes.

4060
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:10,130
Whoa,

4061
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:14,410
that's not what I wanted.

4062
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:15,010
Whoops.

4063
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:22,330
God, this song is so metal.

4064
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:22,870
I love it.

4065
02:14:22,870 --> 02:14:23,010
I love it.

4066
02:14:28,570 --> 02:14:30,610
What are they streaming right now?

4067
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:33,430
They're streaming the second other loser match.

4068
02:14:33,730 --> 02:14:35,490
They have the...

4069
02:14:36,430 --> 02:14:37,050
What's it called?

4070
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:39,830
My seed going up right now.

4071
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:42,070
The first seed happening.

4072
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:44,550
So far, it's 2-1.

4073
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:46,630
We play the winner of this, right?

4074
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:47,410
Yeah.

4075
02:14:47,470 --> 02:14:48,130
No, no, no.

4076
02:14:48,190 --> 02:14:49,450
We're playing Dia's team.

4077
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:52,470
And if we win with Dia, we go to TwitchCon.

4078
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:53,550
Yeah.

4079
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:56,070
So this is the last match we have to play.

4080
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,730
Yeah, this is the last match.

4081
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:58,950
Alright.

4082
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:00,430
I mean, if we don't win, whatever.

4083
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:00,890
It's cool.

4084
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:02,150
It's fine.

4085
02:15:02,150 --> 02:15:03,870
I'll just play FFXIV, to be honest.

4086
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:06,070
I'll go retire right now.

4087
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:07,250
Nice.

4088
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:08,710
I'll go.

4089
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:09,170
I'll retire.

4090
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:10,950
I'll boot up.

4091
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:11,570
I'll log in.

4092
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:12,810
Log in, boys.

4093
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:14,170
Let's do this.

4094
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:21,220
Oh, damn.

4095
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:22,340
This is actually kind of close.

4096
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:23,080
What in the world?

4097
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:25,540
Wait, who's winning in...

4098
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:27,600
Who's winning right now in that match?

4099
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:29,620
So far, JB's team is winning.

4100
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:32,220
So if Cosmonaut wins, they advance.

4101
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:39,280
I hope JB team wins, just for the sake of the fact that during TwitchCon, you don't have to fight Roy.

4102
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,260
Yeah, I just hope BroadPro to fight Roy.

4103
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:44,180
You get to see that dude in person, dude.

4104
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:45,540
You're like, a youth motherfucker.

4105
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:48,260
I don't want BroadPro to fight Roy.

4106
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:50,220
For the sake of his heart.

4107
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:52,060
There's a lot of time.

4108
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,440
There's a lot of time in between.

4109
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:58,580
We're just there with like a towel toweling him off, you know, making sure he's okay.

4110
02:15:58,580 --> 02:15:58,780
I don't know.

4111
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,380
For the sake of Broad... I'm worried about BroadPro.

4112
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:03,980
It'll be fine.

4113
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,780
Look, Roy lost today.

4114
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:08,340
I feel like you're gonna have a heart attack fighting...

4115
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:08,500
He did.

4116
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:12,240
I thought you were gonna have a heart attack fighting Fumi, so I think you're...

4117
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:14,100
Fighting Roy.

4118
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,980
That was... dude, let me tell you, that was frustrating a lot, dude.

4119
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,080
Well, yeah, I would...

4120
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:21,400
If I was fighting that, JP, I'd break my monitor.

4121
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:25,640
It's just, it's Gif in particular.

4122
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:27,920
Gif has such a hard time getting in.

4123
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:28,620
Yeah.

4124
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:29,960
It's doable.

4125
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:31,660
It's just different.

4126
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:33,940
It's just, it doesn't seem fun.

4127
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:36,320
There's a lot of time, though, to practice up.

4128
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:37,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4129
02:16:38,660 --> 02:16:41,840
And I think, I've played Street Fighter, like, I think, off stream a little.

4130
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:45,000
It's a little distracting to get to learn it on stream, you know?

4131
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:46,820
Chat's very distracting sometimes.

4132
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:47,100
Dude.

4133
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:48,540
I feel so bad.

4134
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:55,320
So, I hardly stream this game practice-wise, because I had other stuff to do off stream, but, like, I would...

4135
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:58,440
I would tear my hair off.

4136
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:03,700
Everybody was having a hard time streaming the game, because of the back-seaters, from what I've heard.

4137
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:04,560
Really?

4138
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:09,860
Yeah, like, everybody was, like, tweeting about it, too, and was like, I swear to God.

4139
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:16,060
Oh, yeah, SK was like, this is the first time she streamed with the chat just turned off, like, the window wasn't even open.

4140
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:16,480
Yeah.

4141
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:17,360
For real?

4142
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:19,020
Oh, I didn't even know.

4143
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:21,200
Man, you guys suck, chat.

4144
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:22,700
Jeez, Lou, man.

4145
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:26,560
He was, like, saying, like, I'm never touching Street Fighter again after, or something.

4146
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:26,920
What?

4147
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:30,080
Yeah, because he was like, I hate... He said, if I don't, it's because of the chat.

4148
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:30,460
Yeah.

4149
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:32,900
I'm like, damn, brother.

4150
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,100
It is a big question.

4151
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:40,240
And I saw, like, I know, like, Amora got, like, really mad, too, when she was grinding.

4152
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:41,540
Really?

4153
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:46,080
Dude, I just started making fun of their mothers, or call out their fathers not being around.

4154
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,660
I start, I start getting toxic.

4155
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:50,740
But not against the game, but against them.

4156
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:56,200
Like, I heard that, like, Nephew started, like, pulling up people's replays.

4157
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:59,880
Like, anybody that starts backseating his students, he starts pulling people's replays up.

4158
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:01,600
Oh, that's kind of godlike.

4159
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,880
And then he starts, like, going over them.

4160
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:03,360
Yeah.

4161
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:09,740
Yeah, they're like, you're, you're, yeah, if you're gonna backseat my students, I'm gonna start backseating you.

4162
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:10,720
No, that's godlike.

4163
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:11,920
That's pretty great.

4164
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:16,840
And I can't imagine Nephew doing it, like, enthusiastically.

4165
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:17,960
He'll be like, yep, that's bad.

4166
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:18,500
Yeah.

4167
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:20,260
I heard a voice call last night.

4168
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,420
It was so funny, dude.

4169
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,160
I love that.

4170
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:28,380
People don't realize, man, that streaming and playing the game is very different.

4171
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:29,040
Yeah.

4172
02:18:30,300 --> 02:18:32,400
Like, it's just, guys, it's not vibey.

4173
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:34,180
No, dude.

4174
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,400
I don't fuck with those.

4175
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:43,320
But I don't think, I don't know if I, I don't know if my chat has done that, but, like, I know my chat keeps saying spam circle more, but, like, I don't listen.

4176
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:47,500
So, like, nah, just listen to the wind, bro.

4177
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:50,100
The more you tell me the spam circle, the less I'll do.

4178
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:51,980
Ah, perfect.

4179
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:52,780
I love that.

4180
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:55,140
I love that mentality, dude.

4181
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:58,520
Your mentality's been really good towards all this stuff, Doki.

4182
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:03,080
You give me such, like, I tweeted this out, you give me such 2011 vibes, it's freaking nuts.

4183
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:06,600
Like, 2011 FGC vibes is nuts, dude.

4184
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:10,320
It's just like, yeah, let me, uh...

4185
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:14,560
Let me just one and done.

4186
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,480
You did the ultimate sacrilege thing.

4187
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:22,520
You ulted Fjord in the middle of a, after a round.

4188
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:24,080
That was, that was crazy.

4189
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:25,280
Or after a game, I bet.

4190
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:26,840
The half and done.

4191
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:28,040
Oh, yeah.

4192
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:33,320
That got me so, that got me so happy.

4193
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:36,200
Yeah, guess I'll go here.

4194
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:37,860
Okay, I guess I'll fight on Master Cammy.

4195
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:39,220
Let's fucking go.

4196
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:40,280
Get him!

4197
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:44,560
I don't know if I wanna, like, no matter what, we win or lose.

4198
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,620
Automatic takes the first round.

4199
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:52,620
If we win or lose, I don't know if I wanna stay and just watch everything.

4200
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:55,200
Oh, yeah.

4201
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:55,920
I don't know.

4202
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:56,740
I'll watch.

4203
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:57,480
I'm down to watch.

4204
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,800
I'll probably watch.

4205
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,660
I meant, like, streaming-wise.

4206
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:01,380
I don't know.

4207
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:04,060
Cause it's like... Yeah, you don't have to stream it.

4208
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:06,100
Cause it's probably... Is it just one match left?

4209
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,940
Or... Is it just one match left?

4210
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:06,940
Or...

4211
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:09,280
It's one match that left after us, right?

4212
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:09,940
Yeah, it's one match.

4213
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:10,680
Like, the Nephew vs.

4214
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:11,440
Shine?

4215
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:12,480
Yup.

4216
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:13,200
Yeah, okay.

4217
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,880
Okay, I guess we can watch Nephew vs.

4218
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:15,340
Shine.

4219
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:16,320
Yeah.

4220
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:18,220
One more.

4221
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:20,200
After this, Imma have me.

4222
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:22,760
I'm gonna sleep after this.

4223
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:29,820
I swear, the Street Fighter Sage on Snap has been the most stressful week for me.

4224
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:31,040
It's been mad stressful.

4225
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:35,140
Yesterday, I felt like I had a UFC fight the next day.

4226
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:38,260
Like, I was like...

4227
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,360
I couldn't eat.

4228
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:41,160
True, me too.

4229
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:44,400
I've been eating one meal a day because of the Street Fighter.

4230
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:44,800
Damn!

4231
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:45,700
You too?

4232
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:46,400
Yeah.

4233
02:20:46,580 --> 02:20:49,600
I don't know why it's so stressful.

4234
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:51,000
Yeah, we balding with this one.

4235
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,720
Cause, like, the Tekken one was like...

4236
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:55,120
The Tekken one is like...

4237
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,040
I guess, like, there's less...

4238
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:00,940
uh... risk.

4239
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,200
Not risk, but, like, what's the word?

4240
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:04,040
There's more management.

4241
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:06,000
You have to think more about shit.

4242
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:07,840
You have to think about your meter management.

4243
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,180
You have to think about their meter management.

4244
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:14,420
You have to think about their level threes and all that stuff.

4245
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,200
No!

4246
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:16,540
I've been practicing!

4247
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:17,340
I haven't just been playing Yacht before.

4248
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:22,020
I feel like Street Fighter, like, for some reason, a lot of people are so mad, too.

4249
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:23,900
Wait, who's mad?

4250
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:27,840
Does streaming...

4251
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:32,780
No, like, when stuff happens, people get mad so easily, too.

4252
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,500
On Street Fighter?

4253
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,160
There's a lot of room for error in this game.

4254
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:38,100
And...

4255
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:40,880
I think that... I could say that pretty...

4256
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:47,200
pretty nicely about, like, Tekken versus Street Fighter, is that Tekken, you can kind of mess up a few times.

4257
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,420
Well, unless in high level.

4258
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:53,400
But, like, in Street Fighter, in general, you mess up, it's like, oh god, that can be the round.

4259
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:54,760
Yeah, like, I...

4260
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,040
I've been so mad over Street Fighter in general, sometimes.

4261
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:02,820
You just gotta think.

4262
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:04,440
Apparently, Phi was screaming.

4263
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:06,480
Yeah, yeah.

4264
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:13,340
No, like, I've sent, like, BrawlPro, like, so many messages of being like, I fucking hate Street Fighter!

4265
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:15,600
Like, screaming.

4266
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:18,320
And then I stopped playing Rank and I stopped sending those messages.

4267
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:24,340
After I stopped playing Rank, I stopped sending those messages, so now I'm okay.

4268
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:31,400
One time I got a notification, I woke up, looked at it, it's just, like, AH, but you held down an H, and all caps.

4269
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:32,700
And I'm just like, AH!

4270
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:36,520
And then at the end, it's like, I hate Street Fighter!

4271
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:40,160
I'm just like, well, good morning.

4272
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:45,520
But, like, now, but ever since I stopped playing Rank, I stopped screaming into the void.

4273
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:49,160
So, like, I'm less, I'm less mad, I'm just stressed now.

4274
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:50,180
Yeah.

4275
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:53,260
Instead of being mad, I'm just stressed.

4276
02:22:53,780 --> 02:22:56,420
I got to 1600 MR, I'm done.

4277
02:22:56,840 --> 02:22:58,060
Forever with Rank.

4278
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:58,520
Yeah.

4279
02:22:58,520 --> 02:22:59,640
I was like, I'm gonna get to gold!

4280
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:00,660
And I'm like, no, fuck.

4281
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:01,500
Fuck this shit, I don't care.

4282
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:03,160
Yeah, no, true.

4283
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:07,140
True.

4284
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:07,920
But, you know.

4285
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,920
Yeah, BrawlPro is, like, the void for me.

4286
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:11,920
The void.

4287
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:13,060
He's the void.

4288
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,000
He's what I use to scream.

4289
02:23:20,660 --> 02:23:22,200
It was funny, though.

4290
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:24,280
I can't wait to uninstall.

4291
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:27,640
I didn't say that!

4292
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:30,380
I already leaked that part out, I apologize.

4293
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:32,160
What did you leak?

4294
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,280
The Doki saying, uh-huh.

4295
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:36,860
And then, I can't wait to uninstall.

4296
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

4297
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:45,560
Alright, it seems like JB moves on, Team Automatic is out.

4298
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:47,120
Team Auto's out?

4299
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,360
Oh, so we fight JB.

4300
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:49,940
You don't have to fight Roy!

4301
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:50,600
You can sleep!

4302
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:51,560
You can sleep, BrawlPro!

4303
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,160
He's gone!

4304
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:54,820
We don't know if we're gonna make it through, too, guys.

4305
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:56,120
We don't know!

4306
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:56,580
We don't know!

4307
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:58,220
We can both be eliminated.

4308
02:23:58,560 --> 02:23:59,000
True.

4309
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,020
True, true, true.

4310
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,420
Very true.

4311
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:05,020
Let's see.

4312
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:09,440
That'll be funny, because, like, Roy lost to none in the Round Robins, and I only lost to Roy.

4313
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:11,900
It'll be funny if we both fuck you.

4314
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:14,940
That'd be so funny.

4315
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:15,380
Yeah, that'd be funny.

4316
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,320
That would be funny.

4317
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:20,980
Oh, GG's to Team Automatic.

4318
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:22,080
They did really good.

4319
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,700
I feel like Team Auto was scary, too.

4320
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,080
Super scary.

4321
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:31,240
But I think, like, just everybody leveled up so much in general.

4322
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:37,280
I definitely slacked on my training yesterday, because I just wanted to vibe.

4323
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,160
I'll be honest with you.

4324
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:40,580
It's like for fun, anyway.

4325
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:43,100
Yeah, I'll be honest with you.

4326
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:43,800
It's totally fine.

4327
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:48,480
I also slacked off on training, because I didn't want to overdo it, one.

4328
02:24:49,140 --> 02:24:51,480
And two, I... I overdid it.

4329
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:52,300
I did the opposite.

4330
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:53,520
You overdid it, brother.

4331
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:56,000
Like, we got three fairies in the morning?

4332
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,780
Yeah, it burns you out.

4333
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:00,140
Especially this game.

4334
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,120
I could do that with Tekken.

4335
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:01,500
Easy.

4336
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,860
But not this game.

4337
02:25:03,140 --> 02:25:04,480
Like, for me, I just...

4338
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:08,660
I just literally just did the training with Justin, and that was it.

4339
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:09,900
And then I went to bed.

4340
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,360
Like, I didn't... I was playing, like, fucking Roblox.

4341
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:14,860
You know what's crazy?

4342
02:25:14,980 --> 02:25:15,500
You know what's...

4343
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:17,620
You know what's insane?

4344
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:22,680
Roy went 11-1, and the one L was to go to TwitchCon.

4345
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:23,340
That's crazy.

4346
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:24,460
That's insane.

4347
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:26,580
Oh my god.

4348
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:27,840
It matters, brother.

4349
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:28,400
It matters.

4350
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:31,120
That, like, just meant it for that.

4351
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:32,140
That's insane.

4352
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:34,840
I'd be fucked, but I hope he's okay.

4353
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,600
Yeah, I hope so, too.

4354
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:37,260
No, he's fine.

4355
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:38,420
Because it's a team thing.

4356
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,120
Like, Roy...

4357
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:40,880
I mean, he did fine, right?

4358
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,400
He won a lot for his team.

4359
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:42,640
He did good.

4360
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:42,660
Yeah.

4361
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:44,460
So his team had to do it for him, too.

4362
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:45,280
But it's okay.

4363
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:46,520
Like, if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.

4364
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:47,460
Exactly.

4365
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:48,820
Exactly.

4366
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:50,940
Ugh.

4367
02:25:54,020 --> 02:25:56,980
Is this 50,000 pot worth it?

4368
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,040
No.

4369
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:00,100
Is it worth it?

4370
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:00,700
No.

4371
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:01,340
No.

4372
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:03,320
Don't keep your damn money, Capcom.

4373
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:05,180
I don't want to play your game.

4374
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:07,400
I'm just here to vibe.

4375
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,340
Like, that's the reason why I signed up.

4376
02:26:09,740 --> 02:26:12,020
It's just, I didn't really care about winning.

4377
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:14,620
I just wanted to vibe in general.

4378
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:23,700
I'm gonna take... if we do end up getting to TwitchCon and we get to the pot, I'm just gonna spend it all in Vegas.

4379
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:24,740
I don't even care.

4380
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:27,660
And then you're gonna lose all the money and more.

4381
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:28,140
Yes.

4382
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:31,100
And then I'm gonna stop until...

4383
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:33,160
I won't stop until I get to 50,000.

4384
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:35,680
Come over here, Cammy.

4385
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:36,280
Thank you.

4386
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:38,140
Alright.

4387
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:40,360
I just wanted to do that.

4388
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:40,520
It's like KunoGeef.

4389
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:41,380
Yeah, it happens.

4390
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:42,840
I mean, you're gonna get... Is he actually playing Geef?

4391
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:44,020
Wait, let me... I don't know.

4392
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:44,320
Look at that.

4393
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:44,520
Yeah.

4394
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,340
He's in the room.

4395
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:46,960
Oh, yeah.

4396
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:48,140
You need to get in.

4397
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:48,560
Oh, wait.

4398
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:49,400
Oh, okay.

4399
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:50,260
Let me... Get in there.

4400
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:51,640
You got what you wish for.

4401
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:52,240
Wait, is he actually...

4402
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:52,800
Oh, my God.

4403
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:54,160
We're gonna do a GEEF mirror match?

4404
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:55,180
Do it.

4405
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:55,840
Oh, my God.

4406
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:56,960
Do it for the fans.

4407
02:26:57,480 --> 02:26:58,520
Do it for the fans.

4408
02:26:58,680 --> 02:26:58,700
Okay, guys.

4409
02:26:58,700 --> 02:26:59,160
It's time.

4410
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:00,440
Just grab each other all day.

4411
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:03,960
He's actually... Oh, my... I've been practicing Cammy this entire time.

4412
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:04,520
Are you...

4413
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:04,860
Okay.

4414
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:08,340
Get in there.

4415
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,580
What did we miss?

4416
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:12,920
Oh, it's like Kuno's playing Geef.

4417
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:13,520
It's gonna be great.

4418
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:13,940
Is it actually?

4419
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:15,920
No, I think he's swapping now.

4420
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,420
No, he's switching.

4421
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,800
He was just memeing.

4422
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:18,880
He was just memeing.

4423
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:19,780
Ah, okay.

4424
02:27:19,980 --> 02:27:22,600
He wanted to... That doesn't work on Toki.

4425
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:22,860
What?

4426
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:26,060
She was excited for a second.

4427
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:26,620
Yeah.

4428
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:28,440
I was like, Oh, my God.

4429
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:28,960
Really?

4430
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:29,920
Bro.

4431
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,160
Get back on... No.

4432
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:32,660
Get back on Geef.

4433
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,020
Get back on Geef.

4434
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:36,780
My arch nemesis regular diaphone.

4435
02:27:36,980 --> 02:27:38,080
No fuck.

4436
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:44,640
No... Get your ass on Geef.

4437
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:47,260
Get your ass on Geef.

4438
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:49,160
No balls.

4439
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:52,660
Why are you running?

4440
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:53,560
Why are you running?

4441
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:54,540
No balls.

4442
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,140
Your stream title is a lie.

4443
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:06,560
Oh, you won the coin flip.

4444
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:07,480
Let's go.

4445
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:08,340
Oh, did I?

4446
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:09,480
I didn't even pay attention.

4447
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:11,340
Let's go.

4448
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:13,260
I didn't even pay attention.

4449
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:15,580
A true fighter will pick Geef.

4450
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:19,160
I can't believe it.

4451
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:20,560
I was so excited I can't believe it.

4452
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:21,200
I was so excited for the mirror match.

4453
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:22,720
Oh, well.

4454
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:24,600
I was like, Yeah, let's fucking go.

4455
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,340
That means I'm happy.

4456
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:26,660
He ain't ready.

4457
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:29,640
I wanted to do it on mirror match, though.

4458
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,620
It would've been so funny.

4459
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:32,500
Mirror match is...

4460
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:33,540
Oh, yeah.

4461
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:36,040
Brian wants to bark a little bit this time.

4462
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:38,960
He said, just a little bit, but whatever.

4463
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:39,700
A little bit of barking?

4464
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:42,000
Alright, you guys get out of my Overwatch or whatever the fuck.

4465
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:42,840
I'll bark.

4466
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:43,960
Whatever she wants to do.

4467
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:45,760
Oh, yeah.

4468
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:46,900
He's so scared.

4469
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:47,400
Look at him.

4470
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:49,860
I don't think you see I'd say a damn thing.

4471
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:50,620
What?

4472
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:53,020
Oh, yeah.

4473
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:53,780
He's so scared.

4474
02:28:55,480 --> 02:28:57,320
Just conserve your meter and you're good.

4475
02:28:57,440 --> 02:28:57,540
Just conserve your meter and you're good.

4476
02:28:58,160 --> 02:28:58,640
Dude.

4477
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:02,580
Oh, look at that tickle, dude.

4478
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:03,900
Oh, look at that tickle, dude.

4479
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:05,760
Is he neutral jumping a lot?

4480
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:07,920
Yeah, just lay it, brother.

4481
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:07,920
Yeah.

4482
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:08,000
Yeah, just lay it, brother.

4483
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:08,660
Yeah.

4484
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:11,040
Get in there.

4485
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,520
Yeah, let's not do that.

4486
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:13,960
Let's not do that, Max.

4487
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,540
We got the R1, right?

4488
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:19,040
He's just gonna do jab, jab, jab into GI.

4489
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:19,540
Yeah.

4490
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,280
Okay.

4491
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:21,480
Yeah.

4492
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:24,160
So once he hits you, you're winning.

4493
02:29:24,220 --> 02:29:26,360
Once he hits you once, you block it out a little bit and you're good.

4494
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:28,040
You got this.

4495
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:32,600
Look at this neutral.

4496
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,180
I'm impressed.

4497
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:36,880
That's very smooth.

4498
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:38,060
He's got combos?

4499
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:39,700
Yeah, he's got combos, yeah.

4500
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:42,160
He gave me the controller.

4501
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:46,960
That's a move I hadn't seen before.

4502
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:47,340
Yeah.

4503
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:53,080
You are mine.

4504
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:57,340
He's jumping on your wake up.

4505
02:29:57,480 --> 02:29:58,500
So just chill.

4506
02:29:58,920 --> 02:29:59,440
Yeah.

4507
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:04,140
You got the feedback.

4508
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:06,040
Russia.

4509
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:07,320
Mother Russia.

4510
02:30:07,320 --> 02:30:07,880
Oh, he's Russian.

4511
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:09,120
Yeah, he fought a bear.

4512
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,420
Yeah, that's where the scars come from.

4513
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:15,900
He's doing moves I've actually never seen before, so I'm like a bit confused.

4514
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:19,980
Yeah, you just gotta block on wake up, Doki, because when he gets near you, he can jump.

4515
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:20,880
He's doing this move.

4516
02:30:20,980 --> 02:30:22,560
I don't know what to do for that move, though.

4517
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:23,280
You need to block.

4518
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:24,660
Yeah, just block and then do DI.

4519
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:26,020
Okay.

4520
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:27,060
Yeah.

4521
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,280
Yep, good blocks.

4522
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:29,820
See?

4523
02:30:30,020 --> 02:30:30,340
Exactly.

4524
02:30:30,340 --> 02:30:32,660
He's walked a little and then he has to approach you.

4525
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:33,400
There you go.

4526
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:34,140
Go ham.

4527
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:34,700
Go ham.

4528
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:35,240
Let's go.

4529
02:30:36,460 --> 02:30:37,140
Get in there.

4530
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,040
Let the demons out.

4531
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:39,440
Okay.

4532
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:40,060
Nice.

4533
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:40,480
Yeah.

4534
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,380
Keep going.

4535
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:42,940
Keep going.

4536
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:44,860
Don't let up.

4537
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:46,900
Okay, you're good.

4538
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:47,500
Don't let up.

4539
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:49,180
Block a little.

4540
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:49,800
Just block a little.

4541
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:50,780
Cool.

4542
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:51,160
Yeah.

4543
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:52,940
Now, just conserve your meter.

4544
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:53,380
Get in there.

4545
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:55,980
This playstyle has been downloaded.

4546
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:57,160
Okay.

4547
02:30:58,260 --> 02:30:59,360
Download complete, amigo!

4548
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:00,740
Oh my gosh.

4549
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:02,680
Download complete.

4550
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:05,120
The main thing is just block a little if he hits you and then you get to play again.

4551
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:05,460
That's it.

4552
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,240
And then you win.

4553
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:08,880
Where are you going?

4554
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:13,840
I'm not going to jump anymore.

4555
02:31:13,980 --> 02:31:14,980
Just block a little.

4556
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:15,360
Yeah!

4557
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:16,240
Nice!

4558
02:31:17,860 --> 02:31:18,180
Oh!

4559
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:22,420
You had a good idea though.

4560
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:22,840
Yeah, I did.

4561
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:24,580
I knew he was going to do that.

4562
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:24,980
Just block.

4563
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:27,340
You just got to block when he knocks you down.

4564
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:27,800
That's it.

4565
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:28,000
Okay.

4566
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:29,500
Now he's going to try to throw.

4567
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:30,000
You can jump.

4568
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:30,560
Yeah!

4569
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:30,920
Get him!

4570
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:32,100
Nice putting!

4571
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:33,960
Damage.

4572
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:36,820
Level 3 on the table.

4573
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:38,620
Yeah, if you get a DI...

4574
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:39,580
For the loyal fans.

4575
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:42,180
He's so scared of it.

4576
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:42,760
He's very aware.

4577
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:44,120
He's so scared, Doki.

4578
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:45,880
You have no idea how scared he is.

4579
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:47,020
Jump at him.

4580
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:48,920
Yeah, what's he going to do?

4581
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:50,020
He does this.

4582
02:31:50,380 --> 02:31:52,120
Yeah, get him!

4583
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:52,740
Level 3!

4584
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:53,060
Level 3!

4585
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:53,360
Level 3!

4586
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:54,780
One more.

4587
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:56,340
One more and you got it.

4588
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,000
I need one more.

4589
02:31:58,660 --> 02:32:02,440
Oh, do that.

4590
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:03,700
Sit on him again, bro.

4591
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,480
You can press squares.

4592
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:05,740
Sit on him.

4593
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:06,360
Nice.

4594
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:06,920
Okay.

4595
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,120
Let's go.

4596
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:11,860
I think he likes it when you sit on him.

4597
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:15,000
Yeah, the wheel kick.

4598
02:32:15,020 --> 02:32:15,720
I'm going to call it that.

4599
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:17,280
What's that move?

4600
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,360
No, that's that move.

4601
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:20,380
The wheel kick?

4602
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:21,480
Yeah.

4603
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:22,220
Yeah, the wheel kick.

4604
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:27,140
Get in there.

4605
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:29,500
No good.

4606
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:32,280
Just block and wake up.

4607
02:32:32,300 --> 02:32:32,640
Just block.

4608
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:34,060
Nice.

4609
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,540
Oh, I like that.

4610
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:36,320
Lariat.

4611
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:38,040
Yeah.

4612
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:42,080
Good try.

4613
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:42,540
Just block.

4614
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:42,920
Just block.

4615
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:43,300
You're good.

4616
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Yeah, just block it out.

4617
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:46,380
No problem.

4618
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:47,560
Wow.

4619
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:48,940
Gave you the controller again.

4620
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:51,200
Nice anti-air.

4621
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:51,820
Here we go, Doki.

4622
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:52,380
You're in there.

4623
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,840
Let the demons out.

4624
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,280
Every one of his combos is just one of your grabs.

4625
02:32:58,600 --> 02:32:58,940
Yeah.

4626
02:32:59,000 --> 02:32:59,820
Drive rush at him.

4627
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:00,640
Just do something.

4628
02:33:00,700 --> 02:33:01,080
Get in there.

4629
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:03,280
Yeah, make something happen.

4630
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:04,220
Yeah.

4631
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,540
Okay, just block a little.

4632
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:07,220
You're good.

4633
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:07,980
He has to play your game.

4634
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:10,540
Yes, now just walk towards him.

4635
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:11,080
Jump at him.

4636
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:12,520
Don't use that move.

4637
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:13,580
That's the only move you don't want to use.

4638
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:14,440
Yeah, that's it.

4639
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:14,960
Don't do that.

4640
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,080
Dribble the bar.

4641
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:18,680
Nice.

4642
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:19,740
Yeah, just chill on your meter.

4643
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:22,160
And then just keep walking towards him.

4644
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:24,580
And then jump with an axe or something.

4645
02:33:24,900 --> 02:33:27,620
Oh, I didn't realize I can't throw that.

4646
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:28,660
Don't worry.

4647
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:29,200
Just block.

4648
02:33:29,380 --> 02:33:29,860
Very good.

4649
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:30,580
You're still in there.

4650
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:31,640
You're so alive.

4651
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:32,100
We're good, gamer.

4652
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:34,820
No worries.

4653
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:35,840
That's cool.

4654
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:37,020
Just gotta block and wake up.

4655
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:38,000
And you beat him.

4656
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:41,380
Or grabs.

4657
02:33:45,100 --> 02:33:45,840
Yeah, go at him.

4658
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:47,240
Don't overthink.

4659
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:47,780
Drive rush in there.

4660
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:49,460
Yeah, don't overthink.

4661
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:50,420
Don't worry about it.

4662
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:51,680
Just block after this.

4663
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:52,560
You're mashing DI.

4664
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:53,080
Just block.

4665
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:55,640
No worries.

4666
02:33:55,820 --> 02:33:56,180
Okay.

4667
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:56,420
Okay.

4668
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:00,960
Nice.

4669
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:01,880
Nice.

4670
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:02,420
There you go.

4671
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:02,860
Now you're out.

4672
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:04,580
No worries.

4673
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:08,740
I'm a believer.

4674
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:10,660
I'm a believer too.

4675
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:12,080
Yeah!

4676
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:14,320
He does wake up.

4677
02:34:15,460 --> 02:34:17,380
He just guessed right there.

4678
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:17,760
Whatever.

4679
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:21,220
You're in there.

4680
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:23,820
He's so scared.

4681
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:25,020
His heart rate's racing.

4682
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:27,900
I don't know what to do here though.

4683
02:34:28,060 --> 02:34:29,020
Oh my goodness.

4684
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:36,160
My loyal fans.

4685
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:37,800
My loyal fans.

4686
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:41,660
Do it for the fans.

4687
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,480
Nice jump.

4688
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:46,200
Nice triangle.

4689
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:47,340
That's perfect!

4690
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:50,460
Let's go.

4691
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,420
Nice comeback, Doki.

4692
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:51,980
One more.

4693
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:53,180
Let's get it.

4694
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:55,420
One more and you're done for the day.

4695
02:34:58,580 --> 02:35:01,400
Oh, I keep forgetting I can't grab that when he does that.

4696
02:35:02,060 --> 02:35:02,220
Cool.

4697
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:05,860
It's just the tickle.

4698
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:07,760
This is just one grab.

4699
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:08,720
Don't sweat it.

4700
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:11,480
Oh my god, that angle.

4701
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:13,720
They know what they're doing.

4702
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:15,320
Nice.

4703
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:15,860
Nice angle.

4704
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,660
I didn't mean to do that.

4705
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:20,960
That was a mistake.

4706
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:21,340
That doesn't matter.

4707
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:21,620
Okay.

4708
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:23,160
Yeah, I get it sometimes too.

4709
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:25,460
Okay.

4710
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:26,620
Nice.

4711
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:27,520
No.

4712
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:38,600
Nice try.

4713
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:40,620
Don't sweat it.

4714
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:41,660
That was close.

4715
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:43,440
We'll handle this.

4716
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,440
No worries, Doki.

4717
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:45,380
We got this.

4718
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,060
We'll avenge you.

4719
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:48,820
We'll do our best.

4720
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:50,840
Why do we have to lose, guys?

4721
02:35:51,020 --> 02:35:51,240
That was a good try, Doki.

4722
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:53,140
We got nothing to lose.

4723
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:56,480
I've never seen him even in my custom.

4724
02:35:56,660 --> 02:35:57,760
So I was so confused.

4725
02:35:58,540 --> 02:35:59,680
He was doing combos.

4726
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:00,420
That's the thing.

4727
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:02,940
If he hit you, he actually turned it into a lot of damage.

4728
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:03,980
Yeah.

4729
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:05,820
So he leveled up.

4730
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:07,780
Dude, Amur is so toxic.

4731
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:08,560
What is this?

4732
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:10,320
What is this E Honda?

4733
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:13,060
What is she doing?

4734
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:14,900
What is going on with this Honda?

4735
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:16,380
Oh, she picked Honda?

4736
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:18,780
They're just memeing, dude.

4737
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,020
There's no way.

4738
02:36:20,020 --> 02:36:20,600
That's not real.

4739
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:21,300
Okay.

4740
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:24,540
It doesn't matter.

4741
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:26,580
I think the entire team is going to do this.

4742
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:27,280
I'm calling it.

4743
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:28,860
Let's see.

4744
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:30,640
Okay, wait a minute.

4745
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:32,040
Oh, never mind.

4746
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:34,360
Oh, he's actually playing Honda?

4747
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,400
Yeah, she's on Honda.

4748
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:36,900
What the heck?

4749
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:41,320
A matchmaking error occurred.

4750
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,680
Oh, my goodness.

4751
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:44,000
Oh, no.

4752
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:44,920
Not again.

4753
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:46,300
Damn.

4754
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:50,280
Might have to make that lobby thing again.

4755
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:51,360
Again?

4756
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,480
The DC again?

4757
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,960
The matchmaking error will stay.

4758
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:55,560
It won't go away.

4759
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:57,720
Yeah, I think you have to do a private ask.

4760
02:36:58,400 --> 02:36:59,180
Oh, it's loading?

4761
02:36:59,380 --> 02:36:59,920
Oh, it's loading.

4762
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:01,060
Oh, nice.

4763
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:06,140
This is the first time this has happened.

4764
02:37:07,220 --> 02:37:08,260
It fixed itself.

4765
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,960
It just randomly fixed itself.

4766
02:37:11,060 --> 02:37:11,920
Do your thing.

4767
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:15,160
And remember, if we don't make it, Seijam is still giving us 60+.

4768
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:15,560
It's okay.

4769
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:16,280
We don't make it.

4770
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:16,740
We're free.

4771
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:18,440
That's like a new game.

4772
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:20,560
Still giving us 60 bucks, bro.

4773
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:21,180
I can't believe it.

4774
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:22,680
And a controller, apparently.

4775
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:24,120
Wait, we get a controller?

4776
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:25,040
Holy shit.

4777
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:25,500
Hell yeah.

4778
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:27,840
I'm just a Seijam controller collector.

4779
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:28,620
Hell yeah.

4780
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:32,160
Oh, get in there, SK.

4781
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:35,120
Nice.

4782
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:36,560
Very good.

4783
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:38,680
This is the game.

4784
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:41,100
Yeah, keep walking forward.

4785
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:44,340
Mm-hmm.

4786
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:44,920
Mm-hmm.

4787
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:47,660
Dude, I'm more.

4788
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:49,600
What are we doing?

4789
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:50,420
Nice.

4790
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:51,720
Get in there, get in there.

4791
02:37:56,210 --> 02:37:57,270
Oh my god.

4792
02:37:57,290 --> 02:38:02,890
Was she, like, playing this off stream all night?

4793
02:38:03,310 --> 02:38:03,470
Again.

4794
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:06,490
Oh, good punish, too.

4795
02:38:07,530 --> 02:38:08,210
Uh-huh.

4796
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:09,150
Time to go in.

4797
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:10,790
You know how to play this.

4798
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,570
That's cool.

4799
02:38:12,990 --> 02:38:13,430
Nice.

4800
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:18,940
Nice.

4801
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:22,580
Uh-huh.

4802
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:23,060
Oh.

4803
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:24,220
That's okay.

4804
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:24,700
That's cool.

4805
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:26,300
Keep it cool.

4806
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:28,700
Get in there.

4807
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:30,840
That was a punish.

4808
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:31,920
You know it.

4809
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:32,620
You know the matchup.

4810
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:32,940
Let's go.

4811
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:33,900
Yep.

4812
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:37,920
All right.

4813
02:38:41,260 --> 02:38:42,260
That was fake.

4814
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:43,000
No worries.

4815
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:46,040
Here's some beans.

4816
02:38:46,460 --> 02:38:47,120
Oh, nice.

4817
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:54,840
Cool.

4818
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:56,160
That's cool.

4819
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:56,740
It's cool.

4820
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:57,520
It's cool.

4821
02:38:57,520 --> 02:38:58,160
Rock it out.

4822
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:01,260
What the fuck?

4823
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:01,700
I think I know.

4824
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,380
It's modern.

4825
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:05,780
Oh, it's modern.

4826
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:08,640
Yeah, they're just gonna try to get a random combo.

4827
02:39:08,660 --> 02:39:09,940
Go live if it's modern, yeah.

4828
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:14,860
I believe in the comeback.

4829
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:16,840
Very good.

4830
02:39:19,300 --> 02:39:20,600
I believe in the comeback.

4831
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:21,340
I believe in the comeback.

4832
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:24,080
It will be grand.

4833
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:25,780
It will be grand.

4834
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:28,480
Get in there.

4835
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,560
Get in there.

4836
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:31,920
Get in there.

4837
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:36,760
Oh, that's okay.

4838
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:38,140
Oh, that was so close.

4839
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:39,000
The comeback was insane, though.

4840
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:40,840
You got this.

4841
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:42,280
You're playing really good.

4842
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,640
Yeah, confidence.

4843
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:48,240
I like that.

4844
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:48,840
Get in there.

4845
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:53,300
Just block after you finish your moves.

4846
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:54,300
Okay.

4847
02:39:55,060 --> 02:39:55,520
You're good.

4848
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:01,780
Nice!

4849
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,920
Yeah, let's go!

4850
02:40:05,380 --> 02:40:06,660
Oh my god, that was insane.

4851
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:10,740
Those perfect parry trainings are starting to pay off.

4852
02:40:11,060 --> 02:40:12,480
Just block after...

4853
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:13,480
Yeah, just block, remember.

4854
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:14,600
She's just mashing.

4855
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:19,640
Nice anti-air.

4856
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:23,800
How come everybody jumps for you guys but no one jumps for me anymore?

4857
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,400
Is that unfunishable?

4858
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:25,720
It's negative.

4859
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:26,300
It's negative.

4860
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:27,060
You can move first.

4861
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:31,020
Nice!

4862
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:34,360
You have it.

4863
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,540
You can kill next hit.

4864
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:36,960
Ah!

4865
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:39,200
Oh my god!

4866
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,820
We take those!

4867
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:42,060
We take those!

4868
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:44,880
Yeah, Espy, you're playing so good.

4869
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:46,900
Just remember, after your turn's over, just block.

4870
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,800
She's just mashing auto-combo and it goes into the big hands.

4871
02:40:50,060 --> 02:40:53,300
And then you can just jump away after you block the big hands or press medium.

4872
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:57,080
So if you just block after your turn, she's gonna waste meter and it's all over.

4873
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:58,240
So, that's it.

4874
02:40:58,280 --> 02:40:58,880
That's a win.

4875
02:40:59,140 --> 02:41:04,000
I just noticed all the people I fought stopped jumping and then you guys get all the jumpers.

4876
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:04,680
It's not fair.

4877
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:07,040
I literally had to...

4878
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:07,940
You wanna switch seeds?

4879
02:41:08,980 --> 02:41:09,860
No, that's fine.

4880
02:41:09,940 --> 02:41:10,760
But it's just not fair.

4881
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:14,180
Everybody literally stopped jumping today.

4882
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:17,680
I did not do a single air SPD because of it.

4883
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:25,090
Doskoi.

4884
02:41:26,970 --> 02:41:27,430
Headbutts.

4885
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:33,660
Oh, you were going for the hard stuff.

4886
02:41:33,980 --> 02:41:35,520
Yeah, just dry brush in.

4887
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:36,780
Okay.

4888
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:39,320
Yeah, I say just dry brush in.

4889
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:41,960
After she does a headbutt, she jumps away.

4890
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:44,260
Just walk forward and try to gain ground.

4891
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:45,920
Yeah, get in there, dude!

4892
02:41:46,360 --> 02:41:46,820
Yeah!

4893
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:49,860
Oh, nice!

4894
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:53,800
Oh, nice!

4895
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:54,660
Almost.

4896
02:41:54,760 --> 02:41:55,760
Now we just block it out.

4897
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:56,760
We're good.

4898
02:41:56,920 --> 02:41:58,020
We just blocked, remember?

4899
02:41:58,220 --> 02:41:59,120
We do a little mashing.

4900
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:00,520
We do a little mashing.

4901
02:42:00,580 --> 02:42:01,180
Yeah, it's fine.

4902
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:01,740
Yeah!

4903
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:03,160
We have a little perfect pairing!

4904
02:42:03,160 --> 02:42:04,660
And the optimal combo!

4905
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:08,000
Woo!

4906
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:08,760
There we go.

4907
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:09,220
We're mashing too.

4908
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:10,600
Okay.

4909
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:12,400
Oh, burnt out.

4910
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:13,280
Time to party.

4911
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:16,500
Time to party now.

4912
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:17,360
We started now.

4913
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:18,600
Now.

4914
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:20,020
Nice!

4915
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:21,200
Level 3.

4916
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:23,020
Ayyyy.

4917
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:24,880
Nice try, nice try.

4918
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:28,060
Yeah, she's doing heavy headbutt.

4919
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:28,800
The one you can DI.

4920
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,580
So if you want to do that when she does it fullscreen, that's okay too.

4921
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:33,680
But just remember, just block after your turn.

4922
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:36,000
And then dry brush in when you have a gap.

4923
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:37,540
We do a little mashing here.

4924
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:41,940
Okay.

4925
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:45,800
Yeah, get in there!

4926
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:50,700
Nice!

4927
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:51,060
Nice!

4928
02:42:52,040 --> 02:42:52,400
Holy...

4929
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:54,640
It's okay, it's okay.

4930
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:57,080
Nice.

4931
02:42:58,580 --> 02:42:59,380
That's fine.

4932
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:02,180
She's gonna randomly headbutt.

4933
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:03,440
Oh my god.

4934
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:05,660
Sykkuno totally punk told him to stop.

4935
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:07,400
Don't jump against me.

4936
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:08,860
Let's see.

4937
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:10,160
Stop jumping!

4938
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:11,880
The world champion difference.

4939
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:12,640
Yes.

4940
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:14,240
Almost had it.

4941
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:20,660
Just after he hits you, just keep blocking.

4942
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:20,920
Just block.

4943
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:21,420
Okay.

4944
02:43:21,560 --> 02:43:22,440
Yes, just block.

4945
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:23,820
Those moves are very unsafe.

4946
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,300
I hate blocking too.

4947
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:28,780
Where's my movement?

4948
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,300
Why can't I go into the z-axis?

4949
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:33,460
Nice.

4950
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:34,880
She's blocking a lot, you can throw her.

4951
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:37,320
Nice.

4952
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:37,960
Yep,

4953
02:43:49,310 --> 02:43:50,970
this is the evil of modern Honda.

4954
02:43:54,110 --> 02:43:54,990
But we...

4955
02:43:54,990 --> 02:43:58,130
I mean, you have a Honda, but we have an SK, dude.

4956
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:01,750
I need to stop doing that.

4957
02:44:01,890 --> 02:44:02,890
Just block, yeah.

4958
02:44:03,030 --> 02:44:03,470
Just block.

4959
02:44:04,030 --> 02:44:05,950
Yeah, just gotta block after your turn's over.

4960
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:09,590
You're still alive.

4961
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:12,710
You got this.

4962
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:15,670
You're still alive.

4963
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:25,970
I hate this.

4964
02:44:26,690 --> 02:44:27,570
This neutral...

4965
02:44:28,410 --> 02:44:29,630
Aww, that's close.

4966
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:32,290
Good try, SK.

4967
02:44:33,630 --> 02:44:35,230
But I know where it's brutal.

4968
02:44:35,690 --> 02:44:37,730
It's really hard to learn it on the fly.

4969
02:44:37,930 --> 02:44:38,370
You know what I mean?

4970
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:38,870
Yeah.

4971
02:44:39,250 --> 02:44:41,390
We can't expect that of anybody.

4972
02:44:41,730 --> 02:44:42,530
That was a good try, though.

4973
02:44:42,630 --> 02:44:44,930
I 100% understand.

4974
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:47,090
Alright, BrawlPro.

4975
02:44:47,410 --> 02:44:48,510
You got this, dude.

4976
02:44:48,750 --> 02:44:49,290
Where are you fighting?

4977
02:44:49,470 --> 02:44:50,090
Oh, you're fighting Fi.

4978
02:44:50,270 --> 02:44:51,350
Okay, back to Tekken.

4979
02:44:52,010 --> 02:44:53,230
Back to Tekken.

4980
02:44:54,710 --> 02:44:57,950
I was gonna say, that's not BrawlPro.

4981
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:01,490
Let's do this.

4982
02:45:01,770 --> 02:45:01,970
Let's do this.

4983
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:05,950
I knew I should've learned Modern Bison today.

4984
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:06,810
I knew I should've learned Modern Bison today.

4985
02:45:06,810 --> 02:45:07,950
For the ultra mixup.

4986
02:45:09,530 --> 02:45:10,430
Alright, Fi.

4987
02:45:10,570 --> 02:45:11,930
Let's have a good fight, man.

4988
02:45:12,310 --> 02:45:13,470
Let's have a good fight.

4989
02:45:14,290 --> 02:45:14,730
Yeah.

4990
02:45:16,030 --> 02:45:16,970
I'll just play my best.

4991
02:45:16,970 --> 02:45:19,590
Is he traumatized from fighting you in all the slams already?

4992
02:45:19,890 --> 02:45:20,090
He's fine.

4993
02:45:20,510 --> 02:45:21,390
He's fine.

4994
02:45:22,930 --> 02:45:24,650
Use that buff in your favor.

4995
02:45:24,750 --> 02:45:25,290
That's all I'm saying.

4996
02:45:25,290 --> 02:45:26,910
Yeah, okay.

4997
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:27,970
Go.

4998
02:45:28,750 --> 02:45:29,470
Yes,

4999
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:37,300
sir.

5000
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:38,860
Headbutt.

5001
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,080
Oh, yeah.

5002
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:42,800
Oh, please.

5003
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:44,340
Oh, yeah.

5004
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:45,360
Let's go.

5005
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:48,860
Let's go.

5006
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:50,160
That's a good first round.

5007
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:53,600
Uh-huh.

5008
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,200
Uh-huh.

5009
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:57,020
Stay in the ground, amigo.

5010
02:45:58,160 --> 02:45:58,560
Oh.

5011
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:00,680
Oh.

5012
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:02,400
Was that what I thought it was?

5013
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:03,100
I got full screen.

5014
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:03,500
It's fine.

5015
02:46:03,580 --> 02:46:04,100
I got full screen.

5016
02:46:04,120 --> 02:46:06,800
Yeah, just don't press too much and you're good.

5017
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:07,800
Nice.

5018
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:08,040
Good job.

5019
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:09,860
That's fine.

5020
02:46:12,340 --> 02:46:12,740
Yes.

5021
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:13,380
Sit down.

5022
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:16,120
Level 2.

5023
02:46:17,020 --> 02:46:18,740
Oh, he gave up his corner.

5024
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:19,900
Yep.

5025
02:46:19,900 --> 02:46:20,300
Go.

5026
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:22,240
Now you're playing Street Fighter.

5027
02:46:23,060 --> 02:46:23,500
You're good.

5028
02:46:23,580 --> 02:46:23,980
You're good.

5029
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:25,940
This is Street Fighter.

5030
02:46:26,380 --> 02:46:26,780
Wait.

5031
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:27,620
Oh, my God.

5032
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:29,160
Just for all that damage?

5033
02:46:29,260 --> 02:46:30,180
That's all she did?

5034
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:31,360
Yeah, dude.

5035
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,120
She tickles you for a couple of...

5036
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:35,960
She got to tickle you a couple of times to win.

5037
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:38,580
Oh, no.

5038
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:39,260
It's not fair.

5039
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:40,460
He's jumping, too.

5040
02:46:40,700 --> 02:46:41,260
He's choking.

5041
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:41,680
Don't worry.

5042
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:44,600
Oh, yeah.

5043
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:46,260
Yep, yep, yep.

5044
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:47,220
What the fuck?

5045
02:46:47,260 --> 02:46:48,560
This Cammy can jump?

5046
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:50,460
Where's my jumping Cammy?

5047
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:52,660
Seeing everybody.

5048
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:53,020
Oh.

5049
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:56,480
Buddy, stop jumping.

5050
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:57,760
It's so stupid.

5051
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,400
All Tykudo did was jump.

5052
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:01,000
I'm sorry.

5053
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:01,840
He keeps saying that.

5054
02:47:02,580 --> 02:47:03,360
He jumped.

5055
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:06,000
It's the truth.

5056
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:08,100
Reality check.

5057
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:09,580
They jumped every time.

5058
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:11,380
Tykudo jumped every single time.

5059
02:47:11,380 --> 02:47:12,360
No, he didn't jump at me.

5060
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:13,540
Yes, he did.

5061
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:14,260
Over and over.

5062
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:15,740
Yes, he did.

5063
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:17,280
Get in there.

5064
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:18,780
Not when it mattered.

5065
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:22,740
That's true.

5066
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:23,660
He didn't do it when it mattered.

5067
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,380
I agree with you there.

5068
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:25,120
True.

5069
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:28,980
Oh, the low.

5070
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:29,920
I have to hold down back.

5071
02:47:30,060 --> 02:47:30,960
That's a problem I have.

5072
02:47:31,620 --> 02:47:32,860
Oh, they're burnt out, though.

5073
02:47:33,700 --> 02:47:34,580
Oh, come on.

5074
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:36,020
I hate when they end up on the other side.

5075
02:47:36,220 --> 02:47:37,220
And I try to anti it.

5076
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:41,100
Yeah, it's fine.

5077
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:43,360
No worries.

5078
02:47:45,860 --> 02:47:46,940
Okay, let's stop jumping.

5079
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:49,440
I'm coming.

5080
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:53,660
There we go.

5081
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:54,820
There we go.

5082
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:00,890
Okay, get some meter back.

5083
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:01,950
Okay, get some meter back.

5084
02:48:01,950 --> 02:48:02,330
Yeah, nice play.

5085
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:04,310
Damn it.

5086
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:05,670
That's fine.

5087
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:06,710
Just tickles.

5088
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:10,110
Oh, nice.

5089
02:48:11,470 --> 02:48:12,530
They're in the corner.

5090
02:48:12,730 --> 02:48:13,950
Nice, Lariat.

5091
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:14,690
Yes.

5092
02:48:15,310 --> 02:48:16,330
Hold down back.

5093
02:48:17,290 --> 02:48:19,450
Does that do anything?

5094
02:48:20,730 --> 02:48:21,770
He's fine.

5095
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:23,930
Oh, never mind.

5096
02:48:23,990 --> 02:48:24,770
I'm looking at the wrong one.

5097
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:25,510
Woo.

5098
02:48:29,070 --> 02:48:29,450
Nice.

5099
02:48:29,530 --> 02:48:30,150
Nice duck.

5100
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:34,410
I was looking for level one.

5101
02:48:34,730 --> 02:48:35,890
Oh, that would have been sick.

5102
02:48:36,890 --> 02:48:37,270
Oh.

5103
02:48:41,070 --> 02:48:42,670
Oh, you do have level three on stuff.

5104
02:48:43,970 --> 02:48:45,470
I understand if you want to save it.

5105
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:48,230
Save it for round three.

5106
02:48:48,810 --> 02:48:49,190
Ugh.

5107
02:48:51,530 --> 02:48:51,910
Fuck.

5108
02:48:52,730 --> 02:48:53,850
Good jump, good jump, good jump.

5109
02:48:54,430 --> 02:48:54,750
Okay.

5110
02:48:54,930 --> 02:48:57,430
You've got a lot of blows into drive rush, right?

5111
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:57,830
Yeah.

5112
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:59,210
So you've got to block your toes.

5113
02:48:59,670 --> 02:49:01,310
If he gets a throw, that's fine.

5114
02:49:01,830 --> 02:49:02,150
Okay.

5115
02:49:02,830 --> 02:49:04,530
You're just exposing the toes a lot.

5116
02:49:05,230 --> 02:49:05,550
Yeah.

5117
02:49:06,130 --> 02:49:08,270
But just don't be scared to rush him down either.

5118
02:49:08,350 --> 02:49:09,690
He gets so flustered when you rush him.

5119
02:49:16,590 --> 02:49:17,210
Here you go.

5120
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:17,650
Nice sweep.

5121
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:20,090
Yeah.

5122
02:49:23,570 --> 02:49:24,470
Nice poke him.

5123
02:49:26,310 --> 02:49:26,750
Nice.

5124
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:32,540
Dammit.

5125
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:33,800
I'm playing really bad.

5126
02:49:34,580 --> 02:49:35,020
There we go.

5127
02:49:35,340 --> 02:49:35,780
Composure.

5128
02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:37,720
You got this.

5129
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:39,300
that was a little messed up, exactly.

5130
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:45,100
Yes, sir.

5131
02:49:45,220 --> 02:49:45,560
Ooh.

5132
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:46,520
Get that damage.

5133
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:49,980
Wow, he did that.

5134
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:50,760
That finally is cornered.

5135
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:52,400
Yes!

5136
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:54,200
Nice throw!

5137
02:49:54,480 --> 02:49:55,780
Take her to church!

5138
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:56,860
Go!

5139
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:05,700
God, driver's knee sucks.

5140
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:12,080
Two?

5141
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:13,720
Oh, he's buffering that DP.

5142
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:16,860
My driver's knee is godlike.

5143
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:21,520
Oh my gosh, the mind games here.

5144
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:26,720
Oh yeah, me chillin'.

5145
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:27,620
Yeah!

5146
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:29,080
Nice.

5147
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:31,500
The entire room is crazy.

5148
02:50:32,020 --> 02:50:33,100
Here we go.

5149
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:40,200
Oh my god!

5150
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:41,180
Nice hit!

5151
02:50:42,820 --> 02:50:44,560
Is he dead?

5152
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:45,160
It's gonna be close.

5153
02:50:45,400 --> 02:50:46,560
No, I don't think he's dead.

5154
02:50:46,720 --> 02:50:47,560
Oh my god!

5155
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:48,540
Classic!

5156
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:52,020
Yo, brother, that was sick.

5157
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:53,660
No, that's a Twitch clip.

5158
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:54,960
Bro, bro, bro!

5159
02:50:55,100 --> 02:50:57,740
I gotta get his reaction for that one.

5160
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:59,600
You gotta get his reaction?

5161
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:01,260
That's fuuuck!

5162
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:03,680
That's fuuuck!

5163
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:05,300
Holy shit.

5164
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:06,680
My loyal fans!

5165
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:08,760
Alright, time to go home, chat.

5166
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:11,420
This is it.

5167
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:12,360
You got this, co.

5168
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:13,040
Remember it.

5169
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:13,980
Time to go home, chat.

5170
02:51:14,680 --> 02:51:15,440
FFXIV awaits.

5171
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:17,720
You know how to play against them.

5172
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:19,020
You got this.

5173
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:21,440
Alright.

5174
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:22,740
We were in the lab.

5175
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:24,400
Let's go, man.

5176
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:27,180
If I do lose this, I'm sorry.

5177
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:28,500
That's alright.

5178
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,140
We're free.

5179
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:29,900
You've been cooking?

5180
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:30,740
You got this.

5181
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:33,900
He's playing modern, so he does DP.

5182
02:51:34,780 --> 02:51:36,540
Whatever you had, did it hit?

5183
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:37,780
What?

5184
02:51:39,860 --> 02:51:41,220
Co, just blame on that.

5185
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:42,460
Whatever you had there.

5186
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:46,360
What's hitting is his time in training mode and practicing diligently.

5187
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:48,040
That's what's hitting right now.

5188
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:50,540
Oh, you're the Latino diaphone?

5189
02:51:50,780 --> 02:51:51,140
Okay.

5190
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:53,500
Yeah, I'm the Latino diaphone.

5191
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:54,680
What happened to the other guy?

5192
02:51:55,860 --> 02:51:56,460
Which one?

5193
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,600
I do a different player every day.

5194
02:51:58,760 --> 02:51:59,120
Oh.

5195
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:06,580
Yeah, so I was the Hispanic broski, I was the Spanish Hikaru, and now I'm the Latino diaphone.

5196
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:08,220
All of them are Aki players.

5197
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:09,760
Someone in my chat was like, B is so sad.

5198
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:17,500
When you lose to random drivers level 3 from Beef, it's okay to feel sad.

5199
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:20,280
Yeah, I would feel sad too, to be honest.

5200
02:52:20,380 --> 02:52:21,440
That would destroy my moral.

5201
02:52:21,500 --> 02:52:22,560
You get a license to feel sad right there.

5202
02:52:22,560 --> 02:52:25,000
A license to feel sad, I like that.

5203
02:52:25,100 --> 02:52:26,300
Someone said he ran ads.

5204
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:29,000
He ran ads?

5205
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,900
At least monetize the toxic performance.

5206
02:52:30,900 --> 02:52:31,620
That's smart.

5207
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:32,880
I should have ran ads too.

5208
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:34,100
Yeah, true, true, true.

5209
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:35,080
I would do that too.

5210
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:37,080
Oh my gosh, I forgot to do that.

5211
02:52:37,280 --> 02:52:38,540
I never run ads.

5212
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:40,720
I let YouTube do it for me.

5213
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:42,060
I got this, dudes.

5214
02:52:42,140 --> 02:52:43,520
Dragon Ball Z, let's fucking go.

5215
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:45,500
Yes, sir.

5216
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:48,920
Huddle down.

5217
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:53,160
Mm-hmm.

5218
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:55,860
Look at this.

5219
02:52:56,860 --> 02:52:57,580
Good parries.

5220
02:52:57,620 --> 02:52:57,840
Ow.

5221
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:05,360
Pocket sand.

5222
02:53:05,360 --> 02:53:06,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

5223
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:07,140
He DI's a lot in the corner.

5224
02:53:07,260 --> 02:53:07,720
I forgot about that.

5225
02:53:07,740 --> 02:53:09,940
Yeah, he always goes for random DI, but you're alive, you're good.

5226
02:53:11,620 --> 02:53:12,900
Oh, you messed up, amigo.

5227
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:13,760
Yes, sir.

5228
02:53:14,620 --> 02:53:14,980
Nice.

5229
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:17,340
Then let him do the pocket sand.

5230
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:20,380
Oh, not the pocket sand.

5231
02:53:21,660 --> 02:53:22,260
He's burnt?

5232
02:53:22,740 --> 02:53:23,240
Oh yeah.

5233
02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:24,180
Oh yeah.

5234
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:25,280
What is he doing?

5235
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:26,620
I'm not burnt out, amigo.

5236
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:27,320
You are, dude.

5237
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:28,780
Oh shit.

5238
02:53:28,780 --> 02:53:29,180
What?

5239
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:30,000
Oh.

5240
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:31,440
There we go.

5241
02:53:31,440 --> 02:53:32,340
I think he got confused.

5242
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:33,280
I like the confidence.

5243
02:53:33,440 --> 02:53:34,320
I messed them up.

5244
02:53:34,380 --> 02:53:36,700
I messed the life bars up too all the time and the stun bars.

5245
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:39,980
He forgot he was P2.

5246
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:40,720
Uh-oh.

5247
02:53:42,900 --> 02:53:44,580
Ah, the neutral jumps, yes.

5248
02:53:45,220 --> 02:53:46,160
Yes, that's what he does.

5249
02:53:46,340 --> 02:53:47,060
You know him.

5250
02:53:50,220 --> 02:53:50,780
Uh-huh.

5251
02:53:52,400 --> 02:53:52,800
Nice.

5252
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:54,200
That's my goat.

5253
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:56,380
Uh-huh.

5254
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:58,000
Uh-oh.

5255
02:53:58,000 --> 02:53:59,480
You're going to drive rush at me, dude.

5256
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:01,100
Bruh.

5257
02:54:01,900 --> 02:54:03,240
Oh, you got hit by that?

5258
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:11,640
The defense, that's good.

5259
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:17,060
Oh, nice.

5260
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:19,220
Oh, level three.

5261
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:20,340
Yes.

5262
02:54:20,380 --> 02:54:21,160
I burned him out.

5263
02:54:21,380 --> 02:54:21,920
Smart play.

5264
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:22,860
Let's go.

5265
02:54:22,980 --> 02:54:23,600
Very smart.

5266
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:24,520
Hold on.

5267
02:54:24,580 --> 02:54:26,280
I still got to worry about his level three, though.

5268
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:26,940
Yeah.

5269
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:27,660
Yeah.

5270
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:27,880
Yeah.

5271
02:54:27,900 --> 02:54:27,980
Yeah.

5272
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:28,080
Yeah.

5273
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:29,160
Modern three and you're good.

5274
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:32,140
Nice fireball.

5275
02:54:34,840 --> 02:54:35,800
Oh, nice grab.

5276
02:54:36,260 --> 02:54:36,360
Oh.

5277
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:37,480
He might be desperate.

5278
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:39,800
All right.

5279
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:40,220
We're good.

5280
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:40,420
I'm desperate too.

5281
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:40,720
Yeah.

5282
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:40,980
Okay.

5283
02:54:41,060 --> 02:54:41,640
We take those.

5284
02:54:41,720 --> 02:54:42,300
We take those.

5285
02:54:42,480 --> 02:54:44,420
Dude, I love whipping grab in front.

5286
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:45,860
That's a classic.

5287
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:46,300
That's a classic.

5288
02:54:46,460 --> 02:54:47,180
That's a classic frame trap right there.

5289
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:47,440
Yeah.

5290
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:49,960
Keep doing it.

5291
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:50,260
Let's go.

5292
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:50,780
Let's go.

5293
02:54:50,780 --> 02:54:52,180
I got Barry the Light in my ear.

5294
02:54:52,300 --> 02:54:53,020
I don't think I can lose.

5295
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:55,820
Oh, DMC time.

5296
02:54:56,820 --> 02:54:57,480
Yeah, dude.

5297
02:54:57,700 --> 02:54:57,960
Yeah.

5298
02:55:01,010 --> 02:55:01,770
Ouch.

5299
02:55:02,670 --> 02:55:03,430
Oh.

5300
02:55:04,030 --> 02:55:04,790
He's...

5301
02:55:04,790 --> 02:55:06,130
Stop with the pocket sand.

5302
02:55:06,750 --> 02:55:07,510
Uh-oh.

5303
02:55:09,130 --> 02:55:10,170
Nice break.

5304
02:55:10,330 --> 02:55:10,790
Oh.

5305
02:55:10,790 --> 02:55:11,330
Oh.

5306
02:55:14,890 --> 02:55:16,410
Nice jabs.

5307
02:55:16,410 --> 02:55:16,830
Yes.

5308
02:55:16,870 --> 02:55:17,490
The pressure.

5309
02:55:19,970 --> 02:55:20,730
Oh.

5310
02:55:22,030 --> 02:55:22,790
Hmm.

5311
02:55:23,530 --> 02:55:24,110
Uh-oh.

5312
02:55:30,060 --> 02:55:30,820
Oh.

5313
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:31,240
He's just...

5314
02:55:31,240 --> 02:55:32,060
Dragon punch.

5315
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:32,420
Oh.

5316
02:55:32,440 --> 02:55:32,960
What?

5317
02:55:33,280 --> 02:55:34,040
Oh.

5318
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:34,440
Oh.

5319
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:35,880
That was actually a good move from him.

5320
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:42,860
Modern.

5321
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:45,460
Oh.

5322
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:45,960
He's burnt.

5323
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:47,380
Just be careful about his level one.

5324
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:49,940
Oh.

5325
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:50,700
I didn't realize.

5326
02:55:51,560 --> 02:55:52,020
Oh.

5327
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:52,600
You're burnt too.

5328
02:55:53,220 --> 02:55:53,940
I am.

5329
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:54,480
I am burnt.

5330
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:55,880
Unfortunately.

5331
02:55:58,220 --> 02:55:58,680
Nice.

5332
02:55:58,700 --> 02:55:59,520
Get those plus frames.

5333
02:55:59,780 --> 02:56:00,080
Nice.

5334
02:56:00,380 --> 02:56:00,920
Uh-oh.

5335
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:03,220
Oh.

5336
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:04,900
What do you mean, uh-oh?

5337
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:05,580
Oh.

5338
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:06,300
Oh.

5339
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:06,620
Oh.

5340
02:56:06,620 --> 02:56:06,940
Oh.

5341
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:07,600
I should...

5342
02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:07,800
That's fine.

5343
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:08,280
Oh.

5344
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:08,920
Now it's uh-oh.

5345
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:09,680
That's fine.

5346
02:56:09,700 --> 02:56:10,020
That's fine.

5347
02:56:10,380 --> 02:56:11,500
That was a good try.

5348
02:56:15,060 --> 02:56:16,020
Oh, wow.

5349
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:19,080
Nice.

5350
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:27,120
Good jump out.

5351
02:56:27,240 --> 02:56:27,420
Yeah.

5352
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:27,820
Paid attacks.

5353
02:56:29,820 --> 02:56:30,300
Hmm.

5354
02:56:31,640 --> 02:56:32,440
He's adapting.

5355
02:56:33,580 --> 02:56:34,240
All right.

5356
02:56:34,340 --> 02:56:35,100
Good stuff.

5357
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:35,580
That was good.

5358
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:35,840
Box mod.

5359
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:37,100
He's playing very fearless.

5360
02:56:37,280 --> 02:56:37,880
He just...

5361
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:38,740
He's very...

5362
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:38,960
Yeah.

5363
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:38,980
Yeah.

5364
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:39,380
He's very...

5365
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:40,440
Very safe.

5366
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:41,140
Yeah.

5367
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,460
In the corner, you got to look for DI.

5368
02:56:42,560 --> 02:56:43,080
That's about it.

5369
02:56:43,140 --> 02:56:46,860
Mid-screen, you know, you can try back dashing or something, get away from the throws, but...

5370
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:47,940
Or just block it out.

5371
02:56:48,040 --> 02:56:48,900
But you're playing really good.

5372
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:50,780
I'm going to try something here.

5373
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:55,340
Is it that?

5374
02:56:58,900 --> 02:56:59,220
Yeah.

5375
02:56:59,380 --> 02:57:00,200
Just string him up.

5376
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:01,060
Stop going for the throw.

5377
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:02,040
Do the heavy kick on him.

5378
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:03,120
This man is mashing.

5379
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:04,180
So like...

5380
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:05,640
Get in there.

5381
02:57:05,740 --> 02:57:06,900
When you get in there, press that heavy kick.

5382
02:57:07,380 --> 02:57:07,900
Yes, sir.

5383
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:08,200
Nice.

5384
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:08,440
Nice.

5385
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:08,500
Sir.

5386
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:10,020
Burned out.

5387
02:57:10,300 --> 02:57:11,220
He has level one, though.

5388
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:13,240
It's fine.

5389
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:15,980
Maybe I'll save it.

5390
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:17,700
Nice combo.

5391
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:29,080
Oh, nice.

5392
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:30,340
Very clean.

5393
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:31,100
Very clean.

5394
02:57:31,380 --> 02:57:32,500
That was a sick-ass jump.

5395
02:57:33,460 --> 02:57:34,180
One more miss.

5396
02:57:37,460 --> 02:57:38,500
Oh, nice tech.

5397
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:39,220
Nice tech.

5398
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:40,820
He's burned out again.

5399
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:41,440
Level two?

5400
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:42,320
Oh, he dropped two.

5401
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:42,600
No, he...

5402
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:43,100
Yeah, he wore it.

5403
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:44,260
Oh, nice tech.

5404
02:57:47,350 --> 02:57:47,690
Two shots.

5405
02:57:47,790 --> 02:57:48,770
Oh, that was it.

5406
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:50,490
He was unlucky.

5407
02:57:52,410 --> 02:57:53,390
I'm just going to chip him out.

5408
02:57:54,950 --> 02:57:55,290
Yeah.

5409
02:57:56,350 --> 02:57:57,030
Thank you.

5410
02:57:57,050 --> 02:57:57,590
Thank you.

5411
02:57:57,590 --> 02:57:58,090
Oh, my God.

5412
02:57:58,110 --> 02:57:59,110
Yeah, you're welcome, coach.

5413
02:57:59,190 --> 02:57:59,810
That was for you.

5414
02:57:59,870 --> 02:58:00,690
Thank you.

5415
02:58:00,790 --> 02:58:01,530
Oh, my God.

5416
02:58:01,530 --> 02:58:04,030
That was nerve-wracking there.

5417
02:58:05,890 --> 02:58:09,250
He's like, do I do something fancy, or do I do the easy thing?

5418
02:58:17,430 --> 02:58:18,130
He's proud.

5419
02:58:18,350 --> 02:58:20,090
If you dry brush Crouching Mode, a heavy kick on him.

5420
02:58:21,130 --> 02:58:21,970
I will do that.

5421
02:58:22,210 --> 02:58:22,650
Oh,

5422
02:58:28,470 --> 02:58:32,870
nice combo!

5423
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:34,810
Yes!

5424
02:58:34,830 --> 02:58:35,250
Yes, sir!

5425
02:58:35,390 --> 02:58:35,910
Yes, sir!

5426
02:58:35,950 --> 02:58:36,130
Oh, again!

5427
02:58:36,250 --> 02:58:36,790
And again!

5428
02:58:37,490 --> 02:58:38,350
Just flow!

5429
02:58:38,490 --> 02:58:39,090
Let's go!

5430
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:41,030
Oh, in the ground!

5431
02:58:41,890 --> 02:58:42,530
One more.

5432
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:43,610
Oh my god!

5433
02:58:44,030 --> 02:58:45,290
PSCA, that's about it.

5434
02:58:47,110 --> 02:58:48,310
Nice fireball.

5435
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:56,740
Good idea.

5436
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:58,800
Yes, very good recovery.

5437
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,900
No, not the sand.

5438
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:01,580
Pocket sand.

5439
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:11,450
Just take it!

5440
02:59:11,450 --> 02:59:12,110
That's mine!

5441
02:59:12,270 --> 02:59:14,670
Just eat the sandbubble, baby!

5442
02:59:14,990 --> 02:59:15,690
Clean play.

5443
02:59:15,890 --> 02:59:16,610
Clean play.

5444
02:59:16,670 --> 02:59:17,230
Let's go.

5445
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:21,110
All right, I guess there's still a chance we can go to TwitchCon.

5446
02:59:21,310 --> 02:59:22,210
Yeah, yeah.

5447
02:59:22,410 --> 02:59:23,130
No pressure.

5448
02:59:23,310 --> 02:59:23,810
No pressure.

5449
02:59:24,170 --> 02:59:24,710
No pressure!

5450
02:59:25,210 --> 02:59:26,390
Coach, no pressure!

5451
02:59:26,710 --> 02:59:26,850
It's time.

5452
02:59:26,970 --> 02:59:27,670
It's time.

5453
02:59:27,730 --> 02:59:28,210
Hell yes.

5454
02:59:28,430 --> 02:59:29,310
It's time, brother.

5455
02:59:30,030 --> 02:59:31,770
We leave it all to you, coach.

5456
02:59:32,450 --> 02:59:34,670
Brian, I have to do a coach match too, man.

5457
02:59:34,750 --> 02:59:36,350
I know how you feel.

5458
02:59:37,650 --> 02:59:38,910
I'm fucking ready, dude.

5459
02:59:39,010 --> 02:59:39,770
Coach match time.

5460
02:59:40,070 --> 02:59:40,490
Oh, wait.

5461
02:59:40,670 --> 02:59:41,450
I remembered.

5462
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:43,670
I promised I remembered to leave.

5463
02:59:43,850 --> 02:59:44,970
Wait, let me not do Honda, though.

5464
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:45,790
I'm not that ready.

5465
02:59:47,890 --> 02:59:49,750
Imagine you started off as Honda.

5466
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:51,230
Yeah.

5467
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:53,470
They're just like, sorry, no resets.

5468
02:59:53,610 --> 02:59:55,890
Dude, I almost had the trade combo.

5469
02:59:55,970 --> 02:59:56,910
He was too far away.

5470
02:59:58,950 --> 02:59:59,430
Damn!

5471
02:59:59,830 --> 03:00:01,850
It's all that matters is that you won, coach.

5472
03:00:02,010 --> 03:00:03,070
That's all that matters.

5473
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:04,150
That's true.

5474
03:00:04,370 --> 03:00:04,650
That's true.

5475
03:00:04,650 --> 03:00:06,670
There's nothing about being fancy here.

5476
03:00:06,910 --> 03:00:08,570
It's all about winning.

5477
03:00:09,130 --> 03:00:09,650
Good job, man.

5478
03:00:09,750 --> 03:00:10,630
I'm so proud of you.

5479
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:12,050
Thanks, dude.

5480
03:00:12,170 --> 03:00:12,750
I'm proud of you.

5481
03:00:13,930 --> 03:00:15,210
Thank you guys for...

5482
03:00:15,210 --> 03:00:17,250
Thank you, guys, for carrying.

5483
03:00:17,650 --> 03:00:19,710
We will carry our teammates.

5484
03:00:20,390 --> 03:00:22,330
We're doing this for SK and for Doki.

5485
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:27,010
I should have trained yesterday, but instead I played Roblox.

5486
03:00:27,090 --> 03:00:27,690
That's my bad.

5487
03:00:28,110 --> 03:00:32,210
Nah, that's for your sanity and your mental health.

5488
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:33,690
Let's keep it down for coach, though.

5489
03:00:33,890 --> 03:00:35,570
Coach, you got this.

5490
03:00:35,730 --> 03:00:36,050
Full focus.

5491
03:00:36,770 --> 03:00:37,430
Good luck.

5492
03:00:38,030 --> 03:00:38,870
Good luck, coach.

5493
03:00:49,960 --> 03:00:50,960
Oh, nice pull.

5494
03:00:51,140 --> 03:00:51,540
Mix up.

5495
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:56,940
Oh, that's sick.

5496
03:00:56,940 --> 03:00:57,040
Nice mash.

5497
03:00:59,100 --> 03:00:59,500
Yes.

5498
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:00,600
Catch the delay tech.

5499
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:00,980
Coco.

5500
03:01:02,280 --> 03:01:02,820
That's nice.

5501
03:01:03,280 --> 03:01:04,300
Nice anti-air.

5502
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,440
Let's go.

5503
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:06,260
Burned out.

5504
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:06,740
Let's go.

5505
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:07,260
Get in there.

5506
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:08,920
Checkmate situation.

5507
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:09,680
Checkmate.

5508
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:10,440
Checkmate, baby.

5509
03:01:10,700 --> 03:01:11,180
Fucking go.

5510
03:01:11,380 --> 03:01:12,760
Let's fucking go, coach.

5511
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:14,580
Let's go, baby.

5512
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:15,960
My coach.

5513
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:17,600
That's my coach right there.

5514
03:01:19,260 --> 03:01:20,100
Nice anti-air.

5515
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:20,420
That was good.

5516
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:20,740
That was good.

5517
03:01:25,070 --> 03:01:25,470
Woo.

5518
03:01:26,030 --> 03:01:26,790
Almost had it.

5519
03:01:27,130 --> 03:01:27,910
Almost, almost.

5520
03:01:28,070 --> 03:01:28,230
Okay.

5521
03:01:28,650 --> 03:01:29,710
Oh, the mash up.

5522
03:01:31,390 --> 03:01:32,190
Ball time.

5523
03:01:33,070 --> 03:01:33,590
Fuck it.

5524
03:01:33,590 --> 03:01:34,310
We ball, dude.

5525
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:34,890
Let's go.

5526
03:01:35,950 --> 03:01:36,750
Stand still.

5527
03:01:37,630 --> 03:01:38,130
Let's go.

5528
03:01:39,070 --> 03:01:39,690
He hit someone.

5529
03:01:39,690 --> 03:01:40,030
Safe jump.

5530
03:01:42,150 --> 03:01:42,770
It's all right.

5531
03:01:42,830 --> 03:01:43,270
All right.

5532
03:01:43,290 --> 03:01:43,410
Yeah.

5533
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:43,930
Give him the corner.

5534
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:45,830
Oh, no way.

5535
03:01:47,570 --> 03:01:48,790
What the fuck?

5536
03:01:49,610 --> 03:01:50,370
That's insane.

5537
03:01:50,990 --> 03:01:51,570
Hold on.

5538
03:01:51,630 --> 03:01:51,870
Hold on.

5539
03:01:51,970 --> 03:01:52,370
Yeah.

5540
03:01:52,390 --> 03:01:52,590
Yeah.

5541
03:01:52,750 --> 03:01:53,670
He had the meter.

5542
03:01:54,590 --> 03:01:55,310
Hold on.

5543
03:01:55,330 --> 03:01:56,290
He had zero bars, though.

5544
03:01:56,310 --> 03:01:56,910
If he gets them.

5545
03:01:57,390 --> 03:01:57,750
Yes.

5546
03:01:57,910 --> 03:01:58,430
Get him.

5547
03:01:58,530 --> 03:01:58,790
Checkmate.

5548
03:01:58,790 --> 03:01:59,750
Back in the corner.

5549
03:01:59,790 --> 03:02:00,070
Go.

5550
03:02:01,170 --> 03:02:01,530
Checkmate.

5551
03:02:01,930 --> 03:02:02,470
Checkmate, baby.

5552
03:02:03,330 --> 03:02:04,290
Oh, the BM.

5553
03:02:04,510 --> 03:02:05,050
Oh, my God.

5554
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:05,810
Let's fucking go.

5555
03:02:05,930 --> 03:02:06,970
I'm here to fucking play.

5556
03:02:07,130 --> 03:02:07,850
My turn, baby.

5557
03:02:08,030 --> 03:02:08,450
Let's fucking go.

5558
03:02:09,310 --> 03:02:10,170
Kick my hand.

5559
03:02:10,230 --> 03:02:10,590
Finally.

5560
03:02:10,810 --> 03:02:11,530
Kick my hand.

5561
03:02:11,650 --> 03:02:13,730
Guys, I stand back so we could have a coach match.

5562
03:02:17,710 --> 03:02:18,070
Sure.

5563
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:18,610
Lock it in.

5564
03:02:19,230 --> 03:02:20,030
Lock it in.

5565
03:02:21,730 --> 03:02:22,490
Lock it in.

5566
03:02:22,650 --> 03:02:22,770
Lock it in.

5567
03:02:23,290 --> 03:02:23,650
Lock it in.

5568
03:02:26,170 --> 03:02:27,230
Oh, time to go in.

5569
03:02:30,330 --> 03:02:30,770
Ooh.

5570
03:02:33,670 --> 03:02:34,110
Nice.

5571
03:02:38,910 --> 03:02:39,970
Nice anti-air.

5572
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:40,110
Yeah.

5573
03:02:40,690 --> 03:02:41,870
Ooh, bait that.

5574
03:02:42,230 --> 03:02:42,670
Oh.

5575
03:02:42,810 --> 03:02:43,430
Minus six.

5576
03:02:43,710 --> 03:02:44,150
Oos.

5577
03:02:44,210 --> 03:02:44,230
Oos.

5578
03:02:44,270 --> 03:02:44,790
Oh, drop.

5579
03:02:44,910 --> 03:02:45,170
It's okay.

5580
03:02:45,270 --> 03:02:45,790
No worries.

5581
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:46,830
It's okay.

5582
03:02:46,910 --> 03:02:47,490
American reset.

5583
03:02:48,150 --> 03:02:49,130
Oh, don't be.

5584
03:02:49,230 --> 03:02:49,650
Oh.

5585
03:02:50,130 --> 03:02:50,990
Watch out.

5586
03:02:52,470 --> 03:02:53,330
He's dead.

5587
03:02:53,450 --> 03:02:53,630
He's dead.

5588
03:02:53,630 --> 03:02:54,070
Please.

5589
03:02:57,530 --> 03:02:58,890
Oh, he's doing the coaching.

5590
03:03:00,290 --> 03:03:00,690
Yeah.

5591
03:03:00,690 --> 03:03:01,310
This is...

5592
03:03:01,310 --> 03:03:02,030
This is the...

5593
03:03:02,030 --> 03:03:02,430
This is yours, right?

5594
03:03:02,810 --> 03:03:03,210
Yes.

5595
03:03:03,310 --> 03:03:04,230
Oh, but he's out of the corner.

5596
03:03:04,350 --> 03:03:04,630
Good.

5597
03:03:04,730 --> 03:03:04,830
Yeah.

5598
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:05,750
Worth.

5599
03:03:06,590 --> 03:03:06,990
Worth.

5600
03:03:07,050 --> 03:03:07,450
Worth.

5601
03:03:07,450 --> 03:03:07,650
Worth.

5602
03:03:08,090 --> 03:03:08,750
Here we go.

5603
03:03:09,130 --> 03:03:09,730
All right.

5604
03:03:10,170 --> 03:03:10,790
No worries.

5605
03:03:10,830 --> 03:03:11,110
No worries.

5606
03:03:11,530 --> 03:03:11,930
Composure.

5607
03:03:13,390 --> 03:03:13,790
Nice.

5608
03:03:14,050 --> 03:03:14,450
Nice.

5609
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:18,710
Come here.

5610
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:20,350
Oh, yeah.

5611
03:03:20,490 --> 03:03:20,850
Oh, my God.

5612
03:03:21,230 --> 03:03:22,270
Get in there.

5613
03:03:22,390 --> 03:03:22,650
No.

5614
03:03:23,630 --> 03:03:23,910
You're bomb.

5615
03:03:24,550 --> 03:03:26,370
And then one more interaction after this.

5616
03:03:26,690 --> 03:03:27,250
Kind of.

5617
03:03:27,290 --> 03:03:27,670
Not really.

5618
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:28,350
Yeah.

5619
03:03:28,430 --> 03:03:29,510
Did you hear me?

5620
03:03:29,630 --> 03:03:30,490
Get him, coach.

5621
03:03:31,230 --> 03:03:32,030
The trademark.

5622
03:03:32,550 --> 03:03:33,050
Oh, wait.

5623
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:33,190
Wait.

5624
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:33,630
Wait for it.

5625
03:03:36,590 --> 03:03:38,270
I'm freaking losing my mind, dude.

5626
03:03:39,290 --> 03:03:39,690
What the fuck is that?

5627
03:03:39,690 --> 03:03:40,490
I'm losing my mind.

5628
03:03:40,530 --> 03:03:41,370
I'm losing my mind.

5629
03:03:42,290 --> 03:03:43,870
I can't believe what I'm watching.

5630
03:03:44,670 --> 03:03:45,890
That was actually so dope.

5631
03:03:46,310 --> 03:03:46,710
Yeah.

5632
03:03:46,830 --> 03:03:47,230
Blitz.

5633
03:03:48,890 --> 03:03:49,410
Oh, no.

5634
03:03:49,430 --> 03:03:50,170
She's trying to adapt.

5635
03:03:50,310 --> 03:03:51,310
Don't let him do that.

5636
03:03:52,150 --> 03:03:53,050
Oh, no.

5637
03:03:53,170 --> 03:03:53,570
She's trying to adapt.

5638
03:03:53,570 --> 03:03:53,590
Don't let him do that.

5639
03:03:53,590 --> 03:03:54,030
Don't let him do that.

5640
03:03:54,030 --> 03:03:54,190
All right.

5641
03:03:54,210 --> 03:03:55,910
He did this so he can build some drive meter.

5642
03:03:56,470 --> 03:03:57,030
All right.

5643
03:03:57,330 --> 03:03:59,390
Let him fuck.

5644
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:00,170
Yeah.

5645
03:04:00,270 --> 03:04:00,850
Let him cook.

5646
03:04:00,890 --> 03:04:01,250
Let him cook.

5647
03:04:01,270 --> 03:04:01,550
Let him cook.

5648
03:04:03,470 --> 03:04:04,450
Oh, good shimmy.

5649
03:04:04,610 --> 03:04:05,350
That was good.

5650
03:04:05,430 --> 03:04:06,050
I'll give it to him.

5651
03:04:06,230 --> 03:04:06,550
Yeah.

5652
03:04:06,550 --> 03:04:06,750
Yeah.

5653
03:04:06,750 --> 03:04:07,290
That was a good shimmy.

5654
03:04:07,530 --> 03:04:07,850
Yeah.

5655
03:04:09,730 --> 03:04:10,370
Well played.

5656
03:04:10,490 --> 03:04:10,550
Oh.

5657
03:04:11,530 --> 03:04:12,710
Oh, he didn't go for the kill?

5658
03:04:12,990 --> 03:04:13,930
Oh, he's burnt out.

5659
03:04:13,990 --> 03:04:14,330
That's why.

5660
03:04:14,730 --> 03:04:15,730
Oh, that was close.

5661
03:04:16,310 --> 03:04:17,350
You could have got that.

5662
03:04:18,150 --> 03:04:18,470
Yeah.

5663
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:24,040
Nice.

5664
03:04:24,460 --> 03:04:25,000
Oh, nice.

5665
03:04:25,240 --> 03:04:25,320
Just parries.

5666
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:26,280
Oh, nice.

5667
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:27,060
Come here.

5668
03:04:35,220 --> 03:04:35,800
Okay.

5669
03:04:36,740 --> 03:04:37,380
Heads up.

5670
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:37,520
Oh.

5671
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:39,020
He got hit.

5672
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:39,700
Stand still.

5673
03:04:48,290 --> 03:04:49,210
Oh, that's okay.

5674
03:04:49,450 --> 03:04:50,030
Okay.

5675
03:04:51,310 --> 03:04:53,190
He's bent out.

5676
03:04:56,390 --> 03:04:57,650
Oh, the shimmy.

5677
03:04:57,790 --> 03:04:58,370
Nice.

5678
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:10,080
Come on.

5679
03:05:10,380 --> 03:05:11,160
Come on.

5680
03:05:11,640 --> 03:05:12,200
Come on.

5681
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:12,680
Come on.

5682
03:05:13,320 --> 03:05:14,080
Come on.

5683
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:16,240
He got hit.

5684
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:17,120
Stand still.

5685
03:05:17,140 --> 03:05:17,160
Oh, that's okay.

5686
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:17,900
Yeah, that's death.

5687
03:05:19,020 --> 03:05:20,220
Nice conversion.

5688
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:21,920
We got this.

5689
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:25,080
Let's go coach.

5690
03:05:25,260 --> 03:05:26,220
Full focus.

5691
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:27,280
Avenge us.

5692
03:05:28,060 --> 03:05:28,940
We believe.

5693
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,060
Good job chat.

5694
03:05:31,220 --> 03:05:32,240
Send all the energy.

5695
03:05:41,210 --> 03:05:41,810
Nice.

5696
03:05:41,910 --> 03:05:42,910
What the fuck?

5697
03:05:42,970 --> 03:05:43,490
That was insane.

5698
03:05:44,450 --> 03:05:45,350
Anti everything.

5699
03:05:45,350 --> 03:05:46,450
And another anti.

5700
03:05:46,450 --> 03:05:46,810
Anti.

5701
03:05:58,120 --> 03:05:58,600
Everybody...

5702
03:05:58,600 --> 03:06:00,760
is just so far away from each other.

5703
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:08,240
Nice.

5704
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:09,620
Nice grab.

5705
03:06:12,500 --> 03:06:13,240
Nice grab.

5706
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:13,920
Nice grab again.

5707
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:15,460
Nice grab.

5708
03:06:15,660 --> 03:06:16,100
Oh yeah.

5709
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:19,500
The meaties.

5710
03:06:20,480 --> 03:06:21,860
I don't think this is going to kill though.

5711
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:23,800
Unless.

5712
03:06:25,020 --> 03:06:25,800
Unless he.

5713
03:06:25,860 --> 03:06:27,160
Oh my gosh.

5714
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:35,960
Just block it out.

5715
03:06:36,880 --> 03:06:37,840
Nothing to worry about.

5716
03:06:40,020 --> 03:06:40,460
Nice.

5717
03:06:40,460 --> 03:06:41,220
Blocked it out.

5718
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:41,480
Good.

5719
03:06:43,320 --> 03:06:43,760
Nice.

5720
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:46,880
That was so good.

5721
03:06:47,580 --> 03:06:48,020
Collected.

5722
03:06:48,020 --> 03:06:49,220
Oh my god the defense.

5723
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:50,700
Just keep it cool man.

5724
03:06:50,720 --> 03:06:51,920
This is what it looks like when you block.

5725
03:06:53,960 --> 03:06:54,400
Yes.

5726
03:06:55,620 --> 03:06:56,660
Oh empty jump.

5727
03:06:56,960 --> 03:06:58,300
Fucking rebound.

5728
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:02,460
Who is Brian?

5729
03:07:02,840 --> 03:07:04,440
Brian is for the blind.

5730
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:06,080
He is the vision for the hungry.

5731
03:07:06,300 --> 03:07:08,160
He is the chef for the thirsty.

5732
03:07:08,600 --> 03:07:09,880
He is the one.

5733
03:07:10,780 --> 03:07:12,740
If Brian thinks I agree.

5734
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:14,200
Oh.

5735
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:15,080
Oh nice.

5736
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:26,800
Yes sir.

5737
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:28,280
Get in there.

5738
03:07:30,260 --> 03:07:31,460
Keep it cool.

5739
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:35,940
Keep it cool.

5740
03:07:35,940 --> 03:07:36,980
Keep it cool.

5741
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:50,060
Oh.

5742
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:51,440
That is so close.

5743
03:07:52,400 --> 03:07:53,060
Let's go.

5744
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:53,600
Let's do this.

5745
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:54,800
Last game.

5746
03:07:54,840 --> 03:07:55,360
Last round.

5747
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:58,720
It is intense right now dude.

5748
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:00,620
Get him.

5749
03:08:00,660 --> 03:08:01,100
You are mine.

5750
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:02,300
Mmm.

5751
03:08:03,610 --> 03:08:03,920
Mmm.

5752
03:08:06,140 --> 03:08:06,760
Yes.

5753
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:07,760
Stand still.

5754
03:08:08,060 --> 03:08:08,360
Let's go.

5755
03:08:13,730 --> 03:08:14,370
Let's go.

5756
03:08:14,370 --> 03:08:15,570
God that is so cool dude.

5757
03:08:15,750 --> 03:08:17,070
Oh yeah baby.

5758
03:08:17,190 --> 03:08:17,970
Fucking we both.

5759
03:08:18,330 --> 03:08:20,050
You are mine.

5760
03:08:25,840 --> 03:08:27,060
Let's fucking go.

5761
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:28,740
We are going to fucking flip.

5762
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:29,860
That's right baby.

5763
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:31,280
Let's fucking do this.

5764
03:08:33,160 --> 03:08:34,440
Let's go.

5765
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:36,480
Oh my god.

5766
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:37,140
Let's go.

5767
03:08:37,580 --> 03:08:38,680
Let's go baby.

5768
03:08:39,180 --> 03:08:40,560
I can't believe it.

5769
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:41,200
G.

5770
03:08:41,380 --> 03:08:42,640
Fucking G.

5771
03:08:42,880 --> 03:08:45,260
What a match to end on.

5772
03:08:45,620 --> 03:08:46,640
Oh my god.

5773
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:49,020
You are so good.

5774
03:08:49,460 --> 03:08:50,740
Oh my god.

5775
03:08:50,740 --> 03:08:51,620
That is crazy.

5776
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:52,360
Let's go baby.

5777
03:08:52,840 --> 03:08:54,540
Let the coach fucking flip.

5778
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:58,140
I couldn't close my eyes.

5779
03:08:58,140 --> 03:08:58,920
I was just listening.

5780
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:01,320
Good job coach.

5781
03:09:01,440 --> 03:09:02,280
That was awesome.

5782
03:09:02,300 --> 03:09:03,140
You did so good.

5783
03:09:03,440 --> 03:09:04,740
Oh my god.

5784
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:07,040
That was intense.

5785
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:10,160
We believed in the coach dude.

5786
03:09:10,560 --> 03:09:10,840
We believed.

5787
03:09:12,140 --> 03:09:13,180
I was here.

5788
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:15,000
That was too intense.

5789
03:09:15,240 --> 03:09:16,400
Oh my goodness.

5790
03:09:17,220 --> 03:09:18,740
That was so good.

5791
03:09:18,820 --> 03:09:19,860
Good job guys.

5792
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:20,880
I can't believe we ended on a coach match.

5793
03:09:21,360 --> 03:09:23,660
SK Doki we got this.

5794
03:09:23,660 --> 03:09:24,480
We did it.

5795
03:09:24,800 --> 03:09:27,440
Thank you for the carry guys.

5796
03:09:27,540 --> 03:09:27,900
Everybody.

5797
03:09:28,460 --> 03:09:30,520
We did.

5798
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:32,160
Let's go.

5799
03:09:32,360 --> 03:09:33,220
Oh my gosh.

5800
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:33,900
Yeah dude.

5801
03:09:40,560 --> 03:09:41,000
Let's finish for it.

5802
03:09:41,860 --> 03:09:42,400
Let's go.

5803
03:09:44,340 --> 03:09:45,480
Oh my god.

5804
03:09:46,420 --> 03:09:48,600
Now fight to see who the real diaphone is.

5805
03:09:48,920 --> 03:09:50,380
Now you know I'm getting a little tired.

5806
03:09:50,620 --> 03:09:51,160
You know.

5807
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:53,920
It's 7 o'clock you know.

5808
03:09:54,020 --> 03:09:54,400
I don't know.

5809
03:09:54,480 --> 03:09:55,060
It's past my bedtime.

5810
03:09:55,060 --> 03:09:56,640
You did a hard day's work coach.

5811
03:09:56,760 --> 03:09:57,220
Good shit.

5812
03:09:57,440 --> 03:09:58,340
Well played everybody.

5813
03:09:58,680 --> 03:09:59,880
Good job guys.

5814
03:10:00,240 --> 03:10:02,020
Good job for winning for us.

5815
03:10:03,160 --> 03:10:03,660
Let's go.

5816
03:10:04,780 --> 03:10:05,900
See you at TwitchCon.

5817
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:06,600
Maybe.

5818
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:08,400
I put everything on day 2.

5819
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:10,680
So we're for sure done for real right?

5820
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:11,560
We're done for the day.

5821
03:10:11,580 --> 03:10:12,040
Yeah we're done for real.

5822
03:10:12,200 --> 03:10:13,500
It's just the finals now.

5823
03:10:13,640 --> 03:10:15,040
Now it's just Winners Finals.

5824
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:17,720
We'll get to see who's in Grand Finals.

5825
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:19,900
Yeah GG's everybody.

5826
03:10:20,880 --> 03:10:21,320
GG's.

5827
03:10:21,340 --> 03:10:22,500
I don't think I'm gonna watch.

5828
03:10:22,540 --> 03:10:24,220
I'm not gonna watch Winners Finals.

5829
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:25,380
I'm just gonna chill now.

5830
03:10:25,500 --> 03:10:26,340
I'm fucking stressed.

5831
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:27,460
You're heading out Doki?

5832
03:10:27,560 --> 03:10:28,580
Yeah I'm heading out.

5833
03:10:30,580 --> 03:10:31,460
Bye bye.

5834
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:33,920
If you guys wanna watch Winners Finals go to Twitch.

5835
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:34,960
And watch SageM.

5836
03:10:35,220 --> 03:10:38,400
Or like anyone that's still out round.

5837
03:10:39,900 --> 03:10:41,960
And we're putting the bird to rest.

5838
03:10:42,060 --> 03:10:42,860
Are the rest of you guys chilling here?

5839
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:45,340
Yeah I'm gonna be chilling.

5840
03:10:45,540 --> 03:10:46,320
GG's guys.

5841
03:10:46,320 --> 03:10:48,520
I'm just gonna be chilling in this chat.

5842
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:51,980
I need to de-stress with GG's everybody.

5843
03:10:52,660 --> 03:10:53,660
Yeah GG Doki.

5844
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:54,880
Good stuff Doki.

5845
03:10:55,100 --> 03:10:57,760
Thanks for the insane gameplay.

5846
03:10:59,440 --> 03:11:00,320
Insane gameplay.

5847
03:11:00,880 --> 03:11:01,800
Bye bye guys.

5848
03:11:02,120 --> 03:11:02,500
Bye bye.

5849
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:05,020
Talk to you later.

5850
03:11:05,140 --> 03:11:05,520
See ya.

5851
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:07,560
Alright guys.

5852
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:09,420
As much as I wanna hang out.

5853
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:10,700
I'm fucking stressed.

5854
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:13,020
I need a vibe.

5855
03:11:13,420 --> 03:11:13,940
I need...

5856
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:16,640
Those games...

5857
03:11:17,380 --> 03:11:18,300
Fucked me up.

5858
03:11:19,620 --> 03:11:21,020
I need to like...

5859
03:11:21,020 --> 03:11:23,340
De-stress right now and just sleep.

5860
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:25,820
Cause like... I know I slept a lot.

5861
03:11:25,980 --> 03:11:26,740
But it's like...

5862
03:11:26,740 --> 03:11:29,400
These games actually fucked me up.

5863
03:11:31,300 --> 03:11:31,620
So...

5864
03:11:31,940 --> 03:11:33,520
I need to rest now.

5865
03:11:33,580 --> 03:11:34,680
And mentally reset myself.

5866
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:36,760
I definitely...

5867
03:11:37,400 --> 03:11:39,540
Should have trained more yesterday.

5868
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:40,900
Because like...

5869
03:11:40,900 --> 03:11:43,260
The only training I got was...

5870
03:11:43,260 --> 03:11:44,560
With Justin last night.

5871
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:46,600
And like...

5872
03:11:46,600 --> 03:11:49,520
I definitely did not adapt in time.

5873
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:50,880
Cause like...

5874
03:11:50,880 --> 03:11:52,400
I knew people were labbing me.

5875
03:11:52,660 --> 03:11:53,900
But I didn't...

5876
03:11:53,900 --> 03:11:55,780
Like when people labbed me I was like...

5877
03:11:55,780 --> 03:11:57,380
I don't know what to change.

5878
03:11:57,840 --> 03:11:59,540
Cause I'm like...

5879
03:11:59,540 --> 03:12:01,320
I don't... I don't know.

5880
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:03,020
Cause like...

5881
03:12:03,020 --> 03:12:06,140
I think my main strategy was like...

5882
03:12:06,140 --> 03:12:07,320
If they jump...

5883
03:12:07,320 --> 03:12:08,420
I just do that.

5884
03:12:08,780 --> 03:12:10,440
But then everybody like...

5885
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:12,340
Stopped jumping towards me.

5886
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:14,620
Everybody would jump away from me.

5887
03:12:14,700 --> 03:12:17,840
And then everyone did like anti-airs too.

5888
03:12:18,140 --> 03:12:19,140
So I was like...

5889
03:12:19,140 --> 03:12:19,880
Oh no...

5890
03:12:19,880 --> 03:12:23,340
I was just like...

5891
03:12:23,340 --> 03:12:24,380
What do I do?

5892
03:12:25,780 --> 03:12:26,780
That's all my moves.

5893
03:12:27,180 --> 03:12:27,760
Like...

5894
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:33,920
I was like...

5895
03:12:34,820 --> 03:12:36,220
That's all my moves.

5896
03:12:36,380 --> 03:12:37,240
Anti-air.

5897
03:12:37,440 --> 03:12:39,160
And then...

5898
03:12:39,580 --> 03:12:40,620
Like I...

5899
03:12:40,620 --> 03:12:42,320
But then they anti-aired me.

5900
03:12:46,940 --> 03:12:48,780
So I was just like...

5901
03:12:48,780 --> 03:12:49,740
What do I do?

5902
03:12:50,660 --> 03:12:51,340
But...

5903
03:13:03,460 --> 03:13:11,420
The way I used to hit.

5904
03:13:11,420 --> 03:13:14,100
I was like...

5905
03:13:15,660 --> 03:13:16,700
Okay...

5906
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:19,180
I will hit twice.

5907
03:13:19,760 --> 03:13:20,500
Okay...

5908
03:13:22,380 --> 03:13:23,420
Okay...

5909
03:13:23,420 --> 03:13:24,020
I'm so right.

5910
03:13:24,020 --> 03:13:24,940
I'm just gonna die...

5911
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:25,760
What do I do now?

5912
03:13:30,300 --> 03:13:37,920
Yeah, I'm just... all the matches were incredibly close, though.

5913
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:39,160
Incredibly close.

5914
03:13:39,700 --> 03:13:41,780
I don't know if I crumbled or anything.

5915
03:13:42,220 --> 03:13:44,280
I definitely overthought a lot.

5916
03:13:44,560 --> 03:13:48,100
But I definitely should have played more last night.

5917
03:13:48,240 --> 03:13:49,560
I should have played more last night.

5918
03:13:49,560 --> 03:13:54,300
Because I played for two hours today.

5919
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:57,860
Two to three hours today before the stream.

5920
03:13:58,160 --> 03:13:59,300
Before the tournament.

5921
03:13:59,440 --> 03:14:00,960
But that was definitely not enough.

5922
03:14:01,480 --> 03:14:05,160
Because I went for more so ARS PD.

5923
03:14:05,340 --> 03:14:08,420
Because everybody was doing jumping.

5924
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:10,080
So I didn't know.

5925
03:14:10,320 --> 03:14:11,600
Because usually you jump.

5926
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:12,640
That's normal.

5927
03:14:12,940 --> 03:14:17,160
When you fight people, it's normal that people jump.

5928
03:14:17,160 --> 03:14:20,220
But it threw me off when people stopped jumping.

5929
03:14:20,420 --> 03:14:22,360
I was like, the fuck?

5930
03:14:26,300 --> 03:14:30,560
I was like, why did you stop jumping?

5931
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:34,400
It threw me off.

5932
03:14:40,140 --> 03:14:44,580
Yeah, and the whole... they were doing moves I've never seen before.

5933
03:14:44,840 --> 03:14:46,220
Because I wasn't used to it.

5934
03:14:46,360 --> 03:14:47,140
But I'm going to try.

5935
03:14:47,160 --> 03:14:50,420
I'm glad my team carried me for today.

5936
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:56,160
Like, I got my teams back last night.

5937
03:14:56,460 --> 03:14:57,160
Not last night.

5938
03:14:57,240 --> 03:14:58,180
Sorry, two days ago.

5939
03:14:58,420 --> 03:15:01,380
And then my team carried me through today.

5940
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:02,140
Which is great.

5941
03:15:02,240 --> 03:15:03,500
I really appreciate it.

5942
03:15:03,720 --> 03:15:04,200
Yeah.

5943
03:15:07,800 --> 03:15:08,280
Yeah.

5944
03:15:09,340 --> 03:15:09,820
They...

5945
03:15:11,780 --> 03:15:12,680
Yeah, everybody.

5946
03:15:12,800 --> 03:15:14,040
I think for me...

5947
03:15:14,040 --> 03:15:15,160
I don't know about... I don't know.

5948
03:15:15,300 --> 03:15:16,040
It depends on like...

5949
03:15:16,040 --> 03:15:17,940
Because some of us are going to keep playing FGC.

5950
03:15:17,960 --> 03:15:19,580
Like, fighting games in the future.

5951
03:15:19,900 --> 03:15:22,620
I usually join whenever I get invited to tournaments.

5952
03:15:22,780 --> 03:15:25,060
Because I don't want to... I don't want to be up a tier.

5953
03:15:25,380 --> 03:15:28,660
I don't want to be up a tier.

5954
03:15:28,860 --> 03:15:30,520
I just want to play in beginner tier.

5955
03:15:31,400 --> 03:15:33,500
I just want to play in beginner tier.

5956
03:15:34,300 --> 03:15:36,740
And I also like...

5957
03:15:38,740 --> 03:15:41,120
Fighting games stress me out so much.

5958
03:15:41,400 --> 03:15:42,800
Like, it might not seem like it.

5959
03:15:42,920 --> 03:15:43,240
Like...

5960
03:15:43,240 --> 03:15:44,120
But like...

5961
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:47,680
The back-to-back-to-back Street Fighter shit...

5962
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:48,920
Fucked me up.

5963
03:15:53,840 --> 03:15:55,860
It was so stressful.

5964
03:15:56,180 --> 03:15:56,800
Like, because I...

5965
03:15:56,800 --> 03:15:58,580
That's why yesterday I didn't train.

5966
03:15:59,880 --> 03:16:02,320
I didn't train because like...

5967
03:16:02,320 --> 03:16:03,060
I was like...

5968
03:16:03,060 --> 03:16:04,480
I was just way too stressed out.

5969
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:06,380
I was like...

5970
03:16:06,380 --> 03:16:07,960
I was just like...

5971
03:16:07,960 --> 03:16:09,720
I was just so out of it at that point.

5972
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:10,640
Because I felt like...

5973
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:12,520
I played...

5974
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:13,540
Because it was like...

5975
03:16:13,540 --> 03:16:14,100
You gotta learn.

5976
03:16:14,380 --> 03:16:15,400
Especially as a beginner.

5977
03:16:15,660 --> 03:16:17,680
You have to learn so fast.

5978
03:16:18,040 --> 03:16:19,900
At such a short amount of time.

5979
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:21,440
And...

5980
03:16:21,440 --> 03:16:22,660
It's similar to Tekken.

5981
03:16:22,740 --> 03:16:23,520
Tekken like...

5982
03:16:25,660 --> 03:16:26,220
Tekken...

5983
03:16:26,220 --> 03:16:28,160
The vibes was more like...

5984
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:29,500
Less serious.

5985
03:16:30,380 --> 03:16:33,300
The Street Fighter vibes was so serious.

5986
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:34,520
And like...

5987
03:16:34,520 --> 03:16:37,400
I also have a million things going on behind the scenes too.

5988
03:16:37,660 --> 03:16:38,760
So like...

5989
03:16:39,420 --> 03:16:40,300
Street Fighter...

5990
03:16:40,300 --> 03:16:40,840
Just like...

5991
03:16:40,840 --> 03:16:41,400
I think like...

5992
03:16:41,400 --> 03:16:42,300
During the finals...

5993
03:16:42,300 --> 03:16:43,860
It just piled on to me.

5994
03:16:44,080 --> 03:16:45,100
And then I got like...

5995
03:16:45,100 --> 03:16:46,920
Super stressed out and nervous too.

5996
03:16:47,800 --> 03:16:48,360
And...

5997
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:49,960
I just need like...

5998
03:16:49,960 --> 03:16:50,760
I just think like...

5999
03:16:50,760 --> 03:16:51,920
The more I vibe...

6000
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:53,000
The better I do.

6001
03:16:53,220 --> 03:16:53,700
Because...

6002
03:16:53,700 --> 03:16:54,560
Day 2...

6003
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:55,360
I vibed.

6004
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:01,000
Day 2...

6005
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:02,120
I vibed.

6006
03:17:02,220 --> 03:17:02,780
Today...

6007
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:04,620
I was half vibing.

6008
03:17:07,140 --> 03:17:08,260
Because like...

6009
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:09,920
During the Bison match...

6010
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:10,480
It was...

6011
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:11,500
I think...

6012
03:17:11,500 --> 03:17:13,340
I definitely cracked under the pressure.

6013
03:17:13,640 --> 03:17:17,960
Because everybody stopped talking and got super focused on me.

6014
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:19,060
And then...

6015
03:17:19,060 --> 03:17:22,020
I started being super like...

6016
03:17:22,020 --> 03:17:22,940
Stressed out.

6017
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:28,720
So like...

6018
03:17:28,720 --> 03:17:29,400
That's something...

6019
03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:30,560
Something like...

6020
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:32,380
Like I learned about myself.

6021
03:17:33,740 --> 03:17:35,720
Because I didn't notice that in Tekken.

6022
03:17:35,920 --> 03:17:38,800
Like the one time that happened to me was against...

6023
03:17:38,800 --> 03:17:40,020
The match against Gumi.

6024
03:17:40,300 --> 03:17:41,520
During Tekken...

6025
03:17:41,520 --> 03:17:43,160
Like the first game during finals.

6026
03:17:43,440 --> 03:17:44,520
That happened to me.

6027
03:17:44,880 --> 03:17:46,900
But then I didn't realize it was like...

6028
03:17:46,900 --> 03:17:47,860
Oh because I wasn't...

6029
03:17:47,860 --> 03:17:49,420
I was just thinking too much.

6030
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:50,380
But now...

6031
03:17:50,380 --> 03:17:51,980
I learned that like...

6032
03:17:51,980 --> 03:17:55,180
I learned that like...

6033
03:17:55,180 --> 03:17:57,800
If everybody's too serious...

6034
03:17:58,780 --> 03:18:01,520
If everybody is too serious...

6035
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:02,820
I just don't know what to do.

6036
03:18:03,020 --> 03:18:04,460
I just do...

6037
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:06,260
I just...

6038
03:18:06,260 --> 03:18:08,040
I just don't know what to do...

6039
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:09,740
When everybody is way too serious.

6040
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:11,180
Because I realized...

6041
03:18:11,180 --> 03:18:11,340
Wait.

6042
03:18:11,440 --> 03:18:13,140
When we were talking about Overwatch...

6043
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:15,580
Like I was doing really well.

6044
03:18:15,740 --> 03:18:16,700
Because I wasn't thinking.

6045
03:18:16,920 --> 03:18:19,420
And I was just doing what I'm used to doing.

6046
03:18:19,580 --> 03:18:19,820
And...

6047
03:18:19,820 --> 03:18:20,460
When...

6048
03:18:20,460 --> 03:18:22,020
I do better when I'm reacting.

6049
03:18:22,260 --> 03:18:22,920
That's for sure.

6050
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:23,520
Than...

6051
03:18:24,040 --> 03:18:25,280
Thinking up a game plan.

6052
03:18:25,940 --> 03:18:26,620
No way.

6053
03:18:26,760 --> 03:18:27,300
But yeah.

6054
03:18:31,900 --> 03:18:32,380
Yeah.

6055
03:18:34,260 --> 03:18:35,460
It's more so like...

6056
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:35,860
Oh man.

6057
03:18:37,480 --> 03:18:37,920
It's...

6058
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:41,980
It's easier for me to react than it is to have a game plan.

6059
03:18:42,240 --> 03:18:42,680
Because like...

6060
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:43,460
I start...

6061
03:18:43,460 --> 03:18:44,820
I start like being like...

6062
03:18:44,820 --> 03:18:45,380
What the fuck do I do?

6063
03:18:50,620 --> 03:18:51,500
Next time...

6064
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:52,120
If I ever...

6065
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:53,900
I don't know about doing any...

6066
03:18:53,900 --> 03:18:54,420
I don't know.

6067
03:18:54,560 --> 03:18:56,520
I don't know about getting a bite again for a time.

6068
03:18:56,780 --> 03:18:57,640
But like...

6069
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:00,520
Depends on the game.

6070
03:19:01,700 --> 03:19:02,980
Depends on the game.

6071
03:19:03,860 --> 03:19:04,700
But like...

6072
03:19:04,700 --> 03:19:05,900
If I'm put above beginner...

6073
03:19:06,380 --> 03:19:07,140
I'm not gonna...

6074
03:19:08,140 --> 03:19:10,360
I'm really way too stressed out as a beginner.

6075
03:19:12,200 --> 03:19:13,140
So like...

6076
03:19:13,140 --> 03:19:14,340
If I'm put above my tier...

6077
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:14,960
I'm not doing it.

6078
03:19:17,740 --> 03:19:19,700
And it depends on the team.

6079
03:19:19,720 --> 03:19:20,600
And the team vibe.

6080
03:19:20,920 --> 03:19:21,700
I don't like...

6081
03:19:21,700 --> 03:19:22,320
I even...

6082
03:19:23,220 --> 03:19:23,700
During...

6083
03:19:23,700 --> 03:19:24,460
The...

6084
03:19:24,460 --> 03:19:26,240
During the thing with...

6085
03:19:26,820 --> 03:19:27,300
Sajam.

6086
03:19:27,400 --> 03:19:27,880
When I...

6087
03:19:27,880 --> 03:19:29,380
When they asked me what kind of team I want.

6088
03:19:29,480 --> 03:19:30,460
I literally said like...

6089
03:19:30,460 --> 03:19:31,100
I don't...

6090
03:19:31,100 --> 03:19:32,300
I don't care about winning.

6091
03:19:32,880 --> 03:19:33,760
I just...

6092
03:19:33,760 --> 03:19:34,440
Want...

6093
03:19:34,440 --> 03:19:34,680
You know...

6094
03:19:34,680 --> 03:19:35,840
A team that vibes.

6095
03:19:36,100 --> 03:19:36,760
Like I literally...

6096
03:19:36,760 --> 03:19:37,460
That's what I told Sajam.

6097
03:19:37,620 --> 03:19:38,080
I was like...

6098
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:38,500
Don't...

6099
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:40,300
Don't put me a team that's super serious.

6100
03:19:40,400 --> 03:19:40,800
Like I...

6101
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:41,740
Don't fuck with that.

6102
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:42,220
Like...

6103
03:19:42,220 --> 03:19:42,600
I...

6104
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:43,340
I...

6105
03:19:43,860 --> 03:19:44,340
I...

6106
03:19:45,960 --> 03:19:47,060
I was just like...

6107
03:19:47,060 --> 03:19:48,820
Don't put me a team that just...

6108
03:19:48,820 --> 03:19:51,200
Is here to just win and nothing else.

6109
03:19:51,280 --> 03:19:52,140
Like I was like...

6110
03:19:52,140 --> 03:19:52,540
I...

6111
03:19:52,540 --> 03:19:54,220
I just want a vibe team.

6112
03:19:54,480 --> 03:19:55,880
Like that's literally all I want.

6113
03:19:55,960 --> 03:19:56,180
Like...

6114
03:19:58,940 --> 03:20:00,280
Cause I was like...

6115
03:20:00,280 --> 03:20:01,320
I don't care.

6116
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:02,980
I just wanna have fun.

6117
03:20:03,160 --> 03:20:03,700
Like I don't...

6118
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:04,560
I don't...

6119
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:05,500
I don't care about...

6120
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:06,240
Like...

6121
03:20:06,240 --> 03:20:06,800
Winning.

6122
03:20:06,800 --> 03:20:07,080
Winning.

6123
03:20:07,100 --> 03:20:08,420
I just wanna have fun.

6124
03:20:08,560 --> 03:20:08,720
Like...

6125
03:20:08,720 --> 03:20:10,160
I don't want them to make me...

6126
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:12,420
Train for 10 hours a day.

6127
03:20:12,980 --> 03:20:14,320
I don't wanna...

6128
03:20:16,900 --> 03:20:17,460
So...

6129
03:20:17,460 --> 03:20:17,740
Um...

6130
03:20:18,220 --> 03:20:19,500
I'm glad the vibes...

6131
03:20:19,500 --> 03:20:19,780
Were...

6132
03:20:20,420 --> 03:20:21,540
Reset itself...

6133
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:23,080
After that second match.

6134
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:25,740
Cause that second match was so stressful.

6135
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:26,380
Like...

6136
03:20:26,380 --> 03:20:27,060
Everybody...

6137
03:20:27,060 --> 03:20:28,060
Was so serious.

6138
03:20:28,120 --> 03:20:30,100
And I don't even know if I should talk anymore.

6139
03:20:30,360 --> 03:20:32,020
Because everybody was so serious.

6140
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:33,140
Um...

6141
03:20:33,140 --> 03:20:34,220
So I'm glad that...

6142
03:20:34,220 --> 03:20:34,540
That...

6143
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:36,980
The vibe softened up.

6144
03:20:37,100 --> 03:20:37,580
For...

6145
03:20:37,580 --> 03:20:38,380
Day...

6146
03:20:38,380 --> 03:20:39,480
Like this third match.

6147
03:20:40,220 --> 03:20:40,700
Uh...

6148
03:20:40,700 --> 03:20:41,620
For the third match.

6149
03:20:41,800 --> 03:20:41,980
Yeah.

6150
03:20:42,180 --> 03:20:43,620
I'm glad the vibe...

6151
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:43,780
Yeah.

6152
03:20:43,800 --> 03:20:45,600
And then I had to have a mental reset there.

6153
03:20:46,500 --> 03:20:46,980
Uh...

6154
03:20:47,400 --> 03:20:47,640
Yeah.

6155
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:48,360
The pressure.

6156
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,160
Ah...

6157
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:49,740
The pressure.

6158
03:20:49,800 --> 03:20:51,300
That's what happens for your tournaments.

6159
03:20:51,440 --> 03:20:52,180
I'm glad that...

6160
03:20:52,960 --> 03:20:53,440
Matman...

6161
03:20:53,440 --> 03:20:54,060
Uh...

6162
03:20:54,060 --> 03:20:55,340
Came to help too.

6163
03:20:55,660 --> 03:20:56,140
For...

6164
03:20:56,140 --> 03:20:56,360
Uh...

6165
03:20:56,360 --> 03:20:56,800
Cause Mat...

6166
03:20:56,800 --> 03:20:57,380
Mat...

6167
03:20:57,380 --> 03:20:58,880
Like messaged Brawl Pro too.

6168
03:20:58,920 --> 03:20:59,700
To be like...

6169
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:00,120
Yeah.

6170
03:21:00,120 --> 03:21:00,500
Like...

6171
03:21:00,500 --> 03:21:01,680
Softened up the vibe.

6172
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:01,980
Like...

6173
03:21:01,980 --> 03:21:02,860
Make it...

6174
03:21:02,860 --> 03:21:04,100
Make it less stressful.

6175
03:21:04,220 --> 03:21:04,640
And stuff.

6176
03:21:04,760 --> 03:21:05,320
Very jokey.

6177
03:21:05,440 --> 03:21:06,780
So I really appreciate that too.

6178
03:21:07,500 --> 03:21:08,020
And...

6179
03:21:08,020 --> 03:21:08,620
Uh...

6180
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:10,020
And...

6181
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:10,460
Uh...

6182
03:21:10,460 --> 03:21:11,240
Oh my god though.

6183
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:12,500
Watching that JP match.

6184
03:21:12,920 --> 03:21:14,060
Against Brawl Pro.

6185
03:21:14,260 --> 03:21:15,060
I was mad.

6186
03:21:16,100 --> 03:21:17,480
I was like...

6187
03:21:17,480 --> 03:21:18,780
This is fucking stupid.

6188
03:21:20,520 --> 03:21:21,040
Like...

6189
03:21:24,160 --> 03:21:25,400
I didn't say much.

6190
03:21:25,700 --> 03:21:26,280
But like...

6191
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:27,960
Watching that match up.

6192
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:28,600
I was like...

6193
03:21:28,600 --> 03:21:29,980
This is fucking stupid.

6194
03:21:29,980 --> 03:21:30,080
I was like...

6195
03:21:30,120 --> 03:21:31,180
Like ban this character.

6196
03:21:31,560 --> 03:21:31,940
Like...

6197
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:34,620
I was like...

6198
03:21:34,620 --> 03:21:36,080
This should take the meter.

6199
03:21:36,180 --> 03:21:38,000
This is so fucking stupid.

6200
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:38,880
Like...

6201
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:40,180
I was like...

6202
03:21:40,180 --> 03:21:41,300
I was like...

6203
03:21:41,300 --> 03:21:42,100
Bro...

6204
03:21:42,100 --> 03:21:42,640
Like...

6205
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:44,020
This is so...

6206
03:21:44,020 --> 03:21:45,420
I was like...

6207
03:21:45,420 --> 03:21:47,180
If I had to play that...

6208
03:21:47,180 --> 03:21:48,140
I would just forfeit.

6209
03:21:48,220 --> 03:21:48,480
Like...

6210
03:21:48,480 --> 03:21:48,920
I don't care.

6211
03:21:49,160 --> 03:21:49,740
Like...

6212
03:21:49,740 --> 03:21:52,740
If anybody actually counter...

6213
03:21:52,740 --> 03:21:54,600
Counterpicked me...

6214
03:21:54,600 --> 03:21:56,580
And played JP...

6215
03:21:56,580 --> 03:21:57,920
I literally would just...

6216
03:21:57,920 --> 03:21:58,960
Play one round.

6217
03:21:59,020 --> 03:22:00,100
See that shit.

6218
03:22:00,100 --> 03:22:00,920
And I'm like...

6219
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:01,500
I'm sorry guys.

6220
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:02,300
I'm forfeiting.

6221
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:03,260
Like...

6222
03:22:03,260 --> 03:22:03,880
I...

6223
03:22:03,880 --> 03:22:04,780
This is...

6224
03:22:04,780 --> 03:22:06,580
So fucking stupid.

6225
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:10,360
Like...

6226
03:22:13,280 --> 03:22:16,520
I wasn't having fun watching that.

6227
03:22:16,600 --> 03:22:17,840
And I wasn't even playing.

6228
03:22:17,880 --> 03:22:19,620
I felt the fucking tilt.

6229
03:22:19,740 --> 03:22:20,340
Like...

6230
03:22:20,340 --> 03:22:22,060
This is...

6231
03:22:23,880 --> 03:22:24,720
Like...

6232
03:22:25,780 --> 03:22:27,340
I'm so...

6233
03:22:28,100 --> 03:22:29,000
Yeah...

6234
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:30,080
I...

6235
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:31,400
Um...

6236
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:32,800
Yeah...

6237
03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:33,200
Like...

6238
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:33,600
Like...

6239
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:34,180
Get me...

6240
03:22:34,180 --> 03:22:35,740
I was like...

6241
03:22:35,740 --> 03:22:37,620
I don't even want to watch this anymore.

6242
03:22:37,960 --> 03:22:38,560
Like...

6243
03:22:39,100 --> 03:22:39,660
Jesus...

6244
03:22:39,660 --> 03:22:40,040
Yeah...

6245
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:40,540
I was like...

6246
03:22:40,540 --> 03:22:43,080
I don't even want to fucking watch this.

6247
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:43,460
Like...

6248
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:45,640
This isn't even fun to watch.

6249
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:46,360
Like...

6250
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:46,900
Like...

6251
03:22:46,900 --> 03:22:49,020
I was on that JP's team.

6252
03:22:49,280 --> 03:22:51,860
I don't even want to have fun watching this game.

6253
03:22:52,040 --> 03:22:53,500
Cause I would just hate you.

6254
03:22:53,720 --> 03:22:54,240
Like...

6255
03:22:55,300 --> 03:22:55,900
Hahaha...

6256
03:22:55,900 --> 03:22:56,680
Hahaha...

6257
03:22:56,680 --> 03:22:57,680
Hahaha...

6258
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:58,160
Hahaha...

6259
03:22:58,160 --> 03:22:58,540
Hahaha...

6260
03:23:00,960 --> 03:23:01,480
Yeah...

6261
03:23:01,480 --> 03:23:01,620
Haha...

6262
03:23:03,240 --> 03:23:03,760
Yeah...

6263
03:23:03,760 --> 03:23:04,200
Haha...

6264
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:05,100
Yeah...

6265
03:23:05,100 --> 03:23:05,940
Yeah...

6266
03:23:05,940 --> 03:23:06,440
But...

6267
03:23:06,440 --> 03:23:07,660
It was a good learning experience.

6268
03:23:08,140 --> 03:23:08,380
Um...

6269
03:23:08,380 --> 03:23:08,900
I'm glad...

6270
03:23:08,900 --> 03:23:09,460
Like...

6271
03:23:09,460 --> 03:23:12,180
I helped the team out on day one and two.

6272
03:23:12,240 --> 03:23:13,340
And then my team...

6273
03:23:13,860 --> 03:23:14,120
Um...

6274
03:23:14,120 --> 03:23:15,760
My team backed me up on...

6275
03:23:15,760 --> 03:23:16,080
Uh...

6276
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:16,640
Day three.

6277
03:23:16,680 --> 03:23:17,320
I'm sorry, guys.

6278
03:23:17,380 --> 03:23:19,640
I didn't win my keep matches in the finals.

6279
03:23:19,820 --> 03:23:20,420
I'm sorry.

6280
03:23:20,760 --> 03:23:22,900
I know I should have practiced more.

6281
03:23:23,060 --> 03:23:23,960
But like...

6282
03:23:23,960 --> 03:23:25,700
I played for the vibes.

6283
03:23:25,960 --> 03:23:26,360
Hahaha...

6284
03:23:26,360 --> 03:23:27,120
I mean...

6285
03:23:27,120 --> 03:23:27,860
I...

6286
03:23:27,860 --> 03:23:29,780
I know I should have not played.

6287
03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:30,320
Like...

6288
03:23:30,320 --> 03:23:31,200
Roblox yesterday.

6289
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:32,160
But like...

6290
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:33,040
I couldn't, guys.

6291
03:23:33,180 --> 03:23:33,540
Like...

6292
03:23:33,540 --> 03:23:34,060
I...

6293
03:23:34,060 --> 03:23:34,760
I swear.

6294
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:36,760
If I had to play more Street Fighter yesterday.

6295
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:38,520
If I had to like...

6296
03:23:38,520 --> 03:23:39,040
Like...

6297
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:39,720
Not play more...

6298
03:23:39,720 --> 03:23:40,920
If I had to like...

6299
03:23:40,920 --> 03:23:44,240
Grind out Street Fighter even more yesterday.

6300
03:23:44,320 --> 03:23:45,840
I was so fucking done.

6301
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:46,360
Like...

6302
03:23:46,360 --> 03:23:46,760
Hahaha...

6303
03:23:46,760 --> 03:23:47,880
I needed that...

6304
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:49,600
I needed that mental reset.

6305
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:50,440
Like...

6306
03:23:50,440 --> 03:23:51,040
Hahaha...

6307
03:23:51,040 --> 03:23:53,600
I really needed that mental reset.

6308
03:23:53,740 --> 03:23:54,400
Like...

6309
03:23:54,400 --> 03:23:55,620
Hahaha...

6310
03:23:55,620 --> 03:23:56,680
I...

6311
03:23:56,680 --> 03:23:57,040
Like...

6312
03:23:57,400 --> 03:23:57,760
Um...

6313
03:23:57,760 --> 03:23:59,180
Cause like...

6314
03:23:59,840 --> 03:24:03,040
Two hours before the stream.

6315
03:24:03,800 --> 03:24:04,320
Um...

6316
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:06,840
Two hours before today's stream.

6317
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:08,360
I did the custom room.

6318
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:09,920
I did a custom room.

6319
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:11,580
And I was just like...

6320
03:24:11,580 --> 03:24:12,420
I'm so...

6321
03:24:12,420 --> 03:24:12,920
I can't...

6322
03:24:12,920 --> 03:24:13,560
I'm so done.

6323
03:24:13,700 --> 03:24:13,980
Hahaha...

6324
03:24:13,980 --> 03:24:14,840
I was just like...

6325
03:24:14,840 --> 03:24:15,400
I was...

6326
03:24:15,400 --> 03:24:16,940
Cause I've been fighting the same...

6327
03:24:16,940 --> 03:24:17,460
You know?

6328
03:24:17,500 --> 03:24:18,480
Cause you're just...

6329
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:18,800
I...

6330
03:24:18,800 --> 03:24:19,820
I was just like...

6331
03:24:19,820 --> 03:24:20,740
Oh my god.

6332
03:24:20,880 --> 03:24:21,400
Like...

6333
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:24,140
Like seeing the same moves over and over again.

6334
03:24:24,320 --> 03:24:25,120
And I'm just like...

6335
03:24:25,120 --> 03:24:25,720
Oh my god.

6336
03:24:25,920 --> 03:24:26,240
Hahaha...

6337
03:24:26,240 --> 03:24:27,120
I was just like...

6338
03:24:27,120 --> 03:24:28,080
Blank of all...

6339
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:28,740
Blank of...

6340
03:24:28,740 --> 03:24:29,560
Slide...

6341
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:30,780
Blank of all...

6342
03:24:30,780 --> 03:24:31,860
Slide...

6343
03:24:31,860 --> 03:24:32,900
Kick...

6344
03:24:32,900 --> 03:24:34,060
And I was just like...

6345
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:35,480
I'm going crazy.

6346
03:24:35,660 --> 03:24:37,060
I'm gonna fucking go crazy.

6347
03:24:37,240 --> 03:24:37,920
Hahaha...

6348
03:24:39,200 --> 03:24:39,880
Hahaha...

6349
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:42,320
I was like...

6350
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:44,200
I'm gonna go fucking...

6351
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:45,060
I'm gonna go nuclear.

6352
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:46,560
Hahaha...

6353
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:47,200
Yeah...

6354
03:24:48,060 --> 03:24:48,740
Hahaha...

6355
03:24:51,320 --> 03:24:52,000
Um...

6356
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:53,780
Um...

6357
03:24:54,460 --> 03:24:55,140
Yeah...

6358
03:24:55,140 --> 03:24:56,060
They were all really...

6359
03:24:56,060 --> 03:24:56,760
Uh...

6360
03:24:56,760 --> 03:24:57,100
Really...

6361
03:24:57,100 --> 03:24:58,100
Close matches.

6362
03:24:58,740 --> 03:24:59,900
They were all really close matches.

6363
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:00,280
They had...

6364
03:25:00,280 --> 03:25:03,040
The enemies adapted really, really well to me.

6365
03:25:03,200 --> 03:25:05,240
And I couldn't adapt in time.

6366
03:25:05,440 --> 03:25:06,400
But I think I...

6367
03:25:06,400 --> 03:25:07,340
I basically...

6368
03:25:07,340 --> 03:25:07,980
I...

6369
03:25:07,980 --> 03:25:08,560
Uh...

6370
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:10,580
I took all the matches to like...

6371
03:25:10,580 --> 03:25:11,160
The dot.

6372
03:25:11,300 --> 03:25:11,620
Like...

6373
03:25:11,620 --> 03:25:13,380
The fact that all of them...

6374
03:25:14,200 --> 03:25:14,780
Uh...

6375
03:25:15,780 --> 03:25:16,360
Um...

6376
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:18,220
The fact that all of them...

6377
03:25:18,220 --> 03:25:19,240
Labbed hours.

6378
03:25:19,420 --> 03:25:20,660
Or like...

6379
03:25:20,660 --> 03:25:22,220
Studied how I played.

6380
03:25:22,240 --> 03:25:22,780
And everything.

6381
03:25:23,240 --> 03:25:23,960
And like...

6382
03:25:23,960 --> 03:25:25,280
Changed up their playstyle.

6383
03:25:25,640 --> 03:25:26,140
That...

6384
03:25:26,140 --> 03:25:26,740
I thought...

6385
03:25:26,740 --> 03:25:27,080
I thought...

6386
03:25:27,080 --> 03:25:28,440
That was very impressive.

6387
03:25:28,660 --> 03:25:32,180
Everybody changed their playstyle just to fight me.

6388
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:32,920
Like...

6389
03:25:32,920 --> 03:25:35,380
They had the same playstyle for everybody else.

6390
03:25:35,780 --> 03:25:39,600
And then everybody I fought changed the way they played.

6391
03:25:40,040 --> 03:25:40,640
Like...

6392
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:41,020
I...

6393
03:25:41,020 --> 03:25:43,300
I couldn't change the way I play in time for that.

6394
03:25:43,480 --> 03:25:43,940
Yeah...

6395
03:25:45,060 --> 03:25:45,660
Um...

6396
03:25:45,660 --> 03:25:46,620
Um...

6397
03:25:47,340 --> 03:25:47,940
So...

6398
03:25:47,940 --> 03:25:49,340
That's why I was like...

6399
03:25:49,340 --> 03:25:49,800
Like...

6400
03:25:49,800 --> 03:25:50,440
That's why that...

6401
03:25:50,440 --> 03:25:51,280
That threw me off.

6402
03:25:51,780 --> 03:25:52,380
Hahaha...

6403
03:25:53,560 --> 03:25:55,960
They all changed the way they played.

6404
03:25:56,140 --> 03:25:56,720
Uh...

6405
03:25:57,080 --> 03:25:57,580
So I...

6406
03:25:57,580 --> 03:25:58,740
That threw me off too.

6407
03:25:59,460 --> 03:25:59,820
Um...

6408
03:25:59,820 --> 03:26:01,540
Cause they knew I was really good at anti-air.

6409
03:26:01,620 --> 03:26:02,700
So they stopped jumping.

6410
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:03,840
And then...

6411
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:06,020
And they stopped doing air stuff.

6412
03:26:06,360 --> 03:26:06,840
Like...

6413
03:26:06,840 --> 03:26:07,400
Jumping stuff.

6414
03:26:07,560 --> 03:26:08,280
And then...

6415
03:26:08,280 --> 03:26:09,820
They played so passively.

6416
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:11,620
So I was just like...

6417
03:26:11,620 --> 03:26:12,720
Oh my god.

6418
03:26:12,780 --> 03:26:13,720
I never studied that.

6419
03:26:14,340 --> 03:26:14,820
Yeah...

6420
03:26:15,340 --> 03:26:15,820
Uh...

6421
03:26:15,820 --> 03:26:16,880
But in the end...

6422
03:26:16,880 --> 03:26:17,780
My team clutched it out.

6423
03:26:17,920 --> 03:26:18,400
So...

6424
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:19,480
Um...

6425
03:26:19,480 --> 03:26:20,240
Hahaha...

6426
03:26:20,240 --> 03:26:21,580
My team...

6427
03:26:21,580 --> 03:26:23,040
My team clutched it out.

6428
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:24,820
Everybody played differently.

6429
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:25,520
But...

6430
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:26,260
Doesn't matter.

6431
03:26:26,460 --> 03:26:27,060
They all...

6432
03:26:27,060 --> 03:26:27,980
They all lapped against me.

6433
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:28,700
But it doesn't matter.

6434
03:26:28,940 --> 03:26:29,220
They...

6435
03:26:29,220 --> 03:26:29,540
Fuck...

6436
03:26:29,540 --> 03:26:31,160
Our team still got to TwitchCon.

6437
03:26:31,400 --> 03:26:31,780
So...

6438
03:26:31,780 --> 03:26:32,320
Hahaha...

6439
03:26:32,320 --> 03:26:33,060
Like...

6440
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:34,540
Hahaha...

6441
03:26:34,540 --> 03:26:35,040
Hahaha...

6442
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:36,160
Hahaha...

6443
03:26:37,060 --> 03:26:38,100
They all...

6444
03:26:38,100 --> 03:26:39,100
It doesn't matter.

6445
03:26:39,300 --> 03:26:40,100
In the end...

6446
03:26:40,100 --> 03:26:41,620
We all still go to TwitchCon.

6447
03:26:41,740 --> 03:26:42,480
So like...

6448
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:43,300
Who the fuck cares?

6449
03:26:43,440 --> 03:26:43,900
Like...

6450
03:26:43,900 --> 03:26:44,280
Hahaha...

6451
03:26:44,280 --> 03:26:45,140
Whatever.

6452
03:26:45,520 --> 03:26:46,020
Like...

6453
03:26:46,020 --> 03:26:46,840
Hahaha...

6454
03:26:46,840 --> 03:26:49,040
I do wish I did perform better.

6455
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:49,900
I do...

6456
03:26:49,900 --> 03:26:50,780
Um...

6457
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:51,700
Cause everybody...

6458
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:53,000
That's also the thing.

6459
03:26:53,140 --> 03:26:53,960
A lot of people put...

6460
03:26:53,960 --> 03:26:55,440
So much expectation over me.

6461
03:26:55,440 --> 03:26:56,600
Because I 5-0'd.

6462
03:26:57,240 --> 03:26:57,840
Um...

6463
03:26:58,840 --> 03:26:59,900
Because I...

6464
03:26:59,900 --> 03:27:01,180
5-0'd...

6465
03:27:01,180 --> 03:27:02,200
On day 2.

6466
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:03,720
So a lot of people put like...

6467
03:27:03,720 --> 03:27:04,820
A lot of respect to me.

6468
03:27:05,060 --> 03:27:05,440
I was like...

6469
03:27:05,440 --> 03:27:05,920
Please don't.

6470
03:27:05,920 --> 03:27:06,160
Like...

6471
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:06,460
Hahaha...

6472
03:27:07,260 --> 03:27:07,860
Hahaha...

6473
03:27:07,860 --> 03:27:08,860
I was like...

6474
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:09,440
Please...

6475
03:27:09,960 --> 03:27:11,180
Don't do that to me.

6476
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:12,300
Please...

6477
03:27:13,720 --> 03:27:14,320
Hahaha...

6478
03:27:14,320 --> 03:27:15,140
Hahaha...

6479
03:27:15,140 --> 03:27:15,480
Hahaha...

6480
03:27:15,480 --> 03:27:15,740
Hahaha...

6481
03:27:15,740 --> 03:27:16,240
Hahaha...

6482
03:27:16,240 --> 03:27:17,660
I was like...

6483
03:27:17,660 --> 03:27:18,160
Please...

6484
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:18,660
Please...

6485
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:19,400
I...

6486
03:27:19,400 --> 03:27:20,360
I don't...

6487
03:27:20,360 --> 03:27:20,780
I don't...

6488
03:27:20,780 --> 03:27:21,080
I...

6489
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:23,260
I like being the underdog.

6490
03:27:23,360 --> 03:27:23,960
Please...

6491
03:27:26,560 --> 03:27:27,360
Please...

6492
03:27:27,360 --> 03:27:27,540
Please...

6493
03:27:30,840 --> 03:27:31,640
Please...

6494
03:27:31,640 --> 03:27:32,160
Please...

6495
03:27:32,160 --> 03:27:32,700
Please...

6496
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,340
Um...

6497
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:35,060
Um...

6498
03:27:35,060 --> 03:27:35,480
Ah...

6499
03:27:35,480 --> 03:27:37,000
Yeah, but...

6500
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:37,200
Yeah!

6501
03:27:37,300 --> 03:27:37,640
Anyway.

6502
03:27:38,660 --> 03:27:39,460
Ah...

6503
03:27:39,460 --> 03:27:40,500
Um...

6504
03:27:40,500 --> 03:27:41,020
It was great.

6505
03:27:41,260 --> 03:27:42,860
GG to team Brian.

6506
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:44,080
To the...

6507
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:45,180
Rest of...

6508
03:27:45,180 --> 03:27:45,940
Um...

6509
03:27:45,940 --> 03:27:47,560
To the rest of my team.

6510
03:27:47,900 --> 03:27:48,280
Um...

6511
03:27:48,280 --> 03:27:50,700
SK Brian Brawl Pro Coefficient.

6512
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:53,200
Especially for everybody for...

6513
03:27:53,200 --> 03:27:54,700
Putting me in the backpack.

6514
03:27:54,820 --> 03:27:55,420
So...

6515
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:57,720
So I can just chill like right after.

6516
03:27:57,800 --> 03:27:58,660
I was nervous.

6517
03:27:58,740 --> 03:28:02,380
I was so nervous today just because I knew how much pressure I had like day two.

6518
03:28:02,520 --> 03:28:03,780
I had zero pressure.

6519
03:28:04,340 --> 03:28:07,240
Day three, I had so much pressure and expectation.

6520
03:28:07,440 --> 03:28:10,060
So like I was just that made me so nervous.

6521
03:28:10,220 --> 03:28:12,320
But it was a good learning experience in the end.

6522
03:28:12,500 --> 03:28:14,000
I had I was just here vibing.

6523
03:28:14,100 --> 03:28:19,160
So I hope you guys enjoyed the Sajam Slam.

6524
03:28:19,540 --> 03:28:22,840
Another Sajam Slam arc for Street Fighter.

6525
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:27,540
For those who are wondering what's gonna happen at TwitchCon, you'll find out at TwitchCon.

6526
03:28:27,860 --> 03:28:29,600
So just watch that.

6527
03:28:29,720 --> 03:28:35,100
Just watch the TwitchCon Sajam Slam stream to see what they're gonna do to me.

6528
03:28:35,360 --> 03:28:39,940
Like what's funny is that Team Shine is gonna replace half their roster.

6529
03:28:40,200 --> 03:28:44,460
So I don't fucking know what the fuck is gonna happen to that roster.

6530
03:28:44,840 --> 03:28:54,440
So like like Team Shine literally has to replace half their roster to so like I don't know.

6531
03:28:55,620 --> 03:28:58,200
Like I don't know what they're gonna do there.

6532
03:29:04,060 --> 03:29:11,700
So like whoever's gonna be on Team Shine is just gonna be an entirely different team.

6533
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:16,500
Which I assume it's gonna have because it's their first two.

6534
03:29:16,740 --> 03:29:21,340
So I assume that it's either Daya and Daya and Otto's team.

6535
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:26,640
So either Saikuno or Saikuno.

6536
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:27,120
Who is it?

6537
03:29:27,240 --> 03:29:29,960
Daya... J... Otto's team got knocked out.

6538
03:29:30,120 --> 03:29:34,760
So who's in... Who's Otto's first first seed?

6539
03:29:35,060 --> 03:29:36,240
First seed?

6540
03:29:36,640 --> 03:29:37,220
Seratina?

6541
03:29:37,460 --> 03:29:40,120
So either Daya or Seratina.

6542
03:29:40,240 --> 03:29:40,760
Oh sorry sorry.

6543
03:29:41,120 --> 03:29:54,140
Seratina or Saikuno are just gonna replace uh it's gonna replace uh um Shine's first first seed.

6544
03:29:54,220 --> 03:29:57,140
And then I guess who's the second seed?

6545
03:29:57,260 --> 03:29:58,520
I don't remember whose second seed is.

6546
03:29:58,580 --> 03:30:02,340
Group B... Group B uh group B.

6547
03:30:02,920 --> 03:30:03,960
Where's Group B?

6548
03:30:04,160 --> 03:30:06,420
And then... Not B sorry C.

6549
03:30:06,720 --> 03:30:15,060
And then it's gonna be either Cat or Cat or Amour replacing their second.

6550
03:30:15,880 --> 03:30:18,620
So... Wait what is Umi calling me about?

6551
03:30:18,840 --> 03:30:19,380
Hello?

6552
03:30:20,180 --> 03:30:21,320
Can you mod me?

6553
03:30:21,660 --> 03:30:23,100
Is that why you called me?

6554
03:30:23,880 --> 03:30:25,300
No I want to ask are you calling me?

6555
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:26,580
Are you really not going to TwitchCon?

6556
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:31,260
Well, I'm not gonna say it to people or they're gonna try and find me, Gumi.

6557
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:33,460
This is why I don't say if I'm going anywhere.

6558
03:30:35,340 --> 03:30:41,700
Well, I DM'd you and you never told me so I thought I would have to call you so you'd finally give me an answer.

6559
03:30:41,820 --> 03:30:43,420
I won't tell, I won't snitch!

6560
03:30:43,720 --> 03:30:45,100
I'm on stream!

6561
03:30:45,960 --> 03:30:46,840
Damn it!

6562
03:30:46,860 --> 03:30:51,640
I'm not gonna fucking say if I'm going or not if I'm streaming, Gumi!

6563
03:30:51,640 --> 03:30:55,460
Oh my god, oh my god, that's why I'm asking you to just type it!

6564
03:30:55,560 --> 03:30:57,340
That's why I'm asking you to type it, man!

6565
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:58,160
Okay.

6566
03:31:03,920 --> 03:31:04,800
I see!

6567
03:31:06,620 --> 03:31:07,260
That's cool.

6568
03:31:08,940 --> 03:31:11,020
Chat, she just typed lol at me.

6569
03:31:11,320 --> 03:31:12,600
Yeah, lol, lol.

6570
03:31:13,340 --> 03:31:14,720
I just said lmao.

6571
03:31:15,700 --> 03:31:16,580
Are you watching?

6572
03:31:16,660 --> 03:31:17,940
I'm not watching the games, by the way.

6573
03:31:17,980 --> 03:31:19,280
Are you watching the last finals?

6574
03:31:19,920 --> 03:31:21,620
I'm just vibing with my chat.

6575
03:31:21,640 --> 03:31:22,240
I'm so honest.

6576
03:31:22,640 --> 03:31:26,400
I got so tired after waiting to play my next game for two hours.

6577
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:29,860
Girl, I was so stressed out.

6578
03:31:30,140 --> 03:31:30,540
It was...

6579
03:31:32,840 --> 03:31:33,720
I'm tired.

6580
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:38,440
That's why I was like, I wasn't watching it because I was like, I'm too tired to keep going.

6581
03:31:38,600 --> 03:31:39,720
I just wanna vibe.

6582
03:31:40,320 --> 03:31:41,560
I don't wanna talk more.

6583
03:31:41,880 --> 03:31:41,900
I'm also tired.

6584
03:31:42,660 --> 03:31:43,880
No, I don't wanna talk more.

6585
03:31:43,920 --> 03:31:45,300
I just don't wanna talk more Street Fighter.

6586
03:31:45,420 --> 03:31:47,080
I'm so... I'm tired.

6587
03:31:47,080 --> 03:31:47,180
I'm tired.

6588
03:31:50,680 --> 03:31:52,040
Did you see my costume?

6589
03:31:52,640 --> 03:31:53,300
Yeah, I did.

6590
03:31:53,380 --> 03:31:54,580
They were posting the picture.

6591
03:31:54,820 --> 03:31:55,080
Yeah.

6592
03:31:55,640 --> 03:31:57,280
And you changed your playstyle.

6593
03:31:57,600 --> 03:31:58,400
It fucked with me.

6594
03:31:58,640 --> 03:31:59,740
You were so passive.

6595
03:32:01,080 --> 03:32:01,640
Oh, yeah.

6596
03:32:02,540 --> 03:32:02,940
Um...

6597
03:32:02,940 --> 03:32:06,240
I... it's because I'm so used to like, you know in Tekken?

6598
03:32:06,440 --> 03:32:06,760
Yeah.

6599
03:32:06,900 --> 03:32:10,300
Where it's like, if you lose your turn, you just need to get it back.

6600
03:32:10,480 --> 03:32:10,740
Yeah.

6601
03:32:10,760 --> 03:32:13,700
In my head, I was like, I have to be aggro all the time or else...

6602
03:32:13,700 --> 03:32:14,400
Yeah, yeah.

6603
03:32:14,420 --> 03:32:16,760
I played as if you were gonna be aggro.

6604
03:32:16,760 --> 03:32:18,720
And then you were so passive.

6605
03:32:18,800 --> 03:32:19,800
It like, fucked with me.

6606
03:32:19,900 --> 03:32:20,860
Because I was like, what are you doing?

6607
03:32:21,280 --> 03:32:23,080
I was just looking at you.

6608
03:32:23,100 --> 03:32:24,480
I was like, are you gonna move?

6609
03:32:25,100 --> 03:32:25,700
I know.

6610
03:32:27,420 --> 03:32:29,760
Yeah, so I was just like... so...

6611
03:32:29,760 --> 03:32:30,380
Yeah, no.

6612
03:32:30,520 --> 03:32:33,420
Like, everybody changed the way they played against me.

6613
03:32:34,900 --> 03:32:36,840
Yeah, you're like, everyone's off.

6614
03:32:38,880 --> 03:32:41,480
I was just like... no, everyone was so passive.

6615
03:32:41,620 --> 03:32:43,140
I didn't know how to deal with that.

6616
03:32:43,500 --> 03:32:46,280
I think it's because they realized I don't know how to play against passive players.

6617
03:32:46,280 --> 03:32:47,140
Against Seratina.

6618
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:50,960
So everybody found out that passiveness fucks me up.

6619
03:32:52,840 --> 03:32:56,480
Oh, I didn't... I think I had to just play passive in general.

6620
03:32:56,760 --> 03:32:59,260
My coach told me...

6621
03:32:59,260 --> 03:33:00,980
Wait, I should tell you this.

6622
03:33:01,900 --> 03:33:02,380
What?

6623
03:33:02,520 --> 03:33:05,000
I'm no longer gonna tell me what my coach told me.

6624
03:33:05,340 --> 03:33:05,380
No, tell me.

6625
03:33:05,380 --> 03:33:05,700
Tell me.

6626
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:07,300
No.

6627
03:33:07,480 --> 03:33:07,880
Tell me.

6628
03:33:07,880 --> 03:33:08,980
I'm gonna play the same way.

6629
03:33:09,300 --> 03:33:10,700
If I go to TwitchCon.

6630
03:33:11,820 --> 03:33:13,280
I mean, you should tell me.

6631
03:33:13,320 --> 03:33:14,940
It's a 50-50 if I'm there or not.

6632
03:33:16,700 --> 03:33:17,180
No.

6633
03:33:18,540 --> 03:33:21,600
Because you said I couldn't sleep on the bed with you.

6634
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:23,320
Yeah.

6635
03:33:23,820 --> 03:33:26,060
I mean, if you tell me, maybe I'll change my mind.

6636
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:27,020
Really?

6637
03:33:27,140 --> 03:33:27,980
You mean it?

6638
03:33:28,020 --> 03:33:28,480
Tell me.

6639
03:33:32,930 --> 03:33:35,390
Anyways, my coach just told me to keep jumping.

6640
03:33:36,550 --> 03:33:37,650
To keep jumping?

6641
03:33:37,670 --> 03:33:39,170
You didn't jump a lot, though.

6642
03:33:39,730 --> 03:33:43,770
Yeah, because you didn't do your weird bald-headed smudge or something.

6643
03:33:45,170 --> 03:33:46,030
Yeah, yeah.

6644
03:33:46,270 --> 03:33:47,530
Yeah, no, but like...

6645
03:33:47,530 --> 03:33:50,710
I was waiting for you to jump at me, but you didn't do that either.

6646
03:33:52,550 --> 03:33:53,350
Yeah, no.

6647
03:33:53,490 --> 03:33:55,450
I was like, man, everyone's probably...

6648
03:33:55,450 --> 03:33:57,610
I only do like three moves, man.

6649
03:33:58,590 --> 03:33:59,870
No, yeah, but you...

6650
03:34:00,470 --> 03:34:03,050
You like slowed down the entire game.

6651
03:34:03,610 --> 03:34:05,510
So I was just like, why do I...

6652
03:34:07,470 --> 03:34:09,030
Like, who's gonna go first?

6653
03:34:09,530 --> 03:34:10,490
But it's alright.

6654
03:34:10,730 --> 03:34:12,470
Both of our teams are going to TwitchCon.

6655
03:34:12,510 --> 03:34:13,430
Let's fucking go.

6656
03:34:13,830 --> 03:34:14,130
I know.

6657
03:34:14,870 --> 03:34:15,310
Yeah.

6658
03:34:17,530 --> 03:34:19,210
Oh my gosh, I'm so tired.

6659
03:34:19,390 --> 03:34:23,450
Have you been tired just learning Street Fighter for like the past week?

6660
03:34:24,330 --> 03:34:26,650
Do you want to know how many hours I have in Street Fighter?

6661
03:34:26,750 --> 03:34:27,330
How many hours?

6662
03:34:28,450 --> 03:34:31,610
23 and half of it was just on the waiting menu.

6663
03:34:32,870 --> 03:34:36,630
Is that like how much you could... like, were you just done after that?

6664
03:34:36,770 --> 03:34:37,970
Or were you just like...

6665
03:34:37,970 --> 03:34:41,710
Like, I think...

6666
03:34:42,990 --> 03:34:43,490
Personally...

6667
03:34:43,490 --> 03:34:47,510
I can't play fighting games for too long or else my hands hurt.

6668
03:34:47,510 --> 03:34:50,150
Oh, yeah, I saw... yeah, I heard about that, yeah.

6669
03:34:50,370 --> 03:34:52,790
Because I know like in Tekken you grinded a lot, though.

6670
03:34:53,450 --> 03:34:55,190
Yeah, and look at what happened to my hands.

6671
03:34:55,190 --> 03:34:55,950
Yeah, and then your hands.

6672
03:34:56,030 --> 03:34:57,930
You fucked up your hands after Tekken.

6673
03:34:58,330 --> 03:35:01,290
I actually had calluses forming on my thumbs and stuff.

6674
03:35:01,410 --> 03:35:03,090
Oh my god, that's fucking crazy.

6675
03:35:04,330 --> 03:35:05,210
Holy shit.

6676
03:35:06,310 --> 03:35:09,610
Yeah, and Street Fighter is my first time playing on a level list.

6677
03:35:09,730 --> 03:35:09,950
Yeah.

6678
03:35:11,170 --> 03:35:13,070
And sometimes I do be looking down.

6679
03:35:13,190 --> 03:35:14,130
I'm like, what key am I pressing?

6680
03:35:14,130 --> 03:35:14,670
Yeah, me too.

6681
03:35:14,930 --> 03:35:15,510
Me too.

6682
03:35:15,790 --> 03:35:15,890
Yeah.

6683
03:35:15,890 --> 03:35:20,850
I couldn't play too much Street Fighter because I'd just get burned out or mad.

6684
03:35:21,330 --> 03:35:22,190
I know!

6685
03:35:22,650 --> 03:35:23,770
That's why I don't play Rank.

6686
03:35:23,930 --> 03:35:24,350
Do you know what?

6687
03:35:24,350 --> 03:35:26,270
Rank is a real friendship.

6688
03:35:26,730 --> 03:35:30,590
As soon as I got Heartstuck Silver for like six plus hours...

6689
03:35:30,590 --> 03:35:34,030
I just stopped playing Rank and just made custom lobbies against viewers.

6690
03:35:34,230 --> 03:35:35,370
Because I was like, I can't.

6691
03:35:35,370 --> 03:35:36,710
This is making me too angry.

6692
03:35:37,210 --> 03:35:44,930
I think like in the past, I would say the Rank Confederate games that made me the most angry was Splatoon.

6693
03:35:44,930 --> 03:35:48,110
Because you can't voice chat and yell at your teammates too.

6694
03:35:48,210 --> 03:35:51,170
You can't like yell at people if they're fucking bad.

6695
03:35:51,590 --> 03:35:53,090
And you can't avoid them too.

6696
03:35:53,430 --> 03:35:55,830
So like, Splatoon Rank was terrible.

6697
03:35:56,110 --> 03:36:00,290
And it actually made me like yell at my TV and like throw my controller.

6698
03:36:00,530 --> 03:36:01,550
Because I was so angry.

6699
03:36:02,010 --> 03:36:03,670
No, I feel like that's how like...

6700
03:36:03,670 --> 03:36:05,630
I think Overwatch...

6701
03:36:05,630 --> 03:36:06,950
Overwatch is fine for me.

6702
03:36:07,430 --> 03:36:08,070
No, no.

6703
03:36:08,110 --> 03:36:11,390
When there's terrible players, I feel like I become a different person.

6704
03:36:11,750 --> 03:36:12,430
You know?

6705
03:36:12,430 --> 03:36:13,310
No, that's true too.

6706
03:36:13,310 --> 03:36:15,510
But then like, I've never...

6707
03:36:15,510 --> 03:36:23,190
But never in my life has a Rank game like Street Fighter overpowered my hate of Splatoon Rank.

6708
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:25,170
Street Fighter... like Tekken Rank, I was fine.

6709
03:36:25,350 --> 03:36:26,590
I enjoyed Tekken Rank.

6710
03:36:27,570 --> 03:36:29,930
Street Fighter Rank, oh my god.

6711
03:36:30,150 --> 03:36:32,670
Like, it actually made me so angry.

6712
03:36:34,490 --> 03:36:35,010
Kidding?

6713
03:36:36,090 --> 03:36:39,810
I genuinely don't care about Rank, which is why I never moved past Iron.

6714
03:36:39,850 --> 03:36:41,650
I just haven't played a Ranked game since that week.

6715
03:36:41,650 --> 03:36:41,970
Yeah.

6716
03:36:41,970 --> 03:36:43,990
The first day of Siege M7, because like...

6717
03:36:43,990 --> 03:36:46,590
I don't care about hitting a high Rank.

6718
03:36:46,870 --> 03:36:47,850
And not only that, it's like...

6719
03:36:47,850 --> 03:36:50,410
You kind of just don't know...

6720
03:36:50,410 --> 03:36:54,990
I don't like playing against someone and them seeing me play like while trying to figure it out.

6721
03:36:55,190 --> 03:36:55,570
Yeah.

6722
03:36:55,570 --> 03:36:56,530
Yeah, that's true too.

6723
03:36:56,890 --> 03:36:59,170
I wish like...

6724
03:36:59,170 --> 03:36:59,750
I...

6725
03:36:59,750 --> 03:37:01,730
I kept asking...

6726
03:37:01,730 --> 03:37:05,370
I felt bad asking people to not stream my coaching session.

6727
03:37:05,570 --> 03:37:06,930
Because like...

6728
03:37:06,930 --> 03:37:08,530
Like I know like the mo...

6729
03:37:08,530 --> 03:37:11,770
Like they're all like watching my coaching session VODs too.

6730
03:37:11,770 --> 03:37:12,950
But like...

6731
03:37:12,950 --> 03:37:14,430
I felt bad because they're like...

6732
03:37:14,430 --> 03:37:15,230
They need content.

6733
03:37:17,330 --> 03:37:19,230
Johnny, I want you to know I ain't watched shit.

6734
03:37:19,470 --> 03:37:20,410
I did zero...

6735
03:37:20,410 --> 03:37:21,270
No, no.

6736
03:37:21,350 --> 03:37:24,090
I know like some people actually watched my coaching sessions.

6737
03:37:24,210 --> 03:37:25,490
Even when I don't stream.

6738
03:37:25,870 --> 03:37:26,990
People were like...

6739
03:37:26,990 --> 03:37:29,910
Some of the beginners were watching like how I was being coached.

6740
03:37:31,430 --> 03:37:33,610
When I was being coached by others.

6741
03:37:33,950 --> 03:37:34,790
So like...

6742
03:37:34,790 --> 03:37:39,490
Or like the other coaches were watching it and telling them what they were being taught.

6743
03:37:39,750 --> 03:37:40,670
So like...

6744
03:37:40,670 --> 03:37:41,650
That shit like...

6745
03:37:41,650 --> 03:37:42,030
I was...

6746
03:37:42,030 --> 03:37:43,230
That shit like fucked me up.

6747
03:37:43,290 --> 03:37:43,830
I was like...

6748
03:37:43,830 --> 03:37:44,170
I was like...

6749
03:37:44,170 --> 03:37:44,290
No!

6750
03:37:44,470 --> 03:37:45,930
Stop watching me!

6751
03:37:46,730 --> 03:37:47,170
Stop!

6752
03:37:47,410 --> 03:37:50,070
Because like when I played Tekken for King.

6753
03:37:50,430 --> 03:37:54,470
I requested Brawl Pro to not stream my coach matches.

6754
03:37:54,870 --> 03:37:55,570
Because like...

6755
03:37:55,570 --> 03:37:56,690
I was also like...

6756
03:37:57,470 --> 03:37:58,070
I was like...

6757
03:37:58,070 --> 03:37:58,310
I...

6758
03:37:58,310 --> 03:37:59,210
I just want to vibe.

6759
03:37:59,470 --> 03:38:00,570
Like I want to be chill.

6760
03:38:00,930 --> 03:38:02,710
And I don't want to like...

6761
03:38:02,710 --> 03:38:07,070
I don't like really want to be like judged for...

6762
03:38:07,070 --> 03:38:09,510
Like I don't want people to analyze me because I don't know what I'm doing.

6763
03:38:09,510 --> 03:38:11,030
But like for Street Fighter.

6764
03:38:11,330 --> 03:38:12,270
I was like...

6765
03:38:12,270 --> 03:38:12,750
Okay.

6766
03:38:13,310 --> 03:38:14,230
Obviously like...

6767
03:38:14,230 --> 03:38:14,830
Content.

6768
03:38:19,330 --> 03:38:20,250
So like...

6769
03:38:20,250 --> 03:38:20,790
I was like...

6770
03:38:20,790 --> 03:38:24,430
I was okay with letting coaches stream the practices.

6771
03:38:25,190 --> 03:38:26,030
The first...

6772
03:38:26,030 --> 03:38:27,310
I remember like the first practice.

6773
03:38:27,350 --> 03:38:27,950
I was like...

6774
03:38:27,950 --> 03:38:28,750
I don't want...

6775
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:29,630
I was like...

6776
03:38:29,630 --> 03:38:30,510
Oh can we like...

6777
03:38:30,510 --> 03:38:31,390
Can I do it off stream?

6778
03:38:31,770 --> 03:38:32,670
And then...

6779
03:38:32,670 --> 03:38:33,590
And then...

6780
03:38:33,590 --> 03:38:34,890
But then the coach was like...

6781
03:38:34,890 --> 03:38:35,490
I need to sleep.

6782
03:38:35,610 --> 03:38:36,270
So I was like...

6783
03:38:36,270 --> 03:38:36,570
Okay.

6784
03:38:38,650 --> 03:38:41,070
Can you coach me after your stream?

6785
03:38:41,330 --> 03:38:41,930
But then he's like...

6786
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:42,450
I need to sleep.

6787
03:38:42,510 --> 03:38:42,890
So I was like...

6788
03:38:42,890 --> 03:38:43,270
Okay.

6789
03:38:43,350 --> 03:38:43,670
It's okay.

6790
03:38:44,830 --> 03:38:45,950
I'll be there.

6791
03:38:47,850 --> 03:38:49,490
So I'll be there when you wake up.

6792
03:38:49,890 --> 03:38:50,190
Yeah.

6793
03:38:50,650 --> 03:38:51,210
But yeah.

6794
03:38:51,410 --> 03:38:52,030
I don't know.

6795
03:38:52,330 --> 03:38:53,090
I feel bad.

6796
03:38:53,190 --> 03:38:53,870
My coach...

6797
03:38:54,730 --> 03:38:57,510
Literally sent a message into our team chat.

6798
03:38:57,610 --> 03:38:57,950
I was like...

6799
03:38:57,950 --> 03:38:58,670
Guys.

6800
03:38:58,690 --> 03:39:01,870
I want to at least get an hour a day of coaching with everyone.

6801
03:39:02,030 --> 03:39:02,950
Every single day.

6802
03:39:03,170 --> 03:39:03,570
Yeah.

6803
03:39:03,850 --> 03:39:05,170
If possible, please do that.

6804
03:39:05,270 --> 03:39:05,630
And...

6805
03:39:05,630 --> 03:39:05,870
I don't know.

6806
03:39:06,170 --> 03:39:08,770
I think I only showed up for the first day.

6807
03:39:08,930 --> 03:39:10,130
Oh my god.

6808
03:39:10,650 --> 03:39:12,050
I did zero training.

6809
03:39:13,610 --> 03:39:14,050
That's funny.

6810
03:39:14,050 --> 03:39:14,930
It's just like...

6811
03:39:15,510 --> 03:39:16,250
I don't know.

6812
03:39:16,290 --> 03:39:19,730
Because I feel like if I get too into it, I'll stress out too much.

6813
03:39:19,830 --> 03:39:20,090
Yeah.

6814
03:39:20,190 --> 03:39:20,510
Like...

6815
03:39:20,510 --> 03:39:21,650
That's what happened to me.

6816
03:39:21,770 --> 03:39:22,030
Like...

6817
03:39:22,030 --> 03:39:22,650
Yeah.

6818
03:39:22,650 --> 03:39:23,670
After like day two.

6819
03:39:23,870 --> 03:39:24,810
Like day two.

6820
03:39:25,650 --> 03:39:27,510
There was just so much pressure too.

6821
03:39:27,590 --> 03:39:28,510
Because I 5-0'd.

6822
03:39:28,730 --> 03:39:29,570
So then I was like...

6823
03:39:29,570 --> 03:39:30,090
Oh no.

6824
03:39:30,570 --> 03:39:32,770
Now it's not just 5s.

6825
03:39:33,090 --> 03:39:35,350
I was just like...

6826
03:39:35,350 --> 03:39:36,050
Oh no.

6827
03:39:36,110 --> 03:39:36,150
I was just like...

6828
03:39:36,150 --> 03:39:36,230
Oh no.

6829
03:39:36,230 --> 03:39:37,530
Now I actually have to...

6830
03:39:38,950 --> 03:39:40,150
But then like...

6831
03:39:40,150 --> 03:39:41,050
On the other hand, I was like...

6832
03:39:41,050 --> 03:39:42,510
I'm too burnt out right now.

6833
03:39:42,570 --> 03:39:43,930
I need a mental reset.

6834
03:39:44,470 --> 03:39:45,730
So then I just...

6835
03:39:45,730 --> 03:39:47,510
My mental reset won overall.

6836
03:39:47,610 --> 03:39:48,510
Instead of like...

6837
03:39:48,510 --> 03:39:49,170
Trying to...

6838
03:39:49,730 --> 03:39:50,510
Trying to...

6839
03:39:50,510 --> 03:39:51,170
Train.

6840
03:39:51,850 --> 03:39:52,330
No.

6841
03:39:52,330 --> 03:39:52,950
I felt that.

6842
03:39:52,990 --> 03:39:53,210
Like...

6843
03:39:53,210 --> 03:39:54,310
On the first day...

6844
03:39:54,310 --> 03:39:55,990
You and I both tied 3-2.

6845
03:39:56,730 --> 03:39:57,570
For like...

6846
03:39:57,570 --> 03:39:58,390
Our bracket.

6847
03:39:59,770 --> 03:40:02,750
And I was the only person who went positive on my team.

6848
03:40:02,830 --> 03:40:03,030
Yeah.

6849
03:40:03,030 --> 03:40:04,870
And everyone was so down in the dumps.

6850
03:40:04,950 --> 03:40:05,930
In team chat.

6851
03:40:05,990 --> 03:40:06,130
Yeah.

6852
03:40:06,150 --> 03:40:07,150
But they were like...

6853
03:40:07,150 --> 03:40:08,630
But you did really good, Gumi.

6854
03:40:08,710 --> 03:40:09,910
And I felt like this pressure.

6855
03:40:09,970 --> 03:40:10,210
I was like...

6856
03:40:10,210 --> 03:40:10,730
Oh my god.

6857
03:40:10,930 --> 03:40:12,770
Does this mean I have to do well next time?

6858
03:40:12,970 --> 03:40:14,190
And like...

6859
03:40:14,190 --> 03:40:14,730
You know...

6860
03:40:14,730 --> 03:40:15,250
Day 2...

6861
03:40:15,250 --> 03:40:16,390
I was kind of...

6862
03:40:16,390 --> 03:40:17,190
Gone.

6863
03:40:17,470 --> 03:40:17,870
Yeah.

6864
03:40:18,810 --> 03:40:19,550
And then...

6865
03:40:20,190 --> 03:40:21,730
I went 0-5.

6866
03:40:21,990 --> 03:40:25,230
1 and 4 only because Lily's internet went out.

6867
03:40:25,390 --> 03:40:25,570
Yeah.

6868
03:40:26,570 --> 03:40:28,370
But I went 0-5 and I was like...

6869
03:40:28,370 --> 03:40:28,910
Oh my god.

6870
03:40:29,350 --> 03:40:30,290
What the fuck.

6871
03:40:30,850 --> 03:40:31,590
And then...

6872
03:40:31,590 --> 03:40:33,050
Today I just said...

6873
03:40:33,050 --> 03:40:33,350
Fuck it.

6874
03:40:33,390 --> 03:40:34,290
I'm wearing a Blanka costume.

6875
03:40:34,790 --> 03:40:35,550
You're just like...

6876
03:40:35,550 --> 03:40:36,070
I'm vibing.

6877
03:40:36,110 --> 03:40:36,130
I'm vibing.

6878
03:40:36,150 --> 03:40:36,350
Yeah.

6879
03:40:36,810 --> 03:40:38,890
I can't even see properly with this shit on.

6880
03:40:39,010 --> 03:40:39,070
I feel like...

6881
03:40:39,070 --> 03:40:39,390
Like...

6882
03:40:39,390 --> 03:40:40,270
I just...

6883
03:40:40,270 --> 03:40:41,030
I just want to vibe.

6884
03:40:41,170 --> 03:40:41,810
That's really it.

6885
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:42,150
Like...

6886
03:40:42,870 --> 03:40:43,270
Like...

6887
03:40:43,270 --> 03:40:43,990
Um...

6888
03:40:43,990 --> 03:40:44,550
Cause like...

6889
03:40:44,550 --> 03:40:45,750
This is a pretty fun tournament too.

6890
03:40:45,870 --> 03:40:47,110
So it's more so of like...

6891
03:40:47,110 --> 03:40:48,690
Your progress overall.

6892
03:40:49,490 --> 03:40:49,890
Like...

6893
03:40:49,890 --> 03:40:50,130
Yeah.

6894
03:40:50,250 --> 03:40:50,650
Yeah.

6895
03:40:50,650 --> 03:40:51,170
And I think...

6896
03:40:51,170 --> 03:40:52,870
We both improved so much too.

6897
03:40:53,330 --> 03:40:53,730
Like...

6898
03:40:53,730 --> 03:40:54,190
None of us...

6899
03:40:54,190 --> 03:40:55,350
Both of us don't play Street Fighter.

6900
03:40:55,850 --> 03:40:56,670
And then like...

6901
03:40:56,670 --> 03:40:57,890
Both of us don't play fighting games in general.

6902
03:40:57,890 --> 03:40:57,970
Yeah.

6903
03:40:57,970 --> 03:40:58,890
We don't play fighting games.

6904
03:40:58,890 --> 03:40:59,810
We're variety streamers.

6905
03:40:59,830 --> 03:41:00,690
And we both did pretty...

6906
03:41:00,690 --> 03:41:01,210
Pretty well.

6907
03:41:06,150 --> 03:41:06,290
So...

6908
03:41:06,290 --> 03:41:07,490
We could definitely be like...

6909
03:41:07,490 --> 03:41:08,130
Obviously...

6910
03:41:08,130 --> 03:41:08,810
We could...

6911
03:41:08,810 --> 03:41:10,470
Do really, really well.

6912
03:41:10,710 --> 03:41:12,150
But it's also like...

6913
03:41:13,530 --> 03:41:14,410
I just...

6914
03:41:14,410 --> 03:41:15,690
I just want to chill sometimes.

6915
03:41:16,150 --> 03:41:16,590
Oh my god.

6916
03:41:16,590 --> 03:41:17,530
This isn't for fun.

6917
03:41:17,550 --> 03:41:17,950
You're right.

6918
03:41:18,090 --> 03:41:19,950
There is money on the line, isn't it?

6919
03:41:20,070 --> 03:41:21,490
There is money on the line.

6920
03:41:21,550 --> 03:41:21,890
Yeah.

6921
03:41:22,110 --> 03:41:22,770
That's like...

6922
03:41:22,770 --> 03:41:23,250
You know.

6923
03:41:24,890 --> 03:41:26,690
People can worry about that at TwitchCon.

6924
03:41:27,690 --> 03:41:28,130
Yeah.

6925
03:41:28,350 --> 03:41:28,930
Me, personally.

6926
03:41:29,110 --> 03:41:29,550
I'm...

6927
03:41:29,550 --> 03:41:30,390
I don't know.

6928
03:41:30,390 --> 03:41:31,190
Don't tell no one.

6929
03:41:31,190 --> 03:41:32,510
But I'm still not training.

6930
03:41:32,850 --> 03:41:34,490
I want you to know the most training I do.

6931
03:41:34,750 --> 03:41:34,890
But were you still not training?

6932
03:41:35,150 --> 03:41:35,450
Yeah.

6933
03:41:35,510 --> 03:41:35,950
No.

6934
03:41:36,010 --> 03:41:36,130
That's...

6935
03:41:36,130 --> 03:41:36,390
Like...

6936
03:41:36,390 --> 03:41:37,510
Why would I?

6937
03:41:37,530 --> 03:41:38,510
What am I gonna change?

6938
03:41:38,650 --> 03:41:39,170
I just feel like...

6939
03:41:39,170 --> 03:41:39,370
I feel like...

6940
03:41:39,370 --> 03:41:41,390
If you try too hard to...

6941
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:41,990
Like...

6942
03:41:41,990 --> 03:41:42,390
Yeah.

6943
03:41:42,390 --> 03:41:42,910
It's not just gonna...

6944
03:41:42,910 --> 03:41:44,810
It's gonna hurt even more when you lose.

6945
03:41:45,810 --> 03:41:46,250
Exactly.

6946
03:41:46,350 --> 03:41:46,610
Yeah.

6947
03:41:46,610 --> 03:41:47,550
It's like...

6948
03:41:47,550 --> 03:41:47,870
I...

6949
03:41:47,870 --> 03:41:48,590
Cause I knew.

6950
03:41:48,610 --> 03:41:49,130
I knew.

6951
03:41:49,190 --> 03:41:49,690
I was like...

6952
03:41:49,690 --> 03:41:49,930
Okay.

6953
03:41:50,250 --> 03:41:51,350
I'm not gonna be training.

6954
03:41:51,510 --> 03:41:52,510
I'm not gonna be training.

6955
03:41:52,670 --> 03:41:53,850
So then I was just like...

6956
03:41:53,850 --> 03:41:54,090
Okay.

6957
03:41:54,570 --> 03:41:55,010
Like...

6958
03:41:55,010 --> 03:41:55,890
If I lose, it's whatever.

6959
03:41:56,090 --> 03:41:57,710
If I lose, I know why I lost.

6960
03:41:57,930 --> 03:41:58,190
Like...

6961
03:41:58,190 --> 03:41:58,790
Yeah.

6962
03:41:58,810 --> 03:41:59,230
I was like...

6963
03:41:59,230 --> 03:42:00,510
I know why I lost.

6964
03:42:00,510 --> 03:42:00,990
Like...

6965
03:42:00,990 --> 03:42:01,490
I know why.

6966
03:42:01,590 --> 03:42:02,490
Cause I didn't train.

6967
03:42:02,810 --> 03:42:03,130
Like...

6968
03:42:04,110 --> 03:42:05,330
I think you and I are the same.

6969
03:42:05,530 --> 03:42:05,810
Like...

6970
03:42:05,810 --> 03:42:07,030
I knew people were gonna start...

6971
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:07,930
Labbing me.

6972
03:42:08,010 --> 03:42:08,750
But I still...

6973
03:42:08,750 --> 03:42:09,770
I kept at it.

6974
03:42:09,870 --> 03:42:10,290
Like...

6975
03:42:10,730 --> 03:42:11,390
Cause like...

6976
03:42:11,390 --> 03:42:11,590
I knew I was like...

6977
03:42:11,590 --> 03:42:12,130
I think you and I are the same.

6978
03:42:12,170 --> 03:42:13,370
Where we both like...

6979
03:42:13,370 --> 03:42:15,450
We don't care how our teams do.

6980
03:42:15,750 --> 03:42:17,170
As long as we do fine.

6981
03:42:17,610 --> 03:42:18,050
Yeah.

6982
03:42:18,910 --> 03:42:19,350
Yeah.

6983
03:42:19,550 --> 03:42:20,050
But yeah.

6984
03:42:20,130 --> 03:42:20,730
I get what you mean.

6985
03:42:21,530 --> 03:42:21,970
Yeah.

6986
03:42:22,250 --> 03:42:22,690
Yeah.

6987
03:42:22,830 --> 03:42:24,250
Cause I was just like...

6988
03:42:24,250 --> 03:42:25,490
I was just...

6989
03:42:25,490 --> 03:42:25,870
I...

6990
03:42:25,870 --> 03:42:27,150
I knew I was just...

6991
03:42:27,150 --> 03:42:27,610
If I...

6992
03:42:27,610 --> 03:42:29,650
Kept going at it yesterday...

6993
03:42:29,650 --> 03:42:30,170
I...

6994
03:42:30,510 --> 03:42:31,110
Mentally...

6995
03:42:31,110 --> 03:42:31,730
I would just be out.

6996
03:42:31,970 --> 03:42:32,210
Like...

6997
03:42:32,210 --> 03:42:32,470
I...

6998
03:42:32,470 --> 03:42:33,930
I was...

6999
03:42:33,930 --> 03:42:34,890
Mentally...

7000
03:42:34,890 --> 03:42:35,810
I was just...

7001
03:42:35,810 --> 03:42:36,690
Not...

7002
03:42:36,690 --> 03:42:37,190
Not there.

7003
03:42:37,630 --> 03:42:38,610
Cause like...

7004
03:42:38,610 --> 03:42:39,510
Even...

7005
03:42:39,510 --> 03:42:40,450
Two hours...

7006
03:42:40,450 --> 03:42:42,190
Two to three hours before...

7007
03:42:42,190 --> 03:42:43,230
Uh...

7008
03:42:43,230 --> 03:42:45,010
Before the...

7009
03:42:45,010 --> 03:42:45,550
The...

7010
03:42:45,550 --> 03:42:46,830
The tournament...

7011
03:42:47,510 --> 03:42:48,030
Um...

7012
03:42:48,030 --> 03:42:48,810
I was...

7013
03:42:48,810 --> 03:42:49,390
That...

7014
03:42:49,390 --> 03:42:50,070
That close.

7015
03:42:50,450 --> 03:42:51,130
Mentally.

7016
03:42:51,450 --> 03:42:52,190
Like...

7017
03:42:52,190 --> 03:42:53,310
Oh my god.

7018
03:42:53,390 --> 03:42:54,370
Cause I really...

7019
03:42:54,370 --> 03:42:54,830
I...

7020
03:42:54,830 --> 03:42:56,290
Uh...

7021
03:42:56,290 --> 03:42:57,210
I really...

7022
03:42:57,210 --> 03:42:58,710
I really was like...

7023
03:42:58,710 --> 03:42:58,970
I...

7024
03:42:58,970 --> 03:43:00,550
I needed more rest days...

7025
03:43:00,550 --> 03:43:01,050
In between.

7026
03:43:02,050 --> 03:43:02,530
Um...

7027
03:43:02,530 --> 03:43:03,750
I needed more...

7028
03:43:03,750 --> 03:43:04,790
Rest days in between.

7029
03:43:04,910 --> 03:43:05,230
Cause like...

7030
03:43:05,230 --> 03:43:05,710
Even like...

7031
03:43:05,710 --> 03:43:06,130
Cause like...

7032
03:43:06,130 --> 03:43:06,490
I was...

7033
03:43:06,490 --> 03:43:07,890
Fighting viewers...

7034
03:43:07,890 --> 03:43:08,470
And I was just...

7035
03:43:08,470 --> 03:43:09,330
Not having fun.

7036
03:43:09,670 --> 03:43:10,750
I was like...

7037
03:43:10,750 --> 03:43:11,270
Just...

7038
03:43:11,270 --> 03:43:12,110
It felt like I was just...

7039
03:43:12,110 --> 03:43:13,050
In a cog...

7040
03:43:13,050 --> 03:43:13,970
In the machine.

7041
03:43:14,290 --> 03:43:15,130
And I felt like...

7042
03:43:15,130 --> 03:43:16,850
If I had two rest days...

7043
03:43:16,850 --> 03:43:17,630
I would be fine.

7044
03:43:17,910 --> 03:43:19,970
But the fact that it was like...

7045
03:43:19,970 --> 03:43:21,150
Just one...

7046
03:43:21,490 --> 03:43:22,110
But then like...

7047
03:43:22,110 --> 03:43:23,330
Everybody was using that one...

7048
03:43:23,330 --> 03:43:25,010
To hard grind too...

7049
03:43:25,750 --> 03:43:26,230
And...

7050
03:43:27,630 --> 03:43:28,110
Um...

7051
03:43:28,110 --> 03:43:28,610
And then...

7052
03:43:28,610 --> 03:43:29,910
Go straight into like...

7053
03:43:29,910 --> 03:43:30,290
In the...

7054
03:43:30,290 --> 03:43:30,790
The finals.

7055
03:43:31,390 --> 03:43:31,870
Like...

7056
03:43:31,870 --> 03:43:32,590
I feel like...

7057
03:43:32,590 --> 03:43:33,790
I felt like round one...

7058
03:43:33,790 --> 03:43:34,430
Round two...

7059
03:43:34,430 --> 03:43:34,990
And then...

7060
03:43:34,990 --> 03:43:35,610
Round three...

7061
03:43:35,610 --> 03:43:36,550
Was just too much.

7062
03:43:36,550 --> 03:43:36,950
Like...

7063
03:43:36,950 --> 03:43:38,670
With one day in between...

7064
03:43:38,670 --> 03:43:39,870
It was just...

7065
03:43:39,870 --> 03:43:41,230
Too much for me.

7066
03:43:41,450 --> 03:43:42,830
I definitely needed...

7067
03:43:43,330 --> 03:43:44,070
Needed like...

7068
03:43:44,070 --> 03:43:45,030
More than one day.

7069
03:43:45,310 --> 03:43:46,550
Cause I need that one day...

7070
03:43:46,550 --> 03:43:47,670
To reset myself...

7071
03:43:47,670 --> 03:43:48,830
And then the second day...

7072
03:43:48,830 --> 03:43:50,270
To train again.

7073
03:43:51,430 --> 03:43:52,530
And like um...

7074
03:43:52,530 --> 03:43:53,650
I talked about this...

7075
03:43:53,650 --> 03:43:54,130
But like...

7076
03:43:54,130 --> 03:43:55,330
I really like...

7077
03:43:55,330 --> 03:43:56,050
Sagem Slam.

7078
03:43:56,190 --> 03:43:57,090
I think it's so fun...

7079
03:43:57,090 --> 03:43:57,650
To be a part of.

7080
03:43:57,770 --> 03:43:58,430
It's just a...

7081
03:43:58,430 --> 03:43:59,230
It's a lot...

7082
03:43:59,230 --> 03:44:00,430
For the beginners...

7083
03:44:00,970 --> 03:44:01,410
Where...

7084
03:44:01,410 --> 03:44:03,210
You're learning a whole new game...

7085
03:44:03,210 --> 03:44:03,570
Yeah...

7086
03:44:03,570 --> 03:44:04,570
Right off the bat...

7087
03:44:04,570 --> 03:44:05,450
And like...

7088
03:44:05,450 --> 03:44:07,430
You have to train non-stop...

7089
03:44:07,430 --> 03:44:08,430
And try to get like...

7090
03:44:08,430 --> 03:44:09,870
At a decent level...

7091
03:44:09,870 --> 03:44:10,610
Within one week...

7092
03:44:10,610 --> 03:44:11,790
While also participating...

7093
03:44:11,790 --> 03:44:13,230
In the round robin days...

7094
03:44:13,230 --> 03:44:13,330
Yeah...

7095
03:44:13,330 --> 03:44:14,390
Somebody was saying like...

7096
03:44:14,390 --> 03:44:14,750
I should...

7097
03:44:14,750 --> 03:44:15,930
Join a less serious tournament...

7098
03:44:15,930 --> 03:44:17,290
We didn't know there was prize money...

7099
03:44:17,290 --> 03:44:18,210
Until we got...

7100
03:44:18,210 --> 03:44:18,450
Accepted...

7101
03:44:19,110 --> 03:44:20,570
And then teams were out...

7102
03:44:20,570 --> 03:44:20,630
Yeah...

7103
03:44:20,630 --> 03:44:22,470
We didn't know there was prize money involved...

7104
03:44:22,470 --> 03:44:24,130
We literally found out...

7105
03:44:24,130 --> 03:44:24,870
After...

7106
03:44:24,870 --> 03:44:25,990
The whole system...

7107
03:44:25,990 --> 03:44:26,190
Like...

7108
03:44:26,190 --> 03:44:27,470
Everything was established...

7109
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:28,330
And then...

7110
03:44:28,330 --> 03:44:29,190
Uh...

7111
03:44:29,190 --> 03:44:30,010
Cause we thought it was...

7112
03:44:30,010 --> 03:44:31,130
The previous...

7113
03:44:31,130 --> 03:44:32,130
Sajam slams...

7114
03:44:32,130 --> 03:44:33,610
Had no prize money involved...

7115
03:44:33,930 --> 03:44:34,210
Yeah...

7116
03:44:34,210 --> 03:44:34,510
It was like...

7117
03:44:34,510 --> 03:44:35,690
For fun type deal...

7118
03:44:35,690 --> 03:44:36,690
And like...

7119
03:44:36,690 --> 03:44:37,590
Prize money...

7120
03:44:37,590 --> 03:44:38,690
Got added in...

7121
03:44:38,690 --> 03:44:39,450
At the last...

7122
03:44:39,450 --> 03:44:39,990
Minute...

7123
03:44:39,990 --> 03:44:41,230
Before like...

7124
03:44:41,230 --> 03:44:41,750
Uh...

7125
03:44:41,750 --> 03:44:42,490
So like...

7126
03:44:42,490 --> 03:44:43,930
If I knew that...

7127
03:44:43,930 --> 03:44:45,150
It was that serious...

7128
03:44:45,150 --> 03:44:46,510
I also wouldn't participate...

7129
03:44:46,510 --> 03:44:47,370
Because like...

7130
03:44:47,370 --> 03:44:48,670
The fact that like...

7131
03:44:48,670 --> 03:44:49,130
Car...

7132
03:44:49,130 --> 03:44:49,370
Like...

7133
03:44:49,370 --> 03:44:50,330
A lot of money...

7134
03:44:50,330 --> 03:44:51,510
Is involved too...

7135
03:44:51,510 --> 03:44:52,530
So like...

7136
03:44:52,530 --> 03:44:53,990
I felt like...

7137
03:44:53,990 --> 03:44:55,530
I wouldn't say I wouldn't participate...

7138
03:44:55,530 --> 03:44:57,130
But I would have changed my mindset...

7139
03:44:57,130 --> 03:44:58,050
Going in...

7140
03:44:58,330 --> 03:44:58,670
Oh yeah...

7141
03:44:59,270 --> 03:44:59,590
Like...

7142
03:44:59,590 --> 03:44:59,750
Well...

7143
03:44:59,750 --> 03:45:00,750
If I knew it was like...

7144
03:45:00,750 --> 03:45:02,290
Lots of money involved...

7145
03:45:02,290 --> 03:45:03,230
I would have...

7146
03:45:03,230 --> 03:45:04,710
Changed my mindset...

7147
03:45:04,710 --> 03:45:06,610
Going into this tournament...

7148
03:45:06,610 --> 03:45:07,430
Um...

7149
03:45:08,270 --> 03:45:08,590
Sorry...

7150
03:45:08,910 --> 03:45:10,190
He's like...

7151
03:45:10,190 --> 03:45:10,510
Madge...

7152
03:45:11,730 --> 03:45:12,570
So yeah...

7153
03:45:12,570 --> 03:45:12,750
Like...

7154
03:45:12,750 --> 03:45:13,390
I didn't know...

7155
03:45:13,390 --> 03:45:14,050
Like...

7156
03:45:14,050 --> 03:45:14,390
Gumi...

7157
03:45:14,390 --> 03:45:14,550
Like...

7158
03:45:14,550 --> 03:45:15,070
None of us knew...

7159
03:45:15,070 --> 03:45:15,710
There was prize money...

7160
03:45:15,710 --> 03:45:16,170
Until...

7161
03:45:16,170 --> 03:45:17,110
Everything...

7162
03:45:17,110 --> 03:45:18,230
Everybody was in...

7163
03:45:18,230 --> 03:45:20,310
Teams were already established...

7164
03:45:20,310 --> 03:45:20,750
Uh...

7165
03:45:20,750 --> 03:45:21,830
And then they announced that...

7166
03:45:21,830 --> 03:45:23,070
There was a 50k...

7167
03:45:23,070 --> 03:45:24,550
Prize money...

7168
03:45:25,610 --> 03:45:26,630
I mean...

7169
03:45:26,630 --> 03:45:27,650
I knew there was...

7170
03:45:27,650 --> 03:45:28,470
50k prize money...

7171
03:45:28,470 --> 03:45:28,730
I'd be like...

7172
03:45:28,730 --> 03:45:28,990
Seija...

7173
03:45:28,990 --> 03:45:29,970
Put me in the best team...

7174
03:45:29,970 --> 03:45:30,250
No...

7175
03:45:30,250 --> 03:45:30,850
I'm joking...

7176
03:45:32,290 --> 03:45:33,570
I would have done...

7177
03:45:33,570 --> 03:45:35,630
Put a team together...

7178
03:45:37,310 --> 03:45:37,630
Uh...

7179
03:45:37,630 --> 03:45:38,570
Nephew...

7180
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:39,730
Me...

7181
03:45:39,730 --> 03:45:40,510
Um...

7182
03:45:40,510 --> 03:45:42,170
Can we somehow include...

7183
03:45:42,170 --> 03:45:42,930
The other coaches...

7184
03:45:42,930 --> 03:45:43,970
On my team...

7185
03:45:46,350 --> 03:45:47,390
I'd be like...

7186
03:45:47,390 --> 03:45:48,090
Hey...

7187
03:45:48,090 --> 03:45:49,050
I like to have...

7188
03:45:49,050 --> 03:45:50,910
Who's the highest ranked coach...

7189
03:45:50,910 --> 03:45:52,590
I would like to request...

7190
03:45:52,590 --> 03:45:53,890
For that coach...

7191
03:45:55,210 --> 03:45:56,290
I literally...

7192
03:45:56,290 --> 03:45:56,610
Request...

7193
03:45:56,610 --> 03:45:57,510
Brian...

7194
03:45:57,510 --> 03:45:58,050
Because...

7195
03:45:58,390 --> 03:45:59,350
People were telling me...

7196
03:45:59,350 --> 03:46:00,310
Brian was like...

7197
03:46:00,310 --> 03:46:00,890
Vibey...

7198
03:46:00,890 --> 03:46:02,030
And he didn't take it...

7199
03:46:02,030 --> 03:46:02,990
Super seriously...

7200
03:46:03,470 --> 03:46:04,030
So like...

7201
03:46:04,030 --> 03:46:04,950
That's why I requested...

7202
03:46:04,950 --> 03:46:05,470
Brian...

7203
03:46:05,470 --> 03:46:06,070
I was just like...

7204
03:46:06,070 --> 03:46:07,530
I wanted a coach that vibes...

7205
03:46:07,530 --> 03:46:07,930
And...

7206
03:46:07,930 --> 03:46:08,750
People were telling me...

7207
03:46:08,750 --> 03:46:09,210
Like...

7208
03:46:09,210 --> 03:46:10,610
It was either Daya...

7209
03:46:10,610 --> 03:46:11,190
Or Brian...

7210
03:46:11,190 --> 03:46:11,690
That were like...

7211
03:46:11,690 --> 03:46:12,570
Super vibey...

7212
03:46:12,570 --> 03:46:13,810
So then I was like...

7213
03:46:13,810 --> 03:46:14,110
Okay...

7214
03:46:14,110 --> 03:46:14,330
I'll...

7215
03:46:14,330 --> 03:46:15,050
I'll get...

7216
03:46:15,050 --> 03:46:15,870
Brian...

7217
03:46:15,870 --> 03:46:16,410
Then...

7218
03:46:16,950 --> 03:46:17,470
Um...

7219
03:46:17,470 --> 03:46:19,330
And then Daya was like...

7220
03:46:19,330 --> 03:46:19,950
My...

7221
03:46:19,950 --> 03:46:20,590
Uh...

7222
03:46:20,590 --> 03:46:22,310
My second choice...

7223
03:46:22,910 --> 03:46:23,470
Oh...

7224
03:46:23,470 --> 03:46:24,150
Mine was...

7225
03:46:24,150 --> 03:46:24,410
Um...

7226
03:46:24,410 --> 03:46:25,470
Nephew...

7227
03:46:25,470 --> 03:46:26,070
Because I...

7228
03:46:26,070 --> 03:46:27,890
Got coached by him...

7229
03:46:27,890 --> 03:46:28,470
Before the...

7230
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:29,030
Slam...

7231
03:46:29,030 --> 03:46:29,490
Even like...

7232
03:46:29,490 --> 03:46:30,050
Started...

7233
03:46:30,050 --> 03:46:31,850
And then...

7234
03:46:31,850 --> 03:46:33,450
The other one was JB...

7235
03:46:33,450 --> 03:46:35,270
Just because I liked his Discord icon...

7236
03:46:36,410 --> 03:46:37,530
That's funny...

7237
03:46:37,530 --> 03:46:38,410
Like...

7238
03:46:38,410 --> 03:46:39,570
I did zero research...

7239
03:46:39,570 --> 03:46:39,730
I...

7240
03:46:39,730 --> 03:46:41,510
It's because I was going to play Juri...

7241
03:46:41,510 --> 03:46:42,650
But then Seijum said...

7242
03:46:42,650 --> 03:46:43,490
Oh yeah...

7243
03:46:43,490 --> 03:46:44,170
The yo...

7244
03:46:44,170 --> 03:46:46,270
The most Yoshimitsu-like character...

7245
03:46:46,270 --> 03:46:47,370
In Street Fighter...

7246
03:46:47,370 --> 03:46:48,210
Is probably Blanka...

7247
03:46:48,210 --> 03:46:48,930
And then I just swapped...

7248
03:46:48,930 --> 03:46:49,570
Immediately...

7249
03:46:50,790 --> 03:46:51,310
Yeah...

7250
03:46:51,310 --> 03:46:52,630
And Blanka was like...

7251
03:46:52,630 --> 03:46:53,830
My counter pick...

7252
03:46:53,830 --> 03:46:54,570
For Gief...

7253
03:46:54,570 --> 03:46:55,210
Like...

7254
03:46:55,210 --> 03:46:55,630
It...

7255
03:46:55,630 --> 03:46:56,450
Apparently...

7256
03:46:57,230 --> 03:46:58,410
Blanka and Lily...

7257
03:46:58,410 --> 03:46:58,990
Were both like...

7258
03:46:58,990 --> 03:46:59,750
Hard to count...

7259
03:46:59,750 --> 03:46:59,970
Like...

7260
03:46:59,970 --> 03:47:01,130
Hard to play against...

7261
03:47:01,130 --> 03:47:02,430
For Gief...

7262
03:47:02,430 --> 03:47:02,990
Uh...

7263
03:47:02,990 --> 03:47:04,090
I don't know...

7264
03:47:04,090 --> 03:47:04,410
Man...

7265
03:47:04,410 --> 03:47:04,750
I just...

7266
03:47:04,750 --> 03:47:05,650
That's what I was told...

7267
03:47:05,650 --> 03:47:06,190
That was...

7268
03:47:06,190 --> 03:47:07,950
One of the hardest matchups...

7269
03:47:07,950 --> 03:47:08,710
Because you guys have range...

7270
03:47:08,710 --> 03:47:10,650
I just like the way Blanka shakes ass...

7271
03:47:14,970 --> 03:47:16,010
But yeah...

7272
03:47:16,010 --> 03:47:16,410
Like...

7273
03:47:16,410 --> 03:47:17,590
It was a good experience...

7274
03:47:17,590 --> 03:47:18,010
I don't...

7275
03:47:18,010 --> 03:47:18,910
I don't know...

7276
03:47:18,910 --> 03:47:19,250
Like...

7277
03:47:19,830 --> 03:47:20,350
Uh...

7278
03:47:21,110 --> 03:47:21,590
I...

7279
03:47:21,590 --> 03:47:22,050
I don't...

7280
03:47:22,050 --> 03:47:22,750
I don't know...

7281
03:47:22,750 --> 03:47:22,990
Like...

7282
03:47:22,990 --> 03:47:23,590
For like...

7283
03:47:25,090 --> 03:47:26,650
I think people should know...

7284
03:47:26,650 --> 03:47:27,110
For me...

7285
03:47:27,110 --> 03:47:27,490
That...

7286
03:47:27,490 --> 03:47:29,010
I do these tournaments...

7287
03:47:29,010 --> 03:47:29,410
Not...

7288
03:47:29,410 --> 03:47:30,530
To like...

7289
03:47:30,530 --> 03:47:31,350
Not like...

7290
03:47:31,350 --> 03:47:31,710
Not saying...

7291
03:47:31,710 --> 03:47:31,870
Oh...

7292
03:47:31,870 --> 03:47:32,390
Not to win...

7293
03:47:32,390 --> 03:47:32,790
But like...

7294
03:47:32,790 --> 03:47:34,010
I do these tournaments...

7295
03:47:34,010 --> 03:47:35,030
To have fun...

7296
03:47:35,030 --> 03:47:36,890
Especially games that like...

7297
03:47:36,890 --> 03:47:37,870
I don't play...

7298
03:47:38,650 --> 03:47:39,130
And...

7299
03:47:39,130 --> 03:47:39,990
I had fun...

7300
03:47:39,990 --> 03:47:40,810
In the end...

7301
03:47:40,810 --> 03:47:41,970
I had fun...

7302
03:47:41,970 --> 03:47:42,470
Um...

7303
03:47:42,470 --> 03:47:43,890
I like meeting new people...

7304
03:47:43,890 --> 03:47:44,510
Sometimes...

7305
03:47:44,510 --> 03:47:45,370
I know like...

7306
03:47:45,370 --> 03:47:46,110
I said like...

7307
03:47:46,110 --> 03:47:46,570
I...

7308
03:47:46,570 --> 03:47:48,590
Was scared of meeting new people...

7309
03:47:49,110 --> 03:47:49,550
Um...

7310
03:47:50,350 --> 03:47:50,790
But...

7311
03:47:50,790 --> 03:47:52,610
When you do end up meeting new people...

7312
03:47:52,610 --> 03:47:53,890
And if you vibe with them...

7313
03:47:53,890 --> 03:47:55,550
Then it's always a good time...

7314
03:47:55,550 --> 03:47:56,370
Um...

7315
03:47:56,890 --> 03:47:57,330
Yeah...

7316
03:47:57,910 --> 03:47:58,750
And like...

7317
03:47:58,750 --> 03:47:59,190
I know like...

7318
03:47:59,190 --> 03:47:59,590
People are like...

7319
03:47:59,590 --> 03:47:59,770
Oh...

7320
03:47:59,770 --> 03:47:59,950
You...

7321
03:47:59,950 --> 03:48:01,030
You needed to be like...

7322
03:48:01,030 --> 03:48:01,910
Super tri-high...

7323
03:48:01,910 --> 03:48:02,550
For your team...

7324
03:48:02,550 --> 03:48:03,290
And everything...

7325
03:48:03,830 --> 03:48:04,270
Um...

7326
03:48:04,270 --> 03:48:04,970
I did...

7327
03:48:04,970 --> 03:48:05,150
I...

7328
03:48:05,150 --> 03:48:06,230
I learned a lot...

7329
03:48:06,230 --> 03:48:07,210
For the first two days...

7330
03:48:07,210 --> 03:48:08,130
But I knew that...

7331
03:48:08,130 --> 03:48:08,970
For me...

7332
03:48:08,970 --> 03:48:10,470
I had to like...

7333
03:48:10,970 --> 03:48:12,410
Mentally reset myself...

7334
03:48:12,410 --> 03:48:13,690
Before the finals...

7335
03:48:15,110 --> 03:48:16,090
Because at that point...

7336
03:48:16,090 --> 03:48:16,750
I was like...

7337
03:48:16,750 --> 03:48:17,870
I was like...

7338
03:48:17,870 --> 03:48:18,930
Mad...

7339
03:48:18,930 --> 03:48:19,390
And like...

7340
03:48:19,950 --> 03:48:20,230
Tired...

7341
03:48:20,230 --> 03:48:20,490
And...

7342
03:48:20,490 --> 03:48:22,330
Felt like a cog in the machine...

7343
03:48:24,070 --> 03:48:24,350
Yeah...

7344
03:48:26,310 --> 03:48:26,870
Yeah...

7345
03:48:27,470 --> 03:48:28,030
Sorry...

7346
03:48:28,030 --> 03:48:29,150
My dog is...

7347
03:48:30,010 --> 03:48:31,390
He wants food...

7348
03:48:31,390 --> 03:48:32,270
I'm gonna feed him...

7349
03:48:32,270 --> 03:48:33,450
After this stream...

7350
03:48:33,450 --> 03:48:34,330
Wait...

7351
03:48:34,330 --> 03:48:34,690
Oh...

7352
03:48:34,690 --> 03:48:36,350
Kazi almost needs food too...

7353
03:48:36,350 --> 03:48:36,550
Yeah...

7354
03:48:36,550 --> 03:48:37,750
It's almost his feeding time...

7355
03:48:37,750 --> 03:48:38,450
Yeah...

7356
03:48:39,470 --> 03:48:40,650
Did you have fun...

7357
03:48:40,650 --> 03:48:41,150
Gumi?

7358
03:48:42,890 --> 03:48:44,810
I'll be so honest with you...

7359
03:48:44,810 --> 03:48:45,930
The most coaching I've done...

7360
03:48:45,930 --> 03:48:46,070
Is...

7361
03:48:46,070 --> 03:48:46,250
Like...

7362
03:48:46,250 --> 03:48:47,230
30 minutes before...

7363
03:48:47,230 --> 03:48:48,370
Each training day...

7364
03:48:49,070 --> 03:48:49,410
Like...

7365
03:48:49,410 --> 03:48:50,230
They just say...

7366
03:48:50,230 --> 03:48:50,710
Gumi...

7367
03:48:50,710 --> 03:48:52,170
I'm going to want you to...

7368
03:48:52,170 --> 03:48:53,070
Look at this...

7369
03:48:53,070 --> 03:48:54,210
Do this...

7370
03:48:54,850 --> 03:48:55,710
And I'm like...

7371
03:48:55,710 --> 03:48:56,250
Okay...

7372
03:48:56,250 --> 03:48:57,610
And then I do it...

7373
03:48:57,610 --> 03:48:59,330
And that's it...

7374
03:48:59,330 --> 03:49:00,570
I'll let him in...

7375
03:49:00,570 --> 03:49:01,530
Because he's gonna...

7376
03:49:01,530 --> 03:49:02,590
He just wants to...

7377
03:49:02,590 --> 03:49:04,110
Hang out for a little bit...

7378
03:49:04,110 --> 03:49:04,630
Alright...

7379
03:49:04,630 --> 03:49:04,970
What do you want?

7380
03:49:05,070 --> 03:49:05,350
Aw...

7381
03:49:06,710 --> 03:49:07,250
Nice...

7382
03:49:07,250 --> 03:49:08,150
As long as you didn't...

7383
03:49:08,150 --> 03:49:09,290
Burn yourself out...

7384
03:49:09,850 --> 03:49:10,390
That's...

7385
03:49:10,390 --> 03:49:10,890
I know...

7386
03:49:10,890 --> 03:49:11,530
I'm doing literally...

7387
03:49:11,530 --> 03:49:12,430
The opposite...

7388
03:49:13,070 --> 03:49:13,930
That's good...

7389
03:49:13,930 --> 03:49:14,890
Because like...

7390
03:49:14,890 --> 03:49:15,630
During Tekken...

7391
03:49:15,630 --> 03:49:16,010
I didn't...

7392
03:49:16,630 --> 03:49:17,730
I don't think I trained...

7393
03:49:17,730 --> 03:49:18,590
That much for Tekken...

7394
03:49:19,570 --> 03:49:19,970
Um...

7395
03:49:20,550 --> 03:49:21,710
I just played rank...

7396
03:49:21,710 --> 03:49:22,970
Most of the time...

7397
03:49:22,970 --> 03:49:23,790
I just played rank...

7398
03:49:23,790 --> 03:49:25,030
And just did the same combos...

7399
03:49:25,030 --> 03:49:26,150
Over and over again...

7400
03:49:26,830 --> 03:49:27,630
I trained...

7401
03:49:29,090 --> 03:49:29,490
More...

7402
03:49:30,070 --> 03:49:30,470
For...

7403
03:49:31,470 --> 03:49:31,870
This...

7404
03:49:31,870 --> 03:49:33,290
Than I did for Tekken...

7405
03:49:33,290 --> 03:49:34,830
Because it was so much more serious...

7406
03:49:34,830 --> 03:49:36,330
Because of the money too...

7407
03:49:37,130 --> 03:49:37,530
Um...

7408
03:49:37,530 --> 03:49:38,190
But then like...

7409
03:49:38,190 --> 03:49:38,510
You know...

7410
03:49:38,510 --> 03:49:38,670
Like...

7411
03:49:38,670 --> 03:49:39,410
At that point...

7412
03:49:39,410 --> 03:49:39,590
Like...

7413
03:49:39,590 --> 03:49:40,330
On the third...

7414
03:49:40,330 --> 03:49:40,690
That's...

7415
03:49:40,690 --> 03:49:42,270
The day before the finals...

7416
03:49:42,270 --> 03:49:42,650
I was like...

7417
03:49:42,650 --> 03:49:44,050
I can't keep training anymore...

7418
03:49:44,050 --> 03:49:44,150
Yeah...

7419
03:49:44,150 --> 03:49:44,330
Like...

7420
03:49:44,330 --> 03:49:44,810
Like...

7421
03:49:44,810 --> 03:49:45,890
You know...

7422
03:49:47,450 --> 03:49:49,830
My team and I were joking about a script...

7423
03:49:49,830 --> 03:49:50,610
But did you know...

7424
03:49:50,610 --> 03:49:50,790
Yeah...

7425
03:49:50,790 --> 03:49:52,150
The way our matches went...

7426
03:49:52,150 --> 03:49:52,830
How?

7427
03:49:52,830 --> 03:49:53,290
This one...

7428
03:49:53,290 --> 03:49:54,790
Went the exact same way...

7429
03:49:54,790 --> 03:49:55,590
As last...

7430
03:49:55,590 --> 03:49:55,990
Um...

7431
03:49:56,550 --> 03:49:56,990
Slam...

7432
03:49:56,990 --> 03:49:57,450
Oh...

7433
03:49:57,450 --> 03:49:58,710
Where I won the first day...

7434
03:49:58,710 --> 03:49:59,730
You won the second day...

7435
03:49:59,730 --> 03:50:00,810
And I won on the third day...

7436
03:50:00,810 --> 03:50:01,930
That's funny...

7437
03:50:01,930 --> 03:50:02,770
That's funny...

7438
03:50:02,770 --> 03:50:03,090
It's like...

7439
03:50:03,090 --> 03:50:03,990
It's like...

7440
03:50:03,990 --> 03:50:05,270
Where Romeo and Juliet...

7441
03:50:06,330 --> 03:50:06,890
It's like...

7442
03:50:06,890 --> 03:50:07,330
Fated to be...

7443
03:50:07,330 --> 03:50:08,590
We can't be on the same team...

7444
03:50:08,590 --> 03:50:09,990
Because we're always in the beginner...

7445
03:50:09,990 --> 03:50:11,250
I know...

7446
03:50:11,250 --> 03:50:12,130
Unless you're playing...

7447
03:50:12,130 --> 03:50:13,830
Unless you want to play a division update...

7448
03:50:13,830 --> 03:50:14,150
I know...

7449
03:50:14,150 --> 03:50:14,530
Let's...

7450
03:50:15,210 --> 03:50:15,470
Let's...

7451
03:50:15,470 --> 03:50:17,730
Let's ask Seijam to make a Splatoon tournament...

7452
03:50:17,730 --> 03:50:18,430
No...

7453
03:50:18,430 --> 03:50:19,210
No...

7454
03:50:19,210 --> 03:50:19,630
No...

7455
03:50:19,630 --> 03:50:20,070
I can't...

7456
03:50:20,070 --> 03:50:21,290
I cannot do that...

7457
03:50:21,290 --> 03:50:21,730
I can't...

7458
03:50:21,730 --> 03:50:22,330
I...

7459
03:50:22,330 --> 03:50:23,330
I'd cry...

7460
03:50:23,330 --> 03:50:23,850
I think...

7461
03:50:23,850 --> 03:50:25,690
I think most likely the next tournament...

7462
03:50:25,690 --> 03:50:27,190
Would probably be...

7463
03:50:27,190 --> 03:50:27,770
Or like...

7464
03:50:27,770 --> 03:50:30,530
I'm pretty sure Seijam's gonna host a 2xKO tournament...

7465
03:50:30,530 --> 03:50:31,750
I'm pretty sure...

7466
03:50:31,750 --> 03:50:32,050
He's gonna...

7467
03:50:32,050 --> 03:50:32,310
Yeah...

7468
03:50:32,310 --> 03:50:33,630
I heard from...

7469
03:50:34,010 --> 03:50:34,270
Uh...

7470
03:50:34,270 --> 03:50:34,670
I heard...

7471
03:50:34,670 --> 03:50:34,930
Okay...

7472
03:50:34,930 --> 03:50:35,230
I should...

7473
03:50:35,230 --> 03:50:35,850
No leaks...

7474
03:50:35,850 --> 03:50:36,470
Nevermind...

7475
03:50:36,470 --> 03:50:36,750
Um...

7476
03:50:36,750 --> 03:50:37,650
I don't know...

7477
03:50:37,650 --> 03:50:38,890
It's like up in the air...

7478
03:50:38,890 --> 03:50:40,030
It's up in the air...

7479
03:50:40,030 --> 03:50:40,350
It's like...

7480
03:50:41,250 --> 03:50:43,270
It's up in the air...

7481
03:50:43,270 --> 03:50:43,790
Uh...

7482
03:50:43,790 --> 03:50:47,170
I don't know if I want to do 2xKO...

7483
03:50:47,170 --> 03:50:49,310
I tried it...

7484
03:50:49,310 --> 03:50:50,030
Oh yeah...

7485
03:50:50,030 --> 03:50:50,830
I tried it too...

7486
03:50:50,830 --> 03:50:52,430
I tried it too...

7487
03:50:52,430 --> 03:50:53,310
Uh...

7488
03:50:53,310 --> 03:50:53,710
Yeah...

7489
03:50:53,710 --> 03:50:55,450
I tried it at EVO...

7490
03:50:55,450 --> 03:50:56,130
Um...

7491
03:50:56,130 --> 03:50:56,610
Yeah...

7492
03:50:56,610 --> 03:50:58,570
And that was pretty fun...

7493
03:50:58,570 --> 03:50:59,050
And I...

7494
03:50:59,770 --> 03:51:01,750
What if we can duo together?

7495
03:51:02,230 --> 03:51:03,530
You want to tag in?

7496
03:51:03,590 --> 03:51:04,190
Tag team?

7497
03:51:04,330 --> 03:51:04,710
Yeah...

7498
03:51:05,410 --> 03:51:05,970
Yeah...

7499
03:51:05,970 --> 03:51:06,450
Yeah...

7500
03:51:06,470 --> 03:51:07,610
For Sajam Slam?

7501
03:51:08,390 --> 03:51:09,350
For Sajam Slam...

7502
03:51:09,350 --> 03:51:09,590
Yeah...

7503
03:51:09,590 --> 03:51:10,510
I said like...

7504
03:51:12,610 --> 03:51:13,090
Um...

7505
03:51:13,090 --> 03:51:14,310
I don't know...

7506
03:51:14,310 --> 03:51:14,510
Like...

7507
03:51:14,510 --> 03:51:15,250
I don't know...

7508
03:51:15,250 --> 03:51:15,770
I don't...

7509
03:51:15,770 --> 03:51:16,190
Cause like...

7510
03:51:16,190 --> 03:51:16,550
I don't...

7511
03:51:16,550 --> 03:51:17,690
Depends on like...

7512
03:51:17,690 --> 03:51:19,050
Who's in it too...

7513
03:51:19,050 --> 03:51:20,150
Cause like I said like...

7514
03:51:20,150 --> 03:51:21,030
If a lot of...

7515
03:51:21,030 --> 03:51:21,290
Yeah...

7516
03:51:21,290 --> 03:51:21,590
I...

7517
03:51:21,590 --> 03:51:24,550
I don't want to be put on a team that's...

7518
03:51:24,550 --> 03:51:28,690
I said totally this in my chat but I don't want to be put on a team that's like super serious and that...

7519
03:51:28,690 --> 03:51:29,430
Like...

7520
03:51:29,430 --> 03:51:32,710
I just don't want a super duper serious team...

7521
03:51:32,710 --> 03:51:33,650
Um...

7522
03:51:33,650 --> 03:51:34,070
Yeah...

7523
03:51:34,070 --> 03:51:35,670
So it really depends if...

7524
03:51:35,670 --> 03:51:36,810
I know...

7525
03:51:36,810 --> 03:51:37,470
Who's...

7526
03:51:37,470 --> 03:51:38,710
Gonna be joining...

7527
03:51:39,510 --> 03:51:40,390
Because like...

7528
03:51:40,390 --> 03:51:40,910
Um...

7529
03:51:40,910 --> 03:51:42,790
I know like there were people...

7530
03:51:42,790 --> 03:51:46,470
That was supposed to be in this Sajam Slam that dropped out because they were like...

7531
03:51:46,470 --> 03:51:46,970
Oh...

7532
03:51:46,970 --> 03:51:47,870
I don't...

7533
03:51:48,490 --> 03:51:48,710
Know...

7534
03:51:48,710 --> 03:51:50,110
I don't know who's like...

7535
03:51:50,110 --> 03:51:52,030
I don't know these people so I'm gonna drop out...

7536
03:51:52,030 --> 03:51:52,490
Like...

7537
03:51:52,490 --> 03:51:53,050
They're like...

7538
03:51:53,050 --> 03:51:53,670
I don't know if they're...

7539
03:51:53,670 --> 03:51:54,850
We're gonna have the vibes...

7540
03:51:55,950 --> 03:51:56,610
So like...

7541
03:51:56,610 --> 03:51:57,350
It just depends...

7542
03:51:57,350 --> 03:51:57,810
Honestly...

7543
03:51:57,810 --> 03:51:58,390
On like...

7544
03:51:58,390 --> 03:52:00,750
Who's gonna be in the next Sajam Slam...

7545
03:52:00,750 --> 03:52:01,990
That depends...

7546
03:52:01,990 --> 03:52:05,110
If I'm gonna be joining the next one...

7547
03:52:05,110 --> 03:52:05,650
Yeah...

7548
03:52:06,890 --> 03:52:07,370
I...

7549
03:52:07,370 --> 03:52:07,810
I get...

7550
03:52:07,810 --> 03:52:09,070
I get what you mean because...

7551
03:52:09,070 --> 03:52:09,890
I don't know...

7552
03:52:09,890 --> 03:52:10,290
I...

7553
03:52:10,290 --> 03:52:10,910
I can't...

7554
03:52:11,510 --> 03:52:15,930
I don't think in any tournament ever I want to be on a team that's too try-hard and like...

7555
03:52:15,930 --> 03:52:16,550
Yeah...

7556
03:52:16,550 --> 03:52:18,490
Would get genuinely upset if you didn't do well...

7557
03:52:18,490 --> 03:52:18,770
Yeah...

7558
03:52:18,770 --> 03:52:20,750
That's what I'm also scared of...

7559
03:52:20,750 --> 03:52:21,370
I don't want to...

7560
03:52:21,370 --> 03:52:23,430
People to be upset at me...

7561
03:52:24,170 --> 03:52:25,110
I don't want...

7562
03:52:25,110 --> 03:52:25,350
Me...

7563
03:52:25,350 --> 03:52:26,310
Yeah...

7564
03:52:26,310 --> 03:52:26,770
Like...

7565
03:52:26,770 --> 03:52:27,030
If...

7566
03:52:27,030 --> 03:52:27,450
Cause like...

7567
03:52:27,450 --> 03:52:28,130
Today...

7568
03:52:28,130 --> 03:52:29,210
When I was playing...

7569
03:52:29,210 --> 03:52:29,430
When...

7570
03:52:29,430 --> 03:52:31,690
When everybody got quiet and serious...

7571
03:52:32,250 --> 03:52:32,730
It...

7572
03:52:32,730 --> 03:52:34,290
It made me like...

7573
03:52:34,290 --> 03:52:35,570
More nervous...

7574
03:52:36,110 --> 03:52:36,590
Too...

7575
03:52:36,590 --> 03:52:37,830
So like...

7576
03:52:37,830 --> 03:52:38,090
I...

7577
03:52:38,090 --> 03:52:38,590
I...

7578
03:52:38,590 --> 03:52:39,810
I just didn't like that...

7579
03:52:39,810 --> 03:52:40,050
Like...

7580
03:52:40,050 --> 03:52:40,670
I didn't like...

7581
03:52:40,670 --> 03:52:42,410
Those types of vibes...

7582
03:52:42,410 --> 03:52:43,090
And then like...

7583
03:52:43,090 --> 03:52:43,790
After I said like...

7584
03:52:43,790 --> 03:52:44,470
Oh I don't like that...

7585
03:52:44,470 --> 03:52:44,990
Then people...

7586
03:52:44,990 --> 03:52:45,470
They're all like...

7587
03:52:45,470 --> 03:52:46,190
Okay...

7588
03:52:46,190 --> 03:52:46,710
Well...

7589
03:52:46,710 --> 03:52:49,250
Then everybody started relaxing a lot more...

7590
03:52:49,250 --> 03:52:50,530
Which was nice...

7591
03:52:50,530 --> 03:52:51,350
Oh...

7592
03:52:52,170 --> 03:52:53,250
Cause I was like...

7593
03:52:53,250 --> 03:52:53,450
I should...

7594
03:52:53,450 --> 03:52:53,830
I was like...

7595
03:52:53,830 --> 03:52:54,970
I cannot deal...

7596
03:52:54,970 --> 03:52:56,290
I cannot play like that...

7597
03:52:56,290 --> 03:52:56,510
Like...

7598
03:52:56,510 --> 03:52:58,810
And then it was nice...

7599
03:52:58,810 --> 03:53:00,410
The people have started...

7600
03:53:00,410 --> 03:53:00,830
Uh...

7601
03:53:00,830 --> 03:53:03,130
Being more relaxed about it...

7602
03:53:03,130 --> 03:53:03,670
And...

7603
03:53:03,670 --> 03:53:03,970
Like...

7604
03:53:03,970 --> 03:53:04,330
You know...

7605
03:53:04,330 --> 03:53:05,210
Crack...

7606
03:53:05,210 --> 03:53:05,650
Like not...

7607
03:53:05,650 --> 03:53:05,930
Uh...

7608
03:53:05,930 --> 03:53:06,610
Like...

7609
03:53:06,610 --> 03:53:08,330
Making it more relaxed...

7610
03:53:08,330 --> 03:53:08,910
And more...

7611
03:53:08,910 --> 03:53:09,950
Uh...

7612
03:53:09,950 --> 03:53:11,350
Lighthearted...

7613
03:53:11,350 --> 03:53:11,870
Like...

7614
03:53:11,870 --> 03:53:12,690
It felt like...

7615
03:53:12,690 --> 03:53:13,690
Less...

7616
03:53:13,690 --> 03:53:14,570
Uh...

7617
03:53:15,590 --> 03:53:16,430
Less...

7618
03:53:16,430 --> 03:53:17,790
Pressure in general...

7619
03:53:17,790 --> 03:53:19,430
To perform better...

7620
03:53:19,430 --> 03:53:20,390
Um...

7621
03:53:20,390 --> 03:53:21,110
Yeah...

7622
03:53:21,110 --> 03:53:22,230
And then Ko fucking...

7623
03:53:22,230 --> 03:53:23,650
Got blasted...

7624
03:53:23,650 --> 03:53:24,230
To like...

7625
03:53:24,230 --> 03:53:25,630
Loosen up the vibes...

7626
03:53:25,630 --> 03:53:27,070
He's like...

7627
03:53:27,070 --> 03:53:27,950
This is too...

7628
03:53:27,950 --> 03:53:28,870
Too stressful...

7629
03:53:28,870 --> 03:53:29,950
After the first...

7630
03:53:29,950 --> 03:53:31,350
First matchup...

7631
03:53:31,350 --> 03:53:32,210
Ko went...

7632
03:53:32,210 --> 03:53:33,430
To get fucking...

7633
03:53:33,430 --> 03:53:34,510
Like...

7634
03:53:34,510 --> 03:53:36,130
Oh my god...

7635
03:53:36,130 --> 03:53:36,450
Relaxed...

7636
03:53:37,010 --> 03:53:37,710
In general...

7637
03:53:38,970 --> 03:53:39,610
Dude...

7638
03:53:39,610 --> 03:53:40,290
To be honest...

7639
03:53:40,290 --> 03:53:40,630
That was...

7640
03:53:40,630 --> 03:53:42,530
Last night...

7641
03:53:42,530 --> 03:53:43,930
I just...

7642
03:53:43,930 --> 03:53:44,690
I like...

7643
03:53:44,690 --> 03:53:45,170
Drank...

7644
03:53:45,170 --> 03:53:47,310
Two bottles of soju...

7645
03:53:47,310 --> 03:53:47,810
And...

7646
03:53:47,810 --> 03:53:48,110
Oh...

7647
03:53:48,110 --> 03:53:49,570
I should've drank last night...

7648
03:53:49,570 --> 03:53:50,830
I think that would've helped too...

7649
03:53:50,830 --> 03:53:50,930
Girl...

7650
03:53:50,930 --> 03:53:51,250
I should've...

7651
03:53:51,250 --> 03:53:51,770
I think...

7652
03:53:51,770 --> 03:53:52,270
Like...

7653
03:53:52,270 --> 03:53:52,870
No...

7654
03:53:52,870 --> 03:53:53,230
Yeah...

7655
03:53:53,230 --> 03:53:53,390
I...

7656
03:53:54,450 --> 03:53:56,330
That's what I didn't do...

7657
03:53:56,330 --> 03:53:57,230
Before...

7658
03:53:57,230 --> 03:53:58,290
You know how I five...

7659
03:53:58,290 --> 03:53:58,890
Before...

7660
03:53:58,890 --> 03:54:00,210
The day before 5-0...

7661
03:54:00,210 --> 03:54:01,290
I got drunk...

7662
03:54:02,210 --> 03:54:04,070
I got drunk last night...

7663
03:54:04,070 --> 03:54:04,530
So weird...

7664
03:54:04,530 --> 03:54:04,830
Weird...

7665
03:54:04,830 --> 03:54:05,370
Yeah...

7666
03:54:05,370 --> 03:54:07,270
Two zero time...

7667
03:54:07,270 --> 03:54:09,810
The day...

7668
03:54:09,810 --> 03:54:10,350
Literally...

7669
03:54:10,350 --> 03:54:11,930
The day before the finals...

7670
03:54:11,930 --> 03:54:12,650
I drank...

7671
03:54:12,650 --> 03:54:13,310
Cause I was like...

7672
03:54:13,310 --> 03:54:14,010
I can't...

7673
03:54:15,670 --> 03:54:17,190
I need to relax...

7674
03:54:17,190 --> 03:54:18,470
Cause I was training...

7675
03:54:18,470 --> 03:54:19,110
A lot...

7676
03:54:19,110 --> 03:54:20,550
The day before the final...

7677
03:54:20,550 --> 03:54:21,070
Not final...

7678
03:54:21,070 --> 03:54:21,850
The day before...

7679
03:54:21,850 --> 03:54:22,630
Round two...

7680
03:54:22,630 --> 03:54:23,810
I was training a lot...

7681
03:54:23,810 --> 03:54:25,510
And right after training...

7682
03:54:25,510 --> 03:54:26,090
I went to...

7683
03:54:26,090 --> 03:54:26,630
Drink...

7684
03:54:26,630 --> 03:54:27,710
Cause I was like...

7685
03:54:27,710 --> 03:54:28,510
I can't...

7686
03:54:28,510 --> 03:54:28,870
I can't...

7687
03:54:28,870 --> 03:54:29,030
I...

7688
03:54:29,030 --> 03:54:30,010
I need to...

7689
03:54:30,010 --> 03:54:30,410
I...

7690
03:54:30,410 --> 03:54:31,410
I...

7691
03:54:31,410 --> 03:54:33,190
I was like...

7692
03:54:33,190 --> 03:54:33,710
I...

7693
03:54:33,710 --> 03:54:34,790
I cannot...

7694
03:54:34,790 --> 03:54:35,990
I legitimately cannot...

7695
03:54:35,990 --> 03:54:36,650
Do this...

7696
03:54:36,650 --> 03:54:37,210
So...

7697
03:54:37,210 --> 03:54:38,770
I need to relax...

7698
03:54:38,770 --> 03:54:39,370
I need...

7699
03:54:39,370 --> 03:54:41,270
I need to fucking relax...

7700
03:54:41,270 --> 03:54:42,310
Right now...

7701
03:54:42,670 --> 03:54:43,030
Yeah...

7702
03:54:43,030 --> 03:54:43,590
Yeah...

7703
03:54:43,590 --> 03:54:45,130
I still have like...

7704
03:54:45,130 --> 03:54:46,810
Two shots of soju in the bottle...

7705
03:54:46,810 --> 03:54:48,170
I almost drank...

7706
03:54:48,170 --> 03:54:48,750
Yesterday...

7707
03:54:48,750 --> 03:54:49,650
I almost...

7708
03:54:49,650 --> 03:54:50,690
I was so close...

7709
03:54:50,690 --> 03:54:51,310
I was...

7710
03:54:51,310 --> 03:54:51,710
Oh my god...

7711
03:54:51,710 --> 03:54:52,650
Oh my god...

7712
03:54:52,650 --> 03:54:53,990
But instead...

7713
03:54:53,990 --> 03:54:55,590
I drank a fucking...

7714
03:54:55,590 --> 03:54:56,350
San...

7715
03:54:56,350 --> 03:54:56,730
Pe...

7716
03:54:57,670 --> 03:54:58,230
Pellegrino...

7717
03:54:58,230 --> 03:54:58,650
Fucking...

7718
03:54:58,650 --> 03:54:59,510
Pellegrino yeah...

7719
03:54:59,510 --> 03:55:00,570
San Pelegrino...

7720
03:55:00,570 --> 03:55:01,950
Italian sparkling...

7721
03:55:01,950 --> 03:55:03,890
I drank that instead...

7722
03:55:04,570 --> 03:55:05,550
I was like...

7723
03:55:05,550 --> 03:55:05,570
Do I drink...

7724
03:55:05,570 --> 03:55:06,730
And now I know where we are...

7725
03:55:06,730 --> 03:55:08,290
My hard iced tea...

7726
03:55:08,290 --> 03:55:10,370
Or do I drink a San Pelgrino...

7727
03:55:10,370 --> 03:55:10,770
And...

7728
03:55:17,270 --> 03:55:18,390
I think...

7729
03:55:18,390 --> 03:55:20,110
I think we found the answer...

7730
03:55:20,610 --> 03:55:21,430
I knew it...

7731
03:55:21,430 --> 03:55:22,950
The day before I just need to...

7732
03:55:22,950 --> 03:55:23,330
I just...

7733
03:55:23,330 --> 03:55:24,410
I need to relax...

7734
03:55:24,410 --> 03:55:25,450
Come on...

7735
03:55:28,930 --> 03:55:30,390
But our chat had fun.

7736
03:55:30,650 --> 03:55:32,690
I'm glad chat had fun in the tournament.

7737
03:55:33,050 --> 03:55:37,730
I like just talking and chilling after it's over.

7738
03:55:37,970 --> 03:55:41,150
I hope you guys enjoyed just vibing right after, guys.

7739
03:55:41,950 --> 03:55:44,590
It was a very stressful tournament in general.

7740
03:55:46,330 --> 03:55:49,290
So I just like decompressing right after it.

7741
03:55:50,650 --> 03:55:52,010
And hanging out.

7742
03:55:52,390 --> 03:55:53,670
I was gonna go take a nap.

7743
03:55:53,670 --> 03:55:54,570
Me too.

7744
03:55:55,430 --> 03:55:58,050
In the end, the fucking matches are all over.

7745
03:55:58,210 --> 03:56:00,130
But I was literally gonna go take a nap.

7746
03:56:00,610 --> 03:56:03,470
Because I was like, alright guys, I'm not gonna watch the finals.

7747
03:56:03,550 --> 03:56:04,310
I'm gonna nap now.

7748
03:56:04,570 --> 03:56:05,930
And then we're just here talking.

7749
03:56:13,430 --> 03:56:14,210
It's the tournament.

7750
03:56:14,290 --> 03:56:15,190
What did you expect?

7751
03:56:15,390 --> 03:56:18,870
Yeah, but the Tekken Sajan Slam was so much more...

7752
03:56:18,870 --> 03:56:20,190
It was so chill.

7753
03:56:22,150 --> 03:56:23,650
The Tekken one was super...

7754
03:56:23,650 --> 03:56:24,010
Super chill.

7755
03:56:24,250 --> 03:56:25,590
That's what I expected.

7756
03:56:26,150 --> 03:56:28,230
The Tekken one was super fucking chill.

7757
03:56:28,470 --> 03:56:29,590
But it was also like...

7758
03:56:30,490 --> 03:56:32,390
Like I said, the money was on the line.

7759
03:56:32,590 --> 03:56:36,450
So people had to try really hard this time around.

7760
03:56:39,070 --> 03:56:40,970
Yeah, it was not 50k.

7761
03:56:41,150 --> 03:56:43,750
That's why I was just like...

7762
03:56:45,150 --> 03:56:49,070
I needed to change my mindset going in and not have to drink.

7763
03:56:53,480 --> 03:56:53,960
Yeah.

7764
03:56:53,960 --> 03:57:01,040
I think like literally in the Tekken Sajan Slam, everyone was just hanging out on the call every single day and just vibing.

7765
03:57:01,060 --> 03:57:01,200
That's true.

7766
03:57:01,200 --> 03:57:04,820
Yeah, it didn't even matter if they were like part of the enemy team or whatever.

7767
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:08,120
I see like people from different teams like in the call and stuff.

7768
03:57:08,760 --> 03:57:12,860
I guess, to be fair, they didn't open general chat until the first day of round robin.

7769
03:57:12,900 --> 03:57:14,660
Because I guess they didn't know it was locked.

7770
03:57:14,940 --> 03:57:15,960
Oh, that's funny.

7771
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:22,520
But I also think that there's just more people who like to vibe.

7772
03:57:22,520 --> 03:57:30,520
Like Sean wasn't part of this Slam and Sean was one of the people who like set up those scrim lobbies.

7773
03:57:30,800 --> 03:57:31,940
Oh, really?

7774
03:57:32,380 --> 03:57:33,180
Oh, that's nice.

7775
03:57:33,360 --> 03:57:35,280
I don't think I joined any of like the group.

7776
03:57:35,340 --> 03:57:38,340
I know like a lot of people from Tekken.

7777
03:57:38,680 --> 03:57:45,700
A lot of people during the Tekken one were just hanging out and the group thing every day.

7778
03:57:46,040 --> 03:57:47,280
Even after too.

7779
03:57:47,500 --> 03:57:52,340
It was there everybody was just hanging out and just playing with each other.

7780
03:57:52,520 --> 03:57:53,780
Or like playing against each other.

7781
03:57:53,820 --> 03:57:57,060
Like playing against each other or just like streaming their ranked games and stuff.

7782
03:58:00,340 --> 03:58:05,760
Like yeah, like money definitely does like change the whole environment of the tournament.

7783
03:58:08,500 --> 03:58:13,420
And like, you know, it's always nice to win prize money and stuff.

7784
03:58:13,820 --> 03:58:15,620
But like, oh my god, my fucking heart.

7785
03:58:15,620 --> 03:58:17,640
Probably one jackbox party.

7786
03:58:17,840 --> 03:58:19,500
Yeah, my fucking heart, man.

7787
03:58:24,740 --> 03:58:41,280
I think that's also why like when you win, like, you know, training, I think it definitely affected my training, too, because I think about is like, oh, I need to do well, because like, you know, the my teammates need the money, you know?

7788
03:58:42,580 --> 03:58:43,020
Yeah.

7789
03:58:44,280 --> 03:58:44,720
Yeah.

7790
03:58:44,840 --> 03:58:49,980
And then, like, that's why I needed that mental reset because I can't keep thinking like that.

7791
03:58:50,040 --> 03:58:51,280
Like, I was like...

7792
03:58:51,280 --> 03:58:51,780
I was like...

7793
03:58:51,780 --> 03:58:52,500
I was like...

7794
03:58:56,380 --> 03:58:57,620
Yeah, I get what you mean.

7795
03:58:57,880 --> 03:58:58,020
Yeah.

7796
03:58:59,860 --> 03:59:04,460
Yeah, I definitely train harder because of it, though, because I was like, oh, I want my team to do really well.

7797
03:59:04,560 --> 03:59:07,600
And I want my team to have be able to win more prize money.

7798
03:59:08,580 --> 03:59:08,940
Damn.

7799
03:59:09,620 --> 03:59:11,000
I don't think I could do that again.

7800
03:59:11,280 --> 03:59:11,620
I'm gonna DM you something.

7801
03:59:12,220 --> 03:59:13,420
I don't think I can.

7802
03:59:13,480 --> 03:59:13,720
Yeah.

7803
03:59:17,800 --> 03:59:19,420
I was just like, oh, man.

7804
03:59:19,560 --> 03:59:19,900
I...

7805
03:59:24,070 --> 03:59:24,430
I...

7806
03:59:24,430 --> 03:59:24,450
I...

7807
03:59:24,450 --> 03:59:24,730
I...

7808
03:59:24,750 --> 03:59:25,950
I can't.

7809
03:59:25,970 --> 03:59:26,610
I can't do this.

7810
03:59:26,770 --> 03:59:27,210
I can't.

7811
03:59:27,210 --> 03:59:29,750
I can't be so serious.

7812
03:59:30,490 --> 03:59:31,750
Alright, I DM you.

7813
03:59:31,970 --> 03:59:32,310
What?

7814
03:59:42,870 --> 03:59:43,410
Yeah.

7815
03:59:44,770 --> 03:59:45,310
Yeah.

7816
03:59:46,030 --> 03:59:46,290
Yeah.

7817
03:59:46,890 --> 03:59:51,530
But yeah, thinking about the money definitely made the nerves even worse for me, too.

7818
03:59:52,230 --> 03:59:56,330
Because the money affects... makes it more stressful and more pressure.

7819
03:59:56,810 --> 03:59:58,230
But in the end...

7820
03:59:58,230 --> 03:59:58,710
Yeah.

7821
03:59:58,710 --> 04:00:00,610
I'm glad my team was able to pull through.

7822
04:00:01,490 --> 04:00:03,770
I'm glad both of our teams were able to pull through.

7823
04:00:04,710 --> 04:00:09,870
What I messaged you about was the reason why, like, I kind of even forgot there was money on the law.

7824
04:00:12,670 --> 04:00:14,210
You still made it.

7825
04:00:14,210 --> 04:00:15,390
That's the crazy part.

7826
04:00:15,670 --> 04:00:17,010
You guys still made it.

7827
04:00:17,550 --> 04:00:19,370
You guys still made it there.

7828
04:00:19,610 --> 04:00:21,490
Because I know for sure, like...

7829
04:00:21,490 --> 04:00:22,390
Wait, sorry.

7830
04:00:22,510 --> 04:00:22,970
This is gonna...

7831
04:00:22,970 --> 04:00:23,530
Bo-boat.

7832
04:00:33,960 --> 04:00:36,320
Oh, I wish I could say this.

7833
04:00:36,660 --> 04:00:37,040
I don't...

7834
04:00:40,840 --> 04:00:43,340
Can we say this while getting in trouble?

7835
04:00:44,300 --> 04:00:45,940
No, I think we'll get in trouble.

7836
04:00:46,200 --> 04:00:49,140
No, I meant the other part about the money part.

7837
04:00:50,040 --> 04:00:51,220
Oh, yeah.

7838
04:00:51,320 --> 04:00:51,600
No.

7839
04:00:51,740 --> 04:00:55,980
We can say that there are some players out there who just do not need the money.

7840
04:00:57,200 --> 04:01:00,880
Like, you know, there's some players out there who don't really need...

7841
04:01:00,880 --> 04:01:03,140
Who don't really take it as serious.

7842
04:01:03,140 --> 04:01:05,480
Because the money is not...

7843
04:01:05,480 --> 04:01:06,860
Does not matter to them.

7844
04:01:06,860 --> 04:01:07,400
It's like negligible to them.

7845
04:01:07,660 --> 04:01:07,720
Yeah.

7846
04:01:20,220 --> 04:01:21,280
That's like...

7847
04:01:21,280 --> 04:01:24,180
That should cure half the FOMO for you guys.

7848
04:01:25,060 --> 04:01:26,280
I tried!

7849
04:01:26,400 --> 04:01:29,220
I tried so hard, guys!

7850
04:01:30,000 --> 04:01:30,940
I just...

7851
04:01:30,940 --> 04:01:32,220
I needed that day.

7852
04:01:32,340 --> 04:01:33,120
I had it.

7853
04:01:33,120 --> 04:01:36,020
I had to mentally reset myself on that day, guys.

7854
04:01:36,120 --> 04:01:36,660
I tried...

7855
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:37,900
I tried so much.

7856
04:01:38,220 --> 04:01:38,680
I...

7857
04:01:38,680 --> 04:01:39,740
I...

7858
04:01:44,740 --> 04:01:47,080
I actually tried so much, guys.

7859
04:01:47,280 --> 04:01:47,680
I...

7860
04:01:47,680 --> 04:01:49,560
I had to fucking...

7861
04:01:49,560 --> 04:01:51,100
I had to rest after.

7862
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:54,280
I was consistent about trying.

7863
04:01:59,460 --> 04:02:00,420
Oh, wait.

7864
04:02:00,560 --> 04:02:00,900
See?

7865
04:02:00,960 --> 04:02:02,900
Jeff fucking talked about it.

7866
04:02:02,900 --> 04:02:03,200
Bro.

7867
04:02:04,520 --> 04:02:05,580
Wait, where?

7868
04:02:06,140 --> 04:02:06,820
Apparently.

7869
04:02:11,940 --> 04:02:12,900
Oh, yeah.

7870
04:02:12,940 --> 04:02:15,920
Apparently, Seijoo reached about it.

7871
04:02:16,560 --> 04:02:17,240
Damn.

7872
04:02:18,840 --> 04:02:26,260
He told me that he had to beg Esme to even meet our coach before a round-robin day.

7873
04:02:26,480 --> 04:02:27,780
Oh, my god, what?

7874
04:02:29,380 --> 04:02:30,060
Holy...

7875
04:02:31,480 --> 04:02:32,880
Guys, I'm not sure if I was supposed to say this or not.

7876
04:02:32,880 --> 04:02:40,600
I didn't fucking stream like Madden instead of playing Street Fighter, I would have fallen in Street Fighter guys.

7877
04:02:40,880 --> 04:02:42,620
I didn't stream other things.

7878
04:02:45,220 --> 04:02:47,260
I actually tried.

7879
04:02:52,400 --> 04:02:54,180
I feel bad for him though.

7880
04:02:54,280 --> 04:02:56,120
It seems like he is trying his best.

7881
04:02:56,400 --> 04:03:02,400
Like he... he like in our team chat has talked about how he's been grinding a lot the past couple of days.

7882
04:03:02,400 --> 04:03:05,940
But he's also like getting a ton of backseaters in his chat.

7883
04:03:06,140 --> 04:03:09,160
Yeah, that's why he went on the... I saw that he streamed on another channel too.

7884
04:03:10,600 --> 04:03:13,100
Yeah, you didn't know that?

7885
04:03:13,200 --> 04:03:16,080
He had a second channel that he was just streaming that on.

7886
04:03:16,780 --> 04:03:17,680
Girl, I don't know.

7887
04:03:17,720 --> 04:03:18,480
I don't watch stuff.

7888
04:03:18,700 --> 04:03:21,520
It just... it popped up in my... oh wait no it didn't pop up.

7889
04:03:21,660 --> 04:03:25,320
It like pop... you know how he has like that purple thing that shows up when you're streaming?

7890
04:03:27,180 --> 04:03:31,720
Like you know when somebody's streaming it's like... oh like it has that purple notification.

7891
04:03:32,400 --> 04:03:35,580
And then I saw Espam was streaming so I looked at it but it wasn't his channel.

7892
04:03:35,980 --> 04:03:38,160
It was like a different channel.

7893
04:03:38,340 --> 04:03:38,600
Yeah.

7894
04:03:39,040 --> 04:03:39,720
On Discord.

7895
04:03:40,680 --> 04:03:42,660
I know the backseat has been really...

7896
04:03:42,660 --> 04:03:44,540
Yeah, the backseat has been really bad I heard.

7897
04:03:44,680 --> 04:03:46,820
But like I don't pay attention to the chat when...

7898
04:03:47,660 --> 04:03:51,160
If I am getting backseated, I don't pay attention to chat while I'm playing.

7899
04:03:52,200 --> 04:03:54,800
Yeah, what are... well what are they gonna backseat about me bro?

7900
04:03:54,860 --> 04:03:56,000
All I do is Blanka Ball.

7901
04:03:56,220 --> 04:04:00,780
Like they're always like head... I always... I saw like one thing a lot and it was like headbutt.

7902
04:04:00,840 --> 04:04:02,160
You're always forgetting the headbutt.

7903
04:04:02,400 --> 04:04:06,740
And because I see that, I was like... I was just like... oh well.

7904
04:04:07,600 --> 04:04:08,920
I'm... the game's over.

7905
04:04:10,540 --> 04:04:14,900
Like... I just... I re-chat after my matches are over.

7906
04:04:15,080 --> 04:04:16,740
Like after... like in between matches.

7907
04:04:17,220 --> 04:04:19,400
So I was like well it's too bad, like game's over.

7908
04:04:20,560 --> 04:04:21,120
Yeah.

7909
04:04:25,180 --> 04:04:27,660
And then I never headbutted again.

7910
04:04:29,080 --> 04:04:31,000
No like... oh man.

7911
04:04:32,400 --> 04:04:34,520
It's like when someone tells you, oh you should have done this.

7912
04:04:34,560 --> 04:04:37,420
You like keep it in your head and then you start making mistakes because of it.

7913
04:04:37,420 --> 04:04:39,940
Yeah, that's why I don't want... I try not to focus on my chat too.

7914
04:04:40,140 --> 04:04:44,240
Like if... like if I'm in the game right now.

7915
04:04:44,440 --> 04:04:47,220
Because then like... you're not doing the circle.

7916
04:04:47,400 --> 04:04:50,680
And then so then now in my head I was like, I'm gonna do circles all the time.

7917
04:04:51,120 --> 04:04:53,420
And then I realized that... I think it was the first day.

7918
04:04:53,500 --> 04:04:57,260
I realized that I was fucking up because all I kept doing was like what if I just do circle.

7919
04:04:57,540 --> 04:04:59,880
And I realized, no I should not be doing that.

7920
04:04:59,880 --> 04:05:00,920
Like what am I doing?

7921
04:05:00,980 --> 04:05:02,420
Why did I... why did I listen?

7922
04:05:02,800 --> 04:05:05,000
Why did I hyper focus on the circle?

7923
04:05:09,460 --> 04:05:11,860
But I just listen to what my coaches tell me.

7924
04:05:12,480 --> 04:05:12,920
Yeah.

7925
04:05:13,320 --> 04:05:15,440
No, I appreciate the coaches that are like...

7926
04:05:15,960 --> 04:05:18,920
Okay, you can... they're going to dash in now.

7927
04:05:19,080 --> 04:05:20,820
And I'm like, oh, okay, if you say so.

7928
04:05:23,000 --> 04:05:24,420
Okay, I'll do the thing.

7929
04:05:24,660 --> 04:05:24,880
Okay, I'll jump.

7930
04:05:26,140 --> 04:05:27,980
It's like actually ratatouille shit.

7931
04:05:29,880 --> 04:05:31,220
Yeah, yeah, it's true, true.

7932
04:05:32,640 --> 04:05:35,840
They just have to be the rat and I just need to wear the hat.

7933
04:05:36,200 --> 04:05:36,660
Nice.

7934
04:05:37,960 --> 04:05:38,420
Nice.

7935
04:05:39,160 --> 04:05:39,840
Me too.

7936
04:05:40,040 --> 04:05:41,260
That's actually me as well.

7937
04:05:41,420 --> 04:05:41,660
Yeah.

7938
04:05:44,220 --> 04:05:46,800
But like I can't have too much...

7939
04:05:48,540 --> 04:05:49,960
Too much back seating.

7940
04:05:51,180 --> 04:05:52,640
Because like I get overwhelmed.

7941
04:05:53,960 --> 04:05:54,880
Oh, yeah.

7942
04:05:55,180 --> 04:05:56,500
Yeah, I told my coach.

7943
04:05:56,600 --> 04:05:57,920
I was like, oh, I don't...

7944
04:05:57,920 --> 04:05:59,560
I don't want to get...

7945
04:06:00,160 --> 04:06:00,600
Overwhelmed.

7946
04:06:00,640 --> 04:06:06,500
So I want you to like not give me too much information.

7947
04:06:07,360 --> 04:06:11,220
And because like if you give me too much information,

7948
04:06:14,420 --> 04:06:16,380
I get really overwhelmed.

7949
04:06:16,560 --> 04:06:20,080
So then my coach stopped doing that because I think that was my first game with you two.

7950
04:06:20,220 --> 04:06:23,100
It was like I had so much information and then I just...

7951
04:06:23,100 --> 04:06:23,840
Oh, yeah.

7952
04:06:24,000 --> 04:06:26,940
I couldn't figure out what to do at first.

7953
04:06:27,320 --> 04:06:28,820
Because I was like, what do I have?

7954
04:06:28,900 --> 04:06:29,240
What buttons?

7955
04:06:29,240 --> 04:06:31,880
And also I threw a fucking downloading of mine.

7956
04:06:32,020 --> 04:06:33,980
But like it was both of those.

7957
04:06:34,620 --> 04:06:38,700
I think I'm so thankful that my coach realized this because all he says now is...

7958
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:40,660
Oh, you can command grab.

7959
04:06:40,740 --> 04:06:43,000
But then I listened to him coach my teammates.

7960
04:06:43,200 --> 04:06:44,400
Like backseat them.

7961
04:06:44,520 --> 04:06:46,240
He's like, oh, you should have shoryuken.

7962
04:06:47,520 --> 04:06:48,320
Rising Chidori.

7963
04:06:49,140 --> 04:06:51,000
Medium punch down low crouch.

7964
04:06:51,540 --> 04:06:51,940
Yeah.

7965
04:06:52,580 --> 04:06:53,260
I'm like, what?

7966
04:06:58,000 --> 04:06:58,660
That's funny.

7967
04:06:58,980 --> 04:07:01,200
I'm thankful to the coaches who do like, you know.

7968
04:07:01,920 --> 04:07:03,800
Baby a town for us.

7969
04:07:07,040 --> 04:07:07,580
Yeah.

7970
04:07:08,780 --> 04:07:09,860
I'm glad too.

7971
04:07:10,100 --> 04:07:11,620
I'm glad for the...

7972
04:07:12,180 --> 04:07:13,160
Oh, yeah.

7973
04:07:13,280 --> 04:07:15,140
I'm very happy about the babying.

7974
04:07:15,320 --> 04:07:15,860
Yeah.

7975
04:07:17,500 --> 04:07:19,260
They were like circle.

7976
04:07:19,960 --> 04:07:20,500
X.

7977
04:07:23,560 --> 04:07:24,640
Down triangle.

7978
04:07:24,780 --> 04:07:26,220
And I'm like, thank you.

7979
04:07:26,240 --> 04:07:27,900
I don't know what I'm...

7980
04:07:27,900 --> 04:07:29,760
I don't know what I'm doing.

7981
04:07:30,580 --> 04:07:31,120
No.

7982
04:07:31,120 --> 04:07:34,300
I was literally pressing all three like punch buttons at once.

7983
04:07:39,900 --> 04:07:41,880
We just kept it simple for me.

7984
04:07:45,120 --> 04:07:46,100
That's funny.

7985
04:07:51,220 --> 04:07:52,620
Oh, my God.

7986
04:07:53,120 --> 04:07:54,300
Did you eat dinner yet?

7987
04:07:55,220 --> 04:07:56,820
Did you eat dinner?

7988
04:07:57,260 --> 04:07:58,320
No, not yet.

7989
04:07:58,660 --> 04:07:59,480
I've been eating...

7990
04:07:59,480 --> 04:08:00,660
The thing is during Street Fighter.

7991
04:08:00,660 --> 04:08:02,860
I've been eating one meal.

7992
04:08:03,940 --> 04:08:04,420
Yeah.

7993
04:08:06,740 --> 04:08:07,700
Every day.

7994
04:08:08,360 --> 04:08:08,840
Yeah.

7995
04:08:08,940 --> 04:08:10,040
That's the runner lifestyle.

7996
04:08:10,600 --> 04:08:10,740
Yeah.

7997
04:08:10,860 --> 04:08:15,940
I've been eating one meal every day because I've just been like grinding Street Fighter.

7998
04:08:17,380 --> 04:08:20,480
And then I just get too stressed out.

7999
04:08:21,320 --> 04:08:22,280
My Tamagotchi.

8000
04:08:25,040 --> 04:08:25,520
Sorry.

8001
04:08:25,600 --> 04:08:25,820
Go on.

8002
04:08:25,920 --> 04:08:26,160
Yeah.

8003
04:08:26,200 --> 04:08:27,720
I got too stressed out that I just...

8004
04:08:27,720 --> 04:08:28,420
I wasn't hungry.

8005
04:08:28,480 --> 04:08:30,060
So, like, I'd eat like lunch.

8006
04:08:30,160 --> 04:08:30,640
Yeah.

8007
04:08:30,640 --> 04:08:33,140
At like 2 to 3 p.m.

8008
04:08:33,160 --> 04:08:35,040
And then like play Street Fighter.

8009
04:08:35,680 --> 04:08:36,640
And then...

8010
04:08:37,260 --> 04:08:38,860
And then I've just like...

8011
04:08:38,860 --> 04:08:39,680
I'm not hungry.

8012
04:08:39,800 --> 04:08:40,780
I drink.

8013
04:08:40,900 --> 04:08:41,500
I hydrate.

8014
04:08:41,720 --> 04:08:42,860
And then I just go to bed.

8015
04:08:43,040 --> 04:08:43,220
Oh, yeah.

8016
04:08:44,580 --> 04:08:46,320
But I think...

8017
04:08:46,320 --> 04:08:47,080
I think like...

8018
04:08:47,080 --> 04:08:50,240
Obviously, now my mind is much more chill now.

8019
04:08:52,120 --> 04:08:54,320
So, I can focus on eating again.

8020
04:08:57,400 --> 04:08:57,880
Yeah.

8021
04:08:58,880 --> 04:09:00,580
But it was a fun experience.

8022
04:09:00,600 --> 04:09:00,620
Yeah.

8023
04:09:00,620 --> 04:09:01,320
So...

8024
04:09:01,900 --> 04:09:02,420
Yeah.

8025
04:09:02,580 --> 04:09:04,040
I just had my one meal today.

8026
04:09:04,180 --> 04:09:04,820
Which was...

8027
04:09:04,820 --> 04:09:06,140
I ordered udon.

8028
04:09:06,420 --> 04:09:07,440
You ordered udon?

8029
04:09:07,680 --> 04:09:08,000
Oh.

8030
04:09:08,740 --> 04:09:09,840
I meant pizza.

8031
04:09:10,100 --> 04:09:10,740
I meant pizza.

8032
04:09:11,140 --> 04:09:11,660
Oh.

8033
04:09:12,680 --> 04:09:13,200
Yeah.

8034
04:09:14,640 --> 04:09:15,680
I'm going...

8035
04:09:15,680 --> 04:09:15,720
Dude, what the...

8036
04:09:15,720 --> 04:09:16,300
Fuck.

8037
04:09:16,480 --> 04:09:17,300
Fucking stupid.

8038
04:09:17,560 --> 04:09:19,420
Can you get a Tamagotchi?

8039
04:09:19,480 --> 04:09:21,560
Can you buy one so our Tamagotchis can get married?

8040
04:09:22,180 --> 04:09:22,520
No.

8041
04:09:22,800 --> 04:09:23,180
Tamagotchi...

8042
04:09:23,180 --> 04:09:23,640
God!

8043
04:09:23,760 --> 04:09:24,800
It's too much weird.

8044
04:09:24,860 --> 04:09:24,900
No.

8045
04:09:24,920 --> 04:09:25,100
No.

8046
04:09:25,120 --> 04:09:25,280
No.

8047
04:09:25,280 --> 04:09:25,580
No.

8048
04:09:25,580 --> 04:09:25,800
No.

8049
04:09:25,900 --> 04:09:26,460
It's like...

8050
04:09:26,460 --> 04:09:27,540
They're so advanced.

8051
04:09:27,620 --> 04:09:29,600
Now there's babysitters in Tamagotchi.

8052
04:09:29,600 --> 04:09:31,480
So, you can send them to the babysitter when you're streaming.

8053
04:09:32,020 --> 04:09:32,420
What?

8054
04:09:33,400 --> 04:09:33,800
Yeah.

8055
04:09:33,860 --> 04:09:34,600
And then, like...

8056
04:09:35,700 --> 04:09:37,360
Girl, I'm playing with mine right now.

8057
04:09:38,880 --> 04:09:39,940
Never send real collab boys.

8058
04:09:39,940 --> 04:09:40,440
It's just...

8059
04:09:40,440 --> 04:09:41,060
I don't have time.

8060
04:09:41,220 --> 04:09:42,980
I don't have time to fucking play.

8061
04:09:43,020 --> 04:09:43,340
No.

8062
04:09:43,340 --> 04:09:44,940
Like, all you do is beat it.

8063
04:09:44,980 --> 04:09:46,020
And that's it, bro.

8064
04:09:46,100 --> 04:09:47,180
And then they grow up.

8065
04:09:47,220 --> 04:09:47,940
It's like...

8066
04:09:49,060 --> 04:09:50,480
I'm having a jolly good time.

8067
04:09:50,580 --> 04:09:51,060
Thank you.

8068
04:09:53,500 --> 04:09:53,900
Whatever.

8069
04:09:54,220 --> 04:09:56,760
Like, I don't even want to marry your Tamagotchi anyways.

8070
04:09:58,780 --> 04:10:01,530
I'm having a jolly good time.

8071
04:10:01,550 --> 04:10:02,310
Oh, god.

8072
04:10:03,790 --> 04:10:04,270
Okay.

8073
04:10:05,110 --> 04:10:05,590
Well.

8074
04:10:07,570 --> 04:10:08,970
I'll message you later tonight.

8075
04:10:10,350 --> 04:10:10,830
Alright.

8076
04:10:11,070 --> 04:10:11,810
GG's, Gumi.

8077
04:10:12,470 --> 04:10:12,950
GG's.

8078
04:10:13,030 --> 04:10:14,230
I hope you rest well.

8079
04:10:16,590 --> 04:10:17,070
GG's.

8080
04:10:17,070 --> 04:10:17,090
GG's.

8081
04:10:17,210 --> 04:10:17,890
Talk to you later.

8082
04:10:18,090 --> 04:10:20,610
And start eating two meals again like me.

8083
04:10:20,950 --> 04:10:21,150
What?

8084
04:10:22,170 --> 04:10:22,650
No.

8085
04:10:22,730 --> 04:10:23,950
I'm on that Brunner lifestyle.

8086
04:10:26,410 --> 04:10:27,090
Oh, no.

8087
04:10:27,110 --> 04:10:27,650
That's not good.

8088
04:10:28,330 --> 04:10:28,810
What?

8089
04:10:28,950 --> 04:10:29,390
No.

8090
04:10:29,430 --> 04:10:29,930
That's not good.

8091
04:10:30,750 --> 04:10:31,230
It's...

8092
04:10:31,230 --> 04:10:31,530
I'm on that Brunner lifestyle.

8093
04:10:31,530 --> 04:10:31,730
Alright.

8094
04:10:33,070 --> 04:10:33,730
I'm gonna...

8095
04:10:33,730 --> 04:10:37,170
I'm, like, on East Coast schedule, so I've been sleeping at, like, 11 PM every day.

8096
04:10:40,830 --> 04:10:41,230
What?

8097
04:10:41,450 --> 04:10:41,610
Yeah.

8098
04:10:42,390 --> 04:10:42,790
Yeah.

8099
04:10:42,850 --> 04:10:43,750
I'm on East Coast schedule.

8100
04:10:43,890 --> 04:10:44,270
Do you know what?

8101
04:10:44,270 --> 04:10:45,610
I'll message you the details about it.

8102
04:10:47,450 --> 04:10:47,850
Okay.

8103
04:10:47,970 --> 04:10:48,190
Yeah.

8104
04:10:48,210 --> 04:10:48,750
I was like, what?

8105
04:10:48,990 --> 04:10:50,990
Why are you on an East Coast schedule?

8106
04:10:51,790 --> 04:10:54,530
Ever since I came back from Florida, I haven't been the same.

8107
04:10:57,910 --> 04:10:58,310
Alright.

8108
04:10:58,450 --> 04:11:00,470
Go take care of yourself and I'll try to.

8109
04:11:01,810 --> 04:11:02,210
Okay.

8110
04:11:02,210 --> 04:11:02,370
Okay.

8111
04:11:02,370 --> 04:11:03,570
My Tamagotchi says bye.

8112
04:11:03,810 --> 04:11:04,230
Alright.

8113
04:11:04,370 --> 04:11:05,730
I'll see you later, Gumi.

8114
04:11:05,990 --> 04:11:06,530
Bye-bye.

8115
04:11:07,250 --> 04:11:08,430
Say bye to my Tamagotchi.

8116
04:11:08,850 --> 04:11:09,170
What the hell?

8117
04:11:09,210 --> 04:11:09,570
Bye-bye.

8118
04:11:10,470 --> 04:11:11,110
Bye-bye.

8119
04:11:11,230 --> 04:11:12,170
Love you.

8120
04:11:12,250 --> 04:11:12,730
Bye-bye.

8121
04:11:14,290 --> 04:11:15,210
Say it back.

8122
04:11:15,310 --> 04:11:15,830
Say it back.

8123
04:11:16,010 --> 04:11:16,270
Bye.

8124
04:11:19,750 --> 04:11:20,630
Alright, guys.

8125
04:11:21,010 --> 04:11:21,490
I...

8126
04:11:21,490 --> 04:11:22,430
I'm gonna hang up.

8127
04:11:22,570 --> 04:11:23,170
She went...

8128
04:11:23,850 --> 04:11:25,370
She tried to call me again.

8129
04:11:25,830 --> 04:11:26,310
Okay.

8130
04:11:26,470 --> 04:11:26,950
Okay.

8131
04:11:29,370 --> 04:11:29,850
Okay.

8132
04:11:30,630 --> 04:11:30,850
Okay.

8133
04:11:30,850 --> 04:11:31,050
Okay.

8134
04:11:31,090 --> 04:11:31,570
Okay.

8135
04:11:31,850 --> 04:11:32,110
Okay.

8136
04:11:32,110 --> 04:11:32,190
Okay.

8137
04:11:36,310 --> 04:11:37,210
Gumi, stop.

8138
04:11:37,450 --> 04:11:38,450
I will block you.

8139
04:11:38,570 --> 04:11:40,150
I need to say bye.

8140
04:11:40,850 --> 04:11:41,570
Hey, guys.

8141
04:11:41,630 --> 04:11:42,730
I am gonna...

8142
04:11:42,730 --> 04:11:43,230
Okay.

8143
04:11:43,310 --> 04:11:43,890
I'm gonna...

8144
04:11:43,890 --> 04:11:45,290
Give me a sec, guys.

8145
04:11:46,970 --> 04:11:47,450
Okay.

8146
04:11:48,990 --> 04:11:50,330
She can't do that again.

8147
04:11:50,570 --> 04:11:51,010
Okay.

8148
04:11:51,050 --> 04:11:51,530
Anyway, guys.

8149
04:11:51,630 --> 04:11:52,090
I blocked you.

8150
04:11:56,030 --> 04:11:56,990
Hey, guys.

8151
04:11:57,070 --> 04:11:58,650
I am gonna sleep now.

8152
04:11:58,790 --> 04:12:00,350
I was actually gonna sleep right after.

8153
04:12:01,350 --> 04:12:02,090
Right after.

8154
04:12:02,110 --> 04:12:02,190
Okay.

8155
04:12:02,190 --> 04:12:03,810
Oh, I didn't realize I had a long talk.

8156
04:12:04,010 --> 04:12:06,470
It was nice talking to Gumi and just chilling.

8157
04:12:08,550 --> 04:12:09,670
Great experience.

8158
04:12:10,410 --> 04:12:12,030
I really enjoyed it.

8159
04:12:12,130 --> 04:12:13,490
Met a lot of new friends.

8160
04:12:15,310 --> 04:12:17,390
This next week is a lot.

8161
04:12:17,530 --> 04:12:22,730
Not rest week because I actually have a lot of commitments to do for next week.

8162
04:12:22,870 --> 04:12:25,570
So we're gonna have to deal with that.

8163
04:12:26,330 --> 04:12:27,590
I have like...

8164
04:12:27,590 --> 04:12:31,210
I think like a sponsor next week.

8165
04:12:31,210 --> 04:12:35,750
And I promised to show up for some collabs.

8166
04:12:36,690 --> 04:12:39,310
So it's gonna be busy for next week.

8167
04:12:39,430 --> 04:12:45,510
So I hope Sunday I can mental reset by then.

8168
04:12:45,750 --> 04:12:49,530
But I do hope you guys enjoy the SageM Slam 3 journey.

8169
04:12:50,830 --> 04:12:52,970
A lot of support from you guys.

8170
04:12:53,030 --> 04:12:54,290
I really do appreciate it.

8171
04:12:55,150 --> 04:13:01,190
And a lot of support even though I didn't win my games today.

8172
04:13:01,210 --> 04:13:05,330
I really appreciate you guys supporting me and supporting my team.

8173
04:13:05,570 --> 04:13:07,210
I had a fun time.

8174
04:13:07,550 --> 04:13:10,010
And I know like...

8175
04:13:10,010 --> 04:13:13,250
I know a lot of people expected me to do better.

8176
04:13:13,430 --> 04:13:15,690
But it was definitely a learning experience.

8177
04:13:15,710 --> 04:13:18,690
And I did choose my...

8178
04:13:18,690 --> 04:13:25,630
I did choose my mental reset over hard training for the final day.

8179
04:13:25,810 --> 04:13:28,390
And obviously like, you know...

8180
04:13:29,250 --> 04:13:30,290
It showed.

8181
04:13:31,590 --> 04:13:35,310
But I'm happy that my team...

8182
04:13:36,750 --> 04:13:39,230
My team did really well.

8183
04:13:39,370 --> 04:13:41,750
And took us to TwitchCon.

8184
04:13:42,350 --> 04:13:44,010
So I really appreciate my team.

8185
04:13:44,190 --> 04:13:49,810
I really appreciate my team clutching it out for me in the end.

8186
04:13:50,390 --> 04:13:51,050
And...

8187
04:13:51,050 --> 04:13:52,610
Yeah, like...

8188
04:13:52,610 --> 04:13:54,270
I told myself like...

8189
04:13:55,310 --> 04:13:57,110
I was like...

8190
04:13:57,110 --> 04:13:58,370
I need this.

8191
04:13:58,550 --> 04:13:59,670
I need to rest.

8192
04:14:00,490 --> 04:14:01,150
I...

8193
04:14:01,150 --> 04:14:05,010
I grinded so much pre Street Fighter.

8194
04:14:05,050 --> 04:14:06,330
Because I knew...

8195
04:14:06,330 --> 04:14:07,390
There's a lot of money online.

8196
04:14:08,610 --> 04:14:10,290
And I tried my best.

8197
04:14:10,530 --> 04:14:11,450
And that's all that matters.

8198
04:14:11,590 --> 04:14:12,350
I tried my best.

8199
04:14:13,790 --> 04:14:15,250
And we all had fun.

8200
04:14:15,590 --> 04:14:16,870
And that's all that matters.

8201
04:14:16,970 --> 04:14:18,270
And I hope you guys had fun too.

8202
04:14:18,410 --> 04:14:19,250
As always everybody...

8203
04:14:19,750 --> 04:14:20,590
Stay hydrated.

8204
04:14:20,910 --> 04:14:21,470
Posture check.

8205
04:14:21,610 --> 04:14:23,010
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

8206
04:14:23,150 --> 04:14:24,250
And if you stood up for me...

8207
04:14:24,250 --> 04:14:25,110
Head to bed.

8208
04:14:25,270 --> 04:14:26,750
Because you deserve it.

8209
04:14:26,830 --> 04:14:28,050
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

8210
04:14:28,490 --> 04:14:29,090
Bye guys.

8211
04:14:29,590 --> 04:14:30,030
Bye.

8212
04:15:05,100 --> 04:15:05,900
Bye.

8213
04:15:05,900 --> 04:15:07,160
No problem.

8214
04:15:07,160 --> 04:15:07,580
She's asking me...
