1
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,100
Hey guys, where am I?

2
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,940
Where the fuck am I?

3
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,900
Oh, there I am.

4
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,500
Hey guys, I'm late to war apparently.

5
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,240
Apparently, there's a war...

6
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,060
The reason why I chose 1pm is that there is a great war going on.

7
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,260
The Great Russ War that I may or may not have started.

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,860
And I'm late.

9
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,270
It's like...

10
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,270
And the thing is, Gumi is not online to let me out of the house.

11
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,950
I knew it.

12
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,250
I knew it.

13
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,890
I knew it.

14
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,590
I was like, tell me the code, Gumi.

15
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,930
And she's like, no, I'll let you out.

16
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,730
I'll be online.

17
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,970
And she's not online.

18
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,890
I fucking... I did.

19
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,610
I knew it.

20
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,130
I knew she wasn't going to be online.

21
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,690
I was like, oh, there's no way.

22
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,170
I don't think she's going to be online.

23
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,110
There's no way.

24
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,110
And then like...

25
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,690
Oh my god.

26
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,270
Anyway, I'm trapped in the house.

27
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,610
And I have to slash kill so I can get out and be at the...

28
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,110
I have to fucking...

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,310
I have to...

30
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,850
No, nobody's on...

31
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,550
I don't live there.

32
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,890
I was like, oh man.

33
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,790
Just tell me the code, Gumi.

34
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,610
No.

35
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,090
I'll be there to let you out.

36
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,290
Fucking knew it.

37
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,190
I fucking knew she wouldn't be there to let me out.

38
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:29,440
I had a feeling.

39
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,860
I was like, I don't think she will be.

40
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,120
I was like, tomorrow's the last day of rest, Gumi.

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,740
Oh, wow.

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,680
Hello, hello.

43
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,560
Does anybody live down here?

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,260
Hello, I'm stuck.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,460
Please, let me out.

46
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,560
Please, I want to join the war.

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,940
Please.

48
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,380
Oh my god, please.

49
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,350
Oh my god.

50
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,710
Oh my god.

51
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,710
I can't.

52
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,190
I'm stuck here.

53
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,810
Well, time to slash kill.

54
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,850
There's nothing else to do.

55
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,570
Time to slash kill, guys.

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,730
Oh my god, goodbye.

57
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,150
I loot.

58
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,630
I fucking knew it.

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,890
I fucking...

60
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,570
Okay, there's a great war right here.

61
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,570
There's a ginormous wall right here.

62
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,750
War right here.

63
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,390
Hello.

64
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,130
Oh yeah, I'm late for the war.

65
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,970
I literally...

66
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,810
By the way, so like, that's why...

67
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,630
Oh shit.

68
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,210
Well, hello everybody.

69
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,010
I'm here for the war.

70
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,690
Wait, what?

71
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,950
You said you better wake up tomorrow.

72
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,790
And I actually woke up tomorrow.

73
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,130
Now you told me I should not have woke up.

74
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,610
Hey, I'm alive.

75
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,850
Yeah, sure.

76
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,810
Let me fucking gear up first.

77
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,970
Isn't there a war going on right now?

78
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,030
Oh, okay.

79
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,270
One man?

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,230
I thought this is two men.

81
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,390
Wait, who said...

82
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,590
Who told me to do this mission?

83
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,670
Who even told me to do this?

84
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,610
Who said that?

85
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:38,690
Yeah.

86
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,190
Alright, I am ready.

87
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,130
Oh, wait, are we?

88
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,870
Wait a minute.

89
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,010
Wait, wait, are we?

90
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,150
Yeah?

91
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,350
Wait.

92
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,030
Wait, wait a minute.

93
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,950
Wait a minute.

94
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,370
I think...

95
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,610
Wait, are you doing what I think you're doing?

96
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,030
Wait, are you...

97
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,650
Are you doing what I think you want to do?

98
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,550
Beast?

99
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,810
Are you?

100
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,010
Oh, my God!

101
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,890
Anyway, it's time to wait 188 seconds.

102
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
Okay.

103
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,140
Well, tomorrow I go.

104
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,400
I hate tomorrow I go.

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,140
Are we winning?

106
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,060
Are we...

107
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,500
Are we at least winning?

108
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,520
Alright, we got to wait 140 seconds, I guess.

109
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,540
I guess.

110
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,860
I hit another throne.

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Alright, long story short.

112
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,720
I was told that there was gonna be another war today.

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,600
And I had to get on at like 1 p.m.

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,860
But I didn't realize they were starting the war at exactly...

115
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,280
You know, I could've just gone here and ran over.

116
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,780
You know what?

117
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,300
Fuck it.

118
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,600
I'll just go over here and run over back home.

119
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,520
What is this base?

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Whose house am I in?

121
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
How...

122
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,500
Where am I?

123
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,710
Oh, fuck.

124
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,290
I don't...

125
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,830
You know what I said yesterday was a bad day?

126
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,890
Today's the bad day.

127
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,310
I lied.

128
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,770
It was actually today.

129
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,330
It was actually today.

130
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,030
Is that for the paratroopers?

131
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,830
Where the fuck are the parachutes?

132
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,170
How is there no parachutes?

133
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,530
Oh, and now everybody spawned there.

134
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,110
Like, how is there no parachutes on like a paratrooper land?

135
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,610
Like, I don't understand.

136
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,450
Like, I actually...

137
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,130
Alright.

138
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,630
Alright, anyway.

139
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,730
Anyway, I guess we got 40 seconds left.

140
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,610
So yeah, I was given a message that...

141
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,910
Remember to come online at 1pm for the Great War.

142
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,110
Great Rest War.

143
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,010
That we may or may not have started.

144
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,950
I swear, I felt like I saw people tweeting a picture of it.

145
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,150
But I did feel like the assassin of the Archduke.

146
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,330
It did feel like that.

147
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,270
The one person that started all of this.

148
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,430
I just took the shot.

149
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,090
And now there's the Great War that I unfortunately have to be part of now.

150
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,370
I think there's like 3 hours left of the rest of it.

151
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,290
So that's why I was like, you know what, fuck it, we might as well.

152
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,610
Like, cloth, armor.

153
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,430
Is there anything for me?

154
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,950
Where's our Lurkling outfits?

155
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,790
Oh no, did we run out of Lurkling outfits?

156
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,350
Okay, maybe...

157
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,950
Wait, no.

158
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:15,650
Cancel.

159
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,750
Alright, I wanna...

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,350
Do we have any more Lurkling outfits?

161
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,050
We don't.

162
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,070
Oh my god, what do we do?

163
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,430
Wait, what do we do now?

164
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,390
I took the only source of food.

165
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,730
Oh my god.

166
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,270
What do we do?

167
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,870
We don't have...

168
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,370
Well, do I go in there naked?

169
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,210
I don't know if I should take those...

170
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,170
That, I'll just wear this.

171
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,570
Like, they won't shoot me, right?

172
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,350
If I wear...

173
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,710
If I wear a non-Lurkling outfit.

174
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,190
I just wanna wear clothes.

175
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,230
They won't shoot me if I wear something that's like...

176
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,370
Unrelated to the Lurkling outfits.

177
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,070
Like, we don't have...

178
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,050
We ran out.

179
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,750
Are you...

180
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,950
Are you okay?

181
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,470
Are you okay over there?

182
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,770
Oh, she was not okay.

183
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,250
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,470
Not okay, but thanks for the meds though.

185
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,570
Thanks for the guns.

186
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,470
I really appreciate it.

187
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,230
That's unfortunate.

188
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,950
That she was not okay.

189
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,830
That's unfortunate.

190
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,030
That's unfortunate.

191
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,730
Whoa!

192
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,330
Bro, I don't know if I wanna go up there.

193
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,950
I'm a little scared.

194
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,090
I don't know if I wanna...

195
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,990
Oh my god, there's like the taxi.

196
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,390
There's...

197
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,570
Oh my god.

198
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,030
I'm scared.

199
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,050
It's

200
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,230
like...

201
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,470
I looked for only a second.

202
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,450
I...

203
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,210
Oh my god.

204
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,710
Are you... Fuck, I'm tired.

205
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,290
I looked away.

206
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,890
Was it dead?

207
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,010
I fucking knew it was...

208
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,010
Oh my... What the fuck is all of this?

209
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,150
Like, how do I get out?

210
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,490
Oh, that's how.

211
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:53,850
Okay.

212
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,610
There has to be parachutes, right?

213
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,770
Alright.

214
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,110
Oh my god, time to fucking loot...

215
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,670
Loot random shit here.

216
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,790
I just...

217
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,030
I just wanna live.

218
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,990
Oh my god.

219
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,170
I miss my old stuff.

220
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,350
Guys.

221
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,590
I think war is not cool.

222
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,010
Guys.

223
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,690
I don't know.

224
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,210
War might not be cool.

225
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,310
No way.

226
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,830
Guys, I just...

227
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,830
Just have a feeling that war might not be as cool as I thought it'd be.

228
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,070
I don't know.

229
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,830
Just a feeling.

230
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,330
Just a...

231
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:51,570
Just a feeling.

232
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,750
Just a little suspicion.

233
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,030
Oh.

234
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,530
Hey.

235
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,770
Wait, taxi guy?

236
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,490
Is that you?

237
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,670
Oh my god!

238
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,090
Taxi guy!

239
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,830
He shot...

240
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,890
He's shooting taxi guy!

241
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,870
He's shooting him!

242
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,050
No!

243
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,270
Taxi man!

244
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,590
Nobody is safe!

245
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,190
Not even...

246
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,350
Taxi man!

247
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,230
No one is safe!

248
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,630
No!

249
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,650
Not...

250
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,030
Taxi man!

251
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,270
Where the fuck is my fucking...

252
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,330
Did they take my loot?

253
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,310
They took my loot, didn't they?

254
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,930
They took it.

255
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,070
My body is gone.

256
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,490
My body is actually...

257
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,070
It's gone.

258
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,510
It's gone!

259
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,930
It's fucking gone!

260
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
Oh my god.

261
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,860
Is there anything?

262
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,560
I might as well not even grab loot.

263
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,740
I feel like I grab loot and I die.

264
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,480
I feel like...

265
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,060
I feel like I grab loot and then it's over.

266
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,360
It's alright.

267
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,660
Is he a bad guy?

268
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,180
Oh my god!

269
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,400
Wait, how do I reload this?

270
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,680
There we go.

271
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,040
Alright.

272
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,400
I could have shot him but I fucked up.

273
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,220
I didn't reload.

274
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,920
I...

275
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,660
Guys...

276
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,420
I don't know if I want to...

277
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,720
be up here.

278
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,260
Boomy, where were you?

279
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,740
I forgot to slash kill!

280
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,470
I knew I should have trusted you with my loot!

281
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,530
I fucking knew it!

282
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,310
I knew I should have trusted you with my loot!

283
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,970
If he was part of my team...

284
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,770
Well, too bad.

285
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,210
I knew it.

286
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,370
I can't!

287
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,370
I'm part of a...

288
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,970
I can't just respawn!

289
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,150
I'm literally fighting for my...

290
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,140
Fuck, okay.

291
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,700
This is not fair.

292
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,760
Why are we...

293
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,740
They have guns.

294
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
This is not fair.

295
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,840
They have...

296
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,640
I...

297
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,400
I wish...

298
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,720
I wish we had guns.

299
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,600
I...

300
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,040
I wish we had guns.

301
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,600
I will open this door...

302
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,500
and let them in.

303
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,700
I would...

304
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm dead.

305
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,600
What?

306
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,170
Oh, thank you.

307
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,510
No, I don't.

308
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,350
No, I don't.

309
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,830
They never gave it to me!

310
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,570
I never got it!

311
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,090
Wait, wait, wait.

312
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,810
Wait, hold on.

313
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,210
Doki, does it say Peacekeeper on the top, right?

314
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,270
No, it doesn't.

315
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,710
Yeah, then you're good.

316
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,410
You can take guns.

317
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,430
Oh my god, thank fucking god!

318
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,190
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

319
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,590
Yeah.

320
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,370
Oh my god.

321
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,290
I can finally use guns.

322
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,970
Oh my god, thank god.

323
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,530
I can finally...

324
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,850
Can I get an AK?

325
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,860
There is hope.

326
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm here.

327
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,480
Here's one set.

328
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,340
You can use this.

329
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,860
It's the Great Ted War.

330
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
Yeah, I know!

331
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,320
I got killed by Ted several times!

332
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,900
I know!

333
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,940
Dude, it's the Great Ted War.

334
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,280
It's happening.

335
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,520
Okay, nevermind.

336
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,540
Yeah, yeah, nice.

337
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,580
Oh my god.

338
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,620
The ammo are up here.

339
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,380
Where's ammo?

340
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,600
Okay, nice.

341
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,340
Guys, which one's the AK ammo?

342
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,300
Is it the rifle?

343
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,980
It has to be the rifle, right?

344
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,700
Yeah.

345
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,140
Alright.

346
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,720
Wait, how do I change the skin of the gun?

347
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,670
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:04,890
Hey!

349
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,430
Oh my god, I finally have a gun.

350
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,620
Oh, okay.

351
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,860
Yeah.

352
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Nice.

353
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,260
Alright, nice.

354
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,100
You wanna see my gun?

355
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,700
I got dropped just for it.

356
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,360
Look at this.

357
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,560
Look at this.

358
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,300
It's me.

359
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,760
It's me.

360
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,620
Yeah, you got my gun too!

361
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,480
Let's go!

362
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh my god!

363
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,080
That's me!

364
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,920
So why are we at war again?

365
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,400
Why?

366
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,320
Oh my god, I got to see it.

368
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,820
Guys, if you watch one hour of my stream, you get this gun.

369
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,040
Guys, you just need to watch one hour.

370
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,200
What are you guys doing?

371
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,700
We have to get back into battle!

372
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,420
Our enemies!

373
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,740
There's so many!

374
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
But, Shaggy, this is my gun.

375
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,360
Okay, okay, okay, Shaggy.

376
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,160
But look, look.

377
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,100
This is my gun.

378
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,180
It has my face on it.

00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,310
What the fuck?

720
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,140
Where's your car?

721
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:52,720
Did you die?

722
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,780
Oh, did you drive to the war?

723
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:54,820
Did you drive to the war?

724
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,280
Did you accidentally bump into war?

725
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,020
Where did your car...

726
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,480
Wait, but you said you had a cute car.

727
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,620
Do you want me to pick you up or not?

728
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,460
Oh yeah, yeah.

729
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:05,920
Pick me up.

730
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,420
I'm done.

731
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,380
I'm done with the war.

732
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,200
It's at home.

733
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,040
Is the war about to end, though?

734
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,240
I'm just a wife supporting her husband.

735
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,280
Is the war almost ending?

736
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,540
I think the war is about to end anyway.

737
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:18,880
What the fuck, man?

738
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,920
I'm gonna fucking blow the fuck up.

739
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,140
Thank you.

740
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,820
I need a 510 and kill him.

741
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,140
I'm coming to you, Shaggy.

742
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:32,840
Fuck you.

743
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,920
I need a 510 and kill him.

744
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,340
What the fuck is going on here?

745
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,120
Where's the landmine, Shaggy?

746
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,340
Where's the landmine?

747
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,560
Donkey, donkey, come here.

748
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,020
Donkey, come to me.

749
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,660
What happened?

750
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:50,380
Why?

751
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,120
Okay, I'm never trusting you guys again.

752
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,280
I'm never trusting any of you guys again.

753
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,340
I need to go get meds.

754
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,780
I can't believe it.

755
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,780
I can't believe they almost baited me.

756
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,260
I can't believe it.

757
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,100
Hide in bushes.

758
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,540
Shoot air.

759
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,420
What?

760
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,180
How did I get outside?

761
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,920
Okay, we need...

762
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,470
Alright, we need to grab...

763
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,020
Please.

764
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,040
Please, for the love of God.

765
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,920
Just move one centimeter.

766
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,460
Just...

767
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,260
No!

768
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,940
No!

769
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,540
No more!

770
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,140
Oh, there's bandages though.

771
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,920
Is this allowed?

772
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,920
It's over.

773
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,940
I don't care if it's allowed.

774
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,680
It's our time to shine.

775
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,880
We're gonna slowly bandage up.

776
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,420
It's over.

777
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,840
I will die with my loot.

778
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,060
It's over.

779
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,600
But I will make sure no...

780
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,860
I will die with all of this.

781
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,880
Can I reload this here?

782
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,380
What ammo does this take?

783
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,620
What the fuck ammo does this take?

784
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,940
Maybe they're for battle.

785
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,500
They're battle rocks.

786
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,060
I wanna see a battle rock.

787
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Wait, what's the battle rock?

788
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,460
Take this.

789
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,540
Take the battle rocks.

790
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,660
I think...

791
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,260
I think War broke this guy.

792
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,800
Go with you into war.

793
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,380
I think he's broken, guys.

794
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,720
He just...

795
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,080
I think War fucked him up, guys.

796
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,840
I think...

797
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,360
What are you gonna do?

798
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,100
Are you really gonna kill your own fellow lurkling?

799
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,240
Are you really?

800
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,400
Are you really?

801
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,760
Shoot it inside our base.

802
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,860
No, Shacky, do it.

803
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,540
Shoot it inside this base.

804
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,480
Do it.

805
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,400
Don't be a fucking pussy.

806
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,940
You've always been a...

807
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,550
I knew you were real.

808
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:45,830
I'm the realest.

809
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:49,330
How the fuck did you survive?

810
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,550
I'm the realest.

811
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,110
I'm the realest.

812
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,750
I knew you weren't a pussy.

813
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,280
I knew you weren't a pussy, Shacky.

814
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,780
I fucking knew it.

815
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,980
I knew you weren't a pussy.

816
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,320
How can I be a pussy?

817
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,620
How can I be a pussy?

818
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,760
Alright, I got some scraps.

819
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,520
So that means it's gamble time.

820
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,460
It's RP.

821
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,580
Is that a type of chips?

822
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:30,740
Alright.

823
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,200
When does the war end, guys?

824
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:33,940
When?

825
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,600
When does the war end?

826
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:37,900
Donkey, come on.

827
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,640
Donkey, we have to go to war.

828
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,060
But when does it end?

829
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:43,980
Let's go.

830
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,340
But when does it end?

831
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,520
It will end when we win.

832
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,660
But like, are we winning?

833
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,220
Are we winning, though?

834
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,640
Charge!

835
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,540
I think he's gonna die.

836
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,080
Oh no, I'm Witty, I'm Witty.

837
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,520
I'm Poggerian, Poggerian.

838
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,900
Wait, wait, what about this?

839
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,560
Oh god.

840
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,860
Oh god.

841
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:14,520
Hey.

842
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,000
Okay.

843
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,100
Okay.

844
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,920
Where did you go?

845
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,680
Alright, guys.

846
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,220
Guys, it's time.

847
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,780
It's time for me.

848
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,620
It's time for me to go to the safe haven.

849
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,840
I'm heading to the safe haven, chat.

850
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,780
I'm heading to the safe haven.

851
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,520
It's time.

852
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,720
I'm done.

853
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,560
I'm going to where I know is safe.

854
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,180
I'm gonna...

855
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,500
I'm gonna go to the safe haven.

856
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,540
And gamba.

857
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,060
Be a hero and shoot and fight?

858
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,740
I've been a hero this entire...

859
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,700
I've died so many times.

860
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,500
I'm done.

861
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,400
I'm going to sanctuary.

862
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,340
I'm going to sanctuary now.

863
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,280
I'm tired of war.

864
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,660
I'm so tired.

865
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:40,140
I can't.

866
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,980
I can't keep doing...

867
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,940
That's an auto turret.

868
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:45,600
Wait.

869
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,860
How do I cross this area?

870
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,620
How do I cross the land?

871
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,180
There's nowhere to cross.

872
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,140
Everywhere I go is dangerous.

873
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,960
There's no escape.

874
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,840
There's actual no escape.

875
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,300
They've like locked it down.

876
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,060
They've actually locked it down.

877
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:15,800
No.

878
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,840
I wanna be a refugee.

879
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,320
No.

880
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,220
Hey Twinkles.

881
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,480
I'm heading to...

882
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,540
There's a sanctuary for refugees from war.

883
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,580
I'm heading there.

884
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,760
Yes.

885
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,520
There is.

886
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:37,120
No, I didn't abandon you.

887
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,880
I'm just checking out who's betraying us in the sanctuary.

888
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,020
I'm just checking who's there.

889
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,020
So I can shoot them down with this gun.

890
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,420
Wow.

891
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,220
Wow.

892
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,640
I'm fucking running.

893
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:56,840
I'm running.

894
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,280
I'll remember you Twinkles.

895
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,830
I'll remember him.

896
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,710
I'll remember him.

897
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:11,990
This area isn't safe.

898
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,150
It's not safe.

899
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,510
Oh my god.

900
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,010
Oh my god.

901
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,650
I have to go to the sanctuary.

902
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,190
I have to go.

903
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,760
I need to find a place.

904
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,240
Hello?

905
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,240
Are you...

906
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,560
Grandma, do you have heels?

907
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,040
Granny?

908
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,340
Granny?

909
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,140
Grandma, do you have heels?

910
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,440
Do you have heels, Granny?

911
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,890
Oh, okay.

912
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:50,910
Goodbye, Granny.

913
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,150
I'm abandoned?

914
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,690
No!

915
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,890
I'll never be able...

916
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,430
I've committed too much crime.

917
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:04,730
I've...

918
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:12,270
I've committed too much crime.

919
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,950
I've done too much.

920
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,810
I've killed too much.

921
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,210
Oh, no.

922
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,990
Oh, no.

923
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,070
I've done too much crime.

924
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,730
So now I have to...

925
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,750
I have to...

926
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,450
Please, please.

927
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:38,350
I'm a good person.

928
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:39,330
I'm a good person.

929
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:39,730
Please.

930
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:40,450
No!

931
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,930
Please.

932
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,170
I was a refugee.

933
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:44,810
No!

934
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,530
I was a refugee.

935
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,150
I just...

936
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,050
No.

937
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,050
No, my mini cannot...

938
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,530
No, there's no escape.

939
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,790
I just...

940
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,650
I just want to hold my gun.

941
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,130
It's literally my gun.

942
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:12,050
Is that too much to ask?

943
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,890
I think I lost, like, 40 of, like, a lot of our guns.

944
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:15,790
I'm so sorry.

945
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:23,770
Like, is there no way that's safe?

946
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,510
I was also, like, 8 HP too, guys.

947
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:32,110
I'm sorry.

948
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:32,850
I'm just, like, Saekundo.

949
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,790
I'm just, like, Saekundo.

950
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,480
Oh, hey!

951
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,100
Isn't this the...

952
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,620
Wait, this is the...

953
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,900
This is the other rock.

954
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:49,820
Look.

955
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,120
Oh, this is the other rock.

956
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,480
Is there, like, any food?

957
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:54,340
There is, still.

958
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,060
Alright.

959
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,180
I'm at...

960
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,120
Where am I?

961
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,900
M9.

962
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,930
It's not safe outside.

963
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,330
I've died.

964
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:18,170
I can't... war is everywhere.

965
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,330
War is everywhere.

966
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,010
There's nowhere I can go.

967
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,940
What if I take the shot right now?

968
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,200
What if I take a shot right now?

969
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,160
Right here.

970
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:49,130
Just like the assassin of the archduke.

971
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,190
They'll never know what happened.

972
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,800
They'll never know who took that shot.

973
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,740
They'll never know.

974
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,980
They'll never know who took that shot.

975
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,660
Who could it have been?

976
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,910
That one shot triggers the entire...

977
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,080
What's going on over there?

978
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,360
Is he okay?

979
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,320
Are you fucking serious?

980
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,500
They'll never know who shot the gun.

981
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,460
Hello!

982
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,740
Who are you looking for?

983
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,300
Yeah, who are you looking for?

984
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,420
Thank you.

985
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,680
I'm not looking for anybody.

986
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,680
I'm a journalist.

987
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:05,900
You're a journalist?

988
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:07,640
Foolish!

989
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,460
Foolish!

990
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,720
War does not agree with me.

991
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,360
They are not going to respect your journalist ways.

992
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,320
They are not going to respect that.

993
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:15,960
No, no, no.

994
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,660
I was a fellow journalist once.

995
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,440
I was a fellow journalist.

996
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,820
I love shooting journalists.

997
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,440
I love shooting them.

998
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,160
Okay, well, he doesn't respect them.

999
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,440
Anyone may kill you.

1000
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,940
Yeah, I know.

1001
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,400
I ran up to Sykkuno.

1002
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,820
He shot me and then said, No, Tina!

1003
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,720
It's Sykkuno.

1004
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,560
So how's the...

1005
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,480
Wait, if you're a journalist, why aren't you in the deep of it?

1006
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,900
It's so weird.

1007
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,240
Oh my god.

1008
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,100
If you're a journalist, Tina, why aren't you there in the midst of all the other war going on?

1009
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:55,900
Close the door.

1010
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,100
Because they keep killing me!

1011
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,720
I've never made it past it.

1012
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,280
You've never made it past it.

1013
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,440
Tina!

1014
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,280
You're okay!

1015
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,580
Stand still!

1016
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,880
Have you told them you're a journalist?

1017
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,040
Follow me!

1018
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,220
Let's go!

1019
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,680
Wait, I just...

1020
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,720
Oh...

1021
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,900
It is our time, Lurklings.

1022
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,880
It is our time.

1023
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:42,040
What is it time for?

1024
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,240
We're gonna sit on the throne!

1025
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,580
We're gonna sit on the throne!

1026
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,480
We're gonna sit on the throne!

1027
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,740
You guys have nothing!

1028
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,040
You guys have nothing!

1029
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,520
Where's the smoke?

1030
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,340
Where's the smoke?

1031
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,560
Oh my god, Ted!

1032
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,320
Oh my god, Ted!

1033
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,280
Alright, they can sit on the throne for all they want.

1034
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,120
I don't think they made it.

1035
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,620
Alright, I'll show you why I think they didn't make it.

1036
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,740
Alright, watch this.

1037
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,580
Wait, they're actually making it!

1038
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,600
Wait, they're making it!

1039
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,880
Wait a minute!

1040
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,080
They're actually making it!

1041
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,700
Oh my god!

1042
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,740
Wait!

1043
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,280
Wait, I think...

1044
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,920
I think Louch sat on the throne!

1045
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,280
Oh my...

1046
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,280
Oh my god, please.

1047
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,080
Who the fuck shot...

1048
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,380
Who the fuck shot us?

1049
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,400
Yeah, they did.

1050
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,120
I don't think they shot...

1051
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,460
I don't think they got the throne.

1052
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,140
I don't think the Lurklings sat on the throne.

1053
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:15,620
Wait,

1054
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,080
you almost got it?!

1055
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,300
Wait, you could've been him!

1056
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,780
You could've been him!

1057
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,520
That could've been you!

1058
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,660
Get another...

1059
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,820
Get another parachute!

1060
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,980
Go over there, get another parachute!

1061
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,360
Oh, I believe in you.

1062
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,620
I know you got this.

1063
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,380
Did you touch the throne?

1064
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,820
Oh no, wait!

1065
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,560
They made it!

1066
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,960
They made it to the throne!

1067
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,380
Oh, we're doing another push.

1068
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,780
I think you gotta stop going in there.

1069
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,280
God, I am in pain!

1070
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,480
My ass!

1071
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,840
My ass!

1072
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,920
Did any...

1073
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,420
Did any Lurkling even touch the throne?

1074
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,280
Oh, I'm sorry, it's the last cause.

1075
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,960
It's the last cause.

1076
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,600
Maybe I'll get to see it.

1077
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,900
Maybe I'll get to see it.

1078
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,020
We're gonna touch the throne!

1079
01:13:59,020 --> 01:13:59,760
We're gonna touch the throne!

1080
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,980
We're gonna touch the throne!

1081
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,200
Why are you shooting me?

1082
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,440
NOOOOOO!

1083
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,320
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT THE THRONE!

1084
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,040
I saw it from...

1085
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,980
Oh my god, okay, I can't.

1086
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,700
I'm gonna run in, I'm gonna run straight in.

1087
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,260
It's fine.

1088
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,640
I just wanna know what the throne looks like.

1089
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,220
That's it.

1090
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,040
LM is an...

1091
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,200
LM is an ass.

1092
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,620
He does not represent Lurklings.

1093
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,400
What the fuck?

1094
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,060
Why is there...

1095
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,740
Okay, no wonder they got off this motorcycle.

1096
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,150
No, please, let me at least see...

1097
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,370
NO, PLEASE!

1098
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,750
LET ME AT LEAST SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!

1099
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:02,310
I JUST...

1100
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:03,750
I'm gonna take that bike.

1101
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:05,870
I'm gonna take that bike and I'm gonna ride it in.

1102
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:08,270
That's it.

1103
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,390
That's it.

1104
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,090
I'm gonna...

1105
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,490
I'm gonna ride that bike in.

1106
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,230
I don't care anymore.

1107
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:18,450
I don't care anymore.

1108
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:22,390
I'm gonna take that bike and I'm gonna ride it in.

1109
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:23,470
I just...

1110
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,750
I wanna know what it looks like.

1111
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,530
I thought about it.

1112
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,910
I thought about it.

1113
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:32,010
And I was like, oh man, that seems dumb.

1114
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:36,950
I was like...

1115
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:39,090
Nah, that seems like a dumb thing to do.

1116
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,450
But now I'm like, nothing is dumb in this world anymore.

1117
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:44,870
Nothing is dumb anymore.

1118
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,530
Everything is freaky.

1119
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,930
Nothing is dumb in this world.

1120
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,590
Everything is matters.

1121
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,390
Where's that bike?

1122
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:01,810
Where is it?

1123
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:03,970
Where is it?

1124
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:04,810
Where did I leave the bike?

1125
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,790
The bike is gone!

1126
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,030
No, it's right here.

1127
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,280
I'm lagging so much they won't know.

1128
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,860
Oh my god!

1129
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,280
I'm sorry!

1130
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:35,900
I'm sorry!

1131
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:46,950
Holy shit!

1132
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,150
Oh my god!

1133
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,500
I'm fucking alright.

1134
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,700
Well...

1135
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,440
I've too far gone from...

1136
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,950
I wonder why it's lagging.

1137
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,520
Oh my god!

1138
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,520
I knew the bike was it.

1139
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,420
I saw it.

1140
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,280
I'm done.

1141
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,180
I'm done with the war now.

1142
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,440
I saw...

1143
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,720
I've seen it.

1144
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:30,800
No!

1145
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,420
Now that I've seen it...

1146
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,000
I don't need to try again.

1147
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,720
Okay, but like...

1148
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,840
Wait, where am I?

1149
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,320
Wait, whose house is this?

1150
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,140
Wait a minute.

1151
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,680
Whose house is this?

1152
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,400
Is this also ours?

1153
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,140
Oh, it is.

1154
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,560
Okay, but what if I sit on it?

1155
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,180
Wait, you're right.

1156
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,480
Guys, what if I sit on that house?

1157
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,180
Guys, you're right, guys.

1158
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,320
I'm so foolish.

1159
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,500
Let me...

1160
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,580
Guys, now that I saw it, I need to sit on it.

1161
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:07,880
I understand now.

1162
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,020
I...

1163
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,240
I...

1164
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,200
I understand now, guys.

1165
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,140
Now I know.

1166
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,800
Now I know.

1167
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,820
I have a reason to fight now, exactly.

1168
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,520
I have a reason.

1169
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:33,920
Woah, hey.

1170
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,760
Hey there.

1171
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:39,780
Hey.

1172
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1173
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,520
Oh my god.

1174
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,700
Oh my god.

1175
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,800
Is nowhere safe?

1176
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,840
Guys, I don't think anywhere is safe anymore.

1177
01:18:59,180 --> 01:18:59,820
It's...

1178
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,240
Guys, this...

1179
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,040
This doesn't...

1180
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,260
Guys, this...

1181
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,180
Woah.

1182
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,320
This feels dangerous.

1183
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,880
Are you having fun?

1184
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,060
Are you having fun?

1185
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,660
I'm innocent, I'm innocent, I'm innocent.

1186
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,820
Can I have a turn?

1187
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,420
Can I have a turn?

1188
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,720
Please, please, please.

1189
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:35,940
Oh no!

1190
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,000
I hid in there for so long.

1191
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,360
I hid in there for so...

1192
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,220
I almost got it.

1193
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,820
I just hid in there.

1194
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,200
I just kept shooting.

1195
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,380
Woah.

1196
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,600
How did he...

1197
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,020
How did he survive three headshots?

1198
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,240
Is it because of the lag?

1199
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,320
It's always a lag.

1200
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,740
It's always a fucking lag.

1201
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:02,800
How did he survive?

1202
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,780
I couldn't use the shotgun!

1203
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:06,660
There was no ammo!

1204
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,280
There was no ammo, I swear to god.

1205
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,500
If I could, I would.

1206
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,860
Guys, I literally, like, looked at it.

1207
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,680
And was like, there's no ammo.

1208
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,840
Where's Zarcudo?

1209
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,060
They're alive?

1210
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,200
Goodbye, grandma.

1211
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,480
No.

1212
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,180
No, I got hit by a random shot.

1213
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1214
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:32,680
No!

1215
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,640
Wait,

1216
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:40,710
where is this?

1217
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:42,870
Wait, where am I?

1218
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:44,330
Oh, it's back here.

1219
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,030
Oh my god.

1220
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,130
I just hear Zarcudo in the distance.

1221
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,430
It's my AK now.

1222
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,890
I can't believe it.

1223
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:57,890
Oh my god.

1224
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:59,790
We know who's gonna win anyway!

1225
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:04,090
There's no way anybody else was gonna win this throne.

1226
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:09,950
There's no way.

1227
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:13,210
Like, we saw the leaderboards.

1228
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:14,690
Who else is gonna win?

1229
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:15,550
Nobody.

1230
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,990
Oh my god.

1231
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,370
I can't believe it.

1232
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,830
I'll never...

1233
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,630
I saw the throne.

1234
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,630
I was so close.

1235
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,470
I was so close.

1236
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,490
I was so close.

1237
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,710
I can't go to the war sanctuary because I'm red named.

1238
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:42,170
I can't even...

1239
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:44,910
I can't even go to the fucking sanctuary.

1240
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,050
That's how fucked up it is.

1241
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,470
I'm too evil.

1242
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:53,610
I've done so many evil things that I can't...

1243
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:58,390
I've done...

1244
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,770
What?

1245
01:21:59,050 --> 01:21:59,450
No!

1246
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:07,190
I've done too much evil.

1247
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:10,890
I've done too much evil things.

1248
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:12,830
I can't even hide.

1249
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:19,050
I've committed too much crime.

1250
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:22,530
Oh my god.

1251
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,830
I'm a red named.

1252
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:28,790
I'm a filthy red named now.

1253
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:30,190
I can't.

1254
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:35,930
I did too much war crime that the sanctuary won't even accept me.

1255
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,270
They won't even accept me.

1256
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,670
All I can do is just fight.

1257
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:44,930
That's it.

1258
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:49,950
Too much sin.

1259
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:53,990
Too much sin was committed.

1260
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:58,750
Please forgive me for the war I started.

1261
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,240
I have no choice.

1262
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,260
Guys, I have to.

1263
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,240
I can't go to anywhere.

1264
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,420
I'm condemned to the meat grinder.

1265
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,160
I miss Taxi Man.

1266
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,180
I wish Taxi Man could pick me up.

1267
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,100
I wish I wish Taxi Man could pick me up.

1268
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,420
So I could be up there in the sky.

1269
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,280
Be up there in the sky.

1270
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,120
I just got here!

1271
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,240
Hey, what's up?

1272
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:49,880
How's it going?

1273
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,700
I wanted to go to...

1274
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,400
Oh, shit.

1275
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,160
Yeah.

1276
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,480
Yeah, we want a sexy chat agent.

1277
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,500
We want to try something real quick.

1278
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,120
It's not a sexual thing.

1279
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,600
I swear to God.

1280
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,860
Click on him when his hands are in the air.

1281
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,460
There you go.

1282
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:16,800
Nice.

1283
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:21,960
Alright.

1284
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,340
Now you go in there and die.

1285
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,700
Come check out our new pet.

1286
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,180
Look at this.

1287
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:29,940
Wow.

1288
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,820
You gotta run in there.

1289
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,700
Yeah, throne rush!

1290
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,140
Boy, they're shooting a handcuff guy.

1291
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:38,840
Surely not.

1292
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:39,640
Surely not.

1293
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,400
No, they shot at everybody but the handcuff.

1294
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,540
Wait, you can't?

1295
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,080
You can't?

1296
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:45,800
Oh, you can.

1297
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,500
Oh, thank God.

1298
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,920
I was like, oh my God, no.

1299
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,880
Alright, mine now.

1300
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,640
Wait, how did you get knocked?

1301
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,140
Oh no, we both committed too much crime.

1302
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,020
We both committed too much crime.

1303
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,000
They'll never let us leave.

1304
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,820
Alright, I believe.

1305
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:11,380
I believe.

1306
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,500
You go first.

1307
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,680
Let them know you're coming.

1308
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,360
Now go to the other side.

1309
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,040
Don't go the other side.

1310
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,400
Oh my God.

1311
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,940
Can I not have one thing?

1312
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,240
Like, just one.

1313
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,960
Every time.

1314
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,280
Every fucking time.

1315
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:08,880
Oh my God.

1316
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:09,280
What?

1317
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:11,480
What?

1318
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:12,080
What?

1319
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,300
What?

1320
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,440
Oh, it's him.

1321
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,400
It's still him.

1322
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:16,740
Okay.

1323
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:19,960
What?

1324
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,960
I thought she was a journalist.

1325
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:27,520
I thought she was supposed to be a journalist.

1326
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,900
How did she turn red name?

1327
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,120
I thought she was supposed to be a journalist.

1328
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:35,220
What happened?

1329
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,840
What the fuck happened?

1330
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,700
Oh my God.

1331
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:43,940
Oh my God.

1332
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:45,280
Wait, I think somebody...

1333
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,320
This is someone's car.

1334
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,460
Oh, it's...

1335
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,380
Fuck, no.

1336
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:54,780
Okay.

1337
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,740
Alright, this is it.

1338
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,800
We're doing it.

1339
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:01,460
We're apparently... Wait, what?

1340
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,840
Guys, did you guys all die?

1341
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,010
Wait.

1342
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1343
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:14,230
Is it time to rush?

1344
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:15,150
Hello.

1345
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,290
Is it throne rush time?

1346
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,860
I'm gonna rush in with my rock.

1347
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,020
I'm gonna totally go out.

1348
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:37,660
Hello.

1349
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,400
How are you?

1350
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,400
Have we not sat on a throne once?

1351
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,300
Have we?

1352
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,320
Guys, I think I joined...

1353
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,980
I definitely joined the wrong clan.

1354
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:50,980
Hello.

1355
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,160
I need to be...

1356
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,120
Oh, I think we're already ended.

1357
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,240
Cry.

1358
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,240
Guys, I don't think we should stick together.

1359
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,440
It's like the easiest mode to have all games.

1360
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,300
We're dead.

1361
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,260
I can't see anything.

1362
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:36,880
Over here.

1363
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,740
Can't see anything.

1364
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,980
Guys, guys, where's grandma?

1365
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:52,450
Oh my god, I'm heading over.

1366
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:00,350
No!

1367
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:05,850
I saw it though!

1368
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:07,490
I saw it!

1369
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:14,010
Oh my god, look at all their... Oh my god, they're all dying!

1370
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:17,810
Holy shit!

1371
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:23,210
Oh my god, from 20 to like 4, I was there.

1372
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,600
I think one of us should've had a gun.

1373
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,480
I think...

1374
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,880
I think if one of us had a gun, things would've been a little easier.

1375
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,540
That's all I'll say.

1376
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,800
I was there.

1377
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:41,580
I was there.

1378
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:44,880
I didn't shoot anybody for 20 years!

1379
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,320
How am I still dangerous?

1380
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:50,920
I don't understand.

1381
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,260
I... I don't understand.

1382
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:01,540
I was like... How am I... I haven't... I haven't killed anybody for so long.

1383
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,820
But I can't even go to the refugee area.

1384
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,260
I... I don't understand.

1385
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,840
How long has this battle been?

1386
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,360
I'm done!

1387
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,980
I'm so done!

1388
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:24,950
I just... I just want this to be over.

1389
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,210
I... I feel like...

1390
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:33,670
I feel like it's never gonna end.

1391
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:44,990
But I got some cool-ass gear though.

1392
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,970
Like, do you think it'll let me, like, sit there?

1393
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:59,830
Do you think it'll let me...

1394
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:07,470
Do you think... Do you think the Wakhani... Who's in the Wakhanian tribe?

1395
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:09,410
Who's in there?

1396
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,830
Do you think...

1397
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:13,990
The Lurklings have touched the throne?

1398
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,390
Who's in the Wakhan...

1399
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,580
Oh, this way we go.

1400
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:31,580
Who's... Who's in the Wakhanian...

1401
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,300
We're not even on the leaderboards!

1402
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,340
We're not even there!

1403
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,180
I'm done.

1404
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,980
I'm done with war again.

1405
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,400
I'm done with war.

1406
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,580
I'm done with it.

1407
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:55,820
So, we touched the throne.

1408
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:56,920
Now what?

1409
01:31:59,080 --> 01:31:59,940
Is it over?

1410
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:04,840
I mean, we got our goal.

1411
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:05,500
Yeah.

1412
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:06,780
Yeah, that was the whole point.

1413
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,420
Like, why should we throw our bodies at it if we just... if we touched it?

1414
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,020
Do we just go home now?

1415
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,660
Yeah, but I still have some fire arrows.

1416
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,700
I mean, I kind of want to go in there.

1417
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,520
Yeah, you go in there and do some poking.

1418
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:20,920
Yeah, yeah.

1419
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,160
Yeah, I guess we go.

1420
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,680
I guess, guys, we go home now.

1421
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,360
I'm done with war.

1422
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,140
I'm... I'm going home.

1423
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,000
Guess war is over.

1424
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,340
Yeah, maybe we go home now.

1425
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,840
I'm done with war.

1426
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,100
With what?

1427
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:57,340
I'm done 20 plus times for a war where we're not...

1428
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,750
Oh, nearby M10.

1429
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:16,690
Where's M10?

1430
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,760
Where's M10?

1431
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,280
Oh, he's back there.

1432
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,500
Are you fucking serious?

1433
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,040
I have to go past this.

1434
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,860
I have to go... Oh, my God.

1435
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,840
I have to go run past this.

1436
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:38,450
I have to go from here.

1437
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:42,690
War is over.

1438
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,710
It's time to gamble.

1439
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,330
I'm done.

1440
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:51,050
I'm done.

1441
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:52,710
I'm actually done.

1442
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:59,610
I'm going to see if I can join... I'm going to see if I can join Wekanian or whatever it's called.

1443
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:05,590
It's the only thing that's keeping me alive right now.

1444
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:12,230
I'm ready to see if I... No!

1445
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:12,950
What?

1446
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,070
Are you... It's like shooting a child.

1447
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:21,910
That man literally shot a fucking naked child.

1448
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:23,390
Man.

1449
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:26,950
It's okay.

1450
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:29,410
I needed to be here anyway so I could grab my gun.

1451
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:33,230
This time, I won't die with it for real.

1452
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:36,990
Guys, I can't die with it this time because I'm a refugee.

1453
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:40,550
I'm literally a refugee, guys.

1454
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,210
Well, not literally.

1455
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:43,310
Please don't take this out.

1456
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,430
I'm sorry.

1457
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:45,330
I don't mean that.

1458
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:49,890
I actually... I meant like... I'm... I'm... In rest.

1459
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:50,710
In rest.

1460
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:51,870
In rest.

1461
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,270
Wait, we don't have rifle and bullet right now.

1462
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:56,250
We don't have rifle and ammo.

1463
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:57,010
Oh no.

1464
01:34:58,090 --> 01:34:59,110
Oh no.

1465
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:04,390
Wait, did we do... Oh my god, I knew it.

1466
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,050
I knew it.

1467
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,370
I knew there was one.

1468
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:09,150
In rest.

1469
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,890
In rest.

1470
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:14,910
Let's see.

1471
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:14,990
Let's see.

1472
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,430
I'll reskin my gun.

1473
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,130
There we go.

1474
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,620
Okay.

1475
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,200
Oh.

1476
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:36,280
Oh, wait.

1477
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:36,940
She is?

1478
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:42,950
M10 is like here.

1479
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:48,050
Gumi?

1480
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,410
Wait, where's Gumi?

1481
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:52,770
Gumi!

1482
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:56,910
Is that her car?

1483
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:59,990
She said she's at M10.

1484
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,630
She's at the Coliseum?

1485
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:03,410
Okay.

1486
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,830
She's over there, yeah.

1487
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:05,590
Alright.

1488
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,470
Wait, someone just crashed right here.

1489
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:08,690
Oh, shit.

1490
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,210
What the fuck happened here?

1491
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:11,410
The fuck?

1492
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:15,110
Oh my god, I just love you.

1493
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:17,010
Alright.

1494
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,930
Where is she?

1495
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:25,650
What the fuck?

1496
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:26,630
Gumi!

1497
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:30,290
Gumi!

1498
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:44,860
Gumi!

1499
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,020
Gumi, where are you?

1500
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:50,720
I'm scared.

1501
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,140
Gumi!

1502
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,180
Gumi, look what I stole!

1503
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,080
I stole this.

1504
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,740
Let's go!

1505
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,340
Alright, let's go.

1506
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:02,860
Free bike.

1507
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:03,640
Let's go.

1508
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,260
I'll follow you.

1509
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,860
I'm like a war criminal, so will I be safe?

1510
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:17,340
I was not safe.

1511
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:21,260
I was absolutely...

1512
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,780
Gumi, what...

1513
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,500
Gumi, Gumi.

1514
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,060
Gumi, where's my gun?

1515
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,000
Where's my bike that I stole?

1516
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,180
Where's my bike?

1517
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,100
You could have kept going.

1518
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:07,800
You could have.

1519
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,580
Oh my god.

1520
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,340
I couldn't have been able to hear you!

1521
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,880
I can't believe you did that to me.

1522
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,820
Gumi, your car is breaking down.

1523
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,860
Gumi, you're...

1524
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:26,180
Gumi, I don't think I trust you as a driver.

1525
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,500
It's not my fault.

1526
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,460
It's because the server is so laggy with the war.

1527
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,880
No, it's pretty bad.

1528
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,060
No, there's a reason why.

1529
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,500
You know why it's so laggy?

1530
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,460
Because there's a million fucking...

1531
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,300
There's a million bodies at the throne.

1532
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,580
I saw the throne for like...

1533
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,220
2 seconds maximum.

1534
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,320
There's a million bodies down there that's lagging everything.

1535
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,460
Like, once I get near the throne, it's awful.

1536
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:01,880
Yeah, anyway.

1537
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,580
How do I join the house of Wakanian?

1538
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:07,280
Are you in that house?

1539
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:13,100
No, but we could drive down to it and request to join it.

1540
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,940
Yeah, yeah, let's go over there right now.

1541
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,800
I think... Let's go over there.

1542
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:20,380
We have to stop by at home so I can fix the car.

1543
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:21,260
Okay, yeah, sure.

1544
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:21,820
No problem.

1545
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,800
By the way, they're winning the war.

1546
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:30,200
So I feel like if we want to make it in the new Rust world, I feel like we should be in that clan.

1547
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,140
Like, you know, I just...

1548
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:39,920
In the future, I don't want to get killed off because of being part of the wrong area.

1549
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:41,600
And you know, winners write the history.

1550
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,720
So like, if we were part of the winners, then like...

1551
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,080
Then we'd be part of history.

1552
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:52,430
Yeah, you're right.

1553
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:56,030
Yeah, we gotta be on the winning team, Gumi.

1554
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:03,310
Like, in the end, we were never like loyal to a particular clan.

1555
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:04,550
Well, obviously not.

1556
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,810
You ditched the Lurklings on day one.

1557
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:13,050
You literally... You ditched the Lurklings.

1558
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:15,410
They were going to use wood for so long?

1559
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:18,310
No, but on the last day, we got the guns.

1560
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:20,430
You see my gun?

1561
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:21,630
You wanna know what gun this is?

1562
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:22,010
Oh, really?

1563
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,390
Yeah, yeah, on the last day.

1564
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:25,090
An AK?

1565
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:25,890
Yeah, yeah.

1566
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:26,530
Do you see the skin?

1567
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:28,810
What the...

1568
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:31,790
You wanna know how to get the skin?

1569
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,270
How do I get the skin, Doki?

1570
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:38,270
Oh, great question, Gumi.

1571
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:42,290
So all you have to do is, like, watch this stream for an hour.

1572
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:47,090
And then you get an exclusive Doki Bird skin right here.

1573
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:52,950
Look at that to represent the Doki Bird and the Dragoons.

1574
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:53,830
Look at that.

1575
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:55,410
You're... Right here, Dragoons.

1576
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:56,930
Right here.

1577
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:04,150
By the way, the reason why it looks like a little... The quality looks a little bit low is because I'm playing on very low quality.

1578
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:10,330
I'm playing on medium quality, guys.

1579
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,610
Anyway, add done.

1580
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,440
Gumi, I went to the loan shark for that scrap.

1581
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,440
I mean, today's... What are they gonna do?

1582
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:26,820
Kill me?

1583
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,420
I've died 20 plus times already.

1584
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,200
I've died 20 plus times already.

1585
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,040
What are they gonna do?

1586
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,480
Kill me again?

1587
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:34,840
I'm here.

1588
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:34,920
I'm here.

1589
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:39,600
I left a part of it in here.

1590
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,300
Wait, you went to the casino?

1591
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,720
I had 2,000!

1592
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:45,740
Wait, no, no, no.

1593
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,800
We gotta go to Okarnian.

1594
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,840
We gotta...

1595
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,560
Wait, you can lock it?

1596
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:53,700
Oh, oh.

1597
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,120
Yeah, I'm part of the casino.

1598
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:57,580
Wait, you're part owner of the casino?

1599
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,840
So you took my money and, like...

1600
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,140
Hi, Gumi.

1601
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,860
Wait, is this a... Is this a sanctuary?

1602
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,680
Yeah, this is a safe haven.

1603
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,720
A safe haven.

1604
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,400
Where you can play DDR.

1605
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:13,820
Wait, there's DDR?

1606
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,760
You wanna see it?

1607
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:19,820
Yeah, I wanna see DDR.

1608
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:25,300
Here, let me get this stuff to fix the car real quick.

1609
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,600
Okay, but we gotta... We gotta make sure to go to the Okarnian before the war is over.

1610
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,760
We gotta make sure.

1611
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:34,940
Yeah.

1612
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,320
Like, that's the goal.

1613
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,300
We gotta be part of the winning side of history.

1614
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:55,250
It's okay, DDR is, like, right around the corner.

1615
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:56,330
Oh, nice.

1616
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:00,090
Where is it?

1617
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,600
Why would we greet our tourists?

1618
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,780
Wait, they destroyed the art gallery?

1619
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,300
What do you mean?

1620
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:20,720
What happened?

1621
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,260
Where... Where was the art gallery?

1622
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,460
Where was it?

1623
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:36,520
Wait.

1624
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:41,820
They came over here just to destroy the art... No wonder Ted went back to war.

1625
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:44,900
No wonder.

1626
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:51,240
What?

1627
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,380
Where?

1628
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,480
This was the art ga...

1629
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,880
Who did that?

1630
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:06,340
Who did that?

1631
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:08,460
What happened?

1632
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,880
Tell me what happened to the art gallery!

1633
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:20,670
Tell me what happened!

1634
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:24,790
Oh my god, no wonder Ted went back.

1635
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:27,230
No wonder Ted went... Oh my god.

1636
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,950
He reversed and then went the right way in history.

1637
01:44:32,590 --> 01:44:37,670
Oh, the DDR is gone.

1638
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:40,270
Wait, what happened to the DDR?

1639
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:42,930
Wait, there's whack-a-mole.

1640
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:46,890
Oh wait, that's so cool though.

1641
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:49,390
Wait, how do you know it's broken?

1642
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,720
I'm doing it!

1643
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,920
Am I doing well?

1644
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,230
I can't tell!

1645
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:19,570
Okay, this is bad DDR because I can just stand there.

1646
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:19,630
I can just stand there.

1647
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:25,350
Wait,

1648
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:30,950
when does it end?

1649
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:32,030
When does it end?

1650
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:33,090
When does this end?

1651
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:36,350
For me who don't know!

1652
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:38,570
Who put you put me in here?!

1653
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:42,030
Oh my god.

1654
01:45:45,490 --> 01:45:48,270
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

1655
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,510
There's a hundred and five...

1656
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:54,390
This person played for five hundred and eighty...

1657
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,310
Oh my god, that guy's crazy.

1658
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:58,910
He played for five hundred and eighty-two.

1659
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:01,790
Yeah, yeah, because I quit.

1660
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:06,290
Alright, time to join the house of Wakhanian.

1661
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:09,430
They're winning right now.

1662
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:11,050
Hello?

1663
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:12,030
Goodbye!

1664
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:18,420
Alright, how do we join?

1665
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,340
We have to request for an invite.

1666
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,080
We can just walk up there and get in?

1667
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,660
That's it?

1668
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,580
It's that easy?

1669
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:37,940
Well...

1670
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:41,000
You have to ask them for the code to their castle.

1671
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,800
Oh, but you can do that, Gumi.

1672
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:43,640
You're...

1673
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,780
You're friends with everybody.

1674
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:48,060
That is true.

1675
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,500
That is Selene's faction from what I know.

1676
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:51,960
But who's in...

1677
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,720
They're all busy at war.

1678
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,700
Who's in... Who's in the Wakhanian...

1679
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:57,380
Uh...

1680
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:59,800
Who's in the...

1681
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,910
Who?

1682
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:17,310
Is that their house?

1683
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:26,350
Wait, guys, who's the leader of the Wakhanian faction?

1684
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,720
Yeah?

1685
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:39,980
Then we won't be able to get out.

1686
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:41,080
Oh.

1687
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,000
Okay, so we gotta...

1688
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,980
Okay, give me a sec.

1689
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:47,280
Who's...

1690
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,040
Who's winning the war...

1691
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:53,880
Winning on the leaderboards right now?

1692
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,140
Alright, yeah, let's go in.

1693
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:02,680
Let's go in.

1694
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,520
Yeah, no, no, I'm...

1695
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,040
Wakhanian is the way to go.

1696
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:06,380
No, we're... Let's go.

1697
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:12,610
But...

1698
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:19,350
They're entirely full, Doki.

1699
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:20,850
They don't have room for us.

1700
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,700
Leave it.

1701
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,280
Oh my god, we should have joined them on...

1702
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,960
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

1703
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:39,590
We can't even...

1704
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,980
We couldn't... I can't even join their kingdom.

1705
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:47,620
I'm gonna be... We're not gonna be on the right side of history, Gumi.

1706
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:48,940
They're gonna eliminate us.

1707
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,260
They're gonna...

1708
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:50,860
They're gonna...

1709
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:52,960
Maybe they'll kick one of them out.

1710
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,480
Do you think they'll kick one of them out for us?

1711
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:02,850
Maybe.

1712
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:07,770
Do you think... Do you think... I've been through so much, Gumi.

1713
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:09,330
Like...

1714
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:10,690
I feel like...

1715
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:12,630
We just need one person to be kicked out.

1716
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:14,550
Woah, woah, woah.

1717
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,650
What?

1718
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:19,330
Alright, we just need two people to be kicked out.

1719
01:49:19,450 --> 01:49:20,050
Just one?

1720
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:21,410
We just need two people.

1721
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:23,550
We just need two people to be kicked out.

1722
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:29,880
Can we ask them to kick them out?

1723
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,540
Kick the AFKers.

1724
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:34,440
Kick the...

1725
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,760
Say, be like...

1726
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,120
Can... Can... Can somebody... Can you kick one of the person...

1727
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:40,220
Anybody that's AFK?

1728
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:40,920
Cause we're here.

1729
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:48,080
Anybody that's not at the war right now should be kicked out.

1730
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,820
That's what I'm saying.

1731
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:53,520
If you're not at the war, you shouldn't be part of the kingdom anymore.

1732
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,180
Those are the F food, aren't you?

1733
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,320
Okay, I don't either.

1734
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:02,180
I'm starving.

1735
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,240
Don't run me over.

1736
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,540
Guys, I was part of the...

1737
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:18,700
I can't get in the car.

1738
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:26,100
Alright.

1739
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,100
Guys, I was part of the war.

1740
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,180
I was there since the beginning.

1741
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:32,380
Guys.

1742
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:36,320
Guys, I'm part of no...

1743
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:38,200
I'm not part of any kingdom.

1744
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,740
They can't kick me out of anywhere.

1745
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:43,380
I'm just a lone wolf.

1746
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,120
That was beautiful.

1747
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,720
How did you only lose like 30 HP?

1748
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,980
Lurklings can use flamethrowers and...

1749
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,760
You know what I found out?

1750
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:08,000
The only reason is because I didn't get blessed by the gods.

1751
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:13,020
Apparently lurklings are supposed to have magical powers where they get extra HP.

1752
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:17,880
But because I wasn't there when the gods blessed them, I wasn't even technically a lurkling.

1753
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:21,120
So I could've held guns this entire time.

1754
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,940
I could've held a gun this entire time.

1755
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,520
That's how fucked up it was.

1756
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,580
I was just roleplaying.

1757
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:34,460
I was just their local roleplayer that wanted to know what it was like to live in lurkling.

1758
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:39,700
I was like the guy that went to visit the Amish to live like an Amish for a day.

1759
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,340
Wasn't even a real lurkling.

1760
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:45,620
And I found out about this today.

1761
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:48,100
I literally found out about this today.

1762
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:51,660
When they were like, do you have extra HP?

1763
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,200
And I was like, no.

1764
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:54,620
And they were like, take this gun.

1765
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,140
You can take this gun now.

1766
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,360
I was just a LARPer.

1767
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,320
It only...

1768
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,640
I can't believe we couldn't join the Wakanians.

1769
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:11,230
Oh wait, we need those.

1770
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:23,950
I can't believe it.

1771
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:24,830
We should have...

1772
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:26,910
We should have joined them when we had the chance.

1773
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:31,630
Who knew?

1774
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,420
Wow, that must be what it's like to not be lagging.

1775
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,000
Oh my god.

1776
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:43,900
Oh wait, wait, there's a group photo.

1777
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:44,760
There's a group photo.

1778
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:45,780
We should go back there.

1779
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:46,860
We're part of the war.

1780
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,640
Keep passcode.

1781
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:56,110
We should go back.

1782
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:57,670
They're gonna have a group photo.

1783
01:52:57,850 --> 01:53:00,210
So we should go back as if we were part of the war.

1784
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:06,800
In five minutes.

1785
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:07,800
In five minutes.

1786
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,740
We have to be there.

1787
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:13,900
Where even are we?

1788
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,320
Oh my god.

1789
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,140
We can get there.

1790
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:18,580
We can get there in time.

1791
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:26,500
We'll get there in time.

1792
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:26,760
Oh my god.

1793
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:27,740
We were there.

1794
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,140
We were there.

1795
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:29,880
Oh my god.

1796
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,440
I'm teleporting.

1797
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,640
Okay, but we gotta park like...

1798
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,920
We gotta park like a little away from the war because it's still happening.

1799
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:46,560
Goomy.

1800
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:48,300
Goomy.

1801
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,980
Goomy, maybe I should drive.

1802
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:53,920
Goomy.

1803
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:57,460
Goomy.

1804
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,440
It's not my fault.

1805
01:53:58,840 --> 01:53:59,240
Goomy.

1806
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,460
Maybe I should drive.

1807
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:02,380
It's not my fault.

1808
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:04,380
Goomy, what do you mean it's not your fault?

1809
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,000
Goomy.

1810
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,180
It's not my fault.

1811
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:12,420
Goomy.

1812
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,320
We gotta...

1813
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,280
We gotta get there before it's too late.

1814
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:18,840
Goomy, we're gonna miss on...

1815
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:19,740
We're gonna miss...

1816
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,600
We're all gonna raid Degen Club.

1817
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,180
I have to drive slowly over this bridge.

1818
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:49,740
Yeah, I think that's like the public's number one enemy.

1819
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:53,060
How the fuck are Wakandan winning?

1820
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,960
Maybe they just outsmarted everyone?

1821
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,380
I guess because like everybody is like using all the resources...

1822
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:08,640
Goomy is teleporting!

1823
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:09,220
What happened?

1824
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,340
No, I didn't teleport.

1825
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:14,240
Are you sure?

1826
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1827
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:18,140
I didn't teleport.

1828
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:20,560
Next to that DDR area...

1829
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:21,280
Oh!

1830
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,340
We gotta make it back!

1831
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,380
We gotta be at the photo!

1832
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:35,840
Yeah, I'm not lagging.

1833
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,600
I'm okay.

1834
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,660
Okay, I hope we don't...

1835
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:41,200
Wanna try driving?

1836
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me drive.

1837
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:50,760
I can't get in.

1838
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,900
Look, it's 8888.

1839
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,100
There you go.

1840
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:58,100
See, I'm not lagging.

1841
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,000
I'm not lagging at all.

1842
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,440
Well, drive...

1843
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:03,500
Drive faster.

1844
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:09,990
I'm actually a better driver than you.

1845
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:11,110
I can't believe it.

1846
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,410
I'm actually a better driver than you.

1847
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:13,510
Okay, so like...

1848
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:14,310
Okay, speed it all the way up, bitch!

1849
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:15,030
No, no, no, no, no.

1850
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:16,730
This is where the war is!

1851
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:17,590
Nah.

1852
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:19,910
Okay, no, we're not.

1853
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:22,030
I'm trying to figure out where the war is!

1854
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:24,650
The moment we hit war territory, we're so fucked.

1855
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:25,870
I need you to know that.

1856
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:28,870
The moment we hit war territory...

1857
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:29,370
It's like...

1858
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:31,690
We're gonna get shot at in this car.

1859
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:33,110
We're literally gonna get shot at.

1860
01:56:34,210 --> 01:56:34,610
Ah!

1861
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:39,660
Woah, woah, woah.

1862
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,720
You don't like that, do you?

1863
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,120
Huh?

1864
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:42,200
I wasn't lagging, by the way.

1865
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,260
I just was supposed to fuck with you.

1866
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,200
I was just supposed to fuck with you.

1867
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:46,720
Oh, it's over!

1868
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:47,180
It's over!

1869
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:47,860
This is my baby.

1870
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,120
I raised this car.

1871
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,960
I can't believe we couldn't join the war.

1872
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:51,580
War is over!

1873
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:52,840
War is over!

1874
01:56:58,410 --> 01:56:59,290
Where am I?

1875
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:00,370
Where am I?

1876
01:57:01,030 --> 01:57:01,550
Where am I?

1877
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:02,870
Where did I go?

1878
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:05,910
Where did I go?

1879
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,070
Where did I...

1880
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:08,850
Where did I...

1881
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:09,210
Where did I...

1882
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:10,050
Where did I...

1883
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:12,850
Hey, guys!

1884
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:13,530
Do you guys hear?

1885
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:14,210
War is over!

1886
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:15,110
Can you hear me?

1887
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:15,930
Yeah!

1888
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:18,150
War is over!

1889
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:19,670
Hey, good job!

1890
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:20,170
We won!

1891
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:21,650
Yeah, we did it!

1892
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:22,550
Hey, we won!

1893
01:57:23,270 --> 01:57:23,830
We won!

1894
01:57:24,350 --> 01:57:25,250
We did it!

1895
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:25,690
We won!

1896
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:27,370
I'm excited we won.

1897
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:29,570
We're the Church of the Blood God.

1898
01:57:30,430 --> 01:57:31,470
We did it!

1899
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:32,850
Oh, we got...

1900
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:33,250
We won.

1901
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:34,210
They ran away?

1902
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:35,990
We did it, guys!

1903
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:38,410
We got this.

1904
01:57:38,490 --> 01:57:39,450
We won, everybody!

1905
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:39,870
We got it!

1906
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:41,450
Are you guys...

1907
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:44,450
I had a feeling we had them on their heels.

1908
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:47,910
Oh, sorry.

1909
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:48,530
Sorry.

1910
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:48,850
Sorry.

1911
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:50,830
You were walking while we were driving.

1912
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:51,230
It's okay.

1913
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:51,410
It's okay.

1914
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:51,930
It's so late.

1915
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:52,830
Whoa!

1916
01:57:53,810 --> 01:57:54,290
Whoa!

1917
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:57,570
Alright.

1918
01:58:00,110 --> 01:58:00,190
Alright.

1919
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:04,110
Alright.

1920
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:06,330
We won, base!

1921
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:07,810
We won the war!

1922
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:10,150
We won the war!

1923
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:11,270
We won the war!

1924
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:14,510
It's over!

1925
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:16,950
We can go...

1926
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:18,270
Come on, let's go to the boat!

1927
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,370
We did it!

1928
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:24,910
We did it!

1929
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:27,810
Yeah!

1930
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:34,570
Wait, do you mean I'm driving?

1931
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:36,410
Oh, there's a lot of lag.

1932
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:40,790
We're Ubering over!

1933
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:47,490
We're gonna head over for photos!

1934
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:51,250
Guys, I don't think...

1935
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,370
Is war over yet?

1936
01:58:53,010 --> 01:58:56,230
It said war is over, everybody!

1937
01:58:58,550 --> 01:59:00,210
The war is over!

1938
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:05,750
I'm like on top of 200 loot that...

1939
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:06,890
Oh, my God.

1940
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,870
There's so much loot over there.

1941
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:13,010
We're almost there.

1942
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:15,990
I'm heading...

1943
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:18,250
Guys, I don't know if the war is over.

1944
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:19,890
Why are they shooting, guys?

1945
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:24,190
The war is over!

1946
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:24,970
Let's go!

1947
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:33,310
Oh, my God.

1948
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:37,650
It's over!

1949
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:49,130
Oh, my God.

1950
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:50,390
Look at this.

1951
01:59:50,450 --> 01:59:51,710
Oh, my God, it's fire!

1952
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:01,360
Yeah.

1953
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,020
I'm scared.

1954
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,500
I'm scared.

1955
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:07,640
I'm very scared.

1956
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:14,220
We accept your surrender.

1957
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,700
It's the right move.

1958
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:18,960
You made the right move.

1959
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,920
We accept...

1960
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:25,060
We accept your surrender.

1961
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,440
Sir, I said we accept your surrender.

1962
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:32,160
My goodness, this is a negotiation.

1963
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,460
This is a negotiation, sir.

1964
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,000
This is highly unprofessional.

1965
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,140
Highly unprofessional.

1966
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,880
I'm too scared to go up there.

1967
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,620
There's a lot of stuff up there.

1968
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:55,460
There's a lot of scary things going on right now.

1969
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:05,310
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1970
02:01:06,450 --> 02:01:07,450
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1971
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:09,970
I'm gonna be sick.

1972
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:13,210
There's so many bodies.

1973
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:16,170
JJ!

1974
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:19,430
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1975
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:20,950
I'm not gonna stand there.

1976
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:22,450
I'm gonna be sick.

1977
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,270
Oh, don't stand on the fire.

1978
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:25,270
Don't stand...

1979
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:25,570
No!

1980
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:27,630
No!

1981
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:31,290
Go me!

1982
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:35,250
Go me through a nade.

1983
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:37,730
Go me through a nade.

1984
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:38,910
She...

1985
02:01:38,910 --> 02:01:40,010
She threw a...

1986
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:44,270
She threw a nade.

1987
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:50,050
She threw a nade.

1988
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:53,450
She threw a nade.

1989
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:56,750
She threw a fucking nade.

1990
02:02:02,110 --> 02:02:03,690
I had everything.

1991
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:06,030
I had my gun.

1992
02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:09,270
I had everything I've ever wanted in life.

1993
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:13,090
Where is me?

1994
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:14,910
I heard...

1995
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:16,130
I heard your name.

1996
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:17,810
Oh, there it is.

1997
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:21,310
Wait, my gun.

1998
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:22,770
It's gone.

1999
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,850
My gun is gone.

2000
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:28,050
Wait.

2001
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:31,790
What the hell is happening?

2002
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:33,190
Where's my gun?

2003
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:37,730
Where's my gun?

2004
02:02:43,090 --> 02:02:44,150
Where is it?

2005
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:44,710
Oh, my God.

2006
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:45,390
Oh, sorry.

2007
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:53,730
It's not there!

2008
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:57,930
There's too many voices.

2009
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:00,850
She took it away!

2010
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:02,690
It's mine.

2011
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:04,830
It's mine?

2012
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:05,870
No!

2013
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:06,610
The gun!

2014
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:09,550
I was like, why did Choco kill me?

2015
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:10,910
Who was it?

2016
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:14,110
It's okay.

2017
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:15,750
Hey, brother.

2018
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:17,130
Can you get out of my copter?

2019
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:18,450
Where's my gun?

2020
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:20,850
I wasn't talking to you.

2021
02:03:20,910 --> 02:03:21,690
I wasn't talking to you.

2022
02:03:21,790 --> 02:03:22,830
Somebody said the other thing.

2023
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:23,190
Goodbye.

2024
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:29,570
Oh, my God!

2025
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:33,730
Maybe I'll find my gun in this pile!

2026
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:37,810
It's gone.

2027
02:03:37,990 --> 02:03:39,270
There's so many!

2028
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:42,050
One of them has to be my gun!

2029
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:44,650
GG, guys.

2030
02:03:44,650 --> 02:03:46,710
We won!

2031
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:50,390
Alright.

2032
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:02,160
I just want to be part of the photo.

2033
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:03,400
I...

2034
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:05,720
I just...

2035
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,380
I...

2036
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:11,260
I just...

2037
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:17,780
I...

2038
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,500
I just...

2039
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:25,740
I just...

2040
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,440
I just want...

2041
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:32,080
I just wanted to be part of the photo.

2042
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:32,860
That's...

2043
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,940
I don't ask for much.

2044
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:36,200
I...

2045
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,000
I don't ask for much.

2046
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:40,260
I...

2047
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:46,180
I...

2048
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:47,940
I don't ask for much in this world.

2049
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,740
I don't...

2050
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:51,480
I just ask for one thing.

2051
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:54,060
Just one thing.

2052
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:56,440
But don't...

2053
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:57,400
Don't fuck me!

2054
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:58,500
Fuck me!

2055
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,000
Wait, do we have the...

2056
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,680
Did we...

2057
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:08,080
Did we take the photo yet?

2058
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:11,260
There you go.

2059
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:15,600
You killed me, so I had to kill you back.

2060
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:17,140
Did we take the photo yet?

2061
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:18,880
Alright, brothers!

2062
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,220
Oh, that's some good politics.

2063
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:25,720
Somebody must have my gun.

2064
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:28,160
Somebody out there!

2065
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:33,280
There was one point where Jackie and I were duo, and I was naked with an M2, and I killed like 5 or 6 people that day.

2066
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:33,720
It was so fun.

2067
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:37,060
I was just mowing people down with the M2.

2068
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:39,340
Somebody must have it!

2069
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:40,640
It was so fun.

2070
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:43,820
Yeah, for real though, it was so fucking fun.

2071
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:45,780
There has to be like one guy.

2072
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:49,520
There has to be one guy with my gun.

2073
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:52,980
I can't even count how many people I killed that night.

2074
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,280
I saw someone parachuting in the night.

2075
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:59,100
Yeah, that was us.

2076
02:05:59,200 --> 02:05:59,940
Oh my god.

2077
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,460
Yeah, that was us parachuting.

2078
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:02,600
It was so fun.

2079
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,920
It was so fucking fun.

2080
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:06,720
No, we're the worklings.

2081
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,520
It was epic.

2082
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,740
Vote for the Blood God.

2083
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:14,660
Vote for the Blood God, yes.

2084
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,580
Yes, yes.

2085
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,020
We've made it to the Blood God.

2086
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:19,480
It was a resounding victory.

2087
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,380
Oh my god.

2088
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,000
It was so fun.

2089
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:23,980
I'm glad you're here, dude.

2090
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:24,820
Blood God!

2091
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:28,700
I'm wearing... I wear anything.

2092
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:32,180
I just... I don't want to be naked no more, please.

2093
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,280
Blood God!

2094
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:36,000
I think we're all probably just going to kill each other is more likely.

2095
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:36,960
Blood God!

2096
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,580
God damn it, the sexiest gun!

2097
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:41,400
Blood God!

2098
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:44,760
Rage is to the Blood God.

2099
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:45,700
Hey!

2100
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,600
You don't happen to have any low grade, do you, Dee?

2101
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:49,240
Yeah.

2102
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:50,780
No, not me!

2103
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,440
Oh, instigating.

2104
02:06:53,620 --> 02:06:54,460
Oh my god.

2105
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:57,680
No, I didn't mean to get mad at you!

2106
02:06:58,100 --> 02:06:59,180
Dee, I'm sorry!

2107
02:06:59,360 --> 02:06:59,700
Dee, I'm sorry!

2108
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:02,460
Please, I just... Oh my god!

2109
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:03,620
Don't shoot me!

2110
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,660
Don't shoot me!

2111
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:04,740
Don't shoot me!

2112
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,580
I remember you.

2113
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,360
Oh, they don't have a link!

2114
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:10,360
Oh, I'm dead!

2115
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:12,700
I'm dead!

2116
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:14,640
Okay, I'm ready for a photo.

2117
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:16,380
I remember you.

2118
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:19,140
I'm ready for my photo now.

2119
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,600
Get this guy out!

2120
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,560
I'm ready for a photo now.

2121
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,740
I remember you.

2122
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:27,840
I want a Lurkling outfit.

2123
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:29,480
After everything I've been through.

2124
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,820
After being in the Amish for so long.

2125
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,960
I might as well commit to it.

2126
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:35,980
You're looking pretty good.

2127
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:39,240
I've been Amish for so long.

2128
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:41,880
I want to at least have the outfit.

2129
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:43,800
I'm very proud of you, Eli.

2130
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:46,280
Do you know by now how powerful I am?

2131
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,180
I think you're amazing.

2132
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,100
I died!

2133
02:07:58,570 --> 02:08:00,750
I just killed a guy.

2134
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:01,970
I killed a guy.

2135
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:07,790
Are we still doing a photo?

2136
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:15,650
I can't.

2137
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:17,610
I can't.

2138
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:20,670
I can't.

2139
02:08:21,630 --> 02:08:22,390
I can't.

2140
02:08:26,730 --> 02:08:28,770
I'm not going back.

2141
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:31,230
I'm not going back.

2142
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:34,090
I can't anymore.

2143
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:37,550
I'm a broken man right now.

2144
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:40,030
I'm so broken.

2145
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:41,890
I'm not going back in that hell.

2146
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:48,410
I can't.

2147
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:56,550
Does anyone have an AK?

2148
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:03,150
Oh my god, thank you.

2149
02:09:04,230 --> 02:09:06,050
Oh my god, thank you.

2150
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:11,610
Every time I try to get my gun in the pile, I die.

2151
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:17,110
Oh, thank you.

2152
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:23,550
Oh my god, thank you.

2153
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:26,650
I don't have to go through hell again.

2154
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:28,930
Oh, nice.

2155
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:29,370
What's this?

2156
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:32,950
Battle.

2157
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:38,230
Ow, what the fuck?

2158
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:40,210
That was the god.

2159
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:46,410
Oh my god, I'm never coming back there.

2160
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:50,670
Every time I get the stuff I want, I die.

2161
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:57,650
Oh my god, is that the blood god?

2162
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:00,430
Wait, did he just die?

2163
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:06,090
Wait, Doublekey, that is such a cool AK you have.

2164
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:07,190
Oh, thank you.

2165
02:10:07,330 --> 02:10:08,230
Did you get it?

2166
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,290
Did you watch an hour?

2167
02:10:10,690 --> 02:10:12,330
Oh my god, I did.

2168
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:17,510
I went to twitch.tv and I got a really cool AK skin for it.

2169
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:18,570
Oh my god.

2170
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:21,430
Yeah, yeah, put it on.

2171
02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:23,470
Put that gun skin on.

2172
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:33,640
Yeah, fuck those guys.

2173
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:37,300
He had it coming.

2174
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:39,900
Dude, he owned me so many times.

2175
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:41,640
My own ally during that fight.

2176
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:51,120
I mean, I died many times.

2177
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:52,840
Only at the very end.

2178
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,370
Oh my god, he appeared.

2179
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:00,960
You're wonderful.

2180
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:03,380
Oh my god.

2181
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:06,660
We're sued for days.

2182
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:12,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my gun skin.

2183
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:13,980
Where are we going?

2184
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:18,760
Oh my god, yes.

2185
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:23,240
Yeah, and everybody that watched an hour of my stream, put it on.

2186
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:30,680
Wow, nice self promo, Doublekey.

2187
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,240
God, thank you.

2188
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:32,800
Thank you.

2189
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,120
Did you see the skin?

2190
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:40,480
Jackie, did you watch an hour of my stream to get this exclusive Ruskin right here?

2191
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,640
It was hell.

2192
02:11:57,100 --> 02:11:58,240
It was hell.

2193
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:03,360
I thought I kind of popped off prepping us for war.

2194
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,400
I thought I was kind of sick.

2195
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:10,900
Wait, how did Dragon die?

2196
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:12,940
How did he die?

2197
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:23,020
Wait, wait, wait, can I get handcuffs?

2198
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:25,140
We gotta wait for Dragon.

2199
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:25,640
No.

2200
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:29,080
No, put a picture.

2201
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:29,620
Put a picture.

2202
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,160
I'm ready for the picture.

2203
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,200
Why the fuck me, dude?

2204
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:39,560
Who do we look at?

2205
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:44,160
Guys, what are you doing?

2206
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:57,520
Oh my god, the skin is so cool, look at that.

2207
02:12:57,600 --> 02:12:58,360
We're good, let's go.

2208
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:59,680
We all watched an hour.

2209
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:05,340
Shoot him.

2210
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:14,720
Who shot him?

2211
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,680
Oh, he's dead.

2212
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:27,420
Photo, guys, photo, photo, guys.

2213
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:28,920
Photo.

2214
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:43,460
Wait, Gumi isn't part of this.

2215
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,360
Gumi left, Gumi, you left the trot.

2216
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,720
You left the Gamish.

2217
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,180
I didn't even kill her.

2218
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,640
I wasn't here.

2219
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:10,860
Okay, I ratted her out.

2220
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:11,900
But, like, I didn't.

2221
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:18,600
It's not my fault.

2222
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,960
I just ratted her out.

2223
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,920
You're not even part of it.

2224
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,480
You left Gumi.

2225
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,000
Kill her.

2226
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:28,100
Lose.

2227
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,600
You blew me up.

2228
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:36,200
You threw a grenade and killed me.

2229
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:43,620
No, I'm still in the tribe.

2230
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:47,600
No, I didn't.

2231
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:49,380
I'm literally in the tribe.

2232
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:50,380
No, I did not.

2233
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,260
I did not say that.

2234
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,440
Gumi, do you really believe in Gumi who ditched the Lurklings on day one?

2235
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:03,600
I was here.

2236
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:12,540
Lurklings!

2237
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:15,680
I love Lurklings!

2238
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:31,020
Oh, yeah!

2239
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:31,840
Another photo!

2240
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:33,580
Let's go!

2241
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:38,580
Okay, here you guys go.

2242
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:39,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

2243
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,200
Thank you!

2244
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,140
Sick!

2245
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:44,500
Wait, where's the photo?

2246
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,360
Now look at you.

2247
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:52,700
Wait, I want to see the photo.

2248
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:55,360
My car is all gone.

2249
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:09,940
Kill her!

2250
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:10,120
That's so sad.

2251
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,280
That's literally so sad.

2252
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:14,760
That was really fun.

2253
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:15,320
That's over.

2254
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:17,580
The last 10 days were awesome.

2255
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:19,580
I feel like we did something really different.

2256
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:21,720
I love you all.

2257
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,360
Thank you so much.

2258
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,660
This was a concept that I was thinking about.

2259
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:39,340
That we might improve upon for the future.

2260
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:40,860
For like a class system kind of thing.

2261
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:42,360
I thought the Lurklings were so cool.

2262
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:42,440
Oh, yeah.

2263
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,560
It was fun.

2264
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,840
Yeah, it was fun.

2265
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:57,860
Thank you for hosting!

2266
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,100
Oh, there's the photo!

2267
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:01,560
That's us!

2268
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:03,920
Thank you!

2269
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:05,320
Thank you, Abe!

2270
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:07,740
Thank you, goodbye!

2271
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,020
Thank you, Abe!

2272
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:09,980
Now what?

2273
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:15,160
Now we say goodbye and never see each other again.

2274
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:16,320
Who won the throne?

2275
02:17:16,980 --> 02:17:20,440
Regardless of who won the throne, we looked the coolest entering that battle.

2276
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,360
We definitely looked the coolest.

2277
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:23,940
It was so fucking cool.

2278
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:32,640
I'm gonna watch so many clips of this, but like, I wanna see all of you guys parachuting in.

2279
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:33,820
I mean, it was fucking sick.

2280
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:37,200
I'm gonna miss you guys.

2281
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:38,740
Bye!

2282
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:39,880
Yeah, it was fun.

2283
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,560
I'll see you guys next time.

2284
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:43,880
Theo!

2285
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:47,220
Theo!

2286
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:50,820
I'll never forget you, Theo!

2287
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,440
No, I actually can't hear you!

2288
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:57,840
I added you on Discord, Theo!

2289
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,240
I added you on Discord!

2290
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:03,640
What did he say?

2291
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:09,460
I realized I lagged so hard because my settings were on medium.

2292
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:15,920
So like, when I threw that grenade, it killed everyone like a full minute later and I was stuck in time.

2293
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:20,040
I could only hear people like a minute behind.

2294
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:22,600
Oh yeah, no, you killed me.

2295
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:32,760
That's for killing me and losing my gun.

2296
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:36,920
Fuck you.

2297
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:38,200
Fuck you, buddy.

2298
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:41,600
Alright, I'm gonna call it.

2299
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:44,440
Alright, I'm gonna leave here guys.

2300
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:47,020
GG's everybody.

2301
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,280
GG's everyone.

2302
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:53,320
This is how I die.

2303
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:54,340
That's fine.

2304
02:18:59,220 --> 02:19:00,660
Alright, GG's.

2305
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:06,200
What a way to end Rust with my last death.

2306
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:06,940
That's fine.

2307
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:13,140
I hope you guys got the gun drop, the AK gun drop.

2308
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:23,860
It was a fun event to be invited to so a huge shout out to Abe for inviting me and for Sykuno for inviting me to be part of the AK drop.

2309
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:43,300
It really was a great experience and I really appreciate everybody for coming and for watching and if you guys still need a little bit of the drop I don't know if it continues.

2310
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:44,020
Does it continue?

2311
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:47,320
I'll stay here for like 10 more minutes guys.

2312
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,980
I'll stay here for 10 more minutes guys.

2313
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:52,220
You can still watch me for the rust drop when I'm chatting.

2314
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,720
Because I'm still in the category.

2315
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:58,160
I'm still in the category.

2316
02:19:58,620 --> 02:19:58,940
I'm still in the category.

2317
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:04,580
So if anybody is still trying to farm the drop I'll be here for 10 more minutes.

2318
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:16,940
I'll be here for 10 more minutes and then I hope that some of you guys managed to get the drop.

2319
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,180
Anyway, it ends in 35 minutes.

2320
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:21,700
Well, I'll be here for 10 more minutes.

2321
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:26,140
I'll be here for 10 more minutes.

2322
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:28,360
I'll be here for 10 more minutes.

2323
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:35,500
But yes, thank you everybody.

2324
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:44,700
It was a great time experiencing this event for more than just one day.

2325
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:53,760
The reason why I'm leaving in 10 minutes is because my throat is dying now and I need to rest my throat.

2326
02:20:54,100 --> 02:21:01,500
I've been eating cough drops non-stop the last 2 hours because I've been coughing a lot.

2327
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:06,320
I've been eating cough drops back to back to back.

2328
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:11,520
That's why I'm like I'll do it for 10 more minutes for everybody who has yet to do the drop yet.

2329
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:17,460
That's why I'll stay for 10 more.

2330
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:19,460
But yes, it was a great experience.

2331
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:24,040
I got to meet a lot of cool people in the server.

2332
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,560
I was part of 3 different wars.

2333
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:27,940
One I might have started.

2334
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:36,040
One I might have started.

2335
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:42,500
Yeah, I'm planning on going to the doctor this week.

2336
02:21:42,560 --> 02:22:00,520
The reason why I got sick again was because it was because of the fact that I got sick again during my trip.

2337
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:03,680
I got sick again.

2338
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:10,060
So my cough is back.

2339
02:22:10,660 --> 02:22:14,900
It was getting better and then it got worse because I got sick again this week.

2340
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:17,380
That's why I'm still coughing.

2341
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:26,540
So this week I'll try and go to the doctor and get something.

2342
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:29,160
I'm Canadian.

2343
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,780
I'm Canadian.

2344
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:38,520
But I did go to America and got sick.

2345
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:41,980
I went to America and got sick.

2346
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:44,940
I got sick in Canada and I got sick in America.

2347
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:47,640
So like it works.

2348
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:49,600
It doesn't matter.

2349
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:52,120
It's just an AD buff at that point.

2350
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:57,320
But yeah, let me know when that 10 minutes is up because I'm not keeping track of it at all.

2351
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:01,440
But yeah, it was a lot of... I explored a lot.

2352
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:07,400
I didn't want to stick too much to Lurklings because I wanted to see what's going on in other places.

2353
02:23:07,780 --> 02:23:10,660
So it was fun to see stuff that was going on.

2354
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:18,200
I did get tilted at the end when people just kept killing because I was like I just wanted to be part of the photo and I was trying to get my gun.

2355
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:21,200
I was like I just want my gun.

2356
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:22,000
Like...

2357
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:31,980
I was like I got a little tilted at that because I was like please I just wanted to take a photo.

2358
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:36,480
I got... yeah, yeah.

2359
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:40,800
I got like a little tilted at that because everybody was like war is over.

2360
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,980
I was like guys, war is over.

2361
02:23:50,410 --> 02:23:52,890
And war was not over.

2362
02:23:59,110 --> 02:24:00,510
That was fun.

2363
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:08,470
And then I left the war for a little bit because I was like I was tired of dying non-stop.

2364
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:10,610
Oh, shit face!

2365
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:13,830
I'm so glad I got my cool AK skin.

2366
02:24:14,110 --> 02:24:15,550
Oh my god, I know, right?

2367
02:24:15,550 --> 02:24:16,990
It was so cool.

2368
02:24:17,150 --> 02:24:19,990
And you can only get it on my channel.

2369
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:21,990
Nobody else's, right?

2370
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:30,190
I love that like Sykudo was there and was like oh wait, can I also get it on Sykudo's channel?

2371
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:32,570
And I was like no, okay.

2372
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:43,690
Yeah, that was great.

2373
02:24:45,550 --> 02:24:47,090
That was great meeting you too, man.

2374
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:51,230
Especially when I literally logged in today, this morning, today.

2375
02:24:51,550 --> 02:25:00,350
Took me to the plane and I just died like in my first five minutes and literally logged in dead.

2376
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:00,990
Okay.

2377
02:25:01,690 --> 02:25:04,270
Wait 200 seconds to spawn back in.

2378
02:25:09,990 --> 02:25:12,210
I understood the mission, yeah.

2379
02:25:12,370 --> 02:25:14,710
I was like for the lurklings.

2380
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:17,070
For the lurklings.

2381
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:23,970
But yeah, it was a great time.

2382
02:25:24,930 --> 02:25:27,950
I don't know if I'll be streaming tomorrow yet.

2383
02:25:28,190 --> 02:25:32,690
The reason why schedule hasn't been posted yet is because I'm doing like a million different fucking things at the moment.

2384
02:25:33,130 --> 02:25:35,890
So, I'm like confirming stuff and everything.

2385
02:25:36,390 --> 02:25:44,290
So, regarding like scheduling wise so, and I really want to rest up a little bit because, you know, my throat is still fucked up.

2386
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:52,230
So, I do want to rest my voice a little bit before before I go back into streaming.

2387
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:53,730
So, yeah.

2388
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:54,210
I'm sorry.

2389
02:25:54,390 --> 02:26:00,130
I'm sorry to I'm sorry that everybody is still waiting for me to come back.

2390
02:26:00,210 --> 02:26:00,970
I'm sorry.

2391
02:26:01,130 --> 02:26:24,070
I had to I wanted to make sure that everybody everybody could get the gun not everybody, obviously, but as many people could get the AK skin as possible because, you know, I wasn't able to stream that much of Rust as much as I liked for someone who has an exclusive skin,

2392
02:26:24,530 --> 02:26:26,130
but at least it's more than Kai.

2393
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:28,390
So, like that's like, that was my goal.

2394
02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:29,290
Um...

2395
02:26:31,170 --> 02:26:36,810
I just didn't want to be like the least streamed person with the drop.

2396
02:26:37,150 --> 02:26:48,730
So, like my goal was to literally be like stream more... stream more enough so that stream enough so that you weren't the person with the least amount of stream hours for your drop.

2397
02:26:48,890 --> 02:26:50,630
And that's all that mattered to me.

2398
02:26:52,450 --> 02:27:02,810
And thankfully Sykkuno was able to stream... yeah, Sykkuno streamed a lot for... he held he held the base down.

2399
02:27:02,810 --> 02:27:03,390
He...

2400
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:05,790
But what an adventure!

2401
02:27:06,310 --> 02:27:09,190
What a fucking adventure for everybody.

2402
02:27:09,570 --> 02:27:13,290
Anyway, how much more do we have of the drops by the way guys?

2403
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:15,770
How much more do we have of the drops?

2404
02:27:16,110 --> 02:27:16,610
Chat?

2405
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:18,970
Um...

2406
02:27:18,970 --> 02:27:22,650
Like, when does... what time does what time... how much...

2407
02:27:22,650 --> 02:27:24,050
what time does it end?

2408
02:27:24,590 --> 02:27:25,470
Just so I know.

2409
02:27:28,470 --> 02:27:29,070
Uh...

2410
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:30,790
It has 20-40 minutes?

2411
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:36,410
Okay, well, the twitch... the drops end in... the drops end in 28 minutes, so...

2412
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:38,150
I'm very sorry, but...

2413
02:27:38,150 --> 02:27:41,330
I don't think you're gonna get it.

2414
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:43,330
I'm so sorry.

2415
02:27:43,830 --> 02:27:44,250
I...

2416
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:46,590
I don't think...

2417
02:27:46,590 --> 02:27:48,350
Alright, I thought about this.

2418
02:27:48,490 --> 02:27:53,610
Okay, I will AFK here so that you guys can farm the drops.

2419
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:56,550
I'm gonna be AFK not doing anything.

2420
02:27:57,250 --> 02:28:02,490
I'll make you guys watch the... I'll make you guys watch the ending screen.

2421
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:06,350
Um... and then AFK until the drops are over.

2422
02:28:06,650 --> 02:28:08,470
Because I... I need a rest.

2423
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:13,590
So, I'll do the maximum amount, so... Anyway, and I'll place ads too.

2424
02:28:13,790 --> 02:28:17,590
Wait, if I place ads, do you guys... I don't even know if it progresses.

2425
02:28:17,870 --> 02:28:19,050
Actually, I shouldn't place ads.

2426
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:22,430
Because I don't even know if it progre... I don't even... I feel like...

2427
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:26,830
I think the ads are gonna play and then, like, people... it stops the progress.

2428
02:28:26,830 --> 02:28:28,470
It stops...

2429
02:28:28,470 --> 02:28:30,610
It stops the progress.

2430
02:28:31,310 --> 02:28:31,870
Like...

2431
02:28:32,790 --> 02:28:33,870
