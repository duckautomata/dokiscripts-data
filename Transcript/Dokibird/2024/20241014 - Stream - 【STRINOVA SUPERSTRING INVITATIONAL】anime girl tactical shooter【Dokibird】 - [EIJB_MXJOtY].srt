1
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,270
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,470
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm so sorry for being late, guys.

4
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,210
I'm really sorry.

5
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,730
We had... I had to walk.

6
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,510
Dad, I was warming up earlier, and the matches went on a little later than I thought it was gonna go on.

7
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,970
Sorry, my voice is slowly dead.

8
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,550
I'm gonna take, like, rest days the next two... I think, like, for the next two days...

9
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,650
Monday and Tuesday, I'm definitely gonna take a rest day.

10
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,270
So, um...

11
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,870
Uh, cause my voice is dying.

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,810
I did too many double streams.

13
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,990
I'm gonna get... Let me grab a cough drop real quick.

14
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,190
Anyway, um, so the trend... We don't have matches until 6 p.m.

15
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,710
because, uh, um, um, we're not playing first.

16
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,050
So, uh, we're gonna be... We're gonna warm up a little bit with Mac or Slash Alberlele.

17
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,790
So, um, the rest of the team isn't here yet.

18
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,270
Uh, so I think Surefour is playing Deadlock, and, like, our other teammates are asleep, and I don't know where Aztec is, so, like...

19
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,250
So, like, I don't know.

20
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,310
I don't know.

21
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:58,890
Um, anyway, um, uh, uh, so, like, uh, you know, he's literally streaming Deadlock right now.

22
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,590
Uh, so, yeah, I just got back from Walking Dead.

23
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,150
I had to pick some maps as well.

24
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,090
We're doing map picks and stuff.

25
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,730
I don't know.

26
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,930
I don't really know what maps to do or, like, if we do attack or defense.

27
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,770
So, I was literally just, I was just, like, asking Mac, and he was like, I don't fucking know.

28
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,970
I literally just played the game today, and I was like, I don't know.

29
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,950
I don't fucking know which is attack or which is T-sided or not.

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,890
So, we were, uh, we were picking maps and everything, so that's why it took me a bit, uh, to get here.

31
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,830
I'm really sorry for being late, but, like, games don't really start anyway.

32
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,930
We're just warming... Most... The most we're gonna do is just warm up.

33
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:54,110
Um, he was telling me, apparently, some teams were forfeiting, um, because they were fighting against teams that were, um, that were, that have been playing Stranova for, like, months now that have been, like, you know, because Stranova is out in other countries and,

34
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,290
uh, but not in NA.

35
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:06,770
So, like, there were teams that have been playing Stranova for months and then, um, apparently, Mac told me there were teams that forfeited because they were like, this is bullshit, so we're just gonna... We're not even gonna play anymore.

36
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,230
And I was like, holy shit, that's fucking crazy.

37
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,410
I was like, oh my god, what?

38
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,750
So, um, so I guess, like, matches, um, are gonna be fast.

39
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:36,970
I don't know how my team's gonna go because, like I said, we have every type of FPS player, not just FPS, but we have every type of, like, um, um, shooter player except for Valorant.

40
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:52,970
So, like, because, like, so, like, this game is all, it's a tactical shooter and it's all about util, utility, um, and, like, uh, I'm scared because, um, the second team we're fighting against are, like, Valorant players.

41
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,110
So, uh, so, and I don't know.

42
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,250
I think some, they might have, you know, they might have Shinova experience as well.

43
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,670
So, we're freaking, we'll see.

44
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,890
We'll see.

45
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,650
We'll see how it goes.

46
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,150
I'm pretty sure the second team, yeah, the second team we're playing are Valorant players.

47
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,090
So, um, we'll see how it goes.

48
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,430
Um, anyway, um, anyway, huge shout out to Shinova for sponsoring me.

49
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,830
Uh, they reached out and wanted me to join this tournament and decided to sponsor me.

50
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:35,250
So, please, um, if you want to support, oh, yeah, I just realized, like, I pinned the message that, guys, mod, do you have my message that I'm, oh, there you go.

51
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:45,030
I accidentally, I accidentally, like, unpinned my sponsor thing.

52
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,690
Anyway, um, so, if you guys want to help out the stream, you can download the game for some free rewards, by the way.

53
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,170
You pre-register or sign up now.

54
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,830
You can get some free rewards where you can unlock things.

55
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,330
There's gacha in this game as well.

56
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,610
So, I'll show you guys real quick.

57
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,910
Um, but yes, it helps out, it helps the stream out a lot, um, if you click on the link.

58
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,010
So, please check it out.

59
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,670
Anyway, I'll show you guys Shinova.

60
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:18,830
So, um, anyway, so, um, there's some, I'll be playing Catgirl, uh, Michelle, uh, I'll be playing Michelle, which is me.

61
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,730
I'm playing her, and then I'll also be playing, um, I'll be playing Celestia.

62
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,870
I see, I don't know, we haven't really talked about who's playing what, but I assume nobody in my team wants to heal.

63
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:38,090
So, like, I will be, I'll, I'll be the grown adult here, because I know Surefour, Surefour wants to be Sniper.

64
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:47,530
And so, um, so, I'll play the I'll play the healer on attack, and then I'll play, uh, Michelle on defense, so Retro Doki on defense.

65
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:57,210
And then, um, I think Albert Lele is playing Audrey, and then I don't know anybody else, like, I, I don't know what everybody else is gonna play.

66
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,390
Also, there's Gacha.

67
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,590
Yes.

68
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,130
Also, I have a lot of money, because I got sponsored.

69
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,050
So, um, so, we have a lot, so there's Gacha, so I could literally, like, Gacha, right?

70
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,230
I don't know how to do this Gacha.

71
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,930
Is it this?

72
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,310
Oh, okay, and then we draw.

73
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,590
So, let's, might as well, might as well roll, like, I got free Gacha tickets anyway.

74
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,670
Like, we might as well, it's free.

75
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,230
What does the orc draw?

76
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,110
Do you think I know?

77
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,270
Like, I think red is the rare, right?

78
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,530
Oh, that's a nice...

79
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,850
Oh, you're not... Bro, they're all of them are, like, they're all, like, guns.

80
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,970
I... Oh, nice.

81
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,850
Oh, hey!

82
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,570
That's me!

83
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,470
That's me!

84
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,510
That's my gun!

85
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,330
I'll play.

86
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,730
I'll put it on, and then the rest don't matter.

87
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,030
Oh, hey!

88
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,230
Oh, she's cute.

89
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,630
Lime is... Lime color is cute.

90
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,230
All right, here we go.

91
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,830
Time to main Audrey.

92
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,730
All right, purple.

93
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:03,890
Purple.

94
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,630
I'm skipping.

95
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,770
Oh!

96
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,190
Why did I skip?

97
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,870
Nice.

98
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,450
All right.

99
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,950
Why did I skip?

100
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,790
The moment, the moment...

101
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,130
I didn't think I'd get it!

102
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,570
Like, I didn't think I'd hit it.

103
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,270
All right, nice.

104
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,350
I didn't think I'd actually hit the gacha pool.

105
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,690
In fact, I didn't know.

106
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,590
You skipped yourself.

107
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,850
I didn't fucking know.

108
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,910
I'm stupid.

109
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,690
I was like, no, there's no way.

110
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,530
There's no way I hit those.

111
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,830
Oh my god, that's actually crazy.

112
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,510
That's why you never skip.

113
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,890
Oh shit, sweet.

114
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,750
Okay, nice.

115
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,550
That's cool.

116
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,570
I got my... Oh shit, I got gold.

117
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,170
Which gold is that?

118
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,590
Nice, I got another gold.

119
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,790
What do I get?

120
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,570
Who's here?

121
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,930
Again?

122
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,810
Are you fucking... Okay, I might as well put it on.

123
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,330
I...

124
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,910
Why do I get it again?

125
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,550
Are you serious?

126
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,070
There's so many other gold skins!

127
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,670
There's so many gold skins and I get her again.

128
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,450
Okay, by so many, there's also two other, but still.

129
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,570
Like, there's literally two other ones.

130
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,690
Like, how the fuck do I get it again?

131
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,670
Let's go gambling.

132
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,750
At least I get to see it this time.

133
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,130
At least, at least I get to see the roll this time.

134
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,250
Oh, there's three reds.

135
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,090
Oh, there's more pity.

136
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,930
The more you roll, the more pity you get.

137
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,270
See, there's three more.

138
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,890
Oh shit.

139
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,970
I swear to god.

140
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,090
I swear to fucking god.

141
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,350
I...

142
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,610
Oh, it's a gun this time.

143
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,330
Oh, hey!

144
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,370
Oh, fucking...

145
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,450
Are you serious?

146
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,010
How do I... how is it all that's...

147
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,730
There's so many other golds!

148
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,930
There's... oh!

149
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,610
Oh my god, I hit it.

150
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,570
I hit those.

151
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,750
Okay, what did I get?

152
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,050
Same gun skin this time.

153
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,610
They cannot give me another, another gun.

154
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,690
Oh, wait, is this for him?

155
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,330
Oh my god, I got the legendaries!

156
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,490
Oh my god, I got everything I planned.

157
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,450
All right, I'm done.

158
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,030
I'm done.

159
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,030
All right.

160
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,110
I'm done rolling.

161
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:52,870
How many more?

162
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,390
Oh, I literally... that was my last roll.

163
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,870
Oh my god, that's great.

164
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,670
That's literally my last roll.

165
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,890
Oh, that's good.

166
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,970
All right, let's see.

167
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,330
I'm gonna make sure I have... oh, nice.

168
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,570
I'm glad it was my last roll too.

169
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,570
Um, customize.

170
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,390
Um...

171
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,910
Wait, where's the gun skin?

172
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,950
Oh, wait, weapon skin.

173
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,370
There we go.

174
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,810
I might as well... Oh, I have it on already.

175
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,630
Okay, nice.

176
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,150
Do I have my... do I have a weapon skin for her?

177
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,350
Oh, I do.

178
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,990
I might as well, like...

179
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,450
Like, we're here anyway, I might as well.

180
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,050
All right.

181
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:33,790
Um...

182
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,030
Oh, wait, I rolled.

183
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,710
Wait, okay.

184
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,130
Um...

185
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,350
Okay, uh, I think we are...

186
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,050
Uh, I think we're good.

187
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,890
All right.

188
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:51,570
So, this is basically, um, this is a tactical shooter, but like with, uh, with anime girls.

189
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,270
And, um, so you guys know how tactical shooters work.

190
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,290
It's literally that.

191
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,930
Like, I don't know how else to explain it.

192
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,290
We played it before, guys.

193
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,650
We played it before.

194
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,570
So, like, it's...

195
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,170
It's very... it's based... I don't think much has changed since the last time we played it.

196
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:20,010
Um, but yes, if you guys want to check out the game, you can click on the link right now to download the game, I believe, and, um, and, uh, get some free rewards, like, pre-register and everything.

197
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,010
So, yeah, I'm super excited.

198
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,270
Oh, do I have some... Oh, hey, nice.

199
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:25,850
Congratulations.

200
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,350
Oh, I get an... I got, like, a special icon.

201
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,010
Okay, I'm gonna... I'm deafened.

202
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,510
Hello?

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,650
Hello?

204
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,390
Are you ready?

205
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,410
I sense... I asked to join your team.

206
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,250
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:39,850
Let me in.

208
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,910
All right, I'm ready.

209
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,010
How did you change your banner?

210
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,470
Uh...

211
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,950
Well...

212
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,570
Okay, well, I guess we'll find out later.

213
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,390
Yep, we'll find out.

214
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,630
I guess... we can only play one game anyway, so...

215
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,810
That's... dang, we were only able to play one game.

216
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,290
All right.

217
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,050
Um, where's the rest of our team?

218
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,690
Um, they are... we don't know.

219
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,650
Mac and I, we, like... Oh, yeah, I forgot to put you on screen, too.

220
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,110
Mac and I, we, like, we've been warming up, like, he's been warming up for, like, hours.

221
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,670
I've been warming up, like, what, two hours, I think.

222
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:17,970
Two hours.

223
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,130
And, um...

224
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:28,950
Um, when we were warming up, we saw the... our enemy team has been, like, um, in the server warming up together for, like...

225
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,590
basically, like, you know...

226
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,570
Uh, for, like, an hour and a half, so they're more locked in than us, like, that's all.

227
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,990
They're... they're very locked in compared to us.

228
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,410
Yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

229
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,990
Yeah, yeah, sure.

230
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,230
Okay, to be fair, to be fair, he's playing Deadlock, which is sort of similar to Shinova because it's third person.

231
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,670
So, like, yeah, so, like, it's almost the same thing.

232
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,670
Yeah, yeah, basically.

233
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,970
Yeah, yeah, like, like, as long as he's playing Sniper, nothing's different with Sniper, you know, like...

234
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,350
Sniper is, like, you're sniping, like, there's not much different.

235
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,830
Uh-huh.

236
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,710
All right.

237
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,850
I'm sure he's definitely playing Vindicta in Deadlock, too.

238
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

239
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,050
Still one-tricking, like, McGuinness or something.

240
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,910
Okay, my god, what is he doing right now?

241
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,270
Every time I run into him, that guy is just spamming McGuinness.

242
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,870
I know, I'm pretty sure that's what he's playing.

243
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,750
Oh my god, I hope he...

244
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,510
Well, let's see.

245
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,730
All right, guys, we're playing a pub, by the way, chat.

246
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,490
This is a pub, so we're just warming up right now.

247
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,910
We are the two players that...

248
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,250
sort of wanna... sort of not wanna get shit on.

249
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,750
We wanna be... oh, they're A, they're A.

250
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,550
Got them.

251
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,730
I have wind on there, too.

252
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,230
Um, they're on me.

253
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:09,970
Killed one mid.

254
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,790
They're all A, they're all... oh, there's a lot of them.

255
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,090
I got him.

256
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,350
Got him?

257
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,510
There's people on my other... who are next to me.

258
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,830
Our teammate died trying to save me.

259
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,790
Okay, I'm gonna do something dumb.

260
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,270
Help me!

261
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,310
Oh, I can't.

262
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,910
Our teammate doesn't care.

263
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,350
Oh my god, there's three!

264
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,870
Oh my god, I tried to... I'm never helping again.

265
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,310
I made a mistake.

266
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,990
I made a mistake.

267
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,790
Helping was... is a crime.

268
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,130
Never be a team player, chat.

269
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,530
Never be a team player.

270
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,750
Oh, it's a 1v1, but he's so low.

271
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,990
It's not over yet.

272
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,450
Is he not gonna push?

273
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,330
Oh, he's not.

274
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,230
He might plant.

275
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,470
Thanks for saving me.

276
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,650
Oh, he is planting.

277
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,430
That's ballsy.

278
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,420
Should be a free dub.

279
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,340
I think I got too many res me healers, so...

280
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,540
Oh, it's a sniper, so yeah.

281
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,840
Yeah.

282
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Oh, nice!

283
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,080
We should put this guy on our team.

284
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,140
Yeah, he seems locked in.

285
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,500
Yeah, yeah, he seems more locked in than the rest of us.

286
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
We might as well...

287
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Okay, I raised... I raised up Mac a little bit on Discord.

288
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
Wait, he has a katana?

289
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,060
Oh my god, he... he paid for this game.

290
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,620
By the way, Mac, like since he... you know, we have accounts that are like unlocked and everything.

291
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,100
Um, you know how we have everything?

292
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,260
Katana, you gotta play to win.

293
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,100
Yeah, you gotta like play to unlock a katana.

294
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,220
Wait, the secondary?

295
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Yeah, I think so.

296
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,640
I think so.

297
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,660
I'm pretty sure, right?

298
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,660
Unless, um, unless I'm wrong.

299
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,640
Oh no, all I know is my account had someone else's name on it when I first started playing.

300
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm waning.

301
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,940
Oh, there be?

302
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,060
Okay, I'm heading over.

303
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm flying over.

304
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,040
Okay, we're coming back.

305
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,060
We're running over.

306
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,120
Oh, you're so fucking...

307
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm heading over here.

308
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,880
I'm here.

309
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,280
They're coming over.

310
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,780
He's coming over.

311
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,540
I hit one for... I hit like two for a hundred.

312
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,060
Nice.

313
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,300
I have a win.

314
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,880
I have a win on them.

315
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,120
Or on me.

316
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,180
He's fucking burning me.

317
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
What the fuck?

318
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,620
He actually... He just ran in the burn.

319
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,640
Bro.

320
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,820
Alright, back at it again with this person.

321
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,180
Oh shit.

322
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,840
Okay, maybe I should get the burn.

323
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Oh my god.

324
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,440
Well, he has to do it now or...

325
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,740
I hate this guy.

326
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,560
I hate this guy.

327
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,460
He has to do it now or... Oh, he's getting body blocked by the enemy team.

328
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,620
No, he doesn't get it.

329
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,360
It's too late.

330
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,120
It's too late.

331
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,080
No, he's got it.

332
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,260
It's too free.

333
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,980
Oh, he got it.

334
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,720
It's too free.

335
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,480
Oh, okay.

336
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,480
Hey, let's send him an invite to join our team.

337
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,880
Yeah, sure.

338
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,740
You're good on deadlock, bro.

339
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:47,960
You got it.

340
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,400
Deadlock.

341
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, you're good.

342
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,600
No, no, we need him on sniper.

343
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,860
All right, let's roll.

344
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,220
We gotta flip the coin with the last two teammates and be like, hey, for the sake of our ego...

345
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,840
We need this guy.

346
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,200
He actually feels like he's been playing this for a while.

347
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,140
At least I got a kill.

348
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh, at least I'm not bottom fragger.

349
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,620
Who could that be?

350
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Unbound my scoreboard button.

351
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,280
Oh,

352
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,260
they're mid.

353
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,760
Oh, wait, no, they're not mid.

354
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,760
Oh, they're there.

355
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,660
Um, probably setting my turret in there.

356
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,620
I fucked up my turret.

357
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,920
Guys, I need you to know I was doing so well earlier in the warm-up with Mac.

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,080
Like, I don't know what happened to me.

359
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,960
I don't know what happened to me.

360
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,760
That is not the Gront Rewatch Max Bot.

361
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,860
I literally carried this fucker.

362
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,900
It's the stream debuff.

363
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,900
Every time I stream...

364
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,580
Every time I stream, it just hits different.

365
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,100
I just fuck around more when I'm streaming.

366
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,620
Oh shit, nice.

367
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
Look at that, we won.

368
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,620
We won.

369
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,600
Okay, now I'm locked in for real.

370
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,240
I'm for real locked in this time.

371
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,540
I'm just throwing matches for views, exactly.

372
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,360
Yeah, it's content.

373
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,660
It's content, guys.

374
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,960
Okay, I'm locked out.

375
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,340
What the fuck?

376
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,080
Someone's arrived.

377
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,460
Who is that?

378
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,000
Is that Surefour?

379
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,420
That's Surefour.

380
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,960
I fucking knew it.

381
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,120
Only you have a soundboard.

382
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,020
Only you have a soundboard.

383
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
What's wrong with my fucking soundboard, huh?

384
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,860
You got a fucking problem, or what?

385
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,100
You have a problem.

386
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,320
You don't use it often.

387
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,720
You should use it every time on stream.

388
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,180
My soundboard?

389
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,780
Yeah.

390
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,300
Yeah, well, no, I just play that song on stream every now and then, anyways.

391
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,580
Wait, is that song like DMCA-able?

392
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,480
Is that?

393
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,100
I don't know.

394
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,920
Oh my gosh, I swear.

395
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,080
Wait, he just got us both striked.

396
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,820
I swear to god, if that song...

397
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,380
I highly doubt that that song is DMCA, but...

398
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,900
If I lose my...

399
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,540
If I lose...

400
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,500
Hey, if you lose your ad revenue or whatever...

401
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,620
Get shit on, that's all I'm saying.

402
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,200
Okay, have you played Chernobyl at all?

403
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,620
Yeah, we played that one tournament.

404
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Yeah, but I mean like recently.

405
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,280
Like, is it too warm up at all?

406
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,180
I'm in the practice range right now.

407
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,580
That's something.

408
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,120
That's something, yeah.

409
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,140
I'll make sure she doesn't die.

410
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,340
You want to see my practice range aim training?

411
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,140
Yeah, no, we're in.

412
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,080
We're streaming right now.

413
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,500
What do you mean?

414
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
How could we see it?

415
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,620
No, I'm linking a clip in chat.

416
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,180
Oh.

417
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,560
All right, uh...

418
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,820
That's what I was up to.

419
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,380
Oh my god.

420
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,780
All right, you're playing sniper, right?

421
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,320
Yeah, I'm just gonna only pick snipers.

422
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:28,720
Okay.

423
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,300
Yeah, we all assumed that was what's gonna happen.

424
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,480
Yeah.

425
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,920
All right, I mean we have time.

426
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,320
You want to join the warm-up?

427
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,400
We have time for a warm-up game.

428
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,320
All right.

429
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,700
All right.

430
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,980
We just need to win three more rounds and then we can do it.

431
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,900
So you guys are owning.

432
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,420
Well, our team is owning.

433
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,420
I forgot to set up.

434
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,840
My name is in Chinese.

435
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,800
You can change your nickname in the profile.

436
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,240
Yeah, my name is Zaiwu when I started out.

437
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,340
How do I change my nickname?

438
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,780
You go to your profile and then there's a section called change nickname.

439
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:01,860
Oh, they're A.

440
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,280
They're A.

441
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,620
Or yeah, they're A.

442
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,840
Profile.

443
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,800
Career?

444
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,860
Um, top left.

445
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,300
Top left.

446
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,800
Top left.

447
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,910
Yeah, that's how you do it.

448
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,790
Oh, they planned it.

449
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:20,830
What's that?

450
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,210
Oh, I got slowed and blinded.

451
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,850
What if I just left it?

452
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,850
I mean you can.

453
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,030
Like it's a choice.

454
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,610
Wait, can I spend all the currency?

455
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,210
Yeah, you can.

456
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,710
Yeah.

457
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,890
Yippee, I'm gonna gamble.

458
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,750
I gotcha too.

459
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,670
You can gacha like eight times.

460
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,210
I have 87.

461
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,870
Uh, yeah, yeah, 10.

462
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,830
Yeah, you can gacha 10 times because you put 10 in there each time to unlock 10.

463
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,010
Wait, which one do I press?

464
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,590
You just press the right button.

465
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,410
Whatever color that right button was.

466
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,270
What's the difference between yellow and blue?

467
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,750
It's increase and decrease.

468
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,890
So like you take a card away.

469
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,450
So you gacha less things basically.

470
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,070
Oh, I didn't know that.

471
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,630
I just made like weird shapes.

472
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:11,470
I don't think it mattered.

473
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,810
The numbers increase?

474
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,990
What do you mean?

475
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,070
Yeah, I thought it was like a cosmetic increase.

476
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,270
Yeah, it's like 1 to 10 pulls.

477
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,170
Like you get to... you choose between 1 or 10 pulls.

478
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,110
It's literally gacha.

479
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,770
I got a purple!

480
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,750
Two purples!

481
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,190
Oh nice, nice.

482
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,290
Oh, they're AA, BBB.

483
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,150
I don't use either of those.

484
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,730
Again.

485
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,570
Then you just have bad gacha luck.

486
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,310
What can I say?

487
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,450
I'm not a lucky person.

488
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,130
I know.

489
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,470
I got a yellow!

490
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,970
Wait, that's good.

491
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,990
That's how you say you're not lucky.

492
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,950
I want the red one.

493
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,790
Yeah, it took me eight fucking pulls to get the red one.

494
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,030
Did you get the gun or the character skin?

495
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,670
I got Inari's shadow.

496
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,790
The fuck does that mean?

497
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,850
Nah, nah, it's about... I'm talking about the red.

498
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,530
The one Doki got.

499
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,490
Oh yeah, I got red.

500
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,430
I got a red skin.

501
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,050
Did you get the gun skin or the character?

502
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,770
I got character.

503
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,770
I got the Celeste red skin.

504
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,790
The rose one.

505
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,230
I got the gun.

506
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,850
I think like we have a guarantee red because we did eight pulls.

507
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,350
I got another yellow!

508
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,570
I got double with the yellow.

509
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,270
I got two dupes.

510
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,150
Oh shit.

511
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,070
I need to pick a side.

512
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,010
I got the sniper rifle skin!

513
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,970
They wanted Kochi street.

514
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,330
What the fuck is Kochi street?

515
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,870
Uh What the fuck does that mean?

516
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,890
What the fuck is that street called?

517
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,710
Oh that street.

518
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,790
I don't know.

519
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,610
Guys, do you want to attack or defense?

520
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,270
Do you want to attack or defense?

521
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,330
Yeah, flip a coin.

522
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:53,910
Fuck it.

523
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,530
It's a three-sided map.

524
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,770
It's a map with three sites.

525
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,430
Oh, it's that one.

526
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,270
Which one should we do?

527
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,470
Attack or defense for that?

528
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,850
Defense is better for sniper.

529
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,350
All right, we'll do defense.

530
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,170
I got another yellow!

531
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,590
All right.

532
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,270
They're like little sperms going into the color.

533
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,610
I got a dupe!

534
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,210
Should have been luckier, surefour.

535
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,330
Should have been luckier.

536
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,750
I'm not fucking lucky.

537
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,690
There's three chances at reds here.

538
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,110
Of course I get a red, right?

539
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,930
Yeah.

540
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,430
Sperm, go to the correct egg.

541
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,830
Guess not.

542
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,290
I'm rezzing.

543
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,790
We literally just need to win one round and then we're out.

544
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,310
Yellow!

545
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,790
I'm going to help our team.

546
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,370
I'm gonna help sad boonbox.

547
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,650
Oh, that's poor guy.

548
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,810
Poor guy.

549
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,970
It's very sad.

550
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,610
Sniper rifle!

551
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,450
Oh, wait, that's good.

552
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,110
Oh shit.

553
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,330
Oh my god.

554
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,830
I didn't see him.

555
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,550
Yeah, I got flanked.

556
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,290
Oh, please if you guys win this we don't have to play another round.

557
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,350
Red!

558
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,800
Guys, do you even think they'll notice your sniper cosmetic?

559
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,420
Rose knight!

560
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,340
Celestia!

561
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,700
Oh, I got that too!

562
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,780
You're not playing her.

563
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,400
She's not sniper.

564
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,220
It's fucking bullshit.

565
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,160
Oh, you're fucking dead.

566
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,760
There's no way.

567
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,480
Bro!

568
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,100
I got the... I got the top gun skin though.

569
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,760
That's why I'm at her.

570
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,820
Yo, they're just guarding the bot.

571
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,200
What if they flank you in the back?

572
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,980
Wouldn't that be funny?

573
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,100
Oh, no, they're all three there.

574
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,420
All three of them are in front of you.

575
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,080
I saw them.

576
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,460
This is the other sniper, isn't it?

577
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,820
I thought instantly.

578
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,020
Limited offer.

579
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,300
I'm gonna have the bomb.

580
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,080
Wait, can I spend the currency?

581
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:14,860
Yeah, you can.

582
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,040
You can literally spend as much as you want as long as...

583
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,640
I can do whatever I want.

584
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,600
You can do whatever you want, true4.

585
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,960
You can literally do whatever the fuck you want.

586
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,160
I can do whatever I want.

587
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,460
Okay, slash root.

588
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,120
All right, I have bomb.

589
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,080
Where are we going?

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,380
We're all at different areas.

591
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,560
I think it's just an A rush.

592
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,520
All right.

593
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,500
Oh my god, they want me to roll again.

594
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,140
Okay.

595
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,500
Does anyone know if the other game's done yet?

596
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,980
Like how many games they have left?

597
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,000
Does anyone know?

598
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,480
I don't know.

599
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,170
Fuck.

600
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,210
Oh shit.

601
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,310
I hope you're guarding this.

602
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,670
I hope you're guarding this.

603
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,450
I love gambling.

604
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,230
Oh my god.

605
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,650
I'm fine.

606
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,310
I'm not fine.

607
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm not fine.

608
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,330
It was not good.

609
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,110
Oh, it's time to hold everything.

610
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,230
It's not okay.

611
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,450
It's not okay.

612
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,670
One more, one more.

613
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,490
I'm not moving.

614
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,110
Yay!

615
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,110
Wait, what did he say?

616
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,810
He said he loves you.

617
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,050
To who?

618
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,430
I couldn't even hear the beginning.

619
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,090
I just thought, oh shit.

620
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,130
Someone said they love you?

621
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,170
I was like, who the fuck said that?

622
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,590
All right, uh, Trifor, what's your tag?

623
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,830
What's your numbers?

624
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,430
No, it doesn't do username.

625
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,090
It does numbers.

626
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,650
Oh, so you hate me.

627
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,670
I mean, the game hates you.

628
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,290
How do I do the tag?

629
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:01,890
The ID?

630
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:02,870
All right, here.

631
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,910
I gave you mine.

632
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,530
I copied.

633
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,450
And then... I copied.

634
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,570
I posted it.

635
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,190
Okay, I forgot that.

636
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:11,910
Oh, there you can be.

637
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,390
I forgot.

638
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,030
I was like, everybody could see it too.

639
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,030
So...

640
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,950
Yeah, just leak it.

641
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,210
It's fine.

642
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,970
It's fine.

643
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:18,590
It's fine.

644
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,710
I'll leak, I'll leak Trifor and my ID.

645
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,850
So then we both get uh, spammed.

646
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,750
It's like... I don't want to get spammed.

647
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,350
Well, it's too late.

648
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,870
I already leaked it on stream.

649
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,230
Trifor, pick a map.

650
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,530
Pick a map you like the best.

651
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,310
We got map pick.

652
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,310
You think I know the fucking maps?

653
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,310
Well, I don't know the map either.

654
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,730
Pick a map.

655
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,290
I'm gonna pick a shitty map.

656
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,330
Pick the one that's good for sniper rifle.

657
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,950
Bro, I don't... they might do attack.

658
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,870
They might choose like defense so you can't...

659
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,470
Well, I'm gonna snipe on offense too.

660
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,750
Okay, I mean true.

661
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,870
Um, wait, where is...

662
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,510
Why can't I... How do I change the girl on my main screen?

663
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,670
Accept my friend request.

664
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,170
You can't.

665
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:01,850
I don't think so.

666
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,890
This is fucking bullshit.

667
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:04,470
All right.

668
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,170
I'll just write whichever is the sniper.

669
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,290
Whichever is the sniper.

670
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,450
Yeah, you have to code to add friend.

671
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,510
And then... What the fuck?

672
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,750
That's weird.

673
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,970
I accepted it.

674
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,550
All right, and then uh, invite to team.

675
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,690
Ignore their requests for five minutes.

676
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,030
Nice.

677
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:26,190
Nice.

678
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:26,530
All right.

679
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,310
Wait, you have to look at my clip though.

680
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,150
That's what I was doing.

681
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,890
Okay, all right, uh, let's see.

682
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,550
I'll look at your clip.

683
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,110
Okay, sure.

684
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,390
Yeah, I just wrote whichever is the sniper map and they just handed us a map.

685
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,290
What are you doing?

686
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:49,890
That's good for me.

687
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,660
What the fuck were you doing?

688
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,920
What are you doing?

689
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,580
Oh my god.

690
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,480
Did I have... Oh, thank god they didn't hear it.

691
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,040
What do you mean?

692
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,940
I didn't hear it.

693
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,500
Fucking your mic.

694
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,240
What the fuck?

695
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,480
Is it like a webcam mic?

696
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,840
I didn't fucking hear it.

697
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,800
Is that a fucking webcam mic?

698
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,940
What the fuck is that?

699
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,060
No, I added uh, on my microphone.

700
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,940
I added a uh, what did I do?

701
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,340
What did you do?

702
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,560
I added a compressor and gain.

703
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,640
Oh, the why?

704
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,180
I also, I also sang the mine diamond song.

705
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:37,560
Oh my, okay guys, um, if you guys want to watch his clip, I'll link it right now, but like be warned.

706
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,840
That's all I'll say.

707
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,320
All right, queue us up.

708
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,680
We have like time for one game.

709
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,310
He's very loud.

710
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,190
All right.

711
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,470
I'm not.

712
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,850
Okay, from this clip.

713
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,650
Yes, you are.

714
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,930
Okay, dude.

715
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,530
All right.

716
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,990
Uh, back, queue us up.

717
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,350
Oh, he's afk.

718
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,390
Oh, he's fucking deafened.

719
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,590
Oh, he's literally the leader.

720
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,530
What is he?

721
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,130
Oh, queue us up.

722
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,150
How many, how many cans flew off your desk during that mic check?

723
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,690
Be honest.

724
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,590
Only two.

725
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,350
It sounded like at least four.

726
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,910
Uh, there's a lot of cans in my room.

727
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,170
Oh, we got into the game.

728
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,670
Nice.

729
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,410
Enter link.

730
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,310
Who's this fucker that didn't enter?

731
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,810
Who the fuck is this guy?

732
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,430
He's deafened.

733
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,070
Jokey, that clip made me deaf.

734
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,350
I told, I warned you guys.

735
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,230
I told you guys he was very, I gave you guys a warning.

736
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,010
It wasn't loud.

737
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,030
I gave you guys that warning.

738
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,590
Why do they have a main stage and a sub stage?

739
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,770
I think sub stage is for, I think we're on both main stages.

740
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,170
So like, dude, I'm gonna make up for it right now.

741
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,450
Because there's two, two matches that are going on at the same time.

742
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,030
But why did they put us, why did they give us both main stage?

743
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:22,430
Like,

744
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,670
that's fucked.

745
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,250
They gave us both the main stages.

746
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,570
Yeah, because we're poggers.

747
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,170
My neighbors are yelling me because I had my windows open and that was on speakers.

748
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,630
Thanks, Jerkboy.

749
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:40,870
Thank you.

750
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,610
Hey, you're welcome.

751
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,850
That's what I'm here for.

752
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,730
All right, guys, I, how's the sound now, guys?

753
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,930
How's the audio balancing now?

754
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,870
All right, all right, I'll, I'll take the spike.

755
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,490
Why the fuck is this?

756
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,170
Is this the, oh, this is the, is this the map we're playing first?

757
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,650
Uh, yeah.

758
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:05,950
No.

759
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,870
No, wait, no, wait.

760
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,590
I don't remember.

761
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,290
Wait, did we pick a three-lane map?

762
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,230
Yeah, we did.

763
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,170
This might be it.

764
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,070
This is literally what he wanted.

765
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,170
Okay, well, we don't want to go A, I don't think.

766
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,190
This is what he wanted.

767
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,510
Where do I follow?

768
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,890
I'm following, we're going, we're going A.

769
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,610
That's where everybody is.

770
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,320
Maybe we shouldn't have picked this map.

771
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,200
Eh, we'll be fine.

772
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,020
We'll get a dub.

773
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,940
We'll get at least one dub, right, guys?

774
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,660
Just one dub.

775
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,820
Wait, they're saying we can now enter the match to prepare.

776
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,560
Oh, um, we're missing two players.

777
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,020
One guy I think is still sleeping because he's EU.

778
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,420
I have C, by the way.

779
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,220
You have C?

780
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,440
Okay.

781
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,120
Wait, that guy's won.

782
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,640
Yeah, well, I just downed someone.

783
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,240
I'm planting, cover me.

784
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,100
There's someone to my left.

785
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,920
Sniper Diff.

786
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,180
I might die.

787
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,800
I might just play this guy.

788
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,100
Oh, shit, let's go!

789
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,020
Fuck every other character I've played before.

790
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,480
Who are you playing?

791
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,900
Uh, I don't even know his name, but he looks like Dante.

792
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,320
Okay, now you decide to swap after you fucking grinded this all?

793
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,500
Oh my god.

794
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,560
After you grinded all of these?

795
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,360
I one tapped a guy in the head and it felt really nice.

796
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,560
That's who I was going to play, but I like snipers.

797
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,940
Yeah, this is a 1v1.

798
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,160
Yeah, this is a 1v1.

799
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,780
This is a sniper, but it's like a DMR.

800
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,180
I've got like a catalyst wall.

802
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,140
Oh, that guy!

803
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:50,920
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

804
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,820
He's got the mirror realm shit.

805
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,420
Yeah, he's got the mirror realm, yeah.

806
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,560
It's like, welcome to my domain.

807
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,060
Domain expansion.

808
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,520
Dollar General Catalyst.

809
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,540
Alright.

810
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,480
How'd that not hit?

811
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,760
Peeking in.

812
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,480
Peeking in.

813
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,340
Peeking in.

814
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,900
Peeking in.

815
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,560
Alright, I'm walking through the wall.

816
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,820
I'm walking through the wall now.

817
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,100
Left side!

818
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,740
Left side!

819
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,680
That's the wrong grenade.

820
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,820
I'm taking high ground.

821
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,220
I'm fucking lost in this wall.

822
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,660
That guy's one shot.

823
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,600
Behind you!

824
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:24,940
Behind you!

825
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,520
Behind you!

826
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,820
Where am I?

827
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,180
Oh my god.

828
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,420
I'm taking out the cat!

829
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,260
I came out of my wall into a smoke grenade and then walked into a real wall.

830
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,700
For about five seconds.

831
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,140
It's fun.

832
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,860
We gotta win this fast, guys.

833
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,180
Where's like three of our...

834
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Where's two of our other teammates?

835
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,080
I don't know, team captain.

836
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,860
Where are they?

837
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,880
I don't fucking know.

838
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,780
One of them is online right now.

839
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,580
But where's the...

840
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,860
The other one was in a general channel above this channel I saw.

841
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,880
Dude, let's switch it up.

842
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,740
Let's go C, boys.

843
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,740
Wait, why did it...

844
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,220
Yeah, I'm down.

845
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,040
C was dope.

846
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,100
Alright, I'm homing over.

847
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,360
We can...

848
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,280
We can do this, I believe.

849
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,160
Oh my god, I just upskirted.

850
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh my god.

851
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,440
How do you feel?

852
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,860
Nothing.

853
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,240
Are you okay?

854
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,460
What do you mean, nothing?

855
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
Split my site in half.

856
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,560
Wait, it doesn't work.

857
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,900
Oh shit.

858
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,120
Oh my god, you gave them a one-way.

859
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,880
Who has the bomb?

860
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,320
Matt, you have the bomb!

861
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,100
It's me!

862
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,780
Okay, we got it.

863
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,360
I killed him.

864
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:57,900
360.

865
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,500
I was like, where did the bomb go?

866
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,180
Okay, let me lower the screen a little bit.

867
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,660
What the frick?

868
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,040
Don't frickin' silence me.

869
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm not silencing just you.

870
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,340
My voice will be heard.

871
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,760
Okay.

872
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,360
I DM'd them.

873
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,860
We are in VC.

874
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,580
It's gonna be just us three.

875
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,840
We're gonna have to 3v5.

876
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,780
Well, technically 4v5.

877
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,800
We do have a sub.

878
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,420
Who's our sub?

879
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,580
One of the community members who's been playing Shinova for like a while now.

880
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,760
Wait, put him in.

881
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,380
Did you just wake up?

882
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,420
Yeah.

883
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,300
Okay.

884
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,900
They're rezzing!

885
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,180
Finish him!

886
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,620
They're behind a frickin' wall!

887
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,720
Then walk up!

888
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,780
I have the bomb.

889
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,000
I am!

890
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,300
Oh my god.

891
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm frickin' rezzing you.

892
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,220
Noob down.

893
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,460
Yeah, it's been taken out.

894
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm planning.

895
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm planning this corner.

896
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,160
We're doing it.

897
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,260
You should've got a katana if you're playing sniper.

898
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,260
Katana?

899
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:19,900
Yeah, you can.

900
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,500
Instead of a pistol, you get a katana.

901
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,000
Why the frick would I get a katana as a sniper rifle?

902
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,540
Because when they push you, you can bring up the frickin' sword and be like, I have the enemy on my side.

903
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,540
Okay, so what if they're mid-range?

904
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,680
Then shoot them with your sniper.

905
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,820
Yo, I'm taking out the frickin' Uzi, bro.

906
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,540
Oh, you got the Uzi, bro?

907
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,400
You got the Uzi?

908
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,560
I got the frickin' Deagle.

909
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,220
I got the Uzi.

910
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,400
The shotgun might not be real, I don't know.

911
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,500
That looks more like a Deag.

912
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,200
Wait, Nex, have you downloaded the game yet?

913
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,040
I don't know.

914
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,860
Yeah, yeah, I did that yesterday.

915
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,720
Alright, alright.

916
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,020
I just had to.

917
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,180
Boom, headshot.

918
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Let's go.

919
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,900
I have no idea where is a good place.

920
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,840
Okay, I'm planting.

921
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,540
If I die, it's your fault.

922
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,540
Denied.

923
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,040
Okay, I planted.

924
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,700
What is this bubble?

925
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,440
Where are you?

926
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,680
There you go.

927
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,340
Boom, headshot.

928
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,120
Boom, headshot.

929
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:24,920
Where?

930
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,880
Where?

931
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,120
Victory.

932
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,040
Yes, we did it.

933
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,860
You know what?

934
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,620
They're gonna not even go...

935
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,940
They're not even gonna fucking walk towards you.

936
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,240
That guy has TTV in his name.

937
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,900
He has 6 damage.

938
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,500
He has 6 damage.

939
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,740
Are you really?

940
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,540
Bro.

941
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,260
That's fucked.

942
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,820
He's ready to go in his chat and just be like, SLAM!

943
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,880
Bro, he's gonna get banned on Twitch.

944
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,260
Is that bannable now?

945
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,060
Bullying is bannable, yeah.

946
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,980
Just go in there and be like, you did really good.

947
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,020
And then give a smile.

948
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,340
I'll say, my name is Deez.

949
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,650
My audio...

950
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:16,970
Wait.

951
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,250
Sound guy, I...

952
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,030
Sound guy, I lowered the discord.

953
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,030
This guy is getting solo killed by the turret.

954
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,610
Oh, he finally stopped.

955
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,270
Tyler, please.

956
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,090
Tyler.

957
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,150
I have to use my heals on you.

958
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:29,810
Alright.

959
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,930
TTV are down.

960
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,430
Oh my god.

961
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,130
That's all you needed.

962
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,890
I have a dirty flank.

963
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:39,810
I've arrived.

964
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:40,570
I'm rezzing.

965
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,410
I'm okay.

966
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,350
I killed one.

967
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,090
I need to reload.

968
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,650
Nice!

969
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,810
We did it!

970
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,530
We literally won one more game.

971
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,710
Healing grenade out.

972
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,370
Wait, I can't...

973
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,870
I can't pick the guy I just played on defense.

974
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,370
Fuck.

975
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,610
He's a one-sider.

976
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,670
That's just how it is.

977
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,390
What does the interceptor do?

978
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,430
I don't know.

979
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,070
I think it gets rid of other people's utility.

980
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,770
Because it's interceptor.

981
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,390
I'm going to sit in the corner with a shotgun.

982
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,290
That's all I can think about what it does.

983
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,030
Guys, look.

984
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:20,650
I'm top gun.

985
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,630
Alright, sound guy.

986
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,430
Lowered it a bit.

987
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:23,810
More again.

988
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,230
Yeah, I have a guy that helps me deal with sound balancing.

989
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,450
Because I can't do it myself.

990
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,710
He's just sound guy?

991
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,330
That's fucked up.

992
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,410
That's his name!

993
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,950
I didn't even give him a nickname.

994
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,610
Like CG or some shit.

995
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:38,530
CG?

996
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:40,910
Yeah, sound guy.

997
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,390
The whole point is that...

998
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,230
Did you spell sound with a C?

999
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,190
Yeah.

1000
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,130
For real?

1001
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,990
I don't think that's how it's spelled.

1002
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,470
Hey, words can be whatever I want them to be.

1003
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,950
Because words are a social construct and changing all the time.

1004
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,710
Then why are you...

1005
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,390
Why can't we call you...

1006
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,490
Why is it not C-U-R-E?

1007
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,190
Or why is it spelled with an S?

1008
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,990
Why is surefour spelled with an S then?

1009
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,990
Why is it surefour spelled with a C?

1010
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,070
Well, because actually my name was a randomly generated name on Xbox Live.

1011
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,290
Yeah, so you're letting...

1012
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,710
You're letting an AI decide...

1013
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,330
Dictate your name?

1014
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,850
Yeah, I'd do it again.

1015
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,690
Wow, you're not even gonna...

1016
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,070
So you're letting a robot decide for you.

1017
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,210
So you have no free will, essentially.

1018
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,050
All I'm saying is...

1019
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,590
If robots took over and they said...

1020
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,150
Listen, you don't have to work anymore.

1021
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,890
You're just gonna have to let us take over.

1022
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,090
I'd be like, I bet I'm gonna be on Throne and Liberty.

1023
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,250
Yeah, same.

1024
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,050
That's what I'm saying.

1025
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,590
Yeah, but how would you make money?

1026
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,710
Hey, if they're controlling everything, I don't need to make money.

1027
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,250
I'm pretty sure money is still...

1028
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,170
Yeah, I'm pretty sure money is still a thing.

1029
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:58,690
MVP!

1030
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,610
Jesus Christ.

1031
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,640
Alright, but like...

1032
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,620
If sex robots were a thing...

1033
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,000
Would you let that take over?

1034
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,820
Oh, zero.

1035
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,440
I didn't even have to hear the end of that.

1036
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,220
I just said, yeah.

1037
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,600
He's like, yeah, I'm down.

1038
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:26,100
I don't think we can play another game.

1039
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,840
I don't think.

1040
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,980
So we are missing one more person.

1041
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,460
So the sub might have to come in here if...

1042
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,620
If that other person's not here.

1043
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,760
I'm on my...

1044
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,160
I'm on my kill ranking grind in Throne and Liberty.

1045
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,260
Oh shit, is it fun?

1046
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,520
Is that the one from Amazon?

1047
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,060
Yeah, it's very fun.

1048
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,640
Our guild is a four man alliance.

1049
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,100
And we're just running the server.

1050
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,420
We're on Benediction.

1051
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,880
Okay, I'm on...

1052
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,740
I'm on Amos.

1053
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,360
Was that free to play or early access?

1054
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,960
Early access one.

1055
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,440
We were at early access at the start.

1056
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,100
But then someone had to like, not play for a bit.

1057
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,740
So then we switched to free to play servers.

1058
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,760
For a fresh start.

1059
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:09,900
Yeah.

1060
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,940
Wait, apparently...

1061
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Aztec is currently playing a different game.

1062
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,860
Why is he playing?

1063
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,880
Is he playing Destiny?

1064
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,620
Wait, oh no, he's playing Descendant.

1065
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,620
The first Descendant.

1066
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,220
Does he remember?

1067
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,800
That game is more of like, the ass Descendant.

1068
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,400
Damn.

1069
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,520
Bunny got a sick one.

1070
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,740
Someone's like, leaks your force friend code.

1071
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,580
I already did.

1072
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,720
You gotta wait until the VOD's over.

1073
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,860
Who's fucking leaking my friend code?

1074
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,900
I don't think he's gonna like, come back to Trenova after this.

1075
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,240
I think he's gonna stick with Deadlock.

1076
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,900
Why the fuck would you say that?

1077
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,060
Prove me wrong then.

1078
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,120
Prove me wrong.

1079
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,740
Prove Dee's wrong.

1080
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,980
Exactly, you're not even gonna prove me wrong.

1081
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,540
I'm on the Throne of Liberty grind.

1082
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1083
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,600
I'm launching Throne of Liberty real quick.

1084
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,240
Alright.

1085
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,640
Wait, I can see...

1086
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,940
Alright guys, you guys wanna see Shur4's friend code?

1087
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,560
Guys, all I'm saying is that everything has a price.

1088
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,740
That's not true.

1089
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,240
Everything has a price.

1090
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,660
That's not true.

1091
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,420
How do we...

1092
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,660
Okay, you can now...

1093
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,760
The players can now...

1094
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,400
It'll be our turn.

1095
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,320
I'll provide the room code and passcode later.

1096
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,300
Wait, where are they at?

1097
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,340
Are you a spendy, Abarely?

1098
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,520
What does that even mean?

1099
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,520
Oh, he's AFK.

1100
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,300
What does that even mean?

1101
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,700
You can semi pay to win in Throne of Liberty.

1102
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,040
Oh, also by the way...

1103
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,900
The team...

1104
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,540
The team we're playing against is currently...

1105
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,640
Getting it's 7-1 right now.

1106
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,520
So, they're not...

1107
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,460
They're not having a good time.

1108
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,020
They're not having a good time.

1109
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,220
Cause like the...

1110
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,620
You remember the Yuki Aim team?

1111
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,500
That team won the finals.

1112
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,260
I'm pretty sure.

1113
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,980
I think that team won the championship.

1114
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,780
On that first tournament.

1115
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,100
Not surprising.

1116
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,020
Yeah, we're about to put them in a blender though.

1117
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,540
This is about to be too free.

1118
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,120
Alright.

1119
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,960
We got this.

1120
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,120
I believe in us.

1121
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,220
It can't be that bad.

1122
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,120
Lyrics in the Yuki Aim team.

1123
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,760
Oh, this is too free.

1124
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,680
Speak your truth, Meg.

1125
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,940
What do you mean which one?

1126
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,140
There's literally one lyric.

1127
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,140
There's a lot of lyrics.

1128
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,340
Wait, there's a lot of lyrics?

1129
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,780
There's variety guy lyrics?

1130
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,540
Lyric, there's listic, there's lyric.

1131
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,000
There's lyric that used to be an Apex streamer.

1132
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,380
Oh, that lyric.

1133
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,060
Yeah.

1134
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,100
Is he still free or what?

1135
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,080
It's not as free, but it's still kind of free.

1136
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,720
I put my Throne of Liberty character in the general chat.

1137
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,960
Wait, what build are you?

1138
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,520
Longbow Dagger.

1139
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:18,920
What?

1140
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,480
What's wrong with that?

1141
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,800
Wait, a 3.2k on a free-to-play server?

1142
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:26,720
Yeah.

1143
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,400
I wonder how that happened.

1144
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,100
Oh, you see that ring over there?

1145
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,560
That's a ring of universal power.

1146
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,320
Oh, I sold one of those.

1147
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,660
I sold mine for 25k.

1148
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,840
I sold mine for like 18k, I think.

1149
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:42,940
Nice.

1150
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,840
Wait, did you swipe?

1151
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,660
Of course!

1152
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,720
I was gonna say, 3200?

1153
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,080
That's crazy.

1154
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,260
The other people buy watches, cars, and other things, and expensive clothing.

1155
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:05,540
Me, someone who lives in their house all the time, I buy items and games to flex and shit on other people in PvP.

1156
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,060
Understandable.

1157
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm at like 2950, but I'm Sword and Shield Wand.

1158
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,120
Ah, little healer boy.

1159
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,600
Oh, you never die?

1160
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,860
Yeah, exactly.

1161
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,940
I was a Mercy main in Overwatch.

1162
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,740
You were a Mercy main?!

1163
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,720
How the fuck did you become an Apex pro being a Mercy main in Overwatch?

1164
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,620
I was thinking that too!

1165
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,820
I was like, how do you go from Mercy main to fucking Apex pro?

1166
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,820
Dude, I was just good at it.

1167
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,180
I don't know.

1168
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,740
I played the others in Overwatch.

1169
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,340
There was like two seasons, I one-tricked Mercy, and then went on.

1170
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,240
I came out, I played Ana.

1171
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,880
You one-trick!

1172
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,480
Not even at Mercy main, you were a one-trick!

1173
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,680
Every Mercy player is a one-trick, what do you mean?

1174
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,660
Yeah, man!

1175
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,820
If you hear anyone ever say, yeah, I play Mercy, you know that's the only person they pick.

1176
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,940
Yeah!

1177
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:09,040
100% I did not know...

1178
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,540
Okay, of everybody, I'd say I would not expect an act to be a fucking Mercy main.

1179
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,120
Yeah, I get that reaction a lot.

1180
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,700
They're like, what?

1181
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,860
Wait, why did you play the other support?

1182
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,740
What was it about Mercy that just made you one-of-one-trick?

1183
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,020
He's a heal slut, bro.

1184
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,320
I got immense satisfaction out of hiding like a bitch while my whole team died and then flying out and rezzing everybody.

1185
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,500
You're a dad!

1186
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,620
Oh my god, you're the die-on point!

1187
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,000
I have rezzed!

1188
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,260
Literally.

1189
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,740
I was like, die-on point, don't blow ults, just get their ults and then we reheat.

1190
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,220
I'm just hiding in a corner.

1191
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,000
He was that Mercy.

1192
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,960
Literally hiding in the King's Row bathroom.

1193
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,540
That shit worked, though.

1194
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,280
It did.

1195
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:01,760
It was great.

1196
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,640
It did, and the Zarya saves the grab for it.

1197
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,940
So the Zarya would grab and then you would Mercy Rez.

1198
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,420
Oh, that's true, that's true.

1199
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,740
Sometimes you'd be ratting and you'd find the enemy team's Mercy also ratting in a corner and you'd have a little fucking pistol off.

1200
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,840
Blasting each other with the blickies.

1201
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,500
That shit was awesome.

1202
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,020
Oh my god.

1203
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,940
That's crazy.

1204
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:36,800
I don't think Aztec is coming.

1205
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,540
He's doing a sponsored stream for the First Descendant.

1206
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,900
A sponsored stream during the tournament.

1207
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,120
Alright, bring the community member in.

1208
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,880
Tag him in.

1209
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,400
I think he accidentally overscheduled.

1210
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:03,980
It's alright.

1211
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,220
It's okay.

1212
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,460
As long as we four know what we're doing.

1213
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,720
Bro, my game is still patching.

1214
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,540
You're still patching?

1215
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,760
Wait, you've been patching this entire time?

1216
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Yeah, literally.

1217
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,440
I can't even get in the game.

1218
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,660
Wait, what percentage are you at?

1219
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,820
85 and it's been on death for like 10 minutes.

1220
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,160
What?

1221
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,580
Alright, grab another community member in.

1222
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:31,700
Wait,

1223
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,300
next, what are you gonna play?

1224
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,060
The shard girl again, probably.

1225
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,340
Yeah, that's what he played last time.

1226
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,540
Okay, you gotta stop pushing up though.

1227
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,060
The only person Wildfrag was sure for, okay?

1228
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:48,560
Shush.

1229
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,340
I was MVP.

1230
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:53,960
You were MVP.

1231
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,780
Yeah, yeah, he was MVP.

1232
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,960
You gotta remember, you're playing against people who are NA next.

1233
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,700
You gotta remember your ping.

1234
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,980
You gotta remember your ping with the shard girl.

1235
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,680
The shard girl is like, frag.

1236
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:18,640
I think Aztec is streaming right now, but he has another sponsored stream right now.

1237
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,440
Yeah, I don't know if he's... like, we added him, but...

1238
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,400
The radio is silent from him, so we don't know.

1239
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,460
Yeah, so, I mean, and we see him streaming at the moment, so...

1240
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,920
But I think he has to do a sponsored stream, so I don't know.

1241
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,060
Alright.

1242
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,380
Yeah, alright.

1243
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,900
You guys have fun.

1244
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,580
Thank you.

1245
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,420
He's gone.

1246
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,860
Only an MMO could make me fix my... well, semi-fix my sleep schedule.

1247
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,440
How?

1248
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:51,880
What?

1249
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,120
Shouldn't that ruin it?

1250
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,300
Well, so, there's a bunch of, like, scheduling things and throwing away your night.

1251
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,020
And World Bosses spawn at 12 at my time, and I normally wake up at, like, 3 PM.

1252
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,040
Wait, so what time do you sleep right now?

1253
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,360
I usually went to bed at 7 AM every day, but now I've been going to bed at, like, 3 or 4 AM.

1254
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,760
And waking up at 11.30.

1255
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:11,980
Oh!

1256
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,340
Or you go to bed when they do maintenance.

1257
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,280
Yeah, fucking...

1258
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,360
They'll just be like, maintenance will begin in 2 hours.

1259
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,020
Game will be online for 8 hours.

1260
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,900
I'm just like, damn!

1261
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,100
I would finish streaming and be like, yeah, thrown in liberty time.

1262
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,100
Maintenance in 2 hours.

1263
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,360
I'm like, what the fuck?!

1264
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,340
That's what you get for locking it.

1265
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,220
That's what you get.

1266
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,480
This is fucking bullshit.

1267
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,360
Shouldn't have locked you hard.

1268
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,040
I'm locking my shit.

1269
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,540
I got locks on my dick, bro.

1270
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,320
Alright, codes up.

1271
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,180
Codes up.

1272
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,160
I'm gonna hide my screen just in case.

1273
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,100
Dude, I can see whatever I want because you're an indie now.

1274
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,380
That's true.

1275
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,380
But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1276
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,080
Wait, wait, wait.

1277
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,400
What's your problem?

1278
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,000
Why was that an instant 80?

1279
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,140
Why'd you backpedal like that?

1280
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,880
Wait, because...

1281
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,280
Huh?

1282
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,900
Because there's some things I know you want to say and I cannot.

1283
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,560
Like what?

1284
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,360
I'm not going to be specific here.

1285
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,980
That's not true because I could still get cancelled.

1286
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,940
No, you can't.

1287
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,620
I don't say anything that cancels you.

1288
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,880
What?

1289
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,720
I'm going to sue for, what's the word, defamation.

1290
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,540
Defamation?

1291
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,740
Yeah, this is defamation right now.

1292
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,500
Alright, do it.

1293
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,780
Do it right now.

1294
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,540
Get that lawyer in.

1295
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,360
I'll get that freaking lawyer.

1296
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah?

1297
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,360
Yeah.

1298
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,940
No boss, you would never sue me.

1299
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,940
I would be able to just join this lobby without putting a password.

1300
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,020
Are they sure they have a password?

1301
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,560
Oh yeah, you should have said that out loud.

1302
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,820
No, but none of us showed the code anyway.

1303
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,080
Yeah, I didn't show it.

1304
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,320
Yeah, I definitely didn't show the code.

1305
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,700
It sure is a good thing that no one showed the code.

1306
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,660
Yo, what's up Aqua?

1307
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,380
How's it going?

1308
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,640
Oh, hi.

1309
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,480
Hello.

1310
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,100
Wait, someone's right.

1311
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,080
Can't sue for defamation.

1312
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,240
There's nothing to defame.

1313
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
That's right.

1314
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,760
You were defaming me.

1315
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,580
You were saying I could get you banned.

1316
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,980
No, I said cancelled.

1317
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,020
I said you could get me cancelled.

1318
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,900
Yeah, that's defamation.

1319
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,040
That's not defamation.

1320
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,540
It depends on what you say.

1321
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,080
Exactly, but you're leaving it open.

1322
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,760
And everyone's imaginations are wandering to the worst things.

1323
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,540
That's not even defamation.

1324
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,640
VTubers aren't real.

1325
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,560
You're right.

1326
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,400
How do you sue a VTuber?

1327
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,720
We're not even real.

1328
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,860
I hire a hacker.

1329
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,200
You hire and delete the program.

1330
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,860
Delete the PNG off the internet.

1331
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:16,840
Yeah.

1332
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,220
Okay, so how are we playing?

1333
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,580
Okay, so next you're playing the shark.

1334
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,160
Aqua, what are you playing?

1335
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,340
I just fill whatever you guys don't want to play.

1336
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,200
Okay, cool.

1337
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,420
I like the Symmetra girl.

1338
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,760
I know he likes the Symmetra girl.

1339
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,740
Yeah, but that's the character only I know how to play.

1340
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,020
I'm the only one that responded to it.

1341
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,660
No, yeah, I know.

1342
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,300
Oh, yeah, you are.

1343
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,060
You're very... See, you're so social, Surefour.

1344
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:44,960
I'm a good teammate.

1345
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,280
You're a good person.

1346
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,500
I didn't respond to it.

1347
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,200
I'm sorry.

1348
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,440
I got ghosted.

1349
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,060
I'm sorry.

1350
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,660
Yeah, okay, I apologize.

1351
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,280
Our other teammates didn't apologize.

1352
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,960
They're trying to pretend nothing happened.

1353
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:58,860
Oh, I was sleeping.

1354
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,740
I got added to the Discord late.

1355
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,260
You got added?

1356
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,820
You got added, but like posted that after you got added.

1357
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,000
So you should have seen it.

1358
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,400
I can literally look at timestamps.

1359
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,540
It literally shows you.

1360
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,680
Okay, I'm looking at general.

1361
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,580
You got added at 12.01pm yesterday.

1362
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,420
And they posted that clip at like... where is it?

1363
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,020
I don't know.

1364
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,800
You didn't see it either.

1365
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,620
You don't even know where it is.

1366
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,240
They deleted it.

1367
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,620
They posted that at 9.48pm.

1368
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,460
No, they didn't.

1369
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,460
Okay, it's there somewhere.

1370
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,140
It's around that time because they posted two gifs.

1371
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,020
Oh, it's 7.31pm because Surefour replied SimGaming.

1372
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,300
Okay, there you go.

1373
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,800
7.09pm.

1374
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,700
And you were added seven hours before he posted that clip.

1375
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,560
No, I wasn't.

1376
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,120
I literally can see in the general.

1377
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,960
The best part about that clip is that we still lost the game.

1378
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,680
Oh, that's not gonna happen to us, right?

1379
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,220
Yeah, yeah.

1380
00:59:59,220 --> 00:59:59,920
Surely not.

1381
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:00,640
Surely not.

1382
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,500
That's not gonna happen to us.

1383
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,360
We're sweeping today.

1384
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,060
Awesome.

1385
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:06,860
Oh, yeah.

1386
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,700
We don't lose.

1387
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,200
We don't do that.

1388
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,600
Okay, so next.

1389
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,420
How's it going with your thing?

1390
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,380
Now, it's verifying, but it's going faster.

1391
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,480
It's on 25%.

1392
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,440
Okay, holy shit.

1393
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,920
It's on 25%?

1394
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,360
Now, 50.

1395
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,600
Okay, this one is faster.

1396
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,420
Okay, okay.

1397
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,200
I was gonna be like, there's a lot.

1398
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,720
That's a lot of percentage.

1399
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,740
I know.

1400
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,080
It's at 69 now.

1401
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,480
Next, why didn't you patch this before you went to bed?

1402
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,000
I didn't think there would be a huge-ass fucking patch.

1403
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,560
What do you mean?

1404
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,480
I downloaded the game a day ago and I was like, okay, that's good enough, right?

1405
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,140
It's okay.

1406
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Everything is fine.

1407
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,040
I believe in us.

1408
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,540
It's fine.

1409
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
I don't need to do this.

1410
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,260
Okay, um...

1411
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,540
What do you guys want to play?

1412
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,420
Wait, they're still in another game.

1413
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,060
They're still playing another- wait, why are we here?

1414
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,740
We could have just played our game.

1415
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,640
We could play one game, like, by ourselves.

1416
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,480
Wait, can we still do that now?

1417
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,380
I mean, we could.

1418
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,620
I mean, they're literally- it's like 0-2, so we could literally do a game.

1419
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,160
Are we gonna be- Alright, are you guys- Are we gonna be bad boys?

1420
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,080
Let's do it.

1421
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,640
Okay, I'm done.

1422
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,740
Alright, let's do it.

1423
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:28,620
If anything, if you're gonna blame anybody, we'll just say the community member who told us to.

1424
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

1425
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,560
That's good, right?

1426
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,220
Yeah, alright.

1427
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,800
No, no, no, no, no.

1428
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,020
I don't know about that one.

1429
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,480
Do it for the team!

1430
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,020
As the designated substitute, you gotta- No, you're the- you're the team captain, I think you should do it for me.

1431
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,640
Yes, and as the team captain, I can delegate.

1432
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,080
Is this dude still patching?

1433
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:49,600
Yeah, he is.

1434
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,700
I am getting on a right meow.

1435
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:56,740
Oh,

1436
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,840
wait, did they finish?

1437
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,580
Oh, they did.

1438
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,340
Okay, thank God.

1439
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,480
Guys, thank God we didn't.

1440
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,160
Guys, thank God we didn't.

1441
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,040
Yeah, we didn't leave.

1442
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,920
Thank God I stopped this in time.

1443
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:11,580
Chat?

1444
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,540
Oh my God, thank God.

1445
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,800
I'm gonna get some Coke, bro.

1446
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,000
All right.

1447
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,040
I'm just waiting for our...

1448
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,160
the other team to come in.

1449
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:23,780
All right.

1450
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,500
We're still waiting for it.

1451
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,720
You're booting it up right now, right?

1452
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,100
Next?

1453
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,180
Yeah, yeah.

1454
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:32,980
How do I get in?

1455
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,880
Um, they give us a code in our team, uh, custom teammate.

1456
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,700
Search to room code.

1457
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,180
Got it.

1458
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,300
All right, we're in.

1459
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,100
Is your sense okay?

1460
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,740
Did you configure your settings?

1461
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:52,780
Yeah, I did that.

1462
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,600
Okay, thank God.

1463
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,000
All right.

1464
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,000
I just had to be sure.

1465
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,260
Not everything, but maybe like...

1466
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,180
Just had to be sure.

1467
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,320
All right.

1468
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,200
Should we... Are we all ready to go?

1469
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,160
Oh, y'all be not tipping the morning to you.

1470
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,580
All right, we're all ready, right?

1471
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:24,620
No.

1472
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:25,380
Okay.

1473
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,560
I am.

1474
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,620
All right, we're all mostly ready.

1475
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,000
My no is alive, by the way.

1476
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,080
All right, I am.

1477
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,980
I'll press R.

1478
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,020
Wait, room.

1479
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:42,760
R.

1480
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,500
Universal.

1481
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,880
Universal ready up.

1482
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,300
Level 64?

1483
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,400
Who's level 64?

1484
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,600
Oh, shit.

1485
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,060
I think she... She's a grinder.

1486
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,120
I know, I think she just got like extra XP cards.

1487
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,800
Oh, that's gonna be like... We all got that.

1488
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,560
Yeah, but we didn't.

1489
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,020
We didn't use it.

1490
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,100
She got like more than us, I think.

1491
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,140
Wait, how?

1492
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,420
Why the hell did she get XP?

1493
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:10,760
Yeah.

1494
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,260
Yeah, yeah.

1495
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1496
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,380
Where's my co-attack?

1497
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,380
Yeah, yeah.

1498
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,700
I'm sponsored.

1499
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,720
Where's my XP?

1500
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,460
Wait, what?

1501
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,420
What are you gonna say?

1502
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,600
You know, like...

1503
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:26,420
What?

1504
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:27,480
Mernie.

1505
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:28,580
Oh, true.

1506
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,620
I don't need those.

1507
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,120
Yeah, you're right.

1508
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:30,940
I don't need XP cards.

1509
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:31,380
You're right.

1510
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,360
You can buy the XP cards.

1511
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,700
Yeah, why are you complaining?

1512
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,480
Uh, because complaining is fun sometimes.

1513
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,920
Yeah, I don't need the XP cards.

1514
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,520
I got... I got more than enough.

1515
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,380
Wait, do we need um...

1516
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,220
Don't we uh...

1517
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,140
What the fuck?

1518
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,700
What is this world chat shit going on?

1519
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,080
I just minimized it.

1520
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,240
There's wild shit in there.

1521
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,260
That's... Yeah, there's wild shit.

1522
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,300
I just minimized it, you know.

1523
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,060
Okay, so...

1524
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,040
Those are the people you have to worry about canceling you.

1525
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:14,920
Yeah, yeah.

1526
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,120
Wait, how do you minimize it?

1527
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,440
The little button right beside it.

1528
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,300
Oh, there it is!

1529
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:26,780
Okay, guys, just so you guys know, if you see something really fucked up in the world chat, it was... I was very unaware.

1530
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,680
So, I'm sorry.

1531
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,800
I was very unaware.

1532
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,720
Well, do you have to ready up, Mac?

1533
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,140
Oh, do I?

1534
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:40,020
It'd be funny if we start the game after that.

1535
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:41,720
I don't know.

1536
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,220
Are they just introducing us?

1537
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:47,680
Maybe.

1538
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,580
Introduce Deez.

1539
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:49,940
Nah.

1540
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,340
There it is.

1541
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,500
Next, what's 25?

1542
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,340
Oh, yeah, we're doing Windytown.

1543
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,380
We're doing that.

1544
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,340
He's nuts in your mouth.

1545
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,360
Fuck you.

1546
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,700
Got him.

1547
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,640
I don't want to play anymore.

1548
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,540
Look what you did, Jerm4.

1549
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,480
We lost.

1550
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,980
Team Cohesion up.

1551
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,460
Chemistry up.

1552
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,220
Oh my god.

1553
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,500
We're...

1554
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,980
Are they actually introducing us, guys?

1555
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:35,240
I don't want to pull up the stream because I don't want to seem like I'm stream sniping.

1556
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,080
Because we managed to convince them not to put a three minute delay.

1557
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,220
So, we gotta do that.

1558
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:42,940
I don't know.

1559
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,720
I think you were like, do we have to?

1560
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,420
I just went, wait, we gotta do this?

1561
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,620
Yeah, and then they're like, never.

1562
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,040
No, you don't.

1563
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,820
Yeah, because originally, wait, we missed.

1564
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,120
Wait, what happened to next?

1565
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,340
Uh, my disconnected.

1566
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,080
Wait, how did you disconnect?

1567
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,920
My internet is very good.

1568
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,160
Oh, no.

1569
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,000
Are we next?

1570
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,200
Are we truly, truly, do we know what happened?

1571
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,040
Are we gonna need another sub?

1572
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,840
Yeah, we're gonna need another substitute next?

1573
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,440
What's going on here?

1574
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,300
Gotta be truthful next.

1575
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,020
Nah, I'll be fine.

1576
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,420
My cable is just fucked.

1577
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,360
I need to buy a new one.

1578
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,300
I'll be fine.

1579
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,060
He lies.

1580
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,140
He lies naturally.

1581
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,460
It's not like you guys could find a fucking person to come in at this point.

1582
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,740
Oh, you won't.

1583
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,960
Yeah, you want to bet, son?

1584
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,760
You want to bet?

1585
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,520
We will fucking add the discord.

1586
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,300
Yeah, you're replaceable.

1587
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,860
We're like team cohesion, guys, right?

1588
01:07:59,300 --> 01:07:59,740
True.

1589
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,140
True.

1590
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,520
We would lose that.

1591
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,660
Yeah, we would, but we can rebuild it.

1592
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,220
We can remake it.

1593
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:05,560
Oh, come on.

1594
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,200
I just have to ask a new person.

1595
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,560
Yes, yeah, that's it.

1596
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,640
That's all you have to do.

1597
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,780
That's toxic doki.

1598
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,800
Surefour started it!

1599
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,160
Why am I getting blamed?

1600
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,400
I'm a bully.

1601
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,820
I'm a bully.

1602
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,780
I'm just an enabler.

1603
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:28,800
True.

1604
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,100
That's different.

1605
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,160
I'm just enabling surefour to continue.

1606
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,420
I would be doing it anyways.

1607
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,800
The vibes, we're raising up the vibes already.

1608
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,560
I like how mac is staying quiet because he doesn't want to be the next target.

1609
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,640
I'm just existing, man.

1610
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,260
He's probably got throne of liberty on his second monitor.

1611
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,460
Oh, that's true.

1612
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,680
That's true.

1613
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,400
What?

1614
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,180
I mean we can look at it on steam.

1615
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,280
Yeah.

1616
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,260
I'm looking on steam.

1617
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,980
Wait, do I even have you on steam?

1618
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,040
Mac, I don't even know.

1619
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,720
I don't think you do.

1620
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,960
You could be appearing offline.

1621
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,120
That's true.

1622
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,840
I see so many other people on throne and liberty right now.

1623
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,800
I would be on it.

1624
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,400
It's a good game.

1625
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,020
It's a great game.

1626
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,560
I can't get into MOBAs or MMOs.

1627
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,440
Sorry, MMOs.

1628
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,720
Sorry, they're both starts with M.

1629
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,780
Better in life than having an MMO you can grind.

1630
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,040
Yeah, I can never get into it.

1631
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,020
I've tried a lot of MMOs and none of them have gotten me interested, but throne of liberty I actually like.

1632
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,220
Wait, what's up with throne and liberty that was different?

1633
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,620
PvP.

1634
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,680
That's really it.

1635
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,020
I like killing people.

1636
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,820
Ah, in game.

1637
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:47,560
Yeah.

1638
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:48,940
Yeah.

1639
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,820
Yeah, where else would it be?

1640
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:52,960
Yeah.

1641
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,720
It's great, especially before.

1642
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,140
Oh, you can go.

1643
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:57,460
Sorry.

1644
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,720
Especially when you pull up with like your whole guild to like a world boss and then there's another.

1645
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,160
Oh, yeah.

1646
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,440
And then you just have a war.

1647
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:08,220
Oh, you can fight another another team like another guild while you're doing it.

1648
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,400
Some some world bosses are in conflict.

1649
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,160
So the entire area is just PvP on so it's it can be like 200 people.

1650
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,040
That's crazy.

1651
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:32,760
Yeah, dungeons will have it happen too like dungeons some of them will like Their doors will close at nighttime, but yeah inside the dungeon when the door closes and it's nighttime, it becomes a conflict zone So it's just a free for all for everyone that's locked in And then if you kill everyone the dungeon's yours,

1652
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,680
yeah, you just get the freest loot.

1653
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:42,760
It's it's actually just Oh, that sounds interesting That was my last my last uh Open world event I did

1654
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:52,660
Yeah, the only thing I don't like is needing to like defend boonstones and shit like that I think that stuff's annoying.

1655
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,960
That's fun Why is it fun?

1656
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:03,380
I mean my my guild when when we went to do it It was we just got slaughtered because the guy that was leading it was Why did you have him as the leader then?

1657
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:21,760
Our our guild is the slaughterers so it's fun The way the boonstones work is you a boonstone gives you a boon obviously for the when you have it, but people can Say they're gonna challenge it for the right to fight for it.

1658
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:35,240
Yeah, and it's basically like that guilt 70 versus 70 for like 14 minutes And whoever wins and holds in that 14 minutes gets the boonstone Oh, so you just gotta protect the territory.

1659
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:39,840
Yeah, it's basically a ctf Oh capture.

1660
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:48,300
Oh I see well, it's more it's more king of the hilly because it's like there's one there's a flag in the middle and then like everyone's basically Fighting on this like pillar.

01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:09,030
Okay, okay.

1767
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,110
Let's go off set again.

1768
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,790
They probably ulted.

1769
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:13,810
They're bombing.

1770
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:14,830
They're defusing.

1771
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:15,370
They're on bomb.

1772
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:15,810
They're on bomb.

1773
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:16,190
Yeah.

1774
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,170
I think they stopped.

1775
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:17,750
I think they stopped.

1776
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:18,430
Oh, fuck!

1777
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:19,090
There's a guy right here.

1778
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:19,950
Nice, nice, nice.

1779
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:22,050
There's a sniper over here on me.

1780
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,350
Dude, why is that hitting?

1781
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,140
They're defusing.

1782
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:29,620
They're defusing.

1783
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:30,340
Nice.

1784
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,400
I killed the sniper.

1785
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,480
They're using the bear as cover again.

1786
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,380
They have not a fucking...

1787
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,620
They fucking tried to defuse three times.

1788
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:39,860
Yippee!

1789
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:40,580
Yippee!

1790
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,180
Yippee!

1791
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:43,900
Yippee!

1792
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,260
That guy was defusing behind the bear.

1793
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,280
He was just like...

1794
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:47,780
No!

1795
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,380
He just used the bear as cover.

1796
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:49,800
That's an actual shot.

1797
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,620
That's an actual shot.

1798
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,120
Holy shit!

1799
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,840
And then we got there again!

1800
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,740
Let's do it!

1801
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,920
Let's keep doing it!

1802
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,120
One more time!

1803
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,840
Like, what's stopping us?

1804
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,980
Let's just do it again.

1805
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,240
They can't stop us.

1806
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,220
Literally nothing.

1807
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,140
Exactly.

1808
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,080
If it works, it works.

1809
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:06,660
Yeah.

1810
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,480
I'm scanning the high ground.

1811
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,380
Let's go!

1812
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,340
I'm just a heal bot.

1813
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,900
Now it's my turn.

1814
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,180
Yeah, they really don't want to shoot through my wall.

1815
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:18,920
They're scared.

1816
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,720
This is great.

1817
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,300
This is working.

1818
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,980
Okay, there's one.

1819
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:22,600
Two up top!

1820
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,040
Two up top!

1821
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:23,880
They're holding their own.

1822
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:24,620
They're trying.

1823
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:24,980
They're trying.

1824
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,000
We have to fight for this now.

1825
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:26,960
We have to fight for the space.

1826
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,940
Guys, maybe we shouldn't have done this again.

1827
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,380
Does this guy know he's scanned, though?

1828
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:34,820
I don't think so.

1829
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:35,100
I don't think they do.

1830
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,060
I got wanted.

1831
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:36,720
Bear?

1832
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,120
Nair?

1833
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,420
I smoked that high peek.

1834
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,420
I'm looking at...

1835
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,240
I got a healing nade for you.

1836
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,560
I got a healing nade for you.

1837
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:44,900
I got two.

1838
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:45,400
I got two.

1839
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,040
Yeah, I got a healing.

1840
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,840
You're getting healed.

1841
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,280
You're getting healed.

1842
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,860
Can you just hold this angle?

1843
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,740
Did we plan already or no?

1844
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,200
Oh, wait!

1845
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,800
Our push is done.

1846
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,500
I can't go over there.

1847
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,220
Yeah, I can try to pick up bomb.

1848
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,200
Yeah, I walled the left side if you want to go for the plant.

1849
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,740
It's my ult wall, so you can't get shot.

1850
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:05,560
I got two.

1851
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:06,540
Nice, nice.

1852
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,500
I'm healing you.

1853
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,860
Nice, nice.

1854
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,880
I almost got an ace.

1855
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,520
I was going for the ace, bro.

1856
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,100
It's fine.

1857
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:15,600
It happens.

1858
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,460
We still got it.

1859
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,460
Okay, maybe we should go A now.

1860
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,760
Do you really want to give them a point?

1861
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1862
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,280
Are you trying to 9-0 with that?

1863
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,520
No, I messed with that.

1864
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,200
I fucked with that.

1865
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,260
Yeah, yeah.

1866
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,180
We're here to send a message.

1867
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:37,980
It's about sending a message.

1868
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,580
Yeah, exactly.

1869
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,360
We can keep going B and just go 9-0.

1870
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:41,680
Yeah, exactly.

1871
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,120
And then we feel good about ourselves.

1872
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,160
Yeah, it goes to 9.

1873
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,260
When we fight, you key aim.

1874
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,620
That's when we can, you know, that's when we can get karma.

1875
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,200
Yeah, that's when we get 9-0ed.

1876
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:51,440
Yeah.

1877
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,760
Bottom bridge.

1878
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:55,580
Yep.

1879
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,240
Sniper 50.

1880
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,440
Eyes dead.

1881
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,400
We can put the wall up.

1882
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,000
Okay.

1883
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,580
I'm coming.

1884
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,700
I healed you.

1885
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,140
I'm not looking at the right side, so I'm going to look.

1886
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,500
Right now.

1887
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,080
I don't see nobody.

1888
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,700
Unless you want to.

1889
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,680
You can look at it.

1890
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,540
Got you, I healed you.

1891
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:24,820
He's in spawn.

1892
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:25,880
Oh, he is?

1893
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:26,760
I'm hunting him.

1894
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,380
I'm hunting him.

1895
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:27,800
Alright, let's go.

1896
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,160
He ran.

1897
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:28,920
Let's go.

1898
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:29,640
I found him.

1899
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,160
He's right there.

1900
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:30,680
He's right there.

1901
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,400
You got this.

1902
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:32,880
You got this.

1903
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:33,260
Yeah!

1904
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,140
Yippee!

1905
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:35,860
Yippee!

1906
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:36,960
Yippee!

1907
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,700
Let's go!

1908
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,980
How many more rounds are we just...

1909
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,120
We just keep doing it.

1910
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,700
Until it doesn't work.

1911
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:44,820
Yeah, until it doesn't work.

1912
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,880
No, I meant like, when do we switch sides?

1913
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,340
Oh, six.

1914
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,180
Wait, I haven't done a rank in a while.

1915
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,720
How many points is switching...

1916
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,120
Press the control thing and then you can see.

1917
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:55,960
The control thing?

1918
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:56,400
The control?

1919
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,940
You mean tab?

1920
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:58,740
Tab?

1921
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,260
Oh, three more rounds.

1922
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:02,960
Three more rounds.

1923
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:03,760
Okay.

1924
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,680
The control thing.

1925
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,040
Dude, all you've done is die, you freaking noob.

1926
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,900
Nah, I got the most damage.

1927
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:11,880
Look at that shit, okay?

1928
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 73 synergy.

1929
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:15,360
Yeah, yeah.

1930
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,360
He's been planting.

1931
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,440
I fucked up my sonar.

1932
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,880
Here you go, I got you.

1933
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,880
I got a heal for you.

1934
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,880
I gave you two of my heals.

1935
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,220
I got the sniper.

1936
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,140
Nice, I'm pushing up.

1937
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,180
I'm nading the Noct.

1938
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,100
I'm gonna try to...

1939
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,040
Yeah, I'm gonna try to thirst the Noct if your nade doesn't hit.

1940
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,420
I'm gonna...

1941
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:35,660
Oh, nice.

1942
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,280
Nice, nice, nice.

1943
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,840
Oh, we can try to get the wall down.

1944
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,880
I gave you another heal so you can go and keep planting.

1945
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,760
Just keep planting.

1946
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,600
There's a guy to the right side, yeah?

1947
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:47,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1948
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,600
Oh, to the left side, too.

1949
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,720
Oh, they pushed the left.

1950
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,700
They were ready this time.

1951
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:53,900
Yeah.

1952
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,260
I'm so bad.

1953
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,700
Through your wall.

1954
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:00,280
Through the wall.

1955
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,080
Oh, wait.

1956
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,860
No, there was one right there.

1957
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:03,780
They weren't getting scanned.

1958
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,060
Wait, I'm res-able.

1959
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,020
Where are you?

1960
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,340
I can't see anything.

1961
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:07,660
I'm up top.

1962
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,000
I'm so confused with this area.

1963
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,400
There's only one left.

1964
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,640
Only one left.

1965
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,240
Where is he?

1966
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,120
On me, Ducky.

1967
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:13,880
Oh, he is?

1968
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:14,360
Oh, okay.

1969
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,180
Oh, he's...

1970
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,060
He's on you?

1971
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,400
Thank you.

1972
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,520
He's on himself?

1973
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:19,600
Yeah, I got him.

1974
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:19,920
I got him.

1975
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,680
Wait, you didn't even pick me up!

1976
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,300
Oh, wait, no.

1977
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:22,800
No, of course not.

1978
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,600
Hey, guys.

1979
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:31,200
I max-traded.

1980
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:33,460
Nice.

1981
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:34,480
Nice.

1982
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,600
I haven't even had an opportunity to use my ult.

1983
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,180
Me, too.

1984
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,240
Let's go in.

1985
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:43,700
Let's go plant.

1986
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:44,620
I don't want to die.

1987
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:45,740
It's okay.

1988
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,300
That's why I'm here.

1989
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,760
I heal you through this plant.

1990
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:48,440
True, true.

1991
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:48,700
Exactly.

1992
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,240
Yeah, yeah.

1993
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,700
I heal you through the plant so you can live.

1994
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,420
That's your life right now.

1995
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,700
Dude, what a fucked up game.

1996
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,080
Wait, no.

1997
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,940
Your ult is revive, right?

1998
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:59,720
So you should ult and then go plant.

1999
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,160
Mine?

2000
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:01,960
I don't think so.

2001
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:02,700
Mine is like...

2002
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:03,040
Isn't it?

2003
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:03,780
What is my ult?

2004
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:04,440
I don't...

2005
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,080
I'm pretty sure.

2006
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:05,860
Isn't it?

2007
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,520
One's bridge.

2008
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,760
Yeah, it can ult while he plants.

2009
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,020
Yeah.

2010
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:09,440
One for them.

2011
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,370
Are you kidding me?

2012
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:15,090
Oh.

2013
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:19,110
There's a person here on this side.

2014
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:21,750
Oh, I almost got sniped.

2015
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:22,710
He's to the right.

2016
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:23,770
He left already.

2017
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:24,470
Okay.

2018
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,750
Alright, ult and plant next.

2019
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:27,430
Ult and plant.

2020
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:28,310
That's the strat.

2021
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,410
Oh, I got...

2022
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:30,610
I got bombed.

2023
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:31,890
Oh my...

2024
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:32,030
Okay.

2025
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:33,330
Let me ult for you.

2026
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,830
Let me ult for you.

2027
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,790
Thank you.

2028
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:35,230
Oh, I got you.

2029
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:35,850
Oh, the left.

2030
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:36,190
The left.

2031
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:36,350
The left.

2032
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:38,990
They're pushing.

2033
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:39,890
Oh, they're pushing.

2034
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:40,810
I got...

2035
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:41,050
I traded.

2036
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:41,450
I traded.

2037
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,750
I traded.

2038
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,290
I traded.

2039
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,050
I traded.

2040
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:44,090
I traded.

2041
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,290
Oh, it's winnable next.

2042
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:45,790
This is it.

2043
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:47,110
This is your character arc.

2044
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,070
This is your character arc.

2045
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:49,410
Bye.

2046
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:53,170
That was in your character arc.

2047
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:55,850
Wait.

2048
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,530
We couldn't get the 9-0 after all.

2049
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:58,830
That's alright.

2050
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:59,770
We go A now.

2051
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:00,810
Now we go A.

2052
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:01,930
Now we...

2053
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:03,830
No, no, no.

2054
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:07,310
They're going to expect us to go a different site because we lost.

2055
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,490
So we just go again.

2056
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:08,910
That's true.

2057
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:09,590
That's true.

2058
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:10,150
That's true.

2059
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:11,150
That's so true.

2060
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:14,780
Alright.

2061
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,460
We figured it out.

2062
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:20,090
Okay.

2063
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,330
And then after...

2064
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,890
After that, then we go A.

2065
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:23,250
No, no, no.

2066
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:25,810
Because then they're surely going to believe that we go A.

2067
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,230
So we just go B again.

2068
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:31,630
We never couldn't experience A?

2069
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,090
Is that...

2070
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:33,990
Is that it?

2071
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:37,470
I only want to experience a site while defending it.

2072
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:41,450
I want to know what A looks like in a competitive sense.

2073
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,160
Guys, they're set up.

2074
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,920
Guys, I think they know we were going to go B, guys.

2075
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,660
Hey, we could late rotate.

2076
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,800
You want to do it?

2077
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,800
Me and Nex are getting a little active.

2078
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:58,400
Okay.

2079
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,440
And then we're pushing up.

2080
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,600
We can go back.

2081
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:01,240
Alright.

2082
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:01,440
Bye.

2083
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:01,780
Alright.

2084
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,100
Let's go.

2085
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:02,580
Let's go.

2086
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,460
Bye-bye.

2087
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,200
Let's go A.

2088
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:06,880
I'll wait for you guys.

2089
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,900
You guys want to go through mid or go full rotation?

2090
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,020
What do you think, IGL?

2091
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,860
I think going through A mid is fine.

2092
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,360
I'm just going to throw an interceptor down, then we'll just run through it.

2093
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,500
Can you smoke this?

2094
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,500
Can you smoke my ping here?

2095
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:22,860
I cannot right now.

2096
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,480
One sec, one sec.

2097
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,960
I'm taking high ground A side.

2098
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:28,560
I got one.

2099
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,260
That's one.

2100
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:29,720
Nice.

2101
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,100
I'll just run through.

2102
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,400
Run through the window and then go to site.

2103
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,700
I got scan in a second.

2104
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,580
Abe, you can probably start lurking up through B.

2105
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,220
I'm going to take high ground here.

2106
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,440
There's still one guy that's holding A.

2107
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,220
No one in spawn right now.

2108
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:46,740
Oh, I see.

2109
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,540
Oh my god.

2110
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,540
I don't know where people are.

2111
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:55,550
They're all there.

2112
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:57,170
Holy shit, they're all there.

2113
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:58,070
You guys okay?

2114
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,830
He has backshots.

2115
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,530
Wait, there's one on site.

2116
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:02,870
Wait, who's giving backshots?

2117
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:03,550
Ow, to the left.

2118
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:06,070
Abe is giving backshots.

2119
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:06,790
I got him.

2120
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:07,290
I got the guy on site.

2121
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:07,990
I got him on site.

2122
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:08,650
I got him too.

2123
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:09,950
He's 1 HP.

2124
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:10,690
I got your trade.

2125
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:12,330
Nice, let's go.

2126
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,370
Okay, now we go back to B, right?

2127
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:16,570
No, now we go B again.

2128
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,450
Oh, wait, we're defending.

2129
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:18,430
We can't do it anymore.

2130
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:20,070
Now we go B on defense.

2131
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:24,450
Okay, whatever you guys want me to.

2132
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,830
Okay, wait.

2133
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:27,210
You want me to play Celestia or I can play Maddalena?

2134
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,810
Whatever you think we need the most.

2135
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:30,410
I'm playing Sniper.

2136
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,090
He's just going to be on Sniper.

2137
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:33,890
Yeah, I'll play Celestia.

2138
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,660
I'm going B.

2139
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,180
I'm going to play the bear.

2140
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,920
You never even played the bear before.

2141
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,660
Yeah, I've been experimenting.

2142
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,500
What happened to those three hours?

2143
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:48,320
What?

2144
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,200
Look, man.

2145
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,880
I just decided that Aubrey just had to win.

2146
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:52,960
It's just that simple.

2147
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,380
All the women.

2148
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,380
Alright, I'll go A then.

2149
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,400
I'll be the sole A defender.

2150
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,920
Oh my god, I'm a calico cat.

2151
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,160
Oh my god, Neko.

2152
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:11,680
Alright.

2153
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,220
Guys, what if they all rush A?

2154
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,340
What do I do?

2155
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,780
You hold the line until backup comes.

2156
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,140
What if I die for it?

2157
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,020
Well, that's fucking war, isn't it?

2158
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:30,560
I'd die for the country.

2159
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,440
You'd die for your country and your cause.

2160
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,240
Will you remember me?

2161
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,140
They're going mid.

2162
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:36,400
Will you remember me?

2163
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,140
Oh my god.

2164
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,540
They're cheating, they're hacking.

2165
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,540
Wait, wait, wait.

2166
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,140
There's one.

2167
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,280
It's stupid.

2168
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,980
Hacker reporting hacker man.

2169
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,520
Report, report.

2170
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,680
But he's playing the same character as you.

2171
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,440
Oh god.

2172
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:50,980
Wait, they're mid, they're mid, they're mid.

2173
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,020
There's one B.

2174
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,220
They're looking at me.

2175
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,220
There's one B, man.

2176
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,860
Oh shit, I got sniped, I got sniped.

2177
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:58,420
Two B, two B.

2178
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,380
I'll try to help you B.

2179
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:01,440
I downed one.

2180
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,120
Meredith's dead.

2181
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,900
Ming behind you, Ming behind you.

2182
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,320
Nice, nice, nice.

2183
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:06,720
Oh my god.

2184
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,040
I'm doing a win.

2185
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,180
I'm win-grenading up there.

2186
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,200
I'm win-grenading up there.

2187
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:13,700
On me, on me.

2188
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:15,880
I'm killing the guy in the win-grenade.

2189
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,620
One's going to A.

2190
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:19,860
I killed him.

2191
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:21,840
There's one left.

2192
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,360
I got one, I got him, I got him, I got him.

2193
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,100
Let's go.

2194
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,160
You know what?

2195
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,440
I think I'm fine with Aztek not being on our team.

2196
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,100
Dude, that's fucked up.

2197
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,040
Wait, wait.

2198
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,940
Why is bottom frag saying something like that, bro?

2199
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,660
You're one in five.

2200
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,740
You have five deaths.

2201
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,380
You almost have the entire team combined deaths.

2202
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,760
Look at my synergy though.

2203
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,520
What the fuck does synergy even mean?

2204
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,260
I don't know.

2205
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,040
I don't know.

2206
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,760
Well, I'm obviously the most skilled in the lobby.

2207
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,180
That's shown by Tab, with skill.

2208
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,120
51.

2209
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,000
There's nothing B.

2210
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,380
Oh my god, I don't see anyone A yet.

2211
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,000
I'm rotating, I'm rotating.

2212
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:17,700
Wait, wait, wait.

2213
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,020
I think they're mid, I think they're mid.

2214
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:19,880
Yeah, yeah.

2215
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,600
Wait, I can double jump on this character?

2216
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:23,480
Can I jump shot?

2217
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,280
They all can double jump.

2218
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,980
They all can double jump.

2219
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,560
I see them, I see them.

2220
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:29,120
They're over here.

2221
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,640
Yeah, there's two mid.

2222
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,560
I'm just sitting invisible on top of site.

2223
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,020
A lot of mid, a lot of mid.

2224
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:34,780
There's so many mid.

2225
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,880
Please help me.

2226
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,880
We're right here.

2227
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,020
We're literally right here.

2228
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,400
Wait, no, don't rotate off.

2229
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,020
Wait, wait, wait, they're here.

2230
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:40,920
They're on me, they're on me, they're on me.

2231
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,160
Wait, wait, wait, there's one on B, there's one on B.

2232
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,740
We can kill this one.

2233
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,940
I hit one for 89.

2234
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,400
They're on my turret, they're on my turret.

2235
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,080
I can't do anything.

2236
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:49,600
They're planting.

2237
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2238
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,240
I'll fight this guy, I'll fight this guy.

2239
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,000
They're low, they're low, they're low.

2240
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:53,660
Planting is low.

2241
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:57,710
Help me.

2242
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:58,990
I got two.

2243
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:00,530
Oh my god.

2244
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:01,350
They're pushing.

2245
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:04,190
Help me.

2246
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:05,590
I got one, I got one.

2247
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:06,970
There's only one left.

2248
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:07,470
I'm coming over.

2249
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,470
I need uppies, I need uppies.

2250
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:10,790
I'm literally heading over to you.

2251
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,790
I swear to god.

2252
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:15,750
I swear to god.

2253
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,550
I swear to god.

2254
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,370
You let me die.

2255
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:20,910
What are you doing?

2256
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:22,150
What are you doing for me?

2257
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:24,210
I was getting to cover.

2258
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:30,710
We did it, guys.

2259
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:31,330
We did it.

2260
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:32,190
Look at that now.

2261
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,170
Who's the fucking bottom?

2262
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:33,870
Actually, I am.

2263
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:34,950
You are still bottom frag.

2264
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,710
You just have more synergy points.

2265
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:38,170
You literally...

2266
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,670
I am better.

2267
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:41,150
I am better.

2268
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:42,570
You literally...

2269
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:46,510
The only reason why you're not bottom frag is because you are bottom frag.

2270
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:47,710
You just have more synergy.

2271
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:49,590
Shh, shh, shh.

2272
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:56,970
They want to ban you.

2273
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,570
That's all we have.

2274
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:02,350
That's our sub!

2275
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,710
They can bring their sub in.

2276
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,870
They can literally bring in their sub.

2277
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:13,310
Just play with their sub.

2278
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,930
Is it best of three?

2279
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,770
Yeah, so we do one more map and we win this.

2280
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,830
This is the last map.

2281
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,470
I thought it was best of one.

2282
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:24,350
No, it's...

2283
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:26,290
Best of one and a best of three.

2284
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,030
No.

2285
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,750
No, that doesn't make sense.

2286
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,350
What the fuck?

2287
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:32,890
Please.

2288
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:33,930
This is our IGL.

2289
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:35,750
You can't ban the IGL.

2290
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,730
The sub is the IGL.

2291
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:40,630
I don't know if that should be a thing.

2292
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:46,430
This is fun.

2293
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:49,230
Our sub even has the most ping.

2294
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,050
That's a lie.

2295
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:52,090
Nex has the most ping.

2296
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:52,890
But like...

2297
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,850
Our sub has the second most ping.

2298
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:58,970
He's already debuffed as hell.

2299
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:02,630
I'm just a tactical shooter.

2300
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,730
Ping matters.

2301
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,710
I'm gonna increase my oath.

2302
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:07,490
Increase your oath?

2303
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:08,330
What does that even mean?

2304
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:10,830
Wait, Blurr is asking you to swap positions with me.

2305
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:11,470
Should I say yes?

2306
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:12,630
Swap what?

2307
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,450
Like team position?

2308
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:15,710
Wait, what do you mean?

2309
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,430
Team A to Team B.

2310
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:17,870
Yeah, yeah.

2311
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,030
You wanna leave us like that?

2312
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:19,410
No.

2313
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,270
He wants to swap Team A to Team B.

2314
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,690
Wait, why?

2315
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:23,730
What does that even do?

2316
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:24,230
There's no...

2317
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:25,390
What does that even do?

2318
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:26,610
There's no reason for this.

2319
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:28,790
It's just some fucking mind game.

2320
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:29,450
You say no.

2321
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:31,910
No.

2322
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:34,470
Bro, I'm giving my girl some gifts right now.

2323
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,130
Oh, are you?

2324
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:38,030
Oh yeah, by the way guys.

2325
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:39,510
We have an oath here.

2326
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:41,290
So you can give her like...

2327
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:43,510
Like gifts to make her love you more.

2328
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:44,670
I assume.

2329
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:45,310
Fuck.

2330
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:46,370
Love me now.

2331
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,470
What did you give her?

2332
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:52,210
I'm giving her gifts.

2333
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:53,590
What did I give her?

2334
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,870
I don't even know what I gave her.

2335
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:57,470
Oh, I upgraded my oath level.

2336
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:59,170
I gave her...

2337
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:00,110
Soon we can have sex.

2338
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:04,730
Wait, you haven't even held her hand yet.

2339
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,050
The force of gravity.

2340
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:07,290
Oath level 2.

2341
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:10,990
You haven't even held her hand yet.

2342
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:13,430
I'm about to goon.

2343
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:16,990
The top one of the archer level, bro.

2344
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:19,930
I haven't played that in like 3 months.

2345
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,990
Wait, next can put her on.

2346
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:27,930
We need to increase our affinity.

2347
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:33,550
Wait, we have to move to team B for...

2348
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:34,850
What's it called?

2349
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,230
Defense?

2350
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,670
Yeah, for defense.

2351
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:41,010
We have intertwined thoughts.

2352
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:42,690
Oh shit.

2353
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,030
Oh my god.

2354
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,370
Oh my god.

2355
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,770
I gave her a fucking death note?

2356
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:48,390
What the fuck?

2357
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,370
Why is Surefour like this?

2358
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,470
He's for the people.

2359
01:34:54,330 --> 01:34:55,610
I'm the people's champ.

2360
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:56,990
He's the people's champ.

2361
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:58,990
Wait, I don't have gifts yet for her.

2362
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:00,210
Yeah.

2363
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:02,270
Wait, how do you have gifts for her?

2364
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,030
Wouldn't you like to fucking know?

2365
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,490
What did you... Did you spend money?

2366
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,010
Hell fucking no.

2367
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:08,170
How do you have...

2368
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,810
I got this shit for free.

2369
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:11,630
She's giving me a gift!

2370
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,490
I wanna... I wanna... I wanna love her.

2371
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:16,730
Stickers!

2372
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,850
I wanna love her too!

2373
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:24,550
Wait.

2374
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:26,130
Check inventory?

2375
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:28,590
But I have no gifts in my inventory.

2376
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:29,790
Noob.

2377
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:31,070
Down.

2378
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:33,610
Okay, we need...

2379
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,190
Next, you gotta swap with Wanted.

2380
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:36,990
Wait, what?

2381
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:37,670
You have to swap.

2382
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:38,270
We're defending.

2383
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:39,810
Wait, we're defending!

2384
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:41,430
That means Surefour's gonna play Sniper on...

2385
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:42,010
Oh, it's over.

2386
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:43,550
This is literally...

2387
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,610
I'm gonna play Sniper on both.

2388
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:45,650
That's... You're right.

2389
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:46,710
Yeah, but now you get to play Sniper on both.

2390
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,170
I'm gonna play Sniper on defense too.

2391
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:49,410
Defense.

2392
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:50,330
Defense.

2393
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:51,450
Alright.

2394
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:51,810
Defense.

2395
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:53,010
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2396
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:54,130
I don't know how long it's gonna take.

2397
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:54,790
I'll be right back.

2398
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:55,610
Oh?

2399
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,260
What's that sound?

2400
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,240
I'm back.

2401
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:42,900
What do you mean?

2402
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,140
I heard someone... sounds.

2403
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:46,340
Maybe you're...

2404
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,520
Is it your... your girl?

2405
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,020
Oh, dude, I wish.

2406
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,680
And you wanted to get rid of her.

2407
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,040
You wanted to change her.

2408
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:57,020
I do still wanna change her.

2409
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,340
I thought you loved her!

2410
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,560
I'm a player.

2411
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:05,180
I got multiple 2D bitches on my roster, if you know what I mean.

2412
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:05,620
Yeah?

2413
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:06,940
Where's the proof?

2414
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,940
Who would I choose?

2415
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,360
Yeah, out of all of these girls.

2416
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,120
I would choose Ming.

2417
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,240
Ming?

2418
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,660
Wait, what does Ming look like?

2419
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:18,340
Oh!

2420
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,540
Yeah, I can see you choose her.

2421
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:23,300
I...

2422
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:23,840
Yeah.

2423
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:24,780
Yeah.

2424
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:25,960
Yeah.

2425
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:28,640
Inventory.

2426
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,180
Where's my inventory, chat?

2427
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,840
Oh, there it is!

2428
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,660
Good googly moogly, that Angus juice.

2429
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,800
Is it the gift box?

2430
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:41,440
Hmm.

2431
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:46,260
Is the gift that I give her from the gift box?

2432
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,480
I wonder.

2433
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,840
How was I supposed to know?

2434
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,160
Gifts in the gift box?

2435
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,680
Sorry, I'm gifting her stuff now.

2436
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:58,660
Oh my god.

2437
01:37:58,840 --> 01:37:58,980
Wait.

2438
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,080
Oh, I need one more gift and then she'll love me more.

2439
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,640
Bro, you had ten of them.

2440
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:07,160
Yeah, but like, I had to, you know, I don't want to use all of them.

2441
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,460
You can't just shower her with gifts right away.

2442
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,640
You gotta, you know, pace yourself.

2443
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,560
Yeah, you can.

2444
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:14,620
It's called love bombing.

2445
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:17,280
Thank you for...

2446
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,180
I'm betting you ignored him.

2447
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:21,180
And then it makes them want you more.

2448
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:21,540
Hello?

2449
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:22,160
Exactly.

2450
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:28,680
And how do you guys know so much about me?

2451
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,060
Oh, don't worry about it.

2452
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:34,380
Wait.

2453
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:36,560
Wait, I see the dark note.

2454
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:37,940
Wait, I see the death note.

2455
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,740
Yeah, why are we giving them a fucking death note though?

2456
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,560
I don't know, maybe a notebook design in a collaboration with a fan.

2457
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,640
Wait, it isn't.

2458
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:48,400
Wait.

2459
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,200
Even the font.

2460
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:51,840
Wait, whoa.

2461
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:52,140
No, no, no.

2462
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,340
Dude, look at her fucking mouse.

2463
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:55,500
What is that thing?

2464
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,980
That shit looks like a hovercraft.

2465
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:01,780
What mouse?

2466
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,500
There's like a part where she's like sitting at her computer and you can see her mouth.

2467
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,600
Wait, really?

2468
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,820
Yeah, I think you just have to be careful.

2469
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:10,800
Oh, yeah, what the fuck is...

2470
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,260
That looks like...

2471
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,280
No, that looks like a VR chat.

2472
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:13,380
The VR chat.

2473
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:13,980
Not VR chat.

2474
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,520
The VR controller.

2475
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,200
Bro, that thing looks like a hoverboard.

2476
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,880
I'm poking her head.

2477
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:20,560
Bam!

2478
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,520
Wait, no.

2479
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,840
Do I have to double tap?

2480
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:29,320
Wait, I think because I'm a higher oath, I get more affectionate.

2481
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:31,440
Is she more affectionate to you now?

2482
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,400
Yeah.

2483
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:33,580
What is she doing?

2484
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:33,980
Oh!

2485
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,640
Dude, she put her hair behind her ears for me.

2486
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,460
Oh my god.

2487
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,480
Okay, she doesn't like me.

2488
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,020
I poked her.

2489
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,540
When I poke her, she puts her hair behind her ears.

2490
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,320
That's how you know.

2491
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:48,920
Don't worry.

2492
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:50,260
That's going to be me soon.

2493
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,380
You wish.

2494
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,120
Oh yeah, I'm level 3 now.

2495
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,160
Yeah, well, I'm putting food in the microwave.

2496
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,820
When do we start the game?

2497
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:02,420
Wait.

2498
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:03,820
Wait.

2499
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,620
When are we supposed to start?

2500
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,660
Guys, this is high level FPS gameplay.

2501
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:17,820
Don't you, like, when you want to take a break, you want to love your waifu a little longer?

2502
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,640
See, even my doggo is into that too.

2503
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,140
Wait.

2504
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,660
Please ignore what I just said.

2505
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,560
I blame Surefour.

2506
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,860
This is all his fault.

2507
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,400
This is all his fault.

2508
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:51,360
I would never...

2509
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,060
This is all his fault.

2510
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:58,440
If they started the game while I was gone, it wouldn't have mattered.

2511
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,440
We got a shark that smells blood in the water.

2512
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,060
He's ego pushing the shit out of them.

2513
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,820
Who could that be?

2514
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:08,820
What are we waiting for right now?

2515
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:09,640
Like, are they...

2516
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,440
We're waiting for these.

2517
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:12,820
These one?

2518
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:13,660
Yeah, these what?

2519
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:15,480
Oh shit.

2520
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,300
I'm gonna...

2521
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:20,800
I'm gonna look at the mainstream, guys.

2522
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,400
The mainstream.

2523
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:24,540
Okay.

2524
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,720
I'm using all my XP.

2525
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:31,860
Use.

2526
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,760
8 XP cards.

2527
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:34,500
Confirmed.

2528
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,620
Why are you using it now?

2529
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,020
You're supposed to use it before we go in game.

2530
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,190
I don't think...

2531
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:45,610
You don't get XP from customs, right?

2532
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,850
I thought it just gave flat XP.

2533
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,010
Oh.

2534
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:51,350
Does it?

2535
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:54,530
Yeah, I'm level 59 now.

2536
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:55,550
Oh shit!

2537
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:57,130
Wait, where did I use that?

2538
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:58,530
What the fu...

2539
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,130
Wait, I wanna...

2540
01:41:59,130 --> 01:41:59,890
I'm gonna use it too.

2541
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:00,750
It's our free stuff.

2542
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,450
It's in our store...

2543
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:03,930
Inventory...

2544
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:04,350
And then...

2545
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:05,530
Uh...

2546
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:06,290
EXP card.

2547
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:07,610
Oh, it's a 5k!

2548
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,490
I'm using it too.

2549
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,590
I don't even know what I got.

2550
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:13,170
What this purple orb stuff is.

2551
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:13,630
It's currency.

2552
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:16,990
Wait, I have another gacha pawn.

2553
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:19,850
What do I have?

2554
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,010
What level am I now?

2555
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:22,650
I'm level 60.

2556
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:23,870
I'm still 28.

2557
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:24,790
10.

2558
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,230
No, you have to go to...

2559
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:26,610
Career.

2560
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,190
Go to career and go to inventory.

2561
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:29,430
And then go...

2562
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:30,370
Click your XP card.

2563
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,670
Yeah, I used it and I'm still...

2564
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,210
Wait, how am I still...

2565
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:34,230
Sperm?

2566
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:34,510
What?

2567
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,050
Sperm, give me a re...

2568
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:36,390
No!

2569
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:37,230
Game, game, game!

2570
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,870
No!

2571
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,970
You can't even see it!

2572
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:46,830
Yeah!

2573
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:52,770
I got fucking blue balls from my gacha pawn.

2574
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:01,160
Guys, I'm constantly hearing the gacha pawn opening sound now.

2575
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:02,400
That's not good.

2576
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,760
Wait, wait, we have a teammate that's AFK.

2577
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:05,620
We didn't know.

2578
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,740
Yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

2579
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,200
Oh yeah, it's gonna be fine.

2580
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:12,960
Yeah, they're back.

2581
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,500
He did nothing last game, so it's okay.

2582
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,560
Why is it always the bottom?

2583
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,200
Why is it always the bottom track?

2584
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:20,720
Yeah, why is it...

2585
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,020
Nine seconds, nine seconds!

2586
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,180
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2587
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:24,760
Oh my god, wait.

2588
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:25,500
I was...

2589
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:26,780
Go first, go first, go first.

2590
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:27,300
First?

2591
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:27,600
Okay.

2592
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:28,880
Okay.

2593
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:34,160
I hear constant electric noises.

2594
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:37,960
It won't stop.

2595
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:39,880
Wait, is it my mic?

2596
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:44,420
I was opening the gacha pawn when I got taken to the game.

2597
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:45,200
Oh.

2598
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,500
I guess I'm just gonna be electrocuted.

2599
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,480
Wait, no, you hear that right now?

2600
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,340
Wait, right now?

2601
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,660
Okay, wait, that's not good.

2602
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,260
That's not good.

2603
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,520
Can we just reset?

2604
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,660
No, I can deal with it.

2605
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,240
Okay, okay.

2606
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,340
Sure, if we lose this, we play a third map.

2607
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:02,900
Do we?

2608
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:03,640
Yeah.

2609
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:04,880
Oh, wait, really?

2610
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,340
I thought...

2611
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:06,840
Oh, okay.

2612
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,060
They said it's two best of ones.

2613
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,200
It's just two best of ones.

2614
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,100
Oh, okay.

2615
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,000
You don't get a...

2616
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:11,220
Yeah.

2617
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,080
So what even happens if we lose?

2618
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,080
We just get less points.

2619
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:14,500
I think it's a point system.

2620
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2621
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:15,940
It's a point system.

2622
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2623
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,460
So we have...

2624
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:18,940
So, yeah.

2625
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:20,340
I'm watching A long.

2626
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:22,160
I'm watching mid.

2627
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,100
I'm watching mid as well.

2628
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:24,480
Oh, wait, wait.

2629
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,800
They're B long, man.

2630
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:26,640
3B, 3B.

2631
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,260
Yeah.

2632
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,580
Guys, I'm getting electrocuted.

2633
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,560
Oh, careful, Mac.

2634
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:33,120
Careful.

2635
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:34,460
I'm okay.

2636
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,080
I'm just...

2637
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,080
I'm just getting ice down.

2638
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:36,600
I'm barren.

2639
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:37,260
I'm drowning.

2640
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,080
Wait, on the right, on the right.

2641
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:38,500
They're going mid.

2642
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:40,660
I'm rotating.

2643
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:41,460
I'm rotating.

2644
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:42,360
It's three top mid.

2645
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:43,640
I can't help you there.

2646
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:47,240
I got a turret right there, though.

2647
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:48,620
They're still mid.

2648
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:49,500
Yep.

2649
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,240
They're coming back B.

2650
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,080
There's people here.

2651
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:52,660
There's people here.

2652
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,600
I think I scared them.

2653
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:54,820
There's two.

2654
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:55,220
Yeah.

2655
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,740
I'm like a huge fucking plank.

2656
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,840
One is still bottom B.

2657
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,840
Oh, two top B.

2658
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:02,760
Let me know when they're out.

2659
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:03,480
I'm invising.

2660
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:04,640
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2661
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,520
Oh, they're going to kill me.

2662
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:07,460
Oh, they're going to kill me.

2663
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:07,980
Oh, I've been spotted.

2664
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,540
They're going to come hull.

2665
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:10,400
They're going to come hull probably.

2666
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:10,760
I killed one.

2667
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:11,800
Bomb down B.

2668
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:12,240
Bomb down B.

2669
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,280
Hull, hull, hull, hull, hull.

2670
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:14,720
There's a guy right here.

2671
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:15,240
I can't.

2672
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:15,920
I got one tapped.

2673
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,180
There's two in the hallway.

2674
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2675
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:19,660
I can't.

2676
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,680
He's low HP on my knock.

2677
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,200
It's a sniper.

2678
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:25,700
He's right here.

2679
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:26,140
He's right here.

2680
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,320
Yeah, I'm holding top side.

2681
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,160
Fucking bad on that, bro.

2682
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:30,640
Shut up.

2683
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:32,320
Huh?

2684
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,480
They can't minimize my window.

2685
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,820
Bomb's down up top.

2686
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,200
They're low.

2687
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:39,860
They're low as fuck.

2688
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:40,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2689
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:40,700
They're low.

2690
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:41,060
They're low.

2691
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,680
Yeah, but...

2692
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:44,080
Surefour's going in.

2693
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,080
Oh, we're getting so active.

2694
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,520
Surefour's getting so active.

2695
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:48,100
I got bomb.

2696
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:48,460
I got bomb.

2697
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:48,880
I got bomb.

2698
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,020
I can't see.

2699
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,820
He's in the smoke, reloading.

2700
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:51,920
There's one left.

2701
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:52,680
He might rez.

2702
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,840
No bullets.

2703
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:56,900
Nice!

2704
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:57,560
Oh, yeah!

2705
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,180
Let's go!

2706
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,120
Bro, I was in the smoke.

2707
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,480
I was in the smoke.

2708
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:03,440
Why?

2709
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:05,580
Wait, wait, wait.

2710
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:07,140
He gets top frag for one round.

2711
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:08,600
He gets top frag.

2712
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,480
Alright, alright.

2713
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,240
Next are other guys on support now.

2714
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,520
We put him on support.

2715
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:14,960
You better be on top frag.

2716
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,200
All I'm going to say...

2717
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:18,300
All I'm going to say is...

2718
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,400
The sniper's pushing.

2719
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,900
Not the guy that's pushing.

2720
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:21,960
That's all I'm saying.

2721
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:22,520
That's...

2722
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,240
Yeah, I agree.

2723
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:23,840
I agree.

2724
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:25,040
The sniper's really active.

2725
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,040
We literally have defense for our sniper.

2726
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,160
That's all I'm saying.

2727
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:32,820
And he should not be pushing.

2728
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:33,400
Whoa.

2729
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:39,860
Alright.

2730
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:41,540
We wait.

2731
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,580
I'm still being electrocuted.

2732
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,000
There's two B now.

2733
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:44,520
Three B.

2734
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:45,620
Four B.

2735
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:45,980
Four B.

2736
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:46,880
Four B.

2737
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:48,500
Bro, are they never going A?

2738
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,240
Where's my fun?

2739
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,160
Then come.

2740
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:50,840
We rotate.

2741
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,280
Rotating.

2742
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,140
Oh, they naded mid.

2743
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:56,660
Top of mid one.

2744
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,120
I'm watching.

2745
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:58,920
Ow.

2746
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,840
There's some bottom B.

2747
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:02,980
Did they un-rotate?

2748
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:03,900
No, they're still...

2749
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:04,140
They're mid.

2750
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:04,520
They're mid.

2751
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,760
I don't know if they're going to...

2752
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,360
They're still mid.

2753
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:08,900
Alright, going back A.

2754
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,960
They're rotating to A.

2755
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:10,400
They're rotating to A.

2756
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,180
Let's kill the big girl.

2757
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:12,580
Follow me.

2758
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:12,860
Follow me.

2759
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:13,600
Under, under.

2760
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:14,300
There.

2761
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,840
Last one right there.

2762
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:16,460
Mid, mid, mid.

2763
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:16,940
We have bomb.

2764
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,320
We have bomb.

2765
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:17,680
We have bomb.

2766
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:18,880
Don't fight them, Doki.

2767
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:19,980
Oh, no.

2768
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,860
Oh, I didn't realize they're all there.

2769
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:23,260
One's on their spawn.

2770
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:23,660
On their spawn.

2771
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,420
On their spawn?

2772
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:25,080
Oh, okay.

2773
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:25,840
On bomb.

2774
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:26,060
On bomb.

2775
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:27,000
Oh, I'm on my way.

2776
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:27,980
He's right there.

2777
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,380
He shot me through the smoke.

2778
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,220
One's damaged.

2779
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:32,980
One B, three.

2780
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:33,680
Oh, no.

2781
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:34,520
What the fuck?

2782
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:35,120
That missed.

2783
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:35,820
I'm a loser.

2784
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,520
One B, two.

2785
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:40,700
One B, two.

2786
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,020
Do I have to win this?

2787
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:44,340
Yes, you got this.

2788
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:46,500
If you win this, if you...

2789
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,060
Oh, okay.

2790
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:49,000
I don't think so.

2791
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,880
Yeah, I didn't finish the sentence because I could tell.

2792
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,260
I should have just gone for a body shot.

2793
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:56,740
Oh, wait.

2794
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:58,100
I know why I lost that.

2795
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:58,880
I don't have armor.

2796
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,260
Yeah, same.

2797
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,320
Alright.

2798
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,600
You can only buy armor in like, dead rounds, right?

2799
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,080
I don't know.

2800
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,840
Nah, I was two credits short of armor that round.

2801
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,900
Now I'm three credits short.

2802
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,260
You can sell.

2803
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:10,680
You can sell.

2804
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:14,280
If the undo button is green, you get a full refund.

2805
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,940
Next, you're not top frag anymore, Next.

2806
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,100
You're not top frag.

2807
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,660
They're going B because they know Surefour's on A.

2808
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,020
Yeah.

2809
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,860
I don't think that's the reason.

2810
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,100
Something like that.

2811
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,880
No, I'd be scared of them too.

2812
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:34,020
I mean, you literally denied them for last game.

2813
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:36,820
Yeah, it's like a lot of longing for denial.

2814
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:37,980
They're going B again.

2815
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:38,820
They're going B again.

2816
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:41,960
Next round, if they win, Surefour, you should go B heaven.

2817
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:42,980
Alright.

2818
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:46,480
There's multiple going upper B.

2819
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,460
One bottom B.

2820
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:48,640
I'm leaving A.

2821
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,760
Trying to nade them.

2822
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,360
One's going to the paper spot B.

2823
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,820
There's people in mid too.

2824
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,060
They're on next round.

2825
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:00,100
There's two mid.

2826
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:00,500
Yeah, yeah.

2827
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:02,040
Wait, we can fight this A.

2828
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,240
They might push A.

2829
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:03,960
One's hallway, yeah.

2830
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:04,700
He's in the box.

2831
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:05,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2832
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:06,720
He's low.

2833
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:07,860
They're pushing.

2834
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:08,940
Surefour, they're pushing Surefour.

2835
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:11,580
I'm scared.

2836
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,360
I'm trying to head over to you.

2837
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:15,060
I'm going to heal you.

2838
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:16,720
I tried to.

2839
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:17,300
I gave you armor.

2840
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:19,700
Nice shot.

2841
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:20,720
There's people here.

2842
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,180
I see them.

2843
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,540
I got double peeked.

2844
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,540
They're probably going to rez.

2845
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:28,700
I'm rez-able probably.

2846
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:29,460
I'm going to rez.

2847
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,180
I smoked.

2848
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:30,760
I win.

2849
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:31,060
I win.

2850
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:31,280
I win.

2851
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,900
So they can't push that.

2852
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:35,220
I'm hurting though.

2853
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,780
Oh, they're thirsty.

2854
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:38,520
Yeah.

2855
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,500
They're planting.

2856
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:41,920
They're planting.

2857
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:43,580
They're planting right now.

2858
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:44,120
Yeah, they are.

2859
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,780
I'm going to try to take...

2860
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:49,880
I'm taking high ground here.

2861
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:50,980
Yep, can you hold for me?

2862
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,860
Yeah, I'm trying to hold.

2863
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,140
I'm here.

2864
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:53,340
I'm here.

2865
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:57,760
I cracked one of them.

2866
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,280
We have to push soon.

2867
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,180
We have to push soon.

2868
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:01,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2869
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,120
Oh, I got sniped.

2870
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,060
I got sniped while falling down.

2871
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,260
There's snipers under you guys.

2872
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,040
There's two under you, two under you.

2873
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,800
Oh, you have to defuse.

2874
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,800
Yeah, or else...

2875
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:14,680
Yeah.

2876
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:16,200
One, one, one HP.

2877
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,340
I don't think you have time.

2878
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,380
I'm going to suck, I'm going to suck, I'm going to suck.

2879
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,380
He's out, he's out, he's out.

2880
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,600
Defuse, defuse, defuse, defuse.

2881
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Alright, did we get it?

2882
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:26,800
Wait, why isn't it defusing?

2883
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,660
I was holding F like seven times.

2884
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:32,740
Goodbye.

2885
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,680
Wait, no, no, no, it's fine.

2886
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,960
It's a pity run, it's a pity run.

2887
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,200
Dude, it broke.

2888
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:44,180
I was holding F and the bomb just destroyed that thing.

2889
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:45,080
No, no, no, no.

2890
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,500
It thought you were ruzzing someone, that's why.

2891
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:50,160
Because their teammate was near the bomb.

2892
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,180
So he griefed me.

2893
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:59,720
I think you should pull back if their whole team is on you.

2894
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:00,760
I'm just going to B.

2895
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:02,820
Yeah, I'll go A then.

2896
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:03,820
Someone has to go A.

2897
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:04,620
Yeah, I'll go A.

2898
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,040
Yeah, sure, you should.

2899
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,720
I'm just putting this turret in.

2900
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:11,260
I'll go A.

2901
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:17,850
I'm with you.

2902
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:20,050
They're B, they're B.

2903
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:21,210
Three B, three B.

2904
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,490
I'll stay in mid, I'll stay in mid just in case.

2905
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:27,910
They always push this shit mega hard though, so be careful.

2906
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:29,370
I see them, one in mid.

2907
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:30,110
I see one in mid.

2908
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:30,470
That's two mid.

2909
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:31,450
Two mid.

2910
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:32,990
They're all towards B right now.

2911
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:35,290
They scanned me, they scanned me.

2912
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:40,030
Oh, they might all push you, you guys should back up.

2913
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:42,250
Yeah, I know, I'm backing up right now.

2914
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:45,510
Mid,

2915
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:49,410
mid.

2916
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:50,550
They're going to come in.

2917
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:51,570
Oh, no, they're right, they're going to B.

2918
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:53,870
They're coming to you, they're coming to you, they're coming to you, Matt, they're coming to you.

2919
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:54,450
They're coming to you.

2920
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:57,730
Wait, they're all there.

2921
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:58,670
He's cracked, he's cracked, he's cracked.

2922
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:01,990
One's on site, one's on site.

2923
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:05,250
One's on site, I can't get him.

2924
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,990
They smoked me, they smoked me, so I can't do anything.

2925
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,550
I'm heading over, I'm pushing through the smoke.

2926
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:10,710
I got, I killed the guy B.

2927
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:12,570
One B site.

2928
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:14,230
I'm backing up.

2929
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:16,010
I'm going heaven, going heaven, going heaven, going heaven.

2930
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:18,310
This guy, this guy, this guy right in front of us, there's literally a guy right in front of us here.

2931
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:21,190
What the, oh, the sniper pushed me.

2932
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:22,890
Yeah, wait, he got someone, dude.

2933
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:24,950
I'm resable.

2934
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:25,910
I'm pushing up.

2935
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:27,790
I got one, I got one, I got one.

2936
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:28,490
I'm playing for res.

2937
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:29,410
It's just one left.

2938
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:30,070
Last guy, last guy.

2939
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:31,510
Their armor's broken.

2940
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:33,230
Their armor's broken unless they got healed.

2941
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:34,390
They're high ground.

2942
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:35,270
They're probably regen.

2943
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:36,310
Dead.

2944
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:37,210
Nice.

2945
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:38,870
Yay!

2946
01:52:40,730 --> 01:52:41,010
Alright.

2947
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,330
I think we don't have a lot of, like, prize.

2948
01:52:46,330 --> 01:52:49,390
Oh, by the way, are you guys buying, um, light regen armor?

2949
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:50,930
No, I buy heavy.

2950
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:51,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2951
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:52,250
Oh, I buy, oh.

2952
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:53,650
Yeah, I buy light, I buy light.

2953
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:54,130
I buy light.

2954
01:52:54,770 --> 01:52:55,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2955
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:55,690
Light regen.

2956
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,150
Oh, I do not have enough money now.

2957
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:58,070
I don't, I don't have armor.

2958
01:52:58,130 --> 01:52:59,730
No, wait, no, you have no armor now.

2959
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:00,890
I have no armor, guys.

2960
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:05,790
I, I, I blame our IGL for griefing me there.

2961
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:10,250
I listened too well.

2962
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:13,850
No, the fine print, I didn't say, I didn't say to sell.

2963
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,240
I'm on A.

2964
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:23,540
You're B?

2965
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:25,840
Yeah, I'll stay A, I'll stay A.

2966
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,660
I'm staying A to look at mid.

2967
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,920
Uh, A, we can get a little more active.

2968
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,400
We can, we can sit on the wall here.

2969
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,820
We can sit on the wall here.

2970
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,940
If they push up, we can try to jump one guy.

2971
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:35,960
We can just like solo someone.

2972
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:36,800
There's one, two, three.

2973
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:37,360
Careful next.

2974
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:38,160
Oh, there's two up there.

2975
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:38,760
There's two up there.

2976
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:39,460
Yeah, there's two, there's two.

2977
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,320
We're gonna have, we're gonna have Surefour hold it.

2978
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:42,440
Are you gonna hold our angle?

2979
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:42,760
Yeah?

2980
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,700
Uh, I need to get back up.

2981
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah, there's three.

2982
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:46,360
There's four.

2983
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:48,020
Next one, next is gonna flank soon.

2984
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:48,600
Next is gonna flank.

2985
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,900
Oh, wait, no, they're never close.

2986
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:51,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're hard pushing.

2987
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:51,840
They're hard pushing now.

2988
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,320
I hit one for 156.

2989
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,720
Above you, 156.

2990
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:56,000
Dead.

2991
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:56,460
He's down.

2992
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:57,680
Another one, 152.

2993
01:53:58,060 --> 01:53:58,380
Another one.

2994
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:58,780
Push him, push him, push him.

2995
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,060
I got him, I got him, I got him.

2996
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:02,520
Nice.

2997
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:05,020
Headshot sniper up top.

2998
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,400
Thirsted.

2999
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:08,360
There's just one.

3000
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:08,860
One left.

3001
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:09,300
I threw a nade.

3002
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:10,240
You can push that.

3003
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:11,100
On me.

3004
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,760
I threw a wind nade.

3005
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:14,280
I hit one 58, 58.

3006
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:15,580
Nice.

3007
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:16,920
I'm flying.

3008
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:18,380
I have it.

3009
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:19,580
I have the turret.

3010
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,140
Okay, now I can buy the regen.

3011
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,760
Alright, I'm just gonna put my turrets and I'll go.

3012
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,340
I'm going A this time.

3013
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:32,040
Wait, really?

3014
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:32,560
Under their heads.

3015
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:33,260
Oh, okay.

3016
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,700
I'll stay, I'll still stay in A then.

3017
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:44,280
We can do the same thing, last round.

3018
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:48,880
And if they don't come B, we can just flank them.

3019
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:54,600
I'm waiting until...

3020
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:54,880
Okay.

3021
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:01,140
I think we're doing the same thing.

3022
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:01,240
Yeah, we're doing the same thing.

3023
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:03,720
God fuck damn it.

3024
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,840
I told you.

3025
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:05,860
I told you.

3026
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:06,600
They might come in.

3027
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:07,080
They might come in.

3028
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:09,400
There's one in mid.

3029
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,140
There's one in mid.

3030
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:10,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3031
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,240
I saw them.

3032
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,560
I saw them too.

3033
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,040
There's two mid.

3034
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:13,440
There's two mid.

3035
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:13,840
There's two mid.

3036
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:14,300
They're coming over.

3037
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,520
No, they're all here.

3038
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:16,220
They're all here.

3039
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:16,540
They're all here.

3040
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:16,720
They're all here.

3041
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:17,640
Okay, okay, okay.

3042
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:18,060
They rotated.

3043
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:18,520
They rotated.

3044
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,240
One on top of mid.

3045
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,400
I'm going from back here.

3046
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:27,640
I don't feel safe.

3047
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,980
Oh, they're coming in.

3048
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:30,420
They're coming in.

3049
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,060
I'm coming in.

3050
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:32,160
159.

3051
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,320
I'm heading over, I'm heading over.

3052
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,440
There's a headshot sniper up top.

3053
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:39,220
They're pushing me on point.

3054
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,600
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

3055
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,640
One's broken armor again.

3056
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,660
I got one, I got one, I got one.

3057
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,800
I'm throwing a turret, I'm throwing a turret.

3058
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:46,740
Turret's out, turret's out.

3059
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:50,460
So like, it should help.

3060
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:52,700
I'm wind grenading.

3061
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:55,580
It's okay, they can't plant.

3062
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:56,220
I have a turret.

3063
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:58,120
Nice.

3064
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,040
Yeah, the turret's nearly in there.

3065
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:01,220
Dude.

3066
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,800
Alright, I think you should stay in B.

3067
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:08,380
Maybe you should stay in B.

3068
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,280
But surely they go A this time.

3069
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,020
We'll see, we'll see.

3070
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:22,780
Let me put my little turret.

3071
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,860
My little turret baby right here.

3072
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,320
And then my other baby right here.

3073
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:36,180
Okay.

3074
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:40,520
I don't see anything top B.

3075
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:42,700
I'm with next right now.

3076
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:45,580
I think they're looking to rotate mid maybe.

3077
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,720
I'm looking at mid right now for us.

3078
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:50,560
Yep.

3079
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,060
I'm C.

3080
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,080
They're always rotating.

3081
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:54,140
They're on top of A again.

3082
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:54,480
Yeah.

3083
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:55,800
Oh!

3084
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,280
They're looking at mid.

3085
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:57,880
They're looking at mid.

3086
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,160
My location's revealed.

3087
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,820
Yeah, I don't know.

3088
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,080
I'm mini rotating.

3089
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:04,880
We don't know where they are, so it's kind of scary.

3090
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,300
Mid, mid, mid.

3091
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,200
How am I still the real?

3092
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,080
One's top mid.

3093
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:07,620
One's top mid.

3094
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,960
We can try to beam her.

3095
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:09,680
Oh, no, nevermind.

3096
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,920
Wait, they might come back.

3097
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,020
One's on that wall right here.

3098
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:14,980
Yeah, they're still looking.

3099
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:17,660
They went back to B.

3100
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:18,480
They're pushing you guys.

3101
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:19,220
Yeah, they went back.

3102
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:20,780
Oh wait, they're going back.

3103
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:21,300
Run, run, run.

3104
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:23,940
I got one.

3105
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:24,820
Nice.

3106
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,320
Do they know you're there?

3107
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:29,080
They're going back.

3108
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:29,800
They're hard pushing you.

3109
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,700
They're hard pushing you.

3110
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:33,600
They're hard pushing you.

3111
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:33,900
Careful.

3112
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:35,040
Nice ult.

3113
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:37,760
I'm pushing.

3114
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:38,320
Fuck it.

3115
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:40,340
Okay, that's toxic.

3116
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,640
Just get active.

3117
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:45,260
I did something very toxic.

3118
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,420
You're free.

3119
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,180
Last round before the half.

3120
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:55,460
Wait, should I get ADS speed or spread control?

3121
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:56,500
What's the best?

3122
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,160
Spread control.

3123
01:57:58,260 --> 01:57:59,880
I always get ADS speed.

3124
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:02,680
You're not going to listen to your IGL?

3125
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:03,440
No, no, no.

3126
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:05,480
Snipers should get ADS speed.

3127
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:07,680
Wait, I was muted that whole fucking time.

3128
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,660
How long was it?

3129
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,180
The entire time.

3130
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:13,640
He thought you were just a silent warrior.

3131
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:15,840
Yeah, I thought you were just a turtle locked in.

3132
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:19,600
I can armor one of you with the heal drug.

3133
01:58:24,690 --> 01:58:25,730
What were you even saying?

3134
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:27,750
What were you even saying?

3135
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:29,750
I was like saying everything I was doing.

3136
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:32,310
I've been comming with my bear where people are at.

3137
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:34,090
I'm like droning B.

3138
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:35,110
There's four B's right now.

3139
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:35,810
Yeah, we heard nothing.

3140
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:39,570
You were just vibing.

3141
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,670
Okay, we're smoked off right now.

3142
01:58:42,810 --> 01:58:43,450
I droned you.

3143
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,710
I wonder if I can get this.

3144
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:46,670
Still droning it.

3145
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:47,250
They're going mid.

3146
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:48,890
Oh, I hit 64.

3147
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:49,710
I frantically hit them.

3148
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:51,070
Don't show yet.

3149
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:54,810
Once they come mid, we can crunch them.

3150
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:56,370
Oh, there go mid.

3151
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:57,450
I saw one flying mid.

3152
01:58:57,650 --> 01:58:58,470
Just wait, just wait, just wait.

3153
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:00,750
Oh, they don't know.

3154
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:02,650
Two flying mid, two flying mid.

3155
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:04,050
Two flying mid?

3156
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:04,750
Okay, wait.

3157
01:59:04,950 --> 01:59:07,350
There should only be like three mid.

3158
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:08,250
Three flying mid.

3159
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:09,650
Yeah, there should only be three mid.

3160
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:11,610
Doki doki, help.

3161
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:13,290
How?

3162
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:14,230
Rotating.

3163
01:59:14,610 --> 01:59:14,830
How?

3164
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:16,010
Okay, it's time to go.

3165
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:17,970
I was.

3166
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,150
I don't know where he got from there.

3167
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:22,790
Yep, yep.

3168
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:24,010
One, two, three, two, one.

3169
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:25,330
There's three mid.

3170
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:26,930
I'm like, how?

3171
01:59:27,710 --> 01:59:28,690
One down, one down.

3172
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:29,830
Got the other one?

3173
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:33,670
I don't even have to do anything.

3174
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:36,590
I'm just here first.

3175
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:40,050
Yeah, he's the insurance policy.

3176
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:41,850
I'll play Celeste now.

3177
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:44,590
You can play Ming if you want.

3178
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:46,350
I'm a French maid now.

3179
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:51,190
I have the legendary skin of Celeste.

3180
01:59:51,330 --> 01:59:52,450
Oh, that's true, that's true.

3181
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:56,250
I might go for like a Batling Night angle or something.

3182
01:59:57,650 --> 01:59:58,770
It's a pretty long range map.

3183
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:03,230
Alright, here we go.

3184
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:04,670
Now we're attacking.

3185
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:05,990
I don't know how to attack on this map.

3186
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,230
Um, Regi is very good.

3187
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:12,030
It's actually kind of a godsend that Abe started playing Regi.

3188
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:16,970
I was always like, oh, he seems pretty good.

3189
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:17,790
Did you build a wall?

3190
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:19,490
His wall is very strong.

3191
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:22,970
And once you get Awakening 3, we can see through the wall when we're close to it.

3192
02:00:23,070 --> 02:00:23,530
And they can't.

3193
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:26,010
Alright, IGL, where do we do?

3194
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:26,910
Which point?

3195
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:27,690
We're going A.

3196
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:29,030
Okay, nope.

3197
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:30,350
Yeah, I listen to Sherpa.

3198
02:00:30,450 --> 02:00:31,090
He's the real IGL.

3199
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:36,530
Now it's your turn to IGL.

3200
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:38,790
Wait, Sherpa, yeah, do you want to IGL?

3201
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:41,010
No, I'm a side IGL-er.

3202
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:44,910
I'm the commander that tells everyone where to go, and then the squad leads lead the squad.

3203
02:00:47,930 --> 02:00:50,890
Um, when you reach the wall, we can reach the wall like this.

3204
02:00:51,050 --> 02:00:52,110
Um, these two things.

3205
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:53,410
And then we can all take Bank.

3206
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:54,290
Okay.

3207
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:56,270
IQ.

3208
02:01:02,410 --> 02:01:02,890
Oh?

3209
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:04,410
I got scan for Sniper.

3210
02:01:05,390 --> 02:01:08,070
Um, yeah, just make space for the reach wall.

3211
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:09,250
I'm taking high ground.

3212
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:11,150
Where am I walling from?

3213
02:01:11,610 --> 02:01:11,890
Oh.

3214
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,610
Oh my god, goodbye.

3215
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,450
Yeah, no, he destroyed me.

3216
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,930
Um, from here...

3217
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:17,330
I killed one.

3218
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,170
Nice.

3219
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:20,810
I'm five health.

3220
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:21,730
I can't really walk up.

3221
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:23,410
I have a healing nade for you.

3222
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:24,250
I have a healing nade for you.

3223
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:25,150
Okay, I'm rezzing.

3224
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,790
I need somebody to back us up.

3225
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:28,050
I'm dead.

3226
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:29,710
Honestly, wait, wait.

3227
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:30,250
They're running at you.

3228
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:30,890
Oh, they're dead!

3229
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:31,890
Oh my god!

3230
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:32,450
I died!

3231
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:32,870
Oh!

3232
02:01:33,070 --> 02:01:33,350
Okay.

3233
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:35,950
Yeah, they hard pushed.

3234
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:37,930
Honestly, they won't.

3235
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:39,710
Since we died, they won't think we'll do it again.

3236
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:41,190
Okay.

3237
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:44,450
They're gonna do it again.

3238
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:46,030
Damn.

3239
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:46,490
Damn.

3240
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:49,470
We have three rounds to lose until it's time.

3241
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:50,270
God, no, no!

3242
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:51,350
Don't say that.

3243
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:52,430
Don't say that.

3244
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:53,970
We can't do that.

3245
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:56,550
Guys, guys, guys.

3246
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:57,770
Wait, next.

3247
02:01:57,930 --> 02:01:58,650
Where are you next?

3248
02:01:59,150 --> 02:01:59,550
I'm here.

3249
02:01:59,650 --> 02:01:59,790
Why?

3250
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:00,230
What's up?

3251
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:01,590
Oh.

3252
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:05,530
Wait, that's so disrespectful.

3253
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:06,650
What do you mean?

3254
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:07,830
He's a team planter!

3255
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:09,470
Oh, yeah.

3256
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:10,310
Okay, okay.

3257
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:12,290
Where is the sniper shooting from?

3258
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:12,590
Window?

3259
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:14,130
Um, on my ping.

3260
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:14,910
On my ping here.

3261
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:16,750
Oh, underside.

3262
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,730
No, no.

3263
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:18,650
He's on top.

3264
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:19,630
This is the top side.

3265
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:21,490
This is the top window.

3266
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:22,290
Oh, gotcha.

3267
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,830
You can also move to here.

3268
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:24,450
Yeah.

3269
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:25,990
I was looking at the top right.

3270
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:27,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3271
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:29,530
Does this game eat your guys' RAM usage?

3272
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:30,190
Is my game?

3273
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:31,350
It's literally peaking.

3274
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:32,530
It's literally peaking 99%.

3275
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,330
I'm alright.

3276
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:34,070
I have no idea.

3277
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:35,490
I have no idea either.

3278
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:36,510
I just feel like I'm okay.

3279
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:39,150
My whole computer is locking up.

3280
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:39,850
Oh, no.

3281
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:42,170
We can play a little slower, actually.

3282
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:43,430
We don't have to force the wall out.

3283
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:46,270
Yeah, because he's at the back side.

3284
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,910
Yeah, we have three, like, semi-auto weapons.

3285
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:50,730
So, we can just try to get a pick.

3286
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:51,990
I found a sniper if you want to push.

3287
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:53,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3288
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:54,510
Can we try to push up for the Rachel?

3289
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:55,530
Knock on site.

3290
02:02:55,570 --> 02:02:55,790
Knock on site.

3291
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:56,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3292
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:57,010
Push up for the Rachel.

3293
02:02:57,010 --> 02:02:57,210
One more site.

3294
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,790
One more top site.

3295
02:02:57,870 --> 02:02:58,150
Top site.

3296
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:00,150
They're probably going to rez.

3297
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:02,610
I'm pushing up.

3298
02:03:03,070 --> 02:03:03,250
Yep.

3299
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:05,070
One's top site.

3300
02:03:05,190 --> 02:03:05,650
I'm top of site.

3301
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:07,290
I knocked one.

3302
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:08,830
I think I almost cracked him.

3303
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:09,230
I cracked him.

3304
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:11,970
I think they're going to rez.

3305
02:03:12,030 --> 02:03:12,610
I think they're going to rez.

3306
02:03:12,610 --> 02:03:14,170
I don't have bomb.

3307
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:17,810
Next has bomb.

3308
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:22,030
Guys, I'll pop up.

3309
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:25,390
He's low.

3310
02:03:25,470 --> 02:03:25,730
He's low.

3311
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:27,550
Oh my god.

3312
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:27,910
Get him.

3313
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:30,430
I got one.

3314
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:31,410
There's another one on point.

3315
02:03:31,470 --> 02:03:32,550
There's one on top, yeah.

3316
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:33,330
Yeah.

3317
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:35,630
He's one.

3318
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:35,990
He's one.

3319
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:38,150
Got another one.

3320
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:41,070
It's 2v2.

3321
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:41,510
2v2.

3322
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:42,930
You can rez this, yeah.

3323
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:44,010
Just cover.

3324
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:44,490
Cover him.

3325
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:47,270
Back!

3326
02:03:48,230 --> 02:03:48,610
Nice.

3327
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:49,950
He's one.

3328
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:50,250
He's one.

3329
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:50,490
He's one.

3330
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:51,530
Nice!

3331
02:03:54,930 --> 02:03:55,330
Nice.

3332
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:57,890
Alright.

3333
02:03:58,950 --> 02:04:01,050
Honestly, I think we should... yeah, yeah, yeah.

3334
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:03,390
Let's just stop forcing the Rachel, I guess.

3335
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:06,010
I think we're just way better at just killing them.

3336
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:11,130
I think because Mac is playing at the very back side, so we have to wait for him to push up.

3337
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:14,470
They might have someone playing mid.

3338
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:17,010
So we can try to pick them off.

3339
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:18,510
Wanna play super slow?

3340
02:04:19,390 --> 02:04:20,490
Yeah, we can play super slow.

3341
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:23,030
Because we have three very long range weapons.

3342
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:25,250
Me, Abe, and Shur4.

3343
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:25,830
Okay.

3344
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:29,970
I'm trying to move around and stuff.

3345
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:30,750
Not gonna lie.

3346
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:31,910
It's still very hard.

3347
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:38,230
Yeah, when my ship fully locks up, it makes my inputs delay by 5 seconds.

3348
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:40,690
It's really annoying.

3349
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:42,770
You gotta lower your graphics?

3350
02:04:43,330 --> 02:04:46,010
Nah, it's my RAM.

3351
02:04:46,130 --> 02:04:46,910
My RAM is peaking.

3352
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,750
It's literally 100% usage.

3353
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:51,430
It looks like they're giving mid to us for free, so...

3354
02:04:52,270 --> 02:04:53,190
They rotated.

3355
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:55,310
Oh, I got destroyed.

3356
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:57,190
Wait, wait, wait.

3357
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:58,190
Can you... wait, wait.

3358
02:04:58,190 --> 02:04:58,530
Follow me.

3359
02:04:59,290 --> 02:05:01,550
I don't have any more heals left.

3360
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:06,430
Can you wall from where I'm standing to here?

3361
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:09,650
One is up top.

3362
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:10,750
Okay, okay, okay.

3363
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:14,110
And then we're gonna... let's go, let's go.

3364
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:16,390
Wait, their sniper fell off the map.

3365
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:17,870
We just crossed to the left side.

3366
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:20,730
How the fuck are they still alive?

3367
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:22,170
Oh, they killed themselves.

3368
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:23,990
They have no sniper A.

3369
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:26,690
We're going B.

3370
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:27,790
It's already too late.

3371
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:31,530
I got him.

3372
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:33,610
Dead.

3373
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:36,630
He's underneath.

3374
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,750
Yeah, I see, I see.

3375
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:43,760
Oh, there's two behind me, but they're both low down there.

3376
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,340
The people downstairs are low.

3377
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:48,040
There's one that was behind me.

3378
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,760
That's the last guy.

3379
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:51,880
Last guy, last guy.

3380
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:52,540
He's the last guy.

3381
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:54,780
Oh, fuck, he's right here.

3382
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,220
I bodied him, I bodied him.

3383
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:57,220
He's... no armor.

3384
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:59,000
Yeah, let's go!

3385
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:07,280
Dude, I saw you getting shot from behind, so I pushed up to try and help you and you kept shooting me in my ass.

3386
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,340
No, yeah, the guy that was shooting at me from behind.

3387
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,140
I killed him.

3388
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:14,720
I have all two.

3389
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:15,780
Bad comms, bad comms, my bad.

3390
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,940
I hit the 180, though.

3391
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:18,760
Yeah, you did.

3392
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,020
Yeah, that was pretty awesome.

3393
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:23,700
Holy shit.

3394
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:25,320
What, what are you laughing at?

3395
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:26,300
Look at Tav.

3396
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:32,100
Wait, I can make sure for bottom frag.

3397
02:06:34,940 --> 02:06:35,780
Do it up.

3398
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,340
Alright, I'm heading over.

3399
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:39,980
I'm just a little support.

3400
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,080
I'm support too!

3401
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:46,660
I'm just a little guy.

3402
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:48,940
A little guy living in a little world?

3403
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:49,500
Oh, bam.

3404
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,220
He's trying to...

3405
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:52,820
Should I break it?

3406
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:55,700
Oh, we can leave, yeah.

3407
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:56,960
Let's go, let's just go.

3408
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,200
Or mid, let's go mid, yeah.

3409
02:06:59,900 --> 02:07:00,620
I'm with Mac.

3410
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,080
Surefour is lurking right now.

3411
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:04,080
I'm lurking.

3412
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,220
Yeah, he's doing his thing.

3413
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:07,540
Yeah.

3414
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:13,220
Um, I think A is going to be open.

3415
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:14,600
No, flank, flank, flank, flank, flank.

3416
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:16,720
Nice, nice, nice.

3417
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:17,360
That was a good pick.

3418
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:19,500
Let's go A, let's go A, let's go A.

3419
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:20,660
A window, A window.

3420
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:21,240
Left side window.

3421
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:23,280
I painted it, I painted it.

3422
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:24,460
I hit him 70.

3423
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:26,600
Oh, just keep going A, just keep going A.

3424
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:27,140
Don't worry about the flank.

3425
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:27,700
I'm visible here.

3426
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:28,800
There's a flank right now.

3427
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,520
Wait, who has bomb, who has bomb?

3428
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:32,180
I have one on me.

3429
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:33,960
Wait, I have bomb.

3430
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:34,900
I have one for 105.

3431
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:37,060
I have bomb, I have bomb.

3432
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:37,400
I'm heading up.

3433
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,340
Oh, I'm getting shot, I'm getting shot.

3434
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:38,740
Oh, never mind.

3435
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:42,000
No, I had bomb, I couldn't tell.

3436
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:43,420
That's my bad.

3437
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:44,240
I'm going to rez, I'm going to rez.

3438
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:47,780
I can't hit this bitch with G paper.

3439
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:48,400
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

3440
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:49,640
No.

3441
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:51,220
Oh no, I'm sorry.

3442
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:52,980
He jumped out, he's on my body.

3443
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:58,200
Last guy, last guy.

3444
02:07:58,560 --> 02:07:58,880
2v1.

3445
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,560
He's directly under you, directly under you.

3446
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:00,900
Right side.

3447
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,880
Wait, I'm going to try to rez if I can make it.

3448
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:05,260
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

3449
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:08,440
I was like, who has bomb?

3450
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:09,820
And then Nek said, I have bomb.

3451
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:10,620
And I was like, really?

3452
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:15,060
I know I had it.

3453
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:16,560
2v1!

3454
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:18,100
Nice.

3455
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:20,480
Yay!

3456
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:22,600
We have a game right away, by the way.

3457
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:24,580
We have a...

3458
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:25,580
Oh, no great.

3459
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:28,400
Dude, I have so much damage, but no kills.

3460
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:31,100
Okay.

3461
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,380
It's fine, now I'm warmed up.

3462
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:34,560
Nice.

3463
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:35,240
Now, I'm warmed up.

3464
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:36,000
I'm motivated.

3465
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:38,900
Alright, now back to my girl.

3466
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:40,260
I'm getting my food, BRB.

3467
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:42,980
Alright, I'm going to open up my box.

3468
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:45,700
Oh my god, I got a fucking sculpture?

3469
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,760
Hello, my new wife.

3470
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:59,040
Oh my god, have you guys been giving gifts to her, too?

3471
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:01,920
Oh, no?

3472
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:02,360
Okay.

3473
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,120
I'm just by myself, I guess.

3474
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:08,800
I always give my baby gifts.

3475
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,460
I always give her gifts.

3476
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:12,640
Oh yeah, prove it.

3477
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:13,480
What's her oaf?

3478
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:14,700
Uh, two?

3479
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:18,540
Oh my god, didn't even give her one gift.

3480
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:19,600
Wow.

3481
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,460
That's fucked up.

3482
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:24,920
Wait, I'll give her a bunch of gifts right now, actually.

3483
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:26,480
You gotta pace it.

3484
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:27,820
Don't love bomb her!

3485
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,260
No, don't do that to her!

3486
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,980
Don't love bomb her!

3487
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:32,860
No, it's too late.

3488
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,640
No!

3489
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:38,020
I'm showering her with gifts.

3490
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:38,160
No!

3491
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:43,500
I just doubled her oaf level.

3492
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:44,620
She went from two to four.

3493
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,840
Oh my god, I'm still at three.

3494
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:48,340
I'm doing it one by one.

3495
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:51,980
I want her to appreciate every single gift I've given her.

3496
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,500
Are you telling me that she loves me more than you right now?

3497
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:59,720
No, I'm saying you're love bombing her and you're manipulating her.

3498
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,700
Oh, she wants a toy.

3499
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:04,960
Here you go.

3500
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:06,460
Have my toy.

3501
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:11,320
Yeah!

3502
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:13,020
Of course.

3503
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:15,440
She's level three now.

3504
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:20,320
When is our next game anyway?

3505
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:21,200
Is it like...

3506
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:21,780
I'm not sure.

3507
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:25,580
Automatically a question for Steph.

3508
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:26,560
Is there a B...

3509
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,540
Oh, there is a B stream.

3510
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,410
When is our next...

3511
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,700
Oh wait, caps lock.

3512
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:37,440
When is our next game?

3513
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,520
No, type it in caps.

3514
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:40,240
Okay, when is...

3515
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:41,200
You point...

3516
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,080
Type it in caps.

3517
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:43,640
I already said yes.

3518
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:46,020
Dude, I'm hanging out with my bitch right now.

3519
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:47,520
Don't...

3520
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:48,980
You call her your bitch?

3521
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:51,520
Yeah, we close like that.

3522
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,260
Oath level three and shit.

3523
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:53,740
It's whatever.

3524
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:54,800
Yeah, but...

3525
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,200
But Aqua's oath level is four.

3526
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:58,440
Yeah.

3527
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:02,000
Yeah, she loves him more than she loves you.

3528
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:03,540
She fucking doesn't.

3529
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:04,340
Then why is it three?

3530
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:05,940
Why is it three?

3531
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:07,380
It's her!

3532
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:09,680
Wait, wait, wait.

3533
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:11,740
Wait, wait, wait.

3534
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,240
Wait, wait, wait.

3535
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:16,500
Wait, wait, wait.

3536
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:21,380
She ain't loyal.

3537
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,260
What are you gonna say about that shirt, boy?

3538
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:24,280
She ain't loyal.

3539
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:25,420
I'm becoming gay.

3540
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:28,020
Hey, what's up, man?

3541
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:30,100
Hey, what's up, cutie?

3542
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,560
Oh my god.

3543
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:40,120
Okay, she's still at level three?

3544
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:43,260
How much does she want from me?

3545
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:47,760
I'm giving her so much.

3546
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:50,600
Thank you.

3547
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:52,960
Can you actually swap girls or not, Aqua?

3548
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:53,980
You know the most.

3549
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:55,240
Oh, oh yeah.

3550
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:56,960
In the CN client, you can.

3551
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:59,100
But in this version, it's only...

3552
02:11:59,100 --> 02:11:59,780
We're forced to...

3553
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:00,740
Dude, what the fuck?

3554
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,940
Download the other client right now if you want to swap girls.

3555
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:08,420
Exactly.

3556
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:10,100
Oh god.

3557
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,560
Oh, you know, I don't want...

3558
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:13,860
Okay.

3559
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:16,300
Oh, I got string theory?

3560
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,580
My girl's smart.

3561
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:23,410
Alright.

3562
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,710
Oh, nice.

3563
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:25,650
I got pretty...

3564
02:12:25,650 --> 02:12:26,670
Is that an icon?

3565
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:28,470
Can't change my...

3566
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:30,350
Oh my god, I got an icon that she gave me.

3567
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:31,910
I need to hide my screen just in case.

3568
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:33,510
I don't know what my profile shows.

3569
02:12:33,870 --> 02:12:35,330
I don't know what my profile shows.

3570
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:37,210
Wait, how do...

3571
02:12:37,210 --> 02:12:37,970
What are you trying to hide, huh?

3572
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:39,330
I don't know.

3573
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:41,050
I don't want people to see my friend code.

3574
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:42,450
What are you trying to hide, huh?

3575
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:44,250
I don't want people to see my friend code.

3576
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:45,750
You got things to hide?

3577
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:48,190
Yeah, I don't want random people to...

3578
02:12:48,190 --> 02:12:51,570
Yeah, you want me to show them your friend code right now?

3579
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:52,510
Yeah.

3580
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:54,030
Okay.

3581
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:58,670
I didn't expect you to say that.

3582
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:00,510
My anime girl left me.

3583
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:01,890
I need a new hookup.

3584
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:04,010
You need a new hookup.

3585
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:06,510
I need a fucking rebound.

3586
02:13:08,090 --> 02:13:09,490
We got a new code.

3587
02:13:09,970 --> 02:13:10,250
Oh, yay.

3588
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:13,570
Wait, how do I change my icon like all you guys?

3589
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:16,970
How do you guys do that?

3590
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:19,270
Trying to change my icon.

3591
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:22,010
Like the banner?

3592
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:23,710
Yeah, my banner and my icon.

3593
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:25,950
If you click on the top left...

3594
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:26,150
Yeah?

3595
02:13:27,330 --> 02:13:27,730
Wait.

3596
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:28,490
Actually, wait.

3597
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:29,250
Let me see if...

3598
02:13:29,250 --> 02:13:29,990
Is it player chip?

3599
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:30,930
Oh, it's player chip.

3600
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:31,550
I found it.

3601
02:13:31,570 --> 02:13:31,910
It's player chip.

3602
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,210
Yeah.

3603
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:33,850
Yeah, I found it.

3604
02:13:34,610 --> 02:13:35,010
Save.

3605
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:37,970
Yeah, I want this to be it.

3606
02:13:38,530 --> 02:13:40,470
Oh my god, I get to have medals on too.

3607
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:42,230
Oh my god, that's when you know she's my girl.

3608
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:44,510
I get to put medals on it too.

3609
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:45,550
That's my girl.

3610
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:46,630
That's my girl.

3611
02:13:46,910 --> 02:13:47,570
That's her.

3612
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:48,990
Now I'm beautiful.

3613
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:50,430
Look.

3614
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:51,950
Look, guys.

3615
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:56,310
Alright, let's paste this code.

3616
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:03,350
I think the password thing doesn't work.

3617
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:09,840
As long as no one leaves the code, no matter.

3618
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:10,320
Yeah.

3619
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:13,100
Alright, I'm in.

3620
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:13,740
Are we defense?

3621
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:14,860
I don't remember.

3622
02:14:24,730 --> 02:14:25,610
We are...

3623
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:27,030
What did I roll?

3624
02:14:28,630 --> 02:14:29,650
For map two?

3625
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:33,310
No, we're attack, right?

3626
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,670
No.

3627
02:14:34,270 --> 02:14:37,170
We are...

3628
02:14:37,690 --> 02:14:38,630
Oh, we're defense.

3629
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:39,450
Yeah, never mind.

3630
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:40,770
This is your sniper map.

3631
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:42,050
Bro, what if I spent all my money?

3632
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:43,610
All my currency just to gamble though.

3633
02:14:44,830 --> 02:14:46,410
You already have everything you want.

3634
02:14:46,510 --> 02:14:47,250
What else do you want?

3635
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:52,130
It's not about what I have and what I want.

3636
02:14:52,270 --> 02:14:54,470
It's about spending more.

3637
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:56,030
So you have an addiction.

3638
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:58,910
No, I can stop whenever I want.

3639
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:03,510
But you know the old saying, every miner stops digging...

3640
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:03,830
What?

3641
02:15:06,530 --> 02:15:08,630
Why are you guys being weird?

3642
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:11,730
Why are you guys being weird?

3643
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:13,050
So slowly.

3644
02:15:16,210 --> 02:15:19,910
Every miner stops digging before diamonds.

3645
02:15:22,210 --> 02:15:24,770
You guys are the ones being weird.

3646
02:15:30,610 --> 02:15:34,410
It's spelled M-I-N-E-R.

3647
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:37,890
Like Minecraft.

3648
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:49,230
Okay, okay, Surefour.

3649
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:53,670
I just don't know why you hesitated there before you finished the sentence.

3650
02:15:53,950 --> 02:15:54,750
I didn't hesitate.

3651
02:15:55,150 --> 02:15:56,550
You guys didn't even let me finish.

3652
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:57,590
You just heard miner.

3653
02:15:57,710 --> 02:16:00,690
I'm freaking out.

3654
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:04,570
You had a fucking three second hesitation.

3655
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:06,470
It's not three seconds, bitch.

3656
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:07,970
Why are you so defensive?

3657
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:09,170
I don't understand.

3658
02:16:09,730 --> 02:16:11,090
What do you mean why am I defensive?

3659
02:16:11,530 --> 02:16:12,030
I don't understand.

3660
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:14,770
Surefour, you became...

3661
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:17,150
I'm not Dr. Disrespect out here, bro.

3662
02:16:19,490 --> 02:16:21,110
You can dig your hole.

3663
02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:23,090
I mean, you're a miner, right?

3664
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:24,410
You gotta go dig that hole.

3665
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:26,450
Yeah, for Gamba.

3666
02:16:30,690 --> 02:16:32,710
Every gambler quits before they make it big.

3667
02:16:32,910 --> 02:16:35,810
Yeah, that's basically the quote.

3668
02:16:35,990 --> 02:16:38,090
Not every miner stops.

3669
02:16:38,590 --> 02:16:48,430
I was quoting the image of that guy with the pickaxe and he's quitting and walking away and there's diamonds right beside him.

3670
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:50,870
He's a miner.

3671
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:52,350
Is he mine?

3672
02:16:53,970 --> 02:16:56,350
What about like a cave crawler?

3673
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:59,570
Who the fuck would say cave crawler?

3674
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:04,410
Are you trying to say our IGL is weird?

3675
02:17:04,410 --> 02:17:07,650
Are you trying... how could you?

3676
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:09,750
That's our IGL right there.

3677
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:11,770
Anyone without green ping is weird.

3678
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:13,250
Weird, weird.

3679
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:14,910
I don't agree with that.

3680
02:17:18,810 --> 02:17:20,430
Doki's the only one with green ping.

3681
02:17:21,070 --> 02:17:23,330
Yeah, Doki's the only one with green ping.

3682
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:24,930
What the fuck, this is bullshit.

3683
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:25,810
They switched servers.

3684
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:27,770
They're not even green either.

3685
02:17:28,530 --> 02:17:29,650
They switched servers.

3686
02:17:30,810 --> 02:17:32,170
Oh, they swapped to West Coast.

3687
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:33,290
This is West Coast.

3688
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:34,550
That just means I'm half weird.

3689
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:39,110
Trooper, get the fuck on our team.

3690
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:42,210
No, I'm part of the enemy team now.

3691
02:17:44,570 --> 02:17:45,990
How are we mean?

3692
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:47,910
We were just asking for clarification.

3693
02:17:49,050 --> 02:17:50,210
No, you weren't.

3694
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:52,470
We were just trying to protect you.

3695
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,410
We were trying to protect you.

3696
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:56,370
I can't, I can't.

3697
02:17:56,530 --> 02:17:58,730
You've been so weird ever since you became gay, man.

3698
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:03,810
Listen, next is someone we have to be careful about.

3699
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:05,070
He lives in VRChat.

3700
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:08,470
I don't, excuse you, I don't.

3701
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:09,490
Yes, you do.

3702
02:18:09,610 --> 02:18:10,670
What do you mean?

3703
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:14,130
You have no idea what I do in that game.

3704
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:14,790
What do you do?

3705
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:15,430
What do you do?

3706
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:17,570
I'm not an anime girl.

3707
02:18:17,630 --> 02:18:19,310
What do you do?

3708
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:21,050
I have a clip that you sent me.

3709
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:22,830
Do you want me to post that clip?

3710
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:24,610
Wait, what clip?

3711
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:25,310
Hold on.

3712
02:18:30,130 --> 02:18:33,430
I can post that clip right now in our team chat.

3713
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:34,830
Wait, which one?

3714
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:36,990
Which one?

3715
02:18:38,130 --> 02:18:39,350
There's too many clips.

3716
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:41,690
I'm throwing.

3717
02:18:42,490 --> 02:18:43,610
I'm throwing.

3718
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:47,070
Alright, here's one of them that they sent me.

3719
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:50,850
Wait, where did you post that?

3720
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:52,310
It's in our team chat.

3721
02:18:53,230 --> 02:18:54,350
Oh, no.

3722
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:55,290
Oh, no.

3723
02:18:56,390 --> 02:18:58,550
Time to full screen it and watch it on Twitch.

3724
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:01,070
No, don't watch that.

3725
02:19:06,970 --> 02:19:09,370
Look, it's RP.

3726
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:10,790
It's RP only, okay?

3727
02:19:10,890 --> 02:19:11,470
It's fine.

3728
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:15,410
Wait, no, I'm watching it.

3729
02:19:15,470 --> 02:19:16,150
What is this?

3730
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:20,610
Wait, I gotta mute Discord to hear this.

3731
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:25,230
You gotta mute Discord?

3732
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:27,090
What is this?

3733
02:19:27,390 --> 02:19:29,010
Guys, if you guys...

3734
02:19:29,010 --> 02:19:33,290
I can post this in my chat right now, next.

3735
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:34,470
That's all I'm saying.

3736
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:44,710
Go for it, honestly.

3737
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:45,210
It's funny.

3738
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:53,710
This is what he said.

3739
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:01,110
Alright, now you're gonna defend yourself?

3740
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:03,530
Are you still gonna defend yourself?

3741
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:05,110
Hell yeah, dude.

3742
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:05,990
That shit's hard.

3743
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:15,740
There you go.

3744
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:17,120
You guys got the clip.

3745
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:21,060
Anyways...

3746
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:23,220
I can see why you're bottom fragging now.

3747
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:25,780
Wait, wait, wait.

3748
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:33,960
Bro, come on.

3749
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:38,740
It's only RP.

3750
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:39,800
It's just RP.

3751
02:20:40,060 --> 02:20:41,620
It's just RP.

3752
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:47,140
Sure, as an ex-VR chat player, what do you say about that?

3753
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,220
Yeah, it fits his type.

3754
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:52,940
It fits his type.

3755
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,720
I'm just jealous, honestly.

3756
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:58,700
I don't think that's the right word.

3757
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:00,840
How many hours you got next?

3758
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:02,460
Actually, not that many.

3759
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:03,180
Hold on, let me see.

3760
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,780
I think I just bet like a thousand something.

3761
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:07,260
You just said a thousand?

3762
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:10,480
I have 8.5K.

3763
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:18,800
I've seen every archetype of VR chat player.

3764
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,960
What kind of archetype is next?

3765
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:22,180
What is he?

3766
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,160
The best.

3767
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:25,180
Like the horny femboy.

3768
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:29,940
I'm not even horny.

3769
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:30,700
Come on, man.

3770
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:34,900
We saw the clip.

3771
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:39,840
I like how you don't even defend the femboy part.

3772
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:42,540
You just went like, okay, I'm not that part.

3773
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:48,320
On stream, I'm known as something waver, so I'm not taking the femboy.

3774
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:49,760
Wait, wait, wait.

3775
02:21:50,060 --> 02:21:50,960
Do you want to tell us?

3776
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:51,460
What?

3777
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:56,840
I'm known as the racist European femboy.

3778
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,860
He's just included with two more titles.

3779
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:02,900
I mean, to that extent, you're European.

3780
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:08,760
I assume every European is racist.

3781
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:11,280
It's just who I am.

3782
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:14,440
Wait, what is Ethos typing in the world chat?

3783
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:15,740
I don't know.

3784
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:16,780
I close world chat.

3785
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:17,600
Wait, I close world chat.

3786
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:18,460
That's a reason.

3787
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,460
Wait, wait, wait.

3788
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:21,480
I'll screenshot it.

3789
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:23,780
I'll screenshot it and send it in our team chat.

3790
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:26,360
You're right.

3791
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:27,520
I shouldn't be worried about Shurf.

3792
02:22:28,220 --> 02:22:30,220
Shurf is definitely not the one that's missing.

3793
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:33,000
Oh, goddammit.

3794
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,160
This is what we're going against.

3795
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,460
We'll get more water.

3796
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:44,440
You know, I would reply to that, but it gets a little bit above PG.

3797
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:45,460
Oh, no.

3798
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:47,480
Professional.

3799
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:51,200
Wait, I just need to write, like...

3800
02:23:10,250 --> 02:23:11,390
Alright, I'm back.

3801
02:23:13,190 --> 02:23:16,290
Wait, how did my world chat unclose itself?

3802
02:23:18,530 --> 02:23:18,970
Hackers.

3803
02:23:19,230 --> 02:23:19,790
Oh, my god.

3804
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:20,910
They're out to get me.

3805
02:23:21,330 --> 02:23:22,430
Dirty hacker mans.

3806
02:23:22,930 --> 02:23:23,510
Alright, guys.

3807
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:28,510
Is Zyder going to be a 1 or 2, 9 or...

3808
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:30,990
We're going to have an okay time.

3809
02:23:31,150 --> 02:23:32,230
We're going to...

3810
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:35,350
We're going to have an okay time.

3811
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:38,350
No, we're going to have a great time.

3812
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:41,790
Guys, it's not the final sponsor stream.

3813
02:23:41,810 --> 02:23:42,970
Guys, I accepted Lyric's friend request.

3814
02:23:44,170 --> 02:23:44,390
What?

3815
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:46,630
Yeah, Lyric...

3816
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:47,430
Oh, Lyric!

3817
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:48,190
Oh, okay.

3818
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:49,130
Lyric, okay.

3819
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:50,290
I thought you meant something else.

3820
02:23:50,890 --> 02:23:51,210
What?

3821
02:23:51,490 --> 02:23:53,390
I thought I heard something else.

3822
02:23:54,850 --> 02:23:56,090
Wait, what did you... What?

3823
02:23:57,250 --> 02:23:57,550
What?

3824
02:23:58,510 --> 02:23:59,510
No, that's fine.

3825
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:00,490
That's fine.

3826
02:24:01,010 --> 02:24:03,170
As long as it's not what I thought I heard.

3827
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:05,510
What?

3828
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:07,990
Oh, I have a friend request from Next.

3829
02:24:08,990 --> 02:24:10,250
I'm going to reject that real quick.

3830
02:24:10,650 --> 02:24:11,470
What the fuck?

3831
02:24:12,370 --> 02:24:13,970
I can't even get friend zones.

3832
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:14,510
Hello?

3833
02:24:14,770 --> 02:24:17,550
Wait, can I get added by everyone?

3834
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:20,830
If we win this game.

3835
02:24:21,370 --> 02:24:21,990
Oh, okay.

3836
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:22,250
Okay.

3837
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:23,570
If we win this game.

3838
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:25,550
I'm kidding.

3839
02:24:25,810 --> 02:24:26,230
I'm kidding.

3840
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:26,570
I'm kidding.

3841
02:24:26,570 --> 02:24:27,530
Why do you mean by that?

3842
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:30,930
You're supposed to give us hope and inspiration.

3843
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:34,590
I'm throwing.

3844
02:24:34,930 --> 02:24:37,250
All I need is Next's friend request.

3845
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:38,170
You're throwing?

3846
02:24:38,290 --> 02:24:39,470
Why are you throwing, Surefour?

3847
02:24:40,510 --> 02:24:41,050
I'm throwing.

3848
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:41,950
Why are you throwing?

3849
02:24:42,410 --> 02:24:43,490
I'm sick of it.

3850
02:24:43,850 --> 02:24:45,250
What are you sick of?

3851
02:24:45,490 --> 02:24:47,110
I'm unleashing my Bankai.

3852
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:48,610
Oh my god.

3853
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:57,090
Oh my god.

3854
02:24:57,470 --> 02:24:59,030
What are we waiting on right now?

3855
02:25:00,170 --> 02:25:00,850
I don't know.

3856
02:25:01,690 --> 02:25:02,350
Oh, wait.

3857
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:03,490
Ready up.

3858
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:04,750
Start the match.

3859
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:05,790
Start the match.

3860
02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:08,070
Don't we have like two more games after this?

3861
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:09,290
No, it's this.

3862
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:11,490
After this and then one game.

3863
02:25:11,970 --> 02:25:13,690
Because we've only played four games.

3864
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:16,450
So this is like... Yeah, we only have one game after this.

3865
02:25:16,910 --> 02:25:18,950
It's just the same team, but like in a different map.

3866
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:20,350
And then...

3867
02:25:20,350 --> 02:25:22,610
Oh, you mean this is the final match.

3868
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:24,430
Yeah, this is the... This is the... No.

3869
02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:25,270
Yeah, match.

3870
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:25,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3871
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:27,230
Okay.

3872
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:30,730
And if we win both, then we're probably playing...

3873
02:25:30,730 --> 02:25:31,330
Day two.

3874
02:25:32,090 --> 02:25:33,970
Yeah, but that's in like a week or two, right?

3875
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:35,170
I don't remember how many weeks.

3876
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,510
Yeah, in a week.

3877
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:36,610
In a week, yeah.

3878
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:38,090
So we don't have to worry about that in a week.

3879
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:41,570
Oh my god, I can get on VR after this.

3880
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:42,950
Bro.

3881
02:25:43,370 --> 02:25:44,790
I'm not a VR chatter.

3882
02:25:44,930 --> 02:25:46,310
I don't get on it every day.

3883
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:48,670
Oh my god, I can get on VR chat after this.

3884
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:52,790
Actually, I'm not able to because I have bleeding in my head.

3885
02:25:53,550 --> 02:25:53,810
What?

3886
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:55,490
How do you have bleeding in your head?

3887
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:56,890
Wait, how... What happened?

3888
02:25:57,290 --> 02:25:57,930
VR chat happened.

3889
02:25:58,170 --> 02:25:59,610
No, actually...

3890
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:03,070
Did your handband destroy your head or something?

3891
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:04,010
Like, what?

3892
02:26:04,590 --> 02:26:05,690
Why are you here?

3893
02:26:05,730 --> 02:26:07,050
It was from dancing, wasn't it?

3894
02:26:07,050 --> 02:26:07,230
Why are you in the hospital?

3895
02:26:07,570 --> 02:26:09,070
It was from dancing, wasn't it?

3896
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:10,690
No, it wasn't from dancing.

3897
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:12,670
Let's just say I was playing VR chat, okay?

3898
02:26:13,130 --> 02:26:13,390
Wait.

3899
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:16,690
So ERP got a little bit too bussy.

3900
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:20,490
Oh, but how did that... How did it involve the head?

3901
02:26:21,590 --> 02:26:22,230
I mean...

3902
02:26:22,230 --> 02:26:24,010
We were trying some experimental...

3903
02:26:24,650 --> 02:26:26,170
Experimental positions, yeah.

3904
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:30,190
Like, I legit have a huge headache right now because of that.

3905
02:26:30,510 --> 02:26:31,730
Wait, why aren't you at the hospital?

3906
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:33,450
That's why you're bottom fragging.

3907
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:37,250
Because, I mean, you know, who needs them, honestly?

3908
02:26:38,030 --> 02:26:39,230
I mean, you're in Europe.

3909
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:40,190
Don't you have free healthcare?

3910
02:26:40,850 --> 02:26:42,150
Yeah, but like, what are they gonna do?

3911
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:43,330
Oh, well, okay, well...

3912
02:26:43,330 --> 02:26:44,510
Stop the bleeding?

3913
02:26:45,430 --> 02:26:47,070
No, I know it.

3914
02:26:48,310 --> 02:26:48,750
What?

3915
02:26:49,450 --> 02:26:50,830
Wait, I don't even know you're fucking...

3916
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:52,070
Wait, someone left.

3917
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:53,630
Oh, yeah, they forfeit.

3918
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:54,910
Let's go.

3919
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:55,430
They forfeit?

3920
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:57,390
They forfeit.

3921
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:01,890
We got a number one victory royale.

3922
02:27:01,970 --> 02:27:03,710
Yeah, Fortnite, we're about to get down.

3923
02:27:03,790 --> 02:27:04,290
Get down!

3924
02:27:04,470 --> 02:27:06,170
Ten kills on the board right now.

3925
02:27:06,350 --> 02:27:08,270
Just wiped out Tomato Town.

3926
02:27:08,950 --> 02:27:10,230
My friend just got downed.

3927
02:27:10,270 --> 02:27:10,930
I revived him.

3928
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:12,030
Now we're heading southbound.

3929
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:14,570
I think they're switching servers.

3930
02:27:15,150 --> 02:27:15,490
Oh!

3931
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:17,150
Oh shit, he knows the rest of it.

3932
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:17,370
Oh!

3933
02:27:19,090 --> 02:27:19,970
Of course!

3934
02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:21,690
He one-upped you.

3935
02:27:22,130 --> 02:27:23,270
I couldn't... I wouldn't take that.

3936
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:24,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3937
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:25,730
Why are we instigating?

3938
02:27:27,130 --> 02:27:29,870
He's had too much pressure.

3939
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:31,550
You can't blame him.

3940
02:27:31,670 --> 02:27:34,590
He literally is bleeding right now, so...

3941
02:27:34,590 --> 02:27:36,150
True, I am disabled.

3942
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:39,390
I am really bleeding right now.

3943
02:27:42,730 --> 02:27:46,590
Guys, Trifor and I are both sponsored right now and I'm a little worried.

3944
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:48,450
This is a great sponsor.

3945
02:27:48,630 --> 02:27:49,250
What the fuck do you mean?

3946
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:53,710
I've been enjoying the content.

3947
02:27:54,270 --> 02:27:56,590
You are the content!

3948
02:27:57,170 --> 02:27:59,430
These conversations are what make people watch more.

3949
02:27:59,450 --> 02:28:00,870
That's true, that's true.

3950
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:06,530
If you place Trinova right now and use my code, not Surefor's code, but my code...

3951
02:28:06,530 --> 02:28:06,930
We have codes?

3952
02:28:08,390 --> 02:28:10,550
You don't need to worry about Surefor, I think.

3953
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:11,750
We got codes?

3954
02:28:12,530 --> 02:28:13,010
It's true.

3955
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:16,550
The fuck you mean we got codes?

3956
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:22,470
Okay, Surefor's chat, I have a tracking link on my stream right now.

3957
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:23,530
Hey, don't click that shit!

3958
02:28:23,710 --> 02:28:25,830
Get out of here!

3959
02:28:28,450 --> 02:28:32,910
I have a tracking code that you too can click, guys.

3960
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:34,330
Slashme puts up the walls?

3961
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:36,190
None of you are allowed over there.

3962
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:37,850
I'm mod, I can't...

3963
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:39,110
I can post a link in your chat!

3964
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:44,710
Unmod, time out for four hours.

3965
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:45,290
No, no, no!

3966
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:48,530
No, I'm dying!

3967
02:28:49,550 --> 02:28:51,190
Cleaning up the trash.

3968
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:54,890
Wait, Surefor, I see that there's a new mods edition, can I get it?

3969
02:28:57,470 --> 02:28:59,010
Come back to me in four hours.

3970
02:28:59,150 --> 02:29:02,030
Yo, that's me right there, hi.

3971
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:03,890
First message?

3972
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:07,790
Not following?

3973
02:29:08,890 --> 02:29:09,950
Oh shit, bro.

3974
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:11,370
There we go.

3975
02:29:12,930 --> 02:29:14,790
Timed out 14 days.

3976
02:29:15,050 --> 02:29:16,690
No, what the fuck?

3977
02:29:17,410 --> 02:29:19,570
1,209,000,000 seconds.

3978
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:26,700
At least it wasn't my first message.

3979
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,520
Hey, can I get mod though?

3980
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:32,640
Not after that.

3981
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,160
Hey guys, you guys saw my link for like 5 seconds.

3982
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:39,100
So you can press that tracking link.

3983
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:43,340
My name is Deez.

3984
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:46,360
What the fuck do you mean?

3985
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:48,180
Where's your tracking link?

3986
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,060
I don't know.

3987
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:51,680
What do you mean you don't know?

3988
02:29:54,980 --> 02:29:55,760
It's okay.

3989
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:57,560
More tracking links.

3990
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:59,980
I don't even know if I'm supposed to have one.

3991
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:05,040
Yes, everybody is supposed to have a tracking link.

3992
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:07,360
What the fuck do you mean tracking link?

3993
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:12,020
It's okay guys, it's okay.

3994
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:14,540
You guys can use my tracking link.

3995
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:15,740
We're both sponsored.

3996
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:21,800
And since he doesn't have it, I have this tracking link that you can press too.

3997
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,880
You can't censor an audio, chill.

3998
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:28,860
My tracking link is trenova.link.

3999
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:31,620
I think I do have a link.

4000
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:35,420
Oh my god, what do I get if I sign up with your code?

4001
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:36,400
Is this the link?

4002
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:39,960
I don't know.

4003
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:41,000
I'm just posting chat.

4004
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:41,800
I don't know what it does.

4005
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:44,640
Is this trenova.link?

4006
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:45,700
Yeah.

4007
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:47,540
Yeah, that is the link.

4008
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:50,160
Hey, I got a link.

4009
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:51,760
Huge.

4010
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:53,380
Where was it?

4011
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:55,420
It was like there.

4012
02:30:56,140 --> 02:30:57,740
Someone didn't read their messages.

4013
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:02,840
I did, but they just said I got a link and I thought that was just a link to the download.

4014
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:07,880
Wait, that is your tracking link.

4015
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:10,660
Guys, don't click his tracking link, guys.

4016
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:11,920
No, click mine.

4017
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:12,900
No, click mine.

4018
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:14,940
VTubers aren't real.

4019
02:31:15,780 --> 02:31:16,620
You're not real.

4020
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:17,820
I'm real.

4021
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:18,880
I have flesh.

4022
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,740
I can turn on my webcam right now if I want to.

4023
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:20,960
Do it.

4024
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:21,760
Do it then.

4025
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:22,400
Do it, yeah.

4026
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,040
Show us your setup.

4027
02:31:24,260 --> 02:31:24,560
Yeah.

4028
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:25,080
Alright.

4029
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:28,660
Wait, where's my OBS?

4030
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:32,940
Boom.

4031
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:35,180
Show everybody that you're real.

4032
02:31:37,180 --> 02:31:40,560
I have flesh, unlike this fake amalgamation.

4033
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:42,100
Oh my god.

4034
02:31:42,580 --> 02:31:45,700
You look just like you did when you played Overwatch back in the day.

4035
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:49,100
Yeah, I think that's how, like, living works.

4036
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:52,360
I don't think you're the same.

4037
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:55,160
I've actually lost, like, 18 pounds.

4038
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:56,080
Oh, shit.

4039
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:57,560
Nice, good for you.

4040
02:31:57,900 --> 02:31:58,460
Thank you.

4041
02:31:58,600 --> 02:31:58,840
Thank you.

4042
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:01,820
Wait, I'm going to... I'm going B.

4043
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:02,780
Oh, it's this.

4044
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:04,520
Why did we pick this map, guys?

4045
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,800
I'll be up here, I guess.

4046
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:09,220
I don't know.

4047
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:10,400
I don't know how to defend this.

4048
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:13,040
I know how to defend A more than B.

4049
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:15,160
I don't think I've ever played this map.

4050
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:16,680
Yes, you have.

4051
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:17,940
That was our first game together.

4052
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:20,120
Wait a minute.

4053
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:24,180
Yeah, that was our first warm-up game together.

4054
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:27,860
I want to say something, but I'm not going to say it.

4055
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:29,140
We're going to say it.

4056
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:30,720
We're going to say it.

4057
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:36,420
Can you heal me?

4058
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:36,980
Can you heal me?

4059
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:42,420
We need to head over soon.

4060
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:44,000
Yeah, we can.

4061
02:32:44,180 --> 02:32:45,160
You want to go for Heaven?

4062
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:46,920
Yeah, I'm going Heaven.

4063
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,320
Oh, she's right here.

4064
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:50,560
What do you do?

4065
02:32:50,620 --> 02:32:50,920
I'm dead.

4066
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:51,820
I'm going to crossfire.

4067
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:53,120
Oh, I got body blocked.

4068
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:54,240
I got body blocked.

4069
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:56,400
Oh my god!

4070
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:59,800
Guys, now I...

4071
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:01,440
They know how I play this game, guys.

4072
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:02,380
They know.

4073
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:03,740
They have the movement.

4074
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:06,440
I'm sitting down.

4075
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:07,400
I'm very submissive.

4076
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:15,120
Hey!

4077
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:15,860
Nice trade!

4078
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:16,500
Nice trade!

4079
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:23,000
So, what are you going to be doing, Trifor?

4080
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:26,440
Well, I'm backup, so I don't look in the mirror anymore.

4081
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:31,140
Where do I play?

4082
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:31,960
AI, I guess?

4083
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:33,560
Yeah, probably.

4084
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:35,640
Alright, then I guess I'll play B.

4085
02:33:36,500 --> 02:33:38,780
I'm not used to playing B, but I'll try my best.

4086
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:47,380
Alright, I'll be in this little cubby hole.

4087
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:55,040
Guys, I think we're going to know how it feels to be that other team last game.

4088
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:57,160
Nah, we're going to win.

4089
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:00,040
Oh, they're right here again.

4090
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:00,860
They're right here again.

4091
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,760
They're going to put the wall up on my ping here.

4092
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:06,980
They have, like, set lineups and setups.

4093
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:11,080
This team has been scrimming for a long time.

4094
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:12,780
They've been scrimming?!

4095
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:14,240
Yes, they've been scrimming!

4096
02:34:15,940 --> 02:34:16,260
What?!

4097
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:16,880
I'm blind.

4098
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:21,180
Yeah, but Trifor and I are sponsored, so, like, who's winning?

4099
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:24,200
I'm coming behind them right now.

4100
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:25,060
Yep.

4101
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:26,800
I'll push through.

4102
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:29,080
I can't see anything.

4103
02:34:29,300 --> 02:34:30,320
I'm going for 139.

4104
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:31,380
I'm going through the wall.

4105
02:34:32,300 --> 02:34:33,760
The one on pillar is one-shotting.

4106
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:35,260
To your right, Toki.

4107
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:35,740
To your right, Toki.

4108
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:36,860
Bottom right, bottom right, bottom right.

4109
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,200
Okay, I can see him.

4110
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:38,940
Bottom right, bottom right, bottom right.

4111
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:40,360
One side, he's focused on the other side.

4112
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:41,120
I got him, I got him.

4113
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:42,420
Last one, last one.

4114
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:43,100
Bottom right, bottom right.

4115
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:44,440
You can arrest people.

4116
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:44,980
You can arrest people.

4117
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:46,920
Yeah, I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing.

4118
02:34:46,940 --> 02:34:47,520
Yeah, yeah.

4119
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:48,900
I'm rezzable, too.

4120
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,120
I have, like, a...

4121
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,320
They haven't planted yet.

4122
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:53,120
We don't have to run at them.

4123
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:53,800
We don't have to run at them.

4124
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:55,200
I'm putting turret.

4125
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:56,540
This player is very good.

4126
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,020
Never mind.

4127
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:58,440
Yeah, let's go!

4128
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:04,320
Listen, I had someone in my chat say, Oh, hey, I recognize that team.

4129
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:05,540
That is CN's server team.

4130
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:06,960
All those guys are good at the game.

4131
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:07,760
Yeah.

4132
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,500
Wait, why are they in our lobby?

4133
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:12,880
No, it's fine, it's fine.

4134
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:15,520
Because we won a round, baby, and we're gonna win out.

4135
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:18,120
Listen, listen, we won a round, we can win the game.

4136
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:21,660
They should be playing against the other team that's on CN's servers.

4137
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:23,260
Hey, stop freaking around.

4138
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:24,440
We got a round.

4139
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:25,680
We got gamers here.

4140
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:26,920
I believe, I believe.

4141
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:29,800
Guys, we got one round off the pros.

4142
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:30,400
We're gamers.

4143
02:35:30,860 --> 02:35:32,380
No, no, no, we're pros, too.

4144
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:35,180
I did so much damage that round.

4145
02:35:35,260 --> 02:35:36,040
I broke so much armor.

4146
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:37,040
Okay.

4147
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:39,820
Dude, they're not gonna go A again.

4148
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:41,340
They're gonna C, they're gonna C.

4149
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:45,700
They're gonna show Mac and Nex what they did.

4150
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:48,000
Don't fight yet, don't fight yet.

4151
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:48,820
I'm rotating.

4152
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,160
They're pushing Nex right now.

4153
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:52,040
Yeah, they're on me.

4154
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:53,440
Shoot them, shoot them.

4155
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:54,280
I can kill you, I can kill you.

4156
02:35:55,180 --> 02:35:55,840
He's one, he's one.

4157
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,080
One HP, one HP, one HP.

4158
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:59,140
I can heal you, I can heal you.

4159
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:02,960
There's people on the side, there's people on the side.

4160
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:04,320
I'm smoking, I smoked the closet.

4161
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:05,460
Go in the room, go in the room.

4162
02:36:06,140 --> 02:36:06,860
I fucked up my name.

4163
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:09,420
Follow me, come to me, come to me.

4164
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:09,660
Okay, okay.

4165
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:14,420
They haven't planted yet, so we don't have to over-aggress.

4166
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:16,240
I ulted.

4167
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:19,160
I don't see them, I don't know where they are.

4168
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:21,200
We got bomb down.

4169
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:22,040
I don't know how to ping.

4170
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:23,020
Push with me, push with me, push with me.

4171
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:23,860
I'm right there, I'm right there, I'm right there.

4172
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:25,740
I'm holding this A, I'm holding this A.

4173
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:26,380
You can arrest me.

4174
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:27,360
Wait, surefour, come here, surefour.

4175
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:28,020
Coming.

4176
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:29,740
Oh, by me, by me, by me.

4177
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:31,300
By me, right here, right here, right here.

4178
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:33,160
Nex, you can try to kill Rachie there.

4179
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:37,430
I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

4180
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:37,990
There's two of me.

4181
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:39,590
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm going there.

4182
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:41,410
I'm ulting.

4183
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:43,230
I'm getting the paper spot.

4184
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:43,630
Oh my god.

4185
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:44,990
They're pushing you, they're pushing you.

4186
02:36:45,210 --> 02:36:45,330
Yep.

4187
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:46,310
They're coming out, they're coming out.

4188
02:36:46,410 --> 02:36:47,150
By me, by me, by me.

4189
02:36:48,670 --> 02:36:49,170
It's fine.

4190
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:50,810
It's just one.

4191
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:51,490
Yeah, let's go!

4192
02:36:52,310 --> 02:36:53,330
How did that miss?

4193
02:36:53,950 --> 02:36:55,690
Okay, see, we're already in the lead.

4194
02:36:55,810 --> 02:36:56,650
Come on, just focus.

4195
02:36:57,650 --> 02:37:00,030
Alright, let's try, let's try our best, guys.

4196
02:37:00,130 --> 02:37:01,130
I believe.

4197
02:37:03,290 --> 02:37:04,930
I start believing now.

4198
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:07,070
Don't let me down, protector.

4199
02:37:07,490 --> 02:37:08,170
I've always believed.

4200
02:37:08,390 --> 02:37:08,970
Honestly, this is easy.

4201
02:37:08,970 --> 02:37:10,890
Hey, my drone gives armor now.

4202
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:11,870
Nice.

4203
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:12,370
Oh, big.

4204
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:12,950
Okay, sure.

4205
02:37:13,050 --> 02:37:14,350
Sure, go to my ping.

4206
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:15,590
Yeah, that's fine.

4207
02:37:15,690 --> 02:37:16,510
Hold my left.

4208
02:37:16,810 --> 02:37:16,930
Yep.

4209
02:37:17,090 --> 02:37:17,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4210
02:37:18,910 --> 02:37:20,550
I didn't hit a single shot that round.

4211
02:37:20,790 --> 02:37:21,350
No, it's fine.

4212
02:37:21,710 --> 02:37:22,190
That's fine.

4213
02:37:22,590 --> 02:37:23,310
It happens.

4214
02:37:23,470 --> 02:37:25,470
Not everybody can, you know, frag out.

4215
02:37:25,890 --> 02:37:26,530
My name's Deez.

4216
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:35,880
I don't see nobody.

4217
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:37,160
Ayy.

4218
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:38,040
Ayy.

4219
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:38,240
Ayy.

4220
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:39,300
Ayy, I'm heading over.

4221
02:37:43,070 --> 02:37:44,230
Whoa, what ult is that?

4222
02:37:44,490 --> 02:37:45,610
They might try to kill me.

4223
02:37:45,610 --> 02:37:47,390
Yeah, they're pushing, they're pushing, they're pushing you.

4224
02:37:47,970 --> 02:37:48,990
I threw the wrong nade.

4225
02:37:50,430 --> 02:37:51,610
Oh, they're gonna...

4226
02:37:52,270 --> 02:37:52,970
Can we just take Heaven?

4227
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:54,610
I am... I naded.

4228
02:37:54,750 --> 02:37:55,330
Can you heal me?

4229
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:56,330
Yeah, I can.

4230
02:37:56,650 --> 02:37:56,890
Ooh!

4231
02:37:58,730 --> 02:37:59,510
Are you guys okay?

4232
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:01,470
I'm, I'm, I'm...

4233
02:38:01,870 --> 02:38:02,670
It's fine, it's fine.

4234
02:38:03,430 --> 02:38:04,410
I got revealed, so...

4235
02:38:04,410 --> 02:38:05,170
You might push through the wall.

4236
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:05,830
Yeah.

4237
02:38:06,490 --> 02:38:07,690
I smoked on the left side of the wall.

4238
02:38:08,030 --> 02:38:08,950
They did push through the wall.

4239
02:38:10,810 --> 02:38:11,370
They're fishing.

4240
02:38:12,010 --> 02:38:12,530
Someone push us over.

4241
02:38:12,670 --> 02:38:14,110
She's on the box, she's on the box.

4242
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:15,590
Oh, I can't see, I can't see.

4243
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:16,130
I can't see now.

4244
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:17,850
I'll try to, I'll try to rez you if I can.

4245
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:19,710
But I'm in a very bad spot.

4246
02:38:19,950 --> 02:38:21,030
Yeah, I literally can't see.

4247
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:22,990
I'm dead.

4248
02:38:22,990 --> 02:38:24,770
They're pushing, they're pushing behind you, Aqua.

4249
02:38:25,050 --> 02:38:25,890
Yeah, yeah, I see them.

4250
02:38:25,890 --> 02:38:26,750
They're going Heaven, they're going Heaven.

4251
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:27,350
Two on top, two on top left.

4252
02:38:27,510 --> 02:38:28,750
Wait, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna go.

4253
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:30,050
One, one, one, I got one.

4254
02:38:30,570 --> 02:38:31,750
Like, not one, he's one HP.

4255
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:34,090
No, he's one HP, I didn't get him.

4256
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:34,350
Nice.

4257
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:36,910
There's one more here, one more here, one more here.

4258
02:38:36,910 --> 02:38:37,850
Oh, he's so low.

4259
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:40,630
I don't think we... yeah, they got the point.

4260
02:38:40,650 --> 02:38:42,070
Oh, yeah, that was really hard.

4261
02:38:43,390 --> 02:38:48,590
I accidentally threw my whirlwind grenade instead of my anti-air grenade.

4262
02:38:48,990 --> 02:38:49,850
Oh, that's unlucky.

4263
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:51,210
I have, I have turret for retake.

4264
02:38:53,530 --> 02:38:55,570
Um, yeah, yeah, that's fine, actually.

4265
02:38:58,590 --> 02:38:59,670
Just do the same setup.

4266
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:06,310
Um, Abe, can you stand over here to, to, like, watch this or to watch them, like, push up Ceylon?

4267
02:39:06,410 --> 02:39:08,410
Yeah, I usually, I just throw a bear on it.

4268
02:39:08,810 --> 02:39:10,270
Oh, no, you don't have to throw a bear.

4269
02:39:10,270 --> 02:39:15,010
You can just use the bear for, um, like, utility when you're retaking site, or, like, um, holding it.

4270
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:17,410
Because the vulnerability is very, very low.

4271
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:23,590
Okay, I'm chilling.

4272
02:39:23,850 --> 02:39:24,750
I don't see anything, Cey.

4273
02:39:25,030 --> 02:39:25,270
A?

4274
02:39:26,410 --> 02:39:27,770
Yeah, I'm rotating already.

4275
02:39:28,690 --> 02:39:29,510
I'm heading over.

4276
02:39:32,890 --> 02:39:33,750
I'm gonna push, Cey.

4277
02:39:34,150 --> 02:39:34,350
Okay.

4278
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:37,230
Uh, we're, we're gonna, we have a long flank, so it's gonna take a while.

4279
02:39:38,690 --> 02:39:40,370
Um, they might try to push us before.

4280
02:39:40,910 --> 02:39:41,930
64 on one of them.

4281
02:39:42,130 --> 02:39:45,270
Um, wait, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, Michelle, up here?

4282
02:39:45,370 --> 02:39:46,510
I got pushed though, I got pushed.

4283
02:39:47,130 --> 02:39:48,650
I'm pushing, I threw my ult, I threw my ult.

4284
02:39:49,130 --> 02:39:49,610
Okay, okay, okay.

4285
02:39:49,810 --> 02:39:50,010
I'm getting thirsted.

4286
02:39:50,370 --> 02:39:51,190
I'm trying to get to you.

4287
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:51,790
I hit him a little bit.

4288
02:39:52,190 --> 02:39:52,870
No, I threw.

4289
02:39:53,810 --> 02:39:54,830
Wait, they revealed me.

4290
02:39:55,270 --> 02:39:55,550
Nice.

4291
02:39:56,110 --> 02:39:57,070
There's one in heaven right now.

4292
02:39:57,290 --> 02:39:57,650
Just be careful.

4293
02:39:57,730 --> 02:39:57,850
Oh!

4294
02:39:58,630 --> 02:39:59,670
Oh, he got me, yeah.

4295
02:39:59,890 --> 02:40:00,170
In heaven, in heaven.

4296
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:02,510
Uh, one is watching flank.

4297
02:40:04,090 --> 02:40:06,350
Yeah, I shouldn't have pushed that.

4298
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:09,790
That was too much of an ego push there.

4299
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:11,250
I'll play more safe.

4300
02:40:16,750 --> 02:40:18,310
They might go A, guys.

4301
02:40:18,830 --> 02:40:19,870
Yeah, I'm just going to give you a turret.

4302
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:21,710
I'm going to give turrets at...

4303
02:40:21,710 --> 02:40:23,150
I don't think I can play there reliably.

4304
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:26,470
No, you can play there, you just have to give it up, like, way faster.

4305
02:40:27,630 --> 02:40:28,690
I'm just going to play a turret.

4306
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:32,530
Like, you can take one or two shots, but when they, like, come in to, like, you, you can, you can just leave.

4307
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:33,690
Alright.

4308
02:40:41,470 --> 02:40:42,730
You have so much util.

4309
02:40:42,970 --> 02:40:43,790
Holy fuck.

4310
02:40:44,650 --> 02:40:45,490
Nothing C again.

4311
02:40:46,250 --> 02:40:46,450
Yep.

4312
02:40:46,970 --> 02:40:47,610
Nothing B.

4313
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:48,390
Uh, A.

4314
02:40:48,390 --> 02:40:49,430
Guys, they might be going A.

4315
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:50,370
They might be going A.

4316
02:40:50,390 --> 02:40:53,590
Wait, wait, wait, um, start, think about fighting down here, I think.

4317
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:57,030
I'm, I'm, I'll pop my ult, and we'll fight there.

4318
02:40:57,670 --> 02:40:58,450
I'm heading over then.

4319
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:01,050
Yeah, I'm here, I'm down, I'm heading over.

4320
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:02,290
Oh, my, my, my turret's up.

4321
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:02,790
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

4322
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:05,510
I have rez.

4323
02:41:06,210 --> 02:41:06,770
I'm going to bear.

4324
02:41:07,470 --> 02:41:08,490
They, they put a mirror.

4325
02:41:08,750 --> 02:41:11,110
I, I don't know how, if I should push through it.

4326
02:41:11,390 --> 02:41:12,330
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

4327
02:41:12,450 --> 02:41:13,710
It's two bottom right, two bottom right.

4328
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:14,550
Don't, don't push through it yet.

4329
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:16,310
I can rez.

4330
02:41:18,410 --> 02:41:19,410
There's one high ground.

4331
02:41:20,370 --> 02:41:21,590
I hit, I naded somebody.

4332
02:41:21,830 --> 02:41:21,970
Nice.

4333
02:41:22,090 --> 02:41:22,570
Wait, I'm.

4334
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:23,370
Oh, I got.

4335
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:24,190
There's one right in front of you.

4336
02:41:25,150 --> 02:41:25,890
He's one, he's one.

4337
02:41:25,970 --> 02:41:26,910
Oh, I got crossfire.

4338
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:27,930
There's a cross, nice.

4339
02:41:28,210 --> 02:41:28,630
I got one, I got one.

4340
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:29,250
There's two, there's two here, there's two here.

4341
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:29,870
I'll knock behind you next.

4342
02:41:29,970 --> 02:41:30,770
Sure, four, yeah, sure, four.

4343
02:41:30,890 --> 02:41:31,070
You can.

4344
02:41:31,190 --> 02:41:31,570
Yeah, I'm coming.

4345
02:41:32,150 --> 02:41:33,510
One on, one on right there, sure, four.

4346
02:41:34,130 --> 02:41:34,690
Two, two, two.

4347
02:41:35,350 --> 02:41:35,770
Nt, nt.

4348
02:41:35,990 --> 02:41:36,230
Uh.

4349
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:36,790
That's fine, that's fine.

4350
02:41:36,810 --> 02:41:38,570
Wait, am I not invisible when I'm in my bear?

4351
02:41:39,470 --> 02:41:41,590
No, you're not, you're not entirely invisible, I think.

4352
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:45,030
You're like, you're like, just like, somewhat transparent.

4353
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:49,980
Um.

4354
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:51,760
I'm just going to give you guys my turret.

4355
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:54,020
I feel like they're just hard, always going in.

4356
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:58,600
Oh yeah, sure, for your character, by the way, she can, she has the, she's the only one who can like, she's like lifeline.

4357
02:41:59,280 --> 02:41:59,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4358
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,240
She can lifeline right through.

4359
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:01,520
I pressed F on you and nothing happened.

4360
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:07,680
Oh no, it just, it just takes a while for it to, but it's like automatic, so you don't have to pay attention.

4361
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:08,500
Yeah, yeah, I know that part.

4362
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:10,920
But.

4363
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:14,560
Otherwise, I don't, we're not doing too bad.

4364
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:15,880
Whoa.

4365
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,160
I just have to shoot him in the head.

4366
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:18,660
Nothing to see again.

4367
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,260
Yeah, I think they're just going A over and over again.

4368
02:42:22,380 --> 02:42:23,580
Yeah, they're just going A over and over again.

4369
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:24,580
I do have turrets up.

4370
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,940
Oh wait, no, there's.

4371
02:42:26,060 --> 02:42:27,060
Oh no, they're going B.

4372
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:27,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4373
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:28,880
Oh, they saw me.

4374
02:42:29,060 --> 02:42:30,680
Ooh, just keep running, just keep running, just keep running.

4375
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:31,400
Help me, help me.

4376
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:32,940
I'm trying, I'm trying, we're trying.

4377
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:33,960
I'm throwing nades too.

4378
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:34,860
I might kill one here.

4379
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:37,340
Oh, I'm back here by yourself, careful.

4380
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:38,060
I killed one.

4381
02:42:38,060 --> 02:42:39,080
Nice, nice.

4382
02:42:39,140 --> 02:42:40,440
See if you can kill two, that'd be so awesome.

4383
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:43,140
Oh, they're on site.

4384
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:45,740
One's close as fuck on me.

4385
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:47,360
They're planting, they're planting.

4386
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:48,140
I don't have, I don't have, I don't have.

4387
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:48,520
One's on my ping.

4388
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:49,260
I don't even know where they are.

4389
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:51,120
One's on my ping.

4390
02:42:51,180 --> 02:42:52,860
Oh my god, they have walls here?

4391
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:53,340
Okay.

4392
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:54,940
Wait, he just hit me.

4393
02:42:55,060 --> 02:42:56,160
I'm not going to make it.

4394
02:42:56,620 --> 02:42:59,560
Yeah, I think he has the thing that lets him see through walls.

4395
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:02,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they have the upgrade that lets them see through the wall.

4396
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:02,780
Okay.

4397
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:04,900
Because I was going to say, like, how did he see me?

4398
02:43:11,310 --> 02:43:11,670
Um.

4399
02:43:12,590 --> 02:43:15,470
With how we're playing, flanking takes too long right now.

4400
02:43:15,690 --> 02:43:21,890
So, either we wait for the flank or, or we just, um, don't flank at all.

4401
02:43:23,350 --> 02:43:26,830
I've just been flanking because I'm usually leaning forward more than I am back.

4402
02:43:26,970 --> 02:43:28,770
So, it's like the fastest way for me to even get back.

4403
02:43:28,790 --> 02:43:29,970
I'll just play A now.

4404
02:43:30,810 --> 02:43:31,570
Wait for you guys.

4405
02:43:33,810 --> 02:43:35,130
Okay, I'll, I'll see.

4406
02:43:35,130 --> 02:43:35,910
Oh, let's see, let's see, let's see.

4407
02:43:35,910 --> 02:43:36,790
Oh my god.

4408
02:43:36,930 --> 02:43:37,030
Oh, see?

4409
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:38,750
Oh my god.

4410
02:43:39,070 --> 02:43:40,110
That was fast.

4411
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:40,510
That was fast.

4412
02:43:41,490 --> 02:43:42,410
Oh, they're going to come up.

4413
02:43:42,490 --> 02:43:43,370
They're going to come up on my ping.

4414
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:43,810
They're up C, they're up C.

4415
02:43:44,190 --> 02:43:44,730
Yeah, yeah.

4416
02:43:45,370 --> 02:43:46,190
Oh, we can't help them.

4417
02:43:46,310 --> 02:43:47,250
Yeah, I'm dead as fuck.

4418
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:55,130
I'm going to run in and see what happens.

4419
02:43:56,370 --> 02:43:57,790
There's people right in front of you guys.

4420
02:43:58,650 --> 02:43:58,930
Yep.

4421
02:43:59,290 --> 02:43:59,930
Let's go over there.

4422
02:44:01,150 --> 02:44:02,030
How do you do this?

4423
02:44:02,650 --> 02:44:03,490
Oh, we can try to kill them.

4424
02:44:03,810 --> 02:44:04,090
Yeah.

4425
02:44:04,770 --> 02:44:05,790
I'm looking to our right, right.

4426
02:44:06,150 --> 02:44:06,910
I'm out for you guys.

4427
02:44:07,870 --> 02:44:08,150
Bruh.

4428
02:44:08,610 --> 02:44:09,490
I hit one from 180.

4429
02:44:10,310 --> 02:44:12,890
I got, I got one, I got one.

4430
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:13,970
There's one more here.

4431
02:44:14,730 --> 02:44:15,810
One more on you.

4432
02:44:15,970 --> 02:44:16,410
Triforce.

4433
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:17,610
Behind you, behind you, behind you.

4434
02:44:18,190 --> 02:44:19,470
Oh no.

4435
02:44:28,810 --> 02:44:30,410
It's up to you.

4436
02:44:31,050 --> 02:44:31,830
Last one.

4437
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:35,390
Unlucky, unlucky.

4438
02:44:36,110 --> 02:44:37,090
Okay, two six.

4439
02:44:37,890 --> 02:44:38,530
Could be better.

4440
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:42,510
Maybe I don't, maybe I don't pick a sniper rifle.

4441
02:44:45,530 --> 02:44:47,890
They don't seem to let me be shooting them.

4442
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:49,310
They know.

4443
02:44:49,430 --> 02:44:51,270
They know you're the strongest sniper.

4444
02:44:52,110 --> 02:44:54,570
They're putting all the util on you.

4445
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:57,390
Yeah, I love you.

4446
02:44:57,470 --> 02:44:57,910
Good ball.

4447
02:44:58,370 --> 02:45:01,490
If you don't want to play a sniper, but yeah, you can play a sniper.

4448
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:02,570
I'm committed.

4449
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:03,670
You're committed?

4450
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:05,030
I fuck with that.

4451
02:45:06,310 --> 02:45:07,410
All it takes is one.

4452
02:45:07,770 --> 02:45:09,450
All it takes is one point.

4453
02:45:10,050 --> 02:45:10,290
That's all.

4454
02:45:10,290 --> 02:45:11,310
See, they have a sniper rifle too.

4455
02:45:12,970 --> 02:45:14,550
Yeah, because we're in defense.

4456
02:45:14,670 --> 02:45:15,170
What do you mean?

4457
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:16,810
They're on defense.

4458
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:18,050
They should be.

4459
02:45:18,270 --> 02:45:18,770
I need these.

4460
02:45:20,270 --> 02:45:21,390
Very grateful.

4461
02:45:21,630 --> 02:45:29,870
Bro, they threw like 16 bubbles, 5 of them reveal you, 5.6 of them blind you.

4462
02:45:30,210 --> 02:45:35,790
The worst part is like the third person makes it so I'm blind even though I'm in front of the fucking thing.

4463
02:45:36,890 --> 02:45:38,030
No, yeah, this game.

4464
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:39,650
This game, you just get like...

4465
02:45:40,110 --> 02:45:42,630
It's so hard to deal with if you don't have your own.

4466
02:45:45,170 --> 02:45:46,210
It's okay, sure, 4.

4467
02:45:46,430 --> 02:45:47,130
We can go...

4468
02:45:47,130 --> 02:45:48,390
You had those two kills.

4469
02:45:48,490 --> 02:45:49,550
That's all that matters.

4470
02:45:50,090 --> 02:45:52,370
Oh, you had that one kill and that's all that matters.

4471
02:45:52,650 --> 02:45:53,730
We can try going A as well.

4472
02:45:54,890 --> 02:46:01,390
The wall that they've been putting down is that they put their Ritchie in sewers and they throw the wall like to here.

4473
02:46:01,590 --> 02:46:01,850
Yeah.

4474
02:46:02,530 --> 02:46:04,890
All right, now it's your turn to do the same thing.

4475
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:07,670
Locking.

4476
02:46:14,430 --> 02:46:16,470
Oh, I guess not.

4477
02:46:17,690 --> 02:46:18,810
I guess not.

4478
02:46:19,150 --> 02:46:20,070
That was hard.

4479
02:46:20,410 --> 02:46:22,050
I guess we don't do that.

4480
02:46:22,570 --> 02:46:23,730
I guess we don't do that.

4481
02:46:23,850 --> 02:46:27,650
I think they knew our strat, guys.

4482
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:29,930
I think they knew our strat, guys.

4483
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:31,490
They knew, they knew, they knew.

4484
02:46:31,890 --> 02:46:33,230
They knew, they knew.

4485
02:46:33,230 --> 02:46:34,630
I think...

4486
02:46:35,490 --> 02:46:36,270
Okay, okay.

4487
02:46:38,790 --> 02:46:42,170
Maybe we should go another point because they think we're going to copy their strat.

4488
02:46:43,590 --> 02:46:44,210
Okay, let's go C.

4489
02:46:45,150 --> 02:46:47,850
So the C, the Ritchie wall, that's C.

4490
02:46:48,330 --> 02:46:50,170
You go sewers as well.

4491
02:46:50,830 --> 02:46:53,010
And you put your wall like here.

4492
02:46:53,190 --> 02:46:53,590
Or here.

4493
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:54,790
I think.

4494
02:46:54,910 --> 02:46:55,590
Oh, wait, is it?

4495
02:46:55,690 --> 02:46:55,950
Is it?

4496
02:46:56,190 --> 02:46:58,330
No, it's from here to here.

4497
02:46:58,870 --> 02:46:59,750
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

4498
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:00,550
We'll figure it out.

4499
02:47:00,670 --> 02:47:01,850
I believe in you, Mac.

4500
02:47:02,290 --> 02:47:03,870
Yeah, I've got a pretty good idea.

4501
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:04,350
Yeah.

4502
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:07,130
This guy knows how to make lines.

4503
02:47:07,210 --> 02:47:07,310
Yeah.

4504
02:47:07,670 --> 02:47:08,710
Oh, we need the bomb.

4505
02:47:08,730 --> 02:47:09,310
He goes to land.

4506
02:47:09,890 --> 02:47:10,550
Oh, we need the bomb.

4507
02:47:11,290 --> 02:47:12,150
Something like that.

4508
02:47:12,390 --> 02:47:13,630
I don't think we need the bomb.

4509
02:47:15,210 --> 02:47:16,190
What do you mean by that?

4510
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:18,230
We won't get to the point, it doesn't matter.

4511
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:20,330
Like, will we get to the point first?

4512
02:47:20,390 --> 02:47:21,730
Like, that's what I want to know.

4513
02:47:21,850 --> 02:47:23,130
I only hit the guy once, apparently.

4514
02:47:24,470 --> 02:47:25,370
Oh, you can put the wall down.

4515
02:47:26,430 --> 02:47:27,270
Yeah, split site.

4516
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:28,270
Yeah, nice.

4517
02:47:28,750 --> 02:47:29,530
Just go through.

4518
02:47:30,330 --> 02:47:31,250
Just play left side.

4519
02:47:31,250 --> 02:47:32,570
We need to get control of back site.

4520
02:47:32,970 --> 02:47:34,710
Yeah, can you watch my TP?

4521
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:37,850
What?

4522
02:47:39,210 --> 02:47:39,550
Nice.

4523
02:47:40,190 --> 02:47:41,170
Oh, I see someone over there.

4524
02:47:41,470 --> 02:47:42,790
In the room, in the room.

4525
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:44,150
Oh, there's someone on next.

4526
02:47:44,250 --> 02:47:44,870
There's someone on next.

4527
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:45,330
Yeah.

4528
02:47:47,370 --> 02:47:48,750
I'm going to look at our flank, just in case.

4529
02:47:49,150 --> 02:47:49,310
Oh, that's like three.

4530
02:47:49,470 --> 02:47:50,690
That's like three over there on my ping.

4531
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:51,850
Three?

4532
02:47:52,190 --> 02:47:52,590
Oh, well, shit.

4533
02:47:52,910 --> 02:47:53,770
Oh, shit!

4534
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:54,770
We have bomb down.

4535
02:47:55,450 --> 02:47:55,790
Behind us!

4536
02:47:55,970 --> 02:47:56,270
Behind us!

4537
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:56,670
Behind us!

4538
02:47:56,670 --> 02:47:57,250
Oh, one flank.

4539
02:47:57,310 --> 02:47:57,590
One flank.

4540
02:47:57,590 --> 02:48:02,250
Oh, guys, we have one more.

4541
02:48:02,350 --> 02:48:05,670
Guys, we get to play one more round, then we'll get to do the next map.

4542
02:48:06,450 --> 02:48:07,030
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4543
02:48:07,090 --> 02:48:08,350
No, what do you mean one more round?

4544
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:11,090
We got like 13, because we're going to win all the next ones.

4545
02:48:13,150 --> 02:48:14,310
Wait, can we have the...

4546
02:48:14,310 --> 02:48:17,810
Please don't make us wait too long for the next map.

4547
02:48:17,890 --> 02:48:18,790
I'm ready to go.

4548
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:19,270
Yeah, actually.

4549
02:48:19,770 --> 02:48:19,990
I'm ready.

4550
02:48:21,210 --> 02:48:22,690
What the fuck do you mean?

4551
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:23,970
Kill these guys!

4552
02:48:24,430 --> 02:48:25,130
Yeah, there you go.

4553
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:26,290
That's the passion we need.

4554
02:48:26,290 --> 02:48:29,350
No, as in like, I don't want to have an intermission.

4555
02:48:29,710 --> 02:48:31,070
That's what I mean.

4556
02:48:31,270 --> 02:48:32,930
You're already thinking about the next game.

4557
02:48:33,050 --> 02:48:34,470
We're in this game, Donkey Bird.

4558
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:36,190
We're in this game right here.

4559
02:48:36,430 --> 02:48:40,130
We still got six more rounds to go until we hit overtime and win the game.

4560
02:48:41,310 --> 02:48:43,470
I just don't want to wait in between intermission.

4561
02:48:43,570 --> 02:48:45,510
We've been waiting like 15 minutes for intermission.

4562
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:46,250
I agree.

4563
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:50,290
Let's go again.

4564
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:51,490
Let's try the same thing.

4565
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:52,630
Honestly, it kind of worked.

4566
02:48:53,370 --> 02:48:54,890
We just got flooded by people here.

4567
02:48:54,890 --> 02:48:56,510
They just pushed through smoke.

4568
02:48:56,590 --> 02:48:57,630
Oh, so I'm going to go in.

4569
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:59,250
Why didn't we push through smoke?

4570
02:49:00,110 --> 02:49:00,510
He's close.

4571
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:03,370
I hit him 160.

4572
02:49:03,790 --> 02:49:04,150
Nice.

4573
02:49:06,210 --> 02:49:07,170
He's on top of the box.

4574
02:49:07,430 --> 02:49:08,410
Yeah, you can put the wall down.

4575
02:49:08,650 --> 02:49:09,470
I'll watch for you.

4576
02:49:13,150 --> 02:49:14,670
He's going to try to catch you.

4577
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:18,490
Wait, I have the bomb.

4578
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:19,530
They're going CT.

4579
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:20,410
Okay.

4580
02:49:21,990 --> 02:49:22,990
Yeah, you have bomb.

4581
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:23,150
I'm planting.

4582
02:49:24,670 --> 02:49:26,090
Oh, there's a person there.

4583
02:49:26,090 --> 02:49:27,970
There's a person right here that's just jumping.

4584
02:49:28,210 --> 02:49:28,750
He's low.

4585
02:49:30,550 --> 02:49:33,290
I got one.

4586
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:34,390
Wait, wait, wait.

4587
02:49:34,410 --> 02:49:35,470
I broke that one's armor.

4588
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:36,570
Fuck me, man.

4589
02:49:36,710 --> 02:49:37,750
I don't have heals.

4590
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:38,230
Oh, fuck.

4591
02:49:39,310 --> 02:49:40,270
Careful, I don't have heals.

4592
02:49:40,470 --> 02:49:41,150
Oh, I'm just dead.

4593
02:49:42,070 --> 02:49:42,770
Oh, God.

4594
02:49:42,830 --> 02:49:44,150
They're going to flank again, aren't they?

4595
02:49:44,650 --> 02:49:45,190
No, they are.

4596
02:49:45,190 --> 02:49:46,050
How does that not hit?

4597
02:49:47,810 --> 02:49:48,650
I'm getting angry.

4598
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:51,150
This guy's trying to do jump shots on me, man.

4599
02:49:51,210 --> 02:49:51,890
They're doing trick shots on you.

4600
02:49:52,490 --> 02:49:54,830
They're actually doing trick shots.

4601
02:49:54,830 --> 02:49:55,590
Let's go, Ata.

4602
02:49:56,050 --> 02:49:56,730
Nice, nice.

4603
02:49:57,510 --> 02:49:58,930
I got blue stuff.

4604
02:49:59,610 --> 02:50:01,070
Oh, my God.

4605
02:50:02,310 --> 02:50:04,270
They actually did a trick shot.

4606
02:50:04,350 --> 02:50:05,270
I saw him.

4607
02:50:05,630 --> 02:50:06,630
Yeah, but they missed.

4608
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:07,190
They missed.

4609
02:50:07,330 --> 02:50:07,890
So, you won.

4610
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:09,430
You won that mental fight.

4611
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:11,130
You didn't get clipped, so...

4612
02:50:11,130 --> 02:50:12,390
They're not getting clipped.

4613
02:50:12,850 --> 02:50:14,570
They won't get a clip on me.

4614
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:18,090
You won the mental game here.

4615
02:50:18,750 --> 02:50:19,710
Bro, what does it say?

4616
02:50:19,770 --> 02:50:20,870
I only did 78 damage.

4617
02:50:20,930 --> 02:50:22,030
I broke so many shields.

4618
02:50:22,130 --> 02:50:23,230
Does shield not count as damage?

4619
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:26,150
I guess not.

4620
02:50:26,630 --> 02:50:28,250
That's your damage score.

4621
02:50:29,390 --> 02:50:31,170
You have 1800 damage.

4622
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:34,750
Okay, we're attack next game.

4623
02:50:35,090 --> 02:50:35,730
So, we should...

4624
02:50:35,730 --> 02:50:38,150
Are they swapping servers again?

4625
02:50:38,370 --> 02:50:39,170
What's going on?

4626
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:41,810
No, they're leaving so we can swap teams.

4627
02:50:45,070 --> 02:50:47,130
I was gonna say.

4628
02:50:47,830 --> 02:50:48,590
They can start now.

4629
02:50:48,950 --> 02:50:51,430
Why are you requesting to swap with me?

4630
02:50:51,810 --> 02:50:52,330
Ignored.

4631
02:50:52,370 --> 02:50:53,910
No, swap with Gengu.

4632
02:50:54,830 --> 02:50:56,790
No, I was getting requested by Alverelli.

4633
02:50:57,170 --> 02:50:59,070
I think he misclicked.

4634
02:50:59,830 --> 02:51:01,250
Why is there two...

4635
02:51:01,250 --> 02:51:02,090
Okay, I was gonna say.

4636
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:04,850
You can start now.

4637
02:51:05,550 --> 02:51:06,650
We're good for three.

4638
02:51:07,690 --> 02:51:08,430
Start now.

4639
02:51:08,430 --> 02:51:09,310
Hey, wake up!

4640
02:51:09,730 --> 02:51:10,990
Dude, I'm dying.

4641
02:51:11,390 --> 02:51:12,730
Wake the fuck up.

4642
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:13,410
Walk in.

4643
02:51:13,790 --> 02:51:14,650
Why are you dying?

4644
02:51:15,630 --> 02:51:16,110
I died.

4645
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:19,270
I started getting hit with a migraine in the middle of this round.

4646
02:51:19,570 --> 02:51:20,110
I'm dying.

4647
02:51:21,630 --> 02:51:22,330
Oh, no.

4648
02:51:22,670 --> 02:51:23,350
Oh, no.

4649
02:51:24,450 --> 02:51:27,030
Do I have to commit to the sniper rifle again?

4650
02:51:28,110 --> 02:51:30,430
Honestly, I think you lose if you don't commit to it.

4651
02:51:30,490 --> 02:51:31,450
So, I think you should commit to it.

4652
02:51:31,570 --> 02:51:35,270
You lose the war if you don't commit to it.

4653
02:51:35,330 --> 02:51:39,850
And you're trying to say that they made you swap off of sniper because you were weak.

4654
02:51:40,210 --> 02:51:41,450
You don't want to be weak.

4655
02:51:42,530 --> 02:51:44,410
You don't want to be weak, surefour.

4656
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:45,790
I'm hitting a 360.

4657
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:51,690
If I hit a 360 and headshot, I'm saying scrim this.

4658
02:51:54,630 --> 02:51:55,350
Scrim this.

4659
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:57,330
You're going to fucking...

4660
02:51:57,330 --> 02:51:58,970
Dude, I can't even see world chat.

4661
02:51:59,130 --> 02:51:59,690
They can't even...

4662
02:52:00,450 --> 02:52:02,590
There's no global chat in game.

4663
02:52:04,390 --> 02:52:05,130
No, there is.

4664
02:52:05,210 --> 02:52:06,930
If you hit enter, you can talk to the other team.

4665
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:08,330
Oh, we can talk to the other team?

4666
02:52:08,670 --> 02:52:08,870
Really?

4667
02:52:09,330 --> 02:52:12,090
If you hit enter and hit tab, you can talk to the other team.

4668
02:52:12,710 --> 02:52:13,590
In game, though?

4669
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:14,110
In game?

4670
02:52:14,150 --> 02:52:14,990
In game, yeah.

4671
02:52:15,690 --> 02:52:17,930
Okay, surefour, you have to hit that.

4672
02:52:19,610 --> 02:52:19,970
Gentlemen's...

4673
02:52:19,970 --> 02:52:21,230
Wait, how do you spell gentlemen?

4674
02:52:21,230 --> 02:52:23,410
Are you trying to say how to spell gentlemen?

4675
02:52:24,850 --> 02:52:26,210
No util.

4676
02:52:31,010 --> 02:52:31,910
No util.

4677
02:52:32,390 --> 02:52:34,050
Pure FPS skills.

4678
02:52:35,430 --> 02:52:39,850
I think that's a great idea.

4679
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:45,850
Test our pure FPS skills.

4680
02:52:46,270 --> 02:52:46,810
No util.

4681
02:52:46,810 --> 02:52:47,370
No util.

4682
02:52:50,390 --> 02:52:51,650
Guys, they didn't respond.

4683
02:52:51,750 --> 02:52:52,550
I got left on read.

4684
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:53,550
No, we didn't.

4685
02:52:56,810 --> 02:52:57,930
Like, no abilities?

4686
02:52:58,070 --> 02:52:59,070
Oh, yes.

4687
02:53:00,190 --> 02:53:01,190
No abilities.

4688
02:53:05,150 --> 02:53:07,050
Guys, I don't think they're going to...

4689
02:53:07,050 --> 02:53:07,990
They said they're down!

4690
02:53:08,450 --> 02:53:09,510
They said they're down!

4691
02:53:09,890 --> 02:53:11,430
Let's go!

4692
02:53:11,570 --> 02:53:11,890
Let's go!

4693
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:12,090
Let's go!

4694
02:53:12,490 --> 02:53:12,770
Let's go!

4695
02:53:15,290 --> 02:53:16,930
I can snipe now.

4696
02:53:19,290 --> 02:53:22,950
Okay, what is the best, like, character to do that?

4697
02:53:22,950 --> 02:53:24,250
This guy's trying to metagame.

4698
02:53:24,310 --> 02:53:24,910
What the fuck?

4699
02:53:25,690 --> 02:53:26,350
Of course he is.

4700
02:53:26,550 --> 02:53:27,410
We gotta beat them.

4701
02:53:29,270 --> 02:53:31,350
Okay, now that's pure FPS.

4702
02:53:31,570 --> 02:53:33,310
We gotta have guns that can do damage.

4703
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:34,790
Yeah, yeah.

4704
02:53:35,930 --> 02:53:37,530
Guys, but what if they lied to us?

4705
02:53:38,190 --> 02:53:39,730
What if they lied to us, guys?

4706
02:53:39,730 --> 02:53:42,110
If they lied, then what can you do?

4707
02:53:43,430 --> 02:53:43,790
No...

4708
02:53:45,290 --> 02:53:46,650
Smoke plus nade.

4709
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:50,530
Smoke, nade, and no ability, right?

4710
02:53:50,770 --> 02:53:51,850
Yeah, smoke plus nade.

4711
02:53:51,850 --> 02:53:53,090
Smoke, frag, and flashes.

4712
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:54,730
No abilities.

4713
02:53:56,830 --> 02:53:58,210
Only one util each.

4714
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:06,410
Just no... Okay, now we're playing tactical shooting.

4715
02:54:07,010 --> 02:54:09,430
Now we're playing the game.

4716
02:54:09,430 --> 02:54:11,690
Now we're playing a real game.

4717
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:14,590
Now we're playing a real game.

4718
02:54:16,850 --> 02:54:18,610
You can't scrim this.

4719
02:54:19,650 --> 02:54:21,590
Yeah, we're beating them with our...

4720
02:54:22,250 --> 02:54:25,710
On our pure FPS skills.

4721
02:54:26,110 --> 02:54:29,090
And before one of the admins say, guys, you're not allowed to do that.

4722
02:54:30,290 --> 02:54:31,150
Wait, wait, wait.

4723
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:33,530
If we actually do this, Abe, you should play Audrey.

4724
02:54:33,770 --> 02:54:35,430
She's the most gun character ever.

4725
02:54:36,250 --> 02:54:37,670
Wait, Max should play... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4726
02:54:37,670 --> 02:54:39,310
Because we don't need the wall anymore.

4727
02:54:40,610 --> 02:54:44,870
Dude, what if the casters can't read the chat and don't realize why no one's using abilities?

4728
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:48,990
What if someone uses an ability?

4729
02:54:50,850 --> 02:54:51,970
They die.

4730
02:54:51,970 --> 02:54:55,750
How the fuck did you throw a forfeit?

4731
02:55:00,170 --> 02:55:08,120
If you use ability, you stand in the middle of the zone and...

4732
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:20,850
And die in shame in front of everyone.

4733
02:55:24,810 --> 02:55:25,890
Oh, someone left.

4734
02:55:26,150 --> 02:55:26,730
Wait, why'd he leave?

4735
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:27,550
They're already scared.

4736
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:29,790
Yeah, he couldn't take our pure aura.

4737
02:55:31,450 --> 02:55:32,870
I got a spiritual pressure.

4738
02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:34,010
Alright.

4739
02:55:37,650 --> 02:55:38,530
They're gonna...

4740
02:55:38,530 --> 02:55:39,970
They're gonna...

4741
02:55:41,550 --> 02:55:42,590
They should let us.

4742
02:55:42,630 --> 02:55:43,350
There's no way.

4743
02:55:43,410 --> 02:55:45,670
There's no way they do this to us.

4744
02:55:49,640 --> 02:55:51,180
What the fuck are...

4745
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:53,580
Okay, there's no way they would do this to us.

4746
02:55:54,940 --> 02:55:56,580
Oh, they're gonna try to put...

4747
02:55:56,580 --> 02:56:00,360
Oh, they're trying to put a 3000 cooldown.

4748
02:56:01,240 --> 02:56:03,680
3000 second cooldown on the abilities.

4749
02:56:04,660 --> 02:56:07,000
That's not good enough because you can still use it once.

4750
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:08,020
Oh, that's true.

4751
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:08,540
That's true.

4752
02:56:09,340 --> 02:56:10,900
It's their fault if they use it once.

4753
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:12,480
That's cheating.

4754
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:13,720
True.

4755
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:15,980
Oh, yeah.

4756
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:17,420
Who has the best passive abilities?

4757
02:56:17,580 --> 02:56:18,580
Because, yeah, you can't...

4758
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:19,360
Oh, that's true.

4759
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:26,360
Okay, let's condition.

4760
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:28,560
Okay, I'm looking at the agents.

4761
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:30,480
What do we play for passive?

4762
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,260
I know who I'm playing.

4763
02:56:33,580 --> 02:56:34,200
Oh, Celestia.

4764
02:56:34,500 --> 02:56:37,540
Celestia, like, when she's around her teammates, she...

4765
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:38,300
She heals?

4766
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:39,560
Yeah, she regens.

4767
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:40,440
Okay, I'll play Celestia.

4768
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:44,160
And Audrey is a very good gun character.

4769
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:45,400
Yeah, I'll do Audrey.

4770
02:56:46,020 --> 02:56:47,380
What's Max doing, Audrey?

4771
02:56:48,300 --> 02:56:49,240
Oh, are they?

4772
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:49,900
Okay, my bad.

4773
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:50,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Max is doing...

4774
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:51,200
Audrey.

4775
02:56:51,620 --> 02:56:54,660
Yeah, Max has been practicing Audrey, yeah.

4776
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:58,020
My computer is blowing up, so...

4777
02:56:58,020 --> 02:57:00,120
Turn off Throne and Liberty, then.

4778
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:01,540
Dude, it's not open.

4779
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:03,200
I wish it was.

4780
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:10,820
All I have open is this game, my OBS, VTS, and Discord, and my RAM is actually maxed out.

4781
02:57:11,160 --> 02:57:12,760
No, Fuchsia's passive is also very good.

4782
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:13,860
Like, she kills the guy.

4783
02:57:13,940 --> 02:57:15,060
Oh, so then...

4784
02:57:15,060 --> 02:57:15,620
She heals, yeah.

4785
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:17,640
Next can save Fuchsia.

4786
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:18,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4787
02:57:19,700 --> 02:57:20,180
Alright.

4788
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:24,740
Michelle... Michelle just has a really good gun, so you can play her.

4789
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:26,960
Oh, I should just play Michelle?

4790
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:27,380
Okay.

4791
02:57:27,400 --> 02:57:28,260
Or you can play Celestia.

4792
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:29,540
I'll just play Michelle, then.

4793
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:31,120
I'll just keep going with Michelle.

4794
02:57:31,780 --> 02:57:33,440
Does my turret count as an ability?

4795
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:34,260
Yes.

4796
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:35,100
Oh, wait.

4797
02:57:35,380 --> 02:57:36,080
Wait, are we ready?

4798
02:57:36,280 --> 02:57:37,020
Team A, ready?

4799
02:57:37,240 --> 02:57:37,460
Yes.

4800
02:57:38,320 --> 02:57:39,900
Yes, we're ready.

4801
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:46,360
Alright, we all figured... No, no, only smoke... Remember to equip smokes and frags instead of...

4802
02:57:46,360 --> 02:57:47,540
Yeah, smokes and frags.

4803
02:57:47,540 --> 02:57:51,680
I swear to God, if they... If they fucking... I'm gonna fucking call them out.

4804
02:57:55,060 --> 02:57:56,280
Wait, A, ready up.

4805
02:57:56,740 --> 02:57:57,800
We can't start it.

4806
02:57:58,560 --> 02:57:59,600
You have to hurry up.

4807
02:58:00,120 --> 02:58:01,160
He's so out of it.

4808
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:02,040
He's not ready.

4809
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:03,860
He's not ready.

4810
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:06,440
He's so cooked right now.

4811
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:08,120
He's so cooked.

4812
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:11,400
There we go.

4813
02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:13,340
Dude, it's... It's bad.

4814
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:17,700
It's like I've got a hangover and now I'm cooked.

4815
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:20,140
Oh my God, he even lagged on Discord.

4816
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:21,280
Dude, no.

4817
02:58:21,320 --> 02:58:22,940
My computer's trying to kill itself.

4818
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:24,780
Oh my God.

4819
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:26,460
It's so over.

4820
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:27,920
Kill yourself, you're so sexy.

4821
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:30,480
Alright.

4822
02:58:30,620 --> 02:58:31,820
Oh yeah, remember to change...

4823
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:32,320
Smoke, frag.

4824
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:33,540
Smoke, frag.

4825
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:35,420
Smoke, smoke, frag.

4826
02:58:35,540 --> 02:58:35,640
Remember?

4827
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:36,200
Wait, no, Ava.

4828
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:37,040
I thought you were playing Andre.

4829
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:38,040
Am I?

4830
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:38,880
Oh yeah, you're right.

4831
02:58:39,560 --> 02:58:40,400
Oh my God.

4832
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:43,060
Alright.

4833
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:45,700
Alright, here we go.

4834
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:46,600
We're locked in.

4835
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:48,820
We'll see if everyone is proper role players or not.

4836
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:54,120
There's only one good option here in your loadout with smoke, frag.

4837
02:58:55,520 --> 02:58:56,820
And what is that option?

4838
02:58:57,180 --> 02:58:58,800
We're about to see if everyone picked it.

4839
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:02,020
Alright, let's see.

4840
02:59:02,320 --> 02:59:03,640
I'm rank one role player here.

4841
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:05,360
I have smoke, frag.

4842
02:59:05,960 --> 02:59:07,020
We'll see here.

4843
02:59:09,460 --> 02:59:11,140
Why did they pick that girl?

4844
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:13,460
Isn't that...

4845
02:59:13,460 --> 02:59:13,740
Okay.

4846
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,780
No, the pink girl.

4847
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:17,100
Isn't pink girl mostly util?

4848
02:59:17,900 --> 02:59:18,600
Yeah, she is.

4849
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:19,860
But her gun is also very good.

4850
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:20,900
Alright, who got a knife?

4851
02:59:21,140 --> 02:59:21,860
Who got their knife?

4852
02:59:23,280 --> 02:59:24,360
Oh, no knives.

4853
02:59:24,580 --> 02:59:25,660
Only me, huh?

4854
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:27,260
Only me, huh?

4855
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:28,280
I got a deagle.

4856
02:59:28,460 --> 02:59:29,220
I got the deagle, though.

4857
02:59:29,240 --> 02:59:30,160
Yeah, you got the deagle, yeah.

4858
02:59:30,200 --> 02:59:31,000
Yeah, I got the deagle.

4859
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:32,200
I'm fucking RPing.

4860
02:59:32,540 --> 02:59:34,240
Yeah, but you guys can't take your...

4861
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:35,580
I run faster with my knife.

4862
02:59:35,620 --> 02:59:36,460
You guys don't.

4863
02:59:36,460 --> 02:59:38,260
I don't think you do, actually.

4864
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:39,000
I do.

4865
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:40,800
It's RP.

4866
02:59:41,140 --> 02:59:41,680
It's RP.

4867
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:42,500
Let him RP.

4868
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:43,640
I'm sorry.

4869
02:59:43,740 --> 02:59:44,020
I'm sorry.

4870
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:44,380
Sine.

4871
02:59:45,360 --> 02:59:45,760
Castilla.

4872
02:59:46,400 --> 02:59:47,460
Wait, who has the bomb?

4873
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:50,220
Oh, next.

4874
02:59:50,320 --> 02:59:50,500
Next.

4875
02:59:50,580 --> 02:59:51,260
Okay, here we go.

4876
02:59:51,360 --> 02:59:51,880
Smoke, frag.

4877
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:54,260
This is all pure FPS skills right now.

4878
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:55,720
This is tactical shooting.

4879
02:59:56,300 --> 02:59:57,160
I don't know how to... Wait.

4880
02:59:57,380 --> 02:59:58,620
I think we're descending at B.

4881
02:59:58,740 --> 02:59:59,000
Fuck it.

4882
02:59:59,500 --> 02:59:59,720
Oh, fuck.

4883
02:59:59,720 --> 03:00:01,260
He just hard pushed my ass.

4884
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:02,680
I'm good.

4885
03:00:02,680 --> 03:00:04,240
Suppressing fire.

4886
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:06,060
Get him up.

4887
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:06,680
They're smoking.

4888
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:09,260
Wait.

4889
03:00:10,580 --> 03:00:11,680
I used my ability.

4890
03:00:11,780 --> 03:00:12,540
I'm about to swing the smoke.

4891
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:14,980
I used my ability.

4892
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:16,300
Wait.

4893
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:20,160
Why did no one pick me up, man?

4894
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:22,680
I literally died.

4895
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:23,740
I literally died.

4896
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:26,860
It was muscle memory.

4897
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:27,740
It was muscle memory.

4898
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:29,580
We had...

4899
03:00:29,580 --> 03:00:30,100
We...

4900
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:32,180
How do you type?

4901
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:33,860
Competition?

4902
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:35,180
Probably.

4903
03:00:37,140 --> 03:00:37,640
Teammate.

4904
03:00:38,600 --> 03:00:41,480
I'm ashamed of my teammates.

4905
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:42,720
Wait.

4906
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:45,020
It was a missed input.

4907
03:00:46,060 --> 03:00:47,060
Okay.

4908
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:51,960
Here we go.

4909
03:00:53,440 --> 03:00:56,620
We all stopped fighting just to execute.

4910
03:00:56,620 --> 03:00:56,780
I'm ashamed.

4911
03:01:00,860 --> 03:01:02,140
Here we go.

4912
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:03,720
Okay.

4913
03:01:04,100 --> 03:01:06,140
Here we go.

4914
03:01:06,200 --> 03:01:06,700
The bomb.

4915
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:07,080
Hold on.

4916
03:01:07,180 --> 03:01:07,760
I got it.

4917
03:01:07,900 --> 03:01:09,120
We don't need the bomb.

4918
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:11,000
We just need to fucking fight.

4919
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:13,020
I need it for comfort.

4920
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:15,340
Starts on swinging this shit.

4921
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:16,100
Yup.

4922
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:19,060
They're going to be flanking already.

4923
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:20,020
They're pushing hard.

4924
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:21,840
I'm looking at our flanks.

4925
03:01:22,140 --> 03:01:22,560
Flanking.

4926
03:01:22,560 --> 03:01:22,880
Flanking.

4927
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:25,360
Oh, we traded.

4928
03:01:25,840 --> 03:01:27,340
I'm just as good as you.

4929
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:29,060
Go back.

4930
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:31,500
I'm rezzing.

4931
03:01:32,060 --> 03:01:33,300
I'm just as good as this guy.

4932
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:34,160
I killed the flanker.

4933
03:01:34,440 --> 03:01:34,740
They're pushing me.

4934
03:01:36,980 --> 03:01:37,900
We're vibing.

4935
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:39,640
Wait, they're nading.

4936
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:41,840
Wait, we were not vibing.

4937
03:01:42,580 --> 03:01:43,080
Wait, yo.

4938
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:46,160
I think they rezzed.

4939
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:47,360
We were not vibing.

4940
03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:50,240
What the fuck happened?

4941
03:01:50,240 --> 03:01:50,420
What happened?

4942
03:01:51,320 --> 03:01:52,880
I body shot.

4943
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:54,800
It all came crashing down.

4944
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:56,920
I got a kill.

4945
03:01:57,280 --> 03:01:58,340
What happened?

4946
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:02,220
Oh my god.

4947
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:04,520
Guys, I...

4948
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:04,940
That's it.

4949
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:05,680
I'm going A.

4950
03:02:06,420 --> 03:02:07,020
Guys...

4951
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:09,040
I think it's just an A and go right now.

4952
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,580
I mean, Surefour can snipe through A.

4953
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:14,100
You know?

4954
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:15,600
Yeah.

4955
03:02:20,240 --> 03:02:21,160
I think you should...

4956
03:02:21,160 --> 03:02:24,020
I thought with pure skill, this would be a bit easier.

4957
03:02:24,220 --> 03:02:25,560
But like...

4958
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:27,140
It ended up being a little bit harder, guys.

4959
03:02:27,860 --> 03:02:29,940
They should have upped the sniper rifle damage.

4960
03:02:29,980 --> 03:02:30,800
So it's AWP damage.

4961
03:02:30,880 --> 03:02:32,180
One shot body shot all the time.

4962
03:02:32,400 --> 03:02:32,960
Wait, wait, wait.

4963
03:02:33,020 --> 03:02:33,500
Surefour, Surefour.

4964
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:35,280
If you get Awakening 1, you can...

4965
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:36,940
If you full charge, you one shot body shot.

4966
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:39,100
I... Oh, wait.

4967
03:02:39,840 --> 03:02:41,540
But Awakening doesn't exist in CS.

4968
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:43,620
True.

4969
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:45,680
Yeah, but it's automatic.

4970
03:02:45,900 --> 03:02:47,000
It's automatic, though.

4971
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:47,680
Behind, behind, behind.

4972
03:02:48,020 --> 03:02:50,180
Up on the building.

4973
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:51,740
I got a fucking knife.

4974
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:52,880
Wait.

4975
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:55,100
Oh my god.

4976
03:02:57,500 --> 03:02:58,380
Fuck it.

4977
03:02:58,540 --> 03:02:59,300
I'm swinging sight.

4978
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:01,220
No, he just destroys me.

4979
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:06,180
No, they have fucking crossfires, man.

4980
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:08,280
Bro, they're actually playing CS, bro.

4981
03:03:08,340 --> 03:03:08,800
What do you do?

4982
03:03:09,860 --> 03:03:11,780
Yeah, what do you do when they play CS?

4983
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:12,800
What do you do?

4984
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:16,940
Wait, we're not playing on their map, too.

4985
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:17,760
It's Dust2.

4986
03:03:18,680 --> 03:03:19,860
This is Dust2.

4987
03:03:20,620 --> 03:03:20,700
Cheaper.

4988
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:23,920
Cheaper.

4989
03:03:24,680 --> 03:03:28,500
You can't fucking go on that off angle to top left in Dust2.

4990
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:29,740
What the fuck is that?

4991
03:03:30,460 --> 03:03:32,760
Wait, maybe we're playing an old version of CS.

4992
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:34,560
Guys, I thought you guys were...

4993
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:36,440
Guys, I thought you guys were CS players.

4994
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:36,980
What happened?

4995
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:38,160
I'm not.

4996
03:03:38,360 --> 03:03:38,820
Fuck CS.

4997
03:03:38,820 --> 03:03:40,820
I play Valorant.

4998
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:46,580
That explains everything.

4999
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:51,060
They're obviously overconfident.

5000
03:03:51,180 --> 03:03:52,920
We just have to wait for their pushes.

5001
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:55,640
What if we all just rat in this room?

5002
03:03:55,840 --> 03:04:00,760
We all stay as paper form and see what happens.

5003
03:04:00,940 --> 03:04:02,060
Yeah, in that top right corner.

5004
03:04:02,060 --> 03:04:02,680
Right out there.

5005
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:04,600
I'll be looking.

5006
03:04:06,140 --> 03:04:08,300
This is a beautiful little spot.

5007
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:09,940
Yeah, this is...

5008
03:04:09,940 --> 03:04:10,920
I'm just...

5009
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:13,200
This is gonna work out.

5010
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:14,600
Wait, surefour...

5011
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:16,780
He's 1v1ing.

5012
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:18,920
Come here, Doki.

5013
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:20,140
Be a part of the cult.

5014
03:04:20,860 --> 03:04:20,980
Yeah.

5015
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:23,600
Goodbye, Surefour.

5016
03:04:23,960 --> 03:04:24,800
You lost your 1v1.

5017
03:04:24,980 --> 03:04:27,040
You lost your 1v1.

5018
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:29,800
You lost your 1v1, Surefour.

5019
03:04:30,220 --> 03:04:30,840
No, no, no.

5020
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:32,560
I re-peeked it because I wasn't a bitch.

5021
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:34,360
I re-peeked it because I wasn't a bitch.

5022
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:36,420
No, no.

5023
03:04:36,500 --> 03:04:38,580
I re-peeked it because I wasn't a bitch.

5024
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:40,560
Well, now you're a dead bitch.

5025
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:42,000
Yeah, now you're dead.

5026
03:04:42,640 --> 03:04:42,880
Hey.

5027
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:45,020
But I had no bitch, though.

5028
03:04:45,140 --> 03:04:46,840
I don't think they're gonna push up, guys.

5029
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:48,840
They will, 100%.

5030
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:50,680
If they're not bitches, they'll push up.

5031
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,720
Should we tell them to push up?

5032
03:04:54,460 --> 03:04:55,360
No, because they don't know.

5033
03:04:55,720 --> 03:04:56,840
That would be too obvious.

5034
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:57,840
Don't figure it out.

5035
03:04:59,900 --> 03:05:01,500
Guys, we have a minute left.

5036
03:05:01,900 --> 03:05:02,980
Guys, we have a minute left.

5037
03:05:02,980 --> 03:05:03,520
No, I don't know.

5038
03:05:04,660 --> 03:05:05,740
Get his ass.

5039
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:07,160
Get his ass.

5040
03:05:08,200 --> 03:05:08,480
Yeah!

5041
03:05:09,900 --> 03:05:10,380
Behind!

5042
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:12,940
Behind!

5043
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:17,300
It's winnable.

5044
03:05:21,500 --> 03:05:22,840
We got one.

5045
03:05:22,840 --> 03:05:23,720
We got one.

5046
03:05:23,920 --> 03:05:24,540
We got one.

5047
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:28,420
That poor guy.

5048
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,480
I re-peeked, I ain't no bitch.

5049
03:05:32,360 --> 03:05:33,520
I re-peeked, I ain't no bitch.

5050
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:36,120
Wait, I have an idea.

5051
03:05:36,240 --> 03:05:38,780
You guys all go there and I hide in a different area.

5052
03:05:39,060 --> 03:05:39,080
Wait, wait.

5053
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:40,600
What if we hide here?

5054
03:05:42,740 --> 03:05:44,120
Just right behind the pillar.

5055
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:46,860
Just right behind it.

5056
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:49,880
Wait, just come in from the right side so they don't see you going up.

5057
03:05:49,880 --> 03:05:50,980
What if I hide here?

5058
03:05:53,560 --> 03:05:54,420
He said nah.

5059
03:05:55,280 --> 03:05:57,420
I'm going to watch Surefour die again.

5060
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:59,160
I'm going to die again.

5061
03:06:00,520 --> 03:06:01,180
I don't give a fuck.

5062
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:02,480
Let's go, let's go.

5063
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:05,920
He's just trying to do his 1v1, but he's losing to it.

5064
03:06:06,100 --> 03:06:06,860
Wait, no.

5065
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:09,040
I didn't know I could pop up.

5066
03:06:09,300 --> 03:06:10,380
They don't know shit.

5067
03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:12,060
They don't know that there's three of us.

5068
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:14,420
There might be a little suspicious.

5069
03:06:14,560 --> 03:06:15,860
You could be up there?

5070
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:17,280
Surefour.

5071
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:18,440
We got to help him.

5072
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:20,640
We got to help him.

5073
03:06:21,400 --> 03:06:22,280
I'm smoking.

5074
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:26,200
I'm smoking and giving you every util I have.

5075
03:06:26,820 --> 03:06:28,080
I just need you to know that.

5076
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:30,300
I didn't even know you could go up there.

5077
03:06:31,280 --> 03:06:32,400
There's one coming my way.

5078
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:33,440
Peekaboo, bitch.

5079
03:06:34,600 --> 03:06:35,940
Yeah, I got you, bitch.

5080
03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:36,660
Wait, wait, wait.

5081
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:38,240
It's winnable.

5082
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:40,400
I'm right back in the spot.

5083
03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:43,620
I have ult.

5084
03:06:43,620 --> 03:06:47,810
Where is Rezzing?

5085
03:06:48,210 --> 03:06:48,670
Rezzing.

5086
03:06:48,790 --> 03:06:51,190
They don't fall for it twice.

5087
03:06:51,690 --> 03:06:51,770
Surely.

5088
03:06:53,050 --> 03:06:54,630
You went up first.

5089
03:06:55,210 --> 03:06:55,650
Peekaboo.

5090
03:06:56,370 --> 03:06:57,790
Oh my god.

5091
03:06:58,950 --> 03:07:00,130
There's one more.

5092
03:07:01,350 --> 03:07:02,270
No.

5093
03:07:02,910 --> 03:07:03,850
This is it.

5094
03:07:04,690 --> 03:07:05,150
1v2.

5095
03:07:05,910 --> 03:07:08,190
He's just third person peeking.

5096
03:07:10,570 --> 03:07:12,450
Wait, wait, wait.

5097
03:07:12,450 --> 03:07:13,290
SharePoint.

5098
03:07:17,630 --> 03:07:20,050
Are you okay, SharePoint?

5099
03:07:21,090 --> 03:07:22,490
All I need is one.

5100
03:07:22,630 --> 03:07:23,650
All I need is one shot.

5101
03:07:23,770 --> 03:07:24,250
That's it.

5102
03:07:26,170 --> 03:07:29,590
I think they're better CS players than us, guys.

5103
03:07:29,790 --> 03:07:32,150
They might be better CS players.

5104
03:07:32,170 --> 03:07:34,050
I have to hit a headshot, man.

5105
03:07:36,570 --> 03:07:39,430
The only kill the other sniper has is me.

5106
03:07:39,510 --> 03:07:40,090
Because I repeat.

5107
03:07:40,090 --> 03:07:41,290
Because I ain't no bitch.

5108
03:07:44,570 --> 03:07:45,690
Guys, I think that's Cope.

5109
03:07:45,810 --> 03:07:47,830
I think that's Coping right now.

5110
03:07:47,990 --> 03:07:49,090
I knew it was happening.

5111
03:07:49,310 --> 03:07:50,250
I just forgot.

5112
03:07:50,550 --> 03:07:52,090
Wait, surely they don't expect it again, right?

5113
03:07:52,590 --> 03:07:54,290
Surely they don't expect it again.

5114
03:07:54,510 --> 03:07:56,890
Yeah, they wouldn't be ready for me to be here again.

5115
03:07:57,350 --> 03:07:57,950
Come on.

5116
03:07:59,510 --> 03:08:00,390
There's no way.

5117
03:08:01,150 --> 03:08:01,810
Okay, let me know.

5118
03:08:02,010 --> 03:08:02,210
I'll say.

5119
03:08:02,610 --> 03:08:03,550
Surefour is good for one.

5120
03:08:03,890 --> 03:08:04,790
He's good for one.

5121
03:08:06,650 --> 03:08:08,230
Bro, they're not peeking!

5122
03:08:08,230 --> 03:08:08,770
They're not peeking!

5123
03:08:10,530 --> 03:08:12,310
I got CS Code!

5124
03:08:12,870 --> 03:08:13,250
It's fine.

5125
03:08:14,410 --> 03:08:14,930
There's one walking up.

5126
03:08:15,350 --> 03:08:16,870
There's one walking up.

5127
03:08:17,210 --> 03:08:18,470
He's not okay.

5128
03:08:20,530 --> 03:08:21,030
Nice.

5129
03:08:21,350 --> 03:08:21,930
Shoot his body.

5130
03:08:22,570 --> 03:08:23,310
Behind us.

5131
03:08:25,370 --> 03:08:26,730
I don't know where.

5132
03:08:26,890 --> 03:08:27,890
How did he get back?

5133
03:08:29,350 --> 03:08:30,390
Below me.

5134
03:08:31,370 --> 03:08:32,370
I got him.

5135
03:08:32,890 --> 03:08:33,530
I got one!

5136
03:08:34,690 --> 03:08:35,870
I got two!

5137
03:08:36,510 --> 03:08:40,470
I fucked up my nade.

5138
03:08:40,690 --> 03:08:42,630
I fucked up my nade.

5139
03:08:43,150 --> 03:08:43,830
Where are they?

5140
03:08:44,990 --> 03:08:46,030
They're under you.

5141
03:08:47,070 --> 03:08:47,710
360!

5142
03:08:50,170 --> 03:08:50,950
Surefour, please.

5143
03:08:51,250 --> 03:08:51,550
Wait.

5144
03:08:52,810 --> 03:08:53,650
One more.

5145
03:08:54,610 --> 03:08:55,570
Okay, Surefour, please.

5146
03:08:55,570 --> 03:08:55,750
Please.

5147
03:08:55,750 --> 03:08:56,790
Peek-a-pussy!

5148
03:08:57,610 --> 03:08:58,950
You're such a bitch!

5149
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:02,670
We did it!

5150
03:09:02,970 --> 03:09:03,930
We reached!

5151
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:14,470
I jumped down to finish him off and I did kill him.

5152
03:09:14,590 --> 03:09:15,630
You're supposed to float!

5153
03:09:15,810 --> 03:09:18,050
If you float, you don't die to fall damage!

5154
03:09:18,270 --> 03:09:18,910
Oh yeah, true.

5155
03:09:19,690 --> 03:09:21,890
Did anyone see that 360 though?

5156
03:09:22,090 --> 03:09:22,450
Yeah, I did.

5157
03:09:24,890 --> 03:09:25,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5158
03:09:25,790 --> 03:09:27,950
Guys, it was supposed to be pure skill.

5159
03:09:28,090 --> 03:09:29,050
Guys, what happened?

5160
03:09:29,550 --> 03:09:31,350
Hey, look.

5161
03:09:31,550 --> 03:09:32,830
Who's MVP right now?

5162
03:09:33,610 --> 03:09:34,050
Just saying.

5163
03:09:34,950 --> 03:09:35,470
For now.

5164
03:09:35,870 --> 03:09:36,310
For now.

5165
03:09:38,370 --> 03:09:39,050
What the fuck?

5166
03:09:40,570 --> 03:09:41,370
What are we doing?

5167
03:09:42,130 --> 03:09:42,690
Same thing?

5168
03:09:43,450 --> 03:09:45,530
I think they know now.

5169
03:09:45,530 --> 03:09:46,070
I'm a rat.

5170
03:09:47,030 --> 03:09:51,350
Oh dude, I'm dead.

5171
03:09:51,530 --> 03:09:53,070
No, no, no, no.

5172
03:09:53,650 --> 03:09:54,250
He's dead.

5173
03:09:54,430 --> 03:09:57,350
There's a stupid fucking fan there!

5174
03:09:57,710 --> 03:09:57,970
Resable.

5175
03:09:59,270 --> 03:10:00,330
I'll smoke.

5176
03:10:00,590 --> 03:10:02,230
I'll smoke and we'll cross and we'll go.

5177
03:10:02,610 --> 03:10:03,350
Resable.

5178
03:10:05,410 --> 03:10:07,690
I'm upscooting right now.

5179
03:10:10,030 --> 03:10:12,650
Oh, right here!

5180
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:14,370
And right behind us!

5181
03:10:14,470 --> 03:10:16,490
I just got fucking resed, bro.

5182
03:10:19,990 --> 03:10:21,030
I'm pinging.

5183
03:10:23,030 --> 03:10:24,250
It's up to you next.

5184
03:10:24,370 --> 03:10:24,830
You got this.

5185
03:10:24,950 --> 03:10:26,390
I got one.

5186
03:10:27,230 --> 03:10:29,710
Guys, we don't...

5187
03:10:29,710 --> 03:10:31,790
Why is there a fan there pushing my ass?

5188
03:10:32,090 --> 03:10:34,170
Because you can fly up there.

5189
03:10:36,630 --> 03:10:38,950
Guys, maybe we can get another round.

5190
03:10:38,950 --> 03:10:41,490
Triforce, you're not top frag anymore.

5191
03:10:41,730 --> 03:10:46,710
Triforce, you're not top frag anymore.

5192
03:10:48,110 --> 03:10:49,110
I'm top D's though.

5193
03:10:51,170 --> 03:10:53,270
I can see my bloomers right now.

5194
03:10:53,610 --> 03:10:54,290
Oh my god.

5195
03:10:55,590 --> 03:10:56,930
He has a dress on.

5196
03:11:00,230 --> 03:11:02,170
This is not even...

5197
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:03,950
We're not even using util either.

5198
03:11:04,270 --> 03:11:06,090
We're just going here.

5199
03:11:06,090 --> 03:11:08,890
Bro, we have to survive before we use util, man.

5200
03:11:11,630 --> 03:11:12,670
Smoke window.

5201
03:11:13,950 --> 03:11:14,890
Fuck him.

5202
03:11:16,230 --> 03:11:17,610
Wait, he's inside the smoke.

5203
03:11:18,850 --> 03:11:19,330
I killed him.

5204
03:11:19,370 --> 03:11:19,910
He's dead.

5205
03:11:21,890 --> 03:11:22,930
I thirsted.

5206
03:11:23,510 --> 03:11:24,390
Top mid on our left.

5207
03:11:24,590 --> 03:11:25,990
What is that angle?

5208
03:11:27,430 --> 03:11:27,950
What?

5209
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:33,090
Oh my god.

5210
03:11:33,090 --> 03:11:33,170
He's dead.

5211
03:11:35,170 --> 03:11:35,550
Winnable.

5212
03:11:36,710 --> 03:11:37,690
Next, they're pushing you.

5213
03:11:40,330 --> 03:11:42,730
Wait, you guys are dead?

5214
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:45,430
Yeah, you're dead too apparently.

5215
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:50,550
Let's have a good time.

5216
03:11:50,650 --> 03:11:51,530
We got him on the defense.

5217
03:11:52,490 --> 03:11:53,710
Make sure you switch your util.

5218
03:11:54,730 --> 03:11:57,410
Make sure you get your knife out.

5219
03:11:57,410 --> 03:11:57,970
Get the knife.

5220
03:12:00,310 --> 03:12:02,250
Do you guys want to go knife only?

5221
03:12:02,850 --> 03:12:03,490
Knife round.

5222
03:12:03,850 --> 03:12:06,730
First round.

5223
03:12:09,930 --> 03:12:10,790
Knife round.

5224
03:12:13,350 --> 03:12:14,470
Got my smoke.

5225
03:12:14,710 --> 03:12:15,770
Get your smoke and frag.

5226
03:12:15,890 --> 03:12:16,870
You have an interceptor.

5227
03:12:19,090 --> 03:12:19,610
Fuck.

5228
03:12:19,970 --> 03:12:21,970
If you have it, just don't use it.

5229
03:12:21,970 --> 03:12:22,950
True.

5230
03:12:22,970 --> 03:12:23,590
Yeah.

5231
03:12:25,050 --> 03:12:26,590
Alright, knife round.

5232
03:12:29,570 --> 03:12:32,930
Alright, I'm getting...

5233
03:12:34,350 --> 03:12:35,330
Knife mid.

5234
03:12:36,610 --> 03:12:37,790
Knife mid.

5235
03:12:38,190 --> 03:12:39,610
I'm getting the high ground.

5236
03:12:40,750 --> 03:12:41,190
Oh yeah, true.

5237
03:12:42,310 --> 03:12:45,210
Now we're playing actual tac shooters.

5238
03:12:45,990 --> 03:12:48,330
The roleplaying is so insane.

5239
03:12:49,850 --> 03:12:51,610
Is it two left click, one right click?

5240
03:12:51,990 --> 03:12:53,390
I don't know actually.

5241
03:12:53,610 --> 03:12:55,490
I don't know the meta for knifing in this game.

5242
03:13:01,950 --> 03:13:02,950
Alright, here we go.

5243
03:13:05,050 --> 03:13:06,670
Knife mid, knife mid, let's go.

5244
03:13:07,750 --> 03:13:08,270
Where are they?

5245
03:13:08,450 --> 03:13:09,550
They're not even mid!

5246
03:13:09,950 --> 03:13:10,730
Can we execute ethos?

5247
03:13:13,050 --> 03:13:13,250
Alright.

5248
03:13:13,530 --> 03:13:13,970
Where is he?

5249
03:13:15,390 --> 03:13:16,790
He's gotta be the first to die.

5250
03:13:16,790 --> 03:13:18,810
First to die, get him out, get him out.

5251
03:13:18,850 --> 03:13:20,790
Let's go, let's go.

5252
03:13:25,030 --> 03:13:26,690
Now we got the nuisance.

5253
03:13:27,170 --> 03:13:28,770
Now we knife round.

5254
03:13:29,330 --> 03:13:30,910
Left side, left side.

5255
03:13:31,130 --> 03:13:31,650
Get his ass.

5256
03:13:32,370 --> 03:13:33,050
There's both!

5257
03:13:34,610 --> 03:13:35,990
Look at him on the high ground.

5258
03:13:36,670 --> 03:13:37,310
Let's go!

5259
03:13:38,030 --> 03:13:39,470
There's one below.

5260
03:13:40,110 --> 03:13:41,150
He's so low, he's so low!

5261
03:13:41,770 --> 03:13:43,490
Hit your knives, hit your knives, let's go!

5262
03:13:43,490 --> 03:13:44,790
Right click!

5263
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:50,310
Let's go.

5264
03:13:50,690 --> 03:13:51,750
And that's how we knife round.

5265
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:52,830
Surely we went out now.

5266
03:13:54,250 --> 03:13:56,730
Now we win every game after that, right?

5267
03:14:01,450 --> 03:14:04,130
Alright, that's the motivation we needed.

5268
03:14:04,730 --> 03:14:05,770
Back to normal.

5269
03:14:06,530 --> 03:14:10,050
Let's tag B because honestly, I don't think we can hold even a single point.

5270
03:14:10,250 --> 03:14:11,190
Dude, I'm eager to push.

5271
03:14:13,770 --> 03:14:15,790
You can't ego push your sniper!

5272
03:14:17,250 --> 03:14:18,590
That's exactly why he can't.

5273
03:14:18,650 --> 03:14:19,630
That's a forward pusher.

5274
03:14:23,810 --> 03:14:24,990
This is the comeback.

5275
03:14:25,310 --> 03:14:26,090
This is it, I believe.

5276
03:14:27,990 --> 03:14:29,970
I'm gonna smoke and sit in it with my sword.

5277
03:14:31,030 --> 03:14:32,050
That's so real.

5278
03:14:32,130 --> 03:14:33,710
Wait, what if we just keep throwing smokes down?

5279
03:14:33,870 --> 03:14:35,870
Okay, I think they went A.

5280
03:14:36,310 --> 03:14:37,090
Oh, they went A.

5281
03:14:38,410 --> 03:14:39,450
They have no idea.

5282
03:14:40,070 --> 03:14:41,410
One just flew top.

5283
03:14:41,690 --> 03:14:45,650
He randomly papered at the perfect moment.

5284
03:14:45,930 --> 03:14:49,710
He just knows.

5285
03:14:51,290 --> 03:14:52,390
Ow, get out.

5286
03:14:56,640 --> 03:14:58,400
Is there somebody back here?

5287
03:14:58,880 --> 03:14:59,440
I got one.

5288
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:02,420
On me, there's one knocked.

5289
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:04,320
Oh shit!

5290
03:15:04,960 --> 03:15:05,500
Can you rez me?

5291
03:15:06,280 --> 03:15:07,480
I just saw him.

5292
03:15:07,580 --> 03:15:08,880
I literally just saw him.

5293
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:11,600
That shit was scary.

5294
03:15:13,240 --> 03:15:15,020
I'm getting this, motherfucker.

5295
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:16,040
Did you get him?

5296
03:15:17,660 --> 03:15:18,140
No.

5297
03:15:19,100 --> 03:15:21,860
He's just sitting there, paper marbling my ass.

5298
03:15:24,360 --> 03:15:26,100
Oh my god, he's coming with the knife!

5299
03:15:28,320 --> 03:15:29,960
What do you do?

5300
03:15:30,940 --> 03:15:32,060
Guys, this is it.

5301
03:15:32,240 --> 03:15:34,700
This is the comeback right here, right guys?

5302
03:15:34,860 --> 03:15:35,280
This is it.

5303
03:15:35,280 --> 03:15:36,680
This is the one.

5304
03:15:36,920 --> 03:15:37,820
Guys, this is it.

5305
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:39,980
This is where it turns around.

5306
03:15:40,060 --> 03:15:41,140
What did he go A again?

5307
03:15:41,820 --> 03:15:42,680
My name is Deez.

5308
03:15:43,240 --> 03:15:44,840
Funnily enough, my headache's gone away.

5309
03:15:45,580 --> 03:15:49,360
All I'm saying is that we got the mental win.

5310
03:15:50,020 --> 03:15:51,440
We won knife round.

5311
03:15:51,440 --> 03:15:54,860
Motherfucker, you were saying, I hope there's not an intermission last game.

5312
03:15:55,140 --> 03:15:56,460
Before it was even over!

5313
03:16:02,120 --> 03:16:03,280
What did he go B?

5314
03:16:04,420 --> 03:16:05,900
Wait, wait, you're so wrong.

5315
03:16:05,900 --> 03:16:07,860
What angle is that one, guys?

5316
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:08,860
I'm gonna rat.

5317
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:12,060
They'll just be like, where is this guy?

5318
03:16:12,960 --> 03:16:14,300
Guys, I think...

5319
03:16:14,300 --> 03:16:17,380
This is the fucking dirtiest head peek ever!

5320
03:16:18,020 --> 03:16:18,700
Oh, they're A.

5321
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:19,060
They're coming A.

5322
03:16:19,380 --> 03:16:20,380
They're coming A.

5323
03:16:21,300 --> 03:16:24,460
They're coming A.

5324
03:16:24,460 --> 03:16:25,360
Go back, go back, go back.

5325
03:16:25,960 --> 03:16:27,880
B to mid, B to mid, B to mid, B to mid.

5326
03:16:28,060 --> 03:16:28,680
They're here, they're here.

5327
03:16:28,940 --> 03:16:30,940
Run away, run away, get ready.

5328
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,920
Go, go, go, go, go!

5329
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:35,980
Did he jump off?

5330
03:16:36,260 --> 03:16:37,140
Did he jump off?

5331
03:16:37,280 --> 03:16:38,340
Did I just saw him jump off?

5332
03:16:38,600 --> 03:16:39,360
Nex killed himself.

5333
03:16:40,740 --> 03:16:41,560
Nex killed himself.

5334
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:42,800
They told me to get out.

5335
03:16:44,140 --> 03:16:45,480
WHAT I DID?

5336
03:16:47,020 --> 03:16:47,820
Oh my...

5337
03:16:49,290 --> 03:16:51,190
Did we even jump off?

5338
03:16:51,870 --> 03:16:52,670
Oh my...

5339
03:16:53,630 --> 03:16:54,110
NOOOOOO!

5340
03:16:54,770 --> 03:16:57,050
They told me to kill myself, so I did.

5341
03:17:03,070 --> 03:17:05,850
That poor guy on the roof just got jumped.

5342
03:17:05,890 --> 03:17:06,870
We got two rounds.

5343
03:17:07,350 --> 03:17:08,770
We got two rounds.

5344
03:17:08,950 --> 03:17:09,610
We got two rounds.

5345
03:17:10,010 --> 03:17:11,970
Combined total of four rounds, guys.

5346
03:17:12,250 --> 03:17:13,470
Guys, we did it, guys.

5347
03:17:13,510 --> 03:17:14,790
That's a dub, that's a dub.

5348
03:17:16,110 --> 03:17:18,470
Did you get your 360 headshot?

5349
03:17:18,590 --> 03:17:19,250
Did you get it?

5350
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:21,090
I got a 360 body shot, though.

5351
03:17:21,110 --> 03:17:23,310
Oh god, I don't know what you were going to say.

5352
03:17:23,570 --> 03:17:24,930
Were you going to say something in chat?

5353
03:17:25,850 --> 03:17:27,670
Well, I didn't get the headshot, so I can't say it.

5354
03:17:31,970 --> 03:17:36,310
Dude, they fucking kicked me!

5355
03:17:41,130 --> 03:17:42,110
Is that it?

5356
03:17:43,310 --> 03:17:43,830
That's it.

5357
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:45,510
They even kicked us out of the lobby.

5358
03:17:45,510 --> 03:17:45,670
We're free.

5359
03:17:46,090 --> 03:17:48,330
I don't think we're Day 2.

5360
03:17:48,770 --> 03:17:51,190
I think we had to win to get Day 2.

5361
03:17:51,730 --> 03:17:52,530
So we're free.

5362
03:17:53,210 --> 03:17:54,930
Yeah, we're free until Day 2.

5363
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:56,530
Wait, no.

5364
03:17:57,090 --> 03:17:58,850
Doki's trying to say we don't get a Day 2.

5365
03:17:58,870 --> 03:18:00,070
Did we not get a Day 2?

5366
03:18:00,170 --> 03:18:08,610
No, we're getting into Day 2 because we beat the other team 2-0 and they didn't win a single game until...

5367
03:18:08,610 --> 03:18:10,770
Oh, so it grabs two teams.

5368
03:18:12,130 --> 03:18:13,250
Alright, guys.

5369
03:18:14,190 --> 03:18:14,790
GG's.

5370
03:18:14,870 --> 03:18:17,330
Can we replace our 6 with our sub?

5371
03:18:17,630 --> 03:18:18,690
Our 5th, sorry.

5372
03:18:21,850 --> 03:18:23,390
We have the chemistry.

5373
03:18:23,970 --> 03:18:26,690
We can't ruin the chemistry now.

5374
03:18:26,890 --> 03:18:27,710
Exactly, yeah.

5375
03:18:28,270 --> 03:18:30,730
Yeah, we have the chemistry going.

5376
03:18:31,650 --> 03:18:34,330
It'd be weird to lose the IGL.

5377
03:18:34,410 --> 03:18:36,170
Maybe I don't play Sniper every time.

5378
03:18:36,410 --> 03:18:36,990
Maybe, sure.

5379
03:18:37,610 --> 03:18:41,730
If you guys ever want to practice...

5380
03:18:41,730 --> 03:18:43,230
I'll see you on Day 2.

5381
03:18:43,350 --> 03:18:44,630
I'll see you on...

5382
03:18:50,390 --> 03:18:52,150
I'll see you on Day 2.

5383
03:18:52,230 --> 03:18:54,350
And I think Surefour's going to be on Deadlock anyway.

5384
03:18:54,850 --> 03:18:55,330
Oh, yeah.

5385
03:18:56,510 --> 03:18:57,130
That's fine.

5386
03:18:57,230 --> 03:18:57,750
I respect that.

5387
03:19:01,090 --> 03:19:01,890
Alright, GG's.

5388
03:19:01,890 --> 03:19:03,070
I had a great time, though.

5389
03:19:03,350 --> 03:19:04,410
I had a great time.

5390
03:19:04,650 --> 03:19:05,350
Thanks, guys.

5391
03:19:05,530 --> 03:19:06,930
Thanks for joining my team.

5392
03:19:07,830 --> 03:19:09,210
Surefour, can I get unbanned?

5393
03:19:09,210 --> 03:19:10,730
I don't want to type while you play Deadlock.

5394
03:19:10,830 --> 03:19:13,210
I'm such a big fan.

5395
03:19:16,670 --> 03:19:19,250
Surefour, give me mod or I'm modding you on my channel.

5396
03:19:19,710 --> 03:19:20,970
You already got it back, bitch.

5397
03:19:20,990 --> 03:19:21,690
Oh, did I?

5398
03:19:22,330 --> 03:19:23,870
Yeah, you ain't even paying attention.

5399
03:19:24,190 --> 03:19:27,510
I didn't know I was in a game with you.

5400
03:19:27,910 --> 03:19:29,270
I'm slick with it.

5401
03:19:31,710 --> 03:19:32,590
Thank you.

5402
03:19:32,650 --> 03:19:33,570
Thank you.

5403
03:19:34,390 --> 03:19:36,890
Guys, I got my mod powers back.

5404
03:19:39,450 --> 03:19:40,910
I'll pay $10.

5405
03:19:41,450 --> 03:19:42,810
Bro, you weren't even followed.

5406
03:19:42,910 --> 03:19:43,710
You're staying banned.

5407
03:19:44,850 --> 03:19:47,050
I followed instantly, man.

5408
03:19:47,110 --> 03:19:47,750
Come on.

5409
03:19:47,890 --> 03:19:50,670
You should've followed before I clicked that.

5410
03:19:50,910 --> 03:19:51,410
Not following.

5411
03:19:57,930 --> 03:19:59,010
GG's, everybody.

5412
03:19:59,090 --> 03:20:00,130
Click my link.

5413
03:20:00,310 --> 03:20:02,190
I had a great time.

5414
03:20:02,190 --> 03:20:03,670
I'm telling my shit.

5415
03:20:04,290 --> 03:20:04,690
Boom.

5416
03:20:05,290 --> 03:20:05,870
Overruled.

5417
03:20:07,150 --> 03:20:09,570
I had a great time, everybody.

5418
03:20:09,710 --> 03:20:11,790
I'll see you guys on day 2.

5419
03:20:12,370 --> 03:20:12,870
GG's, guys.

5420
03:20:12,870 --> 03:20:14,230
I'll see you guys on day 2.

5421
03:20:14,270 --> 03:20:14,850
Maybe I won't.

5422
03:20:14,890 --> 03:20:16,810
I actually don't know if they're going to replace me.

5423
03:20:17,550 --> 03:20:18,330
We'll find out.

5424
03:20:18,630 --> 03:20:20,730
We'll find out on day 2.

5425
03:20:22,190 --> 03:20:23,410
Bye-bye, guys.

5426
03:20:23,510 --> 03:20:23,890
Bye.

5427
03:20:25,330 --> 03:20:25,950
Oh, my God.

5428
03:20:25,950 --> 03:20:26,810
That was really fun.

5429
03:20:27,050 --> 03:20:28,610
I had a great time, guys.

5430
03:20:28,730 --> 03:20:30,210
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

5431
03:20:30,610 --> 03:20:33,910
Guys, there was no...

5432
03:20:33,910 --> 03:20:35,450
We tried to make the best...

5433
03:20:35,450 --> 03:20:37,210
Guys, we tried to...

5434
03:20:37,690 --> 03:20:38,810
Make it...

5435
03:20:38,810 --> 03:20:41,050
The best of it...

5436
03:20:41,710 --> 03:20:44,250
Guys, that team...

5437
03:20:44,250 --> 03:20:46,670
Has been playing on the CN server...

5438
03:20:46,670 --> 03:20:47,430
Since the beginning.

5439
03:20:47,670 --> 03:20:49,210
They've been screaming, guys.

5440
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:52,190
We tried the best...

5441
03:20:52,190 --> 03:20:53,150
We could...

5442
03:20:53,150 --> 03:20:54,550
With our pure skill.

5443
03:20:55,490 --> 03:20:58,430
Guys, we got the knife round.

5444
03:20:58,590 --> 03:21:00,130
And by getting the knife round...

5445
03:21:00,590 --> 03:21:02,130
That means we won the war.

5446
03:21:02,130 --> 03:21:02,670
Okay.

5447
03:21:03,070 --> 03:21:05,650
Knife round was the pure skill round.

5448
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:12,240
Actually...

5449
03:21:12,240 --> 03:21:14,320
We got content.

5450
03:21:14,620 --> 03:21:16,580
And that's all that matters.

5451
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:18,060
We got content.

5452
03:21:18,760 --> 03:21:19,940
But that was really fun.

5453
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:21,580
I had a great time with my team.

5454
03:21:22,240 --> 03:21:24,480
I had a great time with our team.

5455
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:26,160
And I had...

5456
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:27,120
It was really great.

5457
03:21:27,260 --> 03:21:30,840
Huge shout-out to Stranova for sponsoring me and giving me the captain slot.

5458
03:21:31,240 --> 03:21:33,640
I loved all my teammates that played with me today.

5459
03:21:33,640 --> 03:21:36,160
They were all incredibly fun to play with.

5460
03:21:36,240 --> 03:21:37,300
Great banter.

5461
03:21:37,740 --> 03:21:39,220
Great comms.

5462
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:40,900
Great pure skill.

5463
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:42,700
Going on in there.

5464
03:21:44,920 --> 03:21:46,960
I can't believe...

5465
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:49,040
I can't believe we were like...

5466
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:49,900
Pure skill.

5467
03:21:50,680 --> 03:21:53,500
If we didn't win the knife round...

5468
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:57,400
We could've done even worse than the round.

5469
03:21:57,400 --> 03:21:59,450
With the YouTube...

5470
03:22:00,760 --> 03:22:01,660
It's okay.

5471
03:22:01,860 --> 03:22:03,700
But we won the knife round though.

5472
03:22:03,780 --> 03:22:05,460
We won the knife round, guys.

5473
03:22:06,340 --> 03:22:06,880
Anyway...

5474
03:22:07,400 --> 03:22:09,720
Please, if you want to support me and the stream...

5475
03:22:09,720 --> 03:22:11,760
Please check out the link that's in my description.

5476
03:22:12,300 --> 03:22:13,980
And also pinned on my chat.

5477
03:22:14,600 --> 03:22:15,540
So, yeah.

5478
03:22:15,660 --> 03:22:16,380
Click on that link.

5479
03:22:16,460 --> 03:22:19,820
It really does help the stream and the channel.

5480
03:22:20,260 --> 03:22:21,720
Regarding future sponsorships.

5481
03:22:21,900 --> 03:22:23,360
And future strong sponsorships.

5482
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:24,100
So, yeah.

5483
03:22:24,100 --> 03:22:26,120
Click on the link for us.

5484
03:22:26,500 --> 03:22:27,740
But yes, thank you again.

5485
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:29,700
Thank you again to all my teammates.

5486
03:22:29,960 --> 03:22:30,820
For playing with us.

5487
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:34,500
Anyway, I will not be streaming for the next two days.

5488
03:22:34,640 --> 03:22:35,900
Because my voice is dying.

5489
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:38,380
Not dying, but like...

5490
03:22:38,380 --> 03:22:39,180
I need a rest.

5491
03:22:39,280 --> 03:22:40,300
I've been coughing a lot.

5492
03:22:40,720 --> 03:22:42,000
I won't say my voice is dying.

5493
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:43,840
I'm just still sick, so I'm still coughing.

5494
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:45,960
So...

5495
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:46,680
Anyway, guys.

5496
03:22:47,080 --> 03:22:48,340
Thank you everybody for coming.

5497
03:22:48,600 --> 03:22:49,640
Also, happy birthday.

5498
03:22:49,640 --> 03:22:50,200
Oh my gosh.

5499
03:22:50,540 --> 03:22:52,120
I didn't forget.

5500
03:22:53,540 --> 03:22:55,740
I'm sorry, I couldn't say happy birthday earlier.

5501
03:22:57,040 --> 03:22:58,620
Because I was in the middle of the game.

5502
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:01,240
Who was it?

5503
03:23:02,260 --> 03:23:03,380
Happy birthday!

5504
03:23:03,880 --> 03:23:05,580
Happy birthday to you.

5505
03:23:05,860 --> 03:23:07,260
Happy birthday to you.

5506
03:23:07,520 --> 03:23:08,960
Happy birthday dear Emo.

5507
03:23:09,460 --> 03:23:10,660
Happy birthday to you.

5508
03:23:11,300 --> 03:23:13,080
I'm so sorry if I pronounced your name wrong.

5509
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:14,560
This happens a lot.

5510
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:16,980
But yes, I didn't forget.

5511
03:23:16,980 --> 03:23:18,120
Happy birthday!

5512
03:23:20,560 --> 03:23:20,940
So...

5513
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:24,080
I hope you guys all had a great time watching.

5514
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:25,820
As always, everybody.

5515
03:23:25,960 --> 03:23:27,120
Stay hydrated, posh.

5516
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:28,620
Check it out and move around to get that blood flowing.

5517
03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:30,000
And you stay up for me a bit.

5518
03:23:30,120 --> 03:23:31,220
Because you deserve it.

5519
03:23:31,420 --> 03:23:33,860
I'll be doing day two, so that's not tomorrow.

5520
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:34,680
That's next week.

5521
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:36,040
See you guys next time, everybody.

5522
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:36,800
Bye, guys.

5523
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:38,220
Bye!
