00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,130
Hello, good morning everybody.

2
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,070
Sorry, we loot because I wanted to put on the pilot hat.

3
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,680
Sorry, the only reason why we loot was I was like, oh my
god, I should put on a hat.

4
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,700
And I was trying to find a hat.

5
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,780
I was trying to find for the immersion.

6
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,260
I was trying to find a hat.

7
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:27,020
looped today it's important the hat was so important you
guys don't understand how can i be a real pilot if i don't

8
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:38,400
have the hat also oh my god lemo thank you for the 50 gifted
chips thank you thank you guys i'm so incredibly tired i'm

9
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,940
so i i i i was like i could do 11 30 it's Just like 12.30,
but like an hour earlier.

10
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,520
And then I woke up at 11.15 and I was like realizing it's
not like 12.30.

11
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,520
I woke up like, oh, it's not like 12.30.

12
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,080
It's why it's so much worse.

13
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:28,620
um so so good morning everybody good morning the reason why
the reason why my stream is an hour earlier is uh because um

14
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,920
i'd have a meeting with youtube uh i was originally had a
meeting with youtube to just like be like welcoming me on

15
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,000
youtube or like welcoming me back on youtube

16
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:53,400
to meet with like the youtube people like maybe like a month
ago but then because of uh daylight savings the meeting got

17
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:01,180
like scuffed like like it got really scuffed so we had to
postpone it because like we weren't able to attend the

18
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,500
meeting because of daylight savings a month ago and now like
our schedule is lined up our schedule is finally lined up

19
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:17,820
today so i was like it was debate i was like do i do them do
i do this street i didn't miss it i didn't miss it our

20
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:25,000
meetings got like super scuffed up okay i'm just gonna say
it was daylight savings time but i didn't miss it we just

21
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,200
had to reschedule it so uh we had to reschedule it to and uh
today's the day i get to meet mr youtube himself oh my god a

22
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:46,980
real person i think like one of the funniest like first uh
the the first email we got from YouTube was like hello I'm a

23
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:59,860
real person I remember like I remember like when manager
sent me like the email it was like oh hey YouTube wants to

24
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:10,820
meet you and then like I think like the first or second
sentence was like hi I'm a real person but I really I like

25
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:19,260
the the our youtube guy he's really nice um because like i
had issues i don't know if i told you guys but like the

26
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:26,460
second channel thing was solved like uh my twitch my twitch
vlogs channel there was an issue with my twitch vlogs

27
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,620
channel um did i would i tell this in the members i told
this in the members right okay did i tell this in the

28
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:41,080
members or members yes i told this in the member it's
because i i leaked something in the members um so So for

29
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:50,580
those who are not in the members, in the member stream, what
happened was that my Twitch VODs channel, look, everything

30
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,940
like blurs together, like my entire life has been like
stream, like I feel like, like a lot, I feel like majority

31
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,120
of my brain space has just been like filled up with
streaming stuff that I don't know what is what anymore.

32
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,040
I don't know.

33
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,020
I was like, did I say this in the members?

34
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,300
Did I say this in my past channel?

35
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,440
Did I say this in my current channel?

36
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,200
said and I say this is my past channels members I can't
remember there's too many things to take into account now

37
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:30,220
it's getting more complicated it's getting so much more
complicated now so so anyway basically what happened for

38
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,580
those who are like super confused and are like oh what
happened basically my twitch VODs channel effort what I it

39
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,560
was like it succeeded in like ads yet i still need like i
think like 30 more out watch time 30 more hours of watch

40
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:53,680
time hint hint uh to get to be able to monetize via ads but
i could turn on super chats and members in my second twitch

41
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,100
sorry my second youtube channel which i won't do because i
think that's a little stupid because it's the vod's channel

42
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,880
um but i wanted to like make sure my uh make sure it's
already approved for monetization already so like just to be

43
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:17,440
like just to do it in advance and um And then, so I applied
for modernization on my Twitch VODs, my, my VODs channel.

44
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,920
And then I, and then I got rejected.

45
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,520
And I was like, what?

46
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,800
I was like, what?

47
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,620
Why did I get rejected?

48
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,960
It's, it's a VODs channel.

49
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,860
So I looked at the requirements.

50
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,240
And then the requirements was like, and they're like, why
did they reject me?

51
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,820
And then apparently one of them was that they didn't.

52
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,100
didn't know if it was me or it was like an impersonation or
something like they thought like oh somebody was in might

53
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,660
might be impersonating me and they're like oh if you're
gonna re-upload somebody else's content you gotta make sure

54
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,260
it has like different things on there like you gotta make it
your own you gotta edit in a way that's your own and i was

55
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:08,380
like what the fuck so so they're like okay if you want to
send an appeal prove that this is you and so i was like okay

56
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:16,520
i'm gonna i guess because i monetize VODs channel due to
like my experiences my previous experiences I know you can

57
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:27,000
monetize like VODs channel so that's like okay um I'm I
basically what I leaked was the video I sent the has to be

58
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,460
transformed it it was like the video I sent um uh I sent in
the members so like I let the members hear what I said and

59
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:45,700
then and so like I made a video I have to make it unlisted
and being like hi um this is me this is my channel here's my

60
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:54,120
main channel and here's my twitch channel so like you could
tell this is me and then like i sent that in i was like

61
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,980
here's all the like i is me i'm dokey bird this is all me
and then i sent it in and then they rejected it and was like

62
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:13,820
we don't we're like we don't know if it's you and i was like
what do you mean you don't know if it's me like I literally

63
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:23,860
said it's me what do you mean it's not me and so like they
rejected the appeal and then I had to email my YouTube guy I

64
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:32,100
was like what the fuck is going I was like I was like why
did they reject me it's me and my YouTube guy like got like

65
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:39,900
was like don't worry I got this I'll make I'll talk to them
myself I got you and so like and a day after I remember I

66
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:48,020
think like a they remonetized it they're like you're good to
go you're in the program now they're like you're good to go

67
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:55,140
you're in the program now for your second channel and it's
like yay that's all you have to do you gotta get a youtube

68
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:08,300
guy email them be like what the fuck and then they'll be
like don't worry yay oh my god so second channel monetized

69
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,340
anyway i have a meaning that's the reason Uh, the stream is
starting earlier.

70
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,700
I like how, like, I already, like, talk for 14 minutes now,
but I still have more stuff to talk about.

71
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,060
Uh, so I'm so sorry for the EU goons who are like, Doki,
please, we have so limited time together.

72
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,920
This is the one of, this is the only stream we could watch
this week at a reasonable time.

73
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Doki, please play the game.

74
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm sorry, but, like, I'm going to keep talking.

75
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,900
don't keep my connecting flight please start the plane
anyway uh so that is why i have a uh i have a meeting at 2 p

76
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:00,920
.m and i debate between like either streaming at three or
streaming an hour earlier because you know if i stream at my

77
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:08,100
usual time i can only do like you know not that much and i
was just like i don't want to rush it i was like i don't i

78
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,460
don't want to rush it i because it would be like a less than
two hour stream and i was like we don't really have a stream

79
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:23,560
for the eu guns this week so i was like oh my gosh all the
other slots were sort of taken so i was like okay like i say

80
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,140
all the other time slots were like all the other slots were
taking when i'm like an indie now so i control my own

81
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,900
schedule i don't have to reschedule something because of
something here or like overlapping or anything because

82
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,520
there's literally no overlaps for me But, like, anyway, as I
was saying, there was no more time slots for me to put it

83
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,820
in.

84
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,960
So, I was like, I might as well put this at 11, uh, put this
one at 11.30.

85
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,340
Anyway.

86
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,400
Anyway, um, I got some, like, oh my gosh, I'm, like, super
happy today because I actually woke up to some really good

87
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,100
news today.

88
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:11,200
I can't say what, but, like, I can say, like, a lot of my
dreams are coming true, and I'm just, just really happy i'm

89
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,700
just i'm just so happy i mean i'm just happier

90
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:26,260
but it's super exciting it's super duper exciting i'm like
really excited about the oncoming news anyway flight

91
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:33,520
simulator i've always wanted to try this game out i feel
like i'm gonna yell that a lot though uh i feel like i'm

92
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,860
gonna get yelled at so much because it's so, I was like
looking at the settings and I was like, what the fuck, I was

93
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,000
like, because it's like super immersive.

94
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:53,620
And like, I'm just like, oh man, oh no, this game might be
too easy because of how, because of how immersive it is and

95
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,580
how obviously amazing I am at flying.

96
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,620
I was like, oh man, this game could just be too fucking
easy.

97
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
Oh no.

98
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh my god.

99
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,520
Anyway, I don't know.

100
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
I feel I'm a bit scared.

101
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:20,280
For those who are wondering, I'm still not using my, uh, I'm
still not using my new PC because it's a lot to set up for.

102
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,700
And, um, the new PC, there's a lot of stuff I need to do to
set up for it.

103
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:33,520
And I really, I haven't had the time to actually like sit
down and sit down and like, you know, transfer everything

104
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:33,940
over.

105
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:42,980
I feel like I think I will, like do that at another time
maybe like when i have maybe like more rest days at the

106
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:51,140
moment so i guess we're gonna stress test my my current pc
which we don't really need a stress test because we can like

107
00:15:51,140 --> 00:16:03,480
you know we can we can sort of understand how how stressed
the pc already is so i feel like i have to change these

108
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,980
settings i don't know These settings seem, I don't know.

109
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm worried here.

110
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,040
I'm so worried.

111
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,220
All right.

112
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,400
Do we really, I don't know, man.

113
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,280
Okay, we're going to try the settings out.

114
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,260
We're going to do a Difa.

115
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,140
What's the worst that could happen?

116
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:22,900
Difa.

117
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,020
Dave, thank you for the super chat.

118
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,700
Thank you, thank you.

119
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,060
If you could do a forklift, then a plane will be easy.

120
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,880
Thank you, the super chat.

121
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,760
Thank you, thank you.

122
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,340
Also, I saw that you guys, good eye.

123
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,640
I don't know if you guys know this, but it's one of my four
birthdays.

124
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
Or is it five birthdays?

125
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,920
I already lost track of my own lore.

126
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,220
A lima thinking with a zipper check thinking, thank you.

127
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,860
Yes, it's one of my four of the five birthdays.

128
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Very good eye.

129
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,640
Thank you.

130
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,940
It's my birthday, guys.

131
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,640
Real.

132
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,160
All right.

133
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,500
How do you play this?

134
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,060
What do we do?

135
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,960
Do we do flight training?

136
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,460
I guess we should do flight training, right?

137
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,900
Or do we go straight into it?

138
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,860
I feel like...

139
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,380
I already have enough like training guys, right?

140
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,600
Right?

141
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,560
What mode should we do?

142
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,420
World map?

143
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,440
Do we do world?

144
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,280
I feel like world map's gonna fucking kill my my PC.

145
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:22,780
I

146
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:34,920
Okay, but what if we do like a discovery play and what if we
go to New York City?

147
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,680
Okay, we shouldn't go to New York City.

148
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,680
I just realized the implications.

149
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,120
What did we do, like, I don't know, the island here, the
Bora Bora?

150
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:52,120
Alright, we'll do Bora Bora and then I don't know.

151
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,280
The Skyhawk, bro, what the fuck is a Skyhawk?

152
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,240
Okay, I want to do a real plane.

153
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,820
Is that real plane?

154
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,280
That's an real plane.

155
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,900
Alright, here we go.

156
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
The real plane time.

157
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,940
Why the fuck is it showing me a controller?

158
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,140
M and K.

159
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,320
HS.

160
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,120
Thank you for the super chat.

161
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,400
Thank you.

162
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,760
Thank you.

163
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,440
Happy one to four to five birthdays.

164
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Thank you for the super chat.

165
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,280
Thank you.

166
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,340
Thank you.

167
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,060
Mike, thank you.

168
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,600
Super chat.

169
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,240
Thank you.

170
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,240
Happy birthday.

171
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,380
All right.

172
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,520
Here we go.

173
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,380
This is it.

174
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm going to teach you guys how to be a real pilot.

175
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,720
Also, is Sound Guy even here?

176
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,100
What is the plane is this?

177
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,140
Does it tell me what plane it is?

178
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,980
The Air 3501.

179
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
Wait, that's not... I want to be in the cockpit.

180
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:42,680
Oh.

181
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,920
Oh.

182
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Guys.

183
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,840
Am I flying?

184
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,420
Oh my god.

185
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,020
Look, I'm already doing it already.

186
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,380
I think I'm...

187
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,800
My altitude is slowly going down.

188
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,580
How do I...

189
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,540
How do I pull up?

190
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,060
I thought I would be given more instructions.

191
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,440
How do I pull up?

192
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,380
Why am I looking it down here?

193
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,480
Okay, guys, we're gonna watch the slowest fucking crash.

194
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:18,820
Oh!

195
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,920
Why is it turning?

196
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,520
How do I...

197
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,040
Oh, this is worse!

198
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,460
This is worse!

199
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
Okay, I'm...

200
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,800
Alright, we're not going...

201
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,520
We're not doing that anymore.

202
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,940
That's why I don't, oh my god, I don't know how to change my
face.

203
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,100
I accidentally pressed it.

204
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,060
I don't know how to rechange my face.

205
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,020
I don't remember my face.

206
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,900
My, I don't remember how to use my face, guys.

207
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:09,280
I don't remember how to use my face.

208
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
Give me a sec, everybody.

209
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,940
Give me a sec.

210
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,660
All right, turning that off.

211
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,020
Turning my face off real quick, guys.

212
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,200
Gotta turn that off.

213
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,940
All right, there we go.

214
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,660
All right, okay, I realized, guys, I realized we're gonna
need to do the tutorial.

215
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,820
We really need to do basic handling.

216
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,240
All right, don't worry.

217
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,200
Don't worry, your pilots got this introduction.

218
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,740
We're going to go through a basic course through this.

219
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,420
It can't be that difficult.

220
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,500
All right.

221
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,920
We can't be that difficult.

222
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,040
All right.

223
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,800
All right.

224
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,360
Here we go.

225
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,740
This is it.

226
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,480
Maybe just a little bit of tutorial would be helpful.

227
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
I don't know why.

228
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,620
But like maybe just a little bit of a tutorial.

229
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,360
Bacon.

230
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,380
Thank you for the Akasupa.

231
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,800
Thank you.

232
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,320
Thank you.

233
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,060
10 out of 10.

234
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,340
Fastest play I ever had.

235
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,880
Was a little concerned when a pilot asked how to fly, but
they landed on a really nice coffee fountain So it's all

236
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,180
good.

237
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,880
Yeah, see that guy gets it.

238
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:31,380
There was no fire There was no fire so everything was okay
Hello, hello Jess Why are we starting on the ground?

239
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:31,980
It's a plane.

240
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,440
It should be in the sky Okay

241
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,470
All right, I mean it looks pretty nice the ASX XGS Look at
that.

242
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,510
Oh my god, that's me!

243
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,290
There's another person in my plane!

244
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,530
It's my twin!

245
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,470
They trust me so much they put another- Look, I'm not a bad
pilot.

246
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,050
Because why- if I was a bad pilot, why would they put
another person in my plane?

247
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,550
Okay, open the basic controller's pad- there's-

248
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,450
Oh- I

249
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,310

very i don't know guys i think it's trying to tell me that

255
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:19,410
being a pilot might be a little difficult when you're on the
plane and you hear your pod says guys how do i fly over the

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,310
I'm pressing A.

280
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,410
Are we leaving?

281

Oh, yoke!

It's this button!

284
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,610
It's right here.

285
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,290
Wait, what?

286
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,170
Wait, I saw the yoke.

287
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,050
Where was the yoke?

288
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,210

That is the yoke!

293
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,370
In these cases, you need to lock the cursor onto them in
order to interact.

294
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,690
Oh my god.

295
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,950
Take a look at the clock in the middle of the dash...

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,090
Oh my god, it's...

297
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,490
Go ahead and lock the cursor on it.

298
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,530
Wait, but...

299
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,750
Okay, lock the cursor.

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,870
Did I lock it?

305
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:24,950
I'm...

306
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,570
Am I locking?

307
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,070

308
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,490

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,490
I'm trying.

313
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,210
Where?

314
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,430
Wait, I should, like, hide this one, too.

315
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,670
Instructor, it's not letting me lock!

316
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,690
Teacher!

317
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,990
It's not...

00:26:50,770 --> 00:27:01,350
I'm trying Oh, it's like right here You have to click
exactly this tiny ass thing Okay, that seems like the right

319
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:08,070
time It's easy to rotate the camera You can also go in
freely in the cockpit To get a better view Oh, I need to

320
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:15,690
know my time That's the pilot You don't need to know what
time it is If they're late, they're late We can, they'll

321
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,730
never blame the pilot for being late They'll blame the
airlines.

322
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,150
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

323
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,010
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,130
My fightless blur.

00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,510
Thank you, the super chat.

326
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,170
Okay, hold LB and move the camera around.

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,650
I'm holding.

328
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,010

329
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,970
Oh, that was not LB.

Oh.

333
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,490

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:39,970
Whoa!

335
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:40,690

345
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,390
Okay, I don't think they let me have that as a custom.

346
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,570
Okay, save.

347
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,650

00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,570
Then try switching to your custom one again.

352
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,150
Alright.

353
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,810

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,010
Oh, okay.

356
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,770
I want this to be my custom though.

357
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,370
Try to familiarize yourself with them.

361
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,050
I said, I'm ready.

362
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,790
I figured it out, guys.

363
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,770
I fucking figured it out.

364
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:23,490
Alright.

365
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,310

Alright, let's see.

367
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,390

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,530
Let's go to...

369
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,190
Seattle.

370
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,150
I wanna go see the... I wanna see the fucking space needle.

371
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,490
Alright, fly.

372
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,770
And then... Oh, wait.

373
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,510
Arrival.

374
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,050
And then we depart from... I don't know where this is.

375
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,010
What state is that?

376
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,310
I don't know.

377
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:50,890
There we go.

378
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,710
We're so ready.

379
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,510
We're so fucking ready now.

380
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,130
I got an A.

381
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,350
My instructor said I got an A.

382
00:29:59,630 --> 00:29:59,870
Chat.

383
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,150
How badly can I fuck up now?

384
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,530
I can't fuck up if the instructor gave me an A.

385
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:08,770
Alright.

386
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,130
Oh, thank god.

387
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,850
It's just me.

388
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,530
Guys, it's okay.

389
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,330
It's just me.

390
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,930
Release the parking brake.

391
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,490
Apply throw throttle.

392
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,650
Okay, watch this, guys.

393
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,650
Okay, we're gonna...

394
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,470
I like to have...

395
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,390
I'm gonna turn off the visibility here.

396
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,010
And then we're gonna turn on all the lights.

397
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,710
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

398
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:34,790
Okay.

399
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,330
And then we gotta have...

400
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,990
We gotta have the cabin light on and everything.

401
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,470
And then...

402
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,650
What the fuck is an alternator?

403
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,190
That's a gun.

404
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,450
And then we're gonna do...

405
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,290
I think we're good.

406
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,570
I think we're good.

407
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,790
I think we're good to go.

408
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,230
All right.

409
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,050
Throw a full throttle time.

410
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,130
All right.

411
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,030
Am I...

412
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,990
How do I go forward?

413
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,330
That should be full throttle.

414
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:03,650
Oh!

415
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,070
Oh!

416
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,030
I'm going forward!

417
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,570
All right.

418
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,290
All right.

419
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,370
Looks good.

420
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,210
Looks good.

421
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,440
I think we're good.

422
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,420
And then we go up.

423
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,600
Okay.

424
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
Am I going straight?

425
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:40,020
seems all right I'll eventually fly up because of the
velocity right raise it higher and lift up oh I'm flying oh

426
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,260
my god oh

427
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:53,530
guys did you see that I was in the air

428
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,640
Guys, did you see that?

429
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,520
I flew!

430
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh my...

431
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,800
Oh my god!

432
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,660
I'm a natural.

433
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,720
I do, I could do it.

434
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,460
Okay, guys, I think I need another lesson.

435
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,080
I need another lesson.

436
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,320
Okay, I think...

437
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,120
Alright, guys, I think I need another lesson here.

438
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,680
I learned about yoke and reading basic...

439
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,820
I don't need to read basic instructions.

440
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Maybe I do.

441
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,740
All right, here you go.

442
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,920
Oh, well, way to die.

443
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,360
You're not dead.

444
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,840
Nothing exploded.

445
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,000
It was just a minor inconvenience.

446
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,140
And so it's just minor inconvenience, chat.

447
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,200
Nobody, everybody's okay.

448
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,820
So dramatic.

449
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,960
Okay, we're learning.

450
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,380
Slowly but surely.

451
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,100
It should give me like a bigger aircraft.

452
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,480
I don't want to drive this tiny-ass plane.

453
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,680
Alright.

454
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,120
Thank you, instructor.

455
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah.

456
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,420
Ooh.

457
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,740
Yeah.

458
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm getting on board for these flights.

459
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,440
Breezy, thank you for the super chat.

460
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:14,880
Thank you.

461
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,520
Thank you.

462
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,840
I flew!

463
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,900
I flew at the trailing edge of the wings while turning the
yoke to see the effect on the ailerons.

464
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,300
Oh my god, do you see that?

465
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,320
The ailerons?

466
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,540
Okay.

467
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Do you see that?

468
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,080
It's moving up and down.

469
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,520
Down!

470
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
I'm doing that.

471
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,320
This guy trusts me.

472
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,900
Look at him.

473
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,280
Like my bodyguards.

474
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,660
The what?

475
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,900
The elevator?

476
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,880
Is that what an elevator?

477
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,280
Truly a former Air Command Air Force Hero.

478
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,340
Thank you for the super chat.

479
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:57,940
Thank you, Pink.

480
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:11,610
yeah oh my god wait i have breaks they control the rudder at
the end of the oh whoa that's new for coordinating turns or

481
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:19,030
compensating for a plane's tendency to pull left during
takeoffs and climbs wait sorry what did she say about the

482
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:31,120
reason for breaks to see the effect on the rudder look at
the vertical tail and then move by using and by using well

483
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

484
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,760
Move by RT.

485
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Oh, look at that.

486
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,860
It's flapping.

487
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,920
Oh, my God.

488
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,060
It's saying hi.

489
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,200
Oh.

490
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,100
That's how you turn, right?

491
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,920
Look at the throttle.

492
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,160
Is that the throttle?

493
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,460
This is where I drive.

494
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Keep it selected and push it forward to increase power.

495
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:15,260
increase power guys I think I realized why I crashed guys I
think I realized also thank you flight attendant for telling

496
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:28,060
me to for telling me to to increase the sound and not push
enough much more do you want me to push it there you go

497
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,860
Okay.

498
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,460
Oh my god, there's so many things to know.

499
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,820
Where the fuck is my co-pilot?

500
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,720
Deselect the throttle.

501
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,610
And increase power.

502
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,810
Look away.

503
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,410
Why do I...

504
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,330
Oh, I can just hold.

505
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,070
Oh!

506
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,890
I can just hold it.

507
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,350
Hold B to decrease.

508
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,130
Oh!

509
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,450
I'm doing it.

510
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:14,550
You'll be able to see the power change on your rpm indicator
what the fuck is oh that's my co-pilot spot who's gonna tell

511
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:26,770
me about my rpm meter that's so far away from me look at
your current speed on the air speed indicator where's that

512
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,490
it's on the left oh okay thank you thank you instructor

513
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,070
As long as I go fast, that's all that matters, right?

514
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,790
Okay.

515
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,910
All right, Dragoons, you're my co-pilot.

516
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,330
Guys, you want to make sure we don't crash because if we
crash, we both die.

517
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,330
You'd be like, oh, it's so funny.

518
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,210
Don't keep crash.

519
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,610
You're in the same plane.

520
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,730
We both crash.

521
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,350
Like, it's your fault as well.

522
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,750
That's all for today.

523
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,330
That's it?

524
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,450
Next time, we'll see how it feels in the air.

525
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:05,770
What?

526
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,770
That's it?

527
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,870
You just... What?

528
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,390
Guys!

529
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,190
Oh my god.

530
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,550
I think I'm ready for real this time.

531
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,070
Guys.

532
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,410
I think we're ready for real.

533
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,450
Okay.

534
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,430
Let's like go in the air first.

535
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:23,710
Okay.

536
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,470
I'm going to at least...

537
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,390
We're going to try to go in the air.

538
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,610
And then after being in the air.

539
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,490
We're definitely ready.

540
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,590
Okay.

541
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,790
I'm thinking of the super chat.

542
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,110

548
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,130
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

549
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,010
Oh, it is, look at that, it's so beautiful.

550
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,390
I love how unrendered this is.

551
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,390
There's an airport?

552
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:30,890
Where?

553
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,330
Is that an airport?

554
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,950
What the fuck is that?

555
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,530
That's an airport?

556
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,150
Oh, the instructor flies?

557
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,630
What if I don't want you to fly it?

558
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,680
Where was my turn?

559
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,840
That's not fair.

560
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm the pilot.

561
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,080
I'm wearing the hat.

562
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,680
That's not fair.

563
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,660
It's like she doesn't trust me.

564
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,840
It's like my fucking co-pilot doesn't trust me.

565
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,520
They don't even let me fly the thing.

566
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm going to turn on the fucking lights.

567
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,440
Oh, I can't.

568
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,880
They just say...

569
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,360
They won't even let me turn on the lights.

570
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,640
Why did they disable everything?

571
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,580
Okay.

572
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,700
The aircraft is currently set to a cruise attitude.

573
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,420
The position it should be in for regular flight.

574
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,420
I wouldn't either.

575
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,120
Now let's try banking into a turn by moving the yoke.

576
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:40,980
Oh.

577
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,700
Okay.

578
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,180
Monkey see, monkey do.

579
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,080
Wait, but her thing's not moving.

580
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,460
Oh my god.

581
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,400
Autopilot is on, isn't it?

582
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,740
You can't fool me.

583
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,720
The yoke isn't even moving.

584
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,810
As a general rule, you always are 30 degrees.

585
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,490
I don't know if it's under 30 degrees.

586
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,890
Which one do I look at for that?

587
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,310
Which one do I look at?

588
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,970
I don't know if it's...

589
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,130
Do I have to be outside?

590
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:14,910
Okay.

591
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,810
I don't know if it's 30 degrees.

592
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:33,590
I have controls Oh my god I'm gonna turn on some lights Oh
Oh Oh I want to turn on the pilot heat My cushy is cold I'm

593
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:41,010
gonna turn on the pilot heat And then I'm gonna turn on I'm
gonna turn on the landing lights Because I might be landing

594
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:46,390
soon And then the taxi lights Alright We Oh Oh

595
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,930
We're okay.

596
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,950
See?

597
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,350
We're okay!

598
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,050
Look at that!

599
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,810
We're going to Sedona!

600
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,570
That's like a song, right?

601
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,410
They were not okay.

602
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,430
Let's try climbing up and down.

603
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,390
Up and down.

604
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,750
Gently pull on the yoke to climb.

605
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:23,530
Yay, that's climbing right hold your pitch up for five
seconds.

606
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,690
What does that mean?

607
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,510
Excellent.

608
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,350
Oh, okay

609
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:43,990
Those beeps are not those beeps are not out good All right,
gently push forward hold your pitch down for five seconds.

610
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:53,450
Okay next time be a bit more gentle on the controls i'm so
gentle do you guys not see that time to find the airport

611
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,690
again look around oh it's this way make it turn in that
direction

612
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,230
guys guys i thought it'd be funny i thought it'd be funny
guys

613
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:21,140
okay i got a little impatient yeah guys i thought my my
Pilot, I thought guys, I thought my co-pilot would stop me.

614
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:27,820
I really thought, I really, I really thought my co-pilot
would stop me.

615
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,560
Well, they take you with the super chat.

616
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:29,900
Thank you.

617
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,520
Thank you.

618
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,220
Yo!

619
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,280
And then look at the fucking scenery again.

620
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,700
I thought they would stop me.

621
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,900
What's the point of having a co-pilot if they don't stop
you?

622
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,200
From making stupid decisions.

623
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,140
Your co-pilot's here to stop your intrusive thoughts.

624
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,700
I just think my co-pilot was not doing her job.

625
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,520
They could have fucking... They could have fucking took
control of the yoke.

626
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,700
That's not my fault.

627
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,320
They could have literally took control.

628
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,200
It's their life, too.

629
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,520
It's their life, too.

630
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,000
Oh my god, I can turn...

631
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:32,180
on a crew volume okay enjoy the view all right i'm enjoying
the view guys look at that beautiful airport over there it's

632
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,340
not my fault mine choose the thoughts one what's the point
of having a co-pilot they don't stop you from making

633
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:46,840
terrible decisions like i might as well be like the only
person in this plane you have five or two gate co-pilots and

634
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,980
no one why did you guys not stop me You guys were supposed
to be my co-pilots.

635
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,400
Why didn't you guys stop me from letting my thoughts win?

636
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,900
All right, the aircraft is currently set to a cruise
attitude the position it should be in for regular flight I

637
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:17,500
still can't read all of these There's too many fucking Meter
circle things in front of me.

638
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,380
What's this is this the time?

639
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:26,760
Oh, so that's how you do the turn That's such a smooth turn,
man.

640
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,900
Why can't I fly like that?

641
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,760
I can and I will.

642
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm going to prove y'all wrong.

643
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,000
JK, because I can.

644
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,180
As a general rule, you always want to keep your turns under
30 degrees.

645
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:38,760
Okay.

646
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,380
How do I know it's with 30 degrees?

647
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I'm not good at math.

648
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,020
Can I have access to the plane now?

649
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:48,880
Okay.

650
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,080
I want to...

651
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,420
Alright.

652
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,000
Okay.

653
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,960
I'm going to turn on the light.

654
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:54,580
I'm going to turn on the light.

655
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:02,320
turn on the heat position and then the light here.

656
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,760
What's this red button?

657
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,460
Long time flight simmer.

658
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,780
Very recent dragon here.

659
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,840
This is fantastic.

660
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:14,220
Keep up.

661
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:14,620
See?

662
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,080
This person thinks I'm fucking flying the plane perfectly.

663
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:18,740
August.

664
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,760
Thank you for the super chat.

665
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,400
Thank you.

666
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,960
I knew I was doing things right.

667
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:34,600
If this long-term flight simulator player thinks i'm doing
okay then i'm right and you're wrong fake donated don't

668
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:42,660
enable it gently pull back the yoke to increase the is that
gentle

669
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:58,640
what you mean that's so gentle for the descent is the same
principle except you're pushing on the yoke go ahead gently

670
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:11,240
pitch down okay i think i'm doing it okay there guys uh
we're experiencing some turbulence right now this is just

671
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:16,920
turbulence is this what turbulence is look around and when
you found it make it turn in that direction oh wait it's

672
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:29,620
this way we okay we gotta go up though when we're turning we
this will turbulence guys we're just experiencing turbulence

673
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:39,540
it's not it's not man-made error it's just turbulence okay
captain dokey we're losing altitude reduce speed to 138

674
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:46,900
knots and pull up on that yoke charlie thank you for the
super chat thank you thank you it's sort of it fucks the

678
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,620
No, that's the airport, right?

679
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,200
Just landing on the floor.

680
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,880
No, that's a road?

681
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,640
Oh my god.

682
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,620
Okay, we're gonna find this goddamn airport.

683
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,500
Or turn your head.

684
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,080
Oh, oh my god, guys.

685
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,460
I could turn my head.

686
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,760
Okay, no, that's not the airport.

687
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,460
Oh, there it is.

688
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,000
There it is.

689
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,820
I see the airport.

690
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,800
There it is.

691
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,940
It was right behind me this entire time.

692
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,420
There you go.

693
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,100
I was like, I was like, turn police for the love of God.

694
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,940
Turn your head.

695
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,500
You're fine.

696
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,660
There's like a drug world we're too fired a pilot.

697
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,020
Look, I didn't say how I got my license.

698
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,020
Thank you, the super chat.

699
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,140
Thank you, thank you.

700
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:07,760
There you go.

701
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,720
I found it.

702
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,300
Guys, I found the airport.

703
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,900
The shipments are soft and gentle.

704
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,380
To go deeper into handling and techniques.

705
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,260
I do it?

706
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,180
Soon enough, you'll be able to enjoy trips all on your way.

707
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:37,000
your own oh my god i'm a certified pilot look at that a b
why would i deserve a b that was just turbulence killing

708
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:47,160
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you oh my god
how come turbulence affected my my grade that's not fair all

709
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,740
right altitude refers to the aircraft's nose position
relative to the horizon there's three pitch altitudes

710
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,760
controlled by the elevator and And in this lesson, you'll
learn to climb, cruise, and descend.

711
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,040
I don't need to learn how to do that.

712
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,560
I just go up and down.

713
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,760
The B for Tokeper.

714
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,860
B for best pilot.

715
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,480
Exactly.

716
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,600
That's why I got a B.

717
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,440
You're telling how good I was at flying this plane.

718
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,880
It was so majestic.

719
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,140
Okay.

720
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,440
To help demonstrate pitch, I've drawn three lines on the
windshield.

721
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,180
I don't feel comfortable with my pilot has, like, these
three lines.

722
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,000
lines on the plane.

723
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,400
Before you get on the plane, make sure your plane doesn't
have these three lines drawn on there.

724
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,640
Because that means it might be driven by dokeybird.

725
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,940
Let's dig deeper into what that means.

726
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,240
Pull back gently on the yoke until the climb horizon.

727
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,240
Then maintain that attitude.

728
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,560
Oh!

729
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,260
I see.

730
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,400
According to your altimeter, we're gaining altitude.

731
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,020
Oh, tritunery.

732
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,080
Wait, I need no physics?

733
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,160
I need no map to be a pilot?

734
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:12,990
Okay.

735
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,450
Our speed is increasing and our altitude is stable.

736
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:17,970
Alright.

737
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,950
That's why you don't migrate like other birds breeds than
you and Super Chat.

738
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,250
Because I like to stay inside.

739
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,590
That attitude line matches the horizon.

740
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,470
Then maintain that attitude.

741
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:44,290
the attitude okay that's altitude onto the horizon for 10
seconds okay oh my god I have to look at all these fucking

742
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:53,790
circles that's a too many circles to look at after look I
want to enjoy the scenery bring the crews out to lie The

743
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,190
speed is decreasing and your altitude is stable.

744
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:59,610
That's okay.

745
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,250
Try to make only small adjustments to your pitch to avoid
overcorrection.

746
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:07,630
Am I doing it?

747
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,430
I did it.

748
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,470
Those are small.

749
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:17,530
All right.

750
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,550
Would you be comfortable your pilot was like a B student?

751
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:35,250
man i mean it's for b for best right that's how the markings
are go a is all right b for best c for completionist d for

752
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:44,910
done job good all right turns oh my god i can do barrel
rolls i'm gonna learn how to do paladin David

753
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,990
D for Doki D for Doki

754
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,480
I don't know I don't know what I expected

755
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:25,340
I don't know I thought it'd be different I really thought
this would be different.

756
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,840
Okay, but what if I do this while pulling up?

757
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,040
Maybe it'll be better.

758
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:37,310
Line to help you make properly for left turns.

759
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,270
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I did it!

760
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,730
Oh my god, guys, guys, I did it!

761
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,390
Guys!

762
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,130
Did you guys see that?

763
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,570
Oh my god!

764
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,290
With the risk of your lives!

765
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,430
I did it!

766
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,470
I pulled it off!

767
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,570
Okay.

768
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,150
Watch your altitude.

769
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,510
It wasn't constant during the turn.

770
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,550
Now let's see you level back out.

771
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:16,150
That's okay.

772
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:18,090
I did it.

773
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,250
I'm professional already.

774
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,350
Remember to maintain altitude.

775
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,930
Is this the dokey dokeybird flight airport sounds horrific?

776
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,270
Thank you for the super chat.

777
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:26,930
Thank you.

778
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:27,370
Thank you.

779
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:31,430
Why are you doing this?

780
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,090
What the fuck is that?

781
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,010
10 degrees each.

782
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,630
Air travel.

783
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,530
Thank you for the super chat.

784
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:46,810
Thank you.

785
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:47,330
Thank you.

786
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,950
I've flown a real Cessna for 152.

787
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,610
Except it was an Ardobat.

788
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:54,930
No 152 is so easy.

789
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:04,970
to fly especially in slow flight and sleep turns see guys
this is so easy that's basically what they're saying so

790
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:09,430
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you what
they're saying is i'm doing a great job

791
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:25,630
i'm doing amazing right now that's exactly what the super
chat implies right maintaining it right now Working to

792
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,730
maintain a constant.

793
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,010
I land my plane

794
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:42,780
Oh Oh now she takes control Okay, not gonna lie.

795
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:55,520
She should have taken control like before I did my barrel I
like how now she like he takes control of the plane My

796
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:05,980
leveled but i did it see oh for completionist for uh

797
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:18,620
completionist guys see for completionist guys i did a great
job thank you instructor all right what's this power

798
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,240
settings the basics straight level altitude okay i feel like
i don't need a note of basic handling anymore i feel like

799
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:36,280
it's all about off and landing and then after that i should
be fine oh airliner trainer okay we're gonna go with i don't

800
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:43,260
need to know basic stuff anymore i just need to know how to
take off firing space to the runway take off and then i'll

801
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:52,700
figure out landing later uh i went to take off and then
we're gonna figure out landing on the on the go uh we're

802
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,200
gonna figure out landing live all we need to know is

803
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,220
All right, Texas, thank you for the super chat.

804
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,780
Thank you, thank you.

805
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,160
Wait, I gotta get more immersive for that.

806
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:03,920
Okay,

807
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,580
guys, as your main flight.

808
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,920
There's an old saying I like.

809
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,460
A mile of road will take you a mile.

810
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,740
A mile of runway will take you anywhere.

811
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:45,160
Taking off isn't hard, but first, we always take off into
the wind, which won't be an issue on a common ground.

812
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:53,480
day like today second before we enter a runway we always
make sure it's clear check to the right to see if a vehicle

813
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:00,300
is i don't think there's anybody here i think they know i'm
flying a plane today yeah i think they know i'm flying today

814
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:07,620
all right yeah seems clear everything looks good no traffic
go ahead and

815
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,760
tap your plane just after the number 21.

816
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:32,140
all right slightly increase the power that should be good
and then we're going to go to the center of the oh oh oh

817
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:37,220
guys guys it wasn't slight guys guys it wasn't

818
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:54,280
okay I'm gonna figure this because I realized it was not
slight it was not slight chat a mile of road will take you a

819
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:08,740
mile a mile of runway will take you anywhere right there
guys guys guys guys guys guys why is it not turning guys the

820
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:23,680
trees oh okay okay there you start oh thank god i think i'm
my co-pilot oh my co-pilot to control Oh, thank God!

821
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,580
Check to the right to see if a vehicle is on the runway.

822
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:29,520
Okay.

823
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,040
Then stop your plane just after the number 21.

824
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:32,480
All right.

825
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:32,720
We're slowly.

826
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,880
We're so slow now.

827
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,560
Okay.

828
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,440
Like, dragons, you guys saved the plane.

829
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,520
You're heroes.

830
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,360
He saved the plane from me.

831
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,520
Okay.

832
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,340
Next time, watch the runway and the approach.

833
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:47,920
No!

834
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh!

835
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,620
Now slowly taxi onto the runway and align the plane with the
same thing.

836
00:58:52,640 --> 00:59:09,840
center line is the center is the center guys in mind this is
because i don't think i'm in the center guys that breaks

837
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,840
where's how do i how do i get the breaks

838
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:29,100
ah how do i how do i do the breaks okay All right, we're
going to taxi onto the runway and align the plane with the

839
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,800
center line.

840
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,500
Then stop your plane just after the number 21.

841
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,100
Oh, there's 21.

842
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,180
Guys, I think I passed 21.

843
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,120
I think I...

844
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,860
But it's okay, I'm in the center now.

845
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,160
I'm in the center, though.

846
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,060
Guys, I think 21 is, like, way behind me not gonna lie.

847
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:04,820
around maybe the co-pilot would take me back to the let me
pick up ma'am ma'am ma'am take me back take him oh oh oh go

848
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,860
back in position oh thank god oh okay never mind i collided
with the object

849
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,740
okay this time i got it there's an old saying i like okay

850
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,200
we'll take you anywhere oh my god this This is a break.

851
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,480
Oh, this is a break.

852
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,160
Okay.

853
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,080
Power am I on?

854
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,580
I'm on 7%.

855
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,620
Before we enter a runway, we always make sure it's clear.

856
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,460
Check to the right to see if a vehicle is on the runway.

857
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,520
And to the left to make sure nobody here.

858
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,060
Guys, I remember how they used the break.

859
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,280
Look.

860
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,200
Look, see?

861
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,280
Am I ready?

862
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,720
Guys, I remember.

863
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,380
Okay.

864
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,860
Look left.

865
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,340
I did it.

866
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,920
Thanks for flying with Tokyo Airlines.

867
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,440
Come on, thank you for the superchild.

868
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:03,800
Thank you.

869
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,400
Thank you.

870
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,660
Maybe I just do a little...

871
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,860
Okay.

872
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,480
Maybe I have like 24.

873
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,600
Okay.

874
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,080
Okay.

875
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,420
There you go.

876
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,940
This should be the center now.

877
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:35,500
god guys i'm reading i told you all i need to do is learn i
just need to learn i just need to learn how to take off

878
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:50,440
we're gonna learn how to land while we're on in the air okay
break oh my god oh my god we're doing it slowly come on

879
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,780
we're we're slowly getting there

880
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,460
All right, slow and steady.

881
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,420
Slow and steady, Toki.

882
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,400
Slow and steady.

883
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,280
You have multiple crashes now.

884
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,480
All right, here you go.

885
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,600
And then...

886
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,280
Is that it?

887
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,400
Yeah.

888
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:22,260
We're going to take off.

889
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,960
We're going to apply full power.

890
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:24,960
She gave me permission.

891
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,660
Oh my god, I'm in the center.

892
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,740
Oh

893
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:42,020
Where's 55 now slowly taxi onto the runway and align the
plane with the center line Then stop your plane just after

894
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,060
the number 21.

895
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,540
Oh, this is good.

896
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,060
Oh, oh, oh Guys, I don't guess it's okay.

897
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:56,860
We don't guys guys Okay Pull back on the yoke to take off.

898
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,560
There you go.

899
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,300
Yeah Yay!

900
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,280
Tokey trip.

901
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,780
We're doing it!

902
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,220
We're in the air!

903
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,260
Where's 75?

904
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,740
Where is 75?

905
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,280
Where is 75?

906
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:15,500
Where is 75?

907
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:16,660
Oh, we're 75.

908
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,600
Use your rudders to keep the runway heading of 210 degrees.

909
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,420
Maintain 75 knots and we'll reach our target altitude of 75.

910
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,520
Oh, oh, I'm at 75.

911
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:36,660
okay where am i 5 000 i don't know where's 5 000 oh i want
to turn on the heat though my butt is getting a little cold

912
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:45,640
yeah okay then we're gonna turn on the lights yeah and then
oh oh i need to pull up i need to pull up i need to pull up

913
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:59,340
maintain heading what's 210 degrees is this 210 oh oh it's
okay it's fine oh there we go What feet am I on?

914
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,800
I'm learning.

915
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,260
Am I getting higher?

916
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,520
Am I getting higher?

917
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,060
Look!

918
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,660
Look at all these people down there who are very safe.

919
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:20,420
Look at them!

920
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,440
They're so safe right now.

921
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,200
I don't know.

922
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,260
I always, like, get scared when, like, whenever...

923
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,140
I never want to live.

924
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:35,180
closer to an airport well to be fair other than like the
noises and stuff but like i always get like when the play

925
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:41,900
when you hear the plane landing like hear the plane in the
sky and you're like oh nocturio thank you for the super chat

926
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:53,820
thank you thank you flying she's not even forklift certified
yeah good job whoo yay all right i think we're ready i think

927
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,660
we're ready guys Wait, I want to make sure I can handle,
like, an actual aircraft.

928
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,220
Alright, airline training.

929
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,420
Alright, this is it.

930
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,060
This is, like, we need to learn how to take off for this.

931
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,640
And then we're going to be ready.

932
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah.

933
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,480
We just have to be able to drive a plane.

934
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,160
Alright, here we go.

935
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,400
We just need to be able to drive a real plane.

936
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,840
A real fucking plane.

937
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,100
Not the baby planes.

938
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,160
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

939
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,520
What the where's the wheel?

940
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:43,000
Where the fuck what happened to the wheel?

941
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:53,640
But luckily we have some extra tools They're all these
buttons A little easier once we're airborne For starters,

942
01:05:53,660 --> 01:06:00,640
the auto thrust Managed I'm gonna sit in the middle Oh, we
have autopilot We'll keep us on track with navigation

943
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,760
All right, we're sitting in the middle.

944
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,680
We're going to be both pilot and co-pilot.

945
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,680
I'm going to execute a straight-out takeoff.

946
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,360
After you complete the initial climb, I'll take the
controls.

947
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,260
But first, check the MCDU for our reference speeds.

948
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,500
MCDU?

949
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,860
I already typed in today's numbers.

950
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,740
The rotation speed.

951
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,520
Numbers?

952
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,420
It's 131 knots.

953
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,180
I'll call out when we reach it.

954
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,020
Take a look at the PFD now.

955
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,360
PFD?

956
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:40,180
what are these words you just need to begin a gentle
rotation by pulling back on the side stick don't exceed 10

957
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:47,880
degrees until you've lifted off next let's review the thrust
levers we need to be aware of three different detents use

958
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,960
the climb detent labeled CL on your throttle to
automatically manage the thrust for the remainder of the

959
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:02,080
flight toga to take off at full power on short runways or
when performing a go-around and for today This is like going

960
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,600
from one ear to the other.

961
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:09,320
I'm fucking, I can't register what she's telling me to do.

962
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,860
I don't need to save fuel, is it that?

963
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,560
We don't need a save fuel.

964
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,860
What is this?

965
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,120
Okay, we're ready to go.

966
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,660
Apply half forward side stick.

967
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,340
Then move both thrust levers gently forward to 50%

968
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,080
Is that 50%?

969
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:50,660
Move thrust levers to selected takeoff thrust by pressing A.

970
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,240
Is that...

971
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,640
Is that it?

972
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,410
Is that...

973
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,880
Am I doing it?

974
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,920
Did I do it?

975
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,700
Am I gonna fly now?

976
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,360
Is that the ocean?

977
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,720
Oh, we're flying.

978
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,520
Guys,

979
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,100
guys, we're flying.

980
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:43,860
Oversed?

981
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:45,380
Oversed?

982
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,780
What does that mean?

983
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:49,580
What?

984
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:49,860
What?

985
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,820
Is that me?

986
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,220
Go higher?

987
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:03,930
Do I go faster?

988
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,910
Okay, now the auto thrust is armed.

989
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,690
Use the rudder to keep us on the center line.

990
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,410
Rotate 80.

991
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:15,690
Positive climb.

992
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,010
I'm not on the rudder.

993
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,590
Oh hey, there's people.

994
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,870
Engage autopilot.

995
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:26,610
Oh, autopilot.

996
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:33,070
Can either be engaged five seconds or 100 feet after takeoff
to manage heading and altitude.

997
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,070
Mega overseas.

998
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,330
Look at city.

999
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,990
What the...

1000
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:41,990
To climb detent.

1001
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,890
What the...

1002
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,490
To climb?

1003
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:47,610
Press B.

1004
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:50,590
What?

1005
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,970
What's over speeding?

1006
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,010
I don't know!

1007
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,350
What is overspeeding?

1008
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:01,590
Overspeed.

1009
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:02,810
Overspeed.

1010
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:03,990
I'm like, what?

1011
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,710
What does that mean?

1012
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,990
Where's my flight attendant?

1013
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:09,730
I did it.

1014
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,210
Oh, wait.

1015
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,010
I did not do it.

1016
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:15,190
How did I fail?

1017
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,220
It means overspeed.

1018
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:41,200
at 10 000 feet or 4 000 meters once over the target roll
over and cut the throttle pull stick up to 90 angle degree

1019
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:50,300
hold on to one one let's thank you for the super chat thing
guys i think i'm ready guys guys i think i'm actually ready

1020
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:58,040
guys for real this time okay we're gonna grab a We're gonna
grab a real plane.

1021
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,380
A real person plane.

1191
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,660
Raise landing gear.

1192
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,980
What the fuck is landing gear?

1193
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:02,920
You love it when you hear your pilot say, what the fuck is
landing gear?

1194
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,220
Can I...

1195
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:06,080
How do I turn on autopilot?

1196
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:08,460
Is the autopilot on?

1197
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,060
Do I have to drive this myself now?

1198
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,120
I can't believe my captain is my OSHA.

1199
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,220
We're not gonna make it, bros, but it's been an amazing
ride.

1200
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,420
What the fuck?

1201
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,620
Where are you believers?

1202
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,120
Where are my believers in chat?

1203
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,200
Glasgow Tower Boeing Alpha Sierra.

1204
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,960
747 frequency change.

1205
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,420
Am I going up?

1206
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,200
Am I doing it?

1207
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,100
I don't need clearance.

1208
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:40,640

Clear through the Charlie Airspace.

1211
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,520
I think we're okay, right?

1212
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,560
Clear through the Charlie Airspace, Boeing 747.

1213
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,000
I did it!

1214
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:10,900

altitude how do you know if i'm losing altitude i could

1229
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,480
barely read any of these is it because i'm going down
contact

1230
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,960
Oh, they're saying goodbye.

1231

Is that me?

1232
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,240
Oh, that's me!

1233
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:56,000
I think

1234
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,870
we're fine.

1235
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,550
Like, we're like 420.

1236
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,810
I should have selected a closer place.

1237
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,430
It's way too long.

1238
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,930
Okay, I'm gonna pull up.

1239
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,790
And then I'm gonna tab out.

1240
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,400
Okay.

1241
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,320
We're fine.

1242
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:29,220
We should be fine.

1243
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:36,210
Can you tell that I'm not tapped into the game yet?

1244
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:37,230
Can you tell?

1245
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,010
We're fine!

1246
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:41,870
Everybody's fine!

1247
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,770
Stop panicking!

1248
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:46,750
Guys, look!

1249
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,990
We're okay!

1250
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,150
Why is everybody panicking?

1251
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:52,350
Why is everybody panicking?

1252
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:52,930
Why is everybody panicking?

1253
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:57,290
We didn't learn to land.

1254
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,830
I think that's like the worst part.

1255
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:05,210
I think the worst part is that we actually did not learn how
to land this plane.

1256
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:08,790
So like, that's going to be...

1257
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:13,030
That's going to be an issue for us later on.

1258
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:18,010
We actually forgot to learn how to land the plane.

1259
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:25,010
Guys, why did you guys forgot to teach me how to land the
plane.

1260
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,630
We all had one job.

1261
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:31,730
This is so far away.

1262
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:34,170
I'm just gonna land here on the Stonehill farm.

1263
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,910
Fuck this.

1264
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:36,870
I'm just gonna land here.

1265
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,670
Alright, I'm gonna land in a Stonehill farm airstrip.

1266
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,210
This is way too far.

1267
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:45,410
I chose the destination I chose was way too far.

1268
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,750
It's gonna take us forever!

1269
01:27:53,310 --> 01:28:06,110
It's like 414 like something meters to that farm we go wait
how do i use autopilot i forgot how to use the autopilot

1270
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:19,510
which button does that is this did i click autopilot i think
i did did i do it

1271
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,840
no i don't want autopilot Okay.

1272
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,860
I don't know what I pressed.

1273
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,440
Wait, am I high enough for a barrel roll?

1274
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:31,920
Okay, guys.

1275
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,520
The moment we get closer...

1276
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,080
What did I click?

1277
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,180
Were we sideways?

1278
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:52,880
The autopilot tried to realign me, so I'm like, oh my god,
was I unaligned this entire time?

1279
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:54,280
Please go higher?

1280
01:28:54,280 --> 01:29:02,660
but why it doesn't matter there's no people down there there
might be people in the flame there's no people there's no

1281
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,840
people down there they don't care

1282
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:17,940
i'm flying there's still 400 away oh my god this is gonna

all right guys i think we're doing pretty well see am i high

1289
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:23,880
enough in the sky i should be higher like i don't think it's
good that i can see the city like i don't think i just

1290
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,320
realized it might not be a good thing that the city is like
in my view.

1291
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,080
So maybe I should be a little higher, I feel like.

1292
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:33,740
Right?

1293
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,500
Yeah, I should not be able to see the city.

1294
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,700
Wait, are the gears down?

1295
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,720
Wait, what does that mean?

1296
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,500
What do you mean, what altitude am I on?

1297
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,960
Does it tell me what altitude I'm on?

1298
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,160
Why is it only a two?

1299
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:48,280
Okay, there it is.

1300
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,360
I see it's at the bottom right.

1301
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,420
You don't see it, but I see the altitude.

1302
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,000
I'm going to keep pulling up until the altitude.

1303
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,320
What's that sound?

1304
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,260
That's a good job sound, right?

1305
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,880
That should be the good job.

1306
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,620
Okay, I'm like 16,000.

1307
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,620
Okay, okay, here we go.

1308
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,080
Alright, here we go.

1309
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,340
I'm at 17,000 altitude now.

1310
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:11,820
Alright, here we go.

1311
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,660
Alright, this is good.

1312
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:14,160
That's good.

1313
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,580
I should be higher, though.

1314
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,800
I feel like I should be at like 20K, right?

1315
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:19,960
Half the fuel.

1316
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,300
It's been half the fuel this entire time.

1317
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:28,020
What is, like, the optimal amount of altitude that I should
be on?

1318
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,940
Because I'm at 17,000 right now.

1319
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,120
30k?

1320
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,480
Okay, we're so fucking far.

1321
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,800
Can I be...

1322
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,920
Can I turn on my autopilot?

1323
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,280
Is my autopilot on?

1324
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:41,900
No.

1325
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,080
Is my autopilot?

1326
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,240
What is my autopilot doing?

1327
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,340
What is it doing?

1328
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,700
Why is it going down?

1329
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,860
Autopilot, go back up.

1330
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,260
What is my autopilot doing?

1331
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,660
I turned off autopilot because I couldn't tell what they're
doing.

1332
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,000
I couldn't tell what it's doing.

1333
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,040
It was going down!

1334
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,000
It's flying around, but it's right there!

1335
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,340
It's right in front of me!

1336
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,480
Why would it change its course?

1337
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:16,280
Here's to your heading and altitude.

1338
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,940
The altitude, but we have to go up!

1339
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,980
We need to go up!

1340
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,400
I am doing a better job than...

1341
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,520
I wonder what does these do.

1342
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:30,720
I wonder what happens if I turn on all of these.

1343
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:33,280
Ooh.

1344
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,260
What's this?

1345
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:36,060
Oh, that's the brakes.

1346
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:36,860
I should not...

1347
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,820
I should not...

1348
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,080
I should not touch that.

1349
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,320
But, like, what are all these buttons, though?

1350
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,620
The rudder trim?

1351
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,320
What does this do?

1352
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,100
That's not good, right?

1353
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:51,600
The seat...

1354
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,740
Oh, turn on your seat bounce, everybody!

1355
01:32:53,740 --> 01:33:10,900
turn off your seat belts wait off i'm gonna turn it off guys
turn off your seat belts oh that's how they do it oh guys

1356
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:24,680

That's good.

01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,120
That's all we wanted.

1360
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,960
And then...

1361
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:30,780

I have to be sure that we're okay.

1367
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,300
Ooh, that's way too close.

1368
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:41,920
I don't want to...

1369
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,840
I don't want to look at the controls like that.

1370
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:46,680
Oh my god, it's still so far!

1371
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,320
Ooh, let me fix the controls here.

1390
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:29,660
What are these?

1391
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:31,560
Oh, cabin temperature!

1392
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,430
There we go.

1393
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:39,990
I gotta make sure we're extra nice and cozy.

1394
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:41,310
And then...

1395
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,550
There we go.

1396
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,910

Now everybody is nice and cozy.

1399
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:49,290
And then...

1400
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,670
Where all these buttons do?

1401
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:52,070

1404
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,870
That's what you want to hear your pilots say.

1405
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:01,450
What the fuck do all these buttons do?

1406
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:09,370
Cabin temperature, cargo temperature, APU starter.

1407
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:11,030

It's fine.

1417
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:35,640
We're fine.

1418
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,840
What do you mean we're going to crash?

1419
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,180
Did I turn off the engine?

1420
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,320
Oh, did I turn off?

1421
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,260

1425
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,660
We're still in the air.

1426
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,220
We're still in the air.

1427
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:05,280
Guys, how do I turn it back on?

1428
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,520

1429
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,540

01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:17,800
Is it the battery?

1432
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,460
Where is it?

1433
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,460

Passengers, welcome to Dokey Flight 69.

01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,610
What you just experienced was incredible turbulence.

1534
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:10,390
And it was just a very, very bad dream.

1535
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:14,970
So do not worry, we are still in the air, passengers.

1542
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:17,310
just going to go slowly up.

1543
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:19,310
Slowly higher.

1544
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:20,430
How do I change the...

1545
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:22,570
Okay, we're going to go slowly higher, guys.

1546
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:26,970
This plane will not crash when I'm on the pilot seat.

1547
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:29,550
I got to figure out how to land this plane, though.

1548
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,830
I skipped that in my...

1549
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:33,090
My teachers felt like I was doing so well.

1550
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:35,130
That...

1551
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:35,950
Oh, wait, wait.

1552
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,170
Can I do a barrel roll right now?

1553
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,210
I should be able to, right?

1554
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,510
How far I'm up.

1555
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:43,330
Okay, at 10,000 altitude, I'm going to try to do the barrel
roll.

1556
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,310
It should be fine, right?

1557
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:46,030
At 10,000.

1558
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:46,350
altitude?

1559
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:50,490
Guys, it should be fine.

1560
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:52,270
Nice.

1561
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:53,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1562
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:53,910
Thank you.

1563
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:54,950
Thanks for the nightmare.

1564
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:56,030
We're gonna be okay.

1565
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:58,490
We're gonna be so healthy.

1566
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:00,590
It'll be so funny.

1567
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:02,970
Okay, we're gonna do it at 10.

1568
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:04,990
That should be enough altitude.

1569
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:08,050
That should be enough, right?

1570
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:10,210
Right, guys?

1571
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:11,870
That should be enough.

1572
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:13,770
Oh, what does that sound?

1573
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:14,910
What does that sound mean?

1574
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:16,650
Okay, you ready?

1575
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,950
Watch this.

1576
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:25,630
Guys, this is a lot slower than I expected.

1577
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:30,210
We're still at 11,000 altitude.

1578
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:36,210
Good day to you too, ma'am.

1579
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:36,990
Good day.

1580
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:37,870
Oh.

1581
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,310
Oh.

1582
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:40,230
Oh.

1583
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:41,150
Oh.

1586
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:46,540
1,000.

1587
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:47,340
Pull up.

1588
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:47,660
Pull up.

1589
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,220
Pull up.

1590
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:50,040
Pull up!

1591
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:50,820
Pull up!

1592
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,100
We're okay!

1593
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:52,900
We're okay!

1594
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:53,380
We're okay!

1595
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,360
We're okay!

1596
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:56,300
Oh my god!

1597
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:03,860
I told you we're- I told you ten- oh my- I am a fucking
prodigy.

1598
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:12,800
Uh, passengers, make sure to fasten your seat belts.

1599
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:18,700
We are going- we- we're in a really, really, really bad
turbulence there.

1600
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,040
It is okay.

1601
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,760
We hope you enjoy your flight and Doki Airlines.

1602
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:25,440
Thank you.

1603
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,560
Guys, oh my god.

1604
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,520
That turbulence was fucking crazy, though.

1605
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,520
Am I going up?

1606
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,240
I'm going up, right?

1607
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:38,660
Yeah.

1608
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:41,220
That turbulence was insane.

1609
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:42,180
Air traffic.

1610
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,260

1611
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,180

That's good to know.

1636
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,000
I already thought about your safety.

1637
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,500
Oh, these buttons do.

1638
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,400
So, what do these buttons do?

1639
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:03,780
Oh, no.

1640
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,900
Go back up.

1641
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,640
I need a throttle.

1642
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:07,980
Okay.

1643
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,660
I'm gonna keep going.

1644
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,320
Just a little.

1645
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:16,800
Wait, 15k altitude.

1646
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:17,840
That's not...

1647
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:18,420
Oh, but...

1648
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,040
But what if, okay, I'm going to drive lower.

1649
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:21,280
I think it'll be so funny.

1650
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:26,020
If I drive, like, what is, like, the lowest that I can go,
like, altitude-wise?

1651
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:27,760
Like, 10K?

1652
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:29,900
Or 5K?

1653
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:30,860
Okay.

1654
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,840
What's the lowest?

1655
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:42,100
It'll be immersive!

1656
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,340
Above the ground.

1657
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:44,720
Okay.

1658
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,480
Does it affect my speed?

1659
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,420
It's not like it's going to affect my speed anyway.

1660
01:49:48,440 --> 01:50:04,880
way i still have like 330 it's so far it's so please don't
pay for altitude sorry guys you cheapen out doki airlines

1661
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:12,460
you guys you guys cheapen out on the tickets oh my god okay
we're landing our plan on fucking peter lee airfield this is

1662
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:19,080
way too far all right fine fine we'll go to 100 feet.

1663
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,700
We'll go to this airline.

1664
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,920
We'll go to your original destination.

1665
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,420
Oh, lower the higher altitude, the faster.

1666
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,580
Guys, you should have said that in the first place.

1667
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:29,700
Then I'll go higher.

1668
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:31,400
There you go.

1669
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:35,440
Request clearance to transition Charlie.

1670
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,060
We're going to go to...

1671
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,480
You guys need to tell me that earlier.

1672
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:41,980
If I knew that earlier, incorrect high altitude.

1673
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,660
How do I reset that?

1674
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,360
Am I okay?

1675
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,020
Charlie Airspace.

1676
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,040
Don't answer that.

1677
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:57,580
We're going to space.

1678
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,780
We're going to the moon.

1679
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,120
Hello passengers.

1680
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:09,460
There has been a correction regarding our flight path.

1681
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,280
We are now going to the moon.

1682
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,020
Thank you.

1683
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,160
I know we hope you enjoy your time at Tokyo Airlines.

1684
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:17,340
Alright, now they'll know.

1685
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:18,420
Oh, what's that sound?

1686
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:21,480
I don't like it when I don't know what the sound is.

1687
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,260
No, we missed.

1688
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:25,160
No, our airport's still there.

1689
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,540
We just need to go higher.

1690
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:30,660
To the moon, we go.

1691
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:34,320
So, you need an altitude adjustment.

1692
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,320
What does that even mean?

1693
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:36,520
Thank you, little super chat.

1694
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:36,880

All right.

1698
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,240
I wonder if I can let me go higher.

1699
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:43,120
Ooh, I don't like that sound.

1700
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,380
All right.

1701
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,440
You're an airliner?

1702
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,200
Enterprise.

01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:30,680
Guys, how do I...

1708
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:40,160
Guys, where do I check regarding, like, my POV?

1709
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,640
Is it the camera?

1710
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:46,140
How do I change my POV, chat?

1711
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:51,160
Guys, how do I change the POV?

1712
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:58,620
That's a very...

1713
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,480
Is it the camera?

1714
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:01,700
Okay.

1715
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:02,520
External.

1716
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:04,160
Alright, let's check.

1717
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,560
No, see?

1718
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,180

1720
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,260
I know what I'm doing.

1721
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:14,940
Guys, I know exactly what I'm doing.

1722
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,720
Alright, let's just look up from here.

1723
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,040
There we go.

1724
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:23,260
Whoa, the turbulence is hitting hard.

1725
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,180
Look at that.

1726
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,100

We should be fine.

1731
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:39,400
Whoa.

1732
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:44,160
We need to go up the altitude.

1733
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:46,980
We're still like, we're at 18K right now.

1734
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:48,420
Okay, can I like go?

1735
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:58,320

least 30k right 30k is the i can still see the city though

1736
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:07,940

No worries.

1740
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,100
It's fine.

1741
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,960
It's not stalling at all.

1742
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,280
Alright, 20k is good.

1743
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:34,520
It can be higher, right?

1744
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:36,260
My lunch.

1745
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,600
Guys, I'm sorry.

1746
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,580
We're experiencing some really, really, really bad
turbulence.

1747
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:45,580
Are the engines supposed to be near red?

1748
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:45,900
Yeah.

1749
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,420
Because we want to be faster and higher.

1750
01:54:49,800 --> 01:55:00,000
35k is the norm okay we're gonna go up to the moon we go we
go higher i wanted to get up turkey for spooky wild ride

1751
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:14,980
look we're going faster we're going higher we're at 23 000
let's go i think we can go higher i think we can go higher

1752
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:16,580
We're going even higher.

1753
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,160
Full speed engine.

1754
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:20,220
We have so much fuel.

1755
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,280
We're still only at 50% fuel.

1756
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,340
24.

1757
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:27,900
Oh my god, we're going to be so high up now.

1758
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,200
30.

1759
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,600
We're going to go to space.

1760
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,060
Can we actually go to space?

1761
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,800
What happens if we go to like 40?

1762
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,520
How many altitude is space?

1763
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:41,800
Many.

1764
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1765
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:43,340
Thank you.

01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:43,920
Thank you.

1767
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:45,480
Correct.

1768
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:47,100
Oh, my gosh.

1769
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:47,840
What do you mean?

1770
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:48,540
Incorrect.

1771
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:50,080
Incorrect.

1772
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,100
High altitude.

1773
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:52,280
Ooh.

1774
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,060
Ooh, I don't like that.

1775
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:55,940
Okay, here we go.

1776
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:56,300
Don't worry.

1777
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:57,060
I like it still.

1778
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,380
They're still going to go up.

1779
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:00,380
Okay.

1780
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,900
We still need to go up, guys.

1781
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:02,980
We're not there yet.

1782
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:04,720
Space is 100.

1783
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:05,140
Oh, my.

1784
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:06,060
Can I reach 100?

1785
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,060
Is that possible?

1786
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,040
Is that possible?

1787
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:14,420
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

1788
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:18,800
Thank you, thank you as someone who just recently been on a

1790
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:37,280
said the higher we go the higher we go the faster we are get
i feel like i feel like we're still like super fucking slow

1791
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:54,120
45 ks on max fucking cowards actual cowards oh my god we are
like 290 now it's gonna take fucking forever who told me to

1792
01:56:54,120 --> 01:57:00,360

1793
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:17,680
oh my god i'm just gonna go higher still we're gonna go up
higher higher We're going to go all the way to 30, and then

1794
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,600
we go all the way to 30, and then we go back in the cockpit.

1795
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,580
How am I not moving?

1796
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:25,320
Is it because, like, oh, I...

1797
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:25,800
Whoa.

1798
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:29,200
So all the luggage is on the tail now?

1799
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:34,780
Uh, alright, there we go.

1800
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:35,880
There we go.

1801
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:36,720
That should be good.

1802
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:40,820
We should be good now, right?

1803
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:44,960
Now that we're at 30, yeah, alright, we can change the
camera.

1804
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:59,060
now all right camera cockpit there you go nice we did it
yeah we fucking did it look at us go we're so good at this

1805
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:07,340
whole thing thing good thing that passengers didn't uh
didn't put on their seat belts all right that's it i'm

1806
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:10,740
fucking all right that's taking it how

1807
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:17,570
Can I turn it on?

1808
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:23,050
Why is whenever I turn on autopilot, it just goes to the
right?

1809
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:26,750
Why did I do that?

1810
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:27,550
Every time.

1811
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:31,330
Every time I turn on autopilot, it flies to the right.

1812
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:32,970
No, it's not.

1813
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:34,570
I'm fucking putting it on.

1814
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:38,650
I don't like that.

1815
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:39,690
We have to...

1816
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:41,230
We have to go here.

1817
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:46,270
I have to program the autopilot.

1818
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:54,850
then what's the point of having autopilot if I have the
program in myself what's the point of having AI if I still

1819
01:58:54,850 --> 01:59:04,350
have to do my own job like oh hey is that the landing gear
oh okay we figured it out we figured it out we know where

1820
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:14,070
the landing gear is all right guys there is a chance that
this pilot might just land in the ocean

1821
01:59:19,070 --> 01:59:23,230
There is there is a slight possibility

1822
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:40,030
There is a very judging by how far left we have There is a
great possibility that she is going to land in the ocean

1823
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:45,570
Because she does not have enough time before their meeting
on YouTube Just a little bit just a little possibility

1824
01:59:50,930 --> 02:00:00,530
just a little possibility we're not sure yet we're not we're
not sure yet but like judging by how fast we're going which

1825
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:04,070
is not as fast as i would have liked uh

1826
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:14,290
we'll be fine i'll have my landing gear on mr youtube is
waiting right now and like i'm gonna put my lat don't worry

1827
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:21,850
where's the landing gear i saw it here there you Landing
gear is on.

1828
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:27,070
Selected altitude.

1829
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:30,550
Can I get it higher?

1830
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,090
Okay.

1831
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:38,010
Oh, is this my autopilot?

1832
02:00:38,370 --> 02:00:40,390
Oh my god, it's 50,000 feet.

1833
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:41,610
That's my selected altitude.

1834
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:43,030
What is this?

1835
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:44,170
Vertical speed.

1836
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:46,970
Okay, and then...

1837
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:48,130
Are we in the water now?

1838
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:49,230
Is that the water?

1839
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:55,110
this has to be the water's blue oh this is not the water

1840
02:00:59,810 --> 02:01:12,450
let's see okay so this is speed uh caution okay I'm gonna
turn off the caution so I don't see it um if anything bad's

1841
02:01:12,450 --> 02:01:21,550
going on I won't be able to know if anything's bad going on
which would be great for me and then Oh, yeah, we're

1842
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:22,650
definitely...

1843
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:29,450
Guys, there is a possibility that I'm gonna land right here.

1844
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:31,450
There is a huge possibility.

1845
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:33,270
But before that...

1846
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:34,610
Okay, pilot.

1847
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:39,310
Before that, I gotta make sure...

1848
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:42,710
I'm gonna make sure to warn you guys first.

1849
02:01:43,090 --> 02:01:44,010
Alright, give me a sec.

1850
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:46,750
Uh...

1851
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:50,670
Don't worry.

1852
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:51,930
Don't worry.

1853
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:53,150
Give me a sec, guys.

1854
02:01:55,330 --> 02:01:57,270
I need to make sure that we are...

1855
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:58,750
We know that we are landing.

1856
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:00,890
Where is the...

1857
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:03,270
Where is the landing script here?

1858
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:08,090
Where the fuck is the landing script?

1859
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:09,510
Safety briefing.

1860
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:10,870
Captain's announcement.

1861
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:12,250
I don't need safety.

1862
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:13,670
We're so safe already.

1863
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:15,750
We're so safe.

1864
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:17,390
Why do I need safe?

1865
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:17,770
Okay.

1866
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:19,430
Flight...

1867
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:22,570
Flight landing pilot script.

1868
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:23,830
All right.

1869
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:27,490
Sample radio calls.

1870
02:02:27,910 --> 02:02:28,330
Departing.

1871
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:29,530
I don't need to know departing.

1872
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:31,030
I need to know, like, landing.

1873
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:37,010
Guys, we might be slowly going down, but it'll be okay.

1874
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:39,110
It'll be okay.

1875
02:02:39,190 --> 02:02:40,190
Guys, it'll be okay.

1876
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:41,730
We're slightly going down.

1877
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:42,930

02:05:25,170 --> 02:05:26,150
To retract.

1908
02:05:26,370 --> 02:05:26,790
No, no.

1909
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:29,570
We're going to have the landing gear of the sea ocean.

1910
02:05:30,730 --> 02:05:31,970
We got to land on the ocean.

1911
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,670

1917
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,350
I think I should be in the cockpit when I land in the ocean.

1918
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:53,410
I won't know what that's like.

1919
02:05:54,230 --> 02:05:54,450

02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:42,450
Okay, we gotta make sure we're aligning a bit better with
the ocean.

1928
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:44,750
Beyond the water, does it hurt?

1929
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:47,010
Okay, 100.

02:06:48,230 --> 02:06:49,710

plane.

1947

How are there more buttons?

2002
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:46,940
Where are these codes?

2003
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:49,680
How do I shoot the gun?

2004
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:55,570
Where's the shoot part?

2005
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:00,130

2019
02:11:30,990 --> 02:11:32,710
This is going to be fine.

2020
02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:34,450

Oh my god, I didn't realize there's just...

2049
02:14:45,330 --> 02:14:50,190
I'm surprised my PC was able to withstand all of that on
high settings.

2050
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:51,050
Not gonna lie.

2051
02:14:51,370 --> 02:14:56,330
I was like really worried because everybody was like, oh,
this is gonna PC stress test.

2052
02:14:56,450 --> 02:15:00,010
I was like, oh, what do you mean a PC stress test?

2053
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:01,050
I don't even have...

2054
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:05,770
I didn't even like plug it or take it out of my new PC out
of the box yet.

2055
02:15:05,870 --> 02:15:07,010
Because it's so much work.

2056
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:08,950
It's so much work.

2057
02:15:10,150 --> 02:15:11,950
But I really enjoyed it.

2058
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:17,190
That was like, I can't believe there's like multiplayer for
flight simulator.

2059
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:18,970
Like I can't believe.

2060
02:15:19,170 --> 02:15:22,570
I feel like people really hate me if I'm on the multiplayer.

2061
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:26,150
Because I don't take it seriously.

2062
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:30,690
I feel like I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna accidentally
like hit another plane.

2063
02:15:30,850 --> 02:15:32,150
And I'm gonna yell, get yelled.

2064
02:15:32,630 --> 02:15:39,130
I feel like I'm just accidentally gonna hit somebody's plane
in the sky.

2065
02:15:40,150 --> 02:15:41,270
make my own route.

2066
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:42,830
I don't even follow any route.

2067
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:44,390
I just make my own route.

2068
02:15:48,670 --> 02:15:54,530
Also, like, if I have a co-pilot, they would definitely not
like what I do.

2069
02:15:58,370 --> 02:16:05,770
Anyway, guys, in 12 minutes, I have to go to the YouTube
meeting, but I hope you guys have had a fun time watching

2070
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,250
today.

2071
02:16:06,710 --> 02:16:08,050
That was a really fun game.

2072
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:11,890
I definitely enjoyed how immersive It wasn't pressing all
those buttons.

2073
02:16:12,210 --> 02:16:16,090
I still don't know, like, 80% of the buttons I pressed
today.

2074
02:16:16,570 --> 02:16:18,310
I still don't know.

2075
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:19,650
I still don't know.

2076
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:23,010
80% whatever the fuck I pressed today.

2077
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:25,270
But I enjoyed myself.

2078
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:26,650
I enjoyed myself.

2079
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:31,830
Anyway, guys, I hope you guys enjoyed Joki Airlines and you
would choose our airline again for another flight.

2080
02:16:32,270 --> 02:16:35,110
As always, everybody, say hydrated, posture check.

2081
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:37,430
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2082
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:39,690
And if you stood up for me, head to bed.

2083
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:41,150
you deserve it.

2084
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:42,470
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2085
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:43,670
Bye, guys.

2086
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:44,530
Bye.
