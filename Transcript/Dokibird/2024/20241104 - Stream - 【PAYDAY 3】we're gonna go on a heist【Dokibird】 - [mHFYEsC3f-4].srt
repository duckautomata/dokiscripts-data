1
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,290
Hello everybody, I'm so sorry.

2
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,590
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

3
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,210
I even got... I was home early too.

4
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,550
And then... I'm sorry guys.

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,690
Oh my god, I can't... I was like trying to find my phone.

6
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,410
I was like, where's my phone?

7
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,670
Where did my phone go?

8
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,750
So I went downstairs to the lobby to call my phone and then the Uber driver picked up and was like, yeah, you left your phone.

9
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,530
I'm like, what the fuck?

10
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,430
I left my phone.

11
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,670
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,190
I went to get hotpot.

13
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,410
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,970
I wanted to eat nice.

15
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:14,090
I ate a $150 hotpot by myself and I just wanted to feel good.

16
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,470
I just... I just wanted to feel good.

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,730
And then I left my phone at the Uber.

18
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,350
It was... No, I had... I had Wagyu beef.

19
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,150
I had Wagyu beef with my hotpot.

20
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,350
And then I had beef balls and then I had pork.

21
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,610
No, it was a really nice hotpot.

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,410
It was... It was $150 Canadian.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,150
It was a really nice hotpot, guys.

24
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,910
You don't understand.

25
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,070
Today's my cheat day, guys.

26
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,390
Today is also my cheat day.

27
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,630
Today is a cheat week, but I just... I just wanted to feel good.

28
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,590
And then I left my Uber.

29
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,950
Dude, the fucking Uber driver like ransomed, like held my phone hostage.

30
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,150
He was like, can you give me $20 for me to drive back to give you your phone?

31
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,830
And like, I'm desperate.

32
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,350
I was... I was fucking desperate at that point.

33
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,430
So I was like, okay.

34
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,450
Yeah, because like I need my phone.

35
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,170
That's my... It's my stream phone.

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,190
I need... I need to get another phone.

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,910
I need... I need to get another actual phone.

38
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,450
I need another like phone with a SIM card in it.

39
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:43,690
Like, I can't have one phone because like one... My main phone with my SIM card and everything is my streaming phone as well.

40
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,170
So I was like, oh my God, I need another phone with... I need a phone with a SIM card.

41
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,070
And then he was like, yeah.

42
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,610
And then he's like, I'm almost there.

43
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,370
I'm almost... I'm almost home.

44
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,170
I'm almost there.

45
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,110
And I was like, sweet.

46
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,690
And then, you know, 10 to 15 minutes passed.

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,290
He's like, yeah, I'm almost there.

48
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,530
And I'm like, what do you mean?

49
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,370
I've been waiting... He's like, we'll get you... I'll give you your phone.

50
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,310
Like, you come downstairs now.

51
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,230
And I was like, okay.

52
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,570
And then I went downstairs.

53
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,550
Where is he?

54
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,330
Where...

55
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,970
Where is he?

56
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,730
He wasn't there.

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,970
He wasn't there, guys.

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,950
Also, yeah, I just wanted to talk to my chat after getting my phone back.

59
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:28,930
I told Tengen.

60
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,130
Anyway, Tengen.

61
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,690
Tengen, you can come in.

62
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,110
It's time to chill.

63
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,830
Huge shout out, by the way.

64
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,470
Huge thank you to Payday 3 for the sponsor.

65
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,610
This is... Hey, Tengen.

66
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,790
Are you ready to chill with me?

67
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,930
I gave him the notes on what to say.

68
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,910
Are you ready?

69
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,570
You know what to say?

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,830
I said most of the things already.

71
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,590
Oh, you did?

72
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,670
You said most of the stuff?

73
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,850
Okay, now say the stuff again for me.

74
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,230
Hey, man.

75
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,550
I'm not part of...

76
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,150
Hey, man.

77
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,490
Hey, I said I'd give you a cut.

78
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,250
I said...

79
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,370
Read the script, Tengen.

80
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,250
Read the script.

81
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,810
Yes, there is.

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,290
I barely gave you talking points.

83
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,390
But yeah, the obvious update.

84
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,530
Definitely the UI.

85
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,470
I like it better on the main screen as it was before.

86
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,850
Definitely very cool.

87
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,050
And you know what's cool?

88
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,810
47% on discount.

89
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,630
Steve, go grab the game right now.

90
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,490
Oh my god, but you got the game for free.

91
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,750
Yeah, shout out to Gokibird.

92
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,530
Yeah, I sent him... I got the game for free too, guys.

93
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,690
I have the game.

94
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,510
She gave me the next edition.

95
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,590
Yeah, I gave him the one year anniversary.

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,110
But yeah, anyway, guys.

97
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,090
So, Payday 3 actually went through an insane new update for the first year anniversary.

98
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,990
So, if you played Payday 3 before, it's gonna be very different now.

99
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,470
So, they have like... What was it?

100
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,630
They have new voice.

101
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,230
In-game voice, right?

102
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,690
They have new server browsers, new menu UI, and Halloween mask as well.

103
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,950
So, a lot of new stuff.

104
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,850
There's a new server browser.

105
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,150
So, it's more easy to find servers that you wanna find.

106
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,810
And then, there's also like... It just looks very new.

107
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,850
And there's a lot of new missions too, right, Tenjin?

108
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,890
I feel like you're... The reason why I got Tenjin is because I didn't wanna play by myself.

109
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,610
And like... And also, he has a lot of hours in Payday in general.

110
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,270
My brother does.

111
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,510
You said you have a lot as well, didn't you?

112
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,590
Well, how much do I have in Payday 2?

113
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:43,850
Hold on.

114
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,890
You have more than me.

115
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,610
I have... Okay, this account has 145.

116
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,650
Let's see my old account.

117
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,030
Wait, what do you mean old account?

118
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,790
That's your...

119
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,170
I have 1,100.

120
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:56,810
What the fuck?

121
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,750
Holy...

122
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,330
I've spent that much on Payday 2?

123
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,770
Oh my god!

124
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,570
Wait, that's a lot.

125
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,910
Too much.

126
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,090
Yeah, that's a lot.

127
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,830
That's why I dragged Tenjin in here.

128
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,510
Cause like, he knows what he's doing.

129
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,330
He's a goddamn veteran.

130
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,770
Yeah, but there's like a lot of new stuff now.

131
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,090
And you can get it now on like...

132
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,590
What is it?

133
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,310
It's available now on PC, Playstation 5, and Xbox Series.

134
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,470
And if you click on the link in the description and...

135
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,930
Or pinned on the comment, it really does help the stream a lot.

136
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,790
And it just leads you to Payday 3.

137
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,050
But yeah, anyway.

138
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,810
Alright, Tenjin.

139
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,510
What do we do?

140
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,970
Let's start a heist.

141
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,270
Also, Sound Guy, I upped the volume a little bit.

142
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,310
So let me know if it's better.

143
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,790
Yeah, it's on sale.

144
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,550
Yeah, only if you click my link will it tell you it's on sale.

145
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,850
Alright, let's try some...

146
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,430
Plan heist, yada yada.

147
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,050
Okay, we're not doing stealth.

148
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,210
What?

149
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,110
You don't believe in me?

150
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,190
No.

151
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:04,870
What?

152
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,790
You don't believe in me, Tenjin?

153
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,210
Excuse me.

154
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,550
90% of the time on Payday 2 heist time...

155
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,950
Yeah?

156
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,290
Where I stealth, it's usually solo.

157
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,070
It's never with anyone.

158
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,830
Okay, I'll break that streak, Tenjin.

159
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,110
I will break that streak.

160
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,610
It'll be different, trust me.

161
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,790
It'll be so different.

162
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,250
Trust me, Tenjin.

163
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,890
It'll be so different.

164
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,270
Well, hold on.

165
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,070
Is this the...

166
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,870
Wait, did I queue for...

167
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,570
What did you queue for?

168
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,450
Did I made it a fucking... hold on.

169
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,970
Wait, what did you do?

170
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,170
You already fucked...

171
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,150
Tenjin, we're sponsored.

172
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,110
You already fucked it up.

173
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,170
No, I was... I actually put like the hardest difficulty.

174
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,230
Oh, wait, no.

175
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,990
Is that normal?

176
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,730
Yeah, no.

177
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,490
I was queuing for normal.

178
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,030
You know what?

179
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,210
Let's pump it up by one.

180
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,010
Let's go harder.

181
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,330
Wait, you're trying to... Wait, what?

182
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,330
What do you mean?

183
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:01,850
What?

184
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,270
Why not?

185
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:02,990
Why not?

186
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,770
This is stealth.

187
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,910
No, fuck you.

188
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,670
You don't even have a suppressor.

189
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,390
You don't even have a suppressor.

190
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,710
Do you have a suppressor?

192
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,370
Do you?

193
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,190
Yes, I do.

194
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,530
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

195
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,590
I do have a suppressor.

196
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,970
Okay, let's try it then.

197
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,090
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

198
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,150
I do have a suppressor.

199
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,970
I do have it.

200
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,290
Trust me.

201
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,590
Alright.

202
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,710
Alright, alright.

203
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,590
I do have it.

204
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,710
What do you mean?

205
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,910
Okay, okay.

206
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,490
It's like right there.

207
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,290
Are you sure we're up for it though?

208
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,710
Yeah, yeah, I think we can do it.

209
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,230
We can do it.

210
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,570
Oh, I almost left the lobby.

211
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,870
Why are you talking in game?

212
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,250
I'm talking in game as well.

213
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,990
Oh, wait, that's a new update.

214
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,910
We're just showcasing the new update, guys.

215
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,370
We're just showcasing the new update.

216
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,730
Yeah, new voice over IP in the game.

217
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,130
Oh my god, yeah, you can play with random.

218
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,870
With the voice over IP.

219
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:06,890
Yeah.

220
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,710
Yeah, right here.

221
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:17,930
Yeah, see, we're already showing you guys the differences in the updates of the new Payday 3, guys.

222
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,890
Yeah, oh my god.

223
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,070
Wait, you're level 48?

224
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,330
Yeah, I've played this game for a while.

225
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:25,850
What?

226
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,090
Oh my god.

227
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,350
No, I only played Payday 2.

228
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,970
Like, no, like last year when the game dropped, I played it for a little while.

229
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,010
Wait, so what does a suppressor look like?

230
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,590
Like a suppressor.

231
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,670
Okay, I'm ready.

232
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,790
I see the pain.

233
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,110
Alright, is this a stealth mission?

234
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,790
It's any, stealth is an optional kind of thing.

235
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,190
Okay, alright, what do we do?

236
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,230
I don't know, this is a new mission.

237
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,490
Oh, oh wait.

238
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,390
Holy shit, a lady just bumped into me.

239
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,030
I need to, I need to turn down my mouse sensitivity.

240
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,450
I forgot how high this game is.

241
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:11,790
Alright.

242
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,410
Let me disable view IP.

243
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,990
Oh my god, wait, we have, alright, we got wolf and chains in here.

244
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,090
Do you believe, how do you put on a mask again?

245
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,670
Gee, we're not putting a mask here.

246
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,970
But like, wouldn't it be funny though?

247
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,170
What is it?

248
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,370
What's the point of, I have a sentry.

249
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,850
Oh wait, what?

250
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,250
Put it down, it would be so funny.

251
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,590
No, I have to put on the mask.

252
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,730
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

253
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,170
Is the FOV okay?

254
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,690
I can, I don't know.

255
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,050
I said, Tenjin was like, oh, put FOV at 100.

256
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,710
And I was like, I don't know.

257
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,270
It feels weird.

258
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,430
What are you doing?

259
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,670
Oh, just bros being bros, guys.

260
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,910
I just zoomed in on his face.

261
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,070
Just bros being bros, what's wrong with that?

262
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,970
No, it should be like this.

263
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,730
This is not Roblox.

264
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,270
What do you mean?

265
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,590
100 is at 9.

266
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,750
90 feels disgusting, not gonna lie.

267
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,770
It's too much.

268
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,270
Yeah.

269
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,390
But you literally told me to put it at max.

270
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,470
I was trying things out.

271
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,730
You fucking liar.

272
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,190
Wait, that's not you, I'm talking to Wolf.

273
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,110
You fucking liar.

274
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,270
I was getting a hotdog.

275
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,850
What FOV are y'all?

276
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,710
78.

277
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,710
78, okay.

278
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,790
I'm putting it on 70.

279
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,250
You fucking liar.

280
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,430
I was like, oh, what should I do for FOV, Tenjin?

281
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,410
And you're just like, oh, just do max.

282
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,850
That's what everybody does.

283
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,870
And I was like, really?

284
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,550
That's what everybody does?

285
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,290
Alright, what do we do, Tenjin?

286
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,170
What was our mission?

287
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,030
I wasn't paying attention.

288
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,410
Oh, enter digital.

289
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,430
That's in front of us, right?

290
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,330
It should be, yes.

291
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,250
Yeah.

292
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,570
Scope out the lobby.

293
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,130
Hey, I'm walking in.

294
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,230
Is that really very low?

295
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,510
Okay, I'll do 78.

296
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,990
God, is this it?

297
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,990
We're not gonna be suspicious.

298
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,610
Okay.

299
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:25,670
Okay.

300
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,090
Delphine?

301
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,890
Hello, concert.

302
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,150
Disable the metal detector.

303
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,650
Do I have guns on me?

304
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,850
Yes, we do.

305
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,090
We are a heister.

306
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,470
Wouldn't it be funny if I just walked through the metal detector?

307
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,870
It would be funny, yes.

308
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,170
It would be so funny.

309
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,770
Where can we get in?

310
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,490
It would be so...

311
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,250
I pressed E.

312
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,530
There's a bathroom.

313
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,190
I accidentally pressed E.

314
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,630
Oh, hey.

315
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,810
I don't know what that was.

316
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,590
Unavailable?

317
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,590
I can't jump because I'm not...

318
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,150
Okay.

319
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,070
Oh, hi, wolf.

320
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,950
We can't get in here.

321
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,730
Okay, we gotta...

322
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,870
Okay, you closed the door.

323
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,270
Alright, I'm doing it.

324
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:04,710
I'm ready.

325
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,490
You ready?

326
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,270
Let's go.

327
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,170
I'm venting.

328
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:10,690
Alright.

329
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,870
I don't know what E does.

330
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,390
I have, like, a phone with an I on it.

331
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,990
I don't know where I'm going.

332
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,070
I'm following you.

333
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,930
Like, seriously, I've never played this heist.

334
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,070
That's why we're experiencing it.

335
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,590
To celebrate first year anniversary.

336
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,690
Oh, I disabled the metal detector.

337
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,350
Wait.

338
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,190
Is it both?

339
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,030
Am I cutting both?

340
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm cutting both.

341
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,750
We did it!

342
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,290
Wait, how do we get through?

343
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,710
I think our bots were supposed to get through.

344
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,130
I think one of us should have been in the metal detector.

345
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,790
One of us should have!

346
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,690
One of us!

347
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,730
One of us should have not put on the mask.

348
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,930
One of us should have not put on the mask.

349
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,110
Yeah, one of us should definitely not put on the mask.

350
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,630
Oh, he saw you.

351
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,350
I'm watching.

352
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,150
Oh my god, what if I shoot him?

353
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,670
No, don't.

354
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,090
Why not?

355
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,110
That would be so funny.

356
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,070
That would be so funny.

357
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,430
What are you gonna do?

358
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,370
Oh my god!

359
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,650
No!

360
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,290
No!

361
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,170
Why?

362
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,730
I'm just telling him to move.

363
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,670
What were you doing to that poor civilian?

364
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,610
What were you doing to him?

365
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,070
Nothing!

366
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,350
What were you doing to him?

367
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,510
I'm gonna put him out of his misery.

368
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,230
Now he has trauma because of you!

369
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,030
Oh shit, that's a long-ass block there.

370
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,470
You know what?

371
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,170
Okay, no, he's fine.

372
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,430
See?

373
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,790
You okay, sir?

374
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,090
I don't think he's okay.

375
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,650
He's not even...

376
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,510
He's suing!

377
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,810
He's gonna sue!

378
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,670
Oh my god, look what you did!

379
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,490
He's gonna sue!

380
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,950
You're gonna go to jail!

381
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,530
You're gonna go to jail for maximum life.

382
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,970
I saw what you did.

383
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,610
I'm gonna be a witness to this.

384
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,730
No, you're not in the witness protection program.

385
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,690
I know what you did.

386
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,610
No, you did not.

387
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,730
I know what you did.

388
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,610
I saw what you did.

389
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,470
Hold on, is this a lobby?

390
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,310
This is a lobby.

391
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,150
Wait, I don't...

392
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,390
Wait.

393
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,670
Oh shit, it's the code.

394
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,730
Nevermind, it's coded.

395
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,090
Wait, what are you doing?

396
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,290
How did he not see us?

397
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,770
Don't worry about it.

398
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,190
How did he not see us?

399
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,490
He was literally right there!

400
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,450
Nah, he didn't see anything.

401
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,590
We all saw you, Daniel.

402
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,290
We all saw you.

403
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,710
He didn't see shit.

404
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,590
I know what you did last summer.

405
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,570
That's crazy.

406
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,830
The camera.

407
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,930
The camera is...

408
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,410
Stop looking this way, camera, please.

409
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,570
How do we make it stop?

410
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,950
Oh, the guy is coming up.

411
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,790
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,410
Get him too.

413
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:52,910
Get him too.

414
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,770
Come on.

415
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,110
Grab him.

416
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,070
Why not?

417
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,990
Because we'll have to answer a radio.

418
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,670
Then answer it.

419
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,970
I can answer radios.

420
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,650
No, there's a maximum amount of radios we can answer.

421
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,470
So we cannot kill every guard.

422
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,590
Oh shit, I have to read.

423
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,570
Wait, I need to up the game a little bit.

424
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,470
You go do the heist.

425
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,490
I'm upping the game volume.

426
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,470
I'm doing streamer things.

427
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,550
Right.

428
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,570
Okay, I upped the game a little bit.

429
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,290
Alright, I'm heading over.

430
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,390
Is it safe for me to head over?

431
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,870
Daniel, is it safe for me to head over, Daniel?

432
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,890
They almost fucked up.

433
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,730
There's a guard.

434
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,210
They almost fucked up.

435
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,170
Oh my

436
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,470
god, he's so stupid.

437
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,370
Oh, she saw me.

438
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,510
Did he see you?

439
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,550
No, he just heard something.

440
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,170
That means he heard something.

441
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,950
Josh, why are you looking this way?

442
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,010
Just sprint over here.

443
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,710
Don't worry about it.

444
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,430
Sprint over here.

445
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,230
What if I just walk over?

446
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,110
Yeah, you're fine.

447
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,510
You're fine.

448
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,530
You're fine.

449
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,710
You fucker.

450
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,130
You fucker.

451
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:12,770
You fucker.

452
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,630
I'm gonna shoot the gun.

453
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,110
I'm gonna do it.

454
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,910
I'm gonna shoot the gun right now.

455
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,350
You think I won?

456
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,490
You think I won?

457
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,930
You know I'm crazy enough to shoot the gun.

458
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,390
Pull book.

459
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:29,950
Oh, button.

460
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,610
Oh, what does it do?

461
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,190
Can you press that?

462
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,270
I don't know.

463
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,310
Is that the basement door code?

464
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,750
Is that it?

465
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,230
What is this?

466
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,230
I don't know.

467
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,830
I'm figuring out.

468
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,070
What does this button do?

469
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,650
Watch this.

470
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,770
Did you just... Did you just open our window?

471
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,710
Did you just open our window?

472
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,650
I can't see shit, you know.

473
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,810
Did you just open our window?

474
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,630
Wouldn't it be funny if the guard was out there?

475
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,310
Did you just open our window?

476
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,910
No, no.

477
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,630
No, I didn't.

478
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,730
7-8-2-5.

479
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,070
Wait, how did you figure out the code?

480
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,010
How did you do it?

481
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,230
It's right there.

482
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,930
Where did you... No, I meant the save.

483
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,990
How did you crack the save?

484
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,990
Oh, um, you just move until it wiggles.

485
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,410
Oh, what?

486
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,190
Yeah, you just move it.

487
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,270
What if I... I'm gonna click it.

488
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,290
I'm gonna...

489
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,530
Yeah, click it, click it, click it.

490
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,030
I'm gonna click it.

491
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,450
Click.

492
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,330
I'm gonna click it.

493
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,650
See, you don't... He's dumb as shit.

494
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,410
Yeah, he is.

495
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,630
He is pretty fucking dumb.

496
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,670
I'm gonna check other rooms, okay?

497
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,310
Alright.

498
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,650
I'm right behind you.

499
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,030
See, I told you I could stealth.

500
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,170
Oh, oh, what are you gonna do?

501
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,330
What you gonna do?

502
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,810
What you gonna do when he finds out?

503
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,340
Oh, he's fucking stupid.

504
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,020
Oh, he is.

505
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Okay, here, hold on.

506
00:19:59,500 --> 00:19:59,780
Okay.

507
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
He'll be alert in a place.

508
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,720
He'll look at that sign on your right and just go here.

509
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,140
Where do I go?

510
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,120
Alright, come here, come here, come here, come here.

511
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,680
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

512
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,360
I did it.

513
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,420
Oh my god, I'm a professional.

514
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
This is why we got Tenjin here.

515
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,200
He makes it look so easy.

516
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,720
So when you watch this gameplay...

517
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,360
Oh fuck, that's the lobby.

518
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,220
You're gonna be like...

519
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,240
Oh shit, that's outside.

520
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,400
Now, now when you look at... you look at this gameplay and you're like, wow, it's just that easy?

521
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,140
Why don't we go upstairs?

522
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,680
That's the lobby.

523
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,660
I'm not going to the lobby.

524
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Alright, guard is still there.

525
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,900
I'm rolling over.

526
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,380
Just print.

527
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,140
What if they hear me?

528
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Just slide over.

529
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,980
Oh my god, this is... oh my god, how is this working?

530
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,360
Why won't they just hear... I like how our bots are just there.

531
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,720
They're in the toilet.

532
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,780
7, 8, 2, 5.

533
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,800
How does he not see you?

534
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,760
7, 8, 2, 5.

535
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,200
Just get on.

536
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,640
Come on.

537
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,240
What if he sees me?

538
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,880
He won't.

539
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,100
Oh my god, did we just... okay, goodbye chains and wolf.

540
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,220
You're just making sure...

541
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,820
Things are not going wrong.

542
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,680
Is everything going to be okay, Tenjin?

543
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,480
We need a red keycard.

544
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,740
Alright, the game is just that easy, guys.

545
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,080
What can I say?

546
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,560
The game is...

547
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,080
Surely it's easy.

548
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,500
Guys, it's just that easy.

549
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,420
Look at that.

550
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,460
Let me just scope out the place real quick.

551
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,620
Okay, wow, there's a lot of guards.

552
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,700
And a drone.

553
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,360
There is?

554
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,380
Wait, how are you scoping it out?

555
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm looking through the camera.

556
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
You have a camera?

557
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,680
How did you use it?

558
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,600
I'm a hacker, man.

559
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,560
Oh, you're a hack?

560
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,000
Alright.

561
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,580
Alright.

562
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,580
Is this a door?

563
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,600
This is a door.

564
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Wait, this is...

565
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
That should wait.

566
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,560
Wait, wait, wait, the camera.

567
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,360
Shit.

568
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,920
Oh, shit.

569
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:24,860
Okay.

570
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,920
Oh my god, never mind.

571
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,600
The camera spotted me.

572
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,780
Oh my god, look at him go.

573
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,240
We're loud.

574
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,960
We're loud.

575
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,580
Fuck, what did you do?

576
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,280
A camera was there.

577
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,940
Oh my god, Tenshin, what did you do?

578
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,080
Alright, now or never.

579
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,440
Can I shoot the drone?

580
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,340
Can we shoot the drone?

581
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,660
Yeah, shoot the drone.

582
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,300
Alright.

583
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,420
Get down, get down!

584
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,540
How do I make him get down?

585
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,740
I'm scared I'll shoot him.

586
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,720
Get down!

587
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,900
That's right, you're gonna need my human shield.

588
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,520
That's right.

589
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,620
That's right, I've got somebody.

590
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,040
Oh, you can pick that up now.

591
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,860
That's cool.

592
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,720
Alright.

593
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,420
Trade one hostage to delay.

594
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,580
Oh, we have a hostage!

595
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,360
F1 right here!

596
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,860
You have to go upstairs.

597
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,920
Are you serious?

598
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay, no, I'm not.

599
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,240
I can't.

600
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,140
That's too much.

601
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Tie him up.

602
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,100
Oh, you can do that now!

603
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
Alright, cool.

604
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,160
Get him, get him, get him!

605
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,140
Can we take him up?

606
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,280
Just tie him up.

607
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,020
No, just tie him up.

608
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,520
Just tie him up.

609
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,920
Oh, just tie him up?

610
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,920
Then you'll press F.

611
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,760
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

612
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,640
Wait, how come you killed so many people?

613
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,400
There's guards.

614
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm gonna try and find more people.

615
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,400
Who has the red keycard?

616
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,700
I don't fucking know!

617
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm gonna find more hostages!

618
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,140
Oh no, everything is locked up.

619
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,620
Everything is locked up, Tengen.

620
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,400
Look what you did.

621
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320
This is your fault.

622
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,720
What?

623
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,220
This is your fault!

624
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,340
You're supposed to be a master!

625
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Nah, I never played this mission.

626
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,100
Clueless.

627
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,720
This just...

628
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:50,940
What?

629
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,280
Oh, they're coming, they're coming, they're coming.

630
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,480
Oh no.

631
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,600
Where the fuck is the red?

632
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,540
Where the fuck is the red keycard?

633
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,220
I'm trying to find a red keycard everywhere.

634
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,260
Oh my god, no.

635
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,240
No, there's...

636
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,740
Wait, wait, wait.

637
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,500
Wait, there's a vent.

638
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,320
Oh my god, we could have used this vent.

639
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,480
We could have...

640
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,580
We could have used this vent!

641
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,260
I don't think we can.

642
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
I don't think we can anymore.

643
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,980
That's fine.

644
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,500
Oh no, we got the SWAT.

645
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,980
Hey, it's just SWATs.

646
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,420
You have higher armor than me, so I'm sure you can handle this, right?

647
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,620
Thank you, DS.

648
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,800
Wait, there's another vent here.

649
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,780
What's the red?

650
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,740
We have a red keycard.

651
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,620
No, no, no.

652
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Where the fuck is the red keycard?

653
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,700
I think it might be upstairs.

654
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,560
It's not.

655
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,260
I was scoping the whole area.

656
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
No, no, there's a way to go upstairs somehow.

657
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:54,960
Seriously?

658
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,340
There's like an upstairs area.

660
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,220
It's blocked with keycard.

661
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,940
No, the vent area.

662
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,100
I feel like we need something to cut the vent.

663
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,160
I think we didn't have... Oh, I wish we could control our bots.

664
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh my god, I wish we could control... Get out of here.

665
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,340
Get out.

666
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,380
Get out of here.

667
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,800
Taser, I'm being tased.

668
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,620
You're fine.

669
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,620
You're fine.

670
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,240
You're so healthy.

671
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,920
There's a lot of people.

672
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, there is.

673
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,260
There is.

674
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
Oh, I'm getting hit by random stuff now.

675
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,840
Wait, who's this?

676
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,220
Oh, wait.

677
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,920
Oh, shit.

678
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,040
I have purple armor.

679
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,560
It's fine.

680
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,820
What is this, Apex?

681
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,000
I have purple armor.

683
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,980
I was wondering if I could like press these.

684
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,000
We're like walking around, but like...

685
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,960
Where do we go?

686
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,640
We need a red keycard.

687
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,200
Oh, I found it.

688
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,640
I found it.

689
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:58,660
I found it.

690
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,040
I found it.

691
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,840
Oh, you found it.

692
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,360
Alright, let's go.

693
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,260
It was like over here where I was.

694
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

695
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,600
I found it.

696
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,000
I found it.

697
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,460
Alright, alright, alright.

698
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,280
There's a door right here.

699
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,040
There's a door right here.

700
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,140
QR code required.

701
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,800
Okay, never mind.

702
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,480
That's a QR code.

703
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,180
No, go up here.

704
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,580
Go up here, up here.

705
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,500
Wait, here.

706
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:15,860
Where are you?

707
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
Right here, right here, right here.

708
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,240
Oh, where?

709
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,160
Wait, how did they get up here?

710
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,320
They don't have a red keycard.

711
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,240
Who knows?

712
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,680
Oh my god, shut down SINs.

713
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,640
What the fuck is this?

714
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,120
Is this SINs?

715
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,680
Is this SINs?

716
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,640
Oh, this is, this is, this is.

717
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,200
Okay, okay.

718
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,460
I picked something up.

719
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,740
This is... Oh, it's armor repair.

720
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,420
Oh, I can swap the camera.

721
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,040
Okay, nice.

722
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,540
This is like...

723
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,300
You're looking at the camera.

724
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

725
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,740
I mean, we can just stay here.

726
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,720
How did he get there?

727
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,640
We could've stealthed this.

728
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
That's all I'm saying.

729
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,660
We could've.

730
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,700
We could've stealthed this.

731
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,880
Wait,

732
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,620
what?

733
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,580
Cooling system?

734
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,160
Oh, I got you guys.

735
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,960
Um...

736
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,120
It always has.

737
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,080
Yeah, I'm sure.

738
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,400
Like, I know.

739
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,640
I know.

740
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,000
I know.

741
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,300
I know.

742
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
I know there is.

743
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,760
I know there is.

744
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,980
I'm fucking...

745
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm fucking Isaac Newton.

746
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,680
Invent the dash shit.

747
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,340
I can't believe gravity was discovered today, guys.

748
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,100
I can't believe I discovered gravity.

749
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,860
Whoa.

750
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
Holy shit.

751
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,920
Okay, Trey.

752
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,300
Get over here.

753
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,000
You go fucking do your thing.

754
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,100
What other stuff do we need to...

755
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,800
Wait, there's something over there that I have to do.

756
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,880
It's at 30 meters.

757
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm right here.

758
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,160
I'm defending it.

759
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
How do we...

760
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,020
How do we, like, get police hostages again?

761
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,300
I think you need a skill for police hostages.

762
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,300
God damn it.

763
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,880
My skills right now is just full stealth build right now.

764
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,560
Do I have to do this again?

765
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,240
No, you're just defending it so the cops don't meddle with it.

766
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,160
I have a sentry that's guarding this, so...

767
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,380
God damn it.

768
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,160
If I could go back in time, I would kill Isaac Newton so he wouldn't invent gravity.

769
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,260
Yeah, we could have had creative mode, man.

770
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,260
I know.

771
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:32,860
We could have been...

772
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,300
We could have no clip mode.

773
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,540
We could have been no clipping.

774
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,880
We could have no clip to Mars at this point.

775
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,480
People were always like, If I could time travel, I would kill this specific person that did all this stuff.

776
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,720
But I'd be like, no, I'm gonna kill Isaac Newton.

777
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,760
Alright, I'm disabling the sins.

778
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,520
If we had...

779
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,720
Just think about how much Isaac Newton has robbed us.

780
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,880
Oh, shit.

781
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,400
What the fuck?

782
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,420
Oh, there they are.

783
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Wait, how do I get rid of this guy?

784
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
The guy with the shield?

785
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,090
I'm gonna run up to him and then...

786
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm calling in my overkill weapon.

787
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,480
Oh, shit!

788
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,860
He doesn't like it when I... He doesn't like...

789
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,820
Oh, police assaulted.

790
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,500
This is police brutality, my man.

791
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,840
Oh my god, get down!

792
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,780
Get down!

793
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,860
Wait, oh my god, wait.

794
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,660
He has a different... He has a different outfit.

795
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,600
He's a special unit.

796
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,860
What makes him so special?

797
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,400
He electrocutes your nipples.

798
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,320
Oh, shit.

799
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,140
Does it feel good?

800
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,940
I wouldn't know that.

801
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,040
Why don't you know that?

802
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,160
I thought you were into that.

803
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,640
What do you know about me?

804
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,530
What is that?

805
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,290
What is that?

806
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,990
Woah, woah.

807
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,250
Is the game okay, sound guy?

808
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,170
Oh, shit.

809
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,310
Is the game okay?

810
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,090
Is the music not too loud?

811
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,410
Oh, the music is good.

812
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:24,810
I love the music.

813
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,430
You know what?

814
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,390
I'll increase the music.

815
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,910
This game is a soundtrack, by the way.

816
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,730
Yeah, the music soundtrack is insane.

817
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,490
That guy has a bomb.

818
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,590
Wait, where?

819
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,950
Where?

820
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,590
Throwing knife!

821
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,570
You have a throwing knife?

822
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,350
Yeah, I do.

823
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,330
Oh, shit!

824
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,330
Oh, shit!

825
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,730
I shot the spikes.

826
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,270
I might be bleeding out of my ass right now.

827
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,830
I'm not doing so well.

828
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,310
I think I might need to see a doctor.

829
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,910
I think taking fall damage might have landed on my head.

830
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,050
Wait, does this need a keycard?

831
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,190
I might have a concussion.

832
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,830
Not gonna lie.

833
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,870
You dropped yourself when you were young.

834
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,690
No, I forgot the real world had fall damage.

835
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,050
I played too many video games.

836
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
I need a keycard.

837
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
I need a keycard.

838
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,000
Get over here.

839
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,700
Wait, where?

840
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,100
Where?

841
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,740
Over here?

842
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,080
Over here.

843
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,980
Over where I am.

844
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,380
Oh, my god.

845
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,300
Okay, there's a lot of people in front of me.

846
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,980
I'm shooting them through the walls.

847
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,720
Don't worry about it.

848
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,340
Okay, give me a sec.

849
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,360
I'm refilling my health.

850
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,420
Nice.

851
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,760
The police dropped some HP.

852
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,040
Alright.

853
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,460
That makes sense.

854
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,720
Yeah.

855
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,120
Nice.

856
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:45,880
Thank god.

857
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,580
I'm coming over.

858
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,180
I'm coming over.

859
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,980
Don't worry.

860
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,520
Righto.

861
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,500
Oh, there's so much ammo.

862
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:53,980
Alright.

863
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,400
How do I get up there?

864
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,540
How did you get up there?

865
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,860
There's a stair.

866
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,420
Oh, shit.

867
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,660
Okay.

868
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,080
Have you taken one?

869
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,580
Okay.

870
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,360
No.

871
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,460
I took an Uber.

872
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,420
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

873
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,900
I'm pretty sure you've never.

874
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,520
Hey, I'm here.

875
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,340
Okay, guys.

876
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
I'll hack the computer.

877
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,140
I'll turn the valve.

878
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,120
Wait, is there friendly fire?

879
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,120
With a grenade, I think.

880
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,700
Okay.

881
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,020
Did you get hurt?

882
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:24,860
No.

883
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,220
Okay.

884
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,900
I tested.

885
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,320
There's friendly fire.

886
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,260
Overkill weapons ready when you are.

887
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,740
Are we defending?

888
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,800
Okay, yeah, we are.

889
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,440
We're just defending.

890
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:35,960
Oh, ender.

891
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,160
Private data off our server for hooks.

892
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Okay.

893
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,400
Oh, shit.

894
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,640
Okay, nice.

895
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,480
We're okay.

896
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,580
We don't have any hostages.

897
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm tempted to go upstairs just to grab the hostage.

898
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,580
Like grab a civilian out in the wilds?

899
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:55,780
Yeah.

900
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,400
You know what?

901
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,160
I'm gonna do it.

902
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,600
You're doing it.

903
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:58,840
Alright.

904
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,880
Okay.

905
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,640
Okay.

906
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,560
Okay, you can't judge me.

907
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,080
I wasn't.

908
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,920
I wasn't.

909
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,240
That's new.

910
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,500
No, that's new.

911
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,480
Legit, that's new.

912
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,480
I've never seen that.

913
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,340
I've never seen that.

914
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,100
That is new.

915
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,940
You saw me get electrocuted just to...

916
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,600
I...

917
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,140
No, the objective is right there.

918
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,480
Oh, no, no, no.

919
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,680
Okay, okay.

920
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,320
We can't even go back upstairs.

921
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,680
They locked us down.

922
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,900
Oh, they locked us down?

923
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,520
Yeah, they locked us down.

924
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,060
Sins.

925
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,060
Oh, no.

926
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,340
There's another...

927
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,060
They're deploying what?

928
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,420
They got cloakers.

929
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,300
Oh, it's cloakers!

930
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,140
Oh, cloakers.

931
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,140
You'll have fun with them.

933
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:51,820
Oh, yeah.

934
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,240
I'll be right next to you.

935
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,340
So, we're gonna get involved together by the cloakers.

936
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,700
No, he attacks one.

937
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,340
He only attacks one?

938
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,140
Yep.

939
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,400
One by one.

940
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,780
Wait, that's not fair.

941
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,980
What do you mean?

942
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,960
Find and verify the correct servers.

943
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,020
We're fucked.

944
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,380
Wait, what do you mean?

945
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,580
What does that even mean?

946
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,680
What does that mean?

947
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,060
Dejan, what does that mean?

948
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,160
I've never played this mission.

949
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Dejan, what does it mean?

950
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,160
I've never played this mission.

951
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,540
Oh, my God.

952
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,280
Oh, everything is going wrong right now.

953
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Wait, there's drones?

954
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,380
Yeah, that's new.

955
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, my God.

956
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,880
They sent in the drones.

957
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,640
Oh, my God.

958
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,820
You know, they're serious.

959
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,300
They're so serious.

960
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,240
Okay, we gotta...

961
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,200
Oh, that's the drone guy.

962
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,500
Hold on.

963
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:41,980
Let me kill him.

964
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,240
Find and verify.

965
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,540
Where the fuck do we verify?

966
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,300
Where the fuck?

967
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,220
Where's the verification?

968
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Did they send the verification code to my phone?

969
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,000
Guys, and you think my phone has the verification code?

970
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,180
Is that what it means?

971
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,100
Okay, got him.

972
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Oh, fucking hell.

973
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
Did you get a shot?

974
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,320
Oh, my God.

975
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,740
I almost ran into the other one, too.

976
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,180
Trying to figure out where the verification code is.

977
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,980
Everything is...

978
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, I found it.

979
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,320
I found it.

980
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,860
Yeah, is that the right one?

981
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,460
I don't know.

982
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:34,640
Oh, God.

983
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,720
This big oil again.

984
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,060
Okay, I found... Where do we bring it?

985
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,580
I have no clue.

986
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,160
Oh, right there.

987
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,720
Where's the... Okay, okay, I got it.

988
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm heading over.

989
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,600
I'm heading over.

990
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,260
Oh, yes, he's over there.

991
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,820
I forgot they're literally jump scares here.

992
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,140
Die.

993
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
You like roulettes?

994
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,480
They're back.

995
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,440
Get down.

996
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,540
That fucking karate kick was insane.

997
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,760
Did we get all the...

998
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,180
Did we get all of them?

999
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,820
I don't know.

1000
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,100
What am I...

1001
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,200
We found correct ones.

1002
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,500
Okay, I need an armor.

1003
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,620
Shit.

1004
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,640
Oh, fuck.

1005
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,780
Oh, fuck.

1006
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,120
Okay.

1007
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,520
I have no armor.

1008
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,360
I only have one.

1009
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,700
I only have one.

1010
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,940
I only brought one of the servers, so that means there's two more.

1011
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah.

1012
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,640
I have no idea.

1013
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,140
Or three.

1014
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,440
Oh, one of them is correct.

1015
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,140
One of them is correct.

1016
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,420
I'm low.

1017
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,060
I'm low as shit.

1018
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,260
Alright, I got one server here.

1019
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,480
I'm tazed.

1020
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,240
But we're got you.

1021
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,760
No longer tazed.

1022
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,620
Trying to find the last server.

1023
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,980
Where's the last server?

1024
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,900
Oh, I found a server.

1025
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,320
I found a server.

1026
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,900
I'm picking it up.

1027
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,680
I'm heading over.

1028
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,740
This is not the right server.

1029
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,140
I'm heading over.

1030
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,440
Oh, my God.

1031
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,940
You are 1 HP, dude.

1032
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,140
I am.

1033
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,800
I need health or armors or whatever.

1034
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,420
How do we test it to see if it's the right server?

1035
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,220
Just like wait.

1036
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,220
Oh, I'm decrypting.

1037
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm decrypting.

1038
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,380
It's okay.

1039
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Our boss got this.

1040
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,720
I got you.

1041
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,280
I got you.

1042
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,980
Oh, I don't know.

1043
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
I think I'm better at this than you.

1044
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,240
I already found 2 out of 3 servers.

1045
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,440
Keep fighting it.

1046
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,900
I don't have armors to go around.

1047
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,100
Okay, but where?

1048
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,260
Where are the other ones?

1049
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,980
I've called in a killstreak weapon.

1050
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,700
If you want to grab it, just grab it.

1051
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
Okay, there are like 200 police officers here.

1052
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,660
Their family is not...

1053
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:57,960
Oh, wait.

1054
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,660
Hey, there's armor.

1055
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,380
Their families are not...

1056
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,580
Their families are going to receive a nice payout.

1057
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,140
I'm running.

1058
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,380
I'm running to find one more server.

1059
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,860
Oh, there's one.

1060
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,680
There's one right here.

1061
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,140
Picking it up.

1062
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,120
I don't know if it's the right one because it's the same one where I picked up the other server.

1063
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:18,940
Okay.

1064
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,880
Wait, what?

1065
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,040
They're not...

1066
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,040
They're not throwing this...

1067
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,920
Wait, there's heals.

1068
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,020
Armors.

1069
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,220
Oh my god, there's heals.

1070
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,400
Thank you, chains.

1071
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,520
Oh, thank god.

1072
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,640
Wait, where did the server...

1073
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,720
Where did it go?

1074
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,300
I picked up a server and it disappeared.

1075
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,620
Again?

1076
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,600
Oh, hey.

1077
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,140
Chains, help me, man.

1078
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,310
No, that's the wrong one.

1079
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:46,810
That's the wrong one.

1080
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,070
It's Mark.

1081
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,330
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1082
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,830
I picked up a server and then it disappeared.

1083
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,310
Found a server.

1084
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,890
Oh, that was the one I was trying to pick up.

1085
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,490
That poor... That guy did not know what was going on.

1086
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,570
Fucking bot.

1087
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,770
I was so confused.

1088
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,670
I have another one if it doesn't work.

1089
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,370
Alright, here.

1090
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,810
I got this one here.

1091
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,410
Alright, put it in.

1092
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,590
Alright, I got another one too right here.

1093
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,450
Fixing my sentry.

1094
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,550
Oh, is this the gun you found?

1095
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,130
Oh, I got it.

1096
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,890
Nah, I called it in.

1097
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,930
Okay, I'm gonna bring this other server if it works.

1098
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,630
Does it work or nah?

1099
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,610
One does not.

1100
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,910
Okay, get that one.

1101
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,470
Okay, here.

1102
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,650
I got this one.

1103
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,220
There's one more server here.

1104
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,100
Holy shit.

1105
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:59,660
Remember when you were like, oh, I'm gonna make sure that they're gonna come after you.

1106
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,860
What happened to that?

1107
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,020
I have another server.

1108
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,940
Does it not work?

1109
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,900
Wait,

1110
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,580
this is a sniper.

1111
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,580
How many servers?

1112
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,880
Yeah, it shoots through walls.

1113
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,040
Oh, it shoots through walls?

1114
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1115
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,560
Okay, watch this.

1116
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm gonna make sure...

1117
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,020
Oh my god.

1118
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,620
Behind you.

1119
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,820
Behind you.

1120
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,020
Wait, what?

1121
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,860
Oh, shit.

1122
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,620
Okay, wait, wait.

1123
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,360
I'm gonna try to shoot through walls right here.

1124
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,200
Throwing knives.

1125
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Oh my god, it works.

1126
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh my god, it actually shoots.

1127
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,420
Okay, that's not the server.

1128
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,940
Okay, I have one more server that will work, but I need you to bring me...

1129
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,320
Oh, wait, wait.

1130
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,040
Okay, never mind.

1131
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,820
I can walk through this.

1132
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,400
You're fine.

1133
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,160
You're fine.

1134
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,080
I can do this.

1135
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,260
Okay, there's one more right here.

1136
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,060
You have bigger armor than me, so...

1137
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,700
Yeah, purple armor.

1138
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,280
No worry.

1139
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,280
Yeah.

1140
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,640
Alright, I got it.

1141
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,360
I found it right here.

1142
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,020
Boom.

1143
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,640
This has to be it.

1144
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,760
That's literally the last server.

1145
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,760
Wait.

1146
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,640
Oh my god, that's so cool.

1147
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:01,920
Wait.

1148
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,380
Wrong.

1149
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,300
This is so cool.

1150
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,120
I can literally, like, shoot from here.

1151
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,500
Call yours.

1152
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,840
Wait, I can call it?

1153
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,560
Which one is it?

1154
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,620
What number is it?

1155
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,280
Press Z.

1156
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,900
It's Z?

1157
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,480
I don't have a Z.

1158
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,940
You don't have a Z?

1159
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,060
Wait, I do.

1160
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,360
Did you call it in?

1161
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1162
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,360
I don't know where does it come from.

1163
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,800
It's marked with an atomic bomb.

1164
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,320
It's marked with an atomic bomb.

1165
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,060
Like, a bomb.

1166
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,160
Like, there, there.

1167
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,160
There, I'm pinging.

1168
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm pinging.

1169
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,340
Wait, I think because I called it, the gun disappeared.

1170
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,800
Oh no, it's right there.

1171
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,180
I pinged it.

1172
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,300
No, no, no, the gun I picked from you.

1173
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,660
Oh, here, here, here.

1174
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,740
Follow me, follow me.

1175
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,360
Do we get it?

1176
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
Oh, we got it, we got it, we got it!

1177
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:44,800
Plant explosives!

1178
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,620
Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

1179
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,920
Here, grab this.

1180
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,460
Okay, okay, yeah.

1181
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,780
There's your gun.

1182
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:48,820
Alright.

1183
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,500
Okay, I get it.

1184
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:51,880
Oh!

1185
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,200
I remember now!

1186
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,360
Time to get out.

1187
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,720
Got the server.

1188
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,640
Ams heavy.

1189
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,580
It's okay, I got you.

1190
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,640
I'm Demoman!

1191
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,080
I'm Demoman!

1192
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,940
You're Demoman.

1193
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,420
I am Demoman.

1194
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,400
Oh, Elmer's Toast.

1195
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,260
Don't worry, I got you.

1196
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,300
Get him!

1197
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,680
Boom!

1198
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,380
Demoman.

1199
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,520
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1200
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,620
Did you plant it?

1201
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,540
Oh, no, you just grab the explosive here?

1202
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,040
I see.

1203
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to grab it.

1204
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,060
Fuck that guy, he's taking the drones.

1205
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,160
Boom.

1206
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,560
Okay, that's a little overkill.

1207
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,240
But that's okay.

1208
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,780
Boom.

1209
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,080
It's called an overkill weapon for a reason.

1210
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,380
Dude, the drones are shooting my ass off.

1211
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,840
You don't have armor.

1212
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,380
I don't.

1213
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,180
Hold on, there's more weapons.

1214
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,240
There's more armor back here.

1215
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,300
I'll grab it.

1216
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,880
Alright, I took the last armor.

1217
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,780
Thanks.

1218
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,600
Don't pay attention, I'm armored up.

1219
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,780
Okay, you have the grenade launcher, yes?

1220
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1221
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,840
Don't worry.

1222
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,060
How the fuck do we get there?

1223
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,800
We have to go.

1224
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,580
Where even are you?

1225
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,200
Where the Sins is.

1226
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,280
Okay, I'm heading over.

1227
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,600
Okay, I need to reload.

1228
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,540
God, this song is so good.

1229
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,320
Jesus, how long do I take to reload this?

1230
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,260
I feel like I'm reloading for 20 years.

1231
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
I need one more explosive, is that you?

1232
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,360
Yeah, that's me, that's me, that's me.

1233
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:42,980
Alright, Demoman.

1234
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,400
I threw away the Demo gun.

1235
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:45,820
Take cover.

1236
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,160
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, I don't know, say hi to it.

1237
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,640
Okay.

1238
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,940
Don't say hi to it.

1239
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:56,900
Alright.

1240
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,740
Good to know.

1241
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,880
I don't have armor anymore.

1242
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,720
Well...

1243
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,020
Oh my god, this game is so realistic, guys.

1244
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,000
I think it's a bad idea, you should have not made me...

1245
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,880
Our HP is so bad.

1246
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,400
Why did you...

1247
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,920
We don't have armors.

1248
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,500
Why did you do this?

1249
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,860
You're so lucky I found out I actually have armor.

1250
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,040
Oh shit, I can do that?

1251
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,760
How do I wear...

1252
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,700
Oh shit!

1253
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,360
How do I wear my armor?

1254
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,220
Oh, I can't because I have no armor to wear.

1255
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,600
You can.

1256
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,680
Oh, I can?

1257
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,660
No armor to wear.

1258
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,520
Yeah, because I have no more armor.

1259
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,520
Oh shit, do you have a grenade?

1260
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,020
A grenade would be nice right now.

1261
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,920
I just used my last one.

1262
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:00,880
Oh, propane.

1263
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,620
Oh my god, I wish our bots had armor.

1264
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,140
I wish...

1265
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,720
It's a berserker!

1266
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,500
Jinx, turn around, Jinx!

1267
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,460
Oh, this is so bad.

1268
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,280
This is so bad.

1269
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,460
This is so bad.

1270
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,840
This is so bad.

1271
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,540
Die, dozer.

1272
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,340
Okay, he's dead.

1273
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,880
Ah, fuck, you know what?

1274
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,720
Explosive tank!

1275
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,940
I'm just gonna say this is Tengen's fault.

1276
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,080
I would've had full HP.

1277
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,700
I would've had full HP.

1278
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,480
He could've easily been like, oh yeah, don't do that.

1279
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,600
Don't do that.

1280
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,660
Guys, guys, now you know.

1281
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,840
Now you know, guys.

1282
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,700
Now we're here to tell you.

1283
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,360
Fuck around.

1284
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,900
Fuck around and found out.

1285
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,260
Oh, I definitely fucked around.

1286
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:51,820
Oh shit.

1287
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,980
Oh my god.

1288
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,180
Wait, wait, wait, I can rez you!

1289
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,040
Get knocked, get knocked, get knocked!

1290
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,260
Okay, hold on.

1291
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,700
Grab the server.

1292
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,580
Trust me.

1293
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,260
We'll go out in a bang.

1294
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,700
I got you!

1295
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,880
Get the server.

1296
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,540
Wait, get the server?

1297
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,260
Which one?

1298
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,580
Oh, this one.

1299
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,180
I got server, I got server, I got server.

1300
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,500
You ever need...

1301
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,120
No, I...

1302
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,720
Oh wait, I do!

1303
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,480
I got...

1304
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,660
Oh my god.

1305
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
Oh, our guy's here!

1306
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,860
Our guy's here!

1307
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,360
Oh my god.

1308
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,420
Oh shit.

1309
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,300
Oh my god.

1310
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,820
I'm scared!

1311
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,620
How do I?

1312
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,280
How do I?

1313
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,920
I'm stuck!

1314
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,020
I'm stuck!

1315
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,260
I'm stuck!

1316
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,380
We're out.

1317
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:39,720
We're out.

1318
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,320
Okay.

1319
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,580
Oh, we're out.

1320
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,740
Oh god, we're out.

1321
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,980
Oh my god, we did it.

1322
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:50,780
Oh my god.

1323
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,980
Oh, we're rich!

1324
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,920
Look at that!

1325
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,260
Oh, we got so many rewards!

1326
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,380
Hell yeah.

1327
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,660
Oh my god, not even close.

1328
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,900
Look at that, we got paid the same amount of money.

1329
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,520
Hell yeah, I'm sure we are.

1330
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,720
We're supposed to.

1331
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,320
What happened to your secondary accuracy?

1332
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,340
All I'm saying is that stats don't matter because we're paid the same amount.

1333
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,460
We're paid the...

1334
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,820
Does it really matter when we both get paid the same amount of money?

1335
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,920
That's all I'm saying.

1336
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,600
Does it really?

1337
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,160
But yeah!

1338
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,960

1343
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,420
Tension carried?

1344
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,700
I was...

1345
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,640
Tension didn't even know where the red card was.

1346
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,680
I don't know.

1347
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,140
Let's see.

1348
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,820
Boys in Blue, Fear and Greed, Houston Breakout.

1349
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,260
Which one do you want to play?

1350
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,040
What can I buy?

1351
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,460
Do a new mission.

1352
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,160
What's a good gun to have, Chat?

1353
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,120
Chat, what gun should I get?

1354
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,060
What's a good gun to have?

1355
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,300
Let's go loud.

1356
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,100
I'm gonna go loud and blow it out.

1357
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,640
Get a silencer?

1358
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:26,820
Wait.

1359
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,240
Oh my god, if I could get the...

1360
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,720
The Bull Kick 500.

1361
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,020
Wait, that looks cool.

1362
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,420
Do I even have a silencer?

1363
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:37,840
Do I...

1364
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,900
Oh wait, I should buy an armor bag, actually.

1365
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,280
Yeah.

1366
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,380
Okay, there's three missions.

1367
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,020
Which one do you want?

1368
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,820
New.

1369
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,340
Boys in Blue, Houston Breakout, Fear and Greed.

1370
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,220
Which one do you want?

1371
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,720
This looks cool, I'm gonna buy this.

1372
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,800
Blue.

1373
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,940
Wait, no, no, no.

1374
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,320
New.

1375
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:53,840
New.

1376
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,860
Anything that's new.

1377
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,280
Everything is new.

1378
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:56,940
Oh.

1379
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,060
People said Boys in Blue is fun.

1380
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,440
Boys in Blue.

1381
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,400
Alright.

1382
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,060
By people, I mean one guy.

1383
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,240
One guy.

1384
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,100
One guy told me.

1385
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,660
Hey, they're people.

1386
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,600
They are people.

1387
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,520
They're the people.

1388
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,140
They're the people.

1389
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,620
They are the people.

1390
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,820
Wait, wait, guys, before I do.

1391
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,400
Guys, which one lets me take police officers as hostage?

1392
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,000
No!

1393
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,720
Oh, thank God, okay.

1394
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,940
Okay, guys, which one lets me take police officers hostage?

1395
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,880
That's like the main one.

1396
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,220
The Voices of Many.

1397
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,900
That sounds like a fucking...

1398
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,000
That doesn't sound real.

1399
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,380
That doesn't sound real.

1400
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,500
Wait, which specialist is this?

1401
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,840
CQC Specialist, I think.

1402
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,440
I wanna take police officers hostage.

1403
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,080
Forced Friendship.

1404
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,480
Oh, I like that.

1405
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,600
Forced Friendship.

1406
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,260
But which one is it?

1407
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,000
Is it Grifter?

1408
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,960
There's Grifter.

1409
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Yeah, guys, I'm a Grifter.

1410
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,560
Which one?

1411
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,740
Oh, Manipulator.

1412
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,080
Manipulator?

1413
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
Okay, Manipulator.

1414
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,540
Okay, oh, I have to research?

1415
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,160
How do you research, Tengen?

1416
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,260
Just research and play a game.

1417
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,240
Okay, I'm researching.

1418
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,100
Alright, I'll put...

1419
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,160
Let's see, I'm gonna put it on Medic for now just because I can't do anything with it.

1420
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,940
Oh, I can deploy two additional charges?

1421
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,620
Oh, nice.

1422
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,460
I'm gonna queue for the next mission.

1423
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1424
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,740
Wait, wait, wait, I'm trying to be useful.

1425
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,460
I am trying to be useful right now.

1426
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:46,940
You are?

1427
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,500
Now I am!

1428
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,420
Okay, now I'm...

1429
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,680
Okay, Mr. Fucking Smartass.

1430
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,700
I want to dress...

1431
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,580
I want to put on a new mask, too.

1432
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,700
Actually, you know what I'm gonna put?

1433
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,440
That suit.

1434
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,460
Oh my god, this looks like I'm on...

1435
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:09,980
Yeah!

1436
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,500
Alright, let's see.

1437
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,860
I want to put on... I'm on vacation.

1438
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,520
I'm gonna be on vacation and then...

1439
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,460
Wait, can you change your melee weapons?

1440
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,340
In Payday 2, you could.

1441
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,700
I know, I don't know if you can for this one.

1442
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,180
Wait, I look like I'm on vacation right now.

1443
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,760
Alright, I'm ready.

1444
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,360
Um, actually...

1445
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,460
Um, actually...

1446
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,140
Actually...

1447
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,740
Hey man, you gotta make your clothes work in a mission, you know?

1448
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,520
Just saying.

1449
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,580
I mean, I look like I blend in right now.

1450
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,300
I look like I blend in.

1451
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,640
I'm on vacation, I'm here on a break.

1452
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,480
From my 9 to 5.

1453
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,720
It's been a long day.

1454
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,840
It's been a long day.

1455
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,600
I almost lost my phone at the Uber.

1456
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,280
Things haven't been going so well.

1457
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,440
Guys...

1458
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,440
Why does it take so long to prepare heists?

1459
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,620
It's like literally us two.

1460
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,620
That's one of the thing...

1461
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:18,140
That's one of the thing that I think that has been pointed out.

1462
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,340
On a thing.

1463
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,360
Basically...

1464
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,440
A lot of people find it kind of...

1465
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,620
Discomforting and you have to like...

1466
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,340
Prepare for the heist kind of thing like that.

1467
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,880
Well, there's the beta version of it.

1468
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,260
Like where you can host it on your own.

1469
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,220
Like in Payday 2.

1470
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,740
But for now, it's only available to play on your own for now.

1471
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,640
But I'm pretty sure if things are right and give a lot of feedback to it...

1472
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,660
You know...

1473
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,660
They'll actually put that in.

1474
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,500
You know, it's like you can host it on the server as of your own.

1475
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,960
Just like Payday 2.

1476
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,320
So make it seamless.

1477
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,100
Oh, I see.

1478
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,120
Oh, that makes sense.

1479
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,420
Wait, am I using...

1480
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,280
Wait, no ass...

1481
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,440
Oh, I didn't...

1482
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,140
How do I custom...

1483
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh, I need to like add stuff to my gun.

1484
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,280
Can I mod my gun?

1485
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,160
You gotta level up your gun.

1486
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,560
Okay.

1487
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,600
I don't have anything on my gun.

1488
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,580
Yeah, I don't have anything on it.

1489
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,320
You have a preset gun.

1490
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,060
I'm ready.

1491
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,960
I got my medic bag.

1492
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,440
I have a medic bag too.

1493
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,000
Wait, the gold that a cop stole from Vlaad is held in a police depot.

1494
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,300
The depot out in the...

1495
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,700
Okay, I guess we'll never know.

1496
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,160
I guess I'll never know the lore.

1497
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,960
Whoa, fuck reading I guess.

1498
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,180
We'll never know.

1499
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,300
It just skipped on its own.

1500
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,360
Alright.

1501
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,820
Oh my god.

1502
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,160
Dude, what are you wearing?

1503
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,260
What am I wearing?

1504
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm on vacation.

1505
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,160
How did you say hi?

1506
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,940
How did you say hi?

1507
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,160
Middle mouse.

1508
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:00,980
Middle mouse?

1509
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
I'm inspecting my hands.

1510
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,820
I need ammo.

1511
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,260
Do you wanna see my hands?

1512
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,500
Do you wanna see it?

1513
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,060
Whoa, look at my hands.

1514
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,680
Follow me, guys.

1515
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,520
Wait, what are we supposed to do?

1516
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,700
Get inside the station?

1517
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,580
I mean, that's easy.

1518
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,520
We just walk in.

1519
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,980
We're supposed to raid a police station.

1520
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:58,460
Hey guys, what happens if I do this?

1521
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,740
Pick up donuts.

1522
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,540
I'm picking up donuts.

1523
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,700
I got donuts.

1524
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,820
I stole donuts.

1525
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,560
I stole donuts.

1526
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,200
We're out.

1527
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,320
You stole the fucking donuts?

1528
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,920
I stole donuts.

1529
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,880
I'm outta here.

1530
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,740
Holy shit.

1531
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,020
That's right.

1532
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,740
That was the heist.

1533
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,180
That was donuts!

1534
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:20,980
That's right.

1535
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,000
What you gonna do, huh?

1536
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:22,760
Cougher.

1537
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,080
What you gonna do?

1538
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,220
Yeah, that's right.

1539
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,920
You saw it.

1540
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,840
Yeah, that's right.

1541
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,180
Did you try to go in?

1542
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,720
You fucking tried to go inside?

1543
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,740
No, I played the speaker.

1544
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,740
He's looking at the speaker.

1545
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,760
Don't worry.

1546
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,440
They won't know.

1547
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,700
How would they know?

1548
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,560
There's a camera right behind you.

1549
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,680
There's a camera right behind...

1550
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,980
There's a camera right behind...

1551
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,760
Okay.

1552
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,160
Okay, goodbye.

1553
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,580
Bro, he saw you.

1554
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,660
No, he didn't.

1555
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,720
What you talking about?

1556
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,720
He saw you!

1557
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,740
He didn't catch you!

1558
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,320
No, he don't know where I am.

1559
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,220
What you talking about?

1560
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,840
No, he didn't catch you!

1561
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,760
You fucking...

1562
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,780
Oh, thank God.

1563
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,420
How would he know?

1564
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,460
How would he know?

1565
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,920
He wasn't supposed to be in the middle.

1566
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,920
How would he know?

1567
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,620
He wasn't supposed to be in the middle.

1568
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,900
He wasn't supposed to be in the middle.

1569
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
I'm placing my donuts.

1570
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,760
Oh, and you were like...

1571
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,540
Oh, Doki.

1572
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,600
You're not gonna be able to do self-missions.

1573
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,200
I'm not stealth like this.

1574
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh, you won't be able to...

1575
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,640
You won't be able to do self-missions.

1576
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,040
Fuck, he gets alerted instantly.

1577
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,480
No, get over here.

1578
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,560
I know, I'm trying to get the hostages.

1579
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,900
You have to witness this.

1580
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,860
Okay, I'm witnessing.

1581
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,000
What did you do?

1582
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,300
I'm placing my donuts.

1583
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:05,940
Oh, my God.

1584
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,840
Oh, my God.

1585
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,900
We're so fast now.

1586
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,280
Holy shit, that's a buff.

1587
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,420
Holy shit, that's a buff.

1588
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,880
Oh, my God, let's go.

1589
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,960
We're so fast with the power of donuts.

1590
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,540
Get to the car depot.

1591
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,600
Where is the car depot?

1592
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,400
We need to get the car impound.

1593
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,120
Holy shit.

1594
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,180
Oh, get to the car depot.

1595
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,920
Where is the car depot?

1596
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,900
I ran out of ties.

1597
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,480
You ran out of ties?

1598
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:34,920
Yeah.

1599
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,440
There's a sniper.

1600
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,740
He's aimed at you.

1601
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,680
He's gonna take the shot.

1602
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,060
I think that laser...

1603
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,880
I think that laser is not supposed to be painting at me.

1604
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,720
Holy shit, I'm picking up money.

1605
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,520
Holy shit, I just lost a whole chunk.

1606
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,120
Yeah, I wonder how.

1607
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,260
I wonder who fucking shot you.

1608
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,100
Oh, my God, this takes forever to reload.

1609
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,820
I'm ready.

1610
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,040
Where is the car depot?

1611
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,100
I don't fucking know.

1612
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,100
I'm following you.

1613
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,680
Surveillance room.

1614
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,920
We don't need that.

1615
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,420
Over here.

1616
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,240
Okay.

1617
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,940
Oh, right here.

1618
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,460
I got him.

1619
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,230
I did it.

1620
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,490
Explosives.

1621
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,470
Are we gonna talk to the explosive again?

1622
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:36,150
Yeah, right here.

1623
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,350
I'm not talking to the explosive.

1624
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,370
I got one of them.

1625
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,470
Why not?

1626
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,110
Coward.

1627
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:42,710
Pussy.

1628
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:45,770
There's one more.

1629
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,210
I thought it was you.

1630
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,830
I have two bombs.

1631
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,050
Okay.

1632
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,570
Wow, Lonelywood did this stealthily.

1633
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,550
Damn.

1634
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,310
Man, that's crazy, isn't it?

1635
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,290
I couldn't care less.

1636
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,390
I just wanna shoot things.

1637
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,390
He just went into your donut.

1638
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,250
That's it.

1639
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,450
Wait, this is the same area.

1640
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,390
Oh my god, wait, unless...

1641
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,650
Don't worry, guys.

1642
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,590
Okay, it doesn't work.

1643
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,590
Wait, unless...

1644
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:26,890
Guys...

1645
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,830
What did you do?

1646
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:30,450
Nothing.

1647
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,230
Nothing?

1648
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,050
Like no big deal?

1649
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,490
Nothing is going on.

1650
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,510
Wait, how do we...

1651
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,810
We gotta figure out how to...

1652
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,130
Wait, why are you not going inside?

1653
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,050
I'm opening it.

1654
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,890
Oh, we have to defend this, okay.

1655
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,150
Yeah, I'm carrying money as well.

1656
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,770
I figured out what the stealth version was for this.

1657
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:51,890
What?

1658
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,390
There's like a vent and you have to figure out...

1659
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:55,790
I don't know.

1660
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,890
You have to go through the vent or some shit.

1661
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,270
Oh, armor.

1662
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,710
Do we have to hostage?

1663
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,390
No, it's fine.

1664
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,110
I have so many hostages.

1665
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:05,890
I'm gonna go for it.

1666
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,110
I'm gonna find them.

1667
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,630
Where are they?

1668
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,250
There was a lot of hostages I took upstairs.

1669
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:10,770
Yeah.

1670
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,450
I'm trying to...

1671
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,090
Oh, I'm lost.

1672
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,790
I'm so lost.

1673
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,730
Confidential police files?

1674
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,350
Where is that?

1675
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,870
I knew it.

1676
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:23,490
Get over there.

1677
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:25,190
Get over there.

1678
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,210
Get over there.

1679
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:28,590
There's a lieutenant.

1680
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,090
That's right.

1681
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,950
Go over there right now.

1682
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,370
At the captain's room.

1683
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,630
Alright, I got several hostages.

1684
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,710
Alright, and then...

1685
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,770
Follow me.

1686
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:44,610
Get up.

1687
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,330
Follow me.

1688
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,510
Get over here.

1689
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,190
Get over here.

1690
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,590
I need you to be in a more hostage situation.

1691
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,670
How did you go upstairs?

1692
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,310
Oh, it's right here.

1693
01:00:59,370 --> 01:00:59,570
Come on.

1694
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,150
Get over here.

1695
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:01,830
Life doesn't matter.

1696
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,170
Get over here.

1697
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,050
That's right.

1698
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:07,170
That's right.

1699
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:07,650
I can do this.

1700
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:08,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1701
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:09,430
You scared?

1702
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:10,570
You scared?

1703
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,390
Yeah, that's right.

1704
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:12,590
That's right.

1705
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:14,150
I can shoot you right now.

1706
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,610
I can shoot you in the toes right now.

1707
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:19,330
I got a money bag.

1708
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,810
I have one of them here.

1709
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,450
Alright, now get down.

1710
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,450
Oh, shit!

1711
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,650
Who the fuck is she?

1712
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,010
Okay, we have several hostages too.

1713
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,890
We gotta make sure we don't accidentally shoot them up here.

1714
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,330
Don't.

1715
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,090
Oh, I'm stuck on the desk.

1716
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,530
What are you doing, Tengen?

1717
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:47,550
Huh?

1718
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,650
I'm grabbing a cable.

1719
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,910
Don't you dare take our hostages.

1720
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,110
Don't you take our hostages.

1721
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,870
Oh, we killed one of them.

1722
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:58,730
It wasn't me.

1723
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,390
Are you sure?

1724
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:00,910
Yeah.

1725
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,670
How would I shoot the floor?

1726
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,470
I'm literally aiming at the level.

1727
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,710
It wasn't me.

1728
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:11,730
It's okay.

1729
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,610
It's okay, guys.

1730
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,430
Your lives never mattered.

1731
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:15,630
Okay.

1732
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,670
Okay, if they mattered, what was their name?

1733
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:21,970
What was their name, Tengen?

1734
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,830
Chat, what was his name?

1735
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,130
Does his life really matter?

1736
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,570
If it matters, you would know his name.

1737
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:27,330
What is his name?

1738
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,310
Jackie.

1739
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:30,710
Exactly.

1740
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:31,390
That's right.

1741
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:31,970
Checkmate.

1742
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,190
You don't know his name.

1743
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,450
I can wake up.

1744
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:38,730
Die.

1745
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,290
There's money here.

1746
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,470
What do I do with the money?

1747
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:46,990
Yeah, grab the money.

1748
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,990
Yeah, but where do we put the money?

1749
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,670
Did you set the generator?

1750
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,490
Oh, you set the generator!

1751
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,350
I'm doing the side objective.

1752
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,810
What the fuck are you doing the side objective for?

1753
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:57,750
Extra money.

1754
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:59,050
Oh my god.

1755
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,530
Is $300,000 not enough for you?

1756
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:02,170
No.

1757
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:03,990
No.

1758
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,490
Okay, I know it's enough.

1759
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,750
Because I know what the conversion rate is.

1760
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,990
Oh, you know the conversion rate?

1761
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,830
Oh, surely you do.

1762
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,750
I've explained to you so many damn times.

1763
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:25,370
I know how much 10 American dollars can get you in Indonesia.

1764
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:26,970
Yeah.

1765
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:30,810
Exactly.

1766
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,870
Oh my god, I need help.

1767
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:38,390
Oh my god.

1768
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,710
Extra cash from Vlad.

1769
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,550
Can never go wrong.

1770
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,650
Vlad is my man.

1771
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,150
What are you doing?

1772
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,410
What is he doing?

1773
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:49,650
Wait, why is he running away?

1774
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,170
Why is the blue guy running away?

1775
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:54,790
That's the hostage you traded.

1776
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:55,530
Oh!

1777
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:59,450
Oh, sorry.

1778
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,110
I almost killed the extra hostage.

1779
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,090
I might have like...

1780
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,650
I might have like...

1781
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:09,250
Knocked him with my gun.

1782
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,790
Because I didn't know.

1783
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:15,910
It's okay.

1784
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:16,870
Everything's fine.

1785
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:18,510
Sure.

1786
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,690
I feel very safe.

1787
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,810
You got the money?

1788
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:23,630
No.

1789
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,530
Where's the other money?

1790
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,010
I don't fucking know.

1791
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,930
I've just been shooting the cops.

1792
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,430
I've been shooting the popos.

1793
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:33,410
Grab the armor.

1794
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,150
Oh, yeah.

1795
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:36,290
I got it.

1796
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,530
Okay, that hostage was in blue.

1797
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,010
So I thought he was the police.

1798
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,170
It's understandable.

1799
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,370
He's blue.

1800
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,990
So then it makes me want to shoot him.

1801
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:52,950
End game.

1802
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:53,550
End game, guys.

1803
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,050
I was running for him for a good three seconds.

1804
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:05,030
He was literally...

1805
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,750
What the fuck is he anyways?

1806
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,770
I can't recall.

1807
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,390
He was sticking on a wall like Spiderman.

1808
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:12,910
He just came out of nowhere.

1809
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,390
He literally like dived down.

1810
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:15,590
I don't know.

1811
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,070
I called in my gun.

1812
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,330
Where does it come in?

1813
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,630
It depends on where yours at.

1814
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:24,750
I think it's here.

1815
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:26,270
The heli's here.

1816
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,910
Is that my gun or yours?

1817
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,350
I literally just called it.

1818
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,230
I called a demo man.

1819
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:33,390
Oh, this is your gun.

1820
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1821
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,130
My demo man gun.

1822
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,230
It's demo man time.

1823
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,250
I can't call my gun.

1824
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:42,270
Wait, why not?

1825
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,070
He's refueling.

1826
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,750
He's refueling.

1827
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:50,990
Oh no.

1828
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,750
Okay, we gotta defend it.

1829
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:54,270
I'm ready.

1830
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,830
Oh, there's a sniper!

1831
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,930
I don't think my grenade launcher can get up there.

1832
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:00,990
Right.

1833
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,170
I got one, I got one.

1834
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,470
Oh, there's more coming over here.

1835
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,570
Don't worry, I've got...

1836
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,750
Wait, where's my...

1837
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,550
Wait, what's my...

1838
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,070
Oh, where did my demo man gun go?

1839
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:13,830
Oh, it's over there.

1840
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:14,870
You dropped it.

1841
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,310
I got it, don't worry.

1842
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:18,770
Fume.

1843
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:20,390
Fume.

1844
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,570
You can sabotage your ship now?

1845
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:24,710
Yeah, they can.

1846
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,890
No, like your equipment and stuff.

1847
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:28,870
Oh, wait, they took it?

1848
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,030
They took our equipment?

1849
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:30,850
Yeah, the armor.

1850
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:35,170
Oh my god, you think our taxpayers don't pay enough armor already?

1851
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:36,530
I know.

1852
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,050
Steal the gold.

1853
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,170
Time for stealing.

1854
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:41,930
Oh, I'm ready.

1855
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:45,830
Oh, that's a cool animation.

1856
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,450
Did you drill it?

1857
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:48,950
Yeah, I'm drilling it.

1858
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,630
Okay.

1859
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,490
Looking through the police report.

1860
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,990
I'm destroying evidence, guys.

1861
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:58,010
I'm destroying evidence.

1862
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,810
I'm picking up rare elements right now.

1863
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,140
Oh, there's ammo.

1864
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,240
There's armor.

1865
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,880
Oh, there's more evidence.

1866
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,600
Oh, cocaine.

1867
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:14,780
Hell yeah.

1868
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,020
Hey man, I said what it is.

1869
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,740
I said what it is.

1870
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,820
And I stand corrected.

1871
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,020
Look man, you just got the right stuff.

1872
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,660
And I'm... I don't know.

1873
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,860
I got stuff.

1874
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,440
What did you get?

1875
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,700
I got stuff.

1876
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,980
Is it gonna disappear?

1877
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,420
Is this item gonna disappear when I turn around?

1878
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,960
What's gonna happen?

1879
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,520
No, it's not.

1880
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,900
Oh my god, it's so heavy.

1881
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,300
What is this?

1882
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,520
Is this the right shit?

1883
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,480
Are we supposed to be here?

1884
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:52,800
I don't know.

1885
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,260
I don't know.

1886
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,160
I'm just doing what you're doing.

1887
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,380
I don't think so either.

1888
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:58,940
I'm not gonna lie.

1889
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,580
I'm pretty sure.

1890
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
Why are you following me?

1891
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,840
Because you have level 40.

1892
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,780
You have a thousand hours of baiting.

1893
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,340
What do you mean?

1894
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,220
I literally have never played this mission.

1895
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,380
Don't worry, I got you.

1896
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,800
I'm still putting in that thing that you put last time.

1897
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,980
What happened to my armor?

1898
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:26,760
What did I do?

1899
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,680
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1900
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,600
Alright, I put it all in the little cubby hole.

1901
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,040
Are you still getting harassed?

1902
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:38,840
Yes.

1903
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,460
Oh shit.

1904
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,740
Grab more of the bag.

1905
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,260
There's an extra cache upstairs.

1906
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,040
Oh, I don't have any armor.

1907
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,000
Is there extra armor?

1908
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,720
Oh!

1909
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,200
Guys, I need help!

1910
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,160
You have armor?

1911
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,560
I'm reloading!

1912
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,300
You can grab that.

1913
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,760
No, I can't wear it!

1914
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,560
No!

1915
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,080
Oh shit.

1916
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,760
Guys, I picked the wrong pistol.

1917
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,500
Guys, please.

1918
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,020
20 seconds, guys.

1919
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,740
You can't refill this?

1920
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,120
I can't!

1921
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,280
I can only pick it up!

1922
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,680
That's all I can do!

1923
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,460
Oh, I can take this though.

1924
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,720
Okay, nice.

1925
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,320
Oh my god, please have mercy on me.

1926
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,880
Yeah, I can't refill it.

1927
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,480
Where are you supposed to prepare the gateway?

1928
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,080
Is it on the left side?

1929
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,560
I'm drilling through it, but there's a lot of snipers.

1930
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,740
I'm right behind you.

1931
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,140
Oh, it's jammed.

1932
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:54,860
I'm fixing it!

1933
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,820
I'm using my hammer!

1934
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,020
I'm hammering it!

1935
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,880
Okay, I'm hammering.

1936
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,440
Is that how you...

1937
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,600
Guys, is this historically accurate?

1938
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,720
Is this historically accurate?

1939
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,500
The drills always have been pretty shit.

1940
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,120
So...

1941
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,540
We're playing Minecraft right now.

1942
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,260
Makes me wonder if we were supposed to put it there.

1943
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,400
I'm gonna put it there just to keep it safe.

1944
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,940
Just so they don't grab it.

1945
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,760
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

1946
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,240
And this is like 20 seconds left.

1947
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,520
Oh, there's more snipers up top.

1948
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,600
Ah!

1949
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,260
Okay, that was not a sniper.

1950
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,740
That was not a sniper.

1951
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,780
Oh my god.

1952
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,640
He's fucking shaking.

1953
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,120
Okay, we gotta wait.

1954
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,200
Why is it so slow?

1955
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,280
What's it gonna do?

1956
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,200
Fucking break the car in half?

1957
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,780
Like, what is this gonna do?

1958
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,320
It could.

1959
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,420
There's no way.

1960
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,900
It could be like 0.5 faster and the car will be okay.

1961
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,260
The car will be okay if it was 0.5 faster.

1962
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,700
You can't guarantee that.

1963
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,780
Yes, I can.

1964
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,260
It's called gravity.

1965
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah, but Isaac Newton fucking invented that shit.

1966
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,340
Oh yeah, Isaac Newton fucking hates me.

1967
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,240
I hate that bitch.

1968
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,420
I know where he's buried.

1969
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,400
This is why people don't know where he's buried, guys.

1970
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,580
I think they know.

1971
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,420
I was gonna desecrate that tree.

1972
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,600
It wasn't in the nose.

1973
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,500
I was gonna 5-4 shoot dudes.

1974
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,620
End game!

1975
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,680
End game, guys.

1976
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,580
I heard he was an asshole back then.

1977
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,020
He deserved it.

1978
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,260
I think everyone was pretty much an asshole back then.

1979
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:55,820
No, no.

1980
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,920
But Isaac Newton, he was a special kind of asshole.

1981
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:00,220
Oh!

1982
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,100
Dozer!

1983
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:03,600
Dozer!

1984
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,000
Oh, I heard you, Phil.

1985
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,720
Oh, fuck me.

1986
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,280
My armor's jumped off.

1987
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,400
Oh my god, he's taunting!

1988
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,660
Oh my god, look at him!

1989
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,780
He's like, yeah, you wanna get me?

1990
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,680
You got me there?

1991
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,660
Is he dead?

1992
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,320
He's dead.

1993
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,040
I did it, guys.

1994
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,760
Wait, we unlocked them.

1995
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:25,680
Can I?

1996
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,980
Oh, we have to go back inside.

1997
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,080
We have to go back inside.

1998
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,200
Smoke grenade!

1999
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,440
Alright, I'm heading over.

2000
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:35,920
I'm heading over.

2001
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:38,860
I've smoked it.

2002
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,660
I'm running over.

2003
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,520
Holy shit.

2004
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,620
It's like...

2005
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,740
Upstairs is upstairs.

2006
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,860
Wait, how do I go upstairs?

2007
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:50,620
Oh, it's right here.

2008
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,880
I'm gonna eat some donuts.

2009
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:55,700
Donuts.

2010
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:56,740
Donuts.

2011
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,520
Wait, where is it?

2012
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,200
You'll need to open the security plow through it.

2013
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:02,440
What?

2014
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,700
Oh, fuck, it's in the safe, isn't it?

2015
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,300
Wait, I can do it too.

2016
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,410
Okay, I give up.

2017
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,890
I give up.

2018
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:21,850
It's too difficult.

2019
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:22,810
Got it.

2020
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,370
Got the key, got the money, got the money.

2021
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:26,050
Bam, bam, bam.

2022
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:26,570
Boom.

2023
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,630
Shit, there's a lot of people.

2024
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:31,530
Smoke grenade.

2025
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,650
Okay, that works.

2026
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,330
Oh, it takes all of us!

2027
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,150
Oh my god, I can't see anything.

2028
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,430
Wait, how could they see stuff?

2029
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:45,530
How could they see stuff too?

2030
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,470
Guys, is there fall damage for this?

2031
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,230
Oh, I'm okay.

2032
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:51,670
I'm okay.

2033
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,410
I'll open the gate, start the car.

2034
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:57,990
Okay.

2035
01:13:58,750 --> 01:13:59,530
I'm in the car.

2036
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,310
Refilling HP.

2037
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,110
Oh!

2038
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:07,950
No!

2039
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:09,630
No!

2040
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:12,210
Help!

2041
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,870
Okay, okay.

2042
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:15,470
Okay, okay.

2043
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,190
Fuck this box 7.

2044
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:20,510
My ass right there.

2045
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:21,490
Secure the loot.

2046
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,650
Move the loot.

2047
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,030
That was the scariest shit I've ever seen.

2048
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,010
Alright, I got the gold too.

2049
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,250
Fuck.

2050
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,270
It's so heavy.

2051
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,710
Just gonna throw it out farther away.

2052
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,310
Okay.

2053
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:45,070
I wish our bots could carry the gold.

2054
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,630
I think they can.

2055
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:47,790
Someone took our shit!

2056
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:48,730
Wait, what?

2057
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:51,770
How?

2058
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,550
Hey, give us more money.

2059
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:59,410
Give him his money.

2060
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:00,890
Yes.

2061
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:03,790
I broke my armor.

2062
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,410
Oh no.

2063
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,130
Trying to head over right now.

2064
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,970
Okay, I can go.

2065
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:12,370
I can go.

2066
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:14,670
Oh, I can't go.

2067
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,590
I can't go anymore.

2068
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:16,930
I can't go.

2069
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:19,870
Alright, I'm running.

2070
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:20,190
I'm running.

2071
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:23,230
I'm fucking walking.

2072
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:23,530
Oh!

2073
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,310
Right there.

2074
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,210
I got him.

2075
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,330
Keep throwing shit.

2076
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,190
I got one of them.

2077
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,510
I need a second one.

2078
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:37,550
I need a second one.

2079
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:40,970
We have a system.

2080
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:41,710
We have a system.

2081
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:43,670
We have a system.

2082
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:47,090
I'm not seeing a sniper shoot one bullet.

2083
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,670
The sniper shot me once and I fucking died, guys.

2084
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:50,690
I don't know.

2085
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:53,430
I actually got knocked down.

2086
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:56,470
Wait, what's that?

2087
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:56,790
Oh!

2088
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:59,030
Oh my god, there was a drone.

2089
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:00,410
Okay.

2090
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:04,990
Alright.

2091
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,050
Okay.

2092
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,250
I've got four more.

2093
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:13,070
Oh no, the drone is evil.

2094
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:14,410
Holy shit!

2095
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:15,850
Please live!

2096
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,410
I'll throw a smoke grenade.

2097
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:24,030
Okay.

2098
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:27,170
Okay, I have more.

2099
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:30,090
I have more.

2100
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:30,410
Oh!

2101
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:32,930
No!

2102
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,190
We want all of it!

2103
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,750
You don't understand, ma'am!

2104
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,810
We want everything!

2105
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:39,150
Okay.

2106
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:40,830
Oh, I see your special powder.

2107
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:47,810
I picked it up.

2108
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,190
You picked it up?

2109
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:49,610
Yeah.

2110
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,310
We got the special powder.

2111
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:54,330
Alright.

2112
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,630
Happy powder.

2113
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:04,070
Okay.

2114
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,070
Oh, level 7.

2115
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,290
Level 8.

2116
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:07,230
Oh my god.

2117
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,270
We leveled up so fast.

2118
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,530
I'm already level 10.

2119
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:13,890
Wait, how much did you...

2120
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:14,650
Oh, sorry.

2121
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:17,530
I shot... I might have shot one.

2122
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:19,470
I don't understand.

2123
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,610
Why would we lose money for shooting a civilian?

2124
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,650
Hey, man, we gotta pay for degrees.

2125
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:24,590
Like...

2126
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,670
Yeah, but we shot so many cops.

2127
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,210
So wouldn't it be like...

2128
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,630
The government pays for them.

2129
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,570
How come I don't see your stats?

2130
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:32,330
Did you just leave?

2131
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:35,150
Yeah, you don't need to see it.

2132
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,650
Did I outstat you?

2133
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:40,210
No.

2134
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,910
Then how come I don't see your stats?

2135
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,250
What do you mean never?

2136
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,130
Then why are you embarrassed?

2137
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,370
Why are you embarrassed?

2138
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,370
No, you might be insecure.

2139
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,490
Why are you embarrassed?

2140
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,410
Oh, are you insecure?

2141
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:53,790
No, you might be insecure.

2142
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,350
Guys, look.

2143
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:59,390
I'm top rank, guys.

2144
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,230
I had all the degrees.

2145
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:07,070
Alright.

2146
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,670
Wanna do one more?

2147
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:10,390
One more mission?

2148
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:12,070
Alright, let's do one more mission.

2149
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:14,350
Let's see.

2150
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,410
The last new heist is...

2151
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,690
Fear and greed.

2152
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,190
Guess which one I have.

2153
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,090
Which one?

2154
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,370
Fear and greed.

2155
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:25,710
Same.

2156
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,310
Women are scary.

2157
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:31,230
They are.

2158
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,070
How do you even talk to...

2159
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,350
the ladies anyway?

2160
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:38,750
I don't know.

2161
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:40,350
I just started doing the greedy.

2162
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,190
You just started doing the greedy?

2163
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,190
Yeah.

2164
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:43,650
Let's go.

2165
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:44,990
Hello.

2166
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,390
Hello, ma'am.

2167
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,510
Are you having a nice day?

2168
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:03,150
Have a great evening, madam.

2169
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:06,470
The fuck, dude?

2170
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:09,710
What, you guys can do better?

2171
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:11,850
You guys think you can do better?

2172
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:12,510
Yeah.

2173
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,010
Alright.

2174
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,070
Oh, shit.

2175
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,070
I should have bought stuff.

2176
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,330
Wait.

2177
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:26,030
Go back to main menu.

2178
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,330
I forgot to...

2179
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:32,110
upgrade my stuff.

2180
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:37,650
I was researching manipulation.

2181
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,390
Yes.

2182
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:42,070
Yes.

2183
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,510
Now I can be...

2184
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,730
my dream come true.

2185
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:51,310
Bro is manipulative.

2186
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:52,950
Wait, how do I reset the skills?

2187
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:54,270
E.

2188
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,030
It doesn't let me reset it.

2189
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:03,610
It doesn't let me reset all these skills.

2190
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,330
I don't know.

2191
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,670
What do you mean you don't know?

2192
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:10,430
I mean, it worked for me.

2193
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:11,970
It didn't work for me.

2194
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,710
I want to buy manipulator.

2195
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,050
No!

2196
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:22,850
How can I manipulate now?

2197
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:25,910
Manipulate them.

2198
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,150
It says it's locked.

2199
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:32,870
Oh, it resets the points and not the res...

2200
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,590
Oh, my God.

2201
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:34,790
I wasted my time.

2202
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,790
I wasted...

2203
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,570
How am I going to manipulate now?

2204
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:41,290
I don't know.

2205
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,350
How can I manipulate people?

2206
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:47,870
Start drifting.

2207
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:49,010
Anyway.

2208
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,310
Do I start now?

2209
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:55,530
No, I wanted to fucking take the cops as a hostage.

2210
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,930
This fucking sucks.

2211
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:01,110
I can't take the cops as a hostage.

2212
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,370
All right.

2213
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,290
I want to...

2214
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:08,330
I don't know if I should buy a better main gun.

2215
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,210
You know what?

2216
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:14,150
This gun... Okay, what's the most expensive gun I can buy?

2217
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,430
400k.

2218
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,470
The R5.

2219
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:24,030
All right.

2220
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,210
I mean, this looks pretty cool.

2221
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,870
This gun looks really cool.

2222
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:31,850
You don't know what gun I'm holding, but like, it's really cool.

2223
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:33,690
Okay.

2224
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,350
It's really cool.

2225
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:40,750
Okay, I got the muzzle brake and then I got nothing else on it because I'm not high enough level.

2226
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,550
Wait, can I put stock?

2227
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:42,890
No.

2228
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:44,930
Wait, I am level 3.

2229
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,830
What do you mean I have to unlock at level 7?

2230
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:49,070
I am level 7.

2231
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:50,130
The weapon.

2232
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:51,770
Oh.

2233
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:55,750
Yeah.

2234
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,250
Yeah.

2235
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,830
Yeah.

2236
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,210
Yeah.

2237
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:04,050
That makes a lot more sense now.

2238
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,430
All right, I'm ready.

2239
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,010
I'm ready.

2240
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:10,590
Wait, the knife is level 16.

2241
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:11,610
God, that sucks.

2242
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:13,570
I don't want level 16.

2243
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,630
There's a knife?

2244
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:16,210
Yeah.

2245
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,330
No, the knife you use for your throw.

2246
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:20,630
Oh.

2247
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:23,510
Yeah, I have throwing knife for stealth.

2248
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,950
Yeah, all right, I'm ready.

2249
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:25,790
I'm ready for real.

2250
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:29,710
Yeah, this is exactly why I got Tenjin because he actually knows what he's doing.

2251
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:32,330
I have no clue what I'm doing.

2252
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,310
That's why I was like, you know what?

2253
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:34,410
Maybe I get my brother.

2254
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:38,990
He's not only teaching me, he's not only teaching Chat, he's teaching the rest of us too.

2255
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:39,690
Hey.

2256
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:50,130
But yeah, if you guys want to try out the new Payday 3 updates, click on the link pinned in my chat and in the description below.

2257
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,090
It really helps support the stream.

2258
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:55,230
Also, like, huge shout out to Payday 3 for sponsoring us.

2259
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:57,530
It really helps out a lot.

2260
01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:00,890
Guys, it helps Tenjin too because I dragged him into this.

2261
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:04,190
I'm not even a contract, but all right.

2262
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:06,610
What?

2263
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:08,510
He's my plus one.

2264
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:16,370
He got four exposure and he got the four exposure bucks and the free Payday.

2265
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,570
Free Payday and an exposure.

2266
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,230
Oh, man.

2267
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,080
Thank you, Payday 3.

2268
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,860
Thanks, Payday 3.

2269
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:30,460
I'm ready.

2270
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,200
Since we've hit John Conqu- what?

2271
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,820
It's just gone.

2272
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,280
I wish you could just read it for a while.

2273
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,640
I know, I know what the lore is.

2274
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:41,780
Thanks, Salmer.

2275
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,220
Oh, is this the mall?

2276
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,340
Oh, it's the stock market.

2277
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:45,540
Stocks go up.

2278
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,180
Numbers up.

2279
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,520
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

2280
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,280
Wait, we're not even...

2281
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,340
Buy high, sell low.

2282
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,100
Wait, you did stock market, right?

2283
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,800
No, I...

2284
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,960
Nothing happened.

2285
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,460
No.

2286
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,900
I hear nothing.

2287
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,700
Wait, but weren't we at the radio?

2288
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,580
Hey, we're going loud anyway.

2289
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,060
Um...

2290
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,160
Um...

2291
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:32,500
Oh.

2292
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,220
Yeah, hold on.

2293
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,200
I'm choking this guy.

2294
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:34,920
He's into it.

2295
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,200
I'm doing lockpick.

2296
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,180
I did it.

2297
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:40,520
Okay.

2298
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,640
And then, that's it.

2299
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,780
There's nothing in this room.

2300
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,240
I did the lockpick, but I don't know for what reason.

2301
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,440
Wait, how many times can you answer the...

2302
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,420
Oh, three radios.

2303
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:51,940
Okay.

2304
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,540
He's enjoying it, man.

2305
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,260
What do you mean by that?

2306
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,840
What are you doing to him?

2307
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,280
I don't know.

2308
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:02,920
Oh, shit.

2309
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,040
What happened there?

2310
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:05,620
Nothing.

2311
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,840
Nothing's going on.

2312
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:10,940
Nothing.

2313
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,240
Nothing.

2314
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,340
I hear there's nothing going on.

2315
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:16,680
No, nothing's going on.

2316
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,400
Can you answer the radio?

2317
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,620
What did you do?

2318
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,160
What did you do?

2319
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,860
What did I do?

2320
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,720
You shot him!

2321
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:30,440
You shot him!

2322
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,680
He was calling his colleagues.

2323
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,600
Oh, what did I do?

2324
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,560
Surely, your manipulative skill does not work on your coworkers.

2325
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:49,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, Mr. I don't want to do stealth with you because every time I do stealth, I'm always able to do it successfully by myself.

2326
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,360
Clearly, clearly, that's a fucking lie.

2327
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,620
No, no, no.

2328
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,520
Clearly, that's a fucking lie.

2329
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,960
Where's the fucking zipline?

2330
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,040
Where is the zipline?

2331
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,160
Oh, wait, it's the elevator.

2332
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:05,960
This one.

2333
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,260
Power down the elevator.

2334
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,570
Guys, it wasn't me.

2335
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:15,710
It cannot be me, guys.

2336
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:17,010
It cannot be me.

2337
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,190
He didn't see me.

2338
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,630
Tengen literally shot him.

2339
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:23,510
If it was me, why did Tengen shot him?

2340
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:29,430
If it was me, how come Tengen shot him?

2341
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,310
I didn't even shoot him.

2342
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:33,250
I was beating him up.

2343
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:35,450
That makes it better?

2344
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:37,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2345
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:37,870
How does that make it better?

2346
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:39,990
How does it make it better?

2347
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,050
I had to choke a guy for three minutes.

2348
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:44,090
Okay, but like...

2349
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,990
That makes it...

2350
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,850
Sorry, I did not know you were into that.

2351
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,090
He was into that.

2352
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,990
And who was enabling his...

2353
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:56,890
Where is the ship?

2354
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:57,410
I don't know.

2355
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,090
I'm doing this.

2356
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:59,630
Fuck you now.

2357
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,290
I don't even...

2358
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:03,850
Oh, no.

2359
01:27:04,830 --> 01:27:05,830
They're here.

2360
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:06,870
They're here.

2361
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:09,750
They're here now.

2362
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:11,070
Where's the ship line?

2363
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:13,530
I don't fucking know.

2364
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,270
Okay, I got it.

2365
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:17,390
Where was it?

2366
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:20,610
It's in the fucking ventilation.

2367
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:22,350
Oh, you had to go to the vent?

2368
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:23,370
You got vented?

2369
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:23,830
Yeah.

2370
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:25,370
I...

2371
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,550
Oh,

2372
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:35,910
shit.

2373
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:38,790
That's kinda sus, bro.

2374
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:43,950
Okay.

2375
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:44,830
Okay, nice.

2376
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:46,990
Okay.

2377
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:49,590
It has to be to the right.

2378
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:50,570
The one here.

2379
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:51,030
Right?

2380
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:52,610
Should be.

2381
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:54,730
You, right?

2382
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:56,230
You have to deactivate it, I think.

2383
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:58,110
Oh, I actually shot it.

2384
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:01,990
Is this?

2385
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:03,630
There's only one elevator.

2386
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:05,070
There's multiple.

2387
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:05,710
Oh, wait.

2388
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:06,350
Back there.

2389
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:07,490
The one's back there.

2390
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:11,290
What the fuck is this music?

2391
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,550
Which one is the deactivated elevator?

2392
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:17,590
Follow me.

2393
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:20,410
Oh, shit.

2394
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:20,510
Oh, shit.

2395
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,910
I unlocked elevators right here.

2396
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:28,090
That saxophone is fucking going crazy right now.

2397
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:28,830
I found it.

2398
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:29,330
I found it.

2399
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:29,850
I found it.

2400
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,710
I'm prying open.

2401
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:33,230
I'm pulling it open.

2402
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:34,330
Thanks for helping, guys.

2403
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:36,670
Get the zipline.

2404
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,110
Alright, I'm going down.

2405
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:45,230
Cancel.

2406
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,970
Okay.

2407
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:51,470
Yes.

2408
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,330
I saw that.

2409
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,670
Civilians, get the fuck down.

2410
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:58,410
Get the fuck down or I'm going to shoot you.

2411
01:28:58,530 --> 01:28:59,830
Get the fuck down.

2412
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,410
Alright, I got him.

2413
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:03,990
Oh, shit.

2414
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:04,710
Wait, don't follow me.

2415
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,850
We're manipulating the market.

2416
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:10,010
Oh my god, let's go.

2417
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:12,270
Let's go.

2418
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,390
Go up.

2419
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:15,910
No fucking way.

2420
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:17,210
How are we going to get caught?

2421
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,230
How are we going to get caught?

2422
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:19,050
We're wearing masks.

2423
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:20,450
We're literally wearing masks.

2424
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,510
They will never know.

2425
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,010
Oh my god.

2426
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,490
We're going to save Concord, guys.

2427
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:34,870
We're going to short Concord.

2428
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:41,670
No, we can manipulate the numbers to go up for Concord and save it.

2429
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:44,550
We can put Concord back in the market.

2430
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,370
No, he can't be dead.

2431
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:51,430
We can save Concord.

2432
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,860
Why do I have a drill for this though?

2433
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,220
Wait, is that the...

2434
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,680
Oh, that's the CEO.

2435
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,020
Hey man, the CEO needs to live.

2436
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,800
Holy shit, look at his fucking office.

2437
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,500
Oh, I can't even shoot.

2438
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:17,120
Oh my god, he has his own coffee machine and everything.

2439
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,140
This guy was bougie as fuck.

2440
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,440
Let's see.

2441
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,440
Holy shit.

2442
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,200
That guy was so bougie.

2443
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,280
There was like coffee machines.

2444
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,460
His entire office is gold colored.

2445
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,220
He has golden statues.

2446
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:38,200
He has three, he has four, five monitors.

2447
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,400
What is he going to do with five monitors?

2448
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,160
What is he going to do with five monitors?

2449
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:42,660
Monitor the stocks?

2450
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,760
That's literally the reason why people have a lot of them.

2451
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:53,180
He can have one monitor, we can have at least two monitors with like three tabs.

2452
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,220
No.

2453
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,620
I'm beating the shit out of this piece of shit drill.

2454
01:30:59,640 --> 01:30:59,820
Oh, you're hammering it?

2455
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,560
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

2456
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:03,900
Hammer time.

2457
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:06,080
Alright, nice.

2458
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,140
I love how that just fixes everything.

2459
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,680
Piece of shit drill.

2460
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:15,280
Search the office for transaction files?

2461
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,280
I guess like here.

2462
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,460
I'm looking.

2463
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,100
Look at the other one.

2464
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,860
Oh my god, maybe I can find Concord.

2465
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,720
Yeah, put them back in the store.

2466
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:30,180
We gotta find Concord and put it back in the stock market, guys.

2467
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,540
We're gonna save Concord.

2468
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:34,160
We're gonna save Concord, guys!

2469
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,080
There's hope.

2470
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,980
There's actual hope.

2471
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:42,080
Oh my god, surely one of them is Concord.

2472
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:46,020
Surely, surely one of them is it.

2473
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,380
I'm missing one more.

2474
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,220
Oh, I found it.

2475
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,280
One more Concord.

2476
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,460
No, it's never too late, guys.

2477
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,560
That's what stock market manipulation means.

2478
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,780
This is exactly why I got into the business.

2479
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:04,580
The business?

2480
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:05,760
Yeah.

2481
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:10,320
I got into the heist business so I could bring back Concord.

2482
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,540
We're shorting it, though.

2483
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,920
Okay, you're shorting it.

2484
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,240
I'm fucking trying to save it.

2485
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,280
Then why are you here?

2486
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,240
What do you mean, shorting it?

2487
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,320
Yeah, we're shorting it.

2488
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,560
Wait, no, we're not.

2489
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,740
No way, no, don't say that.

2490
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,080
Top left.

2491
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,240
Don't say that.

2492
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:34,220
Get down!

2493
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:34,980
No!

2494
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:35,760
No!

2495
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:39,260
I actually almost shot him.

2496
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,380
I almost shot him.

2497
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:42,840
Oh shit.

2498
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,520
Look at the margin.

2499
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:45,080
No!

2500
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,800
No!

2501
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,540
Look at the margin right there.

2502
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:56,160
I wanted to save you!

2503
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,720
I tried so hard.

2504
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,940
I tried so hard to save Concord.

2505
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:07,620
I thought I was gonna be the one.

2506
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:08,620
Okay,

2507
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,320
it's like right here.

2508
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,480
Guys, I fucked up.

2509
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,280
Guys, it's just you.

2510
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,780
I messed up.

2511
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,320
I messed up Tenjin.

2512
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:30,120
Not the numbers!

2513
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:30,240
Not the numbers!

2514
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:34,100
Okay.

2515
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,960
I got some medibags.

2516
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,260
I got it.

2517
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,440
I'm so sad.

2518
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,760
I thought we could save Concord.

2519
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:49,920
I thought there was hope.

2520
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:51,660
There is.

2521
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:53,940
No, we're shorting it.

2522
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,820
That means all hope is lost.

2523
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:00,820
Goodbye.

2524
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,480
We're gone.

2525
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:08,940
Oh, it's over here.

2526
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,920
I just ate their donut.

2527
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,200
I'm connecting.

2528
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:12,940
Oh, you're connecting.

2529
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,220
I can't believe it.

2530
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,000
I knew I should have manipulated it hard enough.

2531
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:18,020
I knew it.

2532
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,320
Oh my god.

2533
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:22,800
Oh my god.

2534
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,120
It's going down.

2535
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,210
Yeah, activate the circuit breaker.

2536
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:35,290
Where's the circuit breaker?

2537
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:37,750
Oh, it's over here.

2538
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,890
I'm heading over.

2539
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,530
Don't worry, they're shooting you.

2540
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:45,170
Sure.

2541
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:49,510
Wait, how the fuck?

2542
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:50,230
X4.

2543
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:51,250
X4.

2544
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:56,070
X4 is right here.

2545
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,470
What the fuck are you looking at?

2546
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:59,590
Right here.

2547
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:00,910
How do you see that?

2548
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:01,850
I'm seeing X's.

2549
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,090
Oh, X4.

2550
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:05,850
I knew that.

2551
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:10,410
I'll keep looking at the...

2552
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:12,250
I'll keep looking at the stock market.

2553
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:15,110
I'll tell you the...

2554
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:16,310
...circuit breaker.

2555
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,150
Guys, it's going up.

2556
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:18,090
Guys, I knew it.

2557
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:19,030
We're saving Concord.

2558
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:19,950
It's going up.

2559
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,010
Look, Tengen is going up.

2560
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:24,070
It's going up, Tengen.

2561
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:28,230
Oh my god, I knew it.

2562
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:29,270
We're saving it.

2563
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,030
It's alive.

2564
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:33,410
Oh my god, we're gonna...

2565
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:34,650
Guys, it's possible.

2566
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:35,830
Wait, what?

2567
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,050
How did he not die?

2568
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:38,470
I knew it.

2569
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,650
I knew you guys.

2570
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:42,550
I knew you guys were...

2571
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:44,970
...were fucking with me.

2572
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:46,410
I never gave up.

2573
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:49,430
I never backed down.

2574
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,490
What do you know?

2575
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:57,270
I know the new Apex season is coming up.

2576
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,570
In Tuesday.

2577
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:02,130
I can't leak anything.

2578
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:03,570
I have to wait until the 5th.

2579
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:06,390
I actually...

2580
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:08,730
I can't legally say anything.

2581
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:09,970
I see.

2582
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:10,890
I see.

2583
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:12,610
I mean, I can tell you.

2584
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:14,650
No, I cannot.

2585
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:16,630
I signed a contract.

2586
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:20,570
I knew it.

2587
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:22,070
I can't, guys.

2588
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:23,490
I can't have a good relationship...

2589
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:25,490
...with Respawn.

2590
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:32,410
All I'm saying is that...

2591
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:34,070
Oh, sorry.

2592
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:35,050
I was not paying.

2593
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:37,210
It's 7455.

2594
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:39,910
7455.

2595
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:41,650
7455.

2596
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:43,810
Next...

2597
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:44,690
...circuit breaker.

2598
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:45,490
A6.

2599
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:49,050
Where is A6?

2600
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:53,550
Guys, it's crazy though.

2601
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:54,690
It's so crazy.

2602
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:57,010
It's so crazy.

2603
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,590
The new...

2604
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:01,170
My only problem with Apex right now is just the time to kill.

2605
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:08,990
Like, you think it's too long or too short?

2606
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:09,710
Too long.

2607
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:12,110
Too fucking long, man.

2608
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:16,090
What?

2609
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:16,370
Wait.

2610
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:19,350
That's the wrong panel.

2611
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:21,690
I'm not gonna say anything more.

2612
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,350
That's the wrong panel.

2613
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:32,850
That's a laugh of...

2614
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:35,290
...something of the opposite, I think.

2615
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,210
I see your laugh.

2616
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:44,790
You're welcome.

2617
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:46,750
I gave him a shoulder pain.

2618
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:50,250
Oh, man.

2619
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:50,830
That's...

2620
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:51,530
...awkward.

2621
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,130
That's so awkward.

2622
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:57,610
The thing you don't like the most...

2623
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:58,470
...is the time to kill.

2624
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:00,690
That's so awkward.

2625
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:02,010
I knew it.

2626
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:05,030
I fucking knew it.

2627
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:07,670
I fucking knew it.

2628
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:12,510
Oh, man.

2629
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:15,290
I guess you'll find out on Tuesday.

2630
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:18,130
Surely, they won't add like a fucking...

2631
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:18,590
You'll find out on Tuesday.

2632
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:21,670
Surely, they won't add like a...

2633
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:23,650
...six layer armor.

2634
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:25,290
You'll find out on Tuesday.

2635
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:27,270
Yippee!

2636
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,470
I'm streaming it.

2637
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,070
Of course, I was streaming the launch of Apex.

2638
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:39,890
Toki, shut up.

2639
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,270
I didn't say anything!

2640
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,810
What did I say?

2641
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,510
I didn't say anything.

2642
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:47,930
She didn't say anything.

2643
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:51,290
I got no fucking clue.

2644
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:53,370
Yeah, he doesn't even know what's going on.

2645
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:56,110
He doesn't even know what's going on.

2646
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,950
He doesn't even know what's going on.

2647
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,090
He's so clueless.

2648
01:39:01,150 --> 01:39:02,090
Oh, my God.

2649
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:02,790
Oh, it's 333.

2650
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:04,850
No, that's the wrong code.

2651
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,510
Oh, okay.

2652
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:06,550
Which one is the code?

2653
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:07,650
Right here.

2654
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:08,730
I'm hacking it.

2655
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:10,070
Shit.

2656
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:10,730
What the fuck?

2657
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:16,110
There's a security room right here.

2658
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:19,930
Man, I wonder what happens if we were able to get that security room.

2659
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:23,110
Oh, it's like the camera.

2660
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:24,290
Oh, it's like the camera.

2661
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:24,670
Yeah, a camera.

2662
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:25,970
It's a disabled camera.

2663
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:29,870
Ow, my armor just got chunked.

2664
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,090
Holy fuck.

2665
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,210
Oh, shit!

2666
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:35,670
I was like, who's shooting me from behind?

2667
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:41,890
Oh, we're cleaning your mess up, little guy.

2668
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:49,330
I was like, I had a really bad obsession with Deadlock.

2669
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:55,570
Because I realized that Seven is a more fun character to play in the end.

2670
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:56,750
You play Seven?

2671
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,890
Yeah, I used to play Abrams.

2672
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:01,030
Because Surefour taught me Abrams.

2673
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:05,010
And it was like the character I knew how to play.

2674
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,390
And then I learned how to play Seven.

2675
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:08,130
I did that because I hated the game.

2676
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:11,330
I was not enjoying the game playing Abrams.

2677
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:17,190
And then one of my friends was like, oh, you should try out Seven.

2678
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:18,410
You might like Seven more.

2679
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:22,510
So then I played Seven and I was so fucking obsessed with Seven.

2680
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:28,450
But it's also because it was Pew Pew, right?

2681
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:35,550
And then I was trying to be like, oh, come on guys, let's play Deadlock.

2682
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,290
I want to play, I want to play.

2683
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:40,450
I would be begging people to play Deadlock with me so I can play Seven.

2684
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:42,730
But at one point, no one was online.

2685
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:43,450
And I was like, you know what?

2686
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:44,970
I'm going to solo queue Seven.

2687
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:46,290
I want to do it.

2688
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:53,830
And now I don't like Deadlock anymore.

2689
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:54,290
Yeah.

2690
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:58,350
That happens.

2691
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,970
And now I beat the addiction.

2692
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:04,970
Did you put Seven in high priority?

2693
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:06,570
Yeah, yeah, the highest priority.

2694
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:07,890
Like the purple one?

2695
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2696
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:10,210
That explains why it's shit.

2697
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:11,250
Wait, why?

2698
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:12,410
I don't know.

2699
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:17,510
I just feel like every time I put a hero in high priority, it's so shit.

2700
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:19,650
Because people are like, oh, you took my Seven.

2701
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:20,830
Oh, oh.

2702
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,950
And they're playing like they're not main characters.

2703
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:25,030
So they're like, oh, you took Seven.

2704
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:25,570
Oh.

2705
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:27,790
I got like three games.

2706
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:31,250
And two games of that were people crying that I took their Seven.

2707
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:32,550
And stuff.

2708
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,950
So then like, obviously people were playing super fucking...

2709
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:35,350
That's a thing?

2710
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:38,010
Yeah, people were like crying about it.

2711
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:39,870
But anyway, anyway.

2712
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,870
I stopped playing Deadlock after that.

2713
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:44,710
Because I was like, this game is shit.

2714
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:50,030
I beat the addiction after that.

2715
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,610
Yeah.

2716
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:55,410
It's only fun when you're playing with other people.

2717
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:56,570
I found out.

2718
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:57,310
Yeah.

2719
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:59,650
It's not fun solo queue.

2720
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:03,650
Wait, what's Chainz doing?

2721
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:06,530
Oh, sorry.

2722
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:08,430
7472.

2723
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,590
Wait, what's 7472?

2724
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:12,590
No, 7470.

2725
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:14,330
You do it?

2726
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,650
No, enter it, enter it.

2727
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:18,070
Did you enter it?

2728
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:19,830
I haven't.

2729
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:22,050
Oh, I got you.

2730
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:22,750
I'm covering.

2731
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,270
Uh-huh.

2732
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:27,850
Are you getting your ass kicked?

2733
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:29,210
Yeah.

2734
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,190
You had a feeling.

2735
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:32,850
Like he just dropped in a hatch.

2736
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:36,170
Yeah, I was gonna be like, where did he come from?

2737
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,290
There was no openings.

2738
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:39,790
Drones.

2739
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:41,390
Fuck.

2740
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:42,230
Goddamn drones.

2741
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,830
No!

2742
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:46,370
Oh, God!

2743
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:47,370
This is why the game failed.

2744
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:50,630
We were the reason why the game failed.

2745
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:52,350
Yeah, we shut down a market.

2746
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,310
We shut down Concord.

2747
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:56,110
It was us all along!

2748
01:42:56,930 --> 01:42:58,130
Oh, my God!

2749
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,110
Yes, it was.

2750
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:00,210
It was us all along!

2751
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:03,370
I've become the villain.

2752
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:06,630
If you live long enough to become the villain.

2753
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:09,150
No!

2754
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,550
It was me.

2755
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:17,710
I wanted to save Concord and I ended up shutting down their entire offices.

2756
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:21,470
Oh, hey.

2757
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,530
There's armor here.

2758
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:25,670
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2759
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:27,350
Oh, it's this thing.

2760
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,190
Alright, we'll shut down a market.

2761
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:34,330
Timeline save.

2762
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,470
We were actually secret time travelers.

2763
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:41,350
We traveled back in time to make sure Concord failed.

2764
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:46,530
It was us all along!

2765
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:49,870
We made sure it was a canon event.

2766
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:52,890
Boom.

2767
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:54,390
Everything was on red on the screen.

2768
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:54,850
Holy shit.

2769
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:56,770
It went from green to red.

2770
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,710
That wasn't going to do nothing.

2771
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:00,510
We have to get back to the roof.

2772
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,410
While we're doing that.

2773
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:06,130
Right here.

2774
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:07,290
It was us.

2775
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:08,470
That's right, chat.

2776
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:10,370
It was us all along!

2777
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:16,010
Up we go.

2778
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:18,670
Say thank you to me.

2779
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,080
We could have done anything else with our time traveling abilities.

2780
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:28,580
Instead, we shut down Concord.

2781
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,360
It was just much more important.

2782
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:32,900
Wait, here?

2783
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,560
Oh, here.

2784
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:38,520
I found it.

2785
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:40,980
He's behind a door.

2786
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:45,340
He's behind a door.

2787
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:46,060
He's behind a door.

2788
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,040
Give me a break.

2789
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:53,180
He waited there for like three hours.

2790
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:57,500
He's like, eventually he's going to show up.

2791
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:02,920
Thank god it was a canon event.

2792
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,240
Alright.

2793
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:07,600
Replace it.

2794
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,360
I got a satellite dish.

2795
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,120
Okay.

2796
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,820
We made our own.

2797
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,540
We're fucking engineers, apparently.

2798
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,780
We made our own fucking satellite dish.

2799
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,900
Yeah, because everything is on an EMP.

2800
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,100
Alright.

2801
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:21,820
Nice.

2802
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,380
Okay, we have to guard it now.

2803
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:28,180
Oh my god, we're almost safe.

2804
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:31,580
We're installing Wi-Fi right now.

2805
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:32,620
We're desperate.

2806
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:37,500
Guys, even heist robbers need Wi-Fi.

2807
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:44,080
Next time, next time we save Harambe.

2808
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,440
Yeah, we'll save Harambe.

2809
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,160
We were the ones that took the shot.

2810
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,380
Yeah, yeah.

2811
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,860
We were the ones who shot him.

2812
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:57,240
We were the ones that took the shot.

2813
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,120
No!

2814
01:45:59,120 --> 01:45:59,560
No!

2815
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:07,660
Now you know how I felt when I wanted to save Concord.

2816
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,960
It was a canon event.

2817
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,940
It was a canon event.

2818
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:13,060
You can't avoid it.

2819
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:19,540
Tenjin was the kid.

2820
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:20,440
He was the bait.

2821
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,480
And I was the one with the rifle.

2822
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,140
It was me, baby.

2823
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,100
It was me.

2824
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:31,080
It was me, baby.

2825
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,940
Yeah, finish the sentence.

2826
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:34,760
Finish the sentence.

2827
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,640
You know exactly how it goes.

2828
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:38,040
Tenjin, finish this.

2829
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,000
How does it go?

2830
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,700
How does it go, Tenjin?

2831
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,160
Yes, I do.

2832
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,080
I do know how it goes.

2833
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:46,440
Do I?

2834
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:48,900
Do I know how it goes?

2835
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:57,580
Do I know how it goes?

2836
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,360
Jesus Christ, is he still alive?

2837
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:08,240
He's still alive!

2838
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,580
Oh my God, he's running!

2839
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,320
This

2840
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:17,600
guy!

2841
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,940
I'm so dead.

2842
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:22,900
I'm so dead.

2843
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,840
I'm so dead.

2844
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:24,880
I'm actually so dead.

2845
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:25,840
Okay.

2846
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:28,120
Did we fix it?

2847
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,740
Did we fix it?

2848
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,200
Boom.

2849
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:29,900
Boom.

2850
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:31,260
There we go.

2851
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:31,720
I fixed it.

2852
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:33,520
I'm like one HP.

2853
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:34,560
I'm dead.

2854
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,880
I think I have one more life.

2855
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,840
I do not have armor.

2856
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,420
Does any of our guys have armor?

2857
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:50,020
I don't know.

2858
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:52,400
Oh my God, please.

2859
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:59,170
Oh, readjust the crane's position?

2860
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:00,250
Yeah, I readjusted.

2861
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:04,950
Holy shit, hurry the fuck up.

2862
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:06,870
This is the slowest crane known to man.

2863
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:07,910
Oh my God.

2864
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:09,410
What's going on?

2865
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,250
Guys, please.

2866
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:12,650
I need to use the Wi-Fi.

2867
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:17,370
I'm going through withdrawals right now.

2868
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:19,150
I know.

2869
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:21,270
I broke my armor.

2870
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:24,970
Well...

2871
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:28,410
I think you might have to clutch this yourself, Tengen.

2872
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:30,170
I'm not doing so well.

2873
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:31,650
Oh, Mr. Stark.

2874
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:32,890
I'm not feeling so good.

2875
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:35,110
The crane's here.

2876
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,170
Mr. Stark, I don't feel so well.

2877
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:40,170
Mr. Stark, what if I die from doing this job?

2878
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,610
You're alive.

2879
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:44,850
Here.

2880
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:46,990
Use this.

2881
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,610
Wait, where did you...

2882
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:50,590
Why did you not put this out sooner?

2883
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:52,210
Why did you not...

2884
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:53,270
No, you're fine.

2885
01:48:54,370 --> 01:48:56,450
Oh my God, we did it.

2886
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:58,390
We did it!

2887
01:48:58,710 --> 01:48:59,510
We did it.

2888
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:00,630
We're gamers.

2889
01:49:01,810 --> 01:49:02,790
Let's go!

2890
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:04,770
We're out of here.

2891
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:07,150
Oh my God.

2892
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:08,690
Easy.

2893
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:14,110
Easiest game of my life.

2894
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:15,510
We did it.

2895
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:17,840
Concord is no more.

2896
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:22,170
Concord is no more.

2897
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:23,090
We did it.

2898
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:25,690
We made sure Concord failed.

2899
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,550
Sadly, it was a canon event.

2900
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:34,610
My hero.

2901
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:39,630
Except Harambe.

2902
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:46,830
We gotta make sure he stays down.

2903
01:49:47,970 --> 01:49:48,530
Yes.

2904
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:50,190
Still is.

2905
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:53,270
That was fun though.

2906
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:55,550
That was fun checking out the first year anniversary.

2907
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:56,970
It was.

2908
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:58,290
Yeah, it definitely...

2909
01:49:58,290 --> 01:50:00,190
It's a lot different, right?

2910
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:01,630
From when it first came out.

2911
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:02,290
Yes.

2912
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:03,650
A lot different.

2913
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:09,610
Yeah, so if you guys didn't know, for the first year anniversary, they updated a lot.

2914
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,690
A lot of stuff to it.

2915
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:15,950
Like Tenjin said, there's new server browsers, new UI, a lot of new updates to it.

2916
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:19,210
Graphic-wise, UI-wise, even the voice.

2917
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:22,590
In-game voice was updated a lot as well.

2918
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:24,370
We tested it out and it was pretty good.

2919
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:28,950
But yeah, huge shout-out to Pay...

2920
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:29,830
I almost said PayPal.

2921
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:34,170
Huge shout-out to PayPal 3.

2922
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:37,150
To PayDay 3 for sponsoring me.

2923
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:45,390
So please, if you want to support the stream, if you want to support PayDay, click on the link on my description or pin in the chat.

2924
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:51,210
Anyway, also thank you to Tenjin for playing with me today on a sponsored stream.

2925
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:53,090
I appreciate it.

2926
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:56,590
We tried to find two more people, but like, we didn't.

2927
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:58,710
The time was short.

2928
01:50:58,910 --> 01:50:59,750
It was very short.

2929
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:01,190
We were like, who do we get?

2930
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:03,270
And Tenjin was like, I don't fucking know my brother.

2931
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:05,070
And then I was like, fuck it.

2932
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:08,150
But then apparently his brother had to add classes and stuff.

2933
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,650
Who do we get?

2934
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:16,690
We have to make it look like we have to get people so we look like we know what we're doing.

2935
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:27,210
We need to find people that knows how to play PayDay and like, you know, make us look like this game is super fun because it is.

2936
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:29,650
And...

2937
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:30,710
It is.

2938
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:31,670
It was really fun.

2939
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:32,890
You saw it yourself, guys.

2940
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:34,330
Yeah, it was very fun.

2941
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:35,570
The new missions.

2942
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:38,330
There's a lot of new missions and story stuff to it now, too.

2943
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:43,450
But yeah, thanks Tenjin for coming over and trying it out with me.

2944
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:47,330
And I hope you enjoy your free PayDay DLC.

2945
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:50,070
I will.

2946
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,690
I will.

2947
01:51:54,010 --> 01:52:01,530
But yeah, guys, I'm gonna go talk to my chat real quick now, Tenjin, but thank you again for stopping by.

2948
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:03,450
I really appreciate it.

2949
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,090
I'll see you later.

2950
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:06,650
I'll see you later, man.

2951
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:08,650
I got place to be.

2952
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:09,370
Alright.

2953
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:10,030
Take care now.

2954
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:10,770
Alright.

2955
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:12,610
Bye-bye.

2956
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:13,470
Bye.

2957
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:16,650
Alright, guys.

2958
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:19,070
Yeah, again, thank you for Tenjin for coming by.

2959
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:23,050
Like, it was very short notice getting him involved because I was like, I don't want to do this solo.

2960
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:24,830
I was like, I don't know.

2961
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,530
I feel like...

2962
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:27,750
I don't...

2963
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:37,770
I'm not very well versed in PayDay 3 in general compared to Tenjin.

2964
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:40,910
So I was like, I don't want to do this alone.

2965
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:41,930
I feel like if I should...

2966
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:44,190
I should...

2967
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:46,730
get someone that knows what they're doing.

2968
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:53,630
And so I'm really glad that Tenjin was available to play with me.

2969
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:56,430
And yeah, and again, thank you again to PayDay 3.

2970
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:59,410
It's really crazy to be sponsored by PayDay 3.

2971
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:10,390
I remember watching PayDay playthroughs from UberHacks or Nova growing up and, like, UberHacks or Nova and, like, ImmortalHD watching, like, PayDay playthroughs from them.

2972
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:17,730
Like, from the creatures because I remember they used to sponsor the creatures a lot back then and they had, like, special promotions with them and everything.

2973
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:24,230
So, like, it's really crazy to see myself being sponsored by PayDay 3 as well.

2974
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:28,710
So, like, it's just really crazy to think about.

2975
01:53:29,150 --> 01:53:36,090
Like, I watched PayDay 1 people play PayDay 1 growing up and then now I'm sponsored by PayDay 3.

2976
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:36,690
Like...

2977
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:45,990
I've been getting so many sponsors lately and it really does help a lot that you guys support me and support the sponsors as well.

2978
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:49,130
Because it lets me get more sponsors in general, too.

2979
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:52,170
So, it really does help a lot.

2980
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:56,810
So, yeah, huge shoutout to PayDay for sponsoring me and, like, it's very surreal to see it.

2981
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:58,950
Anyway, guys, I'm sorry for being late.

2982
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,470
I came back early.

2983
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:07,930
I even came back early to make sure that, like, I would be on time today.

2984
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:10,190
Like, because I always try to be on time for sponsors.

2985
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:11,210
I was like, alright, got it.

2986
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:12,170
And then...

2987
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:15,670
I left my phone at the Uber.

2988
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:16,970
I'm so sorry.

2989
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:19,510
I literally can't do anything.

2990
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:22,150
I couldn't stream without my phone.

2991
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:25,750
And so...

2992
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:29,150
I really appreciate you guys sticking it out.

2993
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:35,610
I really appreciate you guys, like, sticking it out and, like, being here.

2994
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:38,590
Even though that happened.

2995
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:41,890
I really appreciate it.

2996
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:46,350
That's actually the first time.

2997
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:50,630
That was the very first time I forgot my phone.

2998
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:52,730
I've never had that happen before.

2999
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:56,470
I've never forgotten my phone before.

3000
01:54:56,910 --> 01:55:01,250
This is the very first time my mind has been so scattered.

3001
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:10,130
Bro, the hotpot was so good.

3002
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:13,170
They had, like, live noodle making.

3003
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:17,450
They would make noodles for you and then it was so good.

3004
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,810
You don't understand.

3005
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:22,850
I spent $150 on hotpot.

3006
01:55:22,930 --> 01:55:24,850
It was so good.

3007
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:27,640
And then I bought bath bombs.

3008
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:30,970
I was like, today's your day, Doki.

3009
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:32,990
It's your day.

3010
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:39,930
Little do I know, it was not my day.

3011
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:47,970
It was not my day in the end.

3012
01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:54,990
MrBrokenBot, thank you for the magenta soup.

3013
01:55:55,670 --> 01:55:56,290
Thank you.

3014
01:55:58,690 --> 01:56:02,670
Hoping this covers the pain and torment of leaving your phone, Doki.

3015
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:04,750
Thank you for the magenta soup.

3016
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:06,450
Thank you.

3017
01:56:06,450 --> 01:56:08,090
Thank you.

3018
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:10,270
You spent $170.

3019
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:11,170
Oh, yeah.

3020
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:14,650
And then I forgot my phone.

3021
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:19,690
And then the Uber driver fucking blackmailed me for my phone.

3022
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:22,630
I was desperate.

3023
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:24,570
I was so desperate.

3024
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:25,750
Thank you.

3025
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:27,010
Thank you for the soup.

3026
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:27,990
Thank you.

3027
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:31,570
I am gonna call it here.

3028
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:39,450
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3029
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:46,370
If you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3030
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,670
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3031
01:56:48,850 --> 01:56:49,610
Bye, guys.

3032
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:52,750
This week is a lot of collabs.

3033
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:54,950
I'll try to balance it out with some solo streams.

3034
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:58,270
But...

3035
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:02,130
The rest of the stuff is crazy.

3036
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:04,950
Tomorrow, there's gonna be a big announcement regarding the rest stuff.

3037
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:13,010
So, I know it's gonna be in the rest kingdoms for a while now, but there's gonna be a big announcement regarding the rest stuff.

3038
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:19,130
If you guys know how the rest events on Twitch goes, you might have an idea what this announcement is.

3039
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:21,770
But anyway, guys, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3040
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:22,690
Bye, guys.

3041
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:23,550
Bye.
