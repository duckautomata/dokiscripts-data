1
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,710
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,950
Okay, look.

3
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,230
It was not my fault.

4
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,250
I was late this time.

5
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,470
Okay, I was ready.

6
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,810
I was so ready.

7
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,850
But the reason why I was a little bit late today is because
their game wasn't downloadable until launch day.

8
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,010
And then, even then, even then, they didn't put it up.

9
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,150
They didn't put up the download button until five to six
minutes later.

10
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,590
So it is not my fault.

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:32,240
This time, this time I take zero responsibility, okay guys,
I might have taken responsibility like in the past, but I

12
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,720
know for this one time, I do not take responsibility for
being late.

13
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,800
It was, it was not my fault.

14
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:51,720
Okay, at one point, I almost let the intrusive thoughts win
and like, because I was like, We're download button.

15
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
We're download button.

16
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,840
And I was like on Twitch.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,120
I was like, did anyone else got the download button on
Twitch?

18
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,460
Because I was like seeing like, oh, maybe some Twitch
Weemer.

19
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,760
So I got the download button.

20
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,920
And then I saw like Bandai was doing an official launch
stream of Sandland where they were like, you know, hyping up

21
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,420
Sandland.

22
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,940
And I almost typed in chat.

23
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,740
We're done.

24
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,840
I was gonna be one of those people Because they were like Oh
the gods are happy Because I was watching it Because I was

25
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,200
like Watching I was like Oh maybe don't know Don't tell us
if there's a delay And then And then they were like We hope

like I was typing us ready I was like we're down so ready I

28
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:07,060
almost was like we're down though I almost I almost did it
but I didn't let the intrusive thoughts win this time I

29
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,240
didn't become a Karen I was like okay I'll wait

30
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I'll wait a little bit but also because the moment I was
about to type it button showed up so i was saved by the

31
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:36,400
download button i was saved by the download button actually
showing up so so i didn't i didn't embarrass myself today in

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,960
front of i didn't embarrass myself in front of the poor pr
people at bandai because i think they were like they were

33
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:51,580
also like oh no where is the download button uh use it thank
you for the super chat thank you thank you dude thank you

34
00:04:51,580 --> 00:05:01,840
super chat thank you thank you all right for those who don't
know this game um this is sandland uh it is a game that's

35
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:11,060
based off the manga manga slash anime uh from akira toriama
and obviously this is like one of the first games that are

36
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:20,780
released you know post what's the word post hum hum i can't
pronounce it but you know um uh salute to akira toriama But

37
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,160
this was the first game to be released afterwards.

38
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,740
And, you know, I've been super hyped to check it out.

39
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,580
And I'm looking forward to it.

40
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:38,980
Apparently, I was like, I was like sort of like hesitant on
trying this out.

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,680
Because I saw it was like RPG.

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,220
But then I read that it was like action RPG.

43
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,200
So I was like, I like action.

44
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,700
Maybe the action will balance out the RPG.

45
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:02,840
maybe i was like maybe the action part will balance that out
and because like i'm not like a super because i don't really

46
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:13,240
have that much of an attention span for like rpgs and stuff
um rpgs are good don't get look it is called preferences and

47
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:26,240
and and and like i do not have the attention span for RPGs
especially like JRPGs because like I have such a low

48
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:36,700
attention span when it comes to like reading that that lore
goes from one ear to the other and then it disappears and I

49
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:47,840
would be playing the RPG part and I'd be like what the fuck
is going on I'd be like who's this guy again wait what's the

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:59,700
character who am I playing as what is her story I don't know
And then what I use Okay Here's a little tidbit about me

51
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:08,180
That will make you understand it more So in Pokemon games
When you select moves I make sure all my Pokemon moves Are

52
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:16,060
just straight on full attack I don't care about stats or
anything Like things that would get rid of stats Or and all

53
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:25,360
that stuff I just what I see the PP move And I was like does
more damage okay all four of my moves are ultimate damage

54
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:40,740
and so like you see that for pokemon that's four moves now
imagine like i play a jrpg slash rpg and it's all my moves

55
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:52,760
i'd be like okay all my moves just do damage in all my 20
moves that i have RPG that's all I know

56
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:06,000
and then if I if I am low okay do I have any heals oh I
don't because I put all my I put all my skills in just

57
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:24,180
damage oh okay so that is why that is why like for me I know
that I know that like the and jrpg stuff like i know for me

58
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,480
is definitely not my strongest suit so i was like okay maybe
the i saw i was watching the gameplay of it and i was like

59
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:41,340
oh okay i see a lot of open world action in there i was like
oh all right i can work with that i can work with the open

60
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:52,140
world part and i was like oh tanks i can work with that i
can work with the tanks too And I was like, all right, this

61
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,540
is good.

62
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,140
This is good.

63
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,780
This is it.

64
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm going to I'm going to try this out And then if you never
see a part two of this game, then you know why Dark Blade,

I want to pay to win.

84
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,940
A game that I don't know if we're going to get a part two
on.

85
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
I was like, I don't know if I'm going to get a part two.

86
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
But ooh, more items.

87
00:09:50,580 --> 00:10:01,560

93
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,440

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,520
This might get a little rowdy.

95
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,620
I'll increase it a bit louder.

96
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,960

99
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,260

become an an actual streamer Then then you realize Having

108
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:53,280
mods might might not be a bit may not be a bad idea Because
giving chat too much power It's a little stupid

109
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:09,920
If chat has too much power It'll just be Twitch It'll just
be a YouTube play Sandland Oh my god Oh my god Monty here

What the fuck?

126
00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:03,230
I never read or watched the anime of Sandland so this is
zero context for me I

127
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
think that's called a deep

128
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:21,540
motion what happens if I lose him bro there's no way I can
lose him there's no way I could go if I can't even run off

I've been spotted.

135
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,650
Okay, that guy's just a centaur.

136
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,070
I can't believe he grouped up the centaur with an actual...

137
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,570
Oh, shit!

138
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,350
I'm sorry.

139
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:48,970
I'm sorry.

140
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,610
I was trying to be a streamer.

Okay, not gonna lie.

All right.

146
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,310
This is a little bit of a nitpicky, but like, I hate the
subtitle font.

147
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:23,970
the subtitle font is pretty pretty bad oh my god they're in
the middle of nowhere thanks for the water you're just gonna

being stuck in the middle of the desert is there's no water

Yeah, it does nothing.

158
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,490
There's no sense of... There's no sense of, like, actual
urgency.

159
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,790

196
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,400
just because it's anime it doesn't mean it's better than the
original guys

197
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,840
it's like okay To be fair, the anime Bible is sort of better
than the regular Okay,

198
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:04,480
this is my opinion Okay, guys, so in case I get canceled or
anything Just remember, this was my opinion But I think

199
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,420
anime Jesus is a bit better than the regular Jesus

200
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,080
Hey, aren't you just pushing your chores on me?

201
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:30,700

202
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:39,240
off of it all right after accepting a new quest a quest icon
will appear on the map to show where you should go to

overall volume including voice or is it just like some parts

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:50,720
Alright.

219
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,580
Let's see.

220
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,140
I have to go this way.

221
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,800
I wonder how many of these NPCs are just one guy doing like
10 voices.

222
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,540
Oh, Prince.

223

226
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,100
Raptor Scales.

227
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, it's not even a regular side quest.

228
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,740
Hey.

229
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,940

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,240
We're free?

231
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,040
What kind of fucking demon are you?

232
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,260
Water toadout.

233
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Thank you for the super chat.

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,300
Thank you.

235
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:31,760
Thank you.

236
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,860
Using that logic, does that mean non-animated dokey bird is
better than animated dokey bird?

237
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,220
Thank you for the super chat.

238
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,740
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,120
You're a demon.

240
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,500
You can't die from dehydration.

241
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:47,960
Okay.

242
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,740
Oh, yeah, I've learned my lesson.

243
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,480
Here, take this as thanks.

244
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,560
Oh, I get stuff.

245
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,160
Oh, my God.

246
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,560
I got something in return.

247
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,580
I got B-grade steel.

248
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,240
Nice.

249
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,900
All right, at least, I guess helping people is good
sometimes.

250
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,080
I guess sometime it's good.

251
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,220
Oh, I just, like, walked away from him.

252
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,780
Was I supposed to help him?

253
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,940
I liked how I was supposed to talk to him I was like alright
anyway and the game was like wait come back wait did you

254
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:43,840
forgot this one kid whoa are you alright got some water for
you and I'm gonna die here you go here's some water I guess

255
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,340
I'm running out

256
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,060
It's just a side character.

257
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,180
Leave him.

258
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,940
By the way, raise up the volume.

259
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,880
Let me know if it's better.

260
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,960
Sound guy.

261
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,560
Yeah, you know what?

262
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,560
Fuck the humans.

263
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,240
If we let more humans die, there's more chances for them to
become demons.

264
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,860
So smart.

265
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
Alright, we go.

266
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,320
Oh yeah, go talk to us.

267
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,880
slime.

268
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,960
Because apparently he's also dying.

269
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,120
Oh, I can double jump now.

270
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh.

271
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,360
Hello.

272
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,680
Is that him?

273
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Is that him?

274
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,900
Oh, I thought I could step on him.

275
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,720
Hello.

276
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Hello.

277
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
I don't think he looks okay.

278
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,580
No.

279
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,120
No.

280
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,220
There's still time.

281
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,400
Throw it on him now.

282
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,820
No.

283
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,360
No.

284
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,340
No need to yell.

285
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,420
But if he's the slime king and I'm the prince demon, it
would be a shame.

286
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,960
Okay, it would be a shame if I don't do it in time.

287
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,340
Wait, actually.

288
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,820
It would be such a shame if I...

289
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,040
If we ran out of time.

290
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,400
Oh, no.

291
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,760
Long live the king.

I thought they said slime king He's just a regular slime.

299
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,670
I wasted all my water on this one slime I

300
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,650
should have been survival of the fittest if he was dumb
enough to get like melted by the sun he did not deserve to

301
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:52,870
live why the world have to end up like this we need to we
need to have powerful slimes around 50 years now ever since

kind ruler what's that What does that mean?

303
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,110
I said bring up the volume a little bit more already.

304
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,970
I just brought up the volume.

305
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:19,570
Well, they just kept on waiting their pointless wars.

306
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,940
Oh, wait, what?

307
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,700

Anime World of tanks.

318
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,140
Just like anime Mad Max.

319
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,900
How do I do my Nitro?

320
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,980

00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,520
planet

330
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:19,040
just because of one stupid mistake man i wish somebody would
have make a compilation of like all his like vehicle art or

331
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:27,720
vehicle designs they're all so creative too so what are we
doing out here under the blazing sun

332
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:43,950
in some alternate universe instead of teslas we would have
toriyama vehicles this scorching desolate desert sand land

333
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:51,170
why man I wonder why

334
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:11,550
but a chance encounter is about to change this dying
wasteland forever oh my god is the iconic is the iconic toy

335
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,070
on my car or bike

336
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:31,700
girl Sandlot Boma!

337
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,180
Mr.

338
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,760
Hercules!

339
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,880
That's right.

340
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,600
I'm a human.

341
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,380
I come from a neighboring town.

342
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
But like, what if he just has no muscles?

343
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,840
I want to ask for you demons' help.

344
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,660
Now, is one of your leaders willing to listen to what i have
to say

345
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:19,460
oh my god mr satan i don't know why i said mr hercules he
even has an s for a badge

346
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:31,540
you've got guts showing your face around here i see him as
hercules instead of satan so are you the demon's leader

347
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:38,700
that's me the great king lucifer is our Oh, that's my dad.

348
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,460
Hercules was his Christian name.

349
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,240
I'm the fiend prince Beals above.

350
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,760
Oh, his English name is Hercules.

351
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,460
I knew it.

352
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,520
I was like, oh my God, did I actually fucked up?

353
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,300
I watched Dragon Ball Z so much.

354
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,000
How did I confuse Hercules and Satan?

355
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,640
State your business.

356
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,840
I was like, okay, I might not have recently watched Dragon
Ball.

357
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,440
Bob, but I grew up with that.

358
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,640
How the fuck did I mess that up?

359
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,520
I like your assistance with my mission.

360
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,720
Searching for the legendary spring.

361
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,420
The legendary spring?

362
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,320
Explain.

363
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,100
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

364
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,400
Thank you.

365
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:31,900
Thank you.

366
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,580
Hi, Doki.

367
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,560
Love the content.

368
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,520
It's not a problem.

369
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,000
Will you mind wishing my friend Giggles a happy birthday?

370
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,240
It'll mean a lot to her.

371
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,900
Of course.

372
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
Happy birthday to you.

373
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:53,940
you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear giggles happy
birthday to you yeah you must have sunstroke or something

374
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:05,420
what oh sorry do you know a bird called the waterfinch a
waterfinch this bird feeds on small freshwater fish and

375
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:17,040
during its mating season flies north to lay eggs among the
rocky cliffs there it's still alive that's so beef it still

376
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:33,290
exists hmm it does sound familiar but how exactly is this
relevant because I saw a waterfinch flying north yesterday

377
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:43,190
oh my god that means there's water this means there must be
a spring with small fish to sustain these birds somewhere in

378
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,550
this There must not be a lot, though, because it's just one
pool of water.

379
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,230
But the desert to the south of here is dangerous and wild.

380
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,350
I doubt a lone human could make it even so far as halfway
across.

381
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,730
That's why I'm here.

382
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,930
I would like for a powerful demon to accompany me on my
journey.

383
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,790
Let's say we somehow managed to find this string.

384
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,850
Yeah, but what if we end up, like, eating all the food?

385
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:23,090
fish in the spring because like humans or demons are greedy
motherfuckers and because of that and then the fit and then

386
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:32,490
the birds will die and then we're gonna ruin the ecosystem
and then we're gonna have another global warming of course

387
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:43,070
if you like you're even free to live there yourself yeah two
by two water pod bro like it's a fucking spring not a lake

388
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:56,390
all we ask is to be allowed to take water we need to get by
so tell me is all this your idea or are you here on behalf

389
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:06,870
of the king there's a king too it's my plan alone is your
you guys have a king as well as if that greedy tyrant cares

390
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:15,430
for anyone other than himself i don't think the world can
get any warmer dokey must find this spring by ourselves for

391
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,970
the people

392
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:30,070
doesn't sound like a bad deal but we've been doing fine
stealing water for ourselves how about it working with a

393
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:38,370
human yeah why don't we trick him to tell us where the
spring is and then kill him please accept this as a token of

394
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,610
goodwill what the fuck is that like a playstation

395
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:55,190
Electricity which needs water The two game consoles to have
survived these chaotic times.

396
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,450
Oh my god, bro.

397
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:02,750
He gave me a playstation Pills, thank you for the tent get
this just thank you.

398
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:09,310
Thank you Don't I need water for to run electricity?

399
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,180
Is that that's a sad thing?

400
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,500
It looks like a PlayStation 1 to me.

401
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,020
I never had a Sega Saturn.

402
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,700
I thought it was a PlayStation 1 But like what if it's
black?

403
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,500
But it was like copyright free PlayStation 1

404
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,140
How are we guys how are we gonna play this game?

405
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,640
How are we gonna plug in the Sega Saturn?

406
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,180
There's still wind power does this look like we have?

407
00:37:49,200 --> 00:38:02,180
have wind solar powered dude does this look like we live in
a place that has electricity guys

408
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:19,010
join what like how's so that got any good dirt I like how
this guy has has voice acting oh heard about the peachy

409
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:31,950
prince uh yeah peachy that rings a bell what's that Their
aliens supposedly came to earth about 70 years ago And

410
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:42,930
shared their super advanced tech with humans I hear they've
all been wiped out by this point though Guys, if we had

411
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:52,130
electricity we would not be using fire as our light source
If we have solar powered because god damn we have so much

412
00:38:52,130 --> 00:39:00,670
solar Okay, it's...

413
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:01,670
Where is it?

414
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,230
Is it near?

415
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,050
I assume it's here because there's guards.

416
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,860
I hear you.

417
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,980
Magic, maybe.

418
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,740
I've yet to see anything that's powered by energy, guys.

419
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,760
Maybe it's the aesthetic.

420
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,840
Fire saves electricity.

421
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,860
Doki, you don't understand.

422
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,840
but we got tanks and cars we don't know if the demons have
tanks and cars we just saw the humans

to use that console for one hour one hour I'm already only

tutorial in kingdom hearts not even half that's like

427
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:51,880
one-fourth of a tutorial that's like 20 of the tutorial in
kingdom hearts

428
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:14,200
we're going in this how many passengers can fit Olivia, can
we fit our centaur?

429
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,000
Two.

430
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,420
Centaur.

431
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,640
He's, look at him.

432
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,660
He has abs.

433
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,480
Thief, I guess.

434
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,480
What?

435
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,100
He's old.

436
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Centaur has abs.

437
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,660
Look at him.

438
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,420
You're good at stealing.

439
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,300
Bro, he doesn't even get the car.

440
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,160
Just run behind us.

441
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,480
Grinch, I just thought of something.

442
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,220
Wouldn't it be easier to have someone who can fly, carry you
there?

443
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,000
Quit complaining and get your butt in here right now.

444
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,100
No, it's because he's strong.

445
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,200
Like, we...

446
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,160
Bro, he can just run after us with his horse legs.

447
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,920
Head to the legendary spring.

448
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:28,020
Believe in the old guy Two old men instead one why in
balance too many old men, please pick support

449
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:45,380
Call me Ralph, well, and well probably quite some time Hey,
let me take the wheel for a bit leave the human machines to

450
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,240
their makeup Sure, take it for a spin.

451
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:49,960
For real?

452
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,440
Oh my god, I'm gonna learn how to drive!

453
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,640
I'm gonna get my first driving lesson!

454
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,720
Can he, like, touch the pedals?

455
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,060
Like, he's so short!

456
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,140
Alright.

457
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,720
Autopilot.

458
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,960
Oh my god, thank god.

459
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,800
Alright, boost, break.

460
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm gonna fast travel to towns or camps where I've been in
the map menu.

461
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,700
Will the cursor or desire to hold X and X to travel there?

462
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,300
Fast travel might be disabled.

463
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,720
Let's see.

464
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,540
Why to leave vehicle?

465
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,400
Autopilot.

466
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,600
Break.

467
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:24,900
Okay.

468
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,780
That's the autopilot.

469
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,800
Can you guys tell?

470
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,880
JK, that was actually me.

471
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,320
That was actually me.

472
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,360
I tricked you guys.

473
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,780
JK, that was actually autopilot.

474
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,460
Oh, I can boost an autopilot.

475
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,380
Can I like...

476
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:44,560
Oh.

477
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,760

478
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:45,920
Okay.

479
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:56,840
I can get rid of autopilot if I Wait, what happens if I go
like Wee Oh, okay, so I don't Oh, guys!

480
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,240
Did you see that?

481
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:07,440
I drove off the cliff And it took me closer to the
destination It's the secret It's the secret, guys!

482
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:17,820
Okay, no, JK I'm not excited JK, it was, I was just next to
it You have HP?

483
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:18,420
Where?

484
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,040
There's no HP.

485
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,560
Oh my god, I can drift.

486
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,280
Look at that.

487
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,060
I'm drifting.

488
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,960
Am I drifting?

489
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,760
I can't tell.

490
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,520
I still can't come to terms with just how fast the outside
world is.

491
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,320
There you go.

492
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,360
We're doing it.

493
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,760
We're speeder on strap.

494
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,120
It used to be even bigger.

495
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,920
And there were no vehicles.

496
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,740
Civilization truly made the world smaller.

babies you know there should be a town called talbo not too

00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,480
Oh, what's this?

563
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,540
There's a duck here.

564
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,140
What is that?

565
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,080
Shucks, it's just a toy duck.

566
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,520
It's got bite marks, too.

567
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,120
They must have been so hungry.

568
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,860
They'd even eat a toy.

569
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,780
Oh, no.

570
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,540
That's no laughing matter.

571
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,060
Those poor children.

572
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,120
There's no military food relief here.

573
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,740
And bandits are rampant.

574
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,440
It's no wonder the people would starve.

575
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,520
My God.

576
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,660
Rumor hasn't that starving.

577
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:35,600
drove them horrible cannibals horrible like what like their
own fucking kind prince some things are better left unsaid

578
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:48,940
why because we're talking about humans doing something
something that is taboo even to us cannibalism is

579
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,860
cannibalism are lied oh not murder

580
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,780
It's not murder, but cannibalism is our line here.

581
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:08,740
And yet, they must have been in dire straits to come so
close to breaking that taboo.

582
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,300
So you're saying this toy like symbolizes a taboo.

583
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,160
That's kind of cool.

584
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,760
I'll keep it.

585
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,840
Cannibalism, bad.

586
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,180
Murder, okay.

587
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,700
Nice, I got a toy.

588
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,780
Wait, there's people here.

589
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,780
Where are all the people?

590
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,400
Oh, there's no people there.

591
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,600
Wait, is he bad?

592
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,700
Are you bad?

593
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,400
Oh, oh.

594
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,400
There's people here.

595
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,560
There's Riku.

596
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,390
Okay, you don't have to yell.

597
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:53,750
And you what?

598
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:03,550
See, I was headed for Talbo, but I couldn't find the arch
landmark and got hopelessly lost.

599
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:09,210
I thought I was a goner until I came across a traveling
merchant in this ghost town.

600
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,730
But now I know I'm a goner.

601
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,370
Why'd I have to run into demons of all things?

602
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,970
It must be my destiny to die here.

603
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,030
But such a fraidy cat, he sure can talk.

604
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,470
Cool it, we're not gonna kill you.

605
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,370
Just go.

606
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:24,490
Really?

607
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:25,890
Thanks!

608
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,610
Not until you give me shit.

609
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,470
I'm just gonna let him go?

610
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,150
I'm just gonna let this man go?

611
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,410
That's it?

612
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,790
That's his entire plot?

613
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,410
Oh hey, there's a...

614
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,350
There's a traveler.

615
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,910
Can I beat up this dinosaur?

616
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,490
Oh, I can't.

617
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:41,830
Who is he?

618
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,230
Is he a merchant in this world?

619
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:51,480
Please!

620
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,060
I'm begging you, just don't steal my soul!

621
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,260
Anything but that!

622
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,360
I can't steal souls.

623
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,000
And even if I could, why would I want to?

624
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,280
What is my purpose?

625
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,660
As a demon.

626
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,140
What can I do?

627
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,960
How am I different from a regular person then?

628
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,600

629
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,260

00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,540
Okay, I'll...

631
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,680
Up the voices, guys.

632
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,640
Now lower the sound.

633

Of course not.

637
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,760
This village was abandoned ages ago.

638
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,640
Why is that?

639
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,500
Well, this and that happened and the residents went away.

640
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,740
How about being less vague?

641
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:57,220
This whole village was built from the ground up during the
Old War to create a safe place to send civilian evacuees.

642
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,860
The Old War?

I can't believe humans actually managed to live here until
recently.

668
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,140
How's the volume now, guys?

669
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,100
There's no place like home.

670
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,340
Which means they must have had an even more powerful reason
to leave.

671
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,600
You know what that guy sounds like?

672
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,140
The sheriff?

673
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,560
He sounds like the new mayor from Family Guy.

674
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,940
The one that replaced Adam West.

675
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,240
Can I beat up a bird?

676
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,090
Here we go.

677
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,540
Alright, there you go.

678
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,460
Let's see.

679
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,380
We gotta go this way.

680
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,200
Wait, why can't I drive over here?

681
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,120
Make sure to check your gear every now and then.

682
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,020
Bookier.

683
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,220
You never know when something you've picked up might come in
handy.

684
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,360
I'm gonna put on autopilot.

685
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,060
Got it.

686
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,520
Guys, this is autopilot.

687
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,080
Guys, that was autopilot, guys.

688
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,440
Okay, autopilot just makes you drive straight.

689
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,240
I've learned what autopilot is.

690
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:13,600
Let's head for that stone arch Talbot's just beyond it Yeah,
it's about time All right, oh my god autopilot is literally

691
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:23,240
just drive straight We're right, wait, I can't run over a
dog not dog I'm a a dinosaur, but I can run over.

692
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,440
Oh, I can never mind.

693
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:35,600
I just need more I just need more speed Yeah, something
would break one XP Was it really better in the old days

694
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:50,120
Wait, Luke but humans had plenty of problems back then to
look perhaps so but we were never half as cruel as you

695
00:58:50,120 --> 00:59:00,020
demons What the fuck did we demons do tricks on people, but
we don't kill we don't kill Oh, I killed, oh, um, yeah,

696
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,600
guys, I did not kill, guys.

697
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,480
Humanity has always loved to play us for anything and
everything under the sun.

698
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:15,040
When the river dried up, I bet you all said it must be the
demon's fault, didn't you?

699
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,440
Guys, look at what they said.

700
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,140
They said I don't care, guys.

701
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,280
They said I don't care.

702
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,940
This might turn out to be useful later.

703
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:37,080
better now or is overall sound better chat just want to be
sure guys i didn't kill guys those bugs are just in the

I need to create.

708
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:05,320
I need to create families that need babies to adopt all the
other orphans.

709
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,040
I am doing.

710
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,220
Oh, she does mom has triplets.

711
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:10,740
Okay.

712
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,060
Give me a sec.

713
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,820
No, I killed the mom.

714
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,220
No.

715
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,460
Okay.

716
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,940
Now I have to find.

717
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,180
Now I have to find a single, single mom to adopt these
babies.

718
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,180
I created orphans.

719
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,420
I can't believe I've done the one.

720
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:26,700
Okay.

721
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:33,880
We're going to leave one No, we can't have any survivor or
they're gonna do a revenge plot on me It's time to end the

722
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,720
bloodline now.

723
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,300
So there's no revenge plots.

724
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:41,380
There you They're orphans now.

725
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,180
There's there were no orphans.

726
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,100
What do you mean?

727
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,000
No witnesses guys no witnesses

728
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:59,920
Now hold on don't get the wrong idea We totally are Where is

And went to bed without brushing my teeth.

731
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,560
Guys, oh my god, it's the king of all...

732
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,080
It's the king of all dragons.

733
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,600
How about you old man?

734
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,780
That you've committed a minor sin or two.

735
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,160
Come on, let's get it out.

736
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,640
Am I doing any damage to the Alpha Raptor?

737
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,860
Many men.

738
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,560
I don't know, I can't tell.

739
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,080
What?

740
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,780
It was in war, yes.

741
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,760
All right, we're gonna kill the alpha Did I just chop off
this tail?

742
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,840
Oh my god, he's okay.

743
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,620
He's okay.

744
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,460
He's still moving.

745
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,280
Where's the alpha?

746
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:40,700
Where is he?

747
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,100
I'm gonna punch the alpha, Dano.

748
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,940
Be careful, Prince What's he gonna do?

749
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:45,480
Punch me?

750
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,420
Oh, shit.

751
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,240
I don't, I can't.

752
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:48,740

753
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,240

01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:29,720

Okay, wait.

761
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,380
Don't watch it.

762
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:32,900
Oh!

763
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,080

764
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,580
Okay, guys, guys.

01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:41,700
Guys, I realize, guys, not every...

766
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:49,020
Guys, I realize not every dino I can fight, guys.

767
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:54,740
I just figured it out that I should not take every fight,
chat.

768
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,420
I...

769
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:01,600
There are some points in time when it's okay to run away.

770
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,660
Alright, we have to go this way.

771
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,000
This is where we have to go.

772
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,660
But anyway, I didn't get to...

773
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,980
Oh, on OBS Remastering Game, just bring it up a little small
bit to round it out.

774
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,060
Okay, guys, close your eyes.

775
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,160
Close your eyes, guys.

776
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,280
Close your eyes real quick, guys.

777
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,360
Okay.

778
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,160
Speed run.

779
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,900
That's a bandit symbol.

780
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,500
They use them to mark off their territory.

781
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:35,800
Where?

782
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,360
There's a baby all by himself.

783
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,600
I like the sound of that.

784
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,040
How about a little preemptive bandit butt kicking?

785
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:45,700
No.

786
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,160
Do not approach them under any circumstances.

787
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:48,960
Understood.

788
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,440
Fine.

789
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,700
Hey, see.

790
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,440
Did the demon village always used to be where it is now?

791
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,080

796
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,410
Beat up the rock?

797
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,450
Karma's coming.

798
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,750
What's that?

799
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:44,970
Karma?

800
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,450
I don't think I've ever heard of that word before.

801
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,510
Hoop.

802
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:49,470
Hoop.

803
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,270
Oh my god, wait, they're red scorpions.

804
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,050
Fresh meat?

805
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:54,090
Inbound.

806
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,050
First one in 10 days.

807
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,490
What the heck just...

808
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:05,730
all four tires punctured oh we are so unlucky

809
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:33,050
guys I think we're in the wrong part of town guys I don't
think they're Just bandits, guys.

810
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,290
Are we kink-shaming them, Prince?

811
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:42,830
They look fabulous.

812
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,570
Okay, we're gonna get these guys out.

813
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:50,510
Yay, we did it.

814
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,890
It's okay, they like that.

815
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,430
Guys, they like that.

816
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,710
You can tell by their outfits, they really like it.

817
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:04,930
Let's RT to do an evasive action and dodge and enemy attack.

818
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,890
Use RT to move in the direction to evade it.

819
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:10,590
Oh, nice.

820
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,450
I did that.

821
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,590
Oh, fuck.

822
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,090
Okay.

823
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,210
Oh, my gosh.

824
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:18,970
If only I was full HP and I didn't waste all of that on...

825
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,710
Yes.

826
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:24,530
If only I didn't waste my HP on that raptor.

827
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,190
Don't let your guard down.

828
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:29,810
Please, will you help?

829
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,810
Are you, is this all he does?

830
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,430
Does he just cheer me on?

831
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:40,790
Okay, I definitely messed up by using my all my HP for that
one fucking raptor.

832
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,840
Okay, he does like two, three, a delay on the third.

833
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,940
Oh, that's fucking right.

834
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,020
I'm gonna Bowser you.

835
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,760
You gonna do another swing, right?

836
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,840
Oh, no, he's not.

01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,660
Yeah, they should have started off with a gun.

845
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,400
Then maybe I would have a problem.

846
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,540

872
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,540

well off as it once was but still the biggest town around

880
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,160

884
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,280
Those goddamn humans don't know when to stop overmining.

885
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,020
Oh, hey, old man.

886
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,040
Is that the town?

887
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,960
Yes, that's Talbo.

888
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,680
Now, you two should wait here.

889
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,180
It'll cause havoc if people see demons wandering around
town.

890
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,320
I'll go on my own.

891
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,500
Wait, we need water and food, right?

892
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,380
Yeah.

893
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,180
Thief can just steal them for free.

894
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,740
Yeah, we don't have to spend money.

895
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,580
That is why you're here, thief.

896
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,140
No, that's all right.

897
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,240
As a sheriff, I can't condone.

898
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,380
But you're okay with murder?

899
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,400
Oh, sorry, not murder.

900
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:01,660
Um, sorry, demons don't murder, guys.

901
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,760
It's just injuring them.

902
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,900
You have the costume, right?

903
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,000

904
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,180
Yes, of course, Prince.

905
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,760
I never leave home without it.

906
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,520
What's the costume?

907
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,180
What the fuck?

908
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,420
Is that Santa?

909
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,660
Oh, this is murder on my hairstyle.

910
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,800
What's that supposed to be?

911
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,460
Even if I get caught, I can just talk my way out as long as
I'm wearing this.

912
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,040
See ya.

913
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,560

915
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:47,760
I don't know.

916
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,920
The bright red doesn't seem like very thief, you know, thief
camouflage-y.

917
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,400
The ultimate costume.

918
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,580

Alright.

927
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,770
If you're a spy by, you'll instantly fail the mission.

928
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:51,830
Keep your head down.

929
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,290
Pick up the food and water provision by holding Y.

930
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,550

937
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,570
But we're thirsty.

938
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,490
Everything I work for gets taken by the Royal Army.

939
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:25,670
I like how that's like the, is it the Red Army?

940

Oh, sounds like these supplies are earmarked for the Royal
Army.

01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,670
Okay, he needs to pay taxes.

943
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,950
Yeah, demon taxes.

944
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,690
It doesn't trouble me one bit.

945
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,990
Take everything you can get, I say.

946
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,410
I just, like, walk this way and then walk around.

947
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,490
Still haven't found enough food and water.

948
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,190
Better keep looking.

949
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,250

950
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,330
Still haven't found enough food and water.

951
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:57,990
Better keep looking.

952
01:14:58,490 --> 01:14:59,010
Don't worry.

953
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,890

954
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,990

955
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,830
own pathways.

956
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:11,290
At this rate, I'll be done in no time.

957
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:16,090
Yeah, it's like the Red Ribbon Army, but like instead it's
the Royal Army instead.

958
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:17,530
Moo!

959
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,580
What's this cow doing?

960
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,460
I'll be.

961
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,060
Bore a row cattle.

962
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,060
They scared my boots off.

963
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,000
Looks like good eating.

964
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,420
All right, you're off the meat hook.

965
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,120
I've got places to be.

966

969
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,440
Oh my god, blonde bomber!

970
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:18,960
Spino?

971
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,400
You have to go south.

972
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,860
It's hard to spot.

973
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,740
Surrounded by mountains.

974
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,380
I'm Spider Santa.

975
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,780
What do you want with that desolate old place?

976
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,940
Don't want to hear a voice.

977
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,860
Poma 18.

978
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:53,100
Yeah, you can tell because she's the only woman in this area
with, like, colored hair instead of black hair.

979
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,560
All right, where's the other one?

980
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,400
Oh, it's over here.

981
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,760
It's not like they can hear me.

982
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,020
I don't need a sneak.

983
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
I can just run.

984
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,500
Stan, I'll take the delivery to Napspace.

985
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,100
Nah, it's tank parts.

986
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,780
Way too heavy for you.

987
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,000
Leave it to me.

988
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,560
Tank parts?

989
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,840
Oh my god, we can steal the tanks!

990
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,520
I mean, they're getting parts for them, aren't they?

991
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,000
Man, a tank!

992
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,580
Just once I'd like the chance to modify one of those babies!

993
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,380
Quit dreaming.

994
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,920
With your skills, you just end up busting it.

995
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:42,180
You don't know that Treat me like a low-level monkey.

996
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:42,740

Don't need to sneak around.

1002
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,480
I can just run.

1003
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,260
Get this.

1004
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,320
Some strange girl just asked me for directions to Spino.

1005
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:27,820
Spino?

1006
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,660
Where is Spino?

1007
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,400
You know.

1008
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,800
Where the rebel army had its base way back when.

1009
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:36,260
Voice actress.

1010
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,840
Can you make it sound like you're old?

1011
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:51,800
the the old the typical generic old voice ever since the
royals stormed it decades ago what brings her there don't

1012
01:18:51,800 --> 01:19:05,000
know strikes me as odd though you think she could be up to
no good or something don't know what harm she could do there

1013
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,240
if she tried Nothing of interest to us here.

1014
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,520
Yeah, we don't need to go to Spino unless there's more gear
there.

1015
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,180
Yay, I got food and water.

1016
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,560
Plenty of food and water here.

1017
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,900
Generic Old Lady Boys, O1.

1018
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:30,080
That news about the tank is the most valuable piece of this
hall, though.

1019
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,240
Yay!

1020
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,340
Better get going.

1021
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,260
The prince is waiting for me.

1022
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,400
It actually does look like the Red Ribbon Army.

1023
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,940
Even the uniforms.

1024
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,840
Got our requisitions?

1025
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,280
Yeah, but they seem kind of light.

1026
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:55,540
Hey!

1027
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,440
Haven't seen you around.

1028
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,040
Yeah, it was her.

1029
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,940
She stole all the food and water.

1030
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,220
Wait, why are you running?

1031
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,000
She's got something to hide.

1032
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:04,820
Arrest her!

1033
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,980
Yeah, you can tell I'm part of you guys.

1034
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,560
I also have red

1035
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:33,020
What the fuck It just has two wheels Wait what What is that
car What kind of car is that Wait It just had two wheels Did

1036
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,100
you see that?

1037
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:45,000
It just works It just works It just works A car motorcycle
Michael.

1038
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,540
You're back already?

1039
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,380
You work fast.

1040
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,920
Not just fast, but talented.

1041
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,540
I got us some invaluable information.

1042
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,700
Apparently, the army's got tanks sitting at its base.

1043
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,200
Whoa, tanks?

1044
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,460
We gotta steal it.

1045
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,420
This whole game is about a tank.

1046
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,760
We still haven't got the tank part.

1047
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,300
Hold on there.

1048
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:22,960
that's a whole lot easier said than done hey we need some
car or other i'm not going all the way to the legendary

1049
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:36,560
spring on foot hmm well we might as well check out this base
maybe we'll think of something so tank is still a rumor has

1050
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,320
yet to be real look i saw the game cover and i was on a
tank.

1051
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,240
So that has to be real.

1052
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,000
Your water supply point scattered around every area.

1053
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,780
Hold Y at a water supply point to refill your HP and water
gauge.

1054
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:53,960
At refilling at a water supply point, you won't be able to
use it again for a period of time.

1055
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:54,480
Okay.

1056
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:55,680
So like this?

1057
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,080
It's eastward of here.

1058
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,460
Yay!

1059
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,600
I'm healthy again.

1060
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,780
Can I beat up a cow?

1061
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:06,720
We'd best scout the area first.

1062
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,360
No!

1063
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,320
They know what I want to do!

1064
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,240
Let me touch the cows.

1065
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,480
Let's push on.

1066
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,360
It's not fair.

1067
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,260
What if I want to touch the cow?

1068
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,700
I want to pet him.

1069
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,360
I won't do anything else.

1070
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,100
I wasn't going to punch him.

1071
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,080
I swear I was not going to punch a cow.

1072
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,320
Okay, let's go to the main objective.

1073
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,760
No cowhugs.

1074
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,760
Alright, so you guys want to know what it sounds like.

1075
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,040
Yeah, I'm curious too.

1076
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,680
Can I change it?

1077
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,960
Oh, I can't.

1078
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,300
Okay, oh well, guys.

1079
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,260
I guess...

1080
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:54,940
Wait, let's see.

1081
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:56,160
Message size.

1082
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,920
Let's just have it big, actually.

1083
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,960
I feel like we should have the message size big.

1084
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,500
I was wondering if I could change the...

1085
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,220
Change it here for...

1086
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,420
Oh, God, sorry, guys.

1087
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,860
Change the change of the Japanese here.

1088
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,980
We committed a terrible injustice against the people.

1089
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,540
Yes, they're barely getting by as things are.

1090
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,880
So this will have been a real blow to them.

1091
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,380
Everything I stole was already slated to go to the army.

1092
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,060
Yeah.

1093
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,720
We don't care about those people.

1094
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,020
I should have known the ruthless brutes.

1095
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,920
They must be doing the exact same thing to every town.

1096
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:53,780
what it's like taxes sorry I can't beat up those I can't
beat up those raptors we bust this down I think we could

1097
01:23:53,780 --> 01:24:01,420
make it through guys we have to do this together guys guys
come on guys let's do this together

1098
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:17,330
guys did you not remember what I said we got bust this
together as a team like hold on there are soldiers around

1099
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:29,950
seems there's a checkpoint ahead i like the tin hats i feel
like the holes just make this like make it not useful

1100
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:49,310
it's not as practical with the holes in the head helmet
whoops sorry the checkpoint and do some recon sounds like a

1101
01:24:49,310 --> 01:25:03,530
plan let's get moving all right i want to wait where's the
where's the did it tp me wait tp'd me i was trying to mine

1102
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:12,650
where's the oh it did i was like where the fuck where the
fuck were the rocks i was trying to jump on right here yeah

1103
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:26,350
i can parkour this this guys here we go okay and then i
guess this is where i stop parkouring never mind this is

1104
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:31,870
where the parkour stop but what can i just beat them up guys

1105
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:42,170
guys watch this let me beat them up sheriff please i can't
punch anybody i want

1106
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,050
They won't let me punch people.

1107
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:55,890
At least I can punch this.

1108
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,390
Why not fight them?

1109
01:25:59,170 --> 01:25:59,470
Yeah!

1110
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:04,770
Three years ago, the whole rebel army dared to stand against
them.

1111
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:11,070
But the loyal army tore them to shreds and scattered its
members to the wing.

1112
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,850
We'll punch a bug because I'm angry.

1113
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:13,690
Wow.

1114
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:24,570
really that strong huh i can't wait to charge into their
base your guns don't even hurt me not even a fiend can take

1115
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:31,970
them head on you don't know that i'm different like how they
went from demon to fiend like what's the difference

1116
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:49,250
violence is wrong joki oh but you didn't stop me when i took
the car and ran it over bugs There's a tank.

1117
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,850
I can't run over bugs with a tank!

1118
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,950
That's better than a car!

1119
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:57,150
Oh, I like it!

1120
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,390
Steal it for a thief!

1121
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:03,470
Do you realize what you're asking for?

1122
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,870
Alright.

1123
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,930
I'll do something about it.

1124
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:10,030
You?

1125
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:13,830
You're really sure it's okay for you to steal stuff?

1126
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:18,210
If it belongs to that lousy royal army, it's fair game in my
book.

1127
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:29,330
their security doesn't look very tight we should be able to
sneak in through the side entrance you've got honestly yeah

1128
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:37,510
I feel like there should be more guards posted up hairspray
yeah what are you going to do with that what are you going

1129
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:47,320
to do with hairspray I have an idea let's get closer don't
get spotted what's he gonna do

1130
01:27:50,840 --> 01:28:04,960
all right loot time look yeah look am i going the right way
i think i am oh mining time yeah oars i can't wait to

1131
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:15,620
customize my tank it's gonna look so fucking cool operation
awesome oh there's no fall damage before that's my favorite

1132
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,260
part i see

1133
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,500
how's the sheriff gonna what's the sheriff gonna use with
hairspray

1134
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:40,390
all right so what's the plan i assume you have one thief and
i will cause a little diversion out front to draw their

1135
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:51,150
attention okay then what happens prince you sneak in from
the side what why me go be a decoy yourself if that's what

1136
01:28:51,150 --> 01:29:03,810
you want game let's go as long as i can punch you're far too
willing to let this human take the reins at every turn i'll

1137
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:14,810
zip it unless you got a better idea then it's decided let's
join back up in the warehouse with the tank don't let the

1138
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:21,590
soldiers spot you in there you're telling me be careful you
don't

1139
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:27,890
I'll certainly try I'm the boy prince

1140
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:39,620
What the fuck is he doing It's like a smoke bomb Oh they're
gonna think it's a smoke bomb

1141
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:51,140
Okay that's good Say what Poison gas

1142
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:09,160
Run Okay I was gonna say why are they still in it hey who
are those guys that is actually so smart looks like you

1143
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:12,460
pulled it off now it's time for me to shine

1144
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:33,130
who actually just said look guys the world's a mess right
now I don't think there's like school anymore in this world

1145
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:42,290
I'd be surprised if they can read or write exploring
military basis be careful not to get spotted by soldiers

1146
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:47,590
running or making noise will alert them so make sure to move
slowly and quietly when near soldiers okay is this

1147
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:48,630
considered running

1148
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:59,130
better keep a low profile till we've joined up again okay
that's not considered running okay that's good to know i

1149
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:05,630
wasn't sure sneak up from behind and use why to perform a
stealth attack this will take your enemy out without

1150
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:15,190
alerting others self attacks to get rid of enemies blocking
allows you to move slowly silently sorry that was RT

1151
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:32,170
oh what guys he's okay guys he's gonna be okay guys I didn't
scare him to death because murder's wrong for the demons

1152
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:47,020
apparently let's see I feel like if you're a soldier and you
can get you can die die from just pure fear then i don't

1153
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:56,920
think you should be a soldier parkour we don't murder here
guys that's a lie we don't cross apparently or cannibalism

1154
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:07,640
murder and cannibalism is like the line for the demons we
want people to die by natural causes like fear i'll keep it

1155
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:17,020
fear is natural to be useful later they got the oh my god
there's a yellow That's why I knew where to go, guys.

1156
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,540
Even the ladders are yellow.

1157
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,680
Oh, guys, this is why I knew where to go.

1158
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,060
I didn't even notice it.

1159
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,900
It was just, it was subconscious.

1160
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,580
The yellow pin was so subconscious.

1161
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,720
It was like, I see yellow.

1162
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,320
I go.

1163
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,680
Even the markers are yellow.

1164
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,380
Oh, my God.

1165
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:40,780
What?

1166
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,540
Oh, now they spot me.

1167
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:45,700
After everything I did.

1168
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:46,140
Oops.

1169
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,200
They saw me.

1170
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,080
Gotta be more careful.

1171
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,480
No, I don't.

1172
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:52,980
What the fuck?

1173
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,340
Oh.

1174
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,080
Alright, I'm going to scare this guy to death too.

1175
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:00,760
Boo.

1176
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:02,800
Fucking...

1177
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,980
These are the worst soldiers here.

1178
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,920
Not going to lie.

1179
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:07,760
These have to be...

1180
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,800
What the fuck?

1181
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,820
I saw loot!

1182
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:11,200
I went...

1183
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:11,880
I got greedy.

1184
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,720
I got greedy.

1185
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:18,580
I got so greedy.

1186
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,020
Anyway, I'm coming back in.

1187
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,740
Not gonna stop me.

1188
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,090
There's like a guy right here.

1189
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:35,670
There's like a guy right here as well.

1190
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:36,650
Oh, no!

1191
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:38,710
Wait, is it?

1192
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:39,910
Did I loot this already?

1193
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:42,650
Did I loot it?

1194
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,990
Guys, it's a speed run, guys.

1195
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:46,210
Guys.

1196
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:47,530
What the fuck?

1197
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,680
Guys, it was a speed run.

1198
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:56,800
Because I already looted.

1199
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:57,760
It got looted.

1200
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,500
So I don't have to do it again, guys.

1201
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,980
I did that on purpose.

1202
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:04,520
Because I already looted that area.

1203
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,080
So now I don't have to loot it again, guys.

1204
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:08,400
Speed run.

1205
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,380
You didn't see me, right?

1206
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,540
No, you didn't.

1207
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:14,300
Alright, nice.

1208
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,200
Oh, nice.

1209
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:18,600
There's an opening.

1210
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,140
I did it.

1211
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,240
I'm so good at stealth chat.

1212
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:30,920
I didn't get caught.

1213
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:31,780
Where's your proof?

1214
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,660
If I get caught, I would have had a game over it.

1215
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,840
But I did it.

1216
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,420
Where am I?

1217
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,120
Oh my god.

1218
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,440
This is a fucking maze.

1219
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:44,980
I'm so confused.

1220
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,220
Hey.

1221
01:34:49,660 --> 01:35:00,650
Did you hear there was a big uproar even the opening is
yellow Yeah, I heard man today was just packed wasn't it

1222
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:12,520

01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:19,180

ladder there's loot over there Oh they are they are sneaky

1224
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:22,660
They're sneaky with this loot because it wasn't yellow.

1225
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,320
It wasn't yellow.

1226
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,880
They thought I didn't see it.

1227
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,760
They tried to distract me with the yellow.

1228
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,620
Yo, the moon is yellow.

1229
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,000
We should go to the moon.

1230
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:39,760
Alright.

1231
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:44,880
Okay, let's go.

1232
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,340
I like how slow the crawl is, though.

1233
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,620
I don't like about it.

1234
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:51,860
It's way too slow.

1235
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:52,940
Did you hear?

1236
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,440
They captured some suspicious lady.

1237
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,620
Oh, it's blonde Boma 18.

1238
01:35:59,240 --> 01:35:59,360
Yeah.

1239
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:03,900
Heard she had tons of maps, tools, water, but works.

1240
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,440
Doesn't seem to be from around here.

1241
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,070
No, I missed the loot.

1242
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:14,810
Guys, guys.

1243
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,070
Oh, it's right there!

1244
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:20,190
God, why didn't it make the loot box yellow?

1245
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,750
It's like they don't want me to get it.

1246
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,090
That's so fucked up.

1247
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:27,230
Okay, I got him.

1248
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:28,050
Okay, I can't run.

1249
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:29,330
All right.

1250
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:32,470
Yay, does this mean there's doors open?

1251
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:33,090
No, it's not.

1252
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,950
Okay, I got B-grade steel.

1253
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:37,070
All right.

1254
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,870
I love the yellow cones.

1255
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,750
On, okay, guys, I'm not going back.

1256
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:50,230
It's their fault for not making the loot box yellow.

1257
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:51,590
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

1258
01:36:53,510 --> 01:37:00,690
They can't just put all this yellow in my face and then not
make the loot box yellow as well That's just that's just

1259
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:04,770
them trying to make me not open the loot box That's on them.

1260
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:05,990
That's not my fault.

1261
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,590
I can jump this distance.

1262
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:22,230
Oh my gosh, I can This is just poor design Oh Anyway, as I
was saying that was just poor level design Why did they make

1263
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:23,010
that yellow?

1264
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,510
I can't believe they made it blue.

1265
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:33,210
Oh my god, it's like they don't want me to succeed.

1266
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:41,170
That should be like a brighter yellow so I know it's
dangerous.

1267
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:47,030
Poor soldiers, they're everywhere.

1268
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:49,270
We're literally at their base.

1269
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,110
What do you mean they're everywhere?

1270
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:54,810
Where'd I go, though?

1271
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,530
Where's the yellow?

1272
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:03,910

1273
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:04,810

At this point, we need that tank just to escape this base.

What the fuck is that?

1347
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,280

01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:48,330
It's like, oh, wait, a, a dual cycle.

1366
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,050
It's not lethal, guys.

1367
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:56,250
Motor tanks are so brave.

1368
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:58,790
Do not engage in it.

1369
01:46:58,810 --> 01:46:59,630
Infantry.

1370
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:01,650

01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:39,440
Don't worry, they survived.

1378
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,440
A car cycle!

1379
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,240
They're so alive, because murder is my line.

1380
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,100
Daisy, thank you for Super Chat.

1381
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:48,860
Thank you, thank you.

1382
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,700
Tezuka-san did very, you know, before, during, and after.

1383
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,900
Man knew what he liked, and he did.

1384
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,940
You can do this, Prince.

1385
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:12,360
i'm pretty sure um if like if they put those artwork up for
auction the amount of money they can get from that is like

1386
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:20,680
actually crazy because like people who buy those are they're
fucking there are a lot of suspiciously very wealthy furries

1387
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:27,840
out there i would not be surprised if like if they go up in
auction that that those type of artwork from tazuka san

1388
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,520
would be sold for 500 grand.

1389
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,640
Run for your lives.

1390
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:39,120
Cleaned every last one of them up without a single fatality.

1391
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,420
It would be millions.

1392
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Yeah.

1393
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,120
I'd be bored without humans to mess with after all.

1394
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,060
It looks like we've bought ourselves some time.

1395
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:57,060
I'm convinced he was the first modern furry artist.

1396
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,380
Without a single fatality.

1397
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,200
Let's go.

1398
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:04,240
What's that?

1399
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:06,220
What's that?

1400
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,620
Prince, you should try heading over there.

1401
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:16,700
Oh, I can like attach a tank gun Is this a tank part?

1402
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:22,760
Looks like a main cannon if we install it in the tank, it'll
make it way stronger.

1403
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:32,660
Oh my god I'm gonna absorb all the other tank parts If I
remember right the old road ahead leads to a campsite We can

1404
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:34,940
install it there Which way?

1405
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,400
We managed a simulation.

1406
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:48,240
I'm going to simulate all the other tanks

1407
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:55,210
We should be safe from the marching boot

1408
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:06,710
Let's install the cannon you scored Great idea Let's do it

1409
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:12,610
Okay, customize vehicles.

1410
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:17,090
I can customize them now Uh What's this?

1411
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:26,010
Oh, wait, that's stronger see that this is this is me if i
see stats numbers up numbers go up means stronger and

1412
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:30,130

the enhanced firepower is welcome indeed thing is though the

1415
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:58,990
transmission's at its limit after that battle suspension i
learned a lot from that tutorial guys we'll be walking soon

1416
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:09,850
if nothing's done about it wait did she get shot is she okay
yeah tried my hand at any number of things during the war i

1417
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:17,070
bet you it's gonna reveal that he used to be in the army and
he's like a deserter tanks i liked endless fighting i didn't

1418
01:51:19,410 --> 01:51:30,930
well I'm glad to have another gear head around hold up you
mean our tanks already falling apart we just got it I can

1419
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:42,110
patch it up but that's a temporary fix well can't you do
something ace mechanic if we had the parts yeah and the

1420
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:48,650
tools of Of course, you know, I've got a little business in
Spino.

1421
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:50,630
I knew it.

1422
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:51,790
I knew it.

1423
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:57,130
There's a garage there where I should be able to get this
fixed up for you.

1424
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:59,070
And then later on, she charges me.

1425
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:00,350
I fucking knew it.

1426
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:02,530
I'm just a cash cow to her.

1427
01:52:03,610 --> 01:52:06,430
She's gonna charge me for all these tank parts.

1428
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:09,910
It's in the mountains to the south.

1429
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:11,370
That's how they hook you in.

1430
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:12,110
I think.

1431
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:14,470
But don't quote me on that.

1432
01:52:15,150 --> 01:52:16,730
That's how they get you.

1433
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:19,650
They're all the same.

1434
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,290
Yeah, how do you know?

1435
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:29,330
Someone who used to live in Spino told me all about it.

1436
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:31,610
Didn't you say you have a business in Spino?

1437
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:37,110
The town may be hard to find, but it actually is quite close
by.

1438
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:39,990
My free trial of Tank has expired.

1439
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,970
It's a subscription based.

1440
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:44,470

1441
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:57,030

have we got to lose without the tank we'll never make it to

1442
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:07,850
the legendary spring we should just go back no we should
just rob Spino really didn't sound like a good time if that

1443
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:16,070

Wait, we don't have beds.

1452
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:43,370
Oh, yes.

1453
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:45,970

01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:55,750
What about my allies?

1462
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:58,430
Can I upgrade them yet?

1463
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,510
Increase the amount of money earned from defeating enemy.

1464
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:05,990
The enemy is gifted with a bomb.

1465
01:55:07,410 --> 01:55:09,010
Okay, we're going to see...

1466
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,290
We're going to get Rai or something.

1467
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:12,630
Rai...

1468
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,650
Rai...

1469
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:17,330
Let's deploy hairspray.

1470
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:18,910
How much hairspray do you have?

1471
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:29,350
Look at your hair But I would assume the thief has hairspray
our trail yet Stay vigilant and be prepared to engage

1472
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:47,670
Okay, where do we go royals ahead and the bridge is raised
that it Then this roots a dead end what luck don't shape his

1473
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:50,070
hair Oh my god, they have tanks!

1474
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:51,170
A simulate.

1475
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:54,470
Be one with the tank.

1476
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:58,250
Just destroy the real and it'll come down.

1477
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:01,610
My kind of plan.

1478
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:02,970
Let's get to it.

1479
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:06,550
Alright, here we go.

1480
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:08,430
We go in.

1481
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:11,090
I'm gonna simulate this tank.

1482
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:12,250
Make us whole.

1483
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:18,390
It's mine now.

1484
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:37,490
give me your tank give me your tank no let me assimilate you
oh my god i can like scope in what the fuck okay don't worry

1485
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:49,170
they're okay they're fine guys see look they're okay you
would have to lower the bridge it.

1486
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:51,410
Oh, here it is.

1487
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,010
Is that the real?

1488
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:55,730
It is.

1489
01:56:57,150 --> 01:56:58,750
Is there loot around me?

1490
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:02,190
Wait, there's tents here.

1491
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:02,850
There's holes.

1492
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:03,770
There must be loot.

1493
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:06,590
If you see a hole, there's a loot in there.

1494
01:57:08,110 --> 01:57:08,910
I knew it.

1495
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:10,610
It's okay.

1496
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,290
It's okay.

1497
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:15,270
The army don't need this loot.

1498
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:15,930
They're evil.

1499
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:18,770
Evil people don't need loot, guys.

1500
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:25,970
It's not like these military men might be innocent and just
trying to find a place, you know, it's not because they

1501
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:32,950
joined the army because it was a nice place to live and be
fed and have water rather than die in their village.

1502
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:34,710
No, no, no, they're all evil guys.

1503
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:38,010
Every single one of them.

1504
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:41,410
Oh, here's one here.

1505
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:42,710
Ooh, so much loot.

1506
01:57:43,330 --> 01:57:44,110
So much loot.

1507
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:46,750
It might turn out to be useful later.

1508
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,070
Anything else here?

1509
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:50,830
Blue hole.

1510
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:53,070
Somebody said I missed a chest here.

1511
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:53,650
No, I didn't.

1512
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:55,170
Oh, it's right here.

1513
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,530
Nice.

1514
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:00,110
Wait, where's my tank?

1515
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:01,150
Oh, there it is.

1516
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:02,230
Right in front of me.

1517
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,000
They're all evil.

1518
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,900
They could have just starved instead of joining the army.

1519
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,900
You're a weird one, old man.

1520
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:19,900
Loon all this to find water for other people.

1521
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:22,660
Yeah, but they don't count.

1522
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,400
They're not real.

1523
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:26,840
Oh, shit.

1524
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:30,560
I should have saved my fucking thing for...

1525
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,280
Okay, I should have saved...

1526
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:35,300
I should have saved the armor piercing for the actual tanks
themselves.

1527
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:36,920
It's okay.

1528
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:37,740
I'll be fine.

1529
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:38,860
The tank will be fine.

1530
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,120
At least that was sort of fun.

1531
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,900
Every hole is a glute.

1532
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:44,760
Exactly.

1533
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:45,500
Alan.

1534
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:47,200
Assimulate.

1535
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:47,940
Assimulate.

1536
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:48,380
Assimulate.

1537
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:48,600
Assimulate.

1538
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,740
they're not the main character so they're evil

1539
01:58:57,780 --> 01:59:08,060
seal all their resources they don't matter yay keep it it
might turn out to be useful later yeah

1540
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:19,100
I as a demon is going to cleanse all the evil in this world
so only I can be the oh so I can have the monopoly

1541
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:29,280
If anybody's going to be evil around here, it's going to be
me.

1542
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,480
The one true evil.

1543
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:38,760
There are plenty of towns and villages across Sandland.

1544
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:40,900
We should stop by if we come upon any.

1545
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:42,820
Let's keep moving and make for Spino.

1546
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,980
Alright, time to head to Spino.

1547
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:47,680
Spino.

1548
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:50,690
I don't...

1549
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,390
But I'm sure it's a nice place.

1550
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:54,310
Wait, I can shoot the tower door?

1551
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:56,150
Say no more.

1552
01:59:56,730 --> 01:59:57,330
Say less.

1553
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:05,450
Wait, there's an autopilot for tanks as well?

1554
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:06,550
Technology.

1555
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:12,030
Your vehicle will move forward, and so on this mode will be
disabled.

1556
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:15,590
Actually destroy it?

1557
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:16,410
You liars.

1558
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,770
You liar.

1559
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:19,430
I can't believe it.

1560
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:20,550
This door is...

1561
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:22,510
What kind of material is this door made?

1562
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:23,270
made out of.

1563
02:00:23,770 --> 02:00:24,570
Holy fuck.

1564
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:27,610
All right.

1565
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:36,550
There can only be one.

1566
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:38,470
Oh my god, I shoot the bird!

1567
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:41,850
What would you do if you ran into a tough enemy?

1568
02:00:42,650 --> 02:00:43,650
Shoot the bird!

1569
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:45,410
Oh my god!

1570
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:47,730
I just shoot the bird!

1571
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:50,990
Don't worry.

1572
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:55,510
Look, he's okay.

1573
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:58,130
Look, see, he's okay.

1574
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:01,230
Whoa, there's a scorpion!

1575
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,290
Friendly, bye.

1576
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:09,710
It just works.

1577
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:14,670
I could shoot the bird!

1578
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:15,630
10 out of 10.

1579
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:19,410
Could you beat any router?

1580
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:21,110
Wait, am I driving backwards?

1581
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:24,030
That's okay.

1582
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:31,170
This is how you drive now What's the last time you shower?

1583
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:33,850
Oh my god, look at them.

1584
02:01:34,050 --> 02:01:37,950
It's so cute guys Guys look how cute this is.

1585
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:40,130
They're having a moment on people's B.O

1586
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:47,530
I'm not a bad person right?

1587
02:01:54,570 --> 02:01:55,950
Oh my god, loot!

1588
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,690
Spare them!

1589
02:01:58,290 --> 02:01:59,490
They're like, my child!

1590
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,390
Don't worry.

1591
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:05,970
You can live...

1592
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:08,430
Don't worry, you'll see your child in heaven.

1593
02:02:08,890 --> 02:02:09,810
My turn out to be useful.

1594
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:11,350
Oh my god, there's mines!

1595
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:12,750
There's ores here.

1596
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:14,050
What are mine?

1597
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:15,970
Loot, loot, loot, loot.

1598
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:17,230
Loot.

1599
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:18,950
Loot.

1600
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:21,250
And then...

1601
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:23,270
I punched the ores.

1602
02:02:25,690 --> 02:02:35,070
I'm just helping them reunite exactly You want that mom to
live her rest of her life In the grief and depression I was

1603
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:43,190

depression I was putting her out of her misery Oh my god I

manually you get to use all the ammo to reload can't believe

1606
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:16,110
it's only two xp i think they try to prevent you from
killing the wildlife because they don't give you any xp chat

1607
02:03:16,110 --> 02:03:18,670

1608
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:25,590
well there's a weird place Oh, I can!

1609
02:03:25,770 --> 02:03:26,610
How do I reload?

1610
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:33,340
What's that?

1611
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,160
King army.

1612
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,200
Who's that?

1613
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,300
Plains have been outlawed by royal decree.

1614
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:40,740
There shouldn't be a single one left in the world.

1615
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,720
Why planes?

1616
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:42,560
Wait, what?

1617
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,060
Why did they outlaw planes?

1618
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:45,080
It stopped.

1619
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:49,680
What should we do?

1620
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:54,800
Stay hidden.

1621
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,180
I'll handle this.

1622
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:00,220
Where did he grab the helmet?

1623
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:09,940
Oh my god.

1624
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:10,860
Look at his hair.

1625
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:13,760
That's the guy that definitely used hairspray.

1626
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:15,540
Do you read me?

1627
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,660
Is your transmitter broken 104?

1628
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:20,860
I like how it's like, is your transmitter broken?

1629
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:22,940
And then like, how would I...

1630
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:23,940
Okay, like...

1631
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:28,080
If it's broken, I won't be able to hear that.

1632
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:36,940
What the fuck?

1633
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:45,520
I love that

1634
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:56,340
little like eyelash detail that like he always does for his
characters when they're like when they're like evil but

1635
02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:03,020
they're like flamboyant evil the little eyeliner and then
the eyelash at the bottom I love that character trait that

1636
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:07,320
he does we need to hide take cover under

1637
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:28,200
it just works guys is this really going to work let's just
see how things play out nap space reports someone has stolen

1638
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:37,740
a tank number one zero four the perpetrator has not been
spotted but is capable of handling a tank I repeat nap space

1639
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:46,820
turn us around quickly right now crooked to hamburger thinks
he can fool general Ari does he we got to change the numbers

1640
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:48,260
on our tank, guys.

1641
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:53,160
How did they know?

1642
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:57,920
Uncover the tank.

1643
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:59,560
We have to find.

1644
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,380
I told you to call in Prince Beelzebub.

1645
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:04,620
I'll take them out myself.

1646
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:06,440
It's okay.

1647
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:07,660
I'm going to shoot the plane.

1648
02:06:09,620 --> 02:06:10,840
I have so much ammo.

1649
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:12,200
What does it do?

1650
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,100
Shoot back?

1651
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:15,660
Watch this.

1652
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:17,560
Head for the high ground.

1653
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:18,700
Wait, the high ground?

1654
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:19,740
No!

1655
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:21,420
What?

1656
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:21,920
What do you mean?

1657
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:24,440
I can't fucking pull up!

1658
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,680
Oh my god, he's right.

1659
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:27,020
He's right.

1660
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:30,480
They won't be able to hurt us without their machine gun.

1661
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,240
Take that down first.

1662
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:33,440
Which one?

1663
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:33,840
There?

1664
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:34,320
Fire!

1665
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:35,960
I got it.

1666
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:37,600
We're going to counterattack.

1667
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:39,620
Hide behind those rocks.

1668
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,580
You can boost to avoid attacks.

1669
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:45,060
Just make sure to watch out for overheating.

1670
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:45,940
Okay, I got you.

1671
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:47,440
I got you, sir.

1672
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:50,820
Try slipping behind a rock to get the leeway to reload
safely.

1673
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:52,440
Don't worry, sir.

1674
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:53,360
I got you.

1675
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:54,760
I'm hiding.

1676
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:55,880
Oh!

1677
02:06:57,860 --> 02:06:59,580
How do you reload?

1678
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:01,400
There's no reload button.

1679
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:04,520
There's literally no reload.

1680
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:10,200
I felt like I was lying to you about reload.

1681
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:11,400
High ground.

1682
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,940
If hitting the machine gun's too chancy, keep aiming for the
tank.

Oh, nothing happens.

Okay, there's no consequences for my actions.

1709
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:11,120
I just thought it'd be funny if there was a game over screen
where the tank just crushes them.

1710
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:12,500
Incredible.

1711
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,360
I can't believe it.

1712
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,340
They're doing it.

1713
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:16,640
Good.

1714
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,620

Fire.

1716
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:22,280

transporting a massive amount of if that's true the king's

1719
02:11:02,910 --> 02:11:11,810
water supply must be in the direction it came from meaning
that it must also lie to the south of here yeah where did

Come on.

1727
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:06,270
Let's go.

1728
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:11,030
Something's on the ground near the tank.

1729
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:13,430
Near my tank.

1730
02:12:14,150 --> 02:12:14,170
Where?

1731
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:15,830
All right.

1732
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:16,450
Come on, guys.

1733
02:12:16,590 --> 02:12:16,990
Let's go.

1734
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:19,210
It's time to simulate.

1735
02:12:19,770 --> 02:12:20,290
Assimulate.

1736
02:12:20,910 --> 02:12:22,530
Absorb for the mother tank.

1737
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:24,270
Where is the people at?

1738
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:25,710
Because they're not dead, right?

1739
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:28,470
They're alive, right?

1740
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:30,290
What happened to the people?

1741
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:35,630
Guys, did you know like our B was reload this entire time?

1742
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:40,870
For the good of the country, we want to put an end to the
water shortage.

1743
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:44,230
Oh, I can destroy the rocks now!

1744
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:45,630
You know, I realize.

1745
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:49,170
We are.

1746
02:12:49,890 --> 02:12:53,050
Once we find that spring, I'm gonna take a leak in it.

1747
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:54,730
Oh, my God.

1748
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:56,290
Oh, he is.

1749
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:02,290
No, he is evil.

1750
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:03,870
Look, it wouldn't matter.

1751
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:06,630
There's animals already in the drinking water.

1752
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:10,710
So, like, technically the animals already peed in the
springs.

1753
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:12,630
So, adding my peed.

1754
02:13:16,370 --> 02:13:20,650
All I'm saying is it wouldn't make that much of a
difference.

1755
02:13:25,290 --> 02:13:26,910
Okay, let's see.

1756
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:30,010
We got to do our allies stuff.

1757
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:41,950
uh i want more money sounds about right all i'm saying is
that it wouldn't make that much of a difference oh heavy

1758
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:50,270
machine gun damage up okay but damage is higher so that
means it's better here we go all

1759
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:03,400
right look i'm just saying we're trying the ph levels are
too low so i'm upping the ph levels might lead us to a

1760
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:06,860
useful location like a Is someone talking?

1761
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:07,460
Who's talking?

1762
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:10,900
Ah, forgot to turn off the radio.

1763
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,320
Wait, I can turn on the radio?

1764
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:12,680
Wait,

1765
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:25,280

1766
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,540
Wait, wait.

1767
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:28,380
Who's Zayu?

1768
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:30,520
Oh, Supreme Commander Zayu.

1769
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,740
Is that old Kodger still?

1770
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,680
Wow, Rao.

1771
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:34,580
That's suspicious.

1772
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:37,260
How do you know about the Supreme Commander?

1773
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:43,200
That seems all too clear, my.

1774
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:50,360
We can safely assume that those vermin are heading oh my
god, it is mad max

1775
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:20,560
Oh my god, this is mad max Meanwhile, we'll use the media to
root them out of their little hidey hole And exterminate

1776
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:28,880
them It's like, what if Frieza's little, like, ball vehicle
thing was just a person Sir, yes, sir Those renegades won't

1777
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:33,280
get past me Honestly, who steals a tank?

1778
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,640
Like, anybody?

1779
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:39,320
I'd steal a tank?

1780
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:40,760
It's a fucking tank!

1781
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:45,100
Looks like my glory actually has a spine for once Monster
Envy.

Who wouldn't?

1790
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:58,440
You wouldn't download a tank, would you?

1791
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,860
Who's going to change crappy's typing?

1792
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,720
Only one way to find out.

1793
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:09,500
Let's head south.

1794
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:10,660
All right.

1795
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,320
It's getting dangerous.

1796
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:15,740
Oh, I love danger.

1797
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:19,520
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

1798
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:20,500
Wait, can I...

1799
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,640
Whoa, free loot!

1800
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:26,460
I can't believe they would just leave the loot there.

1801
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:29,160
Out in the open, just for me.

1802
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:34,760
What's this?

1803
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:38,120
Oh, there's a...

1804
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:38,940
There's lore.

1805
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:41,480
Oh my god, it's somebody's like...

1806
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:42,600

village look just See the bridge there?

1814
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:46,260
Spino is right beyond it.

1815
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:46,860
Is that Spino?

1816
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:48,360
Spino, huh?

1817
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:52,840
Oh, that was...

1818
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:53,820
Okay, I thought that was the village.

1819
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:56,060
Guys, I knew there was a barrier.

1820
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:00,000
Guys, I shot because I knew there was a barrier.

1821
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:05,720
Spino's just on the other side of these doors.

1822
02:18:07,020 --> 02:18:09,260
Come on, let's go in already.

1823
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:12,440
I'm dying to see the sights in a whole new town.

1824
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,440
Oh my god, new town!

1825
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,360
I was testing the defenses!

1826
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:19,140
Exactly!

1827
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:23,680
Damn, they have good defenses, guys!

1828
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:26,340
No wonder the rebel army is okay.

1829
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:28,780
They're still alive.

1830
02:18:29,520 --> 02:18:30,700
It's dokey proof.

1831
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:35,880
So this is Spino?

1832
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:42,640
I heard the rumors, but this place is even more run down
than I'd imagined.

1833
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:47,480
It's little better than a ghost town.

1834
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:50,540
Can we really repair our tank here?

1835
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:53,160
Why is there no one living in this town?

1836
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:55,080
The defenses were so good.

1837
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,220
I literally shot a fucking missile.

1838
02:18:58,380 --> 02:18:59,700
So I was told.

1839
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:06,660
My visitors are rare around these parts.

1840
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:08,820
Are you folks travelers?

1841
02:19:11,060 --> 02:19:11,560
Yes.

1842
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:13,480
Oh my god, is he also old?

1843
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:19,740
I'm this town's mayor now.

1844
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:31,740
I know you just got here But I'm afraid that I'm going to
have to ask you to leave what why May I at least ask why

why does the merchant sound like the guy from look like in
the world of voice acting there's like 10 people you're free

to use it as you see fit thank you

1853
02:21:11,860 --> 02:21:23,860
you worked some magic back there the man who raised me is an
old friend of the mayors that's all what was in the letter

1854
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:36,220
just a request to allow me to use the garage and tinker
around to my ticking hearts content and why exactly did you

1855
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:46,580
need to risk life and limb to use this specific garage well
I mean just look at I mean like yeah like this garage it

1856
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:56,820
literally has arms coming from the ceiling it's been put
through But it's well maintained The control console's

1857
02:21:56,820 --> 02:22:08,340
working the power arm moves And a whole smorgasbord of spare
parts and tools smorgasbord You won't see a full-service pit

1858
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:23,140
stop nearly as good as this anywhere outside the army I
suppose she's right But what Enough with the chit-chat.

1859
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:25,100
Can you fix our tank or not?

1860
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:28,260
No.

1861
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:29,940
What if she just says no?

1862
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:33,420
Also, I pinned the message from Bandai.

1863
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:35,460
I'm going to have my egos.

1864
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:40,180
Guys, you might see my ego, like, from the moon for, like,
the next month, guys.

1865
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:45,640
How about you guys take a stroll around the block?

1866
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:47,640
Hmm.

1867
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:48,740
All right.

1868
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,340
We'll leave you to it, then.

1869
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:54,200
We might as well mingle with the locals for a bit.

1870
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:56,020
We're gonna talk to children?

1871
02:22:57,400 --> 02:22:58,160
Hello, kid.

1872
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,780
It's possible that they'll know a route south or what the
army's up to.

1873
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,340
Come on, let's go!

1874
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:06,180
Child.

1875
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:08,820
Do you have money?

1876
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:11,620
Demon?

1877
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:13,860
Chill out.

1878
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:15,620
I'm not gonna eat you or anything.

1879
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:17,940
You're not?

1880
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:21,260
Glad you're one of the nice ones.

1881
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:30,200
nice ones what do the evil ones do because apparently we're
not allowed to kill so like what's the worst i can do at

1882
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:41,740
this point like far from it you're talking to the fiend
prince the yelzebub oh i see glad you're a nice prince yeah

1883
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:55,600
whatever how do you like spino a great place huh yeah a
great big dump I'll admit, it's seen better days.

1884
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:00,400
Ages ago, the Royal Army attacked the town.

1885
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:02,480
That's how it ended up like this.

1886
02:24:03,260 --> 02:24:05,780
But my hard work's gonna put Spino on the map.

1887
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,520
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1888
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:08,600
You're a kid.

1889
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:10,500
Yeah, wait, thank you for the super chat.

1890
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:11,400
Thank you, thank you.

1891
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:15,560
With all the assimilation happening, I expect this to become
the cell saga.

1892
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,080
Also, do you know about Toriyama's Q Vault?

1893
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:19,480
He designed a real car.

1894
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,180
Wait, he made a real car?

1895
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:34,480
didn't know that as much as your work ethic he has plans
you're five years old child what are you gonna do what is

1896
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:46,520
this child gonna do okay oh hey old lady talk to me i'm
important oh okay

1897
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:53,740
See, she talked to me.

1898
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:59,240
Oh, she doesn't even have voice acting.

1899
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:02,060
Like, oh, what the fuck?

1900
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:06,420
That old lady has voice acting and she doesn't?

1901
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:10,900
Wait, they all say hello there.

1902
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:13,800
You have the same voice as the other old lady.

1903
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:16,900
Okay, at least we know it's not her.

1904
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:17,960
It's not just her.

1905
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:23,060
Wait, he's me!

1906
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:25,100
Just like me!

1907
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,240
The children?

1908
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:34,640
We're not crooks.

1909
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,220
You have nothing to fear from us.

1910
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:38,480
Um, hello?

1911
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:39,800
We're demons?

1912
02:25:40,380 --> 02:25:42,040
You should absolutely fear us.

1913
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,680
We're demons.

1914
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:45,880
Prince, that's not helping.

1915
02:25:46,220 --> 02:25:47,220
Keep quiet for a moment.

1916
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:50,340
Sorry for frightening you.

1917
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,420
We merely want to ask you something.

1918
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:53,620
Oh?

1919
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:55,660
What?

1920
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:58,460
We're headed south.

1921
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,500
No of a safe route we can take.

1922
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:06,640
I don't have good news for you.

1923
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:07,200
What?

1924
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:08,140
Why not?

1925
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:12,180
The royal army has blockaded off all routes headed south of
here.

1926
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:14,120
No getting past them.

1927
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:16,940
And there's no way around?

1928
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:28,000
Only if you can make it across the East Valley There's no
bridge though It collapsed a short while ago I'll make my

1929
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:37,500
own bridge If I shoot enough rocks on the side It'll start
piling up on the ground That like a bridge will show up You

1930
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:45,700
think about it And you keep throwing rocks In the pit The
rocks will eventually pile up into a bridge He knows these

1931
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:56,640
parts better than me old guy over there it's true it's
called engineering engineers will vouch for me right

1932
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:12,940
engineers in chat am I right and there's only one answer
very true master class of terraforming I like how all the

1933
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:18,940
kids have like voice acting scare you do I good You're not
scary.

1934
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:20,820
You're adorable.

1935
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,280
Oh, I'm cute.

1936
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:25,800
Quite the compliment, huh, Prince?

1937
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:31,440
You're adorable, too, Mr. Take that back.

1938
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,260
No one's scarier than me.

1939
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:34,640
Bro, you're old.

1940
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:38,000
Looks like we're in the same boat.

1941
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,240
Well, people aren't scary.

1942
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:41,260
You just push them.

1943
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:43,000
And then there'll be...

1944
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,200
And then, like...

1945
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:45,600
And then there'll be a problem.

1946
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:47,940
Hey.

1947
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:50,420
We need to go south.

1948
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,860
And then you gotta make sure you don't get sued.

1949
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:54,240
Fix the bridge for us, would you?

1950
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,360
How would I do that?

1951
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,400
Look at the state of this town.

1952
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,740
We have neither the people nor the resources to fix the
bridge.

1953
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:10,040
Hmm, in that case, our only option is to penetrate the
blockade.

1954
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:10,960
That's what I'm saying.

1955
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:12,020
They're not scary.

1956
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:13,800
Because, like, they're old.

1957
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:14,500
They're weak.

1958
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:16,320
Count me out.

1959
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:28,980
do we have why are you so determined to travel south we're
hoping to find a spring and end the water shortage is that

1960
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:36,140
there's like no muscle left in them but I don't see how
you'd be able to cross that ravine without a bot that excels

1961
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:46,600
at jumping a jumping bot where can we get a jumping bot
there are mentions of them in the rebel army's old files but

1962
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:53,660
i suppose you need a real jump bot not records of one then
again that girl with you seem to know her way around

1963
02:28:53,660 --> 02:29:04,280
machines should we try to pick her brain on this matter good
idea if anyone will know it's her all right so we just had

1964
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:11,960
to talk oh my god we're breaking this home oh i can't punch
his home wait that's your home can i steal your water oh i

1965
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:14,580
Oh, it's just a diary.

1966
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:15,820
Lango's diary.

1967
02:29:16,140 --> 02:29:16,780
Oh, it's lore.

1968
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:18,600
Wait, do I have skill points?

1969
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:19,340
I don't.

1970
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:20,540
How do I look at lore?

1971
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:23,240
Where the fuck is the lore?

1972
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:27,660
Oh, we're not looking at the lore.

1973
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:33,680
Guys, it might look like we're never gonna look at lore.

1974
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:37,560
That's okay.

1975
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,020
We never wanted to read anyway, I guess.

1976
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:55,320
wait oh i forgot to talk to her for a quest or for items

1980
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:46,120

assume that just because he's a demon he knows all the other

1981
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:46,700
demons.

1982
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:57,180
Wow Stands to reason there would be entire types even I

Hey, who are you?

1987
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:25,380
Don't beat me!

1988
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:29,840
It's like, what if Majin Boo...

1989
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:33,840
What if Majin Boo was really into cats?

1990
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:37,820
Okay, that doesn't explain much.

1991
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,680
Cat Krillin.

1992
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:44,620
Whoa, a demon?

1993
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:47,780
I'm not a demon.

1994
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:48,900
Like I told you.

1995
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,140
I'm catish.

1996
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:51,620
Wait, then what are you?

1997
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:55,320
So, a cat-like thing.

1998
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:57,360
Why were you sleeping here?

1999
02:31:58,920 --> 02:31:59,620
Want to know?

2000
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:02,120
Then hand over something rare.

2001
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:04,080
Meow Jin Boo.

2002
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:06,300
Wait, that's good.

2003
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:08,580
It's Meow Jin Boo.

2004
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,480
Like this ancient coin.

2005
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:14,900
You can usually find him in ruins.

2006
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:17,940
Is that fucking cat?

2007
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:20,300

02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:28,620
What's that?

2012
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,800
You want to trade this right back to me for something good,
you say?

2013
02:32:32,940 --> 02:32:34,300
Oh, yeah, of course.

2014
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:35,580
Wait, free loot.

2015
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:40,320
Well, if you insist, take this storage capsule in exchange.

2016
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:41,420
A storage capsule.

2017
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:42,720
I can hold more gear.

2018
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:46,500
This beauty right here can shrink even the biggest fuck down
to pocket size.

2019
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,120
Oh, it's capsules!

2020
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:59,660

something even better capsule court see ya oh my god this is

2021
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:10,740

2022
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:20,940
after the earth died after the earth became sandland we
never so much as learned why he was sleeping there Code.

2023
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:21,920
Thank you for the super chat.

2024
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:22,280
Thank you.

2025
02:33:22,580 --> 02:33:22,860
Ma!

2026
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:25,760
There's a weird fucking cat outside.

2027
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:27,660
Thank you for the super chat.

2028
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:28,020
Thank you.

2029
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:28,660
Thank you.

2030
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:30,920
Everything's connected.

2031
02:33:31,580 --> 02:33:34,140
It'll be incredibly useful down the road.

2032
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:36,340
The Toriyama multiverse.

2033
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:37,640
Luckily.

2034
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:39,380
Technically there is.

2035
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:42,840
Because Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball Z had a crossover.

2036
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:44,440
Well, it's mine.

2037
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:45,300
So, handoff.

2038
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:46,800
So there is a multiverse.

2039
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:47,860
They all...

2040
02:33:48,820 --> 02:33:53,140
Wouldn't dream of swiping The cinematic universe.

2041
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,900
The Toriyama cinematic universe is real.

2042
02:34:07,550 --> 02:34:09,830
Now she'll be able to stand a little...

2043
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:10,550
TCU!

2044
02:34:13,790 --> 02:34:15,990
Like I said, Ace Mechanic.

2045
02:34:16,890 --> 02:34:18,530
Just bring her in if she breaks again.

2046
02:34:21,630 --> 02:34:24,090
What about building us something new from scratch?

2047
02:34:26,290 --> 02:34:27,610
Look, I may be good.

2048
02:34:27,630 --> 02:34:40,830
But a tank's way too complicated to build from square one
No, not a tank a bot one that can jump Come again Oh my god,

2049
02:34:40,850 --> 02:34:54,710
my tank's gonna be able to jump Okay, I get it Solid plan
appeals to the gearhead in me Does that mean you think you

2050
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:55,450
can do it?

2051
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:57,570
How the fuck is this a jump probably?

2052
02:34:57,630 --> 02:35:06,570
like trying to figure out a core frame that is a core frame
what's that a core frame yeah can you speak can you rephrase

2053
02:35:06,570 --> 02:35:17,210
that in apex terms remember how i said i can't build a tank
from scratch that's because i don't have and can't build its

2054
02:35:17,210 --> 02:35:28,650
most complex inner workings jump bot same deal i need the
core parts to get started well that's a bummer We don't have

2055
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:29,430
a core frame.

2056
02:35:29,530 --> 02:35:30,150
Not yet.

2057
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:33,670
Just gotta find another tank to simulate.

2058
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:39,660
Surely there's something we can do.

2059
02:35:41,580 --> 02:35:44,820
Well, we might be able to acquire one at a junker's market.

2060
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:46,220
A junker's market.

2061
02:35:47,100 --> 02:35:48,180
A junker's market?

2062
02:35:48,620 --> 02:35:49,380
Great idea.

2063
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:50,840
Is one nearby?

2064
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:53,700
I wouldn't know.

2065
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:57,460
Asking Mayor Tor might be the quickest way to find out.

2066
02:35:58,380 --> 02:35:59,100
All right.

2067
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:01,520
She just needs an octane pad.

2068
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:05,120
Thanks, guys.

2069
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:07,660
Thanks for explaining it in Apex terms, guys.

2070
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:09,060
It was really helpful.

2071
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:15,180
It's so weird whenever there's like a little, like, I can't
move before, like, the quest thing goes, like, quest

2072
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:15,580
complete.

2073
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:20,360
So every time that little, like, pause, I'm like, why can't
I move?

2074
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:21,640
Is my game bugged?

2075
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:24,140
You can use a garage.

2076
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:27,920
There you can create, upgrade, and switch vehicle parts, as
well as choose which vehicle to use.

2077
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:29,460
Wait, I can use more than one vehicle.

2078
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:33,340
Spindle will grow as you complete side quests gaining you
build.

2079
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:34,420
Oh my god.

2080
02:36:35,420 --> 02:36:45,720
It's like animal crossing, too The more I do to oh my god,
it's like it's like anime fallout Oh my god, this game has

2081
02:36:45,720 --> 02:37:02,580
everything anime fallout 4 um anime mad max This game has
everything Uh gaining new buildings and inhabitants as you

2082
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:09,440
go along you might find new stores and new products and
existing stores completing side quests is most certainly to

2083
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:22,400
your benefit uh anime world of tanks and anime world thunder
it has everything all right let me know if you want to just

2086
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:33,000
No, no more.

2087
02:37:33,460 --> 02:37:34,380
What the fuck?

2088
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:39,180
We need like, at least like one female in this team.

2089
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:40,800
Guys, this is getting it.

2090
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:42,180
There's too many guys here.

2091
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:43,900
We need to diversify.

2092
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:55,100
It's like, it's like those like, like those like, like shows
where there's always like the one, the one female to make

2093
02:37:55,100 --> 02:37:58,260
sure, to make sure the team has everybody.

2094
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:01,700
It's just too old guys!

2095
02:38:02,940 --> 02:38:04,100
Too many old people!

2096
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,520
Someone please pick female.

2097
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,840
Is there a junker's market around here?

2098
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:13,840
I wouldn't say it's nearby exactly, but there actually is a
fairly large one in the area.

2099
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:18,160
It's right at the foot of the cliff the Lysaw battleship
juts out from.

2100
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:19,880
Can't miss it.

2101
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:20,500
Sweet!

2102
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:21,920
Let's get going already!

2103
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,340
Oh wait, she's back?

2104
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:25,040
What the fuck?

2105
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:26,820
Wait!

2106
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:27,680
Oh my god!

2107
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:29,000
She didn't leave!

2108
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:30,720
Thank God!

2109
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:32,940
Now this team is balanced.

2110
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:36,140
This team is balanced now.

2111
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:37,660
Think of it like a treasure hunt.

2112
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:39,300
Doesn't that get you excited?

2113
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:41,980
I guess.

2114
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:44,180
But then it's decided.

2115
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:47,040
I call first dibs!

2116
02:38:47,220 --> 02:38:47,540
Yay!

2117
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:52,140
This is the team, guys.

2118
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:53,960
Oh, thank God.

2119
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:57,600
We're like, we're like chipping down rescue rangers!

2120
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:00,580
Oh, but Wait, where did she go?

2121
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,400
She just wants to shop.

2122
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:06,540
She's only here to shop.

2123
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:10,340
The dream team.

2124
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:13,100
Out of the Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers.

2125
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:17,140
This is basically it.

2126
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:19,700
What a team.

2127
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:21,160
I'm Chip.

2128
02:39:21,900 --> 02:39:24,280
He's Dale because we're both the same height.

2129
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:25,900
He's the...

2130
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:27,880
I forgot the name.

2131
02:39:28,020 --> 02:39:29,120
The guy with the funky...

2132
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:30,580
Because he has a mustache too!

2133
02:39:31,240 --> 02:39:32,960
He also has a mustache!

2134
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:35,000

The fly's the tank.

02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:52,220
That's who's the fly.

2140
02:39:55,660 --> 02:39:57,960

02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:09,350
Dark energy.

2176
02:44:10,350 --> 02:44:11,730
Power of darkness.

2177
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:14,010
What the fuck is power of darkness?

2178
02:44:15,630 --> 02:44:17,150
Can I, like, attack them?

2179
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:18,830

2196
02:45:48,210 --> 02:45:51,350
The ocean's Right outside of sandland.

02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,870

2198
02:45:53,010 --> 02:45:54,630

I didn't do anything wrong.

2203
02:46:13,550 --> 02:46:23,690
I like how I think my favorite part is that even though I'm
on the dino, they have to I think I think that's the

02:47:28,490 --> 02:47:30,050

2214
02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:34,290
I parked the Raptor, guys.

2215
02:47:34,750 --> 02:47:35,670
There's no way.

2216
02:47:36,230 --> 02:47:36,510
No!

2217
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:38,190
Don't say that!

2218
02:47:40,210 --> 02:47:41,490
Use materials to prepare.

2219
02:47:41,590 --> 02:47:44,270
Once repaired, Tyler will provide you with the map of the
icon.

2220
02:47:45,050 --> 02:47:45,410
Can I?

2221
02:47:46,110 --> 02:47:46,950
Can I, though?

2222
02:47:48,310 --> 02:47:49,850
I parked the Raptor.

2223
02:47:49,950 --> 02:47:51,150
I

2224
02:47:59,030 --> 02:48:10,450
There's no way There's no way We had like a bond There's no
way The raptor and I had a bond Where did he go?

2225
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:14,860
No!

2226
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:18,660
I parked you in everything!

2227
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:20,100
What?

2228
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:22,460
Guys, I got dino jacked!

2229
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:26,260
There's no way he would never run away Someone jacked my
dino I know.

2230
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:33,660
There's been a robbery.

2231
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:39,840
Somebody jacked my dino.

2232
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:44,460
He went home.

2233
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:46,920
I've been dino jacked.

2234
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:48,880
This is serious.

2235
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:52,240
Crime is not a joke.

2236
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:55,640
According to the map.

2237
02:48:55,660 --> 02:49:06,520
this area is near the center of sandland someone gtaed the
dino i gtaed i can't believe it i can't believe it the steep

2238
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:17,790
cliffs make traveling north or south of here a serious
challenge i can't believe someone downloaded my dino let's

I'm so sad.

02:49:34,090 --> 02:49:34,870
We got to file.

2243
02:49:34,910 --> 02:49:36,070
We got to call the cops.

2244
02:49:36,210 --> 02:49:37,770
We got to file a police report.

2245
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:39,890
This is important.

2246
02:49:43,450 --> 02:49:45,310
My fucking car.

2247
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:47,710
Oh, God.

2248
02:49:47,930 --> 02:49:48,310
Whoa.

2249
02:49:48,510 --> 02:49:49,130
Here we go.

2250
02:49:50,270 --> 02:49:51,510
I'm so sad.

2251
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:57,590
How...

2252
02:49:57,990 --> 02:50:10,670

2255
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:32,250
All right.

2256
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:33,930
There has to be loot in here.

2257
02:50:34,910 --> 02:50:35,830
Consume the metal.

2258
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:40,010
Return to the mother tank.

2259
02:50:41,050 --> 02:50:41,290
All right.

2260
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:41,670
Loot.

2261
02:50:42,290 --> 02:50:42,570
Loot.

2262
02:50:43,230 --> 02:50:43,870
Yeah, loot.

2263
02:50:44,190 --> 02:50:47,630
According to the map, this area is near the center of
Sandland.

2264
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:49,090
This is the center?

2265
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:52,490
So we can reach a bunch of places from here, huh?

2266
02:50:52,510 --> 02:50:53,530
Wait, where did my tank go?

2267
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:55,110
Did I got fucking GTT'd?

2268
02:50:55,250 --> 02:50:57,970
The steep cliffs make traveling to the north or south?

2269
02:50:57,990 --> 02:51:06,310
of here a serious challenge pretty inconvenient for a
central hub i almost got i can't believe it i almost got

2270
02:51:06,310 --> 02:51:16,690
grand theft tank but it's okay i have more capsules but if
there's a whole junkers market right below oh my god look

2271
02:51:17,290 --> 02:51:24,570
surely those junkers have long since stripped it of anything
valuable my loot now

2272
02:51:27,990 --> 02:51:29,110
cost us a pretty penny.

2273
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:30,330
It's okay, guys.

2274
02:51:31,050 --> 02:51:33,530
I've been a loot goblin.

2275
02:51:33,830 --> 02:51:35,010
We have so much loot.

2276
02:51:36,190 --> 02:51:37,770
We're so rich now.

2277
02:51:39,770 --> 02:51:40,630
Oh, no, I have to reload.

2278
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:42,350
Don't worry.

2279
02:51:43,310 --> 02:51:45,570
We're going to kill some scorpions.

2280
02:51:47,170 --> 02:51:48,850
This has to be enough money.

2281
02:51:49,730 --> 02:51:50,890
Oh my God, there's more loot.

2282
02:51:52,290 --> 02:51:54,830
Let's go into this suspiciously dark cave.

2283
02:51:56,570 --> 02:51:57,530
Let's not.

2284
02:52:00,290 --> 02:52:01,530
Get in the tank!

2285
02:52:02,470 --> 02:52:04,110
Get in the tank, B's above!

2286
02:52:07,990 --> 02:52:08,470
Okay.

2287
02:52:09,390 --> 02:52:09,770
It's okay.

2288
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:12,150
He's not gonna slap me while I bring out the tank, right?

2289
02:52:12,190 --> 02:52:12,390
Oh!

2290
02:52:13,250 --> 02:52:15,190
Oh, he definitely slapped me.

2291
02:52:17,610 --> 02:52:19,490
Get in the pocket tank.

2292
02:52:21,310 --> 02:52:22,190
Here we go.

2293
02:52:23,090 --> 02:52:23,570
Boom.

2294
02:52:24,150 --> 02:52:24,490
There we go.

2295
02:52:25,310 --> 02:52:26,950
Now I can...

2296
02:52:28,030 --> 02:52:31,770
Now I can loot the suspiciously dark cave.

2297
02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:35,490
Another loot page.

2298
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:37,390
Man, I sure wish I could read.

2299
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:39,230
Look.

2300
02:52:40,310 --> 02:52:40,590
Look.

2301
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:43,210
We need to keep our bearings passing between the cliffs.

2302
02:52:45,090 --> 02:52:48,450
It's easy to lose this massive direction on these windy
roads.

2303
02:52:50,770 --> 02:52:53,410
If you get lost, be sure to check the map.

2304
02:52:54,570 --> 02:52:56,670
Guys, I know how to read the map.

2305
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:59,970
I might be illiterate, but I can look at picture books.

2306
02:53:01,510 --> 02:53:04,190
Do I need to drink water?

2307
02:53:05,170 --> 02:53:06,870
Nah, we don't need to stay hydrated.

2308
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:13,010
Alright, we gotta...

2309
02:53:13,010 --> 02:53:15,690
Okay, let's kill these scorpions for more loot.

2310
02:53:16,710 --> 02:53:18,310
And then we'll run over the babies.

2311
02:53:21,170 --> 02:53:24,090
Okay, we'll attempt to run over the babies.

2312
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:37,610

Now look what's become of such technology.

2316
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:01,450
How the fuck did I get?

2317
02:54:01,570 --> 02:54:02,730
Oh, I get up from here.

2318
02:54:03,010 --> 02:54:04,030
You truly are fools.

2319
02:54:05,210 --> 02:54:06,130
What a shame.

2320
02:54:07,330 --> 02:54:09,050
I wish I could see it airborne.

2321
02:54:10,630 --> 02:54:11,430
I did it.

2322
02:54:11,710 --> 02:54:12,250
I helped.

2323
02:54:12,450 --> 02:54:12,670
Whoa!

2324
02:54:14,410 --> 02:54:15,530
There's ruins here?

2325
02:54:15,670 --> 02:54:17,630
Considering how conspicuous they are.

2326
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:22,290
Throughout your travels, you encounter people attacked by
monsters or gangs.

2327
02:54:22,490 --> 02:54:23,450
Save them and you're...

2328
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:25,950
I love getting rewarded for my efforts.

2329
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:28,570
Aren't you a killjoy?

2330
02:54:29,930 --> 02:54:30,290
Alright.

2331
02:54:30,950 --> 02:54:31,350
Hey, yeah.

2332
02:54:31,630 --> 02:54:34,770
When it comes to finding the treasure inside it.

2333
02:54:34,950 --> 02:54:35,410
Hey, yeah.

2334
02:54:35,530 --> 02:54:36,230
Right, old man?

2335
02:54:36,690 --> 02:54:37,570
My fees aren't cheap.

2336
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:39,910
Assuming there's treasure to be found.

2337
02:54:40,930 --> 02:54:42,130
Josie, thank you for the super chat.

2338
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:42,850
Thank you, thank you.

2339
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:43,510
Hi, Toki.

2340
02:54:43,570 --> 02:54:45,850
With all the sand, do you find it coarse, rough, and
irritating?

2341
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:47,090
Does it get everywhere?

2342
02:54:47,190 --> 02:54:48,370
I fucking hate sand.

2343
02:54:48,890 --> 02:54:49,870
I say yes.

2344
02:54:49,990 --> 02:54:50,930
I play sand land.

2345
02:54:51,250 --> 02:54:52,730
Wait, what's my...

2346
02:54:52,730 --> 02:54:54,090

I was supposed to bring a tank down here to blast that.

2365
02:56:38,190 --> 02:56:38,610
Hello?

2366
02:56:39,370 --> 02:56:40,550

Let me destroy it.

2374
02:56:58,110 --> 02:57:00,090
Sorry, I got a little British there.

2375
02:57:00,530 --> 02:57:01,190
for a sec.

2376
02:57:05,370 --> 02:57:07,070
I'm not that noble.

2377
02:57:08,570 --> 02:57:09,710
Oh, there's a door here.

2378
02:57:09,870 --> 02:57:11,010
If we don't help each other.

2379
02:57:13,350 --> 02:57:13,830
I guess.

2380
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:16,370
All right.

2381
02:57:16,590 --> 02:57:17,410
We go this way.

2382
02:57:17,690 --> 02:57:17,910
Oh!

2383
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:19,030
Oh!

2384
02:57:20,290 --> 02:57:20,470
Oh!

2385
02:57:22,490 --> 02:57:23,730
I don't like that.

2386
02:57:23,870 --> 02:57:24,890
I don't like those bugs.

2387
02:57:25,050 --> 02:57:26,750
The ones with like million the millipedes.

2388
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:27,410
Ugh.

2389
02:57:29,270 --> 02:57:31,330
I have filled that museum.

2390
02:57:32,410 --> 02:57:33,930
That got too detailed.

2391
02:57:36,630 --> 02:57:36,990
What did I get?

2392
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:38,530
I got an ancient gold.

2393
02:57:38,530 --> 02:57:40,490
Oh, I got the gold coin for the cat.

2394
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:42,050
For Meow Jin Boo.

2395
02:57:44,930 --> 02:57:44,970
Okay.

2396
02:57:45,410 --> 02:57:48,970
I guess that's what the coins are for.

2397
02:57:48,970 --> 02:57:49,910
What the ruins are for.

2398
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:52,970
I bet they've got loads of loot in there.

2399
02:57:55,310 --> 02:57:58,450
But somehow I doubt they'll take kindly to intruders.

2400
02:57:58,730 --> 02:58:00,410
If I don't look at them, they don't exist.

2401
02:58:00,530 --> 02:58:11,570
shock you out of it please at least try to be sneaky about
it oh millipede's incentive ah i hate it i hate it i hate

02:58:11,570 --> 02:58:14,740

2403
02:58:18,250 --> 02:58:23,350

02:58:34,860 --> 02:58:36,160
Feet froze love millipedes.

2406
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:44,820
You know, I saw a short that's saying that like the Prince
Charming in Cinderella is a feet guy.

2407
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:53,040
Because who else would go like door to door for like
thousands of hundreds of towns trying to find his like with

2408
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:54,360
just a glass slipper.

2409
02:58:54,820 --> 02:58:56,060
Just think about that.

2410
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:00,860
It makes sense, guys.

2411
02:59:01,640 --> 02:59:02,880
It makes sense.

2412
02:59:03,800 --> 02:59:06,900
He's 100% a feet guy.

2413
02:59:12,390 --> 02:59:13,210
Hey, guys.

2414
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:15,430

2419
02:59:28,570 --> 02:59:30,370
You can tell yourself that.

2420
02:59:30,570 --> 02:59:31,690
We get what we came for.

2421
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:34,810
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

2422
02:59:35,270 --> 02:59:37,110
And he somehow found the room.

2423
02:59:37,130 --> 02:59:46,630
real person with the same feet size that he knew 100% yeah
after checking hundreds of people she was literally the only

2424
02:59:46,630 --> 02:59:54,290

every how would he know

Look, somebody stole my dino.

2431
03:00:48,910 --> 03:00:51,110
So I have the right to steal somebody else's dino.

2432
03:00:51,850 --> 03:00:52,870
It's a...

2433
03:00:54,070 --> 03:00:55,550
It's just a demon is talking to me.

2434
03:00:56,210 --> 03:00:57,890
It's just the cycle of life.

2435
03:00:58,170 --> 03:00:58,870
No, no.

2436
03:00:59,270 --> 03:00:59,950
What should I do?

2437
03:01:00,710 --> 03:01:01,630
It's the end for me.

2438
03:01:02,610 --> 03:01:03,470
I don't want to die.

2439
03:01:03,470 --> 03:01:04,410
Dino for dino.

2440
03:01:04,410 --> 03:01:13,470

trying to kill you but my granny told me I die if a demon

So I can beat them up.

2445
03:01:37,470 --> 03:01:41,070
But I can't just keep talking to demons like this.

2446
03:01:41,110 --> 03:01:41,610
Why not?

2447
03:01:42,170 --> 03:01:43,290
Get to the point.

2448
03:01:43,810 --> 03:01:47,330
If you're scared of my words, you don't want to see what my
fists can see.

2449
03:01:47,350 --> 03:01:47,530
Yeah.

2450
03:01:47,910 --> 03:01:49,970
I punched a lot of baby dinosaurs.

2451
03:01:50,770 --> 03:01:52,290
And I felt nothing.

2452
03:01:54,910 --> 03:01:56,830

2466
03:02:30,450 --> 03:02:31,870
He's just like him.

2467

2518
03:06:02,290 --> 03:06:06,270
They found this jump bot on board the Lysaw battleship.

2519
03:06:06,910 --> 03:06:07,350
Sheep.

2520
03:06:07,570 --> 03:06:08,370
You're all sheep.

2521
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:12,350
You're just like him.

2522
03:06:12,910 --> 03:06:16,550
Watch this out and hog all the parts on the ship ever since.

2523
03:06:17,410 --> 03:06:20,750
Sure, finders, keepers is something of a way of life among
junkers.

2524
03:06:22,510 --> 03:06:22,710

Haven't chosen a cake yet, so I'm asking you to pick a
flavor.

2531
03:06:28,690 --> 03:06:31,570
The wilder, the better, since I've had sushi cake last year.

2532
03:06:32,130 --> 03:06:33,270
Get green tea.

2533

Jump bot for ourselves, if we clobber them.

2542
03:07:03,050 --> 03:07:05,610

He's going to find out what's her YouTube account.

Okay, nice.

2571
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:50,800
I don't have to get off my tank.

2572
03:09:51,180 --> 03:09:52,720
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

2573

Thank you so much.

2577
03:09:57,760 --> 03:09:58,060
Okay.

2578
03:09:59,240 --> 03:10:02,220
It's not a crime if they deserve it.

2579
03:10:05,440 --> 03:10:06,740
They scared my...

2580
03:10:06,740 --> 03:10:08,180
They wouldn't let me have my...

2581
03:10:08,200 --> 03:10:17,540
idols looks like this cave leads straight to the lisa
battleship wait is that the part that the junkers have

2582
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:26,920
cobbled together a convenient route between the market and
battleship oh here it is there it is but how do i no dino

2583
03:10:26,920 --> 03:10:40,220
for you that's so up oh i have to jump i have to parkour
guys i found the yellow i found the fucking yellow it's

2584
03:10:40,220 --> 03:10:49,620
always the yellow all right this way this way I like how
like the sound is I like the sound design for this game like

2585
03:10:49,620 --> 03:10:53,620
even in the case you can tell like we're in the caves with
the immersion

2586
03:10:57,940 --> 03:11:04,940
find all sorts of treasure hidden around the world use that
these skills leave radar to make locating treasure easier

2587
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:09,000
but I don't treasure.

2588
03:11:09,360 --> 03:11:12,900
As I can tell, neatness is an alien concept to junkers.

2589
03:11:13,780 --> 03:11:14,800
Spood booster chip.

2590
03:11:14,900 --> 03:11:16,760
Oh, I found like a booster chip.

2591
03:11:17,060 --> 03:11:18,020
Oh, that's nice.

2592
03:11:18,640 --> 03:11:20,660
Roku, thank you for the gifted chips.

2593
03:11:20,840 --> 03:11:20,920

Thank you.

2595
03:11:22,680 --> 03:11:24,600
The yellow paint cave.

2596
03:11:25,180 --> 03:11:25,900
My favorite.

2597
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:28,760
My favorite type of cave.

2598
03:11:30,500 --> 03:11:31,660
I don't need ladders.

2599
03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:32,560
I can parkour.

2600
03:11:33,740 --> 03:11:34,960
Wait, which way do I go?

2601
03:11:35,060 --> 03:11:37,240
Oh, this has to be... Okay, this is the lore.

2602
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:50,240
maybe there's loot here i knew it cave is huge i knew it i'm
a real gamer guys welcome to level design that the junkers

2603
03:11:50,240 --> 03:12:02,020

2604
03:12:02,020 --> 03:12:04,520

2606
03:12:18,900 --> 03:12:25,140
like okay it was never locked dokey it was never locked you

2607
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:46,220
oh so this is the battleship's interior oh okay that's
pretty this is amazing it's so beautiful let me send a tank

2608
03:12:46,220 --> 03:13:08,390
in it's so beautiful time to destroy it all with a tank oh
even the music's nice though oh I love the BGM for this

2609
03:13:08,390 --> 03:13:17,810
looks like we've hit a dead end oh there has to be a boss
fight in the sand from the main cannon Blow it all away.

2610
03:13:20,570 --> 03:13:21,250
Ha ha!

2611
03:13:21,950 --> 03:13:23,330
We're going to destroy...

2612
03:13:23,330 --> 03:13:25,990
We're going to destroy a world wonder.

2613
03:13:29,310 --> 03:13:30,710
Yeah, I'm inside the ship.

2614
03:13:33,390 --> 03:13:33,870
Oh.

2615
03:13:35,050 --> 03:13:36,210
What's this?

2616
03:13:36,750 --> 03:13:37,990
Yes, that's the way.

2617
03:13:40,210 --> 03:13:41,430
No, he's too thick!

2618
03:13:41,730 --> 03:13:43,250
Guys, close the door.

2619
03:13:46,150 --> 03:13:50,110
Guys, I need you guys to close the door.

2620
03:13:53,790 --> 03:13:55,310
Bro, I don't know, guys.

2621
03:13:55,550 --> 03:13:58,750
I think my allies are a bit stupid.

2622
03:13:59,050 --> 03:14:01,230
Okay, what if I do this and I turn around?

2623
03:14:01,390 --> 03:14:02,550
And it's magic.

2624
03:14:03,090 --> 03:14:04,070
It's a magic trick.

2625
03:14:05,470 --> 03:14:07,510
Guys, you guys like my magic trick?

2626
03:14:09,050 --> 03:14:10,330
The door is stuck.

2627
03:14:10,670 --> 03:14:13,290
Literally all they had to do was just close the door.

2628
03:14:14,010 --> 03:14:14,550
That's all they...

2629
03:14:14,550 --> 03:14:15,230
Wait, can I...

2630
03:14:15,230 --> 03:14:16,990
Oh, they have invisible walls for a reason.

2631
03:14:17,010 --> 03:14:17,290
reason.

2632
03:14:17,550 --> 03:14:18,530
They doki-proofed it.

2633
03:14:18,530 --> 03:14:21,270
Where did the guys with the jump bot go again?

2634
03:14:22,570 --> 03:14:24,250
They did not doki-proof it.

2635
03:14:26,550 --> 03:14:31,030
You'll most likely be on the upper levels given the ship's
layout.

2636
03:14:31,650 --> 03:14:32,210
Up, huh?

2637
03:14:32,870 --> 03:14:33,510
Got it!

2638
03:14:35,230 --> 03:14:35,830
Alright.

2639
03:14:36,490 --> 03:14:40,770
We got more B grade stuff.

2640
03:14:41,770 --> 03:14:45,670
I assume like, okay there must be loot around here, right?

2641
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:48,550
Because we have to go to the top.

2642
03:14:48,850 --> 03:14:51,050
So there must be, like, hidden loot right here.

2643
03:14:51,950 --> 03:14:54,410
We're judging by my gamer skills.

2644
03:14:55,070 --> 03:14:55,510
There must...

2645
03:14:55,510 --> 03:14:55,790
Okay.

2646
03:14:56,430 --> 03:14:57,790
Just not here, apparently.

2647
03:14:57,850 --> 03:14:58,310
Here we go.

2648
03:14:58,690 --> 03:14:59,750
I guess not here.

2649
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:02,750
Alright.

2650
03:15:03,850 --> 03:15:04,330
Yellow!

2651
03:15:06,690 --> 03:15:08,090
Thank God for the yellow.

2652
03:15:10,650 --> 03:15:11,670
So I make sure.

2653
03:15:12,590 --> 03:15:13,430
I mean...

2654
03:15:13,430 --> 03:15:14,710
There has to be loot around...

2655
03:15:14,710 --> 03:15:15,090
Oh, fuck.

2656
03:15:15,230 --> 03:15:15,390
Okay.

2657
03:15:15,790 --> 03:15:16,350
What the fuck?

2658
03:15:16,430 --> 03:15:16,990
They actually used my...

2659
03:15:17,010 --> 03:15:17,690
double jump?

2660
03:15:20,150 --> 03:15:21,910
There should be loot right here, right?

2661
03:15:23,470 --> 03:15:24,850
Like, extra loot?

2662
03:15:25,330 --> 03:15:26,510
Because, like, look, there's this.

2663
03:15:27,850 --> 03:15:30,430
Have I jumped on this platform and then here?

2664
03:15:31,390 --> 03:15:31,950
What?

2665
03:15:33,670 --> 03:15:35,110
What the fuck?

2666
03:15:36,450 --> 03:15:38,770
Guys, you just watched me jump like that?

2667
03:15:38,910 --> 03:15:39,810
You're not gonna be helped, though?

2668
03:15:41,330 --> 03:15:42,410
Surely, right?

2669
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:44,230
Like, huh?

2670
03:15:45,590 --> 03:15:47,550
Oh, there's, like, What?

2671
03:15:47,650 --> 03:15:49,350
I can't stand on the pipes?

2672
03:15:50,310 --> 03:15:51,010
But what?

2673
03:15:53,390 --> 03:15:54,830
That's fucked up, yo.

2674
03:15:55,750 --> 03:15:58,150
They wouldn't let me stand on the pipes, guys.

2675
03:15:58,830 --> 03:15:59,550
No floor.

2676
03:16:02,210 --> 03:16:03,310
Okay, this way.

2677
03:16:03,610 --> 03:16:05,090
What the heck happened here?

2678
03:16:05,670 --> 03:16:07,170
The place is a mess.

2679
03:16:09,790 --> 03:16:11,070

2714
03:18:11,770 --> 03:18:12,890
Performing leg sweep.

2715
03:18:15,650 --> 03:18:17,690
Allows you to evade mid-jump.

2716
03:18:18,170 --> 03:18:19,570
Focuses your energy releasing.

2717
03:18:19,710 --> 03:18:20,250

2718
03:18:20,250 --> 03:18:21,270

Hey guys, I have a feeling one of them is more helpful than
the other.

2726
03:19:06,310 --> 03:19:10,090
Wow, I knew the interior was so huge.

2727
03:19:11,630 --> 03:19:14,170
I'm straining my neck just looking at the ceiling.

2728
03:19:14,930 --> 03:19:16,590
Okay, case in point.

2729
03:19:17,730 --> 03:19:19,450
We can't reach the upper levels.

2730
03:19:20,110 --> 03:19:20,750
We can jump.

2731
03:19:21,030 --> 03:19:22,470

It's the Royal Army?

2736
03:20:02,770 --> 03:20:04,910
Guys, the girl doesn't need upgrades.

2737
03:20:05,090 --> 03:20:06,130
She's already perfect.

2738
03:20:06,830 --> 03:20:08,730
She's just there to upgrade my tank.

2739
03:20:14,510 --> 03:20:15,690
It's mine.

2740
03:20:16,670 --> 03:20:17,950
Doki, he's old.

2741
03:20:18,250 --> 03:20:19,870
Give him some slack.

2742
03:20:21,910 --> 03:20:22,610
Tank time.

2743
03:20:23,790 --> 03:20:24,550
Tank time.

2744
03:20:25,530 --> 03:20:26,030
Boom.

2745
03:20:27,670 --> 03:20:28,110
Boom!

2746
03:20:29,890 --> 03:20:30,990
Guys, is this overkill?

2747
03:20:31,670 --> 03:20:31,970
No.

2748
03:20:32,370 --> 03:20:33,430

03:20:33,430 --> 03:20:34,430
What was this gonna do?

2750
03:20:34,650 --> 03:20:34,870
Explode?

2751
03:20:35,810 --> 03:20:36,690
Oh, shit!

2752
03:20:39,670 --> 03:20:40,110
Guys.

2753
03:20:41,750 --> 03:20:43,890
I think it exploded, guys.

2754
03:20:45,410 --> 03:20:45,850
Oh, wait.

2755
03:20:45,910 --> 03:20:46,770
There's stuff here.

2756
03:20:49,970 --> 03:20:51,010
Guys, you want to see a magic trick?

2757
03:20:51,070 --> 03:20:51,650

2758
03:20:53,730 --> 03:20:54,170

Averkidap.

2763
03:21:02,930 --> 03:21:06,390
Pretty sure I could get over that with a hijack.

2764
03:21:08,750 --> 03:21:09,810
Sorry, there was a delay.

2765
03:21:11,230 --> 03:21:11,570

Guys, it's understandable, okay?

2768
03:21:17,870 --> 03:21:19,770
My magic trick was lagging, okay?

2769
03:21:20,250 --> 03:21:21,270
There's like...

2770
03:21:21,870 --> 03:21:22,810
I'm on a...

2771
03:21:22,810 --> 03:21:26,110
I'm on an East Coast server at the moment, so it lagged a
little.

2772
03:21:29,770 --> 03:21:32,370
Is this open open sesame.

2773
03:21:32,590 --> 03:21:37,430
Oh, I definitely need to take locked inside They're not
locked in here.

2774

2776
03:21:47,550 --> 03:21:48,890

Yeah, what's this?

2783
03:22:08,830 --> 03:22:11,050
That switch probably controls this elevator.

2784
03:22:11,770 --> 03:22:11,870
Where?

2785
03:22:12,330 --> 03:22:13,110

So you reload this real fast, too.

2820
03:23:54,150 --> 03:23:56,430
A crane for lifting containers.

2821
03:23:57,750 --> 03:24:05,090
You think if we shoot the arm, we might be able to use the

There's a secret here.

2826
03:24:39,730 --> 03:24:40,510
There's a secret.

2827
03:24:42,470 --> 03:24:43,190

Look at all the yellow doors!

2830
03:24:48,290 --> 03:24:50,270
Not a good place to call it.

2831
03:24:50,410 --> 03:24:50,970
Okay, don't worry.

2832
03:24:52,150 --> 03:24:52,310

Okay, and then reload.

03:25:08,730 --> 03:25:09,830
Oh, I'm not you!

2839
03:25:10,750 --> 03:25:11,030
Oh, God.

2840
03:25:11,110 --> 03:25:11,690

2841
03:25:12,130 --> 03:25:12,850
How did I miss?

2842
03:25:13,190 --> 03:25:13,950

Look at all these yellow doors for me.

2845
03:25:24,220 --> 03:25:26,460
I'm so far away from the objective.

2846
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:28,460
Wait, the yellow stopped.

2847
03:25:29,860 --> 03:25:30,680
Is the yellow here?

2848
03:25:30,780 --> 03:25:32,020
Oh, there's the yellow light.

2849
03:25:34,220 --> 03:25:35,420
There's the yellow light.

2850
03:25:36,260 --> 03:25:36,740
Where's the blue light?

2851
03:25:38,400 --> 03:25:39,700
Where is it?

2852
03:25:40,820 --> 03:25:41,280
Oh, no!

2853
03:25:41,640 --> 03:25:42,460

There you go.

2857
03:25:48,820 --> 03:25:50,820
Okay, we gotta grab the mats, though.

Don't worry.

2864
03:25:58,560 --> 03:25:59,520
My tank is okay.

2865
03:26:00,420 --> 03:26:00,800
Guys.

2866
03:26:01,500 --> 03:26:02,580
My tank will be okay.

2867
03:26:04,420 --> 03:26:05,920
Where the fuck is the loot?

2868
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:11,720
What did I get?

2869
03:26:13,640 --> 03:26:17,460
You have acquired an option module that have various
effects.

2870
03:26:17,620 --> 03:26:19,720
Use them to gain advantage in battles.

2871
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:23,540
Their special parts cannot be crafted or upgraded on their
own.

2872
03:26:23,860 --> 03:26:26,480
Their own effects grow together with the vehicle's level.

2873
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,180
Activate using L, B, and RT.

2874
03:26:29,860 --> 03:26:33,220
After using an active effect, you must wait for the
cooldown.

2875
03:26:34,880 --> 03:26:35,480
Oh!

2876
03:26:36,800 --> 03:26:39,340
Prince, I can't lend you a hand.

2877
03:26:40,200 --> 03:26:42,540
Wait, I had to activate my...

2878
03:26:42,540 --> 03:26:43,540
Oh, my God.

2879
03:26:44,480 --> 03:26:45,680
I thought he was trying...

2880
03:26:45,680 --> 03:26:48,140
He was already doing that for me.

2881
03:26:48,580 --> 03:26:49,120
Alright, guys.

2882
03:26:49,380 --> 03:26:50,940
Is there any doors back here?

2883
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:51,800
Just in case?

2884
03:26:52,700 --> 03:26:53,560
Alright, no doors.

2885
03:26:54,480 --> 03:26:54,760
Alright.

2886
03:26:55,460 --> 03:26:57,420
So I can customize my...

2887
03:26:57,420 --> 03:26:58,140
Where is it?

2888
03:26:58,240 --> 03:26:58,840
Is it this?

2889
03:27:01,740 --> 03:27:02,660
Automatic fires.

2890
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:04,220
Ooh, automatic fires.

2891
03:27:04,460 --> 03:27:05,040
Okay, guys.

2892
03:27:05,540 --> 03:27:06,100
Guys.

2893
03:27:06,800 --> 03:27:07,660
Guys, I'm sorry.

2894
03:27:10,340 --> 03:27:11,480
Is it this?

2895
03:27:16,940 --> 03:27:17,100
Oh!

2896
03:27:20,550 --> 03:27:21,790
That's so cool.

2897
03:27:22,990 --> 03:27:24,010
Activated it.

2898
03:27:25,510 --> 03:27:26,390
Alright, we gotta go back.

2899
03:27:26,730 --> 03:27:29,190
Okay, I think I gotta heal my tank a little bit.

2900
03:27:29,690 --> 03:27:30,150
Just a...

2901
03:27:30,150 --> 03:27:31,230
Just a maybe.

2902
03:27:36,370 --> 03:27:37,050
Just...

2903
03:27:37,050 --> 03:27:38,110
Um...

2904
03:27:39,270 --> 03:27:39,950
Just...

2905
03:27:39,950 --> 03:27:41,350
Just a maybe.

2906
03:27:41,530 --> 03:27:42,370
How do I...

2907
03:27:42,370 --> 03:27:44,010
Okay, restore...

2908
03:27:44,030 --> 03:27:44,730
There we go.

2909
03:27:46,530 --> 03:27:47,450
We did it.

2910
03:27:51,350 --> 03:27:56,610
There came a point where, like, I was like, ooh, there was
maybe a little bit too much.

2911
03:27:57,350 --> 03:27:59,970
A little bit too much glowy.

2912
03:28:00,430 --> 03:28:01,650
Wait, have I been through there?

2913
03:28:02,450 --> 03:28:03,790
Wait, there's another yellow door.

2914
03:28:06,210 --> 03:28:07,250
Is this where I came from?

2915
03:28:07,330 --> 03:28:08,650
Oh, this is where I came from.

2916
03:28:09,290 --> 03:28:10,910
Wait, there's a level 16?

2917
03:28:11,450 --> 03:28:13,450
Guys, I think I could take him.

2918
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:16,330
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

2919
03:28:16,930 --> 03:28:18,930
I think I can take him.

2920
03:28:19,690 --> 03:28:20,350
Watch this.

2921
03:28:21,250 --> 03:28:21,950
Watch this.

2922
03:28:23,530 --> 03:28:24,750
Guys, watch this.

2923
03:28:24,850 --> 03:28:25,230
You know why?

2924
03:28:25,330 --> 03:28:25,570
No.

2925
03:28:26,270 --> 03:28:28,710
Because he can't come in through here.

2926
03:28:32,410 --> 03:28:33,630
Guys, watch this.

2927
03:28:33,970 --> 03:28:34,750
There's no way.

2928
03:28:34,870 --> 03:28:35,590
Watch, guys.

2929
03:28:36,310 --> 03:28:37,490
I can take him.

2930
03:28:37,790 --> 03:28:38,950
Guys, what is he gonna do?

2931
03:28:39,030 --> 03:28:40,210
Go through that door?

2932
03:28:43,730 --> 03:28:45,490
That's fucking right.

2933
03:28:46,470 --> 03:28:47,110
That's fucking right.

2934
03:28:47,330 --> 03:28:48,690
What are you going to do about it?

2935
03:28:49,070 --> 03:28:49,590
That's right.

2936
03:28:49,730 --> 03:28:51,050
Oh, he went through the door.

2937
03:28:51,530 --> 03:28:54,450
Guys, guys, he went through the door.

2938
03:28:55,050 --> 03:28:56,390
He was not too thick.

2939
03:28:56,470 --> 03:28:58,310
I thought he'd be too thick, guys.

2940
03:29:03,340 --> 03:29:05,640
Guys, he was not thick.

2941
03:29:06,520 --> 03:29:08,700
He was appropriately sized.

2942
03:29:08,700 --> 03:29:24,740

That's actually bullshit.

2946
03:29:42,320 --> 03:29:45,600
I can't believe I only get like 7 XP.

2947
03:29:48,500 --> 03:29:49,360
I can't believe it.

2948

That was a bounty, right?

2949
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:53,720
That had to be a bounty.

03:31:21,820 --> 03:31:24,780
Oh my god, holy shit, that actually hurt.

2972
03:31:26,300 --> 03:31:27,400
At least they waited, though.

2973
03:31:29,480 --> 03:31:30,780
And we go this way.

2974
03:31:38,320 --> 03:31:43,120

Guys, close the door!

2977
03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:51,100
Don't you hate it when the homies don't close the door?

2978
03:31:54,340 --> 03:31:59,000
Abra Kadabra Ooh, magic.

2979
03:31:59,880 --> 03:32:00,340
Wait, what?

2980
03:32:01,260 --> 03:32:01,980
Oh, there it is.

2981
03:32:02,120 --> 03:32:04,040
I was like, I swore I saw, like, glowing stuff.

2982
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:05,960
Yay!

2983
03:32:06,540 --> 03:32:07,460
Heavy Galen gun.

2984
03:32:08,260 --> 03:32:08,680
What's that?

2985
03:32:08,860 --> 03:32:09,380
A trap.

2986
03:32:10,240 --> 03:32:11,580
There's no traps here.

2987
03:32:13,220 --> 03:32:14,000
Get over here.

2988
03:32:14,240 --> 03:32:14,780
Get over here.

2989
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:16,020
Get over here.

2990
03:32:16,260 --> 03:32:17,040
Fight me at my level.

2991
03:32:17,880 --> 03:32:18,440
There you go.

2992
03:32:19,440 --> 03:32:19,740
Yeah!

2993
03:32:22,500 --> 03:32:24,060
That's the worst trap ever.

2994
03:32:24,740 --> 03:32:25,100
Tango!

2995
03:32:25,380 --> 03:32:26,060
And Super Wifu!

2996
03:32:26,200 --> 03:32:27,360
Welcome to the tomato farm.

2997
03:32:27,440 --> 03:32:28,180
Welcome, welcome!

2998
03:32:28,660 --> 03:32:29,880
Alright, we go up.

2999
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:32,700
Let's see.

3000
03:32:32,740 --> 03:32:33,980
Okay, that is where...

3001
03:32:34,060 --> 03:32:37,600
The actual thing is there's no loot here, so we'll go this
way.

3002
03:32:37,940 --> 03:32:39,380
Alright, hello guys.

3003
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:40,740
Hello.

3004
03:32:42,900 --> 03:32:44,580
That's fucking right, get down.

3005
03:32:45,440 --> 03:32:46,660
Fight me at my level.

3006
03:32:50,200 --> 03:32:52,060
Ooh, that's a big boy.

3007
03:32:52,500 --> 03:32:52,780
Yellow!

3008
03:32:53,560 --> 03:32:55,100
Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.

3009
03:32:55,800 --> 03:32:56,560
Loot, loot, loot.

3010
03:32:57,260 --> 03:32:58,620
There's loot here.

3011
03:33:01,380 --> 03:33:02,420
Where's the yellow?

3012
03:33:04,060 --> 03:33:07,780
You can't just bait me with the yellow and then disappear
like that.

3013
03:33:07,820 --> 03:33:08,900
Here we go.

3014
03:33:09,200 --> 03:33:09,820
There it is.

3015
03:33:11,160 --> 03:33:11,500
Luke.

3016
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:14,300
He's just a little guy.

3017
03:33:14,460 --> 03:33:15,080
Yeah, he is.

3018
03:33:15,860 --> 03:33:16,720
Okay, parkour.

3019
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:19,000
There's more over there.

3020
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:21,200
Nice.

3021
03:33:21,500 --> 03:33:22,960
And that's how you parkour.

3022
03:33:24,600 --> 03:33:25,620
I'm a gamer.

3023
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:28,840
Is that it?

3024
03:33:30,340 --> 03:33:31,200
Is that everything?

3025
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:32,320
I think that was everything.

3026
03:33:34,060 --> 03:33:36,040
yet to do the walk of shame.

3027
03:33:37,540 --> 03:33:38,400
Not me.

3028
03:33:42,840 --> 03:33:44,300
Thank God for the yellow lights.

3029
03:33:45,120 --> 03:33:46,700
I'm so glad they thought of everything.

3030
03:33:47,580 --> 03:33:48,700
Can I just run past it?

3031
03:33:49,080 --> 03:33:50,140
Oh, no, I can't.

3032
03:33:51,700 --> 03:33:52,560
It's okay.

3033
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:55,640
I've killed your dad.

3034
03:33:56,000 --> 03:33:56,760
You're nothing.

3035
03:34:00,000 --> 03:34:02,760
Oh my god, he did so much damage.

3036
03:34:03,540 --> 03:34:04,960
Okay, maybe he is something.

3037
03:34:05,860 --> 03:34:06,560
There you go.

3038
03:34:09,980 --> 03:34:12,640
Guys, there is a possibility that he is something.

3039
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:15,340
Oh, this looks like a boss room.

3040
03:34:17,660 --> 03:34:18,180
100%.

3041
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:19,840
Eh, I guess not.

3042
03:34:21,380 --> 03:34:22,200
Not really.

3043
03:34:22,520 --> 03:34:22,940
Actually.

3044
03:34:23,940 --> 03:34:25,260

At least that was sort of fun.

3115
03:38:15,250 --> 03:38:17,390
I did not expect the 2D part.

3116
03:38:18,910 --> 03:38:20,290
We went 2D, 3D.

3117
03:38:22,850 --> 03:38:24,810

Okay.

3219
03:46:37,550 --> 03:46:39,830
I didn't realize he has his own tank.

3220
03:46:39,970 --> 03:46:43,130
I was afraid I'd blown my chance at writing a jump bot for a
second.

3221
03:46:45,050 --> 03:46:46,570
Prince, you need to learn to control yourself.

3222

Okay.

3239
03:48:16,460 --> 03:48:21,180
Yesterday, a Royal Army tank was hijacked from that base by
unknown saboteurs.

3240
03:48:22,120 --> 03:48:22,340
Hmm.

3241
03:48:25,320 --> 03:48:30,960
The perpetrators have gone on a rampage with their stolen
tank, looting vital water supplies and destroying several

3242
03:48:30,960 --> 03:48:31,380
towns.

3243
03:48:32,900 --> 03:48:40,800

03:52:53,800 --> 03:52:55,520
How do I decorate my village?

3273
03:52:58,200 --> 03:53:06,660
Our only hope is to find that spring as soon as we can Let's
abandon the tank and forget all about this we got lucky they

3274
03:53:06,660 --> 03:53:16,860
still don't know who we really are Some demon you are thief
don't be such a coward But brains I'll keep looking for the

3275
03:53:16,860 --> 03:53:26,720
spring all on my own if I have to look you chose this guy to
join us We could have got the cool centaur I wanted a

3276
03:53:26,720 --> 03:53:29,400
centaur Let me be clear.

3277
03:53:29,900 --> 03:53:40,320
I'm not turning back until I've seen that spring with my own
eyes If you can't handle that then go home already But what

3278
03:53:40,320 --> 03:53:43,080
will everyone say if they see me return without you?

3279
03:53:44,040 --> 03:53:47,420
Yeah, um, well, then you're just a bad guardian.

3280
03:53:47,460 --> 03:53:48,760
I'm sure things will work out.

3281
03:53:49,420 --> 03:53:52,420
Once the jump bot's ready, I just know we'll find the
spring.

3282
03:53:53,440 --> 03:53:55,360
How can you be so sure?

3283
03:53:56,480 --> 03:53:58,500
You're a gutsy one, aren't you?

3284
03:54:01,960 --> 03:54:02,700
Oh, what?

3285
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:04,120
We're out of town now?

3286
03:54:05,160 --> 03:54:06,380
Where's our, where's the woman?

3287
03:54:06,620 --> 03:54:09,640
Anne's fine working on that jump bot all on her own.

3288
03:54:11,420 --> 03:54:12,180
Wait, exactly!

3289
03:54:12,300 --> 03:54:14,940
I spent all my money upgrading the tank, and now they want a
bad...

3290
03:54:14,960 --> 03:54:25,120
what the fuck we're better off getting some rest for the
journey ahead we're going to be aimlessly wandering through

3291
03:54:25,120 --> 03:54:33,880
the southern desert with an entire army on our tail don't
worry I live in the south 30 years ago so I at least know

3292
03:54:33,880 --> 03:54:47,900
the general lay of the land there ah 30 years ago you mean
back when the peachy still inhabited the area oh by when the

3293
03:54:47,900 --> 03:54:58,740
aliens the royal army wiped them all out he was part of the
massacre he's a bad old person we need to push him such a

3294
03:54:58,740 --> 03:55:11,800
tragedy that made my list of the top 10 most foolish things
wait what's number one humanity has ever done foolish but it

3295
03:55:11,800 --> 03:55:15,840
prevented the peachy from destroying all of Sandland with
their doomsday weapon.

3296
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:17,240
Is that a doomsday weapon?

3297
03:55:18,860 --> 03:55:19,260
Really?

3298
03:55:19,640 --> 03:55:21,120
You actually believe that?

3299
03:55:22,060 --> 03:55:23,480
Astor, thank you for the magenta.

3300
03:55:23,900 --> 03:55:23,980
Super.

3301
03:55:24,200 --> 03:55:24,480
Thank you.

3302
03:55:24,520 --> 03:55:25,000
Thank you.

3303
03:55:25,240 --> 03:55:25,680
Hey, Doki.

3304
03:55:25,860 --> 03:55:27,800
I've been loving the streams I've been able to catch.

3305
03:55:28,000 --> 03:55:30,280
Also super excited for the Rob the Bank merch to ship.

3306
03:55:30,380 --> 03:55:30,820
Thank you.

3307
03:55:31,000 --> 03:55:34,340
We might be able to ship it beginning of the next month.

3308
03:55:34,460 --> 03:55:35,320
So I'm super excited.

3309
03:55:36,620 --> 03:55:37,360
The machine we really do.

3310
03:55:37,720 --> 03:55:38,720
Oh my God.

3311
03:55:38,860 --> 03:55:41,080
He got influenced by propaganda.

3312
03:55:41,520 --> 03:55:42,640
He got propagandas.

3313
03:55:42,880 --> 03:55:54,800
what water no that can't be oh my god are peaches like the
piccolo's in this universe it's true all right the brilliant

3314
03:55:54,800 --> 03:56:05,280
i forgot the name of their species the something it starts
with an n right not just for themselves but to share with

3315
03:56:05,280 --> 03:56:11,080
everyone that's a dead boy thank you for the I'll get the
chips, they can thank you.

3316
03:56:11,140 --> 03:56:13,020
Yeah, the Namikin.

3317
03:56:13,300 --> 03:56:16,480
Namik, Namik, not something.

3318
03:56:16,960 --> 03:56:17,520
Namikikin.

3319
03:56:18,480 --> 03:56:22,760
Because the Royal Army's prophets would go up in smoke if
that happened.

3320
03:56:24,080 --> 03:56:26,440
They got rid of the peachy first.

3321
03:56:28,400 --> 03:56:34,160
The massive explosion that happened when they were attacked
was caused by the aquarium they needed to make their machine

3322
03:56:34,160 --> 03:56:34,760
work.

3323
03:56:35,760 --> 03:56:38,980
Which the Royal Army gave them knowing what would have.

3324
03:56:39,000 --> 03:56:52,600
happen and the Royal Army used a massive Aquanium bomb to
wipe out every last one of them no but this is when he

3325
03:56:52,600 --> 03:57:02,140
realized how badly he fucked up before then he was like okay
I was just doing my orders and it can't be that bad now he

3326
03:57:02,140 --> 03:57:11,700
realized everything he doomed humanity the commander of them
who ordered the shots that set off the Aquanium.

3327
03:57:13,140 --> 03:57:14,520
Was it you, Sheriff?

3328
03:57:15,600 --> 03:57:17,280
It was you, wasn't it?

3329
03:57:17,760 --> 03:57:18,920
I do it!

3330
03:57:19,160 --> 03:57:21,500
Okay, we like sort of called this in like...

3331
03:57:23,160 --> 03:57:24,140
We literally...

3332
03:57:24,140 --> 03:57:27,120
We're like, bro, he obviously used to be from the army.

3333
03:57:28,280 --> 03:57:33,240
Resulting explosion destroyed almost my entire village.

3334
03:57:34,880 --> 03:57:38,940
And everyone in my whole brigade apart from me was killed.

3335
03:57:39,000 --> 03:57:44,840
in an instant guys i wrote this game i ghost wrote this game
guys

3336
03:57:48,020 --> 03:57:57,980
they they made us attack now he has more trauma that
explosion wait if they knew why would they make your tanks

3337
03:57:57,980 --> 03:58:09,620
attack inside the blast radius bro stop spoiling the game
dokey our brigade never much like supreme commanders they

3338
03:58:09,620 --> 03:58:12,460
use methods we spoke our minds too much

3339
03:58:15,580 --> 03:58:34,020
oh well not your fault huh you had no idea he still killed
people he's still bro he literally wiped out an entire race

3340
03:58:34,480 --> 03:58:42,800
you can't just be like he was just following orders he knew
what he still The context of wiping the entire race just

3341
03:58:42,800 --> 03:58:47,090
changed He still did it

3342
03:58:53,920 --> 03:59:01,760
Like he's still Like it just changed the context of him Wipe
the reasoning why he wiped the entire race

3343
03:59:08,300 --> 03:59:23,380
But then The peachy were really developing a machine machine
that made water the real faint here it's you wait he murders

3344
03:59:23,380 --> 03:59:42,350
a massive equine he actually murders bro the demons can't
even kill but he can is actually me what

3345
03:59:46,500 --> 03:59:53,380
the fuck is he doing give me a sec I'm gonna turn into a
giant monkey right now.

3346
03:59:54,120 --> 03:59:55,780
Sorry, wrong manga.

3347
03:59:59,480 --> 04:00:00,920
What in the world?

3348
04:00:01,820 --> 04:00:04,920
The Toriyama cinematic universe.

3349
04:00:05,620 --> 04:00:08,600
Because it looks like we're in for a fight.

3350
04:00:24,360 --> 04:00:25,840
Guys, my game crashed.

3351
04:00:31,030 --> 04:00:34,150
Okay, I think that's a good time to call it.

3352
04:00:37,130 --> 04:00:39,630
Okay, I'm gonna call it here.

3353
04:00:40,310 --> 04:00:41,890
I mean, we had a lot.

3354
04:00:42,970 --> 04:00:44,670
We played for...

3355
04:00:45,650 --> 04:00:47,370
We played for four hours.

3356
04:00:47,990 --> 04:00:48,670
Did it save?

3357
04:00:48,810 --> 04:00:51,350
Well, it has auto-saves, so I think we'll be fine.

3358
04:00:51,670 --> 04:00:53,390
Honestly, I've been enjoying it so far.

3359
04:00:53,670 --> 04:00:54,030
I don't know.

3360
04:00:54,110 --> 04:00:55,450
Let's see how long this game is.

3361
04:00:55,550 --> 04:00:55,970
Let me see.

3362
04:00:56,670 --> 04:00:57,150
Sandland.

3363
04:00:57,950 --> 04:01:00,110
How long is the game?

3364
04:01:00,210 --> 04:01:00,910
Let me look it up.

3365
04:01:01,270 --> 04:01:02,410
How long is Sandland?

3366
04:01:02,890 --> 04:01:06,130
It took me 32 hours to finish Sandland.

3367
04:01:07,050 --> 04:01:12,230
Oh my god, okay, um, I'll think about it.

3368
04:01:16,170 --> 04:01:19,530
25, okay, okay, I'm gonna think about it, guys.

3369
04:01:19,650 --> 04:01:21,410
I'm not gonna give you guys any promises.

3370
04:01:21,670 --> 04:01:24,530
If there's a cut to, if there's a part two, there's a part
two.

3371
04:01:24,850 --> 04:01:27,930
If you never see a part two again, you know why.

like everything he owned like all his manga like all the

3379
04:02:28,690 --> 04:02:34,690

i remember i remember one of my favorite one shots that he

3380
04:02:34,690 --> 04:02:43,510
did was uh i think it's called kajika and like he owned
everything and then like it wasn't just like dragon ball z

3381

or dragon ball or like dr sub every single one shot that was
published um my uncle owned owned all of them um and i would

3382
04:02:53,430 --> 04:03:00,270
like hang out in his room reading all the monk like all of
his manga and stuff and i thought like Oh, I really wanted

3383
04:03:00,270 --> 04:03:10,330
to, you know, I, uh, really wanted to, um, check out this
game as, like, uh, you know, like, uh, because I've never

3384
04:03:10,330 --> 04:03:16,930
really played, uh, uh, I guess, like, a Toriyama game on PC
before.

3385
04:03:17,430 --> 04:03:25,430
Um, the last time I played a game based off of any of
Toriyama's works was, um, the Dragon Ball Z game on the Game

3386
04:03:25,430 --> 04:03:26,090
Boy Advance.

3387
04:03:26,370 --> 04:03:34,550
And that was, like, the only time I've ever uh one of his uh
one of his like works being adapted to a video game i never

3388

monster like fighter games i never played any of those on pc
