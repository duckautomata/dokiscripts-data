1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
It's not as helpful as you think it is.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,820
Oh wonderful.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:11,120
Do you remember when we played Brett and Fred and we were trying to use Discord voice and there was enough of a delay that it was still like fucking us up hard?

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,140
And then we actually had to use the in-game timer.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,380
Yeah, we had to use the in-game timer because voice was just not working.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,180
That's basically it.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,080
That won't happen here.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,540
This is a god game.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,160
Alright, so Mint wants to spend like five hours in this game.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,880
So...

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,500
You hate yourself that much, huh?

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,840
More than anyone else.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,840
I mean, Mint, how many times have you played the first game?

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,680
I don't know.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,680
Probably as many times as you.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,520
And that's how much we love Pico Park.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,980
That's how much we love it.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,580
I love you guys so much I don't ever want to stop playing.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,500
Oh my god, really?

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,700
Then let's play all the way to the end, guys.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,460
Okay.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,240
Yeah.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,320
Let's go!

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,300
Guys, do you guys want to know how many worlds that is?

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,900
That's like ten.

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,840
I think that's more than ten actually.

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,640
Can I come to the game now?

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,780
Alright.

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, I'm live now.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,580
Oh, I'm streaming.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,280
Hi!

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,740
Hello!

33
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,840
We're all streaming.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,220
So...

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,620
Hello, everybody.

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,080
Welcome to Pico Park 2.

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,800
We all have foogies that tell us what color we are.

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm yellow.

39
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,880
Guys, please, I can't move.

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,080
Yeah, you were on my head the entire time.

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,380
Guys!

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,080
It's Ridd, please!

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,800
Ridd, please!

44
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,600
Ridd!

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,660
Oh my gosh!

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,420
Is something happening?

47
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,780
Ridd's butt is on me!

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,340
What the fuck?

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,860
Please!

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,660
I can't move.

51
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,340
What if I switch between you guys?

52
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,240
Oh, that's good!

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,260
We can't die yet.

54
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,480
That's good.

55
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,960
Here we go.

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,500
Guys, I think we can...

57
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
I think we have to do it at the same time.

58
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,040
Wait, what?

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,020
Wait, why doesn't the spring jump?

60
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,160
Maybe we have to do it at the same time.

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,900
There's like one for each of us, so I feel like that has to be a mechanic.

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,660
Okay.

63
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,700
Surely.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
Okay, why don't we all get off the spring, guys?

65
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,660
Why don't we all...

66
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,100
Guys, the spring's not working.

67
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,060
Why don't we all get off the spring, guys?

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,780
We have a method.

69
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,320
Okay, wait.

70
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,240
I think I know.

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,360
What if, like, I fall from here and then...

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,500
Okay, no, that doesn't work.

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,860
Wait, what?

74
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,140
Guys, I don't...

75
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,820
There's no way.

76
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,500
There's no way we're tall enough.

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
There's like eight of us.

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,480
Think it up.

79
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,260
What if someone jumps from the top person?

80
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,520
Oh, that's true!

81
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,980
We make a tower.

82
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,840
We make a tower.

83
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,380
Oh.

84
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,940
Okay.

85
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,220
There's like a little diving board.

86
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,080
Alright, do we have a diving board?

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,760
Guys.

88
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,360
Guys, this is level one, guys.

89
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,100
Guys, this is level...

90
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,500
It's level one.

91
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,300
Okay, I'm stuck.

92
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm up, I'm up.

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,260
Okay, I'm stuck.

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm up, I'm up.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,320
Okay, what are we...

96
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,680
Okay, keep going up, guys.

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,080
Going up, going up.

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,660
Is it enough to get to the top?

99
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,420
No, I don't think so.

100
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,620
We got this.

101
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,220
We got this.

102
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,820
We can make it.

103
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,220
We can make it if we try.

104
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,800
Wait.

105
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,780
Oh my god.

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,020
We did make it.

107
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,580
Press the button.

108
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,260
Press the button.

109
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,240
I can be here the whole...

110
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
Oh, it works now.

111
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,100
Now they're yelling at you.

112
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Let's go.

113
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,140
We did have to stack.

114
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,740
I can't believe it was that easy.

115
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,580
You have to jump on the button every time.

116
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,160
Well, someone's tongue gets bumped.

117
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,740
You have to keep pushing it.

118
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,400
Oh, I see.

119
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Alright.

120
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,900
Guys, I can't believe that was super simple.

121
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,640
That only took us way too long.

122
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,820
No, we have to stack up.

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,340
Yeah, guys.

124
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,220
Make an elevator.

125
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,000
I think it only does the other one, right?

126
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,280
We have to...

128
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,240
Nice.

129
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,120
I got the key.

130
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Why is it counting down?

131
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
Is that a bad thing?

132
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,600
No, it gives you a countdown.

133
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,540
Oh, yeah.

135
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,180
We have to...

136
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,620
We have to each...

137
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,580
We have to go to the top.

138
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:34,900
Alright.

139
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,340
You see the vision.

140
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,900
Oh, go, go, go.

141
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,580
Oh my god.

142
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,120
I don't think it works if there's people on top.

143
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,020
Yeah, there's people on top.

144
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,640
It doesn't work.

145
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,480
So we gotta...

146
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,140
I like my role of watching like a god.

147
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,400
Here we go.

148
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,600
Wee!

149
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,720
Oh, okay.

150
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,420
Nobody...

151
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,540
We have to wait for Red.

152
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,620
We have to...

153
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,860
We have to wait for Black to get to the other side.

154
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
Any day now.

155
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Any day now.

156
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, okay, okay.

157
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,980
Now we keep doing it.

158
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,340
Alright, don't worry.

159
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,460
I'll be butt-impressing.

160
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,320
Alright, we got it.

161
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,760
Wee!

162
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,080
Alright.

163
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
My favorite bit of Peek-a-Pot.

164
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,640
I'll be the last one.

165
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
I can make it.

166
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,380
Don't worry.

167
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,120
Yay!

168
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,780
We did it!

169
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,700
Okay.

170
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,440
Okay.

171
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,860
I got the key.

172
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay.

173
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,380
I got the key.

174
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,800
I don't think so.

175
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,180
We did it.

176
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,280
I blocked the door.

177
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,760
Can you imagine if someone fell right now?

178
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah, like, we're failing levels.

179
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Level 1 off the bat.

180
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,820
So we're gonna skip world 7, right?

181
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,940
Yeah, 7-3.

182
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,740
Yeah, we're gonna make it to world 7-3 so easily.

183
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,900
It has to be 7 of us.

184
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,680
Okay.

185
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,760
Who's not pushing?

186
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,140
Who's not doing their part?

187
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,060
Do your part, guys!

188
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,240
We can't...

189
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,980
What?

190
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,080
What?

191
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
Somebody died!

192
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, so, can we, like, bait that?

193
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm gonna try baiting it.

194
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,380
Okay, you can't bait it.

195
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,060
Wait, oh!

196
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,540
Yeah, the box hit it.

197
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,920
So the box has to hit it first.

198
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,640
All we have to do is not walk to the left.

199
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,780
You mean the right?

200
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,880
I mean the right.

201
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
We'll see about that.

202
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
What's the other left?

203
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,800
We need everybody to do their part.

204
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Push!

205
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,600
Push!

206
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,660
Okay, now go left.

207
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,300
Go left.

208
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,180
Push!

209
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,680
Push!

210
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,600
It's gonna hit you!

211
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,100
Push!

212
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Push!

213
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,260
Any second now!

214
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,520
Get off the box!

215
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,880
Get off the box!

216
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,420
I swear, I will...

217
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,520
I will go for it.

218
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,900
I will go for it if you do this.

219
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,900
I will go for it!

220
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,480
Are you for serious?

221
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,800
It's level 2!

222
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,700
It's level 1.

223
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,400
It's not even level 1.

224
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,920
Why are you pulling apart?

225
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm fighting!

226
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,060
I'm trying to push.

227
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,660
Push!

228
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:19,980
Push!

229
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,740
He's trying to be a manager right now.

230
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm not the one who died.

231
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,540
It was Doki.

232
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,000
Doki, come on.

233
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,380
Alright, let's go.

234
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,260
It's okay.

235
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,700
It's gonna hit that, right?

236
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
Oh, it's not?

237
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,760
What?

238
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,740
Oh, I know!

239
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
Something has to be underneath the box!

240
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,060
What if somebody was underneath the box and it hits the box itself?

241
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,680
That's a great idea.

242
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,380
Take one for the team, buddy.

243
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:45,840
Okay.

244
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,700
Yeah, they wear the box.

245
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,700
I can't hear you.

246
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,600
Wait, how do you wear it and people still push it?

247
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,540
You push the person.

248
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,680
Drop it on your head.

249
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,820
Okay, alright.

250
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Come on!

251
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,360
Go, Lime!

252
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,660
Go!

253
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,740
Go, Snuffy!

254
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,460
Go!

255
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, it works!

256
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,520
She has the helmet!

257
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,360
We are shockingly intelligent.

258
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,060
Oh my god.

259
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,980
She has the bicycle helmet.

260
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,300
Follow me.

261
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,260
Alright, nice.

262
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,780
Stop!

263
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,220
Stop!

264
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,580
Stop!

265
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,260
We need to climb up!

266
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,360
We need to stack!

267
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,940
Stack, guys!

268
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,180
It's stacking time!

269
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,560
We're stacking?

270
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,620
Teamwork?

271
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm pushing!

272
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,660
Guys!

273
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,520
The door!

274
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,380
Put it in!

275
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,660
We just have to put the key into the door.

276
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,800
The key goes into the door hole, guys.

277
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,440
What can you leave out?

278
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,000
We're doing great.

279
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,340
We're doing exactly how I thought it would go.

280
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Yeah, we got this.

281
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,820
We're so good.

282
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,880
We might be gamers.

283
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,140
We might be gamers, guys.

284
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,740
Look at that.

285
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,160
This is how...

286
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,960
This is how we build friendship, everybody.

287
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,320
Oh!

288
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,120
What's this?

289
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,100
Keep hitting it!

290
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,760
Hit it!

291
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Hit it!

292
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,260
Keep going!

293
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,580
Keep going!

294
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,980
Keep bashing your head at it!

295
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,420
Fix the problem!

296
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,900
Go!

297
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,120
Go!

298
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,360
Go!

299
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,880
Go!

300
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,920
Go!

301
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,160
Go!

302
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,540
Go!

303
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,660
I'm so smart.

304
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Keep going!

305
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,360
We can't stop!

306
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,460
Nice!

307
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:22,920
Nice!

308
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:23,980
Whoa!

309
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,800
You don't have to do it anymore.

310
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,840
I just wanted to...

311
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,600
I wanted to be part of it.

312
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,060
Yeah, that was easy.

313
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,700
Let's do it again.

314
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,420
We can't die in this fight.

315
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,400
You say that.

316
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,980
We'll find a way.

317
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,580
What if it collapses on top of us?

318
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,880
Alright.

319
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,960
We all got Brunt Force Trauma.

320
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,500
I feel like the skill jump is gonna hit us hard in level 2.

321
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,640
This seems too easy.

322
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Okay.

323
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,020
What's going on?

324
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,920
Okay.

325
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,520
As you said, the forms are moving.

326
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,500
Don't hit the jumpy jumps.

327
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,320
Don't jump.

328
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,320
Don't go over there.

329
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,300
You know you want to jump.

330
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,660
What if I go really fast?

331
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,800
There we go.

332
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,200
He just sees me as a stepping stool.

333
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:20,960
Yeah.

334
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,180
That is incredibly confusing.

335
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,260
I don't like the screen zooming out like that.

336
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,560
We each have to have a button.

337
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,540
We each have to have a button.

338
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,040
Okay.

339
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,980
I got the left side.

340
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,980
Okay.

341
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
I got this button.

342
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
The door opens there.

343
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,780
And then we have three more.

344
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,300
That little hole.

345
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
You see that little hole?

346
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,840
Just gotta climb it.

347
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,160
Yes!

348
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,300
Where's the last one?

349
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
Oh, the last one's over there.

350
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,860
To the left side.

351
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,380
And then...

352
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,200
Mint, this is your job.

353
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:58,980
Up to...

354
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,200
To knock guys?

355
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,840
Yeah.

356
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh, wait.

357
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,600
Guys, I might need some help.

358
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,140
Go back on the button.

359
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,240
Oh, thank god.

360
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,460
Okay.

361
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,060
Oh, yeah.

362
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,340
I just went through.

363
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,080
Did you just abandon us?

364
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,800
No, it's okay, guys.

365
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,620
It's okay.

366
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,580
We're all okay now.

367
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,140
Wait, what the fuck is that?

368
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,780
What is that?

369
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,020
Is it this one?

370
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
Which one was it?

371
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,100
Oh, I got you.

372
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,260
I got you.

373
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,620
Who would have...

374
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,140
Who could have done such a thing?

375
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,420
Locked down in there.

376
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,940
Who would have done such a thing?

377
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,120
It's not a game.

378
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,800
Oh, wait.

379
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,440
Wait.

380
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,780
Can you get...

381
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,780
Okay, just jump over.

382
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,920
Who's that that's lost and stuck?

383
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,140
Okay, here.

384
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,660
Just jump like this.

385
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,260
Like that.

386
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,120
I think he probably just jumped.

387
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,680
Yeah.

388
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,700
He just jumped.

389
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,740
That scared me.

390
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,240
Oh, my god.

391
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,720
I'm scared.

392
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,420
I'm scared.

393
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,440
Do you like the little projectile I made for you?

394
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,240
The analysis on how to jump?

395
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,100
Yes.

396
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,020
Just do that.

397
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,200
Come this way.

398
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,620
Sorry.

399
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,900
You should be sorry.

400
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,220
We have like a laser pointer for our cat.

401
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,320
A laser pointer to guide it.

402
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,340
Oh, my god.

403
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,600
Yay!

404
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,040
Wow!

405
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm so proud of all of you guys.

406
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm so proud of all of you guys.

407
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,540
Alright, let's show you guys how much we have.

408
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,440
We're still on pace.

409
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,420
Oh, there's a third page?

410
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,760
Oh, never mind.

411
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,680
There's a third page?

412
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,180
We should just do the last one.

413
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,220
Yeah, let's just do the last one.

414
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,460
Okay, let's see what it's like, guys.

415
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah, let's just see what it's like.

416
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,980
Yeah, let's see.

417
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,160
Oh, yeah.

418
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,600
That's not good,

419
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,520
is it?

420
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,020
Yes, come on!

421
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,280
Just go right!

422
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,200
Go, go, go, go!

423
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,160
No!

424
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,140
Okay, you guys are dead.

425
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,340
Well, maybe not everyone.

426
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,780
Guys, if we can...

427
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,680
It's always yellow.

428
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,820
What do you mean it's always yellow?

429
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,060
It's yellow!

430
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,200
What are you doing?

431
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,420
Oh, my God!

432
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
Hold down.

433
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
You need to walk in by pressing the key one time.

434
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,740
Wow, man!

435
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,600
What did I tell you?

436
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,460
What did I tell you?

437
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,320
I'm gonna get out of here.

438
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,640
Stop jumping over!

439
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,020
This is a pig issue!

440
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,220
I'm jumping over!

441
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm jumping over!

442
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Watch out, watch out!

443
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,140
We were so close.

444
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,860
I just made that.

445
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,280
If it hadn't been for you...

446
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,240
You know what I'm talking about.

447
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,900
I got all the masks.

448
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,700
Oh, my bad.

449
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,240
Please!

450
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
I went backwards.

451
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,140
Guys, if we can beat level one...

452
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,080
Guys, if we can beat level one, if we can beat this level, we can beat all the other levels, guys.

453
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
That's so true.

454
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,500
I feel like the other level users have had us for this.

455
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,020
Yay!

456
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,400
Okay.

457
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,420
We have to stack to the side, guys.

458
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,080
We have to play the game.

459
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,980
Why aren't you moving?

460
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,580
I'm trying to.

461
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm trying to.

462
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,580
We're okay, we're okay.

463
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
We have to stack.

464
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,200
The other person has to go to the left side.

465
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,800
The other person has to go to the left.

466
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,660
This is the worst level we ever have.

467
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,480
That's not even a chance.

468
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,700
Five in a row, huh?

469
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
Oh, my God.

470
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,920
It can't be that.

471
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,640
Oh, my God.

472
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,220
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

473
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,760
Oh, this way, this way, this way.

474
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,060
We figured it out.

475
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,960
We figured it out, though.

476
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,820
We figured it out.

477
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,900
Oh, my God.

478
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,800
Nobody want a hair on this level.

479
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
There can't be any delay, guys.

480
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,220
There can't be any delay.

481
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,180
We have to...

482
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,060
We have to keep going.

483
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
We can't stop.

484
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Yikes.

485
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,460
Literally, it cannot stop.

486
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,660
What are you doing?

487
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,880
What are you doing?

488
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm dying.

489
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm at the end.

490
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,140
I'm at the end.

491
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,080
I'm not sure this kind of torture was depicted in the Bible.

492
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,680
Not in a good way.

493
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,660
I have to wait for you guys.

494
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,080
I have to...

495
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,460
I must imagine Cisabeth on the other side.

496
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,000
One must imagine Cisabeth at the other side.

497
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,260
OK, we can see this.

498
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,840
I believe.

499
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,280
I believe.

500
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,640
I believe.

501
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,140
Some of you guys have to go to the right side, so we need four people on the far right.

502
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,200
And then the rest of us at the bridge, the thing.

503
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,220
Okay, there we go, I guess that's us.

504
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,060
Oh, wow!

505
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,640
Okay!

506
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,400
Okay, okay, nice, nice.

507
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,140
Wait, wait, wait.

508
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,540
Come back.

509
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,740
Is the gear come back?

510
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,800
Okay, I guess.

511
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,940
Yeah, we're going.

512
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,260
Alright, we're fine.

513
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,140
Oh, it does, it does, okay.

514
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,340
I got you, little guy.

515
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Stay there.

516
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,160
Guys, we made it.

517
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,360
We're doing it.

518
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,140
We're working together.

519
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,700
Okay, we're gonna be able to do that again.

520
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,520
Okay, that's two saws.

521
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,740
What are you doing, you fool?

522
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,540
Okay, we'll see what happens to her.

523
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,600
Okay, keep going forward.

524
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,120
Okay.

525
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,120
Okay, everything seems okay.

526
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,260
So far.

527
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,500
I think we're good.

528
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,860
No, I don't...

529
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,420
Wait, what do you mean by that?

530
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:05,860
Hey, hey.

531
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,900
What a doki hat.

532
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,540
No.

533
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,060
No, I don't deal with that.

534
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,780
I'm not.

535
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,740
This isn't for me.

536
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,100
Guys, we have to see what our death is like, guys.

537
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,260
Hold single file.

538
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,480
Hold your hand.

539
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,100
We have a buddy system.

540
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,940
We should get a buddy system right now.

541
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,740
Just in case.

542
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,600
Okay.

543
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,280
We need to see what's up ahead, Rin.

544
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,400
We need to know what's up ahead.

545
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,620
What lies ahead of us.

546
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Oh, no.

547
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,920
Oh, no.

548
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,160
Okay.

549
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,180
Okay.

550
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,320
I have an idea.

551
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay.

552
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,660
Let's just get over here.

553
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,540
Let's just get right...

554
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,600
How does it go back down?

555
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,540
I think we have to stack here.

556
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
No, no.

557
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,760
We have to run.

558
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,100
We have to run and get to the safe point.

559
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,060
No, wait.

560
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,320
It's not going to go down once we have...

561
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,660
How do we get back down?

562
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,980
Okay, so there's nothing up there.

563
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,280
Well, we let the elevator go down and then maybe like...

564
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,480
The camera would have moved if that was something up there.

565
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,660
Oh, we can't.

566
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,020
Okay, I'm sensing maybe the saws will go at a different time or something.

567
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,920
Where's the door?

568
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,940
Is it back there?

569
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,500
Where was the door?

570
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah, the door is at the very beginning.

571
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,360
Oh, it is.

572
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,440
Oh, it was.

573
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,020
We send one lone soldier.

574
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,560
One brave skull.

575
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,200
Alright.

576
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,340
Green, you're closest.

577
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,980
Green is closest.

578
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,880
Juniper is closest.

579
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,680
And we'll inch across to see how much space we can get.

580
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,220
One brave soul.

581
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
One brave soul.

582
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,940
You have to get over so we can see the key.

583
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,100
Okay, we gotta inch.

584
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,920
We gotta inch.

585
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,940
Okay, alright.

586
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,100
Oh god.

587
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,720
Okay.

588
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,100
Ready?

589
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,420
Guys.

590
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,080
Guys.

591
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,700
Guys.

592
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,120
Guys.

593
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,840
Guys.

594
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,520
Guys.

595
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,140
Guys.

596
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:20,540
Guys.

597
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:20,760
Guys.

598
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,180
We're

599
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
doing so good.

600
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,260
We found it.

601
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,720
I still don't really know how to do the thing.

602
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,500
I think it's one at a time.

603
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,680
Single file.

604
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,080
Yeah.

605
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,620
Single file.

606
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,440
It was literally single file.

607
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,720
Which is what I was trying to say.

608
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,960
You need to like jump single file.

609
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,400
As little as possible.

610
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,580
Oh my god.

611
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,660
It feels like we're in kindergarten and Lime's the teacher.

612
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,460
Alright.

613
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,820
Mama.

614
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,400
Don't do that.

615
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,040
Please.

616
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,480
Oh my god.

617
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,260
Please.

618
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,160
Go ahead.

619
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,340
Oh my god.

620
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,340
I don't piss myself.

621
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,600
That was almost impressive.

622
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,740
Alright.

623
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,940
I'll jump over you.

624
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Any day now guys.

625
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Any day now.

626
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,540
You're too slow.

627
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,740
Jump over you.

628
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,420
You're too slow.

629
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,960
I'll do it.

630
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,180
Alright.

631
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,880
We got this.

632
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,860
We got this.

633
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,620
Nice.

634
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,820
And then we can...

635
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,000
Your big head is in the way.

636
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,900
Nice.

637
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,400
Alright.

638
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm okay.

639
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:34,820
I'm okay.

640
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:34,980
I'm okay.

641
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,280
Everything is fine.

642
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,040
See?

643
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
Everything is fine.

644
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Alright.

645
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,600
And then...

646
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,440
The lone soul.

647
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,940
A single soldier.

648
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,560
Just me.

649
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,300
Alright.

650
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,480
Chungus World.

651
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,180
Okay.

652
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,600
We should all make like a single line.

653
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,020
No one on top of each other's head.

654
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,220
Let's do a test run.

655
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,060
Like imagine we have the key.

656
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,560
Sure.

657
00:20:59,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Oh yes.

658
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,160
Yeah.

659
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,820
Alright.

660
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,580
I'm going to do it.

661
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,300
Okay.

662
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,560
I failed.

663
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,720
You gotta jump.

664
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,540
You gotta do this.

665
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,060
You have to jump.

666
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,000
You have to wait until it's at the very bottom to.

667
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:12,980
Wait.

668
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,000
Can you jump and then it goes down a little bit?

669
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,660
Is that?

670
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,160
Yeah.

671
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,380
Yeah.

672
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,500
Yeah.

673
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,860
Look at that!

674
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,380
We're ready!

675
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,240
We got this!

676
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,920
We got this!

677
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,640
We have the mechanics now.

678
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,700
The first one also needs a couple of people.

679
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,640
Can this squish someone?

680
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,560
No, no.

681
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,960
You get to lose.

682
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,660
Sacrifice yourself to find out.

683
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,820
It's for science!

684
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,460
For science!

685
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,220
She just loves playing this game guys.

686
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you ready?

687
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,780
I think we can see more.

688
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,080
Go!

689
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,680
Go!

690
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,240
Go!

691
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,420
Go!

692
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,520
Go!

693
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:49,600
Go!

694
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,420
Bring the key higher!

695
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Bring the key higher up or we'll be fucked over by the...

696
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,680
the thing.

697
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,680
The key won't move.

698
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,940
The key won't move.

699
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,600
Oh, you can pass it.

700
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

701
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,880
I'm passing it.

702
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,260
Okay, I'll pass it to you.

703
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,380
Okay, I guess not.

704
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,820
We gotta be patient.

705
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,580
We gotta be patient.

706
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,340
Please, we have the key.

707
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,760
The person ahead has to have the key!

708
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,220
No, I don't want it to be me!

709
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,840
I don't have the key.

710
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,820
Alright, go.

711
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,480
You have the key.

712
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,680
Alright, you go.

713
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,540
I don't want the key.

714
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,120
Whose phone?

715
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,200
Okay.

716
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,580
I'm gonna wait for the thing.

717
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,260
I'm scared.

718
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,260
Go!

719
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,360
Go!

720
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,200
Okay.

721
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,380
Three, two, one, go!

722
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,420
How do I?

723
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,200
Okay, that's okay.

724
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,380
Now!

725
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,360
Yay!

726
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,140
Now you guys can do it.

727
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,720
Careful.

728
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,400
Don't panic.

729
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,780
Careful.

730
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,380
Nice.

731
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,560
Be patient.

732
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,560
Careful, SpongeBob.

733
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,420
Careful, SpongeBob.

734
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm scared.

735
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,580
Please, we don't wanna do this again.

736
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,540
You don't have a choice.

737
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,580
I wanna master this level.

738
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,980
Let's do it one more time.

739
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,020
Let's get a speedrun, guys.

740
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,620
Let's run faster for sure.

741
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah, we could really honestly be faster.

742
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,800
We could actually be on speedrun.com, guys.

743
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,360
If we, like, perfect the time.

744
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,280
Oh my god.

745
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,340
Oh my god.

746
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm back!

747
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,780
My own wish came true, it seems.

748
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,860
I'm back!

749
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,300
You got your wish, Randy.

750
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,960
There's actually no way.

751
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,080
We were basically done.

752
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,580
Why did you run back?

753
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,920
Why did you run back?

754
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,900
I will jump over your head.

755
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,640
I will jump over your head.

756
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
This is insane.

757
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,040
Run for your life.

758
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I can't get over there.

759
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,720
I can't get over there.

760
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:16,780
Oh no.

761
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,220
Let's go!

762
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,220
Let's go!

763
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Oh god.

764
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,880
I think we've learned from this that we would all be the first to die in a horror movie.

765
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,060
Hey, hey, hey.

766
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,660
What do you mean?

767
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,020
What do you mean?

768
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

769
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,060
Oh man.

770
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,260
Oh god.

771
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,440
It's okay.

772
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,620
Everything is fine.

773
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,780
We'll just leave Rin down there.

774
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,060
Woah, woah, woah.

775
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,680
Woah, woah, woah.

776
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,340
Woah, woah, woah.

777
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,900
It's all up to you.

778
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,780
Try again.

779
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,860
I don't want to try again.

780
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,560
Wait, so who's white?

781
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh my god, it was all Malik.

782
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,100
Alright.

783
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,900
We got this.

784
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,860
It's okay.

785
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
We'll get the world record now.

786
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,360
That's a funny one.

788
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,360
You guys can actually go up more than one by one.

789
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,820
Yeah.

790
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,080
Okay.

791
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,200
Alright.

792
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
We shimmy until we head...

793
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,080
Okay, there we go.

794
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,920
Let's go.

795
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,860
Single file line.

796
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,560
Remember guys.

797
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,840
Sorry.

798
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,900
Why are you saying sorry?

799
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm sorry little one.

800
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,000
Go, go, go.

801
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,200
I can't wait.

802
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,540
I have to wait to see.

803
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,340
Okay.

804
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,100
Oh my god.

805
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,880
Okay, can't.

806
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,680
Oh my god.

807
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,160
I didn't have to wait for a guy.

808
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,800
I could just move.

809
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,180
I'm

810
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:51,980
fast.

811
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,360
Alright.

812
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,300
Nice.

813
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:57,700
I'm ahead.

814
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,020
Oh my god.

815
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,500
Oh my god.

816
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,180
Oh my god.

817
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,620
Oh my god.

818
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh my god.

819
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,500
Oh my god.

820
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,640
I think you're like wall hacking.

821
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,560
Hey guys.

822
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,260
Hi.

823
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,120
You're doing so bad.

824
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,000
It doesn't matter.

825
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm done already.

826
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,920
I'm stuck.

827
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,940
I'm stuck.

828
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,500
I'm not letting you jump past me.

829
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,220
We gotta work together.

830
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,340
We're so bad.

831
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,220
This is the run.

832
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,860
That was good.

833
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,040
This is the run guys.

834
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,440
This is it.

835
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,860
I'll walk over so you guys can...

836
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,420
Okay.

837
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,980
That's a good plan.

838
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,600
That's a good plan.

839
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,980
Okay.

840
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,560
Okay.

841
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,720
You just gotta get there.

842
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,500
You just gotta get there.

843
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,380
Just get up here guys.

844
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,920
Can't be that bad.

845
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,460
Guys it's right here.

846
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,280
Can't be that bad.

847
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,160
You know what you're saying.

848
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,040
We can do this.

849
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,740
Alright.

850
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,840
I don't want to be in front anymore.

851
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,840
Stop pushing me.

852
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,600
Okay guys.

853
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,980
We can't be on top of each other.

854
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm not touching you.

855
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,760
You're touching my aura.

856
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,660
Be ready.

857
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,160
Uh oh.

858
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,260
Go go go.

859
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,940
Two can be at the same time.

860
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,600
Guys.

861
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,260
Guys.

862
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,720
Guys.

863
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,080
It's on fire.

864
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,880
Okay.

865
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,940
I think you just don't understand the mechanics.

866
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
It's on fire.

867
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,460
It's on fire.

868
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,040
What happened?

869
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,260
What happened?

870
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,760
You have to jump.

871
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,260
If it starts moving up you jump.

872
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,740
And it'll go back down even faster.

873
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,780
You're trying to leave.

874
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,560
I am but there are people all the way to me.

875
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,820
How do you do that?

876
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,400
Oh then you have to stop dying.

877
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,120
We die!

878
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,660
No that's not true.

879
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,840
That's not true.

880
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,840
That's not true.

881
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,460
How?

882
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,820
How?

883
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,500
Stop slapping the...

884
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,200
Oh sorry.

885
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,060
The on your peak game for Pico Park.

886
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,980
It starts so...

887
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,040
Ever since the grey incident It's never been the same.

888
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
Our motivation is gone.

889
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,680
Like my will to live.

890
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,140
Okay, here we go.

891
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,260
The jumping will not work if there's tons of you on the platform.

892
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,260
Because you would all have to jump at exactly the same time.

893
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,880
So try not to stack.

894
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah, we got it right the first time.

895
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,220
What happened to us?

896
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,080
It happened.

897
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,300
Which last time?

898
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,980
And then greed happened.

899
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,280
We're becoming masters of this level.

900
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,120
It's fine.

901
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,020
That's not something to be proud of.

902
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,520
We're going to be so good for the next one.

903
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,440
Yeah, we're going to be so good at chapter 2.

904
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,040
If we beat chapter 15 with like zero knowledge, we got this.

905
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:03,880
If we beat chapter 15 with like zero knowledge, we got this.

906
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,200
Okay.

907
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,980
Someone do an example just to make sure we know what to do at this point.

908
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,260
Someone do an example just to make sure we know what to do at this point.

909
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,580
Alright guys, let's practice.

910
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,100
Alright, here we go.

911
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,600
We're practicing.

912
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,500
Your turn.

913
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,800
Your turn.

914
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,420
One at a time.

915
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,660
Okay.

916
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Guys.

917
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,460
Guys.

918
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,100
Lime would have been dead already, guys.

919
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,700
Lime would have been dead.

920
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,300
I feel like we have to have a drill sergeant.

921
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,660
Okay, alright, alright.

922
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,080
This is a fire drill.

923
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,020
Yeah, children, this is a fire drill.

924
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,440
Okay?

925
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,220
Imagine if there's a fire, alright?

926
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,280
Now what do we do?

927
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,280
We practice again?

928
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,920
Okay, this is the run.

929
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,160
This is the run.

930
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,800
There's a fire.

931
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,640
There's a fire.

932
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,600
It's life or death.

933
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,620
Guys.

934
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,720
Guys.

935
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,280
Guys.

936
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay.

937
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
Alright, get the key closed.

938
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,520
The first person has to unlock the door.

939
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,260
I don't want to be up here.

940
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,680
Okay.

941
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,040
Guys.

942
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,500
Guys.

943
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,040
Guys, please.

944
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,500
There's a green goblin on my head.

945
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,640
Okay.

946
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,520
You're unlocking.

947
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:20,920
Alright.

948
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,400
Oh no.

949
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
Go to the fire.

950
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,440
Okay.

951
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,300
Alright, Min.

952
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,920
It's up to you.

953
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,160
I'm waiting for it.

954
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm waiting for it.

955
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,280
Okay.

956
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,580
Don't answer the call of the void.

957
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,000
Alright.

958
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,320
Nice.

959
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,100
Okay.

960
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,860
We can do it now.

961
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,160
Alright.

962
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,460
Let's go back.

963
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Okay.

964
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,320
I don't think we should...

965
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,740
I don't think we should risk that.

966
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:43,980
Wait.

967
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,260
Wait.

968
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,440
Wait.

969
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,020
Wait till it goes back.

970
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,920
Oh, nice.

971
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,360
Nice.

972
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,620
Nice.

973
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:47,880
Nice.

974
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,060
Nice.

975
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,580
Okay.

976
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,340
I'll go first.

977
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,280
Okay.

978
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,940
Slow and steady.

979
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,860
Amelie, you go next.

980
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,220
Amelie, you go next.

981
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Okay.

982
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,460
Okay.

983
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,580
Now we should be good.

984
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,660
Now we should be good.

985
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,860
Okay.

986
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,920
Let's have that thing.

987
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,560
Go back up and down.

988
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,260
Go back up and down.

989
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,820
No!

990
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,960
Okay.

991
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,320
Nice.

992
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,560
Nice.

993
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,020
Okay.

994
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:14,940
Nice.

995
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,300
Okay.

996
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,300
Nice!

997
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,880
Yeah!

998
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,200
Yeah!

999
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,080
We are finally on schedule.

1000
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,160
Oh my god.

1001
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,940
We did it.

1002
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,380
Oh my god.

1003
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,840
I held my breath.

1004
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,880
I feel like that is...

1005
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,240
How do I get out of...

1006
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,820
How do I get out of 15?

1007
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,720
Don't you go back there.

1008
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,260
Okay.

1009
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,480
Now...

1010
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,140
Let's learn the game.

1011
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,860
Let's learn the game, guys.

1012
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,240
Now why were we on level 15?

1013
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh no.

1014
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,420
What is this?

1015
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh, it hurts.

1016
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,640
It can kill us.

1017
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,540
Guys, guys, please!

1018
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
Oh, I see.

1019
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,840
Please.

1020
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,880
Just don't die.

1021
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,700
Okay, you guys.

1022
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,680
Guys, we jump over it.

1023
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,880
We can jump over it.

1024
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Just don't let it hit you.

1025
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,600
Guys, Bailey.

1026
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,880
It's like those kindergarten leashes, guys.

1027
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,660
You can stand on it.

1028
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,960
You can stand on it.

1029
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,460
Yes, you can stand on it.

1030
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,080
Look at me stand.

1031
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,280
I see.

1032
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,340
It's the velocity that got you.

1033
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,420
I was doing my bad part.

1034
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,280
Alright.

1035
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:16,880
Apologies.

1036
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,520
Okay, the order changes every time.

1037
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,620
Oh, it's pushing me.

1038
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,100
I wasn't even pressing my key.

1039
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,180
The order changes every time, guys.

1040
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,260
Okay.

1041
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,800
Alright.

1042
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,460
I can't jump if you're on my head.

1043
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,140
Now who could that be?

1044
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,180
Something about a chunky butt.

1045
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,440
Okay.

1046
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,580
Okay, dice.

1047
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,000
Alright, let's go.

1048
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,600
Oh, no.

1049
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,280
We're tangled.

1050
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,100
We are tangled.

1051
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,260
Okay, so.

1052
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
We have to stack.

1053
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,480
Doki, doki, swap with me.

1054
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,680
Oh, I see.

1055
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,160
Okay.

1056
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,380
Okay, stacking time.

1057
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,020
Will you drag us all with us?

1058
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,560
Yes, I have no idea.

1059
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,860
I think so.

1060
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,120
I mean like...

1061
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,680
Like, okay, we need you to get up.

1062
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,860
I can't move!

1063
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,680
I can't move!

1064
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,940
I actually can't stop letting you!

1065
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,820
Oh, there we go.

1066
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,120
There we go.

1067
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,360
Don't push me off the edge!

1068
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,040
Okay, okay.

1069
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,380
Mr. Purple, can you...

1070
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,860
I don't feel so good about this.

1071
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,760
I can't move now either.

1072
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,360
Okay.

1073
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,400
And then...

1074
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,940
Oh, okay!

1075
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:29,880
Okay!

1076
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,500
And then...

1077
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,100
Pink just needs to jump over.

1078
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,200
And then...

1079
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,720
Okay, okay.

1080
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,300
And then you drag the purple...

1081
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,760
Yes!

1082
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,460
We did it!

1083
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,820
Oh, we have to do that again.

1084
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,240
Where am I supposed to be?

1085
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,840
Okay, we must lower you off the side.

1086
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,240
Alright, it's a tug of war.

1087
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,220
Nobody dies!

1088
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,620
Okay, let's all just jump off.

1089
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,640
Let's all just jump off.

1090
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,140
And then we'll just lower you down.

1091
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,060
And what order are we in?

1092
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,840
Okay.

1093
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
We should untangle real quick.

1094
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,020
I am here.

1095
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,680
I can't tell at all.

1096
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,780
Okay, there we go.

1097
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,820
How do we do this?

1098
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Oh, we have to stack maybe again?

1099
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,720
I think that's just a jump.

1100
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
I think you jump.

1101
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,820
Why would they do that if it weren't for the level design?

1102
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,120
Maybe.

1103
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,040
Okay.

1104
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,680
Oh, we lost the key.

1105
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,020
Okay.

1106
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,920
Oh, I got it!

1107
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,580
Okay.

1108
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,800
Let's try again.

1109
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,340
Oh no, we have to be untangled.

1110
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,300
Okay, what is...

1111
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,080
This is so romantic.

1112
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,120
What if like...

1113
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,340
What if like two or three of us jump at the same time?

1114
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,080
Oh, true, true.

1115
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,700
Two of you guys jump.

1117
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,340
We should untangle before we do that.

1118
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,220
Okay.

1119
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,360
I am here.

1120
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,240
Purple is next to me.

1121
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,940
Red is next to me.

1122
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,820
Oh my god.

1123
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,540
How did you guys get tangled like that?

1124
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,620
You guys are not even...

1125
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,660
I'm so stressed.

1126
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,320
I don't know actually.

1127
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,480
We're doing a star.

1128
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,040
I'm supposed to be over here.

1129
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,860
I'm supposed to be over here.

1130
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,120
What's she wearing?

1131
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,300
Okay.

1132
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,020
You are still tangled.

1133
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,980
There's some double looping going on on that rope.

1134
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm pretty sure.

1135
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,960
No, I think it's fine.

1136
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,000
I think it's just graphic.

1137
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,460
Okay.

1138
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,160
Okay.

1139
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:29,460
Okay.

1140
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,280
I think you guys have to jump off of my head for this.

1141
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,000
Eight, four, and six have to jump together.

1142
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,700
Yeah.

1143
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,760
We should get closer so that they don't get pulled back.

1144
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,240
Yeah, right here.

1145
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,220
Okay.

1146
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,720
Alright.

1147
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,700
Okay.

1148
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,160
We did it.

1149
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,240
We need to pull these cats up.

1150
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,600
Help.

1151
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,380
Here we go.

1152
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,420
Okay.

1153
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,340
Okay.

1154
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,580
Now what?

1155
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,800
Untangle.

1156
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,660
Alright.

1157
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,260
How come it's always the tail end that's tangled up like that?

1158
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,640
How come?

1159
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,700
What are you guys doing?

1160
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,040
We're fine over here.

1161
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,100
We don't have problems.

1162
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,420
Yeah, we're here.

1163
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,800
It's not me, man.

1164
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,220
Why are you guys tangling up even more?

1165
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,420
Guys, why are you guys tangling up even more?

1166
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,640
You guys untangled and then tangled yourself again.

1167
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:30,800
Okay, fine.

1168
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,260
If you're so perfect over here, then why don't you be a little bit more tangled, okay?

1169
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,500
Yeah, yeah.

1170
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,260
You saw them.

1171
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,760
Yeah.

1172
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,040
This wasn't for you.

1173
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1174
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,360
Alright, fine.

1175
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,880
Let's swap.

1176
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,620
Let's swap places.

1177
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,580
We'll swap places.

1178
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,600
The back will be in the front.

1179
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,440
Let's go.

1180
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,500
The back will be in front.

1181
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,740
Go back.

1182
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,260
Go.

1183
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,420
We can do this.

1184
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,560
This is just like the rubber bands.

1185
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,100
Guys, where are you guys?

1186
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,900
Guys, guys.

1187
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,300
No, no, no.

1188
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,540
Trust.

1189
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:58,840
Trust.

1190
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,040
Okay.

1191
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,280
We should just jump so we can be untangled.

1192
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,000
We should just jump so we can be untangled.

1193
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,980
If we jump, we lose our key.

1194
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,220
If we jump, we lose our key.

1195
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,180
Okay, alright.

1196
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,140
Okay, let's just get these guys out here first.

1197
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,680
Okay.

1198
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,640
Alright.

1199
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,020
Okay, we're just gonna jump.

1200
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,740
Alright, let's just do a jump.

1201
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,600
Let's just jump.

1202
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,360
It's fine.

1203
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,060
It's fine.

1204
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,580
It's not gonna work.

1205
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,680
Holy shit.

1206
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,680
What is this?

1207
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,800
If we make a staircase and then we have someone fall into the gap.

1208
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,260
Yes, I have a suggestion.

1209
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,700
Without tangling, we do need to make a staircase and have someone on the end then jump off.

1210
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,800
Okay.

1211
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,820
Not like that.

1212
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,160
Guys, I got pushed.

1213
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,340
I got pushed, guys.

1214
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,760
Somebody pushed me.

1215
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,960
Okay, so this way we need to have in reverse order, so someone needs to be on doki that is between...

1216
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Someone needs to be under doki.

1217
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,980
Yeah, purple under doki.

1218
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,520
Okay, like that.

1219
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,440
There you go.

1220
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,240
So if you get to the edge, and then I jump, that will hopefully be enough.

1221
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:08,760
Maybe.

1222
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,180
Alright, nice.

1223
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,060
Oh, Steve, look at that!

1224
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,920
The backend figured it out!

1225
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,320
Look at that!

1226
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,010
The backend figured it out, guys.

1227
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,950
Big brain.

1228
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,890
Okay, we have to...

1229
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,190
At least we can't die here.

1230
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,530
Okay, guys, guys.

1231
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,910
We need at least a couple of us to pull the others off.

1232
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,930
The people on the bottom of the stack need to walk off at the same time.

1233
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,130
Alright.

1234
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,050
So we need to all stack into a big group.

1235
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,050
Like a huge group.

1236
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,150
Alright, guys.

1237
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,970
And then we need to walk off at the same time.

1238
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,930
So true.

1239
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,530
Um...

1240
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,310
Okay, blue and red, you walk off and I can jump.

1241
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,870
Oh, okay.

1242
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,150
Okay.

1243
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,170
Alright.

1244
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,930
I believe!

1245
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:04,790
I believe!

1246
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,850
Push!

1247
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,410
I shouldn't have had those toddlers.

1248
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,310
Okay, okay, okay.

1249
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:11,850
Guys, guys.

1250
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,050
We don't have to move, guys.

1251
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,310
Just stay still.

1252
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,990
Everybody stay still.

1253
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,710
I need...

1254
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,530
I need you to touch the wall.

1255
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,270
I need you to touch the wall.

1256
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:21,730
Okay.

1257
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,210
Okay.

1258
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,610
Alright.

1259
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,450
And then...

1260
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,030
Okay, okay.

1261
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,630
No, no, no, no.

1262
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,870
Rin, stay on top.

1263
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,230
Okay.

1264
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,470
And then Snuffy... Oh, no.

1265
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,070
I don't think I can.

1266
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,570
No, Snuffy has to move.

1267
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1268
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,490
And then I can jump.

1269
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,630
And then we all move.

1270
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,130
There we go!

1271
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,850
Oh my gosh, I literally got carried away.

1272
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,950
This whole time.

1273
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,610
Yay!

1274
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,550
Yay!

1275
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,430
Our one brain cell, Lime, is working overtime right now.

1276
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,030
Okay, don't...

1277
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,510
Don't touch me!

1278
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,850
Oh my gosh, we have a health bar.

1279
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,410
Okay.

1280
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,530
We were basically dead.

1281
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,410
We have one HP!

1282
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,330
Guys, let's do it.

1283
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,510
I'm okay.

1284
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,310
We have so much HP.

1285
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,930
Someone get on here, but don't touch me.

1286
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,990
Guys, six feet, guys.

1287
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,670
Six feet.

1288
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,750
Guys, guys, guys.

1289
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,010
Guys, I don't want it.

1290
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,030
Guys, please.

1291
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,750
This is slippery.

1292
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:31,810
Slippery.

1293
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,230
Slippery.

1294
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,610
There's ice up there.

1295
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:37,910
It's ice.

1296
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,950
Oh, it's ice.

1297
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,030
Doki, don't touch me.

1298
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,330
Don't touch me, Doki!

1299
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,350
I'm not even moving!

1300
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,750
Yes, you are!

1301
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,130
You're moving towards me!

1302
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,930
I just break -checked you, Doki!

1303
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,370
I just break-checked you!

1304
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,250
No, no, don't touch me, though.

1305
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1306
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,490
Stop!

1307
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:57,670
Stop!

1308
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,410
Stop!

1309
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,950
It's hot enough!

1310
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:04,970
Go!

1311
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:05,790
Alright, go!

1312
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,710
Sorry, it's ice.

1313
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,310
Be careful.

1314
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,070
Sorry!

1315
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:11,990
Okay.

1316
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,370
Oh, wait.

1317
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,050
Oh, shit.

1318
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,110
I was trying to go back for you.

1319
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,650
Okay, you first.

1320
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,170
You first.

1321
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,170
What does this do?

1322
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,430
Why are you sliding it into each other?

1323
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,310
Scoot along a bit further.

1324
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:31,090
Well, I need you to scoot so I can go... No, I need you to... Okay, well, I guess that worked out.

1325
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,110
Nobody touch me!

1326
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,990
Nobody touch me!

1327
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:41,450
Don't touch!

1328
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,250
Well...

1329
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,970
Oh, sorry!

1330
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,550
Oh, hey, we didn't touch, though.

1331
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,930
I think you did, because...

1332
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,470
Oh, oh!

1333
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,610
That was our fault.

1334
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,470
There we go.

1335
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:56,210
There we go.

1336
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,230
I'm not afraid to use it.

1337
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,210
Try not to jump off early if you're on the right, because you leave your friend behind.

1338
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:01,790
There we go.

1339
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,170
Oh, whoa!

1340
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,790
Slip and slide there.

1341
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,110
Uh, uh, uh.

1342
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,070
Guys, just...

1343
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,890
Yeah, yeah, just do a little jump.

1344
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,010
Just do a little jump.

1345
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,570
Okay.

1346
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,430
There we go, there we go.

1347
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,590
Okay, and then we jump at the same time.

1348
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,210
Okay, oh, that's...

1349
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:22,870
Oh, sorry.

1350
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,350
Um, I know what those words mean.

1351
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,850
Okay, three, two, one...

1352
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,470
Jump!

1353
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,070
Oh, no, no, we're fine.

1354
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:34,950
Everything's fine.

1355
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,730
Okay, we each get a button, I guess?

1356
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,930
Yeah, I think so.

1357
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,670
Why are you always looking back at me?

1358
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:41,870
Gentle, gentle.

1359
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,290
Gentle, gentle.

1360
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:43,670
Stop.

1361
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,530
I'm looking at you.

1362
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,870
Stop looking at me.

1363
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,530
Stop looking at me.

1364
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,070
Okay, okay, nice.

1365
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,870
We just won.

1366
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,230
Okay, I just got a...

1367
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,170
Oh, my gosh, you look so crazy.

1368
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,350
All right.

1369
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,290
I'm doing my part.

1370
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,010
Don't touch me!

1371
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,090
I'm not even pressing anything.

1372
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,450
Yeah, me too.

1373
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,010
I'm just lying.

1374
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,010
Oh, okay, never mind.

1375
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:06,530
I'm just lying.

1376
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,630
Oh, it doesn't kill you.

1377
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:08,990
That's so good.

1378
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:09,570
Oh, that's so good.

1379
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,030
That's so good.

1380
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,870
My apologies.

1381
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,130
It doesn't kill you.

1382
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,550
That's just the way.

1383
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,030
Wait, I twirl.

1384
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,110
Oh, my gosh.

1385
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:30,790
That's just the way.

1386
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,010
Yippee!

1387
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,110
Yay!

1388
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,270
Ah, yes.

1389
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,170
I'm sweating.

1390
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,890
I'm almost done with the game.

1391
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,510
My palms are moist.

1392
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,710
Oh, it's the...

1393
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,670
You know what I want to hear in this game?

1394
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,930
Oh, it's this again.

1395
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,350
Look, there's fireworks.

1396
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,550
Oh, we can touch again.

1397
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,450
Yeah.

1398
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,550
I'mma go back.

1399
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,170
I can't.

1400
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,850
That's exactly where I was.

1401
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:02,390
There we go.

1402
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,470
Easy peasy.

1403
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,570
Are we doing the same thing?

1404
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,470
Oh, I think we're in the sack.

1405
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,830
Snuffy, is this you?

1406
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,890
Snuffy, am I touching you right now?

1407
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,670
I'm the pink one.

1408
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,330
Oh, you're even more pink.

1409
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,850
Wait, who am I touching?

1410
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,170
That's Rin.

1411
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,830
Oh, hi, Rin.

1412
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,550
Hi, Rin.

1413
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,970
Okay, and then I'm up here.

1414
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,590
Good.

1415
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,010
You gotta jump with us.

1416
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:24,730
Yeah, jump.

1417
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,770
Okay, and then...

1418
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,990
Just don't kick us down.

1419
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,230
Okay.

1420
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,650
All right.

1421
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,730
Let's reverse it.

1422
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,470
All right.

1423
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,650
Back of the line, everybody.

1424
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,670
Back.

1425
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,130
Okay.

1426
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:43,910
All right.

1427
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:44,970
Okay, okay.

1428
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,950
I was a little too eager.

1429
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:47,350
I'm sorry.

1430
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:48,430
All right.

1431
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,470
Here we go again.

1432
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:50,910
We've all been there.

1433
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:51,690
Okay.

1434
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,270
Ready for the release.

1435
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,290
I'm sorry.

1436
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,830
Don't fall down the hall.

1437
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,710
Don't fall down.

1438
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,890
I'm giving us more room.

1439
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,090
If you don't make it, we all die.

1440
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:02,470
Do a play.

1441
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,350
Oh, what?

1442
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,090
What?

1443
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:10,310
It punched me backwards.

1444
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,030
I don't know what to do.

1445
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,390
Three of us have to jump over.

1446
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,890
I think a few of us have to jump at the same time.

1447
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:18,290
I think a few of us have to jump at the same time.

1448
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,150
All right.

1449
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:19,870
Here we go.

1450
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:20,630
Guys.

1451
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,850
What the fuck am I looking at here?

1452
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,210
All right.

1453
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,610
I think we gotta untangle first.

1454
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,970
I am supposed to be not here.

1455
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,630
Red.

1456
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:30,590
Green.

1457
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,470
Oh my god, please.

1458
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:38,490
We were almost.

1459
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,870
Okay.

1460
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,370
There we go.

1461
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,050
We did it.

1462
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:40,950
Okay.

1463
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,710
No, no, no.

1464
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,330
Okay.

1465
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,470
All right.

1466
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,910
Here we go.

1467
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,150
All right.

1468
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,190
This is it.

1469
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:49,990
One more time.

1470
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,910
Surely this time.

1471
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,250
This is it.

1472
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,070
Gray, orange, and green should all go?

1473
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,730
No, I think gray goes first.

1474
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,810
Gray walks off, maybe.

1475
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,810
Three, two, one.

1476
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,110
Who's going?

1477
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:04,810
Go.

1478
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,790
Why did we all go?

1479
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,930
Why did we all walk?

1480
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,650
That was so close.

1481
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,050
Why did we all walk forward?

1482
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,730
I think everyone does need to be going.

1483
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,030
Yeah.

1484
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,190
Okay.

1485
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,790
No, no.

1486
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,470
I don't think everybody.

1487
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,530
I think it has to be like the top four walk off and then...

1488
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,450
There's enough weight on the other side.

1489
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,370
It's definitely one on one person.

1490
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,390
I think we need three people to pull the rest of us across.

1491
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1492
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:35,770
All right.

1493
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:36,230
I believe.

1494
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,210
I'm losing my fucking mind at this music right now.

1495
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,630
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1496
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,630
Just remember Pico Park was worse.

1497
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:42,150
I'm sorry.

1498
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,150
I'm sorry.

1499
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,010
Normally, so I kind of like it.

1500
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:47,590
I'm at peace.

1501
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,290
Okay.

1502
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,930
Somebody is not where they're supposed to be.

1503
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,750
I should be in the back or the front, I guess.

1504
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,230
The two ends are at the same end.

1505
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:56,910
Yeah.

1506
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:57,490
All right.

1507
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,430
Okay.

1508
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,210
Now this is a lot more tangled.

1509
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:01,650
Okay.

1510
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,330
Here we go.

1511
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,190
Okay.

1512
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,070
This is it.

1513
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:05,750
There we go.

1514
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:05,970
Okay.

1515
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,210
Purple, then red, then yellow.

1516
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:07,430
Yeah.

1517
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,750
All right.

1518
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,130
Now we climb.

1519
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,850
I cannot move.

1520
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,090
I cannot allow you in.

1521
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,370
Now we climb.

1522
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:13,210
There we go.

1523
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1524
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,210
Climb the mountain.

1525
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,250
Climb up.

1526
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:18,590
Climb up.

1527
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:19,550
Your friends more.

1528
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,790
All right.

1529
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:21,310
There you go.

1530
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:21,710
Okay.

1531
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,590
Look at how much room you have.

1532
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,210
Okay.

1533
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,650
You can't miss.

1534
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,870
You literally can't miss.

1535
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,330
It's right there.

1536
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,310
Just walk.

1537
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,370
Just walk.

1538
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,030
Okay.

1539
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:37,590
Right.

1540
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,350
There you go.

1541
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,810
No, no, no.

1542
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:43,570
We're done.

1543
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,250
Why did that happen?

1544
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,190
I'm happy.

1545
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,430
You don't know how to keep walking forward.

1546
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:50,990
I'm going to be sick.

1547
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,290
Who stopped walking?

1548
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:54,750
What?

1549
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,990
You stopped.

1550
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,730
Oh, Christ.

1551
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,790
Somebody's hand was off the keyboard.

1552
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:05,970
Oh, dear.

1553
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,250
We all got to pull our parts.

1554
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:09,770
Okay.

1555
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,790
Stack, stack, stack.

1556
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:11,170
Okay.

1557
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,810
Stack time.

1558
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,770
Who do we stack on?

1559
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,310
Stack, stack, stack.

1560
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:14,650
Okay.

1561
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,170
Stack time.

1562
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,730
Stack, stack.

1563
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,470
Holy shit.

1564
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,390
Okay.

1565
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:19,990
All right.

1566
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:20,690
Okay.

1567
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,450
Boo, you can't.

1568
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,330
Oh, okay.

1569
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,310
Oh, there we go.

1570
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:24,550
There we go.

1571
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,730
Okay.

1572
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,470
Right.

1573
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,710
A little bit more, too.

1574
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,110
Okay.

1575
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:28,850
Okay.

1576
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,150
There's no way we can't.

1577
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,050
One.

1578
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,490
Go, go, go.

1579
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,010
Just one.

1580
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:36,490
Just one.

1581
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:37,670
Go back.

1582
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:38,690
No.

1583
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,420
That's been a miscommunication.

1584
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,620
Okay.

1585
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,600
Two to three.

1586
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,000
That's there.

1587
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,220
In order, I guess.

1588
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,380
In order.

1589
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,600
In order.

1590
00:48:59,600 --> 00:48:59,880
Okay.

1591
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,080
We figured it out.

1592
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,780
We figured it out.

1593
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:04,780
Wait.

1594
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,820
I'm behind you.

1595
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,260
Three.

1596
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,580
All right.

1597
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,440
Here we go.

1598
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,120
Four.

1599
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,620
We need this.

1600
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,240
We need this.

1601
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,620
It has to be like this.

1602
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,480
It has to be like this.

1603
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,640
You don't jump.

1604
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
I can't jump.

1605
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,880
I can't jump.

1606
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:24,740
Pull her back.

1607
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,620
Pull her back.

1608
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,140
Okay.

1609
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,660
Only one person needs to...

1610
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,020
Okay.

1611
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,460
That's too far.

1612
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,280
Okay.

1613
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,200
Now we bring...

1614
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,460
Okay.

1615
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,940
Now...

1616
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,460
You just jump.

1617
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,760
You just gotta jump.

1618
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,980
I am trying to jump, but the weight is fucking me up.

1619
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,220
Are you sure it shouldn't be the person on the end?

1620
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,260
Oh, Rin.

1621
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,420
You might be a little bit too heavy, Rin.

1622
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,100
Help me.

1623
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,200
Help me.

1624
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,020
Oh, I know.

1625
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,280
I know.

1626
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,680
We have to...

1627
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,100
One has to be tangled.

1628
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,060
One has to be tangled.

1629
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,420
Maybe.

1630
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,600
Oh, Deska.

1631
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,080
I think it's just the dangle, right?

1632
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,240
And then the next person goes.

1633
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,080
Yeah, I think just someone at the end, maybe.

1634
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,460
Because then we can easily pull them up.

1635
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,340
Probably.

1636
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,480
I feel like there should be someone in the middle, no?

1637
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,100
Because I cannot see... What's the puzzle?

1638
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:04,880
I didn't see it.

1639
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,760
It's a button that they have to dangle down.

1640
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,480
No, there's the key in the middle.

1641
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,480
I don't know if you have to hit the buttons or what.

1642
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,220
Or avoid them.

1643
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,140
Oh, that's close.

1644
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,680
I kind of need that.

1645
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,180
I feel like...

1646
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,200
We probably have to be careful on that for a reason.

1647
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,820
We can just like play with it, you know?

1648
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,500
I think the buttons are bad news.

1649
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,860
No, we can jump.

1650
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,380
Maybe it's like as many people as possible jump across and then one goes down and you have to counterbalance it between the three.

1651
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:29,640
Let's try.

1652
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:29,820
Let's try.

1653
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,280
Okay, pull me up.

1654
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,440
Thank you, man.

1655
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,180
Don't go too far.

1656
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:35,520
Don't go too far.

1657
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,180
We're tangled up, but we did it.

1658
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,580
Alright, now we jump across.

1659
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,380
Let's just get maybe four of us.

1660
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,400
Guys, please.

1661
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,440
I'm in between you two.

1662
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,000
Hold on, guys.

1663
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,120
Don't go too far.

1664
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,560
Keep jumping.

1665
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,220
Who is that over there?

1666
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,440
We need to go left.

1667
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,000
Now we walk across.

1668
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,940
And then we jump.

1669
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,440
Okay.

1670
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,440
If we...

1671
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,440
Oh, and then we can drag.

1672
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,080
Yeah, let's drag.

1673
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,080
You fall between the cracks.

1674
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,820
Juniper, don't jump.

1675
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,660
You just fall.

1676
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,280
Can I dangle?

1677
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,240
No, no, no.

1678
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,980
I'm going down.

1679
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,720
My life is in your hands.

1680
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,500
Yeah.

1681
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,080
Oh, okay.

1682
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,180
I said the button.

1683
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,840
Guys.

1684
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,300
Yes.

1685
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,700
I'm talking.

1686
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,400
I think we're right.

1687
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,520
We do need to be super tangled.

1688
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,780
So that the line is shorter.

1689
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1690
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1691
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,940
Dangle her.

1692
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,460
Emily, you go down.

1693
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,860
Okay, okay.

1694
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,060
And then we pull up.

1695
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,740
We gotta pull up.

1696
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,560
Three more apart.

1697
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,520
Wait, wait.

1698
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,820
Jump on top of someone, right?

1699
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

1700
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,840
So I'm connected to one and two.

1701
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,360
One and two just need to be farther apart.

1702
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,440
The farther apart you are, the shorter the line.

1703
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1704
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,820
I can't jump.

1705
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,300
I can't jump.

1706
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,020
I can't jump.

1707
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,960
I can't jump.

1708
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,520
I can't jump.

1709
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:00,800
I can't jump.

1710
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,800
We need you guys to untangle.

1711
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:03,940
One and two.

1712
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,720
Okay.

1713
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,320
Okay.

1714
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,280
Okay.

1715
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:08,540
Okay.

1716
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,820
There we go.

1717
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,340
There we go.

1718
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:14,420
There we go.

1719
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:14,760
Okay.

1720
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,720
Nice, guys.

1721
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,580
And then...

1722
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,440
Farther apart.

1723
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:19,860
Farther apart.

1724
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,800
Okay.

1725
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,700
Nice.

1726
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,500
Nice.

1727
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,560
And then...

1728
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,240
We're so bad.

1729
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,080
We're so bad.

1730
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,680
All right.

1731
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,060
Nice.

1732
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,300
Oh, my goodness.

1733
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,000
We're so smart.

1734
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,660
We've done the impossible.

1735
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,640
We did it.

1736
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,800
We actually did it.

1737
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,880
Oh, my God.

1738
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,640
We're so smart.

1739
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,120
Oh, my God.

1740
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,500
Am I the only one tall enough to ride the ride?

1741
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,820
Yeah.

1742
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,160
We're too straight.

1743
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,580
You just got carried the whole time.

1744
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,180
You just got carried the whole time.

1745
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,280
Get in the backpack.

1746
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,160
Amelie, can you talk for me?

1747
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,140
I need to adjust your volume.

1748
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:03,380
I couldn't even register what was happening.

1749
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,160
Pass me one, two, three.

1750
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,640
That's better.

1751
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,220
Thank you.

1752
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,700
I think I need to change Juniper, too.

1753
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,380
What's that?

1754
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,700
Oh, yeah.

1755
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,480
Push the box.

1756
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,860
Oh, I have to push the box?

1757
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,100
Yeah.

1758
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,300
Yeah.

1759
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,260
Because you're orange.

1760
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,200
Okay, guys.

1761
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,800
I can't move.

1762
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:19,820
Sorry.

1763
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,840
I was looking back after adjusting Discord.

1764
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,060
I think we start over.

1765
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,600
We start over.

1766
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,140
No.

1767
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,360
No.

1768
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:23,560
No.

1769
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,280
We don't... Okay.

1770
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:24,960
Okay.

1771
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,500
Okay.

1772
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,440
Yeah.

1773
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,420
We need the full help.

1774
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,060
I know us.

1775
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,980
We need the full help.

1776
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,100
That's the box.

1777
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,280
All right.

1778
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,240
This time, it's Amelie.

1779
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:34,920
That's the box.

1780
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,340
Okay.

1781
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,580
I'm not even moving.

1782
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,820
Like, how are you guys hitting me?

1783
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,900
Jump over you.

1784
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,980
Amelie, it's your box.

1785
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,100
It's your box.

1786
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,980
It's the Amelie box.

1787
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,460
We have to jump over her.

1788
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,300
We have to jump over her.

1789
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:50,940
Okay.

1790
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,640
Jump over.

1791
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,900
Trash can.

1792
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,480
She's collecting the trash.

1793
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,020
I'm sorry.

1794
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:57,720
I shocked you.

1795
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,000
Don't beat the trash man.

1796
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,100
All right.

1797
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,900
I'm not moving and you touched me.

1798
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,500
It's your fault.

1799
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,480
I'm not moving.

1800
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,680
I know.

1801
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,080
Oh, no.

1802
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
Whacked me on life.

1803
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,540
I only have a few brain cells.

1804
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,240
Oh.

1805
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,840
Oh, it pushes you back.

1806
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,820
It pushes you back.

1807
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,080
Oh, no.

1808
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,560
There's a hole.

1809
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,000
There's a hole.

1810
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,460
There's a hole.

1811
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,020
Okay.

1812
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,520
Oh, it's timed.

1813
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:26,940
Timed.

1814
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,180
I see.

1815
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,200
Okay.

1816
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:28,460
Yeah.

1817
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,040
So we wait.

1818
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,600
So we wait.

1819
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,540
Yeah.

1820
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:30,740
Yeah.

1821
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,300
Go.

1822
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:32,860
Go.

1823
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,060
Go.

1824
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,240
Go.

1825
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Go.

1826
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,440
Go.

1827
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:33,680
Go.

1828
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:33,800
Go.

1829
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,240
Okay.

1830
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,940
Why didn't you jump across?

1831
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,800
Guys, we have one HP left.

1832
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,320
Guys.

1833
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,440
Jump up if you can.

1834
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,480
One health is all we need.

1835
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,460
Keep moving.

1836
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,040
Keep moving.

1837
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,460
Keep moving.

1838
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:47,880
Keep moving.

1839
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,560
We would have died anyway.

1840
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,020
Okay.

1841
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,420
My turn.

1842
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,220
Guys.

1843
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:57,840
Okay.

1844
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,700
It's your box now.

1845
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,800
Jump over my head.

1846
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,040
Oh.

1847
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,380
Okay.

1848
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,680
Alright.

1849
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,480
Get over here.

1850
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,400
Get over here.

1851
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,260
You guys gotta jump over me, guys.

1852
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,440
I really gotta jump over me.

1853
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,560
My bad.

1854
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,680
I forgot how this works.

1855
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,360
It's my box.

1856
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,060
Okay.

1857
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,520
Okay.

1858
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:17,760
Alright.

1859
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,760
I am not moving, so you touch me.

1860
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,360
It's your fault.

1861
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,960
I'm not moving.

1862
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,600
There's plenty of space.

1863
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,280
Okay.

1864
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:28,920
No, there's not.

1865
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,820
There's plenty of space.

1866
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,320
Oh, no.

1867
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,840
Hey, guys.

1868
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,020
It's gonna touch me.

1869
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,220
Guys, I need you guys.

1870
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:41,660
Okay.

1871
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,120
Here you go.

1872
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,100
Alright.

1873
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,780
Just run forward.

1874
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,500
Just run forward.

1875
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,400
Just go.

1876
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,420
There's nothing down there.

1877
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,380
What do you mean there's nothing down there?

1878
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,120
Just go.

1879
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:51,900
Donkey, go.

1880
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,340
Look at me.

1881
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,800
I'm literally kissing the wall right now.

1882
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,700
I'm literally kissing the wall.

1883
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,500
We're gonna be okay.

1884
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,240
Eventually.

1885
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,860
Bye-bye.

1886
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,760
There's plenty of room.

1887
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,940
Donkey, just go for it.

1888
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,120
I'm kissing the wall.

1889
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,500
Oh, my God.

1890
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,980
Oh, my God.

1891
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,420
We only have three hands left.

1892
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh, my God.

1893
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,480
That's so gross.

1894
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:22,310
Jesus.

1895
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,370
Wait.

1896
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,190
How do we get the key?

1897
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:26,510
How do we...

1898
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:27,750
You gotta make a jump, I think.

1899
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,150
Okay.

1900
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:29,630
Not like that.

1901
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,030
Okay.

1902
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,450
We have to be careful.

1903
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,210
I didn't realize it was me at the end.

1904
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:35,870
I didn't realize each other.

1905
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,170
I think one of us...

1906
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,990
We need to save one HP.

1907
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,250
So we can stack and get the key.

1908
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,350
Yeah.

1909
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:44,690
I agree.

1910
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:45,890
Brilliant.

1911
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,330
Brilliant.

1912
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:46,750
Okay.

1913
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,890
In the ideal scenario, we save all of the HP.

1914
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,830
No.

1915
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:52,170
That's...

1916
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,010
I think you're asking too much from us.

1917
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,150
That's too much.

1918
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:58,690
Alright.

1919
00:56:58,930 --> 00:56:59,870
Amelie, your turn.

1920
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,010
Amelie.

1921
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:03,530
Alright.

1922
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,330
Alright.

1923
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,530
I didn't move!

1924
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:18,770
Yay.

1925
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:19,130
Oh.

1926
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:20,770
Don't worry.

1927
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,490
You have another try.

1928
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:23,270
Alright.

1929
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,590
Go, go, go.

1930
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:25,450
Nice.

1931
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:26,370
My turn.

1932
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,290
See, I made it.

1933
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:29,530
I'm waiting for it.

1934
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,010
I got nervous.

1935
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,950
It's okay.

1936
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:33,210
You push up.

1937
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,250
You got to kiss the wall.

1938
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,910
We're getting performance anxiety in Pico Park.

1939
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:39,630
Okay.

1940
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,050
There's plenty of space, guys.

1941
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:42,730
You can make the jump.

1942
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:42,810
Yeah.

1943
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,670
You can make the jump.

1944
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:44,650
Oh my gosh.

1945
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,130
She's gaming.

1946
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,570
Okay.

1947
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:45,750
Relax.

1948
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,130
Relax.

1949
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:46,650
Yeah.

1950
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,050
There you go.

1951
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,350
Guys, don't touch.

1952
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,710
There's a lot of room, guys.

1953
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,770
There's a lot of...

1954
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,010
I didn't move.

1955
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,610
I didn't even...

1956
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,090
It's okay.

1957
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,290
The wall won't hurt you.

1958
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,870
Yeah.

1959
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:00,070
Yeah.

1960
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,410
Yeah.

1961
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:02,250
You just can't touch each other.

1962
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,310
Logically, maybe.

1963
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,750
It's hurting me.

1964
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,670
It's hurting my mind.

1965
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:06,590
Oh, there's a van.

1966
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,810
We got a key.

1967
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:09,090
Nice.

1968
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,210
Go.

1969
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:11,610
Go.

1970
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,390
What's going to happen to that?

1971
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,670
Oh, it's just going to push us up.

1972
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,590
It's just going to...

1973
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,670
Only six.

1974
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,530
Come on.

1975
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:21,830
Come on.

1976
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:22,110
Come on.

1977
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:23,230
Okay.

1978
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:23,650
Okay.

1979
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:24,070
Don't...

1980
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,950
We all know how to count, right, guys?

1981
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,270
We all know how to count.

1982
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,190
Yeah.

1983
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,650
Wait.

1984
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,710
It's going to go down into the water, right?

1985
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:34,530
Okay.

1986
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,080
Okay.

1987
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,740
Guys, shimmy.

1988
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,420
Okay.

1989
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,560
Okay.

1990
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:44,900
Okay.

1991
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,660
We're fine.

1992
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,420
We're fine.

1993
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,620
We can do this.

1994
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,600
Who said we can do this?

1995
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:56,820
Yeah.

1996
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,100
Guys, we beat level 15.

1997
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:02,420
Guys, we beat level 15.

1998
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,800
We can beat level 2.

1999
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,500
We got this.

2000
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:07,920
We got this.

2001
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,380
There's the needle.

2002
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,340
There we go.

2003
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,720
Make way.

2004
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,500
Make way.

2005
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,420
Make way.

2006
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,240
Make way.

2007
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,120
Nice.

2008
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:18,620
All right.

2009
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,600
Make way.

2010
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,180
Make way.

2011
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,920
Beep.

2012
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,200
Beep.

2013
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,560
Beep.

2014
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:22,780
Beep.

2015
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,000
Beep.

2016
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,560
Beep.

2017
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:24,980
Okay.

2018
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,640
All right.

2019
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,740
You're welcome.

2020
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,180
I don't think she trusts us on making the jump.

2021
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:31,980
I don't think...

2022
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,700
I don't think life trusts us in parkour.

2023
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,280
Is the thing going to...

2024
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,140
Is the thing going?

2025
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,380
It's just kind of like...

2026
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,240
Okay.

2027
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:42,840
No, we're good.

2028
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,320
I'll grab the key so don't come through.

2029
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,800
I'm staying completely still.

2030
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,140
I believe.

2031
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,260
Wait.

2032
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:51,520
Wait.

2033
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:51,740
Wait.

2034
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:51,820
Wait.

2035
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:51,940
Yeah.

2036
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,560
Do not continue, friends.

2037
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,280
Do not continue.

2038
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,060
Okay.

2039
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:55,580
Oh.

2040
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:55,740
Oh.

2041
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,120
No.

2042
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:56,260
No.

2043
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,340
No.

2044
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:57,900
Someone else is pushing.

2045
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,320
Someone else has got to get the key.

2046
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,720
Good luck.

2047
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,460
Okay, Mint.

2048
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,200
I believe in you.

2049
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,500
I can't do this.

2050
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,880
You guys have to go forward.

2051
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,140
You don't get it either.

2052
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,460
It's got to be the next person.

2053
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,360
Guys.

2054
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:11,680
Guys.

2055
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,020
I don't know.

2056
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,760
Three people at once is a good idea.

2057
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,380
I don't...

2058
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,900
Why are you coming back off?

2059
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,320
I didn't think that was a good idea.

2060
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,240
Yes.

2061
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:19,700
Remember.

2062
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,140
What is happening over there?

2063
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:22,680
Yes.

2064
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:22,980
Remember.

2065
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,220
Figure it out.

2066
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,400
Alright.

2067
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,320
I'm going to get smushed.

2068
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,700
I need you guys to move forward.

2069
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,500
Purple needs to move forward.

2070
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:31,780
Red.

2071
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:31,820
Red.

2072
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,520
Move forward.

2073
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,200
Okay.

2074
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,420
Don't worry.

2075
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,760
I learned how to park before.

2076
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,620
Okay.

2077
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,420
We're fine.

2078
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,100
We're fine.

2079
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,040
Okay.

2080
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,200
Okay.

2081
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,520
One at a time.

2082
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,780
One at a time.

2083
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,460
Guys.

2084
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,360
I'm not trying to make you nervous.

2085
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,080
I'm just scooting.

2086
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,380
What was that?

2087
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:02,380
One last life, guys.

2088
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,060
It's okay.

2089
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:03,880
It's okay.

2090
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,920
One last life.

2091
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,580
Red.

2092
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,060
Red.

2093
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,420
We need to scoot over a little bit.

2094
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,540
Who touched me?

2095
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,420
Who is freaking moving?

2096
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,520
Why can we not respect?

2097
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,340
Personal space.

2098
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,580
Nobody moved.

2099
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,480
Why can't we respect personal space?

2100
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,040
Please.

2101
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,300
We had two years to practice six feet.

2102
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:41,420
We had two years of isolation.

2103
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,360
And you still don't know personal space.

2104
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:44,920
Sorry.

2105
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,360
That's a mess.

2106
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,380
My broken bones.

2107
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,480
This is not the run, bros.

2108
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,680
Okay.

2109
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,480
Let's just die.

2110
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,420
We're close.

2111
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,420
Nobody moved at the beginning.

2112
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,020
I'm dead.

2113
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,180
It was like five people in a row.

2114
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,060
Okay.

2115
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,500
This is it.

2116
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,140
Chungus.

2117
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,860
The Chungus head.

2118
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,060
I'm moving.

2119
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,580
I'm moving.

2120
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,160
Chungus head.

2121
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:15,900
Okay.

2122
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,240
Keep moving a little bit.

2123
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:17,880
Okay, daughter.

2124
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,180
Okay.

2125
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,920
That was personal, I think.

2126
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:23,780
Alright.

2127
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,660
This is fine.

2128
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,020
That's for dying on level 15.

2129
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,700
Never forget.

2130
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,480
Never forgive.

2131
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,660
We know what you did.

2132
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,100
You made us do the run five more times.

2133
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,480
Okay.

2134
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,040
I'm going.

2135
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:40,460
I'm going.

2136
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,780
One together.

2137
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,600
Okay.

2138
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,920
One of you guys has to do the jump.

2139
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,900
Bao, I believe in you.

2140
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,100
Bao, I believe in you.

2141
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:50,540
Okay.

2142
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,280
Don't go.

2143
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:53,820
Big.

2144
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,660
Can you guys move forward?

2145
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,300
Yeah.

2146
01:02:59,320 --> 01:02:59,840
Alright.

2147
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,460
Okay.

2148
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,480
Alright.

2149
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,980
We have enough room for all three of you guys technically.

2150
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:08,920
Technically?

2151
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:09,560
Yeah.

2152
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,180
I mean, see?

2153
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:10,700
I told you.

2154
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,380
Alright.

2155
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,220
Alright.

2156
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,620
Are we all ready?

2157
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,480
Yes.

2158
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,320
Oh yeah.

2159
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,200
Get ready.

2160
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:20,900
Do the jump.

2161
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,440
Do the jump.

2162
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:21,760
Okay.

2163
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,740
Go.

2164
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,340
Go.

2165
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:23,580
Go.

2166
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,260
Okay.

2167
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,060
Go.

2168
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:25,420
Go.

2169
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:25,580
Go.

2170
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:25,840
Go.

2171
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,300
Go to the end and scoot left.

2172
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,040
Okay.

2173
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:28,940
Keep scooting.

2174
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,180
Scooting.

2175
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,560
Scooting.

2176
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:29,880
Scooting.

2177
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,760
Who's not scooting?

2178
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,480
Who's not scooting?

2179
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,720
Who's not scooting back there?

2180
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,260
Okay.

2181
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:35,680
Please.

2182
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,360
Please.

2183
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:36,680
Okay.

2184
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,080
Okay.

2185
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:37,320
Okay.

2186
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,000
We're good.

2187
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:38,300
We're good.

2188
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,040
Now we get off.

2189
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,260
Get off.

2190
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:42,900
Open the door.

2191
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:43,560
Okay.

2192
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:43,880
Okay.

2193
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,220
Just go.

2194
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:44,640
Just go.

2195
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,360
Just go.

2196
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:45,560
Just go.

2197
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:46,920
Go.

2198
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,240
Go.

2199
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:48,540
Go.

2200
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,100
Okay.

2201
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:52,900
Let's go.

2202
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,140
Oh lord.

2203
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,520
Distance is complete.

2204
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,080
I can feel the tension in my brain.

2205
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,380
We can go.

2206
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,960
We're so good at video games.

2207
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,000
We're gonna be such great friends after this game.

2208
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,020
Formation.

2209
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,680
We're still gonna be friends you think?

2210
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,240
Formation guys.

2211
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,620
What is this?

2212
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,060
It's a pee break.

2213
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,620
No one's gonna piss.

2214
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,080
No one's gonna piss.

2215
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,300
This isn't the epilepsy level is it?

2216
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,460
Someone has to piss.

2217
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,320
Okay.

2218
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,720
Go use the bathroom.

2219
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,660
We'll figure this out while you're gone.

2220
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,540
It's just red light green light.

2221
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,660
Oh okay.

2222
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,240
Guys the light hurts.

2223
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:34,900
I think it was Juniper.

2224
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,980
It was not me.

2225
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,320
I am quiet.

2226
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,120
I think it was Amelie then.

2227
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,680
Okay.

2228
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,180
So light hurts.

2229
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:45,720
Yeah.

2230
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,620
That's just how it is.

2231
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,520
As a gamer.

2232
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,420
Okay so it's...

2233
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,860
There's only enough space.

2234
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,180
I think there's only enough space for a stack.

2235
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,440
We could stack.

2236
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,840
Go here.

2237
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:00,780
Go here.

2238
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:04,680
We can't stack too high because there's so little light.

2239
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:05,880
Stack it.

2240
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,080
Oh my goodness.

2241
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,520
Wait what if we all just stack?

2242
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,740
Oh that's true.

2243
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:13,760
No no no.

2244
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,500
I think we'll get the light.

2245
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,860
We can do three.

2246
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,420
So we could do groups of three.

2247
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,360
Or four.

2248
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,700
Get behind me.

2249
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:24,460
Wait.

2250
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:28,130
Oh.

2251
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,450
I have four gore.

2252
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:33,910
Four gore?

2253
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:35,410
Can we do four?

2254
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,790
I think we can do four.

2255
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:38,430
We definitely can.

2256
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,050
We have space for four.

2257
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,830
Four gore.

2258
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:42,510
So.

2259
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,610
Emily can just be a solo.

2260
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:45,670
Oh okay.

2261
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:47,850
Brain damage.

2262
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,330
I mean after that last level.

2263
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,070
Everyone on top of your head.

2264
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,490
Yeah.

2265
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,090
Wait no we can stack like this.

2266
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:58,390
Wow.

2267
01:05:58,510 --> 01:05:59,570
This is so funny.

2268
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,810
Okay nice.

2269
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,430
It's fine.

2270
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,710
She can solo this.

2271
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,210
I believe.

2272
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:10,610
She is.

2273
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,630
Guys I don't think.

2274
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,310
Guys I told you.

2275
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,030
I told you.

2276
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:17,750
I told you.

2277
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,480
Hey welcome back.

2278
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,080
She can't solo this.

2279
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,960
Wait no.

2280
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,360
We shouldn't let her solo this.

2281
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,760
We can get five.

2282
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:31,820
We can get five.

2283
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:32,960
Okay.

2284
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,360
Oh sorry.

2285
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:40,120
I bet we could make a perfect diamond pyramid.

2286
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:40,940
Oh that's true.

2287
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:41,980
Let's do it.

2288
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,020
Let's show our beautiful skills.

2289
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,080
Yeah yeah.

2290
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,100
I need you to move to the right a little bit.

2291
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:50,560
Exactly.

2292
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,340
Do we have enough room to make a perfect diamond?

2293
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:53,840
Yeah we can.

2294
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,360
There we go.

2295
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,040
It's beautiful.

2296
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,920
This is not a diamond.

2297
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,360
We can stack two people on top of us too.

2298
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,140
Maybe purple jump on top too.

2299
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,180
Yeah.

2300
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:10,700
Purple.

2301
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,860
How does pink get up?

2302
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,420
Rin.

2303
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,660
Rin jump.

2304
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,640
And then.

2305
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,480
We must realign.

2306
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,880
How does snuffy get up?

2307
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,880
Maybe green make a little room.

2308
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,480
I can move a little bit.

2309
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,300
Let's see if red can get on top of Baal.

2310
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,600
I am on top of Baal.

2311
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,800
Oh guys we are getting closer to the left.

2312
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,280
Okay.

2313
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,020
Don't do it too close up.

2314
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,740
Let's not assemble that.

2315
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,020
Okay.

2316
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,080
Let's just do five.

2317
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,580
We are making it too fancy.

2318
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,320
Okay.

2319
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,440
I can have another person on Baal.

2320
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,200
Okay.

2321
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:51,140
I want snuffy's pyramid to happen though.

2322
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:51,680
Okay.

2323
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:54,880
Wait.

2324
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,360
Who is going to be at the bottom?

2325
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:56,900
No.

2326
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,320
Baal is going to be at the bottom here.

2327
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,100
I can choose one person to be at the bottom.

2328
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,040
Yes.

2329
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,800
It can be this tall.

2330
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,600
This is as tall as it can be.

2331
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:08,740
Okay.

2332
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:09,760
Okay.

2333
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,480
It can't be any bigger than two at the bottom.

2334
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,000
I am pretty sure.

2335
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,660
We did it.

2336
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,000
Okay.

2337
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,660
Now you can stack up.

2338
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,360
Why did you walk right?

2339
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,840
Why did you?

2340
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,340
Why?

2341
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,580
We just need two different stacks.

2342
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,560
That's no need to over complicate this.

2343
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:37,900
It's fancy.

2344
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,060
We wanted to be a beautiful pyramid.

2345
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,100
You pyramid haters.

2346
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
We are already beautiful.

2347
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,100
My bad.

2348
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,980
Pyramid Johns always wants it.

2349
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,420
That's the reason it's called a pyramid scheme.

2350
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,660
I hear you.

2351
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,320
I get it.

2352
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:54,680
Okay.

2353
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,340
Look at that.

2354
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,560
Now we are a boring line.

2355
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,180
We can't have nice things guys.

2356
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,040
I love boring lines.

2357
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,000
That was just a lie.

2358
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,960
Oh my god.

2359
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,200
Oh my god.

2360
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,100
Okay.

2361
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,300
This is fine.

2362
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,940
I still trust Bao despite her failure.

2363
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,480
Failure?

2364
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,360
Okay.

2365
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,760
So what happened was...

2366
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,400
I don't think I trust Bao at the bottom anymore.

2367
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,900
I still trust Bao.

2368
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,380
I am a professional.

2369
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,620
Last chance Bao.

2370
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,320
You die.

2371
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,400
We are swapping bottoms.

2372
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:31,600
Goodbye.

2373
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,400
It's okay.

2374
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:34,960
I will catch up.

2375
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,720
Don't worry.

2376
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,320
Um...

2377
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,560
Don't catch up.

2378
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,300
But what about me?

2379
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,280
Now I can catch up.

2380
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,840
I trust Bao.

2381
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,720
I trust Bao.

2382
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,320
I can't go anywhere.

2383
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,780
I would give Bao a gun.

2384
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,340
Give Bao a gun.

2385
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,120
Okay.

2386
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:55,620
There you go.

2387
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:56,940
Alright.

2388
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,100
I would not give Bao a gun.

2389
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,360
Alright, Bao.

2390
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,260
You've lost your bottom privileges.

2391
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,340
You've lost your bottom privileges.

2392
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:06,820
You've lost your bottom privileges.

2393
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,200
You've lost it.

2394
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,580
Maybe I trust Rin more.

2395
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,000
That's a dangerous statement.

2396
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,340
That's a dangerous statement.

2397
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,140
And that's what happens when you don't fully trust the one at the bottom.

2398
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:21,220
when you don't fully trust the one at the bottom.

2399
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,800
Maybe we should swap the bottom.

2400
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,940
Maybe we should swap the bottom.

2401
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,140
Someone giving you my face.

2402
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:28,520
Someone giving you my face.

2403
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,980
Stop fighting.

2404
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,400
Stop fighting.

2405
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,500
Alright.

2406
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,220
Here we go.

2407
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,060
Okay, alright.

2408
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,020
I think it has to be a line.

2409
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,380
No, it doesn't have to be.

2410
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,500
It's too dangerous.

2411
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,760
I was throwing, but now I'm gonna lock in for real.

2412
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,100
Okay, let's realign us to be a perfect line.

2413
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,100
There we go.

2414
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,980
There we go, so...

2415
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,040
Alright, here we go.

2416
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,020
You're getting awfully close there, Bao!

2417
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,940
You're getting awfully close there!

2418
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,940
Get up!

2419
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:06,340
Get up!

2420
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:06,340
Okay.

2421
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:06,820
Okay.

2422
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,400
Oh, there's light on there.

2423
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,440
Guys, this is just the first obstacle.

2424
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,840
I don't like it.

2425
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,560
I feel like it has to be a key there.

2426
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,420
How the fuck does this work?

2427
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,280
Oh my god.

2428
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,000
Checkpoint!

2429
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:19,840
Checkpoint!

2430
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,220
Checkpoint!

2431
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,060
Oh my god.

2432
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,620
They knew.

2433
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,720
They knew deep down that this level was gonna be nice.

2434
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,120
Oh, there's a key!

2435
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,200
There's a key!

2436
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,620
Go back!

2437
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,040
Go back!

2438
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,260
Go back!

2439
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,800
We have to do the trust run.

2440
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,940
Oh, more people have gotta get people over there.

2441
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,060
Okay, it's fine.

2442
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:34,500
Okay.

2443
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,140
Okay, so wait.

2444
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:35,440
Hold on.

2445
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:35,820
Hold on.

2446
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,620
We gotta run.

2447
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,560
Y'all just gotta run.

2448
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,460
I'm sprinting!

2449
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,500
I'm sprinting!

2450
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,440
I'm sprinting!

2451
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,740
You have trapped me on the platform!

2452
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:43,820
Okay, I'm good.

2453
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,620
Okay, wait.

2454
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,880
We can stack this up!

2455
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,200
We can stack this up technically.

2456
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,640
We can stack this up!

2457
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,180
I don't trust you, Dolly!

2458
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,300
Okay.

2459
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,480
There you go.

2460
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,200
See, I told you.

2461
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,280
I told you we could stack this up.

2462
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,380
I told you we could stack this up.

2463
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,820
But like, I can't go downstairs.

2464
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:00,520
I can't...

2465
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,900
Why are you... Why are you...

2466
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,080
Thank God almighty for the checkpoint.

2467
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,900
Thank God almighty for the checkpoint.

2468
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,000
More than we needed it.

2469
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:09,320
Yay!

2470
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,100
We're going in.

2471
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:11,360
That was so funny.

2472
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,840
Can we move the camera over, I think?

2473
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,300
Yeah, someone has to move the camera over.

2474
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,800
I'll move the camera.

2475
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:18,500
Okay.

2476
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:18,980
Okay.

2477
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,060
Bum-bum-bum.

2478
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,160
Bum-bum-bum.

2479
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,980
Not being moved.

2480
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:25,480
No!

2481
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,820
I need more people to come at the same time.

2482
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,500
Okay, everyone get on top of me!

2483
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,360
Stack!

2484
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:32,560
Stack!

2485
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:32,720
Stack!

2486
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:32,920
Stack!

2487
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,940
We just gotta stack all the way up.

2488
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,480
There's no light that's gonna hurt us.

2489
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,100
Trust me.

2490
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,240
All you have to do is get on top of me.

2491
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,100
Yeah, yeah.

2492
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,540
She's done this like three times now.

2493
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,440
There's no way she can fuck it up.

2494
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,840
No way we lose these.

2495
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,520
He's stacking!

2496
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,060
He's stacking!

2497
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,840
I have a little... Okay.

2498
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,600
Green, move a little bit forward.

2499
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,460
Yup.

2500
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,080
There we go.

2501
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,940
Purple, move forward.

2502
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,500
Wait, why?

2503
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,400
We're ready.

2504
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,000
Alright.

2505
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,320
Okay.

2506
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,060
Are you ready?

2507
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,760
Trust the process.

2508
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,460
Trust the process.

2509
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:06,100
Go!

2510
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:06,760
Go!

2511
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:07,260
Go!

2512
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:07,620
Go!

2513
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:07,860
Go!

2514
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:08,340
Go!

2515
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,080
Go!

2516
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:09,780
Okay!

2517
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,000
Back up!

2518
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,580
As soon as it disappears!

2519
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2520
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:16,880
Go!

2521
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,320
Go!

2522
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:17,580
Go!

2523
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:17,720
Go!

2524
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:17,860
Go!

2525
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:18,520
Go!

2526
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:18,960
Go!

2527
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,480
Oh, we did it!

2528
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:21,860
We did it!

2529
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:22,180
Yay!

2530
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,320
What?!

2531
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,540
I hate this!

2532
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:27,960
No way!

2533
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,080
No way!

2534
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,070
That's fucking way!

2535
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,870
Trust me.

2536
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:41,490
Hand me the gun.

2537
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:41,790
Okay.

2538
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:42,690
Put it in my hands.

2539
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,610
Just jury and execution.

2540
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:45,830
Alright, here we go.

2541
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:47,310
Alright.

2542
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:50,510
We just hug the left wall after we get over.

2543
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,950
Yeah, we're gonna fall and then not move.

2544
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:53,290
Okay.

2545
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:54,490
After this one.

2546
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,050
After this one.

2547
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:55,470
Yeah.

2548
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:55,850
Okay.

2549
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,510
Go!

2550
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:57,970
Go!

2551
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:58,310
Go!

2552
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:58,970
Go!

2553
01:13:59,010 --> 01:13:59,270
Go!

2554
01:13:59,370 --> 01:13:59,370
Go!

2555
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,830
Alright, we're just gonna fall and not move.

2556
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,030
Just fall!

2557
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:02,350
Fall!

2558
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:02,470
Fall!

2559
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,510
Fall!

2560
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,570
Okay, okay!

2561
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:06,090
Okay!

2562
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:06,730
Go!

2563
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:07,170
Go!

2564
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:10,010
Oh, I don't think guys got the thing!

2565
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:10,890
We have too much time!

2566
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:15,270
Easy game.

2567
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,090
Easy game.

2568
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:17,810
Easy game.

2569
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:17,870
Easy game.

2570
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,130
We all just ran.

2571
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,850
Like, what the fuck?

2572
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,950
Every man for themselves.

2573
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,210
Not if you can't.

2574
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,390
You guys all just ran.

2575
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:32,270
I know, right?

2576
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:32,910
We have to all be on it.

2577
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:36,510
This is gonna be great, I think.

2578
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:37,210
This is gonna be great, I think.

2579
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:39,070
Yeah, I think there's gonna go be an obstacle down the front.

2580
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:39,570
Oh, oh!

2581
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:40,650
Line!

2582
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:41,030
Line!

2583
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,390
Line!

2584
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:41,750
Line!

2585
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:42,090
Line!

2586
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:42,430
Line!

2587
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:42,650
Line!

2588
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:42,710
Line!

2589
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,070
Okay!

2590
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:43,810
Oh!

2591
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:44,510
Okay, okay!

2592
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,570
We got the little hole.

2593
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:50,630
We got...

2594
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:51,590
Next try baby!

2595
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,130
We're in the game!

2596
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:53,390
Okay...

2597
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,790
To the right.

2598
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,330
To the right.

2599
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:57,330
I think, I think.적으로.

2600
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:01,330
Wait, this has to be...

2601
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,810
Okay, but we're getting there.

2602
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,230
Okay, we're figuring it out.

2603
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,230
Okay, line, line.

2604
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,790
No stacks, line, line.

2605
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,470
Is anyone else?

2606
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:11,530
Okay.

2607
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,130
Part the middle, part the middle.

2608
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,630
Part the C!

2609
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:19,070
Okay, there we go.

2610
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,490
It's like Noah.

2611
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:24,350
Left, left.

2612
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,050
Left, left.

2613
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,390
Left, left.

2614
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:31,430
We have to stack, we have to stack.

2615
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:35,390
We have to stay in the middle.

2616
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,650
When it starts going down.

2617
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2618
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,690
Stack in the middle.

2619
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,230
Line, line, line.

2620
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,010
Okay.

2621
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,730
I keep thinking you guys are specifically yelling at me.

2622
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,570
Part the C.

2623
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:50,770
Part the C.

2624
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:52,730
We're yelling at everybody.

2625
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,130
Now we have to stack in the middle.

2626
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,010
Stack in the middle.

2627
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,630
I'm trusting you guys, please.

2628
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:01,410
Stack in the middle, there we go.

2629
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,090
Oh, look at us go.

2630
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,210
Okay, we did it.

2631
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,430
Okay, what horrible tribulation will come next?

2632
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:07,210
That's it?

2633
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:10,310
Okay, the key.

2634
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:12,390
That was pretty easy.

2635
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:16,090
Okay, keys, key, key.

2636
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:23,350
When you get the key and you put it...

2637
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:27,710
Yeah, and then you get the key and then you put in the hole and then I got the key and then we're here.

2638
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:28,150
Okay.

2639
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,590
That's how you put the key in the hole.

2640
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,510
That's how you put the key in the hole.

2641
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,930
Playing hot potato with the key.

2642
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:37,410
Playing hot potato with the key.

2643
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:40,410
Actually, the hardest part was getting that key in the hole.

2644
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:40,770
Actually, the hardest part was getting that key in the hole.

2645
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,850
Wait, was that really time shot?

2646
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:46,130
No, no, they were fucking over.

2647
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,390
Oh, no.

2648
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,490
No, not the suck.

2649
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:50,730
I've got utility.

2650
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,330
What's the skill?

2651
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:52,890
Okay.

2652
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,490
Bow, you don't suck.

2653
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,670
Bow, you don't suck.

2654
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:57,890
You let get sucked.

2655
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:58,290
Okay.

2656
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:00,170
Just jump.

2657
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:00,930
There we go.

2658
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,630
This is so cool.

2659
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,370
Okay, alright.

2660
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,510
What's happening here?

2661
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,070
Wait, how does this...

2662
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:15,010
We have to be aligned.

2663
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,070
We have to be aligned.

2664
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:19,810
So, like...

2665
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:22,350
So, everybody's a suck in the line.

2666
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,870
Suck free.

2667
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:23,330
Jump.

2668
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,910
Just jump.

2669
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:24,430
Trust fall.

2670
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:24,710
Jump.

2671
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,590
No, you suck.

2672
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,610
I suck you.

2673
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:30,110
Alright.

2674
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,290
Each of us holds square, guys.

2675
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:33,510
Not square.

2676
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,530
Each of us holds space bar.

2677
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:41,850
You're supposed to wait for us.

2678
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:46,890
We have to be all sucked up.

2679
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:48,830
Okay.

2680
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,090
You suck me.

2681
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,730
This one, it blows my mind.

2682
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:53,610
I don't even know what this is.

2683
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:53,870
Okay.

2684
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,790
So, Bow gonna suck.

2685
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,390
I suck.

2686
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,850
We all suck together.

2687
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:01,410
And then Bow pushes us forward.

2688
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:02,650
Huh?

2689
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,990
So, we're all gripped up.

2690
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,110
And then she pushes...

2691
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,550
So, you see... Yeah, we're all gripped up.

2692
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,710
And then Bow, you... Okay, we lost our platform.

2693
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:12,310
So, okay.

2694
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,950
Thank god.

2695
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:13,130
Okay.

2696
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:13,830
Alright.

2697
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:14,530
Alright.

2698
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:14,910
Now...

2699
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:16,670
Do I have to be on the end?

2700
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:18,370
Because I don't know how to join the suck.

2701
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:19,090
We all suck.

2702
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:19,550
We all...

2703
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:19,990
No, no, no.

2704
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:21,810
You all go face right side.

2705
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,470
You all face right and then Bow pushes us.

2706
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,710
And then I hold you guys.

2707
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:25,950
Yeah, yeah.

2708
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,910
We all hold each other like groups of friends.

2709
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:30,450
Okay.

2710
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:30,770
What?

2711
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,810
And then there you go as the... Okay.

2712
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:36,070
Somebody let go.

2713
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:39,510
Somebody let go.

2714
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,370
Wait, how is that gonna help?

2715
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,510
Oh my god.

2716
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,530
Oh my god.

2717
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,390
We are creating a perpetual motion machine.

2718
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,950
It's artificial gravity.

2719
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,910
Okay.

2720
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,830
We're creating a perpetual motion machine.

2721
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,690
I don't understand.

2722
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,430
Physics kneels before Pico Pops.

2723
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:58,930
Okay.

2724
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,550
Is there like a zig-zag pattern?

2725
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,110
No, no, no.

2726
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:04,790
When you put the magnet in front of the car.

2727
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,910
We do need to be in a line.

2728
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:07,810
Why wouldn't it work?

2729
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:11,090
The person on the end of the line needs to be on the far right hand side of the platform.

2730
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,490
So, when the platform goes up, they don't collide with the platform.

2731
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:18,730
So, they have to hold everybody else off the platform while standing on the very end of the platform by themselves.

2732
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:19,710
I'm pretty sure.

2733
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,070
And that's how you suck.

2734
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,610
Yeah, we all need to suck real hard.

2735
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:27,830
We all face the same direction guys while you're sucking.

2736
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,450
Face the same direction everybody.

2737
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,550
And we're... The end as well?

2738
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:33,290
Yeah, yeah.

2739
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:36,610
Yes, you all face and then you push us out.

2740
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:37,890
You push us up.

2741
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,570
The rest of us do not move.

2742
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,370
Do not move.

2743
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:46,130
You do not move.

2744
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:54,570
And then you grab the key and then we still do not move.

2745
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,550
Okay, we have to swap directions.

2746
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:06,230
I see it now.

2747
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,450
We have to reverse the suck now.

2748
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,910
Okay, we have to reverse that.

2749
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,950
Alright.

2750
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:13,270
Okay.

2751
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,690
The rest of...

2752
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,030
Okay.

2753
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,170
Okay.

2754
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,250
I'll be at the end.

2755
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,170
I'll be at the end.

2756
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:19,930
Stop.

2757
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,090
Okay, here we go.

2758
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,150
You guys ready?

2759
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:24,790
Do not move guys.

2760
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,650
Do not move everybody.

2761
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:33,870
Alright, and then we turn around.

2762
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:39,530
You guys all turn around and then bounce.

2763
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:41,590
You go right and you go...

2764
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2765
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:43,230
None of us move.

2766
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:44,010
Trust.

2767
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,590
There we go.

2768
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:46,970
Big.

2769
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:47,870
Big.

2770
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:48,970
Slow.

2771
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,230
Slow.

2772
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,990
Come on.

2773
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,570
Come on.

2774
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,090
We're getting better.

2775
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,990
Trust.

2776
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:01,630
Okay, guys.

2777
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:02,370
Okay, I got you guys.

2778
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:03,970
Emily, face the right side.

2779
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:05,050
Oh, wait.

2780
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:05,830
I'll be at this side.

2781
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:06,410
Okay, here we go.

2782
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,190
Alright.

2783
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,990
Push, push, push up so we can connect.

2784
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:11,370
Alright.

2785
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,010
Here we go.

2786
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:14,030
No one let go.

2787
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,230
No one move.

2788
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,810
Except for...

2789
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:21,490
Somebody trying to let go.

2790
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,510
You're trolling.

2791
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:23,550
Okay.

2792
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,550
Alright.

2793
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,250
Somebody is knocking.

2794
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:28,250
Okay.

2795
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:29,810
Okay.

2796
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:32,790
All the way back.

2797
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:33,290
You're okay.

2798
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,790
Here we go.

2799
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,550
We're fine.

2800
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:37,810
Alright.

2801
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:39,790
Here we go.

2802
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,130
We made it.

2803
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:42,930
Oh my god.

2804
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:43,410
Yay.

2805
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:47,050
Oh my god.

2806
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,070
I saw what you guys...

2807
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,310
Okay, guys.

2808
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:50,490
One at a time.

2809
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:51,710
Yay.

2810
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:52,390
Yay.

2811
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,570
We sucked the victory.

2812
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:57,310
Oh.

2813
01:21:58,670 --> 01:21:59,710
My brain.

2814
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:01,210
We sucked so hard.

2815
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,190
I feel like... I can feel the pressure on my brain.

2816
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:08,570
I feel like my brain just got sucked.

2817
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:09,330
I feel like my brain just got sucked.

2818
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:09,570
I feel like my brain just got sucked.

2819
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:10,050
Wait, remember what?

2820
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,110
What's happening?

2821
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:14,150
It's sucking again.

2822
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:16,830
Just remember your own spot.

2823
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,110
Where's my color?

2824
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,450
Which one is me?

2825
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,850
I remember a goddamn thing.

2826
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,250
I remember.

2827
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:25,250
I was here.

2828
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,110
I'm here.

2829
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,750
I don't know where I'm supposed to be.

2830
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:29,830
I was down here.

2831
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,570
I was here.

2832
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,050
I was literally just doing this.

2833
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,870
Now we're kissing.

2834
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,650
Guys, you guys remember?

2835
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,850
Oh my god.

2836
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:41,570
Oh, you guys have to push those squares too.

2837
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:42,970
Am I here?

2838
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:44,290
I think I'm here.

2839
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,250
Guys, you have to remember where your squares are too.

2840
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:47,970
You have to remember.

2841
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:48,930
You have to move the blocks.

2842
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:52,110
Oh, we have to move the blocks.

2843
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:53,790
Let's see if you guys remember.

2844
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,150
Where are we?

2845
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,610
Guys, I don't think...

2846
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,030
Okay, I got it.

2847
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:01,670
We have the blocks.

2848
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,510
Why didn't you read it?

2849
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,970
We fucked up.

2850
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:08,230
That's wrong.

2851
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,150
Wow.

2852
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:11,710
Wow.

2853
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:12,910
Wow.

2854
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:16,970
You were so fucking wrong.

2855
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,150
Okay.

2856
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,090
I was right.

2857
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,090
Remember your squares.

2858
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,610
And I gotta be on the ledge.

2859
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,250
Okay, I know what I'm doing.

2860
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:27,090
It's gonna be great.

2861
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,070
Okay.

2862
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:28,490
Okay.

2863
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:28,790
Okay.

2864
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:32,130
Purple's gotta push their square all the way downstairs.

2865
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:33,170
I have a box.

2866
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:33,750
I got this.

2867
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:35,930
I'm pretty sure I do nothing.

2868
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:38,870
I don't do anything either.

2869
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:39,490
Oh, wait.

2870
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:40,010
No, no.

2871
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,890
Wait, box, come back.

2872
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:44,930
Don't drop my box.

2873
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:46,910
Oh my god.

2874
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,550
You guys are here.

2875
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:50,110
Oh my god.

2876
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:52,350
I don't know.

2877
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:55,590
I don't know why I did it.

2878
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:56,970
I don't know why I did it.

2879
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:58,230
Can we redo?

2880
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:00,730
Huge.

2881
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:02,670
Oh, my beautiful box.

2882
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,530
Hi.

2883
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:07,590
She was begging you and you still didn't.

2884
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,470
Oh, I was right.

2885
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,390
Oh, I was facing the wrong way.

2886
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:13,630
Are they gonna get mad at me?

2887
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:17,250
I remember the game was like, well, Rin did it right.

2888
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,950
I didn't face the right direction, so it's right.

2889
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,070
I didn't face the right direction, so it's right.

2890
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,170
I didn't face the right direction, so it's right.

2891
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:25,350
What is it that you want?

2892
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:27,450
I want a box.

2893
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:28,190
We're so good.

2894
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:29,690
Test your memory.

2895
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:32,190
No, I have to do the box now.

2896
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:34,670
I'm looking at my stream preview.

2897
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,650
Okay, I'm here.

2898
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:38,330
I'm here.

2899
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,490
The box is here.

2900
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,790
Okay, I just need to be next to Rin.

2901
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:45,330
Okay, I just need to be next to Rin.

2902
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:46,310
I need to chill out with Doki.

2903
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:49,470
Wait, I thought I was blue for some reason.

2904
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,370
I've already messed up.

2905
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,110
I'm set.

2906
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:52,570
I'm chilling.

2907
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:55,010
I messed it all up, bro.

2908
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,290
I don't know what to do.

2909
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:57,670
I am successful.

2910
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:58,810
I'm flirting.

2911
01:24:58,890 --> 01:24:59,890
Maybe you don't know what to do.

2912
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:03,050
I thought I was blue for some reason.

2913
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,990
I was looking at Bao's voice on the map for no reason.

2914
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:07,330
You fool.

2915
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,870
Push the box a little bit to the right.

2916
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,610
To the right, Bao, please.

2917
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,550
To the right, Bao, please.

2918
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,530
She can't.

2919
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,130
She's blue.

2920
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:21,390
Oh my gosh.

2921
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:22,770
Where's Juniper?

2922
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,230
Where's Juniper?

2923
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,830
I was just guessing.

2924
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,930
I was looking at the wrong person.

2925
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:31,770
Juniper.

2926
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:32,590
I thought you threw.

2927
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:33,870
I threw, bros.

2928
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:34,290
I threw.

2929
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,310
We were so close.

2930
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,190
That's all me, baby.

2931
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,350
Okay, no more box.

2932
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:43,750
Over your box.

2933
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,510
Over your box.

2934
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,250
Two pieces to the left.

2935
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:49,350
My box is slightly here.

2936
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,510
I love this for me.

2937
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,830
Okay, I'm here.

2938
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,430
I'm here.

2939
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,470
Okay, I'm here.

2940
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:57,690
I'm done.

2941
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:59,290
Guys, please.

2942
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:00,810
Guys, please.

2943
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:05,670
Easiest assignment ever.

2944
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:06,970
Okay, there you go.

2945
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:07,930
Good luck, everybody else.

2946
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:09,610
Yeah, I get to stay here.

2947
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:11,750
Get your box, please.

2948
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,790
What the fuck is this box doing over here?

2949
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:14,930
Get this box out of my face.

2950
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:18,050
Do you remember where your box was?

2951
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,210
Okay, I'm done.

2952
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:20,470
I don't remember where it was.

2953
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:23,290
Wait, please.

2954
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:24,390
No.

2955
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,450
Wait, that might be good.

2956
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:29,810
No, no, no.

2957
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:40,490
We were so close.

2958
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,070
Oh my god, so close.

2959
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,690
Oh my god.

2960
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:48,430
Tester memory.

2961
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:49,190
This is so hard.

2962
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,730
This is so difficult.

2963
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:53,730
Oh my gosh.

2964
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,730
Okay, this one's easy.

2965
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:57,350
I'm here.

2966
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:00,170
Wait, did I just spawn in the right place?

2967
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,690
Yeah, yeah, you did.

2968
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:03,550
I'm done.

2969
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:04,730
I don't know about you guys.

2970
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:07,430
Okay, this is where I am.

2971
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,410
Alright, nice.

2972
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,290
We did not get to chill.

2973
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,830
Did you use my box?

2974
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:15,110
Why did you take it?

2975
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:16,490
Guys.

2976
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:17,950
Okay.

2977
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:18,470
Okay.

2978
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:19,750
Stop.

2979
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:21,630
Okay.

2980
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,810
Stop it.

2981
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:26,790
Wait, push the blue off.

2982
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:27,810
Push the blue off.

2983
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,690
Push the blue off.

2984
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:31,210
Okay.

2985
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:32,870
Okay.

2986
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:37,110
Why did you grab me?

2987
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:39,270
Why did you?

2988
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:44,330
You can take anybody's box.

2989
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,930
Yeah, you can just grab people's fucking box.

2990
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,690
You can just grab the- Someone sabotaged me.

2991
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,070
I know what you guys brought us.

2992
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:55,650
I know what you guys brought us.

2993
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:56,150
Mia!

2994
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:59,090
Why did you punch me?

2995
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,270
Why did you punch me?

2996
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:02,310
That's it.

2997
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:03,650
That's it.

2998
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:10,290
If my box can't be where a lot of nobody's box can be Okay.

2999
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,450
Oh, fuck.

3000
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,730
That's so fucked.

3001
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:15,690
Okay.

3002
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,350
Okay.

3003
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:17,590
This is where I am.

3004
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:17,810
Oh, fuck.

3005
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
I'm right here.

3006
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
Okay.

3007
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
Okay.

3008
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
Okay.

3009
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
Okay.

3010
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
This is where I am.

Okay.

3014
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,910
This is where I am.

3015
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:19,630
Where the fuck am I?

3016
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:20,130
Okay.

3017
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:20,830
Oh, it's over.

3018
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:21,910
Oh, no, please.

3019
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:24,090
I did my box.

3020
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,550
Guys.

3021
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:26,650
Don't worry, Yellow.

3022
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:28,150
I'm gonna do us a solid.

3023
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:28,510
Okay.

3024
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:35,550
Now, Yellow, you just have to come back here and stand behind the- Stop sucking me!

3025
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:38,550
Please!

3026
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:39,610
Please!

3027
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,770
Get some of this out of here!

3028
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:44,630
Rin, I don't think you're supposed to stay in there, Rin.

3029
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:46,630
I don't think you're supposed to be there, Rin!

3030
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:52,710
I don't think this box is supposed to be- I don't think this box is supposed to be- What the fuck?

3031
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,190
Wait, this might be okay.

3032
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,290
This might be it.

3033
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:57,890
This might be it.

3034
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:58,570
There's no way.

3035
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,130
There's no way.

3036
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,710
No, the box is out of position.

3037
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,050
No, this might be okay.

3038
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:03,830
This might be okay.

3039
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:04,050
Rest.

3040
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:04,330
Rest.

3041
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:04,610
Rest.

3042
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:05,890
No!

3043
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:08,790
The box!

3044
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:12,870
The box!

3045
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,230
I just wanna be happy.

3046
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:16,750
No, not the box.

3047
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:17,010
Okay.

3048
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,470
The box!

3049
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:21,830
I nearly- I was nearly clicking it, too!

3050
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:25,990
My box needs to be down.

3051
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:27,070
Um...

3052
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:28,070
Okay.

3053
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:30,310
I'm here.

3054
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:31,830
This is all I am.

3055
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:34,170
I'm gonna sabotage.

3056
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:36,310
Box, stay here.

3057
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:36,870
Box, stay there.

3058
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:38,330
Nice box.

3059
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:38,750
Hi!

3060
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,470
Thanks.

3061
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:40,510
Thanks, slime.

3062
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:41,110
You want it?

3063
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:42,150
Push it over.

3064
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:42,670
There you go.

3065
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:43,130
There's your box.

3066
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:43,250
Oh, wow!

3067
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:44,170
Thank you!

3068
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:44,790
Yay!

3069
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:48,050
Wow, this has been the most teamwork I've ever seen.

3070
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:48,750
Hold on!

3071
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:51,810
Wait, wait.

3072
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:53,770
What are we supposed to walk out of that table?

3073
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:55,570
What are we doing here, bros?

3074
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:56,830
Wait, is it here?

3075
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:57,530
I don't know!

3076
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:58,770
I don't know.

3077
01:29:58,770 --> 01:29:59,670
Why are you taking it?

3078
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,490
I just put it there because I- No!

3079
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:07,650
I trusted you, Juniper!

3080
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,790
I didn't know what I was supposed to do!

3081
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:11,990
I thought you were doing something.

3082
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,750
I was like, what?

3083
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:15,110
That's not my color!

3084
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:15,930
I don't know!

3085
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:18,530
I don't know!

3086
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,610
You're freaking out!

3087
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,210
You're freaking out!

3088
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,290
I thought you needed the box!

3089
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:27,670
I thought you needed it!

3090
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:28,690
You're freaking out!

3091
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,110
Okay, click on your spot.

3092
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:39,790
Click on...

3093
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:39,850
Oh no!

3094
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,570
I wasn't paying attention!

3095
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:44,570
It's over.

3096
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:45,930
It's over.

3097
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:48,770
It's over with me.

3098
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:51,970
Can you just walk to me?

3099
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:53,050
Can you just walk to the right, Toki?

3100
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,430
I'm walking to the right.

3101
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:56,630
I can't move!

3102
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:57,970
Guys!

3103
01:30:59,250 --> 01:30:59,790
Guys!

3104
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,190
I can't even...

3105
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:04,110
I can't!

3106
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:17,910
Have the people with boxes move first.

3107
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:18,670
How about that?

3108
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:22,590
Someone vacuumed me right at the end.

3109
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:25,210
Someone let me out the way.

3110
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,490
Guys, okay.

3111
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:33,430
People with boxes, do your part and then we'll wait, okay?

3112
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:35,410
Everybody with a box moves.

3113
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:37,370
Box got to go down here.

3114
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,130
Box people move first.

3115
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:43,790
Don't and if you don't have a box don't touch the other people's boxes

3116
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:11,830
I look like I'm blocking.

3117
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:13,510
I'm feeling your face here.

3118
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:16,170
You had

3119
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:25,670
to go in the corner!

3120
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:27,690
What do you mean I wasn't there?

3121
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,150
I was locked the fuck in!

3122
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:31,850
Why you now?

3123
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:37,490
Wow, that was a good guess.

3124
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:38,770
I almost got it though.

3125
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,930
How did you figure that out, Snuffy?

3126
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:44,830
Okay, I'm locked in.

3127
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,210
I'm locked in.

3128
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:45,450
I'm locked in.

3129
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,530
I can't keep doing this.

3130
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,050
Okay, this is it.

3131
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:48,510
This is it.

3132
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:50,350
Okay, people with boxes go first.

3133
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:51,650
People with boxes go first.

3134
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:52,030
Okay, I have a box.

3135
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:52,570
I'm six.

3136
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,010
I'm six.

3137
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:53,830
Please let me go first.

3138
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:54,390
I'm going to the left.

3139
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:56,990
Okay, I'm going to stay here until ten seconds left.

3140
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:58,330
Please be kind.

3141
01:32:58,410 --> 01:32:59,290
I'm going to the left.

3142
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:00,430
Please, everybody, make way.

3143
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:00,730
Make way.

3144
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,150
Make way.

3145
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:05,330
Guys, I feel like some people without boxes went up, guys.

3146
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,010
Oh, my bad.

3147
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:09,490
Excuse me.

3148
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:10,130
Excuse me.

3149
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:10,830
Okay.

3150
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:12,610
Guys, I'm perfect now.

3151
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,510
Everything about my position and my box is perfect.

3152
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,290
Do not touch it, please.

3153
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:15,670
Okay.

3154
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,130
Okay.

3155
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:16,930
This is awkward.

3156
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:18,550
How do I do this?

3157
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,710
Here we go.

3158
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:19,990
I'm here.

3159
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:20,610
Don't touch mine.

3160
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:21,410
Don't touch mine.

3161
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,470
It's over.

3162
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:24,710
It's over.

3163
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:25,730
It's so over.

3164
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:26,130
It's over.

3165
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:26,690
What do you mean?

3166
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:27,450
What do you mean?

3167
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,630
What are you guys doing?

3168
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:29,670
What are you guys doing?

3169
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:30,150
What are you guys doing?

3170
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:30,570
What are you guys doing?

3171
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:37,250
Wait, how did the box get up there?

3172
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:40,230
It was so far away.

3173
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:42,090
Wait, the box was at the third level.

3174
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:43,490
It was supposed to be at the bottom.

3175
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:47,210
I didn't get up there.

3176
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:52,050
I didn't even get up there.

3177
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:53,670
It didn't even jump up because it was at the end.

3178
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:56,620
Okay.

3179
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:57,060
Okay.

3180
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,420
People with boxes go first.

3181
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,140
Yeah.

3182
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:01,440
Yeah.

3183
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:01,660
Yeah.

3184
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:01,900
Okay.

3185
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,640
None of us do anything.

3186
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,140
Val, if you need help, let me know.

3187
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:06,860
Okay.

3188
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,620
I'm down here with your box.

3189
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,520
Well, not with your box.

3190
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,480
Boxes go first.

3191
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,040
I have a box.

3192
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:12,120
All right.

3193
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:13,740
Hi-yah.

3194
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:14,620
Okay.

3195
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:15,220
Fuck.

3196
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,160
Okay, I'm good.

3197
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,080
Okay.

3198
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:20,480
Excuse me.

3199
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,960
Are you okay over there with the box, people?

3200
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:23,960
Here we go.

3201
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,560
My box is good.

3202
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,800
I'm heading over to my spot now.

3203
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,260
I'm heading...

3204
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:30,020
Okay.

3205
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:31,900
No, stop.

3206
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:33,980
Please don't move my box.

3207
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,140
Please move my box.

3208
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,020
Why is it...

3209
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:38,620
Why is it those two again?

3210
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:39,780
Why?

3211
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,220
Oh,

3212
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:46,400
yeah, yeah.

3213
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,380
Don't do that.

3214
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,120
Oh, I got it.

3215
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,210
There you go.

3216
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:56,510
Wow.

3217
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:56,650
There you go.

3218
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:58,050
You got your box.

3219
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,170
Oh, yeah.

3220
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:59,190
Yeah.

3221
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:00,350
Oh, I got it.

3222
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:00,530
Give me your box.

3223
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:00,730
Okay.

3224
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:02,330
You can hold your box.

3225
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:05,830
You can hold your box and jump up to the bottom floor.

3226
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:06,670
My jump.

3227
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:07,290
It doesn't go away.

3228
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,090
I'm going to die.

3229
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:08,670
Okay.

3230
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:08,990
Okay.

3231
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:11,410
My box is almost in the same position, okay?

3232
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:13,330
Just don't move my box!

3233
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:14,990
Dude, I have to go south!

3234
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:16,230
Okay, where am I?

3235
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:16,770
Okay, I'm not there.

3236
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:19,030
Alright, it's fine.

3237
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,710
Val doesn't have to move a box.

3238
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:22,090
And it's on the third floor.

3239
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:25,230
It's not on the third floor.

3240
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:27,090
Okay.

3241
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,270
Just make sure Red gets out of the ring.

3242
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:32,930
Okay, I'm gonna head over now.

3243
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:33,650
No, no, no!

3244
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:34,450
Don't move it!

3245
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:34,830
Don't move it!

3246
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:35,530
Don't move it!

3247
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,130
Don't move it!

3248
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:36,710
Okay!

3249
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:37,510
Watch out!

3250
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,670
I'm here!

3251
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:41,150
Okay, leave it there!

3252
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:43,750
Okay!

3253
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,470
Wait, I need to be in between!

3254
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:46,970
Thank you!

3255
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:47,350
Thank you!

3256
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:47,590
No!

3257
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,750
There you go!

3258
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:49,090
There you go!

3259
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,050
Holy shit!

3260
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:51,930
Holy shit!

3261
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:53,570
Oh, is this it?

3262
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,270
Is this it?

3263
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:59,010
It's so close, but I don't think it's close enough, Rose!

3264
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,230
I don't think it's close enough!

3265
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:00,750
I think it is!

3266
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,130
I think it is!

3267
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,070
Are we free?

3268
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,810
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!

3269
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:06,170
Oh, I'm good!

3270
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,530
I'm good!

3271
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,810
This is it!

3272
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:08,630
This is it!

3273
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:08,770
This is it!

3274
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:09,890
Yay!

3275
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:25,110
Let's go!

3276
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:26,430
Yay!

3277
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:28,790
Am I crying in your arms right now?

3278
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:30,530
Oh my god!

3279
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:32,450
This is so funny!

3280
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:36,070
Wait, hold on!

3281
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:36,890
Shit!

3282
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:39,410
Wait, okay, I was gonna be like that!

3283
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:41,030
It's so fun to be sad!

3284
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:41,610
Get out!

3285
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,210
Rose, please!

3286
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:48,370
Oh my god!

3287
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:49,890
Guys, it's...

3288
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:56,430
It hasn't even been two hours!

3289
01:36:56,910 --> 01:37:01,050
It's almost two hours and we completed three worlds out of thirteen!

3290
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:02,930
That's good!

3291
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,130
I agree!

3292
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:08,350
Who said we don't have a stream until we finish?

3293
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:09,150
We should open an academy!

3294
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:11,470
Okay, what is this?

3295
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,050
What the fuck is this?

3296
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:13,790
Stack?

3297
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:14,890
Stack?

3298
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:17,970
Don't touch the top!

3299
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:19,390
Don't touch the top!

3300
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,110
Don't touch the squiggly lines!

3301
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:23,510
Oh, I think it's gonna go down!

3302
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:24,490
That's a trick!

3303
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:25,190
There's a trick!

3304
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,070
I'm sorry!

3305
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:27,570
Oh...

3306
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:32,290
Time to take the easy way out!

3307
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:33,650
How do we...?

3308
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:38,150
I think you have to do it with as few people as possible.

3309
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,930
So that there's only one layer maybe?

3310
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,850
I think only four people could fit.

3311
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:42,890
Yes.

3312
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:45,250
I mean, it's still past the key though.

3313
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:48,170
I mean, it's still past the key though.

3314
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:51,010
I assume hopefully that the blocks will come back up when the washing is done.

3315
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:53,090
Yeah, I think there's like one person.

3316
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:54,610
You have to be alive.

3317
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:56,530
It's just a population check.

3318
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,010
A population check?

3319
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:01,390
Okay, we need one more over there.

3320
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:04,370
I will make the sacrifice.

3321
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:06,410
You got this.

3322
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:06,890
Go four.

3323
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,410
Four, four, four!

3324
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:10,030
Line, line, line, line!

3325
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:11,690
Okay, there, there, there.

3326
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:13,430
Okay.

3327
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:16,170
If this is wrong, then I guess you will die, which sucks.

3328
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:17,390
There's no way.

3329
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:18,850
I'll miss you.

3330
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,570
I'll miss you!

3331
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:21,990
I'll miss you!

3332
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:27,690
I know, I know, I know, because it can't kill you so you like stand in between.

3333
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:30,450
We stand in between the thing that goes down.

3334
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:31,710
We stand in between the doors.

3335
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:34,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we stand in between the doors.

3336
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:36,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we need like...

3337
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:38,090
So I'll...

3338
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:39,850
We need standers.

3339
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:42,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we need people to block the door here.

3340
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:43,990
The game was only made for four players.

3341
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,570
Okay, so we need one more, we need one more.

3342
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:47,730
We need one more to be up here.

3343
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:49,730
Yeah, we need another key.

3344
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we need you to be up here.

3345
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,930
Okay, now grab the key and then you guys...

3346
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:54,550
Yeah, yeah, alright.

3347
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:57,770
You need to block the door.

3348
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,190
Yeah, there we go, there we go.

3349
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:01,370
Position, position, perfect.

3350
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:02,710
Okay.

3351
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,890
Okay, and then...

3352
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,750
Oh...

3353
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:10,010
Oh...

3354
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:10,450
Oh...

3355
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:12,090
Oh...

3356
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:13,690
Oh...

3357
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:13,810
Oh...

3358
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,550
You win this time, Ely!

3359
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:21,810
You win this time, Ely!

3360
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:23,210
You get annihilated.

3361
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:28,070
You get annihilated.

3362
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:29,870
Oh, thanks for that!

3363
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:33,210
If you live in music, you messed up.

3364
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,590
Yeah, that's true.

3365
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,370
Okay, everybody up, everybody up.

3366
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:40,050
I'll be at the last door, I'll be at the last door.

3367
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:41,570
No, no, no, no.

3368
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:45,430
I can time this better.

3369
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:46,630
No, it's okay.

3370
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:48,990
Alright, you be at the last door.

3371
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:50,470
I don't want the pressure.

3372
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,830
Sorry.

3373
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:53,070
Hi, Snuffy.

3374
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:54,370
Hi, meow.

3375
01:39:54,370 --> 01:39:56,270
Okay, everybody, meow, meow.

3376
01:39:57,070 --> 01:39:59,370
Okay, we must start slightly.

3377
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,770
There we go, there we go.

3378
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:01,670
Okay.

3379
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:02,670
Okay.

3380
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:06,870
You scooch, you scooch.

3381
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,510
There we go.

3382
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,710
Okay, okay, okay.

3383
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:12,610
Keep scooching, keep scooching.

3384
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:14,410
Keep scooching, keep scooching.

3385
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:18,210
Let's go.

3386
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,210
I forgot what color I was.

3387
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:22,850
How did you clean this color?

3388
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:28,590
You forgot.

3389
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:34,310
We need a little bit of excitement.

3390
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:37,330
A little bit of suspense.

3391
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:39,230
Oh, not you again.

3392
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:41,230
Wait, what's this?

3393
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:43,050
He's not attached to anything.

3394
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,630
In fairness, I think this is the first time they've shown up.

3395
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:46,850
That's probably gonna fall off.

3396
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:50,610
Is he gonna, like, start pinballing?

3397
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,410
He turned into Sonic the Hedgehog.

3398
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:59,490
Wait, I think we can stack it.

3399
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:00,650
I think we should stack.

3400
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:02,730
Stack to four?

3401
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:06,070
Yeah, and then one goes right and the other goes left?

3402
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:06,450
Maybe?

3403
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,250
Or, like, we all go right.

3404
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:11,170
It's moving around like a pinball.

3405
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:12,370
Yeah, it goes crazy.

3406
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:15,210
Or we can all stack it up.

3407
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:16,190
We can all stack it up.

3408
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:19,290
Wait, what's this over here?

3409
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:20,790
Pick the key!

3410
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:22,250
Go, go, go!

3411
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,870
Oh, what the fuck?

3412
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:27,790
Okay, so, they can't go past that.

3413
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:28,350
Which is good.

3414
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,630
They go right first.

3415
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,170
So, maybe, like...

3416
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,530
Oh, I see, I see.

3417
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:37,630
Let's see.

3418
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:40,670
One person goes up and gets the key.

3419
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:42,350
Wait, actually, no.

3420
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:44,230
Because then it goes back to us.

3421
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:46,290
Can we see what the box does first?

3422
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:47,090
Yeah, yeah.

3423
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:50,290
No, no, no, don't touch it, don't touch it.

3424
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:53,270
Okay, what if we just push the box?

3425
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:53,810
We'll push it, yeah.

3426
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:54,590
Okay.

3427
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:57,590
Alright,

3428
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:04,910
we pushed the box.

3429
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:06,170
Nobody jump, guys.

3430
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:07,210
I know it's very tempting.

3431
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:11,170
Okay, we need you to push the box.

3432
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:19,790
No, that's not gonna help.

3433
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:20,450
Okay, okay.

3434
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:23,390
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3435
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,970
Wait, wait, wait.

3436
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:25,130
Okay.

3437
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:29,970
And then we push the sword away from the door.

3438
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:31,170
Wait, we have one here, too.

3439
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:34,270
And this one is for the other one that comes down.

3440
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:34,890
Oh, okay.

3441
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:35,210
Oh, I see.

3442
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:37,310
Push it this way.

3443
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:37,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3444
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:41,310
Push it closer to us.

3445
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:41,790
Here, hold on.

3446
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,450
Push it like...

3447
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,550
I don't know where the other saw a spawn.

3448
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:50,170
Okay, one of you guys get it then.

3449
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:51,610
One of you guys get the key.

3450
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,130
Wait, wait, wait.

3451
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:55,310
We can push it towards the key.

3452
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:56,610
Oh, yeah, okay.

3453
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,730
Oh, I see.

3454
01:42:58,830 --> 01:42:59,910
It's to block the blades.

3455
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:03,410
Don't jump, guys.

3456
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:03,930
Don't jump.

3457
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,670
There's no key.

3458
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:05,130
It's over there.

3459
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:09,190
Guys, we have to get that one block.

3460
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:11,090
We still have to get that one block, guys.

3461
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:13,910
Okay, nice.

3462
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:14,990
Nice.

3463
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:17,810
Alright, I am gonna push to the left.

3464
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:19,510
I'm pushing.

3465
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:22,350
Pass where the key is, I think, right?

3466
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:23,410
I don't know.

3467
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:24,510
Okay, here.

3468
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:25,470
Alright.

3469
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:26,890
Yeah, pass through the key.

3470
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,530
No, no, no.

3471
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:30,370
We want it here.

3472
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:31,510
Yeah, yeah.

3473
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:32,550
Grab the key.

3474
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,170
It'll bounce on the block and then we get it to safety.

3475
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:35,590
Nice, okay.

3476
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:36,810
No, keep pushing it.

3477
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:37,310
Keep pushing it.

3478
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:38,670
And it can't go past the block, right?

3479
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:40,170
Oh, my God.

3480
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:41,290
We're so smart, guys.

3481
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:41,770
Let's go.

3482
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,010
Okay, let's go.

3483
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:46,230
Keep pushing.

3484
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:49,150
We can still keep technically.

3485
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:51,250
Yeah, yeah.

3486
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:53,350
Alright, pass the key.

3487
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:55,110
Oh, oh, oh.

3488
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:56,150
Oh, oh, oh.

3489
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:58,530
Alright, here's the hardest part of the game.

3490
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:59,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3491
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:03,210
Yay.

3492
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:06,170
We did it.

3493
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:07,510
We're victorious.

3494
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:09,990
Wow, World 3?

3495
01:44:11,230 --> 01:44:11,990
Alright, here we go.

3496
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:13,190
This is so easy.

3497
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:21,330
Okay, we gotta stack.

3498
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,930
We gotta stack.

3499
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:23,210
And not get hit.

3500
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:24,470
Okay, I got hit.

3501
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:27,350
I didn't even see where I spawned first.

3502
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:28,270
I didn't even see where I spawned first.

3503
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:30,330
This is so fast.

3504
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:31,150
What the heck?

3505
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,870
If we don't move, does it start?

3506
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3507
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:37,250
Are you sure?

3508
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:38,090
Oh, wait.

3509
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,470
Don't move, guys.

3510
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:42,610
Don't touch your keyboard.

3511
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,210
We'll see.

3512
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:44,510
Yup, it does.

3513
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:45,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3514
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:46,350
Okay.

3515
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:50,510
We just gotta dodge all of them.

3516
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:53,350
Okay, I got it.

3517
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:53,930
Okay, so it falls.

3518
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:54,830
It keeps falling.

3519
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:55,850
What the heck?

3520
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:58,790
Okay, so memorize how it falls.

3521
01:45:00,030 --> 01:45:00,550
Okay.

3522
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:02,470
I'm being attacked by someone.

3523
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,770
The third one is something.

3524
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:06,930
Yeah, this is messed up.

3525
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:08,030
Oh, yo.

3526
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:09,930
Okay, we almost figured it out.

3527
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:10,790
We almost figured it out.

3528
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,870
We also killed three people.

3529
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:14,130
I need to jump through the key.

3530
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:16,710
Oh my god, timing sucks.

3531
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:20,410
We can get the key afterwards by stacking.

3532
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:21,990
Yeah, yeah, I don't think we have to.

3533
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:23,210
Oh, I'm fine.

3534
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,450
We should dodge it.

3535
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:26,690
I know where I have to go.

3536
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:29,890
You guys gotta figure out where you have to land that was the safest.

3537
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:31,030
Ouch.

3538
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:31,930
Fine.

3539
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:36,470
I just have to move like a little.

3540
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:37,490
Oh, whoops.

3541
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:38,690
Ouch.

3542
01:45:41,070 --> 01:45:42,930
I just have to move a little bit.

3543
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:43,250
Oh, you're dead.

3544
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:45,430
Oh, never mind.

3545
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:49,290
Kind of maybe.

3546
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:51,810
Okay.

3547
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:53,510
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo.

3548
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:56,330
Okay, it was just me so I didn't fuck it up.

3549
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:56,590
You were so close.

3550
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:57,890
Hmm.

3551
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:00,530
Oh.

3552
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:05,770
I gotta like jump and then hang really far to the left, I guess?

3553
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:07,250
Or can I jump over?

3554
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:09,670
Alright, I'm fine here.

3555
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:13,890
Do you want to be the one to be on the bottom or do you want me?

3556
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:14,190
This is good.

3557
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:14,910
This is good.

3558
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:16,990
Okay, you got it.

3559
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:20,150
Okay, we can't fuck this up.

3560
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:22,630
We can't fuck this up, guys.

3561
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:23,390
Yes, we can.

3562
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,030
Yes, we can.

3563
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:25,170
No, we cannot.

3564
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:26,030
I can't move.

3565
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,830
We will issue that kind of challenge.

3566
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:28,490
Okay.

3567
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:29,270
There we go.

3568
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:29,590
There we go.

3569
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:30,250
There we go.

3570
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:32,810
We can't fuck this up.

3571
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:33,750
No, be careful.

3572
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:34,890
Don't jump.

3573
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:37,930
I'm not moving until you're inside.

3574
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:39,650
Don't jump.

3575
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:39,650
I'm not moving until you're inside.

3576
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,510
Don't jump.

3577
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:40,510
I'm not moving until you're inside.

3578
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:41,530
Until you're in there.

3579
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:49,310
We actually did that surprisingly very quickly than I expected.

3580
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:49,830
Yeah, yeah.

3581
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:54,210
Okay, this might be our last one.

3582
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:55,330
So, let's pray.

3583
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,790
Let's all just pray.

3584
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:58,930
Is it because you said that?

3585
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:01,810
For me!

3586
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:02,910
It's 1 AM.

3587
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:04,050
I'm not meant to be here.

3588
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,930
I'm not meant to be here.

3589
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:07,190
We spawned in differently.

3590
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:07,790
Okay.

3591
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,730
One at a time.

3592
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,650
This has to be one at a time here.

3593
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:13,410
One at a time.

3594
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:13,410
This has to be one at a time here.

3595
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:14,250
Very carefully, yes.

3596
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,650
Only one person can go through per line.

3597
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:19,550
Well, not... Okay.

3598
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:21,950
I could fall through.

3599
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:23,190
I thought I could fall through.

3600
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,390
No.

3601
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:26,350
All right.

3602
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:29,150
All the people at the far end can just run off.

3603
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:29,410
All right.

3604
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:29,410
All the people at the far end can just run off.

3605
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:29,410
Yeah.

3606
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:30,830
And then...

3607
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:32,070
You guys can just run.

3608
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:34,610
Oh, you can stop.

3609
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:38,510
I think you have to wait until we're off of it before you go forward.

3610
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:39,470
I think you have to wait until we're off of it before you go forward.

3611
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:39,870
Yeah, yeah.

3612
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:41,170
Because you have to do like...

3613
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:45,770
I'll go get the key here.

3614
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:45,950
I'll go get the key here.

3615
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:46,010
Okay.

3616
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:48,310
You guys can go off with the next one.

3617
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:50,830
All right.

3618
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:51,430
And then you wait.

3619
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:52,910
Oh, we go?

3620
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:54,470
And then now you go.

3621
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:57,630
It's a little bit delicate.

3622
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:59,170
It's very delicate.

3623
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:01,630
All right.

3624
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:02,970
Okay.

3625
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:04,230
I'll get the key, baby.

3626
01:48:04,570 --> 01:48:05,150
I don't know actually.

3627
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:05,550
I'm scared.

3628
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:06,550
I'm scared.

3629
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:09,570
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.

3630
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,950
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

3631
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:11,510
Okay, Bao.

3632
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:12,910
We gotta move forward, Bao.

3633
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:14,530
We're trapped here.

3634
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:15,350
Okay.

3635
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:19,110
It was a lie.

3636
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:20,190
It's okay.

3637
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:23,010
We can do this.

3638
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:24,790
I'll get the key.

3639
01:48:25,090 --> 01:48:26,490
You nestled in my dent and I betrayed you.

3640
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:26,890
I'm sorry.

3641
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,030
Oh, fuck, bitch.

3642
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:30,090
Did you jump?

3643
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,850
I'm so excited.

3644
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:36,610
Okay.

3645
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:38,910
We're so happy.

3646
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:39,630
Sorry.

3647
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:39,650
Sorry.

3648
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:40,190
Sorry.

3649
01:48:40,190 --> 01:48:40,710
Sorry.

3650
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,110
Sorry.

3651
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:55,080
My turn.

3652
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,020
One person get the key, go unlock the door.

3653
01:48:59,160 --> 01:48:59,480
Okay.

3654
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,140
Here I'll go.

3655
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,400
I swear my brain is fucking slurry right now.

3656
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,860
I trust Bao.

3657
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,600
Oh, no.

3658
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:13,840
She didn't even finish the sentence yet.

3659
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,360
She didn't even finish the sentence yet.

3660
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,480
Okay.

3661
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,900
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

3662
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,680
One person get the key.

3663
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:20,940
I'm so happy now.

3664
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:22,180
All right.

3665
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,300
Here we go.

3666
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:25,380
Cut.

3667
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,660
That was all me, Jamie.

3668
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,420
We can stack, guys.

3669
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,100
You don't have to do it by two, guys.

3670
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,880
You guys can stack over there.

3671
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,560
I'm just not gonna move.

3672
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:38,980
All right.

3673
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:40,300
Here we go.

3674
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,320
Oh, my God.

3675
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:42,820
Whoa, whoa.

3676
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:43,080
Okay.

3677
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:44,320
All right.

3678
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,300
We can stack.

3679
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:46,580
I got the key.

3680
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,860
Wait, but... wait, but...

3681
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:53,700
No one's got the key.

3682
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,980
No one's got the key.

3683
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:55,980
Not anymore, man.

3684
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:57,400
Not anymore.

3685
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,860
It might be safer to just go through individually.

3686
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:00,880
Okay.

3687
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,460
No, because that's too much risk.

3688
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:04,900
I would be so sad.

3689
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:08,200
That's like five times more.

3690
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,020
Yeah.

3691
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,840
That's too much.

3692
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:11,600
Okay.

3693
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:12,400
All right.

3694
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,780
Let's have designated...

3695
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:14,460
Yeah.

3696
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,360
Designated bottoms.

3697
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:18,220
Designated bottoms.

3698
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,680
Yeah.

3699
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:20,080
Designated bottoms.

3700
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,020
I haven't died yet to the lines.

3701
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:25,920
Ooh, that disqualifies pretty much everybody, I think.

3702
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:26,240
I've never died.

3703
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:26,280
Okay.

3704
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:26,680
All right.

3705
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,780
You can't be a top.

3706
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,700
You can't be a top.

3707
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,240
All right.

3708
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:38,060
I nominate Lime to be one of the designated bottoms.

3709
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:40,280
I nominate Lime to be one of the designated bottoms.

3710
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:40,540
All right.

3711
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,740
All right.

3712
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:45,380
Everybody that's not cannot be a bottom anymore.

3713
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:46,740
Everybody that's not cannot be a bottom anymore.

3714
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,660
Everybody that's not cannot be a bottom anymore.

3715
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:51,080
All right, girls.

3716
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,200
All right.

3717
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:52,940
Stack time.

3718
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:53,540
Okay.

3719
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,640
Snoopy, I think we can fit one more if you...

3720
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:56,740
Oh.

3721
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,140
Okay.

3722
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,440
All right.

3723
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:01,000
Here we go.

3724
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:02,820
We can remake the bottom.

3725
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,000
We can remake it.

3726
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,940
I don't know if...

3727
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:06,500
Okay, Rin.

3728
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:08,560
Let's see you...

3729
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,900
Oh, okay.

3730
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:11,660
Okay.

3731
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,100
Are we giving up their bow?

3732
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,600
Are you okay?

3733
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,580
For so long, I forgot what...

3734
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:19,360
What happened.

3735
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:27,180
How are we gonna get through the lasers at the end?

3736
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:27,760
What the fuck?

3737
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,040
How did you die?

3738
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:30,360
You know what?

3739
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:30,900
I'm gonna stop.

3740
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,480
I apologize.

3741
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,760
Are you okay?

3742
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:42,040
I'll be waiting for four more apologies from every single one of you on my desk by next Monday.

3743
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:42,940
Okay.

3744
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,600
I get one.

3745
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,620
Everybody gets one.

3746
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:46,400
That was my one.

3747
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,180
I literally... That was the first time!

3748
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:48,700
Shut up!

3749
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:48,980
Shut up!

3750
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,440
That was literally my first time!

3751
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:54,320
Okay.

3752
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,420
I don't wanna get the key anymore.

3753
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:56,880
Okay.

3754
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:57,480
Someone else can.

3755
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:57,740
Let's go.

3756
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,860
I got this.

3757
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:00,580
Okay.

3758
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:01,460
Yeah.

3759
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:04,720
I feel like our tanks are leaning a little bit too far to the right.

3760
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:05,820
All right.

3761
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,920
Yeah, this is better.

3762
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,320
This is better.

3763
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,440
All right.

3764
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,140
You guys stack up.

3765
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,620
They don't even look like cat in lockdown.

3766
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:12,840
Just like skulls.

3767
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:13,540
All right.

3768
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:14,220
You guys ready?

3769
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:15,520
We're talking to you, Doki.

3770
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:15,940
I love you!

3771
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,040
All right.

3772
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:17,660
Okay.

3773
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,480
Okay.

3774
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:19,020
Okay.

3775
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:19,880
Okay.

3776
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:25,020
Are we really?

3777
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:32,720
Guys.

3778
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,280
Guys.

3779
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,400
I've had a revelation.

3780
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:34,900
Here.

3781
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:35,500
Get on me.

3782
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:41,760
The taller the towers are, the easier it is to align them with the green cubes.

3783
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:42,540
Yes.

3784
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,040
Exactly.

3785
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:44,340
This is like rescuing me.

3786
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,060
It's crispy.

3787
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:47,100
Here we go.

3788
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,540
Everybody's bringing everything up.

3789
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,160
Wait, Bal can you inch over so that your ink can tear?

3790
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:51,280
Yes.

3791
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:51,560
All right.

3792
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,360
Here we go.

3793
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,000
Why doesn't it keep.

3794
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:58,600
If it touches it.

3795
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,940
Ugh, that is scary.

3796
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:01,980
Oh, my God.

3797
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,480
It was such a small margin.

3798
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,220
We had to be perfectly lined up.

3799
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:11,260
Yeah, that's what I was... yeah, yeah, yeah.

3800
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:15,360
Be like so perfect, like make sure that your bottom and my bottom are aligned.

3801
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,660
Alright, here we go.

3802
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,640
You can line them up with like the feet and the ears.

3803
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:24,240
Alright, you guys go forward first just in case we do all that and then we die.

3804
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,160
I don't appreciate how that tower is leaning.

3805
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:26,680
Okay.

3806
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:29,880
Just call your tower bad, Avalee.

3807
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,820
Well, sometimes it's like you're going to live with it.

3808
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,400
I realized it as I said it.

3809
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,060
Alright, here you go.

3810
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:37,480
Oh my god.

3811
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,680
I'm watching you.

3812
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,400
Orange, get it together, orange.

3813
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:45,340
Yeah, I want to join in.

3814
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:47,000
Oh my god.

3815
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,200
I believe.

3816
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:55,360
I believe.

3817
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,200
Okay, okay.

3818
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:59,220
Jump on Snuffy.

3819
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:02,300
Oh, I don't think she's going to get on.

3820
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,220
It's all on her.

3821
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,800
She doesn't want me to bottom anymore.

3822
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:07,520
Get it!

3823
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:10,920
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3824
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,720
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3825
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:15,720
I like how Juniper is just watching her.

3826
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,760
Oh, there it is.

3827
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:17,120
I'm watching.

3828
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:20,860
If she dies, please, please, I'll remember her face.

3829
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:22,840
The last... you just know it.

3830
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:23,900
You can't fuck that up.

3831
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,500
Okay, Juniper, our girl.

3832
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:28,120
End of challenge.

3833
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:28,940
Get through the goal.

3834
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,540
Oh my god.

3835
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,120
I'm so proud of you.

3836
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,120
I'm so proud of all of you.

3837
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:36,920
With love and envy.

3838
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,440
We did it.

3839
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,700
We completed the goal for team building exercise.

3840
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:42,500
We did it.

3841
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,500
Oh my god.

3842
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,540
We did it.

3843
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:49,000
You guys, I was shrimping so hard over my keyboard.

3844
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,260
Prominent spinal damage from this one.

3845
01:54:58,260 --> 01:54:59,680
What special park?

3846
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:01,120
Yeah, let's do this.

3847
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,720
This should be our last one.

3848
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,660
It says special park.

3849
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:06,740
What makes it so special?

3850
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:07,300
One level.

3851
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,000
Okay.

3852
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:08,680
Okay.

3853
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,580
What makes it so special?

3854
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,320
Oh, one.

3855
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:15,900
It's...

3856
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:20,980
Oh my god.

3857
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:22,320
It's squid game.

3858
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:22,880
It's squid game.

3859
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,040
That's why it's so special.

3860
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:28,920
Alright.

3861
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:29,980
Okay.

3862
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,880
There's one button that's dead.

3863
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,380
The pressure.

3864
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:35,920
The pressure.

3865
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:37,020
Oh my god.

3866
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:38,700
Oh, I didn't...

3867
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:39,880
I won.

3868
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:40,700
Oh.

3869
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:43,780
Go ahead.

3870
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,300
Of course it was you two.

3871
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,020
We have to just get it right.

3872
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:50,720
Oh.

3873
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:54,900
Let's do it again.

3874
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,100
Just get it right.

3875
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:57,360
That's crazy.

3876
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,240
How bad can it be?

3877
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:00,720
What if you just won?

3878
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,780
We'll be the last person to...

3879
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:05,120
This is an evil game.

3880
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,720
Oh, hey guys.

3881
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:07,920
We're doing really well.

3882
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,980
Now this is what I call Pico Park 2.

3883
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:13,420
Oh no.

3884
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:14,820
Please.

3885
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,460
Oh no.

3886
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,040
There's just three of us.

3887
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:18,300
Oh my god.

3888
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:19,360
No pressure.

3889
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,340
Oh my god.

3890
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:20,700
No pressure.

3891
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:21,140
No pressure.

3892
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:21,760
There's just three of us.

3893
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:23,860
It's like a 50-50 chance.

3894
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,600
You win these.

3895
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,580
There's like so many buttons.

3896
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:28,160
It's okay.

3897
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:29,740
So many buttons.

3898
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:30,140
Alright.

3899
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:31,740
Yeah, yeah.

3900
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:32,920
Sophie, I put you in you.

3901
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:35,140
No, that's our...

3902
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:35,460
Okay.

3903
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,100
No.

3904
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:41,640
You got this.

3905
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,700
I love my family.

3906
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:44,300
It's that one.

3907
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:44,740
It's that one.

3908
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,080
Okay.

3909
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:46,700
Okay.

3910
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,720
Or would it be that?

3911
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:54,200
Or would it be this?

3912
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:58,880
Or would it be this?

3913
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,880
Or would it be this?

3914
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:02,680
Or would it be this?

3915
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,000
Oh, thank god.

3916
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,200
Thank god.

3917
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:09,040
Be nice

3918
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:28,650
to us.

3919
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:35,260
We thought Pico Park was going to take mercy on us, did ya?

3920
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,100
Oh, that's interesting.

3921
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:37,720
No way.

3922
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,340
There's no way.

3923
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:51,490
I saw the fucking buttons weren't pressed right before Min hit one and I was like they wouldn't.

3924
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:52,450
They fucking didn't.

3925
01:57:55,810 --> 01:57:57,190
That's actually crazy.

3926
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,870
I was like so happy.

3927
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,310
I was like hopping along.

3928
01:58:01,490 --> 01:58:05,250
You were so happy you started glowing and I was like no.

3929
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:07,010
No!

3930
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:12,550
Bless you.

3931
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:19,310
Well, there's no way Min hits the first one.

3932
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:20,290
Yeah, there's no way.

3933
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:21,090
Right, right, right.

3934
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:21,690
She's this one.

3935
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:23,110
This one.

3936
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:23,310
This one.

3937
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:23,530
This one.

3938
01:58:23,650 --> 01:58:23,750
Oh.

3939
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:26,030
Pick this one.

3940
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,650
This one's okay.

3941
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:27,750
That one's okay.

3942
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:28,930
You think so?

3943
01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:30,330
Alright, I'm gonna pick this one.

3944
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:30,930
On your advice.

3945
01:58:31,210 --> 01:58:31,470
Yeah.

3946
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:38,350
It was a one out of ten chance.

3947
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:40,610
Wow, the orangey dodge.

3948
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:42,430
This one's safe.

3949
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:43,010
I swear.

3950
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:43,830
I swear.

3951
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,390
This one's safe.

3952
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:47,130
This one's safe.

3953
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:47,830
I swear.

3954
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,690
I swear.

3955
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:49,950
This one's safe.

3956
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:50,410
See?

3957
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:51,670
I told you.

3958
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:54,650
Oh my god.

3959
01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:57,730
Good vibes on this one.

3960
01:58:58,690 --> 01:58:59,390
Yeah, yeah.

3961
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:01,130
I'm not fucking around.

3962
01:59:01,310 --> 01:59:02,890
I'm just going for the one nearest to the door.

3963
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:05,510
If I can get down, please.

3964
01:59:08,370 --> 01:59:10,670
Okay, I wanna get the close.

3965
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:11,670
I wanna hear this fucking song in my sleep.

3966
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:15,290
There we go.

3967
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:16,730
Are you having fun yet?

3968
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:19,310
Three left.

3969
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:21,270
Oh no, it's just, oh no.

3970
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:23,330
She's like, let's go gambling.

3971
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:25,790
Aw, dang it.

3972
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,150
Aw, dang it.

3973
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,470
Aw, dang it.

3974
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:30,450
Oh no.

3975
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:31,410
I'm scared.

3976
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:32,110
Why am I last?

3977
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:34,690
No pressure or anything.

3978
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:35,770
The last one.

3979
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:37,650
Alright.

3980
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,490
Oh, good one.

3981
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:41,430
Maybe there's no one nearest the door.

3982
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:42,570
Maybe.

3983
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:44,330
Okay, yeah.

3984
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:45,250
I'll go for this one.

3985
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:45,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3986
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:46,830
So we can all walk there.

3987
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:47,790
So we all know it's safe.

3988
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:50,190
Dude, the pause.

3989
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,530
The pause they did.

3990
01:59:52,730 --> 01:59:53,230
Okay, okay, okay.

3991
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:55,710
Look how we all waited.

3992
01:59:58,650 --> 01:59:59,170
Alright.

3993
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,200
We did it.

3994
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,540
We did it.

3995
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:11,340
No more.

3996
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:12,300
No more.

3997
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:13,640
Oh my god.

3998
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,400
I'm so proud of us.

3999
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:17,360
See, we can.

4000
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,680
This game doesn't stop until we do all 13 levels.

4001
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,200
You're a psycho.

4002
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,140
A psycho.

4003
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,220
You're sick in the head.

4004
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:28,140
Some of us have families, okay?

4005
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:32,240
Imagine we had to listen to that soundtrack for two more hours.

4006
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:34,360
Imagine we had to do that.

4007
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,320
Even more than two hours, I think.

4008
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,920
I came already this far.

4009
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,080
We might as well just finish the game.

4010
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,500
I can keep going too.

4011
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:42,140
Alright.

4012
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:46,660
Can we actually finish this game with seven of us?

4013
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:47,740
I think we can.

4014
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,740
I thought we were meant to be friends.

4015
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:54,360
Well, we're not quitters.

4016
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,520
Well, we're not quitters.

4017
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:00,160
Endurance scream.

4018
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,420
Unfortunately for 10% of gamblers, it is their bedtime now, so...

4019
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,480
Good night, gamblers.

4020
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:09,460
Good night.

4021
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,580
Good night.

4022
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:11,300
Good night.

4023
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:15,780
Good night, old man.

4024
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:16,720
Good night.

4025
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:17,380
Good night.

4026
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:20,580
Kids these days, honestly.

4027
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:21,040
God.

4028
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:25,180
Alright.

4029
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,640
Are we actually completing this game?

4030
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,440
I'm doubting.

4031
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:31,880
Wait, are we actually?

4032
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:32,580
Are we actually?

4033
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:36,560
We can do it another day, right?

4034
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:38,840
You know, for the sake of our brains, right?

4035
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,340
Alright, Rin.

4036
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:43,880
If we're gonna do another day, you have to be there till the very end.

4037
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:45,120
Okay.

4038
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:45,960
You have to...

4039
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:48,400
Oh my god.

4040
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,440
John Pico will come to your house.

4041
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:50,700
Yeah.

4042
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,200
Send us to five of your friends.

4043
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:54,840
Okay.

4044
02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,300
We will schedule Pico Park 2 and we're going...

4045
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:01,600
Pico Park 2.

4046
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:06,180
And we have to do it until we finish.

4047
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:10,180
We got clear entire schedule just for this game.

4048
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:11,740
The entire day.

4049
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,380
Entire day.

4050
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,200
Just to finish this game.

4051
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:18,760
No food.

4052
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:19,800
Tower up.

4053
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:21,300
No food.

4054
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,420
No food.

4055
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:28,500
We only get rewarded until we beat it.

4056
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,000
We need a 15 minute bathroom break.

4057
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:33,840
You gotta hold it until we beat it.

4058
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:37,460
You got one ration, one bathroom break.

4059
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,440
The only pee you can have is Pico Park 2.

4060
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:40,520
Wow.

4061
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:46,240
If you didn't get a gamer bottle, you're not committed.

4062
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:48,940
Everyone ship a special gamer chair.

4063
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:49,880
Yeah.

4064
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:53,280
A special gamer chair just for Pico Park.

4065
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,600
You get one meal and one plastic bottle.

4066
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:56,680
Yeah.

4067
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,900
Sit the hell down.

4068
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,020
Alright, alright.

4069
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:03,300
You know, normal people play video games for fun.

4070
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:05,140
This is worse than the Marines.

4071
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:06,800
Okay.

4072
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:10,380
Part 2 is going to be an endurance stream.

4073
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,340
We are all committed, right?

4074
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,620
We all swear no.

4075
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:20,260
We're all into a blood pack until we cannot leave.

4076
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:23,420
We hope you guys have your rabies shot.

4077
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:27,860
I hope we can start a little earlier than 11pm.

4078
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:33,340
If we end, if it takes us 6 hours, it'll take us 6 hours.

4079
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,400
But we'll all be here.

4080
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:39,280
If we hate each other by the end of it, then that's just a sacrifice we gotta be willing to make.

4081
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:42,640
A flow of poison is slowly dripping into our veins.

4082
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,200
We need to beat it before the time limit.

4083
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,940
It's like we're going to make a saw event out of this.

4084
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:53,400
I mean, that's basically Pico Pops.

4085
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:58,160
Alright, GG's everybody.

4086
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,840
GG's, I'll see you guys.

4087
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,600
I'll see you guys for part 2.

4088
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,340
GG's everyone.

4089
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,400
GG's.

4090
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,400
Bye guys.

4091
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:13,260
Bye.

4092
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:17,340
Oh my god.

4093
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:18,140
I did not...

4094
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:21,580
I didn't think we were going to come back to this game, but I guess we are.

4095
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:25,300
Okay.

4096
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:26,980
That was fun.

4097
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:28,300
That was really fun.

4098
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:32,460
I had a great time playing with the girls again.

4099
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,480
I...

4100
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,060
It's just the same.

4101
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:40,000
The same one music track.

4102
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,080
Two actually.

4103
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,520
One with the main menu.

4104
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:45,680
So the same two music tracks.

4105
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:52,370
But huge shout out to the girls.

4106
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:55,990
For... Oh, I'm the only one left.

4107
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:58,890
For wanting to do another collab together.

4108
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:00,910
I had a great time.

4109
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:03,310
You know.

4110
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:04,830
Two hours.

4111
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,950
The music hasn't numbed my brain yet.

4112
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:11,870
So I'm pretty sure by part 2 I will be very...

4113
02:05:11,870 --> 02:05:13,490
My brain's going to be like...

4114
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:14,730
Liquid.

4115
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:15,210
Oh my gosh.

4116
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:16,530
I can't even form sentences right now.

4117
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:17,290
Holy shit.

4118
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:18,310
Maybe it's already numb.

4119
02:05:18,770 --> 02:05:20,690
I can't even!

4120
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:23,550
I can't even form sentences anymore!

4121
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:26,710
Maybe it's already too late.

4122
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:30,430
It's already too late for me.

4123
02:05:31,310 --> 02:05:32,770
But it was super fun.

4124
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:34,010
I had a great time.

4125
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:37,010
I hope you guys had a great time with them too.

4126
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:38,630
I'm sorry.

4127
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:40,170
I can't.

4128
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:43,210
My brain's already... Oh, I should turn the game off.

4129
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:46,470
I hate this fucking soundtrack so much.

4130
02:05:46,670 --> 02:05:47,310
I...

4131
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:48,650
I hate it!

4132
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:54,030
I hate this soundtrack so fucking much.

4133
02:05:59,650 --> 02:06:02,490
I'm going to call it here everybody.

4134
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:09,210
It's just like how I remembered Pico Park.

4135
02:06:10,010 --> 02:06:12,510
There's nothing else to say.

4136
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:14,230
It's just how I remembered.

4137
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:16,530
Equally...

4138
02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:18,530
Equally as Pico.

4139
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:22,630
That was so much fun, Toki.

4140
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:23,610
Thank you for the super chat.

4141
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:24,030
Thank you.

4142
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:24,690
Thank you.

4143
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:33,750
I can't believe the hardest part in the entire game was the memorization in the boxes.

4144
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:35,370
The boxes!

4145
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:40,650
The fucking boxes with the memorize where they are.

4146
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,170
That was too much.

4147
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:45,110
That was way too much for all of us.

4148
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:47,570
Aphelion, thank you for the magenta soup.

4149
02:06:47,610 --> 02:06:48,210
Thank you.

4150
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:51,090
This is such a great stream to start my birthday.

4151
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:53,250
Hope you guys are having a good one too.

4152
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:54,010
Thank you.

4153
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:55,510
Thank you for the magenta soup.

4154
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:56,250
Thank you.

4155
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:56,870
Thank you.

4156
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:58,550
Happy birthday to you.

4157
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:00,330
Happy birthday to you.

4158
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:02,270
Happy birthday, dear Aphelion.

4159
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:04,110
Happy birthday to you.

4160
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,690
Yeah!

4161
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:06,250
Okay.

4162
02:07:06,430 --> 02:07:07,330
I am...

4163
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:19,590
I'm gonna... I don't know when we're gonna have Pico Park Part 2 because I know some people are going to TwitchCon, so we're gonna figure that we might not have it until...

4164
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:20,470
I don't know.

4165
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:21,310
Maybe next week?

4166
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:23,970
I'll see how everybody's schedule is like.

4167
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:31,670
We'll do it earlier because Rin obviously has to sleep, so we'll try and get that... have an earlier stream for it.

4168
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:32,930
Maybe at like 12 or something.

4169
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,610
So at least we have like 4 hours of that.

4170
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:37,970
Anyway guys, I'm gonna head off now.

4171
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:44,070
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get up and get around to get that blood flowing.

4172
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:47,470
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it!

4173
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:48,750
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

4174
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,410
Bye guys!

4175
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:51,730
Bye!

4176
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:02,830
You guys enjoyed the foogies!

4177
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:05,850
The little foogie graphics I made for everybody.

4178
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:13,690
I made those because like I assumed that like, you know, like it was easier for everybody to see where... like who's who.

4179
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:17,710
So I hope you guys liked the little foogie graphics that I made for everybody.

4180
02:08:17,810 --> 02:08:19,090
Anyway, bye for real!

4181
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:19,490
Bye!
