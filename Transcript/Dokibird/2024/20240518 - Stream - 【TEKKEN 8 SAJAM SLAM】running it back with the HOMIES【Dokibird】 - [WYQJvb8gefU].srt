1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
That is

2
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,750
in last place is only five games behind the team that is in
first place.

3
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,970
I'm muted by the way.

4
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,090
Instead of three points for win.

5
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,210
Sorry, I was playing a game.

6
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,210
No!

7
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,550
That's me.

8
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,630
That is Miles's team, which is if you, for instance, if
Miles' team played Brawl Pro's team, who's in first place

9
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,350
right now, and five owed them, then they would go from last
for first and Brawl Pro's team would no longer be in first

10
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,590
place.

11
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,930
So there's a huge amount of points on the line today to
incentivize, you know, playing the first day, then learning

12
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,770
and coming back on Friday, playing again and then doing the
cheating for Sunday.

13
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,270
So you'll be playing everybody again today.

14
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,950
All of you did this on Wednesday.

15
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,930
So you're all experienced and you know how to do it now.

16
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,410
We've all done this together before.

17
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,690
And then this is your chance to beat up the people who got
you on Wednesday and show off the stuff that you've learned

18
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,190
and work with your coaches and get some new stuff, some new
data.

19
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,730
And it's all worth more points.

20
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,270
So it's going to be really important.

21
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,050
Every game is really, really important.

22
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,150
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

23
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,270
I took a screenshot.

24
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,750
It's a ton of points.

25
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,370
So good luck out there.

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,550
No pressure.

27
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,930
Right.

28
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,430
I was about to say.

29
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,670
Yeah, no pressure.

30
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,210
Sorry, we're listening on Intel.

31
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,050
Almost double.

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,350
It's like double Jeopardy basically.

33
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,590
Everything is worth almost double.

34
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,670
So if you did great on Wednesday, I learned the low kick
chat.

35
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,150
On Wednesday, it's time to show all the stuff that you
learned.

36
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:27,970

Yeah, so we talked about prizes.

45
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,890
I talked about it on my stream.

46
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,770
Oh, my God, please.

47
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,790
I can't see.

48
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,470
Is this guy on Wi-Fi?

49
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,310
Is it me?

50
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,550
I can't tell.

51
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,110
I can't see.

52
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,930
You got a picture of the Evo for flight, hotel,
registration.

53
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,550
I mean, you could choose whether you're not.

54
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,470
You want to enter the tournament.

55
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,190
That's up to you.

56
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,850
You know, if you want to play in Tekken or some other games
of Evo, my fifth move is going to come in clutch.

57
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,690
Or it seems in first and second, they are from junk food.

58
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,310

66
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,070
You can't duck this again because you don't learn.

67
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,290
Nobody learn.

68
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,590

And then...

87
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,450
And then I could do it again!

88
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,770
And then...

89
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,530

Sorry I'm like in the game.

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,560
Hey congrats on Dango Shure or whatever.

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:41,900
i did it i learned a fifth move and it's actually coming in
clutch what's your new move what do we uh low kick i just

96
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:50,680
spammed the low kick and then i'm spam the low kick into a
hop kick oh that's good oh wait do you have the hop kick

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,780
combo did you yeah yeah yeah i figured it out i learned good
i can't wait to see it now the question is can i use it in

98
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:08,200
like actual like on our players you're probably gonna get uh
obliterated by esam oh that guy hit purple that guy hit

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:17,680
purple everybody else i think you're good i think esam's a
try hard why the is he in my elo this match i don't know man

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,280
should be in the should be facing slime or you yeah i i
think they didn't expect them to get good so fast because

101
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:34,220
like it's his first time but but he comes from fighting
games like what yeah and he cares a lot, which means you

102
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,300
should put him high.

103
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,380
He should get, like, a handicap.

104
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,380
Or I should get the handicap.

105
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,940
If you win one round, it's over.

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,700
Yeah, exactly.

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,040
If I get one round, I win both sets.

108
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,020
That should be the handicap.

109
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,420
You guys talking about Shmish, ma'am?

110
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,980
Hell, yep.

111
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
It's not fair.

112
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,680

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,020
He's just going to kick it.

119
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,000
But good luck.

120
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,300
Bro, am I even going to touch him?

121
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,440
My goal is to hit him one time.

122
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,940
You went two, three.

123
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,260
Oh, wait, did I went two, three?

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,940
I did.

125
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,960
Yeah, because he couldn't predict me because I didn't know
what I was doing.

126
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,800
So he didn't know what I was doing.

127
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,360
Hold on.

128
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,380

Even though ESAM doesn't even play Alyssa.

Okay.

284
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,810
Yeah, remove the sixth move stick to the fifth one.

Why didn't you believe?

287
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,670
My fault, my fault.

288
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,910
It's like you put three, mama, but you put in five eggs.

289
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,190
Eggs, eggs, eggs.

290
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,310
It's the same thing.

291
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,450
Exactly.

292
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,890
But he doesn't, they don't learn.

293
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,610
That's the thing.

294
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,010
This is a delicious omelet.

295
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:34,950
Oh my god.

296
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,750
They had the answer and then they stopped having the answer.

297
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,550
And now they remember it again.

298
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,350
I don't understand.

299
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,130
Why do they...

300
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,330
No, no, they downloading me.

301
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,630
Oh, what the fuck?

302
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,210
King versus king.

303
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:48,970
What the fuck?

304
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,150

305
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,250
Yeah, okay.

306
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,530
It's okay.

307
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,010
I stepped.

308
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:52,930
I stepped.

309
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,790
Yes, and then I do the six moves.

310
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,930
Oh, what the fuck?

311
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,610
Oh, my God.

312
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,930
I don't think that was, that cannot be intentional.

313
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,850
There's no way.

314
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,230
There's no way.

315
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:09,790
That's right.

316
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,130
There's no way.

317
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:11,850
I did the square.

318
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:23,530

What the hell, dude?

325
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,250
They don't learn.

326
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,850
I keep spamming it as long as they don't learn.

327
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,590
That was still insane.

328
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,630
I don't understand, though.

329
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,990
They did learn.

330
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,610
They unlearned.

331
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,170
They unlearned it.

332
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,090
They unlearned it.

333
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,250
They just, okay, it's because they think I would stop doing
it, but I'm so stubborn that I kept doing it.

334
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,270
They were so surprised.

335
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,650
That was crazy.

336
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,630
They're like, she eventually will stop, right?

337
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,910
But I didn't, because I was more stubborn.

338
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:47,710
is all about well done okay i have a real question you get
hit by five alley kicks and your character is like who the

Dude, what are you supposed to do?

347
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,090
We might as well just get C-Jammed and make the lobby.

348
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,250
Kaiser keeps having to edit his code.

349
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,090
He keeps posting a lobby and then having to edit it.

350
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,150
What?

351
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,070
He can't do it.

352
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,270
That he didn't mean.

353
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,810
How do you edit a link?

354
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,010
Like, in the Discord, he keeps, like, posting the link and
then screwing it up.

355
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,710
He's, oh, my bad.

356
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,630
Did he post the right one?

357
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:07,990
Yeah.

Do you think, like, you could get away with five alley kicks
on Dwayne's turn?

370
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,010
No, no.

371
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,970
I might do it.

372
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,550
I might do it, but I don't think I'm going to get away with
it.

373
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,210
Try.

374
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,030
Try for the one time.

375
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,530
Five alley kicks and the hop kick.

376
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,790
I believe.

377
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,570
Looking like he's fucking Warrong.

378
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,750
I was going to say that wall is so good.

379
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,290

Take you to the wall.

392
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,530
Alley kick to the wall.

393
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,870
We bought those.

394
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,010
I see the wall.

395
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,470

00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:47,930
Oh, the alley kick!

397
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:53,190
Okay, so he's sidestepping every time to stop the first
thing.

398
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,270
Oh, pay attention.

399
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,470
You weren't paying attention, coach.

400
00:28:59,470 --> 00:28:59,930

401
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,090

All right, fine.

406
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,350
I don't know when to get out there or how to get out when in
that spot.

407
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,850
Don't pull dick jabs in your diet.

408
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,810
Yeah, you're right.

409
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,270

410
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,310
Okay, so...

411
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,830
Yeah, yeah, that's always going to be a mid.

412
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,250
That's always going to be a mid when he crashes.

413
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,610
He's always going to be a mid when he crashes.

414

417
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,330
what a hot cake i mean you just read people like that it's
just a simple thing

418
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,970

00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,950
I'm going to be just like that tomorrow.

424
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,390
He's just blocking mids.

425
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,030
He beat me yesterday just by midding.

426
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,670
If I just like beat that.

427
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,090
He might just start with sidestep again, just autopilot.

428
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,530
I'm going to see.

429
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:25,770
He does.

430
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,510
He like his 4-4-2 into the high.

431
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,810
You can duck a second hit of them.

432
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:40,070

dispenser you're in his mind

436

Nice.

437
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,310
That's all right.

438
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:06,790
Yeah, okay.

439
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:13,830
So we're setting up for grab a long time, just waiting for
me to stand.

440
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,110
Oh.

441
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,690
Nice.

442
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,270
No!

443
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,910
Okay, whatever.

444
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,770
Wait, wall?

445
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:20,990
Never mind.

446
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,530
He might block alley kick here.

447
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:22,890
No.

448
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,330
Oh, nice!

449
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,170
The alley kick!

450
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,730
Hey, don't listen to me, man.

451
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,870
To keep alley kick.

452
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,610
Like I didn't listen and I got my five alley kicks.

453
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,490
I don't know how.

454
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,330
Oh my god, the shoulder.

455
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,170
Andy just to set up another knee.

456
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,790
Like look at that.

457
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,830
Run him so broke over.

458
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,670
Okay, they're not going to get hit by this in two days.

459
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,830
That's too obvious.

460
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,150
Knee shoulder guarantee.

461
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,050
I blocked mids.

462
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,010
The game is over.

463
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,010
This should have happened two days ago.

464
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,210
The king streak.

465
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,190
Wrap it up, dude.

466
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,170
This should have happened two days ago.

467
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:55,990
I blocked your mids.

468
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,650
You're not playing.

469
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,590
So these points add on to the points from two days ago.

470
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:07,210
ago so this is making the gap wider between our team and
this team they're the second they're worth five points

471
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:17,510
instead of three yeah oh nice okay uh all right wait which
team's the second team and what well uh tony's and nyk's

very close nice yeah it's tony's and nyk's team uh that are

473
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,790

repeating it So I don't know if he still will.

481
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,730
So ready.

What he's wearing now?

488
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,250
That should look like a Pop-Tart.

489
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,670
Oh my god, that's what I'm talking about.

490

Oh, I'm definitely behind you guys.

492

He'll be a great one for sure.

493

Round two, fight.

494
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,490
There's a strong button.

00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,560
Oh, that's good.

499
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,020
Damn it.

500
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,000
That was kind of war on it.

501
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,320
You had hate slime.

502
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,040
Keep that in mind.

503
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,450
Whoops.

00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,650

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,990
Fight.

506
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:01,610
Oopsie.

507
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,970
I didn't mean to do that.

508
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,350
All right.

509
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:04,830
I got a fire.

510
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,030

518
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,990
Round 4 Fight

519
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,940
What the fuck is the whole play?

520
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,180
I've never seen that large move called upon Zeus.

521
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,660
That's his key.

522
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,840
It's like a mini jack.

523
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,220
Nice punish.

524
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,680

00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,560
Good shit.

526
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,180
One more round, brother.

527
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,740
Oh my god, I'm so behind.

528
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
We just start with a little hop.

529
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,500
Oh my goodness.

530
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,260
We're getting real cute now.

531
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,420
That's all good.

532
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,300
Oh Wow, that is fucking crazy.

533
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,840
Oh, what?

534
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520

He won!

538
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,560
Oh my god, I'm still watching him beat him up.

539
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,240
It's just the reverse 3-0, like a mull in this opulent
mansion.

540
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,020
Oh, man.

541
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,500
Good shit, man.

542
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,820

552
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,820
Oh, okay.

553
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,420
Round two.

554
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,340
Oh, he's lovely.

555
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,740
By his large dress like Mr. Beast Chocolate.

556
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,180
She's pretty close.

557
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,120
It's true.

558
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,620
He is.

559
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,120
Feastables.

560
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,440
Beastables.

561
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,060
Bro, look at Mighty Feastable right now, bro.

562
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
Mr. Beast sponsored us.

563
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,180
Okay, I don't know.

564
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,200
He was just doing...

565
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,080
He did neutral there.

566
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,180
I don't know what that is.

567
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,580
Right.

568
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,780
It's Samus near.

569
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,620
I keep left here.

570
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,060
Easy.

571
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,480
Nice.

572
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,760
Whatever.

573
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,800
But it's okay.

574
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,280
Drop your American reset.

575
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,380
That's what we call that slime.

576
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,040
Reset.

577
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,820
An actual American reset.

578
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,900
You guys low here?

579
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
He knew.

580
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,100
You have heat.

581
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,290
Oh, nice.

582
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:19,850
Nice flip.

583
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,090
Let's go.

584
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,570
Nice.

585
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,650
Oh, nice.

586
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,030
One more, brother.

587
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,030
This guy learned how to mix and hunt the bear stance.

588
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,410
It's over.

589
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,150
That's all.

590
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,310
20 right there.

591
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:31,970
Close.

592
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,350
We dropped?

593
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,210
I hate him.

594
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,910
I'm so pathetic.

595
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,690
It's so pathetic character.

596
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,950
He plays pathetically.

597
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,750
He plays pathetically.

598
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,090
I agree with that.

599
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,170
I agree with that.

600
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,570
Stop using heat, you pussy.

601
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,690
Nice.

602
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,970
He's a docker.

603
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,290
Okay.

604
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,310
Okay.

605
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,150
Okay.

606
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,530
Whoa!

607
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,890
Oh my god.

608
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,490
Mold with a salmon!

609
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,810
Most blessed sidewall I've ever seen in my life.

610
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,770
What a lovely bear.

611
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,850
You got this cool sidewall last time too.

612
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,790
I think it was against him.

613
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,910
That's an actual...

614
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,450
He fell into the bear enclosure.

615
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,330
It just got pushed.

616
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,790
And they were like, where's his family?

617
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,850
He's like, oh, someone, please.

618
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,870
Bro, I couldn't get out.

619
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,690
He loved Mr. Beast.

620
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,170
Oh, my God.

621
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,030
That was so stressful.

622
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,190
Good shit, dude.

623
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,710
When he won rounds, he fucking won rounds, too.

624
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,550
It was really scary.

625
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,950
Lars is just kind of steam-roly.

626
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,530
He'll do that.

627
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,710
Like, he just runs you over.

628
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,490

Why is he here again?

649
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,850

I don't think he's thinking anymore.

655
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,400
Not going to lie.

656
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,500
That's too much damage, dude.

657
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,820
He's a big boy.

Okay.

663
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,080
He gets around.

664
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,820
I got auto balance to the other team.

665
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,980
Oh wait, is he gonna take a round off?

666
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,360
He took a round off you!

667
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,880

00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,440

Dude is doing strings!

683
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Oh, her PC is potato.

684
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,820
Matt, you know that two hits, the string he did before he
did a low heat smash?

685
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,980
The second hit is a high.

686
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,560
Oh.

687
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,240
Oh.

688
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:17,900
Oh.

689
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,000
Big mistake.

690
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,900
That's in the commandments.

691
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,000
Every time.

692
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,420
Oh.

693
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,040
Time to be punished.

694
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,460
Half bar.

695
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,340
To let her get up.

696
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,320
Oh my god.

697
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,680
What a gamma health.

698
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,360
What the fuck?

699
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:49,940

launch that just like nope reverse i like the idea

700
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,480

701
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,780
did he know he's No way.

702
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,880
Bounce?

703
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,280
It's a guard break.

704
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,340
You can't block it.

705
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,020
I do.

706
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:20,900
Okay.

707
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,020
It'll be a miracle of shifter that makes it to Sunday.

708
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,400
I would destroy my PC.

709
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,100
This is insane.

710
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,500
What if he's at bar go?

711
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,740
What if, like, we get the buy?

712
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,780
Where is his bar?

713
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,780
Bro, we looked away for five seconds of the skull of his
guys.

714
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,940
Oh my god, two seconds.

715
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,020
Oh my god, two seconds.

716
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,060
This is fucking unfair.

717
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,800
This character is insane.

718
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,020
Blood, where are you?

719
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,760
Easy.

720
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,080
Blood, where are you?

721
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,240
Oh my god, dude.

722
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,460
I think we ruined his day.

723
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,280
He has like four more rounds to go.

724
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,140
Yeah, that's a joke.

725
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,900
Yeah, that's a hard joke.

726
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,740
How will you face the other four opponents?

727
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,820
Uh...

728
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,940
You know what, Brawl Pro?

729
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,300

Order a pizza.

742
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,680
You're old enough to take care of your ass.

743
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,260
That's what I'm saying.

744
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,480
That's how he treats my ass.

745
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,500
Hot dogs in the sink.

746
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,400
This fucking guy, man.

747
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
He just looks like they did it all.

748
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,280
Matt, you call me broke yesterday.

749
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,200
It's just payback.

750
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,460
Oh, my goodness.

751
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:05,980
Round one.

752
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,620
Now the chat spam is a broke.

753
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,110
Like, what is that?

754
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:14,900
Okay.

755
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,010
I love that move.

756
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:26,390
Oh.

757
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:28,250
Nice.

758
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,910
Do the alley kicks.

759
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,710
Yeah, the alley kick is guaranteed.

760
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:32,130
That's guaranteed.

761
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:32,730
Okay.

762
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,230
Yes.

763
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,290
Yeah.

764
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,260
Round two.

765
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,060
Oh, okay.

766
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,320
I see.

767
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,400
Damn.

768
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:49,920
Wow.

769
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,120
It's not a good look if you're the only one that doesn't win
a round, bro.

770
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,060
It's not a good look.

771
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,860
The coach doesn't win for us after all the points we got for
him.

772
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,260
He's late and he loses.

773
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,420
And he loses?

774
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,000
Wait, unless...

775
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,880
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

776
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:22,860
Oh.

777
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,780
That guy just knows.

778
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,400
Look at like slime out there.

779
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,780
I feel like the more we roast him, the better he does, guys.

780
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:37,160
He needs to prove us wrong!

781
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,660
The nothing?

782
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,000
Damn, he's agile!

783
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,740
Dude, the higher level Tekken gets, the more people just run
up to do nothing.

784
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,600
It's so scary.

785
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,620
You're just like, what is he gonna do?

786
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,740
Pop, pop, pop, and it's gaming.

787
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,440
All right, all right, all right.

788
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,160
My fault, coach.

789
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,140
My fault, coach.

790
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:00,720
Uh-oh.

791
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,780
I'm so bad at the game.

792
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,780
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

793
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,940
Oh, no.

794
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:08,760
Rage art?

795
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,060
No.

796
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,380
Rage art, we win.

797
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,100
Let's go!

798
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,740
Oh my god, don't worry, I'm going to see the Rage art soon.

799
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm going to armor this black-ass mix-up.

800
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,900
Guys, don't worry.

801
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,980
He's rage-arting now.

802
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,420
Baby

803
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,960
Kaiser was definitely starting to feel himself He was like
Oh watch this straight And then you just wait Wave That's

00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:48,540

806
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,640
The coach doesn't know?

807
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,160
Oh, this is it.

808
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:58,840
Uh-oh.

809
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,720
Oh!

810
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,120
Oh, no!

811
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,540
What a fucking giant swing, bro.

812
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,120
Send it.

813
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,820
Oh, my God.

814
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,720
Oh, yes!

815
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,880
He teabagged.

816
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,700
That's our coach.

817
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,320
That's our coach.

818
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,860
That's the values he teaches us.

819
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,200
learn how to teabag from my coach.

820
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,180
He told me to do it after every game.

821
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,000
Please stop.

822
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,760
Slime, you've seen Billy Madison, right?

823
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

824
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,120
We're the O'Doyles.

825
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,200
That's this team.

826
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,900
We're just the fucking O'Doyles.

827
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,580
This doesn't bode well if we get to the very end of the
movie.

828
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,440
Let's avoid Buster.

829
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,440
Wait, what happens at the end of the movie?

830
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,680
What happens?

831
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,760
Don't worry about it.

832
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,480
Don't worry about it.

833
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,560
Is it good thing?

834
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,640
Oh, the Doyle rule.

835
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,320
Elsa air!

836
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,260
Whoa!

837
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,560
Okay, no problem.

838
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:00,900
Whoa!

839
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,060
Oh, you got cocky there.

840
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,280
Anti-air, anime fighter.

841
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,240
What the fuck?

842
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,140
You just kicked her.

843
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,720
Yeah, it's a low grab.

844
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,740
You gotta hold down back to attack it.

845
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,740
Oh my god.

846
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,100
You just wanted to make it close for content.

847
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:27,700
That's it.

848
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,440
Oh, good shit.

849
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,220
Boom, boom.

850
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,300
Punishable.

851
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,060
You love a juicy hot kick.

852
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,040
Imagine.

853
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,080
Oh.

854
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,400
Oh.

855
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:43,620
Oh.

856
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,560
Nice.

857
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,400
Guess we're game.

858
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,120
What is that?

859
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,500
Oh, boy.

860
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,760
Oh, what?

861
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,020
How come we weren't taught that move?

862
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,180
It's too dangerous.

863
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,040
We would kill ourselves doing it.

864
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,260
We'd break our neck.

865
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,300

You bring it back.

885
00:52:58,870 --> 00:52:58,950
It's okay.

886
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,890
Smash a beer bottle.

887
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,650
What a close block.

888
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,610
The punish.

889
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,990
Kaiser might be gaming.

890
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,230
You know, we're just giving them false sense of security.

891
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:25,350
Nice.

892
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:26,490
Nice.

893
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:27,730
Okay.

894
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,470
You get wall, you get everything.

895
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:30,090
Okay.

896
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,470
Oh, we love holding back.

897
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,290
Yes!

898
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:32,850
Yeah!

899
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,750
We don't hit any buttons!

900
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,570
No buttons!

901
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:38,750
Fight!

902
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,760
Oh my god.

903
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,680
Nice dick punch.

904
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,190
Oh, I didn't know what the second hit was.

905
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:58,490
Oh.

906
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,850
Yeah.

907
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,070
That might be it.

908
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,770
Oh, yeah.

909
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,150
Damn, GG.

910
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,150
Oh, GG's.

911
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:11,930
Oh, I tried.

912
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:12,250
I tried.

913
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,910
Ah.

914
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,430
It's okay.

915
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,890
We just wanted to give them one extra point, you know?

916
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,490
We felt bad.

917
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,470
Yeah, it makes sense.

918
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:18,970
Yeah.

919
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,590
You gave us all a shard of yourself, Brawl Pro.

920
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,070
Yeah.

921
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:29,010
Across the team, because it's just mathematically better,
you know?

922
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:29,630
Yeah.

923
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,670
We add all of us together as one Brawl Pro.

924
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,210
I'm okay getting carried by my team.

925
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,070
I'm okay with that.

926
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:41,470
Bro, it's like the Ninja Turtles getting care like splinter
like taking care of those babies and now he's the old

927
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,770
splinter And we're the new Ninja Turtles.

928
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,730
I'm Raphael though.

929
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,230
I won't be Raphael.

930
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:55,790
That's why I just Leonardo will call it You guys don't have
the other two Sorry, sorry that there's two shitty Ninja

931
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:56,190
Turtles.

932
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,610
Yeah, I'm Donatello.

933
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,730
Okay, there we go That means that's the party dude

934
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,710
It doesn't work out any better.

935
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:07,590
It's perfect.

936
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,390
I actually liked Donatello when I was a kid because I
thought he was the smartest and I thought that was

937
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,810
important.

938
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:16,970
Yeah, that's why I'm Donatello.

939
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,150
But not now?

940
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,050
No, now I just, I want to be like the Chad Leonardo with
swords.

941
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:22,490
Sure.

942
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,630
Wait, doesn't matter?

943
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,890
Yeah, doesn't matter is Mikey, Michelangelo.

944
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:28,390
That just makes sense.

945
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:29,070
That makes sense.

946
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,190
Literally, I couldn't ask for a better circle.

947
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:36,110
Because I know he can never be Donatell

948
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:45,410
Alright, we got a stack before the next round So if you guys
want to run a Nice We can chill Yeah, I got to do a quick

962
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,410
I completed the first step

963
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:30,010
This guy's pretty good, but his offense is kind of weak.

964
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,170
The frames will be back soon, guys.

965
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,450
It'll be back soon.

966
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:35,830
Don't worry.

967
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:39,370
I'm loading in.

968
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,370
See, there you go.

969
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,950
I was loading in the shaders.

970
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:43,930
I was loading in.

971
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,730
I'm loading in more shaders.

972
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,970
See, duck that one time, but not other times.

973
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,570
I don't expect people to mix up.

974
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,130
The shaders are loading up, guys.

975
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:57,750
There we go.

976
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:58,890
It's fine now, see?

977
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,950
Now it's fine.

978
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,270
Now you can see everything.

979
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:03,790
Now you can see everything.

980
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:05,910
There.

981
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,090
It's fine.

982
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:12,250
If he just waits and then does that, I don't talk to him
every time.

983
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:14,810
See, look.

984
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,590
It's smooth.

985
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,310
It's so smooth, chat.

986
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,730
But this is my favorite move now.

987
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,690
This is honestly...

988
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,750
I haven't done that yet.

989
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,110
I think it hits wall.

990
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,390
This cat let go.

991
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,190
This is my favorite move, chat.

992
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:38,090
And then I can do the hop kick.

993
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,110
The perfect move.

994
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,270
That's how I got to this Elo.

995
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,560
The best move ever.

996
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,280
Nobody can fucking counter it for some reason.

997
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:10,760
why wait this guy has this this guy is on wi-fi look this
guy's wi-fi he deserves to have the frames he deserves the

1003
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,820
Boop.

1004
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,180
He ducked.

1005
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:03,700
He cheated.

1006
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,560
Ducky in front of a king player?

1007
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,360
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1008
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,920
What is wrong with this man?

1009
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,340
How dare you?

1010
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,640
Here we go.

1011
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,420
He's not gonna duck again.

1012
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,960
They never learn.

1013
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,680
They never learn when they play against a king.

1014
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,640
It's fine.

1015
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,580
Oh, wait.

1016
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,440
Oh, he overheard me.

1017
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,140
Not.

1018
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,480
It's fine.

1019
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,980
This time.

1020
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:39,680
It's fine.

1021
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,120
Whoa.

1022
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,480
No, it's not fine.

1023
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,420
I'm so sorry.

1024
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,460
Let me go.

1025
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,280
Let me go.

1026
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,040
I'm so sorry.

1027
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,020
Let me go.

1028
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,280
There's no way.

1029
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:57,280
And then my secret hidden six move that nobody knows yet.

1030
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,460
Until the finals.

1031
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,960
Then people are going to know in the finals.

1032
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,160
That's fucking right.

1033
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,480
No more over.

1034
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,320
Oh, shit.

1035
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,080
Oh, okay.

1036
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
I did not expect that.

1037
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,900
Not gonna lie.

1038
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,900
Please, please, please.

1039
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:10,800
Give me that.

1040
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:11,580
Please.

1041
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:12,520
Oh.

1042
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,340
Give me that one hit.

1043
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,780
Oh.

1044
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,400
Oh, that's scary.

1045
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,180
It's fine.

1046
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,340
And then...

1047
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,120
And then it's my turn.

1048
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:25,680
Right?

1049
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Is it my turn?

1050
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:27,800
It is.

1051
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:28,980
Yay!

1052
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,200
You bitch.

1053
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,220
You whore.

1054
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:33,740
Okay, it's fine.

1055
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,080
There you go.

1056
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,360
And again!

1057
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:36,680
No!

1058
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,300
He's sorry!

1059
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,080
Nobody loves you!

1060
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,580
Not even your mom!

1061
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,640
Okay, I'm so sorry.

1062
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,240
I'm so...

1063
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1064
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,020
Get closer, please.

1065
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:48,540
Oh.

1066
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,420
The sides.

1067
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,120
There you go.

1068
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,500
See?

1069
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,420
We did it.

1070
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:56,920
Yay!

1071
01:02:59,380 --> 01:02:59,820
Yay!

1072
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:00,840
God!

1073
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,780
How did I hit?

1074
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,160
Because I called him Loveless.

1075
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,600
I called him a Loveless Child.

1076
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,800
And that's how it hits.

1077
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,760
I've become a fighting game gamer.

1078
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,340
That's how it works.

1079
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:28,560
If you hit.

1080
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,160
If you tell your enemy nobody.

1081
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,020
loves him.

1082
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,900
He'll get hurt emotionally and then you win.

1083
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,860
The one button rage.

1084
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,120
Alright, stay the win.

1085
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,960
Get one and done.

1086
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:42,740
Exactly.

1087
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,560
He's not special.

1088
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,220
He's not the only one and done.

1089
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,780
It's okay, guys.

1090
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,620
Guys, don't worry.

1091
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,040
I'm loading in the shaders.

1092
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,460
It'll be fine.

1093
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:57,820
See?

1094
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,580
I told you.

1095
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,200
It's fine.

1096
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,320
I had to load in the shaders.

1097
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:19,240

Oh, whoa.

01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,380

01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,420
Oh, he fucking ducked that?

How?

1107
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,250
Bro, he just walks away.

1108
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,790
You don't walk away from me.

1109
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:21,350
Oh, my God.

1110
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,570
How do you just walk away?

1111
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,190
How do you lose?

1112
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,870
Just turn around and walk away.

1113
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,610
Okay.

1114
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,230
Oh, my God.

1115
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:33,230
Oh, my God.

1116
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,230
He keeps...

1117
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:39,020
he he keeps walking away from me i don't know what to do

1118
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:59,450

1121
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:27,530
i fucked it up but it doesn't matter goodbye

1122
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:38,990
goodbye yay We won that, the reason why we're not in the
game yet, another, in the next round yet, is that we won the

1123
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:46,310
game so fucking fast that, like, uh, we won our set so fast,
um, that we're just chilling now.

1124
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,990
We're just pracked, warming up.

1125
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,510
When nothing works, AliKick, exactly.

1126
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:56,910
Oh, we're just waiting.

1127
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:58,350
How are you so good?

1128
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,910
Because I don't need to learn, like, 20 plus moves.

1129
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:04,230
I just learned, like, four to six, and then just perfect.

1130
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:15,170
it they can't predict it because like I also throw in random
button mashing so they can never predict it because it's

1131
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:25,110
like which one is like they don't know when like is the real
match you know if I throw in random button mashing they

1132
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:37,750
can't predict the moves oh my god bro okay oh my god she
stopped it She actually... She's gonna block this, isn't

1133
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,990

1134
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:38,570
Goodbye.

1135
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:42,350
Look, she's red-ranked.

1136
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,370
She knows how to do it.

1137
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,910
When I learn a seventh move, I can beat her.

1138
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:48,290
That's all I'm saying.

1139
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,330
The moment I learn a seventh move, I can beat her.

1140
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,050
Oh, my God.

1141
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,430
She fucking stuck.

1142
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,330
Oh, my God.

1143
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:02,230
Just saying, the fifth and sixth move got me to this Elo.

1144
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,950
Not gonna lie.

1145
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:07,530
The fifth and sixth move got me here.

1146
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:09,950
Jesus!

1147
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,090
Holy fuck!

1148
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,330
Gotta start throwing up mid.

1149
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,050
Yay!

1150
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,090
Bop-bop.

1151
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,470
Goodbye!

1152
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:27,830
Yay!

1153
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,630
That was so close.

1154
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,950
Is she gonna...

1155
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,170
Yeah.

1156
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:34,970
Oh, she is.

1157
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,330
Oh, I thought she was gonna duck.

1158
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,870
That's not fair.

1159
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,850
She didn't.

1160
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,750
Why didn't you duck?

1161
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:45,950
Why did you duck?

1162
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:47,610
Why?

1163
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:50,070
Oh, now you duck!

1164
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,270
Okay, I did mean now.

1165
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,570
Don't stop ducking!

1166
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:00,970
I didn't mean now!

1167
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:15,790
I can't believe it Oh my god Now she does that Bro

1168
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:32,090

1169
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:34,590
Fuck off!

1170
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,170
Um, what the heck is a passcode?

1171
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,750
Oh no, we're starting.

1172
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,710

And you're going down.

1181
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,400
The Reds are going down.

1182
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,020
When I learned my seventh move.

1183
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:12,180
That's right.

1184
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,460
Doki's coming.

1185
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,980
The Red Rings.

1186
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,500

01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:36,090
You didn't even tell me what to do.

1216
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,710
Well, Jason, you as per usual, I see.

1217
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:42,330
He didn't even tell me what to do.

1218
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,530
I can't believe it.

1219
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,070
I guess I'll never know what to do.

1220
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,740
Our coach went out to get milk, guys.

1221
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,540
Yeah, he'll come back.

1222
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,040
He'll come back, right?

1223
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,660
Surely he'll come back.

1224
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,840
He'll come back to coaches, right, guys?

1225
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:23,030
He sounds not going to know my low kick.

1226
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,370
He won't expect it.

1227
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:40,440
I think we're just waiting for them, for, uh, casters to be
ready at the moment, chat.

1228
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,630
So we're just waiting for now.

1229
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,390
We're just waiting for now.

1230
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:52,890
All right, I'm back team.

1231
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,790
Sorry, they yoyed me for an interview.

1232
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,590
So, so what do I do?

1233
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,690
Oh, man.

1234
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:10,170
Um, you gotta, uh, Okay, so if he's mid-range, he's going to
maybe do the slide.

1235
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:19,370
The punish on the slide might be annoying to just explain
here because you have to, like, crouch cancel and then do

1236
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:20,070
the down forward.

1237
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,390
What?

1238
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,150
What?

1239
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,630
Wait, crouch cancel?

1240
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:26,150
What?

1241
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:33,610
Okay, you just, if you block the slide, just alley kick him
three times.

1242
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:34,230
Okay.

1243
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:34,690
That's a punish.

1244
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,210
All right.

1245
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:36,750
I got it.

1246
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:44,690
in three times i know how to do that and after the third
alley kick hit hit the right punch it's a fourth hit so that

1247
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:52,090
will also okay the right punch okay or you can yeah you can
also just while standing four like if you block low like

1248
01:14:52,090 --> 01:15:03,350
then just hit four to do the while standing four oh no he's
doing the thing who's watching this who can spectate oh my

1249
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:11,030
god sam please I'm surprised like, I hate fighting this guy
in rank as well, too.

1250
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:14,030
Oh my God, you know he's purple, he can duck.

1251
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:21,070
Okay, you gotta hit him with the elbow when you're
sprinting.

1252
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,230
Yeah, he knows how to duck.

1253
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,050
So I have to, do you think he'll duck this?

1254
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,390
Yes.

1255
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:29,170
Oh.

1256
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:32,890
Oh my God.

1257
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:35,110
Goodbye.

1258
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:36,430
Cruel world.

1259
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,230
Goodbye.

1260
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:40,710
The law is loud.

1261
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,330
Oh my god.

1262
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,410
This ass is just screaming.

1263
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:47,790
That's why I'm watching this shit muted, dude.

1264
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,890
The law is annoying.

1265
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,390
I hate playing against law in general, even in rank.

1266
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:57,870
It's so annoying.

1267
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:00,110
Oh my god, he just sucks everything.

1268
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,970
It's like he's been playing against king players such a hard
life.

1269
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,310
Hey guys, it was great.

1270
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:08,110
existing.

1271
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,350
I existed.

1272
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:23,950
You know, it went the way I expected it to go.

1273
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:28,730
That's all right.

1274
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:29,430
It's all right.

1275
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,870
He's a nerd.

1276
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,390
He is.

1277
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,630
He's a fucking nerd.

1278
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:35,470
We already talked about this.

1279
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,190
He wants the trip so bad.

1280
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:40,030
Oh my god, how does he, why do I fall?

1281
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,770
This character does a lot of stuff.

1282
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,390
Oh, yes.

1283
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,650
That's fucking right.

1284
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,330
He did a trick for my alley kicks.

1285
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,370
Let's freaking go.

1286
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:55,490
I got that.

1287
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,270
It's fine.

1288
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:57,030
That's a mighty ruler.

1289
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:57,630
That's a mighty ruler.

1290
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:59,330
This guy's purple.

1291
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,110
This guy's purple.

1292
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:03,550
He lets me alley kick him 20 times.

It's okay.

I got that one round.

1303
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:07,850
Remember, I got one round off of purple.

1304
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:09,150
You can do it.

1305
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:10,590
That should be worth some points.

1306
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:11,630
Yeah, that should be like, weird.

1307
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,050
At least like one point.

1308
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,910
Because he's literally smurfing at this point.

1309
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:15,990
Give us something.

1310
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,070

One point.

01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,150
Give us one point.

My handicap.

That's fine.

1317
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,150
That's fine.

1318
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,250
He's cheating, so...

He had a mix of.

1366
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,480
He didn't need that.

1367
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,400
All right.

1368
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:11,380

1394
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,180

op yeah I don't know who this guy is nor do I know who Zin
Megami Tensei is that's Josh oh I don't know who Kyle

1398
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:43,720

1402
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:16,000
passcode already i bet you can see in sayjam's stream too
Josh man readied up is fucking stupid he's the stupidest

1403
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,060
person I think I've ever met in my whole life ever ranked
ranked number one on the PR

1404
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:36,830
did someone leak the code the code is on screen yeah like
what does he mean wait see Jeff actually hides the passcode

1405
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,600
oh it's our fault I guess

1406
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,700
not my screen

1407
01:26:48,840 --> 01:27:01,560
so we all got a oh god wait this is why he's secretly bald
do we actually have to hide the code look guys hf want us to

1408
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:11,940
censor the code somehow i don't have the elements in my obs
we just get a picture like put a white bar over it i don't

1409
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,800
have the element

1410
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,600
Blackbar.png.

1411
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:19,540
Yeah.

1412
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,060
Wait, so what's happening?

1413
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,020
How do I get in?

1414
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:26,800
For...

1415
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,240
Oh, I see.

1416
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:27,480
I see.

1417
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,240
All right.

1418
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:28,900
We're going.

1419
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,340
Your rage art button, brother.

1420
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,960
So rage art.

1421
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:38,300
Remember, slime, when he back ones, he generally likes the
back one again right after.

1422
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,300
So you can maybe g-cliff that a couple times.

1423
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:46,380
And then he's going to start back-onning into the 1-2
strings, which will beat your g-cliff.

1424
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:50,180
So if you're making the read, you can just hold back and be
safe.

1425
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:55,320
Or you can down back four for a huge call out because
that'll crush the high, I think.

1426
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,920
But, I mean, if you just hold back against Brian, he can
only hit you with his hatchet.

1427
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,640
And I guess, like, his wall stuff.

1428
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:08,880
But, I mean, depends on the stage for the wall stuff, pretty
much, though, you know.

1429
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,200
Holding back, definitely more safe.

1430
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:14,880
Yeah.

1431
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:17,380
Yup.

1432
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,260
The walls are good for you as well.

1433
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,120
Yeah, good luck, boss.

1434
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,440
You got this.

1435
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,480
Can bear a break floor easy?

1436
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,180
Round one.

1437
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,870
Good shit.

1438
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:37,930
Good shit.

1439
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:39,630
Take him to the wall.

1440
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:41,290
What a hop kick.

1441
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,510
Oh.

1442
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:46,550
That's why I remember when he's pressuring you, he bursts as
a free get out of jail card for you.

1443
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:47,090
Okay.

1444
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,180
Yeah!

1445
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,900
No, do not mistake again.

1446
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:55,880
Dude,

1447
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,200
what?

1448
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,020
Oh my god!

1449
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,880
Back 2-2-1 with a combo.

1450
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:07,840
Back 2-2-1.

1451
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:11,790
Oh!

1452
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,090
Nice.

1453
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:15,730
Oh, what?

1454
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,250
Good chance, Lou.

1455
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:20,770
Oh my god.

1456
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,610
Can't believe that.

1457
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:22,230
Connected.

1458
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:23,630
Now this is bad.

1459
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,010
Nice.

1460
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:32,150
Good block, Josh.

1461
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:33,410
All right.

1462
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:34,310
No more cell sweeps.

1463
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:38,790
Bro, full crash down forward one, so I'm gonna save.

1464
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:39,470
Yep.

1465

Yep.

1466
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:47,270
Should I punish that forward one, so I'm gonna stay.

1467
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:47,610
Oh.

1468
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:51,110

I'm not very clear.

1506
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:50,850
It might be.

1507
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:51,630
I'm not sure.

1508
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:53,750

You can hit up and down.

01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,590
Oh, he's backing.

1517
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,370
He's scared.

1518
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:25,090

1519
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:44,610

dude it's my fault it's my fault might kill me here this
wall Yeah.

1523
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,550
He's on his part and start command grabbing more.

1524
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:53,130
He has no reason to duck after you're an ace vs because
you're not doing the the grab after.

1525
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:54,030
You know what I mean?

1526
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:56,390
So that's why he's not ducking.

1527
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,510
You have to threaten the hunting bear stance grab.

1528
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:02,750
But you got this.

1529
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:03,710
You got this in the set.

1530
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:06,990
If you get the grab and break the floor, it's back 2-2-1 for
your build.

1531
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:14,910
Baming now.

1532
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:16,770
I can just duck punish that, right?

1533
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,970
You can duck it, yes.

01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,100
Yeah, destroyed.

1535
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:36,990

01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:51,970
Oh my god.

1578
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:55,030
This stage is a good jack stage too.

1579
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:58,130
So we got like good RNG.

1580
01:39:58,990 --> 01:39:59,510
Good rotation.

1581
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:00,610
Yeah, definitely.

1582
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:02,630
Round three.

1583
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:03,790
Another rotation.

1584
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:04,890
Oh, not fully.

1585
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:05,650
Get rotated.

1586
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:08,590
Did you pick this stage on purpose?

1587
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:09,730
Oh, it's random.

1588
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:10,830
Oh, shit.

1589
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:12,190
Oh, we blocked this.

1590
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:13,010
Oh, okay.

1591
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:15,070
I forgot that Oscar's bullshit.

1592
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:16,590
Oh, we blocked it.

1593
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,420
I just saw him block it.

1594
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:32,150
Shit.

1595
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:33,350
Okay.

1596
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:34,050
Actually.

1597
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:36,410
Don't let us get swept.

1598
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:37,490
Save us.

1599
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:42,010
Hey, we still have Brawl Pro.

1600
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:43,430
We still have him.

1601
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:46,650
Don't rely on me.

1602
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,730
I'm coming off an L.

1603
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:53,970
There's no way you lose.

1604
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,560
That's too much damage.

1605
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,160
There should be more because...

1606
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:05,980
There's a wall there!

1607
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,600
No way.

1608
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:10,080
Oh my god.

1609
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,160
That's the criminal character.

1610
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,940
Honestly, we need this.

1611
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:15,800
We need this.

1612
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:16,520
Oh my god.

1613
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:19,960
That was the Joe Crush, bro.

1614
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,760
Carry my ass.

1615
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:28,180
I hate that trick song.

1616
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,200
You have no idea.

1617
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,660
Oh my god, what?

1618
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:37,560
Oh.

1619
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:38,620
Really?

1620
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,240
Okay, never do that to Bogota.

1621
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,220
Yeah.

1622
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,680
The empty Spitfire Slayer.

1623
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,220
Yeah, he came back.

1624
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:59,200

nuts!

1627
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:33,830
If only King has missile hands, he'll be perfect.

1628
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,320
He really reacts to that.

1629
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,080
That's crazy for a New York player.

1630
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:50,310
Jesus.

1631
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:54,830
Don't let him stand up!

1632
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:55,890
Keep him on the floor!

1633
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:57,950
How does he do it?

1634
01:42:58,010 --> 01:42:58,370
Yeah!

1635
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:59,610
Fucking insane, dude.

1636
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:00,170
Let's go.

1637
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:01,750
Let's fucking go!

1638
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,150
Just when you think he's at his lowest!

1639
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:07,050
He came.

1640
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:08,250
It's a miracle.

1641
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:09,530
Slightly more correct.

1642
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:13,490
I'm going to suddenly duck the grab because I can't take
grabs.

1643
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:16,270
We didn't get swept guys.

1644
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:17,490
Thank God.

1645
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:18,430
Thank God.

1646
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:19,410
Matt did it.

1647
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:20,570
He saved us.

1648
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:22,270
Always a miracle.

1649
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,350
It's tough, man.

1650
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:28,470
Yeah, man, there's a reason they're top top right now,
right?

1651
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:29,770
They're right below us.

1652
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:35,010
He was playing hella good too, but he like, he wasn't
optimizing, but he was like doing pretty good.

1653
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:35,530
Yeah.

1654
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:37,090
Not good enough.

1655
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:39,870
It's too touching, man.

1656
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:42,190
You guess wrong twice and you die.

1657
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:49,280
Alright, we got our five points.

1658
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:50,680
Yippee.

1659
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:52,160
Yeah, good job, guys.

1660
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:54,820
Oh.

1661
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,520
Oh, Coach, you got this.

1662
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,260
Redeem us, too.

1663
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,540
The sequel.

1664
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,060
I'll just play my best.

1665
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:20,520
Good shit.

1666
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,260

1667
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:37,440

01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,230
oh oh

1670
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:04,270
Oh, you can't really draw that because I can see his smash
That's scary.

1671
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:05,990
Yeah

1672
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,720

1673
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:32,680

Nice!

1676
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:46,770
End it with an alley kick!

1677
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:49,350
For the fans?

1678
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:50,890
For the people in the back?

1679
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:55,770
I've been hitting him with a lot of mids, so I'm surprised
he's dunking.

1680
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:01,890
It's because he sees King, he automatic ducks because of it.

1681
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:14,030
That wall is close.

1682
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:21,350
But they broke the wall.

1683
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:34,350
Oh man, that sucks.

1684
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:44,090
The tick move!

1685
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:45,930
That's right, that's right.

1686
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,990
You got this coach.

1687
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:48,630
Yeah, you got the second set.

1688
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:12,300

01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:38,610
Freaky Brian?

1702
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:46,050

Can't really.

1749
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:28,060
That's why we lose now.

1750
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,780
So we get motivated to win.

1751
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:35,400
You have like so many, so much advice in the chat and you
just don't want to read any of it either, you know?

1752
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:36,980
I know because you want to walk in and shit.

1753
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,300

Not really, we got it.

1764
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:25,450
The only thing is when winners lose, it's like, it's like
God, it's like God is turning down his head.

1765
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,330
It doesn't make sense.

1766
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:26,690
What?

1767
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,850
How did she sidestep that?

1768
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:31,410
I'm like fighting ESAM again!

1769
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:32,790
It's gonna happen eventually.

1770
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:36,710
There's only so long you can go without fucking losing,
dude.

1771
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:37,730
I'm waiting for it.

1772
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:41,170
Like, I don't think it's gonna be a big deal.

1773
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:42,350
I don't care about it.

1774
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:46,370
I think it's gonna happen against You guys saw that fucking
lag, dude.

1775
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,610
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1776
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,230
Yeah, I was gonna lag, dude.

1777
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:52,490
I think it might be, like, a console issue or something.

1778
01:54:53,650 --> 01:54:53,970
Alright.

1779
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:56,170
Like, that shit.

1780
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:58,610
Oh, my God.

1781
01:54:58,990 --> 01:54:59,310
Oh, my God.

1782
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:00,050
How did I fuck that up?

1783
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,250
How did I fuck that up?

1784
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:02,750
How did I fuck that up?

1785
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:03,890
Of course it's me.

1786
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:05,790
Of course, that's how I fuck it up.

1787
01:55:06,150 --> 01:55:07,190
Leave me alone!

1788
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,690
Oh, my God.

1789
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:12,790
Please!

1790
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:20,970
I just thought I just thought if I ease them get out get out

1791
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:29,510
Oh my god, get the fuck out of here

1792
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:34,610
I almost had it.

1793
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:36,090
I did not almost had it.

1794
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:36,930
You know that

1795
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:41,950
It's gonna be hard.

1796
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:46,010
No, I don't want it to be hard I want to get it easily.

1797
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:47,950
No epic.

1798
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:51,350
I'm like three games from blue.

1799
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:53,530
Did you promote?

1800
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:54,870
I'm close.

1801
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:56,850
I'm halfway to purple.

1802
01:55:57,110 --> 01:56:00,450
If I could get blue before Sunday, you know, that would feel
nice.

1803
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:02,850
I feel like you just might as well just fucking strive for
it.

1804
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:03,330
That's easy.

1805
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:05,090
Oh my god.

1806
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:07,210
Leave me alone.

1807
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:07,810
Leave me alone.

1808
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:08,350
Look at that.

1809
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:09,270
You're gonna learn how to play Tekken.

1810
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:10,130
You better play Tekken.

1811
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:14,290
Please!

1812
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:16,750
Leave me alone, please!

1813
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:20,150
I have to fight East, please!

1814
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:21,610
Please leave me alone!

1815
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:29,950
This is not fair.

1816
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:33,370
This is actually not fair.

1817
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:36,970
Bro, what the fuck are we doing here?

1818
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:39,990
Alright.

1819
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:42,310
Mental shattered!

1820
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:43,350
No!

1821
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:47,050
I was waiting for Flood to fight him!

1822
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:52,490
No, what did he do to me?

1823
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:55,170
What did he do to me?

1824
01:56:58,930 --> 01:57:00,570
Mental boom.

1825
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:02,510
He boomed the mental.

1826
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:03,250
How?

1827
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,430
How is this possible?

1828
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,010
He just went free in my head.

1829
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:15,650
There we go.

1830
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:17,190
Oh god.

1831
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:18,510
Not a go.

1832
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:22,310
There we go.

1833
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:22,950
That should hit, right?

1834
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:23,850
No!

1835
01:57:24,530 --> 01:57:25,550
How did I not hit?

1836
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:29,870
There we go.

1837
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:31,210
That should hit.

1838
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:34,490
The ESAM curse.

1839
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:37,210
Hey, bro.

1840
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:38,350
Okay.

1841
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:41,890
I lied to before, but I honestly haven't even died.

1842
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:46,590
I know that obviously can literally let go of the rage art
midway, so it's not really a great sidewalk.

1843
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:47,270
Oh my god.

1844
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:49,510
But if you are gonna step it, is it left or right?

1845
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:51,170
Bro, fuck off.

1846
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:57,230
It's best to sidestep and then block.

1847
01:57:57,650 --> 01:57:59,470
So in case he does level two, you can still launch that.

1848
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:00,490
Yeah, yeah.

1849
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:05,350
Okay, this is the other combo.

1850
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:07,750
He delayed getting up.

1851
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,770
That my thing didn't even hit.

1852
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:10,530
That's crazy.

1853
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,350
That's actually crazy.

1854
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:20,770
holy is he gonna duck no he didn't duck thank god oh thank
god he didn't duck either

1855
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:39,270

01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:43,890

1857
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:45,950
Yeah!

1858
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:52,750
I did not intentionally save that.

1859
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:56,910
But I'll take it.

1860
01:58:57,210 --> 01:58:58,370
I'll take it.

1861
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:02,190
Oh, thank God.

1862
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:05,490

1865
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:08,290
No, I didn't!

1866
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:10,690
It's called button mashing.

01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:24,950
notification get ready for the next battle thank god for

No.

1876
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:21,350
Ah!

1877
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,670

02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:34,450
Oh, my God.

1883
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:35,290
He fucked up.

1884
02:00:35,390 --> 02:00:36,110
He fucked me up.

1885
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:36,990
It's okay.

1886
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:38,070
I didn't want to be red anyway.

1887
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:39,850
I didn't.

1888
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:41,870
I didn't want to be red anyway, guys.

1889
02:00:43,470 --> 02:00:45,270
Oh my god.

Wait, he predicted that?

1891
02:00:52,730 --> 02:00:54,410
How did he predict that?

1892
02:00:55,570 --> 02:00:57,170
My job is to be the same way.

1893
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:58,670

02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:26,390
Let's welcome go.

1910
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:32,510
I mean goodbye sir I'm I'm locked in I got red

1911
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:40,930
All right I fucking had it.

1912
02:01:41,050 --> 02:01:41,290
Alright.

1913
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:42,070
I had a crab.

1914
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:45,870
It's fine if I lose or win.

1915
02:01:46,290 --> 02:01:47,110
I have red rings.

1916
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:49,790
Honestly, like me too, I feel like I'm playing like weird.

1917
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:52,210
So it's not even split.

1918
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:57,090
Alright guys, for once in my life I'll hide the passcode.

1919
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:58,650
Holy shit.

1920
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:00,570
I'm gonna do it guys.

1921
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:04,650
Joki, she's not even ranked that much higher than you to be
honest.

1922
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:06,230
Very winnable.

1923
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:10,910
Yeah, but I feel like she actually knows what she's doing
because she played the this game much longer.

1924
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:16,210
I feel like she knows more than seven moves.

1925
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:22,850
Alright, guys.

1926
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:24,930
You can't blame me if somebody joins this lobby.

1927
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:26,830
I actually hit the code.

1928
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,330
It's not me this time.

1929
02:02:30,330 --> 02:02:30,810
Oh, you did?

1930
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:33,230
I'm not putting in that much effort.

1931
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:34,010
I'll say it.

1932
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:37,110
I gave up.

1933
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:38,590
SageM has a toupee.

1934
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:40,490
The whole world's upside down.

02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:26,320
Let's go.

1950
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,240
You can't yell at me, guys.

1951
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:30,700
If somebody joins the lobby.

1952
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:37,700
Okay, but I hate playing as Rina, though.

1953
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,120
She's so fast.

1954
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:41,720
She's so fucking fast.

1955
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:43,560
I'm too bulky.

1956
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:49,200
Just two reds duking it out.

1957
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:50,860
That's what you love to see.

1958
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:51,240
Yeah.

1959
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:52,180
Honest red gaming.

1960
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,440
This is this is true.

1961
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:55,260
I proof forced this right.

1962
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,920
This is what I'm here for.

1963
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:03,260
Wait, what was her weak?

1964
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:04,960
I don't remember what her weakness was.

1965
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,660
Coach, you didn't tell me.

1966
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,120
Coach, what do I do?

1967
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,200
Run your shit.

1968
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:15,900
Can we not talk about SK?

1969
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:16,860
No, we didn't.

1970
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:17,660
We didn't.

1971
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:19,220
We never did.

1972
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:19,880
Run your shit.

1973
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:21,000
Run your shit.

1974
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:21,540
Let's go.

1975
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,820
What do I do, coach?

1976
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:24,880
That's your shit.

1977
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,140
Wait, who's that?

1978
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:26,980
Just do that.

1979
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:28,140
Do what?

1980
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,180
That!

1981
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:29,820
That?

1982
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:31,300
You're playing it right now!

1983
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:31,820
This?

1984
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:32,860

Yump.

1986
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:35,560
It just happened.

1987
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:37,140
It just happened.

1988
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,240
You just did all of it.

1989
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:38,560
I did that.

1990
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:39,340
I did that.

1991
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,760
Oh my god, I did that.

1992
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,060
Did you see that, coach?

1993
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:45,800
She took though.

1994
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:48,340
Yeah.

1995
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,880
Okay, I think she knows now.

1996
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:52,160
She knows now.

Finish it.

2006
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:56,080
She dodged.

2007
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:57,000
She dodged.

2008
02:06:57,380 --> 02:06:58,140
Nice try.

2009
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:58,600
Nice try.

2010
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:01,440
Fight.

2011
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,760
Remember, you can do that running knee if...

2012
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:05,220
Okay.

2013
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:07,460
I was trying to, but then like...

2014
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:08,100
Oh my god.

2015
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:11,580
I tried to, but like I pressed the...

2016
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,340
I pressed square.

2017
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:14,580
Okay.

2018
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:16,160
Yes!

2019
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:16,840
Oh god.

2020
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:18,160
Yes!

2021
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:18,800
Right?

2022
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:20,180
Oh, no!

2023
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:20,840
I couldn't!

2024
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:22,960
Oh.

2025
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:24,300
Nice rage art?

2026
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:24,960
I think we did this.

2027
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:25,200
No!

2028
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:26,060
She got it!

2029
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,700
Oh, it's too strong.

2030
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:28,760
Oh.

2031
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,320
Oh, the misery.

2032
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:34,180
Oh, the misery.

2033
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:34,880
Wait, what?

2034
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,840
Oh, my God.

2035
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:39,280
I never...

2036
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:40,940
I hate that move, though, in rank.

2037
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:45,220
Oh, what?

2038
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:45,560
Okay.

2039
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:48,400
Hey.

2040
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:49,400
Nice.

2041
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:50,820
Okay.

2042
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:51,700
Big.

2043
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:53,900
Okay.

2044
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:55,200
Nice mix up.

2045
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:55,660
Okay.

2046
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:57,200
I got it.

2047
02:07:57,380 --> 02:07:58,540
I got it.

2048
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,120
I got it.

2049
02:07:59,340 --> 02:07:59,820
I got it.

2050
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:00,660
I got it.

2051
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:01,360
I got it.

2052
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:02,180
Let's go.

2053
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:04,120
I did it.

2054
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,040
Oh, that was good.

2055
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:06,760
That was good job.

2056
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:07,380
That was close.

2057
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:07,920
Good.

2058
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:11,900
25 hours Jokey versus 100 hour Rana.

2059
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:15,020
Oh, SK is definitely at 125 now.

2060
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,740
You're five times.

2061
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,480
Baby versus Bob.

2062
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:19,980
Yeah, Hydrogen Bob.

2063
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:20,480
Yeah.

2064
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,840
Did your maps get the bound?

2065
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,540
Oh my god.

2066
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:28,200
It's okay.

2067
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:28,900
Nice.

2068
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,660
You said you're five times better.

2069
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:34,280
You don't want to see Doki Bird at 125 hours.

2070
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,260
Yeah, you don't want to see 100.

2071
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:40,220
I don't think I have the hours for that either, to be fair.

2072
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,440
Suplex.

2073
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:42,320
Okay.

2074
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:43,660
No way.

2075
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:44,900
I just...

2076
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:45,200
Nope.

2077
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:46,820
I like how you didn't hop kick either.

2078
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:47,840
Yeah, that was good.

2079
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:48,880
Yeah, that was good.

2080
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:50,920
Oh my god, dude.

2081
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:56,160
Guys, I feel like they're gonna learn this by the finals,
though.

2082
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:57,660
They're looking like a pretty good move, bro.

2083
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:01,600
I mean, I'm just saying, like, that was pretty good.

2084
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:04,260
Oh my god.

2085
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,920
Dude, she's fucking swagging.

2086
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,740
This is crazy.

2087
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:09,980
What?

2088
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:11,160
What?

2089
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:13,240
It's only correct decision.

2090
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:14,040
What the fuck?

2091
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,520
It's only correct decision.

2092
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,180
How did she keep getting away with this?

2093
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,300
Play Devil May Cry.

2094
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:25,080
How did she keep getting away?

2095
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,460
Oh, big dog.

2096
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:28,220
Oh, no.

2097
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:28,960
I don't know.

2098
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:32,140
She like fucking mixes it up, so it's hard.

2099
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:33,340
Nice.

2100
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,460
Oh, no.

2101
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:37,840
Oh, goodbye.

2102
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:41,460
Oh, she hits it.

2103
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:42,740
Oh, dog.

2104
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,340
That's fine, that's fine.

2105
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:50,000
Yeah, she had to use lightning herself to kill you just to
be clear.

2106
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,160
Hey, we start out with that.

2107
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:51,560
No, fuck.

2108
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:55,680
Round start, alley kick.

2109
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:59,720
You're about to get King's worst low nerfed.

2110
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:03,160
Just because of what I do.

2111
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,520
That show just through Harada.

2112
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:07,400
Harada's watching, I guarantee you right now.

2113
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:08,280
Oh my god.

2114
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:09,000
Oh my god.

2115
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:11,400
Do you think that was intentional for her?

2116
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:12,940
That shit was like a movie.

2117
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:14,900
Yeah, holy shit.

2118
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:18,400
Okay, when you pop heat, hold on to your heat smash.

2119
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:20,080
Don't pop it right away because she's blocking it.

2120
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:20,360
Oh, okay.

2121
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:21,340
Just hold on to it a little bit.

2122
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:21,680
Okay.

2123
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:26,930
Oh, shit.

2124
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:29,210
Oh, I think she actually is learning.

2125
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:32,190
Yeah, that was a good adaptation.

2126
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:33,690
We're still live, still live.

2127
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:34,810
Oh, my gosh.

2128
02:10:35,290 --> 02:10:35,550
Boom.

2129
02:10:36,210 --> 02:10:36,910
All right, that's big.

2130
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:38,570
Do I do square or grab?

2131
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:40,690
You run up, grab.

2132
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,310
Matt, let's get it.

2133
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:44,430
Big Reef.

2134
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:45,710
Wait till she gets up, though.

2135
02:10:45,730 --> 02:10:46,430
Wait till she gets up.

2136
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:47,250
Because sometimes they like on the...

2137
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:48,410
Stay on the ground.

2138
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:50,030
There you go, there you go.

2139
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:50,690
I pop heat.

2140
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:51,710
Easy, easy.

2141
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:52,930
Pop heat when she gets up.

2142
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:54,290
I heat smash and go mid.

2143
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:55,790
Square, square.

2144
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:56,430
No!

2145
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:58,090
Matt, bad read, Matt!

2146
02:10:59,310 --> 02:11:00,130
Oh, nice try, nice try.

2147
02:11:00,250 --> 02:11:01,110
Bad read!

2148
02:11:02,070 --> 02:11:04,950
A plan is worse, is better than no plan at all.

2149
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:05,410
It's Matt's fault.

2150
02:11:05,850 --> 02:11:06,590
It's Matt's fault.

2151
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:07,350
It's Matt's fault.

2152
02:11:08,010 --> 02:11:08,250
It's Matt's fault.

2153
02:11:08,250 --> 02:11:08,630
It's Matt's fault.

2154
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:10,330
Yeah, you blew it.

2155
02:11:10,330 --> 02:11:10,950
You blew it for us.

2156
02:11:10,950 --> 02:11:11,910
I can only be read so many times.

2157
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:12,310
I'm sorry.

2158
02:11:15,390 --> 02:11:16,190
The wrong read.

2159
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:17,250
Okay, do that running.

2160
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:28,970
and grab a lot she has not taken a single one and then she's
gonna and it's gonna be a bad read again oh my god what the

2161
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:45,310
fuck oh my god she mad she's mad now the bounce okay she's
fucking mad now she's fucking mad oh my god she's so mad i'm

2162
02:11:45,310 --> 02:11:48,150
so sorry i'm so sorry She's gonna block this.

2163
02:11:48,230 --> 02:11:48,810
There's no way.

2164
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:52,030
Alright, true, true, true, true.

2165
02:11:52,050 --> 02:11:53,430
We sent it all there.

2166
02:11:57,290 --> 02:11:57,750
Okay.

2167
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:05,470
I like the idea.

2168
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:06,630
We're playing Tekken.

2169
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:07,370
This is some Tekken.

2170
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:08,550
We're playing Tekken, yeah, right here.

2171
02:12:08,610 --> 02:12:09,750
Right now.

2172
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:11,010
Right now.

2173
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:12,250
This is Tekken.

2174
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:14,690
Oh, shit.

2175
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:16,790
Oh, yeah, this is definitely Tekken.

2176
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:25,110
nice i love your patience it's so good yeah oh i think i
need to be more patient guys

2177
02:12:28,210 --> 02:12:35,930
that's huge no what oh no i thought i thought you pressed
it's okay still alive no she actually blocked it it's okay

2178
02:12:35,930 --> 02:12:42,710
and in the end i got that one set not over that's true
that's true

2179
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:54,370
that I don't know but yeah that looked fucking freaky though
freaky techniques yeah that's a freaky technique though not

2180
02:12:54,370 --> 02:13:07,030
gonna lie is real in a tier yeah okay that's a freaky
fucking technique oh fuck I should have grabbed guys it's

2181
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:16,050
okay I got us that five points though wait we get points per
per game do we get per say in the beginning no oh we don't

2182
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:18,130
this time No!

2183
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:23,250
No, I should have used more alley kicks.

2184
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:24,770
I know, I blame Matt.

2185
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:27,290
Alley kicks probably would have made her knees explode.

2186
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:31,190
She would have been a smoking pair of shoes in the
Colosseum.

2187
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:32,290
So true.

2188
02:13:34,070 --> 02:13:35,550
What's the code for this lobby?

2189
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:37,770
It doesn't let me spectate, so I restart it.

2190
02:13:38,170 --> 02:13:39,650
How do I say it to you without leaking?

2191
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:41,270
It's 8-9-2-1.

2192
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:42,250
Oh, I guess it doesn't matter, yeah.

2193
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:44,690
We did this fucking yesterday, I'm so stupid.

2194
02:13:45,610 --> 02:13:46,050
Oh god.

2195
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:46,990
It's right there.

2196
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:50,330
Who's next?

2197
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:52,310
The fire just wants to play everyone.

2198
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:54,530
He will not plus R2.

2199
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:55,330
Let's go, Kony.

2200
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,230
I should have Ali kicked more.

2201
02:13:58,690 --> 02:13:59,350
Let's go, goat.

2202
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:00,690
Let's go, goat!

2203
02:14:05,110 --> 02:14:05,870
Come out, Kony.

2204
02:14:06,110 --> 02:14:06,810
Bring it back.

2205
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:08,430
Redeem me.

2206
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:12,130
Oh, I got a good stage.

2207
02:14:12,730 --> 02:14:12,930
Ooh.

2208
02:14:13,210 --> 02:14:15,810
It's the comet, asteroid, whatever it is.

2209
02:14:16,970 --> 02:14:18,810
Floor blast on the third round, yeah.

2210
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:19,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2211
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:26,560
Yeah, she's always going to start off with that side step.

2212
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,800
Round one.

2213
02:14:28,540 --> 02:14:28,800
Shoulder.

2214
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:30,500
I hate fighting her and me.

2215
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:34,000
Yeah, she can be an

2216
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:43,050
enemy.

2217
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:43,910
Oh.

2218
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:45,190
Got it.

2219
02:14:46,010 --> 02:14:46,890
Island Kony.

2220
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,850
Island Kony.

2221
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:48,970
Come out, Kony!

2222
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:51,370
The Bahamas.

2223
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:52,010
Nice!

2224
02:14:54,530 --> 02:14:55,570
Round two.

2225
02:14:56,090 --> 02:14:57,230
The coach didn't teach her that.

2226
02:14:57,990 --> 02:15:00,010
They will by the tournament time.

2227
02:15:00,190 --> 02:15:00,270
Yep.

2228
02:15:00,590 --> 02:15:01,230
Yeah, definitely.

2229
02:15:01,450 --> 02:15:02,930
Do you think they're using you?

2230
02:15:03,490 --> 02:15:05,410
You're so cute right now.

2231
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:05,770
Oh.

2232
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:08,850
Yeah, I'm just gonna abuse that.

2233
02:15:09,070 --> 02:15:10,530
Oh my god.

2234
02:15:10,910 --> 02:15:11,490
Your points.

2235
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:14,790
That's just our layer one, so that's okay.

2236
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:26,020
I tried to go the muscle buster.

2237
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:27,600
Yeah, I would have exploded the wall.

2238
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:28,300
Nice.

2239
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:31,660
That's what I'm trying to land here.

2240
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:33,760
I don't want to try to force it too much though.

2241
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:36,400
What the fuck?

2242
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:37,640
Oh my god, she broke it.

2243
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:38,600
Wow.

2244
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:40,880
Got it.

2245
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:42,420
It's a resting button.

2246
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:43,380
That was insane.

2247
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:43,960
Yeah.

2248
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:45,160
We're in your regular combo now.

2249
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:47,140
Sorry.

2250
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:47,400
Oh no!

2251
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:48,560
I got it.

2252
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:48,900
I got it.

2253
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:49,080
I got it.

2254
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:56,800
If she's smart, she'll switch the changes.

2255
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:58,460
Yeah.

2256
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:00,600
Because you can, but...

I mean, I didn't earlier.

2258
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:05,400
I don't think it...

2259
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,960
Has anyone actually swapped a stage?

02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:51,390
Oh.

2265
02:16:52,210 --> 02:16:53,910
So I can just control pace.

2266
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:55,690
Oh my goodness.

2267
02:16:55,890 --> 02:16:57,730
I'm going to do that to SK in the finals.

2268
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:58,630
Yup.

2269
02:16:59,310 --> 02:17:00,570
Oh, she doesn't take try and swing.

2270
02:17:02,370 --> 02:17:02,690
Oh.

2271
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:03,910
God, bro.

2272
02:17:04,010 --> 02:17:04,650
You're nice.

2273
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:10,690
If she's struggling to sprint to me now, the alley kicks.

2274
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:12,750
Like she's scrambling to find an opening.

2275
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:15,810
So if I just swing every time, it's like, I don't know.

2276
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,910
I think her brain scrambled.

2277
02:17:17,430 --> 02:17:17,690
Yeah.

2278
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:18,610
It's annoying.

2279
02:17:19,950 --> 02:17:22,270
This matchup's very annoying, so I get it.

2280
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:24,770
Or not the matchup, but I guess King.

2281
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:27,050
Yeah, King was annoying.

2282
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:32,650
She's breaking every map.

2283
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:33,870
Yeah, she's breaking.

2284
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:35,570
A counter hit throws, too.

2285
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:39,270
Is she matching or is she actually knowing the tech?

2286
02:17:39,390 --> 02:17:41,490
Well, she's broken both twos and threes.

2287
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:43,130
Or twos and ones, so.

2288
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:44,550
And this might end up.

2289
02:17:44,550 --> 02:17:45,110
Two and one plus two.

2290
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:46,270
Yeah, so much.

2291
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:46,770
She's got.

2292
02:17:46,830 --> 02:17:47,490
Nice job.

2293
02:17:47,550 --> 02:17:47,970
All right.

2294
02:17:48,110 --> 02:17:53,790
Okay, let's just assume it won't be that fee in finals, but
I appreciate the points lightweight baby.

2295
02:17:53,890 --> 02:18:02,330
Yeah, fee has to teach her that like that should not hit
like just lay down, you know All right, let me read my fang

2296
02:18:02,330 --> 02:18:03,870
notes fang way.

2297
02:18:03,870 --> 02:18:13,360
All right, you got it really hard good I believe in you Oh,
wait, was it this guy?

2298
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,480
I think it was this guy, right?

2299
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:15,700
Or am I thinking of ray?

2300
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:25,500
It's one of the things fair light is the fang who is pretty
hard okay we talked about it and remember uh slime he's

2301
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:30,680
gonna lay down in a lot of okie situations when you like to
do the running one plus two so that's a forward forward two

2302
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:42,620
yep and don't start the round with the buttons he's always
waiting for you okay maybe you can start with like a down

2303
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:50,780
back two maybe if you really want something and back one
plus two hunting bears stands one plus two will probably get

What the fuck?

2320

Where did your HP go?

2321
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:56,280
How did two grab?

2322
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,000
That's a one or two.

2323
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,560
You could have killed him if you did the wall combo.

2324
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:00,660
Yeah.

2325
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:06,850
Fight.

2326
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:09,450
Okay, we got this.

2327
02:21:15,890 --> 02:21:16,990
Oh my god.

2328
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:20,310
There it is.

2329
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:21,330
There it is.

2330
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:21,730
I'll get him.

2331
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:22,010
Nice.

2332
02:21:22,450 --> 02:21:23,170
There we go.

2333
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:23,750
Oh, Jake left didn't work.

2334
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,990
That's okay.

2335
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:24,930
Good shit.

2336
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:25,670
Nice!

2337
02:21:28,130 --> 02:21:28,730
Yeah!

2338
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:30,270
Oh, Jake left didn't work.

2339
02:21:31,310 --> 02:21:32,410
Round four.

2340
02:21:33,390 --> 02:21:33,850
Fight.

2341
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:34,550
Fight.

2342
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:37,900
Ooh!

2343
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:44,020
No.

2344
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,840
I thought he'd do a low, he just kept doing the running one.

2345
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:50,160
Can I step that?

2346
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:51,760
If I know what's coming?

2347
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:58,280
Not if, yeah, but if you, if he hits you with it and it
knocks you down and then you tag, then probably not.

2348
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,200
He just shouldn't do that pose.

2349
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:06,060
When he's T-O-ing, I mean, if you can react to it, you block
that, you can twin piston it.

2350
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:08,580
T-O is really bad, that shoulder.

2351
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:11,740
Round one,

2352
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:16,700
fight.

2353
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:21,460
Oh my god.

2354
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:28,160
We have to threaten the hunting bear, grab.

2355
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:42,160
I'm really bad, man.

2356
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:43,620
I can't fucking...

2357
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:44,640
All right.

2358
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:45,260
Let's play the game.

2359
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:47,320
He's definitely overwhelming for sure.

2360
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:51,480
That was sick.

2361
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,440
You can also that roll guard break remember.

2362
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:09,910
No way.

2363
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:23,160
I would definitely rage guard him after he does something
like that.

2364
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:24,100
Like a heat burst.

2365
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:24,700
Yeah.

2366
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:25,460
You have it.

2367
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:27,620
He's mashing every time.

2368
02:23:35,870 --> 02:23:36,390
Oops.

2369
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,750
Okay.

2370
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:45,170
Yeah, he's breaking one plus two every time.

2371
02:23:45,410 --> 02:23:46,550
Oh, the punish!

2372
02:23:49,490 --> 02:23:51,030
Oh my god!

2373
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:52,070
Go slam!

2374
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:53,430
He's flying.

2375
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:53,930
Not yet.

2376
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:54,810
Oh, nice.

2377
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:55,330
Yeah!

2378
02:23:56,210 --> 02:23:57,290
Oh, cool, man.

2379
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:58,250
Good dive.

2380
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:06,890
Hmm, how does that work?

2381
02:24:09,070 --> 02:24:09,730
Tio!

2382
02:24:09,810 --> 02:24:16,150
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2383
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:20,170
Always grabbing from Oku when he gets get up.

2384
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:22,330
Oh wow.

2385
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:25,750
I didn't know he could do another fucking kick.

2386
02:24:28,250 --> 02:24:30,290
What a being miserable fucking character.

2387
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:31,670

He's got a jack as hard as he can.

You can't look him in the eyes.

2412

Somebody's gonna start a fire.

02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:29,140
Well, remember when we were gonna bot review him?

2436
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:32,600
He did play Jack, yeah.

2437
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:37,560
Why do I- he's got a very legacy Jack, not a single Gamma
Hal.

2438
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:41,600
Yeah, he did- he didn't do- Oh my god, I hate this guy.

Send them to space, check.

2453
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,040
You're going into orbit.

2454
02:29:45,170 --> 02:29:46,290
Round two.

2455
02:29:47,290 --> 02:29:47,690
Fight.

2456
02:29:49,830 --> 02:29:50,670
That's not fair.

2457
02:29:51,730 --> 02:29:52,190
That's your point.

2458
02:29:53,550 --> 02:29:54,570
Spamming is banned.

2459
02:29:54,890 --> 02:29:55,930

No, no, no.

2461
02:29:57,690 --> 02:29:59,190
Allie kicks have been paying us.

02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:04,490
We need the alley kicks.

2463

2464
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:15,610
The fact that it worked, like, not once, but three times in
a row was what surprised me.

2465
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:16,150
What is she doing?

2466
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:20,430
If you stepped on her head, she would die.

02:30:22,190 --> 02:30:36,090
is she doing that that is not an advantageous position like
a watermelon she weighs like a hundred and ten pounds all

2551
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:02,250

2565
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:46,590
He's doing it.

2566
02:37:49,230 --> 02:37:49,270

2578
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:16,480
Oh, look at all these blocks.

2580
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:25,500

02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:37,170
Take him to a wall, yes!

2586
02:38:37,410 --> 02:38:38,970
Real freaky hours.

2587
02:38:39,450 --> 02:38:41,090
We're in the basement now.

2588
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:42,210
It's wall time.

2589
02:38:42,570 --> 02:38:43,410
What if we get the wall?

2590
02:38:44,130 --> 02:38:45,630

2591
02:38:46,410 --> 02:38:47,090

2593
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:49,270
Oh.

2594
02:38:49,450 --> 02:38:50,410
He blocked that.

2595
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:51,070
Oh.

2596
02:38:51,570 --> 02:38:53,550
Yeah, he has to rest a little.

2597
02:38:54,310 --> 02:38:55,890
He's got no clutch bone, no clutch bone.

2598
02:38:58,090 --> 02:39:00,270
What the fuck did he just do?

2599
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:03,530
Oh, I pressed.

2600
02:39:04,750 --> 02:39:05,110
No!

2601
02:39:05,710 --> 02:39:06,850
Nice try, nice try, nice try.

02:39:07,130 --> 02:39:07,490
Yeah.

2603
02:39:07,490 --> 02:39:08,110
That was nice.

2604
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:11,850
That was a good rage art.

2605
02:39:12,730 --> 02:39:13,010
Yeah.

2606
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:13,610
That was good.

2607
02:39:14,170 --> 02:39:15,830
That was a really good rage art.

2608
02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:16,230
Shit.

2609
02:39:16,890 --> 02:39:17,230
All right.

2610
02:39:17,370 --> 02:39:18,330
Well, that was a good fight though.

2611
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:18,690
That was good.

2612
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:19,270

02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:21,670
Oh!

2614
02:39:22,490 --> 02:39:24,190
Masha was insane.

2615
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:24,690
Mm-hmm.

2616
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:30,040
Download.

2617
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:32,300
He's only 26 Daniels.

2618
02:39:32,340 --> 02:39:33,480
You're 100 Daniels.

2619
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:37,960
Come on, you win this, you'll be 120 Daniels.

2620
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:38,320
Mm-hmm.

2621
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:39,380
You steal his Daniels.

2622
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:39,780
Yeah.

2623
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:43,220
Those Daniels need a new home.

2624
02:39:58,560 --> 02:39:59,040
Oh.

2625
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:01,140

02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:53,080
Oh my god, you're a player.

2629
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:55,500
Oh my god, those ducks!

2630
02:40:55,880 --> 02:40:56,580
Let's go.

2631
02:40:58,900 --> 02:41:00,760
It's like he actually knows how to play Tekken.

2632
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:01,760
Fight.

2633
02:41:06,860 --> 02:41:07,320
Nice.

2634
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:08,540
Oh my god, that camera.

2635
02:41:10,140 --> 02:41:11,260
Oh, Dauper!

2636
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,000
It's his alley kick.

2637
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,040
His brain is scrambled.

2638
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:15,980
His brain is scrambled.

2639
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:16,740
The alley kick!

2640
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:19,320
No one knows what to do!

2641
02:41:19,460 --> 02:41:20,380
His brain is scrambled.

2642
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:22,520
Do it again!

2643
02:41:24,580 --> 02:41:25,100
Let's fucking go!

2644
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:25,980
Let's fucking go!

2645
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:27,920
I think he scrambled, bro.

2646
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:33,040
He saw what I did to SK and he got worried.

2647
02:41:33,620 --> 02:41:35,320
His brain is hot right now.

2648
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,740
Oh, whoa, that was a good sidestep.

2649
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,360
Nice.

2650
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:47,780
Oh!

2651
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,240
Hmm.

2652
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:00,640
Oh, my God.

2653
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:01,540
Yeah.

2654
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:05,560
A bomb.

2655
02:42:08,710 --> 02:42:09,210
Let's go.

2656
02:42:09,210 --> 02:42:10,230
Oh, they're doing nothing to win that.

2657
02:42:10,370 --> 02:42:11,670
I'm going to attack him last.

2658
02:42:11,950 --> 02:42:12,650
There it is.

2659
02:42:13,870 --> 02:42:14,250
I agree.

2660
02:42:14,930 --> 02:42:15,610
Let's go, coach.

2661
02:42:16,010 --> 02:42:16,210
Yes.

2662
02:42:16,390 --> 02:42:17,570
Take the win.

2663
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:20,490
Good shit, dude.

2664
02:42:21,170 --> 02:42:22,510
Oh, not even close.

2665
02:42:22,910 --> 02:42:23,730
Not even close.

2666
02:42:24,650 --> 02:42:25,690
It's because he used to play melee.

2667
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:26,530
Yeah, sure.

2668
02:42:26,650 --> 02:42:27,050

02:43:29,570 --> 02:43:31,590
I got all demons every single day of my life.

2677
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:32,330
I'm fighting them.

2678
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:33,210
I'm falling asleep.

2679
02:43:33,330 --> 02:43:34,050
And you beat them all.

2680
02:43:34,290 --> 02:43:36,110
You haven't lost yet, Jack.

2681
02:43:36,730 --> 02:43:38,010
I will be losing.

2682
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:41,250
You've literally been saying that for two slams.

2683
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:42,130
It's his strat.

2684
02:43:42,350 --> 02:43:44,410
It's like his reverse jinx.

2685
02:43:44,970 --> 02:43:49,650
It's actually impossible for me to lose because if I lose,
then I'll say, yeah, I told you guys I would lose.

2686
02:43:49,810 --> 02:43:51,630
But if I don't, then I look like a fucking god.

2687
02:43:52,490 --> 02:43:54,870
You let that thing get me last this.

2694
02:45:11,810 --> 02:45:12,370
Yeah.

2695
02:45:15,210 --> 02:45:17,050
Guys, I don't belong in this Elo.

2696
02:45:17,210 --> 02:45:19,170
I literally lucked out on this Elo.

2697
02:45:19,710 --> 02:45:21,750
I brute forced my way into this Elo.

2698
02:45:25,850 --> 02:45:29,770
Like, literally, I have not been playing that much Tekken.

2699
02:45:30,810 --> 02:45:33,670
I'm pretty... I don't think I belong here.

2700
02:45:39,910 --> 02:45:40,990
Oh no.

2701
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:41,530
Please.

2702
02:45:42,110 --> 02:45:42,990
Leave me alone.

2703
02:45:44,750 --> 02:45:46,650
I don't even know how to juggle.

2704
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:50,530
That's how I don't belong here.

2705
02:45:53,550 --> 02:45:57,110
I don't even know how to juggle people.

2706
02:46:04,010 --> 02:46:04,610
Yay!

2707
02:46:06,490 --> 02:46:08,050
Whoops, that was an accident.

2708
02:46:09,450 --> 02:46:10,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2709
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:13,610
Here you go.

2710
02:46:15,390 --> 02:46:17,730
Curried by alley kicks.

2711
02:46:18,470 --> 02:46:21,890
Bro, some people spend their entire lives fucking grinding
to this elo.

2712
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:24,570
I don't know how I get here.

2713
02:46:26,530 --> 02:46:28,210
That's the saddest part.

2714
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:32,190
Some people spent their entire lives getting here.

2715
02:46:32,330 --> 02:46:33,350
Oh, I just existed.

2716
02:46:36,990 --> 02:46:38,930
I at least kicked my way to victory.

2717
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:59,560
I think, like, including the games now, I think I have 30
hours on Tekken.

2718
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:02,280
30 hours on Tekken for a red rank.

2719
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:03,520
It just works!

2720
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:05,180
Just don't use it.

2721
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:19,220
told you i don't i don't belong here the moment i learned uh
for like a fifth and sixth move i i went up to rings like

2722
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:27,480
yesterday i was at i think dominator i think yesterday i was
at dominator i think i started at dominator or something

2723
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:33,680
right and then in like and then when i learned the fifth and
I went up to red.

2724
02:47:34,480 --> 02:47:38,320
So, like, every move unlocks a rink.

2725
02:47:41,380 --> 02:47:43,120
She keeps getting away.

2726
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:44,140
I don't know how.

2727
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:46,480
I don't know how I keep doing it.

2728
02:47:46,680 --> 02:47:47,540
It's actually crazy.

2729
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:49,720
Like, I literally don't know what I'm doing.

2730
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:55,520
Like, I should not be getting away with this.

2731
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:56,520
Is this the same guy?

2732
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:57,080
Is it?

2733
02:47:57,640 --> 02:47:58,540
I'm sorry, bro.

2734
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:21,820
Bro, get your back natural instinct bro I'd be mad like no

2735
02:48:21,820 --> 02:48:30,460

angry I I'm pretty sure he's angry

2736
02:48:34,090 --> 02:48:36,790
I'd be angry too, not gonna lie.

2737
02:48:38,270 --> 02:48:39,010
Yay!

2738
02:48:40,330 --> 02:48:40,650
Boop!

2739
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:43,250
Oh, oh, he actually defended that.

2740
02:48:43,830 --> 02:48:44,070
Oh!

2741
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:49,430
Please!

2742
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:50,490
I'm sorry!

2743
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:52,130
I'm sorry!

2744
02:48:54,810 --> 02:48:55,850
I'm so sorry!

2745
02:48:59,110 --> 02:48:59,850
Please!

2746
02:49:00,450 --> 02:49:01,870
I'm so sorry!

2747
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:11,770
I'm sorry.

2748
02:49:13,290 --> 02:49:14,310
Wait, he actually blocked those.

2749
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:16,950
You know, that's when you know he's like an actual gamer.

2750
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:23,510
Oh, shit.

2751
02:49:23,910 --> 02:49:24,230
Oh, my God.

2752
02:49:24,390 --> 02:49:24,830
He's sidestepped.

2753
02:49:24,950 --> 02:49:25,990
He actually knows what he's doing.

2754
02:49:27,130 --> 02:49:28,690
I literally got here as a fluke.

2755
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:32,370
He got his Elo back.

2756
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:37,250
He figured me out.

2757
02:49:37,270 --> 02:49:38,190
Lobby time.

2758
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:38,630
Okay.

2759
02:49:39,490 --> 02:49:41,090
This is why I won and done people.

2760
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:46,290
Because like they figure it out by the second game.

2761
02:49:47,830 --> 02:49:49,730
Alright, here I'll go.

2762
02:49:50,990 --> 02:49:52,030
Where's the lobby at?

2763
02:49:52,090 --> 02:49:52,830
There it is.

I should have done more alley kicks.

2798
02:53:38,950 --> 02:53:39,370
It's only hop kick on five.

2799
02:53:39,550 --> 02:53:40,110
It's only hop kick on five.

2800
02:53:40,110 --> 02:53:40,790
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2801
02:53:41,970 --> 02:53:42,450

02:53:42,450 --> 02:53:42,830
Yeah, that's true.

2803
02:53:43,070 --> 02:53:43,690
Grab or something after.

Oh, he ducks now.

2805
02:53:46,950 --> 02:53:51,190
I think like after what I did to him, he's got, he like
learned.

2806
02:53:52,050 --> 02:53:52,690
What a darn.

2807
02:53:53,070 --> 02:53:53,330

2809
02:53:55,690 --> 02:53:56,170
Oh, cool.

2810
02:53:57,610 --> 02:53:58,410

2811
02:53:58,710 --> 02:53:59,270
This shit.

2812
02:53:59,690 --> 02:54:00,070
Nice.

2813
02:54:00,830 --> 02:54:01,310
Nice!

2814
02:54:01,370 --> 02:54:02,490
Oh, good legend.

2815
02:54:02,770 --> 02:54:03,410
Oh, you're a legend.

2816
02:54:05,390 --> 02:54:06,430
Good shit!

2817
02:54:07,550 --> 02:54:08,590
Unbelievably nuts.

2818
02:54:08,710 --> 02:54:09,070
Oh shit.

2819
02:54:09,470 --> 02:54:12,170
He doesn't do that thing that abused him last time, you
know?

2820
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:14,350
Yeah, that string.

2821
02:54:14,550 --> 02:54:16,330
Yeah, he doesn't do that anymore.

2822
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:18,810
Because I think he got tilted with that.

2823
02:54:20,210 --> 02:54:20,690
Wait, what?

2824
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:21,270
It didn't hit?

2825
02:54:21,310 --> 02:54:22,730
Oh, the timing was crazy.

2826
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:23,550
It worked!

2827
02:54:24,730 --> 02:54:26,230
Oh, what the fuck?

2828
02:54:27,450 --> 02:54:27,970
Okay.

2829
02:54:28,350 --> 02:54:29,190
He was ready for that.

2830
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:30,070
Yeah.

2831
02:54:31,310 --> 02:54:31,830
Fight!

2832
02:54:33,390 --> 02:54:36,270
Oh, that's not that one.

2833
02:54:36,970 --> 02:54:38,370
Oh, that was an accident.

2834
02:54:42,930 --> 02:54:45,090
Oh, no, he got me.

2835
02:54:46,310 --> 02:54:46,430
What?

2836
02:54:46,950 --> 02:54:48,110
How does he do that?

2837
02:54:48,950 --> 02:54:49,770
This is a good scrap.

2838
02:54:49,850 --> 02:54:50,510
Now it was square.

2839
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:51,990

02:54:54,050 --> 02:54:54,870

Good try.

2846
02:55:00,850 --> 02:55:02,210

How come that doesn't work?

2858
02:56:08,470 --> 02:56:09,290
He ducked it.

2859
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:12,230
He actually ducks?

2860
02:56:13,390 --> 02:56:13,550
Yeah.

2861
02:56:13,690 --> 02:56:14,290
He's mixing it up.

2862
02:56:14,970 --> 02:56:17,050
So you run into him and do the knee to mix up.

2863
02:56:17,490 --> 02:56:18,150
Remember that running knee.

2864
02:56:18,270 --> 02:56:18,590
Yeah.

2865
02:56:22,370 --> 02:56:22,790

Yeah, the square.

2902
02:57:18,230 --> 02:57:19,190
Because he's a square.

skull necklace That's true, that's true He was one punch man

2911
02:57:48,490 --> 02:57:50,210

Oh, that's okay.

2922
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:08,000
Lots of grabs.

02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,220
Do again.

2924
02:59:11,140 --> 02:59:11,420
Okay.

2925
02:59:13,640 --> 02:59:14,780
Lots of grabs.

02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:15,900
Okay.

2927
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:18,320

2929
02:59:21,540 --> 02:59:22,240
Wow.

2930
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:23,480
Big counter hit.

2931
02:59:24,980 --> 02:59:26,220
What the hell?

2932
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:28,400
Nice.

2933
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:30,600
Nice.

2934
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:31,220
Good weight.

2935
02:59:35,500 --> 02:59:37,220
Oh, that goes back so far.

2936
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:39,360
You forward to one that if you block that.

2937
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:42,560
Okay.

2938
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:45,960
Damn, they all train against Kings.

2939
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:47,340
Got it.

2940
02:59:47,360 --> 02:59:48,360
Ooh, that was...

2941
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:48,520
Nice!

2942
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:49,820
Wow, what a swing.

2943
02:59:50,340 --> 02:59:50,680
Nice jump.

2944
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:56,160
Start off with Kankans.

2945
02:59:59,020 --> 03:00:02,820
My guess is she's starting with Kankans because her coach
told her to go the low on Power Crush.

2946
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:04,900
Do you have them pulled out?

2947
03:00:06,060 --> 03:00:07,080
No, just a guess.

2948
03:00:07,300 --> 03:00:07,680
Okay, okay.

2949
03:00:10,280 --> 03:00:22,120
that'd be a crazy intelligence yeah oh my god hit her out of
that that's crazy angle slam wait i thought she was dead

2950
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:30,500
yeah i didn't press anything yeah it's for you after angle
slam she has hadukin as well so be careful no she lost her

2951
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:40,300
heat though she doesn't have heat oh i'm looking at the
other fucking guy sorry you're looking at her teammate Oh my

2952
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:41,020

2953
03:00:41,320 --> 03:00:41,780
All right.

2954
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:42,980
Got it.

2955
03:00:42,980 --> 03:00:43,300
Nice.

2956
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:45,660
Jab, jab.

2957
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:51,460
Apparently so much chat said, like, this team actually
exclusively trained against kings.

2958
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:52,940
That makes sense.

2959
03:00:54,620 --> 03:00:55,780
And where is it getting them?

2960
03:00:56,020 --> 03:00:56,960
Like, let's do it real here.

2961
03:00:57,500 --> 03:00:58,180
Oh, how many?

2962
03:00:58,600 --> 03:00:59,340
Oh, I know.

2963
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:00,800
I didn't think it was out of time.

2964
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:03,760
Doki Bird special.

2965
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:06,300
They never trained against this, though.

2966
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:10,200
Oh, almost.

2967
03:01:10,440 --> 03:01:10,700
Good job.

2968
03:01:11,440 --> 03:01:12,220
Nice win punish.

2969
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:12,680
What the fuck?

2970
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:13,900
Allie kick is free there.

2971
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:15,240
Allie kick.

2972
03:01:15,380 --> 03:01:15,840
Oh, fuck.

2973
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:16,260
You're right.

2974
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:18,180
Nice.

2975
03:01:18,360 --> 03:01:18,420
Nice.

2976
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:21,840
Let's go.

2977
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:23,680
Yeah.

2978
03:01:25,440 --> 03:01:26,180
Let's go.

2979
03:01:26,260 --> 03:01:29,520
They might have beat my king, but they haven't beat Koni's
king.

2980
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:32,120
Coach Koni.

2981
03:01:32,920 --> 03:01:35,120
You can't download him.

2982
03:01:35,820 --> 03:01:36,420
He's can-canning.

2983
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:37,240
Here it is.

2984
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:41,280
Oh, she's scrambling at a block.

2985
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:43,660
Our beautiful, beautiful patient man.

2986
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:50,060
Not a good reaction time.

2987
03:01:51,640 --> 03:01:52,240
No, no.

2988
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,180
What am I just talking about, dude?

2989
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:57,120
I know where it's channeled it.

2990
03:01:57,400 --> 03:01:58,140
I remember.

2991
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:02,160
That was unreal, dude.

2992
03:02:05,540 --> 03:02:06,320
That's okay.

2993
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:07,320

It's your turn.

3004
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:51,840
Get me in there.

3005
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:54,220
Well, Kony also has to...

3006
03:03:54,220 --> 03:03:55,260
Yeah, there it is.

3007
03:03:55,660 --> 03:03:55,880
Alright.

3008
03:03:57,620 --> 03:03:58,420
Here we go.

3009
03:03:59,580 --> 03:04:00,520
Oh man.

3010
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:05,660
Can you imagine if this was a Street Fighter slam and like
the team had like three Zangiefs?

3011
03:04:05,660 --> 03:04:06,300
Yeah, right.

3012
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:09,720
That team would lose badly.

3013
03:04:10,740 --> 03:04:11,540
Yeah, exactly.

3014
03:04:11,740 --> 03:04:13,240
Is that like the king equivalent?

3015
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:15,180
No, he's a grappler.

3016
03:04:15,240 --> 03:04:17,060
He's a grappler in Street Fighter.

3017
03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:19,300
Actually, I don't know.

3018
03:04:19,400 --> 03:04:25,100
I feel like low-level zanky if especially on modern like a
guile is not gonna know what to do Like a first-week guile,

3019
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:31,820
you know what I mean Same stages last time tell them to get
a street fighter three hondas would fuck yeah hondas a

3020
03:04:31,820 --> 03:04:37,780
better equipped hondas would fuck people up You know in a
street fighter sling that character is Annoying if you're

3021
03:04:37,780 --> 03:04:47,500
new Good shit Make a presence nice Download him

3022
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:07,430
I mean, do that, but this works.

3023
03:05:07,710 --> 03:05:09,450
No, it doesn't.

3024
03:05:10,170 --> 03:05:10,750
Close, though.

3025
03:05:11,130 --> 03:05:11,410
Close, though.

3026
03:05:11,950 --> 03:05:12,970
I didn't think I'd launch on that.

3027
03:05:13,250 --> 03:05:15,730
Yeah, the but would have been guaranteed that.

3028
03:05:20,240 --> 03:05:21,040
Oh, nice.

3029
03:05:27,950 --> 03:05:29,070
Look at the chip.

3030
03:05:29,410 --> 03:05:29,610
Jesus.

3031
03:05:29,910 --> 03:05:30,350
Oh, geez.

3032
03:05:30,350 --> 03:05:30,930
Can't get out of pressure.

3033
03:05:31,090 --> 03:05:32,710
We talked about that.

3034
03:05:33,170 --> 03:05:33,510
Okay.

3035
03:05:41,970 --> 03:05:42,530
Wow.

3036
03:05:43,610 --> 03:05:43,770
Wow.

3037
03:05:44,870 --> 03:05:45,530
He got a broken.

3038
03:05:45,670 --> 03:05:46,630
He knew it.

3039
03:05:48,050 --> 03:05:48,610
Nice.

3040
03:05:50,010 --> 03:05:53,670
He got up wrong.

3041
03:05:55,930 --> 03:05:56,810
Oh, God.

3042
03:05:56,910 --> 03:05:57,810
That was a fun test then.

3043
03:05:58,390 --> 03:05:58,930
Oh.

3044
03:06:01,410 --> 03:06:01,830
Oh.

3045
03:06:01,850 --> 03:06:02,850
Smack him.

3046
03:06:04,530 --> 03:06:05,170
Okay.

3047
03:06:05,630 --> 03:06:07,070
That was good punished by that guy.

3048
03:06:07,710 --> 03:06:11,630
Nice job.

3049
03:06:18,030 --> 03:06:19,710
Is that true?

3050
03:06:20,390 --> 03:06:20,650
Yeah.

3051
03:06:21,090 --> 03:06:21,550
Wow.

3052
03:06:21,910 --> 03:06:23,630
That's the main character.

3053
03:06:24,570 --> 03:06:26,450
He has the main character buff.

3054
03:06:26,590 --> 03:06:27,370
That's not fair.

3055
03:06:32,070 --> 03:06:33,870
Why does this fucking launch?

3056
03:06:33,890 --> 03:06:34,890
What is this shit?

3057
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:44,400
That's how the map is going.

3058
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:45,220
I'm trying to do it.

3059
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:49,320
He's doing this 2-1-4 and it's like a high mid-mid.

3060
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:50,620
It's like two punches and a kick.

3061
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:52,300
He keeps counter hitting you.

3062
03:06:52,580 --> 03:06:52,960
Can I kick left it?

3063
03:06:53,920 --> 03:06:54,320
No.

3064
03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:56,040
If he delays it, yeah.

3065
03:06:56,660 --> 03:06:58,620
But he's not delaying it.

3066
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:00,880
Round one.

3067
03:07:01,880 --> 03:07:02,180
Fight.

3068
03:07:06,490 --> 03:07:07,010
Oh.

3069
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:10,690

3070
03:07:17,640 --> 03:07:21,420
oh i'm bad i'm bad sorry you'll get used to it

3071
03:07:28,670 --> 03:07:34,490

3072
03:07:34,490 --> 03:07:42,350

he takes it really slow right yeah he's not doing a lot

3073
03:07:44,650 --> 03:07:45,090
Yeah.

3074
03:07:47,350 --> 03:07:49,130
Oh, that's what we're talking about, baby!

3075
03:07:49,570 --> 03:07:50,250
Oh, guaranteed.

3076
03:07:50,530 --> 03:07:50,950
That's crazy.

3077
03:07:51,510 --> 03:07:53,230
It's all good.

3078
03:07:53,370 --> 03:07:53,910
You got a big lead.

3079
03:07:57,870 --> 03:07:59,630
Oh my god, what a timing.

3080
03:08:04,110 --> 03:08:04,350
Why?

3081
03:08:08,350 --> 03:08:08,590
Dude.

3082
03:08:08,830 --> 03:08:09,770
I hate this fucking Pokemon.

3083
03:08:10,130 --> 03:08:13,210
I remember you have a heat.

3084
03:08:13,510 --> 03:08:14,150
Just burst.

3085
03:08:14,450 --> 03:08:15,370
It's like the end of the round.

3086
03:08:16,470 --> 03:08:16,610
Yeah.

3087
03:08:18,990 --> 03:08:20,850
How does that fucking happen, dude?

3088
03:08:21,770 --> 03:08:23,970
If I'm holding back, I don't think I'm gonna do it.

3089
03:08:26,460 --> 03:08:27,200
Come on, buddy.

3090
03:08:29,960 --> 03:08:30,720
Alright, good start.

3091
03:08:31,960 --> 03:08:32,760
4.42.

3092
03:08:33,820 --> 03:08:35,020
I'm looking at these.

3093
03:08:36,480 --> 03:08:37,660
I know it's a duck here.

3094
03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:39,020
God, what a bot.

3095
03:08:40,340 --> 03:08:42,000
Also a nice person in real life.

3096
03:08:42,100 --> 03:08:43,060
I fucking hope so.

3097
03:08:44,660 --> 03:08:45,760
I think so.

3098
03:08:45,900 --> 03:08:46,500
I think so.

3099
03:08:46,940 --> 03:08:48,300
Sean Clare, Sean Clare, Sean Clare.

3100
03:08:48,420 --> 03:08:49,300
Jen is strong.

3101
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:50,640
Jen is power.

3102
03:08:50,660 --> 03:08:51,300
No, no.

3103
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:52,740
I'm just not blocking.

3104
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:54,300
I'm just fucking terrible.

3105
03:08:56,180 --> 03:08:57,640
He gave you a lot of cookies.

3106
03:08:57,820 --> 03:09:00,380
He whiffed a few times.

3107
03:09:01,480 --> 03:09:02,200
It's okay, Matt.

3108
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:03,680
Matt takes it home for us.

3109
03:09:03,740 --> 03:09:03,940
Okay.

3110
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:05,220
I'm actually losing this one.

3111
03:09:05,340 --> 03:09:06,220

Jesus.

3116
03:09:13,460 --> 03:09:15,660
A religion started because of him.

It's cool, it's cool.

3130
03:10:17,180 --> 03:10:18,600
It's still not a lead.

3131
03:10:23,660 --> 03:10:24,000
Fuck.

3132
03:10:24,740 --> 03:10:25,040

You pressed, you have to hold it?

3139
03:11:01,340 --> 03:11:01,660
Fuck.

3140
03:11:04,960 --> 03:11:07,620
Nah, I mean, I should have canceled little bubble.

3141
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:09,580
I didn't come out.

3142
03:11:10,880 --> 03:11:11,060
It's alright.

3143
03:11:11,420 --> 03:11:11,420
Go.

3144
03:11:11,860 --> 03:11:12,220
It's alright.

3145
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:13,100
It's okay.

3146
03:11:13,480 --> 03:11:14,280
Just one set.

3147
03:11:14,740 --> 03:11:20,840
A lot of these strings that have these highs in them that if
you knew about them, you could like her 1-1 or 10 frame

3148
03:11:20,840 --> 03:11:21,980
punish is a high high.

3149
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:24,920
Also, there's two hits that go into chainsaws.

3150
03:11:25,180 --> 03:11:29,260
She only, well, I mean, I can't explain it now, but just
know there are gaps.

3151
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:34,560
Good block.

3152
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:44,580
Oh, Oh my god, I hate this guy.

3153
03:11:45,500 --> 03:11:46,460
Wow, again!

3154
03:11:47,360 --> 03:11:49,820
Yeah, let's bait out the hop kick then.

3155
03:11:51,980 --> 03:11:52,540
Boom.

3156
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:53,460
Nice.

3157
03:11:55,300 --> 03:11:56,720
What is that move?

3158
03:11:57,800 --> 03:11:58,800
I know, fuck Alyssa.

3159
03:11:59,240 --> 03:12:00,580
I hate playing against Jade.

3160
03:12:01,900 --> 03:12:02,160
Okay.

3161
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:03,840
Round 2.

3162
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:06,260
Let's get it.

3163
03:12:06,760 --> 03:12:07,200
Nice.

3164
03:12:09,820 --> 03:12:10,380
Big!

3165
03:12:10,880 --> 03:12:11,740
Big hit.

3166
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:14,800
Take her to the moon!

3167
03:12:18,120 --> 03:12:19,640
Get her out of this game!

3168
03:12:19,940 --> 03:12:20,420
Yes!

3169
03:12:23,060 --> 03:12:24,660
That string, that's the highest of chainsaw.

3170
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:25,580
Okay, okay, okay.

3171
03:12:26,860 --> 03:12:28,080
I literally just don't know the strings.

3172
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:29,960
Nice!

3173
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:30,960
Last hit!

3174
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:31,900
On the board!

3175
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:33,940
Not close at all.

3176
03:12:36,260 --> 03:12:37,940
Oh, what the fuck, man?

3177
03:12:47,340 --> 03:12:48,860
What the fuck this character?

3178
03:12:49,720 --> 03:12:50,240
What?

3179
03:12:50,520 --> 03:12:53,360
I mean, that's green, but even- Ah, yeah, we just said-
Okay.

3180
03:12:53,500 --> 03:12:57,160
Even this, this is gonna scale too, because Alyssa's always
in the air.

3181
03:12:57,940 --> 03:12:58,760
Wait, really?

3182
03:12:59,240 --> 03:13:00,160
That's crazy.

3183
03:13:00,520 --> 03:13:01,900
That's so dumb.

3184
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:05,160
Nice!

3185
03:13:05,700 --> 03:13:06,520
Oh, nice!

3186
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:07,720
Also in the air.

3187
03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:09,500
What the fuck?

3188
03:13:10,020 --> 03:13:10,500
Uh-oh.

3189
03:13:10,580 --> 03:13:11,600
Uh-oh.

3190
03:13:11,860 --> 03:13:12,860
Oh my god.

3191
03:13:12,860 --> 03:13:13,640
Wait, what happened?

3192
03:13:13,720 --> 03:13:15,240
I tried to blast off!

3193
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:17,700
The Patriot fist.

3194
03:13:19,360 --> 03:13:21,520
Okay, yeah, if I'm not doing this, then I'm not doing well.

3195
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:30,820
Oh, it's over for me, Boros.

3196
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:32,480
No.

3197
03:13:33,900 --> 03:13:35,240
I feel it.

3198
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:37,040
We turn this around.

3199
03:13:46,580 --> 03:13:47,860
Oh, I'm dead, bro.

3200
03:13:48,240 --> 03:13:48,880
Yeah, yeah.

3201
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:49,540
Good, good.

3202
03:13:49,540 --> 03:13:50,260
Try, man.

3203
03:13:50,380 --> 03:13:51,000
I'm getting good.

3204
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:52,040
No, let's try.

3205
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:52,800
You know what?

3206
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:54,320
We got the loss out of the way.

3207
03:13:54,580 --> 03:13:55,760
We got it out of the way.

3208
03:13:57,160 --> 03:14:01,340
Look, this team hard trained against us, so it makes sense,
you know?

3209
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:13,440
it although the streak is over that gives us a chance to
start a new streak that's right a better there it is there

3210
03:14:13,440 --> 03:14:21,260
it is it was even longer yeah and then look at this shit
another fucking elissa it's gonna go all the way to evo

3211
03:14:21,260 --> 03:14:33,760
makes you think i can't believe it they went anti-team bp i
mean they did that last time too after we won the uh the

3212
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:36,200
round That's so fucked up.

3213
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:37,240
That's true, Chet.

3214
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:40,000
Jack Jesus fell on Friday, he will rise on Sunday.

3215
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:40,780
Oh, true!

3216
03:14:42,160 --> 03:14:43,640
It is the Lord's Day.

3217
03:14:43,980 --> 03:14:44,860
It is the Lord's Day.

3218
03:14:45,640 --> 03:14:47,340
He died for our sins, guys.

3219
03:14:47,820 --> 03:14:49,540
Yeah, 2-Round Robin's probably hurt us more.

3220
03:14:49,760 --> 03:14:52,320
Because this happened to us last time, but...

3221
03:14:52,320 --> 03:14:53,640
Round 1.

3222
03:14:54,540 --> 03:14:55,040
Fight.

3223
03:14:55,580 --> 03:14:56,460
Good shit.

3224
03:14:56,600 --> 03:14:56,720
Ooh.

3225
03:14:59,580 --> 03:15:01,000
He is so fast.

3226
03:15:01,380 --> 03:15:03,200
Coach, you need to train us for the scene.

3227
03:15:07,930 --> 03:15:08,690
Jesus.

3228
03:15:09,210 --> 03:15:09,750
Oh, my God.

3229
03:15:17,770 --> 03:15:18,290
Okay.

3230
03:15:18,910 --> 03:15:19,650
Yes, sir.

3231
03:15:20,490 --> 03:15:20,950
Hell yeah.

3232
03:15:22,470 --> 03:15:24,110
Come on, coach.

3233
03:15:24,330 --> 03:15:24,750
You're better.

3234
03:15:26,050 --> 03:15:27,630
Oh, we busted.

3235
03:15:29,410 --> 03:15:30,890
What am I doing?

3236
03:15:32,350 --> 03:15:34,450
We're having lots of fun.

3237
03:15:34,930 --> 03:15:35,390
Exactly.

3238
03:15:37,910 --> 03:15:38,990
Oh, look at her life.

3239
03:15:39,150 --> 03:15:39,810
There's a wall.

3240
03:15:39,830 --> 03:15:41,570
Oh, oh my god.

3241
03:15:41,590 --> 03:15:42,110
Did we send another?

3242
03:15:42,890 --> 03:15:43,490
Oh my god.

3243
03:15:43,590 --> 03:15:43,990
Did it again.

3244
03:15:44,370 --> 03:15:44,430
Oh, shoot.

3245
03:15:46,370 --> 03:15:46,490
Boom.

3246
03:15:50,770 --> 03:15:51,990
Let's go, baby.

3247
03:15:54,230 --> 03:15:54,230
A

3248
03:15:57,900 --> 03:16:00,580
bench match.

3249
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:03,620
Oh my god.

3250
03:16:05,720 --> 03:16:07,020
All those blocks.

3251
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:10,900
One day my coach would teach me how to block.

3252
03:16:14,360 --> 03:16:24,380
my one weakness oh wow what a fucking let's go it takes me
the elissa matchup what the fuck yeah we'll work on the

3253
03:16:24,380 --> 03:16:35,260
elissa matchup like tonight uncle the baptist you know i
think it's because like bravo didn't didn't coach matt that

3254
03:16:35,260 --> 03:16:41,540
was the issue no no no no no no he didn't help him at all He
didn't help.

3255
03:16:42,180 --> 03:16:43,160
He didn't help.

3256
03:16:43,400 --> 03:16:44,160
He didn't help him at all.

3257
03:16:44,400 --> 03:16:45,820
I didn't get shit for Alyssa.

3258
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:46,720
I did that myself.

3259
03:16:47,240 --> 03:16:48,020
He didn't help him at all.

3260
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:50,120
You clearly knew how to counter Alyssa.

3261
03:16:50,740 --> 03:16:52,700
I literally didn't get any Alyssa coaching.

3262
03:16:52,820 --> 03:16:53,460
I'm not anything.

3263
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:55,900
I went into replay.

3264
03:16:56,020 --> 03:16:57,180
I was like, oh, this is punishable?

3265
03:16:57,260 --> 03:16:57,580
Good to know.

3266
03:16:57,720 --> 03:16:58,380
And then I closed it.

3267
03:16:58,380 --> 03:17:01,740
He purposely did that, Matt, so he could look good in
comparison to you.

3268
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:05,640
Wait, what?

3269
03:17:05,740 --> 03:17:06,240
Oh my god.

3270
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:07,320
They swapped.

3271
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:07,800
Oh.

3272
03:17:08,040 --> 03:17:09,400
They're not doing Alyssa anymore.

3273
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:14,000
one fight whoa

3274
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:23,400
i was not expecting this we were all training for alissa

3275
03:17:31,780 --> 03:17:37,800
okay let's like if we don't press after that you got two
floors

3276
03:17:43,620 --> 03:17:46,740
it's back fight

3277
03:17:55,650 --> 03:17:56,210
Nice.

3278
03:18:00,210 --> 03:18:00,770
Oh.

3279
03:18:02,010 --> 03:18:03,590
Shake him to the wall!

3280
03:18:06,770 --> 03:18:07,610
Oh god.

3281
03:18:09,090 --> 03:18:09,390
Oh.

3282
03:18:23,610 --> 03:18:24,730
Jesus Christ.

3283
03:18:24,850 --> 03:18:25,910
Oh my god.

3284
03:18:26,570 --> 03:18:27,470
Push your back.

3285
03:18:27,470 --> 03:18:28,430
This is it.

3286
03:18:28,710 --> 03:18:31,330
I love that kick.

3287
03:18:31,450 --> 03:18:32,150
That's funny.

3288
03:18:32,350 --> 03:18:33,670
That's funny that he has that.

3289
03:18:34,070 --> 03:18:35,890
Yeah, like a specific back turn for me.

3290
03:18:37,690 --> 03:18:39,270
What the fuck?

3291
03:18:39,850 --> 03:18:40,250
Okay.

3292
03:18:41,010 --> 03:18:42,330
That was her throw break.

3293
03:18:42,550 --> 03:18:44,730
She tried the throw break, but it whiffed.

3294
03:18:57,790 --> 03:18:58,570
Let's get it.

3295
03:19:01,470 --> 03:19:04,250
I'm gonna see it soon, guys.

3296
03:19:05,390 --> 03:19:07,010
Oh, I saw it.

3297
03:19:08,250 --> 03:19:08,830
That's it.

3298
03:19:09,050 --> 03:19:10,790
Oh, that was... Do you step that?

3299
03:19:11,610 --> 03:19:12,250
You can't.

3300
03:19:12,350 --> 03:19:14,890
It got nerfed, but my punish didn't go through.

3301
03:19:15,650 --> 03:19:18,450
Oh, they made it so the second hit doesn't track anymore.

3302
03:19:18,490 --> 03:19:20,070
Oh my god, what?

3303
03:19:25,830 --> 03:19:27,190
You scared of the graph?

3304
03:19:30,370 --> 03:19:31,410
Knee loops.

3305
03:19:33,450 --> 03:19:33,970
Nice.

3306
03:19:34,590 --> 03:19:35,310
Oh my goodness.

3307
03:19:35,530 --> 03:19:37,070
Oh my god, it doesn't stop.

3308
03:19:37,210 --> 03:19:37,810
Oh, it stopped.

3309
03:19:38,170 --> 03:19:39,250
I'm feeling justice here.

3310
03:19:39,710 --> 03:19:40,090
Hey, hey.

3311
03:19:40,330 --> 03:19:41,090
I'm feeling justice.

3312
03:19:42,230 --> 03:19:43,930
I sense it in my bones.

3313
03:19:44,410 --> 03:19:44,590
Yep.

3314
03:19:46,190 --> 03:19:46,710

I believe you, new coach.

3332
03:22:42,310 --> 03:22:43,430
Did you

3333
03:22:52,480 --> 03:22:53,260
be accurate?

3334
03:23:03,880 --> 03:23:04,900
It's okay, guys.

3335
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:06,500
This is just round robin, guys.

3336
03:23:06,740 --> 03:23:07,540
It doesn't matter.

3337
03:23:07,980 --> 03:23:09,520
The finals is when it matters.

3338
03:23:10,380 --> 03:23:13,300
The finals is when we're gonna fucking kill everybody.

3339
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:16,520
It's not our fault everybody trained against us.

3340
03:23:19,060 --> 03:23:21,140
Like that's so fucked up.

3341
03:23:21,360 --> 03:23:23,540
Why did everybody hard train against me?

3342
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:25,540
I don't know what I'm doing.

3343
03:23:25,900 --> 03:23:28,540
I'm fucking brute forcing my way into this tournament

3344
03:23:32,960 --> 03:23:41,960
Yay True Why are you trading against me?

3345
03:23:44,440 --> 03:23:47,980
It might have been your time Yeah, but it's working.

3346
03:23:48,300 --> 03:23:48,640
Yeah.

3347
03:23:49,360 --> 03:23:52,420
But, like, but like, it's not our fault.

3348
03:23:52,900 --> 03:23:53,740
I can't believe.

3349
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:55,680
I can't believe people train against us.

3350
03:23:56,140 --> 03:23:57,380
That's actually so fucked up.

3351
03:23:59,320 --> 03:24:01,360
That's actually so fucked up.

3352
03:24:02,740 --> 03:24:04,240
I don't know what I'm doing.

3353
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:06,440
The fact that he trained against the king player.

3354
03:24:07,720 --> 03:24:10,160
It, like, perfectly countered me because he knew.

3355
03:24:10,540 --> 03:24:14,020
He knew I only had very limited set of moves.

3356
03:24:15,060 --> 03:24:16,520
Wait until you...

3357
03:24:16,540 --> 03:24:18,440
Master, another move.

3358
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:22,080
I can't believe they Vaughn reviewed.

3359
03:24:22,820 --> 03:24:24,060
I didn't Vaughn review.

3360
03:24:24,240 --> 03:24:25,960
I just learned new moves.

3361
03:24:31,360 --> 03:24:34,980
It's time to learn a seventh move.

3362
03:24:35,140 --> 03:24:35,580
You're right.

3363
03:24:35,720 --> 03:24:38,200
I just have to learn a seventh move, chat.

3364
03:24:40,880 --> 03:24:42,320
That's all I need to do.

3365
03:24:44,780 --> 03:24:45,240
Oh, shit.

3366
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:46,620
Oh, shit.

3367
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:51,120
I just need to learn.

3368
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:52,300
Oh, shit.

3369
03:24:52,680 --> 03:24:52,700
No.

3370
03:24:53,160 --> 03:24:54,840
No, I pressed the wrong button.

3371
03:24:55,620 --> 03:24:56,380
That's okay.

3372
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:58,040
It doesn't matter.

3373
03:24:59,220 --> 03:24:59,880
Because I'm...

3374
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:00,460
Oh, okay.

3375
03:25:00,900 --> 03:25:02,640
Because I'm gonna grab her.

3376
03:25:03,880 --> 03:25:04,180
Yay.

3377
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:07,840
Three kings in the leading team.

3378
03:25:08,420 --> 03:25:09,400
It's just messed up.

3379
03:25:09,980 --> 03:25:11,080
It's so messed up.

3380
03:25:11,200 --> 03:25:12,680
Okay, I hate playing against this girl.

3381
03:25:13,160 --> 03:25:14,620
Because this girl is anti-grab.

3382
03:25:15,580 --> 03:25:16,520
It's actually crazy.

3383
03:25:17,580 --> 03:25:18,120
Okay.

3384
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:22,000
Like, I can't do the Tomahawk kick with her.

3385
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:23,020
See?

3386
03:25:24,820 --> 03:25:26,440
But I can abuse this.

3387
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:29,440
Yay!

3388
03:25:32,320 --> 03:25:33,280
Just alley kick.

3389
03:25:33,380 --> 03:25:34,600
I know, that's what I did.

3390
03:25:37,920 --> 03:25:38,640
Oh, shit.

3391
03:25:38,980 --> 03:25:40,200
I didn't expect her to do that.

3392
03:25:41,080 --> 03:25:42,360
I didn't expect you to do that.

3393
03:25:43,160 --> 03:25:45,260
Oh, my God, you low kick this?

3394
03:25:46,100 --> 03:25:47,220
How do I get out?

3395
03:25:48,760 --> 03:25:51,240
She got most of her HP back.

3396
03:25:53,440 --> 03:25:55,980
They always fall for the allocate because it's so stupid.

3397
03:25:59,840 --> 03:26:01,760
It's so fucking stupid.

3398
03:26:01,880 --> 03:26:04,780
I'd fall for it because of how dumb it is.

3399
03:26:05,280 --> 03:26:09,460
Like, it's just so dumb.

3400
03:26:14,220 --> 03:26:16,000
Nobody expects it.

3401
03:26:17,100 --> 03:26:18,460
Works every time.

3402
03:26:18,580 --> 03:26:22,480
This is why I won and done, because they realize I only know
a specific set of moves.

3403
03:26:22,760 --> 03:26:24,540
Get ready for the next battle.

3404
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:26,160
But because it's so low to...

3405
03:26:26,160 --> 03:26:29,000
Yeah, it's the worst low.

3406
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:32,280
It's the worst lows.

3407
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:33,760
Nobody preps.

3408
03:26:34,420 --> 03:26:36,380
Nobody expects it.

3409
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:40,240
That's so true.

3410
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:44,740
Nobody expects...

3411
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:45,840
Get ready for the next battle.

3412
03:26:56,540 --> 03:27:09,600
all right here we go come on oh my gosh she has a gun i'm
gonna kill her she has a gun oh no oh no fucking free

3413
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:24,340
chiropractor yay oh shit no not yeah not yeah anymore guys
not yeah anymore guys not yeah anymore guys it's not stand

3414
03:27:24,340 --> 03:27:38,340
up yo slide does she sidestep this no what's up is it ready
no what's up what's up uh dude this is a pretty stressful

3415
03:27:38,340 --> 03:27:44,900
man so it's not going to be easy to do this stuff you just
learned yesterday the next day so i wouldn't want to worry

3416
03:27:44,900 --> 03:27:52,740
about it too much yeah the gym man it's just like yeah it's
definitely he's an annoying character yeah 100 i think that

3417
03:27:52,740 --> 03:28:00,020
i was my gosh he countered that i was just really trying to
focus on defense which is like oh my god when you're

3418
03:28:00,020 --> 03:28:07,480
defending goodbye really bad if you're wrong when you're
attacking i feel like it's it's way more at this level yeah

3419
03:28:07,480 --> 03:28:13,780
you would you would duck and he would launch goodbye to me i
guess three that axe kick he has yeah and he was also doing

3420
03:28:13,780 --> 03:28:19,840
it like kind of raw like i would go for a grab and he just
rip it and i'm like okay well if like it just works block a

3421
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:22,660
little more because because they don't expect it.

3422
03:28:22,800 --> 03:28:23,100
So I don't know.

3423
03:28:23,320 --> 03:28:28,320
I don't know how much of it was like, this guy's goaded or
this guy's like getting killed.

3424
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:28,940
He's all right.

3425
03:28:29,440 --> 03:28:30,100
I played him a little bit.

3426
03:28:30,160 --> 03:28:33,420
I think he was taking some rounds off of Matt yesterday, was
it?

3427
03:28:34,140 --> 03:28:38,220
I think he said that about the Fang Way, who also destroyed
me.

3428
03:28:38,380 --> 03:28:39,260
So I just got to...

3429
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:41,740
Honestly, I don't think they should even...

3430
03:28:41,740 --> 03:28:45,420
There should even be in this tier of the Fang specifically.

3431
03:28:47,060 --> 03:28:47,860
But, uh...

3432
03:28:47,860 --> 03:28:48,440
This is cool.

3433
03:28:48,580 --> 03:28:51,080
I mean, we can watch them like tonight or tomorrow.

3434
03:28:51,140 --> 03:28:53,760
If you want some matches, if it helps you.

3435
03:28:55,600 --> 03:29:01,900
I think what will help is actually playing, like, play your
Jin or your opponent or something.

3436
03:29:02,480 --> 03:29:04,800
I can definitely play Jin to that level.

3437
03:29:05,100 --> 03:29:05,860
I told you!

3438
03:29:06,540 --> 03:29:07,200
It's fine.

3439
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:08,160
Yep, that's what will help.

3440
03:29:08,300 --> 03:29:08,880
We can do that, too.

3441
03:29:09,280 --> 03:29:10,300
I think that's a good benefit.

3442
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:11,120
If I lose this, it's fine.

3443
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:12,000
I made a statement.

3444
03:29:12,120 --> 03:29:12,940
She hates me.

3445
03:29:13,420 --> 03:29:20,000
I might have, like, if I lose this, I might have lost the
game, but, like, I want the mental warfare.

3446
03:29:20,280 --> 03:29:20,820
The way you said that.

3447
03:29:21,140 --> 03:29:23,100
It sounds like it's actually happening.

3448
03:29:24,120 --> 03:29:27,160
The way you said it, the tone of the voice.

3449
03:29:30,520 --> 03:29:31,940
I want a mental war.

3450
03:29:32,080 --> 03:29:33,160
It's all about exactly.

3451
03:29:33,700 --> 03:29:35,180
She's gonna remember this forever.

3452
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:37,100
Like the fucking...

3453
03:29:39,500 --> 03:29:40,100
Okay.

3454
03:29:41,540 --> 03:29:44,680
You know she's gonna fucking remember this forever.

3455
03:29:44,880 --> 03:29:45,660
You know that.

3456
03:29:52,700 --> 03:29:54,140
The low king.

3457
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:57,360
That's in dying to a low king.

3458
03:29:58,140 --> 03:29:59,080
And I leave.

3459
03:30:00,860 --> 03:30:02,780
Get ready for the next battle.

3460
03:30:05,340 --> 03:30:05,900
Exactly.

3461
03:30:08,400 --> 03:30:13,620
Imagine if that person has been grinding all her life to be
in red rank and here I show up.

3462
03:30:14,080 --> 03:30:16,040
I show up and all I do is this.

3463
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:17,080
Wait, not that.

3464
03:30:17,160 --> 03:30:17,940
Wait, that's sick.

3465
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:18,900
How do I do that?

3466
03:30:26,900 --> 03:30:28,020
That's Maoshi!

3467
03:30:28,200 --> 03:30:28,740
That's me!

3468
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:39,960
Two touched him.

3469
03:30:40,260 --> 03:30:41,580
I fucking two touched him.

3470
03:30:41,780 --> 03:30:42,320
That's so funny.

3471
03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:45,480
Oh shit.

3472
03:30:48,260 --> 03:30:50,520
Oh my god, I tried to block but it didn't work.

3473
03:30:52,920 --> 03:30:53,880
Jesus Christ.

3474
03:30:58,600 --> 03:30:58,780
Does he duck?

3475
03:30:59,180 --> 03:30:59,940
Okay, he doesn't duck.

3476
03:31:00,320 --> 03:31:01,500
Okay, that's all that matter.

3477
03:31:02,740 --> 03:31:04,200
I just need to know if he ducks or not.

3478
03:31:06,520 --> 03:31:08,680
You're cooking this bush in a little bit.

3479
03:31:09,260 --> 03:31:09,520
Oh, no.

3480
03:31:10,080 --> 03:31:11,460
Fucking two-touching the first game.

3481
03:31:11,660 --> 03:31:12,320
Oh, he blocks this.

3482
03:31:12,340 --> 03:31:13,560
There's no way he does it.

3483
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:15,080
He's not that stupid.

3484
03:31:15,320 --> 03:31:17,560
He's in... He's not that stupid.

3485

How did I miss that?

3608
03:40:40,360 --> 03:40:41,300
Doesn't matter though!

3609
03:40:41,560 --> 03:40:41,840
Doesn't matter!

3610
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:42,440
It was a setup.

3611
03:40:42,660 --> 03:40:43,680
It was American reset.

3612
03:40:44,920 --> 03:40:45,520
One more!

3613
03:40:45,640 --> 03:40:46,020

Oh shit.

3617
03:40:50,120 --> 03:40:50,860
She did that thing.

3618
03:40:52,320 --> 03:40:53,140
Hold back.

3619
03:40:53,420 --> 03:40:54,480
Wait, I hold back though.

3620
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:55,600

03:40:57,160 --> 03:40:58,460
But I hold back.

3622
03:40:59,360 --> 03:41:00,180
How did she do that?

3623
03:41:00,440 --> 03:41:02,960
How did she do that?

3624
03:41:04,540 --> 03:41:05,540
How did she do that?

3625
03:41:06,520 --> 03:41:08,380
Oh my goodness.

3626
03:41:08,640 --> 03:41:09,180

3627
03:41:10,980 --> 03:41:11,080
Yes.

3628
03:41:11,620 --> 03:41:12,200
Did I back up?

3629
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:13,640

3630
03:41:13,840 --> 03:41:14,620
I got back!

3631
03:41:16,360 --> 03:41:18,480
Oh, this is a slow-ass move.

3632
03:41:20,080 --> 03:41:21,440
My legs were up.

3633
03:41:21,520 --> 03:41:22,460
It wasn't fair.

3634
03:41:25,560 --> 03:41:28,020

03:42:22,680 --> 03:42:23,060
She ducked it.

3654
03:42:23,060 --> 03:42:24,100
So we had the running three.

Very close.

3728
03:45:02,180 --> 03:45:12,680
very close very close it's just that spinning low that's
spinning one always throws me off yeah yeah and we'll work

3729
03:45:12,680 --> 03:45:23,660
on that it's very easy so for the turny if we have to fight
her we should be okay it's okay we got the intel now oh wait

3730
03:45:27,720 --> 03:45:34,980

while she's spinning if you just mash for that extra kick

3731
03:45:34,980 --> 03:45:37,040
that comes out won't come out and you actually hit her.

3732
03:45:38,160 --> 03:45:39,920
And there's nothing that she can do to it.

3733
03:45:40,100 --> 03:45:42,400
Like, that is like, you get free damage from blocking.

Ducks.

3903
03:58:52,230 --> 03:58:53,170
That was so sick.

3904
03:58:53,350 --> 03:58:54,670
The frame trap with the movement.

3905
03:58:58,310 --> 03:58:58,830
Huge.

3906
03:59:00,510 --> 03:59:01,430
Keep her on that wall.

3907
03:59:03,770 --> 03:59:04,850
Oh my god, that chip.

3908
03:59:05,090 --> 03:59:05,790
Jesus Christ.

3909
03:59:06,030 --> 03:59:06,890
The infinite pressure.

3910
03:59:08,830 --> 03:59:10,450
She did not like that.

3911
03:59:12,570 --> 03:59:13,910
Oh, nice flip.

3912
03:59:14,110 --> 03:59:16,230
They didn't fucking know, man.

3913
03:59:17,010 --> 03:59:19,810
round three fight

3914
03:59:27,700 --> 03:59:30,800
good i'm finishing it

3915
03:59:42,100 --> 03:59:48,000

3918
04:00:17,080 --> 04:00:19,320
Oh my god, she's toxic.

3919
04:00:22,380 --> 04:00:23,140
That's okay.

3920
04:00:29,000 --> 04:00:30,620
That's a counter hit?

3921
04:00:31,260 --> 04:00:31,520
Yeah.

3922
04:00:31,900 --> 04:00:32,600
What the fuck is that?

3923
04:00:33,660 --> 04:00:35,100
Like a Wild Rising 1 or something?

3924
04:00:37,200 --> 04:00:37,440
Yeah.

3925
04:00:37,760 --> 04:00:38,900
It's a frame trap.

3926
04:00:46,810 --> 04:00:48,090
Oh, there it was.

3927
04:00:48,570 --> 04:00:49,690
Oh, there it is.

3928
04:00:52,270 --> 04:00:53,070
Big damage!

3929
04:00:58,620 --> 04:00:59,480
Nice, power crush.

3930
04:00:59,900 --> 04:01:00,600
It's a good power crush.

3931
04:01:00,900 --> 04:01:00,920
It's all right.

3932
04:01:01,060 --> 04:01:01,520
It's all right.

3933
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:09,040
I think after while running 1 plus 2 bear stance, he's not
going to duck looking for that grab.

3934
04:01:09,160 --> 04:01:10,940
I think you could have done another one, honestly.

3935
04:01:12,060 --> 04:01:14,000
Yeah, I think play around the hunting bear stance mixed up.

3936
04:01:14,100 --> 04:01:20,460
And when you back 1 hunting bear stance, even though that's
fake as hell, he will eat the bear stance 1 plus 2 every

3937
04:01:20,460 --> 04:01:20,900
time.

3938
04:01:21,300 --> 04:01:21,540
Okay.

3939
04:01:21,760 --> 04:01:22,700
Round one.

3940
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:24,020
Fight.

3941
04:01:27,430 --> 04:01:29,650
Yeah, that was good whiff punish.

3942
04:01:35,510 --> 04:01:36,270
Nice.

3943
04:01:37,870 --> 04:01:40,090
Got all that health back though.

3944
04:01:40,930 --> 04:01:41,270
Nice.

3945
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:49,580
Why does that work?

3946
04:01:52,360 --> 04:01:53,120
Okay.

3947
04:01:53,760 --> 04:01:54,380
Hot me mashing.

3948
04:01:54,760 --> 04:01:55,400
Yeah.

3949
04:01:55,820 --> 04:01:57,040
You just have to hold back.

3950
04:01:57,620 --> 04:01:58,180
Round two.

3951
04:01:59,040 --> 04:01:59,580
Fight.

3952
04:02:00,620 --> 04:02:00,980
Okay.

3953
04:02:01,420 --> 04:02:01,440
Okay.

3954
04:02:01,720 --> 04:02:02,580
Just laugh.

3955
04:02:10,220 --> 04:02:12,740
Oh, she whiffed.

3956
04:02:15,140 --> 04:02:17,360
Stone had this man at the wall.

3957
04:02:21,240 --> 04:02:22,600
I don't have counter hit, whatever.

3958
04:02:23,960 --> 04:02:25,860
Yeah, it was too late, I guess.

3959
04:02:26,540 --> 04:02:27,020
Oh, nice!

3960
04:02:27,640 --> 04:02:28,180
Look at this!

3961
04:02:28,980 --> 04:02:29,940
Round three.

04:02:30,980 --> 04:02:31,420
Fight!

3963
04:02:32,780 --> 04:02:33,060
Oh.

3964
04:02:37,100 --> 04:02:38,760
Look, he doesn't even know it's launched, that's great.

3965
04:02:40,600 --> 04:02:41,280
What a cheese.

3966
04:02:41,300 --> 04:02:51,360

That's again.

3972
04:03:18,280 --> 04:03:19,300
She's like they're alone.

3973
04:03:19,400 --> 04:03:19,940
I need to be that.

3974
04:03:20,960 --> 04:03:21,280
Unblockable.

3975
04:03:23,240 --> 04:03:25,060
You have Raid, uh, nice.

3976
04:03:25,160 --> 04:03:26,780

3977
04:03:27,540 --> 04:03:27,680
Yeah.

3978
04:03:28,500 --> 04:03:29,940
When he puts pressure on you, rage.

One more guess, right?

3990
04:03:41,640 --> 04:03:42,740

Oh, Lord.

3997
04:04:23,770 --> 04:04:25,630
All these matches have been so close.

3998
04:04:26,410 --> 04:04:28,130
They're so fucking intense.

3999
04:04:28,650 --> 04:04:30,190
All our matches have been.

4000
04:04:31,390 --> 04:04:32,970
It's all in the mainstream, too.

4001
04:04:34,130 --> 04:04:34,890
It's the big deal.

4002
04:04:36,170 --> 04:04:37,950
Dude, I did that unblockable by accident.

4003
04:04:38,530 --> 04:04:39,790
It might have looked like DM.

4004
04:04:42,050 --> 04:04:43,090
That's what's set up.

4005
04:04:43,630 --> 04:04:45,850
That's what, like, oh, man, he's gonna just keycharge me.

4006
04:04:45,910 --> 04:04:47,210

04:04:47,390 --> 04:04:48,090
Yeah.

4008
04:04:48,350 --> 04:04:49,210
There's all the setup.

04:04:49,970 --> 04:04:51,030
This guy's on a four win streak?

4010
04:04:51,910 --> 04:04:52,250
That's okay.

4011
04:04:52,430 --> 04:04:52,690
It's okay.

4012
04:04:52,770 --> 04:04:53,930
You only lost the one person.

4013
04:04:54,710 --> 04:04:57,150
You were on an 11 win streak in slams.

4014
04:04:57,790 --> 04:04:59,070
Technically like 18.

4015
04:04:59,130 --> 04:04:59,770
Across years.

4016
04:05:08,650 --> 04:05:10,150
Hit him on the wall, Jack.

4017
04:05:13,630 --> 04:05:14,150
Shiny!

4018
04:05:15,810 --> 04:05:16,510
Yes, sir.

4019
04:05:18,450 --> 04:05:18,970
Uh-oh.

4020
04:05:19,510 --> 04:05:19,950
Shiny!

4021
04:05:21,770 --> 04:05:22,290
Nice.

4022

4023
04:05:23,950 --> 04:05:26,010
Oh, and low cute.

4024
04:05:26,530 --> 04:05:27,810
Round two.

4025
04:05:30,090 --> 04:05:33,590
What was it, good crab?

4026
04:05:40,880 --> 04:05:41,480
Shining.

4027
04:05:43,600 --> 04:05:44,600
It's not fair.

4028
04:05:44,740 --> 04:05:45,640
He has a gun.

4029
04:05:47,820 --> 04:05:49,180
Jack has a gun.

4030
04:05:49,180 --> 04:05:49,560
Jack is a gun.

4031
04:05:50,340 --> 04:05:50,920
Jack has two.

4032
04:05:51,360 --> 04:05:52,340
His whole body is a gun.

4033
04:05:52,360 --> 04:05:53,620
Jack is his own gun.

4034
04:05:55,820 --> 04:05:58,100
These are all gunshots in his combos.

4035
04:05:58,280 --> 04:06:00,400
Why do I keep fucking getting that shit, man?

4036
04:06:04,080 --> 04:06:04,960
Oh, okay.

4037
04:06:06,640 --> 04:06:07,480
Oh, my God.

4038
04:06:07,480 --> 04:06:09,160
Yeah, send him to retirement home.

4039
04:06:10,640 --> 04:06:12,880
Okay, we have to walk that when we make the read on it.

4040
04:06:13,000 --> 04:06:13,420
We have to walk.

4041
04:06:13,840 --> 04:06:14,460
Oh, man.

4042
04:06:15,020 --> 04:06:16,180
Oh, my expulsion.

4043
04:06:17,020 --> 04:06:17,460
Expulsion.

4044
04:06:18,500 --> 04:06:19,160
It's infamous.

4045
04:06:19,640 --> 04:06:21,000
Oh, my God.

4046
04:06:27,340 --> 04:06:27,780
Nice!

4047
04:06:28,580 --> 04:06:29,260
Serene.

4048
04:06:33,080 --> 04:06:34,780
Dropped combo in the kill.

4049
04:06:35,160 --> 04:06:36,060
Dropped combo in the kill.

4050
04:06:36,640 --> 04:06:37,380
USA, baby.

4051
04:06:37,620 --> 04:06:38,720

4052
04:06:39,540 --> 04:06:40,100
USA.

4053
04:06:40,540 --> 04:06:41,760
He doesn't know.

4054
04:06:44,660 --> 04:06:46,740
Make that grandpa retire.

4055
04:06:47,740 --> 04:06:48,700
He doesn't know.

4056
04:06:49,300 --> 04:06:50,360
He doesn't know.

4057
04:06:51,820 --> 04:06:52,980
He's in the corner.

4058
04:06:53,320 --> 04:06:54,400
There's walls on each side.

4059
04:06:54,600 --> 04:06:55,220
They're closing in.

4060
04:06:56,580 --> 04:06:57,040
Good.

4061
04:06:57,780 --> 04:06:59,400
Oh, Scar awake!

04:07:07,420 --> 04:07:08,460
Holy fucking shit, man!

4067
04:07:14,220 --> 04:07:16,800
His heart stopped midway!

4068
04:07:17,700 --> 04:07:18,920
Oh, Bro's counting!

04:07:19,500 --> 04:07:20,320

That's an infinite tech trap.

4095

04:16:53,900 --> 04:16:55,100
Coach, what are you doing?

4194
04:16:55,240 --> 04:16:55,880
Good shit.

4195
04:16:56,260 --> 04:16:58,380
If I do that, you'll be mad at me!

4196
04:16:58,780 --> 04:16:59,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4197
04:16:59,660 --> 04:17:00,660
Oh, man.

4198
04:17:00,860 --> 04:17:02,620
Yeah, do as I say, not as I did.

4199
04:17:03,200 --> 04:17:03,680
This will drop me.

4200
04:17:04,020 --> 04:17:05,660
Hey, I didn't want to put the pressure on you.

4201
04:17:05,740 --> 04:17:07,260
I think we're second seed because you won that.

4202
04:17:07,400 --> 04:17:07,820
Because we won.

4203
04:17:07,820 --> 04:17:09,440
Wait, did we are we like a seed?

4204
04:17:10,100 --> 04:17:10,440
Because of that?

4205
04:17:10,440 --> 04:17:11,000
I didn't want to say shit.

4206
04:17:11,500 --> 04:17:12,660
Like that was the tiebreaker.

4207
04:17:13,280 --> 04:17:13,640
Really?

4208
04:17:14,420 --> 04:17:15,180
You got it.

4209
04:17:15,420 --> 04:17:16,420
You got some tiebreaker, dude.

4210
04:17:16,520 --> 04:17:17,120
Oh my god.

4211
04:17:17,320 --> 04:17:19,320
That is why we tell you after you won.

4212
04:17:19,460 --> 04:17:20,440
I didn't want to say it.

4213
04:17:20,820 --> 04:17:22,780
But their first seed and we're second.

4214
04:17:23,320 --> 04:17:26,040
Yeah, we literally just like last time we got a seed.

4215
04:17:26,760 --> 04:17:27,120
We got a one.

4216
04:17:27,320 --> 04:17:28,680
I would have lost if you guys told me, man.

4217
04:17:28,820 --> 04:17:29,700
No, I was silent.

4218
04:17:29,920 --> 04:17:30,600
That's why I said it.

4219
04:17:30,600 --> 04:17:31,240
I didn't say it.

04:17:31,420 --> 04:17:32,540

That's okay.

4235

We'll cook them.

4236
04:19:06,780 --> 04:19:07,180
That's okay.

4237
04:19:07,580 --> 04:19:08,760
I'm not worried about second and third.

4238
04:19:08,880 --> 04:19:10,780
We play another set, but like, you know.

4239
04:19:11,020 --> 04:19:11,920
Don't worry about it.

4240
04:19:12,060 --> 04:19:13,460
Don't just imagine we're second.

4241
04:19:14,120 --> 04:19:17,280
Okay, never let the king players do math.

4242
04:19:17,760 --> 04:19:19,360
Ride the high.

4243
04:19:19,580 --> 04:19:19,920
Ride the high.

4244
04:19:20,180 --> 04:19:20,620
That's true.

4245
04:19:20,720 --> 04:19:21,660
Told me it was second.

4246
04:19:21,760 --> 04:19:22,420
My bad, yo.

4247
04:19:22,500 --> 04:19:23,760
I can't believe it.

4248
04:19:24,180 --> 04:19:25,400
Believing the chat?

4249
04:19:25,600 --> 04:19:27,120
The chat got me killed the other day.

4250
04:19:27,560 --> 04:19:28,120
You're right.

4251
04:19:28,320 --> 04:19:29,120
My bad, bro.

4252
04:19:29,280 --> 04:19:30,360
Can't listen to him.

4253
04:19:30,860 --> 04:19:31,320
You're right.

4254
04:19:31,440 --> 04:19:32,200
Second in our heart.

4255
04:19:34,760 --> 04:19:36,760
Unless it comes down to like a weird...

4256
04:19:37,520 --> 04:19:37,860
What?

4257
04:19:38,000 --> 04:19:39,160
Yeah, what are the points looking like?

4258
04:19:39,340 --> 04:19:39,980
I want to look at them.

4259
04:19:39,980 --> 04:19:42,040
Wait, no, yeah, because we're 14-1.

4260
04:19:44,220 --> 04:19:45,600
We were tied with KFM.

4261
04:19:45,720 --> 04:19:46,300
They're crunching the numbers.

4262
04:19:46,580 --> 04:19:46,580
Oh, wait, Tony.

4263
04:19:47,060 --> 04:19:47,780
Yeah, they're crunching the numbers.

4264
04:19:47,960 --> 04:19:48,580
Okay, we'll see.

4265
04:19:48,700 --> 04:19:50,160
Now SageM confirmed for a second?

4266
04:19:50,400 --> 04:19:51,220
I don't like this.

4267
04:19:51,640 --> 04:19:53,240
Wait, now they could be gaslighting.

4268
04:19:53,260 --> 04:19:54,280
Oh, we're tied for a second.

4269
04:19:54,420 --> 04:19:55,820
They're saying Tekken Ball.

4270
04:19:56,820 --> 04:19:58,460
Tekken Ball, Tekken Ball.

4271
04:19:58,500 --> 04:19:59,880
Let me play Tekken Ball.

4272
04:20:00,220 --> 04:20:00,740
It will dominate.

4273
04:20:00,860 --> 04:20:01,640
Let me play Tekken Ball.

4274
04:20:02,760 --> 04:20:09,760
say jam messed up what i read chat stop stop stop hold on
i'm banning you actually okay let's look never believe chat

4275
04:20:09,760 --> 04:20:18,780
except if it's check and ball let me play spreadsheet wait
yeah wait if we had more if we had if us and myk had the

4276
04:20:18,780 --> 04:20:27,920
same amount of points today but we had one more point
wednesday right oh yeah yeah i mean it's it's additive so i

4277
04:20:27,920 --> 04:20:35,140
don't all right they're crunching they're crunching we're
tied for second if it's tech and ball put me on they're

4278
04:20:35,140 --> 04:20:40,180
saying we're tied for second but they didn't include
yesterday so we're second including yesterday's points

4279
04:20:42,900 --> 04:20:52,780
apparently that's what say jam said if me and my care tied
we should get it because i just beat the coach yeah the

4280
04:20:52,780 --> 04:20:59,700
match is just not real real i should get it because it was
fucking stressful wait second by three points oh we're

4281
04:20:59,700 --> 04:21:01,160
second by three points Let's go!

4282
04:21:01,400 --> 04:21:02,320
We're gonna do about three points?

4283
04:21:02,520 --> 04:21:03,200
Let's fucking- Yeah!

4284
04:21:03,500 --> 04:21:08,740
So, doesn't that mean literally if one of us lost yesterday,
then we would have taken balled?

4285
04:21:08,840 --> 04:21:09,120
Yes.

4286
04:21:09,620 --> 04:21:10,380
Oh, my God.

4287
04:21:11,180 --> 04:21:13,040
You guys clutched it out yesterday, or two days ago.

4288
04:21:13,520 --> 04:21:13,680
Dude!

4289
04:21:14,480 --> 04:21:14,920
Oh, my God.

4290
04:21:15,220 --> 04:21:15,280
Yesterday.

4291
04:21:15,420 --> 04:21:18,220
Yesterday was all that matters, because we got first last
one.

4292
04:21:18,220 --> 04:21:19,780
It literally fucking matters.

4293
04:21:20,720 --> 04:21:22,120
NYK's in third now.

4294
04:21:22,800 --> 04:21:23,160
Yay!

4295
04:21:24,040 --> 04:21:25,320
Wait, who do we play against then?

4296
04:21:25,320 --> 04:21:26,520
I was just a rollercoaster.

4297
04:21:26,560 --> 04:21:28,500
I was so ready to take and ball it up, dude.

4298
04:21:28,560 --> 04:21:30,620
I got strategies that I don't even want to talk.

4299
04:21:30,740 --> 04:21:37,200
about i don't want to tell you guys just how much it grinded
that Wednesday actually mattered three point diff that's

4300
04:21:37,200 --> 04:21:43,880
literally a one game difference that literally literally
means everyone who won like good needed every single

4301
04:21:43,880 --> 04:21:52,700
everyone matters good fucking let's go this is so sick
because like everyone on the team like it contributes not

4302
04:21:52,700 --> 04:22:02,800
everybody's coming oh i can hear josh so so when is someone
gonna name drop super a lot bigger streak than that already

4303
04:22:02,800 --> 04:22:11,640
one more in case than super i love the guy but i i feel like
the donkey bird special the alley kick special oh yeah my as

4304
04:22:11,640 --> 04:22:17,860
soon as we learn to block that yoshi the spin of rudy
bullshit it's yeah yeah yeah the moment i block that it's

4305
04:22:17,860 --> 04:22:29,380
over i can alley kick forever do you think they're gonna
learn how to block the alley kick guys we were only two

4306
04:22:29,380 --> 04:22:37,160
points away from first also oh yeah if we won one more set
against it but i mean first or second doesn't yeah it

4307
04:22:37,160 --> 04:22:45,120
doesn't matter it doesn't matter right we're just on the
other side of the bracket from my understanding okay don't

4308
04:22:45,120 --> 04:22:57,060
this doesn't matter if i'm like hey our third seed then we
just forewond them so like yeah we're not in a bad spot good

4309
04:22:57,060 --> 04:23:03,720
i'm gonna ask i'm gonna ask stage one see if anyone wants to
play the second one and also uh we don't have once the

4310
04:23:03,720 --> 04:23:11,440
bracket comes out we don't have to focus on like five
characters because we we get a buy yeah well maybe we might

4311
04:23:11,960 --> 04:23:19,800
with the loser bracket i don't know actually how that works
let's not to prepare yeah for whatever comes up yeah i think

4312
04:23:19,800 --> 04:23:27,320
it's mathematically we'll be less characters to focus on the
moment you teach me how to block i'm unstoppable yeah no

4313
04:23:27,320 --> 04:23:33,480
yeah we'll do all that Like, it'll be a read, but by
definition, we have to lab against, like, at least one less

4314
04:23:33,480 --> 04:23:34,180
team.

4315
04:23:36,880 --> 04:23:37,800
Oh, good shit, guys.

4316
04:23:38,060 --> 04:23:38,640
Well done today.

4317
04:23:39,040 --> 04:23:39,400

Crazy.

4321
04:23:43,460 --> 04:23:45,820
This is really, like, rough on the mental.

4322
04:23:46,020 --> 04:23:46,640
I'm not going to lie.

4323
04:23:46,840 --> 04:23:49,160
Dude, my brain run ironically hurts.

4324
04:23:50,640 --> 04:23:52,040
And the thing, like, I don't...

4325
04:23:52,040 --> 04:23:52,680
I don't know.

4326
04:23:52,920 --> 04:23:55,240
It's just pride, because, like, we're already going.

4327
04:23:55,940 --> 04:23:57,500
You don't need to be here alone, bro.

4328
04:23:58,020 --> 04:23:58,880
I'm here, too.

4329
04:23:59,920 --> 04:24:06,080
you just don't want to let your friends down it's so hard
luckily like i don't want to let you guys down you know i

4330
04:24:06,080 --> 04:24:13,860
mean but like at the same time doesn't matter yeah we're
already going wait hello guys hello

4331
04:24:17,200 --> 04:24:23,720
we can we can create a like a little a little thing a group
thing we'll just all pick them because you're part of the

4332
04:24:23,720 --> 04:24:30,700
team true yeah let's do it for dokey though that's the first
option then then then we we'll do a donation drive for a

4333
04:24:30,700 --> 04:24:42,580
millionaire after yeah first option is we try and get top
two i'm not gonna use my own money one by two points oh i

4334
04:24:42,580 --> 04:24:49,920
would have loved beat josh's team so bad if you beat josh
bro would have been first seed oh my god i lost to his coach

4335
04:24:49,920 --> 04:24:58,140
no it is just time it's okay i choked too guys it's okay we
all each of us choked at least once guys it's okay it's a

4336
04:24:58,140 --> 04:25:02,380
team That is a second though as a team at first.

4337
04:25:02,620 --> 04:25:03,280
Yeah, yeah.

4338
04:25:03,920 --> 04:25:05,560
But Chad is saying give her super's ticket.

4339
04:25:06,060 --> 04:25:07,180
That's what my Chad's saying.

4340
04:25:07,320 --> 04:25:08,740
That's what I'm saying, dude.

4341
04:25:09,180 --> 04:25:10,040
Drop it over.

4342
04:25:10,420 --> 04:25:12,760
Make super pay for his own ticket.

4343
04:25:13,940 --> 04:25:18,540
I gave away my first ticket because I already had an Evo
fucking, like I already had a ticket.

4344
04:25:19,060 --> 04:25:19,660
Oh, what the fuck?

4345
04:25:20,140 --> 04:25:22,600
Yeah, I was like, here, SageM, just give it to someone else.

4346
04:25:22,760 --> 04:25:25,420
SageM saves money if we win.

4347
04:25:25,920 --> 04:25:26,120
Yeah.

4348
04:25:26,560 --> 04:25:29,160
So it's in his interest to rig the bracket.

4349
04:25:29,180 --> 04:25:30,260
Oh, that's true.

4350
04:25:30,580 --> 04:25:32,120
Oh, look at how close we were, dude.

4351
04:25:32,480 --> 04:25:33,180
Oh, my God.

4352
04:25:33,360 --> 04:25:34,320
We're so close.

4353
04:25:35,460 --> 04:25:36,140
That's crazy.

4354
04:25:36,560 --> 04:25:36,720
Yeah.

4355
04:25:37,160 --> 04:25:39,300
If by, you know, knock on wood, not going to happen.

4356
04:25:39,800 --> 04:25:43,660
But if we don't get top two, we'll all pitch in, get Doki to
Evo too.

4357
04:25:44,240 --> 04:25:44,440
Yeah.

4358
04:25:44,820 --> 04:25:48,800
Because I mean, clutch master Doki, literally every match
mattered.

4359
04:25:49,720 --> 04:25:51,100
Doki clutched that shit.

4360
04:25:51,400 --> 04:25:51,520
Yeah.

4361
04:25:52,100 --> 04:25:54,380
Wait, because my set counted?

4362
04:25:55,260 --> 04:25:55,460
Yeah.

4363
04:25:56,340 --> 04:25:58,740
Oh, well, every single set, every win counted.

4364
04:25:59,180 --> 04:26:00,080
Every win.

4365
04:26:00,360 --> 04:26:01,860
That's literally the reason you got it.

4366
04:26:02,180 --> 04:26:05,020
There's no way I don't, like, you deserve to be at EVO.

4367
04:26:05,600 --> 04:26:05,640
Yeah.

4368
04:26:06,020 --> 04:26:07,500
I got points from SK.

4369
04:26:08,140 --> 04:26:10,180
Yeah, you fucking, you literally farmed.

4370
04:26:12,860 --> 04:26:14,160
Well, every step mattered.

4371
04:26:14,360 --> 04:26:16,480
I don't think every match, right?

4372
04:26:17,040 --> 04:26:17,500
How did it work?

4373
04:26:17,540 --> 04:26:20,100
Every match turns into every set and every set matters.

4374
04:26:20,900 --> 04:26:21,020
Okay.

4375
04:26:22,360 --> 04:26:24,360
So you got points off the guys you beat.

4376
04:26:24,620 --> 04:26:25,100
Yeah, yeah.

4377
04:26:25,500 --> 04:26:27,640
Wait, off the points, like, I got sets off.

4378
04:26:28,460 --> 04:26:28,820

04:28:42,650 --> 04:28:45,030
And the shackles will be off.

4395
04:28:45,470 --> 04:28:46,390
For real.

4396
04:28:48,070 --> 04:28:52,070
And we got Red Rank on stream too.

4397
04:28:53,030 --> 04:28:55,270
Guys, we got Red Rank on stream.

4398
04:28:57,090 --> 04:29:00,010
To be fair, I feel like I've been...

4399
04:29:00,850 --> 04:29:13,490
honestly feel like I brute force the red rank because all I
did was just do the moves I know and then leave I just I

4400
04:29:13,490 --> 04:29:22,990
just do like the most tilting fucking moves that nobody has
ever seen before I call it the dokey special with five alley

4401
04:29:22,990 --> 04:29:34,990
kicks and then into a hop kick red red is red these people
in those rinks did not know what they saw.

4402
04:29:38,450 --> 04:29:40,950
I'm pretty sure I tilted a lot of people.

4403
04:29:41,370 --> 04:29:47,550
I was so surprised that the match against SK was so close
because she had so many hours ahead of me.

4404
04:29:47,910 --> 04:29:53,050
I like hard-grinded the last this week, but like SK still
had so many hours ahead of me.

4405
04:29:53,170 --> 04:29:58,390
Like everybody had so many hours ahead of me throughout this
tournament.

4406
04:29:58,490 --> 04:30:00,530
So I felt like I definitely grew a lot.

4407
04:30:00,850 --> 04:30:14,710
in such a short amount of time and uh and i did i don't like
i don't death in i just go in yolo the mind game i feel like

4408
04:30:14,710 --> 04:30:22,130
i caught up really fast in the short amount of hours i think
i have like 30 hours in total at the moment in techin for

4409
04:30:22,130 --> 04:30:29,270
now but i'm pretty like i um and it's my first fighting game
so i'm really happy with my progress so far like i never

4410
04:30:29,270 --> 04:30:39,550
expected to get red So I'm super happy with my progress And
I honestly think the moment I learn how to block it's

4411
04:30:39,550 --> 04:30:49,110
fucking over for everybody That's my only problem The moment
I learn to block and I become more patient It's over I

4412
04:30:49,110 --> 04:30:59,110
figured it out Because I win the mental game Like I win the
mind games off of people Because when they fight against me

4413
04:30:59,110 --> 04:31:05,770
it's so i can feel the rage i can feel people being really
angry when they're fighting against me because my moods are

4414
04:31:05,770 --> 04:31:22,690
so fucking bullshit like my moods are so are so bullshit
that i can tell people are very mad you see them get more

4415
04:31:22,690 --> 04:31:30,290
aggressive oh hell yeah yeah i can feel that they're
deafening and like going hard focused i can feel it i just

4416
04:31:30,290 --> 04:31:38,030
need to like i just need to learn how to block and it's over
