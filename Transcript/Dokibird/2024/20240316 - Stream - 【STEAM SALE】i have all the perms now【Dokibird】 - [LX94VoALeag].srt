00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,720
Welcome to the Steam Cell!

2
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah!

3
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,680
Hello everyone.

4
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,300
Guys, I just realized this week, I've been fucking up like...

5
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:22,680
Like on the schedule, I get it right, but then like every time I make my waiting room tweet, I realize I always keep fucking up daylight savings for like JST and GMT.

6
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,900
Because I don't pay attention... the reason why I keep fucking it up is because I'm lazy.

7
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,960
And what I do is that whenever I make a waiting room tweet, I just grab an old tweet.

8
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,780
An old waiting room tweet.

9
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,780
Because I'll be like, alright, I'm streaming at 5pm.

10
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,180
Let me grab a tweet I made for 5pm streams.

11
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,560
And then I just go on Twitter, copy paste as a template.

12
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,020
And then I go, brr, just change the title.

13
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,660
And I go, brr, just change the title.

14
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,000
And the link and then like I don't have to retype the times.

15
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,860
And I was like, wait a minute, why is... this doesn't look...

16
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,040
And then like later I was like, wait a minute, wait.

17
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Daylight savings is a thing.

18
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:16,180
So I've been like, I realized I've been like fucking up the daylight savings time for my waiting room tweet every time.

19
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,140
For the past week now, I just realized that.

20
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,720
I was like, no, my laziness.

21
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,280
Because why would I retype the time when I already have the time on the waiting room?

22
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,060
I already have like a template for it.

23
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,740
I fucking hate daylight savings time.

24
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,980
It's only invented by like farmers.

25
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,260
Like we don't need daylight savings because we have to revert it anyway.

26
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
That's the fucked up part.

27
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,100
Like later on in the year.

28
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,120
We're just reverting our like we're just reverting our change anyway.

29
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,520
So what's the point?

30
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,480
Let's just live a couple of months.

31
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Like let's just live a couple of months.

32
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,600
We're like, you know, the sun shows up later than usual.

33
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,840
Who cares?

34
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,460
Global warming is already doing everything anyway.

35
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,740
If you think about it, we already are getting fucked by global warming.

36
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,760
So it doesn't matter.

37
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,620
What about daylight savings?

38
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,620
Anyway, thank you for the 100 gifted chips.

39
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,500
Thank you.

40
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,340
Thank you.

41
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,120
I really appreciate it.

42
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,520
Thank you so much.

43
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Also bacon.

44
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,200
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

45
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,980
Thank you.

46
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,700
Thank you.

47
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
Thank you.

48
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,280
Thank you.

49
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,160
The suns are the weather's already fucked up.

50
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,060
Do we really need daylight savings?

51
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,260
Thank you.

52
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,560
Thank you.

53
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,640
Thank you.

54
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,720
Thank you.

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,480
It's true.

56
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,180
You only booed because I'm right.

57
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,340
The weather's already fucked.

58
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,760
We might as well live without daylight savings.

59
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,920
There's like it's so fucked up right now.

60
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
In some places.

61
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,000
It's hot when it shouldn't be in other places.

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,760
It's snowing when it's fucking spring like what's going on?

63
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,500
But get.

64
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,160
We have to worry about daylight savings.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,240
But yet the farmers are in control of the time.

66
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Sorry.

67
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,100
So I had to get that out of the way.

68
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,580
We have to get out of the way.

69
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,640
Anyway, what's it?

70
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,140
What on?

71
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,600
Thank you.

72
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,000
This is rich.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,740
I think you thank you.

74
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,960
The only mistake farmers make was grow food for other people.

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,420
Thank you for the super chat.

76
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:52,900
Thank you.

77
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,640
Thank you.

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,840
So they give us super chat.

79
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,120
Thank you.

80
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,420
Thank you.

81
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Farmers don't even use daylight savings.

82
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,860
It was invented by a politician who thought kids should get more sunlight.

83
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,040
Oh my God.

84
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,880
That's so outdated.

85
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,300
Like guys, we need to like guys.

86
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:19,080
I will run for office and get rid of daylight savings time vote for doki bird for president in America.

87
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

88
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,720
As a Canadian, I will run for office in America to get rid of daylight savings.

89
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh, wait, I should go for Senator first.

90
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,860
I forgot.

91
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,340
Sorry.

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,260
I vote for a doki to be like mayor and then later on vote for me to be Senator and then don't worry.

93
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,940
I will become the house speaker and then like I'll make sure I will abolish daylight savings.

94
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

95
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,620
Because that's the only thing that matters.

96
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,760
Clearly, instead of banning TikTok, I will ban daylight savings.

97
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,600
Anyway, JL, thank you for the super chat.

98
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:02,920
Thank you.

99
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,420
Thank you.

100
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,840
Actually, actually, daylight savings was invented to save fuel for the war effort during World War II.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,620
Thank you for the super chat.

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,180
Thank you.

103
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Thank you.

104
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

105
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,080
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

106
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,960
Okay.

107
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,800
Sorry.

108
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,560
I just need to go through this.

109
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,920
I just need to go through with that because like, oh my God, I hate daylight savings so fucking much.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,860
I really hate it.

111
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,580
Anyway.

112
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,860
So today we are going to be doing Steam Cell.

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,100
So how this works knows more politics than the average American.

114
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,360
Ha ha ha ha ha.

115
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:50,560
I think that's like, I think like people outside of America knows more politics knows more about American politics than the average American.

116
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,900
When you live in America, you make sure you know nothing about American politics because it's it's you just don't want to know.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,820
Ha ha ha ha ha.

118
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:07,140
But then the rest of the world, we have to know because like everything that happens in America affects the rest of us.

119
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,780
So we're sort of forced to know what the fuck is going on with you guys in America.

120
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:19,140
Because if something fucked up happens in America, like the rest of us is like we get like partially fucked.

121
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,460
Ha ha ha ha ha.

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,300
Ha ha ha ha ha.

123
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:22,800
Ha ha ha ha ha.

124
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,120
So that's why everyone outside of America is forced to know what the fuck is going on.

125
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,980
Because we're too reliant on what the fuck you guys do.

126
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,740
Ha ha ha ha.

127
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
Ha ha ha ha.

128
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,420
Except for the states.

129
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,500
You guys have, you guys know all your states.

130
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,080
We don't care.

131
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,600
I barely care about my own provinces.

132
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,660
Do not worry.

133
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,980
I barely, okay maybe that's just a me thing.

134
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,540
I barely care about my own provinces.

135
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,840
I barely care about what like the individual things within the countries.

136
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,900
So like I don't know where, what the fuck my provinces are.

137
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,100
Let alone what 50 states, 50 states.

138
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,740
I almost was like how many states are in America.

139
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,420
Ha ha ha ha.

140
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,700
Do you want like an X amount of states in your country?

141
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Ha ha ha ha ha.

142
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
Ha ha ha ha.

143
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,240
Okay.

144
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,500
I also don't even like.

145
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,520
I don't even know my own nationalities.

146
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,100
I don't even know my own national anthem.

147
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,260
I'll just say.

148
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,180
I know like the partially.

149
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,180
I remember partially of my own national anthem.

150
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,860
And it's like.

151
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,400
Oh Canada.

152
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,180
Our home and native land.

153
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,440
Ba ba da da.

154
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,940
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

155
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,740
Ba da da da da.

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,760
Ba da ba.

157
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,500
Ha ha ha.

158
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,780
That's really it.

159
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,840
And then like.

160
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,020
Jazz national anthem.

161
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,860
Chilla.

162
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,820
Chilla.

163
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,700
Chilla.

164
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,880
Ba ba da da.

165
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,760
Ba ba ba ba ba ba.

166
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,240
Because like.

167
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
When I used to live in Asia.

168
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,500
Like.

169
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,520
That shit would play almost like every fucking day.

170
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,320
But like.

171
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,740
It's only that part.

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,580
Like.

173
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,800
Ha ha ha ha.

174
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,120
Ha ha ha ha.

175
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,880
Like.

176
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,640
It was like.

177
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,920
Ba ba da da ba ba ba ba da da da ba.

178
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,660
I just remember that.

179
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,140
Like.

180
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
That's all I can.

181
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,600
That's all I can remember.

182
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,140
Ha ha ha ha ha.

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,520

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,880
Um.

185
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,360
Um.

186
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,600
I don't know.

187
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,160
I don't know.

188
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,620
Um.

189
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,520
And then.

190
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:19,900
Um.

191
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,860
Yeah.

192
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,720
That's the one part I could remember.

193
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,400
And then.

194
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,880
But like.

195
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,720

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,860
It's like.

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,080
What?

199
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,340
You have to do like the pledge of allegiance every day.

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,840
And also the national anthem.

201
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,860
Um.

202
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,920

Is that.

206
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,820
Is that true?

207
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,480
I don't know.

208
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,880

Like.

214
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,000
The America.

215
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,900
About America comes from TV.

216
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,460
So.

217
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,300
I don't like to.

218
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,180
Ha ha ha.

219
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,000

220
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,860
Like.

221
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,220
I just need you guys to know.

222
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
A lot of the knowledge I know about what's going on in America.

223
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,820
Is from your TV shows.

224
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,840
So like.

225
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,260
I just know like.

226
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,080
I remember just watching TV.

227
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,560
And they're like.

228
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,860
Time to stand up to do the pledge of allegiance.

229
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,260
And then.

230
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,060
I don't even know.

231
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,440
Like.

232
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,940
I haven't pledged in years.

233
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,200
But yeah.

234
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,920
But that's for school.

235
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,180
That's what I'm saying.

236
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,740
For school.

237
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,720
Oh.

238
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,680
You guys stop now.

239
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,920
The TV lies.

240
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,460
I'm pretty sure like.

241
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,680
A lot of people.

242
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,460
Like.

243
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,500
Outside of America.

244
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
Learn about what's going on in America.

245
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,640
Via your TV shows.

246
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,100
Like.

247
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,780
The TV version is better than the actual version.

248
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
That's just life in general.

249
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:32,980
Oh.

250
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,220
Uh.

251
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,760
Thank you for the super chat.

252
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,040
Thank you.

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,620
Wow.

I knew it.

257
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,980
There was a reason I enjoyed your content.

258
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,380
Besides.

259
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,100
All along.

260
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,700
We used to do the pledge in schools.

261
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,480
But they stopped that.

262
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,680
A long time ago.

263
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,040
So.

264
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,760
They gave us the super chat.

265
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,140
Thank you.

266
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,740
Thank you.

267
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,280
Uh.

268
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,780
JL.

269
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,100
Yeah.

270
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,940
We have to do the pledge.

271
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,920
Some schools even enforce it.

272
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,240
And thing.

273
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,280
About under God.

274
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,020
That didn't get added to the 1960s.

275
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,000
They give us the super chat.

276
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,320
Thank you.

277
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,540
Thank you.

278
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,480
That is why you should vote for Doki.

279
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,440
For Senator.

280
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,840
Because I will make sure I will add the ban of daylight savings time.

281
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,500
But don't.

282
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,940
But I.

283
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,440
I just need you guys to know.

284
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,440
By the way.

285
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,600
You guys didn't register this.

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,660
This is a joke.

287
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,200
Please don't write my name in any ballots in America.

288
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,980
Please.

289
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,280
I do not want to get into national TV.

290
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,320
For like.

291
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,260
Compromising the vote system in America.

292
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,640
Because you guys have bigger things to worry about.

293
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,360
Okay.

294
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,900
For.

295
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,320
For legal reasons.

296
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,060
Do not write my name in the ballot.

297
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,620
Okay.

298
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,940
Do not.

299
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
Please do not write my name.

300
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,000
In any voting.

301
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,640
In any voting.

302
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,120
In any.

303
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,980
In any presidential or senator vote.

304
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,020
In your.

305
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,480
In.

306
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,100
In your city.

307
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,540
I need you guys to know this.

308
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,480
Because.

309
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,860
If you guys don't know.

310
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,980
If a person gets.

311
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,600
You know.

312
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,840
This is going to be a Streisand effect.

313
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,500
Because where I say don't do it.

314
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,140
And then people are like.

315
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,560
You know what.

316
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,760
I'm going to do it anyway.

317
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,860
Because it's going to be funny.

318
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,680
But I'm.

319
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
But if you guys didn't.

320
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,180
Me telling you guys this right now.

321
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,880
If you guys didn't know.

322
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,020
If a person has a lot of like.

323
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,620
If a person has a lot of like.

324
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
If a person gets a lot of the written in ballots.

325
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,880
Their name actually gets published.

326
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,820
Out to be like.

327
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,280
A lot of the written in votes.

328
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,060
Were for this person.

329
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,160
So if a lot.

330
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,340
If enough people actually write their name.

331
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,380
On the ballot.

332
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,080
It actually gets published out.

333
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,900
But like.

334
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,800
Please don't do that.

335
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,260
Please don't jeopardize.

336
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,300
Please don't jeopardize a boat in your city.

337
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,980
Josie.

338
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,840
Thank you for the super chat.

339
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,180
Thank you.

340
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,620
Thank you.

341
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,840
Dokey for secretary of defense.

342
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,180
Thank you for the super chat.

343
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,620
Thank you.

344
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,300
Thank you.

345
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,900
But it would be so funny.

346
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,600
Dokey.

347
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,860
You guys.

348
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,660
Guys.

349
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,080
For all the.

350
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,700
For all.

351
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,820
For all the dragos.

352
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,780
Living in America right now.

353
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,640
You guys have bigger things to worry about right now.

354
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,000
You guys.

355
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,180
I know there's some of you there on the fence.

356
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
But I am not the one that's going to be convincing you on which way to vote for.

357
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,680
So don't vote for me.

358
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,640
And you're written in ballot.

359
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,960
Anyway.

360
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,600
Anyway.

361
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,160
Off to like the steam.

362
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,760
The Steam is bringing me sell.

363
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,980
But it's the only way I will pay attention to this.

364
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,040
As a Canadian...

365
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,760
Dragoons.

366
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,640
As a Canadian...

367
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,740
I do not think that is the right way to go.

368
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,840
Anyway.

369
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,780
Where was I?

370
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,160
But yes, for those who have never done a Steam Spring Cell...

371
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,700
Who has never been to a Steam...

372
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,920
Not just a Spring Cell.

373
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,140
For the Steam Cell streams before.

374
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,380
How this works is that...

375
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,960
How this works is that...

376
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,980
Also, if you guys really do want to...

377
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,000
I would be a terrible...

378
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
By the way, I'm getting off track.

379
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,020
But I would be a very terrible politician.

380
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,980
Because I would definitely take bribes.

381
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,600
So...

382
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,360
So like...

383
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,360
Like...

384
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,840
If you're lobbying for anything and you have enough money...

385
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,740
I would 100% would take that bribe.

386
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,640
So please.

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,520
I would be a terrible politician.

388
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,000
You're like...

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
But they already do take bribes.

390
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,460
Anyway.

391
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,500
Here up.

392
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Thank you for the super chat.

393
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:56,960
Thank you.

394
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,420
Thank you.

395
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,980
Um...

396
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,600
Uh...

397
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Anyway.

398
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,540
As I was saying...

399
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,460
Uh...

400
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
As I was saying...

401
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,060
Uh...

402
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,680
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

403
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,320
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

404
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,920
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

405
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,340
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

406
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,340
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

407
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,160
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

408
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,560
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

409
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,320
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

410
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,680
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

411
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,640
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

412
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,420
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

413
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,920
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

414
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,560
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

415
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,460
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

416
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,140
For those who have never been to a Steam Spring Cell...

417
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,480
For all of you guys.

418
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:45,540
And then you guys vote yay or nay when it comes to buying the game.

419
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,200
So you have the power if a dragoon suggests a good game.

420
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,300
But I need to also let you guys know.

421
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,020
Suggest games that you think will interest me.

422
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,560
It might be your favorite fucking game of all time.

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,340
But is it a Doki game?

424
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,940
You have to remember.

425
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,060
Is it a Doki game?

426
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,180
Like, I don't know.

427
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,660
It could be the best game.

428
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,000
In your opinion, the best game in the fucking world.

429
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,440
But is it the best game in the fucking world for me?

430
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,720
Like, just remember that.

431
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,580
Um, Louis, thank you for the super chat.

432
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,400
Thank you, thank you.

433
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,820
Hello Doki, struggling game developer here.

434
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,700
Please check out Eden Growl.

435
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,580
Thank you for the super chat.

436
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,420
Thank you, thank you.

437
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,580
Um, alright.

438
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,860
Maybe I'll do Eden Growl as the...

439
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,380
Okay.

440
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
Oh my gosh, I see some fucking curse scratches.

441
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,900
Alright.

442
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,080
Also, the other gamble is...

443
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,180
Okay, so like, now that I'm a streamer, cause in the past, you know, like, I was just like you guys.

444
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,820
The Steam sale would go on, and then all of us would like, pick up games and stuff.

445
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,760
But we would only play like, one to two games of all the games we buy on the Steam sale.

446
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,100
The advantage of being a streamer now is that now...

447
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:28,200
Um, especially cause it's a single player, I tend to like, stray away from single player games before I became a streamer.

448
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,380
Because, uh, you know, like...

449
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,260
I just played multiplayer all the time.

450
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:41,000
Uh, cause it's like, you buy like, 200 games, and then you go and play fucking, I don't know, Minecraft or some shit.

451
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,460
That was me.

452
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,200
That was me.

453
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,120
That was like, before Steam sale was a thing too.

454
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,040
The humble bundles.

455
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,080
I would buy like, so... I would like, subscribe to the humble bundles.

456
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,640
Uh, because I was like, whoa, look at all the fucking bargains from the humble bundle.

457
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,200
And then I would touch like, one of the games from the humble bundle.

458
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,560
Only one of the humble bundle games actually interests me.

459
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,860
And then I just like, that was the only game.

460
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,420
I would have like, 300, like, 100 games from the humble bundles.

461
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,900
And I would only touch like, three of them overall.

462
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,200
But now that I'm a streamer, I can like, share the games with you guys.

463
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,680
But like, as in like, I'll stream for you guys.

464
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,700
Not doing anything illegally.

465
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,060
Not doing any flamboyance.

466
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,760
Just doing everything on my plan here.

467
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,920
I meant, share with you guys.

468
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,760
And you guys live vicariously through me.

469
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,780
By watching me play those games.

470
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,560
So yeah, anyway.

471
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,040
So yeah, that is how it's gonna go.

472
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,640
Let me see what is the first suggestion.

473
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
The first...

474
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,960
Oh, I am not playing Kini Topek.

475
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,340
I heard about the Kini Topek does doxxing shit.

476
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,240
And also, I was like...

477
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,840
Gumi played it.

478
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,840
And I was there on her stream.

479
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,520
I was in a voice call with her while she played it on stream.

480
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,980
Oh yeah, thank you, the super chat.

481
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,280
Thank you.

482
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,800
Thank you.

483
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,440
Uh...

484
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,900
Her radiance.

485
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,760
Doki, please ban Steam sales.

486
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,060
Thank you for accepting my prize.

487
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,780
Thank you, the super chat.

488
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,280
Thank you.

489
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,880
Thank you.

490
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,820
Oh yeah, I'm trying to see which one to go first.

491
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,900
Which one that like...

492
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,600
Um...

493
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,060
Which one I should like, give you guys a vote on first.

494
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,960
There's so many choices to vote on.

495
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
The Samurai game.

496
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
But that game is so mediocre.

497
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,920
Also, I have three vetoes.

498
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,740
No, no, I have four vetoes.

499
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,820
Just so you guys know.

500
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,440
I have four choice chances to veto a game.

501
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,140
So if you guys suggest a game that I know for sure that I do not wanna play, I will veto it.

502
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,220
But I'll have four.

503
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,760
I can only do it four times.

504
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,720
Alright.

505
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,340
Okay.

506
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,660
Amid evil.

507
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,680
Fast paced.

508
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,340
Nervous.

509
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,060
Thank you, the super chat.

510
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,400
Thank you.

511
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,900
Thank you.

512
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,960
I don't think you had proof.

513
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,980
I think you would love it, Doki.

514
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
Cheers from a long time fan.

515
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,520
Alright, let's look up amid evil.

516
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,480
Isn't that the scary one?

517
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,940
Wait, I feel like I've seen this before.

518
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,000
Whoa!

519
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,860
Have we watched this before?

520
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,820
Oh, it's like...

521
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,640
It's like retro.

522
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,400
Retro boomer shooter.

523
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,180
It has a volume.

524
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,920
Bum bum bum bum.

525
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,330
Oh my god, you can punch the enemies.

526
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,170
That's not my favorite part because I like to shoot from the...

527
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,410
I realize...

528
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,050
I realize why melee when can shoot.

529
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,750
I can never do...

530
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,750
Oh my god, I recently was playing Returnal recently.

531
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,370
Um...

532
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,490
And like...

533
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,090
And like...

534
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,650
Returnal is so fucking frustrating.

535
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,910
It's so frustrating.

536
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,470
Holy shit.

537
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,350
I might play Returnal on stream.

538
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,990
Returnal is basically a rogue-like shooter.

539
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,490
And it's like Touhou rogue-like shooter.

540
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,350
It's so fucking frustrating.

541
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,650
It's so hard.

542
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,390
Amid evil.

543
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,710
The black labyrinth.

544
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,910
Wait, but...

545
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,690
Does he have gun?

546
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,510
Why is it all melee?

547
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,270
Where's his gun?

548
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,230
Amid evil.

549
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,290
Out now.

550
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,890
Alright, it's time.

551
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,890
It's time.

552
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,450
Where's his gun?

553
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,210
Alright, amid evil.

554
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,590
Yay.

555
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,170
Yay.

556
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,610
Or nay.

557
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,410
It's your choice, guys.

558
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,470
You guys get the vote.

559
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,810
Alright, let's see what...

560
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,890
Oh, it's from the same people as Dusk and Ultra Kill.

561
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,430
I love Ultra Kill.

562
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,510
I don't want...

563
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,190
I'm gonna wait until Ultra Kill is finished finished before...

564
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,710
It's out of like beta before we do like Ultra Kill again.

565
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:08,930
Alright.

566
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,170
Let's see.

567
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,850
Another low-key game which puts AAA serials and publishers to shame.

568
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,750
Oh, man.

569
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,390
That Battlefront remastered did not...

570
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,010
Do so well, man.

571
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,210
Guys, did you guys see that fucking Battle...

572
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,270
The Battlefront game that was like 75 gigabytes?

573
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,290
That is like...

574
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,610
I think that's like bigger than Dead Space Remaster.

575
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,350
That's actually...

576
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,490
How does that get...

577
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,170
Okay.

578
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,190
So like...

579
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,170
I saw that they were tweeting out early access codes too for this game.

580
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,350
So it's like...

581
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,490
How did no one complain about it during early access?

582
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,130
Like...

583
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,390
How did no...

584
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,490
How did no one complain about being like...

585
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:54,890
Um...

586
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,390
So I was trying to download this game in early access and it was 75 gigabytes.

587
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,670
Like how did that not...

588
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,050
Like how did that not tell anybody that something was wrong?

589
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,050
Wait, they did?

590
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,570
They did and they still did nothing about it?

591
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,070
I still can't pronounce the devs name.

592
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,530
And I just noticed a medieval pun in the name.

593
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,210
Wait, what?

594
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,130
A medieval?

595
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,590
What's the...

596
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,750
What's the pun?

597
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,170
Okay.

598
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,790
Let's see.

599
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,830
Definitely not a medieval.

600
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,770
Why is this guy complaining?

601
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,370
You know...

602
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,610
I wanna see like...

603
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:35,810
Okay.

604
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,850
I try very hard to like this game but I just couldn't...

605
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,310
Okay.

606
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,590
Let's find the one negative comment so I can justify me not buying this game.

607
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,270
You know like those people...

608
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:50,510
You know like those people...

609
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,510
Like when they try to look at reviews and they always find like the one...

610
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,210
The one negative comment and be like...

611
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,570
Look, see?

612
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,130
There's a negative comment.

613
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,270
That means I shouldn't buy it.

614
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,250
And then it's like the one comment...

615
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,770
The one negative comment out of like hundreds of comments.

616
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,710
Like...

617
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,330
There's always one.

618
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,350
See?

619
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,710
The game is not perfect.

620
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,990
Why did you guys suggest this game to me?

621
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,050
Look, see?

622
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,490
If it was perfect, there would be zero comments.

623
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,970
There would be zero negative comments.

624
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,270
I really love this game.

625
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,350
Not recommended.

626
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:27,650
Alright.

627
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,110
I love retro shooters like Quake and Doom and I thought I could enjoy this one.

628
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,050
However, I found this game very frustrating for a number of reasons.

629
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,290
The level design is very irritating.

630
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,370
Hidden paths and the platform...

631
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,310
This guy...

632
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,670
What?

633
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,110
It just seems like this guy doesn't like retro shooters.

634
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,630
That's basically retro shooters.

635
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,510
Like...

636
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,990
Like...

637
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,250
What do you mean?

638
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,730
Hidden paths and the...

639
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,650
Hidden paths?

640
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,610
That's based off of entirely of retro shooters.

641
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,470
And these are like flies.

642
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,810
As long as you stay away from them and use a ranged weapon.

643
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,450
So the game is very easy.

644
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,390
Oh, I like that.

645
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,610
Oh, it's not hard enough.

646
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,070
Okay.

647
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,250
The movement absolutely sucks.

648
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,110
The velocity feels so unreal.

649
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,670
I'd say this game might be worth it to try on sale but I wouldn't pay...

650
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,550
Oh my god!

651
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,470
Lucky for me, it's a Steam sale.

652
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,830
Alright.

653
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,530
It looks like we got a yay on it.

654
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,210
I don't know how much time to give you guys to vote.

655
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:25,810
I'll just...

656
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,910
You know what?

657
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,770
It's to my discretion.

658
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,110
So sometimes...

659
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,970
Sometimes you guys get a lot of chance to vote.

660
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,190
Sometimes you guys don't.

661
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,790
It's up to my discretion.

662
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,870
Welcome to the Dokiverse.

663
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,890
So, alright.

664
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,330
Yay!

665
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,610
Our first game!

666
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,070
A medieval...

667
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,630
Medieval!

668
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,610
Okay, I just noticed the...

669
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,070
I just noticed a pun.

670
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,030
I just noticed a pun.

671
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,510
Okay.

672
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,190
Medieval.

673
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,390
Brutal Legend!

674
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,610
Okay.

675
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,050
That's the...

676
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,890
That's the game with Jack Black, right?

677
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,550
Red Force.

678
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,330
Thank you for the super chat.

679
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,690
Thank you.

680
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,410
I've bought Brutal Legends for at least six of my friends so far.

681
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,370
Because I love the game so much.

682
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,850
It may interest you.

683
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,510
You might not.

684
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,130
But it's a major cult classic.

685
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,390
Is this the one with Jack Black?

686
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,490
I remember buying Brutal Legends when it first came out on console.

687
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,150
It was like...

688
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,770
Oh my gosh.

689
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,670
I remember buying...

690
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,670
And then...

691
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,030
Did I ever finish?

692
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,110
I don't think I've ever finished it.

693
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,150
But like I played up until like a while.

694
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,010
God, it was so long ago.

695
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,510
This game is so old.

696
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,690
It's 20...

697
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,330
This game was 11 years old.

698
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,790
Jesus.

699
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,590
Oh my God.

700
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,750
You can tell it's old.

701
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,910
Oh my God.

702
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,470
I still can't believe it.

703
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,850
I still can't believe Jack Black is gonna be in Minecraft as Steve.

704
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,610
I still can't believe he got casted in Minecraft.

705
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,210
Of all things.

706
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,420
It would be a dream to collab with Jack Black.

707
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
What if I like...

708
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,760
Oh my God.

709
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,260
What if...

710
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,520
Okay.

711
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm gonna message Mr. Man and ask him if he could pitch to Jack Black.

712
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,020
Jack Black's PR team.

713
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
If he ever wants to collab with a Vtuber.

714
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,960
I will pay for his Vtuber model.

715
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,780
DMCA music?

716
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,600
It's alright.

717
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,460
I mean, fucking Freebirds already DMCA'd.

718
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,420
Oh, they're gonna DMCA this stream.

719
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,420
I just realized.

720
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,460
Fuck.

721
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,380
Okay.

722
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,960
Whatever.

723
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,100
I don't need ad revenue on this stream.

724
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,860
It's okay.

725
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,120
I don't...

726
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,500
I don't need ad revenue on this stream, guys.

727
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,620
I don't need it.

728
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,300
By the way, I still haven't been paid.

729
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,080
Okay.

730
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,780
I still haven't been paid by YouTube.

731
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,120
So, like, I technically don't have, like, an income yet.

732
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,600
YouTube side.

733
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,660
Thank God I did have my merch store.

734
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,640
Like, to compensate.

735
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,060
Because I didn't know this.

736
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,960
But, like, when you're starting out a channel, you have to make a ad revenue.

737
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,840
A ad revenue.

738
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,320
Account.

739
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,680
And, like, you need, like, a pin number that they send over via mail.

740
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,280
And, like, so it says in two to three weeks it would arrive.

741
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,720
And so, like, yeah, ad send.

742
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,400
So, for those...

743
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,620
This is, like, a little pro tip for you guys.

744
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,540
Because, like, obviously this isn't, like...

745
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,520
Like, obviously it's not, like, common knowledge.

746
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,700
Because for those who've never been, like, monetized on YouTube before.

747
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,520
So, like, basically what they do is that...

748
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,520
To activate your AdSense account, you need, like, a pin number that they send you.

749
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,200
That's exclusively for you.

750
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,800
But the thing about that is that they send it physically to your house.

751
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,180
Or, like, to wherever you live.

752
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,000
So, like, it says, like, there's no tracking, too.

753
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,940
So, it says, like, it's, like, two to three weeks it's supposed to get there.

754
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,020
And, like, the thing is...

755
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,140
So, I was, like, it's been a month.

756
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,500
And I still haven't received it.

757
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,620
So, I requested another...

758
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,560
I requested them to send it again.

759
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,700
Because I was, like, okay.

760
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,740
It's been a month now.

761
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,780
This is...

762
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,000
Because I asked, like, my friends about it.

763
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,200
And they're, like, yeah, like, yeah, it should take, like...

764
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,180
It took me, like, three weeks to get it.

765
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,300
So, I was, like, okay.

766
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,060
Three weeks is the maximum that I'll wait for it.

767
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,640
But then three weeks passed.

768
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,200
And I was, like, maybe four weeks.

769
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,340
I'll wait four weeks.

770
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,660
Maybe something's going on.

771
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,180
And then four weeks, I was, like, okay.

772
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,400
I should request again.

773
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,300
So, so, like...

774
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,500
So, technically, I haven't received any money yet.

775
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,740
Because, like, they also pay you at the end of the month.

776
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,060
So, like, I was, like, okay.

777
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,260
Maybe by the time I get my pin number...

778
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,120
Um...

779
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,500
I will still get paid for the first month.

780
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,520
But, like...

781
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,620
So, then I was, like, okay.

782
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm just gonna request again.

783
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,240
Scott, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

784
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,480
Thank you, thank you.

785
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,060
Yeah.

786
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,340
So, I'm just, like, waiting again.

787
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,220
I'm gonna wait again to see.

788
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,880
But...

789
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,500
Oh, yeah.

790
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,340
I forgot the vote.

791
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,340
I thought I had the vote on, guys.

792
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,220
Oh, shit.

793
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,360
Did you gift it twice?

794
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm sorry if I didn't see.

795
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,020
I thought you give...

796
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,300
Did you give the 100?

797
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,360
Oh, my God!

798
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,420
No, it was once.

799
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,740
Okay.

800
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,500
Oh, my God!

801
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,580
No, it was once.

802
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:53,880
Sorry.

803
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,840
It just bugged out on chat.

804
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:56,960
Okay.

805
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Brutal Legends.

806
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,600
It's voting time.

807
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,800
Okay.

808
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,060
Brutal Legends.

809
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,880
Yay or nay?

810
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,660
Yeah.

811
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,120
You guys had, like, so much time to vote for this.

812
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,100
Um...

813
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,700
But, yeah.

814
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
It's quite, like...

815
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,200
It's quite unfortunate indeed.

816
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:29,460
But, like, that means when I do finally have my AdSense account, it would be, like, two months worth of payout.

817
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,500
That's for sure.

818
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,500
Like...

819
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,060
That's a good thing.

820
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,840
I get two months of payout by the time I do get my pin.

821
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,300
But, yeah.

822
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,660
It's a little pro tip.

823
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,340
Like, don't expect yourself to win.

824
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,480
Don't expect yourself to get the...

825
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,280
Get, like, monetized.

826
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,260
Like, get the money right away from YouTube.

827
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,060
Make sure you have a backup plan.

828
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,240
Thank God I have a merch store.

829
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,820
I did not realize, like, how much money you can make off of merch.

830
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,720
It was crazy.

831
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,820
I was like, thank God.

832
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Thank God I opened a merch store alongside of me coming back here because, like, that's practically my income right now.

833
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,860
That's...

834
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,720
That's...

835
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,000
Because, like, I do have the money from that.

836
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,320
I don't know.

837
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,300
It's a good thing.

838
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,740
It's a good thing.

839
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,080
Sgt.

840
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,220
Thank you for the super chat, thank you.

841
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,600
Thank you.

842
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,960
First ever super chat.

843
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,420
Might I suggest and shout it.

844
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,420
Thank you for the super chat, Sgt.

845
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,880
Thank you.

846
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,480
Thank you.

847
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,160
I really do appreciate it.

848
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,660
Awesome game.

849
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,440
What an amazing set.

850
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,860
I heard they got a lot of, like, old rock bands for the Brutal Legend.

851
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,560
Rock and metal bands for this.

852
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,640
This is like, oh my gosh, a while back though.

853
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
I'm surprised Brutal Legend is still there.

854
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,520
Brutal Legends has not been remastered yet because like, um...

855
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,640
You know, a lot of game companies love to bank off nostalgia factor.

856
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,060
So it's like very surprising to me that they have yet to like remaster Brutal Legends because...

857
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,520
It's DMCA Central.

858
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,620
Yeah, it's DMCA because it was a game made before like people stream and stuff.

859
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,700
But still, I feel like... I guess like getting rights would be really difficult too.

860
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,760
Yeah, I guess I didn't know about music rights.

861
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,600
Usually for games, they only have a license for music stuff for like a specific amount of time.

862
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:31,060
And then after that when the music license expires, um, they have to like replace the music with something else or they can never re-release it.

863
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:44,420
So like if Brutal... so like some games and some movies, the reason why they don't get remasters or remixes is because the music license expire and it's so fucking expensive to get the music license that they can't get it.

864
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,160
And then they just say no.

865
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,500
They just say... they're just like, yeah, no, we don't want to deal with that.

866
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,660
It's way too much money.

867
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,680
It's too much money to remaster and give this to you.

868
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,000
Um...

869
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,840
What is this?

870
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,080
I will forever hate this game.

871
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,740
Tried so many times to get it through over the past decade.

872
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,700
Why do you hate this even on easy mode?

873
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,800
I can't get past the ghost rate part.

874
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,300
I can't get past the ghost rate part.

875
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Halfway through.

876
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,580
There's a reason why no one has ever tried a mashup of these styles in a game like this since it just doesn't.

877
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,540
Bro, why are all these negative comments?

878
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
They're just shit at video games.

879
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,100
Like, I think that's literally a skill issue.

880
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,820
I'm sorry, Mickey, for putting you on blast.

881
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,280
But like, what do you mean?

882
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,080
Even on journalist mode, I can't get past the ghost rate part.

883
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,320
Halfway through.

884
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,860
Okay, there it is.

885
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,120
Um...

886
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,980
There it is.

887
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,340
The one negative comment.

888
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,600
Most helpful.

889
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,260
Would have been good if it kept the hack and slash.

890
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,220
But the RTS is awful.

891
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,480
And near the end gets impossible.

892
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,600
Look, there it is.

893
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,440
My token negative comment of the day.

894
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,100
Alright!

895
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's see how long you guys vote for.

896
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,880
Alright, yay!

897
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,840
Alright, next.

898
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,700
Brutal Legends.

899
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,500
That is a yay from all of you.

900
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,680
Um...

901
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,960
Alright, next game.

902
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,500
Have you played Alien Isolation?

903
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,140
Yes.

904
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,060
Never again.

905
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,580
Zach, uh, but thank you for the super chat.

906
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,000
Thank you.

907
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,560
Thank you.

908
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,040
We have part one.

909
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,060
If you look around, you will find the archives.

910
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,480
That's all I can say.

911
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,020
All of my previous stuff I've played.

912
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,160
If you look hard enough, you will find an archive of it.

913
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,220
That's all I can say.

914
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,320
That's all I can say.

915
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,060
I will not replay it.

916
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,940
I will absolutely not replay it.

917
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,500
Master Chief Collection.

918
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,020
Thank you for the super chat.

919
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,440
Thank you.

920
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,040
Thank you.

921
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,940
Master Chief Collection is 75% off right now.

922
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,000
Since you said...

923
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,880
Oh my gosh.

924
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,520
Okay, this one, um...

925
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,180
I feel like I don't even need to, like, have you guys vote on it.

926
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,440
We're just gonna watch the trailer.

927
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,740
This doesn't need a...

928
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,280
Sorry, but you're not permitted to view these material at this time.

929
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,880
Why not?

930
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,160
Oh, okay.

931
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,380
Was I just not old enough?

932
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,480
I'm like, what do you mean I'm not permitted?

933
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,960
Okay, we can watch the fucking trailer.

934
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,580
Um, we don't even need to vote.

935
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,740
Because it's obviously gonna be a yay.

936
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,500
I know for sure you guys are just gonna vote yay for this.

937
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,540
But I can play Halo now!

938
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,220
I've never played Halo before.

939
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,700
I've never...

940
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,040
Because I never grew up with Xbox.

941
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,120
So I have no idea what the fuck Halo really is.

942
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,480
I don't know the story of Halo.

943
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,860
The most things I know about Halo is that it's a game.

944
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,620
Halo is red versus blue.

945
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,620
Because of, uh, rest in peace rooster teeth.

946
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,520
I can't believe Ruby graduated.

947
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,000
2024 has been a fucking weird year.

948
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,120
2024 has been a fucking weird year.

949
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,280
There's so many...

950
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,560
So many, like, old school YouTube people So many, like, old school YouTube people are like, done with YouTube.

951
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,420
It's actually crazy.

952
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,360
Yeah, rest in peace.

953
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,120
And like, Ruby just became like a fucking VTuber too.

954
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,360
They actually became like VTubers.

955
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,520
It's been three months.

956
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,800
I know, it's been three months.

957
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,180
A lot of like, all the old school stuff has been like, super...

958
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,880
They've just like, either retired, quit, or...

959
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,660
or just graduated.

960
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
It's actually insane to think about.

961
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,420
Yeah, Ruby was an official VTuber.

962
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,790
It's actually interesting too.

963
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:44,770
Because like, obviously we're not voting for this because we all know, um, that's obviously a yay.

964
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,350
That's obviously a yay.

965
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,910
Is there a bad Halo game in this collection?

966
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,730
But the reason why I've never played an Xbox...

967
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,610
I've never played Halo before is because Halo was an Xbox exclusive.

968
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,710
And I've never played...

969
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,450
I've never really...

970
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,690
The only Xbox I own was the Xbox 360.

971
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,290
For those who didn't hear this story before, they're all good.

972
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,350
All of them.

973
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,290
Maybe four.

974
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,690
But the more you play the game, the worse it gets.

975
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,450
Because money!

976
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,850
Um, but if you guys didn't know, I never grew up with Xbox.

977
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,310
Because my dad's a gamer.

978
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,810
And he's a Sony fanboy.

979
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,130
Because he loves Playstation.

980
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,210
So...

981
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,790
He's a...

982
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,290
He's a Playstation fanboy.

983
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:38,430
So like, when growing up, we've only owned Playstations.

984
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:46,390
I've never like, had a Nintendo console until like the end of the Gamecube life.

985
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:58,390
And I only was able to get it because it was like for my birthday and I was like begging for a Gamecube because I never owned a Nintendo console because my dad would be like Nintendo's for fucking babies.

986
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,270
I'm like, but I am a baby.

987
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,590
Dad's like, those Nintendo's were for fucking babies.

988
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,050
No Nintendo in this house.

989
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,150
But um, I'm baby.

990
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,930
So I never had a chance.

991
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,930
So the only time I ever got like a Nintendo console was the Gamecube.

992
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,550
The moment it was dead.

993
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,870
Like there was no new games coming out.

994
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,850
So there was a bargain for that console.

995
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:39,370
And I only had two games on the Gamecube because there were no new games coming out.

996
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,710
And I didn't know what to buy.

997
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:46,810
And my dad was like, you can pick, usually when you head to like, um, in Canada it would be like EB games.

998
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,110
So my dad would be like, you can only pick one game.

999
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:56,390
And then obviously I would choose a PlayStation game because a lot of the really good games, the new games, come out on the PlayStation.

1000
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:05,690
So I had to, so I was just like, so I would pick PlayStation games versus old ass Gamecube games.

1001
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,430
And the only two games I owned on Gamecube was Animal Crossing.

1002
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,490
And um, um, like the Shadow Pokemon games.

1003
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,790
I don't remember what they're called.

1004
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:16,910
.

1005
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:16,950
.

1006
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,310
The Shadow Pokemon games.

1007
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,850
Those were the only two games I owned on the Gamecube and that was it.

1008
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,550
.

1009
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,010
Yeah, I call it Xean and Xean.

1010
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,070
Sorry, three of them because I bought the sequel too.

1011
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,390
I bought the sequel of the Shadow one too.

1012
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,790
Um, so those were the old, so yeah, I never grew up with an Xbox.

1013
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:46,430
The only time I was playing the Xbox 360, because my dad like, uh, wanted to play like some Xbox exclusive game on the Xbox 360.

1014
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,170
And even then, I didn't even, I didn't play Halo.

1015
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,670
I didn't play Halo.

1016
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,050
Oh, I think it was Gears of War!

1017
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:53,750
Yes!

1018
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:59,750
The only reason why my dad bought an Xbox 360 was for Gears of War.

1019
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:00,510
.

1020
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,970
That was the only time.

1021
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,770
.

1022
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,610
That was the only reason why we had it.

1023
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:11,830
.

1024
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,210
And then after that, we never bought an Xbox console since.

1025
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:15,770
.

1026
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,370
Anyway, next game.

1027
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,630
Sorry, story time.

1028
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,450
I'm pretty sure like all the... Halo.

1029
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:23,910
.

1030
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,470
Halo.

1031
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,170
Good.

1032
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,310
.

1033
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,010
Halo Reach broke me, but Halo 2.

1034
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,170
You know what?

1035
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,830
That sounds reasonable.

1036
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,190
.

1037
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:36,930
Nice.

1038
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,390
Those are good reviews.

1039
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,210
.

1040
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:44,150
Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say I'm gay.

1041
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:44,930
Nice.

1042
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,470
The chat is going so fast, they'll never know.

1043
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,030
They'll never know, guys.

1044
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:49,570
Oh, shit!

1045
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,770
Our token negative comment!

1046
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:51,690
.

1047
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,510
A wonderful slice of nostalgia ruined by a toxic community.

1048
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:56,510
.

1049
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:56,690
What?

1050
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,690
What does that have to do with Halo?

1051
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,530
That just has to do with the fanbase.

1052
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,290
Like, the developers can't control what's going on on the fanbase.

1053
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,510
Like, that's not their fault.

1054
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,890
What do you mean?

1055
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,570
What do you mean?

1056
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:16,530
Also, like, this guy's a pussy because, like, every multiplayer game has a fucking toxic community.

1057
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:24,810
Like, you can't... like, the first time I ever queued up for Valorant, people were fucking saying gamer words to me.

1058
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,270
And I was like, what?

1059
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:27,810
And it was the first...

1060
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,830
And it was on Valorant launch.

1061
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:30,830
.

1062
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:30,970
Like...

1063
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:31,410
.

1064
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,370
Like, it was the launch of Valorant.

1065
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:41,450
Like, if a game can't control shit, people are fucking toxic on the launch of a game.

1066
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,890
.

1067
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:46,430
It's just always... it's just the multiplayer syndrome.

1068
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,750
.

1069
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:50,870
.

1070
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,530
It's called competitive multiplayer.

1071
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,770
.

1072
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,750
.

1073
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,650
Alright, let's see.

1074
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,710
What else?

1075
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,750
What else do we have?

1076
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:00,710
.

1077
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,070
.

1078
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1079
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,710
.

1080
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:03,850
Thank you.

1081
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,010
It ain't a multiplayer.

1082
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,030
People aren't salty.

1083
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,630
.

1084
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:07,770
Exactly.

1085
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:09,890
.

1086
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,050
What is self park?

1087
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:11,770
It'll be funny.

1088
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:11,950
.

1089
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:12,470
Please, please, please.

1090
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,410
Okay, this one doesn't need to be voted on because I 100% won't play it.

1091
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:15,990
.

1092
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,530
Um... the self...

1093
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:17,730
.

1094
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:18,730
The... what is fract...

1095
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:18,970
.

1096
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,610
The fractured butthole?

1097
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:21,450
Yes.

1098
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:21,650
.

1099
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,090
Fractured but hole.

1100
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:25,470
Yeah, sorry.

1101
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:25,610
.

1102
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,150
I've always wanted to play it out on stream, so don't worry about it.

1103
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,010
I'm definitely not gonna play the first one.

1104
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,090
I might try to get the Australian version just to, like, not get, like, too .

1105
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:42,670
I don't know if there's, like, super controversial jokes in the sequel to the self park game.

1106
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:49,410
I, like, 100% complete... I never 100% complete games except for the stick of truth.

1107
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:57,250
The stick of truth might be the first game I ever 100% it because I really enjoyed that game.

1108
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:12,650
But, like, I played the original game without the Australian censored version, um, because I mean, it's smart because the original game had a lot of stuff in there that I don't know if I can stream it.

1109
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,430
.

1110
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,870
So I feel like... I feel like...

1111
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:27,990
I feel like if there's... if it's very similar... if it's very similar in the sequel, I might need the Australian version.

1112
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,830
I might need...

1113
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,250
.

1114
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:30,310
.

1115
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:30,810
.

1116
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:38,010
Just maybe because I don't want to get my channel flagged.

1117
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:38,990
Um...

1118
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:40,690
Let's see.

1119
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:41,930
Uh...

1120
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,090
What else?

1121
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,570
Let's see.

1122
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:48,170
EDF 4.1 Shadow of New Despair.

1123
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:48,550
Trust.

1124
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,690
Liam, thank you for the magenta super.

1125
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,970
Thank you, thank you.

1126
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,270
Alright, what is this?

1127
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,010
Earth Defense Force.

1128
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,290
The only thing I know about this game is that, um...

1129
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,950
it's very popular in speed running communities.

1130
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:09,370
Especially in AGDQDKDF especially in AGDQDKDF DC.

1131
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,270
EDF Super Scout News.

1132
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,950
We'll fill you in on that and give you the latest information.

1133
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,550
EDF.

1134
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:35,650
EDF.

1135
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,190
Oh, the other...

1136
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,650
EDF walked so hell divers can run.

1137
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,150
EDF walked so hell divers can run.

1138
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,850
Walking Fortress Balaam was deployed to oppose the Erginus.

1139
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,490
Giant creatures that appeared from the ocean.

1140
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:49,850
Giant creatures that appeared from the ocean.

1141
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,890
This dependable powerhouse is mankind's mobile stronghold.

1142
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,610
And now, equipped with new weapons, it's achieved perfection.

1143
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,450
Look at its power.

1144
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,290
Strongness.

1145
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,010
More than ever before.

1146
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,890
Well, I could win without it, yeah.

1147
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,750
But it helps for sure.

1148
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,090
You sound confident.

1149
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,410
I love democracy.

1150
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,030
Where's the gameplay?

1151
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,030
Oh, there's the gameplay.

1152
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,110
I was like, where the fuck is the gameplay?

1153
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,250
Wait, how many people can play?

1154
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,810
There's so many people.

1155
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:25,790
There's so many people.

1156
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,370
The environments, the type and number of enemies.

1157
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,490
And the locations in which they appear can change drastically.

1158
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,470
Oh my god, it's the roguelike.

1159
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,430
Because it changes.

1160
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,830
There's robots.

1161
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,330
I love robots.

1162
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,470
... with new weapons, such as the depth crawler.

1163
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,610
Oh, four.

1164
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,250
Okay.

1165
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,170
Bring it on.

1166
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,730
It'll keep me from getting bored.

1167
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,390
In fact, Officer Honda, wouldn't you say the world looks clearer lately?

1168
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,610
Is this like the best EDF?

1169
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,070
Because they have so many.

1170
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,630
Is this the best one?

1171
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,430
It's the jankiest EDF.

1172
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,970
Five is the best.

1173
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,670
Why did you suggest 4.1?

1174
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,090
Alright, if we do yay or nay, we're gonna have you guys vote for which EDF though.

1175
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,190
It's quality.

1176
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,050
Which makes it the best.

1177
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,190
It's the best.

1178
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,330
Alright, we're gonna have you guys vote for 4.1 or 5.

1179
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:45,890
Jesus Christ!

1180
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,110
This is a 9 minute tre- We're not watching 9 minutes.

1181
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,350
Alright, alright.

1182
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,870
Clearly this is a yay.

1183
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,710
So I'm gonna make another poll.

1184
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,570
EDF, which version?

1185
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,790
EDF 4.1 5.

1186
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,610
Bro, why is this 9 minutes of trailer?

1187
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:08,530
What?

1188
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,610
Holy shit.

1189
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,070
Oh my god, kinda like Helldivers 2.

1190
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:19,270
If Helldivers 2 Okay, that's good.

1191
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,050
That's pretty good, not gonna lie.

1192
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,050
Helldivers 2 servers at max capacity.

1193
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,550
So I gotta play the next best thing.

1194
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:42,410
Super fun to play Helldivers 2 if it was- Bro, shots fired!

1195
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:47,630
Bro, he put that review at 5.4 hours.

1196
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,270
Bro, how do you know?

1197
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,630
Jesus, if it was good.

1198
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,150
Oh my god.

1199
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,410
Bro, that's rough.

1200
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,450
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1201
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,510
You guys can't watch 9 minutes- Not 9 minutes, but you guys can watch more of this trailer.

1202
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,450
I'll be right back.

1203
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,530
It's in a lifetime chance.

1204
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,660
EDF has four branches.

1205
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,960
And your duties will vary depending on which one you join.

1206
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,040
But right now, in this specific case, the choice is up to LSTs.

1207
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,520
Okay, let's take a closer look.

1208
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,500
First, the Rangers.

1209
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,100
Thoroughbreds that race across the world.

1210
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,180
Just look at that stance.

1211
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,420
Not an ounce of fat anywhere.

1212
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,660
Look at how fast he stands up.

1213
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,740
It's amazing he doesn't get a head rush.

1214
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,980
As leaders, they can heal everyone who follows them.

1215
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,460
Proving that nice guys don't always finish last.

1216
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,480
We'll show you how tough we are.

1217
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,980
Next up, Wing Divers.

1218
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,060
Angels who dance through the skies.

1219
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,500
They're the best.

1220
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,520
Their flight suits are highly flexible and maneuverable.

1221
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,060
Sexy too.

1222
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,960
But more than that, they're stronger now than ever.

1223
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,960
Perfect in every way.

1224
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,960
Don't worry, we're on the same team.

1225
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,340
Let's have fun out there.

1226
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,880
Air Raiders dominate with their command of bombardments and airstrikes.

1227
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,540
Summon new weapons like Walking Fortress Balamb or Depthcrawler.

1228
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,960
Then climb on in.

1229
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,980
Your mounted weapons are now equipped with laser sights.

1230
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,340
So, even beginners can mow their enemies down.

1231
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,040
All units, commence operations.

1232
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,760
Give em hell.

1233
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,240
Finally, the steel giants we call FENCERS.

1234
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,540
Their armor has been reinforced to godly levels and obstacles mean nothing to them.

1235
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,520
Their boosters and thrusters can not only increase their speed, but also keep them on balance.

1236
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,620
ake.

1237
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,220
There is a challenge.

1238
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,260
2

1239
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:17,480
2 2 2 4

1240
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,680
4 Always, I'll sell too.

1241
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,460
Recount.

1242
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,940
Alright, alright, we'll vote for an EDF again.

1243
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,200
We're gonna do another vote for EDF again.

1244
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:50,180
At the end of the stream, we'll let you guys vote for like which EDF at the end of the stream, okay guys?

1245
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,940
Who said I wasn't just?

1246
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,160
I thought 6 was like not out in NA yet.

1247
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,620
Okay, I already like EDF 5 more because it's not a 9 minute trailer.

1248
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,540
Mom, can we buy EDF?

1249
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,640
Can we play EDF?

1250
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,720
We have EDF at home.

1251
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,980
EDF at home.

1252
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,220
Helldivers 2.

1253
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,960
Look, it's to the point!

1254
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,620
Guys, the trailer's to the point!

1255
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,700
It instantly told me everything I needed to know in EDF.

1256
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,580
Within a minute instead of 9 minutes.

1257
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,680
I killed God and yet ants on the highest difficulty are extremely stressful.

1258
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,540
What a magical game.

1259
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,700
Fun with friends if you have them.

1260
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,540
Oh my god, bro.

1261
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,640
Are you...

1262
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,820
Oh my god, that's why he has 0.3.

1263
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,680
0.3 hours!

1264
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,240
Bro!

1265
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,540
Bro!

1266
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,220
This poor man!

1267
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,180
He only has 0.3 hours on record!

1268
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,700
Oh, bro!

1269
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,520
Bro!

1270
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,380
Bro!

1271
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,600
Okay, it's his old account.

1272
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,060
Bro!

1273
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,600
Bro!

1274
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,220
Guys, I don't think we can defend him.

1275
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,480
Guys, I know you guys really want to.

1276
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,400
But we have to face reality, guys.

1277
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,560
Alright, next game suggestion!

1278
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,980
Uh, what's this?

1279
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,360
One vote for Gurumon.

1280
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,200
Sean, thank you for the super chat!

1281
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,220
Thank you, thank you!

1282
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,800
What the fuck is this?

1283
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,400
What is this?

1284
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,000
Massive!

1285
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,220
Falcon!

1286
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,540
What is this?

1287
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:48,900
Oh, yes.

1288
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,760
When did this game come out?

1289
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,300
Oh!

1290
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,460
Is this RPG?

1291
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:55,980
This is an RPG.

1292
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,940
What

1293
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,720
the fuck is this?

1294
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,670
What the fu- Okay, I love the faces of the monsters.

1295
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,230
Oh my god!

1296
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,250
I love those types of faces.

1297
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,090
They're so cute.

1298
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,710
Oh my god, monkey!

1299
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,150
We need our monkey emote back.

1300
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,040
This feels... Oh, this definitely feels like a PSP game.

1301
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,840
While watching this.

1302
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,740
This definitely...

1303
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,280
It definitely feels like a PSP game.

1304
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,200
I don't know.

1305
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,680
The thing is, it's an RPG game.

1306
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,480
That... Okay.

1307
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,000
Alright, let's... That's like the biggest part.

1308
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,400
I see RPG and I'm like...

1309
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,920
Mmm...

1310
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,800
I think the last time I've ever played an...

1311
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,840
Um...

1312
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:44,280
The last time I've ever actually played an RPG game...

1313
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,300
Um...

1314
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,360
Was... Was it Nioh?

1315
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,720
The one... From the creators?

1316
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,320
From level 5.

1317
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:52,660
Ah, fuck.

1318
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,420
Was that... Was that what it's called?

1319
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,360
That was the last RPG game I've ever played.

1320
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,680
Uh...

1321
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,560
And like...

1322
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,060
No, it's not Nioh.

1323
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,340
Sorry.

1324
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,020
Oh, Noita!

1325
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,700
Is it Noita?

1326
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:05,900
Okay.

1327
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,740
Is Nino... Yeah, Ninokuni!

1328
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,540
Ninokuni!

1329
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,300
Yes!

1330
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,200
Yes!

1331
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,420
It's about that little boy!

1332
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,260
That's all I can remember.

1333
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,180
The Ninokuni and like this like pig guy.

1334
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,980
That's all... And I only played up to an hour.

1335
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,560
And then I gave up.

1336
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,920
The only reason why I tried it is because I am a level 5 like fangirl.

1337
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,260
And I... I love level 5s like...

1338
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,760
Animation style and everything.

1339
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,960
And like... Yeah, I only...

1340
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:39,500
That was the last time I've ever played an RPG game.

1341
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,120
Because I could only do one hour of that.

1342
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,400
Because I was just like... Oh my god.

1343
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,340
This is...

1344
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,220
I just couldn't... I could not...

1345
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,240
I don't... I don't see stick of truth.

1346
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,480
Okay, not gonna lie.

1347
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,400
I don't see like...

1348
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,040
I know like you guys are like...

1349
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,800
Yeah, but it's based off of like Dungeons and Dragons.

1350
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,260
I don't see stick of truth as an RPG.

1351
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,600
It transcends RPG.

1352
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:11,760
Like...

1353
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,580
No, no, no, no.

1354
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:21,400
South Park stick of truth is not an RPG.

1355
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,600
It is beyond that.

1356
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,620
It is a God's gift.

1357
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,820
Okay, I shouldn't say that.

1358
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,460
That's actually really fucked up that I said it.

1359
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,540
If you play stick of truth, that's so...

1360
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,380
I'm so sorry.

1361
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,200
Let me rephrase it.

1362
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,780
The stick of truth is like...

1363
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,560
Just...

1364
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,440
It is such a good game.

1365
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,420
That it has no...

1366
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,920
It has no category.

1367
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,100
It is...

1368
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,460
It is an adventure.

1369
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,200
It is like...

1370
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,260
It is like...

1371
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,860
An experience.

1372
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,480
It has no category underneath it.

1373
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,080
So...

1374
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,380
So it's not an RPG.

1375
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,800
It is an experience.

1376
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,340
I refuse to categorize that as an RPG.

1377
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,840
Oh wait, I lied.

1378
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,660
Baldur's Gate was my last RPG.

1379
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:20,580
I...

1380
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,260
I just...

1381
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,400
Guys, I couldn't...

1382
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:25,560
I can't...

1383
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,760
I played Baldur's Gate for like...

1384
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,840
3 to 4 hours.

1385
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,860
Like Baldur's Gate 3.

1386
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,840
I forgot about Baldur's Gate 3.

1387
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,260
Anyway, the last RPG I played was Baldur's Gate 3.

1388
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:43,500
And...

1389
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,080
I just wasn't into it.

1390
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,860
I'm sorry.

1391
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,080
I'll say it.

1392
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,860
I just wasn't into it.

1393
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:56,420
I know that RPGs is just something that my FPS brain rotted.

1394
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,120
Like...

1395
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,820
My FPS rotted brain couldn't like...

1396
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,720
Couldn't like commit to.

1397
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,950
I know it's a really good game.

1398
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,170
I heard it's a really good game.

1399
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,630
I tried it.

1400
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,830
But my fucking...

1401
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:19,650
My brain has already been like rotted from all the FPS games I played.

1402
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:24,230
That I couldn't sit down for Baldur's Gate 3 long enough.

1403
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,670
But I...

1404
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,770
But you know what makes me better than some of the other games?

1405
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,790
You know the other Baldur's Gate 3 gamers?

1406
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,690
I didn't cheese the dice roll.

1407
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,590
I fucking committed to it.

1408
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,800
No matter what.

1409
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,620
I'm already above some people in Baldur's Gate.

1410
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:49,220
Cause I didn't reset when I didn't get my dice roll.

1411
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,460
Like some other pussy.

1412
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,160
Anyway, that's...

1413
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,560
Alright.

1414
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,500
Let's see.

1415
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,440
Originally a Japanese PC game released in 2004.

1416
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,420
Oh my god.

1417
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,180
2004.

1418
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,260
I thought that was just a stylistic choice.

1419
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,960
I mean it makes sense now.

1420
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,160
It makes sense.

1421
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,340
Gurren walked so Hi-Fi Rush could run.

1422
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,100
Oh wait.

1423
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,620
Is this like similar to Hi-Fi Rush?

1424
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,100
I actually really enjoyed Hi-Fi Rush.

1425
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,120
That was a nice game.

1426
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,820
I'm glad it won something.

1427
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,060
Did somebody else quit right before the final boss?

1428
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,300
Because he couldn't figure out what to do?

1429
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:30,960
Hahaha.

1430
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:34,720
Okay.

1431
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:35,860
Um.

1432
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,900
As much as I love the old Falcom, this felt rather uninspiring.

1433
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,700
Seems closer to Zelda than other series by the same...

1434
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:42,860
Wait.

1435
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,880
What other series do they do?

1436
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:45,980
Anyway.

1437
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,180
Hi-Fi Rush is not an RPG.

1438
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,440
It's like a hack and slash.

1439
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,980
It's more like a hack and slash than it is an RPG.

1440
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,960
What do they do?

1441
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,040
What are games at this point?

1442
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,360
What have they done?

1443
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,660
I have no idea what any of these games are.

1444
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,160
Hahaha.

1445
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,040
I have no idea what any of these games are.

1446
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:11,760
Haha.

1447
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,300
Wait.

1448
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,040
Is this even on...

1449
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,740
Oh it is.

1450
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,780
Four dollars?

1451
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,740
Holy shit.

1452
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,020
It's only four dollars.

1453
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,040
What the fuck?

1454
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:20,440
Alright.

1455
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,220
Oh my god.

1456
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:22,980
Okay.

1457
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,100
Hahaha.

1458
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,120
Hahaha.

1459
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,480
Hahaha.

1460
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:26,960
Hahaha.

1461
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:31,800
Okay.

1462
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,500
I don't want to use my veto on this.

1463
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,740
I feel like I could use my veto on other things.

1464
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,900
I feel like...

1465
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,720
I feel like I don't wanna...

1466
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,920
I don't want to use my veto on this game.

1467
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,300
I don't wanna...

1468
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,220
Alright.

1469
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,380
Uhh.

1470
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,680
You know what game I can't wait to play?

1471
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:56,900
Okay.

1472
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,340
Digimon World.

1473
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,200
But the good one.

1474
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,020
Is this the good one?

1475
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,900
Is this the sequel?

1476
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,360
Wait.

1477
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,360
Is this the good one?

1478
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,680
Hasran, Rampart...

1479
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:07,800
No!

1480
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,940
This is the...

1481
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,380
Wait, no.

1482
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,420
Actually, wait.

1483
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,920
Which one is the remastered Digimon World?

1484
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,540
Is it Digimon Sur...

1485
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:17,820
No.

1486
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,580
Which one is the...

1487
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:18,940
Wait!

1488
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,040
This is not the remastered, right?

1489
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,320
There is no...

1490
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:22,540
Okay.

1491
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,280
To be fair.

1492
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,060
There was one good Digimon game.

1493
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,560
And it was...

1494
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:27,900
Okay.

1495
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,240
Like, I said...

1496
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:29,540
Okay.

1497
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,320
I shouldn't say that.

1498
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,160
Because, like, Digimon fans...

1499
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,140
They are so divided on what is a good Digimon game.

1500
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,120
Because in...

1501
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,820
In...

1502
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,360
In Pokemon.

1503
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:40,760
It's more...

1504
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,880
It's easier to tell what's a good Pokemon game.

1505
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,220
But, like, in Digimon...

1506
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:46,800
It is...

1507
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:52,840
Digimon fans cannot agree what is a good Digimon game.

1508
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,100
Because, like, every Digimon game...

1509
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,000
There's something wrong with it.

1510
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,260
There's something wrong with it.

1511
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,180
Every single time.

1512
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,480
It is very divided.

1513
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,700
So, no one is gonna actually agree what is considered a good Digimon game.

1514
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,520
Because everybody don't know what is considered a good Digimon game.

1515
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,000
But, personally...

1516
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,800
My favorite Digimon game...

1517
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,080
Is the original Digimon world.

1518
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,800
But that is because of nostalgia factor.

1519
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,000
And...

1520
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,460
I thought it was on...

1521
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,940
I thought the remaster was on Steam.

1522
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,360
What happened to it?

1523
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,440
Wait.

1524
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,900
What happened to the original Digimon?

1525
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,900
Wasn't the remaster on...

1526
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,480
I thought the remaster...

1527
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,540
Or was it on console?

1528
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,280
Was it on console?

1529
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,340
Or, like...

1530
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,580
No, it came out!

1531
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,540
I saw it!

1532
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,040
I remember it came out!

1533
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,180
It's next order?

1534
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,320
No way!

1535
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,680
It's not next order!

1536
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,480
I know for a fact it's not.

1537
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,660
It came out on...

1538
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,500
On PC.

1539
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:04,820
Because I saw it!

1540
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,700
I saw it!

1541
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,580
No, I didn't!

1542
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,840
They remastered the first Digimon!

1543
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,680
Was it called Digimon world?

1544
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,740
Okay.

1545
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,560
It was like a PlayStation game.

1546
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,580
It was a PlayStation 1 game.

1547
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,220
And I played it.

1548
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,000
And then...

1549
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,020
And then they like remastered it.

1550
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,240
And then they...

1551
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,660
PSP?

1552
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,760
They put it on PSP?

1553
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,360
I'm so sad.

1554
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,300
I'm so sad.

1555
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,580
I thought it was on...

1556
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,440
I thought it was on PC.

1557
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,020
Who the fuck uses the PSP?

1558
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,320
Do people still use the PSP?

1559
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,300
I did not realize the PSP is still alive.

1560
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,700
I did not realize.

1561
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,200
I'm so sad now.

1562
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,480
I didn't realize it's still alive.

1563
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,920
Who the fuck?

1564
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,620
Who the fuck?

1565
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,600
I'm sorry for anyone that still owns a PSP.

1566
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,520
But like...

1567
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,580
Why?

1568
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,720
Why do you go outside and play on PSP?

1569
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,240
I can't stand the PSP sliding.

1570
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,300
But...

1571
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,840
The screen is bigger.

1572
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,260
On the PC.

1573
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,020
It's bigger.

1574
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,880
Me with my PSP.

1575
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:34,980
Okay.

1576
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:35,760
Alright.

1577
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,440
I'm sorry.

1578
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,760
I'm just sad that it's not released on PC, guys.

1579
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:40,640
Okay.

1580
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,740
I'm just...

1581
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,660
Look, I'm just salty it's not released on the PC.

1582
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,860
Okay, guys.

1583
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,860
I'll say it.

1584
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,780
I'm sad.

1585
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,740
I wish it was on the PC.

1586
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,160
Uh...

1587
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,280
Kuro, thank you for the magenta soup.

1588
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,140
Thank you.

1589
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:54,680
Thank you.

1590
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,020
Highly recommend.

1591
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:56,880
Prey.

1592
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,180
It's basically Bioshock in space.

1593
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,400
What's this?

1594
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,360
Wait, that...

1595
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:01,940
Oh.

1596
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,800
Wait, isn't...

1597
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,200
Isn't this...

1598
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,000
Wait, didn't we have a vote for this before?

1599
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,780
I feel like...

1600
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,060
I feel like we watched this trailer before.

1601
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,100
I feel like...

1602
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,720
I feel like we watched this trailer before.

1603
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,840
I feel like...

1604
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,940
The world can be spared.

1605
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,000
It has to be me.

1606
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,740
Isn't that the..

1607
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,640
That's Asian guy!

1608
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,420
Yeah, I was going to say that.

1609
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:24,860
That's like...

1610
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,700
I was going to be like...

1611
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,720
I was going to be like...

1612
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,580
Wait, isn't that the Asian guy?

1613
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,300
That's like...

1614
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:38,580
Wait, I don't know if I should say that because I was like...

1615
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,080
That being my main takeaway from this game from the trailer.

1616
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:46,820
This UK is getting someucha.

1617
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,400
I feel like this is definitely... this looks really fun though.

1618
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,560
I wonder how long it is.

1619
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,820
It looks incredibly long.

1620
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:08,740
2017.

1621
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,600
I miss when games took like more than a year to develop.

1622
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,520
Those were the good old days.

1623
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,200
Now it's all about capitalism and DLCs.

1624
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,980
One of my personal favorite games of all time.

1625
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:21,580
Nice!

1626
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,960
In a world of malicious sins, Prey is often labeled a masterpiece.

1627
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,520
One of the greats.

1628
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,600
I wish I could forget the story and play this.

1629
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
Oh it's like... what is it?

1630
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,600
Outer Wilds?

1631
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,080
Okay, like I was hanging out with some friends and then like...

1632
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,160
I just... I just like... I just like found out about this.

1633
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:50,740
But... but basically Outer Wilds... there's like a server for people who like...

1634
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,340
who...

1635
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:58,200
who love Outer Wilds because apparently the story is really good in Outer Wilds that like...

1636
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:06,240
that like people would try to... there's a server dedicated to fighting other streamers who are streaming other...

1637
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:14,240
other wilds so they can live vicariously through that streamer to re-experience other wilds.

1638
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,060
And I... I... that blew my mind.

1639
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,240
It's like... it's like gotcha viewers.

1640
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,180
There's like...

1641
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:37,800
Discord servers for like... like fans of gotcha games where like they would link streamers that are doing gotcha pulls so they can live vicariously through streamers who are doing pulls because they don't want to do the pulls themselves but they want to live vicariously through that streamer.

1642
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:51,560
And that's why whenever like gotcha streamers do pulls their viewers... their viewership like skyrockets really high because they're like... like if their channel gets linked in those servers like it'll be like an ad everyone this streamer is doing a gotcha pull.

1643
01:10:51,560 --> 01:11:01,980
Of this game and that's why like their viewership like skyrocketed high for like whenever they do pulls because they want to live vicariously through them but not spend the money.

1644
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:11,920
This is the same with Elder Wilds and I found this out because I have friends trying to convince me to stream elder wilds so they can watch my stream and live through me.

1645
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,420
Because they're like... they're like Doki you have to stream Elder Wilds.

1646
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,340
I wanna watch you play Outer Wilds!

1647
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:32,660
So like, cuz they're like, if I could, I wish I could wipe my memory of this game so I can re-experience Outer Wilds.

1648
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,640
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1649
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,360
I was like, what the fuck?

1650
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:51,520
No, I didn't... one of my friends is actually in one of those Outer Wilds discords, where like, whenever someone's streaming Outer Wilds, they would like, watch that streamer.

1651
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,880
They don't care who that streamer is.

1652
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,500
They just wanna live vicariously through that streamer.

1653
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,920
It's actually crazy.

1654
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,520
I did not know that.

1655
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,820
Like, I didn't realize it had the same commute, like the same like, impact that it does for gacha games.

1656
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,380
It's actually crazy.

1657
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,560
Oh, there we go!

1658
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,540
My one negative point.

1659
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:15,840
My review.

1660
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,180
Cannot disable motion flare!

1661
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,820
I like how that is the only negative review.

1662
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,800
It's the only negative review here.

1663
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:31,700
Wait!

1664
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,080
That sucks!

1665
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,260
Wait, I can't disable!

1666
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,140
You know, bro, that actually...

1667
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,420
That sucks though.

1668
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,460
I cannot disable motion flare.

1669
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,560
Wait, that fucking sucks though.

1670
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,020
Wait, that actually...

1671
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,780
That actually ruins a lot of games for me, not gonna lie.

1672
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,600
Literally unplayable.

1673
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:49,580
Honestly.

1674
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,560
It's okay.

1675
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,720
We're gonna try.

1676
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:52,440
Pray.

1677
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,400
Don't worry.

1678
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,480
LordCruises!

1679
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,880
Thank you for the superchip...

1680
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,360
Thank you for the Akasupa!

1681
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,740
Thank you, thank you!

1682
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,360
So, the Yakuza fanbase.

1683
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,520
Also, I recommend Yakuza, but it's an RPG.

1684
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,880
So, I will recommend Devil May Cry 5.

1685
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,940
The Devil...

1686
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,840
Is that the one with the...

1687
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,060
With the emo boy main character?

1688
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,160
Oh no, that's not him!

1689
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:26,750
Yeah, I will veto Yakuza because it's like a 100 plus hour game.

1690
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,150
I don't know if I can...

1691
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:33,130
I don't know if I can do that.

1692
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:44,490
Oh, good!

1693
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,610
It's not with the emo boy, Dante!

1694
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,060
I love Devil May Cry.

1695
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:08,840
I...

1696
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,040
I...

1697
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:13,220
Like I say, I love Devil May Cry, but I've only played Devil May Cry 1.

1698
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,400
It's because I grew up watching my dad play Devil May Cry.

1699
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,480
I think I watched him play from 1 to 3.

1700
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,080
And I personally played 1 myself on stream.

1701
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,200
90% yes!

1702
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,240
10% liars!

1703
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,840
Who are the 10% that voted no?

1704
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,120
Show yourself!

1705
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,860
I love the concept.

1706
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,840
I love watching my dad play Devil May Cry.

1707
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,760
The music is really good though.

1708
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,020
I think music like makes or breaks the game.

1709
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,370
I would veto Nier.

1710
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:15,630
Because like, Nier is like...

1711
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,610
Nier is also like a 100 plus hour game.

1712
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,810
It's gonna take me...

1713
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,210
It's gonna take me fucking forever to finish it.

1714
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,410
Devil...

1715
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,420
Okay.

1716
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,420
Devil May Cry is so cool.

1717
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,420
I wish sex was real.

1718
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,280
177 people found this review helpful.

1719
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,800
Very powerful.

1720
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,740
Wait, why is the chair so powerful?

1721
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:47,680
Only 100?

1722
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,820
Well, you better go vote upvote that.

1723
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,200
Better upvote that.

1724
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,840
What the fuck?

1725
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,320
Okay.

1726
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,340
5 stars.

1727
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,020
Great.

1728
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,400
Over the years, I've been stabbed and jabbed by a number of things.

1729
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,760
Proceed to stab myself.

1730
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,320
Yes.

1731
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,280
Oh my god!

1732
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,520
This is the first game with 0 negative reviews!

1733
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,680
Guys!

1734
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,460
It dropped from 90% to 89%?

1735
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,580
What the fuck?

1736
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,660
Who's the 11% that voted no?

1737
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,560
The 11%...

1738
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,900
Oh my god!

1739
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,300
This is the first game, guys!

1740
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,120
The first no negative review game that we found!

1741
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,040
Oh yeah!

1742
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,640
Thank you for the superchat again for the suggestion!

1743
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:33,780
Okay, here we go.

1744
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,180
11% is not motivated.

1745
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,280
All right.

1746
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,100
And that is it.

1747
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:38,260
Yes.

1748
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,900
I don't think we have a no yet.

1749
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:42,860
Uh...

1750
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,380
Let's see.

1751
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,040
In memory of Akira, I recommend Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.

1752
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:50,660
Oh,

1753
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,400
thank you for the super chat!

1754
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,300
Thank you, thank you!

1755
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,540
Wait, I've only played one Dragon Ball Z...

1756
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,620
Okay, it's not on Steam, guys.

1757
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:12,160
Oh, I just spelled it wrong!

1758
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:12,500
Okay.

1759
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,640
Okay, wait.

1760
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,140
Is it actually not on Steam?

1761
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,940
Is it like a Steam exclusive?

1762
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,220
Like a region lot?

1763
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,520
Wait, is it region lot?

1764
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,080
Why is it not...

1765
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,380
Do Canadians... Oh, there it is.

1766
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,060
What the fuck?

1767
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,960
Why did it let me?

1768
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,160
Oh, that's so weird!

1769
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,860
Is this a fighting game?

1770
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,160
The Dragon Ball game fans deserve a little Dragon Ball.

1771
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,300
Rest in peace.

1772
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:46,840
I actually... One of my uncles is a big fan of the author.

1773
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:49,280
Um...

1774
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,200
Is this... But is this like a fighting game?

1775
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:52,940
Or is this...

1776
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,340
It's an ARPG...

1777
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,640
Kinda RPG beat-em-up.

1778
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,900
Um... And like, not just Dragon Ball, but they basically owned like the whole...

1779
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,840
Okay, let me... I'm pretty sure this is gonna be a yay up to 90%.

1780
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,580
That makes me...

1781
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,800
So happy.

1782
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,680
As an Asian that loves sales, that makes me so happy.

1783
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,180
But like, basically, I owned... Not owned, sorry, my uncle...

1784
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,320
This is the same uncle... You guys don't remember the story.

1785
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:34,640
But this is the same uncle who used to own lots of manga and lots of like Gundam and everything.

1786
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:41,280
And then he got married and the wife told him that he needed to like get rid of half of his collection.

1787
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:46,660
Or like, not half, but majority of his collection.

1788
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,260
It was that uncle.

1789
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,640
Anyway...

1790
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,220
Anyway...

1791
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:56,520
Um... Basically, before he got married...

1792
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,200
Before he got married...

1793
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,940
Um... I would like...

1794
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,860
Uh... Cause like he used to live with his parents.

1795
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,300
And then like I would hang out with my grandparents...

1796
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,540
At my grandparents' place.

1797
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,540
And I would love to like hang out in his room while he's like on his...

1798
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:15,740
Like I would like just relax in his room while he was on his PC doing... I don't know...

1799
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,380
Whatever...

1800
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,660
Otaku weeb shit he was doing.

1801
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:25,440
And... And I would like...

1802
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,400
I would like hang out like...

1803
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,220
Like I would just be like on his bed reading his manga collection.

1804
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,040
So he had like a huge... Like three bookcases filled with like manga.

1805
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,760
And I would like... And it would all be like in Chinese.

1806
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,960
So I couldn't really read it.

1807
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,120
But I just love looking at the pictures.

1808
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,760
And... Um...

1809
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,280
He basically had every single...

1810
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,680
Uh... Manga that...

1811
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,360
Uh... That Kira published.

1812
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,200
Every single one of them.

1813
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,240
Like the one shots.

1814
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:56,380
Like all his one shots that were put into manga form.

1815
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,740
All... Like everything.

1816
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,200
Like not just Dragon Ball.

1817
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,000
But like...

1818
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,360
Uh... Dr. Slump.

1819
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,860
And every like obscure...

1820
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:04,700
There was like this one with this vampire boy.

1821
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,480
I don't remember the name of on the top of my head.

1822
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,540
But there was one with this vampire boy.

1823
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,940
And then there was one with this like fox child.

1824
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:12,980
Or whatever.

1825
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:13,940
And...

1826
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,600
Like every single one shot he would own.

1827
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:22,100
He was like a super like a Kira fanboy.

1828
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,060
And I would like read...

1829
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,560
I would just read his manga.

1830
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,880
It's not Sand Land.

1831
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:27,800
It's not Sand Land.

1832
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,740
It was a one shot.

1833
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,660
It had like 11 chapters I think.

1834
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,600
It's not Sand Land.

1835
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,460
It was basically like a...

1836
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,920
He had... It was like this ghost fox.

1837
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,540
That was... Like it's like this little spirit.

1838
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,760
Fox spirit or something.

1839
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,680
And it would like...

1840
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,160
And then he has to save a hundred people.

1841
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:44,860
Yeah!

1842
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,060
He has to save like a hundred people.

1843
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,420
To like become a person again.

1844
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,840
And for some reason that one shot...

1845
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,240
Was like stuck in my mind for the longest time.

1846
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,680
And I actually re-read it too.

1847
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,880
I like...

1848
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,740
Um...

1849
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,940
I re-read the manga for that.

1850
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,360
Because it was like when I heard about him passing away.

1851
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,640
It just unlocked like a core memory of mine.

1852
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,020
Of just like hanging out in my uncle's room.

1853
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,700
And just reading his manga collection.

1854
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,320
I think it was Gogo...

1855
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,160
Gogo Ackman.

1856
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:15,660
Yeah, yeah.

1857
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:16,960
Um...

1858
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,220
I would have to force her at the speed of light.

1859
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,080
If my partner asked me.

1860
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,580
He has three kids together.

1861
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:29,700
Guys!

1862
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,900
They have three kids together.

1863
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:41,860
Anyway...

1864
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:42,840
Um...

1865
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,740
But yeah...

1866
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,400
I would...

1867
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,540
I just remember like just...

1868
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:47,980
Um...

1869
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:48,580
But yeah...

1870
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,420
He was like a huge...

1871
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,560
Like he had every co...

1872
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,200
Every...

1873
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,320
Just everything.

1874
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,800
I just remember he had the full collection of Dragon Ball.

1875
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,080
The full collection of Dr. Slump.

1876
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,060
Every single manga that he has published.

1877
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,360
He owns it.

1878
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,500
And he was a like super Gundam builder.

1879
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:09,660
Um...

1880
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:13,100
I will not be seeing the ones who like Gundam.

1881
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,280
I guess.

1882
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,480
Um...

1883
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,880
Let's see.

1884
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,960
Rest in peace.

1885
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,500
Oh...

1886
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,160
Are you crying, son?

1887
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,020
No!

1888
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:26,880
Oh my god.

1889
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,300
Who the fuck said...

1890
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,040
Who...

1891
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,300
Oh, this was like before.

1892
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:30,820
Okay.

1893
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:31,640
Um...

1894
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,560
Oh, it's just DLC.

1895
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,060
Everybody hates DLC.

1896
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,220
If it's super overpriced.

1897
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:37,780
No!

1898
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:41,540
Alright.

1899
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,420
That's a yay.

1900
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,380
I don't think we have a...

1901
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,860
Yeah, we don't have a single name yet.

1902
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:46,960
Um...

1903
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:47,880
Alright.

1904
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:49,780
What's this?

1905
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,040
Duck of Life!

1906
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,580
Thank you for the Akasupa!

1907
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,220
Thank you, thank you!

1908
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:56,100
Alright.

1909
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:56,600
What's this?

1910
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,620
You know what I can't wait to play?

1911
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,000
I need to get like people though.

1912
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,160
I need to like recruit people.

1913
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:01,540
Like...

1914
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,620
It's so hard finding like people to play collabs.

1915
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,900
Like reaching out.

1916
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,720
Because I can't add everyone anymore.

1917
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,840
I can't...

1918
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,200
I can't add everyone.

1919
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,440
I have to actually...

1920
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,040
So sure reach out to people.

1921
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,120
There's one game I really want to play.

1922
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:23,960
And it's Duck Game.

1923
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,820
Because it's such a fun game with friends.

1924
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,820
I have to DM people.

1925
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,240
Nah!

1926
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:36,600
Socializing.

1927
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,260
I love Duck Game.

1928
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,840
Oh, I already voted for this!

1929
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,820
This was a yay!

1930
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,700
Well, this was a yay.

1931
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,360
We don't need to...

1932
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,620
We don't need to look back.

1933
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:48,160
I will give you guys previous yays.

1934
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:48,820
Okay?

1935
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,960
We don't have to...

1936
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,880
We don't have to like vote again for old yays.

1937
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,660
I remember we yayed this.

1938
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,200
We yayed this before.

1939
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,420
Ummm...

1940
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,020
I'm suggesting a hat in time.

1941
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,320
Because it has a 50 player co-op.

1942
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,020
If you...

1943
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,800
What?

1944
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:10,800
Like...

1945
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,300
Modded or actual?

1946
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,680
What do you do with 50 players and hat in time?

1947
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,260
Isn't this a platformer game?

1948
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,780
Isn't this...

1949
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:22,720
How is this a 50 player game?

1950
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:28,020
How?

1951
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,500
Where do the hat of 50 players do?

1952
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,300
I remember when this game was a Kickstarter game.

1953
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:49,140
The rare moment when Kickstarter games turned out okay.

1954
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,220
By the way, I kickstarted that...

1955
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:51,660
What was it?

1956
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,760
That rhythm game?

1957
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,060
With like the boyfriend girlfriend shit?

1958
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,280
Fuck.

1959
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:56,940
What was...

1960
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,400
Friday Night Funkin'?

1961
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,060
Bro, what the fuck is going on with that Kickstarter?

1962
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,180
I think...

1963
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,600
Did the devs run away with our money?

1964
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,300
I think...

1965
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,080
I think...

1966
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,280
I think...

1967
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,880
There hasn't been an update to it in like...

1968
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,600
Fuck a year plus I feel like.

1969
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,880
Bro, did you hear the...

1970
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,940
Did you hear the rumors?

1971
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,280
Did you guys hear the rumors?

1972
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,760
That the dev is out there fucking...

1973
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,380
Sipping Coca-Cola?

1974
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,120
Read between the lines.

1975
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:36,860
What?

1976
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:37,480
What?

1977
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,100
What?

1978
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,080
What?

1979
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,660
What?

1980
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,000
What?

1981
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:46,000
I saw the fucking rumors and I was like, what?

1982
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,580
I don't know if it's true or not.

1983
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,280
I don't know.

1984
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,180
I just heard the rumors and I was like...

1985
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,120
And I looked at the...

1986
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,920
I looked at the Kickstarter and I was like...

1987
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,240
There has not been an update in a long time.

1988
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,000
And I was like...

1989
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,240
What's going on?

1990
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:05,760
What's...

1991
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,000
What's going on?

1992
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:09,980
It's not...

1993
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,220
It's not true.

1994
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,040
Oh, thank God.

1995
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:12,520
Thank God.

1996
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,140
Because like...

1997
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,260
The thing is...

1998
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:16,500
There was plausible like...

1999
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,420
There could be plausible truth in it.

2000
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,740
Because like...

2001
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:21,780
Ever since...

2002
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,680
Because like...

2003
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,400
A lot of...

2004
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,780
Friday Night Funkin came from Newgrounds.

2005
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,420
Yeah?

2006
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,240
But the thing is...

2007
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:28,780
Like...

2008
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,140
There has been like...

2009
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:36,320
Artists and like voice actors that came from Newgrounds that spiraled hard.

2010
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,880
So I was like...

2011
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,820
I was like...

2012
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:39,980
I was like...

2013
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,740
Okay.

2014
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,600
There could be like plausible truth because of the...

2015
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,200
Because...

2016
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:46,760
Due to...

2017
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:52,840
Due to like past experiences with other creators on Newgrounds.

2018
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,060
So I couldn't...

2019
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:58,840
I was...

2020
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,100
Okay.

2021
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:02,220
I have a lot of my humor and a lot...

2022
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:05,780
Like you can tell that I was a Newgrounds kid due to my humor.

2023
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,680
Because I grew up on Newgrounds.

2024
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,280
Like...

2025
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,140
You can...

2026
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,680
It's super fucking wild.

2027
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:15,040
But like I didn't grow up on that side of Newgrounds.

2028
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:15,640
The...

2029
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,620
There's like two sides of Newgrounds.

2030
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,980
The one that's there for obvious like R18 shit.

2031
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:28,360
And the other side that really enjoyed the games and animations that were not those.

2032
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,260
So...

2033
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,560
So...

2034
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,260
I don't know.

2035
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,340
Is that Egoraptor?

2036
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,560
First time reviewing a game.

2037
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,960
Got a cat here.

2038
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,280
Friends passing by.

2039
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,660
You can touch him and click like to pet him once.

2040
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,320
This game is good.

2041
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:53,060
Play it now.

2042
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,240
The best 3D platform I played in a long time.

2043
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:58,860
The thing is there hasn't been like a lot of...

2044
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,700
Like 3D platformers are not the meta.

2045
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,880
So there haven't been the...

2046
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:07,460
Like good platformers in general.

2047
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:08,980
Um...

2048
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:11,600
You were a Henry St- No, I was like more of the edgy ones.

2049
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:17,580
Like, I liked the, you know, like the tank men shit and um...

2050
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,020
Back when Egoraptor actually animated stuff.

2051
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:29,000
I was like so hyped for any like Egoraptor animations that would come out.

2052
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:34,240
And also like, obviously I shouldn't be watching those things back then.

2053
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,500
And uh...

2054
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,200
And then also like, what was it?

2055
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,880
The Alice Returns.

2056
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:45,040
The Alice games I remember very fondly of.

2057
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,240
I don't remember what the game was called.

2058
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,320
The Alice games.

2059
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,540
And uh...

2060
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:55,680
And then obviously like Alien Homin- like Castle Crashers when it was a Newgrounds game.

2061
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:56,960
And...

2062
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,180
There's a lot of- I just remember like snippets of stuff.

2063
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,340
And then all the animation.

2064
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,600
Oh, Ed's World too.

2065
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,080
That was on Newgrounds.

2066
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,640
Rest in peace!

2067
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:11,500
I remember when I saw a YouTube channel when he was like talking about like his hospitalization and stuff.

2068
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,720
And I was like, oh my god.

2069
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:16,160
I was like- like as a fucking- that would- gave me like trauma.

2070
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,900
Cause I was a kid.

2071
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,620
I like seeing that on YouTube.

2072
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,920
Like I was like, holy shit.

2073
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,260
Like as a kid seeing that.

2074
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,020
Um...

2075
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:28,620
No, no.

2076
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,060
It's like a Newgrounds game.

2077
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,060
It's not American McGee's Alice.

2078
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,460
Great game too.

2079
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:36,380
I wish there was a sequel- like I wish they made more.

2080
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:40,300
Cause I really enjoyed the lore and the art direction of Alice.

2081
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,600
Um...

2082
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,340
But like...

2083
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,160
Um...

2084
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:52,220
Honestly, I heard like American McGee is very- as a developer...

2085
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:53,880
Um...

2086
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,720
I'm trying to put this nicely.

2087
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,340
Like...

2088
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:09,460
I'm trying to figure out a way to put this nicely.

2089
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,280
Oh yeah, Alice is dead!

2090
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,820
Alice is dead.

2091
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,000
That's a good game.

2092
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,940
Like that's on Newgrounds.

2093
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,000
Like that's a good game.

2094
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,240
But he...

2095
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,860
A bit of a diva, I would say.

2096
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,600
A bit of a diva.

2097
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:32,860
Um...

2098
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:34,800
Let's see.

2099
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,180
Uh...

2100
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:36,680
Yes!

2101
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:37,900
Okay, Haddon Tom.

2102
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:38,940
That passes.

2103
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:40,940
Uh...

2104
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,520
Let's see.

2105
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:47,920
What else?

2106
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:48,680
What else?

2107
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,360
What else do we have?

2108
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,660
What about Space Marine?

2109
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,360
Uh, Imagina!

2110
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,340
Thank you for the super chat!

2111
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,180
Thank you, thank you!

2112
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:59,280
Be a big ass armor guy crushing Xenos!

2113
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,620
Also, you should check Boltgun again to finish the job!

2114
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,060
Okay, Space Marine.

2115
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,380
Space Marine!

2116
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:09,620
Ghost Trick, I wouldn't vote for it because honestly...

2117
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,480
Uh, Ghost Trick, I really want to play it in the future.

2118
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,060
So we don't need to vote for that.

2119
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,020
Is this the... retro?

2120
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,080
2011.

2121
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,620
I wish Gears of War was an Xbox exclusive.

2122
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,120
Or Microsoft exclusive.

2123
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,540
Oh, gee.

2124
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:36,000
I can't wait for the sequel.

2125
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,980
The sequel looks really fun.

2126
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,290
For the Emperor!

2127
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:03,430
Brothers!

2128
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:05,230
Brothers!

2129
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:15,030
I have known nothing about Warhammer except for the Space Marines.

2130
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:19,170
I feel like every...

2131
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:22,090
Like all the normies outside of the Space...

2132
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,210
Like the Warhammer...

2133
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:27,730
The Warhammer fandom only knows about the fucking Space Marines.

2134
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:30,790
I don't know anything else about this game.

2135
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,070
About the lore.

2136
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:34,610
We are Space Marines.

2137
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:36,390
Brothers!

2138
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,690
I am war!

2139
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,750
Brothers!

2140
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,290
I can play this now!

2141
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:44,790
Brothers!

2142
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:46,730
Wait, what?

2143
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:48,350
This game is just like...

2144
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:48,910
Wait, what?

2145
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:50,230
I scroll down.

2146
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:51,050
The first...

2147
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:52,270
The first review.

2148
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,410
This game is great.

2149
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,490
But what the fuck is this shit?

2150
01:32:57,010 --> 01:33:00,510
$60 for a decade plus old game?

2151
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:03,690
That's simply bundled together with DLC?

2152
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:07,510
There's nothing new in this anniversary edition.

2153
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:09,790
Raised up price like a million dollars.

2154
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:13,850
A greedy mega corp just before the release of Space Marines 2.

2155
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:15,550
Pathetic.

2156
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:20,530
Bro, look at him.

2157
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:21,990
Didn't wait for the...

2158
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:23,190
What the fuck...

2159
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:24,610
80% off!

2160
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:26,730
Look at this guy.

2161
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:29,930
Didn't wait for the steam sale.

2162
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:35,170
Bro literally could have waited a month later.

2163
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,690
He's not a brother.

2164
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:38,990
Look at this brother!

2165
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,130
The fool!

2166
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:42,110
Look at him!

2167
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:50,970
Also I was gonna say, like, that's just the Nintendo way.

2168
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:59,010
But when Nintendo does it, no one gives a fuck about it.

2169
01:33:59,030 --> 01:34:00,270
Or they just too scared to complain.

2170
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:01,070
I'm too scared.

2171
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:03,970
I'm honestly too scared to play Nintendo games on YouTube.

2172
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:19,310
I might need to ask my manager how to avoid angering Nintendo.

2173
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:22,670
Like, on Twitch?

2174
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:25,130
On Twitch it's easier.

2175
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:37,330
Because, like, the reason why people can stream Nintendo games very easily on Twitch is because the streaming policies on Twitch is a lot like...

2176
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:44,530
Like, you can't really, like, copyright strike people on Twitch regarding... other than music.

2177
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:49,690
For game-wise, it's, like, almost impossible to do on Twitch.

2178
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:56,350
But, like, on YouTube, it's obviously... a lot of people like to abuse that system.

2179
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:02,550
Unless... yeah.

2180
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:06,630
Unless, like, you have, like, you have to sign up to something.

2181
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:07,730
Because I remember, like...

2182
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:10,030
A long time ago, I remember reading about this.

2183
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:18,490
That, like, you can, like, sign up to be, like, a official Nintendo content creator or something on YouTube.

2184
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,490
But you need to, like, apply for it or something like that.

2185
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:26,090
So they won't, like, automatically, like, strike your videos when you're playing Nintendo games.

2186
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:30,990
And that's for, like, outside of... like, outside of Japan.

2187
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,250
So, like, I don't know if that's still a thing.

2188
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:35,910
I just need to ask Mr. Man about it.

2189
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,710
So I don't know if the Partners Program is still a thing.

2190
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:42,990
For people in... people in NA.

2191
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,130
So I don't know.

2192
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:44,570
It's not?

2193
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:45,730
So, like, I don't know.

2194
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:46,550
Like, the thing is...

2195
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,390
I don't want to piss off Nintendo.

2196
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,230
It's not... I don't know.

2197
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,830
I'm not updated in, like, the new shit of what Nintendo wants now.

2198
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:58,790
So, like, I need to see.

2199
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,950
It's no longer a thing?

2200
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:01,550
Okay.

2201
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:02,350
Alright.

2202
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:06,470
But even then, I need to make sure that everything is okay.

2203
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,710
When it comes to me streaming Nintendo games on YouTube.

2204
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,890
Because, like, I don't want it.

2205
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:12,230
I'm...

2206
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,870
Nintendo is, like, one of the...

2207
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:14,430
I don't...

2208
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:19,670
Nintendo is, like, one of the only companies that I'm scared of when it comes to, like, game permissions.

2209
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:20,850
Every other...

2210
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:22,750
Like, because, like, every other time...

2211
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:25,830
Through, like, history...

2212
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:30,950
Whenever, like, any other company but Nintendo, like, try to strike somebody on YouTube...

2213
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:33,550
It turns into huge news and stuff.

2214
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:34,950
Because people will be like, Whoa.

2215
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:36,710
That's a little extreme.

2216
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:42,070
So, no companies want to risk that and stuff.

2217
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:44,230
Because, like, it just gives negative publicity.

2218
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:49,550
But, like, Nintendo-wise is the only company I'm scared of when it comes to game permissions and things like that.

2219
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:50,430
Like...

2220
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:58,050
So, that's why I'm not risking it.

2221
01:36:58,150 --> 01:37:02,290
Like, I need to make sure I am safe when it comes to Nintendo games.

2222
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:04,930
But also, I'm not...

2223
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,650
Also, like, IMO...

2224
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:11,010
There's, like, not really a lot of Nintendo games I would want to, like, actually stream.

2225
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:13,150
Because, like...

2226
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,270
I'm not, like...

2227
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:16,870
I don't know.

2228
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:17,410
There's, like...

2229
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:18,330
I'm not, like...

2230
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:19,630
I didn't grow up with Nintendo.

2231
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:24,130
So, I don't have the huge nostalgia factor playing in on anything.

2232
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:28,590
And the only thing I like about Pokemon is, like, the OG...

2233
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:32,810
Like, I'm not a fan of the new Pokemon series other than the Legends stuff they've done.

2234
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:33,810
But, like...

2235
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:34,990
Because Legends was, like, new.

2236
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:36,910
It was, like, a new way of doing Pokemon.

2237
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:43,170
But other than that, I didn't grow up with nostalgia for Nintendo games.

2238
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:44,890
Because I didn't grow up...

2239
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:49,490
Like, my dad didn't let me play Nintendo games because I didn't have consoles for it.

2240
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:56,830
So, I literally have zero nostalgia for Nintendo.

2241
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:02,150
So, like...

2242
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:03,790
Whenever, like, a new Nintendo game...

2243
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,150
Comes out, I'm not, like...

2244
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:08,290
Like, it doesn't really affect me too much type deal.

2245
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:14,710
I prefer Crash Bandicoot racing game versus the Mario Kart.

2246
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:20,950
I honestly think the Crash Bandicoot racing game is better than Mario Kart for me.

2247
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:25,310
Like, after playing both of them, I like the Crash Bandicoot one more.

2248
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:25,910
Yeah.

2249
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:33,730
The dad moves too slow.

2250
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:34,390
Strong.

2251
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:37,850
Let's see.

2252
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:38,790
Alright.

2253
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,690
Space Marine.

2254
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,290
That is a yay.

2255
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:45,070
I feel bad for the first person who gets the name.

2256
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:48,290
I'm so sorry if you were in the first one.

2257
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:51,870
Let's see.

2258
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:01,190
Great.

2259
01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:02,390
Thank you for the super chat.

2260
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:02,710
Thank you.

2261
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:03,150
Thank you.

2262
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:05,030
I heard somebody say Project Nexus.

2263
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:06,310
I concur 100%.

2264
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:08,090
That is a great game.

2265
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:09,090
Project Nexus.

2266
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,110
What is that?

2267
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:13,250
Let's see.

2268
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:28,990
Wait.

2269
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:29,990
I know this game.

2270
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:31,650
Wasn't this a Newgrounds game?

2271
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:35,770
Or was this from a Newgrounds creator?

2272
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:38,490
I've seen their animation.

2273
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:41,050
Yeah.

2274
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:42,650
I've seen their animation.

2275
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:44,150
I told you I'm a Newgrounds.

2276
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,830
I grew up on Newgrounds.

2277
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:46,590
Like, I recognize the game.

2278
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,070
I recognize this.

2279
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:47,610
Yeah.

2280
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,390
I recognize this.

2281
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:11,970
This room looks...

2282
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,690
This reminds me of...

2283
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:14,610
Fuck.

2284
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:15,110
What was that?

2285
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:15,850
Hotline Miami?

2286
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,090
It's like feels...

2287
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:22,050
The gameplay seems very similar to Hotline Miami.

2288
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:24,510
It's a third person...

2289
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:28,510
Run and gun beat-up.

2290
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:30,350
Filled with arcade style action.

2291
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:31,550
20...

2292
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:32,350
2021.

2293
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:33,530
Oh, this is recent.

2294
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:34,110
2021.

2295
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:36,010
Let's see.

2296
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:37,430
I don't know if it's good or not.

2297
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,810
I think I need to play...

2298
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:39,350
What?

2299
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:41,010
Holy fuck!

2300
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:42,450
I was like, wait.

2301
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:43,050
What do you mean?

2302
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:49,090
Bro, this man has 857.7 hours.

2303
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:50,790
Bro!

2304
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:52,390
What?

2305
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:54,170
Okay.

2306
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:56,190
I need to see if his account is public.

2307
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:58,830
What the fuck?

2308
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,330
Okay.

2309
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:01,810
Jesus Christ.

2310
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:04,810
Guys, I think he really likes...

2311
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:07,490
I think he really likes this game, guys.

2312
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:10,050
I love Madness Combat.

2313
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:11,210
I love Madness Combat.

2314
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,310
I love Madness Combat.

2315
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:14,750
She yanked all my...

2316
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:15,090
What?

2317
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:17,510
Oh, she ha...

2318
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:17,970
What?

2319
01:41:18,150 --> 01:41:20,190
That doesn't make more sense to me.

2320
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:23,170
I regret refunding this game.

2321
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:24,550
Okay.

2322
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:26,030
Peak gaming right here.

2323
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:30,290
You can grab a fire extinguisher and beat people.

2324
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:30,750
A little bit.

2325
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:31,550
10 out of 10.

2326
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:32,110
All right.

2327
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,570
I need to check this guy's profile.

2328
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,370
All right.

2329
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:38,970
Guys, I think he really likes Project Nexus.

2330
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:42,890
Bro.

2331
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:45,470
Bro, he got everything.

2332
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:47,530
Holy shit.

2333
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,550
Sorry for doxing you, bro.

2334
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:53,070
But bro, he has all the achievements.

2335
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,490
Holy shit.

2336
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:57,070
Bro, maybe...

2337
01:41:57,070 --> 01:42:00,270
Maybe he really likes this game.

2338
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:02,590
He likes Project Nexus, guys.

2339
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:05,770
I think he really likes this game, guys.

2340
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:09,790
Holy fuck.

2341
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:12,130
Bro, his review is...

2342
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:13,490
I got to play more.

2343
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:16,170
His review was like, I got to play more to make me sure.

2344
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,290
Oh my...

2345
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:19,050
He knows...

2346
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,270
He knows what's up.

2347
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:24,110
He really, really, really likes it.

2348
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:27,590
Liam.

2349
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,230
Thank you for the magenta soup.

2350
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:30,090
Thank you.

2351
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:30,270
Thank you.

2352
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:30,690
Thank you.

2353
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:37,190
Rain World is a 2D survival platformer where you are the prey animal in a simulated ecosystem.

2354
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,530
The other wilds is a 3D...

2355
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:39,930
Okay.

2356
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:44,110
Other wilds, I'm definitely going to do it in the future due to peer pressure.

2357
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:49,290
Due to peer pressure from my friends.

2358
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:51,030
So, like, don't worry about that.

2359
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:51,950
That, you don't need to vote.

2360
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:55,510
Okay.

2361
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:56,210
Rain World.

2362
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,920
Let's see.

2363
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:02,400
Okay.

2364
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:06,630
What is this?

2365
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:11,150
You're a nomadic slug cat, both predator and prey in a broken ecosystem.

2366
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:16,510
Grab your spear and brave the industrial waste, hunting each food to survive.

2367
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:19,590
But be wary, other bigger creatures have the same plan.

2368
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:22,170
And slug cats look delicious.

2369
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:23,530
It's like jelly.

2370
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,150
You will suffer in this platformer.

2371
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:29,130
That's the trailer?

2372
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,370
Does it just end like that?

2373
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:33,770
Oh, I guess it's like gameplay trailer.

2374
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:34,230
I don't know.

2375
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,970
I was going to be like, wait, what the...

2376
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:38,170
It just ends.

2377
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:40,570
It just ends.

2378
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:45,770
Where's predator?

2379
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,910
The old world died.

2380
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:49,130
A new ecosystem evolves.

2381
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:50,110
Kill.

2382
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,320
I'm mad that Mark...

2383
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:56,840
Okay.

2384
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,900
How long is this game though?

2385
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:02,480
There might be a reason why you didn't finish it.

2386
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,600
Because, like, for...

2387
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:03,920
Okay.

2388
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,520
Variety streamers...

2389
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,140
Here's like a little streamer tip for you guys.

2390
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:21,120
The thing about variety streaming is that, um, unless you're like, you're like a certain focused gaming stream, like in terms of like your focus on like a certain genre.

2391
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:27,540
For variety streamers, there is a limit on like how they think is like viewer retention.

2392
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:33,680
And I point because in the past, let's plays were very common.

2393
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:35,800
It's very common to do let's plays.

2394
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,020
But streamer meta has evolved to the extent.

2395
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:45,400
Where like if you're a variety streamer, um, you can't, you can't do long let's plays anymore.

2396
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,560
Or you have to do edited content.

2397
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:55,360
Uh, because like, so unless you're like a heavy focused genre for a specific genre, you can get away with that.

2398
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,700
But you're in variety streaming.

2399
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,960
Longer gameplay playthroughs are now not meta anymore.

2400
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:09,000
So, so it's like, obviously the more you play the same game, uh, the more you play the same game, the less viewers you're going to have.

2401
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,440
Um, this doesn't apply to multiplayer.

2402
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:12,920
Multiplayer obviously.

2403
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,180
Uh, multiplayer games, it's like competitive and stuff.

2404
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:21,040
But you're playing, if you're a variety streamer, uh, it's harder to keep up.

2405
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:29,340
So like for me, my, I've learned that my hard limit for like, for like, uh, long playthroughs is 3 to 4.

2406
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:31,780
3 to 4 streams usually.

2407
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:32,740
That's the average.

2408
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:37,540
So like, my goal is to always complete a game within 3 to 4 streams.

2409
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:38,980
Because that is like, the limit.

2410
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,500
That's like the viewer retention and everything.

2411
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:47,340
So it's like, you gotta figure out like, what is your like, hard limit when it comes to like, longer playthroughs of streams.

2412
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:56,620
Because, um, when you play the same game for a very long time, people will like, eventually get super bored of it.

2413
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,960
And that's like, the biggest issue of being a variety streamer.

2414
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,140
Uh...

2415
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,540
Let's see.

2416
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:07,140
I wish somebody would make a world re-

2417
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,340
Um...

2418
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:16,820
It's cause, it's cause short form content ruined us.

2419
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:25,900
Like, TikTok and YouTube, like, like TikTok and YouTube, what the f- It's fun to die over and over and over and over and...

2420
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:31,140
What the f- But yeah.

2421
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:36,140
The TikTok and YouTube shorts basically brain rotted a lot of people.

2422
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:42,500
Um...

2423
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:47,800
There is no other game to my knowledge that does what RainWorld does.

2424
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:51,880
There is no other game that can create an environment this alien alive.

2425
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,380
And what the f- Is it playing the same thing again?

2426
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,760
Oh I didn't pause it.

2427
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,680
I was like, what the f- am I even listening?

2428
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:00,440
Oh yeah.

2429
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,980
You're more of a casual gamer.

2430
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:02,820
Do not recommend it.

2431
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:05,560
Grew up- gave up after barely getting a third of the story.

2432
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,240
All right.

2433
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,120
Easy man!

2434
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:07,700
What?

2435
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,140
Bro!

2436
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,520
Wait, no he didn't.

2437
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:11,180
He kept playing.

2438
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,180
So... This liar!

2439
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,080
Oh.

2440
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:16,900
Oh, there we go.

2441
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:17,340
There we go.

2442
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,580
The above paragraph was what?

2443
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:20,580
It was 8 hours.

2444
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:24,180
Now after 40 hours, I beat the game in easy mode.

2445
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:28,540
But cheating sometimes by using the warp mod because the game...

2446
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:29,880
God, my nerves!

2447
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,380
Bro, this man modded his game!

2448
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:36,200
So he can finish it faster on easy!

2449
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:39,340
That's not a casual gamer!

2450
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:41,320
That's journalism mode!

2451
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,680
I'm so sorry if you're watching this stream.

2452
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,380
But like, you gotta accept that.

2453
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:47,860
Like, that's not being...

2454
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:51,600
At that point, like you're not a casual gamer at that point.

2455
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:56,000
That's like actually like... Like you're below casual gamer.

2456
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,180
The fun I had playing it in some parts was...

2457
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:10,140
Offset by frustrations that adds nothing to the game in my opinion.

2458
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:13,360
I would have loved the game if it was like Katana Zero...

2459
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,460
Where the checkpoint is at every screen or something of the sort.

2460
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,280
The problem is not having to deal with a challenging situation.

2461
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:22,420
The problem is having to pass all through the easy part you already passed...

2462
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:24,080
So that you face the challenge again.

2463
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,960
Bro, this guy should never play a Souls game.

2464
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:27,240
Like...

2465
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:31,540
Okay.

2466
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:35,140
Let's see...

2467
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,120
I played Call of Horrors before.

2468
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,620
It said, thank you for the magenta soupa.

2469
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:41,500
Thank you, thank you.

2470
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,460
We played it before.

2471
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,300
Like I said before...

2472
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,040
If you guys didn't know I played these games before...

2473
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:47,560
You can...

2474
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:50,740
If you look hard enough, you'll find an archive.

2475
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:55,280
If you look hard enough, you'll find an archive of it.

2476
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,520
Let's see...

2477
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:02,940
Shark, thank you for the super chat.

2478
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:03,860
Thank you, thank you.

2479
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,180
Bomb rush cyber fight.

2480
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,620
Really fun gameplay and amazing aesthetic.

2481
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:10,940
Alright, here we go.

2482
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:13,840
Let's see...

2483
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,520
What is this?

2484
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:15,820
Woah!

2485
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,320
Woah, this music.

2486
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:22,680
Wait, is this a spiritual successor of...

2487
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,260
Um...

2488
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,220
Fuck, what was it?

2489
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,000
This is a spiritual successor.

2490
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:29,340
Oh, Just Set Radio!

2491
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:29,760
Yes!

2492
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:30,680
Just Set Radio!

2493
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,760
This is basically like Just Set Radio.

2494
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,240
I've always wanted to play Just Set Radio.

2495
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:36,780
So I've always wanted to play Just Set Radio.

2496
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,560
But you made it

2497
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:45,130
up, come on!

2498
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:45,770
Missing With Life.

2499
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:52,790
I wish there was a remaster of The Rapping Game.

2500
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:53,790
I wish there was a remaster of The Rapping Game.

2501
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:54,190
What was it?

2502
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:55,250
Paparappa?

2503
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,350
I forgot his name.

2504
01:49:57,530 --> 01:49:58,690
I didn't grow up with that game.

2505
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:59,790
But I've always wanted to play it.

2506
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:05,180
Loud.

2507
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:05,700
Okay.

2508
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,780
I wish they did a remaster of that.

2509
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:12,040
I wish they did a remaster of that.

2510
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:16,110
That's a good one.

2511
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:17,730
I've never played it.

2512
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:19,090
I've always seen memes about it.

2513
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:20,730
And by that I meant...

2514
01:50:20,730 --> 01:50:23,430
The one that I remember is the one with Batman.

2515
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:25,890
This is where my parents died.

2516
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:31,030
Alright, let's see.

2517
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:31,890
What are the reviews?

2518
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:33,710
Exploring Five...

2519
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:37,050
So they say to hit the graffiti spots and get the rep.

2520
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:38,930
You'll need to challenge the rival crew.

2521
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,890
Is this skateboarding?

2522
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:40,950
Oh yeah, it is.

2523
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:41,430
Skateboarding.

2524
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:43,890
This is just Radio 3?

2525
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:46,250
Wait, why?

2526
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,850
Why do we need to play this game with...

2527
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:49,410
Bro, what the fuck?

2528
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:51,610
What is he... Why?

2529
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:56,350
Please play this game with mods.

2530
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:59,330
I know people judge me for this.

2531
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:02,030
But I only ever bought this game because I saw someone playing as Sonic.

2532
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:03,590
I thought that was incredible.

2533
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:06,970
Jet Set Sonic being a real thing made me happy.

2534
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:08,390
And the fact that I can add my...

2535
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:10,210
Okay, there's even multiplayer mode.

2536
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,510
But like, why does he have so many mods?

2537
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:15,590
What are all these mods?

2538
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,790
Disable annoying cutscenes.

2539
01:51:18,050 --> 01:51:21,010
Final score that gives me my boost rebound.

2540
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:23,990
Custom group just sit down.

2541
01:51:24,230 --> 01:51:25,450
Photo storage...

2542
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:28,490
Bro, that is so many mods.

2543
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:30,730
That's not just Sonic.

2544
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:33,370
To get you started.

2545
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,770
Like better...

2546
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:36,830
What the fuck does better...

2547
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:39,530
What the fuck does BRC toilet mean?

2548
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,230
Like...

2549
01:51:41,230 --> 01:51:42,110
Bro...

2550
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:43,450
Better toilet?

2551
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:46,570
Why is there a toilet function?

2552
01:51:51,370 --> 01:51:55,870
My favorite Sonic model is the 06 model pack.

2553
01:51:58,030 --> 01:52:00,270
Has a tendency to crash games.

2554
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:04,210
I don't think it's this mod that has a tendency to crash games.

2555
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:06,470
I think it's all of this.

2556
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:13,790
I like how he's like...

2557
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:17,490
Yeah, by the way, this mod tends to crash games.

2558
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:18,050
I'm like, no!

2559
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:20,410
Look at all these mods you have!

2560
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:21,270
Bro...

2561
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:27,390
Holy shit.

2562
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:29,450
Oh my god.

2563
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:31,630
Okay.

2564
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:33,710
And you should be good.

2565
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:37,490
Holy fuck.

2566
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:38,110
Like, yeah!

2567
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:40,110
Modding's great and all.

2568
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:42,650
But this is way too many!

2569
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:44,210
For like...

2570
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:45,390
This is not Skyrim!

2571
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:47,470
This is not Skyrim!

2572
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,750
This is fucking...

2573
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:50,210
Bomb Rush Cyberpunk!

2574
01:52:52,030 --> 01:52:52,730
Like...

2575
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:54,950
Better toilet is crucial.

2576
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:56,730
You seriously?

2577
01:52:56,890 --> 01:52:59,910
Yeah, I was gonna say this looks like a fucking Skyrim mod.

2578
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:02,890
Um...

2579
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:04,690
This game will get you laid.

2580
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:05,430
Nice.

2581
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:07,730
Nice.

2582
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:08,990
Alright.

2583
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,050
Hey, don't kink shame.

2584
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:14,450
You should see my Arma 3 mod list.

2585
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:15,870
Uh...

2586
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:16,970
Let's see.

2587
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:17,430
Come on!

2588
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:19,070
Thank you for the magenta soup!

2589
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:20,970
Thank you, thank you!

2590
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:24,150
Okay, I've always wanted to play Hollow Knight.

2591
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:25,630
But I heard it's like...

2592
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:28,210
It's like such a long-term commitment.

2593
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:29,670
I feel like I rather...

2594
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:30,050
I'm gonna...

2595
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,270
The reason why I haven't played Hollow Knight yet...

2596
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:34,190
Is that I'm low-key waiting for...

2597
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:35,070
Uh...

2598
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,610
I'm waiting for like the sequel of Hollow Knight.

2599
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:38,850
Um...

2600
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:40,230
Cause like...

2601
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:41,870
That's the one I'm waiting for.

2602
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:43,970
I don't think I need to do a yay or nay for this.

2603
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:44,730
But like...

2604
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:46,270
I've always wanted to play it.

2605
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:50,570
Hollow Knight is like one of those games that...

2606
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,630
Even though I know it's like a super long game...

2607
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:53,190
I was like...

2608
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:54,850
I'm honestly like super curious.

2609
01:53:55,810 --> 01:53:58,050
But I honestly sort of want to wait for...

2610
01:53:59,270 --> 01:53:59,670
Silksong.

2611
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:03,510
Wait.

2612
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:04,870
What do you mean it's not...

2613
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:05,330
Wait, what?

2614
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,110
What do you mean?

2615
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,670
What do you mean it's not coming out?

2616
01:54:08,670 --> 01:54:11,070
There are so many trailers!

2617
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:12,950
What do you mean?

2618
01:54:16,330 --> 01:54:17,910
Don't say that!

2619
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:20,210
There are so many trailers!

2620
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:21,970
Every...

2621
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:24,670
Don't come out!

2622
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:26,810
No!

2623
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:30,910
Yes!

2624
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:33,910
But that's when you know it's a good game!

2625
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:37,190
That's when you know, guys!

2626
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:39,310
You just gotta believe!

2627
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:44,350
Guys...

2628
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:50,610
Guys, we don't want it to be like all the other fast track games.

2629
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,050
Don't worry.

2630
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:58,610
I will wait a hundred years for the sequel.

2631
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:02,210
For a game I've never played before.

2632
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:06,890
For the sequel of a game.

2633
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:08,330
I'll never play.

2634
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:14,390
300k reviews.

2635
01:55:15,010 --> 01:55:15,730
That's actually...

2636
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:17,110
Honestly, I'm curious.

2637
01:55:17,650 --> 01:55:18,410
I'm curious.

2638
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:20,490
Who fucking gave a negative review?

2639
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:21,870
Like, it's...

2640
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:22,850
Oh, wait.

2641
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,670
There's a guy right now.

2642
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:25,470
Obviously, I'm not far enough in the game.

2643
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,110
Though I absolutely love the art style.

2644
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:28,510
I find the game far too...

2645
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:31,270
Okay, is it all the negative reviews just skill issue?

2646
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:32,910
You are but...

2647
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:34,130
Grim is hot.

2648
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:35,050
Silksong.

2649
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:41,310
Okay.

2650
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:43,950
So, Sucks is a lie.

2651
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:44,950
Okay.

2652
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:49,770
I don't know what the negative reviews are...

2653
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:51,630
For this.

2654
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:51,970
Okay.

2655
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,690
Negative.

2656
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:54,190
That's like 9,000.

2657
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:55,570
Artificial...

2658
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:59,070
All of this are like...

2659
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:00,350
Game is full of bugs.

2660
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:02,910
What even affected my dreams?

2661
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:05,030
Don't buy it if you don't buy it.

2662
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:13,370
What the f- Cat sex the hornet!

2663
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:16,830
Stop looking at negative reviews and buy this game!

2664
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:19,750
I love how like...

2665
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:22,970
Good game might just have skill issues!

2666
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:25,810
All the negative reviews are just like...

2667
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:28,710
Skill issue, I'm not good enough for this game.

2668
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:31,290
He knows!

2669
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:32,750
He knows!

2670
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:34,530
Um...

2671
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:38,590
Uh, garlics, thank you for the magenta soup!

2672
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:39,710
Thank you, thank you!

2673
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:41,890
Don't wait for Silksong.

2674
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:45,650
Hollow Knight is one of the best Metroidvania games ever made!

2675
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,850
If not the best!

2676
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:52,770
Nobody who enjoys Metroidvania style games should go without playing it.

2677
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:55,350
Bro, this guy, I bet you, this guy...

2678
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:57,250
This guy was the one that wrote this review.

2679
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:58,650
Silksong is the one!

2680
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:02,490
It's him!

2681
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:02,730
It's him!

2682
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:03,890
It's him!

2683
01:57:05,530 --> 01:57:05,930
True!

2684
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:08,670
Alright.

2685
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:14,550
Alright, we're gonna look at... We're gonna look at, uh...

2686
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:18,870
I'll give you guys 3 more games, guys...

2687
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:22,490
We're gonna look at 3 more games and then we're gonna call it here, we're gonna call it here.

2688
01:57:22,670 --> 01:57:23,050
Adon!

2689
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:23,870
Thank you for this super chat!

2690
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:24,170
Thank you!

2691
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:26,410
A second inscription...

2692
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:29,670
It's one of my favorite games and it's won Game of the Year when it came out.

2693
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:31,970
It's a roguelike deck builder.

2694
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:38,650
Is that like... wasn't there like a new roguelike card game that came out as well?

2695
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:40,610
I don't remember what it's called.

2696
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:44,090
It is...

2697
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:46,630
What was that game called?

2698
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:47,450
The newest one?

2699
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,950
I almost said Boruto.

2700
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:53,830
I was like, wait, no, that's the sequel of Naruto.

2701
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:55,930
It was so similar!

2702
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:59,090
Who the fuck is this guy that's streaming it?

2703
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:00,890
And it's not me!

2704
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:01,870
Alright.

2705
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:04,630
Let's see.

2706
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:08,970
What was it?

2707
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:11,530
Baloutro?

2708
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:16,520
I've heard about this game.

2709
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,340
This game was like a streaming meta game.

2710
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,380
When it came out.

2711
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:24,800
Inscription.

2712
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,140
Yes or no.

2713
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:29,040
What the fuck?

2714
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:38,310
Yeah, I heard like the...

2715
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,530
Baloutro seems to be like a really fun game.

2716
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:44,610
I've seen a lot of people playing it when it came out.

2717
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:46,930
I don't know what it really is though.

2718
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:49,670
I've never really been like a card game player.

2719
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:51,630
I have no idea what to do.

2720
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:57,390
Because it requires a lot of reading.

2721
01:58:57,950 --> 01:58:59,910
And a lot of like using your brain.

2722
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:03,170
Which is honestly like one of my negative traits.

2723
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,270
Not the reading part.

2724
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:05,890
I can read.

2725
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:06,650
But...

2726
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:08,230
Just...

2727
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:10,430
I can read by the way.

2728
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:12,710
It's more so of...

2729
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:13,990
Of the...

2730
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:17,870
It's more so of the thinking part.

2731
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:20,370
Let's see.

2732
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:22,010
I actually don't know how to play poker.

2733
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:24,350
I watched my dad play poker.

2734
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:27,610
My dad would play like this...

2735
01:59:28,670 --> 01:59:29,110
After...

2736
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:32,490
He would play those like...

2737
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:32,890
Oh my gosh.

2738
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:34,950
If you lived in Asia, you would know those card games.

2739
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:36,390
Like the one with the...

2740
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:38,150
Like the online...

2741
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:38,590
It's not like...

2742
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:38,910
It's like...

2743
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:41,290
Chinese online poker.

2744
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:43,750
Where like there was like avatars and stuff.

2745
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:45,690
And you can like dress up your little avatar.

2746
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:47,010
It was like a blue background.

2747
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:50,030
And then you can like dress up your avatars and stuff.

2748
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:51,090
Like it was like Gaia Online.

2749
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:52,210
And...

2750
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:55,990
I would just watch him play that game.

2751
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:56,790
And...

2752
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:00,330
And then like...

2753
02:00:00,330 --> 02:00:03,650
The more money you win, the more you can decorate your avatar.

2754
02:00:03,650 --> 02:00:04,850
And it was so...

2755
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:05,630
Cause like...

2756
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:06,330
It's like a point...

2757
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:07,430
Like you don't win real money.

2758
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:09,850
But it was like point system and stuff.

2759
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:11,110
No, it was poker.

2760
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:12,230
It was like...

2761
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:14,030
It was so funny.

2762
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:14,930
So like...

2763
02:00:14,930 --> 02:00:17,670
You can tell like who doesn't have money cause they're naked.

2764
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:19,190
They will be on their underwear.

2765
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:20,490
And then...

2766
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:24,110
And then like my dad was like super decked out.

2767
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:31,150
He was like super decked out.

2768
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:33,030
With like costumes and everything.

2769
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:34,270
And there's like cutscenes.

2770
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:37,010
There's like animations if you win the game.

2771
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,080
That's so dumb.

2772
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:47,240
Let's see.

2773
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,200
Why are you reading this?

2774
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:50,820
Just play it and play along.

2775
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:54,860
He turned the computer into a funniest shit I've ever seen.

2776
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,920
Surpassed all my expectations.

2777
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:58,320
Go in blind.

2778
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,860
Don't look anything up.

2779
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:01,300
One of the games I played.

2780
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:02,280
So much effort.

2781
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:02,580
Sweet.

2782
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,340
Thank you for the 20.

2783
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,020
Get the chips.

2784
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:04,460
Thank you.

2785
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:05,060
Thank you.

2786
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:06,920
Uh...

2787
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:07,900
Oh, okay.

2788
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:10,000
It seems like you have to go in blind.

2789
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:11,180
For this.

2790
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,360
It seems like a cool game.

2791
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:20,400
But just me learning the basics makes my head hurt.

2792
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,040
Head hurt.

2793
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:21,640
Tell me hurt.

2794
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,040
Don't worry bro.

2795
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:23,920
That's gonna be me.

2796
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:25,660
0.3 hours.

2797
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:26,880
Refunded.

2798
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:31,840
That's gonna be me guys.

2799
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:33,280
That's gonna be me.

2800
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,300
Head hurt.

2801
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,380
Brain hurt.

2802
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:38,940
Um...

2803
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:39,840
Let's see.

2804
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:40,600
Sleeping dogs.

2805
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,780
Hey boy.

2806
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:42,680
Thank you for the super chat.

2807
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:42,960
Thank you.

2808
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:43,300
Thank you.

2809
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,800
We're not gonna do yay or nay sleeping dogs.

2810
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:47,880
Because that's one of the games that I wanna play in the future.

2811
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,900
This is one of the games I wanna play in the future.

2812
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,500
So we're not...

2813
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,520
We don't have to vote for sleeping dogs.

2814
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:56,400
Let's see.

2815
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:58,120
What else?

2816
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,080
What else?

2817
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,280
What else?

2818
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,700
I'm looking at like...

2819
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:07,400
Indie game suggestions!

2820
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,560
Gee, thank you for the magenta soup!

2821
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:11,740
Thank you, thank you!

2822
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:13,280
King of the castle!

2823
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:17,040
It has Twitch integration so you can play against all the dragoons in the chat.

2824
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:21,860
You play as the queen while all of your chat are backstabbing nobles trying to dethrone you.

2825
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:23,880
It's only like 7 bucks.

2826
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:24,460
Okay.

2827
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,920
What is this?

2828
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:28,440
What the fuck is this?

2829
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:30,600
It's not fair!

2830
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,520
You're all just gonna fucking dethrone me!

2831
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:34,360
How is this fair?

2832
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:41,060
Like, why would I play this with you guys?

2833
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,700
You're all just gonna try and like sabotage me!

2834
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,560
It's not even gonna be a question!

2835
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,680
That's the idea!

2836
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:55,900
That's the idea!

2837
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:05,000
God, that's a lot of politics.

2838
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:15,930
We would never...

2839
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:18,330
How could you say that about us?

2840
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,030
Is that it?

2841
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:20,730
I don't know what's going on.

2842
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:23,450
I don't know what's going on in this game!

2843
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:28,390
In king of the castle you wear the crown.

2844
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:32,970
Make difficult choices that will bring your kingdom into prosperity.

2845
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:34,450
For chaos.

2846
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:45,170
Wait, only three people?

2847
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:47,810
I thought it was like...

2848
02:03:47,810 --> 02:03:49,210
Oh, unless like...

2849
02:03:49,210 --> 02:03:51,810
The Twitch integration can be like one person.

2850
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:57,170
I'm too dumb for this.

2851
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:58,370
Don't worry, Doki.

2852
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:01,110
Thank you, the Super Chat.

2853
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:01,610
Thank you.

2854
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:02,470
Thank you.

2855
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,050
Thank you.

2856
02:04:09,790 --> 02:04:11,470
Oh, you can do teams!

2857
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:26,870
Alright, what are the comments?

2858
02:04:27,010 --> 02:04:29,510
Your majesty, there's no such thing as absolute powers.

2859
02:04:29,610 --> 02:04:30,330
What's the point?

2860
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:32,070
What's the...

2861
02:04:32,070 --> 02:04:32,490
What's...

2862
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:33,950
What's the point?

2863
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:37,610
Wait, it really depends who you're playing with.

2864
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:40,570
The nobles have to be really into the screen and commit it.

2865
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:42,410
I think nobles need a little more to do.

2866
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:43,710
More magic, more intrigue.

2867
02:04:44,090 --> 02:04:47,550
It's a nice party game, but stay away if you have a wide screen or ultra wide screen.

2868
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:47,970
Okay.

2869
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:52,310
I got murdered three times by my friends repeatedly, but I kept coming...

2870
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:54,250
Guys, this is gonna be me!

2871
02:04:55,810 --> 02:04:57,010
Guys, this is...

2872
02:04:57,010 --> 02:04:57,910
I'm redoing this.

2873
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,910
Wait, what?

2874
02:05:01,970 --> 02:05:04,030
My friend got killed by G-Dragon?

2875
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:04,410
Oh, Jesus.

2876
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:05,970
10 out of 10 game?

2877
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:07,770
Guys, I'm redoing this.

2878
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:09,550
You guys are just gonna keep killing me!

2879
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,590
How am I supposed to enjoy it?

2880
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:18,310
I'm vetoing...

2881
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:19,410
This is my only video.

2882
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,910
I'm vetoing this.

2883
02:05:21,130 --> 02:05:23,130
I'm gonna veto this.

2884
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:25,110
No, I had...

2885
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:26,210
That's one...

2886
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:29,810
I'm only vetoed once and this was the only video.

2887
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:34,030
This is literally the only video that I've had.

2888
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:39,650
I'm not gonna let you guys kill me non-stop.

2889
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:41,990
Alright.

2890
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:44,790
Last game suggestion.

2891
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:47,530
This is gonna be the last game suggestion, guys.

2892
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:49,730
Last one.

2893
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:51,750
Okay, let's see.

2894
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:53,910
Which one should I... Oh, this is gonna be...

2895
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:56,270
This is gonna be scary.

2896
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:59,470
Which last game are we gonna play?

2897
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:01,350
Let's see.

2898
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:04,710
Uh...

2899
02:06:06,050 --> 02:06:06,850
What is this?

2900
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:07,950
Peaks of Yore?

2901
02:06:08,510 --> 02:06:09,490
You know what, Lance?

2902
02:06:10,030 --> 02:06:11,590
Good job for you.

2903
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:13,790
Because this is a game I've never heard before.

2904
02:06:15,550 --> 02:06:16,950
Peaks of Yore.

2905
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,050
What is this?

2906
02:06:19,690 --> 02:06:20,470
Okay, no.

2907
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:26,070
This is my second veto.

2908
02:06:26,090 --> 02:06:27,110
We got another suggestion.

2909
02:06:27,590 --> 02:06:28,230
We can look...

2910
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:30,030
Guys, I'm gonna look for one more suggestion.

2911
02:06:30,290 --> 02:06:31,430
We're not doing Peaks of Yore.

2912
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:32,510
This is veto number two.

2913
02:06:39,490 --> 02:06:39,970
Okay.

2914
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:41,210
Okay, we're good.

2915
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:41,490
Alright.

2916
02:06:41,630 --> 02:06:43,910
Who wants to give me their last game suggestions?

2917
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:45,130
Alright, here we go.

2918
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:51,430
I don't need a try!

2919
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:53,250
It's a climbing game!

2920
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:55,910
I don't need a... Look!

2921
02:06:56,630 --> 02:06:58,510
It's literally a climbing game!

2922
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:01,490
What do you mean I didn't give it a try?

2923
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:03,770
We already have a climbing game.

2924
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,790
We already have a climbing game.

2925
02:07:05,930 --> 02:07:08,270
We don't need another climbing game, guys.

2926
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:10,770
We don't need another one.

2927
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:13,010
What the fuck?

2928
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:14,770
Garfield lasagna party?

2929
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:23,220
Okay, this is... Okay, this... I just need...

2930
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:24,420
Oh, I like how it says Soul Slayer.

2931
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:26,120
This is not multiplayer.

2932
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,300
This is local player.

2933
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:31,580
It's not a veto.

2934
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:36,080
It's more like... It's impossible to play with anybody.

2935
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:39,600
Because it's a local... It's not online multiplayer.

2936
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:41,180
It's local player.

2937
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:44,460
I know because I actually looked it up.

2938
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:49,120
And the reviews were like, oh, you can't fucking play with people online.

2939
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:55,440
Alright, this would be the last game suggestions from Deadpool.

2940
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:04,200
Last suggestion of the day.

2941
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:12,960
Off-climb game.

2942
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,720
Thank you for the super chat, guys.

2943
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:17,600
Thank you, thank you.

2944
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:18,420
What is this?

2945
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:20,280
Is this just an animated trailer?

2946
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:23,720
It's a reverse horror game in which you... Oh!

2947
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,280
What the fuck?

2948
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:28,260
Wait, I think I've seen this game before.

2949
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,180
I think I know what this game... Oh my god.

2950
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,420
You are the spooky monster?

2951
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:38,920
So what's the difference?

2952
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:42,140
Nice.

2953
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:46,760
I consume all.

2954
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:52,150
What?

2955
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:54,070
Oh, he got hit.

2956
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:56,270
Oh!

2957
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:57,730
Oh!

2958
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:02,450
Oh god!

2959
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:06,170
Oh god, where's the gameplay?

2960
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:09,910
Oh, there it is.

2961
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
Can you die?

2962
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:16,710
Wait, they can't shoot.

2963
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:18,730
How do you shoot a blob of mass?

2964
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:20,630
There's no head at that point.

2965
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:23,850
Yeah, it's like the thing.

2966
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:26,910
Oh god.

2967
02:09:28,110 --> 02:09:33,590
It's like... This is like rated... Rated... It's like R18 Super Meat Boy.

2968
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:36,450
Wait, this is!

2969
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:39,890
This is like if Super Meat Boy...

2970
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:44,550
This is... This is if Super Meat Boy went Hollywood.

2971
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:50,550
You are the blob.

2972
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:54,510
If Super Meat Boy sold out and went to Hollywood.

2973
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:58,990
And Super Meat Boy but he eats.

2974
02:09:59,790 --> 02:10:01,330
Mega Meat Boy.

2975
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:03,310
The Netflix adaptation.

2976
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:04,990
Wait, true.

2977
02:10:05,210 --> 02:10:08,210
This is the Netflix adaptation of Super Meat Boy.

2978
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:12,950
Alright, it's a puzzle game?

2979
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:14,310
Why would it be a puzzle?

2980
02:10:14,430 --> 02:10:15,230
I just eat.

2981
02:10:16,710 --> 02:10:17,450
Oh my gosh.

2982
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:19,470
Oh, it's the Editor's Choice Award.

2983
02:10:20,070 --> 02:10:20,590
Nice.

2984
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:21,270
E3.

2985
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:21,970
Rest in peace.

2986
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:23,030
Salute.

2987
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:24,850
Really relaxing game.

2988
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:27,890
Going around eating every human being that you see.

2989
02:10:29,390 --> 02:10:31,150
I hate people in this game.

2990
02:10:31,230 --> 02:10:32,010
Noodle out of sauce.

2991
02:10:32,130 --> 02:10:34,030
Best game I've ever played in my whole life.

2992
02:10:34,450 --> 02:10:35,990
God, I love...

2993
02:10:36,730 --> 02:10:38,190
I'm fucking... Bro!

2994
02:10:38,730 --> 02:10:39,530
Save mine.

2995
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:40,510
Bro, this guy.

2996
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:41,350
New best friend.

2997
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:43,070
The real Super Meat Boy.

2998
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:48,790
I fucking knew it.

2999
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:56,570
I've only played for three hours but it's been mouthful of content.

3000
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:56,910
Wait, what?

3001
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:58,930
Okay, is this... I swear, this is a skill issue.

3002
02:10:59,350 --> 02:11:04,390
The novelty of playing as a monster wears off fairly quickly once you realize there really isn't much challenge overall.

3003
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:08,590
And the level design boils down to finding new few switches to open doors.

3004
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:11,310
More interesting mechanics start to get introduced near the end.

3005
02:11:11,410 --> 02:11:14,510
However, the game as a whole is very short and they don't do much with...

3006
02:11:14,510 --> 02:11:15,830
Is this another skill issue?

3007
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:18,710
Is this another skill issue?

3008
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,830
Um, actually...

3009
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:24,150
Um, the novelty wears off fairly quickly.

3010
02:11:24,570 --> 02:11:25,950
It's not hard enough.

3011
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:28,430
But it gets so boring too.

3012
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:33,790
It's reverse skill issue.

3013
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:35,970
He's actually kinda right?

3014
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:37,310
Nooooo!

3015
02:11:40,510 --> 02:11:43,550
It was... This game is too amazing actually.

3016
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:50,670
Just be worse at the game to enjoy them.

3017
02:11:50,890 --> 02:11:55,810
Either be worse at the game so we can enjoy games again or be better at games so we can enjoy them.

3018
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:56,430
Alright!

3019
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:59,610
And that was our last recommendation!

3020
02:12:01,570 --> 02:12:03,970
Every game recommendation has passed.

3021
02:12:04,290 --> 02:12:09,290
Every game you guys suggested other than the ones I vetoed, um, made it through.

3022
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:11,890
We got... Let's see...

3023
02:12:11,890 --> 02:12:13,970
I know one of my mods was making a list.

3024
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:15,370
Are you still here?

3025
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:16,470
Can you give me my list?

3026
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:18,250
Uh, we approved...

3027
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:22,290
Amid Evil, Brutal Legend, Halo, EDF...

3028
02:12:22,290 --> 02:12:22,610
Oh yeah!

3029
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:24,330
Wait, we have to have a poll.

3030
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:25,270
I almost forgot.

3031
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:29,410
Which version of EDF?

3032
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:33,750
4.1 or 5?

3033
02:12:34,350 --> 02:12:34,910
Alright.

3034
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:36,650
We almost forgot the poll.

3035
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:38,530
Okay, so almost...

3036
02:12:38,530 --> 02:12:39,390
Uh...

3037
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:43,710
Every game that was suggested by you guys made it to the finals.

3038
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:45,050
And won!

3039
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:47,890
So we got EDF, whichever version that wins.

3040
02:12:48,870 --> 02:13:00,630
Gurumon, Prey, Devil May Cry 5, Dragon Ball Z, Sign, A Hat in Time, Space Marine, Project Nexus, Rain World, and Carrion.

3041
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:03,930
And Inscription and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

3042
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:05,470
Oh my god, so many games.

3043
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:10,270
Um, at least I saved money on the Steam sale.

3044
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:12,010
Love saving money.

3045
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:12,790
Hahaha!

3046
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:13,830
Hahaha!

3047
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:15,170
Hahaha!

3048
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:16,870
Haha!

3049
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:17,730
Lads!

3050
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:18,250
Damn!

3051
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:24,490
I can't believe Doki doesn't appreciate the widespread appeal of games without the 1800 Silver...

3052
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:28,670
About the 1800 Silver Age of climbing!

3053
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:34,910
One of these days, I'll find a VTuber who'll play the Scottish Mountain game.

3054
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:36,770
Thank you, Luda Super Chat!

3055
02:13:36,890 --> 02:13:37,350
Thank you!

3056
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:37,950
Thank you!

3057
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:43,170
One of these days, somebody will play my favorite game!

3058
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:43,690
Thank you!

3059
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:45,670
The game about Scottish climbing.

3060
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:50,890
That is like a very, very specific, like, niche you have there, sir.

3061
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:53,430
That is extremely specific.

3062
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:54,590
Hahaha!

3063
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:56,590
Hahaha!

3064
02:13:58,270 --> 02:14:00,590
Someday, you'll find that streamer.

3065
02:14:01,210 --> 02:14:01,890
Someday!

3066
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:04,010
I believe in you!

3067
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:05,190
Hahaha!

3068
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:08,470
He's gonna be on a long search.

3069
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,730
Hahaha!

3070
02:14:10,510 --> 02:14:10,650
Hahaha!

3071
02:14:11,770 --> 02:14:12,250
Alright.

3072
02:14:12,250 --> 02:14:14,130
But yeah, that was really fun, though!

3073
02:14:14,270 --> 02:14:19,710
I had a really great time, like, looking up Steam games with all of you guys and reading the reviews.

3074
02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:21,450
I'm sorry, like, it wasn't...

3075
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:22,150
It was only...

3076
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:22,670
I, like...

3077
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:32,390
I, like, put my cut off at, like, two hours because, like, I wanted to rest a little bit today, so that's why I had to cut the stream to two hours today.

3078
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:35,090
Um, so, like, I didn't do a lot of...

3079
02:14:35,090 --> 02:14:42,230
I wanted to do more game suggestions, but I don't want to overdo it, because I don't want to overdo myself with getting burnt out and everything.

3080
02:14:42,230 --> 02:14:44,830
So that's why I had a little cut off for myself.

3081
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:46,210
Um, anyway!

3082
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:47,990
I hope you guys had a great time!

3083
02:14:48,290 --> 02:14:52,290
I had a great time talking with all of you guys and hanging out and just looking at video games together.

3084
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:55,570
It looks like five is winning!

3085
02:14:55,870 --> 02:15:00,510
So I'm gonna do a countdown for everybody for the last final vote, in which I don't think...

3086
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:08,230
I honestly don't think 4.1 is gonna win looking at these numbers, but I will entertain the thought about giving you guys more time to vote.

3087
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:12,210
So, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

3088
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:15,650
Six, five, four, three, two, one!

3089
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:16,670
And pull!

3090
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:17,930
Yeah!

3091
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:18,830
EDF five!

3092
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:20,310
Win's in the end!

3093
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:27,750
Anyway guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3094
02:15:27,890 --> 02:15:31,230
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it!

3095
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:32,510
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

3096
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:33,850
Bye guys!

3097
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:34,830
Bye!
