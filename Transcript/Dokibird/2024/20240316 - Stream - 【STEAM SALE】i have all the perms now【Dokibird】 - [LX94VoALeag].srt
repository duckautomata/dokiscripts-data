1
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:11,100
welcome to the steam cell yeah hello everyone guys i i just
realized this week i've been fucking up like like on the

2
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:19,320
schedule i get it right but then like every time i make my
waiting room tweet i realize i always keep fucking up

3
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:29,640
daylight savings for like jst and gmt because i I don't pay
a debt I the reason why I keep fucking it up is because I'm

4
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:39,660
lazy and what I do is that whenever I make a waiting room
tweet I just grab an old tweet oh wait an old waiting room

5
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,000
tweet because I'd be like all right I'm streaming at 5 p.m.

6
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,000
let me grab a tweet I made for 5 p.m.

7
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,880
streams and I just go on Twitter copy paste as a template
and I go brother just change the title and the I don't have

8
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,460
to retype the times and I was like wait a minute what is
this doesn't look and then like later I was like wait a

9
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:13,720
minute wait daylight savings is a thing so I've been like I
realized I've been like fucking up the daylight savings time

10
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:26,220
for my waiting room tweet every time for the past week now I
just realized that I was like no My laziness!

11
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,360
Because why would I retype the time when I already have the
time on the waiting room?

12
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,340
I already have like a template for it.

13
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,880
I fucking hate daylight savings time.

14
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,160
It's only invented by like farmers.

15
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,660
Like we don't need daylight savings because we have to
revert it anyway.

16
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,020
That's the fucked up part.

17
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:59,060
Like later on in the year, we're just reverting our like
we're just reverting our change anyway so what's the point

18
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:08,080
let's just live a couple of months like let's just live a
couple of months where like you know the sun shows up later

19
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
than usual who cares global warming is already doing
everything anyway

20
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:25,640
if you think about it we already are getting fucked by
global warming so it doesn't matter savings.

21
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,000
Anyway, Freddy, thank you for the 100 gift of chips.

Do we really need daylight savings?

31

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,740

You only booed me because i'm right the weather is already
fucked we might as well live without daylight savings it's

34
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:17,740

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:29,900
fucking spring like what's going on but yet we have to worry
about daylight savings like but yet the farmers are in

36
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,080
control of the time

Thank you.

45
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,860
Farmers don't even use daylight savings.

46
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,140
It was invented by a politician who thought kids should get
more sunlight.

47
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,120
Oh my God.

48
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,160
That's so outdated.

49
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,220
Like guys, we need to like.

50
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,580
I will run for office and get rid of daylight savings time.

51
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,140
Vote for dokeybird for president in America.

52
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,060
As a Canadian, I will run for office in America to get rid
of daylight savings.

53
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,500
Oh, wait, I should go for Senator first.

54
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,020
I forgot.

55
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Sorry.

56
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
Vote for Adoki to be like mayor.

57
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,040
And then later on, vote for me to be Senator.

58
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
And then don't worry.

59
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,560
I will become the House speaker.

60
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
And then like I'll make sure I will abolish daylight
savings.

61
00:07:50,960 --> 00:08:01,780
because that's the only thing that matters clearly instead
of banning tick tock i will ban daylight savings anyway jl

62
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:09,000
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you actually um
actually yeah daylight savings was invented to save fuel for

63
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:20,040
the war effort during world war two thank you for the super
chat thank you thank you okay sorry i i i just i just need

64
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:30,600
to go through with that because like oh my god i hate
daylight savings so much i really hate it anyway so today we

65
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:42,900
are going to be doing steam cell so how this works uh knows
more politics than the average american i think that's like

66
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:50,780
i think like People outside of America knows more politics,
knows more about American politics than the average

67
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,380
American.

68
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,380
When you live in America, you make sure you know nothing
about American politics because it's, it's, you just don't

69
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,080
want to know.

70
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:07,000
But then the rest of the world, we have to know because
like, everything that happens in America affects the rest of

71
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,300
us.

72
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:16,240
So we're sort of forced to know what the fuck is going on
with you guys in America happens in america like the rest of

73
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,760
us is like we get like partially fucked

74
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:33,640
so that's why everyone outside of america is forced to know
what the fuck is going on because we're too reliant on on

75
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,140
what the fuck you guys do

76
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,380
except for the states you guys have you guys know all your
states we don't care i barely care about my own provinces do

77
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,540
not worry i barely okay maybe that's just a me thing i
barely care about what like the individual things within the

78
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,840
countries so like i don't know where what the fuck my
provinces are let alone what 50 state 50 states i almost was

79
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:09,980
like how many states are in america do you want like an x
amount of states in your country

80
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:25,080
okay i also don't even like i don't even know my own
national anthem i'll just say i know like the partially i

81
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:33,160
remember partially of my own national anthem and it's like
oh canada Our home and native land

82
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,540
And then like Jazz National Anthem

83
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:58,100
Because like when I used to live in Asia Like that shit
would play almost like every fucking day But like it's only

84
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:21,720
that part like it was like but I just remember that like
that's all I could remember and and then yeah that's the one

85
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,300
part I could remember and then but like I know in America
you guys is like what you have to do like the pledge of

86
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:35,780
allegiance every day and also the national anthem them um
every day like is that is that is that true i don't know i

87
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:45,160
just a lot of my knowledge about uh a lot of my knowledge
about like uh like the america about america comes from tv

88
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:54,440
so i don't remember like i just need you guys to know a lot
of the knowledge i know about what's going on in america is

89
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:02,200
from your tv shows so like i i just know like i remember
just watching TV and they're like time to stand up to do the

90
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,200
pledge of allegiance and then I don't even know like I
haven't pledged in years but yeah but that's for school

91
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:18,320
that's what I'm saying for school oh you guys stop now the
TV lies I'm pretty sure like a lot of people like outside of

92
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,360
America learn about what's going on in America via your TV
shows like

93
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,660
the TV version is better than the actual version that's just
life general.

they stopped that a long time ago.

106
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Some schools even enforce it.

107
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,980
And thing about under God, that didn't get added to the
1960s.

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,100
Holy God.

126

I know there's some of you that are on the fence, but I am
not the one that's going to be convincing you on which way

127
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,800

Anyway.

131
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,120
Off to like the The steam at spring you sell.

132
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,160
But it's the only way I will pay attention to politics,
Doki.

133
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,960
It's the only way.

134
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,020
As a Canadian.

135
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,900
Dragoons.

136
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
As a Canadian.

137
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,100
I do not think that that is the right way to go.

138
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,060
Anyway.

139
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,980
Where was I?

140
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,400
But yes, for those who have never done a steam spring cell,
who has never been to a steam, not just a spring cell, for

141
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,680
the steam cell streams before, how this works is that, uh,
how this works is that, uh, also if you guys really do want

142
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,180
to, I would be a terrible, by the way, I'm getting off
track, but like, I would, I would, I would be a very

143
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,080
terrible, like, politician, because I would definitely take
bribes.

144
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:45,600
so like uh like if you're lobbying for anything and you have
enough money i will 100 would take that bribe so please i

145
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:56,700
would be a terrible politician you're like but they already
do take prize anyway here up thank you for the super chat

146
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:09,260
thank you thank you um uh anyway as i was saying uh as i was
saying uh for those who have never been to a steam sale

147
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:19,120
before um uh what we do is that you dragoons would be
suggesting games for me and then uh we're gonna be watching

148
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,820
the trailer we're gonna like read the description together
we're gonna look at the comments section and then you guys

149
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:37,300
actually have the power to decide if if they have a good
game choice so i will be putting up a poll for all of you

150
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:47,200
guys and then you guys vote yay or nay when it comes to
buying uh when it comes to like buying the game so you have

151
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:58,420
like the power if like a dragoon suggests a good game but I
need to also let you guys know suggest games that you think

152
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:09,020
that you think will interest me it might be your favorite
fucking game of all time but is it a dokey game

153
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:25,660
you have to remember is it a donkey game like it could be
the best game in your opinion the best game in the fucking

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,940
chat thank you thank you hello donkey struggling game
developer here Please check out Eden Growl.

156
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,660
Thank you, listen, Richard.

157
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,020
Thank you.

158
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,580
Thank you.

159
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Thank you.

160
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,840
Um, all right.

161
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,620
Maybe I'll do Eden Growl as the, okay.

162
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,840
Oh my gosh.

163
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,520
I see some fucking crazy crashes.

164
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,200
The, all right.

165
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,080
Also, the other gamble is the, the, okay.

166
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,680
So like, now that I'm a streamer, because in the past, you
know, like, like ever, like I was just like you guys, the

167
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,080
Steam Cell would go on.

168
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:15,440
And then all of us would like pick up games and stuff, but
we will only play like one or two games of all the games we

169
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:23,720
buy on the steam cell the advantage of being a streamer now
is that now um especially because it's a single player uh i

170
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:33,260
tend to like stray away from single player games before i
became a streamer because uh uh you know like i just played

171
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:40,060
multiplayer all the time uh because it's like you buy like
200 games and then you go and play fucking out on minecraft

172
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,600
That was me.

173
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,240
That was me.

174
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,180
That was like before Steam Cell was a thing, too.

175
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,120
The Humble Bundles.

176
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,940
I would buy like so... I would like subscribe to the Humble
Bundles because I was like, whoa, look at all the fucking

177
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,960
bargains from the Humble Bundle.

178
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,240
And then I would touch like one of the games from the Humble
Bundle.

179
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,760
Only one of the Humble Bundle games actually interests me.

180
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,000
And then I just like... That was the only game.

181
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,500
I would have like 300, like 100 games from the Humble
Bundles.

182
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,140
And I will only touch like three of them overall.

183
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,000
But now that I'm a streamer, I can like share the games with
you guys But like as in like I'll stream for you guys Not

184
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,380
doing anything legally Not doing any family plan here

185
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:33,340
I meant share Share with you as in you guys live by
curiously through me By watching me play those games So yeah

186
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:43,820
anyway So yeah that is how it's gonna go Let me see what is
the first suggestion The first Oh I am not playing kinuto

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,180
pet.

188
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:51,660
I heard about the the kinuto pet doing doxing shit and also
I was like I uh Goomy played it and I was there on her

189
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,060
stream.

190
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,800
I was in a voice call with her while she played it on
stream.

191
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,360
Oh yeah thank you the super chat thank you.

192
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,020
Thank you!

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,140
Thank you.

197
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,160
Oh yeah I'm trying to see which one to go first.

198
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,640
Which one that like...

199
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,680
Which one I should like...

200
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
Give you guys to vote on first.

201
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,140
There's so many choices to vote on.

202
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,520
The Samurai game.

203
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,660
But that game is so mediocre.

204
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,160
Also.

205
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
I have three vetoes.

206
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,540
No no.

207
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,840
I have four vetoes.

208
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,960
Just so you guys know.

209
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,760
I have four choice chances to veto a game.

210
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,400
If you guys suggest a game that I know for sure that I do
not want to play, I will veto it, but I'll have four.

211
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,160
I can only do it four times.

212
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:51,980
All right.

213
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,480
Okay.

214
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,880
Amid evil.

215
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,760
Fast pace.

216
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,400
Nervous.

217
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,680
Thank you.

218
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,160
Super chat.

219
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,440
Thank you.

220
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,000
Thank you.

221
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,120
I don't think you had prunes.

222
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,020
I think you would love a jockey.

223
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,400
Cheers from a long time fan.

224
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,640
All right.

225
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,620
Let's look up.

226
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,620
Amid evil.

227
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,740
Isn't that the scary one?

228
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,120
Wait, I think I've seen this before.

229
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,260
Whoa.

230
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,040
Have we watched this before?

231
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,960
Oh, it's like, it's like retro, retro boomer shooter.

232
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,760
It has a volume.

233
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,630
Oh my god, you can punch the enemies.

234
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,510
That's not my favorite part because I like to shoot from
the...

235
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,170
I realize, I realize why melee when can shoot.

236
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,910
I can never do...

237
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,390
Oh my god.

238
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,290
I recently was playing Returnal recently.

239
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,070
And like, and like, Returnal is so fucking frustrating.

240
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,730
It's so frustrating.

241
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,630
Holy shit.

242
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,550
I might play Returnal on stream.

243
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,270
Returnal is basically a rogue-like shooter.

244
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,670
And it's, it's like Toho rogue-like shooter.

245
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,690
It's so fucking frustrating.

246
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,610
Hmm.

247
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,890
It's so hard.

248
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,230
the black labyrinth.

249
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,870
Wait, but...

250
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,930
Does he have gun?

251
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,770
Why is it all melee?

252
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,810
Where's this gun?

253
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,710
Amid evil, out now.

254
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,110
Alright, it's time.

255
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,110
It's time.

256
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,890
Where is this gun?

257
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,330
Alright, amid evil.

258
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,710
Yay.

259
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,350
Yay.

260
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:57,490
or nay it's your choice guys you guys get the vote all right
let's see what the oh it's from the same people as dusk and

261
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:04,690
ultra kill i love ultra kill i don't want i'm gonna wait
until ultra kill is finished finished before it's out of

262
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:15,270
like uh beta before we do like ultra kill again uh all right
let's see another low-key game which puts triple a series

263
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:24,450
and publisher to shame That Battlefront Remastered did not
do so well, man.

264
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,490
Guys, did you guys see that fucking battle, the Battlefront
game that was like 75 gigabytes?

265
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,050
That is like, I think that's like bigger than Dead Space
Remastered.

266
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,810
That's actually, how does that get passed?

267
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:44,390
Okay, so like, I saw that they were tweeting out early
access codes too for this game.

268
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,390
So it's like, how did no one complain about it during early
access?

269
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:58,330
like how did no how did no one complain about being like um
so i was trying to download this game in early access and it

270
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:13,410
was 75 gigabytes like how did that not like how did that not
tell anybody that something was wrong wait they did they did

271
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:21,890
and they still did nothing about it i still can't pronounce
the devs I just noticed a medieval pun in the name.

272
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,590
Wait, what?

273
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,450
A medieval?

274
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,050
What's the...

275
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,030
What's the pun?

276
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,990
Okay, let's see.

277
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,930
Definitely not a medieval.

278
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,970
Why is this guy complaining?

279
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,270
You know, I want to see, like, okay, I try very hard to like
this game, but I just couldn't...

280
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,870
Okay, let's find the one negative comment so I can justify
me not buying this game.

281
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:56,150
You know, like, those people, when they try to look at
reviews and they always find like the one the one negative

282
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:04,230
comment and be like look see there's a negative comment that
means i shouldn't buy it and then it's like the one comment

283
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:15,650
the one negative comment out of like hundreds of comments
like there's always one see the game is not perfect why did

284
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:21,430
you guys suggest this game to me look see if it was perfect
there would Not wrecked.

285
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,510
There will be zero negative comments.

286
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,470
I really love this game.

287
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,950
Not recommended.

288
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:27,770
Alright.

289
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,870
I love retro shooters like Quake and Doom.

290
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,250
And I thought I could enjoy this one.

291
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,250
However, I found this game very frustrating for a number of
reasons.

292
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,510
The level design is very irritating.

293
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,290
Hidden paths in the platform.

294
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,290
This guy.

295
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,870
What?

296
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,330
It just seemed like this guy doesn't like retro shooters.

297
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,930
That's basically retro shooters.

298
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,670
Like.

299
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,650
Like what do you mean?

300
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:59,050
hidden paths and the hidden paths that's it based off of
entirely of retro shooters enemies are like flies as long as

301
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:05,830
they stay away from them and use a range weapon so game is
very easy oh i like that oh it's not hard enough okay the

302
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:12,510
movement absolutely sucks the velocity feels so unreal i say
this game might be worth it to try on sale but i wouldn't

303
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,230
pay oh my god lucky for me it's a steam sale

304
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,610
We got a yay on it.

305
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,370
I don't know how much time to give you guys to vote.

306
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,330
I'll just each.

307
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,030
You know what?

308
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,010
It's to my discretion.

309
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,070
So sometimes, sometimes they get, you guys get a lot of
chance to vote.

310
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,290
Sometimes you guys don't.

311
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,090
It's up to my discretion.

312
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,030
Welcome to the Dokiverse.

313
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,090

Yay.

315

Our first game.

316
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:40,970
A medieval.

317
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,790
Medieval.

318
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:42,670
Okay.

319
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,270
I just noticed the, I just noticed the pun.

320
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,230
I just noticed the pun.

321
00:27:51,890 --> 00:28:02,450
medieval brutal legend okay that's the that's the game with
uh jack black right uh red force thank you the super chat

six of my friends so far because i love the game so much uh

is this the one with jack black i remember buying brutal

324
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,010
legends when it first came out on console.

325
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,130
It was like, oh my gosh, I remember by, and then, did I ever
finish?

326
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:30,370
I don't think I've ever finished it, but like, I played up
until, like, a while.

327
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,190
God, it was so long ago.

328
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,750
This game is so old.

329
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,190
It's 20s.

330
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,470
This game was 11 years old.

331
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,870
Jesus.

332
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,990
Oh my God, you can tell it's old.

333
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,890
Oh my God.

334
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,190
Oh my God.

335
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:53,150
I still can't believe Jack Black is going to be in Minecraft
as Steve.

336
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,030
I still can't believe he got casted in Minecraft.

337
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,670
Of all things.

338
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,700
It would be a dream to collab with Jack Black.

339
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,560
What if I like...

340
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,420
Oh my god, what if...

341
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,620
Okay.

342
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,020
I'm going to switch Mr. Man and...

343
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,240
ask him if he could pitch to Jack Black's PR team if he ever
wants to collab with a VTuber.

344
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,300
I will pay for his VTuber model.

345
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
DMCA music?

346
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,840
It's alright.

347
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,640
I mean, fucking Freebirds already DMCA'd.

348
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,620
Oh, they're gonna DMCA this stream.

349
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,960
I just realized!

350
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,780
Fuck!

351
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,300
Okay, whatever.

352
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
I don't need Admiral.

353
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:56,120
revenue on this stream it's okay I don't I don't need add
revenue on this stream guys I don't need it by the way I

354
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,380
still haven't been paid okay I still haven't been paid by
YouTube so like I technically don't have like an income yet

355
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:12,620
uh YouTube side thank God I did have my merch store like to
compensate because I didn't know this but like when you're

356
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:24,440
starting out a channel um you have to make a um a ad revenue
account and like you need like a pin number that they send

357
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:34,140
over via mail and like um like the for so it says in two to
three weeks it would arrive and so let's get ads sent so for

358
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,840
those this is like a little pro tip for you guys because
like obviously this isn't like like obviously it's not like

359
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:50,240
common knowledge because for those who've never been like
monetized on what they do is that to activate your AdSense

360
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:57,460
account you need like a pin number that they send you that's
exclusively for you but the thing about that is that they

361
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:07,800
send it physically to your house or like to like to wherever
you live so like it says like there's no tracking too so it

362
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:19,260
says like it's like two to three weeks it's supposed to get
there and like the thing is So I was like, it's been a month

363
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:29,880
And I still haven't received it So I requested another I
requested them to send it again Because I was like, okay

364
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:37,200
It's been a month now Because I asked like my friends about
it And they're like, yeah, like Yeah, it should take like,

365
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:44,860
it took me like three weeks to get it So I was like, okay
Three weeks is the maximum that I'll wait for it But then

366
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:50,500
three weeks passed And I was like, maybe four weeks weeks
i'll wait four weeks maybe something's going on and then

367
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,720
four weeks i was like okay i should request again

368
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:11,260
so so like so technically i i haven't received any money yet
because like they also pay you at the end of the month so

369
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:22,380
like i was like okay maybe by the time i get my pin number
month but like so then I was like okay I'm just gonna have

370
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,600
request again

371
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:37,140
Scott thank you for the 50 gifted chips thank you thank you
yeah so I'm just like waiting again I'm gonna wait again to

372
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:46,120
see but oh yeah I forgot the vote I thought I had the vote
on guys oh shit did you gift it twice I'm sorry if I didn't

373
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:54,380
see I thought you give uh did you give the hundred oh my god
no it was once okay oh my god no it was once sorry it just

374
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:09,020
bugged out on chat okay brutal legends is voting time okay
brutal legends yay or nay yeah you guys had like so much

375
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,740
time to vote for this um but yeah it's quite like

376
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:28,260
unfortunate indeed but like that means when I do finally
have my AdSense account it would be a it would be like two

377
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:39,420
months worth of payout that's for sure like that's that's a
good thing I get two months of payout by the time I do get

378
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:48,220
my pin uh but yeah it's a little pro tip like don't expect
yourself to get the get like monetized like get the money

379
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:55,820
right away from youtube make sure you have a backup plan
thank god i have a merch store i did not realize like how

380
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:03,840
much money you can make off of merch it was crazy i was like
thank god thank god i opened a merch store alongside of me

381
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,380
coming back here because like that's practically my income
right now That's...

382
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,400
Because, like, I do have the money from that.

383
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,640
Like, it's a good thing.

384
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,100
It's a good thing.

385
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,040
Surgeon, thank you for the super chat.

386
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,680
Thank you, thank you.

387
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,140
First ever super chat.

388
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,500
Might I suggest and shout it?

389
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,560
Thank you for the super chat, Surgeon.

390
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,660
Thank you, thank you.

391
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,260
I really do appreciate it.

392
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,500
Awesome game, what an amazing sound.

393
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,980
I heard they got a lot of, like, old rock bands for the
brutal legend.

394
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:45,500
and metal bands were this um this is like oh my gosh a while
back though uh i'm surprised brutal legends has not been

395
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:54,720
remastered yet because like um you know a lot of game
companies love to bank off nostalgia factor so it's like

396
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,840
very surprising to me that they have yet to like remaster
brutal legends because uh it's dmca central yeah it's dmca

397
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:09,140
because it was a game made before like people stream stream
and stuff but still i feel like i guess like getting rights

398
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:17,220
would be really difficult too yeah you guys didn't know
about music rights um usually for games they only have a

399
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:26,420
license for music stuff for like a specific amount of time
and then after that when the music license expires um they

400
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:34,420
have to like replace the music with something else or they
can never re-release it so like if brutal so like some games

401
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:41,220
and some movies the reason why they don't get remasters or
remixed is because the music license expire and it's so

402
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:49,760
fucking expensive to get the music license that they just
say no they just say they're just like yeah no we don't want

403
00:35:49,760 --> 00:36:01,560
to deal with that it's way too much money it's too much
money to remaster and give this to you what is this i will

404
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:10,420
forever hate this game tried so many times to get it through
uh over the past decade why do you hate this even on easy

405
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:19,100
mode i can't get past the ghost rate part halfway through
there's reason why there's a reason why no one has ever

406
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:25,980
tried a mashup of these styles and game like this since it
just doesn't bro why are all these negative comments they're

407
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:34,260
just shit at video games like anything that's literally a
skill issue i'm sorry mickey for putting you on blast but

408
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:45,140
like what do you mean even on journalist mode i can't get
past the ghost raid part halfway through okay there it is um

409
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:53,460
there it is the one negative comment most helpful would have
been good if it kept the hack and slash but the rts is awful

410
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:00,640
and near the end gets impossible I look, there it is, my
token negative comments of the day.

411
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,400
All right, let's see how long you guys vote for it.

412
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,200
All right, yay!

413
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,900
All right, next, Brutal Legends.

414
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,860

If you look around, you will find the archives.

422
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,780
That's all I can say.

423
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,200
All of my previous stuff I played.

424
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,280
If you look hard enough, you will find an archive of it.

425
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,400
That's all I can say.

426
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,560
That's all I can say.

427
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,280
I will not replay it.

428
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,080

material at this time why not oh okay was i just not old

439
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:19,380
enough like i'm like what do you mean i'm not permitted okay
we can watch the fucking trailer um we don't even need to

440
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:27,040
vote because it's obviously gonna be a yay i i know for sure
you guys are just gonna vote yay for this but i can play

441
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,640
halo now i've never played halo before i've never because i
never grew up with xbox so i have no idea what the fuck halo

442
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,880
really is i don't know the story of halo the most things i
know about halo is red versus blue because of uh rest in

443
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,960
peace rooster teeth uh i can't believe ruby graduated

444
00:38:51,160 --> 00:39:04,420
Weird year There's so many so many like old school YouTube
people are like done with YouTube It's actually crazy Yeah,

445
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:12,820
rest in peace and like Ruby just became like a fucking
Vtuber too They actually became like Vtubers till that it's

446
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,600
been three months.

447
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:20,160
I know it's been three months It's like a lot of like all
the old-school stuff has been like super they've just like

448
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:33,260
either retired quit or or just graduated it's actually
insane to think about yeah Ruby was an official VTuber it's

449
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:45,190
actually interesting too because like obviously we're not
voting for this because we all know that's obviously a yay

450
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:55,490
is there a bad halo game in this collection but the reason
why I've never played an Xbox I I never played Halo before

451
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:05,810
is because Halo was an Xbox exclusive and I've never played
I've never really the only Xbox I own was the Xbox 360 for

452
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:14,290
those who didn't hear the story before they're all good all
of them maybe for the newer the game the worse it gets

453
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:25,790
because money but you guys didn't know I never grew up with
Xbox because my dad's a gamer and he's a sony fanboy because

454
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:39,330
he loves playstation so he's a he's a playstation fanboy so
like when i'm going up we've only owned playstations i never

455
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:49,350
like had a a nintendo console until until like the end of
the game to game cube life uh and i only was able to get it

456
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,670
because it was like for my birthday and i was like begging
for a game cube because i never own a nintendo console

457
00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:03,330
because my dad would be like uh nintendo's for babies i'm
like but i am a baby you know

458
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:15,570
i was like those nintendo's were fucking babies no nintendo
in this house and i'm like but um i'm baby

459
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:28,770
so so i never had a chance so the only time I ever got like
a Nintendo console was the GameCube the moment it was dead

460
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:36,650
like there was no new games coming out so there was a
bargain for that console and I only had two games on the

461
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,110
GameCube because there were no new games coming out and I
didn't know what to buy and my dad was like you can pick

462
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,670
usually you know when you head to like um in Canada it would
be like EB games so my dad would be like you can only pick

463
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:56,730
one game and then obviously I would choose a PlayStation the
really good game the new games come out on the PlayStation

464
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:07,430
so I had to so I was just like so I would pick PlayStation
games versus old-ass GameCube games and the only two games I

465
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:19,410
owned on GameCube was Animal Crossing and um um chat like
the shadow Pokemon games I don't remember what to call like

466
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:29,770
the shadow pokemon games those are the only two games I
owned on the game cube and that was it yeah call it CN and

467
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:37,170
XC sorry three of them because I bought the sequel too I
bought the sequel of the shadow one too so those are the old

468
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:44,610
so yeah I never grew up with an Xbox the only time was Xbox
360 because my dad like wanted to play like some Xbox

469
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,790
exclusive game on the Xbox 360.

470
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,350
And even then, I didn't even, I didn't play Halo.

471
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,730
I didn't play Halo.

472
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,230
Oh, I think it was Gears of War.

473
00:42:53,630 --> 00:43:00,250
Yes, the only reason why my dad bought the Xbox 360 was for
Gears of War.

474
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,210
That was the only time.

475
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,730
That was the only reason why we had it.

476
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,310
And then after that, we never bought an Xbox console since.

477
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,910
It's like...

478
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,530
Anyway, next game.

479
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,990
Sorry, story time.

480
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,370
I'm pretty sure like all the Halo...

481
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,450
Halo, good.

482
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,110
Halo Reach broke me, but Halo 2.

483
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,410
You know what?

484
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,090
That sounds reasonable.

485
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,150
Nice.

486
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,830
Those are good reviews.

487
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,290
Nobody will read my review.

488
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,390
So I'll just say I'm gay.

489
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:45,190
Nice.

490
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,610
The chat is going so fast, they'll never know.

491
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,190
They'll never know, guys.

492
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,150
Oh, shit, our token negative comment.

493
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,090
A wonderful slice of nostalgia ruined by a toxic community.

494
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,850
What does that have to do with Halo?

495
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,630
That just has to do with the fan base.

496
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,670
Like, the developers can't control what's going on on the
fan base.

497
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,770
Like, that's not their fault.

498
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,190
What do you mean?

499
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,970
What do you mean?

500
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:16,950
Also, like, this guy's a pussy because, like, every
multiplayer game has a fucking toxic community.

501
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,110
Like, you can't...

502
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:25,030
Like, the first time I ever queued up for Valorant, people
were fucking saying gamer words to me.

503
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,550
And I was like, what?

504
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,190
And it was the first... And it was on Valorant launch.

505
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,330
Like...

506
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,370
Like, it was the launch of Valorant.

507
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,030
Like, if a game... Game can't control shit.

508
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,750
And the people are fucking toxic on the launch of a game.

509
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,650
It's just always... It's just the Multiplayer Syndrome.

510
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,370
It's just...

511
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,910
It's called competitive multiplayer.

512
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,270
Like...

513
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,830
Alright, let's see.

514
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:58,870
What else?

515
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,090
What else do we have?

516
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:01,910
Doki Good.

517
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,550
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

518
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:03,930
Thank you.

519
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:04,590
Thank you.

520
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,070
It ain't multiplayer.

521
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,270
People aren't salty.

522
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:07,950
Exactly.

523
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,190
What is self-park?

524
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:11,870
It'll be funny.

525
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:12,530
Please, please, please.

526
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,410
Okay, this one doesn't need to be voted on because I 100%
won't play.

527
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:26,470
um the self the was strapped uh the fractured but whole yes
a fractured but whole yeah sorry i've always wanted to play

528
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:32,430
that on stream so don't worry about it i'm definitely not
gonna play the first one i might try to get the australian

529
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:41,910
version just to like not get like it to i don't know if
there's like super controversial jokes in the sequel to the

530
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:51,470
self-park game i like 100 complete 100% complete games
except for the stick of truth the stick of truth might be

531
00:45:51,470 --> 00:46:00,950
the first game I ever 100% it because I really enjoyed that
game but like I played the original game without the

532
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:09,410
Australian censored version because I mean it's smart
because the original game had a lot of stuff in there that I

533
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:22,030
don't know if I can stream it So I feel like, I feel like, I
feel like if there's, if it's very similar, if it's very

534
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:28,430
similar in, in the sequel, I might need the Australian
version.

535
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:38,130
I might need, just maybe, because I don't want to get my
channel flagged.

536
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:40,870
Let's see.

537
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,270
What else?

538
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,730
Let's see.

539
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:54,190
4.1 shadow of new despair trust Liam thank you for the
magenta super thank you thank you all right what is this

540
00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:03,750
earth defense force the only thing i know about this game is
that um it's very popular in speed running communities

541
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:19,770
especially in ag dukey dk df bc edf super scout news It's
time for EDF Super Scout News.

542
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,510
The EDF has been reporting nothing but victories around the
clock for days on end.

543
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,230
As we speak, the battle is entering a new phase.

544
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,310
We'll fill you in on that and give you the latest
information.

545
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,190
EDF!

546
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,870
EDF!

547
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:43,010
Oh, the other... EDF walked so hell divers can run.

548
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,410
Walking Fortress Balam was...

549
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,690
Deployed to oppose the Argynous, giant creatures that
appeared from the ocean.

550
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,010
This dependable powerhouse is mankind's mobile stronghold.

551
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:58,010
And now, equipped with new weapons, it's achieved
perfection.

552
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,190
Look at its power, stronger than ever before.

553
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,130
Well, I could win without it, yeah.

554
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,990
But it helps for sure.

555
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,290
You sound confident.

556
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,650
I love democracy.

557
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,130
Where's the game?

558
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,170
Oh, there's the gameplay.

559
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,310
I was like, where the fuck is the gameplay?

560
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,570
Wait, how many people can play?

561
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,130
There's so many people!

562
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:33,710
The environments, the type and number of enemies, and the
locations in which they appear, can change drastically.

563
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,730
Oh my god, it's the roguelike, because it changes.

564
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,210
There's robots.

565
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,650
I love robots.

566
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,630
Oh, wow.

567
00:48:45,430 --> 00:49:05,330
four okay is this like the best EDF was just because there's
so many something is the best one but anyway yeah things

568
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:13,090
really do look sharp so this is that 1080p everyone's
talking about things look pretty real underground as well

569
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:24,330
and the jankiest edf five is the best why did you suggest
4.1

570
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:37,590
why all right if we do yay or nay we're gonna have you guys
vote for wish edf though it's quality which makes it the

571
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:45,050
best it's the best all right we're gonna have you guys vote
for 4.1 or 5 US officers.

572
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,610
Jesus Christ, this is a nine minute trailer.

573
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,270
We're not watching nine minutes of this.

574
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:51,610
All right, all right.

575
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,990
Clearly, this is a yay.

576
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,170
So I'm going to make another poll.

577
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,950
EDF, which version?

578
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,170
EDF 4.15.

579
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,930
Bro, why is this nine minutes of trailer?

580
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:08,910
What?

581
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:10,930
Holy shit.

582
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:12,710
Oh my god.

583
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,270
Kind of like held 2.

584
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,530
If Helldiver's 2 Wait.

585
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,410
Okay, that's good.

586
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,450
That's pretty good.

587
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,650
Not gonna lie.

588
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,350
Helldiver's 2 servers at max capacity.

589
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,370
So I gotta play the next best thing.

590
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,890
Super fun to play.

591
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,450
Helldiver's 2 if it was...

592
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:39,810
Whoa!

593
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,930
Bro, shots fired!

594
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,110
Bro, he put that review at 5.4 hours.

595
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,610
Bro, how do you know?

596
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,890
Oh, Jesus, if it was good.

597
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,350
Oh, my God.

598
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,550
Bro, that's rough.

599
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,530
I'm going to use the bathroom.

600
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,030
You guys can't watch nine minutes.

601
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,650
Not nine minutes, but you guys can watch more of this
trailer.

602
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:00,830
I'll be right back.

603
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,950
It's in a lifetime chance.

604
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,120
Brent EDF has four branches, and your duties will vary
depending on which one you join.

605
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,140
But right now, in this specific case, the choice is up to
LSTs.

606
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:31,940
Okay, let's take a closer look First the Rangers
thoroughbreds that race across the world Just look at that

607
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,960
stance not an ounce of fat anywhere Look at how fast he
stands up.

608
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:37,760
It's amazing.

609
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:44,280
He doesn't get a head rush as leaders They can heal everyone
who follows them proving that nice guys don't always finish

610
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:53,660
last We'll show you how tough we are Next up wing divers
angels who dance through the skies.

611
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,440
Their flight suits are highly flexible and maneuverable.

612
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,140
Sexy too, but more than that, they're stronger now than
ever.

613
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,200
Perfect in every way.

614
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,140
Don't worry, we're on the same team.

615
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,720
Let's have fun out there.

616
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,040
Air Raiders dominate with their command of bombardments and
airstrikes.

617
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,440
Summon new weapons like Walking Fortress Balam or
Deathcrawler, then climb on in.

618
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,200
Major mounted weapons are now equipped with laser sights.

619
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,800
So even beginners can mow their enemies down.

620
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,480
All units commence operations.

621
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,000
Give them hell.

622
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,540
Finally, the steel giants we call fensors.

623
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,700
Their armor has been reinforced to godly levels and
obstacles mean nothing to them.

624
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:55,440
Their boosters and thrusters can not only increase their
speed, also keep them on balance why is there zero votes

625
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:10,040
what's going on with the poll what did i break the poll why
is there zero votes true democracy because they're both good

626
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:20,740
okay that means you have to buy both of them wait actually i
think five one wait edf okay edf five one okay earth uh

627
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,360
defense Okay, where's five?

628
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,080
Oh, wait, it's on sale, too.

629
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,000
Wait.

630
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:35,540
Recount.

631
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,400
All right, all right.

632
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,180
We'll vote for an EDF again.

633
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,380
We're going to do another vote for EDF again.

634
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,340
At the end of the stream, we'll let you guys vote for, like,
which EDF?

635
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,480
At the end of the stream, okay, guys?

636
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,320
Who said I wasn't just?

637
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,520
I thought 6 was like not out in NA yet.

638
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,160
Okay, I already like EDF 5 more because it's not a 9-minute
trailer.

665
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,140
Massive.

666
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,540
Falcom.

667
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:48,880
What is this?

668
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,940
When did this game come out?

669
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,780
Is this RPG?

670
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,340
This is an RPG.

671
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,080
What the fuck is this?

672
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:30,970
What the fuck?

673
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,970
Okay, I love the faces of the monsters.

674
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,490
Oh my god!

675
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,410
I love those types of faces.

676
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,370
They're so cute.

677
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:44,030
Oh my god, monkey.

678
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,610
We need our monkey.

679
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:51,070
remote back this

680
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:22,020
feels oh this definitely feels like a psp game while
watching this this definitely it definitely feels like a psp

681
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:30,920
game i don't know the thing is it's an rpg game that okay
all right let's that's like the biggest part i see rpg and

682
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:48,340
i'm like i think the last time i've ever played last time
i've ever actually played an rpg game um was was it neo the

683
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:59,160
one from the creators from from level five ah fuck was that
was that what it's called that was the last rpg game i've

684
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:10,980
ever played uh and like no it's not neo sorry oh noita is it
no okay is nino kuni nino kuni yes yes it's about that

685
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:20,800
little boy that's all i could remember the nina kuni and
like this like pig guy that's all and i only played up to an

686
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:29,740
hour and then i gave up the only reason why i tried it is
because i am a level five like fangirl and i i love level

687
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:39,240
five's like animation style and everything and like yeah i
only the that was the last time i've ever played and rpg

688
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:47,380
game because i i could only do one hour of that because i
was just like oh my god this is

689
00:58:51,920 --> 00:59:01,920
i just could i could not i don't i don't see stick of truth
okay not gonna lie i don't see like i know like you guys are

690
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:12,100
like yeah but it's based off of like dungeons and dragons i
i don't see stick of truth as an rpg it transcends rpg like

691
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:26,880
get it no no no no self-park stick of truth is not an rpg it
is beyond that it is a god's gift okay i shouldn't say that

692
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,620
that's actually really fucked up that i said if you play
stick of truth that's so i'm so sorry

693
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,420
Let me rephrase it.

694
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:48,380
The Stake of Truth is like just, it is such a good game that
it has no, it has no category.

695
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:55,900
It has, it is, it is an adventure.

696
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,000
It is like, it is like an experience.

697
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,660
It has no category underneath it.

698
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,320
So, so it's not an RPG.

699
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:24,640
It is an experience I refuse to categorize that as an RPG Oh
wait, I lied Baldur's Gate was my last RPG I just Guys, I

700
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:38,400
couldn't I played Baldur's Gate for like 3 to 4 hours Like
Baldur's Gate 3 I forgot about Baldur's Gate 3 Anyway, the

701
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:46,300
last RPG I played was Baldur's Gate 3, and, um, I just
wasn't into it.

702
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,180
I'm sorry.

703
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,200
I'll say it.

704
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,000
I just not wasn't into it.

705
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:56,540
I know that RPGs is just something that my FPS brain rotted.

706
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:02,880
Like, my FPS rotted brain couldn't, like, couldn't, like,
commit to.

707
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:16,530
it's a really good game I heard it's a really good game I
tried it but my fucking I my brain has already been like

708
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:26,470
rotted from all the FPS games I played that I couldn't sit
down for Baldur's Gate 3 long enough but I but you know what

709
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:35,450
makes me better than some of the other Baldur's Gate 3
gamers I didn't cheese the dice roll I fucking committed to

710
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:49,780
it No matter what, I'm already above some people in Baldur's
Gate Because I didn't reset when I didn't get my dice roll

711
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,860
Like some other pussy

712
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:06,980
Anyway, that's Alright, let's see Originally a Japanese PC
game released in 2004 Oh my god, 2004 I thought that was

713
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:19,600
just a stylistic choice I mean, it makes sense now uh it
makes sense um uh grew in walks a high fire rush crude run

714
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:25,040
oh wait is this like similar to high fire rush i actually
really enjoyed high fire rush that was a nice game i'm glad

715
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:36,240
it won something does somebody else quit right before the
final boss because he couldn't figure out what to do okay um

716
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:43,140
as much as love the old falcom this felt rather uninspiring
seems close to Zelda than other series by the same wait what

717
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:52,180
other series do they do anyway I thought Russia's not an RPG
it's a hack it's like a hack and slash it's more like in

718
01:02:52,180 --> 01:03:01,560
hack and slash than it is an RPG what do they do what are
games are they done I have no idea what any of these games

719
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:18,680
are I have no idea What any of these games are Wait is this
even on Oh it is Four dollars Holy shit It's only four

720
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,300
dollars What the fuck Alright Oh my god Okay

721
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,640
Okay I don't want to use my video on this.

722
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,280
I feel like I could use my video on other things

723
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:48,460
I feel like I feel like I don't want to I don't want to use
my video on this game

724
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:57,000
Alright You know what game I can't wait to play?

725
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,000
Digimon world But the good one is this the good one?

726
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,040
Is this the sequel?

727
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,480
Is this a good one?

728
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,660
Has Ram...

729
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:08,940
No, this is the...

730
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,480
Wait, no.

731
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,560
Actually, wait.

732
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,180
Which one is the remastered Digimon World?

733
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,660
Is it Digimon Sur...

734
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,820
No, which one's the remastered?

735
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,260
Wait, this is not the remastered, right?

736
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,400
There's no...

737
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,380
Okay, to be fair, there was one good Digimon game.

738
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,700
And it was...

739
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,560
Okay, like, as I meant...

740
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,000
Okay, I shouldn't say that because, like, Digimon fans...

741
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:43,660
They're so divided on what is a good Digimon game Because in
Pokemon it's more it's easier to tell what's a good Pokemon

742
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:56,100
game But like in Digimon, it is Digimon fans cannot agree
what is a good Digimon game Because like every Digimon game

743
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:06,940
there's something wrong with it There's something wrong when
they did it every single time it is very divided so no one

744
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:15,860
is gonna actually agree what is considered a good digimon
game because everybody don't know what is considered a good

745
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:25,520
digimon game but personally my favorite digimon game is the
original digimon world but that is because of nostalgia

746
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:31,300
factor and i thought it was on i thought the remaster was on
Steam.

747
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,580
What happened to it?

748
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,060
Wait, what happened to the original Digimon?

749
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:42,680
Wasn't the remaster on I thought the remaster, or was it on
console?

750
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,420
Was it on console?

751
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,760
Or like... No, it came out!

752
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,840
I saw it!

753
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,280
I remember it came out!

754
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,460
It's next order?

755
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,520
No way!

756
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,000
It does not... It's not next order.

757
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:10,080
I know for a fact it's not... It came out on uh on pc
because I saw it I I saw it no I did they remastered the

758
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:21,400
first Digimon was it called Digimon world okay it was like a
PlayStation game it was a PlayStation 1 game and I played it

759
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:34,000
and then and and then they like remastered it and then they
PSP they put it on PSP i'm so sad i'm so sad i thought it

760
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:46,080
was on i thought it was on pc who the fuck uses the psp do
people still use the psp i did not realize the psp is still

761
01:06:46,080 --> 01:07:00,220

still alive like who the fuck who the fuck i'm sorry for

762
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,860
that still owns a PSB.

763
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,000
But like, why?

764
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,140
Why do you go outside and play on the PSB?

765
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,580
I can't stand the PSB's landing.

766
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,820
But the screen is bigger on the PC.

767
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,440
Me with my PSB.

768
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:43,220
speed okay all right i'm sorry i i'm just sad that it's not
released on pc guys okay i'm just look i'm just salty it's

769
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:53,580
not released on the pc okay guys i'll say it i'm sad i wish

thank you thank you highly recommend pray it's

771
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:13,480
with that oh wait isn't isn't this wait do we have a vote
for this before I feel like I feel like we watched this

772
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:30,440
trailer before isn't that the that's the she got you I was
gonna say it I was like I was gonna be like I was gonna be

773
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:39,040
be like wait isn't that with the asian guy but that's like
wait i don't know if i should say that because i was like i

774
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:53,840
was like i was like that being my main takeaway from this
game from the trailer we can fight the invasion if i can't

775
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,500
save us i'm taking every last one of them with me

776
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:10,180
i feel like this is definitely this looks really fun though
i wonder how long it is it looks incredibly long 2017 i miss

777
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:18,900
when games took like more than a year to develop those were
the good old days now it's all about capitalism and dlcs one

778
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:26,960
of my personal favorite games of all time nice uh in a world
of mercia sims praise often labeled a masterpiece one of the

779
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:34,440
greats i wish i could forget the story and play this oh it's
like was it other wilds i'm okay like i was hanging out with

780
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:47,380
some friends and then like i just i was just like i just
like found out about this but um but basically outer wilds

781
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:56,560
there's like a server for people who like who love outer
wilds because apparently um the story is really good in

782
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:05,160
outer wilds that like uh that like people would try to
there's a server dedicated to finding other streamers who

783
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:14,740
are streaming other other wilds so they can live vicariously
through that streamer to re-experience other wilds and i

784
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:24,620
that blew my mind like it's like it's like gotcha viewers
there's like discord servers for like like fans of gotcha

785
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:32,720
games where like they would link streamers that are doing
gotcha polls so they live vicariously through streamers who

786
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,340
are doing polls because they don't want to do the polls
themselves but they want to live vicariously through that

787
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:44,640
streamer and that's why whenever like gotcha streamers do
polls their viewers their viewership like skyrockets really

788
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,620
high because they're like like if their channel gets linked
in those servers like it'll be like an at everyone this

789
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:57,520
streamer is doing a gotcha poll of this game and that's why
like their viewership like skyrocketed high for like

790
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,560
whenever they do polls because they want to live vicariously
through them but not spend the money this is the same with

791
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:09,380
elder wilds and i found this out because i have friends
trying to convince me to stream elder wilds so they could

792
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:12,800
watch my stream and live through me

793
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:25,220
because they're like you're like doki you have to stream
elder wilds i want to watch you play other wilds so like

794
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:33,300
because they're like if i could i wish i could wipe my
memory of this re-experience other wilds and i'm like what

795
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:46,380
the i was like what the fight no i even one of my friends is
actually in one of those outer wilds discords where like

796
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:52,320
they whenever someone's streaming other wilds they they
would like watch that streamer they don't care who that

797
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,980
streamer is they just want to live vicariously through that
streamer

798
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,260
It's actually crazy.

799
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,820
I did not know that.

800
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:11,100
Like, I didn't realize it had the same commute, like, the
same, like, impact that it does for gotcha games.

801
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,700
It's actually crazy.

802
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:14,680
Oh, there we go.

803
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,400
My one negative review cannot disable motion blur.

804
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,360
I like how that is the only negative review.

805
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,040
It's the only negative review here.

806
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,280
Wait, that sucks!

807
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
Wait, I can't disable...

808
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,660
You know, bro, that actually...

809
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,600
That sucks, though.

810
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,700
I cannot disable motion player.

811
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,700
Wait, that fucking sucks, though.

812
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,120
Wait, that actually...

813
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,000
That actually ruins a lot of games for me, not gonna lie.

814
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,820
Literally unplayable, honestly.

815
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:50,720
It's okay.

816
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,400
We're gonna try...

817
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:52,620
Pray.

818
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:53,600
Don't worry.

819
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,880
Lord Corrosus, thank you for the super...

820
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,960
Thank you for the Aka Super...

821
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,840
Thank you, thank you.

822
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,620
Yakuza fan base.

823
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,440
Also, I recommend Yakuza, but it's an RPG, so I will
recommend Devil May Cry 5.

824
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:16,260
The Devil May... Is that the one with the with the Emo Boy
main character?

825
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,440
Oh, no, that's not him.

826
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:27,050
Yeah, I will veto Yakuza because it's like a 100 plus hour
game.

827
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,490
And I don't know if I can...

828
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,610
I don't know if I I can't do that.

829
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:44,710
Oh, good.

830
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:46,810
It's not with the emo boy, Dante.

831
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,200
I love Devil May Cry.

832
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,860
I like how to say I love Devil May Cry, but I've only played
Devil May Cry 1.

833
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,520
It's because I grew up watching my dad play Devil May Cry.

834
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,740
I think I watched him play from 1 to 3.

835
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,320
And I personally played 1 myself on stream.

836
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:52,240
90% yes 10% liars who are the 10% that voted no show
yourself I love the concept I love watching my dad play

837
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:59,300
double may cry the music's really good though I think music
like makes or breaks a game

838
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:22,090
video near because like near is like a near is also like a
hundred plus hour game it's gonna take me it's gonna take me

839
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,470
forever to finish it

840
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:34,780
okay devil make cry is so cool i wish sex was real

841
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:44,060

849
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,580
Over years, I've been stabbed and jabbed by a number of
things.

850
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,180
Proceeds to stab myself.

851
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:04,420
Yes.

852
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,060
Oh my god, this is the first game with zero negative
reviews.

853
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,080
Guys!

854
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,120
It dropped from 90 to 89%?

855
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,680
What the fuck?

856
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,120

857
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,800
What is it?

858
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:23,960
Oh my god.

859
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,600

Okay, here we go.

864
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,600
11% is not motivated.

865
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:37,340
All right.

866
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,320
And that is a yes.

867
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,120

Okay, wait.

873
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,280

01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,440

875
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,360

876
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,820

Why did it let me?

882
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,400
Oh, that's so weird.

883
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,060
Is this a fighting game?

884
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,300
The Dragon Ball game fans deserve a little Dragon Ball.

885
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:39,520
Rest in peace.

886
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:54,340
one of my uncles is a big fan of um the author um is this
but is this like a fighting game or is this it's an arpg

887
01:17:54,340 --> 01:18:03,980
kind of rpg beat him up um and like not just dragon ball but
they basically owned like the whole okay let me i'm pretty

888
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,580
sure this is gonna be a yay up to 90 percent that makes me

889
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,420
as an Asian.

890
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,380
I love sales.

891
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,980
That makes me so happy.

892
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,220
But like, basically, I own...

893
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,340
Not own, sorry, my uncle.

894
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,880
This is the same uncle.

895
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,580
You guys don't remember the story.

896
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:34,940
But this is the same uncle who used to own lots of manga and
lots of like Gundam and everything.

897
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:40,300
And then he got married and the wife told him that he needed
to like get rid of that.

898
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:48,520
We're like, not half, but majority of his collection, it was
that uncle.

899
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:49,680
Anyway,

900
01:18:54,200 --> 01:19:02,040
basically, before he got married, before he got married, I
would like, because like, he used to live with his parents,

901
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,520
and then, like, I would hang out with my grandparents at my
grandparents' place, and I would love to, like, hang out in

902
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:18,460
his room while he's, relax in his room while he was on his
PC doing, I don't know, whatever Otaku weeb shit he was

903
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:18,920
doing.

904
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:30,560
And I would like, I would like hang out, like, I would just
be like on his bed reading his manga collection.

905
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,180
So he had like a huge, like three bookcases filled with like
manga.

906
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,900
And I would like, and it would all be like in Chinese.

907
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:49,060
So I couldn't really read it, but I just love looking at the
um he basically had every single uh manga that uh that kira

908
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:57,420
published every single one of them like the one shots like
all his one shots that were put into manga form all like

909
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:04,460
everything like not just dragon ball but like uh dr slump
and every like obscure was like this one with this vampire

910
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:10,720
boy i don't remember the name of on the top of my head but
there was one with this vampire boy And then there was one

911
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:22,280
with this like fox child or whatever and like every single
one shot he would own He was like a super like Akira fanboy

912
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:27,020
and I would like read I would just read his manga It's not
Sandland.

913
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:27,880
It's not Sandland.

914
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,880
It was a one shot.

915
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,700
It had like 11 chapters, I think It's not Sandland.

916
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:39,100
It was basically like above he had it was like this ghost
fox That was like it's like this like little spirit fox

917
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:46,520
spirit or something thing and it would like and then he has
to save a hundred people yeah is it you have to save like a

918
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:55,600
hundred people to like become a person again and for some
reason that one shot was like stuck in my mind for the

919
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:04,740
longest time and i should reread it too i like um i reread
the manga for that because it was like when i heard about

920
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:12,420
him passing away it just unlocked like a core memory of my
hanging out in my uncle's room and just reading his manga

921
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:23,160
collection i think it is gogo gogo akman yeah yeah um i
would have to force her at the speed of light if my partner

922
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,180
asked me he has three kids together

923
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:33,180
guys they have three kids together

924
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:52,960
anyway um but yeah like i would i i just remember like just
um but yeah he was like a huge like he had every every just

925
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:59,520
everything i just remember he had the full collection of
dragon ball the full collection of dr slump every single

926
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:12,220
manga that he has published he owns it and he was a like
super Gundam builder um I'm I will not be seen the ones who

927
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,680

old yays i remember we yayed this we yay this before

955
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:16,200
because it has a 50 player co-op if you what like modded or
actual what do you do with 50 players and had in time isn't

956
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:35,200
this a platformer game isn't this how is this a 50 player
game how where where do the half the 50 players do I

957
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,720
remember when this game was a Kickstarter game.

958
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,360
The rare moment when Kickstarter games turned out okay.

959
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,860
By the way, I kickstarted that, what was it?

960
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,360
That rhythm game with, like, the boyfriend-girlfriend shit.

961
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:56,380
Fuck.

962
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,160
What was... Friday night Funkin'?

963
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,360
Bro, what the fuck is going on with that Kickstarter?

964
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,000
Like, I think...

965
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,820
Did the devs run away with our money?

966
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:28,320
There hasn't been an update to it In like Fuck a year plus I
feel like Bro did you hear the Did you hear the rumors Did

967
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:36,360
you guys hear the rumors That the dev is out there Fucking
Sipping Coca-Cola Read between the lines

968
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,580
I saw the fucking rumors and I was like what?

969
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,980
I don't know if it's true or not.

970
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,540
I don't know.

971
01:25:54,160 --> 01:26:01,700
I just heard the rumors and I was like, and I looked at the
Kickstarter and I was like, there has not been an update in

972
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,420
a long time.

973
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,560
And I was like, what's going on?

974
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,720
What's going on?

975
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,320
It's not true.

976
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,340
Oh, thank God.

977
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:12,660
Thank God.

978
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:19,660
Because, like, the thing is, there was plausible, like,
there could be plausible truth in it.

979
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:26,220
Because, like, ever since, because, like, a lot of Friday
Night Funkin' came from Newgrounds.

980
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:26,620
Yeah?

981
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:35,940
But the thing is, like, there has been, like, artists and,
like, voice actors that came from Newgrounds that spiraled

982
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,340
hard.

983
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:48,200
So I was like, I was like, okay, there could be like
plausible truth because of the, because due to, due to like

984
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,360
past experiences with other creators on Newgrounds.

985
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:05,500
So I couldn't, I was, okay, I have a lot of my humor and a
lot, like you can tell that I was a Newgrounds kid due to my

986
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:05,980
humor.

987
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,040
I grew up on Newgrounds.

988
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,860
Like, it's super fucking wild.

989
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:15,360
But, like, I didn't grow up on that side of Newgrounds.

990
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,060
There's, like, two sides of Newgrounds.

991
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:22,200
The one that's there for obvious, like, R18 shit.

992
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:28,620
And the other side that really enjoyed the games and
animations that were not those.

993
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,720
Like, so...

994
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,000
So, um...

995
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,460
So, is that Eagle Raptor?

996
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,820
Um, first time reviewing a game.

997
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,220
Got a cat here.

998
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,380
Friends passing by.

999
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,900
You can touch him and click like to pet him once.

1000
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,420
This game is good.

1001
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,320
Play it now.

1002
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:56,500
The best 3D platform I played in a long time.

1003
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,920
The thing is, there hasn't been like a lot of...

1004
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,220
Like, 3D platformers are not the meta anymore.

1005
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,700
So, there hasn't been a really...

1006
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:05,660
Uh, like, uh, like...

1007
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:14,300
platformers in general um you're a henry's no i was like
more of the edgy ones like i'd like the you know like the

1008
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:28,200
the tank man and um back when ego raptor actually animated
stuff i was like so hyped for any like ego raptor animations

1009
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:39,500
that would come out and also like uh obviously i shouldn't
be watching those things back then and uh and then also like

1010
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:47,440
uh was it alice the alice return the alice games i remember
very fondly of i don't remember the what the game was called

1011
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:56,920
the alice schemes and uh and then obviously like alien homin
like castle crashers when it was a new grounds game and

1012
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:03,640
there's a lot of i just i remember like snippets of stuff
and then all the animation oh ed's world too that was on new

1013
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:11,860
I remember when I saw a YouTube channel when he was like
talking about like his hospitalization and stuff and I was

1014
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:20,280
like oh my god I was like like as a fucking that would gave
me like trauma Because I was a kid I like seeing that on

1015
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:30,300
YouTube like I was like holy shit like as a kid seeing that
um No, no, it's like a new grounds game.

1016
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,700
It's not American McGee's Alice great game, too.

1017
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:40,620
I wish there was a sequel like I wish they made more because
I really enjoyed the lore and the art direction of Alice.

1018
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:52,080
But, like, honestly, I heard, like, American McGee is very,
as a developer.

1019
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,880
I'm trying to put this nicely.

1020
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:00,840
Like, like, like,

1021
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,820
I'm trying to figure out a way to put this nicely.

1022
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,640
Oh, yeah, Alice is dead.

1023
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:18,900
Alice is dead.

1024
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,180
That's a good game.

1025
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,160
That's on Newgrounds.

1026
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,180
Like, that's a good game.

1027
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:24,360
But he...

1028
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,060
A bit of a diva, I would say.

1029
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,780
A bit of a diva.

1030
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:34,960
Let's see.

1031
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:36,860

Hadden Tom.

1034
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,220
That passes.

1035
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:44,900
Let's see.

1036
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,120
What else?

1037
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:48,920
What else?

1038
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,740
What else do we have?

1039
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,380
What about Space Marine?

1040
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:54,420
Uh, Imagina.

1041
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:55,420

Be a big ass armor guy crushing Zenos.

1045
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,840
Also, you should check bulk gun again to finish the job.

1046
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,160
Okay.

1047
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,280
Space Marine.

1048
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:14,140
Ghost trick I wouldn't vote for it because honestly Ghost
trick I really want to play on my I really want to play it

1049
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:20,540
in the future So we don't need a vote for that What's this
the retro 2011

1050
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:28,440
I wish Gears of War was an Xbox exclusive or Microsoft
exclusive

1051
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:38,440
OG I can't wait for the sequel The sequel looks really fun.

1052
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,620
One force can halt the annihilation of mankind.

1053
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:48,300
The Space Marine.

1054
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:57,660
Weapons of steel.

1055
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:01,890
For the Emperor!

1056
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:03,790
Brothers!

1057
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,510
Brothers!

1058
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:15,250
I have known nothing about Warhammer except for the Space
Marines.

1059
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:26,130
I feel like Every, like all the normies outside of the
space, like the Warhammer, the Warhammer fandom only knows

1060
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,910
about the fucking Space Marines.

1061
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:31,070
I don't know anything else about this game.

1062
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,270
About the lore.

1063
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:34,990
We are Space Marines.

1064
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:39,050
Brothers, I am war.

1065
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:45,270
Brothers, I can play this now, brothers.

1066
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:46,870
Wait, what?

1067
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,030
This game is crap.

1068
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:59,210
like wait what i scroll down the first nick the first review
this game is great but what the fuck is this 60 for a decade

1069
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:09,270
plus old game that's simply bundled together with dlc
there's nothing new in this anniversary edition raised up

1070
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:15,670
price like a greedy mega corp just before i released a space
marine too pathetic

1071
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:32,730
bro look at him didn't wait for this what the fuck 80% up
look at this guy didn't wait for that steam sale bro

1072
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:42,450
literally could have waited a month later he's not a brother
the fool look at him

1073
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:59,490
gonna say like that's just the nintendo way like that's but
when nintendo does it no one gives a about it or they're

1074
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:13,470
just too scared to complain i'm too scared i'm honestly too
scared to play nintendo games on youtube i might need to ask

1075
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:19,890
my manager how how to avoid how to avoid angering Nintendo.

1076
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:25,370
Like, on Twitch, on Twitch, it's easier.

1077
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:33,990
Because, like, the reason why, like, Nintendo, like, people
can stream Nintendo games very easily on Twitch is because,

1078
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:43,230
like, the streaming policies on Twitch is a lot, like, like,
you can't really, like, copyright strike people on Twitch

1079
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:52,990
regarding, other than music, for game-wise, it's like almost
impossible to do on twitch but like on youtube it's

1080
01:34:52,990 --> 01:35:06,330
obviously a lot of people like to abuse that system unless
yeah unless like you have like you have to sign up to

1081
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:13,410
something because i remember like a long time ago i remember
reading about this that like you can like sign up to be like

1082
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:21,350
a official nintendo content creator or something on on
youtube but you need to like apply for it or something like

1083
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:27,750
that so they won't like automatically like strike your
videos when you're playing nintendo games um and that's for

1084
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:35,990
like outside of like outside of japan so like i don't know
if that's still a thing i just need to ask mr man about it

1085
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:45,110
so i don't know if the partners program is still a thing for
people uh in uh people in NA so I don't know it's not so

1086
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:54,690
like I don't know like the thing is I don't want to piss off
Nintendo it's not I don't know I'm not updated in like the

1087
01:35:54,690 --> 01:36:04,410
new shit of what Nintendo wants now so like I need to see
it's no longer a thing okay all right um but even then I

1088
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:13,490
need to make sure that everything is okay when it comes to
me streaming Nintendo games on YouTube I'm Nintendo is like

1089
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:19,430
one of the I don't Nintendo is like one of the only
companies that I'm scared of when it comes to like game

1090
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:28,110
permissions every other like because like every other time
um through like history whenever like any other company but

1091
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:35,230
Nintendo like try to strike somebody on YouTube it turns
into huge news and stuff because people would be like whoa

1092
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:45,250
that's a little extreme so no companies want to risk that
and stuff because like it just gives negative publicity but

1093
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:56,850
like nintendo wise is the only company i'm scared of when it
comes to game programs with things like that so that's why

1094
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:07,530
i'm not risking it like i need to make sure i am safe when
it comes to nintendo games um but also like imo there's like

1095
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:16,810
not really a lot of nintendo games i would want to like
actually stream um because like uh um i'm not like i don't

1096
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:22,890
know there's like i'm not like i didn't grow up with
nintendo so i don't have the huge nostalgia factor playing

1097
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:30,990
in on anything and the only thing i like about pokemon is
like the og like i'm not a fan of the new pokemon series

1098
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:37,110
other than the legends stuff they've done but like because
legends was like new it was like a new way of doing pokemon

1099
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:44,890
um But other than that, I didn't grow up with nostalgia for
Nintendo games because I didn't grow up.

1100
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:49,830
Like, my dad didn't let me play Nintendo games because I
didn't have consoles for it.

1101
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:57,210
So I literally have zero nostalgia for Nintendo.

1102
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:08,170
So like, whenever like a new Nintendo game comes out, I'm
not like, like it doesn't really affect me too much type.

1103
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:18,530
deal uh i prefer crash bandicoot uh racing game versus the
mario kart i honestly think the crash bandicoot racing game

1104
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:32,970
is better than mario kart for me like after playing both of
them i like the crash bandicoot one more yeah the dad moves

1105
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:45,470
too strong um let's see all right space marine that is a yay
i feel bad for the first person who gets the name i'm so

1106
01:38:45,470 --> 01:39:03,470
sorry if you're in the first one uh let's see uh uh uh uh uh

Thank you.

1134
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:37,590
Rain World is a 2D survival platformer where you are the
prey animal in a simulated ecosystem.

1135
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:39,870
The other wilds is a 3D...

1136
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:42,430
Okay, other wilds, I'm definitely going to do it in the
future.

1137
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,330
Due to peer pressure.

1138
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:49,550
Due to peer pressure from my friends.

1139
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,110
So, like, don't worry about that.

1140
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:52,370
That you don't need to vote.

1141
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,310
Okay, Rain World.

1142
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:02,100
Let's see.

1143
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:06,870
What is this?

1144
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:11,630
You're a nomadic slug cat, both predator and prey, and a
broken ecosystem.

1145
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:16,710
Grab your spear and brave the industrial waste, hunting each
food to survive.

1146
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:17,490
But be wary.

1147
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,870
Other bigger creatures have the same plan.

1148
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,550
And slug cats look delicious.

1149
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:23,750
It's like jelly.

1150
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:28,210
You'll suffer in this platformer.

1151
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,350
That's the trailer?

1152
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:31,510
Does it just end like that?

1153
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:33,990
Oh, I guess it's like gameplay trailer.

1154
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:36,930
I was gonna be like, wait, what the?

1155
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:38,450
It just ends.

1156
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:40,950
It just ends.

1157
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:45,970
Where's Predator?

1158
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,320
I'm mad that Mark.

1159
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,160
Okay, how long is this game, though?

1160
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,660
It might be a reason why you didn't finish it.

1161
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:03,840
Because, like, for...

1162
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,040
Okay.

1163
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,600
Variety streamers.

1164
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:09,260
Here's, like, a little streamer tip for you guys.

1165
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:20,460
is that unless you're like you're like a certain focused
gaming stream like in terms of like your focus on like a

1166
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:30,240
certain genre for variety streamers there is a limit on like
how they think is like viewer retention and at point because

1167
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:39,340
in the past let's plays were very common it's very common to
do let's plays but streamer meta has evolved to the extent

1168
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:48,860
where like if you're a streamer um you can't you can't do
long let's plays anymore or you have to do edited content uh

1169
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:56,120
because like so unless you're like a heavy focused genre for
a specific genre you can get away with that but you're in

1170
01:44:56,120 --> 01:45:05,160
variety streaming longer gameplay playthroughs are now not
meta anymore so so it's like obviously the more you play the

1171
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:15,160
same game uh the more you play the same game the the
multiplayer multiplayer obviously the multiplayer games it's

1172
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:23,140
like competitive and stuff but you're playing if you're a
variety streamer uh it's harder to keep up so like for me my

1173
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:31,980
i've learned that my hard limit for like for like uh long
playthroughs is three to four three to four streams usually

1174
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:39,320
that's the average so like my goal is to always complete a
game within three to four streams because that is like the

1175
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,820
viewer retention and everything.

1176
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:47,200
So it's like, you gotta figure out like what is your like
hard limit when it comes to like longer playthroughs of

1177
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:56,740
streams because when you play the same game for a very long
time, people will like eventually get super bored of it.

1178
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:00,420
And that's like the biggest issue of being a variety
streamer.

1179
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:04,680
Let's see.

1180
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,220
I wish somebody would make a world of rain.

1181
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:21,380
It's because it's because short form content ruined us like
tick tock and YouTube like like tick tock and YouTube what

1182
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:34,240
the it's fun to die over and over and over and over and what
the fuck But yeah the tick tock and YouTube shorts basically

1183
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:36,340
brain rotted a lot of people

1184
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:50,140
um there is no other game to my knowledge that does what
rain world does there's no other game that can create an

1185
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:56,060
environment this alien alive and what the fuck are they is
it playing the same thing again oh i didn't pause it i was

1186
01:46:56,060 --> 01:47:03,940
like what the fuck am i listening oh yeah if you're more of
a casual gamer do not recommend it i grew up gave up after

1187
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:16,660
barely getting a third of the story on easy mode what bro
wait no he didn't he kept playing so this liar oh oh there

1188
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:24,840
we go there you go the above paragraph was what was eight
hours now after 40 hours i beat the game in easy mode but

1189
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:33,620
cheating sometimes by using the warp mod because the game
got on my nerves bro this man modded his game so he can

1190
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:43,880
finish it faster on easy that's not a casual gamer that's
journalism mode i'm so sorry if you're watching the stream

1191
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:51,760
um but like you gotta accept that like that's not being at
that point like you're not a casual gamer at that point

1192
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:56,180
that's like actually like like you're below casual gamer

1193
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:10,860
the fun i had playing it in some parts was offset by
frustrations that adds nothing to the game in my opinion i

1194
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:16,680
would have loved the game if it was like katana zero where
the checkpoint is at every screen or something of the sort

1195
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:21,680
the problem is not having to deal with a challenging
situation the problem is having passed all through the easy

1196
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:26,300
part you already passed so that you face the challenge again
bro this guy should never play a souls game

1197
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:41,880
okay uh let's see oh i played call of horace before said
thank you for the magenta super thank you thank you we

1198
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:49,400
played it before um like i said before um you guys didn't
know i played these games before you can there if you look

1199
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:55,580
hard enough you'll find an archive you look hard enough
You'll find an archive of it.

1200
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:00,460
Let's see.

1201
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,060
Shark, thank you for the super chat.

1202
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,080
Thank you, thank you.

1203
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:06,480
Bomb Rush Cyber Funk.

1204
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:09,920
Really fun gameplay and amazing aesthetic.

1205
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,280
All right, here you go.

1206
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:13,840
Let's see.

1207
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:14,820
What is this?

1208
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:16,040
Whoa.

1209
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:17,620
Whoa, this music.

1210
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:22,220
Wait, is this a spiritual successor of...

1211
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:24,540
What was it?

1212
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,400
This is a spiritual successor.

1213
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:29,540
Oh, Justin Radio!

1214
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,000
Yes!

1215
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:30,980
Justin Radio!

1216
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,900
This is basically like Justin Radio.

1217
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,520
I've always wanted to play Justin Radio.

1218
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:52,970
I wish there was a remaster of the rapping game.

1219
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:54,430
What was it?

1220
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:55,410
Paparapa?

1221
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:57,510
I forgot his name.

1222
01:49:57,650 --> 01:49:59,930
I didn't grow up with that game, but I've always wanted to
play it.

1223
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:05,440
Loud.

1224
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Okay.

1225
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:12,000
I wish they did a remaster of that.

1226
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:17,770
I've never played it.

1227
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:19,250
I've always seen memes about it.

1228
01:50:19,890 --> 01:50:23,770
And by that, I meant the one that I remember is the one with
Batman.

1229
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:26,270
This is where my parents died.

1230
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:31,210
Alright, let's see.

1231
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:32,230
What are the reviews?

1232
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,650
Exploring 5.

1233
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:42,330
spots and get the rep you'll need to challenge the rival
crew is this skateboarding oh yeah it is skateboarding this

1235
01:50:55,030 --> 01:51:02,170
game with mods i know people judge me for this but i only
ever bought this game because i saw someone playing as sonic

1236
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:09,970
i thought that was incredible a real thing made me happy and
the fact that i can add my okay there's even multiplayer

1237
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:20,330

1240
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:40,190
What the fuck does BRC toilet mean?

1241
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:43,690
Better toilet?

1242
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:47,110
Why is there a toilet function?

1243
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:56,210
My favorite Sonic model is the 06 model pack.

1244
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:00,490
It has a tendency to crash games.

1245
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:04,590
I don't think it's this mod that has a tendency to crash
games.

1246
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:07,250
all of this

1247
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:18,410
I like how he's like yeah by the way this mod tends to crash
games I'm like no!

1248
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:20,810
Look at all these mods you have!

1249
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:27,730
Holy shit!

i'm gonna i'm the reason why i haven't played hollow night

1256
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:41,410

like i've always wanted to play it hollow night is like one

1258
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:56,370
of those games that even though i know it's like a super
long game it's like i'm honestly like super curious but i

1259
01:53:56,370 --> 01:54:07,270
honestly sort of want to wait for silk song wait what do you
mean it's not wait what What do you mean?

1260
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:08,890
What do you mean it's not coming out?

1261
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:11,450
There are so many trailers!

1262
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:13,410
What do you mean?

1263
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:18,230
Don't say that!

1264
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:20,790
There are so many trailers!

1265
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:22,490
Every...

1266
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:25,170
Don't come out!

1267
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:27,170
No!

1268
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:31,570
Brennan, yes!

1269
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:34,430
But that's what you know is a good game!

1270
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:37,730
That's when you know, guys!

1271
01:54:38,050 --> 01:54:39,670
You just gotta believe!

1272
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:51,170
Guys, guys, we don't want it to be like all the other one
fast track games.

1273
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:58,970
Don't worry, I will wait a hundred years for the sequel.

1274
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:02,450
For a game I've never played before.

1275
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:19,870
the sequel of a game I'll never play 300k reviews that's
actually honestly I'm curious I'm curious who fucking gave a

1276
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:26,730
negative review like it's oh wait there's a guy right now
obviously I'm not far enough in the game though I still love

1277
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:34,410
the art style I find the game far too okay is it all the
negative reviews just skill issue you are but grim is hot

1278
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:53,530
silk song okay so song is a lie okay um i don't know what
the negative reviews are for this okay negative that's like

1279
01:55:53,530 --> 01:56:03,230
9 000 our official all of this are like What even infected
my dreams?

1280
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:06,070
Don't buy it if you have in Kingdom.

1281
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,850
Map system sucks.

1282
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:11,650
What the fuck?

1283
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:13,530
Sex the Hornet.

1284
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:17,130
Stop looking at negative reviews and buy this game.

1285
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:23,230
I love how like, uh, good game I just have skill issue.

1286
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:27,090
All of the negative reviews are just like skill issue.

1287
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:29,050
I'm not good enough for this game.

1288
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:31,770
He knows.

1289
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:33,850
He knows.

1290
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:38,810
Garlics, thank you for the magenta soup.

1291
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:39,310
Thank you.

1292
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:39,890
Thank you.

1293
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:42,070
Don't wait for Silk Song.

1294
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:46,170
Hollow Knight is one of the best Metroidvania games ever
made.

1295
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:48,130
If not the best.

1296
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:52,930
Nobody who enjoys Metroidvania-style games should go without
playing it.

1297
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:55,290
Bro, this guy, I bet you, this guy.

1298
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,470
This guy was the one that wrote this review.

1299
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:58,890
Silk Song is the one.

1300
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:17,730

inscription it's one of my favorite games and it's one game

1303
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:37,830
of the year when it came out like deck builder is that like
this wasn't there like a new like roguelike card game that

1304
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:49,610
came out as well i don't remember what it's called um it is
uh what was that game called the newest one i almost said

it was so similar Who the fuck is this guy that's streaming

1306
01:57:58,930 --> 01:57:59,430
it?

1307
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:01,270
And it's not me.

1308
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:05,750
Let's see.

1309
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:07,150
Um.

1310
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:09,230
What was it?

1311
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:11,690
Balaltro?

1312
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:16,580
I've heard about this game.

1313
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,640
This game was like a streaming meta game.

1314
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,560
Uh, when it came out.

1315
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:25,080
Inscription.

1316
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:27,700
Yeah.

1317
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,340
What the fuck?

1318
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:41,790
Yeah, I heard like the Laotro seems to be like a really fun
game.

1319
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:44,850
I've seen a lot of people playing it when it came out.

1320
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:47,150
I don't know what it really is, though.

1321
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:49,870
I've never really been like a card game player.

1322
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,010
I have no idea what to do.

1323
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:55,410
Like...

1324
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:57,630
Because it requires a lot of reading.

1325
01:58:58,350 --> 01:59:00,150
And a lot of like using your brain.

1326
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:03,450
Which is honestly like one of my negative traits.

1327
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:17,710
um not the reading part i can read but just i can read by
the way it's more so of of the uh it's more so the thinking

1328
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:28,470
part uh let's see i actually don't know how to play poker i
watched my dad play poker my dad would play like this um

1329
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:35,590
after um like he would play those like oh my gosh if you
lived in Asia you would know those card games like the one

1330
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:44,050
with the like the online it's not like it's like Chinese
online poker where like there was like avatars and stuff and

1331
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:49,970
you can like dress up your little avatar it was like a blue
background and then you can like dress up your avatars and

1332
01:59:49,970 --> 02:00:01,830
stuff like it was like Gaia online and I would just watch
him play that game and and then like the more money you win

1333
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:08,250
the more you can decorate your avatar and it was so because
like it's like a point like you don't win real money but it

1334
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:16,590
was like point system and stuff no it was poker it was like
it was so funny so like you didn't tell like who doesn't

1335
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:23,450
have money because they're naked they will be on their
underwear and then and then like my dad was like super

1336
02:00:23,450 --> 02:00:24,570
decked out

1337
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:36,650
it was like super decked out with like and everything and
there's like cutscenes there's like animations if you win

1338
02:00:36,650 --> 02:00:37,630
the game

1339
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:53,140
that's so dumb um let's see why are you reading this just
play it and play along he turned the computer into a

1340
02:00:53,140 --> 02:01:01,500
funniest shit I've ever seen surpassed all my expectations
go in blind don't look anything up one of the games I played

1341
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:05,420

Thank you, thank you.

1342

Oh, okay.

1343
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:11,440
It seems like you have to go in line for this.

1344
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,700
It seems like a cool game.

1345
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:20,560
But just me learning the basics makes my head hurt.

1346
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:21,180
Head hurt.

1347
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:21,840

1348
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:23,180

02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,180
That's going to be me.

1350
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:27,140
0.3 hours refunded.

1351
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,200
That's going to be me, guys.

1352
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:33,680
That's going to be me.

1356
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:00,220

1357
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:04,620
What else?

1358
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:08,180
I'm looking at, like, indie game suggestions.

1359
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:10,800
Gee, thank you for the magenta soup.

1360
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:11,400
Thank you.

1361
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:11,920
Thank you.

1362
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:13,540
King of the castle.

1363
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:17,180
It has Twitch integration so you can play against all the
dragoons in the chat.

1364
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:22,000
You play as the queen while all your chat are backstabbing
nobles trying to dethrone you.

1365
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:24,140
It's only, like, seven bucks.

1366
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:24,640
Okay.

1367
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,140
What is this?

1368
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:28,580
What the fuck is this?

1369
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,800
It's not fair.

1370
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,840
You're all just gonna fucking dethrone me.

1371
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:41,480
fair what could go wrong in telling these ice warriors i'm
their king like why would i play this with you guys you're

1372
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:46,700
all just gonna try and like sabotage me it's not even gonna
be a question

1373
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:56,380
that's the idea

1374
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,400
god that's a lot of politics

1375
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:23,050
we would never how could you say that about us is that i
don't know what's going on i don't know what's going on in

1376
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:32,490
this game in king of the castle you wear the crown make
difficult choices that will bring your kingdom into

1377
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:45,410
prosperity or chaos of course you won't be ruling alone
Wait, only three people.

1378
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:52,550
I thought it was like, oh, unless like the Twitch
integration can be like one person.

1379
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,270
I'm too dumb for this.

1380
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:58,650
Don't worry, Doki.

1381
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:01,270
Thank you for the super chat.

1382
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:02,150
Thank you.

1383
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:02,370
Thank you.

1384
02:04:03,730 --> 02:04:04,210
Thank you.

1385
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:10,410
Once they've joined the game, they will vote on your
decisions and provide you with...

1386
02:04:10,410 --> 02:04:11,830
Oh, you can do teens.

1387
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:25,130
or at least you hope so more likely they'll scheme to take
the throne for themselves king of the castle wishlist now

1388
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:32,110
all right what are the comments your majesty there's no such
thing as absolute powers and what's the point what's the

1389
02:04:32,110 --> 02:04:39,910
what's what's the point then it really depends who you're
playing with the nobles have to be really into the screen

1390
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:45,910
and commit it i think nobles need a little more to do more
magic more intrigued it's a nice party game but stay away we

1391
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:52,950
have a wide screen or ultra wide screen okay i got murdered

02:07:12,710 --> 02:07:13,150
What the fuck?

1419
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:15,050

how it says so it's like.

1421
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:26,420
This is not multiplayer.

1422
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,480
This is local player.

1423
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:31,780
It's not a veto.

1424
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:42,080
It's more like it's impossible to play with anybody Because
it's a local It's not online multiplayer It's local player I

1425
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:51,380
know because I actually looked it up And the reviews were
like Oh you can't fucking play with people online Alright

What is this?

1432
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,520
Is this just an animated trailer?

1433
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,720
It's a reverse horror game in which you...

1434
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:25,520
Oh, what the fuck?

1435
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:28,440

1440
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:41,980

A Super Meat Boy sold out and went to Hollywood.

1450
02:09:56,950 --> 02:09:59,290
And Super Meat Boy, but he eats.

1451
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:01,490
A Mega Meat Boy.

1452
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:03,910
The Netflix adaptation.

1453
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:05,250
Wait, true.

1454
02:10:05,590 --> 02:10:08,430
This is the Netflix adaptation of Super Meat Boy.

1455
02:10:11,730 --> 02:10:13,190
Alright, it's a puzzle game.

1456
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:14,450
Why would it be a puzzle?

1457
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:15,450
I just eat.

1458
02:10:17,570 --> 02:10:19,790

Salute.

1462
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:28,150
Really relaxing game going around eating every human being
that you see.

1463
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:31,270
I ate people in this game.

1464
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:32,210
Noodle Elder Sauce.

1465
02:10:32,370 --> 02:10:34,270
Best game I've ever played in my whole life.

1466
02:10:34,870 --> 02:10:35,890
God, I love.

1467
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:36,790
Yes, look.

1468
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:38,570
I'm fucking, bro.

1469
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:39,850
Same mine.

1470
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:40,670
Bro, this guy.

1471
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:41,550
New best friend.

1472
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:43,210
The real super meat boy.

1473
02:10:47,170 --> 02:10:58,190
I fucking knew it I've only played for three hours but it's
been mouthful of content wait what okay is this I swear if

1474
02:10:58,190 --> 02:11:03,450
this is skill issue the novelty of playing as a monster
wears off fairly quickly once you realize there really isn't

1475
02:11:03,450 --> 02:11:09,650
much challenge overall and the level design boils down to
finding new few switches to open doors more interesting

1476
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:14,990
mechanics start to get introduced near the end however the
game as a whole short and they don't do much with this is

1477
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:26,350
another skill issue is this another skill issue um actually
um the novelty wears off very quickly it's not hard enough

1478
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:28,670
but it gets so boring too

1479
02:11:32,330 --> 02:11:43,970
it's reverse skilled issue he's actually kind of right no It
was this game is too confusing actually

1480
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:54,950
Just be worse at the game to enjoy them Either be worse at
the game so we can enjoy games again Or be better at games

1481
02:11:54,950 --> 02:12:04,830
so you can enjoy them Alright and that was our last
recommendation Every game recommendation has passed Every

1482
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:09,650
game you guys suggested other than the ones I vetoed Made it
through.

1483
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:11,790
We got, let's see.

1484
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:14,210
I know one of my mods was making a list.

1485
02:12:14,730 --> 02:12:15,590
Are you still here?

1486
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:16,630
Can you give me my list?

1487
02:12:17,470 --> 02:12:18,310
We approved.

1488
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:19,310
Amid evil.

1489
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:20,250
Brutal legend.

1490
02:12:20,730 --> 02:12:21,150
Halo.

1491
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:22,270

1492
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:22,770
Oh yeah!

1493
02:12:22,930 --> 02:12:24,490
Wait, we have to have a poll.

1494
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:25,450
I almost forgot.

1495
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:29,570
Which version of EDF?

1496
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:34,090

1497
02:12:34,570 --> 02:12:35,110
Alright.

1498
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:36,810
We almost forgot the poll.

1499
02:12:37,610 --> 02:12:45,270
Okay, so almost every game that was suggested by you guys
made it to the finals and won.

1500
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,190
So we got EDF, whichever version that wins.

Guruman, Prey, Devil May Cry 5, Dragon Ball Z, Sign, Hat and
Time, Space Marine, Project Nexus, Rain World, and Carry On,

widespread appeal of games without the 1800 civil about the

1506

1800 civil age of climbing one of these days i'll fire

One of these days, somebody will play my favorite game about
Scottish climbing.

1509
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:51,050
That is like a very, very specific niche you have there,
sir.

1510
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:53,930
That is extremely specific.

1511
02:13:58,310 --> 02:14:01,010
Someday you will find that streamer.

1512
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:04,450
Someday, I believe in you.

1513
02:14:05,810 --> 02:14:07,590
He's going to be on a live stream.

1514
02:14:07,610 --> 02:14:17,610
long search all right but yeah that was really fun though i
had a really great time like looking up uh looking up steam

1515
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:24,810
games with all of you guys and reading the reviews i'm sorry
like it wasn't it was only i like i like put my cut off at

1516
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:32,210
like two hours because like i wanted to rest a little bit
today so that's why i had to cut the stream to two hours

1517
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:39,490
today um so i didn't do a lot of uh I want to do more game
suggestions, but I don't want to overdo it because I don't

1518
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:42,590
want to overdo myself with getting burnt out and everything.

1519
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:45,130
So that's why I had a little cutoff for myself.

1520
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:48,250
Anyway, I hope you guys had a great time.

1521
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:52,490
I had a great time talking with a lot of you guys and
hanging out and just looking at video games together.

1522
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:55,810
It looks like five is winning.

1523
02:14:56,010 --> 02:15:01,590
So I'm going to do a countdown for everybody for the last
final vote in which I don't think, I honestly don't think

1524
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:08,390
4.1 is going to win looking at these numbers, but I will
entertain the thought about giving guys more time to vote.

1525
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:16,970
So 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and pull.

1526
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:20,710
Yeah, EDF 5 wins in the end.

1527
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:27,910
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture
check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing

1528
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:35,270
interview so for me head to bed because you deserve it i'll
see you guys next time everybody bye guys bye
