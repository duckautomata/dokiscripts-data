Welcome to my humble tomato farm.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,670
Everyone always asks me, why is the server called the tomato
farm?

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,670
Why are there farmers?

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,130
Why are there tomato wardens?

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,350
Well, you see children.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,150

But it was not this kind of thing.

59
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,910
I'm disappointed, though.

60
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,850
Everyone keeps asking me, why is our server called a tomato
farm?

61
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,490
Now we know why.

62
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:55,510
Inside my skin suit was a tomato all along inside all of us

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,220

the apex category because this is supposed to be a quick

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:17,820

here I'm never leaving anyway guys so yeah it's so

77
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:27,620

of the world, but it's still April 1st year on West Coast.

78
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,100
So we're living our tomato life.

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,540
We're still going to live our tomato life.

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,080
This tomato work all day and night to earn the respect of
their parents.

81
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,040
And at their college graduation, they take the moment and
say, well, I guess I caught up.

82
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,520
Castle Life is leading me to my stream.

83
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,960
Over four hours here for it.

84
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,920
I wonder how much everyone's wanted to do this joke.

85
00:06:50,440 --> 00:07:00,020
okay all right I I have a confession to make I've had this
model on standby for four months I didn't know what to do

86
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:10,380
with it and I was like oh shit wait April 1st I had this
model on standby for four months because I was like what if

87
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:19,060
I could do with this I was like oh shit I I didn't know what
to do if I just wanted I just wanted a tomato model but I

88
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:32,960

she doesn't work for a month it plays off the other joke in

a multi-layered fashion exactly what do you mean joke this

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,630

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,030

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:54,720

game If we win a game, I'll swap to tomato form.

174
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,420
Every game we win, I'll play, I'll be a tomato dokey.

175
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,100
That's definitely the face of a con artist.

176
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,460
Anyone who is late to the stream will have miscellaneous
life-changing experience.

177
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,100
Yeah, all right.

178
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,460
We need to win a lot.

179
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,020
I'll send him a tomato redeemed after the stream, too, for
the next year.

180
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,600
And then, hmm, unfortunate if I suddenly die.

181
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,860
Hmm, we'll be very unfortunate, guys.

182
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,240
Imagine the power boosted from the choosing tomato firm.

183
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,540
Tomatoes coming back.

184
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,120
Bug!

185
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,700
Mabel's boss actually heard beer tomato head confirmed.

186
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,620
Wait, have you ever seen hair on tomatoes?

187
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,780
Gosh!

188
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,680
Or maybe underneath this hat is a tomato stem.

189
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,880
We'll never know.

190
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,140
We'll never know.

191
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,220
What is this tomato dough?

192
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
I don't understand.

193
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,580
You'll see one day.

194
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,240
Don't worry.

195
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,160
Where's Oswald?

196
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,780
Neighbors and me.

197
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
We will never know.

198
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,320
We will never know what's underneath this hat.

199
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,340
A tomato stem?

200
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,240
Or is it actually just a bald spot?

201
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
We'll never know.

202
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,140
You'll know when you're older.

203
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,660
Alright, alright.

204
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:39,100

211
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,950
Do you sweat tomato juice?

212
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:21,950

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,730
We'll find all this out in two weeks.

219
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,750
There's like a team like there?

220
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,570

221
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,370

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,810
The car's on the roof.

226
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,510
Oh, they think it's a car.

227
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,830

You guys will be fine, right?

229
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,970
I am not concerned about dying here.

230
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,520
What?

231
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,180
Iron is a safety base day after my birthday?

232
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,940
Wait, where did they go?

233
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,900

234
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,780
Oh, okay, I'm gonna take this car.

235
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,820
Oh, you know, I don't need that car going.

236
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,840
Forget that.

237
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,600
Oh, there's a guy right here.

238
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960

Don't worry, guys!

240
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,240
You can die if you want to, it's okay.

241
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,420
What the fuck, what is this?

242

245
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,500
Nope.

246
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,080
Oh, oh, okay, I'm coming over.

247
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
It's okay, I'm gonna stay far.

248
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,020
Oh, it is not okay anymore.

249
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,320
Oh my God, they're both cracked.

250
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,320
I don't have armor up here.

251
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,960
No, no.

252
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,800

00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,820
Yeah, he armor swapped off me.

254
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,500
It's okay.

255
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,740
It's okay.

256
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,150
No game of...

257
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,280
It's okay.

258
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,760
That means I don't have to be tomato.

259
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,140

261
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,880
I think I do have- I think I played like 3D- They should
take the game that I should have.

262
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,320
I think I haven't really played the past like four days.

263
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,800
I think I played like like 40 minutes the past four days.

264
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,860
Um...

265
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:46,060

set up the tomato vtuber I did not warm up at all.

266
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,700

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,740
They were on there.

345
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,240
They were in there.

346
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,220
But it's so...

347
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,120

349
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,320

355
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,460
They're following me.

356
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,940

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,140
We'll die together.

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,450
What's going to get there?

361
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,180

I'm guarding him.

428
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,730
Simply run.

429
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,590
Only the gods can survive the cluster, fuck.

430
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,790
Just like, uh, kindergarten.

431
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,830
This was looted.

432
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,030
There's a blue armor here for you.

434
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,430
I need, like, syringes.

435
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,830
I haven't found a single syringe.

436
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,810
I got a med kit for him.

437
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,430

00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,190

440
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,810
Oh my god.

441
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,470
How am I still kill leader?

442
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,810
All I've been doing is running.

443
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,590
I don't know what's sadder.

444
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,010
Oh, I need that.

445
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,900
There's another recipe I can use it.

446
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,780
You just run away, just leave.

447
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,560
That's why.

448
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:46,350
true it gets kills by simply existing oh wait I've not felt
laughing as if being dead you think I'd actually pick up

449
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:59,270
your mobile respawn beacon though I'll just run away I'll
use this for weapon that's to the dreams we haven't found

450
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,630
any other people since we started Are you ready?

451
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,210
I see people.

452
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,490
All right, Wapig, be careful.

453
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,070
Just flying into them.

454
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,210
Wapig, wait for us.

455
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,830
Wapig, just wait for us, Wapig!

456
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,170
Wait for us!

457
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,350
Is he stimming back?

458
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,550
Is he stimming back to us?

459
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,090
Where is he?

460
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,870
Where are they?

461
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,580
Well, there they are.

462
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,280
All right, let's go.

463
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,320
I'm ready to pick up your banners, guys.

464
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,380
He's right on the respawn beacon.

465
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,720
Even if MRB doesn't take inventory, he still doesn't take
it.

466
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,140
This is just a chance game of attack.

467
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,200
Might throw my on the respawn beacon, I guess.

468
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,700
He's right here.

469
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,440
Three times.

470
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,500
Three times the charm, guys.

471
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,320
Are there?

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,660
I'm almost here, guys.

473
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,740
Crofting.

474
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm almost here.

475
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,540
That's not mine.

476
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,100
That is not mine.

477
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,780
That is not mine.

478
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,920
I can't shoot them because they decided to start crofting,
so I can't see anything.

479
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,140
I can't.

480
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:12,700
Well, well, I might be well, I couldn't run from that holy
fuck like I'm stunned I'm like oh, that's the last guy.

481
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,440
That's the last guy.

485
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,320
No, he's not.

486
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,420
I was trying to find him And oh, where do you see me team me

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,480

543
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,390

I don't know what the rage is.

548
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,590
Yeah, I don't have a secondary gun yet.

549
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,410
This is like my warm-up game, so I'm like, I don't know
where the wraith went.

550
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,570

593
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,130

I didn't get him.

597
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,250
I didn't shoot him.

598
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:35,690
I didn't hit him.

599
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,290

726
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,970

00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,150
Dude, it is literally just above you.

731
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:02,080
There's one guy left.

Dude, he's just shooting.

735
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,120
I just think he's onto the prime.

736
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,980
Can he get some part nights real quick?

737
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,260

739
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,500
I know, I know.

740
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,320
And then he jumps down and dies.

00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,700

00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,880
Oh, you like what you see, guys?

749
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,780
You like what you see?

750
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,280

751
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,720
Oh, I'm wearing my, why am I running into the zone?

752
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,230
I love my little shimmy, too.

753
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,850
I think that's my favorite part.

754
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,070
But I take off my skin suit.

755
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,990
I love the little shimmy I can do for you guys.

756
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,970
Maybe it'll be a tinier tornado.

757
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:33,470
Oh, shit.

758
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:34,330
That's where they are.

759
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:37,530
He's like...

760
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,350
He made a portal for his teammates.

761
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,810
Don't worry, guys!

762
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:43,830
Uh-huh.

763
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,770
Oh, what the fuck?

764
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,410
He's flush.

765
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,570
Don't worry, I have speed...

766
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,090
Oh, he hit me...

767
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,310
Whoa, he hit me!

768
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,560
That's illegal!

769
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,460
Here's him for me.

770
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,950
I don't like this.

771
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,930
So much mobility, all that flash?

772
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,510
Oh, but you forgot that blood in all games is just tomato
ketchup.

773
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,010
So technically you're killing your brethren.

774
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:13,670
So?

775
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,290
I eat my brethren too.

776
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,970
That's what they get.

777
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:20,150
That's what they get.

778
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,370
They eat my tomato finisher.

779
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:22,890
I don't know.

780
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,810
See there, thanks.

781
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,030
It's called tomato juices.

782
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,900
Tomato seeds, camel, the cigarette's back.

783
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,180
Every tomato I consume might get stronger.

784
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,460
Feed your children, Simmy.

785
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,330
Become tomato, reduce it, boxy, come, bro.

786
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,050
Big Doki took a U-turn.

Isn't it great that the level 21 with the Spitfire wins?

814

Alright, res me.

872
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,720
Res me.

873
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:21,520
Where?

874
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,680
Where's the tomato?

875
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,720
Hold on, okay, okay, okay.

876
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,960
We don't need WAPIC.

877
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,420
We can win this without him.

878
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,840
This thing's got people in their life.

879
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,960
God damn.

880
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,620
Feed me more.

881
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,260
Don't worry, chat.

882
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,880
You feed me more tomato children.

883
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,100
I'll get bigger.

884
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,260
It's hard living that rooted life of a vegetable.

885
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,320
Truly is.

886
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,660
But I gotta get ready.

887
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,660
Alright, Omni, thanks for hitting all of us.

888
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,600
Even though you were just lucky.

889
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,260
Thank you!

890
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,760
I hope you have a good night's rest.

891
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,060
Have a good street.

892
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,680
Thank you!

893
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,680
I hope you have a good night's rest, Omni.

894
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,320
Tornado capitalism to enhance the power exactly.

895
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,840
Why do you think I have a tomato farm?

896
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,160
I eat my children.

897
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,860
Only the strongest tomato can survive, exactly.

898
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,920
Survival of the fittest was created just for tomatoes like
me.

899
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,740
I'm gonna get armor real quick.

900
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:49,190
Alright, I have dumb guns right now.

00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,490

It's alright.

903
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,490
To be cracked at APS need to pass a tomato trap!

I'm just leading a bit more.

909
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,050
Do not worry.

910
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,490
I have nothing.

911
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,950
I'm going to take this.

00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:37,870
Oh, it's Suki.

913
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,890
It's Suki-chan.

914
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,430
It's a full box down now.

915
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:44,190
All right, they're fighting.

916
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,230
Well, last two teams are fighting.

917
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:45,770
Yeah, take that box.

918
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:46,150

00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,530
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,570
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

921
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,890
We gotta go to the last squad after.

922
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,010
Yeah.

923
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,250
Careful for your health.

924
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,170
Oh, shit, my health.

925
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,430

928
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,390
Oh, they finished.

929
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,490
They finished.

930
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,890
I think it's a 1v.

931
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,490
It's a 2v3.

932
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,220
I'm almost there.

933
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:10,840
Oh, shit!

934
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,140

00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:12,740
One's above.

936
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,600
They're all above.

937
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,180
74 on the other.

938
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:17,980
Oh, no.

939
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,580
They're gonna heal.

940
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,740
Yeah, they're gonna heal.

941
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,400
What the fuck?

942
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,240
I don't have any.

943
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,940
I don't have any, uh...

944
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,320

946
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,500
Fuck you guys!

947
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,280
You're used to yourself, does that mean you'll keep going
back and not gain any size?

948
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

949
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,040
I would anyone eat themselves.

950
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,900
I have a farm.

951
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,720
I'm never gonna run out of food.

952
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:56,840
Well...

953
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,740
Looks like we lost.

954
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,940
Do I go back?

955
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,860
I guess I have to put back my skin suit on.

956
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,780
Because we didn't win.

957
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,940
Unfortunate.

958
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,120

Why not?

1041
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,860
We consumed some tomato children.

1042
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,080
No, I stopped shooting.

1043
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:33,300

01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,240
What the fuck?

1135
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,960

1136
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,600

I want to see him control with my body.

1144
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,160
Maybe my entry just is in pause stream of just one PC.

1145
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,620
No, it's possible, you need like a really good graphics card
and a really good CPU.

1146
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,300
It's possible if you don't want...

1147
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,160
Not really good in terms of GPU and CPU, but like...

1148
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,840
Well, I have my model on, so I need like...

1149
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:40,000

1153
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,680
Ah, console, I see.

1154
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,900
They just want you to follow.

1155
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,300
Tries or Apex Team or a PS4 account.

1156
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:18,960
Thank you, thank you.

1157
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,420
They're here.

1158
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,920
Oh, they're like camping.

1159
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,640
I have heat chills.

1160
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,880
Oh, I do not have heat chills.

1161
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,300
Do you have heat chills?

1162
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,900
Is that the doke bird?

1163
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:29,760
It is.

1164
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,340
This zone is okay, right?

1165
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,780
Yeah, it's second.

1166
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,480
I don't know, I just realized, I don't have Medkid, but
that's fine.

1167
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,360
We can raise him...

1168
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,460
We have to raise him here.

1169
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,060
Wow.

1170
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,900
I don't have a mobile recipe, can you?

1171
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:46,600
Nope.

1172
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,200
Maybe one of these freaks had one.

1173
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,020
No, they did.

1174
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,540
Come in, there is salvage.

1175
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:52,860
They're here, they're here.

1176
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:53,640
I hear them.

1177
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,880
Wait, I think they're fighting.

1178
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:57,720
Yeah, they're fighting.

1179
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:58,860
To my left.

1180
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,120

Bradugal, thank you, thank you!

1186
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:17,820

1187
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,440
Okay, I'm just looking for...

1188
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,520
Yeah, because they're fighting right now over here.

1189
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:25,750
All right.

1190
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:27,410
Yeah, they're just like...

1191
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,190
They're fighting right here.

1192
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,030
I'm just trying to apex scene.

1193
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:33,870
Don't you think you're so much of a follow?

1194
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,450
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1195
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:35,990
I do appreciate it, thank you so much.

1196
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:42,410
My games are just fine how the how the emphasis is not able
to play on my laptop.

1197
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,710
I make 3D games.

1198
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:47,930
It's just Apex is very not very optimized very well.

1199
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,490
It's like it's like very unoptimized.

1200
01:12:54,290 --> 01:13:00,350
That's why a lot of people like play Apex but they don't
stream it because it's like your frames die very like you

1201
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:03,870
get like very shit frames that you try to unless you have a
good PC setup.

1202
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,610
What, like, even I, like...

1203
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,250
I think I need... No, I'm good, yeah.

1204
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,300
This isn't looted, so you should be okay here.

1205
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,480
There's, like, loot here.

1206
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,500
There's a blue arm here.

1207
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,690
I'm coming over.

1208
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,380
Knock one.

1209
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,480
I am almost here.

1210
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,060
Where's his teammate?

1211
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,560
Down there.

1212
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,380
I see him.

1213
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:43,260
45 on the caustic I hear uh bloodhound.

I was okay

1217
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,640
No, yeah, Apex run perfectly fine max and even while stream,
but you want to low extend stream.

1218
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,720
Yeah, yeah, you just can't, it's very hard to run it with
stream stuff.

1219
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,840
Wapak, you want to purple?

1220
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,620

01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,860
Aww, it is.

1233
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:13,420
That's unlucky.

1234
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,480
And they have double Spitfire.

1235
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,560
Alright, let's just Res Wapik.

1236
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,920
Wait, there's no more Res Beacons!

1237
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1238
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,480
Here, yeah, yeah, I'm going to Map Room right now.

1239
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,940
I can- I'll Resim my Resim.

1240
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:26,560
Yeah, yeah.

1241
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,180
I got- We got Resim!

1242
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:30,980
Okay.

1243
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,260
Wait, wait, you don't have to go.

1244
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,980
I'll go Map Room and Resim, and then I'm ditching him after
that.

1245
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,280
Just stay alive.

1246
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,530
Try to push updates constantly.

1247
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,950
Yeah, there's a lot of bugs in Apex that they haven't fixed
at all.

1248
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,390
Like, the rank...

1249
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:54,630
There's so many bugs in Apex that they haven't really fixed,
but they're just like, well, we're still making money.

1250
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:56,150
That's all right.

1251
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:59,090
I think it's not just Apex.

1252
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,950
A lot of developers do that as long as they're still
making...

1253
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:05,310
Oh, they're pushing Epic, I think.

1254
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,670
I'm gonna smoke them.

1255
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,430
You're getting landed over here.

1256
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,570
I'm gonna close zone.

1257
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:14,470
I'm me, I'm me.

1258
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,070
Oh you want to fight?

1259
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:16,910
Oh no, we're fucked then.

1260
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,470
I don't want to fight because I just saw me.

1261
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,350
Yeah, I'm fucked then.

1262
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,850
I hit him for 55.

1263
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,010
I got one of them, but...

1264
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,950
Yeah, I'm self-rishing with gold backpacks.

1265
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,830
Yeah, but I think they might curse you.

1266
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,630
Wait, he's behind me?

1267
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,990
What the fuck?

1268
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,430
I'm trying to get back to you.

1269
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,430
How is he behind me?

1270
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:35,690
There's no sound.

1271
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:37,630
I'm coming back.

1272
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,710
I dropped down accidentally, so...

1273
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:40,210
Oh, okay.

1274
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,630
Well, I finished one of them.

1275
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,490
Okay.

1276
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:44,430
Always, I'm trying to destroy my x-packs.

1277
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,430
Well, I can't see him, too.

1278
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,750
I hit 75 on him.

1279
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:52,410
Oh shit, wait, what the fuck?

1280
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:52,890
I'm dead.

1281
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:55,110
Wait, what?

1282
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:58,870
I didn't know he was above me.

1283
01:16:59,550 --> 01:16:59,710
Oh.

1284
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:00,250
Peek me.

1285
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,610
Come on, I know you want to peek me.

1286
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:02,810
Oh, he's not.

1287
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,530
He's trying to...

1288
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:04,690
Yeah, he got your armor slop.

1289
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:05,930
I'm dead then.

1290
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:08,030
Yeah.

1291
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:11,630
He got your armor.

1292
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:25,530
armor swap that was ah that was close that was close though
I was fucking fracking my name was really on point that game

1293
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:37,870
which is nice that's all me bros look it's like how uh
fortnite uh caters very heavily to little children um to buy

1294
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:38,590
their skins

1295
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:46,950
It's like, it's not just Apex, it's every other AAA game
that can earn money.

1296
01:17:54,660 --> 01:18:04,160
Like how, you know, they keep making skins of, like, very,
very big streamers and be like, Hey guys, buy my skin.

1297
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:07,360
And then, like, children, kids are like, Oh my God, you're
my favorite streamer!

1298
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,260
I'm going to buy your skin!

1299
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,580
And then, bam, we don't have to care about anything else.

1300
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,280
I played Eggman for the first time yesterday and see Doki
play Serial.

1301
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:25,540
now that I understand a little more about the game the seed
the zoom it's just wild because I can stream hot flying that

1302
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:38,620
game looks amazing yeah it's just apex in general it's just
not optimized for for the thing and so I need like a very

1303
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:49,100
powerful rig just not very powerful just a very good rig
just to stream apex and have my model on and also and also

1304
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,620
be able to Pew Pew in Apex.

1305
01:18:52,460 --> 01:19:02,220
That's why you see a lot of YouTubers that just run PNG
because they rather just have good frames instead of instead

1306
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:06,140
of like, you know, Pew Pew instead of like having the model
on.

1307
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,980
Can't wait for tomato-dokie skin in Fortnite.

1308
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,880
We almost got our tomato form back.

1309
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,840
Also, thank you so much for the follow Pineapple.

1310
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:31,980
Thank you so much for the follow Pineapple.

1311
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,480
Thank you, I really do appreciate it.

1312
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,020
Thank you so much.

1313
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:35,980
I'm ready.

1314
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,900
I'm gonna fly over to there now.

1315
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,620
There was a team here, but they dipped off as soon as they
saw...

1316
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,160
No, not anymore.

1317
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,360
They saw the Pred Trails and were like, fuck that.

1318
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,740
You guys need to see where they make the games more parable
to play on lower end PC.

1319
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,680
Yeah, this is unfortunate.

1320
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:54,320
Maybe I should be using my shitty AFR stream the game, but
play the game on my PC.

1321
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,040
That might work.

1322
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,200
Yeah, yeah.

1323
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,780
I see that.

1324
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,580
I'm gonna snipe that.

1325
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,880
I just got sniped at by...

1326
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:15,980
Okay Well, I can't do anything about that Well, okay, I
thought you were gonna be You know what it's alright It's

1327
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:16,240
okay.

1328
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,780
This might be dumb But it's okay.

1329
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,120
It's not dumb.

1330
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:20,900
It was so smart.

1331
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,380
It was so smart

1332
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,050
He's cracked Last guy's over here though.

1333
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,250
Yeah, I'm just gonna back up.

1334
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:35,530
No No, there's another team.

1335
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:36,910
There's another team on us.

1336
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,790
I have?

1337
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,630
There's another team over here.

1338
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:40,870
Oh, yeah.

1339
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:41,390
You're right.

1340
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,340
That bubble disappeared.

1341
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:47,900
It's working.

1342
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,400
He doesn't know.

1343
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,940
He doesn't know.

1344
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:54,920
Idiot?

1345
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:02,250
Alright.

1346
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:03,370
I am safe.

1347
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:08,790
Yeah.

1348
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:09,310
Oh, yeah.

1349
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:12,010
I heard there was a lot of problems with the switch port.

1350

No, you're saying it's too good to die under control of the
game.

1359
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,120
Yes, I am.

1360
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,300

three or so minutes.

1371
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,480
And we're gonna call it here.

1372
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,600
I told you guys it was gonna be a short stream today.

1373
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,320
Hi, Juki!

1374
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,040
Let's hope we get like another win.

1375
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,880
So we can be our true selves.

1376
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,980
Do you speak Japanese?

1377
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,060
I do not.

1378
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,740
I apologize.

1379
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:19,720
I do know.

1380
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,880
I'm very bad at Japanese.

1381
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:28,520
I speak a lot of other languages, but Japanese isn't one of
them.

1382
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,840
Learning languages is just very hard.

1383
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,420
She's amazing in French.

1384
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,880
Ah, bonjour!

1385
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:45,720
No, I swear I'm actually decent at French.

1386
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:50,280
Oh, Tokyo only speaks wee.

1387
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:51,320
Can we get?

1388
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,660
Nope, only wins.

1389
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,260
Unfortunately not.

1390
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,720
I speak English, French, Chinese, both Cantonese and
Mandarin.

1391
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,180
And a bit of Korean, but not Japanese.

1392
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,780
Japanese is a very, very, very hard language to learn.

1393
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:24,180
I just I just need to find the time to learn it I need to
get like a tutor.

1394
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:31,260
I think like the Japanese you have to get a tutor to learn
that language Just because there's so many rules and like so

1395
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:37,280
many So yeah, but I grew up with Chinese though.

1396
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:46,700
I grew up learning Chinese from My parents so so that was
fine, but like if you're like especially at such an old like

1397
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:53,980
you know like old such a late age whoa i destroyed their
secret thingy

1398
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:15,330
i do not know which one one uh let me last to us this is low
this guy's low this guy weapon behind you behind you low um

1399
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:34,170
uh to actually learn Japanese you lived or use it yeah yeah
same with Chinese too same with Chinese I think if I had to

1400
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:42,390
learn Chinese um now if I didn't know Chinese at all I'd
have to learn it now um I would be I would give up I would I

1401
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:43,210
would give up

1402
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:57,550
a tutor like I don't I think dual angle doesn't really help
in terms of like uh in terms of like actually like learning

1403
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:05,470
learning uh learning learning and language I think like it's
better to just hire a tutor instead of like going to do dual

1404
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:11,690
lingo because i think dual lingo is just like an extra bonus
thing that you can do for like you know just to brush it up

1405
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,110
after your

1406
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:40,320
lessons are you are you a chinese i'm canadian are you a
chinese i'm canadian you sound funny when said cantonese

1408
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:48,470
my second year living Japan.

1409
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:51,950
I can only do casual conversational Japanese.

1410
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:54,730
I'm struggling business Japanese.

1411
01:26:55,070 --> 01:27:01,470
Oh yeah, I heard like, I heard like even like if you're
like, even if you're like a fluent Japanese speaker, like

1412
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:02,450
you're still learning too.

1413
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:06,370
It's still hard for like even native speakers in Japan.

1414
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:07,690

Last guy's right here.

1533
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:05,750
Hi, he's so dumb.

1534
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:09,610
You must sniping me for some unknown reason.

1535
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,070
My aim today is really good.

1536
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:18,830
Which is surprising, because usually on stream it's not.

1537
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,340
I tried learning Swedish.

1538
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,220
I could have two but it doesn't seem hard compared to other
languages.

1539
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,340
I think... Oh!

1540
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:37,580
I think Swedish is very hard to learn in terms of speaking
Swedish.

1541
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:44,410
Got one of them?

1542
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,790
Oh shit, wait, what the fuck?

1543
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:47,710
Dead.

1544
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,110
That was good.

1545
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:51,290
Pop!

1546
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:52,770
I did nothing and that's fine.

1547
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:54,750
I tried learning Swedish.

1548
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:56,610
Thank you so much for the follow, pros.

1549
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:57,250
I do appreciate it.

01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:57,690
Thank you!

1551
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:04,030
Now I think like, Swedish is very hard to pronounce.

1552
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:12,270
Like I can't do a lot of like European languages because
European languages is very hard for me to pronounce in terms

1553
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:13,710
of like tongue movements.

1554
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:16,410
Cause like you gotta like move your tongue in a specific
way.

1555
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:19,610
And I'm like I can't even roll my R's.

1556
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:24,410
Like I can't do I can't roll my R's.

1557
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:29,250
That was me attempting to roll my R's.

1558
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:34,070
And you gotta be able to roll, you use the...

1559
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:38,450
That's me rolling ours.

1560
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:40,610
Oh,

1561
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:47,810
those sounds like it's always a fault.

1562
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:48,470
Thank you.

1563
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,270
Say, well, I'll still roll your arms.

1564
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,050
Alrighty, Bob.

1565
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:07,720
The language is one of the hardest, like, languages is very
hard to learn, especially the older you get.

1566
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:15,020
So sign that I'm almost buried, like, you gotta be like the
best, you know, you gotta learn young.

1567
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,100
Cause the older you get, the harder it is to learn a
language.

1568
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,480
Cause your brain is already developed.

1569
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:30,140
Unless, I mean, my brain stopped developing after a certain,
after elementary school.

1570
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,620
But, but.

1571
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,840
Wait, where are they?

1572
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,880
And last time I saw them, they went in the bunker.

1573
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,500
They're in bunker?

1574
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,860
I'm just gonna read a play over above then.

1575
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,020
I'm going to Lifeline Package.

1576
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,000
Lifeline Package?

1577
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:46,260
Where?

1578
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,040
Here?

1579
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:56,760
My son said Malay's easy learning, and somehow I took 10
years learning the formal version of my mother tongue.

1580
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:00,020
I still went to Lifeline Package because there was nothing
in the radar.

1581
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,940
Here, right in front of me.

1582
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,290
Crack one of them.

1583
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,460
I hit smoking on the other.

1584
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,300
I'm trying to get closer.

1585
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,240
I'm getting closer to you.

1586
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,280
Hey there.

1587
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,540
Hey there.

1588
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:27,940
Aha!

1589
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,820
Cracked off team!

1590
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,420
I'm getting dead.

1591
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,900
Where's your teammate?

1592
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:37,380
Huh?

1593
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,440
Oh, he had a...

1594
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:39,700
Oh.

1595
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,620
Okay.

1596
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,160
I'm coming over.

1597
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:43,660
I'm alting?

1598
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:44,780
I alting.

1599
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,600
This is my alt.

1600
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:47,380
This is my alt.

1601
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,540
This is my alt.

1602
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,140
This is my alt.

1603
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,240
Where are they?

1604
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:55,620
Nothing.

1605
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,320
Oh, there are two here.

1606
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:02,640
We're dead.

1607
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:04,980
I'm coming over.

1608
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,180

I contributed.

1611
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,690
I did it.

1612
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:18,210
I contributed!

1613
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:22,250
I get a participation award!

1614
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:29,170
Hmm.

1615
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,170
It's funny, it's weird how people shame you for knowing more
than one language.

1616
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:36,950
Because it's like, like, why would you shame someone for
that?

1617
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:45,490
It's like, it's like, look at this loser knowing not, look
at this loser knowing more than one language.

1618
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:46,210
Wow!

1619
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:49,210
I never understood people who do that.

1623
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:26,830
Yeah, I've heard stories about it.

1624
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:29,730
Like, one of my friends said that she doesn't like...

1625
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:29,950
Oh!

1626
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:31,070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1627
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,930
So she doesn't like speaking...

1628
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,350
Like, because she knows, like, three languages, too.

1629
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:39,910
40?

1630
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:40,930
40 on the...

1631
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,170
Because her parents are from...

1632
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:45,590
Her parents are from Malaysia.

1633
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:49,390
And she was, like, seeing how, like, her friends would,
like...

1634
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:50,810
Wait, where are they?

1635
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:53,650
I got his teammate.

1636
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:54,570
Whoa!

1637
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:55,650

1638
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:09,630
one person, so I don't know if this is...

1639
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:10,690
There's two teams here.

1640
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:11,130
There's two teams?

1641
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:11,870
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1642
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:12,650
I just thought I was going to stay.

1643
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:14,750
Yeah, the other team is in here.

1644
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:17,530
No, there's a guy right here.

1645
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:26,540
One?

1646
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,000
I stole that one so far.

1647
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:37,720
No, but part of it is that I'm using is don't often need to
use the second language.

1648
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,140
I really like the background music singer.

1649
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:43,420
Yeah, yeah, they're all over there.

1650
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,300
Right here, I see them.

1651
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,580
They're right there.

1652
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:49,760
Poor guy!

1653
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,320
The last guy's over here, the last guy's further.

1654
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,420
Last guy, oh, last guy!

1655
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,120
If we win this, I'd be a tomato again!

1656
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,260
Oh, they're both one.

1657
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:05,440
I'm the third guy.

1658
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,360
All right, so.

1659
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,940
I altered them.

1660
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,420
58 on one of them.

1661
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,520
I hit 180 and 160.

1662
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,080
You're fine.

1663
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,480
They're like running because of my...

1664
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,920
Yeah, we just died, otherwise.

1665

1667
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,380
What the fuck?

1668
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,320
Why is that...

1669
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,400
I'm dead.

1670
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:30,740
Oh, last...

1671
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:32,120

01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:34,520
It's two.

1675
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,380
They're resing one guy.

1676
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,780
The other guy is self-res.

1677
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,140
This guy is self-res.

1678
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:42,020

Sometimes I want to go wild and like get buried in other
farms and steal their tomato children for my own.

1763
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:27,470
You know, you know typical tomato things.

1764
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:29,910
For season killing.

1765
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,890

1769
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:49,000

Not only do I steal money, I steal other people's tomatoes.

1779
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,840
There can only be one tomato farm.
