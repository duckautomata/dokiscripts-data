00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,250
Hello.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,550
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,290
Welcome to my humble tomato farm.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,370
Everyone always asks me, why is the server called the tomato farm?

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,370
Why are there farmers?

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,830
Why are there tomato wardens?

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,510
Well you see children...

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,910
You see... I have a tomato.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,700
Welcome to the farm children.

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,250
I had to... I was getting a bit too high outside.

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,750
I had to take off my skin suit real quick.

12
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,510
Ah yes.

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,610
Um... a little tomatoes.

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,190
It's still April first year.

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,890
Welcome to my farm everyone.

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,170
Welcome.

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,710
As you see here, my children.

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,090
I... I harvest my children here.

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,110
And then we eat them.

20
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,590
Nice Maro.

21
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,810
Ah yes.

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,870
Thank you.

23
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,730
Is it a new model?

24
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,710
Or was it inside me all along?

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,030
Was it inside me all along the chat?

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,050
Felicity thank you for the five gift subs.

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,190
Thank you for donating to the tomato farm.

28
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,030
Thank you.

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,890
The inside you.

30
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,750
I can't see you.

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,590
I can't reach your file.

32
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,370
Felicity.

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,210
Thank you.

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,150
Thank you for contributing to the farm.

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,270
The internet.

36
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,790
Ah thank you.

37
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,390
Thank you Victor.

38
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,790
For the tier one for nine months.

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,490
Oh that's nine tomatoes right there.

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,050
Nine tomato children right there for you.

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,110
I'm here for the point.

42
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,590
Doki is a V-tomato confirmed V-tuber.

43
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,090
I would like to say V-tomato.

44
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,590
Tomats.

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,650
V-tomats.

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,970
Oh shit.

47
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,530
Is there a country daily song though?

48
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,930
I don't know if there's a country daily.

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,490
Let me see.

50
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,490
Let me see if I can find country.

51
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,250
We might have to change up our daily song real quick.

52
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,410
I think we know what country song we should do for our daily song today.

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,300
Oh thank you so much everybody.

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,340
I just left .

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,820
Thank you.

56
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,880
Welcome to the Tomato farm.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,660
Thank you.

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,160
Thank you.

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,540
West Virginia.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
One kiss alright.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,340
Alright Felicity.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,060
Just for you.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,620
Our kitty bewildering eyes.

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,380
Everyone close your eyes for the tomato kiss.

65
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,510
Take me home to the place I belong!

66
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,590
Oh shit, okay, wait, wait, wait, this is gonna hurt me too.

67
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,130
Alright.

68
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,390
Welcome to tomato town.

69
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,370
Oh shit, I gotta flip you off too?

70
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,330
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, this doesn't work very well, wait.

71
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,810
Wait, I can do this.

72
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,810
Guys, don't worry!

73
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,670
This will work, don't worry guys.

74
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,650
Here we go.

75
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,870
This is for Sid.

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,870
Don't worry!

77
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,930
There we go.

78
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:25,510
Take me home to the place I belong!

79
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,370
Don't...

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,050
It was not this kind of thing.

81
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm disappointed now.

82
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,510
Everyone keeps asking me, why is our server called the tomato farm?

83
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,270
Now we know why.

84
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,250
Inside my skin suit was a tomato all along.

85
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,530
Inside all of us were tomats all along, chat!

86
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,330
Why could they never catch up to the tomato burglar?

87
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,870
They can't catch up to the...

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,150
I love it, bye.

89
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,210
Thank you everyone for coming to my VTuber TV Tomatoes and Feet.

90
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,460
West Virginia!

91
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,280
Country mama!

92
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,620
Ciao, thank you so much for the follow!

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,040
Thank you, thank you.

94
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,380
What's the backstory though?

95
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,540
It is...

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,520
Oh, you guys want to see me dance?

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
To the place I belong!

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,300
Yeah!

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,980
West Virginia!

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,980
Mountain mama!

101
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,940
Take me home!

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,100
Country mama!

103
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,260
Country rooome!

104
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,380
Oh...

105
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,540
Country rooome...

106
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,780
Where to take me home...

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,920
Country rooome...

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,120
I like how I'm in the apex category, because this is supposed to be a quick, like, 5-10 minute joke.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
But I'm still here!

110
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm still here!

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,580
I'm never leaving!

112
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm still here!

113
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:27,300
Yeah, it's still... technically, it might be April 2nd to most people of the rest of the world, but it's still April 1st here on West Coast.

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,700
So we're living our tomato life.

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,160
We're still gonna live our tomato life.

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,900
Does this tomato work all day and night to earn the respect of their parents?

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,280
Does this tomato work all day and night to earn the respect of their parents?

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,540
And at their college graduation, they take the phone and say, well, I guess I caught up.

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,340
And at their college graduation, they take the phone and say, well, I guess I caught up.

120
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,360
Castle Life is leading me to my stream.

121
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,640
Castle Life is leading me to my stream.

122
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,780
Over 4 hours here for it.

123
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,560
I wonder how much everyone's watching this joke.

124
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,420
Okay, alright.

125
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,440
I have a confession to make.

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,480
I've had this model on standby for 4 months.

127
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
I didn't know what to do with it.

128
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,440
And I was like, oh shit, wait, April 1st?

129
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,280
I had this model on standby for 4 months.

130
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,980
Because I was like, what am I gonna do with this?

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
I was like, oh shit!

132
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,760
I didn't know what to do with it.

133
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,860
I just wanted a tomato model.

134
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,000
But I know, I couldn't think of any reason to use it.

135
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,900
For 4 months.

136
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,420
It plays off the other joke in a multi-layered fashion exactly.

137
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,860
What do you mean joke?

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,500
This is my true self.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,820
Right here.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
What are you saying?

141
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,420
What are you saying?

142
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,700
I've had this discussion at the tomato farm.

143
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:44,760
I've had this discussion at the tomato farm.

144
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,500
I've been a farm server for years.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
We are out here harvesting my children.

146
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,020
For consumption.

147
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,120
And that is okay, farmers.

148
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,600
Remember, when you...

149
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,960
Remember, by subbing to me, you become a farmer.

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,440
You become a tomato farmer on our tomato farm.

151
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,400
Isn't that lovely?

152
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,400
Hi Ruby!

153
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
You don't even have a nose.

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,580
Who needs noses as a tomato?

155
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,560
What am I gonna smell?

156
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,500
Huh?

157
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,260
What am I gonna smell?

158
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,340
Sorry, I...

159
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,080
Who is this tomato?

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,880
We were all tomatoes all along.

161
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,920
It's honest work.

162
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,040
It ain't much.

163
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,200
But it's honest work chat.

164
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,220
What happened to Doki?

165
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,520
What's the meme?

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
This was me online.

167
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,700
This was inside my skin suit.

168
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,960
I just unzipped myself.

169
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,800
Please don't eat me.

170
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,480
So are the higher tier tomato farmers like managers over the lower ranks?

171
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,000
Of course.

172
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,280
Thank you.

173
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,180
Just wiped out tomato town.

174
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,080
Reject anime.

175
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,280
Return to tomato.

176
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,680
Exactly.

177
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,620
These are my children right here.

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,840
I don't know if you guys can see my children.

179
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,740
Right here.

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,060
Now I'm gonna eat my children.

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,000
Delicious.

182
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,540
It's called survival of the fittest.

183
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,980
They were strong enough.

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,860
Tomatoes are awesome people.

185
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,860
Tomatoes are awesome people.

186
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
My children were not strong enough.

187
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,360
But don't worry.

188
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,480
We can make more.

189
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,740
We can harvest more of my children.

190
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,540
This is Doki Bird.

191
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,220
What do you mean?

192
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,540
What do you mean?

193
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,140
This was me all along.

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,900
This was inside all of us all along.

195
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,760
We are all tomatoes in the inside.

196
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,360
How do you think tomatoes are grown?

197
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,720
Huh?

198
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,380
The Doki motto.

199
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,100
It was very very awesome.

200
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,200
You know tomatoes are from space?

201
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,980
Wait what?

202
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,640
I didn't even know that.

203
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
Doki woke up and chose violence.

204
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,500
Tomato cannot Doki.

205
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,560
Made it into pizza.

206
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,640
Save Doki.

207
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,280
Maybe you look great even without makeup.

208
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,280
Love the natural look.

209
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,660
Thank you.

210
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,120
Thank you.

211
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,300
This is me wiping down all the human makeup.

212
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,440
And the human suit.

213
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,200
I took it off and here I am.

214
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,960
I thought you were...

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Alright guys.

216
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Alright so let's actually get into the Apex.

217
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,940
You know I think we we had our fun.

218
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,660
Let me do a little tomato dance.

219
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,660
Real quick.

220
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,860
Happy April Fools.

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
I didn't...

222
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,440
I honestly came up with this like in 30 to 40 minutes.

223
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,720
Because I was like.

224
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,540
Should I do a shout out thing for April 1st?

225
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,120
I was like.

226
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,780
Oh shit yeah I have this tomato model.

227
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,040
On standby for 4 months now.

228
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,260
Like maybe this is a good time to use it.

229
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,360
Why do I have a tomato model?

230
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,720
Why do I not have a tomato model?

231
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,080
Excuse me?

232
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,840
I think everyone should have a tomato model.

233
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,980
Yeah why don't you have a tomato model?

234
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,360
Excuse me?

235
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,540
What?

236
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,360
We are called a tomato farm for a reason?

237
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,080
You think I was no...

238
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,800
You think I did it out of...

239
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,840
Do you think like there was no purpose to the tomato farm?

240
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
To my server?

241
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,640
Do you really think there was no purpose?

242
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,940
It still is here.

243
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,320
Alright guys.

244
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm gonna go set up for the actual Apex stream.

245
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,100

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,240

257
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,490
Hello.

258
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,810
I had to... It took me a while to zip back up the human suit.

259
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,450
But...

260
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,930
It took a while to put it back on.

261
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,010
But here we are.

262
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,510
Do not worry.

263
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,790
There's a tomato in all of us.

264
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,910
Do not worry.

265
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,010

266
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,190

Thank you so much.

270
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,910
What happened to the real Doki?

271
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,310
What happened to the real Doki?

272
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,590
What do you mean?

273
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,090
This is the real Doki.

274
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,190
What do you...

275
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,970
I feel like I just woke up from a dream I had at the tomato farm.

276
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,890
Man it was crazy.

277
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,350
Alright let me go.

278
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,890

283
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,770
Our personal singer.

284
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,990
I feel like I'm being... What do you mean?

285
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,330
Does this space look like a liar to you?

286
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,670
He asks a lot.

287
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,750
Alright let me join the voice chat real quick.

288
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,200
Hello?

289
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Hello?

290
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,000
Alright.

291
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,740
You guys ready to pew pew?

292
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,580
I want to get tomato Doki back.

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,120
I want to get tomato Doki back.

294
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,900
Tomato Doki?

295
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,000
How about this?

296
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,460
How about this?

297
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,560
If we win this game... If we win a game I'll swap to tomato farm.

298
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,860
Every game we win I'll play...

299
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,140
I'll be tomato Doki.

300
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,600
That's definitely the face of a god artist.

301
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,380
Wapik.

302
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,060
Anyone who is late to the stream will have a life changing experience.

303
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,880
Alright.

304
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,320
We need to win a lot.

305
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,500
Hahaha.

306
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Tomato Doki.

307
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,140
I'll send him a tomato redeem after the stream too.

308
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,900
For the next year.

309
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,220
Hmm.

310
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,220
Unfortunate if I suddenly die.

311
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:25,780
Hmm.

312
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,560
We'll be very unfortunate guys.

313
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,020
Imagine the power boosted from the teasing tomato farm.

314
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,920
Tomato is coming back.

315
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,700
Bug.

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,920
Mabel's boss actually heard beer tomato head.

317
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,760
Confirmed.

318
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
Have you ever seen hair on tomatoes?

319
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,600
Gosh.

320
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,440
Hahaha.

321
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,500
Or maybe underneath this hat is a tomato stem.

322
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,620
We'll never know.

323
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,920
We'll never know.

324
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,520
Hahaha.

325
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,200
What is this tomato Doki?

326
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,960
I don't understand.

327
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
You'll see one day.

328
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,940
Don't worry.

329
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,640
Hahaha.

330
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,620
Hmm.

331
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,900
We will never know.

332
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,880
We will never know.

333
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,740
We will never know.

334
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,420
Hahaha.

335
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,940
You'll know when you're older.

336
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,680
Hahaha.

337
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,280
Alright.

338
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,560
Alright.

339
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,500
So every win.

340
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,640
Every win will get you a game of tomato.

341
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,020
Of tomato me.

342
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,900
So.

343
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,940
It will be very unfortunate.

344
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,040
If I.

345
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,080
If I run at people with no armor.

346
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,580
Very unfortunate indeed.

347
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,000
Hahaha.

348
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:43,860
Hahaha.

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,340
Maybe it's both.

350
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,820
Alright.

351
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,300
This is a.

352
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,940
We're gonna sweat so hard.

353
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,600
We're gonna make two sweating pools guys.

354
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,040
Hahaha.

355
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,380
Unless I'm lying.

356
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,260
Hahaha.

357
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,100
There's gonna be a short stream today too.

358
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,740
Cause I'm sort of a bit tired.

359
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,160
But I have to do this.

360
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,270
Getting free new damage.

361
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,570
20 plus bomb to make a fourth game.

362
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,150
Where the fuck am I dropping?

363
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,210
I'm already messing up.

364
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,670
Do you sweat tomato juice?

365
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,650
Hmmm.

366
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,930
All this tomato lore.

367
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,650
That we will find out on April 16th.

368
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,170
15th?

369
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,770
I don't even know my own lore date.

370
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,010
Was it 15 or 16 that I have the lore stream?

371
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,990
I don't remember.

372
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:33,710
Hahaha.

373
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,630
In two weeks.

374
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,510

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,270
Hahaha.

391
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,530

393
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,920

Oh okay.

398
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,680

399
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,340
Oh you know I don't need that car.

400
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,760
Don't worry guys.

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,540
You can die if you want to.

405
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,400

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,420
I am taking the car.

416
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,800
Oh it is not okay anymore.

417
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,220
Oh my god.

418

Hahaha.

420
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,440

It's okay.

424
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,600
It's okay.

425
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,440
That means I don't have to be tomato.

426
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,620
Hahaha.

427
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:17,840
Hahaha.

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,000
I have not played.

430
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,100
I think I played like...

431
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,140
3D... I should take the kill.

432
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,040
I think I haven't really played the past like 4 days.

433
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,560
I think I played like 40 minutes the past 4 days.

434
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,500
Um.

435
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,560
And I did not warm up before I set the tomats.

436
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,160
And before I set up the tomato vtuber.

437
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,980
Hahaha.

438
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,660
Hahaha.

439
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,760
I did not warm up at all.

440
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,500
Hey terminal.

441
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,560

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,660
So this is all.

443
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,660
No tomato no win.

444
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,260
Hahaha.

445
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,780
Tomato is all the way.

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,800
Tomato vtuber heck yeah.

This will be a short stream too guys.

448
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,450
I just need to warn you in advance.

449
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,570
This will be a short stream.

450
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,230
Hahaha.

451
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,500
Lately to be honest to be fair for you guys.

452
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,640
Lately I have been feeling the burn out slowly creeping in on me.

453
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,900
Only because like.

454
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
Because of all this like partner.

455
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,300
Um.

456
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,520
Are you gonna throw the game away?

457
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280

Feeling very.

463
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,520
Like I have been feeling sort of the burn out coming in lately.

464
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,820
Because I have not really had a break in a while.

465
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,740
Ever since like trying to push for.

466
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,680
Uh.

467
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,660
Push for partner.

468
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
And it is like such a vicious cycle.

469
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,980
Because I have to reapply every two weeks.

470
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,580
And it is like I can't just.

471
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,180
I can't like take a break.

472
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,460
While I am in that like weird area.

473
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,580
Of reapplying every two weeks.

474
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,220
So it is like.

475
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,500
I am like in this weird purgatory place.

476
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,620
Alright.

477
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,780
Wait were we going inside?

478
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,820
I was not listening.

479
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,400
I am going inside.

480
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,400

We are up next.

483
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,720
I think there is people on the map.

484
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,160
I am not sure.

485
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,040
It is okay I have.

486
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,800
Do not loot my stuff.

487
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,460
How did you loot it faster than me?

488
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,320
I was there first.

489
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,780
Stop looting my stuff.

490
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,680
Oh my god.

491
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,620
Wait how did you get my blue armor?

492
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,900
I am so confused.

493
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,200
Who are you?

494
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,680
Oh my god.

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,000
Poor guy.

497
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,840

498
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,460
I am so confused.

499
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,480
I killed two.

500
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,920
Where is the caustic?

501
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,340
Inside?

502
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,360
I heard someone inside.

503
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,780
Hey Logan.

504
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,640
I mean when you are about to win.

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Let the ush kill.

506
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,100
So it will not become a debate.

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,840
There are people outside now.

508
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,380

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,400
It is fine.

534
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,820
I have to reload.

535
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,040
There is one more.

536
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,480

Not gonna lie.

545
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,880
That sounds really good.

546
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,960
They are like fighting another squad.

547
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,200
Oh!

548
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,580

That is where they are.

557
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,420

Goodbye.

566
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,680
I am so confused.

567
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,480
Oh no!

568
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,780
They are following me.

569
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
I was safe for one second.

570
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,320
I will pay for one second.

571
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,700
I am going to land into them.

572
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,920
We will die together.

573
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,820
We will die together.

574
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,040
You just landed into me.

575
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,480
I am alive.

576
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,080
I am alive.

577
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,640
That is so funny.

578
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,240
Freaks.

579
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
You are all freaks.

580
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,840
Take my shit.

581
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,720
Take all of it.

582
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,160
I don't even know what is going on.

583
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,760
I am the woman.

584
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,540
What the fuck?

585
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,400
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

586
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,020
What the fuck?

587
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,860
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

588
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,120
It is okay.

589
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,340
Okay.

590
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,720
Alright.

591
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,400
I need to keep crawling.

592
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,600
That is not a problem.

593
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,040
Please just keep crawling.

594
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,420
This is our only hope.

595
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,420
No!

596
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,860
Wapig, no!

597
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
At least take his armor.

598
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, I am going to take his armor.

599
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
And go for me and run.

600
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,540
Okay.

601
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,160
I don't know about that though.

602
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,140
I am not there.

603
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,900
I am not there.

604
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,400
I am not there.

605
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
What the fuck is this?

606
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,240
I don't even know.

607
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,760
What the fuck?

608
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,580
Why did I lose to you?

609
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,700
Smoke and run.

610
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,940
I should have just left you.

611
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,260
I should have just left you to die.

612
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,220
No.

613
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,000
You did it.

614
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,140
This is going to win us the game.

615
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,280
I hear them.

616
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,860
I hear people.

617
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,080
I hear people.

618
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,340
You were right.

619
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,640
Goodbye.

620
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,880
I am a gamer.

621
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,380
They won't notice you.

622
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I am a gamer.

623
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,060
I have streamer power.

624
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Shut up.

625
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,040
It is okay.

626
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,860
They will definitely notice me when I do this.

627
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,260
They were missing too.

628
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,680
I left.

629
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,680
Goodbye.

630
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,120
He is leaving.

631
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,860
He is not pushing.

632
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,420
He is running away.

633
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,620
He is guarding his teammates.

634
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,260
That is so cute.

635
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,400
I wish we had one of those.

636
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,540
I wish we had.

637
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,400
This is looted.

638
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,600
We might have a problem.

639
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,480
This entire area is looted.

640
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,220
You are even holding back.

641
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,500
I am good.

642
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,180
We might have a little problem.

643
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,160
This is looted.

644
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,460
I have a mask.

645
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
I have a Spitfire.

646
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:53,960
I am good.

647
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,840
I am so scared.

648
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,600
I am so scared.

649
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,020
I am on a 9.

650
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,860
You are on a 9.

651
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,200
Try to find heals.

652
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,520
I have two batteries.

653
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:08,980
You want one?

654
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,080
Yes, I would like.

655
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,900
Oh Wapik.

656
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,760
I don't know if that is a good idea.

657
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,100
They are going to rev soon.

658
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,540
Oh no, not another rebel!

659
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,700
I think it's the same rebel.

660
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,800
Yeah, let's go.

661
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,980
Wapik, are you okay?

662
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,600
I am so far from you guys.

663
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,720
Alright, alright, alright.

664
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,560
Alright, I'm right... Tomato Town is right behind you.

665
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,680
I have ult, I have ult, don't worry.

666
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,780
I ulted.

667
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,540
They're queuing up, they're on you.

668
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,240
I ulted, I ulted, do not worry.

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,000
One hit for 50 on the move.

670
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,780
Okay, I missed every shot, do not worry.

671
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,180
One hit for 30 on the move.

672
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,360
Do not worry, I'm still missing every single shot.

673
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,760
I did not hit a shot.

674
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,880
I did not hit a shot.

675
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,440
Wait, they're getting shot at, this is a new team.

676
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:04,820
Yeah.

677
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,600
Bye.

678
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I have left.

679
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,900
I have missed every single shot, do not worry.

680
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,360
I ran out of bullets.

681
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,900
What do you need?

682
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,740
I only have heavy.

683
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,480
I have energy, but I have a different gun.

684
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,820
I have no run of victory right now.

685
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,520
How about that?

686
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,920
I just missed every single shot.

687
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,660
Oh wow.

688
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,460
Alright, we can re-thread this.

689
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,820
We can re-thread this, like rank.

690
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,800
As if we're rank players.

691
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,020
As if we're good players.

692
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,640
I'm just taking my energy ammo.

693
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,760
Oh my god, what the fuck am I looking at?

694
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,060
What am I looking at?

695
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,080
What am I looking at?

696
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,220
This clusterfuck.

697
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,140
Okay, I can pick...

698
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,300
What the fuck?

699
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,240
Oh yeah, the cinnamon.

700
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,340
Wait.

701
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,340
Okay, no, I'm leaving.

702
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,980
No, no, no, they're rezzing, but they're gonna get the rezz off.

703
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,360
That's why I left.

704
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,600
Look, I got a blue armor too.

705
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,100
Is that the fucking April Fool thing?

706
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,460
That things just fall out of the sky and give you loot?

707
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,620
Yes.

708
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,120
And there's a Mozambique with more...

709
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,200
Golden Mozambique and a Golden 2020.

710
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,080
It's okay, we're fine.

711
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,000
How am I still kill leader?

712
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,320
I am still kill leader in this game.

713
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,900
I'm gonna rezz them right here.

714
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,180
I'm gonna rezz them right here.

715
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,780
Why am I still kill leader?

716
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,020
This is the second time, Wepic.

717
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,700
Second time.

718
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,200
This time I'll help you.

719
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,000
Do you believe me?

720
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,860
No.

721
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,180
No.

722
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,960
Even I don't believe.

723
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,480
Then I don't have to.

724
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,880
You're right, because I'm a gamer.

725
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,240
I'm working some for my ex-king.

726
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,280
Naked and afraid.

727
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,820
It truly is.

728
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,340
Remember when you picked up the re-election?

729
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,160
It truly is.

730
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,600
We're gonna do it again.

731
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,100
I don't know how I've lived this long, chat.

732
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,240
I have like nothing.

733
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,260
Like no heals or anything.

734
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm 33.

735
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,280
I've been like scrounging up armors.

736
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm 33.

737
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,160
I've been like scrounging up armors.

738
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
I've just been like stealing armors from everyone.

739
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
I've just been like stealing armors from everyone.

740
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,600
I've just been like stealing armors from everyone.

741
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,890
Alright, we'll be okay.

742
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,050
We'll be okay.

743
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,630
I'm guarding him.

744
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,350
Simply run.

745
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,890
Only the gods can survive the clusterfuck.

746
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,730
Only the gods can survive the clusterfuck.

747
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,470
It's like kindergarten.

748
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,750
This was looted.

749
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,310
There's a blue armor here for you.

750
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,250
I need like syringes.

751
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,630
I haven't found a single syringe.

752
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,090
Oh, I need that.

753
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,030
Oh, I found a medkit.

754
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,230
Alright.

755
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,770
Found a gold heavy mug.

756
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,550
Oh my god.

757
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,190
How am I still kill leader?

758
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,790
All I've been doing is running.

759
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,750
I don't know what's sadder.

760
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,530
Oh, I need that.

761
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,420
Oh, I need that.

762
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,040
There's another recipe.

763
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,060
I can use it.

764
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,280
He just ran away.

765
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,340
That's why!

766
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,480
I can't.

767
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,700
True.

768
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,950
It gets kills by simply existing.

769
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,150
Oh, way too...

770
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,110
I have not felt like Wavagastic being dead properly.

771
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,830
You think I'd actually pick up your mobile or respawn it.

772
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,090
I'm beacon though, I'll just run away.

773
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,710
I'll use this for Wapig.

774
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,510
That's to the dream.

775
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,430
We haven't found any other people since we started running.

776
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,030
I see people.

777
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,250
Alright Wapig, be careful.

778
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,730
I'm just flying into them.

779
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,110
Wapig wait for us!

780
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,670
Wapig just wait for us Wapig!

781
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,850
Wait for us!

782
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,170
Is he stimming back?

783
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,530
Is he stimming back to us?

784
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:18,810
Where is he?

785
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,670
Where are they?

786
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:22,370
Oh...

787
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,540
There they are.

788
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,140
Alright let's go.

789
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,100
I'm ready to pick up your banners guys.

790
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,020
He's right on the respawn beacon.

791
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,340
Even if MRB doesn't take it, he still doesn't take it.

792
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,860
This guy just attacks game and attacks.

793
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,760
Might or might on the respawn beacon.

794
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
No, he's not.

795
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:47,620
He's right here.

796
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,120
Three times a charm guys.

797
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,340
I'm almost here guys.

798
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,640
I'm almost here.

799
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,460
That's not mine.

800
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,000
I can't shoot them because they decided to start crafting.

801
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,800
So I can't see them.

802
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,620
Well I might be...

803
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,200
I couldn't run from that!

804
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,380
Holy fuck.

805
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,500
I'm stunned.

806
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,560
Oh that's the last guy.

807
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,780
Where is he?

808
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,920
Where is he?

809
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I'm a gold Mozambique guys.

810
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,740
Where is the guy that's chasing you?

811
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,100
Probably just chasing me.

812
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,160
No he's not.

813
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,400
I was trying to find him.

814
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
Oh where did you see him?

815
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,200
New team, new team, new team.

816
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,820
Oh I had a 416.

817
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,400
You know I'm just gonna run.

818
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,360
I'm just gonna run and heal.

819
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,220
Yeah I'm going too.

820
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,400
I'm hitting people.

821
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,860
Oh I cracked people to my left.

822
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,940
I cracked like a ton of people over here.

823
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,300
They're shooting each other.

824
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,140
Yeah they're like super low.

825
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,520
I'm still kill leader.

826
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,980
Oh my god.

827
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,240
There's two guys over there.

828
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,690
Oh my god stop!

829
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,130
Well they're both cracked.

830
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,110
Yeah they are.

831
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,130
This guy's not cracked you liar.

832
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,450
He was cracked.

833
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,050
I got hit in the troop.

834
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,650
Well there's only one guy.

835
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,670
It's only one guy yeah.

836
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,250
He's right here.

837
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,090
I think he's controller.

838
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,250
He's like mega beamed.

839
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,170
You're fine you're mega.

840
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,870
What the fuck?

841
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,790
What are these sevens though?

842
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,730
He got this!

843
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,270
Look at that.

844
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,490
Wait they rez!

845
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,570
I'm gonna leave you.

846
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,290
You have gold armor.

847
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:49,670
Gold armor.

848
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,050
Gold armor.

849
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,470
Gold armor?

850
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,330
I love you.

851
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,010
Where?

852
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,690
Up above.

853
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,370
He's one.

854
00:36:59,490 --> 00:36:59,670
He's one.

855
00:36:59,730 --> 00:36:59,930
He's one.

856
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,210
He's one.

857
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,730
That guy's low.

858
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,230
That guy's low.

859
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,010
That guy's low.

860
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,830
You're solo though.

861
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,830
What the fuck there's another team shooting him.

862
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,190
No that's Wapig.

863
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,850
No the other guys are rezzing.

864
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,650
The other guys are rezzing.

865
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,850
There was a scan from over there.

866
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,230
Wapig's got this.

867
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,670
Wapig's got this.

868
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,730
I don't have a secondary gun.

869
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,910
Oh what the hell?

870
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,690
There he is.

871
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,330
Yeah.

872
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,450
He's low.

873
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:27,690
Where?

874
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,570
Oh I'm gonna shot him to my left.

875
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,330
I got him.

876
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,250
I got him.

877
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,810
I don't know where the Wraith is.

878
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,510
I don't know where the Wraith is.

879
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,390
I don't have a secondary gun.

880
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,170
This is like my warm up game.

881
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,270
This is like my warm up game.

882
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,310
I don't know where the Wraith went.

883
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,450
Oh there she is.

884
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,930
Is it a Wraith?

885
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:50,470
Yeah.

886
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,170
I thought it was a low bomb.

887
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,010
Oh well.

888
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,470
Oh my god how did we live?

889
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,650
What the fuck?

890
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,570
How did we live?

891
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,650
We did it.

892
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,190
We did it.

893
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,030
Oh here's the gold P20.

894
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,430
Where's the gold P20?

895
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,450
Oh did you take it?

896
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:16,610
Oh.

897
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,710
Oh my god look at all these...

898
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,690
Yeah I gotta take this mose down too.

899
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,370
Is it tomato power?

900
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,270
Yeah there's one team left.

901
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:30,590
I'm gonna let him.

902
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,010
Where's the last team?

903
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,130
Ellie!

904
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,710
Thank you so much for the subscription!

905
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,350
To tier one!

906
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,070
Thank you!

907
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,490
Thank you!

908
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,290
Can we get some work done?

909
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,550
Can we get some work done?

910
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,630
Can we get some work done?

911
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,710
Thank you!

912
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,070
Thank you!

913
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,310
Oh by the way...

914
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,830
I don't think Doki's healed up.

915
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,730
Oh shit!

916
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,090
I was not!

917
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,450
The one died.

918
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,330
Oh shit.

919
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,350
No this is...

920
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,070
Knock one of them.

921
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,870
I ulted right side.

922
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:07,970
Oh.

923
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,770
I'm gonna hug you.

924
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,850
This is my ult.

925
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,130
Oh.

926
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,810
Here's the last guy.

927
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,350
We're gonna see.

928
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,370
What?

929
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,530
I can't see anything cause someone threw a grenade.

930
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,030
Oh me too.

931
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,270
I have... He's one though.

932
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,050
He's dead.

933
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:27,330
Oh!

934
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,130
Hey buddy.

935
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:30,990
Heyyyyy.

936
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:31,630
No!

937
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,770
I didn't shoot him.

938
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,670
I didn't hit him.

939
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,190
You fuck.

940
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,430
I saw a P20.

941
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,090
I saw a P20 in my system.

942
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,610
Yeah but I didn't hit him.

943
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,710
I did not hit him.

944
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,890
I did not hit him.

945
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,130
I didn't lock the gate.

946
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,930
It's time to be a tomato.

947
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,250
It's time to be a tomato.

948
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,270
I should have just inted.

949
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,510
I should have picked you guys up.

950
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:52,950
It's time.

951
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,070
It's tomato time.

952
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,110
It's tomato time.

953
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,790
Alright that was a good first game actually.

954
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,390
I have not played Apex in so long.

955
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,370
I was whipping shots all around.

956
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,110
But I guess it's time to be a tomato.

957
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,670
Alright guys.

958
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,770
Let me unzip my skin suit real quick.

959
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,330
I am not.

960
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,410
Let me unzip my skin suit for you guys.

961
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,350
Alright.

962
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,370
Alright.

963
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:30,790
Okay guys.

964
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,290
Okay guys.

965
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,910
More frames.

966
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,490
More frames.

967
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,670
It's tomato time.

968
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,110
It's tomato time.

969
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,030
Let's look it go.

970
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,330
I have unzipped the skin suit.

971
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,730
It was getting way too sweaty down there.

972
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,470
It was getting...

973
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,550
I can't do it, Heartfelt.

974
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,610
I don't have it here.

975
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,290
I don't have it set up for Apex.

976
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,450
I'll do it later, okay?

977
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,250
You know what?

978
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,390
What is a nice tomato character, guys?

979
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,230
Thank you so much in the rain.

980
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,910
Welcome to the tomato farm.

981
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,410
Welcome to the tomato farm.

982
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,030
Welcome to the tomato farm.

983
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,110
I am a tomatobetuber.

984
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,530
What did you do?

985
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,830
What do you mean?

986
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,890
We all have a tomato inside us.

987
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,330
Just unzip yourself, you liars.

988
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,350
Perfect rain timing.

989
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,130
Perfect rain timing.

990
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,990
This rain timing was impeccable.

991
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,970
This is the tomato within...

992
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,050
Wrong rate stream tomato.

993
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,690
What do you mean?

994
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,610
Guys, we all have a tomato inside of us.

995
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,210
You guys want to see me do a little shimmy?

996
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,490
My dance at tomato town.

997
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,080
Oh, I'm dead.

998
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,160
Mr. Tomato is dead.

999
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,840
I'm dead.

1000
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,960
This game is garbage.

1001
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,220
What happened?

1002
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,940
I clicked the R9 and...

1003
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,280
It's okay!

1004
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,440
I'm alive!

1005
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,140
The tomato is alive!

1006
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
Do you want to play?

1007
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,980
I have no heals.

1008
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,360
No shields.

1009
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,740
I'm very confused and scared why I'm enjoying it exactly.

1010
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,120
Don't worry, I'm farming damage.

1011
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,480
Naked and afraid, that's all we are.

1012
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,680
How much can you make the tomato dance?

1013
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,300
I'll do it for free.

1014
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,000
100.

1015
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,460
I'm not gonna...

1016
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,200
Pop, pop, pop!

1017
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,100
This guy?

1018
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,880
Okay, there we go.

1019
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,420
Thank you so much for the follow, Zinian HNXpired.

1020
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,580
Thank you, thank you, and Poseidon.

1021
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,080
Thank you so much!

1022
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,460
This tomato is gaming!

1023
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,020
I'm a tomato gamer.

1024
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,860
Wait, is everyone dead?

1025
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,760
Where are they?

1026
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,740
Oh, okay.

1027
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,120
I was...

1028
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,800
I was dancing.

1029
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,780
What the f...

1030
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,960
That's those balls.

1031
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,120
Yeah, but they...

1032
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,460
It's like a mirage ball, basically.

1033
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,400
This is gaming!

1034
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,580
This is true gaming experience!

1035
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,660
What the f...

1036
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,280
I mean...

1037
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,740
I think they're like at salvage or something.

1038
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,280
I'm gonna go to 20.

1039
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,080
I need like heals.

1040
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,140
Our gamers unite.

1041
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,640
I got the sweet times for you.

1042
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,180
One of you guys.

1043
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,100
So, do they just appear at random?

1044
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,040
Make your tomato sweat so much you can feel not one, but two last swimming pools.

1045
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,620
Exactly.

1046
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,100
Exactly.

1047
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,020
I am coming over.

1048
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,900
Hey, senor!

1049
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,520
Hey, senor!

1050
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,160
Welcome to tomato gaming.

1051
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I am... I fucked up my looting.

1052
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,580
Oh, weaponry is so far already.

1053
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,400
Oh, weaponry is so far already.

1054
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,220
I was confused.

1055
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,620
I thought he was with us.

1056
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,140
Why are you a tomato?

1057
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,820
Why am I not a tomato?

1058
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,420
Our servants got a tomato farm for a reason!

1059
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:15,700
Our servants got a tomato farm for a reason!

1060
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,500
I am a tomato farm.

1061
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,510
Would you guys swim in a swimming pool that's just filled with tomato juice?

1062
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,910
I am a tomato farm.

1063
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,170
How the tomato juice was obtained, I will never tell.

1064
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,450
I will follow Daniel.

1065
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,270
Thank you, thank you.

1066
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,730
So, why isn't there a hammer point on the pit lane?

1067
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,110
Why are you a tomato?

1068
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,670
Exactly.

1069
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,190
Wait, did you kill all of them?

1070
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,110
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

1071
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,110
What?

1072
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,230
He didn't.

1073
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,650
Oh, oh, I got one!

1074
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,050
Bye!

1075
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,650
I believe.

1076
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,830
I don't have any heals.

1077
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,550
I have to fucking get armor real quick.

1078
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,870
This shit is broken.

1079
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,730
What the hell?

1080
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,630
So this P20 is actually broken.

1081
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,630
We all shed our skin suits.

1082
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,470
We're all tomatoes.

1083
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:15,470
Shed that skin suit!

1084
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,730
What do you need skin for?

1085
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,730
It's time to embrace tomato.

1086
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:19,930
No!

1087
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,550
Are you ready to bar the tomato from me?

1088
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,450
He's my cousin.

1089
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,650
Three times removed.

1090
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,750
What the fuck is this?

1091
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,590
Cause it's April Fools.

1092
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,090
25 damage per shot.

1093
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,650
The mage is just stretching out tomato children.

1094
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,050
I'm just gonna grab a second P20.

1095
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,570
Shed the skins, embrace the tomatoes.

1096
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,470
Oh!

1097
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,050
Wait, what the fuck?

1098
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:47,750
I'm gonna kill you.

1099
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:50,070
No!

1100
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:50,850
What the fuck?

1101
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,010
How dare you?

1102
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:56,850
I am a tomato.

1103
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,890
Get punched by a tomat.

1104
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,150
See if you can get 8x7.

1105
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:05,870
Did he have friends?

1106
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,450
I have no idea.

1107
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,290
Did I thirst him?

1108
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,110
No, no, he died.

1109
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,570
I wanted to go for this fight.

1110
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,370
Why he's skin suit?

1111
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:17,310
Oh fuck.

1112
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,070
I don't know, I saw that.

1113
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,570
No you didn't.

1114
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,970
So I get 25 bullets.

1115
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,510
And each bullet does 25 damage.

1116
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,210
What?

1117
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:28,890
What is?

1118
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,010
Are you talking about the P20 or the bozom?

1119
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,690
Gotta drink chug jugs of tomato V8 to become a true gamer.

1120
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,850
Just eat your tomato children.

1121
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,190
I'm running double tweet P20 right now.

1122
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,050
It's so stupid.

1123
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,790
It's called survival of the fittest.

1124
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,670
Every child...

1125
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,510
Every tomato child I eat I get stronger.

1126
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,410
I am.

1127
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:46,650
I am.

1128
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:47,590
Two of them.

1129
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,390
Wait, on my right.

1130
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,670
He's hiding in the corner.

1131
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,550
What the fuck?

1132
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,810
How to shoot bad guys.

1133
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,730
I'm so far.

1134
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,190
I'm so far.

1135
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,050
That's it.

1136
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,630
Dude is literally above you.

1137
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,980
One guy left.

1138
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,840
Yeah, I got him.

1139
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:03,720
Pop.

1140
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,900
I just think he's onto the prime.

1141
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,620
Can we get some fun things real quick?

1142
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,000
Look how the pack is like getting rid of it out there.

1143
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,420
Can we get some fun things real quick for us?

1144
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,380
I like the suppose that Wapix said I know, I know.

1145
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,240
And then he just comes down and dies.

1146
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,360
Yeah, cause there's another fucking guy just hiding in the corner.

1147
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
Like what the fuck?

1148
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,680
All these corner sittings.

1149
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,660
He wasn't batting.

1150
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,200
Tomato emotes after pining.

1151
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,460
Of course we're gonna have tomato emotes.

1152
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,360
You think I'm an amateur?

1153
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,940
I looked at him.

1154
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,540
He's just sitting there in R3-1 and he doesn't move after he shot me.

1155
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,300
Like a normal human being.

1156
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,420
No, he's just sitting there.

1157
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,180
It's okay.

1158
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,900
It's okay.

1159
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,460
It's okay.

1160
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,120
We're here now.

1161
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,520
He's gone.

1162
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,480
He's gone.

1163
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,820
The Batman's gone now.

1164
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,600
He can't hurt you no more.

1165
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,580
Don't get on Doki's show.

1166
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,860
You're tomato children.

1167
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,440
I'm playing like this.

1168
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,360
Doki's looking at you like it's normal.

1169
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,580
You like what you see guys?

1170
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,600
You like what you see?

1171
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,920
Should I take off my human suit more often?

1172
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,580
Why am I running into the zone?

1173
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,990
I love my little shimmy too.

1174
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,670
I think that's my favorite part.

1175
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,810
When I take off my skin suit.

1176
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,730
I love the little shimmy I can do for you guys.

1177
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,590
I love the little shimmy I can do for you guys.

1178
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:30,690
I love the little shimmy I can do for you guys.

1179
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,690
Maybe it'll be a tinier tomato.

1180
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,350
Oh shit.

1181
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,150
That's where they are.

1182
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:34,670
Oh shit.

1183
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:34,670
That's where they are.

1184
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:36,590
He's like...

1185
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,230
He made a portal for his teammates.

1186
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,430
Don't worry guys!

1187
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,110
He's flesh.

1188
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,330
Don't worry I have speed.

1189
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,010
Oh he hit me.

1190
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,770
He hit me!

1191
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,180
That's illegal.

1192
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,440
Here's to him for me.

1193
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,810
I don't like this.

1194
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,010
So much...

1195
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,710
All that flash.

1196
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:11,330
But you forgot that blood in all games is just tomato ketchup.

1197
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:12,910
So technically you're killing your brethren.

1198
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:13,530
So?

1199
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,830
I eat my brethren too.

1200
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,350
Watch out for the big one.

1201
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,310
That's what they get in the name of tomato finisher.

1202
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,750
I don't know.

1203
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,150
Looking pretty saucy there.

1204
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,590
Thanks.

1205
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,870
It's called tomato juices.

1206
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,620
Tomato juice camel is the right stuff.

1207
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,960
Every tomato I consume might get stronger.

1208
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,840
Feed your children to me.

1209
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,050
Become tomato reduce hitbox income bro.

1210
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,790
Become tomato reduce hitbox income bro.

1211
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,550
I'm not a U-turn.

1212
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,610
Well it's not really a U-turn.

1213
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,270
We're so of I'm right behind you guys but 30 seconds away.

1214
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,550
Human doki is a thief.

1215
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,370
Tomato doki is a cannibal.

1216
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:12,750
Why not both?

1217
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,990
I can be both.

1218
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,610
I'm trying to keep up with Wapik but he keeps stimming.

1219
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:16,810
Of course.

1220
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,030
How am I doing so well right now?

1221
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,830
I am not paying attention to my game.

1222
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:26,170
I am not paying attention to my game.

1223
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,710
I have a keep 20 and a Mozambique.

1224
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,670
Maybe as soon as I take out my weapon.

1225
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:32,590
My skin suit.

1226
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,050
I get stronger.

1227
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,410
Who would have thought?

1228
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,610
I guess I was getting too hot in there.

1229
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,150
It's tomato.

1230
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,770
Where are the needles and meatballs?

1231
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,850
Wait guys!

1232
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,710
Tomat is coming.

1233
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,750
They're like over there.

1234
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,490
Wait.

1235
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,030
I was shooting the wrong guy.

1236
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,570
Wait I'm getting shot by a new team.

1237
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:02,990
There's a new team.

1238
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,290
I only have smalls.

1239
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:06,550
Yeah but there's a new team.

1240
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,390
I'm ulting that team to the left.

1241
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,290
Doesn't it look great that the level 21 with the Spitfire wins?

1242
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,790
I don't know if they rez though.

1243
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:15,690
He has a Spitfire.

1244
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,370
I don't know.

1245
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,030
I downed one guy but I think they rez.

1246
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,910
Oh yep I downed him.

1247
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:23,230
Oh!

1248
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,570
You killed the Spitfire.

1249
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:28,790
Don't worry you're fine.

1250
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:29,370
Yeah!

1251
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,670
I'm going to go with the Spitfire.

1252
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:34,950
Crack this guy.

1253
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:36,850
Give me a second.

1254
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,210
Well we're having a redo.

1255
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,230
It's just I'm showing my true form.

1256
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,710
Okay I'm queuing up.

1257
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:44,210
I'm going to rest my ass.

1258
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:46,590
Isn't that how we do it?

1259
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,550
Yeah I'm coming with you guys.

1260
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,890
I want to be safe too.

1261
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,850
I want to feel safe.

1262
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,830
Oh there's another team.

1263
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,010
Yeah I downed one guy from one of the team.

1264
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,670
Tomato kill leader!

1265
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,070
The power of tomato VTubers.

1266
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,430
The power of tomato VTubers.

1267
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,670
The power of tomato VTubers.

1268
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,910
Okay Wapik I'm going for it.

1269
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:11,450
Okay Wapik I'm going for it.

1270
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,570
But yeah we're all tomatoes.

1271
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,930
Everyone wants some potatoes.

1272
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,350
Fake tomatoes.

1273
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,290
Fake tomatoes.

1274
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,590
Maybe I should become tomato.

1275
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,490
Then I'll truly be cracked at Apex.

1276
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,390
What if we're all tomatoes all along though?

1277
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,350
You just gotta take off your skin suit guys.

1278
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,950
Or come work at my tomato farm.

1279
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:38,230
And then you can be as good as Apex like me.

1280
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:40,490
Take off your skin suit.

1281
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,510
It's like the Adamo move where a character was wearing weights and removes them.

1282
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,310
You might want to grab a mastiff.

1283
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,650
Nah I'm fine.

1284
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,150
The era of C-Tubers is over.

1285
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,190
It's vegetable tubers now!

1286
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,530
Oh that's the guy we killed.

1287
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,230
I killed earlier.

1288
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,770
I told you it's fine.

1289
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,250
Give yourself a big and red one.

1290
00:52:59,330 --> 00:52:59,690
What?

1291
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,330
I'm going to kill you guys.

1292
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,010
Are we going to push that?

1293
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:04,830
Yeah sure.

1294
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,750
Alright you go first.

1295
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,850
VeggieTales were the first vegetable tubers.

1296
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,530
Oh I hear them.

1297
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,010
They almost fucked on me.

1298
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,230
It's right here.

1299
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,830
I don't know if they're going to come out.

1300
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,110
Holy shit!

1301
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,410
He cheated!

1302
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,270
He cheated!

1303
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:28,310
No!

1304
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,150
He's angry because I killed him last time.

1305
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:37,610
He cheated!

1306
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,030
He's going to take my shit!

1307
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,250
Alright Wapig is gone.

1308
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,070
Wapig is...

1309
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,030
How dare they get...

1310
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,570
How dare they get high ground!

1311
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,850
I live on the...

1312
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,880
I can't reach that.

1313
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,160
I'm so sorry.

1314
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,360
I'm going to be part of the fruit gang.

1315
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,580
God damn!

1316
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,100
God damn!

1317
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,460
Fake vegetables!

1318
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,900
I just gotta return...

1319
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,740
Alright Merino!

1320
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,040
Alright Rez me!

1321
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,240
Rez me!

1322
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,460
Where is the tomato?

1323
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,880
Hold on...

1324
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,860
We don't need Wapig.

1325
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,300
We can win this without him.

1326
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,340
Wapig is going to come in and die.

1327
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,480
This thing is...

1328
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,460
This thing is skying people in their life.

1329
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,920
Damn.

1330
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,580
Feed me more- Don't worry chat, you feed me more tomato children.

1331
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,920
I'll get bigger.

1332
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,900
It's hard living that rooted life of a vegetable.

1333
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,040
Truly is.

1334
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,520
But I gotta get ready.

1335
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:50,860
Alright!

1336
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,580
Alright Omni, thanks for hitting all of us!

1337
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,040
Even though you were just looking, thank you!

1338
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,500
I hope you have a good night's rest.

1339
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,420
Have a good stream, thank you!

1340
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,500
I hope you have a good night's rest, Omni.

1341
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,820
Tomato capitalism to enhance the power, exactly.

1342
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,700
Why do you think I have a tomato farm?

1343
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,000
I eat my children.

1344
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,340
Only the strongest tomato can survive, exactly.

1345
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,720
Survival of the fittest was created just for tomatoes like me.

1346
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,420
I'm gonna get armor, real quick.

1347
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,230
Alright, I have...

1348
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,910
Dumb guns right now.

1349
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,110
Well, I have an RE45, it's alright.

1350
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,610
To be cracked at APC, you pass a tomato trap, eating all your brethren.

1351
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:57,570
Exactly.

1352
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,900
Alright, I'm heading over.

1353
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,260
Has no one- Has no squad died yet since I got rez?

1354
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,400
Nope.

1355
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,820
They just keep rezzing each other.

1356
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,880
It's really weird.

1357
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,120
Woah, woah, wee, woah!

1358
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,260
It's like that.

1359
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,080
Maybe the damage farm is on the shore.

1360
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,480
Damage farm?

1361
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,020
Damage farm is in the pub.

1362
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,620
Oh wait, no, of course you- Oh wait, never mind.

1363
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,060
Everyone damage farms in the pub.

1364
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,800
Gotta queue down, gotta queue down and it's like really low.

1365
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,320
I'm just leading a bit more.

1366
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,650
Do not worry!

1367
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,250
I have nothing!

1368
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,710
I'm gonna take this.

1369
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,670
Oh, it's Suki!

1370
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,590
It's Suki-chan!

1371
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,210
It's a full box there now.

1372
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,110
Alright, they're fighting.

1373
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,030
The last two teams are fighting.

1374
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,250
Yeah, take that box, take that box, take that box.

1375
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,310
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1376
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:48,510
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1377
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:48,510
Okay, okay, okay.

1378
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,610
We gotta go to the last squad after.

1379
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:50,810
Yeah.

1380
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,110
Careful for your health.

1381
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,030
Oh shit, my health.

1382
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,290
Yeah, yeah, I'm medkitting it in.

1383
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,490
You go in first, I'll clean up later.

1384
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,130
Oh, they finished.

1385
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,370
They finished.

1386
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,010
I think it's a 1v3.

1387
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,050
It's a 2v3.

1388
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,080
I'm almost there.

1389
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,700
Oh shit!

1390
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,480
Wait, one's above, one's above.

1391
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,360
They're all above.

1392
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,040
They have 74 on them.

1393
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,820
74 on the other- Oh no.

1394
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,380
They're gonna heal.

1395
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,240
Yeah, they're gonna heal, what the fuck?

1396
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,020
I don't have any- I don't have any-

1397
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,780
Oh, they're gonna rez...

1398
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,600
I fucking knew it.

1399
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Fuck you guys.

1400
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:45,940
Your yeast yourself, does that mean you keep going back and not gain any size?

1401
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,400
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1402
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,800
I would anyone eat themselves?

1403
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,720
I have a farm.

1404
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,500
I'm never gonna run out of food.

1405
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,140
Well, looks like we lost.

1406
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,640
Hmm.

1407
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,760
Do I go back?

1408
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,160
I guess I have to put back my skin suit on because we didn't win.

1409
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:09,840
Unfortunate.

1410
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,660
Let me zip up my skin suit real quick chat.

1411
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,420
Hey guys.

1412
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,080
Hey guys.

1413
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,820
Hey everyone, what did I miss?

1414
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,300
What did I miss chat?

1415
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,300
No, my true tomato farm.

1416
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,580
What do you mean?

1417
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,460
This is my true farm.

1418
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,680
What are you guys talking about?

1419
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:53,640
Huh?

1420
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,820
What are you guys talking about chat?

1421
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,560
This is my true farm.

1422
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:58,560
Huh?

1423
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,960
You missed nothing.

1424
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,680
Now you eat your slime.

1425
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,300
This is a turkey.

1426
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,020
I know.

1427
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,160
What do you mean guys?

1428
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,780
I've always been like this.

1429
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,480
What are you guys talking about?

1430
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,120
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

1431
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,430
There goes the tomato.

1432
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,890
What are you guys talking about chat?

1433
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,130
I've always been like this.

1434
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:36,830
Huh?

1435
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,010
Who is this bot when I recognize nothing?

1436
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,020
What do you mean?

1437
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,580
I've always been the dokiyano.

1438
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,460
The thief.

1439
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,200
Right?

1440
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,960
The thief that for some reason owns a tomato farm.

1441
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,000
Because she does honest living.

1442
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,580
Nope, she doesn't consume her children.

1443
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,500
I make an honest living selling tomatoes.

1444
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,040
Oh.

1445
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,740
Who are you and what did you do to my tomato?

1446
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,640
Oh, nothing in the back.

1447
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:31,950
Alright, well looks like we need a win if we wanna unzip the skins.

1448
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,210
Oh, well goodbye.

1449
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,050
I got one of them.

1450
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,290
Alright, I'm coming guys.

1451
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,250
Don't worry.

1452
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,010
Do not worry.

1453
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,410
I'm almost there.

1454
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,910
Are you rising yet?

1455
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:52,090
There is only one.

1456
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:52,630
Oh.

1457
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,590
I did it.

1458
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:57,910
There is armor here.

1459
01:00:58,550 --> 01:00:59,810
I think they are on the other side.

1460
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,950
Yeah.

1461
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,930
I don't... I didn't get the kill.

1462
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,570
Why did he crawl?

1463
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,110
Oh, there he is.

1464
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:08,870
Twitch.

1465
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:09,790
Yo-Yo.

1466
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:10,530
There are people on me.

1467
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:12,970
Alright, I'm rotating.

1468
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,590
Rotating.

1469
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:15,630
They are like here.

1470
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,090
They are here too.

1471
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:17,690
On the outside.

1472
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:19,310
Yeah.

1473
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:21,150
I'm gonna see if I can get them to...

1474
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:23,270
60.

1475
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,730
Cracked him.

1476
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:24,590
Behind here.

1477
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,990
They are like outside.

1478
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:29,930
Are you serious?

1479
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:30,710
Yeah.

1480
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,130
Right here.

1481
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:31,630
1HP.

1482
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:32,430
1HP on this kit.

1483
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:33,730
Peek me.

1484
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,510
Oh, he didn't peek me.

1485
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,990
He knew.

1486
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,270
He is not fun.

1487
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,520
Come on.

1488
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,240
Oh, okay.

1489
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:48,760
Fuck you.

1490
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:49,840
Alright, I'm coming to you guys.

1491
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:50,900
Nice.

1492
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,780
His teammate is right here with me.

1493
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,700
Is this the song of the century here in the bag?

1494
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,480
Banana LG.

1495
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,400
I don't even know what song he is playing to be honest.

1496
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,100
Oh, he is right here now.

1497
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,700
Where are you running, sir?

1498
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:05,520
Sir?

1499
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,680
Why are you running?

1500
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,380
I think he is going to get his banner.

1501
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:10,640
Sir?

1502
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,320
Sir?

1503
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:15,940
I hear him.

1504
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,560
Is he pressing?

1505
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,440
Inside?

1506
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:18,820
Oh, no.

1507
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,500
He is so dead.

1508
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:22,940
Wait.

1509
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,960
Hey, sir.

1510
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,120
I wasn't good.

1511
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:28,960
Wait.

1512
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,020
Where is he going?

1513
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:29,200
He is running.

1514
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,540
He is like a...

1515
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,040
Wait.

1516
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:31,400
He has...

1517
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:31,940
He has teammates.

1518
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,340
He has teammates?

1519
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,760
He has friends?

1520
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,180
Above us, it is a different team now.

1521
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,380
Wait.

1522
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,140
What?

1523
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,340
What?

1524
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,880
He had purple armor, didn't he?

1525
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:44,780
Yeah, he did.

1526
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,780
And now he doesn't.

1527
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,300
Well, how am I looking at?

1528
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,240
How does he...

1529
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,940
Where did his purple armor go?

1530
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,880
On my body!

1531
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,160
Wait, did you have blue?

1532
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,160
Yeah, it's on my body.

1533
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,680
I earned it.

1534
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,200
Oh, shit.

1535
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,140
There's a...

1536
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,080
Where is his friends?

1537
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,360
I don't know, but I'm gonna get this golden archery one in this middle.

1538
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,420
What are those?

1539
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,640
What are those?

1540
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,740
Will we ever find his friends?

1541
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,140
And it doesn't pick up.

1542
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,120
That's my favorite feature about this game.

1543
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,960
Wait, I need... wait, this gold mozant doesn't have a hop-up?

1544
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,920
No, but it still does like 500 damage.

1545
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,520
Oh, shit, really?

1546
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:28,800
Oh.

1547
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,920
Oh, wait, I hear people read this way.

1548
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,340
The P20.

1549
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,560
The P20 doesn't have a hop-up, but it does 25 damage per shot.

1550
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:36,600
Yeah, yeah.

1551
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,080
We only use gold mozams.

1552
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,500
So it's like hammer points without the hammer points.

1553
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,140
I'm so lost where the other person is.

1554
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,980
Yeah, I'm so lost where his friends are.

1555
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,880
I'm just living for the other squad.

1556
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,440
We need...

1557
01:03:55,620 --> 01:04:02,660
Give us... chat, give me your strength so we can be reborn as a... so I can take off my skin suit.

1558
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,100
Every game we win, I take off the skin suit.

1559
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,260
They're like above.

1560
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,240
Let's go this way.

1561
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,700
I hear map room.

1562
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,280
I hear map room scan graphic.

1563
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:14,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1564
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,840
I'm going over now.

1565
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,140
Wait, you're going to the other squad?

1566
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:20,620
Yeah, cause they're fighting.

1567
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,300
Oh, okay.

1568
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,520
I guess I'll go over there.

1569
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,300
I don't wanna one-way tree, so I'll just go, I guess.

1570
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,060
I think it was great.

1571
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,000
We...

1572
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,040
Why not?

1573
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,660
We consumed some tomato children.

1574
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,980
No, I stopped shooting.

1575
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,240
Fuck.

1576
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:33,780
Yes.

1577
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:34,340
Yes.

1578
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,180
Fluffy, yes.

1579
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,400
Flutters seems to release the tomato.

1580
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,960
Wow, I just can't aim.

1581
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,760
Not yet tomato doki yet.

1582
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,360
Okay, by the time we get there... Oh, no!

1583
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,260
You got killed by a TTPer!

1584
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,600
They didn't swap my guns, instead they just punched.

1585
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,820
Is he up there?

1586
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,380
No, I think he shot him from below.

1587
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,280
Oh, yep, never mind.

1588
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:04,560
Quacked him.

1589
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,000
I ulted.

1590
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,340
Smoking.

1591
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,260
Mmm, I hear the octane.

1592
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,720
Get up there.

1593
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:13,920
Get up there.

1594
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:15,900
I don't know where...

1595
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,000
I don't know, I'm sticking to it.

1596
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,260
Take it, take it, take it, I got it.

1597
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,360
He's low, yeah?

1598
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,820
I'm gonna heal now.

1599
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:27,320
Bye.

1600
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,800
Derset, Derset him.

1601
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,180
Wait, he took the zip out.

1602
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:30,700
He took the zip out.

1603
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,280
Cracked the bus house.

1604
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,560
Do not worry, sirs!

1605
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,420
Wait, what?

1606
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,660
Where did he go?

1607
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,440
Where did his teammate go?

1608
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,060
Downstairs.

1609
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,380
I guess he's... yeah, he's downstairs.

1610
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,920
Yeah, he's downstairs.

1611
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,360
Yeah, I'm gonna loot.

1612
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,860
I hear him healing.

1613
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:51,840
He's healing.

1614
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:52,880
He's right here.

1615
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,140
Or was that my shadow?

1616
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,180
No, no, he's inside healing somewhere.

1617
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,360
Woo, where are you?

1618
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,220
He's somewhere here.

1619
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:03,740
He's somewhere here.

1620
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,550
I'm like, looking everywhere.

1621
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,890
I'm in a Twitch stream right now.

1622
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,570
He finally left.

1623
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,790
I'm over here trying to make friends, and he just doesn't want to make friends.

1624
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:19,430
He does not.

1625
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,010
He's crazy, that's why.

1626
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:22,570
He's crazy.

1627
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:27,230
Like, I look at him, T-bag, and then he's like, nope, I shoot you.

1628
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:34,230
You'll get friends eventually, Wapiki, you'll get friends eventually.

1629
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,170
I'm just kidding.

1630
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,850
That octane was crazy though.

1631
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,910
Like, can you get in the game?

1632
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,790
What server are you playing?

1633
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,170
Because any servers are usually populated.

1634
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,130
I don't understand people.

1635
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,570
I'm not shooting them, I'm just looking at them.

1636
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,970
Yeah, but he's like, I'm bringing you down with me.

1637
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,230
What is he gonna do?

1638
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,270
Stay with you?

1639
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:58,370
One more kill.

1640
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,490
I was gonna let him live.

1641
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:01,990
I don't think he...

1642
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,090
I think he wanted to just leave.

1643
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,270
I think he just...

1644
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,850
I was not gonna tell you guys about him.

1645
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,570
I was just gonna be like, oh, he's gone, and make sure he doesn't get discovered.

1646
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:17,830
I have like, uh, I have only syringes in my fucking backpack.

1647
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:20,170
Oh, here, take three batteries.

1648
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,030
I need like, shield cells.

1649
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,670
Here, two bats and four shield cells.

1650
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,570
Oh yeah.

1651
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,230
Oh yeah, I need that.

1652
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,410
Please feed me.

1653
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:30,310
Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,430
Yeah, yeah.

1655
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:34,990
All the heals.

1656
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,010
Oh my, it's been so long since I've caught a stream.

1657
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:37,450
Chaos!

1658
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,730
I am level 47.

1659
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,830
I'm level... I don't even know what level I am.

1660
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,330
I've maxed out a long time ago.

1661
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:49,250
I used to be just fine with my, uh, laptop.

1662
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,610
Yeah, but like, Apex requires...

1663
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,810
Apex is like, so heavy intensive.

1664
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:56,050
Like, GPU and CPU intensive.

1665
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:57,390
Is that a new level?

1666
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,530
It is, cause the game came out a while ago.

1667
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,810
So, hi flu!

1668
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,450
The game came out a while ago, so a lot of people are like, maxed out levels.

1669
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,990
Cause it's been like, what, two years?

1670
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,050
It's on season 8 now.

1671
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:10,490
I don't know.

1672
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,970
Yeah, you can be like, high level and still be garbage at it.

1673
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:18,490
I've bumped into a lot of level 500s who are not the best at this video game.

1674
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,570
But they're having a good time, and that's all that matters.

1675
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:22,250
They're up here.

1676
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,490
Oh, I hear them.

1677
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,700
But no, like, um...

1678
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,440
Oh, they're still fighting.

1679
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,560
Well, you got one in them.

1680
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,260
I am...

1681
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,120
Wapig, do not worry!

1682
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,400
I'm not.

1683
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,820
Do not worry, Wapig!

1684
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,480
This is two squads.

1685
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,500
Do not worry, Wapig!

1686
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,140
Thank you.

1687
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,960
Where's that caustic?

1688
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,040
Oh, he's in here.

1689
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,360
I cracked it.

1690
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:58,720
He's cracked.

1691
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,120
Yeah.

1692
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,520
They're like, to my right.

1693
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:01,940
Oh, he's in here.

1694
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,000
I ulted the people to the right.

1695
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,400
There's a rappel coming in.

1696
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,400
He's dead, but I need...

1697
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,380
I got the armor swap.

1698
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,000
Don't worry, I'm cracking the people to the right.

1699
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,140
I cracked these guys.

1700
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,400
One where?

1701
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,020
Oh, this is a different team.

1702
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,380
There's a team right here, though.

1703
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,840
Flash on one of them.

1704
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,740
Be careful of the team to our right.

1705
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,960
I'll push with...

1706
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,360
I'll push with acid.

1707
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,400
Oh, I messed up my thermite.

1708
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:40,320
Wap!

1709
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,440
Wait, what?

1710
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,540
Where did he go?

1711
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,700
Wait, where is his teammate?

1712
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:50,580
Oh!

1713
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,020
What the fuck?

1714
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:53,420
Where is he?

1715
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:54,320
Oh.

1716
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,280
What the fuck?

1717
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,240
Wait, I'm blocking this.

1718
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,180
What the fuck?

1719
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,380
What the fuck?

1720
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,020
Where is he?

1721
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,480
Below?

1722
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,320
Oh.

1723
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,320
I need help.

1724
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,740
He's one, he's one, he's one!

1725
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,500
Ah!

1726
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,820
Yeah, we're a bit fucked, though.

1727
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,220
I'm gonna drop down here.

1728
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,700
I wanna see him control with my body.

1729
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,760
Maybe my intake is just...

1730
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,040
It's impossible to have just one PC.

1731
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,200
No, it's possible.

1732
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,980
You need like a really good graphics card.

1733
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,400
And a really good CPU.

1734
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,020
Um, it's possible if you don't want...

1735
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,980
Not really good in terms of GPU and CPU, but like...

1736
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,000
Well, I have my model on, so I need like good shit for it.

1737
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,920
But even I get heavy frame drops.

1738
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,500
Cause I drop from 200 to 100.

1739
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,080
Um...

1740
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,640
So, play to have fun.

1741
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,440
Yeah, play to have fun.

1742
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,300
Alright, I'm full of you.

1743
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,260
Get it.

1744
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,040
They're up there, right above us.

1745
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,000
Alright, that's unfortunate.

1746
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,040
I'm taking some names.

1747
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:03,900
Oh, whoa!

1748
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,340
I-I- You pick them up!

1749
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,860
Cause I'm leaving.

1750
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,200
Then mine can go from 60 to 500.

1751
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,420
Ah, console, I see.

1752
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,340
They're gonna follow!

1753
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,160
Tryzora, ApexGamer, and PS4 account.

1754
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:18,800
They're gonna kill!

1755
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,280
They're here.

1756
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,760
Aw, they're like camping.

1757
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,520
I have heat shields.

1758
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,680
Oh, I do not have heat shields.

1759
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,100
Do you have heat shields?

1760
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,800
Is that the Duel Keeper?

1761
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,200
It is!

1762
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,140
This zone is okay, right?

1763
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:34,560
Yeah, it's second.

1764
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,180
I don't have a lot of realize.

1765
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,160
I don't have Medkit, but that's fine.

1766
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,420
We can res him...

1767
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,120
We have to res him here.

1768
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:43,880
Wow.

1769
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,920
I don't have a mobile resp you can hear.

1770
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:46,580
Nope.

1771
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,100
Maybe one of these freaks had one.

1772
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:48,980
No, they didn't.

1773
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,740
They're here, they're here.

1774
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:53,400
I hear them.

1775
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,680
Wait, I think they're fighting.

1776
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,380
Yeah, they're fighting.

1777
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,720
To my left.

1778
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,000
Dugol!

1779
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,180
Thank you so much for the...

1780
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,680
Two months, two months tier one.

1781
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,720
I can't... English hard.

1782
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:09,200
Two months tier one!

1783
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:09,860
Thank you!

1784
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,520
Can I get some Farknights real quick?

1785
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,140
Haha, for Dugol.

1786
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:15,820
Thank you, thank you!

1787
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
I'm just gonna go res.

1788
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,380
Yeah, cause they're fighting right now over here.

1789
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:23,800
Alright.

1790
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,110
Yeah, they're just like...

1791
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,050
They're fighting right here.

1792
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:30,430
I'm just trying to Apex-y.

1793
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:31,790
Hahaha!

1794
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:33,810
Thank you so much for the follow!

1795
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:34,270
Thank you, thank you!

1796
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,310
I do appreciate it.

1797
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:35,850
Thank you so much.

1798
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:42,150
My games are just fun how the F is just not able to play on my laptop.

1799
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,530
I make 3D games.

1800
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:45,070
It's just Apex is very...

1801
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,010
Not very optimized very well.

1802
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,570
It's like very unoptimized.

1803
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:56,910
That's why a lot of people play Apex but they don't stream it.

1804
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,830
Because it's like your frames die very...

1805
01:12:58,830 --> 01:12:59,170
Like...

1806
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:02,030
You get very shit frames when you try to.

1807
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,670
Unless you have a good PC setup.

1808
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,330
But like, even I like...

1809
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,810
No, I'm good.

1810
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,010
Yeah.

1811
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,700
This isn't looted.

1812
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:17,480
So...

1813
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,700
It should be okay here.

1814
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,400
There's like loot here.

1815
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,300
There's a blue arm here.

1816
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,560
I'm coming over.

1817
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,280
Knock one.

1818
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,320
I am almost here.

1819
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,840
Where's his teammate?

1820
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,500
Down there.

1821
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,740
45 on the caustic.

1822
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,260
I hear...

1823
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,120
Bloodhound.

1824
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,040
I'm burning one of them.

1825
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,440
Bloodhound's burning.

1826
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:49,760
Oh shit!

1827
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,840
I thought that was you!

1828
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,420
That's last guy.

1829
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,160
Caustic maxed.

1830
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:55,920
Yeah.

1831
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,120
There we go.

1832
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:00,140
Nice.

1833
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,060
There's like stuff for you here.

1834
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,380
I had a Spitfire.

1835
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,080
I was okay.

1836
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,820
No yeah, Apex run perfectly fine.

1837
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,760
Maximum even while streamed.

1838
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,500
But you wanna lowest on stream.

1839
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,960
Yeah, you just can't...

1840
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,460
It's very hard to run it with stream stuff.

1841
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,520
Last two teams are fighting, right?

1842
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,120
Yeah.

1843
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,780
I'm just...

1844
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:25,940
I'm just trying to Apex.

1845
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:28,840
Oh no.

1846
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,000
He pinged them Wapix.

1847
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,060
So I can throw my ult.

1848
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh.

1849
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,740
Well then.

1850
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,660
My ult is on them.

1851
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:36,960
On me.

1852
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,060
Smoke him.

1853
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:39,580
Smoke him.

1854
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,860
I smoked him.

1855
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,020
Yeah, they're running.

1856
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,300
Oh, they're on me.

1857
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:47,800
What the fuck?

1858
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,440
Stop dying!

1859
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,120
They're on me.

1860
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:53,340
They're on me.

1861
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:53,440
They're on me.

1862
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:57,700
I got one of them.

1863
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,580
Last guy.

1864
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,360
Last guy.

1865
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,360
I have that team.

1866
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,240
Yeah, you died to zone.

1867
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,560
Where's the other team?

1868
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,440
There.

1869
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,780
Is that the full control?

1870
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,580
It is?

1871
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,180
That's unlucky.

1872
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,420
And they have double Spitfire.

1873
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,140
Alright.

1874
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,400
Let's just rez Wapix.

1875
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,340
Wait.

1876
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,760
There's no more rez Vigains.

1877
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:22,140
Wait.

1878
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:22,320
Wait.

1879
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:22,620
Wait.

1880
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:22,800
Wait.

1881
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:22,880
Wait.

1882
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,400
I'm going to Map Room right now.

1883
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,360
I'll rez him.

1884
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:25,840
I'll rez him.

1885
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,360
We're going Map Room?

1886
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,080
Okay.

1887
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:28,580
Okay.

1888
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:28,740
Okay.

1889
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,000
We gotta rez him.

1890
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,220
Wait.

1891
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:31,600
Wait.

1892
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,160
You don't have to go.

1893
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,420
I'll go Map Room and rez him.

1894
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,820
And then I'm ditching him after that.

1895
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:35,980
Just stay alive.

1896
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,410
Try to push updates constantly.

1897
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:46,790
There's a lot of bugs in Apex that they haven't fixed at all.

1898
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:49,290
Like the rank bugs.

1899
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,610
There's so many bugs in Apex that they haven't really fixed.

1900
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:52,610
But they're just like...

1901
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:52,850
Well.

1902
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:54,330
We're still making money.

1903
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:55,870
That's alright.

1904
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,990
I think it's not just Apex.

1905
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,190
A lot of developers do that.

1906
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:02,030
As long as they're still making money.

1907
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,030
Oh.

1908
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:05,230
They're pushing Wapix I think.

1909
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,470
I'm going to smoke them.

1910
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,350
You're going to land it over here.

1911
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:13,250
I'm going to close zone.

1912
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,490
I'm going to close zone.

1913
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:14,550
Oh.

1914
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:14,990
You want to fight?

1915
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:15,850
Oh no.

1916
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,750
We're clocked dead.

1917
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:17,710
Yeah.

1918
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,970
I'm clocked dead.

1919
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,690
I hit him for 55.

1920
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,070
I got one of them.

1921
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,050
Yeah.

1922
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:25,650
I'm self-resing.

1923
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,730
With the ball backpack.

1924
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,510
Yeah.

1925
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,650
But I think they might curse you.

1926
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:29,630
Wait.

1927
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,110
He's behind me?

1928
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:30,970
What the fuck?

1929
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,250
I'm trying to get back to you.

1930
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,290
How is he behind me?

1931
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,490
I'm coming back.

1932
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:38,530
I dropped down accidentally.

1933
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:39,730
Oh.

1934
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:40,130
Okay.

1935
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:41,710
Well I finished one of them.

1936
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,330
Okay.

1937
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:43,870
I'm trying to Apex.

1938
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,190
I can't see him too.

1939
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:50,550
I hit 75 on him.

1940
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:51,670
Oh shit.

1941
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:52,250
What the fuck.

1942
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:52,690
I'm dead.

1943
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:54,750
Wait.

1944
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,030
What?

1945
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,030
I didn't know he was above me.

1946
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:00,030
Peek me.

1947
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:00,630
Come on.

1948
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:01,350
I know you want to peek me.

1949
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:02,110
Oh.

1950
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:02,690
He's not.

1951
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,410
He's trying to...

1952
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:03,650
Yeah.

1953
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:04,470
He got your armor swap.

1954
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:05,670
I'm dead then.

1955
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:07,850
Yeah.

1956
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:09,010
Oh.

1957
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,030
He got your armor swap.

1958
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:17,430
That was... Ah.

1959
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,110
That was close.

1960
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,570
That was close though.

1961
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,750
I was fucking fragging.

1962
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:26,010
My aim was really on point that game which is nice.

1963
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:30,550
That's all me bros.

1964
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:38,250
It's like how Fortnite caters very heavily to little children to buy their skins.

1965
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:42,270
It's like...

1966
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:43,550
It's not just Apex.

1967
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:46,610
It's every other AAA game that can earn money.

1968
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:03,920
Like how they keep making skins of very very many very big streamers and be like, hey guys buy my skin.

1969
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,280
And then the children, kids are like Oh my god!

1970
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,340
You're my favorite streamer!

1971
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,020
I'm gonna buy your skin!

1972
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,580
And then bam.

1973
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,360
We don't have to care about anything else.

1974
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,020
Hahahaha

1975
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:19,220
I played Apex for the first time yesterday and seen Doki play Serial.

1976
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,700
Now that I understand a little more about the game.

1977
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,860
See the zoom.

1978
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,240
It says, wow because I can stream hard find.

1979
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,280
That game looks amazing.

1980
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:26,940
Yeah.

1981
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,240
It's just Apex in general.

1982
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:29,760
Um.

1983
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,980
It's just not optimized for the thing.

1984
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:33,720
Hahaha

1985
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,180
So I need like a very powerful rig.

1986
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,880
Not very powerful, just a very good rig.

1987
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,480
Just to stream Apex and have my model on.

1988
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,340
And also and also be able to pew pew win Apex.

1989
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,460
That's why you see a lot of YouTubers that just run PNGs.

1990
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:05,900
Because like they rather just like have like good frames instead of um instead of like you know pew pew instead of like having the model on.

1991
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:06,100
Okay.

1992
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:06,360
Okay.

1993
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:06,500
Okay.

1994
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,640
Can't wait for tomato Doki skin in Fortnite.

1995
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,640
We almost got our tomatoes tomato form back.

1996
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,800
Also thank you so much for the follow Pineapple.

1997
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,080
Thank you.

1998
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,280
Thank you.

1999
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,380
I really do appreciate it.

2000
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:33,920
Thank you so much.

2001
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:35,860
I'm ready.

2002
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,540
I'm going to fly over to there now.

2003
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:40,420
There was a team here but they Oh, is there?

2004
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,060
No, not anymore.

2005
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,300
They saw the pro trails and were like fucked up.

2006
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,560
You guys want to see where they make the games more parable to play on lower end PC?

2007
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,360
Yeah, this is unfortunate.

2008
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:54,900
Maybe I should use my shitty Apex to stream the game but play the game on my PC that might work.

2009
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:55,860
Yeah, yeah.

2010
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,680
I see them.

2011
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,440
I'm going to snipe that.

2012
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,180
I just got sniped at by... Oh, okay.

2013
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,460
Why does he...

2014
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,420
What the fuck?

2015
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:07,640
Flash.

2016
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,120
Well, I can't do anything about that.

2017
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,060
Well, okay.

2018
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,280
I thought you were going to be...

2019
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,720
You know what?

2020
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,380
It's alright.

2021
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,120
It's okay.

2022
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:16,900
This might be dumb.

2023
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,400
But it's...

2024
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,040
Okay, it's not dumb.

2025
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,720
It was so smart.

2026
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,840
It was so smart.

2027
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:28,210
He's cracked.

2028
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:30,830
Last guy is over here though.

2029
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,830
Yeah, I'm just going to back up.

2030
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:34,230
No.

2031
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:35,470
No, there's another team.

2032
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,310
There's another team on us.

2033
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,490
I have... There's another team over here.

2034
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,650
Oh, yeah.

2035
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:41,270
You're right.

2036
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:45,000
The bubble disappeared.

2037
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:47,700
It's okay.

2038
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,280
He doesn't know.

2039
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,620
He doesn't know.

2040
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:54,800
Idiot!

2041
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:02,090
Alright.

2042
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:03,110
I am safe.

2043
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:08,630
Yeah.

2044
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:09,210
Oh, yeah.

2045
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:11,910
I heard there was a lot of problems with the switch port.

2046
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,050
Why are you still alive?

2047
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,030
Oh, what the fuck?

2048
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:17,810
Alright, he's kidding me right now.

2049
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:18,770
Why is there a body here?

2050
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,410
What the fuck?

2051
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,070
Why are you here?

2052
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:26,030
I mean...

2053
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:28,390
Oh, that's not hot.

2054
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,870
Oh, there's a full... Oh!

2055
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:31,810
Oh!

2056
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:35,110
There's two squad that redeployed to me.

2057
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,710
Oh, okay.

2058
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:44,210
I'm dead.

2059
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:45,890
I just got redeployed.

2060
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,130
It's okay.

2061
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:48,170
Yeah, yeah.

2062
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:49,790
That's what I'm doing.

2063
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:50,470
Bring them over.

2064
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,530
They're still looting my body anyway.

2065
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:57,470
Yeah!

2066
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,130
Bye!

2067
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,980
They're gonna take forever looting this.

2068
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,160
Oh, my God.

2069
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,300
Where is that other team?

2070
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,480
You know, fuck this.

2071
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,700
I don't wanna die to a controller team.

2072
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,140
I'm... Bye.

2073
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,740
I'm not letting them kill me!

2074
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,900
No, you're saying it's too good to die to a controller team.

2075
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,140
Yeah.

2076
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,140
Yes, I am.

2077
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,000
God, I dash.

2078
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,040
Hope everyone has a good day.

2079
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,660
And don't eat too many other tomato presents.

2080
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,520
Can't stop me!

2081
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,400
Good night, though.

2082
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,920
I really appreciate you stopping by and hanging out with us today.

2083
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,860
Hope you have a good rest of the night.

2084
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:45,500
Thank you, thank you!

2085
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,660
Hey, Viva!

2086
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,780
I'm gonna stream for like...

2087
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,380
I'm gonna stream for like...

2088
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:56,480
I'm gonna stream for like...

2089
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,480
I think around like...

2090
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,620
3 or so minutes.

2091
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,200
And we're gonna call it here.

2092
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,600
I told you guys it was gonna be short.

2093
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,400
It is gonna be a short stream today.

2094
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,200
Hi, Juki!

2095
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,820
Let's hope we get like another win.

2096
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,620
So we can be our true selves.

2097
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:12,880
So we can be our true selves.

2098
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,760
Do you speak Japanese?

2099
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,800
I do not.

2100
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,540
I apologize.

2101
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,640
I do not.

2102
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,680
I'm very bad at Japanese.

2103
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,400
I speak a lot of other languages, but Japanese isn't one of them.

2104
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,640
Learning languages is just very hard.

2105
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,220
She's amazing at French.

2106
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:39,600
Ah!

2107
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:40,580
Bonjour!

2108
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,840
No, I swear.

2109
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,540
I'm actually decent at French.

2110
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,320
Ahahaha!

2111
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,060
Otogi only speaks Wee.

2112
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,080
Nope!

2113
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,260
Only wins!

2114
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:57,220
No, I'm not.

2115
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,180
I'm not.

2116
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,080
Unfortunately not.

2117
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:05,580
I speak English, French, Chinese, both Cantonese and Mandarin.

2118
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,760
I speak English, French, Chinese, both Cantonese and Mandarin.

2119
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,640
And um...

2120
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,300
And a bit of Korean.

2121
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:10,800
But not Japanese.

2122
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:14,620
Japanese is a very, very, very hard language to learn.

2123
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,240
And um...

2124
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,240
I just...

2125
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,360
I just need to find the time to learn it.

2126
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,060
Bunker, bunker, bunker.

2127
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,020
I need to get like a tutor.

2128
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:27,500
I think like Japanese, you have to get a tutor to learn that language.

2129
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,100
Just because there's so many rules.

2130
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,960
And like so many...

2131
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,720
Um...

2132
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,380
Um...

2133
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,160
Yeah, but I grew up with Chinese though.

2134
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,980
I grew up learning Chinese from...

2135
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,040
My parents.

2136
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,320
So that was fine.

2137
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,140
But like...

2138
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,540
Especially at such an old...

2139
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,060
Like you know...

2140
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,320
Such a late age.

2141
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,520
I destroyed their...

2142
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,020
Secret thingy.

2143
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,830
I do not know which one.

2144
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:07,470
This one!

2145
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:09,550
This is low, this guy is low.

2146
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:10,510
Weapon!

2147
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:11,930
Behind you!

2148
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:12,610
He's low.

2149
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:20,610
Um...

2150
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:20,630
Um...

2151
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,790
Um...

2152
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:25,670
Writing Chinese is too good.

2153
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,650
To actually learn Japanese you lived or use it.

2154
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:30,750
To actually learn Japanese you lived or use it.

2155
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,070
Yeah, yeah.

2156
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:32,670
Same with Chinese too.

2157
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:36,070
I think if I had to learn Chinese now.

2158
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,370
If I didn't know Chinese at all and had to learn it now.

2159
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:39,670
I would be...

2160
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:40,610
I would give up.

2161
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,930
I would give up.

2162
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,730
A tutor like...

2163
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,870
I think duolingo doesn't really help.

2164
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:54,810
In terms of like...

2165
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,130
In terms of like actually like...

2166
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:57,750
Learning learning.

2167
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:01,090
Learning learning in language.

2168
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:02,890
I think like it's better to just...

2169
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,010
Hire a tutor instead of like going through...

2170
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:05,910
Duolingo.

2171
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:09,070
Because I think duolingo is just like an extra bonus thing.

2172
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,850
That you can do for like you know just to...

2173
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:12,370
Brush it up after your lessons.

2174
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:23,920
Are you...

2175
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,560
Are you a Chinese?

2176
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,560
I'm Canadian.

2177
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,580
I was like...

2178
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,100
Are you a Chinese?

2179
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,420
I'm Canadian.

2180
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,300
You sound funny when said Cantonese.

2181
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,350
This is my second year living in Japan.

2182
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:49,990
I can only do casual Japanese.

2183
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:51,690
Conversational Japanese.

2184
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:52,430
I'm struggling.

2185
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,170
Business Japanese.

2186
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:55,870
Yeah I heard like...

2187
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:57,730
I heard like even like if you're like...

2188
01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:01,010
Even if you're like a fluent Japanese speaker.

2189
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:01,690
Like you're still learning Japanese.

2190
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:02,370
You're still learning too.

2191
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:03,190
It's still hard.

2192
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:06,170
For like even native speakers in Japan.

2193
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,430
Also thank you so much for the follow.

2194
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:10,030
Thank you thank you.

2195
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:10,870
I do appreciate it.

2196
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:11,410
Thank you so much.

2197
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:13,590
I think I might be getting sick but I hope you end on a...

2198
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,450
Oh boy!

2199
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:15,770
Take care of yourself.

2200
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:16,510
Take care of yourself.

2201
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:18,210
I hope... Get better.

2202
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:18,870
Get better soon.

2203
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:19,490
Get better.

2204
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:23,630
I just get confused if Chinese people can kind of understand.

2205
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,490
Because Japanese but it just confuses me.

2206
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,710
Chinese has so much shit in terms of kanji.

2207
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,770
In terms of just how...

2208
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,530
A ton of American...

2209
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:31,990
American...

2210
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:35,790
No no it's a separate country.

2211
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:40,630
America is the state of Canada.

2212
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:41,910
I don't know if you guys know that.

2213
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:43,930
I don't know if you guys know that.

2214
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,200
I don't know if you guys know that.

2215
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:57,640
What um...

2216
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,340
Oh you guys are inside.

2217
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,160
There's a team right...

2218
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,080
There's two teams up here.

2219
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:06,120
Why can't my dad have me learning Latin or ancient Greek.

2220
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,800
I feel cheated.

2221
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,580
Don't worry guys.

2222
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,360
Don't worry guys.

2223
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:13,680
Don't worry guys.

2224
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,060
Don't worry guys.

2225
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,160
There's a team outside.

2226
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,900
There's a team out...

2227
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:20,100
Are you bringing them?

2228
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,340
Are you bringing them with you?

2229
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,840
No no of course not.

2230
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,060
No I would never.

2231
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,620
Where is your white speed?

2232
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,940
Is there any armor here?

2233
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,140
On the box maybe.

2234
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:35,640
Oh I found one.

2235
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,840
I don't have my jump.

2236
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,560
In there you don't know like a language thing.

2237
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,180

2238

Oh shit.

2240
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,860
I'm getting shot by a different guy.

2241
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,560
Where's your guy?

2242
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,280

Oh...

2253
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,900
There's so many different teams here.

2254
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,580
I don't know what to do.

2255
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,080
I might be dead.

2256
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:19,840
Yeah.

2257
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:22,900
Oh this guy is cracked.

2258
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,620

Okay yeah well yeah.

2260
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,340
Even English is very hard.

2261
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,860
Yeah if you're not a native English speaker.

2262
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,900
It's very very hard too.

2263
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,140
Like English is such a difficult language.

2264
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:39,880
Like English is such a difficult language.

2265
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:40,540
Is he shot by a zheng?

2266
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:40,760
Is he shot by a zheng?

2267
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:46,950
BITCH!

2268
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:51,350

01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:57,810
That's fucked up.

2271
01:29:57,970 --> 01:29:59,210
That's fucked up!

2272
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:04,010
I hope they kill you and I don't rez you.

2273
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:16,530

Not right now though!

2275
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,850
English has like the dumbest rules too.

2276
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:35,150
You know what?

2277
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,170
Yeah fuck it.

2278
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:37,650
I heard the damage is a lot too.

2279
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:41,750
Okay I just think...

2280
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,110
No no.

2281
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,070
Korean is one of the easiest languages in the world to learn.

2282
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,250
Um if you want to learn a new language.

2283
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:48,490
Other than like if you only speak one language.

2284
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,290
And you want to learn a new language that's not Korean.

2285
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:51,510
Like I mean...

2286
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:53,290
I mean if you want to learn a new language.

2287
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:54,930
And you don't speak Korean.

2288
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,250
Uh...

2289
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:59,970
Korean is actually one of the easiest languages to learn right now.

2290
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:01,550
Also the easiest language is the phone Matt.

2291
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,570
I do appreciate it.

2292
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:03,790
Thank you!

2293
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:05,470
Where do we go?

2294
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,370
Oh I'm in the phone.

2295
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:08,130
Oh okay.

2296
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:11,330
Yeah exactly.

2297
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:12,670
Yeah that's why.

2298
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:13,670
What?

2299
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:17,790
They're just chilling.

2300
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,490
I wouldn't call it chilling.

2301
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,110
Oh my god!

2302
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:27,070
I got one of them.

2303
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:28,750
I can't climb this.

2304
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:31,170
I don't know if I'm safe though.

2305
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:33,850
I think he's going to follow.

2306
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:35,230
I do appreciate it.

2307
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:35,650
Thank you.

2308
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:38,950

01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:40,130
I'm heading over.

2310
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:40,890
This is the last guy.

2311
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,430
Cracked.

2312
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:46,970
I heard a charge rifle team.

2313
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,470
Get over here.

2314
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:49,930
Woo!

2315
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,190
Bye!

2316
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:53,150
I leave.

2317
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,350
I hide in house.

2318
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:59,530
That wasn't even the crypto team.

2319
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:02,790
Yeah yeah yeah.

2320
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:03,250
Um.

2321
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,130
Cause like the emperor.

01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:06,390
No no no.

2323
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:07,750
I heard a crypto ult just then.

2324
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,110
Because of like the emperor.

2325
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,610
The ruler of Korea.

2326
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:14,730
I went to his grave.

2327
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,590
I have no light ammo.

2328
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:19,330
Does anyone have light ammo to spare?

2329
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,750
No.

2330
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,150
I have like zero light bullets right now.

2331
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,470
I hit his 16.

2332
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:25,330
Light ammo here.

2333
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:27,750
Why are you so good?

2334
01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:28,210
Oh thank you.

2335
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,470
Well that's not true.

2336
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:32,610
I can't 16 more.

2337
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:36,230
Yeah I went to like his temple area.

2338
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:37,510
To learn more about his history.

2339
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:38,570
But yeah they.

2340
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,410
They purposely.

2341
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:41,590
Um.

2342
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:45,170
Made the language very very easy to learn.

2343
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,450
Where is Wraith?

2344
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,350
Octane hit for 40.

2345
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:51,110
I almost cracked him.

2346
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,530
Octane cracked.

2347
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,050
Okay I'm gonna take the jump pad.

2348
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:57,670
Where is his teammate?

2349
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:59,070
Oh right here.

2350
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,490
There's two here.

2351
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:02,550
I thought he was dead.

2352
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:04,070
Last guy is right here.

2353
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,610
Haha he's so dumb.

2354
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,610
You were sniping me.

2355
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:09,490
For some unknown reason.

2356
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,770
My aim today is really good.

2357
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:15,310
Where is my 4-8?

2358
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:16,270
Which is surprising.

2359
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:18,590
Because usually on stream it's not.

2360
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,960
I tried learning Swedish.

2361
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,940
I quit 2 but it doesn't seem hard compared to other languages.

2362
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:31,880
I think.

2363
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:32,240
Oh.

2364
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:37,000
Swedish is very hard to learn in terms of speaking Swedish.

2365
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,160
Got

2366
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:44,310
one of them.

2367
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:44,810
Oh shit.

2368
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:45,370
Wait what the fuck?

2369
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:47,470
Dead.

2370
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,530
That was good.

2371
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:51,250
Bop.

2372
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:55,190
I tried learning Swedish for a while.

2373
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,570
Thank you so much for the follow bros.

2374
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:57,190
I do appreciate it.

2375
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:57,490
Thank you.

2376
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:01,170
I think like.

2377
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,790
Swedish is very hard to pronounce.

2378
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,450
Like I can't do a lot of like.

2379
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:07,630
European languages.

2380
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:10,170
Because European languages.

2381
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:12,530
Is very hard for me to pronounce in terms of like.

2382
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:13,530
Tongue movements.

2383
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:16,150
Cause like you gotta move your tongue in a specific way.

2384
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:16,950
And I'm like.

2385
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,530
I can't even roll my R's.

2386
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,130
I can't do.

2387
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,250
I can't roll my R's.

2388
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:29,090
That was me attempting to roll my R's.

2389
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:32,390
And you gotta be able to roll.

2390
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:33,170
Use the.

2391
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:38,390
That's me rolling R's.

2392
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:46,510
That's me rolling R's.

2393
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:46,950
Oh those sounds.

2394
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:47,730
Thank you so much for the follow.

2395
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:48,090
Thank you.

2396
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:53,210
Don't roll your R's.

2397
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,420
Language is one of the hardest.

2398
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:06,360
Like languages is very hard to learn.

2399
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:07,580
Especially the older you get.

2400
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,880
So sign it off with bird like.

2401
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,380
You gotta be like.

2402
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,740
You know you gotta learn young.

2403
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,400
Cause the older you get.

2404
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,860
The harder it is to learn a language.

2405
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,000
Cause your brain is already developed.

2406
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,120
Unless.

2407
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,400
I mean my.

2408
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,120
My brain stopped developing after a certain.

2409
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,040
After.

2410
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,260
Elementary school but.

2411
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,480
But.

2412
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,700
Wait where are they?

2413
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,860
Last time I saw them.

2414
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,780
They went in the bunker.

2415
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:40,360
They're in bunker?

2416
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:42,020
I'm gonna read the play over.

2417
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,820
I'm going to the lifeline package.

2418
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,040
Lifeline package where?

2419
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:47,900
Here?

2420
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,640
My son said.

2421
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,460
Malaysia easy learning.

2422
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,520
And somehow I took 10 years learning the formal version of my mother tongue.

2423
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:58,880
I assume it's a lifeline package.

2424
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,840
Cause there was nothing in the radar.

2425
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,020
Here.

2426
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:08,700
Right in front of you.

2427
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,020
Crack one of them.

2428
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,380
I hit 20 on the other.

2429
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,720
I'm trying to get closer.

2430
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,560
I'm getting closer to you.

2431
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,820
Hey there.

2432
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,200
Hey there.

2433
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:27,780
Haha.

2434
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,700
Cracked Octane.

2435
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,000
Octane dead.

2436
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,680
Where's your teammate?

2437
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,100

2445
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:53,920

I won't hide where the ketchup comes from.

2527
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:15,430

I swear at one point you'll be an anime dude.

2531
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:29,650
I'll like your emotes.

2532

It's time.

2533
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:37,390
It's time to do a tomato dance too.

2534
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:38,430
Pop pop.

2535
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:40,730

That's why I have a farm.

2539

And you are my farmers.

2540
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,660
And my wardens.

2541
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,220
Adios, adios!

2542
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:56,020
Yes, the tomato shuffle.

01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,720
The tomato shuffle.

2544
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,940
That's my favorite.

2545
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:01,680
Woah.

2546
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:10,310
Bruh, I ironically want this tomato url to seem more of it.

2547
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:14,030
Tomato dodging mode like, woo!

2548
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:18,390
You know like that video of like that grandpa, like, dodging and moving?

2549
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:22,410
Because, uh, when he's playing Overwatch, that's me when I play Apex.

2550
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:23,170

Yeah, we're gonna have, don't worry, we're gonna have a tomato model redeem.

2558
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,280
Do not worry.

2559
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:43,480
Alright, I'm worried because I only have a sentinel.

2560
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,640
I have the guns I hate.

2561
01:43:58,590 --> 01:43:59,370
Are you okay?

2562
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:01,610
I'm not okay.

2563
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:03,970
I got one killed one and the other got...

2564
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:06,550
Oh my god, they're all very low.

2565
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:07,330
They're all very low.

2566
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,310
They're all down here.

2567
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:12,630
Where's the Wraith?

2568
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:13,490
Where's the Octane?

2569
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:14,570
Wait, what?

2570
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:15,950
What the fuck?

2571
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:18,330
He was next to you.

2572
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:19,270
Yeah, I couldn't tell.

2573
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:20,130
He's low, he's low.

2574
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:23,870
I put you to the low.

2575
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:25,970
I don't know why I'm a tomato.

2576
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:27,250
I'm a tomato.

2577
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:28,950
You can't trust me.

2578
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:30,810
I'm ketchup.

2579
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,950
I was not low in any world.

2580
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,650
I was so confused.

2581
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:39,550
I didn't know where he was.

2582
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:39,570
It's okay, it's okay.

2583
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:40,450
It brought you over.

2584
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:43,830
Don't trust the tomato.

2585
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:47,670
I eat my children and you want to trust me?

2586
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:54,950
This one is trying to learn ISL.

2587
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,090
That's time for like 20 indig...

2588
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:58,210
Oh my gosh, that's a lot of English.

2589
01:44:58,210 --> 01:44:59,390
Someone's over there.

2590
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:01,110
It's important to learn record time.

2591
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:03,230
What do you mean joke?

2592
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,290
I had this motto for four months.

2593
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,310
There's no jokes about the tomato.

2594
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:12,770
There's no jokes about the tomato.

2595
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:13,750
There's no jokes about the tomato.

2596
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:14,590
Oh, thank you.

2597
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,870
People who have never watched you before are so confused.

2598
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:27,170
They thought I was an actual tomato streamer.

2599
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:27,550
They thought I was an actual tomato streamer.

2600
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,730
Tomato Persian Pog.

2601
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:31,990
Tomato Persian Pog.

2602
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,670
Has science gone too far?

2603
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:37,290
I don't have an angle on this guy.

2604
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:44,250
There you go.

2605
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:48,830
He just forgot where I was.

2606
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:51,790
No, I think he got scared that I shot him.

2607
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:58,370
Science has gone too far, but they can go even further.

2608
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,610
How far can science go?

2609
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:01,530
You know what?

2610
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:03,090
I'm going to go extra scummy.

2611
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:05,550
I'm going to get that Spitfire.

2612
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:07,690
Time for extra scum.

2613
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:09,310
Scum apex gamer.

2614
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:14,570
You ever go out and publicize your skin suit?

2615
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:15,550
I don't know.

2616
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:19,790
Sometimes I want to go wild and like, get buried in other farms.

2617
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:21,950
And steal their tomato children.

2618
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:22,850
For my own.

2619
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:26,590
You know, typical tomato things.

2620
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:29,750
Seize the kill?

2621
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:31,850
I eat my children?

2622
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:32,510
Do you want Jesse?

2623
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:38,850
I make my own angles.

2624
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,180
Yeah, I steal other people's children.

2625
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,660
That's why I go outside.

2626
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:51,880
Oh, what?

2627
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,000
Bullshit.

2628
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:55,380
Oh, you wanted to steal that?

2629
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:56,160
Was that it?

2630
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,340
I pressed A on it.

2631
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:00,520
Tomato lean enables.

2632
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:03,440
The game was like, nah, mate.

2633
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:07,360
Not only do I steal money, I steal other people's tomatoes.

2634
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,240
There can only be one tomato farm.

2635
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,660
Look at that tomato potty.

2636
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,660
That is peak Apex performance.

2637
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,600
Oh, I hear a shot above.

2638
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,860
I have no idea where they are, but I heard a...

2639
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:30,260
Pah!

2640
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,680
Wherever that pump master is.

2641
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,600
No more baby showers.

2642
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:37,340
It's a boy, no, it's a me.

2643
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,920
Time to go in my belly!

2644
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:44,100
Capacitor.

2645
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,180
It's like here, right?

2646
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:50,940
It's a great time.

2647
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:54,900
All my children's dream is to be in my belly.

2648
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,160
So I can get stronger.

2649
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,520
And tomato we did trust.

2650
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,300
It would be exactly!

2651
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:06,740
Exactly!

2652
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:07,320
Exactly!

2653
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:10,520
Faye knows what's up.

2654
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,820
Oh, there's a fucking portal here.

2655
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,280
Yeah, there's people that are like below here.

2656
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,820
They jump out on these people.

2657
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,440
I jump out on these people as well.

2658
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,920
Oh, new team, new team, new team!

2659
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:21,940
Oh, Revolts.

2660
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:23,800
Behind you, behind you, Asa, new team behind you!

2661
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,300
Oh, yeah, I got stuck.

2662
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,700
Oh, no.

2663
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,340
Oh, I'm dead too.

2664
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:32,620
Oh my gosh.

2665
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,220
I have to like extra run.

2666
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:36,480
I jumped out of the way Wapix, so I'm safe here.

2667
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,160
Woo!

2668
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:39,960
No, I'm not!

2669
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:41,520
I am actually safe.

2670
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,760
You jumped out of the way.

2671
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,280
Yeah, because I got stuck.

2672
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:46,800
No, fuck this.

2673
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:48,840
Because I was sniping.

2674
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:51,020
Oh, you're from damage?

2675
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,960
I don't know, I almost downed a guy.

2676
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:56,340
There is like another team on me.

2677
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,300
That's right.

2678
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:01,980
You're right, I'll survive that.

2679
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,200
You don't know I'm a tomato on you.

2680
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,680
I'm just growing on the ground.

2681
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:07,860
I'm just growing on the ground.

2682
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,340
I don't know.

2683
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,500
I'm a perfect camouflage.

2684
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:17,960
The perfect...

2685
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:18,900
He knew.

2686
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,140
No, he knew.

2687
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,120
What the fuck?

2688
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,320
What's wrong with you?

2689
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:24,620
Tomato hater.

2690
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,940
There's a tomato hater.

2691
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:28,960
Are you here?

2692
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:33,560
I'm not the perfect camouflage.

2693
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,200
I got crushed.

2694
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:38,320
I got crushed.

2695
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,260
I got killed by a hater.

2696
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:40,280
I got killed by a hater.

2697
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,620
You got you.

2698
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,660
I got squashed.

2699
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,740
What were the odds?

2700
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,000
I thought you were down below.

2701
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,480
There's people out there.

2702
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:58,120
This guy.

2703
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:58,480
This guy.

2704
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,180
He's just one guy.

2705
01:49:59,320 --> 01:49:59,820
Yeah!

2706
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,560
Alright, pick my body up and then other person...

2710
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,300
The tomato...

2711
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,480
Tomato never dies.

2712
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:17,440
What do you mean?

2713
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,500
There's still one squad here somewhere.

2714
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:20,120

01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,120

01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,720

01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,080

There it is.

2734
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,900

Our nutrition has arrived.

2740
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,420
You can never...

2741
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:17,020
You can never fully squash a tomato.

2742
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,040
A potato.

2743
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:25,600
Alright, what do I get rid of?

2744
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:26,780
Alright, there we go.

Someone's been over here.

2754
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:56,990
Alright, I'm heading back.

2755
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:00,170

01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:17,660
The tomato never dies!

2760
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,020
How does it feel to be immortal?

2761
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:30,950
LOL Have you ever seen a dead tomato?

2762
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:32,650
I think not.

2763
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:34,410
Only consumed tomatoes.

2764
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:38,350
Crypto.

2765
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:40,350
Last two teams.

2766
01:52:43,410 --> 01:52:44,170
There it is.

2767
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:48,490
Oh yeah, they're on the hangar and somewhere down below.

2768
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:50,790
The hangar?

2769
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,230
What?

2770
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,270
The other thing, the 82 thing.

2771
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:54,170
The diving board.

2772
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:56,090
When people need a tomato, PC lives out.

2773
01:52:56,170 --> 01:52:56,630
Exactly.

2774
01:52:56,650 --> 01:52:57,810
The diving board, watchtower.

2775
01:52:58,290 --> 01:52:58,670
Exactly.

2776
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:01,450
I accept watchtower, diving board.

2777
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:01,910
This is weird.

2778
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:03,650
Nah, it's a diving board.

2779
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:06,390
Wait, so where are they?

2780
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,230
Are we going here?

2781
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:08,770
One is up here and one is down.

2782
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:12,950
Oh, I am going where Wapik is cause Wapik will die if we don't.

2783
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:13,990
I know.

2784
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:16,810
Oh, Wapik instantly gets shot at.

2785
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:18,810
Of course he gets shot at.

2786
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:19,110
It's a terror.

2787
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:22,190
Oh, he jumped down.

2788
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:22,650
One of them.

2789
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:24,130
He's here.

2790
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:26,390
Can you shoot him?

2791
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:28,370
He's down there.

2792
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,170
No, he's not.

2793
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:30,050
I don't see him.

2794
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:31,350
Was it a clone?

2795
01:53:32,590 --> 01:53:33,570
I think so, yeah.

2796
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:34,370
That's a real one?

2797
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:35,130
What the fuck?

2798
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:36,070
Alright, you gotta hurry.

2799
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,050
You gotta hurry.

2800
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:38,930
He got down.

2801
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:41,130
Of course he got down.

2802
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:42,690
I'm almost there.

2803
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:44,510
Oh, I got galaxy brained.

2804
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:46,010
Also...

2805
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:50,310
I got one of them.

2806
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,810
I don't know where his teammates are.

2807
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:53,610
Oh, his teammates are here.

2808
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:55,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2809
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:55,730
At the back.

2810
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:56,410
I'm running.

2811
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:05,560
Tomato!

2812
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:05,960
Freedom!

2813
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,940
There's like a team that's like...

2814
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:12,740
There's a guy that has self-res in there.

2815
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,220
Hate milk!

2816
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,160
Yeah, but the guy I killed isn't dead.

2817
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:20,460
They're letting him live.

2818
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,740
I don't think they know there's another team in there.

2819
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,320
I don't think they went inside.

2820
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,260
They didn't went inside?

2821
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:30,980
Yeah, yeah.

2822
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,940
Cause the guy I killed is still alive.

2823
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:35,960
Oh, now they know.

2824
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,600
Now they know.

2825
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:37,400
I'm just resting.

2826
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,100
I'm gonna run and rest in my bed.

2827
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:38,540
Okay, okay, okay.

2828
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:43,100
At the end of the day...

2829
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:43,840
Cause I have a longbow.

2830
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,900
Yeah, I'm just gonna... Goodbye.

2831
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:47,660
Goodbye.

2832
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:48,720
Wait, wait.

2833
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:50,760
Wait, the guy we killed earlier.

2834
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:51,380
They're...

2835
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:52,980
Wait, they're winning!

2836
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:54,480
They're winning!

2837
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:56,200
The team we were fighting is winning.

2838
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,120
Oh, no.

2839
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:57,520
Wait, sorry.

2840
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,220
Big C.

2841
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:00,700
Yeah.

2842
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:02,500
Yes.

2843
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,340
Big C is having some issues here.

2844
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,460
They're rezzing.

2845
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:11,160
I'm gonna do something dumb.

2846
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,040
So...

2847
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:21,980
Alright, I left.

2848
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,700
Are you down two?

2849
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:25,040
You're down two?

2850
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,880
I'm down two, but the other team is rezzed.

2851
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:27,980
The other team is rezzed.

2852
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,800
The other team is fully rezzed now though.

2853
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,160
I fucked up one of them.

2854
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,300
I'm begging you to leave the stream for two.

2855
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:38,540
Yo, is that Devontoki?

2856
01:55:44,530 --> 01:55:45,770
Alright, they're still in there.

2857
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:48,070
The two I down is still alive.

2858
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:49,550
So I think they're gonna rezz again.

2859
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:50,770
No, there's only one guy.

2860
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:51,690
Alright.

2861
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:52,550
They're all dead.

2862
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:54,170
Well, yeah, but there's still that one team.

2863
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,570
What are you shooting me for?

2864
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:57,910
There's that one team.

2865
01:55:58,250 --> 01:55:58,630
Oh.

2866
01:55:59,230 --> 01:55:59,990
I did it!

2867
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:00,650
Tomato.

2868
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:01,770
I did it!

2869
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:06,810
I did this.

2870
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:09,410
The tomato luck.

2871
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:12,990
Oh, there's a heat shield.

2872
01:56:13,110 --> 01:56:13,790
They use heat shields.

2873
01:56:13,930 --> 01:56:14,070
What?

2874
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:14,770
Tomato win!

2875
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:16,130
Oh!

2876
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,770
The tomat shots.

2877
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:19,430
We did it again.

2878
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:20,910
Alright, guys.

2879
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:21,470
GG's.

2880
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:22,310
That was my last game.

2881
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:23,630
GG's.

2882
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:24,430
Okay, okay.

2883
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:25,030
GG's too much.

2884
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:27,150
Hello, Desi!

2885
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:29,250
The tomato force.

2886
01:56:30,070 --> 01:56:31,590
We have won again.

2887
01:56:34,210 --> 01:56:35,710
How about we... You know what?

2888
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:37,550
You know what, guys?

2889
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:40,170
I feel a little generous today.

2890
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,910
Let me... Let me zoom in.

2891
01:56:42,970 --> 01:56:44,210
Let me do an actual goodbye.

2892
01:56:44,610 --> 01:56:47,050
Let me do a real goodbye then for you guys.

2893
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:47,810
Just for you guys.

2894
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:50,810
Why is you a tomato?

2895
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:53,070
Why am I not?

2896
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:54,950
We are at my humble tomato farm.

2897
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:56,310
Why am I not a tomato?

2898
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:57,690
We are at a farm.

2899
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:01,370
Oh, shit.

2900
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:01,650
Wait.

2901
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:02,470
This isn't it.

2902
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:05,690
This is not the song that we need to play for...

2903
01:57:05,690 --> 01:57:06,430
The tomato.

2904
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:13,370
Let me... Let me get some royal...

2905
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:14,610
Hey, guys.

2906
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:16,590
Let me get some royalty free...

2907
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:18,590
Some royalty free...

2908
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:21,430
Country songs real quick for us.

2909
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:25,850
What?

2910
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:29,470
Oh, thank you, Ninja.

2911
01:57:30,070 --> 01:57:32,870
Thank you, Ninja for the $15.

2912
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:33,730
Dick.

2913
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:36,230
That's what Scooby do, by the way.

2914
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:37,530
Let me... Alright.

2915
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:40,510
Farming... Farming royalty free.

2916
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:43,790
Here we go.

2917
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:44,970
Here we go.

2918
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:46,310
That... This seems like...

2919
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:47,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2920
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:47,630
Wait, wait.

2921
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:48,350
There we go.

2922
01:57:48,610 --> 01:57:50,610
The pure... There we go.

2923
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:51,110
Weird.

2924
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:52,450
This is it.

2925
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:53,470
Alright, guys.

2926
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:57,810
Thank you for coming to my tomato farm stream.

2927
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:58,810
Thank you.

2928
01:57:58,850 --> 01:57:59,830
Oh, time to blow a kiss.

2929
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:00,550
Alright, Espeny.

2930
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:03,210
Before I end it, let's give a kiss to Espeny real quick.

2931
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:04,070
Everyone close your eyes.

2932
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:06,830
This is a tomato kiss for Espeny.

2933
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:17,820
Oh, should I eat some children...

2934
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:19,640
Some tomato children before I go?

2935
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:20,520
Chat.

2936
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,700
Do I...

2937
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:22,660
Do I eat...

2938
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:23,100
Alright.

2939
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,900
Lucky for you guys.

2940
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:25,840
Oh, sh...

2941
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,240
Alright, for Ruby real quick.

2942
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,640
Let me hydrate real quick for this.

2943
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,680
Just wiped out tomato town.

2944
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,060
Alright, guys.

2945
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:45,440
