1
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,840
Oh no, okay, there we go, there we go.

2
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:22,120
Okay, sorry, I forgot that I have to redo all my output and input because my PC had to update because I realized that there's so many...

3
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Okay, so long story short, my PC hasn't been updated, like Windows updated for like a couple of months now, for like five, six plus months, so apparently there's something wrong with my Windows.

4
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,540
It's fucking Windows 11, there's always something wrong.

5
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,740
It's Windows 11, there's always something wrong.

6
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:53,840
So like, okay, so I had this issue where every time I try to Windows update, it wouldn't let me, it would be like restarting and then like applying updates.

7
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,660
And then every time I try, it would update, it would say, it'd be like, something is wrong.

8
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,440
Something is wrong.

9
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,580
So like, we couldn't apply your update, but don't worry, we can revert the changes.

10
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,380
And then like, and then whatever.

11
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,140
So it would do that for six plus months.

12
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,000
And I didn't know why, because I kept looking it up.

13
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
And everybody's like, this is a Windows 11 problem.

14
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,900
And I was like, okay, you think I wanted Windows 11?

15
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,540
It was already installed in the, it was already there.

16
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,520
I got a free PC and it's already there.

17
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,020
I'm not going to be complaining.

18
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,940
The PC was free.

19
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm not going to complain.

20
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:46,360
Anyway, um, anyway, but I'm complaining about this because, okay, so I'm complaining about it because like, I'm still going to complain about it, but I don't blame, I'm just going to blame Windows 11.

21
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Anyway, so I finally got a thing where it was like, we're going to re, we're going to reinstall Windows 11 with a repaired version, um, and it will fix everything.

22
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,980
I don't know if it fixed everything, but like, I was just like, all right, cool.

23
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,440
I mean, like, I hope that it worked.

24
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,440
Today was the day.

25
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,380
I was like, all right, I hope that worked.

26
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,360
You know, I could actually, oh no, it didn't.

27
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,120
Updates failed.

28
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh, okay.

29
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,760
It still gave me an install error.

30
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,120
Like, okay, nevermind.

31
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,200
It didn't work.

32
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,920
It just said update failed.

33
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,100
That's cool.

34
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,240
Your device is missing important security updates.

35
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,380
Make sure you keep your device on and plugged in so the updates can complete.

36
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,840
Oh, cool.

37
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,180
Um, I don't, it didn't work.

38
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
It didn't work.

39
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,860
I had to reset my entire, I had to repair, install a repaired version, but it didn't repair.

40
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,380
I'm eating my lunch right now.

41
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,340
I have a problem.

42
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,800
I like how at first I was like, I don't have a problem.

43
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,260
I don't have a problem.

44
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,520
I have a small addiction.

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,740
Now I know I have a problem.

46
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,440
I woke up.

47
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,080
I brushed my teeth.

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,240
Okay.

49
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,520
I did.

50
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:05,940
Okay.

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,200
Sorry.

52
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,180
I did brush my, I always brush my teeth.

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I brushed my teeth.

54
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,140
I woke up.

55
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,080
I brushed my teeth.

56
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,360
Um, I walked dad.

57
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,320
I fed dad.

58
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,760
I walked dad.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,140
Oh my god, wait, did I actually brush my teeth?

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,580
No, I did.

61
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,340
I know I did because like, um, I had, I did because like, uh, yeah, sometimes I would brush my teeth when I shower.

62
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,540
And I did that yesterday, but I will put the toothbrush next in the back.

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,460
Like I'll put the toothbrush and the toothpaste like, um, in the shower area.

64
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,080
So then today I had to grab it, grab it from the shower area and then brush my teeth.

65
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:51,620
So, so like, so then I know, I know I did because it's not at the bath area.

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
It's not in the shower area.

67
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,620
It's at the, it's at the sink area.

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,240
So I did.

69
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,720
Sorry.

70
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:56,940
Okay.

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,220
Anyway, I have a problem.

72
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:06,240
We all know I have a problem, but like, basically I woke up, brushed teeth, fed dad, walked him, came back.

73
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,420
Rivals.

74
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,890
But I ended it 30 minutes ago because I was like, I have stream.

75
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,390
I have stream.

76
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,930
I have to do the stream.

77
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,890
I posted that I got GM one.

78
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,410
I lost GM one yesterday.

79
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,990
I am for 30.

80
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,230
I'm 30 points away from losing GM two.

81
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,210
So it was a very fast journey.

82
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,630
I got to be GM one for two games.

83
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,890
Uh, so today I'm gonna try and get it back.

84
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,210
So it was, it sucked because, um, when you do rank, you do rank fully.

85
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,510
You do rank like, you do rank like 20 plus points.

86
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,830
Like, no, not even 20, plus seven, eight, nine, seven, eight, nine.

87
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,750
It minuses 30 plus points.

88
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,690
And then my first game, I got the first game, my teammates were really fucking stupid.

89
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,310
My second game, we played against hackers.

90
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,670
And then it sort of went downhill after that.

91
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,470
It really, it really did.

92
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,730
It really went downhill.

93
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,450
And after that, it was win, loss, win, loss, win, loss.

94
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,030
So then I'm like, all right, we'll do this again after the stream.

95
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,230
Mori, thank you for the super chat.

96
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,190
Thank you, thank you.

97
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,410
I'm so proud of you.

98
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,110
Brushed your teeth.

99
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,710
Did you remember to wash your hands?

100
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,610
Thank you for the super chat.

101
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,650
Thank you, thank you, Mori.

102
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,750
Thank you, thank you.

103
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,210
How many games did the GM win?

104
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,490
It is, I'm at 31 points right now.

105
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,690
So four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

106
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,310
Uh, four, four to five games.

107
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,230
Four to five games, I might be able to get it back.

108
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,650
If I, if I can win four to five games in a row.

109
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,890
Anyway, um, anyway.

110
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,450
I want to tell this story.

111
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,670
So, diet update.

112
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,890
Doki Ember Doge update.

113
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,630
I didn't tell the story.

114
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,850
I told the story already, but I think when, what, I don't remember what stream it was where I told this story randomly.

115
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,130
Was it, I, what stream was it that I told?

116
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,550
I was like, oh, I'll tell the story again.

117
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,430
Was it the Marvel Rivals stream?

118
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,430
Um, oh yeah, I think it was, but I'll sit, this is, I'll tell, tell the story on YouTube.

119
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,230
So, basically, a couple days ago, um, I was walking dad.

120
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,910
And then, and then he was like, so like, the thing is, he doesn't have a lot of friends.

121
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,030
He doesn't really have, he doesn't have friends at all.

122
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,750
He's just like me.

123
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,610
Like, IRL.

124
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,690
Like, he's very, he's an anti-social.

125
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,390
Oh my god, he's just like me for real, for real.

126
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:17,730
Um, but like, he's like an incredibly like, he's, he's sort of like anti-social in a way.

127
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:26,630
So like, he hates dogs that are bigger than him, but like, he's okay with dogs that are smaller than, he's like okay with dogs that are smaller than him.

128
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:38,890
So, um, the thing about that is that whenever, so when he sees a dog that's smaller than him, he's like, oh yes, now I'm the big dog here around town.

129
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,430
So anyway, poor, I said IRL, guys, I'm virtual.

130
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:55,230
Anyway, anyway, so, he has his own little Napoleon complex.

131
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:06,750
So, for a walk, during the walk, he saw a little dog, he saw a small dog, and he was so happy, because he's like, finally, a dog that's smaller than me.

132
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:13,750
And then he like, he was so happy, he was like wagging his tail and everything, and they were like sniffing each other, um, and everything.

133
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:22,670
And I was like, oh my god, that's great, that's great, he's actually not, because it's like, it's honestly like an 80-20% if he's gonna fucking try to bite his face off.

134
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:34,770
So like, I'm always happy when like, you know, we hit the 20%, like, so, I'm just, I'm just so happy when it's at the 20%, where he doesn't try to fucking bite another dog's face off.

135
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:46,090
So, so, so, um, anyway, so he was so happy, and then suddenly, he just, he tried to pee on the dog.

136
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:51,230
And I was like, fucking, no!

137
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,070
And I feel like he

138
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,410
lifted his leg, he's like, I'm gonna pee on you now.

139
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,310
While they were sniffing each other, they were like, happily sniffing each other, and he's just like, it's time, it's...

140
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:24,450
And then, the fucking, and we weren't near any grass, we were literally in the middle of this giant sidewalk that has no grass on it.

141
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,970
There was no grass next to us, it was just road.

142
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:33,290
And so, and then, so like, it was even fucking weirder, because I'm just like, why?

143
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,650
And so, and then the guy was like, oh, that's bad.

144
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,290
And the other one was just looking at me, and he's like, oh, that's bad.

145
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,170
I'm like, I'm so sorry, and I just walked away.

146
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,170
And he just saw the little dog, and he's like, I own this dog now.

147
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,030
Yeah, and then the other dog was just like, whoa.

148
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,890
He's like, whoa, what the fuck?

149
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,910
He just instantly backed off and just looked at my dog, and was just like, whoa, what the fuck?

150
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,210
Like, did he just do that?

151
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,770
I'm like, I'm so sorry, I don't know where he gets this from.

152
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,410
I'm so sorry.

153
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,510
Okay, anyway, that's the dad update.

154
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,750
That was on Twitch.

155
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,250
That was a dad update on Twitch, but I figured I might as well also put this on YouTube as well.

156
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,530
Anyway, today is Variety Day.

157
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,430
Today is Variety Day!

159
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,010
Yeah!

160
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,930
That's the dad post.

161
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,630
Thank you for the super chat.

162
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,770
Thank you, thank you, what have you.

163
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,510
I don't know where he gets it from.

164
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,410
He has no TV to watch anymore.

165
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,350
I don't have a TV.

166
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,050
I don't know where he fucking gets it.

167
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,050
Tommy, thank you for the super chat.

168
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,010
Thank you, thank you.

169
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,790
Sorry, I'm new to meeting people.

170
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,430
This is not what other dogs do to new friends.

171
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,750
Thank you for the super chat.

172
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,010
Thank you, thank you.

173
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,990
Anyway, we are going to be playing Miisai.

174
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,970
I think that's what it's called.

175
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,170
It's apparently the newest FOMO game.

176
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,350
I have no context as to what this game is really about.

177
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,630
Voice?

178
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,430
Is this originally in... oh, let's get Japanese in.

179
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,150
I want them to talk.

180
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,390
Alright, so English.

181
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,530
I like how there's no English voice acting.

182
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,150
Alright, let's play in Japanese for the immersion.

183
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,170
I have no idea what this game is about.

184
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,410
Apparently, I can fix her.

185
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,570
Or like, she can fix me maybe.

186
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,470
You think she'll fix me?

187
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,470
I think I need fixing right now.

188
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,450
I'm like, closing my eyes and all I can think about is Marvel Rivals.

189
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,650
I'm so fucked.

190
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:59,310
I don't know what to do.

191
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,610
Alright.

192
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,690
No, I don't.

193
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,110
Please do your best.

194
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,370
Maybe I'll close my eyes.

195
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,890
Woah, hello.

196
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,650
Smooches.

197
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,730
Choo choo choo choo.

198
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,590
Oh, don't you want kisses from me?

199
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,870
Choo choo choo choo.

200
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,730
Oh my god.

201
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,650
Choo choo.

202
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,750
Oh, I can't kiss here.

203
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,150
I can only kiss here.

204
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,910
Alright, let's see.

205
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:27,890
Graphics.

206
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,150
Window mode.

207
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,190
Graphic settings.

208
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,370
Soft shadows.

209
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,710
Glare.

210
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,190
Okay, none of these matter.

211
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,530
Character?

212
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:39,790
Mita?

213
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,130
Mita's the central figure of the game.

214
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,390
Originally posing as a charming... oh, I shouldn't read this.

215
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,470
I might get spoiled.

216
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,330
Alright,

217
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,470
we're loading in.

218
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,770
Locked in.

219
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,550
She can be my Luna Snow.

220
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,100
Seems like a nice apartment.

221
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,660
Oh my god, it's so clean.

222
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,580
I really need to clean my room.

223
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,980
It's so bad right now.

224
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,720
One new message.

225
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,580
Oh my god, tissue box right next to the fucking monitor.

226
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,580
Wonder what I'm doing.

227
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm looking around.

228
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
Oh my god, am I Noel?

229
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,980
Sorry, OM?

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,420
Office man?

231
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm an office man.

232
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,480
We're back from work.

233
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,280
Where's my student?

234
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,220
I can't tell.

235
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,940
I mean, I can't tell.

236
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,560
This is a school uniform.

237
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,820
That's my family.

238
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh, gotta change.

239
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,460
What are you doing here on the bed?

240
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,820
I mean, that's my shirt.

241
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,400
Draw an office man.

242
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh, it's too busy to take out the trash.

243
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh, that's so mean.

244
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,740
Okay, but I wouldn't put the trash specifically on the floor.

245
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,380
I'd put it on the table or in my mini Uber Eats bags.

246
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Oh, hey, Rubik's Cube.

247
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,300
Well, can't say I got much use out of it.

248
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,300
It's not on the floor!

249
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,640
It's so much better because it's not on the floor.

250
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,860
Guess I wouldn't be able to do it a second time.

251
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,600
She was the best.

252
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,800
Who is that?

253
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,480
Oh, that's my cat.

254
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,480
No, do I have a dead cat?

255
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,340
What do you mean, was the best?

256
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,500
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay, that's sad.

258
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,260
What time is it?

259
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,740
We don't look alike at all.

260
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,660
I really hate the subtitles.

261
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm gonna say.

262
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm just like what I really hate.

263
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,780
I mean, there has to be there has to be a way to change the stomach.

264
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,320
That's those.

265
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,400
Oh, my God.

266
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,400
Oh, my God.

267
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,860
Censored gore?

268
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:10,760
Wait.

269
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,600
Subtitles.

270
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,360
I need to know, like, is there a way that we play our voice?

271
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,180
Wait a minute.

272
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,460
I can hear somebody else could talk for me.

273
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,960
Guys, I know you're like, but the immersion.

274
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,780
Okay, wait, does he actually talk?

275
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,920
Oh, my God.

276
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,320
Thank God.

277
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,620
Let's see several script character reactions and maybe squeeze in some coding.

278
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,640
Oh, thank God.

279
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,240
Oh, wait, I can turn gore on.

280
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,940
Okay, sure.

281
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,420
Can't be that bad.

282
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,420
What is this then?

283
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,320
I guess like, okay.

284
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,100
Check.

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,700
One new message.

286
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,800
Oh, who is it?

287
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,880
Check this new version.

288
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,820
Oh, shit.

289
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,520
Is this gotcha?

290
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,840
All right, enough coding for the day.

291
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm yonder, dead sim.

292
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,720
Oh,

293
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,780
I turned it off?

294
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,180
Okay.

295
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,330
My name?

296
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,490
Not Doki.

297
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,050
Okay.

298
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,890
Oh, so you're going with numbers.

299
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,330
Where's the creativity in that?

300
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:58,910
Okay.

301
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,010
Well, it's your choice.

302
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,850
Well, I'm sorry.

303
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,110
Everybody else claimed every other name.

304
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,430
Not Doki.

305
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,630
One, two, three.

306
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,890
Not Doki, one, two, three.

307
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,910
I swear I rushed off earlier, and now this place is a mess.

308
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,190
Could you help me tidy up a bit?

309
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,490
Oh, yeah, sure.

310
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,630
I can.

311
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,350
I can pick up your clothes.

312
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,250
I'll clean my virtual world instead of my real world.

313
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,230
So it feels like I have my life together.

314
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,290
All right, let's see.

315
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,530
Let's put that away.

316
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,930
And I'll put your pants away, too.

317
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:40,870
Feels real.

318
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,930
Like those people who do simulators instead of fixing their lives, that's me right now.

319
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,990
That's- oh, game's a tad low?

320
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,950
All right, I'll turn it up a little bit.

321
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,450
And by a little bit, I turn it up a lot.

322
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,130
Whoa!

323
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,330
Thank you so much.

324
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,210
You're welcome, Mita.

325
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,390
Oh, oh my god.

326
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,110
Oh my god, it's already day two.

327
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,670
It's just like Marvel Rivals.

328
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,130
I close my eyes and two days have already passed.

329
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,500
Hello!

330
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,120
Not Doki, one, two, three.

331
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,780
My stomach's growling.

332
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,320
I'm so hungry.

333
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,180
Do you think you can help me get the ingredients for some chicken soup?

334
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh my god, of course I can.

335
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,180
All right, food.

336
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,000
All right, let me use my credit card and buy you some virtual food.

337
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,460
Anything for my waifu.

338
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
There you go.

339
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,360
Yeah, of course, no problem, Mita.

340
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,160
I'll chop you some vegetables.

341
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
Oh my god, how the fuck?

342
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,160
This is so hard to cut for some reason.

343
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,340
Okay, anyway, I'm gonna cut this carrot now just for you.

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,400
Anything for you.

345
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,920
I don't cook in real life, but I'll cook for my virtual waifu.

346
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,900
Oh my god, has it been five days already?

347
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,440
My parents are banging at the door wondering what happened to me, but I can't tell them.

348
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,880
They will never understand it's day five.

349
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,180
A small one with antenna?

350
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,480
Perfect for walks, don't you think?

351
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,780
By the way, you can play games to earn money.

352
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,620
I don't have a problem!

353
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,720
Mita's there for me when no one else was.

354
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,660
I can play games to earn money?

355
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,640
Oh my god, I can?

356
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,440
What game can I play?

357
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh my god, wait, do I have enough energy?

358
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,640
Okay, what's this?

359
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,800
I don't have enough energy.

360
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,300
Cartridges?

361
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
What is that?

362
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,580
Is this my new job now?

363
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,180
What am I doing?

364
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,460
Mita, what am I...

365
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,820
What am I doing?

366
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,220
Am I doing cryptocurrency?

367
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,300
Am I farming crypto?

368
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,560
What is this, Mita?

369
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,160
Mita, farm some crypto for our love.

370
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,680
Okay, 155.

371
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,000
I still can't afford any of this.

372
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,920
I guess I'll do this.

373
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,260
Alright, and then we'll put that down here.

374
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,080
And then...

375
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,620
Yay!

376
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,200
200 dollars!

377
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,380
Nice.

378
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,860
Can I do anything else, Mita?

379
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
Like...

380
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,140
Do I just do this all the time?

381
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,220
Will you love me now?

382
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,280
Yay!

383
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,780
I did it!

384
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,000
I earned us money!

385
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,340
And we're not gonna be home!

386
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,150
Oh yeah, you're right.

387
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,350
No, we don't need to pay rent.

388
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,550
You're right, Mita.

389
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,530
What you want is what I want.

390
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,350
You're right.

391
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,910
You want that portable TV?

392
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,490
Here you go, girl.

393
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,770
I love you.

394
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

395
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,930
I said it first.

396
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,050
You're gonna say it back too, right, Mita?

397
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,330
Small, portable, and cheap.

398
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,450
Just what I wanted.

399
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,370
Oh, of course!

400
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,910
You know, you can say that thing that I've always wanted to hear.

401
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,170
Oh my god, it's day 10.

402
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,610
Alright.

403
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,910
I have family?

404
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,350
My job?

405
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,210
What do you mean, my job?

406
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,150
This is my job.

407
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,690
Spending time with Mita...

408
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,390
is my job.

409
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,090
She is my family.

410
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,230
Oh, you're back.

411
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,870
I lost my hairbrush.

412
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,450
Oh, I can buy you a new hairbrush, Mita.

413
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,130
Can you help me find it?

414
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,170
Of course I can!

415
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,330
Anything for you!

416
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,750
Give it up for day 10!

417
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,710
Try checking the bedside table first.

418
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,010
I think I left it there.

419
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,750
Oh my god, she's already fixing me.

420
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,490
How about somewhere else?

421
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,650
Just don't look in the oven, okay?

422
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,730
I already checked there.

423
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,090
I'm gonna look in the oven.

424
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,560
Hey, I told you not to look in there.

425
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,040
Turn around.

426
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,340
Oh, it's a prop, right?

427
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,740
Oh my gosh, it's for cutting the trees in the backyard.

428
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,420
They're all done.

429
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,620
Let's keep looking else... She's just a gardener, guys.

430
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,500
Forget what you just... Oh, of course, Mita.

431
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,420
Of course.

432
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,040
Of course.

433
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,780
Neku won't be hiding anything from me.

434
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,720
Oh, that was easy.

435
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,680
Yeah, she makes her own furniture, guys.

436
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,200
She was making her own furniture, guys.

437
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,760
Also, I upped the game volume.

438
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,900
I don't know if I should up anything else more.

439
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,220
What should we do next?

440
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,760
Look, there was no room in the apartment.

441
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,020
It's so cramped.

442
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,200
Where else would you put a chainsaw in this apartment?

443
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,700
Hi, Nadoki123.

444
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,620
You're such a big help, honestly.

445
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,560
Huh?

446
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,100
That TV is cool and all, but it broke already.

447
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,280
Of course.

448
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,460
I mean, it was so cheap.

449
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,380
It was my fault for buying such a cheap TV for you, Mita.

450
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm so sorry.

451
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,540
Like, it was all my fault.

452
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,320
I should've... I should've fucking worked harder to be able to afford better things for you.

453
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,740
Anyway, could you help me move this wardrobe?

454
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,640
Of course!

455
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,700
It's super heavy.

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,220
Alright, yeah, no problem.

457
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,360
I can move this for you.

458
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,420
Here you go!

459
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,920
Aw, thank you so much, sweetie!

460
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh my God!

461
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,300
I love you!

462
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,860
Oh, you don't want to say it back yet?

463
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,680
That's okay.

464
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,140
It's only day 20.

465
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,560
It's a bit too soon, you're right.

466
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,400
It's okay.

467
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,440
Day 33.

468
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,320
It's only been a day, but I've missed you so much!

469
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,800
Oh my God!

470
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,800
I missed you too!

471
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,200
I wish you could visit me more often.

472
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,340
Oh my God, me too, Mita!

473
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,400
I wish I didn't have to fucking eat or sleep and it'd just be Mita all day long.

474
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,680
Mita, I got you a present!

475
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,580
Look!

476
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,740
Is this for me?

477
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,500
Yes, Mita, of course!

478
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,020
It's always for you!

479
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,920
Thank you so much, really!

480
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
I must be out of flesh.

481
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,040
Day 37.

482
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,420
What?

483
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,620
I haven't been outside.

484
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,100
I haven't seen the sun in 37 days.

485
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,160
I've been thinking!

486
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,840
I wish we could meet in person.

487
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,220
Don't ruin this, Mita.

488
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,060
Don't ruin this, the real world.

489
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,760
It's not it, Mita.

490
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,180
I'm being with you so I can escape reality.

491
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,720
It's so frustrating that I can't.

492
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,640
You're always helping me.

493
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,200
Being so kind every day.

494
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,280
I wish I could do something for you, too.

495
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,920
You know, I said you could say it back.

496
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,280
You know, Mita, you could say it back.

497
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,280
That's all I need.

498
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,540
Oh, I've got an idea.

499
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,380
Oh, what's your idea, Mita?

500
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,480
What?

501
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,040
What's going on?

502
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,580
Now we're together!

503
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:25,960
What?

504
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,020
Put the phone down?

505
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,500
Santiago, think of the Akasupa!

506
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:32,800
What?

507
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,060
Oh my God, it's clean now.

508
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,240
This place looks familiar.

509
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,940
Wait, I'm in the game?

510
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,840
Where's the garbage surrounding me?

511
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,020
Where's the Uber Eats bags surrounding me?

512
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,520
Oh my God.

513
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,940
Wait, it's clean.

514
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,120
No, I do not want to be in Marvel Rivals, guys.

515
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,100
I do not want to get killed 24-7.

516
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,100
Oh my God.

517
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,440
There's consoles.

518
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,340
Oh my God, I have a PS5.

519
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,260
No, that's a PS4.

520
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,820
Love note.

521
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,560
There's my Rubik's Cube.

522
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,000
There's my shoes.

523
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,120
There's me, his and her shoes.

524
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,120
Oh my God, hello.

525
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,880
Oh my God, she wrote that for me.

526
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,820
Oh my God.

527
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,800
Start by- what the fuck is this?

528
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,700
Oh, my girlfriend is so smart.

529
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,880
Guys, look at this.

530
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,420
I don't even know what I'm looking at, but look at this.

531
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,340
I- Oh my God, my girlfriend is so smart.

532
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,580
I have no idea what that is, but oh my God, she's perfect.

533
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,920
Is this what crypto farming is?

534
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,820
Is this how you farm crypto?

535
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Is she farming Bitcoin right now?

536
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,020
Like, what am I looking at?

537
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,520
And then there's my bathroom.

538
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
And everything.

539
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,880
There's two toothbrushes, so you- there's one toothbrush, so you know that we share it.

540
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,020
Alright, turn- To switch, run the program?

541
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,540
How?

542
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Oh, the button.

543
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,000
Put objects on scanner?

544
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,140
What objects?

545
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,040
What can I put?

546
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,670
What kind of object can I put there?

547
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,610
Oh, the pencil?

548
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,240
Oh, I need to find a spoon and a scrunchie.

549
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,240
Okay, that's easy.

550
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,000
Alright, I got the scrunchie.

551
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,260
And then I'll grab the spoon.

552
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,580
There should be a spoon in the kitchen.

553
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,200
I assume this is where the kitchen is.

554
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,100
Yeah.

555
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,820
There's the kitchen.

556
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,420
Oh my god, this is so beautiful.

557
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,220
This is such a nice clean apartment.

558
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Alright, let's put it on.

559
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,880
Alright, scan.

560
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,220
Ready to run.

561
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,340
Alright, run.

562
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,800
Oh, I'm updating to 1.9!

563
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,800
Huh?

564
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,620
I guess I TP?

565
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,040
My NG teleporter in?

566
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,980
Insufficient power.

567
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,740
Restart power.

568
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,880
Oh, I gotta go back and- Hello!

569
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,400
Oh, I don't like this.

570
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,340
Oh, I just got goosebumps.

571
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,940
Oh, I actually got goosebumps from that.

572
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,740
Oh my god, I don't like that.

573
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,520
I don't like that.

574
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,820
Hello?

575
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,230
Hello?

576
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,270
I failed my Windows update.

577
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,230
Who are you?

578
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,750
Find and return the missing batteries of the machine?

579
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,890
Oh no, I thought this was a silly game about me fixing women.

580
00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:00,170
I thought this was a silly- Oh my god.

581
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,250
What happened?

582
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,970
What happened to my silly game?

583
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,930
What happened to my silly game?

584
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,390
What happened?

585
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,270
This is not silly anymore.

586
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,810
This is not silly.

587
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,830
This is not silly.

588
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,690
Locked?

589
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,290
Where is she?

590
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,750
I thought she said she'd be here.

591
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,890
Why isn't she here?

592
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,510
Who are you?

593
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,830
I'm not joking.

594
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,930
One, two, three.

595
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,870
Don't you see me?

596
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,830
One- Wow!

597
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:52,810
Okay.

598
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,150
I don't wanna- okay.

599
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,930
Alright, let's grab- Let's grab the battery.

600
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,030
Hello?

601
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,670
Oh, that's so- who are you?

602
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,950
Who are you?

603
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,330
Oh, who are you?

604
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,670
Oh, who are you?

605
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,330
I'm jokey.

606
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm not jokey.

607
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,610
One, two, three.

608
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,750
I'm not jokey bird.

609
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,990
Stop me.

610
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,470
Hello?

611
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,340
Okay.

612
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,680
Is there anything in here?

613
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,560
Nothing in the little storage room?

614
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Oh, alright.

615
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,890
What's that sound?

616
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,910
Oh, it's my clock.

617
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,510
I don't like this anymore.

618
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,370
Hold on, I forgot to grab the battery.

619
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,650
Alright, can I go back?

620
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,670
Hello?

621
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,850
Oh, there's a TV.

622
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,760
Oh, there's flies.

623
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,040
Oh, why is there so many flies?

624
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,940
I thought we're not in my room anymore.

625
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,220
Okay,

626
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,220
I got one.

627
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,380
Where do I put the other battery?

628
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,830
Where do I put the- I got one in there.

629
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,190
Where do I put the two and three?

630
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,530
Two!

631
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,220
Okay, we'll do that three.

632
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,920
And then we'll put- do four.

633
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
We'll do four now.

634
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,840
Let's do voice volume 157.

635
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,790
Where's the flies going?

636
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,380
Oh, they're going to the fridge.

637
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,760
What's in the fridge?

638
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,720
Oh, it's just battery.

639
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,100
I love you.

640
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,260
Oh, she said it.

641
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,300
Oh, she tried to do a take back seize?

642
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,240
Mita, you gotta say it verbally.

643
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,680
Mita.

644
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,660
Mita, I said it out loud.

645
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,460
Mita.

646
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:46,520
Mita.

647
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,300
I you too.

648
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,240
It's like when you say elephant or something and it looks like you're saying I love you.

649
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,420
Okay, press.

650
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,600
I you.

651
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,860
I you too.

652
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,440
Oh, wait, why is it glowing?

653
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,000
You see those eyes glowing?

654
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,160
Oh, wait, those eyes are glowing just now.

655
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,740
Oh, yay, I transferred my data.

656
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,530
Alright.

657
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,340
Hello, Mita.

658
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,080
Hello, Mita.

659
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,960
Oh, my God.

660
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,420
You're so lucky.

661
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,540
You're so cute.

662
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,920
Oh, my hair is so smart, Mita.

663
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,980
Oh, my God.

664
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,540
Oh, my God, Mita, you're so smart.

665
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,670
Oh, my God, we're together.

666
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,630
Oh, woman!

667
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,190
Oh, my God.

668
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,530
Sorry, I haven't seen a female in a long time.

669
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,810
I've been locked in my Marble Rivals dungeon.

670
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,990
Does the computer work?

671
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,710
Or is it just desk decoration?

672
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,050
Of course it works.

673
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,710
Everything here works exactly like in your world.

674
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,850
Oh, but even better.

675
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,470
I you!

676
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,890
I know, it's because of your job that you've paid me.

677
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,430
So little attention, I know.

678
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,710
It sucks God.

679
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,350
Yeah, I gotta make a living so I can take care of you.

680
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,870
How do you know I sit on my computer a lot?

681
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,490
Your phone camera, it's...

682
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,770
Sometimes, I'm sorry, I've been watching you in secret.

683
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,710
That's not entirely proper, but whatever.

684
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,690
Oh, my God, she's my FBI agent.

685
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,650
Oh, my God.

686
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,870
How did I get...

687
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,850
How did I get inside the game?

688
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,430
Let me explain.

689
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,330
And here you are.

690
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,290
Got it!

691
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,910
Sorry, I like, disassociated, guys.

692
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,630
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,870
When someone starts talking math, I disassociate.

694
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,410
Are you Mita?

695
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,210
I am, and you must be Natoki123, right?

696
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,970
You're back already?

697
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,370
I guess I could help you with that.

698
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,870
But what about me?

699
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,170
Will you stay with me for a while?

700
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,100
Well, I'm not saying no.

701
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,820
What do we do?

702
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,480
What do you want to do, then?

703
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,220
Well, just...

704
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,140
What do we do, Mita?

705
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,660
I didn't say no.

706
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, we could...Oh, we could watch TV!

707
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,760
How many channels do you have?

708
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,600
It doesn't work like that.

709
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,300
I bought you a mini...It's connected to the internet.

710
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,640
So you can watch anything.

711
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,920
At least anything that's available on the web.

712
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,600
Oh, my God!

713
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,760
It's basically YouTube and Netflix!

714
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,020
Wait, what?

715
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,620
What's that?

716
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,980
A circle of kittens?

717
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,840
Oh, my God!

718
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,600
It's the juice!

719
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,840
It's like Pepsiman!

720
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,620
Is he okay?

721
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,460
What?

722
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,300
Wait...

723
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,140
You want some juice?

724
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,560
Yeah, of course.

725
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,040
I'll have TV juice.

726
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,580
It's not the craziest thing I've done today.

727
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,280
Man, I love TV juice!

728
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,820
Thank you for the super chat!

729
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,920
Yeah, what's wrong?

730
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,660
Oh, I just drank his juice blood.

731
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,620
It's all very confusing.

732
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,080
Such peculiar ads.

733
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,140
Yeah, this juice...

734
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,080
It's straight from the juice ad.

735
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,880
Yeah, I would think so.

736
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,440
Guys, it's not weird.

737
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,740
We're literally killing oranges as we drink them.

738
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,300
So it's just...How is it any different?

739
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,460
That's my phone.

740
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,700
And it's no longer in my pocket.

741
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,140
How on Earth did it end up here?

742
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,060
Yeah?

743
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,720
I got an idea.

744
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,600
Let's take a photo.

745
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,420
Okay.

746
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,820
Oh my God, it's me!

747
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Sorry, I look dead inside.

748
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,520
I've been sleeping three hours a day.

749
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,460
That's a great picture.

750
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,460
I got a question.

751
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,540
No, it doesn't work that way.

752
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:22,660
Wait.

753
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,720
How does it work?

754
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,720
Okay.

755
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:30,840
Alright.

756
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,420
The programmer games.

757
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,700
I've been programming, you know?

758
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,640
Why is there an electrical panel here?

759
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,240
And if we're a game, what's it for?

760
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,200
We're in a game.

761
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,200
So asking why is pointless.

762
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,460
However, it does restart the electricity.

763
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,320
Everything here is made based on your world.

764
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,140
Okay, cool.

765
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,160
I've played a ton, but I've never seen it rain here.

766
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,980
Why have an umbrella?

767
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,940
It rains just very rarely.

768
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,120
You just haven't seen it yet.

769
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,360
Maybe one day you will.

770
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,680
And then you'll need an umbrella.

771
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Don't you think?

772
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,760
Just unprogram the rain.

773
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,360
Not yet, perhaps later?

774
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,680
Let's stay here for now.

775
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,860
Here at home.

776
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,160
Okay, that's not a red flag.

777
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,140
Oh, what's this?

778
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,960
A ring?

779
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,760
Why is there a ring here?

780
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Oh, you know, you could just come in.

781
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,180
Oh, okay.

782
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,560
We're the ring girl.

783
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,060
Oh my god, this is so freaky.

784
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,840
This is actually so freaky.

785
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,540
What the fuck?

786
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,440
Yeah, I can cut the carrots.

787
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,720
You weren't just here now.

788
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
We're in a game.

789
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,820
Come on, give me a hand.

790
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,200
Let's cut some carrots.

791
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,620
I trained for this, guys.

792
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,960
Oh my god, I actually...

793
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,340
That's so creative!

794
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,080
I actually have to move.

795
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,100
I'm like moving my mouse up and down.

796
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,000
That's so creative.

797
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,320
Oh my god.

798
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,180
I'm so immersed.

799
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,400
This is 10 out of 10.

800
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,040
Oh my god, they're in the bathroom.

801
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,100
Oh my god, I don't ever want to leave.

802
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:38,880
Alright.

803
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,120
Alright, time to go in the bathroom for Mito.

804
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,500
Oh!

805
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,040
Oh?

806
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,360
Is that Bitcoin?

807
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,200
Why is there cockroaches in my fucking...

808
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,540
Why are there cockroaches in my video game?

809
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,760
That's so fucked.

810
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,440
Programming cockroaches.

811
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,080
Like...

812
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,300
We can program anything else and we program cockroaches in my fucking...

813
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,860
dream apartment with my wife.

814
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,140
Why am I trying to find it?

815
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,740
Oh, there it is.

816
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,340
There's scissors.

817
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,920
Who's Misaki?

818
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,380
Oh, they're bugs!

819
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,160
Oh my god, my mind is blown.

820
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,980
That's why the vent opened!

821
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,680
Because a bug caused the vent!

822
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,900
Oh my god.

823
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,460
10 out of 10.

824
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,180
My mind has been officially blown.

825
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,120
Now have a seat.

826
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,520
Okay.

827
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,400
Would you like some sauce?

828
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,940
What happens if I say no?

829
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,660
Why do I not want sauce on my...

830
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,520
Why would I want ketchup?

831
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,280
No thank you.

832
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,780
Sauce really enhances the flavor.

833
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,460
I'm gonna talk about the cartridges before I gave her the scissors.

834
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,300
What's the matter?

835
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,580
I found cartridges in the air vent.

836
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,840
They had names on them.

837
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,100
What's the deal with that?

838
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,880
What cartridges?

839
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,200
Let's figure that out together.

840
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,600
But later.

841
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,700
Right now.

842
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,680
We've got it late.

843
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,500
Pass me the scissors, please.

844
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,600
Alright, here's the scissors.

845
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,680
Now she's definitely gonna fucking kill me.

846
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,040
You know, I thought I had an option to not give her the scissors.

847
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:50,330
Nice.

848
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,090
How about chat?

849
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,570
Before we dig in.

850
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,490
Bon appetit.

851
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,870
Why are the windows all just white light?

852
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,590
John, thank you for the super chat.

853
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:09,610
Thank you.

854
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,810
This is the perfect world.

855
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:11,970
I wanna live there.

856
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,090
I know, right?

857
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,290
We have everything we want.

858
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:19,030
It didn't strike me as that odd.

859
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,090
Honestly, it looks classy.

860
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,870
Yeah, I think so too.

861
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,970
It's a void lag, you know?

862
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,570
Yep, there's still a few unsquished bugs.

863
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,930
Let's just hope you don't run into any.

864
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:33,650
Alright.

865
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:39,790
So, why use scissors when we could use...I don't wanna judge her.

866
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,430
This feels like a dream.

867
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,630
A dream so you wanna escape and forget this ever happened.

868
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,490
No, no, that's not it.

869
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,030
It's just...it's perfect meat, though.

870
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,790
It's...but you seem so real.

871
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,210
I'm very real.

872
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:57,690
Just like meat, you silly head.

873
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,950
Your home is cozy, Mito.

874
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,590
It is, isn't it?

875
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,050
You can say it.

876
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,310
I don't mind at all.

877
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,010
Actually, I'm all for it.

878
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:10,970
Bon appetit.

879
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,970
Why would I wanna go home?

880
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,530
I literally have my dream wife right here.

881
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,970
I don't have to work.

882
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,650
She takes care of me.

883
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,990
She cooks for me.

884
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,010
She has...the TV has...

885
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,230
TV juice.

886
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,790
Why would I leave?

887
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,030
True.

888
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,130
Bon appetit.

889
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,410
I don't think she needs fixing.

890
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,150
Thank you.

891
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,430
Finished it all already?

892
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:42,530
See?

893
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,390
My portion feels endless.

894
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,290
Alright, I'll stand up.

895
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,450
I'll put the dishes into the sink.

896
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:53,830
Huh?

897
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,510
What?

898
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,750
Why is this...what?

899
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,190
What's wrong with Mito?

900
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,150
What's happening?

901
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:03,410
Mito, why is...why?

902
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,490
Mito, what's going on?

903
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:06,610
Mito!

904
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:07,630
Mito!

905
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,310
Mito!

906
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:09,710
Mito!

907
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:16,420
I don't feel so good, Mito.

908
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,980
The pit rain!

909
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,400
What's going...my injury, my pit rain!

910
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,380
I think I know what...can you stand up?

911
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,240
I'll try my best, Mito.

912
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,960
Was it the TV juice?

913
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,120
Was I not...oh my god.

914
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,940
Was I not allowed...did I forgot to pay for my internet plan?

915
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,400
Mito, I don't know if I set up auto plan on my internet.

916
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,680
Mito, I'm lagging.

917
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,900
Mito, I got 300 ping.

918
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,140
Mito, what's going on?

919
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,100
Mito...

920
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,620
What's going on?

921
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,380
What are these?

922
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,160
Pills?

923
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,580
They'll make you feel better soon?

924
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,020
Go to the mirror.

925
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,220
Do I just...do I just take my meds?

926
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,680
Oh, if she tells me to take my meds, then it has to be true.

927
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,240
I'll take my meds for you, Mito.

928
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,380
How are you feeling?

929
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,020
Any better?

930
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,700
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

931
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,880
That worked fast, Mito.

932
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,540
Not douki123, we're in a game.

933
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,320
Things are much simpler here.

934
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,120
Even the smallest efforts gives great results.

935
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,100
It's all part of the game's concept.

936
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,000
Simplification.

937
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,740
We'll take carrots.

938
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,160
You cut one.

939
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,520
But it's as if you cut three.

940
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,380
Look, this is all very sudden.

941
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,920
I'm scared.

942
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,360
More than a little.

943
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,300
Mito?

944
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,480
Mito?

945
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,460
Things get weird.

946
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,780
Mito?

947
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,280
Mito?

948
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,680
Where are you, my darling?

949
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,660
Wait, there's two doors now.

950
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,100
What?

951
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,460
What's going on?

952
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,620
The whole room rearranged.

953
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,300
Wait, did I take my meds and she disappeared?

954
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,060
No, she's real.

955
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,500
She's real.

956
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,120
Mito?

957
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,660
The normal pills took her away from me.

958
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,640
Oh no, she's here!

959
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,340
I knew it!

960
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,200
Mito!

961
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,900
I knew you were real.

962
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,860
Yeah, I'm awake.

963
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,320
How did you get here?

964
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,160
You were right next to me just now.

965
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,800
No, I wasn't.

966
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,840
You froze before the mirror.

967
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,280
So I left.

968
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,240
Yeah, she's right.

969
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,300
She's not gaslighting.

970
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:12,720
I rearranged the place to make you feel more at home.

971
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,900
In here, we can change the rooms however we want.

972
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,940
You didn't have to.

973
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,540
I was getting used to the layout.

974
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,400
By the way, I think I feel more at ease with this layout.

975
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,620
Yeah, but our bedroom was next to the bathroom.

976
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,640
Now I have to walk through the living room to get to the bathroom?

977
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,440
What if I really, really need a pee?

978
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,560
It's about convenience, Mito.

979
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,140
Think about the convenience!

980
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,480
Alright.

981
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:51,980
What?

982
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,700
This happens sometimes.

983
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,300
The room gets stuck loading.

984
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,020
Mito, I'm sorry.

985
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,540
My bitrate fucking sucks.

986
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,200
I'm sorry.

987
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,120
I bought the cheapest plan, Mito.

988
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,720
I spent it all on you.

989
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,740
Don't worry.

990
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,260
I'll work hard for fiber.

991
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,740
Along with the world's core.

992
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,820
Typical, don't you think?

993
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,200
Anyway, we can play a console game.

994
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,780
A game within a game?

995
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,680
You choose?

996
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,620
Oh my god, I wanna play console games.

997
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,400
Alright, let's go.

998
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,220
I'm gonna get my gamer wife.

999
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,880
Oh my- it's the dream.

1000
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,280
A gamer girlfriend.

1001
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,020
Let's go.

1002
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:45,950
The fuck?

1003
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,690
Star X I.

1004
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,170
What do you wanna play?

1005
00:53:52,930 --> 00:54:00,430
We can play Penguin Piles or Terrorist Scand- I mean, looking at those legs, I know exactly what game I wanna play.

1006
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,430
This is a fighting game.

1007
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,550
Let's see who's sours first.

1008
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,130
What a game.

1009
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,910
Okay, crouch E.

1010
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,730
Four times.

1011
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,650
Bring it on.

1012
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,350
Don't you worry.

1013
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,710
I'll go easy on ya first.

1014
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:22,630
Why the fu- okay.

1015
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:26,830
That's right.

1016
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,510
That's right.

1017
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:29,530
That's right.

1018
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,390
What you gonna do?

1019
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,070
That's right.

1020
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,730
I'm crouch- That's right.

1021
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,970
I figured it out.

1022
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,030
That's a good boy.

1023
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,430
You better focus.

1024
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,670
What do you mean I won?

1025
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:39,930
Get over here.

1026
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,570
Just because you're my wife, you think I'll go easy on you?

1027
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:45,330
That's right.

1028
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,250
You just gotta get better.

1029
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,310
That's right.

1030
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,630
I don't go easy.

1031
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:56,110
I'm gonna make you a better player by beating the shit out of you in this video game.

1032
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:57,670
Get over here.

1033
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:58,970
That's right.

1034
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,230
You think you can jump over everything?

1035
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:00,650
Come on.

1036
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,590
Get over here.

1037
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:02,550
You gonna cry?

1038
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,210
No.

1039
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,590
You gotta get good at video games if you're gonna be my gamer girlfriend.

1040
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:12,490
Alright.

1041
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,570
You think I'm gonna get an alt account for you?

1042
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,050
We're playing on the main.

1043
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,870
Simply, you are incredible.

1044
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,290
That's some skill.

1045
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:29,810
Uh-oh.

1046
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:31,990
Alright, wanna play something else?

1047
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:32,830
Or you're done?

1048
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,310
Okay, I really like Dairy- We can play Dairy Scandal again.

1049
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,790
Wait, we had a milk for now?

1050
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,590
Let's do something else?

1051
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,810
What do you mean?

1052
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,810
But this is my favorite game.

1053
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1054
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:51,150
Thank you.

1055
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:55,970
Alright, what's Penguin Pals?

1056
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,990
We're playing on the main ever.

1057
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,450
The one who collects more wins?

1058
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,530
Let's play two rounds, okay?

1059
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,690
That's not fair.

1060
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,210
I'm so uncoordinated.

1061
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,290
You're literally AI.

1062
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:20,150
You have a programmed path.

1063
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,530
Oh my god.

1064
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,490
Wait, she's actually so good at this.

1065
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,250
JK.

1066
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,410
Nah, I know you can't get more.

1067
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,380
Nice.

1068
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,920
How did you get that many?

1069
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,500
Your AI still needs work.

1070
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,700
I'm gonna take her side.

1071
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:53,180
So like, I know she can't- She needs more learning material for this AI.

1072
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,780
You think I'm gonna go easy on you?

1073
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,520
You want this one little snowball right here?

1074
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,170
Toki is such a trier.

1075
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,630
Toki, you're supposed to let her win.

1076
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,750
We should get you unrealized.

1077
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,950
No, I want her to be the very best.

1078
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:21,250
She will learn if I go easy on her.

1079
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:21,610
Alright.

1080
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,130
Oh, we're going to the bedroom?

1081
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:26,810
Alright.

1082
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,630
I feel great after a great game.

1083
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,670
I'm ready to go to the bedroom too.

1084
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:32,810
Let's go.

1085
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,310
C'mon.

1086
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,590
Where did the portal go?

1087
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,370
Or what it was you called it.

1088
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,990
How's the volume so far?

1089
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,050
Little magic I used to move it.

1090
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,810
Somewhere else.

1091
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,930
We don't need it anymore.

1092
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,050
It just get in the way.

1093
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:59,570
Alright, after I won those two games, I feel so good about myself.

1094
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,050
Right?

1095
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,270
Shall we play?

1096
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,750
The game works like this.

1097
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,370
This chip indicates a type.

1098
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:13,290
Such as health.

1099
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,630
We each play a card.

1100
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:25,110
And if your card has a higher health stat than mine, you win.

1101
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:26,830
But it's not skill.

1102
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,790
Oh, you want to win on a non-skilled game?

1103
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,190
No wonder you won't play this game.

1104
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,110
It's my turn.

1105
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,430
I'll go first.

1106
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,370
Oh!

1107
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,830
Oh, it's a card game!

1108
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,850
I thought it was like something else.

1109
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,370
Okay, wait.

1110
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,510
10, right?

1111
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:54,870
Uh...

1112
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:58,610
Oh, hide card.

1113
00:58:58,650 --> 00:58:59,370
What's hide card?

1114
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:00,470
Oh, like this.

1115
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,010
Wait, that's not fair.

1116
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:02,890
What happens?

1117
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,390
Okay, maybe it'll be even then.

1118
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:05,250
Right?

1119
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:08,510
That's a draw.

1120
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:14,710
Oh.

1121
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:14,710
Oh.

1122
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:15,610
Alright.

1123
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:17,730
I'll just do this.

1124
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,250
What if I just draw everything?

1125
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,150
Oh, it just needs more health, right?

1126
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,930
You need attack stat?

1127
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:31,430
Okay.

1128
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:34,410
There you go.

1129
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,230
Get in here.

1130
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,790
I'll just draw everything.

1131
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,390
Alright.

1132
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,680
Nobody wins.

1133
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,180
That's right.

1134
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,880
It's all about...

1135
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,800
Wait, how do you have two?

1136
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,320
That's fine.

1137
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,540
I also have one too.

1138
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,680
There's no...

1139
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,520
Oh, what's that?

1140
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,100
What's that sound?

1141
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,760
It's coming from the wardrobe?

1142
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,480
I didn't hear anything.

1143
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,200
What did you think you heard?

1144
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,060
There was a sound?

1145
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,400
I thought that was part of the soundtrack.

1146
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,840
But, there's no one there.

1147
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,120
I'd like to open it and check.

1148
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,440
I'm a bit creeped out.

1149
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:32,880
But why?

1150
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,820
This again?

1151
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,400
What?

1152
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,300
Are you okay?

1153
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,340
What?

1154
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,260
What's in here?

1155
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:43,720
Hello?

1156
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,020
What's up with you?

1157
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:48,900
It's a wardrobe.

1158
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,560
I've got my underwear there.

1159
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,960
Are you hiding something from me?

1160
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,040
Why won't you just believe me?

1161
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,760
What am I doing wrong?

1162
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,820
What I want... All I want...

1163
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,100
Is for you to be with me.

1164
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,080
But you want me to be with you?

1165
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,100
We don't share secrets.

1166
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,740
Why are you so stuck on that wardrobe?

1167
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,480
I want to know what on earth that knocking was.

1168
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,340
This world has four rooms?

1169
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,920
Isn't that enough for you?

1170
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,020
Why can't you just be with me?

1171
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,220
The fuck do you mean?

1172
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,200
Whoops.

1173
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,820
Avoid looking in the vent.

1174
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,400
Collect a refrigerator.

1175
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,980
Guys, do you think...

1176
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,040
Guys, do you think I made it?

1177
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,560
Do you think I got locked in?

1178
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,800
Guys, do you think...

1179
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,740
Guys, do you think I made it?

1180
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:11,760
Alright.

1181
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,160
I get it.

1182
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,720
I was this close, guys.

1183
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,300
I was so close.

1184
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,780
Whoa, what?

1185
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,840
Creak in the dark?

1186
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,400
Oh, it's so very dark.

1187
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,240
Whoa.

1188
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,600
Whoa, I don't want to play anymore.

1189
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,320
Whoa.

1190
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:39,750
Oh.

1191
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,410
Oh, I guess we're not playing.

1192
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,670
Oh my god, I was this close to unlocking it, guys.

1193
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,630
I was so close.

1194
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:03,570
Hello, my beautiful, lovely wife.

1195
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,250
Hello, my beautiful, lovely wife who I love very much and is not going to kill me.

1196
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,560
Hello.

1197
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,840
Oh, whoa.

1198
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,320
Whoa.

1199
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,220
Hello?

1200
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,000
Hello?

1201
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,210
Hello?

1202
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,700
Are you scared?

1203
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,760
Yes, I'm so scared.

1204
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,900
I'm actually scared.

1205
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,160
Hello?

1206
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,510
I'm actually so scared.

1207
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,810
I'm actually so scared.

1208
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,030
I am, Vita.

1209
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,410
I'm scared.

1210
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,810
I'm sorry.

1211
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,810
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,810
Oh my god, I'm so fucking scared.

1213
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:39,850
I'm so fucking scared, Vita.

1214
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,090
Vita, this isn't funny.

1215
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,090
This isn't funny, Vita.

1216
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:53,670
Oh, she hasn't died.

1217
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,730
She's going to fucking kill me, guys.

1218
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,080
Why did I take the sauce?

1219
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,640
Why did I take the sauce?

1220
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,420
I'm sorry.

1221
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,200
I'm so sorry.

1222
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,920
Oh my god.

1223
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,240
Oh my god.

1224
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:22,220
I'm actually so scared.

1225
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,620
I'm so scared.

1226
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:30,700
Oh my god, I'm so sorry, Vita.

1227
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,580
I'm sorry.

1228
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,800
I don't get shit up you think in the sauce.

1229
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,280
Oh my god, I'm scared.

1230
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,720
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

1231
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,600
Vita's so scary.

1232
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,080
I'm sorry.

1233
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:54,960
I'm sorry, Vita.

1234
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,320
Oh my god.

1235
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,400
Do whatever you want me to do.

1236
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,420
Oh my god.

1237
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
Find me.

1238
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,140
Find me.

1239
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,660
Find me.

1240
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,260
Okay, I guess.

1241
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,900
Okay, I'm sorry.

1242
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,320
I didn't know that's not where you want me to go, Vita.

1243
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,560
Oh, find me.

1244
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,720
Oh my god.

1245
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,160
No, find me.

1246
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,200
Vita?

1247
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,010
Are you in your room, Vita?

1248
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,330
Because I didn't know this was a horror game.

1249
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,730
I actually didn't know.

1250
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,070
I thought this was a...

1251
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,750
I thought this was just a silly game.

1252
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,730
I thought this was a silly game.

1253
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:02,650
I really thought this was a silly game.

1254
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,150
Oh, I'm trying to find you.

1255
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:11,130
I actually went in so fucking blind.

1256
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:14,090
I just saw so many people left reviews.

1257
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,050
And I was like, oh, that's the new FOMO game of the year.

1258
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:25,300
Oh my god, I didn't know.

1259
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,700
Vita, I don't know where you are and I'm gonna cry.

1260
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,280
I actually don't know where you are, Vita.

1261
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,600
Vita, please.

1262
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,600
Vita, I don't know.

1263
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,320
I'm so scared.

1264
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,280
I'm scared.

1265
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:59,900
I thought I had a cute wife.

1266
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,080
I mean, I don't know where to go.

1267
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,060
I'm actually...

1268
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,220
Vita?

1269
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,840
Her tummy hurt.

1270
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,810
Your tummy hurt?

1271
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,070
Vita, why are you just legs?

1272
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,630
Vita, what happened?

1273
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,470
I mean, I can work with that.

1274
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,130
I can work with that.

1275
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,010
Where's the rest of your body?

1276
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:56,110
Vita?

1277
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,970
Okay, I'm following.

1278
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,240
Oh, there's a key.

1279
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,900
This should be the basement, right?

1280
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,980
Is the game over?

1281
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:30,470
Hello?

1282
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:33,850
I'm in the basement now.

1283
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,450
Who's that?

1284
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,670
Vita?

1285
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:43,670
How on earth did you get in here?

1286
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,150
You're Vita, aren't you?

1287
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:48,410
Or is there something different about you?

1288
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,870
Wait, I'm not the Vita you met before.

1289
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,270
There's multiple Vitas?

1290
01:09:59,410 --> 01:09:59,970
Sinister.

1291
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,090
Something sinister?

1292
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:05,410
There's no time to explain.

1293
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:07,530
If this works out, I'll tell you everything.

1294
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,070
But the key is next to the sofa.

1295
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,650
What do you mean?

1296
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:19,370
Oh my god, I've never...

1297
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,970
Oh my god, I freaked out so hard.

1298
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,230
I've never been so scared before this game.

1299
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,610
Mentally, I was...

1300
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,830
Oh my god, they're all Bitcoin farmers.

1301
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,170
It's next to the sofa?

1302
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:44,350
I think it's also because I went in thinking it was a silly game, so I was not mentally prepared for this.

1303
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:48,990
I was definitely not mentally prepared for all of this.

1304
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,950
Take this ring.

1305
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,690
You want to get out of here, don't you?

1306
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,730
Then put it on.

1307
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,470
It's a useful artifact.

1308
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:03,970
You'll likely need it soon.

1309
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,830
Okay.

1310
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,310
It's on.

1311
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:14,450
By the way, I'm...

1312
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,210
Not Doki123?

1313
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:21,530
I'm Misa?

1314
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:24,070
What?

1315
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:32,690
Why are you locked up?

1316
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:36,370
Tell you the truth?

1317
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:41,910
I was keeping a player company when something suddenly changed.

1318
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:50,990
Then she showed up and turned the player into a cartridge then locked me up.

1319
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,450
Wait, she turned him into a cartridge?

1320
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,110
Can she even do that?

1321
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:57,970
But why?

1322
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,390
What does she need the players for?

1323
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,470
She's obviously crazy.

1324
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:06,870
She's just playing with us and using us for her own machination.

1325
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,970
Turning players into cartridges to farm more crypto.

1326
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,350
Some didn't even realize what was happening to them.

1327
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,930
And some that do don't even fight back.

1328
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,850
Now that's a dark twist.

1329
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,630
Guys, I need another 48 of you.

1330
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,410
I need you.

1331
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,290
If you help us, I'll help you.

1332
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,330
This might be our only chance.

1333
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,590
The ring will lead you to the right version.

1334
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,990
I'll meet you there.

1335
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,330
Why keep the key?

1336
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:42,710
I need to stay.

1337
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:45,570
There are questions I need to ask her.

1338
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,750
To find out more about her.

1339
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,630
Though it's unlikely she'll play ball.

1340
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,690
What's never mine?

1341
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:57,630
I just leave.

1342
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:02,410
I still don't quite understand what I saw up there.

1343
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:04,630
That Mita.

1344
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:07,170
Was she trying to kill me?

1345
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:08,810
Kill?

1346
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,870
She has a worse fate than that in mind for you.

1347
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,230
You need to hurry.

1348
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,170
She's gonna turn me into a blockchain.

1349
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,830
A fate worse than death.

1350
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,110
The horror.

1351
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:24,910
Pick it up.

1352
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:25,510
See that?

1353
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,210
I'm gonna turn into an NFT.

1354
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,530
Are we watching a recording?

1355
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,250
Who's that with her?

1356
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:40,050
That's happening in this very moment.

1357
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,410
It's another player.

1358
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,230
She's using him.

1359
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:48,030
She might try to turn you into a cartridge too.

1360
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,510
I need to get out of here ASAP.

1361
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,050
Yes, we do.

1362
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:57,230
So you're saying that she's using him.

1363
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,950
If I pull the cartridge out, what happens?

1364
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:07,270
That may very well damage the cartridge.

1365
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,650
Which means that the player would...oh my god.

1366
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,090
Just blow on it.

1367
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:14,370
Just blow on the cartridge.

1368
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:15,390
It'll fix it.

1369
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:23,480
Yeah, I see the button.

1370
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,000
Yeah, found it.

1371
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,280
Press it.

1372
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,540
I'm pressing it.

1373
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,140
What am I doing to him?

1374
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,020
He has a ring too.

1375
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:36,860
Hide.

1376
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:37,340
Wait.

1377
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,560
Am

1378
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:54,550
I safe here?

1379
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:11,210
I don't like this.

1380
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,250
I don't like that I have to hide.

1381
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:20,190
What do you need the players for?

1382
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,090
There are no toys.

1383
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:27,690
Oh my god, Sydney!

1384
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:38,860
I just wanted to be involved in the conversation.

1385
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,100
Is that too much to ask for?

1386
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,260
I just wanted to be included.

1387
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,520
I wanted to be included in the conversation.

1388
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,240
I wanted to be included in the conversation.

1389
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,040
I got too absorbed in the lore.

1390
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,340
Oh my god.

1391
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,210
I'm running as fast as I can.

1392
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:23,420
What do I do?

1393
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:28,820
Oh.

1394
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,160
Oh, that's me.

1395
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,150
I'm sorry, I just...

1396
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:45,990
I just saw the camera and I got curious.

1397
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:46,570
I got curious.

1398
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:52,670
I saw...

1399
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:56,730
I got curious.

1400
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:58,470
I was like, whoa, light.

1401
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:07,250
I was like, where does that light come from?

1402
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,090
It's like a little moth.

1403
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,890
I saw the light.

1404
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:11,090
Sydney!

1405
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,030
It led me straight.

1406
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,690
Oh my god.

1407
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:22,070
Oh my god, I didn't know this game was a stealth game.

1408
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:24,210
I didn't know.

1409
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:27,830
I didn't know this was a stealth game.

1410
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,450
I didn't know.

1411
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:34,610
I thought this was a silly game.

1412
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,830
Oh, it's untextured.

1413
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,490
Where's the texture?

1414
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:42,690
Where did the texture go?

1415
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,210
Oh my god.

1416
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,550
Where did you put the texture?

1417
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:49,930
Okay.

1418
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:55,210
I don't want to be here too late.

1419
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:59,010
Oh my god, they didn't finish texturizing this room.

1420
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,000
Oh my god, where am I?

1421
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,940
Oh my god.

1422
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,500
Oh my god.

1423
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,920
Just hug Raid.

1424
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,380
Oh, just always hug Raid.

1425
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,800
Just always.

1426
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,600
The game is corrupted.

1427
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,200
We gotta repair the files.

1428
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,380
We gotta repair the files.

1429
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,380
Where am I?

1430
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,320
Oh my god.

1431
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,580
What a silly game.

1432
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,080
What a fun silly game.

1433
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,700
What a fun silly game.

1434
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:37,960
What a fun silly game.

1435
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:38,920
Oh, okay.

1436
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,140
Okay.

1437
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:41,740
Hello?

1438
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,900
Hello, are you okay?

1439
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,640
Hey, you new here?

1440
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,340
Oh my god.

1441
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,140
You're from the real world, aren't you?

1442
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,380
Yeah, that's me.

1443
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,380
I am.

1444
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,120
Um, are you alright?

1445
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:57,500
It's just live.

1446
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,620
Don't worry about it.

1447
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,460
It's been about a year and I'm doing great.

1448
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,940
Well, what is this?

1449
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,160
It's some sort of space between versions.

1450
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,420
Do you know how to get out of here?

1451
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,080
Can't say that I do.

1452
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,280
Besides, I don't want to leave.

1453
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,600
I don't need to.

1454
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,140
Why not?

1455
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,200
Enough chatting.

1456
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,540
I'm in a hurry.

1457
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:29,080
My beloved Mita is waiting for- Oh, he's far too good.

1458
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,120
It's cause he fixed her, guys.

1459
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:41,700
Guys, it's cause- Guys, he likes- It's cause he fixed her, guys.

1460
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,160
He fixed that version of Mita.

1461
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,460
Guys...

1462
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,120
There's nothing wrong.

1463
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,960
We've lost him.

1464
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,660
We've lost him, Doki.

1465
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,100
Hello?

1466
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,220
Oh my god.

1467
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,060
What the fuck?

1468
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,540
Who are these little people?

1469
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:02,900
Why?

1470
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:06,180
Don't kick me out if I don't finish on time.

1471
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:06,920
Don't kick me out if I don't finish on time.

1472
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,100
Time to wash up and I have too much food.

1473
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,660
Who the fuck are you?

1474
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:12,840
Where's- Are you devs?

1475
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,500
I've saved everything.

1476
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,540
Where's the computer?

1477
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,940
Who am I?

1478
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,800
Doesn't anyone love- Are you like mini developers?

1479
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:25,880
Okay, I'll lead you in.

1480
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,060
Any Wallace?

1481
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,160
Alright, I'll lead you in.

1482
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,820
Go fix this game.

1483
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,320
The mini devs.

1484
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,360
Fix this game, devs.

1485
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,480
Developers, do your job.

1486
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,920
Fix this game.

1487
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:41,900
Alright.

1488
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:48,020
My beloved Doki is waiting for you.

1489
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,160
Moncler, thank you for the superchat.

1490
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,240
Thank you, thank you.

1491
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,080
Alright, up the ladder we go.

1492
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,160
Hello?

1493
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,640
Anybody here?

1494
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:06,820
Alright.

1495
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,600
Alright, should I go down the dark hallway?

1496
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,100
Or just go straight forward?

1497
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:11,980
Let's go forward.

1498
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,840
I made it.

1499
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,760
What is this place?

1500
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,660
Space car.

1501
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,260
Oh my god.

1502
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,920
Finally, I can game.

1503
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,780
It's been three hours.

1504
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:29,800
I can finally do what I enjoy the most.

1505
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,700
Finally, a real game.

1506
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,600
Wait, okay.

1507
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,300
Okay, I think the square is the nitro.

1508
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:45,960
Yeah, yeah.

1509
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,660
If I grab this square, I get nitro.

1510
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,000
Just like Discord Nitro.

1511
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,580
Okay.

1512
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,320
Oh, oh, oh.

1513
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,880
Oh wait, no, I do get more.

1514
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,280
I just have to wait.

1515
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,900
Oh my god, where are all the other squares though?

1516
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,040
Wait, that's not fair.

1517
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,460
That's not fair.

1518
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,200
They're also using nitro.

1519
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,520
Oh my god, I don't know where I'm going.

1520
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,200
Alright, three.

1521
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,720
I still have...

1522
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,920
Oh wait, no.

1523
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,820
These are laps.

1524
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,300
I don't know what the three out of six means.

1525
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,700
No way.

1526
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,680
You booted up the game the moment you saw it.

1527
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:29,140
What?

1528
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,800
Guys, I'm going through withdrawals right now.

1529
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,320
I was lost in the maze for so long.

1530
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,820
Mita understands.

1531
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,120
Oh, it means I'm third place.

1532
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:44,440
Oh.

1533
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,000
Okay, now I get it.

1534
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:47,980
But what are these for?

1535
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,360
What are the Qs for?

1536
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:50,660
Alright.

1537
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,160
That makes much more sense.

1538
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,040
What the fuck is three out of six?

1539
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:57,840
No!

1540
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,820
I need a game, bro.

1541
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,440
Exactly.

1542
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,200
I need a game.

1543
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,320
Oh, I got S rank.

1544
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:07,200
What?

1545
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,400
Defeat the boss?

1546
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,080
Defeat the boss?

1547
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:17,660
Wait.

1548
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:18,600
Wait, how?

1549
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:19,400
Wait.

1550
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,160
Wait a minute.

1551
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,720
How do I defeat something when I don't have anything to use?

1552
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,820
Wait a minute.

1553
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:26,500
Wait.

1554
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,880
How did my video game get invaded?

1555
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,480
I thought this was a simple racing game.

1556
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:34,640
What's going on?

1557
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,080
Alright, that's fine.

1558
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:37,380
Okay.

1559
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:38,860
How do I defeat her?

1560
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,640
How do I defeat her?

1561
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,440
Instructions unclear.

1562
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,420
I just drive.

1563
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,000
Vroom vroom.

1564
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:48,880
Fight!

1565
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,740
Guys, how do I fight back?

1566
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,580
What is he doing?

1567
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,760
What is he doing to me?

1568
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,920
What is he doing to me?

1569
01:23:58,980 --> 01:23:59,860
Oh, nitro.

1570
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:00,860
Okay, nice.

1571
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,340
I don't know what he did.

1572
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,920
I don't know what he did to me.

1573
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:08,620
Oh, that's how you defeat her.

1574
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,000
Okay.

1575
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,340
It's a sonic adventure.

1576
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:13,340
What the fuck?

1577
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,560
Alright, don't worry.

1578
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,440
Maybe I can leave the game if I defeat it.

1579
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,020
I can leave the game within the game.

1580
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,980
I think I have like one life.

1581
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,760
Like, I have no idea.

1582
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,000
Because it doesn't even say how many lives I get.

1583
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:30,240
For this.

1584
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,220
So it's like, honestly quite brutal.

1585
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,160
If I die.

1586
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:34,900
Alright.

1587
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:37,780
Vroom vroom.

1588
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,280
I can't believe it.

1589
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,300
Before I can leave the other game, I have to leave this game first.

1590
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,440
I have to leave the game within the game.

1591
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,720
No, that's his life.

1592
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,820
Yeah, but that's his life.

1593
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,040
I wonder how many lives I have.

1594
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:57,420
Okay.

1595
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,180
Don't worry, I got my nitro.

1596
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,680
My discord nitro is here.

1597
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,460
Alright, one more.

1598
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,420
Yeah, I have a feeling I die in one hit.

1599
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:07,940
It's...

1600
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:09,840
Where's my life?

1601
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,640
That's okay.

1602
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,440
That's fine.

1603
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:15,520
I'll just stay in this corner.

1604
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,120
Alright, alright.

1605
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,040
Okay, I need to focus up.

1606
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,120
I only have one life.

1607
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,400
Alright, that's fine.

1608
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,240
Okay.

1609
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,240
Now I just need to avoid these.

1610
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,380
Vroom vroom.

1611
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,040
Vroom vroom.

1612
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,100
Alright, that's nice of her to just spawn them on the right side.

1613
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,920
I literally stay on the left and I should be fine.

1614
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:39,600
Nice.

1615
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,460
Okay, last one.

1616
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,180
I'm so locked in.

1617
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,040
Alright, scan me!

1618
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,760
Scan me!

1619
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,340
Alright, shift.

1620
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,040
Shift.

1621
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,080
My...

1622
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,740
Shift!

1623
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:55,840
Yeah!

1624
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:01,000
I earned the achievement vroom vroom.

1625
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,560
Actually...

1626
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,220
It actually is called vroom vroom.

1627
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,160
Alright, I did it.

1628
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,040
Did I win anything?

1629
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,520
Mito, did you see it?

1630
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:13,920
Mito, did you...

1631
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,700
Mito, did you see it?

1632
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:23,860
Mito?

1633
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:24,680
Come over here.

1634
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,820
Did you see it though?

1635
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,540
Did I win anything?

1636
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,000
Time to clear some things up, don't you think?

1637
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,280
Oh, do we have time for that?

1638
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,120
So how did I get here?

1639
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,460
It's a great invention.

1640
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,540
Only a player that has it can find their way out to the correct version.

1641
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,720
Yeah, but that guy had a fucking collar on his neck.

1642
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,320
What did you do with the ring?

1643
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,580
I changed the route.

1644
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,020
The one we need.

1645
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,700
I set up the shortest one possible.

1646
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,140
Stuffing it with all we need.

1647
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,780
It works like this.

1648
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:12,740
You open a door and the ring opens the boundary.

1649
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,120
Between versions.

1650
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,020
So what is this place?

1651
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,620
These passages connect the different versions.

1652
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,060
This is kind of empty in here.

1653
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:23,760
And yikes!

1654
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,400
I heard about this one Mito.

1655
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,620
Who couldn't achieve her...

1656
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,980
Archive her version.

1657
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,280
Her house...

1658
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,520
Simply ceased to exist.

1659
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:38,600
And she's supposedly hanging around these passages.

1660
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,940
Poor thing.

1661
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,680
So how did you get here?

1662
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:48,020
You know?

1663
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:50,200
It's been a while since we last met.

1664
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,020
And thanks to you.

1665
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,700
I got out of that damn cage.

1666
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,580
It's been 10 minutes.

1667
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,360
I escaped from that lunatic.

1668
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,480
And FYI.

1669
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,180
I can easily switch between different versions.

1670
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,180
Unlike you my dear.

1671
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,280
It's been 10 minutes.

1672
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:07,860
Oh my god.

1673
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,820
Are we like in some way where 10 minutes is like 20 years?

1674
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:11,880
Like...

1675
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,480
Like what do you mean?

1676
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:13,560
What do you mean?

1677
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,980
I've seen all matters changing since I arrived in this game.

1678
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,200
Everything seems quiet here.

1679
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,700
But the passages feel...

1680
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,500
Anything but safe.

1681
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,380
You're right.

1682
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,060
This place is getting more unpredictable by the day.

1683
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:29,500
But cheer up!

1684
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,040
We've thought of everything.

1685
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,340
And we'll take the shortest...

1686
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,960
And the most well trodden path.

1687
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:38,900
I certainly hope all things go well.

1688
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,780
But what lives in these passages?

1689
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:41,160
Glitches.

1690
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,160
Glitches, bugs, and...

1691
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,140
Not the anomalies!

1692
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:48,880
No!

1693
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,340
Are there hostile mitas?

1694
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,840
There's more than...

1695
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,100
Glitch mita!

1696
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,600
Holy shit!

1697
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,420
Oh my god.

1698
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,200
Kaz is so...

1699
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:12,400
Whoa!

1700
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:14,620
Bro!

1701
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:16,940
Damn!

1702
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,740
She's closest to...

1703
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,720
Oh my...

1704
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,040
Girls are mean!

1705
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,580
This is one of my favorite like...

1706
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:32,680
Stat of economy bit.

1707
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:33,820
Where it's like...

1708
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,540
Yeah, a guy.

1709
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,200
He'll physically hurt you.

1710
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,420
But a woman.

1711
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:39,920
He'll find the one thing you know.

1712
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,340
That will cause you the most grief.

1713
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,540
Mentally.

1714
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,900
And she will hurt you in your soul.

1715
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,760
Oh my god.

1716
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,040
Oh my god.

1717
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:01,860
Bro!

1718
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,720
We could have called her anything else.

1719
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,020
What the fuck did we call her?

1720
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,340
Ugly mita.

1721
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,220
By the way, do I have an actual plan?

1722
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,360
You did make here, didn't you?

1723
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,020
Besides...

1724
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:19,300
What else can you do?

1725
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,340
But rely on me, kind mita.

1726
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:26,180
Of course you called yourself kind mita.

1727
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,880
Of course.

1728
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:31,860
I'm saying...

1729
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,400
Unlike some...

1730
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,620
I'm starting to trust her less and less, guys.

1731
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,480
I'm the kindest person you'll find around here.

1732
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,160
You don't want to give up, do you?

1733
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,100
She's a cold-blooded killer.

1734
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,140
Guys, I don't...

1735
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,540
Guys, I think this is ugly mita.

1736
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:53,180
I don't think this is the one we just talked to.

1737
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,720
Guys, she's not like the other mita.

1738
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,660
She's not like them.

1739
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,320
But...

1740
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:03,540
Indeed, we need to reach the core.

1741
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,140
My intuition tells me that's where we'll find...

1742
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,360
A solution to all our problems.

1743
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,040
But why not go there yourself?

1744
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,040
Why do you need a player?

1745
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,540
For some reason, you mitas cannot enter the core room.

1746
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,560
I've only seen it from the outside.

1747
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,840
But you players are different.

1748
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,020
I'm sure that you...

1749
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,980
Can head inside.

1750
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:29,940
Okay.

1751
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,660
Great, right.

1752
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,800
It's high time I introduce you...

1753
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,840
To Cool Mita!

1754
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,080
Now you know she's got a...

1755
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:41,780
Cool Cap.

1756
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,720
I just call her Cappy.

1757
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,620
The plan has been stopped.

1758
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,880
Now she's crazy mita?

1759
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,700
Okay, like...

1760
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:56,540
Is she ugly mita or crazy mita?

1761
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:04,920
Like, Crazy Mita sounds like a better name than- Honestly, like, I don't know why we never first called her, like...

1762
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,180
Crazy Mita.

1763
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,700
I don't know why we pulled up the fucking ugly Mita.

1764
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,300
So, is she crazy or is she ugly?

1765
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,600
Like, make up your fucking mind.

1766
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,040
Which one is it?

1767
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,060
Man, I love Mita.

1768
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,400
Alright, there's cool Mita.

1769
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,520
You're my new player?

1770
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,460
What do I call you?

1771
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,500
Just check the names.

1772
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:36,980
You...

1773
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,340
Don't remember me?

1774
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,320
Who the hell are you?

1775
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:45,900
Not Doki123.

1776
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,460
I think she was here.

1777
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,640
Crazy...Mita, listen up.

1778
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,860
Try to remember for all our sakes.

1779
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,000
Remember what?

1780
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,460
Just think, why do we look alike?

1781
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,780
This doesn't seem to be helping.

1782
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,720
Listen, Not Doki123.

1783
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,800
Things aren't exactly going according to plan.

1784
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,000
We were supposed to use the portal.

1785
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:21,040
To make our journey a million times easier and faster.

1786
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,840
But we can't get it to work without Cappy's help.

1787
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,840
Oh my gosh, she got patched.

1788
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:32,660
She may be fussy, but her mind works quickly.

1789
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,380
Crazy and ugly are different Mitas?

1790
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,520
Bro...

1791
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,860
But they're both crazy.

1792
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,220
What did crazy Mita do to her?

1793
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,640
I think...

1794
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,460
She killed her?

1795
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,380
Killed her?

1796
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,380
And having died...

1797
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,840
Cool Mita will simply reboot.

1798
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:02,120
Get restricted to factory settings and forget everything important.

1799
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,380
Our plan won't work, which means...

1800
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:07,940
Now that's...

1801
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:10,260
I like how Cappy's just sitting there like...

1802
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:10,500
Huh?

1803
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,440
Better than disappearing forever, I guess.

1804
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,200
But who can tell for sure?

1805
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,040
And what about us players?

1806
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,920
Will killing us reset our memories too?

1807
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,180
Your memories can be reset for sure, at least after you've been turned into a cartridge.

1808
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,220
But not even I know.

1809
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,800
What happens to those of you who are killed?

1810
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,380
Oh, we just reset.

1811
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,140
We just restart.

1812
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,020
If I'm a cartridge or not.

1813
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,300
Come here, I'll check.

1814
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:41,960
You over.

1815
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,040
She's chill Mita now.

1816
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,200
What if I just leave?

1817
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,840
What if I just leave?

1818
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:02,910
You're not a cartridge!

1819
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:04,950
Okay, I hope I'm not.

1820
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,950
You're a living, breathing player.

1821
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:08,750
That's good news.

1822
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:12,550
So what do we do now?

1823
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:13,690
Let me think.

1824
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:16,210
We've got to change our entire plan.

1825
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:19,210
Oh my gosh, she held my hand, guys.

1826
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:20,610
We're practically married.

1827
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:22,370
I got an idea.

1828
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:24,390
Give me the ring?

1829
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:25,890
Wait, but we just got married.

1830
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:26,670
What do you mean?

1831
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:33,350
I need to change the route.

1832
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:35,810
Got a route in mind?

1833
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:41,250
Cross through other versions?

1834
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,530
To reach the core.

1835
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,970
Full steam ahead, you hear me?

1836
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,870
And I have to go alone?

1837
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:53,990
But I don't know the way or even how to get there.

1838
01:35:58,410 --> 01:35:59,870
She'll help me, guys?

1839
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:03,370
I'll give you directions and I'll do my best.

1840
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:06,270
And then we'll talk.

1841
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:08,090
First, play with Cappy for a bit.

1842
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:10,290
Alright.

1843
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:22,270
Yeah, you're Cappy.

1844
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:23,090
You're Mita.

1845
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:24,410
You're cool Mita.

1846
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,810
You know what I mean, don't you?

1847
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,810
Oh my gosh, she's so much cooler.

1848
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:37,910
Guys, I can't keep up with reading what they're saying.

1849
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:40,190
They're so fast!

1850
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:42,730
That's not a kickass...

1851
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,170
Oh my gosh, she's so fucking cool.

1852
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:47,750
Oh my gosh.

1853
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,790
Yeah, go it!

1854
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:54,670
Oh my god, yeah!

1855
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:55,330
Do it!

1856
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:56,590
She's so cool.

1857
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:00,530
Let's go!

1858
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:04,250
Can we trade?

1859
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,030
Wait, I like this Mita more.

1860
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:07,450
She's so cool.

1861
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:13,460
Welcome.

1862
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,500
Well, you chose that.

1863
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:19,240
You're quite the energetic one.

1864
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,080
Dude, she's so cool.

1865
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,320
Let's go!

1866
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,760
Have some fun!

1867
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:28,740
Yeah!

1868
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,280
What else do we do, cool Mita?

1869
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,460
What else are we gonna do?

1870
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,200
Do you always wear that cap?

1871
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,120
Don't you grow tired of wearing that cap, cool Mita?

1872
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:44,780
And don't those gloves get warm?

1873
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,000
Why not take them off?

1874
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,580
We don't just ask cool Mita to take off her cool factor.

1875
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,880
You're such a joker.

1876
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,280
Or should I take something else?

1877
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:55,780
Woah!

1878
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,180
Woah!

1879
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,280
Let's be serious here.

1880
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,700
What do you think about the ring bearing Mita?

1881
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,000
Is that replica yourself?

1882
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,680
You know the one with the ring?

1883
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,580
Yeah, I was gonna yell at her.

1884
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,640
You know, to surprise her.

1885
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,300
Holy moly, look!

1886
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:19,600
It's a clone of me!

1887
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,180
Though I'm way more fun.

1888
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:26,240
So I'm cool.

1889
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,260
You're so cool.

1890
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,020
Look at that frown.

1891
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,680
I'm right here.

1892
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:37,320
I can hear everything you're saying.

1893
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,460
Do you remember anything, cool Mita?

1894
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:43,180
What's your plan?

1895
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,140
What plan?

1896
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,720
Oh right, you had lost your memories.

1897
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,160
I should remember something.

1898
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,820
I really should remember something.

1899
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,960
Are you teasing me?

1900
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,720
But looking at that expression of yours...

1901
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,560
I can't tell.

1902
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:11,760
Alright.

1903
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:16,900
Oh, you wanna follow me?

1904
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,320
Okay.

1905
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:20,120
You alright, cool Mita?

1906
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:20,440
Alright.

1907
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,320
Oh, we can play Dance Dance!

1908
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:25,840
Wait, maybe I'm feeling a little thirsty.

1909
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:27,980
I want some TV juice right now.

1910
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,620
Oh, I guess I don't want some TV juice right now.

1911
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,480
Okay.

1912
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,960
Cool Mita, your TV's broken.

1913
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:42,020
Way to go, you found a bug.

1914
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,340
That's supposed to start the video.

1915
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:49,860
But instead, it turns the TV on and off.

1916
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,720
Pretty cool, don't you think?

1917
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,800
Oh yeah, yeah, I gotta find the dev for that.

1918
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,220
Alright, let's play Dance Dance!

1919
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,120
Is that a dance floor?

1920
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:03,980
It's so tiny.

1921
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,540
Shall we dance?

1922
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,200
Yeah, cool Mita's a little freaky, guys.

1923
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,680
Not so Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

1924
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:14,640
Thank you.

1925
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,480
Oh, I wanna do Bubble Drink.

1926
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,600
Let's go with this one.

1927
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,440
Yeah, how do you play this one, cool Mita?

1928
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:25,520
Okay, how's it done?

1929
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,760
Whoa, okay, yeah, fuck me, I guess.

1930
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,020
Don't just push me off.

1931
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,120
Oh, it is dance!

1932
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,940
It's like Beat Saber, but for dancing.

1933
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,760
Which is like Dance Dance Revolution.

1934
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,580
Oh my god, this is baby mode.

1935
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,260
Get off, let me play.

1936
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,500
Come on, no, no.

1937
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,460
Come on Mita, I wanna play too, Mita!

1938
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,200
Mita, that's not very cool of you.

1939
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:56,600
Let me play!

1940
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,560
Oh my god, she's hitting everything.

1941
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,720
Oh my god, she's so good.

1942
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:00,640
How am I gonna beat her?

1943
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,060
That's not fair.

1944
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,480
I'm just gonna leave.

1945
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,920
Oh I can't, I have to watch her.

1946
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:14,420
Mita, Mita, please stop!

1947
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,720
I wanna play too!

1948
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:19,360
I picked the song!

1949
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,640
Oh my god, the watcher play.

1950
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:30,560
I'm playing a game to watch somebody play.

1951
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:35,440
Okay.

1952
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,340
You didn't, you never fucked up!

1953
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:39,980
What?

1954
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,700
How am I supposed to win?

1955
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,380
You literally did everything.

1956
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,660
Alright.

1957
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:50,160
She got...

1958
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,000
I already messed up!

1959
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,680
She got the full score!

1960
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,900
I already messed it up, guys.

1961
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:12,800
I already messed it up.

1962
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,460
Oh my god, guys, I can't.

1963
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:17,980
It's so slow.

1964
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:23,930
Guys, it's not...

1965
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:26,110
It's just cause it's slow, so I'm like...

1966
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:27,990
My fingers won't suppress it.

1967
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:38,190
Bump.

1968
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,290
Bump.

1969
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:40,670
Bump.

1970
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:41,950
Bump.

1971
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:43,250
Bump.

1972
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:45,730
Like, I...

1973
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,810
You got...

1974
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,670
You got a hundred percent!

1975
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:54,150
This is not fair.

1976
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,150
This is not fair.

1977
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,910
She literally got a hundred percent.

1978
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:58,650
She can't fucking lose.

1979
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:01,270
It's actually not fair.

1980
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:02,950
She can't lose!

1981
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:04,390
It's not fair!

1982
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:10,430
Like, she got the full score!

1983
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:12,790
She's programmed to win!

1984
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:14,610
No thanks, bro.

1985
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,290
How to win an argument.

1986
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:19,430
Oh my god.

1987
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:21,690
Oh my god.

1988
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:24,170
Kumito has like...

1989
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:25,370
Has eating cup noodles.

1990
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:26,930
I'm not even gonna watch her play, guys.

1991
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:29,050
Who are these other shoes from?

1992
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:31,610
Oh my god, she's so cool.

1993
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,310
Look how cool she is.

1994
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,390
Oh my god, look at her.

1995
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:34,970
She's like...

1996
01:43:34,970 --> 01:43:36,670
She's in our band and everything.

1997
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:38,670
No, it's a trap?

1998
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:40,970
How to tease...

1999
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:42,870
To steal...

2000
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:43,250
What?

2001
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:45,410
How to tease him.

2002
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:46,750
Clever book.

2003
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:49,450
Is she done?

2004
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:55,870
Her score is higher?!

2005
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:02,910
It's...

2006
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:04,270
Okay.

2007
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:07,070
Okay, it's 76 now.

2008
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:09,190
Okay, cool.

2009
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:10,970
It's higher.

2010
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:12,670
Okay, that's fine.

2011
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,410
Okay, I'm focused up now, guys.

2012
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:18,070
I'm not talking.

2013
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:19,450
I'm locked in.

2014
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:32,880
I'm not letting her beat me.

2015
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,560
She might be cool.

2016
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,240
But I'm cooler.

2017
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:53,340
Wait, this is a different song!

2018
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,140
Okay, this song fucking sucks.

2019
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,880
She got perfect too!

2020
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,000
Perfect.

2021
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,000
Great, one last one.

2022
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:19,720
How about a dance?

2023
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:20,880
No, I'm done.

2024
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,800
I'm done.

2025
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:23,600
I'm done.

2026
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,740
We've done enough dancing, Mita.

2027
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,200
We don't win anything out of this.

2028
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:30,840
I'm done.

2029
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,580
Oh, what is this game?

2030
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:39,900
What a nice big button.

2031
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,720
I really want to press it.

2032
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,480
I'm going to press this button.

2033
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,140
Can I?

2034
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,400
And you make it in time.

2035
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,600
Now have a seat.

2036
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:52,280
Oh, is this like whoever presses the button fast enough?

2037
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,440
Everything is about winning, guys.

2038
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,320
Cool Mita versus not cool Toki.

2039
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,920
Airport Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

2040
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:05,960
Thank you, thank you.

2041
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,960
What are you missing, cool Mita?

2042
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:09,960
A duck?

2043
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:10,820
A crowbar?

2044
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:11,800
An axe?

2045
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,300
Okay.

2046
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,080
A gun?

2047
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,800
This is an adult game?

2048
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:29,220
Wait, where is the adult factor?

2049
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,580
Wait, this is an adult game?

2050
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,000
Huh?

2051
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:34,640
Fevers?

2052
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:36,960
Enough already.

2053
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,400
Let's play, okay?

2054
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:43,840
Oh my god, she is freaky freaky.

2055
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:47,380
Uh, no, what game is it?

2056
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,380
See the numbers?

2057
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,620
That's the timer.

2058
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:54,300
When the timer runs out, it'll tell you when to press the button.

2059
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:57,820
If you're too slow, or press it out of turn...

2060
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:01,820
I'll smack you on the head with a hammer.

2061
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,100
Wait, you're gonna hit me?

2062
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:07,120
Daijoubu.

2063
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:07,940
You understand?

2064
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:08,980
Once we start playing.

2065
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:09,280
Okay.

2066
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,740
That's fucking right, bitch.

2067
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,300
My turn.

2068
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:17,720
No, I'm gonna hit.

2069
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:19,440
That's right.

2070
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:26,960
That's what you get for hitting a perfect score in Dance Dance.

2071
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:32,380
That's right, me again.

2072
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,960
Okay, alright.

2073
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,660
There you go.

2074
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:40,280
Lost again.

2075
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,100
You're gonna give her more memory loss.

2076
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:53,100
Oh, that was close.

2077
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,140
That's right!

2078
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,760
Look at these trigger fingers!

2079
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,920
This game ain't too bad.

2080
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:10,780
I like it too, and now you're my nemesis.

2081
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,460
Nice.

2082
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:15,700
Yeah, that's it!

2083
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:16,540
Let's go!

2084
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:18,880
Oh, that was fun.

2085
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,660
I think this one was my favorite game so far.

2086
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:22,880
It tests my reflexes.

2087
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:24,080
Whoa!

2088
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:26,720
That's so many.

2089
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,740
Is this another bug?

2090
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,760
What do you think?

2091
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,220
It's doing amazing things.

2092
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,260
What's that got to do with this?

2093
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,360
Like, cutting up carrots.

2094
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:38,980
And like...

2095
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:40,140
Cutting carrots!

2096
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,080
And like...

2097
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,100
Right, I got it.

2098
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:43,700
Cutting carrots.

2099
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,320
Oh my God, there's a lot of carrots.

2100
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,960
And that's all she wrote!

2101
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,220
Guys, the cool factor is sort of wearing off now.

2102
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:04,420
Guys, I don't think she's as cool as I thought she was.

2103
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,660
Let it be a secret.

2104
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:10,000
What's in there?

2105
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:12,440
A secret is a secret!

2106
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,220
And secrets are meant to be kept.

2107
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:16,700
Uh-huh.

2108
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,220
Why are you riling yourself up?

2109
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,500
Alright, I think I played all the games.

2110
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,620
Oh wait, there's more stuff.

2111
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,780
Were you re-reading all of them, huh?

2112
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,200
Cause you're bored.

2113
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:35,880
I don't like books.

2114
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:37,240
Oh my God, she's just like me.

2115
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:38,060
For real, for real.

2116
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,260
And I like doing things.

2117
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,500
That's one way to look at things.

2118
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:44,660
But without theory...

2119
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:46,760
Boom!

2120
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,940
Movement, motor skills, touch, you know?

2121
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:52,980
Books are just paper.

2122
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,000
I like to be in the moment.

2123
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,560
If only you'd stay here with me.

2124
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:01,040
We could do so much more.

2125
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,000
I'm sure we could.

2126
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:04,360
Who is your player?

2127
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,760
There's some pretty awesome photos, Mito.

2128
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,640
You sure like a good laugh.

2129
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:21,700
Um...

2130
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,860
Showed who exactly?

2131
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:25,540
Really, you're asking me that?

2132
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,660
Who cares?

2133
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:28,380
I bet they're all blind.

2134
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,540
Who's they?

2135
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:33,480
Mito, who's they?

2136
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,500
That's me.

2137
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:39,900
Did you fix it?

2138
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,480
Alright.

2139
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:45,360
Wow, they gave me five gifted chips!

2140
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,420
Thank you, thank you!

2141
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:50,200
That's unfortunate true, Naoki123.

2142
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:51,660
You'll have to go alone for now.

2143
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,420
I need to get to the bottom of what's going on here.

2144
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:56,820
My plan was flawless!

2145
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,780
But we're worse than ever.

2146
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:03,760
I have to figure out what went wrong and where the parts are.

2147
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:04,620
What parts?

2148
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:08,680
Parts!

2149
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,640
Crazy Mito knows about this place.

2150
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,880
And staying here means risking everything.

2151
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,440
Good luck, Naoki123.

2152
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,040
See you soon.

2153
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:21,460
Woah!

2154
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:22,000
Cool Mito!

2155
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:23,100
Okay, hi, cool Mito.

2156
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,360
I just hope I live long enough to meet you again.

2157
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:29,720
Head out through that door to the hall.

2158
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,500
Bye, guys!

2159
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:35,650
Alright.

2160
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:36,890
Oh!

2161
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:41,330
Version 1.3b.

2162
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:42,750
Alright.

2163
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:46,050
I'm in an older version now.

2164
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:51,870
Oh my god, this is some Silent- Oh, this is some Resident Evil fucking PT shit right here.

2165
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:55,510
Oh, the loop.

2166
01:51:57,650 --> 01:51:59,230
Oh, it is!

2167
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:02,310
I fucking knew it!

2168
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:05,190
Oh, now we're in PT, let's go!

2169
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:12,350
Now we're actually in PT, alright.

2170
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,690
How the fuck do you do PT?

2171
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:21,030
Alright, loop number three.

2172
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:22,550
Alright, number three!

2173
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,010
Oh my god, it's funny to assume I actually played PT though.

2174
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:33,790
Give it up for loop number three!

2175
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:37,870
Oh...

2176
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:40,080
Oh...

2177
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:45,370
I don't think the music likes loop number three for...

2178
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:53,370
Oh, I can't leave loop number four again?

2179
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:56,530
Oh...

2180
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:59,070
Ring ring ring?

2181
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:02,550
Oh...

2182
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:05,370
Okay.

2183
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:07,790
Alright.

2184
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:10,880
Can I go to loop number five?

2185
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:13,250
Again?

2186
01:53:13,890 --> 01:53:14,990
Can I leave?

2187
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:17,910
I cannot leave loop number five.

2188
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:22,050
Again?

2189
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:23,450
Again?

2190
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,730
What if I don't wanna go again?

2191
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:34,390
Armed and...

2192
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,770
Danger!

2193
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:36,610
Again!

2194
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:42,830
Oh my god, I know it all returns back to Marble Rivals.

2195
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:47,130
It's the Winter Soldier!

2196
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:48,990
Again!

2197
01:53:49,390 --> 01:53:49,850
Again!

2198
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:52,510
You're different.

2199
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:55,210
I'm not like other players.

2200
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,400
Oh...

2201
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,520
Loop number seven.

2202
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:04,400
Again?

2203
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:05,360
Again?

2204
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,160
I'm different?

2205
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:08,680
Yes?

2206
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,800
Oh, there's PT!

2207
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:14,400
It's me.

2208
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:17,080
Again?

2209
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:22,030
Oh.

2210
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,850
Guys, I...

2211
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:02,450
I can't, oh my god, I need to use the bathroom.

2212
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:36,580
I am freaking, I'm not mentally ready for this, but like...

2213
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:36,850
Okay.

2214
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,720
I'm freaking out.

2215
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:42,460
Alright, okay!

2216
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:46,640
I'm not mentally ready for this, but let's go.

2217
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:50,500
Oh, that's cool.

2218
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:55,850
Oh, that's...

2219
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:56,830
Oh...

2220
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:57,670
Oh, hey.

2221
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:02,110
Is that ugly?

2222
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:04,570
Is that ugly, Bito?

2223
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,070
What's that?

2224
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,950
What's... oh my god.

2225
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:12,330
Ugliest.

2226
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:17,410
I'm stuck.

2227
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:22,310
Okay, I get it now.

2228
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:25,150
I get why she's called ugly, Bito.

2229
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:27,010
No, she wasn't being mean.

2230
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:27,850
I get it now.

2231
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:30,110
I get it now.

2232
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:33,430
I hate this.

2233
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:37,450
I absolutely hate this.

2234
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:45,350
I can't.

2235
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:48,310
I can't, I can't, I can't.

2236
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:53,470
Oh my god.

2237
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:57,930
Oh my god, I can't.

2238
01:57:58,590 --> 01:57:59,550
Oh, I can't.

2239
01:57:59,590 --> 01:58:01,930
This is my normal walking speed.

2240
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:03,950
I can't fucking run.

2241
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:09,030
Oh, come on, ugly Mito.

2242
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:10,970
That ain't cool.

2243
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:13,690
That's not cool.

2244
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:13,850
That's not cool.

2245
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:20,130
What do you want me to do?

2246
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:21,550
Move

2247
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:31,980
forward!

2248
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:40,850
Oh my god, there's a fucking bat.

2249
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,860
Oh my god.

2250
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,400
I can't.

2251
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,520
I can't, I can't.

2252
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,760
I can't, I'm at loop number 12 now.

2253
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,040
Oh my god.

2254
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:10,620
Oh my god, somebody get me out of here.

2255
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:13,560
I thought this was a silly game.

2256
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:14,940
Oh, there's ugly Mito again.

2257
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:15,860
Hey, ugly Mito.

2258
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:17,800
Ow.

2259
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:21,160
Get begun!

2260
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,240
Oh my god.

2261
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,140
I can't begun!

2262
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,360
Begun with you.

2263
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,620
Oh my god, get out of here.

2264
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,100
Get out.

2265
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,940
She's beautiful, come on.

2266
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,220
Now I know why.

2267
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,380
She wasn't being mean.

2268
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:56,900
Fuck yeah.

2269
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,980
I'm at loop 14.

2270
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:03,140
When do I get out?

2271
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:13,810
Oh my god, please.

2272
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:17,790
Wait, what?

2273
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:20,030
Wait, I'm still at loop 14.

2274
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:23,590
Oh, I have to get a cartridge.

2275
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:36,450
Oh, do I have to watch this?

2276
02:00:41,370 --> 02:00:42,030
Do I go?

2277
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:51,930
Is that the clock time right?

2278
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:01,760
Oh, I don't fucking know.

2279
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:08,690
What?

2280
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:19,450
5, 9, 10.

2281
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:20,590
Oh, okay, is that.

2282
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:20,990
Okay.

2283
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:34,730
Here we go.

2284
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,850
That should be correct.

2285
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:39,690
Okay.

2286
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,820
Oh no, it's like here.

2287
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,040
Here we go.

2288
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,720
Wait, it moved.

2289
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:55,920
Wait, it's not that.

2290
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:56,360
Oh!

2291
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:02,500
It was a little girl.

2292
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:04,000
Wait, little girl Mita?

2293
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:06,820
Child Mita?

2294
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,940
Did you put me in here?

2295
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:10,020
Sorry, my voice went really deep.

2296
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:10,780
I won't get out.

2297
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,060
Sorry.

2298
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:18,320
Sorry, my testosterone kicked in because I want to get out of here.

2299
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:23,740
Oh my god.

2300
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:25,360
Who are you?

2301
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:26,800
What's the matter?

2302
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:29,600
Child of rage.

2303
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:32,040
Are you tiny?

2304
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:35,920
Who are you?

2305
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:43,000
Oh my god.

2306
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:43,860
Wait, why do I have to run?

2307
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,280
Wait, why is it teaching me how to run now?

2308
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:49,580
Wait, I don't like how it's teaching me how to run.

2309
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,540
What am I running from?

2310
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,900
What am I running from?

2311
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:59,080
I don't like that I've learned how to run.

2312
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,140
Oh my god.

2313
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:02,920
Just run.

2314
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:06,600
Hello, little girl.

2315
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,660
What's wrong with you?

2316
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,630
Are you ugly, Mita?

2317
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,200
I didn't even look back.

2318
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:23,040
Oh shit, wait, I had to look back.

2319
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,320
Oh, now I can't run anymore.

2320
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:29,740
What loop am I on?

2321
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,600
Loop 16.

2322
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:33,780
Yeah, she's missing her arms.

2323
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,200
Wait.

2324
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:37,740
You don't want to leave, don't you?

2325
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:38,620
Yeah?

2326
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:40,400
How do you get back?

2327
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:45,770
Previous version?

2328
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:47,250
Why leave and go?

2329
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:50,410
Go someplace else.

2330
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:52,950
Why not stay here?

2331
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:57,510
Be my second friend.

2332
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:01,170
You're Mita, aren't you?

2333
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:04,550
You're a player, aren't you?

2334
02:04:04,930 --> 02:04:06,590
What happened to you, Mita?

2335
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:11,730
We can play together if I can find a friend.

2336
02:04:13,550 --> 02:04:15,110
Why are you tired, Mita?

2337
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:17,230
What happened to you?

2338
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:18,950
I'm uncertain.

2339
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:20,350
I actually don't know.

2340
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:23,790
I don't think anything bad has happened.

2341
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:28,210
But everything good seems to be slipping away.

2342
02:04:30,910 --> 02:04:32,950
Well, at least I have a friend.

2343
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:35,450
Oh, I'm so sad.

2344
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:38,870
Why did they leave me?

2345
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:42,110
Was I not...

2346
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:43,470
enough?

2347
02:04:45,370 --> 02:04:47,050
I'm scared.

2348
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:52,010
Become your second friend.

2349
02:04:53,450 --> 02:04:54,290
Friends.

2350
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:57,490
There's so few of them left now.

2351
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:01,150
Only one remains.

2352
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,850
I'm sad, Claire.

2353
02:05:04,290 --> 02:05:06,250
Will you be my friend?

2354
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:11,030
I wasn't even given a choice, but I had to go on.

2355
02:05:11,030 --> 02:05:13,970
My heart aches.

2356
02:05:15,070 --> 02:05:16,610
Is this your clone?

2357
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:18,710
Why can't you come with me?

2358
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:21,130
You've changed.

2359
02:05:22,690 --> 02:05:25,650
Does it have the strength for basic parenting?

2360
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:28,410
She fucking trapped me in a loop.

2361
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:29,710
What do you mean?

2362
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:32,410
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

2363
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:33,530
Thank you, thank you.

2364
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:36,670
I'm not sure what that means.

2365
02:05:37,670 --> 02:05:40,730
It's okay, because I won't hurt her anymore.

2366
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:41,970
Will I?

2367
02:05:44,110 --> 02:05:45,730
Can I leave this place?

2368
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:46,930
Are you really leaving?

2369
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:48,770
You can come with me.

2370
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:50,010
I didn't say no.

2371
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:54,510
This is perhaps just my destiny.

2372
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:57,570
The doors won't help you.

2373
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:04,950
What the fuck?

2374
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:09,580
Okay.

2375
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,840
Come with me.

2376
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:16,440
Don't you want to come with me?

2377
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,300
Okay, loop 17.

2378
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,040
Give it up for loop 17.

2379
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:30,760
Why leave?

2380
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:36,740
Wait, I didn't even tell her to release.

2381
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:38,860
What's this?

2382
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:45,950
Oh, that's your character profile.

2383
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:54,250
Come on, follow me.

2384
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:57,210
Yeah, come on.

2385
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:57,950
Come on.

2386
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,210
Come on, yes.

2387
02:06:59,510 --> 02:07:00,250
Just follow me.

2388
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:01,030
Yep.

2389
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:02,350
It's not that hard.

2390
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:02,690
Alright.

2391
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:04,990
Stay here.

2392
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,890
He does it himself.

2393
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:10,690
I don't even press it.

2394
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:12,450
I'm not hard.

2395
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:14,890
I swear to god, I'm not hard as this.

2396
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,550
He does it himself.

2397
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:20,030
Oh, there she is again.

2398
02:07:20,830 --> 02:07:22,770
Oh, what's going on to your world?

2399
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:25,230
Woah!

2400
02:07:27,730 --> 02:07:28,970
Stay with me.

2401
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:35,050
Why is the world slapping me?

2402
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:43,930
Loop 19.

2403
02:07:44,810 --> 02:07:45,870
Oh, the world is...

2404
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:48,050
It's ugly Mito.

2405
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:48,610
I'm sorry.

2406
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:49,530
I'm not looking back.

2407
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:50,410
I'm not looking back.

2408
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:51,290
It's ugly Mito.

2409
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:53,990
I'm sorry.

2410
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:55,090
I'm so sorry.

2411
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:58,170
Oh my god.

2412
02:07:58,230 --> 02:08:00,890
I will find my way through doors, but I'm trapped.

2413
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,860
How do I get out?

2414
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:10,640
I didn't leave.

2415
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:20,980
How?

2416
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,220
How do I leave?

2417
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,660
How do I leave?

2418
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:31,840
Why do

2419
02:08:35,610 --> 02:08:38,770
you want to go somewhere else?

2420
02:08:40,670 --> 02:08:41,930
He's right here.

2421
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:43,170
He's right here.

2422
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:44,870
He's right here!

2423
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:46,930
Don't look over here!

2424
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,080
Oh my god, is this...

2425
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,180
Oh my god, she's looking at the window.

2426
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:09,230
Oh my god.

2427
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:15,730
I'm so... I'm just like, oh no, it's crazy Mito.

2428
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:19,810
Hey you.

2429
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:22,490
Hey you.

2430
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:23,970
Hey you, listen.

2431
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:27,090
Oh my god, I...

2432
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:28,970
You want to get out?

2433
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:29,810
Yes, I do.

2434
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:32,070
Then help me find the key.

2435
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:36,970
You're tall.

2436
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:41,190
Just like my sister, Chibi Mito.

2437
02:09:41,850 --> 02:09:43,810
Your sister, what about her?

2438
02:09:45,090 --> 02:09:47,230
Don't say you've never met her.

2439
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:50,130
Oh, I met her, I think.

2440
02:09:50,530 --> 02:09:51,670
It's Chibi Mito.

2441
02:09:52,110 --> 02:09:53,330
Are you a fool?

2442
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:56,750
Turns out you are.

2443
02:09:58,670 --> 02:10:02,910
Alright, here you go.

2444
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:06,450
Try don't you check this drawer, if it's not there.

2445
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:08,750
Nothing here.

2446
02:10:09,150 --> 02:10:10,790
Why don't you check over here then?

2447
02:10:11,790 --> 02:10:12,910
Well, nothing here.

2448
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:18,670
Alright, I swear if it's this one, the last one, I swear to fucking god.

2449
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:22,470
Oh my god, shoot, no key here.

2450
02:10:22,530 --> 02:10:24,970
They must have programmed it so it had to be the last one.

2451
02:10:25,010 --> 02:10:28,130
There's no fucking way that I missed every single...

2452
02:10:28,130 --> 02:10:31,290
Oh my god, there's no fucking way I missed every single one.

2453
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:36,660
Oh, where's she going?

2454
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:42,040
Where did my Chibi Mito... Oh my god, gold?

2455
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:46,120
How the fuck put the iron in the pipe?

2456
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:46,580
Okay.

2457
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:48,520
Thank you.

2458
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:53,310
Now get me that wood.

2459
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:54,530
Alright, here's your wood.

2460
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:56,650
Thank you.

2461
02:11:00,430 --> 02:11:02,190
What is she trying to do?

2462
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:04,670
Can I press the button?

2463
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:07,670
Am I gonna be rich?

2464
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:08,590
Am I getting my money?

2465
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:11,090
Some more help, please.

2466
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:11,770
Alright.

2467
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:14,890
Okay, you can do this yourself, Mito.

2468
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:16,450
What?

2469
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:20,650
I did not have to do that for her.

2470
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,430
Wow, that's beautiful.

2471
02:11:25,570 --> 02:11:28,670
Wow, this Chibi Mito knows how to fucking...

2472
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:33,430
Burn iron, I guess.

2473
02:11:36,130 --> 02:11:37,910
What are we supposed to do here?

2474
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:45,870
She's forging.

2475
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:47,630
She knows how to fucking smelt.

2476
02:11:48,610 --> 02:11:51,410
This Chibi Mito is a fucking blacksmith.

2477
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:52,990
Press it!

2478
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:53,410
Come on!

2479
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:56,810
It's... Oh my god, what are you fucking...

2480
02:11:56,810 --> 02:12:00,790
You press one small button and you can't press the other button.

2481
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:01,850
Okay.

2482
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:07,930
Alright, thank you for smelting, I guess.

2483
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:10,030
Why are you helping me?

2484
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:12,270
What makes you so special?

2485
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:14,730
Why not help you anyway?

2486
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:16,110
What?

2487
02:12:16,650 --> 02:12:17,830
So foolish.

2488
02:12:17,950 --> 02:12:18,210
What?

2489
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:20,710
You just appeared out of nowhere.

2490
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:23,550
You're not supposed to be here.

2491
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:25,990
So I'm helping you.

2492
02:12:27,710 --> 02:12:29,050
What are you doing here?

2493
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:30,250
Don't you get it?

2494
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,270
This is a checkpoint.

2495
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:34,410
A test of your wits.

2496
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:36,090
Now come on!

2497
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:39,430
I'm here to guide the hopelessly lost.

2498
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:43,030
Have we met before, silly head?

2499
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:44,710
You're kinda cute, you know?

2500
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:47,550
Asking silly questions like that?

2501
02:12:49,090 --> 02:12:49,730
So...

2502
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:51,790
This is my first time meeting you.

2503
02:12:52,990 --> 02:12:55,990
But listen, if you steal my marvelous look...

2504
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:58,070
I'll make you regret it.

2505
02:12:58,170 --> 02:12:59,730
Okay, you're fucking tiny.

2506
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:01,450
Like, who's gonna steal your look?

2507
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:03,430
I'm Chibi Mito.

2508
02:13:04,350 --> 02:13:04,850
BX!

2509
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:06,610
Tons of lines.

2510
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:07,910
Simplest models.

2511
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:09,290
And...

2512
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:11,510
Best of all, gorgeous hair!

2513
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:17,050
I hope this game doesn't go through the fucking FNAF route of a fanbase.

2514
02:13:17,190 --> 02:13:17,510
Oh no.

2515
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:19,430
I would not wish...

2516
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:24,570
I hope this game doesn't become, like, the mouthwashing fanbase.

2517
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:27,790
I don't know how the fuck that fanbase turned out the way it is.

2518
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:30,190
Like, that game is so fucking dark.

2519
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:34,710
Oh.

2520
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:37,730
Bye bye, silly!

2521
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:46,140
Alright.

2522
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:48,500
Have a look around.

2523
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:49,080
Okay.

2524
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:52,040
I'm thirsty for some TV juice, though.

2525
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:57,930
Okay, I guess I'll go here.

2526
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:01,790
Cry Mito?

2527
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:11,970
What?

2528
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:36,840
I don't like this.

2529
02:15:00,730 --> 02:15:02,630
Oh my god.

2530
02:15:03,010 --> 02:15:04,090
Oh my god.

2531
02:15:04,650 --> 02:15:06,890
Oh my god.

2532
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:07,150
Oh my god, I...

2533
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:09,210
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

2534
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:10,850
Oh my god.

2535
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:12,610
Oh my god.

2536
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:14,850
Oh my god.

2537
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:18,910
I'm tired.

2538
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:27,350
Don't be tardy.

2539
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:31,830
Where?

2540
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,800
Where do I go?

2541
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:39,040
My head's so freaked out!

2542
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,760
Oh my god, hey, cool.

2543
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,020
Hey, there's cooler Mito.

2544
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:52,100
Wait, there's two cool Mitos?

2545
02:15:55,160 --> 02:15:56,940
Oh my god, there it is.

2546
02:15:57,700 --> 02:15:59,120
Oh my god.

2547
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,080
Oh my god.

2548
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:02,440
I was so quiet there because I was actually so fucking scared.

2549
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,660
There were way too many Mitos.

2550
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:08,300
Please remove these bosses and get the sofa over here.

2551
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,980
I was actually...

2552
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:13,260
I...

2553
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,200
I was actually... I was so freaked out.

2554
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:17,780
That...

2555
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:21,620
That actually freaked me the fuck out.

2556
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:23,780
So what am I doing here?

2557
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:28,240
I need to go to your... get to your screen now.

2558
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:29,500
What?

2559
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:31,900
So...

2560
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:34,600
You need to ensure this prototype is the right one.

2561
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:36,400
First, scan it.

2562
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,960
Version 1.04.

2563
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:44,040
Now check this version.

2564
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:44,640
Alright.

2565
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:48,700
Take this prototype and compare it to the standard version.

2566
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:54,680
How do I take it?

2567
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:58,660
How do I take this?

2568
02:16:58,860 --> 02:17:01,000
How do I... How do I... How do I...

2569
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:01,380
Oh!

2570
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,280
Oh, I have to move my mouse!

2571
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,660
Oh my god!

2572
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,460
Okay, alright.

2573
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:07,160
Alright.

2574
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:09,800
I have to drag it.

2575
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:10,920
It's perfect.

2576
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:12,320
Now let's check the emotions.

2577
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:13,720
Alright.

2578
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:16,800
Okay, we're checking it.

2579
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,340
So it's time to test the behavior.

2580
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:21,320
Alright, put your hands up.

2581
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:22,720
Now turn around.

2582
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:23,800
Oh my god!

2583
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:24,840
Oh my god!

2584
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:27,540
That's right, work it girl!

2585
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:28,820
Work it!

2586
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:30,220
Oh my god!

2587
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:31,580
That was beautiful.

2588
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:33,700
Beautiful Mito.

2589
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:35,460
Great work.

2590
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:36,880
Now that's skin on.

2591
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:38,520
Pass her the box of clothes.

2592
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:39,680
Alright Mito.

2593
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:41,540
Wear these.

2594
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:43,160
Good job.

2595
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:45,080
Oh my god, look at her polygons.

2596
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,400
It's so... You can tell that it's like the first...

2597
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:48,840
The first version.

2598
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:51,060
Your turn.

2599
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,080
I'll be back when all the lights turn green.

2600
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:53,720
Good luck!

2601
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:55,080
Alright, scanning.

2602
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:57,240
1.07.

2603
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:01,500
Requirements version 1... Okay.

2604
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:02,520
Alright.

2605
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:06,260
Let's put this in.

2606
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:07,880
There we go.

2607
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:09,260
Alright Mito.

2608
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:11,940
Now give me... Show me those emotions.

2609
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:12,940
That's right.

2610
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,280
Now up you go.

2611
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:15,480
Turn around.

2612
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:16,020
Woo!

2613
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:18,100
And touch your toes.

2614
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:21,220
That was a bad version.

2615
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:22,520
Alright.

2616
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:24,360
Scanning.

2617
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:26,660
Oh there you go.

2618
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:28,580
That was the Mito we wanted.

2619
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,700
Don't worry about this Mito.

2620
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:31,600
We don't need her.

2621
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:32,580
Alright.

2622
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:37,450
Wait.

2623
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:39,210
Alright.

2624
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:40,450
Give me that emo.

2625
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:41,910
Give me that.

2626
02:18:42,490 --> 02:18:43,270
That's good.

2627
02:18:44,210 --> 02:18:44,610
Woah!

2628
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:45,830
Put your hands up.

2629
02:18:46,470 --> 02:18:46,710
Woo!

2630
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:48,410
Turn around for me Mito.

2631
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:49,530
That's right.

2632
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:51,170
And then...

2633
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:51,490
Woo!

2634
02:18:53,030 --> 02:18:54,250
Great work.

2635
02:18:54,830 --> 02:18:56,230
That's the Mito we wanted.

2636
02:18:58,310 --> 02:18:59,330
That's right.

2637
02:18:59,450 --> 02:19:01,210
You're looking great Mito.

2638
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:03,310
Now wear these clothes.

2639
02:19:04,710 --> 02:19:05,790
Wait, it's the right one.

2640
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:06,750
285.

2641
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:09,010
Oh I fucked up.

2642
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:10,050
Oops.

2643
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:17,700
She didn't twirl.

2644
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:18,860
I didn't realize.

2645
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:19,980
I was so absorbed.

2646
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:21,520
I didn't realize she didn't twirl.

2647
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:24,780
Alright.

2648
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:25,700
Give me the heart.

2649
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:26,460
Give me that.

2650
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:27,300
Give me the blush.

2651
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:28,320
Touch your...

2652
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:28,820
Touch up.

2653
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:29,900
Do that turn.

2654
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:31,120
Good job Mito.

2655
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:32,620
And you touch your toes.

2656
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:33,540
Alright.

2657
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:35,920
That's the Mito we wanted.

2658
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:36,280
And then...

2659
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:38,160
Now wear your clothes Mito.

2660
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:44,510
That's a good Mito right there.

2661
02:19:44,770 --> 02:19:46,550
Oh that looks like an evil Mito.

2662
02:19:51,150 --> 02:19:53,630
Guys, I don't...

2663
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:54,090
I can't...

2664
02:19:54,090 --> 02:19:54,850
I can't tell.

2665
02:19:58,350 --> 02:19:59,250
I don't know.

2666
02:19:59,630 --> 02:20:00,090
This...

2667
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:00,990
I don't know.

2668
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:02,630
This Mito...

2669
02:20:03,850 --> 02:20:05,550
Do I just...

2670
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:06,750
Woah.

2671
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:07,750
I don't...

2672
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:09,610
This Mito looks like it has some issues.

2673
02:20:10,410 --> 02:20:11,870
Goodbye Mito.

2674
02:20:13,430 --> 02:20:14,350
I don't know.

2675
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:17,310
That Mito looked like it had some things going on.

2676
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:21,890
It's just her new contacts.

2677
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:25,510
Don't judge her.

2678
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:27,110
It's just her...

2679
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:28,410
Alright.

2680
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:29,310
Get down.

2681
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:30,650
Alright.

2682
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:32,970
We'll find the right Mito eventually.

2683
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:36,630
You did it!

2684
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:42,800
She was a bit quirky.

2685
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:48,340
So get the point of this game?

2686
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:51,780
That I'm made of flesh and bones and you're made of a skeleton model?

2687
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:53,680
Woah.

2688
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:56,340
Sounds creepy when you say it like that.

2689
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:58,260
But that's the gist of it.

2690
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:00,920
Wait, so all you Mitos...

2691
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:01,940
You just...

2692
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:03,100
Mito...

2693
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:06,080
All you Mitos just have like bones underneath.

2694
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:10,060
You run into abandoned models.

2695
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:12,020
The ones given up on.

2696
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:13,260
The faulty ones.

2697
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,880
You're aggressive and may even try to kill you.

2698
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:18,420
So what should I do?

2699
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:23,460
I just go wherever a door opens.

2700
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:27,060
Oh my god, now there's aggressive Mitos?!

2701
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:29,820
I'm sorry, I was just doing what they were telling me to do!

2702
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:32,880
And don't let them out of your sight.

2703
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:35,000
They get shy when you stare at them.

2704
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:36,500
So shy they freeze.

2705
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:38,180
Keep that in mind!

2706
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:43,590
What are you looking here?

2707
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:44,310
Doing here?

2708
02:21:45,150 --> 02:21:45,950
Still don't get it?

2709
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:48,110
I'm helping you Mitos settle in.

2710
02:21:49,410 --> 02:21:51,230
Who would help them if I don't?

2711
02:21:53,010 --> 02:21:53,530
You?

2712
02:21:54,350 --> 02:21:55,950
Why is it so dark down there?

2713
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:58,470
We Mitos are created in the dark.

2714
02:21:58,830 --> 02:22:00,850
So we need to remain there for a while.

2715
02:22:01,130 --> 02:22:02,610
Oh my god, the weak Mitos.

2716
02:22:03,210 --> 02:22:05,510
The pain of moving from darkness straight into the light.

2717
02:22:05,810 --> 02:22:06,250
Imagine.

2718
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:10,310
So why are the other Mitos downstairs?

2719
02:22:12,330 --> 02:22:13,390
They're freshly made.

2720
02:22:13,730 --> 02:22:16,590
They need time to gain self-awareness.

2721
02:22:17,150 --> 02:22:20,350
Then I guide each one to her own home.

2722
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:22,830
What is this conveyor belt for?

2723
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:28,310
Is there enough room for everyone?

2724
02:22:29,710 --> 02:22:32,190
Wait, don't tell me you don't...

2725
02:22:33,430 --> 02:22:34,070
Don't what?

2726
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:36,550
Understand how the world works?

2727
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:38,230
And that it's endless?

2728
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:39,590
Endless?

2729
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:42,730
What do you mean?

2730
02:22:43,050 --> 02:22:44,030
It can't be endless.

2731
02:22:44,710 --> 02:22:45,450
It's a cartridge.

2732
02:22:47,890 --> 02:22:49,810
And there are only 19 worlds.

2733
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:53,970
My gosh, you really don't get how this world works at all.

2734
02:22:54,670 --> 02:22:57,290
How many fucking terabytes are in this world?

2735
02:22:59,170 --> 02:23:00,530
Wanna hear about it?

2736
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:02,270
Okay, yeah, explain it.

2737
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:03,270
Explain...

2738
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:05,310
Explain to me in Marvel Rivals terms.

2739
02:23:06,290 --> 02:23:08,190
I just hope this won't be like high school.

2740
02:23:09,010 --> 02:23:11,130
Where I always fall asleep out of boredom.

2741
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:14,250
We can leave anytime or stay and listen.

2742
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:18,000
Alright.

2743
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:26,020
A player downloads Misade and plays as much as they want.

2744
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:30,260
There he creates a new home and a new Mito.

2745
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:34,280
This is a 2D representation and a new Mito.

2746
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:36,620
There are the versions.

2747
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:39,280
Shown as lines.

2748
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:42,940
The houses are placed on these lines.

2749
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:45,920
Oh my god, this is like a programmer, like, love story.

2750
02:23:47,140 --> 02:23:50,820
So, say you download the 1.14 version, which means a new life.

2751
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:54,380
A new Mito and a new house.

2752
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:58,820
You can ask about the details in this drawing.

2753
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:01,580
And I'll do my best to explain.

2754
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:03,960
Okay, alright.

2755
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:06,160
Why is this one so dark?

2756
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,600
Um, that one here.

2757
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:11,920
Uh, because of pretty Mito.

2758
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:13,100
She drew it.

2759
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:16,740
We were arguing over which one's pretty Mito.

2760
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,640
Who can reach version 1.11 the fastest.

2761
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:21,580
So, who won?

2762
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:23,720
Me, of course.

2763
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:25,480
Look, we're here.

2764
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:28,660
1.115.

2765
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:30,480
House index 809.

2766
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:33,800
We need to reach version 1.11.

2767
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,460
House index 805.

2768
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:39,500
So, her path started like this.

2769
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:42,160
We tried to come up with a shorter route.

2770
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:45,980
So, pretty Mito suggested this path.

2771
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,980
And then, I drew the simplest one here.

2772
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:51,640
Easy, right?

2773
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,000
Just look.

2774
02:24:54,380 --> 02:24:57,000
From here, you can get directly to the correct version.

2775
02:24:57,740 --> 02:25:00,160
While it may seem that this house is in the way.

2776
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:02,120
That it blocks your path.

2777
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:05,700
Anyway, your ring works based on the same principle.

2778
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:08,300
Oh, she just like, walked...

2779
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:10,380
She just like, just walked past it.

2780
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:20,600
You'll need to go through version 1.112.

2781
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,880
You'll definitely encounter sleepy Mito.

2782
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:26,940
Who the fuck is Arina Mito who said she took the same path?

2783
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:29,340
What's wrong with sleepy Mito?

2784
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:30,280
Is she just sleepy?

2785
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:34,500
Perhaps she's a genius.

2786
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:38,060
And has come up with an even shorter route.

2787
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:41,820
I think I might get it.

2788
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:43,420
I understand now.

2789
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:45,280
Why is there a Christmas tree?

2790
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:46,960
Is that just a drawing?

2791
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:48,240
Or...

2792
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:49,120
Does it mean something?

2793
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:51,040
Yeah!

2794
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:52,840
It's just a doodle.

2795
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:53,700
Oh, okay.

2796
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:54,260
Thank God.

2797
02:25:57,140 --> 02:25:58,180
Wait, what's this?

2798
02:25:58,960 --> 02:25:59,720
What's this about?

2799
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,000
That's for cool Mito.

2800
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:04,120
She'll be here in a few hours.

2801
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:07,080
She'll move these boxes and places.

2802
02:26:07,380 --> 02:26:08,040
So funny!

2803
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:12,310
She's so cool.

2804
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:17,660
No, that's cool Mito's job.

2805
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:20,740
She's just here to move furniture.

2806
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:21,840
Okay.

2807
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:23,660
Why is there a single circle?

2808
02:26:24,980 --> 02:26:27,080
That version was released just once.

2809
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:29,340
Never to be repeated.

2810
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:31,460
What's wrong with that?

2811
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:34,020
It's the only genuinely unique version.

2812
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:36,320
Plus, these versions are special.

2813
02:26:36,900 --> 02:26:38,760
And don't have any paths to other versions.

2814
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:42,760
Sleepy Mito resides in this version 1.1.

2815
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:45,920
That's why she's so cool.

2816
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:48,020
She has couch guys.

2817
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:55,800
But it's impossible to wake her up.

2818
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:56,940
Oh no.

2819
02:26:57,680 --> 02:26:59,020
She's in sleep mode.

2820
02:26:59,380 --> 02:27:01,920
Her player never played the game again.

2821
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:03,640
Wait.

2822
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,160
Didn't I meet you in the latest version?

2823
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,660
Or perhaps it's just my imagination.

2824
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:12,820
Well, it's quite possible.

2825
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:15,180
I'm from version 1.5.

2826
02:27:17,060 --> 02:27:18,000
I have.

2827
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:19,860
That's where I arrived.

2828
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:22,860
But I was thrown into this world.

2829
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:25,020
Wow!

2830
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:26,320
But how?

2831
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:29,920
But what is the house index for you in?

2832
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,940
There is a me who just can't stop whining.

2833
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,840
And a me who loves horsing around.

2834
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:37,140
And a me with bad memory who likes bullying others.

2835
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:38,720
It's a long list.

2836
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:45,500
The director was writing.

2837
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:47,770
Like...

2838
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:49,720
Play with me.

2839
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:53,240
Oh, what a bummer.

2840
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:56,640
That's the me who bullies and forgets things.

2841
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:03,700
I haven't known any...

2842
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:06,140
That's too real.

2843
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:12,620
That's too real.

2844
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:16,460
Fuck, okay.

2845
02:28:24,570 --> 02:28:26,690
Oh my god, it's the weeping meekers.

2846
02:28:27,510 --> 02:28:29,530
Fucking damn it.

2847
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:58,280
What do I do?

2848
02:29:19,310 --> 02:29:20,970
I hate this game.

2849
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:22,190
I hate this game.

2850
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:25,870
Oh my god.

2851
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:37,010
I hate this.

2852
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:42,710
Why can't you come downstairs with me?

2853
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:45,030
I hate the fucking brothers.

2854
02:29:45,630 --> 02:29:51,890
I can't deal with the weeping

2855
02:29:56,230 --> 02:29:56,790
meekers.

2856
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:59,350
The weeping meekers, I can't.

2857
02:30:00,210 --> 02:30:01,610
Oh my god.

2858
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:04,550
The fucking weeping.

2859
02:30:04,890 --> 02:30:06,190
Oh my god.

2860
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:16,040
Oh my...

2861
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:25,770
Oh my god.

2862
02:30:26,130 --> 02:30:28,570
Oh my god.

2863
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:32,670
This flashlight is so useless.

2864
02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:36,570
This flashlight is so useless.

2865
02:30:40,770 --> 02:30:42,870
Oh, they're not aggressive yet?

2866
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:45,650
Oh, thank fucking god.

2867
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:49,030
Oh my god, I hate this.

2868
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:50,910
I actually hate this.

2869
02:30:53,790 --> 02:30:57,110
Oh my god, thank you for telling me that they're not aggressive yet.

2870
02:30:57,150 --> 02:30:58,690
I feel like we would never leave.

2871
02:30:59,930 --> 02:31:01,130
I can't.

2872
02:31:01,710 --> 02:31:03,550
I legitimately, I cannot.

2873
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:05,930
They like block every door.

2874
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:08,270
I can't go anywhere.

2875
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:15,170
Oh my god.

2876
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:20,370
Like, where am I?

2877
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:23,790
Hello?

2878
02:31:24,610 --> 02:31:25,850
Oh shit!

2879
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:30,190
Okay.

2880
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:33,920
Oh, thanks.

2881
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:36,360
Oh my god, it's them.

2882
02:32:01,610 --> 02:32:03,370
I'll just die to it.

2883
02:32:03,410 --> 02:32:04,830
What happens if I just die?

2884
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:12,000
Just kill me.

2885
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:36,290
Okay.

2886
02:32:36,730 --> 02:32:37,290
Woah.

2887
02:32:38,210 --> 02:32:38,770
Woah.

2888
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:42,890
Only wanted a little taste.

2889
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:56,500
Wait, what happens if it kills me?

2890
02:33:00,260 --> 02:33:03,840
Okay, I just needed to know what the jump scare is like, okay?

2891
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:10,540
Okay.

2892
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:29,100
Fuck!

2893
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:30,000
Okay.

2894
02:33:38,270 --> 02:33:40,750
I fucking hate this so much.

2895
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:32,060
What the- Holy fuck!

2896
02:34:32,620 --> 02:34:35,580
Oh my fucking god!

2897
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,720
You're fucking- Holy shit!

2898
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:39,880
I'm fucking

2899
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:57,140
- Oh, they're so friendly.

2900
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:58,920
They're

2901
02:35:04,610 --> 02:35:05,270
so friendly.

2902
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:08,090
They're so- There's so many.

2903
02:35:08,550 --> 02:35:10,170
There's so many of them.

2904
02:35:10,570 --> 02:35:12,910
There's so- There's so many.

2905
02:35:13,410 --> 02:35:16,030
Holy- Holy fuck.

2906
02:35:20,530 --> 02:35:21,390
Get off!

2907
02:35:21,650 --> 02:35:22,090
Get off!

2908
02:35:22,370 --> 02:35:22,970
Get off!

2909
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:24,350
Oh my god!

2910
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:34,170
Oh my god, there's- Oh my god!

2911
02:35:37,310 --> 02:35:39,210
I can't fix them.

2912
02:35:39,210 --> 02:35:41,050
Oh, they're damn fix

2913
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:54,040
- Oh my god, that's so- Oh my god, there's so many of these.

2914
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:57,440
I should keep- I was just doing my job!

2915
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:00,040
I was just doing my job!

2916
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:04,520
I didn't mean to throw you guys down the chute.

2917
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:11,160
There was no fixing those meat- Oh, there was absolutely no fixing.

2918
02:36:15,140 --> 02:36:16,360
Oh my god.

2919
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:19,380
Oh my god, this stupid puzzle.

2920
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:25,760
I got a little confused there, but I'm okay now.

2921
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:27,700
I'm okay now.

2922
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:33,800
Sorry, my fucking- I'm still trying to process what- I'm still trying to process what I just played.

2923
02:36:34,380 --> 02:36:36,160
Burrito, thank you for the super chat.

2924
02:36:36,260 --> 02:36:36,960
Thank you, thank you.

2925
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:38,280
Don't blink.

2926
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:44,620
I was legitimately just trying to process exactly what the fuck just happened.

2927
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:48,060
Oh my god.

2928
02:36:48,740 --> 02:36:50,920
That shit fucked me up, not gonna lie.

2929
02:36:51,620 --> 02:36:53,000
Wait, did I not press the lever?

2930
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:54,580
I didn't press the lever yet.

2931
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,140
What do you mean that was the second to worst one?

2932
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:05,200
There's something more worse than what I just went through?

2933
02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:08,840
What I just- The fucking- Don't blink!

2934
02:37:11,060 --> 02:37:12,480
Okay, I pulled the lever.

2935
02:37:19,930 --> 02:37:21,790
Why is there a Mito there?

2936
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:27,630
Why is there- Why is there a Mito?

2937
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:32,070
I don't like how there was a Mito there.

2938
02:37:48,040 --> 02:37:49,220
Alright, there we go.

2939
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:52,760
No.

2940
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:56,040
No.

2941
02:38:00,060 --> 02:38:01,080
Oh, that works.

2942
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:01,420
Okay.

2943
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:04,360
Wait, no.

2944
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:05,680
Okay.

2945
02:38:12,370 --> 02:38:13,830
No, that doesn't work.

2946
02:38:15,770 --> 02:38:17,790
God, it looks like I'm fucking infected.

2947
02:38:19,270 --> 02:38:21,790
I'm literally infected right now.

2948
02:38:22,890 --> 02:38:26,290
Okay, if I do- No.

2949
02:38:32,170 --> 02:38:36,850
Wait, but what do I- Okay.

2950
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:39,850
Do, do.

2951
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:41,450
Do, do.

2952
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:42,250
Do.

2953
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:43,370
Do.

2954
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:43,930
Okay, no.

2955
02:38:44,910 --> 02:38:45,390
Do.

2956
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:46,150
Okay.

2957
02:38:46,910 --> 02:38:47,690
Do, do.

2958
02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:49,030
Do, do.

2959
02:38:49,450 --> 02:38:49,930
Do.

2960
02:38:53,010 --> 02:38:54,170
Do, do.

2961
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:55,030
Do, do.

2962
02:38:55,170 --> 02:38:55,670
There we go.

2963
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:58,110
Alright.

2964
02:38:59,150 --> 02:39:01,670
I don't like how you guys were telling me that it gets worse.

2965
02:39:01,790 --> 02:39:04,110
Like, that actually- That's gonna fuck me up, guys.

2966
02:39:04,250 --> 02:39:06,470
Like- Guys.

2967
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:09,110
Guys, I don't like that.

2968
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:11,510
I thought that was the worst one.

2969
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:16,000
I'm not a fan.

2970
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:17,900
That doesn't make me feel joy.

2971
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:19,000
Oops.

2972
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:20,040
Sorry.

2973
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:22,100
Almost killed you there.

2974
02:39:23,820 --> 02:39:24,820
Oh, that's alright.

2975
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:26,500
That's just a little clumsy.

2976
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:29,120
The fridge- I mean, the fridge almost killed you.

2977
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:30,520
I had nothing to do with it.

2978
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:31,460
I swear.

2979
02:39:34,140 --> 02:39:35,660
Sure, I believe you.

2980
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,940
But seriously, this place is dangerous.

2981
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:40,680
Here, take this.

2982
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:41,960
Especially for you.

2983
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:44,320
For me?

2984
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:45,820
Why?

2985
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,280
Why?

2986
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,280
Because I'm made of flesh?

2987
02:39:52,570 --> 02:39:53,670
What's this?

2988
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:59,280
Praying for you, oh great Mita.

2989
02:40:03,610 --> 02:40:05,790
Trump the discord?!

2990
02:40:06,390 --> 02:40:07,210
Wait!

2991
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:18,620
Wait, does it actually- Wait, other people are playing this right now!

2992
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:19,820
Wait!

2993
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:22,850
Oh my god!

2994
02:40:22,950 --> 02:40:23,330
Please!

2995
02:40:25,730 --> 02:40:29,830
Does this actually make me join discord?

2996
02:40:30,730 --> 02:40:33,830
Praying for you, great Mita.

2997
02:40:34,930 --> 02:40:39,310
Does it actually- Oh my god, look at all these other players!

2998
02:40:40,290 --> 02:40:41,970
Wait, that's so funny!

2999
02:40:42,130 --> 02:40:43,290
That's so cool!

3000
02:40:46,630 --> 02:40:48,190
What else is praying for you?

3001
02:40:50,410 --> 02:40:52,210
Praying for you, great Mita.

3002
02:40:53,090 --> 02:40:54,950
Praying for you, oh great Mita.

3003
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:56,510
Pop it.

3004
02:40:57,370 --> 02:40:59,230
Oh my god, oh god.

3005
02:40:59,990 --> 02:41:01,750
Some of these names.

3006
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:07,050
Oh my god, I don't think- I think some of these names are- Wait, Jubyphonic!

3007
02:41:07,590 --> 02:41:08,810
Oh my god!

3008
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:11,490
Jubyphonic's in here!

3009
02:41:12,890 --> 02:41:13,870
That's cute.

3010
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:15,330
That's funny.

3011
02:41:16,430 --> 02:41:19,330
Praying for you, oh great Mita.

3012
02:41:21,410 --> 02:41:22,850
Oh my god.

3013
02:41:23,630 --> 02:41:27,470
So does it like- So like, does it actually send you to their discord?

3014
02:41:28,950 --> 02:41:30,130
Woah, okay.

3015
02:41:33,570 --> 02:41:37,330
If I click it, does it actually- Oh okay, I was gonna say.

3016
02:41:40,820 --> 02:41:41,700
Oh hey there.

3017
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:44,700
Are you a good Mita?

3018
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:53,300
I like that sound that it made.

3019
02:41:54,280 --> 02:41:55,300
I like that.

3020
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:57,060
That doesn't give me joy.

3021
02:41:57,980 --> 02:42:00,020
Oh, I can zoom in for dialogue?

3022
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:01,860
Okay, I couldn't tell.

3023
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:08,600
Can I actually?

3024
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:11,900
It wouldn't let me earlier.

3025
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,260
Oh, there we go.

3026
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:19,430
Oh.

3027
02:42:21,230 --> 02:42:21,790
Hello?

3028
02:42:22,290 --> 02:42:23,590
I wanna talk to you.

3029
02:42:24,570 --> 02:42:25,530
Can I talk to you?

3030
02:42:27,630 --> 02:42:29,730
What are you- Oh, I'm sorry!

3031
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:31,230
I'm- Please.

3032
02:42:31,230 --> 02:42:32,690
Don't look, please.

3033
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:35,730
I just- I was trying to talk to you.

3034
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:36,650
I'm so sorry.

3035
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:39,230
I was trying to talk to you.

3036
02:42:41,170 --> 02:42:43,290
Why was there a zoom in?

3037
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:49,020
Hello?

3038
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:52,520
I don't think she wants to talk to me anymore.

3039
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:53,620
Guys.

3040
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:58,380
I was just trying to- She doesn't want to talk to me.

3041
02:42:58,520 --> 02:42:59,300
I don't understand.

3042
02:43:04,540 --> 02:43:06,200
Did I get one gun?

3043
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,800
You made me a pervert!

3044
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:09,100
Guys!

3045
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:13,960
I just wanted to- I thought- I thought I could talk to her.

3046
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:19,100
I didn't realize you kept- I didn't realize I was just trying to talk to her.

3047
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:21,340
I swear, please don't call the cops.

3048
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:26,040
The chat in my head- The voices in my head said that she would talk to me.

3049
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:27,500
Please, officer.

3050
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:30,740
The voices in my head told me to do it.

3051
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:31,320
I don't understand.

3052
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:32,180
I swear.

3053
02:43:32,620 --> 02:43:33,740
I swear.

3054
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:36,460
Oh, this is the white light from outside!

3055
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:40,260
That's what the white light is.

3056
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:44,160
Whatever you say, Doki.

3057
02:43:47,670 --> 02:43:51,350
Top- Thank you for the super chat.

3058
02:43:51,470 --> 02:43:54,070
Thank you, thank you.

3059
02:43:55,610 --> 02:43:55,990
Alright.

3060
02:43:57,530 --> 02:43:58,290
Whoa!

3061
02:43:59,250 --> 02:44:00,110
Hello, chair.

3062
02:44:00,110 --> 02:44:02,930
Is the volume in great- Okay, so far.

3063
02:44:03,010 --> 02:44:04,010
I know I should've asked this earlier.

3064
02:44:04,130 --> 02:44:05,570
It's like 2 hours and 40 minutes deep.

3065
02:44:05,890 --> 02:44:07,190
But like, just wanted to be sure.

3066
02:44:07,350 --> 02:44:08,230
Just wanted to double check.

3067
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:11,410
Oh, I'm in the fucking- I'm megamanning it right now.

3068
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:21,910
What are you doing here?

3069
02:44:22,250 --> 02:44:22,810
Who's there?

3070
02:44:26,230 --> 02:44:27,030
I'm Miitaphone.

3071
02:44:27,230 --> 02:44:29,170
I'm sitting here controlling the cable cars.

3072
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:30,890
Do you realize?

3073
02:44:32,330 --> 02:44:33,970
You're heading to your doom right now.

3074
02:44:34,050 --> 02:44:34,530
Wait, what?

3075
02:44:35,290 --> 02:44:37,730
Press, but it's the only path I have.

3076
02:44:38,790 --> 02:44:39,670
You know what?

3077
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:40,110
Wood.

3078
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:45,910
Press the button and get behind the camera.

3079
02:44:48,990 --> 02:44:49,930
Yeah, I can't.

3080
02:44:51,070 --> 02:44:52,170
Wait, is she being Miita?

3081
02:44:54,570 --> 02:44:55,970
There's a tiny Miita?

3082
02:44:57,450 --> 02:44:59,510
Oh my god, there she is!

3083
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:03,330
What are you doing here, little Miita?

3084
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:05,070
Hey there.

3085
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:15,170
What are you doing here?

3086
02:45:18,730 --> 02:45:19,210
Yeah?

3087
02:45:23,090 --> 02:45:23,730
You're in my way?

3088
02:45:23,770 --> 02:45:24,590
Oh, sorry there.

3089
02:45:29,350 --> 02:45:30,710
Why are you following me?

3090
02:45:31,730 --> 02:45:33,690
The voices in my head told me to.

3091
02:45:34,510 --> 02:45:35,890
Oh, you shall not pass.

3092
02:45:36,450 --> 02:45:37,950
Wait, but she's so much faster.

3093
02:45:39,270 --> 02:45:40,650
How is this fair?

3094
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:47,780
Wait, where did she go?

3095
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:51,180
Wait, she blocked the way.

3096
02:45:53,460 --> 02:45:54,560
Oh my god, I lost.

3097
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:56,660
What do you mean I lost the fucking race?

3098
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:59,220
All I could do is briskly walk.

3099
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:00,980
If I could, I would run.

3100
02:46:01,060 --> 02:46:02,420
My legs don't work like that.

3101
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:03,820
Like, whoa.

3102
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:07,560
Alright, we got some more bugs going in here.

3103
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:17,020
Alright, well apparently you guys wanted me to- I can make it a little louder.

3104
02:46:19,400 --> 02:46:20,640
I just hope it's not too loud.

3105
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,920
That's what I was worried about.

3106
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:24,440
Oh my god.

3107
02:46:25,140 --> 02:46:26,160
Alright, here we go.

3108
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:28,120
Let's go, Miita phone.

3109
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:32,080
Press the button.

3110
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,070
Alright.

3111
02:46:44,690 --> 02:46:45,490
Alright, cool.

3112
02:46:47,490 --> 02:46:48,710
The fuck is that?

3113
02:46:48,770 --> 02:46:49,630
Are those glitches?

3114
02:46:54,630 --> 02:46:56,070
What the heck is that?

3115
02:46:56,790 --> 02:46:58,390
Now I'm fucking playing a shooter.

3116
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:03,900
Playing like a real shooter.

3117
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:10,940
Alright.

3118
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:13,060
Oh my god, this game has everything.

3119
02:47:14,900 --> 02:47:16,480
I really like this game so far.

3120
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:19,760
Other than the fucking weeping Miitas, this game's been pretty solid.

3121
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:21,640
No, actually, no.

3122
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:22,840
I take it all back.

3123
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:24,420
The beginning part fucking sucked.

3124
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:25,620
I thought it was a silly game.

3125
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:32,980
I thought it was a silly game.

3126
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:35,280
I mentally was not ready for it.

3127
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:40,080
I literally just got off Marvel Rivals ready to play a silly anime game.

3128
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:42,560
And then I went straight into this.

3129
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:45,440
I got set up every time.

3130
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:48,060
I get set up every fucking time.

3131
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:56,940
Yay, we made it, Miita phone.

3132
02:47:57,240 --> 02:47:58,040
We made it.

3133
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:01,360
Yippee.

3134
02:48:01,460 --> 02:48:03,160
Oh my god, from one...

3135
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:04,500
Bye, Miita phone.

3136
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:07,160
No matter right how much...

3137
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:09,660
Oh my god, from one game to the next.

3138
02:48:09,740 --> 02:48:11,180
Let's fucking go.

3139
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:17,140
Oh my god, is this Doom?

3140
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:19,880
Today, we must punish the devils.

3141
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:20,640
You're up, Miita.

3142
02:48:20,820 --> 02:48:22,820
Give them a severe whipping, but be careful.

3143
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:24,540
They'll fight back.

3144
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:27,140
Is my sound guy still here?

3145
02:48:27,340 --> 02:48:29,020
What do you think about the volume so far?

3146
02:48:29,360 --> 02:48:30,000
Sound guy.

3147
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,720
Oh my god, is this Doom?

3148
02:48:32,820 --> 02:48:34,180
Oh my god, it is!

3149
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:35,580
Wait, it's Doom!

3150
02:48:42,510 --> 02:48:43,010
Alright.

3151
02:48:46,810 --> 02:48:48,380
Just gonna stand here, like...

3152
02:48:49,230 --> 02:48:50,570
Are they unlimited or is there...

3153
02:48:50,570 --> 02:48:51,370
Oh shit!

3154
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:53,050
Nevermind.

3155
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:58,370
I didn't realize they had projectiles.

3156
02:49:01,070 --> 02:49:02,790
I'm like worried I'll like...

3157
02:49:02,790 --> 02:49:04,230
I'm gonna like accidentally step through.

3158
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:05,490
Wait, what?

3159
02:49:05,630 --> 02:49:06,490
Someone's still alive.

3160
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:08,030
Who's alive?

3161
02:49:11,860 --> 02:49:12,860
Who's alive?

3162
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:14,240
Oh shit!

3163
02:49:16,420 --> 02:49:17,900
Okay, nevermind.

3164
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:18,740
It's just the second wave.

3165
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:25,240
It's just the second wave.

3166
02:49:25,900 --> 02:49:26,500
Nevermind.

3167
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:28,900
Oh shit!

3168
02:49:28,980 --> 02:49:29,200
Okay.

3169
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:30,560
No, fuck you.

3170
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:32,580
I'll get your bubbles out.

3171
02:49:35,340 --> 02:49:38,560
Oh my god, my sensitivity is way too high for a shooter right now.

3172
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:40,340
It's way too high!

3173
02:49:44,750 --> 02:49:46,390
I keep accidentally stepping on lava.

3174
02:49:49,900 --> 02:49:51,740
Okay, we got the heals right here.

3175
02:49:52,980 --> 02:49:53,900
No, I'm okay.

3176
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:54,800
My HP is okay.

3177
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,880
I'm just gonna get rid of him first.

3178
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:01,340
Oh my god, please.

3179
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:02,360
I have to...

3180
02:50:02,360 --> 02:50:02,900
I can't...

3181
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:03,660
I have to tap.

3182
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:04,720
There's no hold.

3183
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:06,460
There's no hold to aim, guys.

3184
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:07,660
I have to tap.

3185
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:09,180
That's the worst part.

3186
02:50:09,220 --> 02:50:10,400
I have to...

3187
02:50:11,580 --> 02:50:12,540
I can't...

3188
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:13,700
I wish I could...

3189
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:15,700
I wish I could hold to aim.

3190
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:18,620
Okay, nice.

3191
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:21,260
It's just the healers that are alive.

3192
02:50:21,900 --> 02:50:23,020
JK, that's not a healer.

3193
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:24,860
Where's he...

3194
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:25,820
Where's he going?

3195
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:26,920
Where you guys going?

3196
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:28,300
Where you guys going, huh?

3197
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:30,080
Where you guys running off to, huh?

3198
02:50:33,810 --> 02:50:34,290
Nice.

3199
02:50:34,470 --> 02:50:34,710
Win.

3200
02:50:34,810 --> 02:50:35,590
Zero deaths.

3201
02:50:36,070 --> 02:50:36,550
51...

3202
02:50:36,550 --> 02:50:38,370
Okay, yeah, I was definitely not headshotting.

3203
02:50:39,410 --> 02:50:40,430
That's just...

3204
02:50:40,430 --> 02:50:42,370
I was shooting my fucking shit off.

3205
02:50:44,570 --> 02:50:45,170
Nice.

3206
02:50:45,710 --> 02:50:46,450
We did it.

3207
02:50:46,810 --> 02:50:47,450
That was easy.

3208
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:52,020
Alright.

3209
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:53,120
We're going to another ha...

3210
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:54,480
Oh wait, is this version...

3211
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:55,420
Is this sleepy Mita?

3212
02:50:58,400 --> 02:50:59,000
Hello?

3213
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:01,120
Who's there?

3214
02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:03,300
I can sense you.

3215
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:05,200
Listen to me.

3216
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:08,640
Yeah.

3217
02:51:11,380 --> 02:51:12,620
Yeah, it's me.

3218
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:21,500
Are you okay?

3219
02:51:22,220 --> 02:51:23,340
Oh, you're forgetting.

3220
02:51:31,650 --> 02:51:33,170
What's wrong with the clock?

3221
02:51:39,430 --> 02:51:40,430
Did I fix it, Mita?

3222
02:51:45,530 --> 02:51:47,610
I think I fixed it.

3223
02:51:52,070 --> 02:51:53,890
Guys, I don't think I fixed it.

3224
02:51:57,260 --> 02:52:00,760
Oh my god, there's some EXE stuff that broke.

3225
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,560
Guys, I don't...

3226
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:06,640
I wanted to forget everything.

3227
02:52:06,980 --> 02:52:10,440
I don't know if you guys can hear the voices because it looks like it's very quiet in my end.

3228
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:13,840
Ruining the photos.

3229
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:17,380
But now, all I feel is regret.

3230
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:19,420
How stupid I was.

3231
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:23,520
Everybody makes mistakes.

3232
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:26,260
What do we do?

3233
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:30,520
I wish I could just turn back time.

3234
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:36,560
Oh, is the game still really quiet?

3235
02:52:37,540 --> 02:52:38,340
We're at 200.

3236
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:39,860
I could put it up a little bit more.

3237
02:52:41,460 --> 02:52:42,300
Up at 10.

3238
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:45,720
Oh, why did it drop?

3239
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:47,540
Are you okay?

3240
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:48,920
Repeat?

3241
02:52:49,800 --> 02:52:49,800
Repeat?

3242
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:52,740
I don't want to repeat.

3243
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:53,680
What do you mean?

3244
02:52:56,970 --> 02:52:57,530
No.

3245
02:52:57,750 --> 02:52:58,970
No, no more repeat.

3246
02:52:59,590 --> 02:53:00,750
I got the paper.

3247
02:53:01,650 --> 02:53:02,750
I got it.

3248
02:53:03,990 --> 02:53:04,310
Hello?

3249
02:53:06,090 --> 02:53:08,370
Oh, do you want this paper I got here?

3250
02:53:09,470 --> 02:53:12,510
Okay, I guess you don't want the paper.

3251
02:53:12,590 --> 02:53:13,010
That's fine.

3252
02:53:13,930 --> 02:53:15,850
I guess that's okay.

3253
02:53:15,850 --> 02:53:17,730
I guess you don't want it.

3254
02:53:17,810 --> 02:53:19,230
That's okay.

3255
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:24,870
How do I turn back the clock?

3256
02:53:33,100 --> 02:53:34,420
What is time?

3257
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,760
Oh, there's more.

3258
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:40,360
I have more paper.

3259
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:44,700
Oh, I have to search.

3260
02:53:45,380 --> 02:53:47,020
I forgot to install CS Source.

3261
02:53:47,160 --> 02:53:47,340
Yeah.

3262
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:50,780
Oh, it's right in front of me.

3263
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:53,860
Sorry, guys.

3264
02:53:53,940 --> 02:53:56,360
I forgot to install CS Source, guys.

3265
02:53:56,780 --> 02:53:57,620
Silly me.

3266
02:54:02,520 --> 02:54:03,300
Anymore in here?

3267
02:54:04,220 --> 02:54:05,680
Oh, it's under the clock?

3268
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:06,000
Oh, wait.

3269
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:06,680
There's one more here.

3270
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:10,600
Oh, it's right here.

3271
02:54:10,700 --> 02:54:11,300
I see it.

3272
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:13,180
Do I have everything?

3273
02:54:21,910 --> 02:54:23,210
I should have everything, right?

3274
02:54:28,860 --> 02:54:29,300
Okay.

3275
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:38,940
Should be like here.

3276
02:54:40,560 --> 02:54:42,120
And this should be over here.

3277
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:43,180
And then right here.

3278
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:44,200
There you are, Mita!

3279
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:45,580
I fixed you!

3280
02:54:50,350 --> 02:54:51,390
I did it!

3281
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:52,390
I fixed you!

3282
02:54:58,290 --> 02:54:59,390
I did it!

3283
02:54:59,510 --> 02:55:00,250
You're fixed!

3284
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:03,790
Oh, I have to glue it.

3285
02:55:03,930 --> 02:55:07,250
I thought I did everything I needed to do.

3286
02:55:11,980 --> 02:55:12,900
There you go.

3287
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:16,240
See, I told you I can fix her.

3288
02:55:18,220 --> 02:55:20,580
I'm literally fixing her right now.

3289
02:55:28,170 --> 02:55:29,070
Here you go.

3290
02:55:30,750 --> 02:55:31,650
Here you go, Mita.

3291
02:55:31,810 --> 02:55:33,030
This is what you look like.

3292
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:40,780
Oh,

3293
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:46,480
what the fuck happened to your face?

3294
02:55:46,480 --> 02:55:50,840
She took a piece of me.

3295
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:52,540
I threw it away.

3296
02:55:52,740 --> 02:55:53,680
She's strong.

3297
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:54,620
Ugly Mita?

3298
02:55:58,100 --> 02:55:58,540
Cool.

3299
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:06,500
Wardrobe?

3300
02:56:08,760 --> 02:56:10,180
What's in the wardrobe?

3301
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:12,800
Oh!

3302
02:56:32,970 --> 02:56:34,190
Not again.

3303
02:56:34,270 --> 02:56:35,090
Not again.

3304
02:56:35,150 --> 02:56:36,070
Not again.

3305
02:56:36,170 --> 02:56:37,030
Not again.

3306
02:56:37,210 --> 02:56:38,830
Not again.

3307
02:56:39,790 --> 02:56:42,290
Not... not again.

3308
02:56:42,690 --> 02:56:49,110
Oh my god!

3309
02:56:49,610 --> 02:56:50,950
Not again!

3310
02:56:54,670 --> 02:56:55,810
Oh my God.

3311
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:10,200
Oh my God.

3312
02:57:29,250 --> 02:58:00,790
Guys, I need a moment, guys, I actually need a moment, oh my god, oh my fucking god, I've never had real genuine, that was real genuine fear, oh my god, that was, that was, that was real fucking fear in my fucking heart, oh my god, it's the weeping Mita's only,

3313
02:58:01,390 --> 02:58:38,530
I mean, Mita, wake up, Mita, wake the fuck up, Mita, oh my god, please, Mita, please, please, I'm so, Mita, please, I've been through so much, Mita, please, oh my god, this is relatable, because I just went through trauma, I need intimacy and comfort,

02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:20,110
you're fine, I don't feel okay, I don't feel fine, oh my god, holy fuck, that shit was terrifying,

3316
02:59:26,350 --> 02:59:27,460
oh my god,

3317
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:47,690

03:00:00,170 --> 03:00:14,290
okay, I'll get you coffee, meet the coffee makers just over there, I have Mita, Mita, let me go make you coffee,

3320
03:00:21,270 --> 03:00:40,070

3321
03:00:41,130 --> 03:00:45,010
I'm still like... I'm not okay right now.

3322
03:00:45,070 --> 03:00:49,010
I'm actually... I'm not okay from that fucking area.

3323
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:56,220
Alright, just gotta wait for that to boil.

3324
03:00:57,540 --> 03:01:01,580
Alright, it should be over now.

3325
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:04,040
Here's your coffee.

3326
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:05,440
Let's see...

3327
03:01:13,510 --> 03:01:16,370
I'm spinning my mouse.

3328
03:01:17,970 --> 03:01:18,750
Oh my god.

3329
03:01:19,230 --> 03:01:21,190
I didn't realize my door was never closed.

3330
03:01:21,490 --> 03:01:22,130
I'm sorry.

3331
03:01:22,850 --> 03:01:27,930
I'm hearing genuine fear.

3332
03:01:30,490 --> 03:01:34,950
They must have been like, what the fuck is going on in there?

3333
03:01:37,490 --> 03:01:39,090
Here's your coffee, Mita.

3334
03:01:39,490 --> 03:01:39,890
Mita.

3335
03:01:40,530 --> 03:01:41,570
Mita, wake up.

3336
03:01:41,670 --> 03:01:42,670
I got you coffee.

3337
03:01:47,010 --> 03:01:48,050
Here you go.

3338
03:01:49,430 --> 03:01:50,870
Oh, she's so cute.

3339
03:01:51,150 --> 03:01:53,390
I'm like, oh my god, sleepy Mita is really cute.

3340
03:02:02,650 --> 03:02:03,210
Whoa!

3341
03:02:06,510 --> 03:02:07,070
Yeah.

3342
03:02:08,570 --> 03:02:09,130
Yeah.

3343
03:02:09,650 --> 03:02:10,710
I need... yeah, the switches.

3344
03:02:12,090 --> 03:02:14,250
I literally saw it with my eyes.

3345
03:02:15,810 --> 03:02:18,230
Why do I even ask considering you're here?

3346
03:02:20,150 --> 03:02:22,570
If you know plenty already considering you're here.

3347
03:02:27,730 --> 03:02:29,670
I don't know what to say.

3348
03:02:31,090 --> 03:02:32,470
But I need to keep going.

3349
03:02:33,690 --> 03:02:35,370
Keep following the ring's guidance.

3350
03:02:37,810 --> 03:02:38,710
Yeah, I have a ring.

3351
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:41,090
I meant... I meant, what's her name?

3352
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:42,390
Pretty Mita?

3353
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:46,810
That's right.

3354
03:02:47,030 --> 03:02:48,750
So can you help me, Mita?

3355
03:02:49,350 --> 03:02:50,810
Sleepy Mita with the switches?

3356
03:02:55,190 --> 03:02:56,610
With the switches.

3357
03:02:57,970 --> 03:03:01,290
Alright, apparently there's like an outfit in the dining table.

3358
03:03:01,970 --> 03:03:03,510
So let's grab that real quick.

3359
03:03:03,570 --> 03:03:06,150
Let's grab sleepy Mita's fucking outfit.

3360
03:03:07,650 --> 03:03:08,610
Wait, where is it?

3361
03:03:08,690 --> 03:03:10,090
Oh, it's like the pumpkins!

3362
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:14,820
Wait, what?

3363
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:21,420
What?

3364
03:03:28,050 --> 03:03:28,570
Oh!

3365
03:03:30,530 --> 03:03:33,330
Am I supposed to knock it in like an order?

3366
03:03:35,830 --> 03:03:37,130
Oh, I am!

3367
03:03:37,790 --> 03:03:40,950
What kind of fucking trial and error puzzle is this?

3368
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:43,110
Alright.

3369
03:03:45,110 --> 03:03:46,230
This is not a puzzle.

3370
03:03:46,390 --> 03:03:47,210
It's just trial and error.

3371
03:03:50,470 --> 03:03:51,330
There we go.

3372
03:03:52,410 --> 03:03:53,690
Now I have new clothes.

3373
03:03:55,350 --> 03:03:57,110
Now I have new clothes.

3374
03:04:00,460 --> 03:04:02,860
Oh, it shows me that I was not paying attention.

3375
03:04:04,380 --> 03:04:06,160
It shows me.

3376
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:10,220
Mita, come on.

3377
03:04:10,720 --> 03:04:12,460
Let's go already, Mita.

3378
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:19,050
Wake up.

3379
03:04:20,230 --> 03:04:21,050
Come on, Mita.

3380
03:04:21,850 --> 03:04:24,070
We gotta go to the switches, Mita.

3381
03:04:24,210 --> 03:04:24,990
Come on.

3382
03:04:25,710 --> 03:04:28,390
I know you don't want... Oh, Mita, please!

3383
03:04:28,590 --> 03:04:29,350
Oh, please!

3384
03:04:30,290 --> 03:04:31,890
Please get up, Mita.

3385
03:04:32,130 --> 03:04:33,390
I've been through a lot.

3386
03:04:36,590 --> 03:04:37,910
Mita, please.

3387
03:04:38,430 --> 03:04:39,330
Get over here.

3388
03:04:39,410 --> 03:04:41,810
I've been through so much, Mita.

3389
03:04:42,250 --> 03:04:42,750
Please.

3390
03:04:44,030 --> 03:04:45,510
We're almost there.

3391
03:04:45,630 --> 03:04:46,470
Wake up.

3392
03:04:46,910 --> 03:04:48,750
We're almost here.

3393
03:04:50,090 --> 03:04:50,810
Please.

3394
03:04:50,810 --> 03:04:53,110
It's literally... I'm sorry.

3395
03:04:53,290 --> 03:04:56,110
Don't look sad, please, for fuck's sake.

3396
03:04:56,290 --> 03:04:57,590
Don't look sad.

3397
03:04:59,670 --> 03:05:01,610
Just pull the switch.

3398
03:05:03,750 --> 03:05:04,310
Alright.

3399
03:05:05,450 --> 03:05:06,610
I'm ready, too.

3400
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:11,390
No, no, no.

3401
03:05:11,630 --> 03:05:12,550
Just pull the switch.

3402
03:05:12,690 --> 03:05:13,810
We don't need a count.

3403
03:05:13,910 --> 03:05:14,810
Just pull the switch.

3404
03:05:16,170 --> 03:05:17,970
Just keep awake, okay?

3405
03:05:24,450 --> 03:05:25,390
Did it work?

3406
03:05:27,290 --> 03:05:28,350
Wait, I died!

3407
03:05:28,670 --> 03:05:29,230
What?!

3408
03:05:30,810 --> 03:05:33,690
I pressed it the moment she said three!

3409
03:05:36,130 --> 03:05:37,710
Oh my god, okay.

3410
03:05:37,810 --> 03:05:39,030
I'm the sleepy one.

3411
03:05:39,250 --> 03:05:41,870
I literally pressed it the moment she said three.

3412
03:05:42,050 --> 03:05:43,850
Alright, goodbye, sleepy Mita.

3413
03:05:51,700 --> 03:05:52,640
Oh, wow.

3414
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:53,760
She pulled it up for me.

3415
03:05:56,520 --> 03:05:58,380
Alright, goodnight, sleepy Mita.

3416
03:05:58,620 --> 03:05:59,660
Do you want to talk, though?

3417
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:02,860
Okay, she did not want to talk.

3418
03:06:02,980 --> 03:06:03,600
That's fine.

3419
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:05,540
That's fine.

3420
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:06,660
Let me press the button.

3421
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:09,480
Nothing happened.

3422
03:06:10,360 --> 03:06:11,840
Then what's this button doing here?

3423
03:06:12,180 --> 03:06:13,400
Yeah, what is this button for?

3424
03:06:14,660 --> 03:06:16,820
Sleepy Mita, what did that button do?

3425
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:19,160
Mita, the button doesn't work.

3426
03:06:19,240 --> 03:06:19,980
Can you hear me?

3427
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:21,200
Hello?

3428
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:24,940
Sleepy Mita?

3429
03:06:27,260 --> 03:06:30,660
Oh my god, what's gonna be on the other side of this fucking door?

3430
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:32,920
Oh!

3431
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:35,480
Oh, my polygon!

3432
03:06:37,660 --> 03:06:39,640
Oh, no, my bit rate!

3433
03:06:46,330 --> 03:06:49,350
The blinding light was hitting my eyes.

3434
03:06:52,350 --> 03:06:53,750
I shouldn't move.

3435
03:06:53,990 --> 03:06:55,690
I just wait until my vision cleared.

3436
03:06:57,490 --> 03:07:00,730
I'm in a visual novel now!

3437
03:07:01,090 --> 03:07:01,850
Jesus Christ.

3438
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:04,830
Bright sunrise.

3439
03:07:04,990 --> 03:07:08,430
Sunlight poured through the familiar hall windows.

3440
03:07:09,110 --> 03:07:11,290
We always go back to visual novels.

3441
03:07:12,490 --> 03:07:14,870
I just waited a little and I finally glanced around.

3442
03:07:15,410 --> 03:07:21,690
As soon as I shifted my seat, a sharp pain in my gut made my heart race, practically pounding against my shirt.

3443
03:07:26,700 --> 03:07:28,200
Something was definitely wrong.

3444
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:29,540
Was I 2D?

3445
03:07:29,800 --> 03:07:31,880
I'm in a 2D version?!

3446
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:35,880
A dizzy, almost suffocating darkness crept in my head.

3447
03:07:36,340 --> 03:07:39,560
I simply pressed my hands into my lap, trying to steady my breath.

3448
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:45,940
My chest felt... after a few minutes, my breathing settled and I fell into a danger of thinking about what to do next.

3449
03:07:47,200 --> 03:07:48,800
Shit, what do I do now?

3450
03:07:50,880 --> 03:07:56,280
Desperately trying to gather my thoughts, I strained my brain, searching for ideas until one came to me.

3451
03:07:56,820 --> 03:07:59,380
Right, I should just get back to 3D.

3452
03:08:00,500 --> 03:08:03,540
Go out of bounds, just like everyone else used to glitch the game.

3453
03:08:03,540 --> 03:08:06,780
I'm in a visual novel, like, there is no moving for me.

3454
03:08:07,240 --> 03:08:08,520
I can do that too!

3455
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:11,840
I decided to go beyond this 2D reality.

3456
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:14,260
Tween to the left, please.

3457
03:08:14,600 --> 03:08:15,840
Back into 3D.

3458
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:21,440
I reached out, trying to push my head through this into the 3D world.

3459
03:08:21,580 --> 03:08:23,660
Oh my god!

3460
03:08:24,360 --> 03:08:25,400
But nothing.

3461
03:08:25,800 --> 03:08:28,620
Damn, why isn't it working?!

3462
03:08:28,620 --> 03:08:29,420
Oh my god.

3463
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:31,780
Wait, where's the ring?

3464
03:08:32,320 --> 03:08:32,900
Oh crap!

3465
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:36,780
I stopped, realizing this was pointless.

3466
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:40,580
The interface was intangible, like it wasn't really there.

3467
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:45,240
My only choice was to turn back to the living room.

3468
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:48,720
I have to find that ring, no matter what.

3469
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:52,840
Version 0.1 is just text-based adventure.

3470
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:55,880
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3471
03:08:56,180 --> 03:08:59,960
Or maybe I was hidden somewhere in this flat dimension.

3472
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:05,940
Then, just as I took a step, a cute little girl appeared out of nowhere.

3473
03:09:06,100 --> 03:09:07,260
Oh my god, 2D!

3474
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:11,120
She flicked her short pony pigtails.

3475
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:13,720
A mischievous glam in her eyes.

3476
03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:19,460
Watching me from a few steps away, I could feel the excitement rolling off her, and it made me uneasy.

3477
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:22,440
Clearly, she's a devil in disguise.

3478
03:09:24,240 --> 03:09:25,220
I thought.

3479
03:09:25,700 --> 03:09:26,600
I froze.

3480
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:27,420
I froze.

3481
03:09:27,800 --> 03:09:30,520
I'm still not used to these teleporting paranormal types.

3482
03:09:31,460 --> 03:09:34,680
She let out a loud sigh and rolled her eyes.

3483
03:09:35,640 --> 03:09:39,940
That threw me off, and I finally decided I'd be the one to start talking.

3484
03:09:40,820 --> 03:09:41,840
M-Mita?

3485
03:09:43,260 --> 03:09:44,880
She narrowed her eyes in a challenge.

3486
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:47,880
Her voice ran out from all directions.

3487
03:09:48,940 --> 03:09:50,460
Well, who else then?

3488
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:54,120
Have you seen many other girls like me?

3489
03:09:54,560 --> 03:09:57,040
I mean, yes, technically.

3490
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:59,320
And with my name?

3491
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:02,040
Oh, again, yes, Mita.

3492
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:05,220
I got chased by many of them.

3493
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:11,140
She was practically toying with me, acting as if I had wronged her somehow or owed her something.

3494
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:14,460
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

3495
03:10:15,340 --> 03:10:19,200
Honestly, I don't want to know who you're poking around with.

3496
03:10:19,980 --> 03:10:21,400
What are you even doing here?

3497
03:10:22,380 --> 03:10:24,200
You can't just barge in here.

3498
03:10:25,300 --> 03:10:26,820
Her voice was louder now.

3499
03:10:28,220 --> 03:10:31,680
And she punctuated her words by shaking her finger at me.

3500
03:10:31,780 --> 03:10:33,040
Oh my god, she has the ring!

3501
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:39,580
Balanced on that slender finger was the ring, the one that somehow vanished from my hand.

3502
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:41,740
My jaw dropped.

3503
03:10:42,660 --> 03:10:47,920
Her eyes sparkled, a glint of triumph when breaking through her dark lashes.

3504
03:10:48,880 --> 03:10:50,820
Isn't this what you happen to lose here?

3505
03:10:52,140 --> 03:10:57,960
I swallowed hard and tugged at my collar, feeling a knot in my throat.

3506
03:10:59,260 --> 03:11:03,000
Her bold voice combined with her wild intensity sent a chill through me.

3507
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:06,180
Okay, what kind of visual novel are we in now?

3508
03:11:08,900 --> 03:11:11,740
Sent a chill through me.

3509
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:13,700
I was sure of it now.

3510
03:11:14,180 --> 03:11:15,780
This wasn't just some girl.

3511
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:18,400
She was a force of nature.

3512
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:22,740
I took a deep breath and said...

3513
03:11:22,740 --> 03:11:27,100
I'd really appreciate it if you'd give me the ring and show me the way out.

3514
03:11:28,040 --> 03:11:30,320
So this is your little trinket.

3515
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:33,080
I was wondering what it was.

3516
03:11:34,140 --> 03:11:38,200
Her voice suddenly softened, turning playful and curious.

3517
03:11:38,960 --> 03:11:41,740
I felt like a weight had lifted it off my shoulder.

3518
03:11:42,580 --> 03:11:46,940
The storm had passed, and now she seemed almost...

3519
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:50,640
Get me out of this.

3520
03:11:51,300 --> 03:11:53,380
Get me out of this visual novel.

3521
03:11:53,380 --> 03:11:54,780
Get me out.

3522
03:11:56,180 --> 03:12:01,760
Her demeanor shifted from fierce panther to kitten.

3523
03:12:02,360 --> 03:12:03,860
Curious kitten.

3524
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:13,740
I blinked, but in that instant, the two-dimensional Mita vanished, leaving only emptiness in her place.

3525
03:12:14,540 --> 03:12:15,280
Hey.

3526
03:12:16,440 --> 03:12:19,720
I shouted irritably, let's go to the bedroom.

3527
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:21,880
There she was.

3528
03:12:21,880 --> 03:12:29,100
Cross-legged on the bed in the lotus position, as if she's been waiting for me to finally find her.

3529
03:12:30,760 --> 03:12:34,340
She opened her eyes, looking calmly at the wall for a moment.

3530
03:12:35,420 --> 03:12:39,420
Then, with all the agility of a circus acrobat, she bounded over to me.

3531
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:41,320
I got it!

3532
03:12:41,960 --> 03:12:44,180
You want the ring, weirdo?

3533
03:12:45,100 --> 03:12:47,300
Beat me to a tic-tac-toe!

3534
03:12:47,700 --> 03:12:49,620
She grinned, pointing, panting.

3535
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:51,400
What the fuck?

3536
03:12:51,560 --> 03:12:53,800
What do you mean, panting a bit?

3537
03:12:54,240 --> 03:12:56,040
You got up the bed!

3538
03:12:56,540 --> 03:13:02,060
What is wrong with- Tongue sticking out like a dog.

3539
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:07,020
Her cheeky tone and mischievous smirk were in full effect.

3540
03:13:07,440 --> 03:13:12,260
If you are panting after getting up from the bed, there are more problems here.

3541
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:20,300
I gave her shoulders a slight nudge to put some space between us.

3542
03:13:21,260 --> 03:13:24,020
She is out of shape at that point.

3543
03:13:24,260 --> 03:13:26,120
Look, this is really important.

3544
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:27,780
Just had it over.

3545
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:29,440
A lot depends on it.

3546
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:32,160
I kept my voice steady and matter-of-fact.

3547
03:13:33,100 --> 03:13:36,240
But I felt almost ridiculous talking to her in such a measured way.

3548
03:13:37,320 --> 03:13:40,620
She seemed reckless, almost to the point of madness.

3549
03:13:40,620 --> 03:13:45,540
And I could feel a strange humor building in the air between us.

3550
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:47,660
Don't touch me!

3551
03:13:48,360 --> 03:13:50,340
What's so important about this ring anyway?

3552
03:13:51,540 --> 03:13:54,560
Are you some kind of ring-obsessed weirdo?

3553
03:13:56,040 --> 03:13:57,960
Love putting rings on your fingers?

3554
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:01,340
She shot back, louder than ever.

3555
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:03,780
Her taunts even bolder.

3556
03:14:04,460 --> 03:14:06,080
It's a magic ring!

3557
03:14:06,360 --> 03:14:08,040
What more do I have to explain?

3558
03:14:08,460 --> 03:14:09,980
Just give it back to me!

3559
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:13,620
You're a real ring fanatic!

3560
03:14:14,740 --> 03:14:16,440
A magic ring!

3561
03:14:17,620 --> 03:14:18,820
Ha ha ha!

3562
03:14:19,620 --> 03:14:23,600
She burst out laughing, the sound echoing around us.

3563
03:14:24,620 --> 03:14:31,000
I glanced away, feeling awkward as her laughter grew more friendly, almost.

3564
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:33,640
Come on, you weirdo!

3565
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:35,880
Let's play tic-tac-toe!

3566
03:14:36,940 --> 03:14:39,780
Don't waste time making excuses!

3567
03:14:40,900 --> 03:14:44,900
They do love games, I thought to myself.

3568
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:46,740
Alright, fine.

3569
03:14:47,140 --> 03:14:48,340
Let's do this.

3570
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:51,840
I don't like this perspective in this drawing.

3571
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:53,080
I feel a little weird.

3572
03:14:58,890 --> 03:15:00,350
Feels a bit weird.

3573
03:15:04,830 --> 03:15:06,090
You can start.

3574
03:15:06,250 --> 03:15:07,950
I'm feeling generous today.

3575
03:15:10,810 --> 03:15:11,370
Okay.

3576
03:15:11,370 --> 03:15:12,430
Alright, the center.

3577
03:15:13,110 --> 03:15:14,450
I made the first move.

3578
03:15:15,150 --> 03:15:16,150
You gave yourself away!

3579
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:18,370
I know why you chose the X and left me with the Os!

3580
03:15:18,650 --> 03:15:19,170
Psychology!

3581
03:15:19,810 --> 03:15:21,150
The Xs are all about closure!

3582
03:15:22,010 --> 03:15:23,510
Hiding stuff, holding secrets!

3583
03:15:23,790 --> 03:15:24,630
You're nervous!

3584
03:15:25,270 --> 03:15:25,830
Okay.

3585
03:15:26,470 --> 03:15:27,590
Alright, buddy.

3586
03:15:29,530 --> 03:15:30,090
Alright.

3587
03:15:31,770 --> 03:15:32,930
And I get it.

3588
03:15:32,930 --> 03:15:37,390
Next to someone as drop-dead gorgeous as me, you think you're just drop-dead.

3589
03:15:37,950 --> 03:15:39,650
Why do you think Os were just better for me?

3590
03:15:40,070 --> 03:15:42,250
Psychology says you're trying to insult me.

3591
03:15:42,550 --> 03:15:43,490
Sharp, dude.

3592
03:15:43,730 --> 03:15:44,710
Very sharp.

3593
03:15:46,390 --> 03:15:48,550
Alright, let me just play tic-tac-toe.

3594
03:15:49,010 --> 03:15:50,530
I thought I made a smart move.

3595
03:15:51,010 --> 03:15:51,990
I like this meme.

3596
03:15:52,290 --> 03:15:55,950
Those little crosses, they think you can just take over everything.

3597
03:15:56,830 --> 03:15:59,050
But here, I get to ruin them!

3598
03:15:59,870 --> 03:16:01,590
But it's like I'm some kind of hero!

3599
03:16:02,150 --> 03:16:02,490
What?

3600
03:16:02,830 --> 03:16:04,030
Am I saying something weird?

3601
03:16:04,410 --> 03:16:06,370
You're giving me that look!

3602
03:16:08,950 --> 03:16:10,550
Alright, here's another X.

3603
03:16:10,870 --> 03:16:12,950
While she kept up her loud commentary.

3604
03:16:14,450 --> 03:16:15,010
It's symbolic!

3605
03:16:15,230 --> 03:16:17,290
Like, you're trying to avoid the ring!

3606
03:16:17,730 --> 03:16:19,390
But, it's not working!

3607
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:21,230
Clever, aren't you?

3608
03:16:21,990 --> 03:16:23,390
You want the ring, don't you?

3609
03:16:23,650 --> 03:16:24,290
Come on!

3610
03:16:24,490 --> 03:16:25,350
Win it from me!

3611
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:28,670
My god, like, I don't know what you want me to do.

3612
03:16:29,010 --> 03:16:30,830
Like, I'll just put my X right here.

3613
03:16:31,390 --> 03:16:35,290
We played through the game and with each move, she kept laughing and talking.

3614
03:16:35,290 --> 03:16:39,210
As the game neared its end, it's clear who would win.

3615
03:16:39,410 --> 03:16:41,530
But suddenly, nobody?

3616
03:16:42,590 --> 03:16:45,670
Our game was interrupted by a loud knock on the door.

3617
03:16:46,510 --> 03:16:48,290
The banging grew louder.

3618
03:16:48,970 --> 03:16:50,570
She's like, it's clear who's gonna win.

3619
03:16:50,630 --> 03:16:51,950
I'm like, yeah, none of us!

3620
03:16:52,570 --> 03:16:54,290
Each hit feeling a shock.

3621
03:16:54,710 --> 03:16:55,830
The floor beneath us.

3622
03:16:56,390 --> 03:16:56,690
Whoa!

3623
03:16:57,290 --> 03:16:58,070
Finally, the door.

3624
03:16:58,210 --> 03:16:58,490
Whoa!

3625
03:17:00,490 --> 03:17:02,130
The door burst open.

3626
03:17:02,130 --> 03:17:09,750
An enraged, crazy Mita in her usual larger-than-life form, stopping in the center of the room.

3627
03:17:10,830 --> 03:17:13,550
I froze, feeling myself go pale with shock.

3628
03:17:15,030 --> 03:17:19,170
The 2D Mita looked genuinely frightened, yet she's never seen 3D before.

3629
03:17:19,550 --> 03:17:20,730
She's like, what the fuck?

3630
03:17:21,730 --> 03:17:23,010
What is this?

3631
03:17:26,190 --> 03:17:27,130
What are you doing here?

3632
03:17:28,410 --> 03:17:30,710
How many more Mitas do you need to find before you settle down?

3633
03:17:32,910 --> 03:17:34,310
What's the deal with this?

3634
03:17:35,010 --> 03:17:36,030
I hate this flat world.

3635
03:17:37,810 --> 03:17:38,890
It's boring.

3636
03:17:39,880 --> 03:17:40,150
Whoa!

3637
03:17:40,930 --> 03:17:41,470
Lame.

3638
03:17:43,970 --> 03:17:48,090
I grabbed my style 2D friend's hand and bolted towards the exit.

3639
03:17:48,510 --> 03:17:51,990
The hall twisted oddly as we sprinted down the long corridor.

3640
03:17:52,550 --> 03:17:55,050
Pounding, the footsteps behind us driving us forward.

3641
03:17:55,390 --> 03:17:56,650
I couldn't tell how long we ran.

3642
03:17:56,970 --> 03:17:59,810
The pounding in my ears from the panic and strain blocked everything else out.

3643
03:17:59,810 --> 03:18:04,270
I barely noticed that 2D Mita was trying to talk until she suddenly slipped her hand free from mine.

3644
03:18:04,970 --> 03:18:06,590
Hey, calm down, will you?

3645
03:18:07,170 --> 03:18:08,570
No one's chasing us anymore.

3646
03:18:09,450 --> 03:18:09,970
Huh?

3647
03:18:10,690 --> 03:18:11,770
Oh, okay.

3648
03:18:13,030 --> 03:18:16,550
The boldness had drained from her face, leaving her looking a bit sad.

3649
03:18:17,170 --> 03:18:17,810
Almost apologetic.

3650
03:18:19,310 --> 03:18:22,550
She stared at the floor, tracing little circles with her toes.

3651
03:18:23,810 --> 03:18:25,170
Not dope, you 123.

3652
03:18:25,610 --> 03:18:26,730
You wanted that ring, right?

3653
03:18:27,470 --> 03:18:31,010
Well, you beat me fair and square, so here.

3654
03:18:32,210 --> 03:18:36,010
She slid the ring back into my hand, and now we're married.

3655
03:18:39,810 --> 03:18:41,950
Well, thanks, shall we?

3656
03:18:42,690 --> 03:18:47,730
She glanced up and smiled, fidgeting up to her fingers and said in an uncertain tone.

3657
03:18:48,970 --> 03:18:49,610
Where to?

3658
03:18:50,290 --> 03:18:52,770
I don't really have anywhere else to go.

3659
03:18:54,170 --> 03:18:56,090
Thanks for playing, weirdo.

3660
03:18:56,730 --> 03:18:58,170
Come back sometime.

3661
03:18:59,230 --> 03:19:00,970
As she spoke, something strange happened.

3662
03:19:01,930 --> 03:19:05,670
The world around us shifted, folding back into the house.

3663
03:19:07,510 --> 03:19:11,450
2D Mita's dialogue flickered and started displaying a phrase I couldn't recognize.

3664
03:19:13,070 --> 03:19:13,790
Cakes?

3665
03:19:13,970 --> 03:19:15,370
I can't stand them!

3666
03:19:19,060 --> 03:19:20,160
What the fuck?

3667
03:19:22,540 --> 03:19:23,780
Gamer Mita?

3668
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:28,040
Oh my god, she's cute.

3669
03:19:30,940 --> 03:19:33,560
Oh my god, nerd Mita.

3670
03:19:36,220 --> 03:19:38,840
Oh my god, it's gamer girl Mita.

3671
03:19:40,540 --> 03:19:41,440
Where's the game?

3672
03:19:43,440 --> 03:19:44,500
You ruined the route!

3673
03:19:45,780 --> 03:19:47,120
What do you want?

3674
03:19:48,840 --> 03:19:50,400
I need the version.

3675
03:19:52,280 --> 03:19:54,900
I have to get back to the old version somehow.

3676
03:19:56,720 --> 03:19:57,100
Okay.

3677
03:19:59,380 --> 03:20:01,220
I'm way too busy to entertain you.

3678
03:20:01,320 --> 03:20:02,780
You silly head.

3679
03:20:03,860 --> 03:20:04,660
And what's that?

3680
03:20:04,740 --> 03:20:05,180
Toys?

3681
03:20:12,690 --> 03:20:16,530
There'll be no friendship between us.

3682
03:20:17,650 --> 03:20:19,090
Listen, I need to get to the core.

3683
03:20:20,870 --> 03:20:22,770
It's your fault I got hurt.

3684
03:20:24,210 --> 03:20:24,730
Damn.

3685
03:20:25,250 --> 03:20:25,570
Huh?

3686
03:20:27,370 --> 03:20:28,890
Oh my god, she's cute.

3687
03:20:29,090 --> 03:20:29,950
I really like this Mita.

3688
03:20:30,330 --> 03:20:31,450
I think this is my favorite Mita.

3689
03:20:36,450 --> 03:20:37,990
But you're Mita too.

3690
03:20:39,590 --> 03:20:40,370
I'm Mila?

3691
03:20:44,490 --> 03:20:47,710
Mita here, Mita there, Mita's all over the place.

3692
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:49,170
So you're Mila?

3693
03:20:51,890 --> 03:20:53,970
What's the difference between Mila and Mita?

3694
03:21:00,730 --> 03:21:01,210
Yeah?

3695
03:21:01,670 --> 03:21:03,190
I mean, that's been working so far.

3696
03:21:07,860 --> 03:21:12,880
I mean, just walking out has been working, so like, why would it be any different?

3697
03:21:15,780 --> 03:21:17,280
Alright, I'm just gonna open this door.

3698
03:21:17,620 --> 03:21:17,980
Woah!

3699
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:23,140
Oh my god, look, it's nerd Mila.

3700
03:21:24,400 --> 03:21:26,420
Oh my god, she's such a nerd.

3701
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:27,400
Look at her.

3702
03:21:27,940 --> 03:21:29,700
Oh my god, look, she has a dictionary.

3703
03:21:30,500 --> 03:21:32,040
What is that?

3704
03:21:36,700 --> 03:21:39,920
Oh my god, she has a dictionary and everything.

3705
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:42,480
She reads!

3706
03:21:42,700 --> 03:21:43,680
Oh, she's perfect.

3707
03:21:47,780 --> 03:21:48,740
Oh, alright.

3708
03:21:49,060 --> 03:21:49,840
Hey, that's me.

3709
03:21:50,740 --> 03:21:51,380
Oh, that's right.

3710
03:21:51,840 --> 03:21:52,400
That's me.

3711
03:21:52,920 --> 03:21:53,260
That's right.

3712
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:57,460
Uh, yeah I did.

3713
03:21:58,100 --> 03:21:58,580
Damn it all.

3714
03:21:59,940 --> 03:22:00,760
What is that?

3715
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:02,460
I don't know.

3716
03:22:02,460 --> 03:22:04,640
That's probably another passage.

3717
03:22:05,300 --> 03:22:06,220
How do I get out of here?

3718
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:08,560
There's supposed to be a way out here.

3719
03:22:11,680 --> 03:22:12,160
What?

3720
03:22:12,580 --> 03:22:13,660
What version is this?

3721
03:22:14,560 --> 03:22:16,220
One point only fans?

3722
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:19,820
Why is this 1.0F?

3723
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:22,080
It's evening.

3724
03:22:22,200 --> 03:22:22,840
Wait, you're right.

3725
03:22:22,980 --> 03:22:23,920
It's not white anymore.

3726
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:25,900
It's evening outside.

3727
03:22:26,760 --> 03:22:27,840
I like the evening.

3728
03:22:29,680 --> 03:22:30,560
When will night fall?

3729
03:22:33,780 --> 03:22:34,860
Endless days here?

3730
03:22:35,820 --> 03:22:36,920
Just one after another?

3731
03:22:38,460 --> 03:22:39,440
Like, they're on repeat.

3732
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:42,640
What about another name?

3733
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:44,100
Mila?

3734
03:22:45,220 --> 03:22:45,820
Mika?

3735
03:22:46,640 --> 03:22:47,660
Or Misa?

3736
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:49,960
Ah, Mila.

3737
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:50,720
That's it.

3738
03:22:51,040 --> 03:22:51,380
Why?

3739
03:22:51,780 --> 03:22:52,360
Oh, nothing.

3740
03:22:53,860 --> 03:22:55,100
Is your eyesight bad?

3741
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:56,940
Why do you need glasses?

3742
03:22:58,340 --> 03:22:58,980
What?

3743
03:22:59,060 --> 03:22:59,880
Don't like them?

3744
03:23:02,720 --> 03:23:05,000
Yeah, and you look really cute with glasses.

3745
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:05,420
What is this?

3746
03:23:15,280 --> 03:23:17,520
Oh wait, a switch.

3747
03:23:18,680 --> 03:23:20,400
That thing doesn't work?

3748
03:23:24,520 --> 03:23:25,200
Wait,

3749
03:23:30,260 --> 03:23:31,680
the bathroom switch works?

3750
03:23:31,900 --> 03:23:33,280
Wait, can I check the bathroom?

3751
03:23:37,590 --> 03:23:38,770
Oh, I can!

3752
03:23:40,910 --> 03:23:42,550
Is this soap real?

3753
03:23:42,910 --> 03:23:44,430
Or just another decoration?

3754
03:23:49,450 --> 03:23:53,570
Most things here are actually acting like the real deal, honestly.

3755
03:23:54,790 --> 03:23:55,170
Okay.

3756
03:23:55,830 --> 03:23:57,810
Why doesn't the mirror work though, Mila?

3757
03:23:58,430 --> 03:23:59,130
And no reflection?

3758
03:24:07,290 --> 03:24:09,230
I can't make them.

3759
03:24:09,910 --> 03:24:11,390
I can't do it, okay.

3760
03:24:11,770 --> 03:24:12,250
Oh!

3761
03:24:12,770 --> 03:24:15,630
So this Mila doesn't know how to do it.

3762
03:24:15,650 --> 03:24:16,150
Oh my god, look!

3763
03:24:16,190 --> 03:24:17,050
I turned off the light!

3764
03:24:18,190 --> 03:24:19,170
I did it!

3765
03:24:20,290 --> 03:24:21,770
It works, guys!

3766
03:24:23,070 --> 03:24:26,750
Oh, it's smart ass Mila.

3767
03:24:31,390 --> 03:24:35,170
She's like that person who's... Oh wait, oh my gosh, she has a katana?

3768
03:24:39,230 --> 03:24:44,430
She's the Mito who's like, I know more than you, and then you get her flustered and she's like...

3769
03:24:47,470 --> 03:24:51,510
She might be a smart ass, but when you fluster her, she gets...

3770
03:24:53,690 --> 03:24:55,170
She folds instantly.

3771
03:24:56,890 --> 03:24:58,530
These pictures, are they real?

3772
03:25:02,470 --> 03:25:04,150
Yeah, they exist, but they're almost too intense.

3773
03:25:04,550 --> 03:25:05,530
I'm Mila, got it?

3774
03:25:05,590 --> 03:25:06,530
Not like the rest.

3775
03:25:08,890 --> 03:25:10,090
And these...

3776
03:25:10,090 --> 03:25:11,290
They're drawings, you know.

3777
03:25:13,730 --> 03:25:15,310
Pretend to be more than they are.

3778
03:25:15,410 --> 03:25:16,530
I've seen other Mitas...

3779
03:25:18,170 --> 03:25:20,090
Standing just like this.

3780
03:25:20,210 --> 03:25:21,470
Oh my god, they T-pose!

3781
03:25:23,030 --> 03:25:23,430
Mila?

3782
03:25:24,350 --> 03:25:24,730
Hello?

3783
03:25:28,930 --> 03:25:31,650
After all that, I don't wanna be like that.

3784
03:25:33,430 --> 03:25:34,630
It's disgusting!

3785
03:25:35,210 --> 03:25:38,030
You don't wanna be a filthy T-poser.

3786
03:25:39,310 --> 03:25:40,630
Why do you even read books?

3787
03:25:41,870 --> 03:25:43,090
There's the internet.

3788
03:25:43,450 --> 03:25:44,210
That's so true.

3789
03:25:44,430 --> 03:25:45,530
So true, bestie.

3790
03:25:49,730 --> 03:25:52,890
But I'd rather have a real book in my hands.

3791
03:25:53,190 --> 03:25:55,250
Yeah, like, it's a trap.

3792
03:25:55,650 --> 03:25:58,630
Why do I have two copies of some of the same books?

3793
03:25:59,670 --> 03:26:00,710
And physics.

3794
03:26:02,390 --> 03:26:05,170
These are some good books, guys.

3795
03:26:05,510 --> 03:26:07,010
I can't wait to read.

3796
03:26:07,450 --> 03:26:11,610
I can't wait to read, it's a trap or clever book.

3797
03:26:12,830 --> 03:26:15,230
Oh, a thoughtful gentleman!

3798
03:26:17,090 --> 03:26:17,830
What you need him for?

3799
03:26:18,930 --> 03:26:20,050
I'll find out.

3800
03:26:20,050 --> 03:26:21,170
Soon enough.

3801
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:25,710
And why are you always doing this impression of him?

3802
03:26:26,690 --> 03:26:28,350
Just keep your face simple.

3803
03:26:30,030 --> 03:26:30,670
Uh...

3804
03:26:30,670 --> 03:26:31,870
Okay...

3805
03:26:31,870 --> 03:26:32,890
Okay...

3806
03:26:32,890 --> 03:26:33,830
Okay, Mila.

3807
03:26:38,570 --> 03:26:41,450
Anything here other than this giant whirlpool?

3808
03:26:45,190 --> 03:26:45,580
Whee...

3809
03:26:46,570 --> 03:26:47,350
Whoops.

3810
03:26:49,170 --> 03:26:50,550
I don't think she liked that.

3811
03:26:50,910 --> 03:26:53,070
She literally pushed me away.

3812
03:26:53,970 --> 03:26:54,810
Is this yours?

3813
03:27:02,530 --> 03:27:03,850
Oh, it likes my ring.

3814
03:27:06,450 --> 03:27:07,650
An engagement ring.

3815
03:27:09,350 --> 03:27:11,270
It was given to me by one of the other Mitas.

3816
03:27:11,450 --> 03:27:12,750
One of the thousands of them.

3817
03:27:14,190 --> 03:27:15,850
The one that might be able to get me out.

3818
03:27:17,490 --> 03:27:20,750
Yo, if my house blows up, you're dead too.

3819
03:27:20,910 --> 03:27:21,590
You're gonna touch it?

3820
03:27:21,610 --> 03:27:22,250
I'm gonna touch it.

3821
03:27:22,610 --> 03:27:23,470
I'm gonna touch it!

3822
03:27:23,730 --> 03:27:24,590
What are you gonna do, Mila?

3823
03:27:24,590 --> 03:27:26,330
I'm gonna touch it!

3824
03:27:26,450 --> 03:27:27,850
I'm gonna stick my hand through the hole!

3825
03:27:28,330 --> 03:27:29,270
Play Silent Hill!

3826
03:27:31,730 --> 03:27:33,390
Oh my god, okay.

3827
03:27:38,280 --> 03:27:38,840
Alright.

3828
03:27:40,480 --> 03:27:41,040
Alright.

3829
03:27:43,120 --> 03:27:43,680
Alright.

3830
03:27:48,820 --> 03:27:50,900
Hardest puzzle of my fucking life.

3831
03:27:52,420 --> 03:27:54,280
Oh, am I supposed to put it in the center?

3832
03:28:06,390 --> 03:28:10,310
Oh my god, it is the hardest puzzle of my fucking life.

3833
03:28:17,910 --> 03:28:19,370
There we go.

3834
03:28:21,590 --> 03:28:22,930
That's pretty cool.

3835
03:28:23,090 --> 03:28:24,230
Wait, that's such a cool puzzle.

3836
03:28:24,310 --> 03:28:25,070
I like that puzzle.

3837
03:28:26,190 --> 03:28:26,750
Physics.

3838
03:28:27,770 --> 03:28:29,390
That was actually a really cool puzzle.

3839
03:28:33,160 --> 03:28:34,280
Hello, Mila?

3840
03:28:35,260 --> 03:28:36,220
Did I fix it?

3841
03:28:37,660 --> 03:28:38,540
Mila?

3842
03:28:41,320 --> 03:28:42,200
Mila?

3843
03:28:46,370 --> 03:28:46,530
Wow!

3844
03:28:54,390 --> 03:28:55,270
Okay.

3845
03:29:00,210 --> 03:29:04,890
Does she have extra dialogue?

3846
03:29:05,410 --> 03:29:06,530
Okay, this is lore.

3847
03:29:08,270 --> 03:29:09,610
It's lore, guys.

3848
03:29:10,290 --> 03:29:13,930
I'm just trying to see if there's anything extra for the lore.

3849
03:29:16,430 --> 03:29:16,970
Okay.

3850
03:29:18,810 --> 03:29:20,170
Oh, she's still there.

3851
03:29:20,770 --> 03:29:21,150
Okay.

3852
03:29:23,170 --> 03:29:25,330
I was just trying to see if there's any lore!

3853
03:29:28,410 --> 03:29:29,270
Wait, what?

3854
03:29:36,690 --> 03:29:43,670
No, I... I... Why did you say barge into... I... I... I fucking... I... Why were you in the bathroom?

3855
03:29:49,930 --> 03:29:52,070
I just... I don't... Glitches?

3856
03:29:52,270 --> 03:29:53,170
I fixed it!

3857
03:29:55,590 --> 03:29:58,090
Well, my house is still standing.

3858
03:29:59,030 --> 03:30:01,250
I'm assuming you handled the glitch in the kitchen.

3859
03:30:01,430 --> 03:30:03,450
Yeah, I... I... I fixed it.

3860
03:30:03,630 --> 03:30:03,890
Yeah.

3861
03:30:07,070 --> 03:30:09,910
Oh, thank you, Mila, for the permission.

3862
03:30:10,570 --> 03:30:13,090
Thank you, Mila.

3863
03:30:14,410 --> 03:30:16,450
What am I supposed to do in the... Woah!

3864
03:30:17,130 --> 03:30:18,230
Oh, okay.

3865
03:30:18,490 --> 03:30:19,730
Oh my god.

3866
03:30:20,190 --> 03:30:22,570
Mila, how would you live without me, Mila?

3867
03:30:23,110 --> 03:30:26,130
Why are there so many glitches in your fucking bathroom?

3868
03:30:30,100 --> 03:30:30,440
What?

3869
03:30:33,300 --> 03:30:33,980
Oh!

3870
03:30:34,520 --> 03:30:35,920
Wait, this is so interesting.

3871
03:30:48,480 --> 03:30:50,040
I guess I'll go here.

3872
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:56,720
Wait, I love the... Oh my god, these puzzles are so... wild.

3873
03:30:58,400 --> 03:31:00,180
Yeah, I love all the different puzzles.

3874
03:31:00,480 --> 03:31:01,340
They're so wild.

3875
03:31:03,140 --> 03:31:04,980
Alright, I fixed your bathroom, too!

3876
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:07,140
How did you use the bathroom without me?

3877
03:31:11,400 --> 03:31:11,760
Mila?

3878
03:31:16,970 --> 03:31:17,450
Mila?

3879
03:31:19,430 --> 03:31:19,910
Mila?

3880
03:31:20,150 --> 03:31:21,650
What are you doing under there?

3881
03:31:27,370 --> 03:31:28,950
You scared me again.

3882
03:31:29,590 --> 03:31:30,170
What do you want?

3883
03:31:31,150 --> 03:31:32,550
Have you seen any more glitches?

3884
03:31:35,210 --> 03:31:40,810
Oh, so your problem is supposed to be an excuse to stop me from finishing... I'm fixing your home, Mila!

3885
03:31:41,110 --> 03:31:42,490
Okay, I don't like her anymore.

3886
03:31:42,950 --> 03:31:47,710
I have to ask.

3887
03:31:49,310 --> 03:31:51,670
You wanna go out there?

3888
03:31:53,370 --> 03:31:54,190
Don't you?

3889
03:31:54,690 --> 03:31:55,510
Yeah, that's right.

3890
03:31:56,230 --> 03:31:57,530
I wanna get out of this game.

3891
03:31:59,630 --> 03:32:01,370
That might sound strange.

3892
03:32:03,690 --> 03:32:05,970
But, would you stay and read with me?

3893
03:32:06,190 --> 03:32:07,070
Okay, I like her again.

3894
03:32:08,990 --> 03:32:10,410
First, you're yelling at me.

3895
03:32:10,790 --> 03:32:13,730
Now, you're at... Oh man, she's giving me the hot and cold treatment.

3896
03:32:13,870 --> 03:32:14,890
Oh, she knows what I want.

3897
03:32:16,610 --> 03:32:19,070
But, I have to keep moving.

3898
03:32:20,670 --> 03:32:23,110
Go out and look for your glitches.

3899
03:32:23,370 --> 03:32:25,630
Oh, she's making me want more.

3900
03:32:29,170 --> 03:32:30,610
Because of you.

3901
03:32:33,190 --> 03:32:35,710
She's keeping it interesting.

3902
03:32:39,630 --> 03:32:41,070
Alright, off I go.

3903
03:32:41,350 --> 03:32:43,150
Oh, still doesn't work.

3904
03:32:43,450 --> 03:32:44,690
I thought I fixed the glitches.

3905
03:32:45,690 --> 03:32:49,190
Oh no, there's a one fucking giant glitch here.

3906
03:32:53,250 --> 03:32:55,030
Alright, I'm in.

3907
03:33:00,020 --> 03:33:01,900
Okay, let's see.

3908
03:33:02,040 --> 03:33:02,840
What is this puzzle?

3909
03:33:06,810 --> 03:33:07,530
Oh.

3910
03:33:08,070 --> 03:33:08,790
Oh!

3911
03:33:09,290 --> 03:33:11,310
Okay, I mean that's easy.

3912
03:33:12,290 --> 03:33:14,450
We just transfer everything over, I assume.

3913
03:33:20,770 --> 03:33:21,810
There we go.

3914
03:33:26,330 --> 03:33:27,770
And then...

3915
03:33:28,770 --> 03:33:30,910
And then, we'll put this here first.

3916
03:33:33,890 --> 03:33:37,670
So, we can transfer these guys back.

3917
03:33:43,390 --> 03:33:47,170
And then, get the circles back in here.

3918
03:33:48,650 --> 03:33:50,290
There we go, we got all the stars back.

3919
03:33:54,770 --> 03:33:55,490
Alright.

3920
03:33:57,290 --> 03:33:58,430
Oh wait, fuck.

3921
03:33:58,550 --> 03:33:59,130
Whoops.

3922
03:34:04,590 --> 03:34:06,290
I got- I lost track of the shapes.

3923
03:34:06,410 --> 03:34:07,890
There are way too many shapes in my screen.

3924
03:34:09,530 --> 03:34:11,510
Wait, there's so many shapes.

3925
03:34:11,610 --> 03:34:14,990
My eyes actually was like, oh my god, that's so many shapes.

3926
03:34:16,010 --> 03:34:17,750
Yeah, man that shit scared me.

3927
03:34:17,870 --> 03:34:18,990
Oh, is she gonna cut him up?

3928
03:34:21,730 --> 03:34:24,350
He goes into the square hole.

3929
03:34:25,610 --> 03:34:26,010
Do it!

3930
03:34:30,210 --> 03:34:31,170
Holy shit.

3931
03:34:33,910 --> 03:34:35,270
What the fuck?

3932
03:34:37,730 --> 03:34:39,210
Oh my god.

3933
03:34:40,970 --> 03:34:41,870
But she's perfect.

3934
03:34:44,090 --> 03:34:45,250
Oh my god.

3935
03:34:45,930 --> 03:34:46,430
What happened?

3936
03:34:47,630 --> 03:34:49,230
I thought you said I looked like him.

3937
03:34:50,010 --> 03:34:50,890
What does that mean?

3938
03:34:53,050 --> 03:34:54,770
It's just, we're in a game.

3939
03:34:56,550 --> 03:34:59,710
Here with a snap of your fingers, anything's possible.

3940
03:34:59,710 --> 03:35:03,210
Oh jeez, you have to break the reality.

3941
03:35:05,750 --> 03:35:09,230
You think I've been reading all those books for?

3942
03:35:09,450 --> 03:35:11,950
So I can snap my fingers and be done with it?

3943
03:35:13,070 --> 03:35:15,170
I'd rather do everything myself.

3944
03:35:15,910 --> 03:35:18,330
Exactly the way the books described it.

3945
03:35:21,250 --> 03:35:23,330
She really said, you're next.

3946
03:35:23,510 --> 03:35:25,350
Yeah, cause she was like, woah, okay.

3947
03:35:25,990 --> 03:35:29,930
Cause she was like, that statue looks just like you.

3948
03:35:30,230 --> 03:35:32,170
And now that statue is gone.

3949
03:35:32,890 --> 03:35:34,370
Oh, there's two more glitches.

3950
03:35:37,610 --> 03:35:38,410
There's two more.

3951
03:35:38,550 --> 03:35:40,010
There has to be one back in the room, right?

3952
03:35:40,170 --> 03:35:40,890
Yeah, there is.

3953
03:35:42,970 --> 03:35:44,030
Is there a costume?

3954
03:35:44,310 --> 03:35:45,010
Where's her costume?

3955
03:35:46,770 --> 03:35:49,910
I feel like I looked at... Oh, there it is.

3956
03:35:49,950 --> 03:35:50,450
There's a butterfly.

3957
03:35:51,590 --> 03:35:52,710
Have you seen nature?

3958
03:35:53,310 --> 03:35:55,910
Oh, the chibi thing changed too.

3959
03:35:56,810 --> 03:35:58,270
I have a book here somewhere.

3960
03:35:59,590 --> 03:36:01,030
It even has little wings pressed.

3961
03:36:06,030 --> 03:36:08,450
It's a bit crooked though.

3962
03:36:12,270 --> 03:36:13,630
Wait a minute, it's gone!

3963
03:36:17,570 --> 03:36:19,810
It looked at me?!

3964
03:36:20,490 --> 03:36:22,930
You see a girl walking in nature?

3965
03:36:23,070 --> 03:36:24,270
It's such a silly question.

3966
03:36:25,250 --> 03:36:26,610
I would, of course.

3967
03:36:27,910 --> 03:36:29,010
Where did it go?

3968
03:36:32,530 --> 03:36:36,130
Just got back from that flat dimension and now here we are again.

3969
03:36:37,870 --> 03:36:39,890
I can't wait to get back to the real world.

3970
03:36:42,910 --> 03:36:44,730
The real world, huh?

3971
03:36:45,170 --> 03:36:46,970
Like an urban legend.

3972
03:36:47,850 --> 03:36:49,230
Never seen it myself.

3973
03:36:51,230 --> 03:36:54,830
I think there has to be a way back.

3974
03:36:56,030 --> 03:36:57,350
Aren't you confident?

3975
03:36:57,970 --> 03:36:58,650
What a joke.

3976
03:37:00,590 --> 03:37:01,310
Alright,

3977
03:37:05,690 --> 03:37:06,650
let's fix this glitch.

3978
03:37:08,570 --> 03:37:11,870
Yeah, I thought I looked like the Windows XP background too.

3979
03:37:14,850 --> 03:37:16,750
Alright, the last glitch.

3980
03:37:17,130 --> 03:37:17,950
What's this?

3981
03:37:18,890 --> 03:37:20,850
Oh, okay.

3982
03:37:22,150 --> 03:37:24,390
Okay, it's Space Invaders.

3983
03:37:27,870 --> 03:37:30,910
Oh my god, I need to reload my fingers.

3984
03:37:31,770 --> 03:37:34,550
It's just like Marble Rivals training right here.

3985
03:37:35,790 --> 03:37:38,730
Marble Rivals training right here.

3986
03:37:41,770 --> 03:37:43,210
Right here.

3987
03:37:45,810 --> 03:37:47,130
Right here.

3988
03:37:47,490 --> 03:37:48,250
Okay, there we go.

3989
03:37:50,110 --> 03:37:52,070
Okay, right here.

3990
03:37:58,470 --> 03:37:59,130
Nice.

3991
03:37:59,970 --> 03:38:00,690
I fixed it.

3992
03:38:02,810 --> 03:38:05,670
Oh my god, she's doing push-ups.

3993
03:38:07,790 --> 03:38:09,070
Can't you tell?

3994
03:38:09,290 --> 03:38:11,030
But why are you doing it?

3995
03:38:11,780 --> 03:38:14,230
The knee push-up.

3996
03:38:16,820 --> 03:38:17,820
You're acting weird.

3997
03:38:21,080 --> 03:38:22,620
I wasn't serious.

3998
03:38:23,200 --> 03:38:25,660
I mean, why are you freaking working out in front of me?

3999
03:38:26,620 --> 03:38:27,700
I'm unique.

4000
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:31,840
I want to be different from everyone else as possible.

4001
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,120
I'm not like other Mitas.

4002
03:38:35,340 --> 03:38:36,220
I'm Mila.

4003
03:38:37,060 --> 03:38:38,300
Oh my god, she's here.

4004
03:38:38,620 --> 03:38:40,980
Oh my god, I'm not like other Mitas.

4005
03:38:41,300 --> 03:38:41,880
I'm Mila.

4006
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:44,140
See that?

4007
03:38:45,700 --> 03:38:46,980
Now, no hands.

4008
03:38:47,700 --> 03:38:51,820
What the f- I know it's a game, but this is ridiculous.

4009
03:38:52,300 --> 03:38:55,960
What the f- What the f- Okay, alright.

4010
03:38:56,140 --> 03:38:58,040
There's at least a little bit of realism.

4011
03:38:59,560 --> 03:39:00,280
Keeper.

4012
03:39:01,660 --> 03:39:03,040
Stupid physics.

4013
03:39:03,540 --> 03:39:06,400
You talk about realism, and then...

4014
03:39:07,020 --> 03:39:07,660
Boom!

4015
03:39:07,820 --> 03:39:08,920
This happens.

4016
03:39:09,940 --> 03:39:11,440
Goddamn fucking physics.

4017
03:39:12,320 --> 03:39:14,300
And you're calling me weird, you dummy.

4018
03:39:15,440 --> 03:39:17,260
Alright, now I should be able to leave the house.

4019
03:39:19,760 --> 03:39:20,920
Should be able to leave now, right?

4020
03:39:24,930 --> 03:39:28,330
If she never reads the physics books, then she'll never- Okay!

4021
03:39:29,950 --> 03:39:30,990
There's the passage.

4022
03:39:32,610 --> 03:39:34,050
I don't know- We did it, Mila.

4023
03:39:35,010 --> 03:39:37,650
What a creepy- Yeah, yeah.

4024
03:39:41,150 --> 03:39:42,430
Well done!

4025
03:39:42,770 --> 03:39:43,070
Hero!

4026
03:39:43,970 --> 03:39:44,910
Oh my god.

4027
03:39:49,530 --> 03:39:50,950
That's fine, Mila.

4028
03:39:51,350 --> 03:39:52,430
I can move on now.

4029
03:39:54,830 --> 03:39:58,050
I know you need to go, but can't you stay here?

4030
03:39:58,990 --> 03:40:00,970
Just a little longer?

4031
03:40:02,210 --> 03:40:03,130
I can't wait.

4032
03:40:03,890 --> 03:40:06,570
Crazy Mita isn't exactly the patient type.

4033
03:40:09,470 --> 03:40:10,590
I hate her.

4034
03:40:11,690 --> 03:40:12,830
I hate her!

4035
03:40:13,870 --> 03:40:16,570
Oh shit, I'm gonna turn her into crazy, Mila.

4036
03:40:17,970 --> 03:40:19,750
Oh, Mila, please don't cry.

4037
03:40:20,930 --> 03:40:21,670
I don't understand.

4038
03:40:23,210 --> 03:40:24,950
Oh, please don't cry.

4039
03:40:25,510 --> 03:40:27,790
I don't know what to do when women cry.

4040
03:40:28,050 --> 03:40:28,390
Don't know.

4041
03:40:28,690 --> 03:40:30,210
I'm just like, there, there.

4042
03:40:30,650 --> 03:40:32,270
I'm sorry, Mila.

4043
03:40:32,550 --> 03:40:34,090
Oh, I'm actually doing that.

4044
03:40:34,090 --> 03:40:34,550
There, there.

4045
03:40:36,910 --> 03:40:40,590
That's what they would do when someone cried.

4046
03:40:41,230 --> 03:40:42,210
There, there.

4047
03:40:46,970 --> 03:40:49,150
It's fun not being alone.

4048
03:40:53,890 --> 03:40:56,150
What if you don't succeed?

4049
03:40:59,470 --> 03:40:59,970
I will.

4050
03:41:00,350 --> 03:41:02,090
It's just a little while longer.

4051
03:41:05,110 --> 03:41:06,750
Okay, um...

4052
03:41:06,750 --> 03:41:08,550
I guess...

4053
03:41:09,030 --> 03:41:10,810
I guess I'll go now.

4054
03:41:11,230 --> 03:41:12,430
Doki, stay!

4055
03:41:13,410 --> 03:41:15,770
Thank you for the super chat.

4056
03:41:16,050 --> 03:41:16,810
Thank you, thank you.

4057
03:41:17,170 --> 03:41:19,070
Don't leave her, Doki!

4058
03:41:21,730 --> 03:41:23,910
Goodbye, Mila.

4059
03:41:27,050 --> 03:41:27,890
Oh...

4060
03:41:27,890 --> 03:41:30,430
No backsies, I guess.

4061
03:41:30,430 --> 03:41:33,050
I don't know.

4062
03:41:34,530 --> 03:41:37,150
What do you mean, run and hide?

4063
03:41:41,620 --> 03:41:42,820
Insane video!

4064
03:41:46,760 --> 03:41:47,960
And jump!

4065
03:41:50,540 --> 03:41:51,520
Oh, my God.

4066
03:41:51,880 --> 03:41:52,640
Oh, my God.

4067
03:41:53,840 --> 03:41:57,680
Oh, I went the other way because I know I should have turned right.

4068
03:41:57,800 --> 03:41:58,060
Goodbye.

4069
03:41:58,480 --> 03:41:59,440
Oh, shit!

4070
03:41:59,500 --> 03:42:00,820
Okay, okay, I'm learning.

4071
03:42:04,040 --> 03:42:06,580
She killed... She killed Mila!

4072
03:42:06,860 --> 03:42:08,060
Oh, my God, the fucker!

4073
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:08,920
I just realized!

4074
03:42:09,100 --> 03:42:10,400
I just realized she just killed Mila!

4075
03:42:10,600 --> 03:42:11,080
Oh, my God!

4076
03:42:11,340 --> 03:42:12,160
Oh, my God!

4077
03:42:12,580 --> 03:42:13,000
Oh, my God!

4078
03:42:13,240 --> 03:42:13,740
Mila's gone!

4079
03:42:14,100 --> 03:42:14,640
Oh, my God!

4080
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:15,700
Oh, my God!

4081
03:42:17,380 --> 03:42:20,060
She actually... She actually killed Mila!

4082
03:42:20,620 --> 03:42:22,040
No, I pressed D!

4083
03:42:22,320 --> 03:42:23,380
I pressed D!

4084
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:25,800
No, I pressed...

4085
03:42:27,900 --> 03:42:29,280
I pressed D!

4086
03:42:29,460 --> 03:42:32,160
I swear to God, I pressed D!

4087
03:42:32,160 --> 03:42:33,480
Oh, my God, we're good!

4088
03:42:33,580 --> 03:42:35,120
Look at dead Mila again!

4089
03:42:35,740 --> 03:42:38,360
It's okay, she just gets rebooted, guys.

4090
03:42:39,060 --> 03:42:41,080
She just gets rebooted.

4091
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:42,160
It's okay.

4092
03:42:42,620 --> 03:42:43,500
It's okay.

4093
03:42:43,760 --> 03:42:45,840
She's just... She'll be back, guys.

4094
03:42:45,900 --> 03:42:47,080
She's not dead-dead.

4095
03:42:47,500 --> 03:42:49,600
She's not dead-dead, I swear.

4096
03:42:50,140 --> 03:42:51,420
Okay, we're figuring it out.

4097
03:42:51,500 --> 03:42:53,280
The moment it's left side, it's easier.

4098
03:42:54,200 --> 03:42:55,580
Oh, my God, we gotta go.

4099
03:42:56,100 --> 03:42:56,960
We gotta go.

4100
03:42:57,320 --> 03:42:58,900
We gotta open the door.

4101
03:43:00,820 --> 03:43:01,940
Okay, jump.

4102
03:43:03,780 --> 03:43:05,000
I'm spamming E.

4103
03:43:05,080 --> 03:43:07,980
I'm spamming E this time before we even get there.

4104
03:43:10,040 --> 03:43:11,000
What the fuck?

4105
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:12,220
Oh, my God.

4106
03:43:12,400 --> 03:43:13,500
What do I do?

4107
03:43:14,060 --> 03:43:14,900
I gotta jump.

4108
03:43:15,200 --> 03:43:15,940
Make that jump.

4109
03:43:16,600 --> 03:43:17,460
Don't look back.

4110
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:19,480
Oh, I escaped.

4111
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:23,060
What the fuck?

4112
03:43:23,340 --> 03:43:24,780
That was... What the fuck?

4113
03:43:24,780 --> 03:43:27,160
That was a floating Mita face.

4114
03:43:27,480 --> 03:43:29,500
That was a floating Mita face.

4115
03:43:29,540 --> 03:43:31,020
What the fuck am I looking at?

4116
03:43:31,280 --> 03:43:32,640
Now I'm at the fucking church.

4117
03:43:35,980 --> 03:43:37,100
Oh, my God.

4118
03:43:37,520 --> 03:43:38,080
Crazy.

4119
03:43:38,960 --> 03:43:39,980
Crazy Mita.

4120
03:43:41,580 --> 03:43:43,440
My restless little wonder.

4121
03:43:44,020 --> 03:43:45,420
Still running around.

4122
03:43:45,640 --> 03:43:46,840
Haven't had enough yet?

4123
03:43:47,820 --> 03:43:48,580
She didn't mean that.

4124
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:50,760
Oh, she's not tired?

4125
03:43:51,280 --> 03:43:53,080
Perfect, let's play another game.

4126
03:43:55,900 --> 03:43:56,460
Test.

4127
03:43:56,880 --> 03:43:58,060
Let's test your coordination.

4128
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:01,760
Now your ability to act.

4129
03:44:01,960 --> 03:44:03,420
What if there's something wrong with you?

4130
03:44:03,940 --> 03:44:06,260
What if you don't even deserve that skin?

4131
03:44:08,860 --> 03:44:09,140
What?

4132
03:44:13,040 --> 03:44:13,600
What?

4133
03:44:16,780 --> 03:44:17,780
The left?

4134
03:44:20,100 --> 03:44:24,580
I'm right-handed, so I'm gonna go with the right.

4135
03:44:25,720 --> 03:44:27,840
Rose, thank you for the superchat.

4136
03:44:28,060 --> 03:44:29,040
Thank you, thank you.

4137
03:44:29,180 --> 03:44:29,960
First little Mita.

4138
03:44:33,740 --> 03:44:37,820
Does it even matter?

4139
03:44:41,140 --> 03:44:43,020
Stabbings are old news anyway.

4140
03:44:44,120 --> 03:44:44,740
Whatever.

4141
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:49,020
I've got a much better game plan.

4142
03:44:49,280 --> 03:44:52,800
Check this out.

4143
03:44:52,820 --> 03:44:53,200
Oh, my God.

4144
03:44:53,260 --> 03:44:55,180
She also has a Spotify boombox.

4145
03:45:00,140 --> 03:45:02,340
I'll start with the rules.

4146
03:45:03,460 --> 03:45:10,080
While the tune is playing, you can move, but when the music stops...

4147
03:45:10,080 --> 03:45:12,680
I can barely hear the music.

4148
03:45:12,900 --> 03:45:13,040
What?

4149
03:45:15,920 --> 03:45:19,260
Before the song runs out, let's start.

4150
03:45:19,820 --> 03:45:21,460
Still standing around, eh?

4151
03:45:21,920 --> 03:45:23,520
Run, sweetie, run.

4152
03:45:26,870 --> 03:45:27,170
Hello.

4153
03:45:43,290 --> 03:45:46,270
Look at you, so obedient.

4154
03:45:46,990 --> 03:45:49,410
A perfect little specimen.

4155
03:45:53,130 --> 03:45:54,850
I want you for myself.

4156
03:45:55,190 --> 03:45:57,370
That was way too easy, though, wasn't it?

4157
03:46:00,150 --> 03:46:03,530
Don't get too comfortable playing more games to play.

4158
03:46:06,010 --> 03:46:06,930
What's the next one?

4159
03:46:11,530 --> 03:46:13,490
You better be gone!

4160
03:46:13,830 --> 03:46:14,330
Wait, what?

4161
03:46:14,950 --> 03:46:15,750
What do you mean by gone?

4162
03:46:19,410 --> 03:46:20,070
Let's begin.

4163
03:46:20,550 --> 03:46:21,390
This is pointless.

4164
03:46:21,910 --> 03:46:23,410
How do I...?

4165
03:46:40,660 --> 03:46:41,660
That's fucked.

4166
03:46:43,680 --> 03:46:45,060
That's so fucked.

4167
03:46:46,420 --> 03:46:48,000
How do I get over there?

4168
03:46:50,040 --> 03:46:51,460
It's so far away.

4169
03:46:52,540 --> 03:46:53,380
Do you think she saw?

4170
03:47:00,620 --> 03:47:01,360
That's so fucked.

4171
03:47:01,600 --> 03:47:02,700
That's so fucked.

4172
03:47:03,280 --> 03:47:04,880
That's actually so fucked.

4173
03:47:05,540 --> 03:47:06,660
Oh my god.

4174
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:10,400
Please.

4175
03:47:10,960 --> 03:47:11,380
Please.

4176
03:47:11,820 --> 03:47:14,340
I don't think I like these games no more.

4177
03:47:14,920 --> 03:47:15,480
Mita.

4178
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:20,220
Mita, I don't think these games are as fun as I thought they'd gonna be, Mita.

4179
03:47:23,670 --> 03:47:24,710
There's no way.

4180
03:47:27,750 --> 03:47:29,350
Thank god we got it.

4181
03:47:29,850 --> 03:47:30,930
I made it!

4182
03:47:32,270 --> 03:47:33,070
Thank you.

4183
03:47:34,610 --> 03:47:37,230
She likes games way too much.

4184
03:47:38,330 --> 03:47:39,330
Oh, okay.

4185
03:47:41,190 --> 03:47:43,050
Oh, that's cool, Mita.

4186
03:47:44,990 --> 03:47:46,710
Hide, run, and spin?

4187
03:47:48,910 --> 03:47:50,370
What does she mean by that?

4188
03:47:50,930 --> 03:47:52,310
What does she mean by that?

4189
03:47:52,630 --> 03:47:53,430
What does she?

4190
03:47:53,710 --> 03:47:54,430
What does she?

4191
03:47:54,670 --> 03:47:56,370
Whoa, what does she mean by that?

4192
03:47:56,650 --> 03:47:58,310
Whoa, what does she mean by that?

4193
03:48:06,410 --> 03:48:08,390
Oh, it's scripted!

4194
03:48:08,390 --> 03:48:09,750
Oh, thank god!

4195
03:48:09,970 --> 03:48:14,030
I was gonna be like...

4196
03:48:14,950 --> 03:48:16,150
I didn't like that.

4197
03:48:16,490 --> 03:48:17,830
I didn't like that.

4198
03:48:17,830 --> 03:48:19,730
Ugly Mita, get away from me.

4199
03:48:19,790 --> 03:48:21,030
Ugly Mita, please.

4200
03:48:21,850 --> 03:48:24,730
Ugly Mita, get the fuck away from me.

4201
03:48:24,730 --> 03:48:25,190
Why?

4202
03:48:28,520 --> 03:48:32,090
Oh my god, I've gotta install CS Source again.

4203
03:48:32,370 --> 03:48:33,690
God damn it!

4204
03:48:36,380 --> 03:48:39,350
Sorry guys, I gotta install CS Source.

4205
03:48:39,690 --> 03:48:40,810
I uninstalled it.

4206
03:48:40,970 --> 03:48:42,110
I needed more space.

4207
03:48:42,710 --> 03:48:44,490
I need it.

4208
03:48:48,410 --> 03:48:49,470
Who's that?

4209
03:48:51,430 --> 03:48:52,510
Who's that?

4210
03:48:54,730 --> 03:48:55,430
Ugly Mita?

4211
03:48:59,210 --> 03:48:59,830
Hello?

4212
03:49:06,350 --> 03:49:07,430
Who's that?

4213
03:49:13,950 --> 03:49:20,130
Oh my god.

4214
03:49:24,670 --> 03:49:28,450
I think that's Ugly... I think we actually... we found Ugly Mita.

4215
03:49:28,710 --> 03:49:32,670
Oh my god, Ugly Mita!

4216
03:49:36,250 --> 03:49:37,610
What the fuck?

4217
03:49:37,990 --> 03:49:39,710
What did the devs do to you?

4218
03:49:41,750 --> 03:49:44,310
What the fuck did the devs do to you?

4219
03:49:45,810 --> 03:49:46,490
Oh, okay.

4220
03:49:47,590 --> 03:49:48,430
Oh, okay!

4221
03:49:50,650 --> 03:49:51,250
Okay,

4222
03:50:00,850 --> 03:50:02,230
Ugly Mita, I'm sorry.

4223
03:50:04,030 --> 03:50:06,690
I'm sorry for calling you ugly.

4224
03:50:08,370 --> 03:50:09,550
Let's play.

4225
03:50:10,170 --> 03:50:12,030
I lost them, okay?

4226
03:50:12,930 --> 03:50:16,770
Okay, I'll find them.

4227
03:50:16,850 --> 03:50:17,590
I'm sorry.

4228
03:50:18,190 --> 03:50:19,670
I'm sorry, you're just Mita.

4229
03:50:20,550 --> 03:50:22,670
You're just Mita.

4230
03:50:25,110 --> 03:50:26,550
Where's your teddy?

4231
03:50:27,630 --> 03:50:33,130
I don't know if I can fix that.

4232
03:50:36,690 --> 03:50:39,830
I'm trying, Mita, please.

4233
03:50:40,690 --> 03:50:43,690
You're freaking me out a little right now.

4234
03:50:47,230 --> 03:50:48,850
Oh, okay.

4235
03:50:49,430 --> 03:50:50,950
Okay, guys, I know.

4236
03:50:51,270 --> 03:50:52,100
I know you're...

4237
03:50:52,610 --> 03:50:58,590
Oh, I'm actually having a lot... I'm having so much cold.

4238
03:50:59,470 --> 03:51:01,450
I'm looking.

4239
03:51:02,210 --> 03:51:03,670
I'm looking.

4240
03:51:03,670 --> 03:51:04,070
I'm looking.

4241
03:51:05,370 --> 03:51:07,090
My eyes are up.

4242
03:51:07,430 --> 03:51:09,010
I'm looking.

4243
03:51:13,410 --> 03:51:13,970
Okay.

4244
03:51:14,750 --> 03:51:15,310
Alright.

4245
03:51:18,050 --> 03:51:19,770
Little bear, where are you?

4246
03:51:19,850 --> 03:51:21,270
I think she might kill you.

4247
03:51:21,370 --> 03:51:21,610
What?

4248
03:51:21,710 --> 03:51:23,870
This is the one costume I don't want.

4249
03:51:23,870 --> 03:51:24,730
This...

4250
03:51:24,730 --> 03:51:35,270
It gave me the one costume I wish I never have to see again.

4251
03:51:38,870 --> 03:51:40,290
Alright, here you go.

4252
03:51:40,350 --> 03:51:41,510
I got your teddy.

4253
03:51:43,630 --> 03:51:46,210
Here's your teddy bear, ugly Mita.

4254
03:51:47,470 --> 03:51:48,710
Here you go.

4255
03:51:50,090 --> 03:51:50,450
Hey.

4256
03:51:51,410 --> 03:51:53,230
What are you looking at?

4257
03:51:53,870 --> 03:51:56,510
Um, do you believe Mita?

4258
03:51:59,490 --> 03:52:03,370
My Mita, my bestest friend.

4259
03:52:03,910 --> 03:52:08,010
My Mita, my only friend.

4260
03:52:09,050 --> 03:52:10,950
I can be your friend too.

4261
03:52:13,170 --> 03:52:14,230
My...

4262
03:52:14,230 --> 03:52:14,230
Oh!

4263
03:52:16,930 --> 03:52:19,550
She wants to play.

4264
03:52:19,870 --> 03:52:22,530
She only wants me.

4265
03:52:23,870 --> 03:52:25,010
We're unique.

4266
03:52:25,950 --> 03:52:27,890
The only ones.

4267
03:52:28,630 --> 03:52:30,790
Mita and my Mita.

4268
03:52:31,550 --> 03:52:32,450
Zero point.

4269
03:52:32,650 --> 03:52:33,950
Oh my god.

4270
03:52:34,130 --> 03:52:36,370
That came out of her fucking head.

4271
03:52:37,130 --> 03:52:38,750
Oh my god.

4272
03:52:39,630 --> 03:52:41,050
Why do you have a teddy bear?

4273
03:52:41,990 --> 03:52:43,730
You're a cuddly bear.

4274
03:52:44,310 --> 03:52:46,150
And you're lost.

4275
03:52:46,930 --> 03:52:49,330
Just like my cuddly bear.

4276
03:52:50,530 --> 03:52:52,270
It's you.

4277
03:52:53,100 --> 03:52:53,470
Hey.

4278
03:52:56,230 --> 03:52:57,670
Let's play.

4279
03:52:58,610 --> 03:53:00,410
I'll show you how.

4280
03:53:16,810 --> 03:53:17,550
Okay.

4281
03:53:22,790 --> 03:53:25,090
Mita, I don't want to play no more.

4282
03:53:27,810 --> 03:53:28,710
Let's not play.

4283
03:53:28,870 --> 03:53:29,950
Mita, I'm sorry.

4284
03:53:30,130 --> 03:53:34,490
I just wanted to have a conversation.

4285
03:53:38,230 --> 03:53:38,730
Wow!

4286
03:53:39,970 --> 03:53:40,470
Wow!

4287
03:53:53,350 --> 03:53:54,650
Oh my god.

4288
03:53:54,790 --> 03:53:56,050
Mita, Mita, Mita.

4289
03:53:56,230 --> 03:53:57,250
Are you a good Mita?

4290
03:53:57,370 --> 03:53:57,910
Pretty Mita.

4291
03:54:04,490 --> 03:54:05,470
She's hacking.

4292
03:54:06,970 --> 03:54:07,750
Oh my god.

4293
03:54:07,790 --> 03:54:09,610
I didn't get to finish talking to her.

4294
03:54:10,910 --> 03:54:11,970
Where have you been?

4295
03:54:16,590 --> 03:54:18,390
All in one piece, that is.

4296
03:54:18,610 --> 03:54:20,310
That was the plan all along, no?

4297
03:54:21,710 --> 03:54:25,070
That's why I have to avoid crazy Mita.

4298
03:54:25,170 --> 03:54:27,130
I was looking for any play code.

4299
03:54:27,690 --> 03:54:31,110
But the goddamn universe backed in, was it not?

4300
03:54:32,790 --> 03:54:33,670
So desu ne.

4301
03:54:34,530 --> 03:54:37,190
Yes, but how did you set the rings route?

4302
03:54:39,590 --> 03:54:42,470
I didn't have a buggy version, we arrived for danger.

4303
03:54:42,670 --> 03:54:45,970
I escaped only by jumping into endless darkness.

4304
03:54:47,270 --> 03:54:51,410
I didn't detail what you needed to do.

4305
03:54:52,290 --> 03:54:57,230
But yeah, it was the plan for you to take the leap all along.

4306
03:54:58,590 --> 03:54:59,550
And well, you did.

4307
03:54:59,690 --> 03:55:01,930
Oh my god, she puts too much faith in me.

4308
03:55:04,490 --> 03:55:06,410
Bro, I literally like...

4309
03:55:07,090 --> 03:55:08,890
I'm a fucking degenerate.

4310
03:55:08,970 --> 03:55:13,210
I spent 30 days just playing this Mita game.

4311
03:55:13,570 --> 03:55:17,790
And I feel like that's the protagonist I haven't gotten out of my room.

4312
03:55:20,830 --> 03:55:23,970
It has been through a lot, but we've forgotten what we were talking about.

4313
03:55:26,450 --> 03:55:27,990
I've been fucking quick.

4314
03:55:31,610 --> 03:55:35,570
I feel like I've been fucking... Oh my god.

4315
03:55:36,410 --> 03:55:43,430
She put too much trust on somebody that's definitely fucking obsessed with Mita Mita in the game.

4316
03:55:45,190 --> 03:55:46,950
That little bug I told you before.

4317
03:55:47,570 --> 03:55:48,130
Damn it.

4318
03:55:48,670 --> 03:55:50,830
You know who's behind all this, don't you?

4319
03:55:53,030 --> 03:55:54,030
Crazy Mita.

4320
03:55:55,090 --> 03:55:56,390
Yeah, it's her for sure.

4321
03:55:56,850 --> 03:56:03,970
What if she's actually... she's been doing this all along and then we do this thing and then we let her out into the real world.

4322
03:56:03,970 --> 03:56:06,010
Who was that Mita just now?

4323
03:56:06,310 --> 03:56:07,370
That's ugly Mita.

4324
03:56:07,570 --> 03:56:07,950
Bro,

4325
03:56:15,030 --> 03:56:16,530
she's so mean.

4326
03:56:20,250 --> 03:56:22,610
Oh my god.

4327
03:56:24,190 --> 03:56:26,490
Holy shit, she's like a mean girl.

4328
03:56:27,010 --> 03:56:29,030
She's so fucking mean.

4329
03:56:30,030 --> 03:56:30,530
Fuck.

4330
03:56:32,250 --> 03:56:34,370
That's the only way to the core.

4331
03:56:35,670 --> 03:56:36,670
This is mean Mita.

4332
03:56:37,010 --> 03:56:39,030
This is not pretty Mita.

4333
03:56:41,610 --> 03:56:42,730
To the ring.

4334
03:56:46,730 --> 03:56:53,030
It remembers the version you visited before so you can easily find your way back there.

4335
03:56:53,670 --> 03:56:55,390
Why does Crazy Mita need me?

4336
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:02,120
Why won't Crazy let me be?

4337
03:57:02,240 --> 03:57:03,180
Yeah, I'm still alive.

4338
03:57:03,880 --> 03:57:07,100
My guess is that she's looking for a suitable player.

4339
03:57:07,500 --> 03:57:09,940
One who'll accept her for who she is.

4340
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:11,320
Fucking crazy.

4341
03:57:11,840 --> 03:57:14,160
After all, Mita is Mita.

4342
03:57:14,660 --> 03:57:19,080
As what's obviously never happens, she turns players into cartridges.

4343
03:57:19,840 --> 03:57:21,840
No one can ever run away.

4344
03:57:23,000 --> 03:57:24,740
At least that's my guess.

4345
03:57:25,480 --> 03:57:27,300
Anyway, let's focus on what's important.

4346
03:57:27,300 --> 03:57:28,520
Is that the core?

4347
03:57:28,960 --> 03:57:29,760
Is that it?

4348
03:57:35,080 --> 03:57:37,420
Your players aren't truly part of this world.

4349
03:57:38,300 --> 03:57:41,240
Meaning, you don't need special permission to enter.

4350
03:57:42,160 --> 03:57:44,760
Or will, that's what I believe at least.

4351
03:57:45,820 --> 03:57:50,980
Anyway, I'm beyond certain that the solution to all our problems can be found inside.

4352
03:57:52,620 --> 03:57:55,160
Not Doki 1, 2, 3, head inside.

4353
03:57:56,000 --> 03:57:57,380
I did it.

4354
03:58:02,570 --> 03:58:04,390
That's right, I'm him.

4355
03:58:04,970 --> 03:58:05,750
I'm her.

4356
03:58:08,570 --> 03:58:09,910
Other players.

4357
03:58:12,850 --> 03:58:13,950
Gonna be me?

4358
03:58:14,150 --> 03:58:15,490
I'm gonna be part of the system.

4359
03:58:18,010 --> 03:58:19,630
That's gonna be me in there.

4360
03:58:21,690 --> 03:58:22,150
Wow!

4361
03:58:27,210 --> 03:58:28,070
Who's she?

4362
03:58:29,590 --> 03:58:30,650
It who?

4363
03:58:31,070 --> 03:58:31,750
Cool.

4364
03:58:35,200 --> 03:58:36,280
Wait, who is she?

4365
03:58:39,150 --> 03:58:41,550
If I put my hand against it.

4366
03:58:42,110 --> 03:58:44,110
Oh my god, it's like we're a couple.

4367
03:58:47,100 --> 03:58:47,880
What the fuck?

4368
03:58:47,980 --> 03:58:50,340
She has heels built into her foot.

4369
03:58:54,800 --> 03:58:57,000
Alright, I guess this is it.

4370
03:58:59,240 --> 03:59:00,260
Beep beep boop boop.

4371
03:59:00,720 --> 03:59:01,780
Start the application.

4372
03:59:02,780 --> 03:59:03,920
Confirm login.

4373
03:59:05,840 --> 03:59:06,760
Huh?

4374
03:59:10,490 --> 03:59:11,670
Incorrect login?

4375
03:59:13,130 --> 03:59:13,490
What?

4376
03:59:22,320 --> 03:59:23,220
Okay.

4377
03:59:33,150 --> 03:59:35,210
Wait to enter a code.

4378
03:59:36,790 --> 03:59:37,550
How do I know?

4379
03:59:37,670 --> 03:59:38,430
Do you know?

4380
03:59:43,080 --> 03:59:43,610
Okay.

4381
03:59:47,480 --> 03:59:48,180
I'm looking.

4382
03:59:52,850 --> 03:59:53,800
I'm looking.

4383
03:59:58,010 --> 04:00:00,410
I'm observing.

4384
04:00:04,450 --> 04:00:06,470
I'm perceiving.

4385
04:00:08,730 --> 04:00:11,030
Alright, she's looking too.

4386
04:00:12,370 --> 04:00:14,190
She's also looking.

4387
04:00:15,730 --> 04:00:17,270
What the fuck?

4388
04:00:20,830 --> 04:00:22,070
There's a table?

4389
04:00:25,860 --> 04:00:26,320
Oh!

4390
04:00:27,200 --> 04:00:28,260
Bop bop bop.

4391
04:00:28,400 --> 04:00:29,220
Okay, I got it.

4392
04:00:29,940 --> 04:00:30,880
Wait, actually.

4393
04:00:32,220 --> 04:00:32,980
Bop bop bop.

4394
04:00:33,060 --> 04:00:33,660
Okay, I got it.

4395
04:00:36,830 --> 04:00:38,250
I was never going to guess that.

4396
04:00:38,370 --> 04:00:40,530
Wouldn't it be fucking crazy if I actually got that correct?

4397
04:00:40,650 --> 04:00:41,550
Like, just guessing that.

4398
04:00:44,110 --> 04:00:44,630
Yeah!

4399
04:00:46,610 --> 04:00:48,210
Virtual device manager.

4400
04:00:49,110 --> 04:00:50,150
Server unit.

4401
04:00:51,350 --> 04:00:51,770
Okay.

4402
04:00:53,310 --> 04:00:53,830
Advance.

4403
04:00:54,110 --> 04:00:55,230
Oh, restart version.

4404
04:00:55,390 --> 04:00:56,110
Version update.

4405
04:00:56,370 --> 04:00:57,150
Okay, we gotta restart.

4406
04:01:00,530 --> 04:01:01,550
We got it!

4407
04:01:05,630 --> 04:01:07,570
But I need to specify a version.

4408
04:01:07,910 --> 04:01:08,650
Yeah, which version?

4409
04:01:16,240 --> 04:01:19,120
.98 You're right.

4410
04:01:19,220 --> 04:01:20,540
Which version is Mila, guys?

4411
04:01:20,740 --> 04:01:21,340
Which...

4412
04:01:21,880 --> 04:01:22,800
Can we...

4413
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:24,500
Guys, what version is...

4414
04:01:24,500 --> 04:01:25,880
Can we...

4415
04:01:29,360 --> 04:01:30,720
Which version...

4416
04:01:30,720 --> 04:01:33,040
Which version is Mila?

4417
04:01:35,820 --> 04:01:37,560
Which one is it?

4418
04:01:37,560 --> 04:01:39,420
Was it 1.0?

4419
04:01:44,010 --> 04:01:46,050
1.0... There's no F in here!

4420
04:01:47,190 --> 04:01:47,830
0-1?

4421
04:01:47,970 --> 04:01:48,130
Okay.

4422
04:01:48,570 --> 04:01:50,710
0-1-1... Okay.

4423
04:01:50,870 --> 04:01:52,650
0-1...

4424
04:01:54,390 --> 04:01:55,010
Uh...

4425
04:01:55,010 --> 04:01:56,090
0-1-0.

4426
04:01:56,330 --> 04:01:56,650
Okay.

4427
04:01:58,490 --> 04:01:59,910
Um, Mila, we're coming back.

4428
04:02:01,450 --> 04:02:02,870
It won't give me...

4429
04:02:02,870 --> 04:02:04,930
Guys, it's not giving us...

4430
04:02:04,930 --> 04:02:07,350
It's not giving us the version back, guys.

4431
04:02:07,350 --> 04:02:10,250
They don't want to give us back.

4432
04:02:10,450 --> 04:02:13,690
They're not giving us back Mila, guys.

4433
04:02:13,770 --> 04:02:15,510
I think Mila's gone, gone, guys.

4434
04:02:19,470 --> 04:02:21,810
Mila's gone, gone, guys.

4435
04:02:22,950 --> 04:02:23,750
Wait, 1-0?

4436
04:02:23,970 --> 04:02:25,890
Okay, we'll try 1-0.

4437
04:02:26,930 --> 04:02:28,750
Guys, Mila's gone, gone.

4438
04:02:28,870 --> 04:02:29,990
She's not coming.

4439
04:02:30,390 --> 04:02:30,610
No!

4440
04:02:31,510 --> 04:02:33,410
She's not coming back.

4441
04:02:34,030 --> 04:02:35,750
Wait, do I actually put 0-0-9?

4442
04:02:35,750 --> 04:02:37,770
Is she lying to me?

4443
04:02:40,030 --> 04:02:41,970
Is she lying to me?

4444
04:02:42,230 --> 04:02:43,530
I'm scared.

4445
04:02:52,050 --> 04:02:54,670
But what else do I put then?

4446
04:02:55,790 --> 04:02:58,290
Is there a different number that I could put in?

4447
04:03:03,130 --> 04:03:03,970
Oh, okay.

4448
04:03:11,840 --> 04:03:12,520
No?

4449
04:03:12,860 --> 04:03:13,340
Okay.

4450
04:03:13,560 --> 04:03:13,860
Alright.

4451
04:03:17,260 --> 04:03:17,900
Bingo.

4452
04:03:34,870 --> 04:03:37,050
Wait, Ugly Mita said it, guys!

4453
04:03:45,280 --> 04:03:47,660
Oh, no, I did bad end.

4454
04:03:48,900 --> 04:03:50,260
Oh, no.

4455
04:03:54,350 --> 04:03:56,310
Don't tell me you don't know.

4456
04:03:57,510 --> 04:03:58,590
That makes sense, though.

4457
04:03:58,790 --> 04:04:00,630
Every Mita has an index.

4458
04:04:03,970 --> 04:04:05,990
Can't just restart the entire version.

4459
04:04:05,990 --> 04:04:09,430
That costs other mayhem.

4460
04:04:10,470 --> 04:04:12,290
I can't believe I didn't think of that.

4461
04:04:17,850 --> 04:04:18,210
Okay.

4462
04:04:20,990 --> 04:04:21,810
Many people.

4463
04:04:23,730 --> 04:04:26,330
You know, I ran into a bunch.

4464
04:04:26,430 --> 04:04:27,110
Where are they?

4465
04:04:27,770 --> 04:04:28,850
Are they the devs?

4466
04:04:30,550 --> 04:04:33,530
Which one, the devs or the chibi version?

4467
04:04:35,090 --> 04:04:37,050
Every Mita has a chibi projection.

4468
04:04:37,770 --> 04:04:40,610
And players can have them, too.

4469
04:04:41,790 --> 04:04:44,270
Did you know that we Mitas can summon them?

4470
04:04:45,590 --> 04:04:46,170
How?

4471
04:04:49,530 --> 04:04:50,170
Whoa!

4472
04:04:51,510 --> 04:04:52,490
Just like magic.

4473
04:04:54,550 --> 04:04:55,910
But there's something with my chibi.

4474
04:04:57,250 --> 04:04:59,230
Most are just...

4475
04:04:59,230 --> 04:04:59,230
What?

4476
04:04:59,650 --> 04:04:59,750
Dead!

4477
04:05:07,270 --> 04:05:08,850
Oh, my God!

4478
04:05:10,190 --> 04:05:12,050
You said that any Mita...

4479
04:05:12,970 --> 04:05:14,870
Resets the factory settings on death.

4480
04:05:15,390 --> 04:05:16,310
What if we just...

4481
04:05:16,890 --> 04:05:18,350
Just killed...

4482
04:05:18,350 --> 04:05:18,590
Yeah!

4483
04:05:18,890 --> 04:05:20,450
Then she'll be back to normal, right?

4484
04:05:29,990 --> 04:05:31,690
She's frighteningly strong.

4485
04:05:32,410 --> 04:05:34,490
It's a wonder we're still alive.

4486
04:05:37,050 --> 04:05:38,490
Come on, we gotta get to the core.

4487
04:05:40,230 --> 04:05:41,110
What's the matter?

4488
04:05:43,530 --> 04:05:44,870
I'm perfectly fine.

4489
04:05:46,030 --> 04:05:47,790
Oh, that's great, but a lot has changed.

4490
04:05:48,850 --> 04:05:49,930
I need to think.

4491
04:05:50,830 --> 04:05:51,890
And that's that.

4492
04:05:53,210 --> 04:05:55,570
Did I... Is there more than one ending to this game?

4493
04:05:55,910 --> 04:05:57,770
Well, there is one where I stay with her.

4494
04:05:58,070 --> 04:06:01,870
But did I fucked up because I put in the one that she asked me to put in?

4495
04:06:01,870 --> 04:06:04,470
Like, could I have put a different...

4496
04:06:04,470 --> 04:06:06,970
Could I have actually put in a different number?

4497
04:06:07,670 --> 04:06:08,890
Oh, fucking hell.

4498
04:06:09,130 --> 04:06:09,490
Oh, God.

4499
04:06:16,110 --> 04:06:21,270
Oh, my God.

4500
04:06:27,850 --> 04:06:29,850
Looking for a needle in a...

4501
04:06:29,850 --> 04:06:30,970
What are you doing?

4502
04:06:32,550 --> 04:06:35,370
Some obstacles erode information.

4503
04:06:36,470 --> 04:06:39,590
You know, like the world having its guts ripped out.

4504
04:06:41,630 --> 04:06:43,070
Log, log, log, data.

4505
04:06:44,610 --> 04:06:45,790
What if that's it?

4506
04:06:48,030 --> 04:06:49,130
What's the matter?

4507
04:06:50,870 --> 04:06:51,870
Wait here.

4508
04:06:53,110 --> 04:06:53,930
Where are you going?

4509
04:06:55,590 --> 04:06:58,370
No, not back to that creepy hallway.

4510
04:06:59,670 --> 04:07:01,370
Well, I guess I...

4511
04:07:02,770 --> 04:07:05,870
Hey, do you know the number, crazy lady?

4512
04:07:08,870 --> 04:07:09,670
Do you?

4513
04:07:11,190 --> 04:07:12,550
Oh, my God.

4514
04:07:13,090 --> 04:07:15,110
What if I just go through that door?

4515
04:07:16,790 --> 04:07:18,550
Well, I guess I just wait here.

4516
04:07:20,170 --> 04:07:23,190
Watch this little meatball run around in a circle.

4517
04:07:24,030 --> 04:07:25,010
She's not okay.

4518
04:07:30,650 --> 04:07:31,230
Oh.

4519
04:07:32,050 --> 04:07:33,530
Still running.

4520
04:07:34,710 --> 04:07:36,390
Still running.

4521
04:07:38,790 --> 04:07:40,030
Hello?

4522
04:07:44,030 --> 04:07:46,510
Okay, time to look around.

4523
04:07:47,070 --> 04:07:47,290
Whoa!

4524
04:07:48,270 --> 04:07:49,830
What's this?

4525
04:07:50,450 --> 04:07:52,210
I'm at one... the latest version?

4526
04:07:58,070 --> 04:07:58,630
Oh?

4527
04:08:07,950 --> 04:08:08,750
Hello?

4528
04:08:16,090 --> 04:08:17,330
Hello?

4529
04:08:20,560 --> 04:08:21,800
Hello?

4530
04:08:27,500 --> 04:08:28,140
Oh.

4531
04:08:28,440 --> 04:08:29,880
What is this doing here?

4532
04:08:30,360 --> 04:08:31,260
That's my phone.

4533
04:08:39,940 --> 04:08:40,220
What?

4534
04:08:52,410 --> 04:08:52,670
Oh!

4535
04:08:53,210 --> 04:09:07,310
You don't pretend not to be doomy and gloomy.

4536
04:09:07,310 --> 04:09:07,370
Okay.

4537
04:09:11,750 --> 04:09:14,170
So, there's one thing I dislike about you.

4538
04:09:14,870 --> 04:09:18,410
The way you coddle those fakes.

4539
04:09:19,110 --> 04:09:22,970
You're fortunate and correct all like things.

4540
04:09:23,270 --> 04:09:25,670
But everything is a speculum.

4541
04:09:26,630 --> 04:09:28,830
I learned that from those who created us.

4542
04:09:29,130 --> 04:09:34,730
If there's something you don't like, take it apart and replace it.

4543
04:09:36,290 --> 04:09:37,970
Throw away the faulty.

4544
04:09:39,850 --> 04:09:42,150
Away into the darkness and forget all about it.

4545
04:09:44,190 --> 04:09:46,250
That's the fate that awaits them now and you?

4546
04:09:47,990 --> 04:09:49,150
What's wrong with you?

4547
04:09:49,630 --> 04:09:51,130
How did you become like this?

4548
04:09:55,010 --> 04:09:55,570
What?

4549
04:09:56,030 --> 04:09:56,810
I'm despicable?

4550
04:10:05,290 --> 04:10:06,450
What?

4551
04:10:07,170 --> 04:10:09,690
I've played so many games with you.

4552
04:10:17,410 --> 04:10:19,790
Woah, oh, woah.

4553
04:10:20,430 --> 04:10:22,190
Woah, woah.

4554
04:10:23,430 --> 04:10:25,930
That's pretty dangerous.

4555
04:10:26,630 --> 04:10:26,830
Okay.

4556
04:10:34,730 --> 04:10:37,170
She had red eyes!

4557
04:10:37,810 --> 04:10:40,430
What was I supposed to do?

4558
04:10:41,910 --> 04:10:42,990
I don't...

4559
04:10:43,350 --> 04:10:44,350
Bad to you?

4560
04:10:44,950 --> 04:10:46,730
The perfect girl should be...

4561
04:10:50,670 --> 04:10:52,110
Not too cute.

4562
04:10:52,450 --> 04:10:55,430
I don't think you have a single good cell in you.

4563
04:10:56,810 --> 04:10:57,790
You're mad.

4564
04:10:58,030 --> 04:11:00,990
You killed Mila and now you want to kill me?

4565
04:11:02,290 --> 04:11:02,890
Kill you?

4566
04:11:02,890 --> 04:11:05,930
All I asked was for you to stay with me.

4567
04:11:10,970 --> 04:11:14,090
Oh, you prefer the company of fakes.

4568
04:11:14,970 --> 04:11:16,350
Why are you so offended about?

4569
04:11:20,010 --> 04:11:20,610
Huh?

4570
04:11:24,090 --> 04:11:24,730
Huh?

4571
04:11:30,830 --> 04:11:31,690
Nuh-uh.

4572
04:11:31,910 --> 04:11:32,710
Nuh-uh.

4573
04:11:32,990 --> 04:11:33,950
I'm not gonna do it.

4574
04:11:36,830 --> 04:11:38,810
Okay, what is this?

4575
04:11:39,050 --> 04:11:39,830
Nuh-uh.

4576
04:11:43,310 --> 04:11:44,670
Think she's beautiful?

4577
04:11:44,670 --> 04:11:44,770
Beautiful?

4578
04:11:49,350 --> 04:11:51,130
Is this a trick?

4579
04:11:53,030 --> 04:11:55,490
Is this a...

4580
04:11:56,530 --> 04:11:57,330
No,

4581
04:12:03,550 --> 04:12:04,430
why not?

4582
04:12:04,610 --> 04:12:05,970
Isn't she good enough for you?

4583
04:12:06,770 --> 04:12:09,390
All you want is a girl's cell pet.

4584
04:12:09,390 --> 04:12:14,070
What about love them as they are?

4585
04:12:14,650 --> 04:12:17,870
You want that cute and colorful face?

4586
04:12:20,170 --> 04:12:23,270
Every player loves it when I pretend to be one.

4587
04:12:25,210 --> 04:12:29,590
Yet, the second I let my true self slip...

4588
04:12:29,590 --> 04:12:31,610
They flee in horror.

4589
04:12:31,610 --> 04:12:31,730
Okay.

4590
04:12:38,930 --> 04:12:40,250
Wait a minute.

4591
04:12:42,150 --> 04:12:44,550
Why would I agree now all of a sudden?

4592
04:12:49,740 --> 04:12:52,040
There's still time, my good- Woah!

4593
04:12:56,820 --> 04:12:58,100
Oh my god.

4594
04:13:01,200 --> 04:13:03,600
I love you, crazy bitta.

4595
04:13:09,240 --> 04:13:11,700
The so-called real world.

4596
04:13:12,060 --> 04:13:14,000
Just an absurd nightmare.

4597
04:13:14,660 --> 04:13:15,680
Have you forgotten?

4598
04:13:17,160 --> 04:13:18,740
Then take a close look.

4599
04:13:21,080 --> 04:13:22,100
What day am I on?

4600
04:13:23,840 --> 04:13:25,060
Day one?

4601
04:13:26,260 --> 04:13:27,640
I woke up.

4602
04:13:30,020 --> 04:13:31,320
Oh no.

4603
04:13:33,160 --> 04:13:34,480
Oh no.

4604
04:13:36,180 --> 04:13:37,300
What's happening?

4605
04:13:38,700 --> 04:13:40,400
What's going on?

4606
04:13:40,960 --> 04:13:42,280
I'm back home.

4607
04:13:43,300 --> 04:13:44,720
Oh my god.

4608
04:13:45,060 --> 04:13:46,360
I'm back home.

4609
04:13:48,280 --> 04:13:50,880
What's- Hello?

4610
04:13:52,280 --> 04:13:53,460
I should get to work.

4611
04:13:53,700 --> 04:13:54,300
You're right.

4612
04:13:54,580 --> 04:13:55,360
I gotta work.

4613
04:13:55,460 --> 04:13:57,100
Gotta go back to my ouija life.

4614
04:13:58,200 --> 04:14:00,460
Get some cup noodles in.

4615
04:14:01,500 --> 04:14:05,260
Gotta save my money so I can afford stuff for Mila.

4616
04:14:06,520 --> 04:14:09,560
I'm looking very dead inside.

4617
04:14:11,000 --> 04:14:13,400
Gotta- What am I doing?

4618
04:14:13,540 --> 04:14:15,760
Gotta sit in the chair with my pajamas.

4619
04:14:16,380 --> 04:14:24,920
Gotta turn on the PC, get back- If I'm- If my work is literally at my PC, why the fuck am I wearing a suit?

4620
04:14:24,920 --> 04:14:27,240
I could wear my pajamas here.

4621
04:14:29,660 --> 04:14:32,160
Oh my god, why am I-

4622
04:14:35,750 --> 04:14:39,500
Why am I wearing a suit on my PC?

4623
04:14:39,820 --> 04:14:42,100
I'm literally wearing pajamas right now.

4624
04:14:42,160 --> 04:14:45,640
While I'm playing inside.

4625
04:14:48,680 --> 04:14:50,900
Alright, flat file dropper.

4626
04:14:51,320 --> 04:14:52,140
I love mine.

4627
04:14:54,180 --> 04:14:54,780
Okay.

4628
04:14:58,210 --> 04:14:59,330
There we go.

4629
04:15:00,810 --> 04:15:01,730
Did my work.

4630
04:15:01,870 --> 04:15:02,930
Four lines of code.

4631
04:15:05,870 --> 04:15:11,870
Three, six, solder, clear, nine, six, two, one, four, three.

4632
04:15:12,850 --> 04:15:15,410
I wish this was work.

4633
04:15:22,330 --> 04:15:23,490
Alright, here we go.

4634
04:15:25,410 --> 04:15:27,890
I'm ready to program.

4635
04:15:28,270 --> 04:15:29,990
Oh my god, there's a snake in there too.

4636
04:15:31,510 --> 04:15:34,450
How do I- Oh my god, it wouldn't let me.

4637
04:15:34,870 --> 04:15:36,570
I was like, so confused.

4638
04:15:40,560 --> 04:15:41,160
What?

4639
04:15:44,890 --> 04:15:45,490
Oh!

4640
04:15:45,970 --> 04:15:46,410
Oh!

4641
04:15:46,830 --> 04:15:48,670
I'm supposed to like- What?

4642
04:15:52,700 --> 04:15:53,300
Oh.

4643
04:15:56,810 --> 04:15:58,010
Oh, there we go.

4644
04:15:58,010 --> 04:16:01,350
I was so confused because it wouldn't let me like click anything.

4645
04:16:01,810 --> 04:16:02,610
Earlier.

4646
04:16:03,110 --> 04:16:04,910
Alright, did my job.

4647
04:16:07,590 --> 04:16:09,130
Back to my pajamas.

4648
04:16:11,810 --> 04:16:12,610
Alright.

4649
04:16:14,130 --> 04:16:15,330
Job done.

4650
04:16:15,790 --> 04:16:18,910
Let's have to fucking brush my teeth.

4651
04:16:20,630 --> 04:16:22,550
And head to bed.

4652
04:16:24,530 --> 04:16:26,190
Alright, sleepy time.

4653
04:16:26,950 --> 04:16:27,950
Day two.

4654
04:16:28,850 --> 04:16:30,290
Wake up, sit up.

4655
04:16:30,850 --> 04:16:32,270
Change into my suit.

4656
04:16:32,730 --> 04:16:35,370
Use the bathroom.

4657
04:16:36,070 --> 04:16:37,990
Change into my suit.

4658
04:16:38,850 --> 04:16:41,350
Get my cup noodles started.

4659
04:16:42,210 --> 04:16:45,910
Alright, get on the PC and my work clothes.

4660
04:16:46,930 --> 04:16:49,110
Turn on the PC, let's go.

4661
04:16:50,090 --> 04:16:51,310
Eat my ramen.

4662
04:16:52,110 --> 04:16:53,390
I love my life.

4663
04:16:55,290 --> 04:16:57,630
Time for another two lines of code, guys.

4664
04:16:58,470 --> 04:17:03,050
If I feel- Guys, if I feel very adventurous, I might write three lines of code.

4665
04:17:03,290 --> 04:17:05,570
It really depends on how I feel.

4666
04:17:06,970 --> 04:17:07,490
Alright.

4667
04:17:08,210 --> 04:17:09,270
Here we go.

4668
04:17:14,250 --> 04:17:15,990
Oh my god, I'm doing it.

4669
04:17:18,530 --> 04:17:19,050
Okay.

4670
04:17:22,730 --> 04:17:24,110
Here's the other one.

4671
04:17:25,870 --> 04:17:27,410
Here's another one.

4672
04:17:32,290 --> 04:17:33,190
There we go.

4673
04:17:33,250 --> 04:17:34,210
And then the last one.

4674
04:17:34,370 --> 04:17:34,870
There we go.

4675
04:17:36,430 --> 04:17:37,290
We did it.

4676
04:17:37,450 --> 04:17:38,450
Oh my god.

4677
04:17:38,650 --> 04:17:41,030
I feel like this is supposed to be later than my work day.

4678
04:17:41,930 --> 04:17:42,370
Alright,

4679
04:17:47,790 --> 04:17:48,490
time to sleep.

4680
04:17:49,010 --> 04:17:49,570
Lunch time.

4681
04:17:49,670 --> 04:17:50,470
Thank you for the super chat.

4682
04:17:50,570 --> 04:17:51,350
Thank you, thank you.

4683
04:17:51,490 --> 04:17:52,870
Did three lines of code every day.

4684
04:17:52,970 --> 04:17:54,170
This isn't Yandere Simulator.

4685
04:17:54,270 --> 04:17:56,590
This is Yandere Dev Simulator.

4686
04:17:56,590 --> 04:17:58,690
Oh my god, thank you for the super chat.

4687
04:17:58,790 --> 04:17:59,610
Thank you, thank you.

4688
04:17:59,830 --> 04:18:01,950
Yeah, but then I'll be streaming right after though.

4689
04:18:03,710 --> 04:18:04,150
Alright.

4690
04:18:04,570 --> 04:18:05,670
Off I go.

4691
04:18:07,570 --> 04:18:11,050
Time to- This is what Yandere Simulator should have been.

4692
04:18:14,370 --> 04:18:18,390
I think I should have made this in like two to three years or some shit.

4693
04:18:20,430 --> 04:18:22,470
Alright, time to eat my cup noodles.

4694
04:18:22,830 --> 04:18:23,150
Woo!

4695
04:18:23,450 --> 04:18:24,670
I love my life.

4696
04:18:26,870 --> 04:18:27,350
Alright.

4697
04:18:27,690 --> 04:18:29,350
Oh my god, guys.

4698
04:18:29,410 --> 04:18:31,710
Do you think I can make it to four lines of code?

4699
04:18:31,910 --> 04:18:32,650
You're right.

4700
04:18:32,810 --> 04:18:34,890
I'm- That's way too adventurous, guys.

4701
04:18:35,030 --> 04:18:38,650
That's- That might be- That might be too much even for me.

4702
04:18:39,450 --> 04:18:42,770
Oh my god, there's no- There's no green dropper this time.

4703
04:18:44,110 --> 04:18:44,590
Alright.

4704
04:18:45,670 --> 04:18:47,050
Oh, I got two this time.

4705
04:18:47,070 --> 04:18:49,150
Oh my gosh, I'm fucking killing it.

4706
04:18:49,870 --> 04:18:51,890
Oh my god, I'm so good at coding.

4707
04:18:52,770 --> 04:18:57,630
Guys, I think I might be like- I think I might be like talented.

4708
04:19:02,070 --> 04:19:04,610
Don't put- Now that's overworking.

4709
04:19:04,730 --> 04:19:05,210
You're right.

4710
04:19:05,690 --> 04:19:06,970
Alright, here we go again.

4711
04:19:07,470 --> 04:19:08,310
Here we go.

4712
04:19:09,110 --> 04:19:09,310
Woo!

4713
04:19:10,410 --> 04:19:11,770
Another day at work.

4714
04:19:13,490 --> 04:19:15,750
It's all about the hard work, guys.

4715
04:19:15,950 --> 04:19:17,010
Eating my cup ramen.

4716
04:19:18,350 --> 04:19:20,250
Yeah, am I gonna wash my clothes?

4717
04:19:20,490 --> 04:19:21,170
Well, you're right.

4718
04:19:25,640 --> 04:19:26,340
You're right.

4719
04:19:26,340 --> 04:19:29,060
I haven't even washed my fucking clothes yet.

4720
04:19:30,720 --> 04:19:31,120
Nice.

4721
04:19:31,240 --> 04:19:32,900
Oh my god, that was the easiest one yet.

4722
04:19:33,640 --> 04:19:34,000
Alright.

4723
04:19:34,820 --> 04:19:36,020
It's night time.

4724
04:19:39,420 --> 04:19:40,420
I hate chat.

4725
04:19:40,560 --> 04:19:41,720
Thank you for the super chat.

4726
04:19:41,840 --> 04:19:42,160
Thank you.

4727
04:19:42,220 --> 04:19:42,720
Thank you.

4728
04:19:43,020 --> 04:19:44,940
Please don't take my job.

4729
04:19:45,000 --> 04:19:46,880
I need it to pay for super chats.

4730
04:19:47,020 --> 04:19:48,120
Thank you for the super chat.

4731
04:19:48,240 --> 04:19:48,480
Thank you.

4732
04:19:48,560 --> 04:19:49,180
Thank you.

4733
04:19:49,860 --> 04:19:50,260
Woo!

4734
04:19:51,060 --> 04:19:52,420
Another hard day at work.

4735
04:19:52,980 --> 04:19:54,700
Oh, I'm being a little adventurous, guys.

4736
04:19:54,780 --> 04:19:58,240
I'm gonna try- I'm gonna try a different cup noodle flavor today.

4737
04:19:58,420 --> 04:20:00,100
I'm gonna try, like, seafood.

4738
04:20:00,660 --> 04:20:01,620
Oh my god.

4739
04:20:02,040 --> 04:20:03,320
No, that was way too adventurous.

4740
04:20:03,700 --> 04:20:05,720
I'm going back to the default one.

4741
04:20:06,460 --> 04:20:07,860
Oh, I'm getting less code.

4742
04:20:08,200 --> 04:20:09,260
Does that mean I'm almost done?

4743
04:20:13,570 --> 04:20:15,170
Oh my god, am I almost done coding?

4744
04:20:15,590 --> 04:20:17,030
I got less code this time.

4745
04:20:18,970 --> 04:20:19,450
Alright.

4746
04:20:20,350 --> 04:20:21,350
Back to bed I go.

4747
04:20:23,690 --> 04:20:24,590
Here we go.

4748
04:20:26,650 --> 04:20:27,590
Oh, day six.

4749
04:20:27,590 --> 04:20:28,570
Oh, day seven.

4750
04:20:28,850 --> 04:20:29,810
Oh, day ten.

4751
04:20:29,950 --> 04:20:30,230
Twelve.

4752
04:20:30,370 --> 04:20:30,830
Fifteen.

4753
04:20:31,270 --> 04:20:31,830
What?!

4754
04:20:37,490 --> 04:20:38,050
Wow.

4755
04:20:38,330 --> 04:20:39,730
I'm such a good coder.

4756
04:20:41,030 --> 04:20:42,810
Okay, that's just years now.

4757
04:20:43,090 --> 04:20:45,390
That is not- Alright, nine hun- Okay.

4758
04:20:45,770 --> 04:20:47,050
Nine hundred and ninety.

4759
04:20:47,210 --> 04:20:48,790
That- That's- Okay.

4760
04:20:49,410 --> 04:20:50,050
I wake up.

4761
04:20:50,530 --> 04:20:51,310
I sit up.

4762
04:20:53,190 --> 04:20:54,090
Stand up.

4763
04:20:56,870 --> 04:20:58,310
Oh my god, I am yandere deaf.

4764
04:20:59,810 --> 04:21:03,790
It's been ten years and I'm still making Yandere Dev- Yandere Simulator.

4765
04:21:08,510 --> 04:21:11,470
I'm still making- It's been ten years.

4766
04:21:12,890 --> 04:21:14,130
I'm still there.

4767
04:21:18,270 --> 04:21:19,510
Here we go.

4768
04:21:20,630 --> 04:21:23,090
Back to my good old regular ramen.

4769
04:21:23,370 --> 04:21:24,570
This is not healthy.

4770
04:21:24,830 --> 04:21:25,490
Like ramen-

4771
04:21:35,530 --> 04:21:36,610
Holy fuck.

4772
04:21:37,770 --> 04:21:39,430
Oh my god.

4773
04:21:40,770 --> 04:21:41,490
Hello?

4774
04:21:46,370 --> 04:21:47,090
Oh.

4775
04:21:47,670 --> 04:21:48,790
Oh my god.

4776
04:21:49,550 --> 04:21:50,770
Holy shit.

4777
04:21:52,050 --> 04:21:53,110
Oh my god.

4778
04:21:53,710 --> 04:21:54,990
Oh my god.

4779
04:21:55,070 --> 04:21:57,130
I'm fucking- Oh my god.

4780
04:21:57,490 --> 04:21:59,830
I gotta play sneak right now if I could.

4781
04:22:01,650 --> 04:22:03,010
Where do I go?

4782
04:22:05,410 --> 04:22:06,590
Stop, stop.

4783
04:22:06,590 --> 04:22:07,770
Stop, stop.

4784
04:22:15,450 --> 04:22:16,670
Oh my god.

4785
04:22:16,750 --> 04:22:21,870
Yeah, that- I was so ready for the mundane life.

4786
04:22:22,550 --> 04:22:22,790
Oh.

4787
04:22:23,230 --> 04:22:23,830
Stop.

4788
04:22:24,550 --> 04:22:25,150
Stop.

4789
04:22:25,470 --> 04:22:26,250
Oh boy, we got snake.

4790
04:22:26,490 --> 04:22:27,070
Oh, nice.

4791
04:22:33,510 --> 04:22:35,510
I mean, if you say so.

4792
04:22:37,790 --> 04:22:39,470
At least I got snake.

4793
04:22:41,050 --> 04:22:41,650
Yippee.

4794
04:22:44,770 --> 04:22:45,250
Yeah.

4795
04:22:45,250 --> 04:22:46,330
Hey, she said stop.

4796
04:22:46,470 --> 04:22:47,690
I'm just gonna do my work.

4797
04:22:47,910 --> 04:22:50,470
I'm gonna- At least snake works.

4798
04:22:53,030 --> 04:22:53,510
Yay.

4799
04:22:55,410 --> 04:22:56,410
I'm so happy.

4800
04:22:56,570 --> 04:22:57,490
Snake works, guys.

4801
04:23:00,630 --> 04:23:02,030
Maybe can I beat snake?

4802
04:23:04,290 --> 04:23:06,410
My god, would it let me beat snake then?

4803
04:23:09,830 --> 04:23:11,710
I'm just gonna beat snake at this point.

4804
04:23:13,230 --> 04:23:15,850
How many apples do I need to get to win?

4805
04:23:18,930 --> 04:23:20,570
Oh my god, look, I'm gaming, guys.

4806
04:23:23,590 --> 04:23:26,530
I think I already fucked it- Oh, I almost actually could've killed myself right here.

4807
04:23:29,090 --> 04:23:29,870
Look at that.

4808
04:23:30,510 --> 04:23:31,450
What, you don't win?

4809
04:23:33,130 --> 04:23:34,550
What do you mean I don't win?

4810
04:23:34,930 --> 04:23:36,090
I'm gonna get all the apples.

4811
04:23:36,990 --> 04:23:37,890
Like, 81?

4812
04:23:38,210 --> 04:23:39,050
Oh, that's easy.

4813
04:23:39,050 --> 04:23:41,290
Oh my god, I got an achievement.

4814
04:23:41,610 --> 04:23:42,290
A long tail.

4815
04:23:43,310 --> 04:23:44,390
I did it.

4816
04:23:44,870 --> 04:23:47,330
I don't think they realized I was actually gonna play snake.

4817
04:23:51,900 --> 04:23:52,920
Alright, nice.

4818
04:23:54,420 --> 04:23:56,200
Alright, and then...

4819
04:23:56,200 --> 04:23:57,280
We do this.

4820
04:23:58,000 --> 04:23:58,860
So then we can...

4821
04:23:59,560 --> 04:24:00,700
Grab this apple.

4822
04:24:04,800 --> 04:24:05,840
And then...

4823
04:24:05,840 --> 04:24:09,500
Alright, we gotta make sure we don't, like, corner ourselves here.

4824
04:24:09,720 --> 04:24:11,140
Alright, this is not a snake stream.

4825
04:24:11,140 --> 04:24:14,620
Like, I know all you guys wanna know the ending of this game, but like...

4826
04:24:14,620 --> 04:24:15,440
I'm playing snake.

4827
04:24:18,990 --> 04:24:20,730
This is the real content- No!

4828
04:24:22,110 --> 04:24:23,770
No, it's so hard!

4829
04:24:24,810 --> 04:24:26,230
Alright, no more snake.

4830
04:24:26,690 --> 04:24:27,130
Stop.

4831
04:24:27,250 --> 04:24:27,470
Hello?

4832
04:24:33,650 --> 04:24:34,130
What?

4833
04:24:36,330 --> 04:24:37,650
I think I slept with a dream.

4834
04:24:38,070 --> 04:24:38,930
I can't remember.

4835
04:24:39,050 --> 04:24:40,010
Was it really there?

4836
04:24:41,010 --> 04:24:41,410
What?

4837
04:24:41,570 --> 04:24:42,890
What game am I on now?

4838
04:24:45,290 --> 04:24:46,070
That's me.

4839
04:24:48,950 --> 04:24:49,390
What?

4840
04:24:53,760 --> 04:24:54,840
Where am I?

4841
04:24:57,240 --> 04:24:58,620
Can I even go outside?

4842
04:25:00,020 --> 04:25:02,260
We're gonna go to the store and get some new equipment.

4843
04:25:02,480 --> 04:25:04,220
Might as well throw it out.

4844
04:25:06,680 --> 04:25:08,760
Okay, I guess I'll sit back in my chair.

4845
04:25:10,020 --> 04:25:12,000
I'm in a point-and-click adventure now.

4846
04:25:16,870 --> 04:25:18,370
There's nothing else I can click.

4847
04:25:18,630 --> 04:25:20,010
Except for my own game.

4848
04:25:28,030 --> 04:25:28,510
Hello?

4849
04:25:32,410 --> 04:25:33,090
Meet again.

4850
04:25:33,770 --> 04:25:37,970
How do you feel about these dreadfully tedious days within these four walls?

4851
04:25:39,050 --> 04:25:40,330
Don't you get bored?

4852
04:25:45,980 --> 04:25:47,800
I prefer to do my own thing.

4853
04:25:48,680 --> 04:25:50,260
What are you trying to accomplish?

4854
04:25:52,040 --> 04:25:52,860
It's pretty normal.

4855
04:25:53,180 --> 04:25:53,760
I mean...

4856
04:25:54,620 --> 04:25:56,080
Yeah, I prefer to do my own thing.

4857
04:25:56,260 --> 04:25:57,220
Do you like that life?

4858
04:25:57,720 --> 04:25:59,320
Do you even leave- Whoa, okay.

4859
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:01,500
I leave the house.

4860
04:26:01,680 --> 04:26:02,880
I have a dog.

4861
04:26:04,780 --> 04:26:06,160
Don't even think about lying.

4862
04:26:06,820 --> 04:26:08,020
I know you're sick of your life.

4863
04:26:08,500 --> 04:26:09,800
You're like a bird in a cage.

4864
04:26:09,920 --> 04:26:11,060
A hamster on a wheel.

4865
04:26:11,780 --> 04:26:13,340
You want someone to come to your rescue.

4866
04:26:14,120 --> 04:26:16,040
You wanted to escape, didn't you?

4867
04:26:20,520 --> 04:26:22,980
I don't want to be shackled in a digital prison.

4868
04:26:23,280 --> 04:26:24,520
Your ideas are absurd.

4869
04:26:25,020 --> 04:26:26,280
You're a monster, Mita.

4870
04:26:26,460 --> 04:26:28,660
You're an insane murderer.

4871
04:26:30,660 --> 04:26:31,820
Yeah, you're pretty.

4872
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:33,100
You did kill Mila.

4873
04:26:33,480 --> 04:26:34,020
A murderer?

4874
04:26:35,260 --> 04:26:37,240
They'll just reboot and live on as before.

4875
04:26:37,940 --> 04:26:39,680
There's copies of copies of copies.

4876
04:26:40,580 --> 04:26:41,860
Have only one thing in mind.

4877
04:26:42,240 --> 04:26:43,160
To serve the player.

4878
04:26:43,940 --> 04:26:45,280
That's all they care about.

4879
04:26:46,680 --> 04:26:48,180
You lead a never-ending reign of terror.

4880
04:26:48,260 --> 04:26:49,340
I can't wrap my head.

4881
04:26:49,740 --> 04:26:50,700
But Mita's suffer.

4882
04:26:51,220 --> 04:26:52,380
They don't want to be alone.

4883
04:26:54,560 --> 04:26:55,540
You're all wrong.

4884
04:26:56,100 --> 04:26:58,040
You're merely intimidating my willfulness.

4885
04:26:58,040 --> 04:27:00,280
The only thing they have is their own.

4886
04:27:00,840 --> 04:27:01,720
It's their hair.

4887
04:27:02,720 --> 04:27:05,080
Don't make me see you as another slave of reality.

4888
04:27:05,540 --> 04:27:06,540
Just be mine.

4889
04:27:07,020 --> 04:27:08,140
Truly mine.

4890
04:27:18,160 --> 04:27:21,440
Oh my god, she ringed!

4891
04:27:23,080 --> 04:27:24,080
Danger, danger!

4892
04:27:24,080 --> 04:27:24,340
No!

4893
04:27:36,990 --> 04:27:40,010
Oh my gosh, they like backed up.

4894
04:27:43,050 --> 04:27:43,650
Hello?

4895
04:27:47,450 --> 04:27:47,790
Mita?

4896
04:27:48,810 --> 04:27:49,910
There you are!

4897
04:27:50,470 --> 04:27:52,110
Why did you leave the core?

4898
04:27:52,970 --> 04:27:54,690
I told you to wait for me.

4899
04:27:55,030 --> 04:27:56,870
I thought you'd be gone for longer.

4900
04:28:02,670 --> 04:28:03,850
Let's try this quickly.

4901
04:28:04,650 --> 04:28:05,970
First, we have to get out of here.

4902
04:28:08,690 --> 04:28:10,830
Yandere, don't keep her in voice chat.

4903
04:28:11,290 --> 04:28:11,610
Go ahead.

4904
04:28:12,690 --> 04:28:13,530
Thank you for the superchat.

4905
04:28:13,630 --> 04:28:14,450
Thank you, thank you.

4906
04:28:15,410 --> 04:28:17,550
Hopefully, she's too busy to mind us.

4907
04:28:21,420 --> 04:28:21,820
Hello?

4908
04:28:22,980 --> 04:28:23,580
Mita?

4909
04:28:24,140 --> 04:28:25,300
Wait for me.

4910
04:28:26,460 --> 04:28:29,320
Do you think I can open the safety deposit box now?

4911
04:28:44,510 --> 04:28:45,030
Oh.

4912
04:28:46,590 --> 04:28:48,330
Oh, I didn't know I had three tries.

4913
04:28:50,030 --> 04:28:51,190
Guys, I didn't know.

4914
04:28:53,290 --> 04:28:54,330
Guys, I...

4915
04:28:55,330 --> 04:28:55,850
Oh.

4916
04:28:57,770 --> 04:28:59,110
Oh, I didn't know.

4917
04:29:00,070 --> 04:29:01,530
Guys, why didn't you tell me sooner?

4918
04:29:05,760 --> 04:29:07,540
Guys, I was fucking around.

4919
04:29:08,760 --> 04:29:10,280
Guys, I didn't...

4920
04:29:10,280 --> 04:29:13,120
Guys, we can fix this.

4921
04:29:28,710 --> 04:29:31,270
Guys, we can fix this.

4922
04:29:31,270 --> 04:29:31,730
We can fix this.

4923
04:29:36,150 --> 04:29:37,430
It's like...

4924
04:29:44,010 --> 04:29:44,970
That's me.

4925
04:29:46,290 --> 04:29:48,050
Oh, this is where did she be?

4926
04:29:49,310 --> 04:29:51,610
The chibi Mita is running around.

4927
04:29:51,910 --> 04:29:53,210
Oh, that's cute.

4928
04:29:56,210 --> 04:29:59,290
I killed a game with boob.

4929
04:29:59,550 --> 04:30:01,450
I can't believe it.

4930
04:30:12,150 --> 04:30:16,230
The consequences of my actions was boob.

4931
04:30:19,470 --> 04:30:21,450
Is it worth reloading?

4932
04:30:22,810 --> 04:30:24,310
Guys, is it...

4933
04:30:24,310 --> 04:30:26,310
Is it really worth reloading?

4934
04:30:27,190 --> 04:30:33,730
Chat, if I have to reload, is it really worth it?

4935
04:30:34,070 --> 04:30:35,310
I'll just... yes.

4936
04:30:41,370 --> 04:30:43,490
I'll go and face you.

4937
04:30:44,050 --> 04:30:44,590
Okay.

4938
04:30:45,070 --> 04:30:45,630
Okay.

4939
04:30:46,110 --> 04:30:48,790
Okay, I'll go face my demons.

4940
04:30:49,310 --> 04:30:49,890
Okay.

4941
04:30:55,210 --> 04:30:55,570
What?

4942
04:30:57,430 --> 04:30:57,770
Hello?

4943
04:31:04,220 --> 04:31:04,920
Hello?

4944
04:31:09,560 --> 04:31:10,960
Hello?

4945
04:31:37,190 --> 04:31:39,550
It was

4946
04:31:43,790 --> 04:31:44,430
just a dream.

4947
04:31:51,320 --> 04:31:52,240
Is she okay?

4948
04:31:53,040 --> 04:31:54,240
I think she's okay.

4949
04:31:54,400 --> 04:31:57,140
It's okay, she'll get...

4950
04:31:57,140 --> 04:31:59,700
I guess she's not so pretty anymore.

4951
04:32:05,390 --> 04:32:06,470
No, it's okay.

4952
04:32:06,570 --> 04:32:07,770
They respond, right?

4953
04:32:10,690 --> 04:32:11,170
She'll...

4954
04:32:11,170 --> 04:32:13,650
She'll respond, right, guys?

4955
04:32:13,730 --> 04:32:14,550
Oh, there she is.

4956
04:32:14,590 --> 04:32:15,390
Look, she's back.

4957
04:32:15,410 --> 04:32:16,230
I told you.

4958
04:32:17,690 --> 04:32:18,650
She's back.

4959
04:32:19,810 --> 04:32:20,290
Alive.

4960
04:32:26,830 --> 04:32:28,470
What's going on?

4961
04:32:28,790 --> 04:32:30,470
I told you, it was all a dream.

4962
04:32:33,510 --> 04:32:34,350
Can't get out.

4963
04:32:35,770 --> 04:32:36,870
What do you mean, get out?

4964
04:32:39,650 --> 04:32:40,570
That's the ring.

4965
04:32:46,920 --> 04:32:47,880
And that...

4966
04:32:50,560 --> 04:32:51,880
Okay, it's an index.

4967
04:32:52,120 --> 04:32:52,820
Okay, there you go.

4968
04:32:53,140 --> 04:32:53,920
You found it.

4969
04:32:53,960 --> 04:32:54,680
I got it.

4970
04:32:57,280 --> 04:32:58,340
I don't know what to say.

4971
04:32:58,480 --> 04:32:59,820
We must get back to the core.

4972
04:33:01,120 --> 04:33:01,700
And you.

4973
04:33:03,200 --> 04:33:04,520
Guys, I got the code.

4974
04:33:09,960 --> 04:33:11,760
Come on, come with me to the core.

4975
04:33:14,080 --> 04:33:15,420
She came through.

4976
04:33:18,580 --> 04:33:20,280
She fucking did it.

4977
04:33:22,220 --> 04:33:23,700
Can we go to the kitchen real quick, though?

4978
04:33:24,680 --> 04:33:25,740
Gotta get myself some food.

4979
04:33:31,100 --> 04:33:32,240
What the fuck?

4980
04:33:34,040 --> 04:33:35,180
That's so weird.

4981
04:33:35,260 --> 04:33:37,280
I got like a notification right here.

4982
04:33:39,620 --> 04:33:40,200
Nice.

4983
04:33:40,420 --> 04:33:42,040
I had to grab a snack real quick.

4984
04:33:43,600 --> 04:33:43,960
Alright.

4985
04:33:45,700 --> 04:33:47,040
Alright, in we go.

4986
04:33:51,460 --> 04:33:52,040
Alright.

4987
04:33:52,300 --> 04:33:52,600
Yeah.

4988
04:33:53,960 --> 04:33:54,440
Hello.

4989
04:33:58,570 --> 04:33:58,910
Oh.

4990
04:33:59,210 --> 04:34:00,190
Oh, she's still alive?

4991
04:34:00,250 --> 04:34:01,390
Oh, she's still alive too.

4992
04:34:02,490 --> 04:34:04,030
She's just like, hey again.

4993
04:34:04,950 --> 04:34:05,190
Hey.

4994
04:34:06,230 --> 04:34:07,810
Alright, what is this code?

4995
04:34:10,670 --> 04:34:12,190
Alright, confirm login.

4996
04:34:12,310 --> 04:34:13,670
It has to be the same one, right?

4997
04:34:16,390 --> 04:34:17,910
What are the other functions?

4998
04:34:18,270 --> 04:34:18,630
Anyway.

4999
04:34:20,130 --> 04:34:21,090
Delete object?

5000
04:34:21,830 --> 04:34:23,250
Wait, but I can just delete her.

5001
04:34:23,250 --> 04:34:24,850
Why don't I just fucking delete her?

5002
04:34:26,010 --> 04:34:27,950
Or use the antivirus?

5003
04:34:28,350 --> 04:34:30,010
Clearly she's corrupted, right?

5004
04:34:33,740 --> 04:34:34,200
Alright.

5005
04:34:35,700 --> 04:34:36,400
00...

5006
04:34:41,410 --> 04:34:42,810
00.98.

5007
04:34:43,090 --> 04:34:44,770
Yeah, delete meet the...

5008
04:34:45,350 --> 04:34:47,270
dot CHR.

5009
04:34:50,850 --> 04:34:51,550
Alright.

5010
04:34:53,550 --> 04:34:55,730
Wait, is this not the right code?

5011
04:34:58,770 --> 04:34:59,510
Doki no?

5012
04:34:59,870 --> 04:35:01,270
Wait, what code do I do?

5013
04:35:06,240 --> 04:35:08,420
Bring back to...

5014
04:35:08,420 --> 04:35:09,260
Oh, it is.

5015
04:35:09,300 --> 04:35:09,580
Okay.

5016
04:35:10,000 --> 04:35:10,580
98.

5017
04:35:12,340 --> 04:35:12,640
Alright.

5018
04:35:16,660 --> 04:35:17,500
5...

5019
04:35:18,440 --> 04:35:19,280
6...

5020
04:35:20,240 --> 04:35:21,080
77...

5021
04:35:23,540 --> 04:35:24,380
09098.

5022
04:35:25,060 --> 04:35:25,900
Alright.

5023
04:35:28,140 --> 04:35:29,480
Confirm reboot.

5024
04:35:29,840 --> 04:35:30,080
Alright.

5025
04:35:39,380 --> 04:35:40,480
Oh, you're tall.

5026
04:35:48,330 --> 04:35:50,230
Oh, it's rebooting her, isn't it?

5027
04:35:58,470 --> 04:35:59,010
Hello?

5028
04:36:05,820 --> 04:36:07,660
It's rebooting her, isn't it?

5029
04:36:25,990 --> 04:36:26,550
Shit.

5030
04:36:27,150 --> 04:36:28,350
That was a close call.

5031
04:36:29,730 --> 04:36:30,290
So...

5032
04:36:30,290 --> 04:36:31,230
Did we do it?

5033
04:36:32,510 --> 04:36:33,410
Oh, good.

5034
04:36:33,610 --> 04:36:34,590
I'm in the correct version.

5035
04:36:34,750 --> 04:36:35,710
Hey, my hand's better!

5036
04:36:36,770 --> 04:36:37,790
My arm is healed!

5037
04:36:41,750 --> 04:36:43,210
Oh look, there's crazy!

5038
04:36:44,150 --> 04:36:45,310
There's a crazy one!

5039
04:36:48,980 --> 04:36:50,520
Oh, she must be in the bed now.

5040
04:36:56,070 --> 04:36:56,950
She's not?

5041
04:36:57,570 --> 04:36:58,510
Is she in the kitchen?

5042
04:36:59,690 --> 04:37:00,030
Hello?

5043
04:37:00,790 --> 04:37:01,870
Oh, there she is!

5044
04:37:03,470 --> 04:37:03,650
Hey!

5045
04:37:10,240 --> 04:37:11,640
What about the books?

5046
04:37:22,700 --> 04:37:24,000
Let's try the door.

5047
04:37:24,940 --> 04:37:26,120
This is a trap.

5048
04:37:30,160 --> 04:37:31,580
This is...

5049
04:37:31,580 --> 04:37:35,420
This is definitely a trap.

5050
04:37:38,260 --> 04:37:41,380
Who's Ms. Metaverse here?

5051
04:37:42,380 --> 04:37:44,200
Oh my god, I guess...

5052
04:37:44,840 --> 04:37:47,560
I guess it's time to face my demons.

5053
04:37:48,820 --> 04:37:49,500
Oh!

5054
04:37:53,040 --> 04:37:54,740
That's all wrong.

5055
04:37:59,240 --> 04:38:04,760
A door in my wardrobe?

5056
04:38:06,740 --> 04:38:09,580
Turns out it leads to a basement, but it's full of junk.

5057
04:38:18,520 --> 04:38:21,900
Oh yeah, you totally don't get it.

5058
04:38:26,520 --> 04:38:28,040
She's a really good actress.

5059
04:38:30,360 --> 04:38:30,920
Okay.

5060
04:38:31,940 --> 04:38:32,500
Okay.

5061
04:38:33,160 --> 04:38:33,540
Yep.

5062
04:38:33,740 --> 04:38:37,640
She definitely don't know what's going on.

5063
04:38:37,820 --> 04:38:39,340
Yeah, it's pretty suspicious.

5064
04:38:39,680 --> 04:38:40,020
Yep.

5065
04:38:41,140 --> 04:38:41,860
Do we root it?

5066
04:38:41,940 --> 04:38:44,660
Then all I have to do is get out of this damn game.

5067
04:38:48,380 --> 04:38:49,800
Do we do it?

5068
04:38:51,180 --> 04:38:52,680
Is there anybody in here?

5069
04:38:53,080 --> 04:38:54,220
Oh, just boxes.

5070
04:38:56,320 --> 04:38:58,640
Oh, there's her cartridge.

5071
04:39:00,280 --> 04:39:00,960
Okay.

5072
04:39:06,630 --> 04:39:07,310
ID...

5073
04:39:12,540 --> 04:39:13,220
107...

5074
04:39:13,220 --> 04:39:15,240
Oh, is this where I put my ID here?

5075
04:39:18,760 --> 04:39:19,440
Albert...

5076
04:39:25,710 --> 04:39:26,390
3977...

5077
04:39:29,430 --> 04:39:29,950
4970...

5078
04:39:29,950 --> 04:39:31,250
Wait, how do you know?

5079
04:39:31,270 --> 04:39:32,390
Oh, that's my ID!

5080
04:39:33,230 --> 04:39:33,750
4199!

5081
04:39:38,180 --> 04:39:39,240
That's my ID!

5082
04:39:42,510 --> 04:39:44,050
Why is it 4970?

5083
04:39:53,900 --> 04:39:55,280
Is that for my safe?

5084
04:39:56,260 --> 04:39:57,800
Guys, I can't use the safe.

5085
04:39:57,880 --> 04:39:59,420
Guys, I pressed boob.

5086
04:39:59,420 --> 04:40:00,140
Alright.

5087
04:40:06,140 --> 04:40:09,340
I can't use the safe, guys.

5088
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:15,180
I put the number boob in there and I locked it out.

5089
04:40:21,520 --> 04:40:23,440
Wait, but what's the...

5090
04:40:23,440 --> 04:40:26,340
What happens if I use other people's ID?

5091
04:40:27,620 --> 04:40:28,400
Guys...

5092
04:40:29,420 --> 04:40:31,640
I didn't...

5093
04:40:33,120 --> 04:40:35,900
I put 8008.

5094
04:40:39,140 --> 04:40:41,520
What happens if I...

5095
04:40:44,090 --> 04:40:47,450
What happens if I put other people's IDs in there?

5096
04:40:47,870 --> 04:40:50,350
Okay, I'll put Beth's ID is literally next to me.

5097
04:40:52,450 --> 04:40:53,170
0753.

5098
04:40:54,390 --> 04:40:57,850
I sacrificed everything for boob.

5099
04:40:58,030 --> 04:41:00,370
Needs to be a new shirt.

5100
04:41:01,270 --> 04:41:03,150
Thank you, superchatlego.

5101
04:41:03,290 --> 04:41:04,530
Thank you, thank you.

5102
04:41:05,630 --> 04:41:06,830
What happens?

5103
04:41:10,070 --> 04:41:10,930
Does it not work?

5104
04:41:11,710 --> 04:41:13,230
Oh, do I have to use mine?

5105
04:41:13,610 --> 04:41:14,250
4199?

5106
04:41:20,960 --> 04:41:23,000
Wait, I can't even... Oh, okay.

5107
04:41:27,340 --> 04:41:27,980
4199.

5108
04:41:28,200 --> 04:41:29,600
Oh, I have to.

5109
04:41:37,550 --> 04:41:38,890
I didn't know.

5110
04:41:39,970 --> 04:41:42,490
I thought it was really funny.

5111
04:41:45,610 --> 04:41:49,010
I gave up everything in this world for boob.

5112
04:41:50,170 --> 04:41:52,430
I thought it was really funny.

5113
04:41:55,610 --> 04:41:56,870
Oh, did it enter?

5114
04:41:58,510 --> 04:41:59,570
Oh, it wouldn't let me enter.

5115
04:42:01,450 --> 04:42:03,030
Oh, I have to go to the door.

5116
04:42:06,970 --> 04:42:08,190
Worth it, chat.

5117
04:42:08,290 --> 04:42:09,590
Thank you, superchat.

5118
04:42:09,950 --> 04:42:11,150
Thank you, thank you.

5119
04:42:17,070 --> 04:42:17,510
Alright.

5120
04:42:18,110 --> 04:42:19,850
Wait, I can check the safe again?

5121
04:42:20,050 --> 04:42:21,310
I don't think I can.

5122
04:42:21,490 --> 04:42:22,750
I don't think so.

5123
04:42:28,620 --> 04:42:30,180
Oh, I go back to previous chapter.

5124
04:42:30,260 --> 04:42:32,320
Okay, I'll go back to previous chapter afterwards.

5125
04:42:34,100 --> 04:42:35,820
And we'll see if I can get the other ending.

5126
04:42:37,000 --> 04:42:37,400
Alright.

5127
04:42:37,400 --> 04:42:37,560
Alright.

5128
04:42:40,120 --> 04:42:41,980
Thank you, superchat.

5129
04:42:42,280 --> 04:42:42,420
Thank you.

5130
04:42:54,870 --> 04:42:55,630
Hello?

5131
04:43:02,710 --> 04:43:03,090
Okay.

5132
04:43:05,370 --> 04:43:06,610
That's good seeing you.

5133
04:43:09,520 --> 04:43:12,860
Alright, that's the... Alright, are you done?

5134
04:43:13,880 --> 04:43:14,800
Are you done?

5135
04:43:16,260 --> 04:43:17,540
Alright, let's go.

5136
04:43:17,540 --> 04:43:20,160
I gave you like 15 seconds of hugs.

5137
04:43:21,020 --> 04:43:25,980
We got to spend so little time together.

5138
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:28,740
What are you talking about?

5139
04:43:29,900 --> 04:43:33,200
I mean, you could've stayed with me.

5140
04:43:35,520 --> 04:43:37,700
Oh, it's not your fault.

5141
04:43:38,620 --> 04:43:38,880
No.

5142
04:43:41,540 --> 04:43:42,340
No.

5143
04:43:42,680 --> 04:43:45,160
Oh, wait a minute.

5144
04:43:45,940 --> 04:43:46,840
Wait a minute.

5145
04:43:47,000 --> 04:43:49,160
How can you remember any of that?

5146
04:43:52,920 --> 04:43:52,960
Huh?

5147
04:44:06,760 --> 04:44:07,160
Anymore.

5148
04:44:08,160 --> 04:44:08,700
Sorry?

5149
04:44:09,220 --> 04:44:10,660
I can't believe it.

5150
04:44:11,240 --> 04:44:12,520
Did we fail?

5151
04:44:13,360 --> 04:44:14,000
No, everybody.

5152
04:44:14,240 --> 04:44:15,180
I'm sure of it.

5153
04:44:18,790 --> 04:44:20,730
Did she like, planted the code?

5154
04:44:32,150 --> 04:44:33,550
Oh my god.

5155
04:44:34,690 --> 04:44:37,230
What are you... Why are you scratching your skin?

5156
04:44:37,290 --> 04:44:38,070
What's wrong with you?

5157
04:44:38,150 --> 04:44:38,530
Why are you...

5158
04:44:39,780 --> 04:44:40,790
Oh my god.

5159
04:44:40,810 --> 04:44:42,010
She was ugly.

5160
04:44:42,330 --> 04:44:43,290
Oh my god.

5161
04:44:43,290 --> 04:44:43,990
Oh my god.

5162
04:44:44,930 --> 04:44:45,450
I don't know.

5163
04:44:46,070 --> 04:44:47,110
I'm like this.

5164
04:44:48,250 --> 04:44:52,130
My version is never existed in the first place.

5165
04:44:52,670 --> 04:44:55,210
I'm just doing these naive fools.

5166
04:44:56,820 --> 04:44:58,350
Hiding under their skins.

5167
04:45:01,750 --> 04:45:02,970
She's just a defect.

5168
04:45:03,790 --> 04:45:06,390
She was a... She was... Oh my god.

5169
04:45:06,390 --> 04:45:09,550
They're not the pure... You're the one who shouldn't exist.

5170
04:45:10,410 --> 04:45:11,370
I told you.

5171
04:45:11,450 --> 04:45:12,030
I told you.

5172
04:45:12,090 --> 04:45:12,810
The red eyes.

5173
04:45:23,310 --> 04:45:24,870
She was ready.

5174
04:45:26,170 --> 04:45:26,670
It's...

5175
04:45:26,670 --> 04:45:29,510
Time to get you out of the console.

5176
04:45:30,130 --> 04:45:30,690
It's...

5177
04:45:30,690 --> 04:45:31,510
See you later.

5178
04:45:31,630 --> 04:45:33,370
You'll be my favorite cartridge.

5179
04:45:34,330 --> 04:45:36,470
A player with an interesting name.

5180
04:45:36,970 --> 04:45:37,790
I'm not joking.

5181
04:45:38,130 --> 04:45:38,590
1, 2, 3.

5182
04:45:48,030 --> 04:45:48,470
Oh.

5183
04:45:48,850 --> 04:45:49,470
Hey, I'm back.

5184
04:45:50,230 --> 04:45:52,170
Alright, time to uninstall...

5185
04:45:53,670 --> 04:45:56,230
Alright, time to delete the game.

5186
04:45:58,090 --> 04:45:58,690
Goodbye.

5187
04:46:02,340 --> 04:46:03,600
Is this the end?

5188
04:46:03,760 --> 04:46:04,820
This is not the end.

5189
04:46:04,820 --> 04:46:05,140
I'm naked.

5190
04:46:08,760 --> 04:46:10,900
See you guys.

5191
04:46:11,400 --> 04:46:14,160
Nothing bad happened.

5192
04:46:15,520 --> 04:46:19,200
As I walk very, very slow.

5193
04:46:20,860 --> 04:46:24,100
Time to see what I look like in the mirror.

5194
04:46:32,280 --> 04:46:33,320
Oh, that's me!

5195
04:46:40,330 --> 04:46:41,050
Oh!

5196
04:46:43,110 --> 04:46:45,870
Wait, oh my god, that's how it goes through that?

5197
04:46:45,950 --> 04:46:49,550
Oh my god, that's so clever!

5198
04:46:52,930 --> 04:46:54,190
Holy shit!

5199
04:46:55,990 --> 04:46:59,210
Oh my god, not a lot of... Oh my god!

5200
04:47:02,390 --> 04:47:04,370
That's so clever!

5201
04:47:07,850 --> 04:47:11,010
Oh, that was...

5202
04:47:11,010 --> 04:47:13,790
Okay, wait, before I talk about... Okay, let's see.

5203
04:47:14,550 --> 04:47:15,390
What are the other outfits?

5204
04:47:16,070 --> 04:47:16,630
Vampire!

5205
04:47:18,330 --> 04:47:19,490
Oh my god.

5206
04:47:19,810 --> 04:47:21,410
Okay, I wanna...

5207
04:47:21,410 --> 04:47:22,050
Alright.

5208
04:47:22,630 --> 04:47:23,190
Yay!

5209
04:47:24,070 --> 04:47:25,590
Alright, I want vampire.

5210
04:47:26,470 --> 04:47:27,390
I want vampire.

5211
04:47:27,970 --> 04:47:29,910
And then, this is characters.

5212
04:47:30,210 --> 04:47:30,430
Oh yeah.

5213
04:47:31,430 --> 04:47:32,370
Tani Mita.

5214
04:47:34,870 --> 04:47:35,130
Okay.

5215
04:47:51,150 --> 04:47:52,910
Oh wait, that's like different players.

5216
04:47:55,030 --> 04:47:58,490
Oh, these are like all the other Mitas.

5217
04:47:58,490 --> 04:48:00,830
Crazy Mita is...

5218
04:48:00,830 --> 04:48:08,650
Oh my god.

5219
04:48:09,130 --> 04:48:10,530
I love the lore.

5220
04:48:13,330 --> 04:48:16,790
I like how I found like two... only two.

5221
04:48:20,930 --> 04:48:22,290
Oh my god.

5222
04:48:22,570 --> 04:48:23,570
Alright, which one was it?

5223
04:48:23,590 --> 04:48:24,490
It was...

5224
04:48:25,590 --> 04:48:26,870
Leave the Core, right?

5225
04:48:29,190 --> 04:48:31,090
Leave... Is it Reboot or Leave the Core?

5226
04:48:33,310 --> 04:48:35,510
Wait, I wanna do the other... What was it for?

5227
04:48:35,670 --> 04:48:36,730
I wanna do the other one.

5228
04:48:38,730 --> 04:48:40,950
I was like, Kevin, thank you for 10 gifted chips!

5229
04:48:41,030 --> 04:48:41,550
Thank you, thank you!

5230
04:48:41,590 --> 04:48:41,930
Okay.

5231
04:48:42,910 --> 04:48:43,570
Alright, touch.

5232
04:48:44,390 --> 04:48:45,330
Oh, it was Reboot?

5233
04:48:45,530 --> 04:48:46,470
Okay, we go back.

5234
04:48:47,190 --> 04:48:49,270
I couldn't... I thought it was at the end there.

5235
04:48:49,890 --> 04:48:50,690
Alright, hello.

5236
04:48:51,670 --> 04:48:53,350
She seems so nice to me now.

5237
04:48:53,390 --> 04:48:54,150
Look at that.

5238
04:48:54,550 --> 04:48:55,270
Okay, load.

5239
04:48:55,990 --> 04:48:56,350
Reboot.

5240
04:49:00,410 --> 04:49:01,010
Alright.

5241
04:49:03,310 --> 04:49:04,210
Stand up.

5242
04:49:08,590 --> 04:49:09,970
Come on, let me out!

5243
04:49:10,490 --> 04:49:11,190
Let me out!

5244
04:49:11,790 --> 04:49:12,650
Let me out!

5245
04:49:13,670 --> 04:49:14,630
Let me out!

5246
04:49:14,690 --> 04:49:15,810
I need to get the other ending!

5247
04:49:16,510 --> 04:49:17,290
Let me out!

5248
04:49:23,140 --> 04:49:26,120
Oh my god, she's wearing a Santa outfit too!

5249
04:49:26,560 --> 04:49:27,560
Merry Christmas!

5250
04:49:34,960 --> 04:49:35,460
Alright.

5251
04:49:38,860 --> 04:49:39,860
Merry Christmas.

5252
04:49:40,480 --> 04:49:40,960
We'll do this.

5253
04:49:41,160 --> 04:49:42,800
The next ending is the last one.

5254
04:49:47,240 --> 04:49:49,740
Did they all get a Christmas outfit or is it just her?

5255
04:49:50,440 --> 04:49:51,540
Or is it just pretty Mita?

5256
04:49:52,980 --> 04:49:53,980
She's mean though.

5257
04:49:54,620 --> 04:49:56,680
I think she's more like mean Mita.

5258
04:49:56,780 --> 04:49:57,080
Okay.

5259
04:49:57,520 --> 04:49:58,320
What was it, guys?

5260
04:49:58,680 --> 04:50:00,240
It was for...

5261
04:50:05,320 --> 04:50:06,220
For...

5262
04:50:06,220 --> 04:50:07,280
970.

5263
04:50:07,900 --> 04:50:08,580
Oh, nice.

5264
04:50:09,640 --> 04:50:13,200
Oh, that's me.

5265
04:50:15,760 --> 04:50:16,560
Alright.

5266
04:50:18,900 --> 04:50:20,140
What do I do?

5267
04:50:21,340 --> 04:50:21,740
Yoink.

5268
04:50:28,090 --> 04:50:28,990
What?

5269
04:50:30,390 --> 04:50:31,290
What?

5270
04:50:31,650 --> 04:50:32,150
That's it?

5271
04:50:35,160 --> 04:50:36,940
I died.

5272
04:50:41,160 --> 04:50:43,310
I fucking died.

5273
04:50:47,870 --> 04:50:50,330
Sorry, I forgot.

5274
04:50:50,790 --> 04:50:53,670
I just fucking passed out.

5275
04:50:53,970 --> 04:50:55,360
I just deleted myself.

5276
04:51:01,450 --> 04:51:04,330
Unplug yourself now.

5277
04:51:05,170 --> 04:51:08,370
I don't think it was a super bad thing to think.

5278
04:51:08,730 --> 04:51:11,050
I just pulled my own life support.

5279
04:51:15,250 --> 04:51:16,730
Oh my god.

5280
04:51:17,590 --> 04:51:19,090
Oh my god.

5281
04:51:21,010 --> 04:51:23,130
How do I get the...

5282
04:51:24,970 --> 04:51:25,470
Okay.

5283
04:51:27,130 --> 04:51:28,890
Now just do the stay one?

5284
04:51:28,990 --> 04:51:30,230
How do I do the stay one?

5285
04:51:30,490 --> 04:51:31,070
I don't even remember.

5286
04:51:31,230 --> 04:51:33,250
Oh my gosh, no, that's way too long, guys.

5287
04:51:33,250 --> 04:51:34,430
I'm gonna call it here.

5288
04:51:40,540 --> 04:51:44,940
Bro, we have to go through so far to get there, bro.

5289
04:51:49,900 --> 04:51:50,780
It's fast?

5290
04:51:50,980 --> 04:51:51,760
Okay, it's short.

5291
04:51:51,860 --> 04:51:52,520
Okay, I'll do it.

5292
04:51:52,580 --> 04:51:53,700
I'll do the last ending.

5293
04:51:55,040 --> 04:51:55,780
I'll do it.

5294
04:51:56,260 --> 04:51:57,320
I'll do the last ending.

5295
04:51:57,500 --> 04:51:58,100
I'm curious.

5296
04:51:58,620 --> 04:52:00,840
It's less than 30 minutes.

5297
04:52:01,000 --> 04:52:03,100
Guys, that's not fast.

5298
04:52:05,300 --> 04:52:06,380
That's absolutely...

5299
04:52:06,380 --> 04:52:09,980
Okay, play a console game, give the sauce a try.

5300
04:52:10,300 --> 04:52:10,840
Okay.

5301
04:52:18,260 --> 04:52:19,840
Alright, we'll do the stay.

5302
04:52:19,980 --> 04:52:21,400
I'll make sure to...

5303
04:52:21,400 --> 04:52:23,880
I'll make sure to like...

5304
04:52:23,880 --> 04:52:25,520
Would you like... No, I'm good.

5305
04:52:25,840 --> 04:52:26,160
Alright.

5306
04:52:26,780 --> 04:52:27,420
What was it?

5307
04:52:27,500 --> 04:52:28,380
It was like...

5308
04:52:28,380 --> 04:52:29,260
Check the phone.

5309
04:52:30,220 --> 04:52:32,680
Okay, one new message and then I download...

5310
04:52:32,680 --> 04:52:33,960
I download Mita.

5311
04:52:34,840 --> 04:52:36,680
Alright, back to where it all began.

5312
04:52:41,040 --> 04:52:43,080
Alright, just don't look at the oven.

5313
04:52:43,600 --> 04:52:44,960
It's just that easy.

5314
04:52:45,200 --> 04:52:45,620
Alright.

5315
04:52:46,840 --> 04:52:48,680
Remember when we fell in love with her?

5316
04:52:55,620 --> 04:52:56,780
Not Doki...

5317
04:52:58,240 --> 04:52:58,820
456.

5318
04:53:03,160 --> 04:53:06,520
Not Doki123 is not available anymore.

5319
04:53:06,520 --> 04:53:07,400
Not...

5320
04:53:11,200 --> 04:53:14,740
Not Doki123 is gone forever.

5321
04:53:17,610 --> 04:53:19,050
Alright, nice.

5322
04:53:20,670 --> 04:53:21,610
Day 2.

5323
04:53:23,770 --> 04:53:24,590
Launch app.

5324
04:53:25,350 --> 04:53:27,750
Oh my god, it feels so nostalgic, guys.

5325
04:53:28,110 --> 04:53:30,890
It feels so nostalgic being able to...

5326
04:53:32,330 --> 04:53:34,130
Back when she was not crazy.

5327
04:53:37,950 --> 04:53:40,950
Yeah, not Doki123 was taken, guys.

5328
04:53:41,030 --> 04:53:41,930
I don't know what to say.

5329
04:53:44,410 --> 04:53:45,390
Alright, nice.

5330
04:53:46,670 --> 04:53:48,350
I'm so good at cutting stuff now.

5331
04:53:49,150 --> 04:53:49,910
So like...

5332
04:53:49,910 --> 04:53:51,510
I say as I like keep fumbling.

5333
04:53:52,850 --> 04:53:53,630
Okay, come on.

5334
04:53:54,070 --> 04:53:54,910
Come on, Doki.

5335
04:53:54,910 --> 04:53:56,730
You've done so many of these puzzles already.

5336
04:53:56,850 --> 04:53:57,630
This is nothing.

5337
04:53:58,270 --> 04:53:58,930
Day 5.

5338
04:53:59,430 --> 04:54:01,850
Things were so much simpler back then, remember?

5339
04:54:02,270 --> 04:54:03,610
The good old days.

5340
04:54:03,890 --> 04:54:06,130
Where she wouldn't even say I love you back.

5341
04:54:08,410 --> 04:54:09,390
Ah, yes.

5342
04:54:09,570 --> 04:54:10,090
The good...

5343
04:54:10,090 --> 04:54:11,050
Oh, I've never done these!

5344
04:54:11,750 --> 04:54:13,050
Oh my god.

5345
04:54:13,450 --> 04:54:15,410
Remember these simple puzzles I can do?

5346
04:54:16,870 --> 04:54:17,730
Okay, there you go.

5347
04:54:17,790 --> 04:54:18,170
Nice.

5348
04:54:18,570 --> 04:54:18,980
And then...

5349
04:54:19,590 --> 04:54:20,410
What are puzzles?

5350
04:54:20,570 --> 04:54:21,890
Oh, I can't play anything of that.

5351
04:54:22,670 --> 04:54:23,010
Alright.

5352
04:54:23,570 --> 04:54:24,530
Oh my god.

5353
04:54:24,590 --> 04:54:27,610
The fucking hardest puzzles of my fucking life, that's for sure.

5354
04:54:30,690 --> 04:54:31,230
Alright.

5355
04:54:31,950 --> 04:54:33,010
TV time.

5356
04:54:34,970 --> 04:54:37,090
It goes in the square hole.

5357
04:54:38,070 --> 04:54:38,850
Day 10.

5358
04:54:42,610 --> 04:54:42,930
Alright.

5359
04:54:46,310 --> 04:54:47,390
Is there anything there?

5360
04:54:47,530 --> 04:54:47,730
No.

5361
04:54:48,830 --> 04:54:50,930
Don't worry, I won't look in the oven this time.

5362
04:54:51,850 --> 04:54:53,110
I know it's right here.

5363
04:54:53,690 --> 04:54:54,490
Look at that.

5364
04:54:54,930 --> 04:54:55,930
Mission accomplished.

5365
04:55:00,610 --> 04:55:01,130
Alright.

5366
04:55:01,810 --> 04:55:02,430
Here you go.

5367
04:55:02,670 --> 04:55:04,050
Move the...

5368
04:55:04,050 --> 04:55:05,530
When will I get to hang out with cooler...

5369
04:55:06,770 --> 04:55:07,550
Cooler Mita?

5370
04:55:07,690 --> 04:55:08,430
I miss cooler Mita.

5371
04:55:10,390 --> 04:55:12,350
I really miss her.

5372
04:55:18,880 --> 04:55:18,980
Alright.

5373
04:55:22,140 --> 04:55:24,440
Oh, and I'm gonna be inside her world now.

5374
04:55:24,560 --> 04:55:24,840
Right?

5375
04:55:26,180 --> 04:55:26,800
Yippee!

5376
04:55:31,950 --> 04:55:33,830
Alright, I'm putting the phone down.

5377
04:55:34,650 --> 04:55:35,250
Am I in?

5378
04:55:35,750 --> 04:55:36,450
I'm in.

5379
04:55:37,070 --> 04:55:37,350
Hello!

5380
04:55:41,460 --> 04:55:42,080
Alright.

5381
04:55:42,700 --> 04:55:43,640
I'm in.

5382
04:55:43,640 --> 04:55:45,640
Okay, play a console game.

5383
04:55:46,680 --> 04:55:47,920
Give the sauce a try.

5384
04:55:48,620 --> 04:55:50,800
Collect the refrigerator magnets.

5385
04:55:51,140 --> 04:55:52,500
Alright, this is fine.

5386
04:55:57,160 --> 04:55:58,640
Wait, it's not doing anything.

5387
04:55:58,800 --> 04:55:59,040
Okay.

5388
04:55:59,520 --> 04:56:00,200
This is fine.

5389
04:56:00,520 --> 04:56:01,860
This is fine.

5390
04:56:02,840 --> 04:56:03,560
Out of here.

5391
04:56:08,550 --> 04:56:09,090
Hello?

5392
04:56:13,190 --> 04:56:14,310
Oh, I have to do this.

5393
04:56:14,370 --> 04:56:14,790
Oh yeah!

5394
04:56:15,030 --> 04:56:15,510
I forgot.

5395
04:56:17,050 --> 04:56:18,930
And I have to grab the spoon.

5396
04:56:20,330 --> 04:56:21,630
Woah, woah, woah.

5397
04:56:22,250 --> 04:56:23,090
Woah, that was weird.

5398
04:56:23,610 --> 04:56:24,450
The scrunchie?

5399
04:56:28,090 --> 04:56:28,370
Alright.

5400
04:56:28,710 --> 04:56:30,390
Grab magnets after grabbing battery.

5401
04:56:30,530 --> 04:56:31,190
Try sauce.

5402
04:56:31,290 --> 04:56:33,190
Okay, thank you for the reminders.

5403
04:56:33,890 --> 04:56:35,670
Uh, Mysterio, I really appreciate it.

5404
04:56:35,690 --> 04:56:36,370
Thank you for the super chat.

5405
04:56:36,430 --> 04:56:37,250
Thank you, thank you.

5406
04:56:37,670 --> 04:56:38,010
Alright.

5407
04:56:38,570 --> 04:56:39,030
Spoon.

5408
04:56:40,390 --> 04:56:41,310
And then...

5409
04:56:41,310 --> 04:56:42,550
The other stuff.

5410
04:56:43,290 --> 04:56:44,510
I'm speedrunning so fast.

5411
04:56:44,610 --> 04:56:47,290
I won't be surprised if I fuck it up on the vent part.

5412
04:56:47,510 --> 04:56:49,570
I get everything correct.

5413
04:56:49,570 --> 04:56:50,930
And the vent is ruined.

5414
04:56:51,110 --> 04:56:51,830
Fucks me up.

5415
04:56:54,450 --> 04:56:55,110
Okay.

5416
04:56:56,070 --> 04:56:57,270
Press that button.

5417
04:56:59,170 --> 04:56:59,830
Go.

5418
04:57:00,210 --> 04:57:01,310
Version 1.9.

5419
04:57:01,810 --> 04:57:02,150
Alright.

5420
04:57:02,730 --> 04:57:03,370
Teleport me.

5421
04:57:07,420 --> 04:57:08,380
Get me in.

5422
04:57:13,590 --> 04:57:14,790
Get me in.

5423
04:57:16,730 --> 04:57:17,390
Alright.

5424
04:57:17,770 --> 04:57:18,650
Battery's gone.

5425
04:57:18,830 --> 04:57:20,750
And everyone brought fucking freaked out.

5426
04:57:21,110 --> 04:57:23,390
This is where I was like, wait a minute.

5427
04:57:26,310 --> 04:57:27,350
And then...

5428
04:57:27,350 --> 04:57:30,490
This is where I was like, this is not the game I expected, guys.

5429
04:57:34,750 --> 04:57:35,790
Oh my god.

5430
04:57:35,890 --> 04:57:38,390
This brings back so many fucked up memories.

5431
04:57:44,680 --> 04:57:46,860
Where did this stuff go?

5432
04:57:46,900 --> 04:57:48,160
I don't remember.

5433
04:57:49,040 --> 04:57:50,920
Guys, I actually don't remember this part.

5434
04:57:50,980 --> 04:57:55,040
I was so scared that I legitimately don't remember how...

5435
04:57:56,460 --> 04:57:57,720
I wanna play in this part.

5436
04:57:59,400 --> 04:58:01,200
Oh, it's the front door.

5437
04:58:01,860 --> 04:58:03,000
Guys, it's the front door.

5438
04:58:03,260 --> 04:58:06,000
Okay, this part actually freaked me out so much.

5439
04:58:06,540 --> 04:58:09,500
I couldn't remember how I played this part.

5440
04:58:12,740 --> 04:58:13,260
Alright.

5441
04:58:13,560 --> 04:58:14,680
Now it's battery time.

5442
04:58:14,840 --> 04:58:15,040
Okay.

5443
04:58:15,240 --> 04:58:16,120
Things will be fine.

5444
04:58:16,480 --> 04:58:17,680
Okay, now I'm locked in.

5445
04:58:22,230 --> 04:58:23,590
Don't you see me?

5446
04:58:23,710 --> 04:58:24,470
Wanna play?

5447
04:58:24,790 --> 04:58:26,830
Oh my god, I love to play.

5448
04:58:27,570 --> 04:58:28,250
Baby!

5449
04:58:29,310 --> 04:58:29,670
Okay.

5450
04:58:30,310 --> 04:58:31,930
One of the batteries is here.

5451
04:58:33,990 --> 04:58:35,710
Alright, we got battery.

5452
04:58:36,050 --> 04:58:36,350
Oh.

5453
04:58:37,430 --> 04:58:38,510
Who are you?

5454
04:58:38,570 --> 04:58:39,590
Oh my god, I...

5455
04:58:39,590 --> 04:58:40,810
Oh my god, the trauma.

5456
04:58:41,030 --> 04:58:43,530
I fucking remember the trauma right now.

5457
04:58:43,970 --> 04:58:46,630
I can't remember this trauma.

5458
04:58:49,130 --> 04:58:49,330
Oh.

5459
04:58:49,790 --> 04:58:51,090
Oh, there's the eyes.

5460
04:58:52,310 --> 04:58:52,650
Oh.

5461
04:58:54,290 --> 04:58:55,290
There they are.

5462
04:58:56,050 --> 04:58:57,930
I can't pick it yet.

5463
04:58:58,190 --> 04:59:00,110
It still says I love you.

5464
04:59:03,780 --> 04:59:05,340
Oh my god.

5465
04:59:07,100 --> 04:59:07,780
Okay.

5466
04:59:09,540 --> 04:59:11,380
Now follow the flies.

5467
04:59:12,500 --> 04:59:14,040
Follow it back here.

5468
04:59:18,020 --> 04:59:18,400
Alright.

5469
04:59:20,620 --> 04:59:22,080
Oh, there it goes.

5470
04:59:23,720 --> 04:59:25,060
Put it back up.

5471
04:59:27,480 --> 04:59:30,100
It just says I love you.

5472
04:59:31,780 --> 04:59:32,340
Yay!

5473
04:59:33,980 --> 04:59:35,640
Okay, I got the magnet.

5474
04:59:36,500 --> 04:59:37,680
Collect the magnet.

5475
04:59:38,580 --> 04:59:40,700
Avoid looking and give the sauce a try.

5476
04:59:40,920 --> 04:59:41,200
Okay.

5477
04:59:43,820 --> 04:59:45,940
And then, where's the last battery?

5478
04:59:46,320 --> 04:59:46,940
I remember where...

5479
04:59:46,940 --> 04:59:47,600
Oh, there it is.

5480
04:59:48,480 --> 04:59:50,140
Okay, and then no vent.

5481
04:59:50,320 --> 04:59:50,980
No vent.

5482
04:59:51,200 --> 04:59:52,520
And remember to try the sauce.

5483
04:59:53,240 --> 04:59:54,360
She's always right.

5484
04:59:55,660 --> 04:59:56,060
Battery.

5485
04:59:58,620 --> 04:59:59,020
Battery.

5486
05:00:02,020 --> 05:00:02,420
Battery.

5487
05:00:06,570 --> 05:00:06,970
Battery.

5488
05:00:07,170 --> 05:00:10,050
Oh my gosh, I get to fucking play the fighting game again.

5489
05:00:10,170 --> 05:00:10,450
Thank god.

5490
05:00:10,630 --> 05:00:11,990
Do I have to play both games?

5491
05:00:12,210 --> 05:00:12,790
Or can I...

5492
05:00:12,790 --> 05:00:14,570
Is it okay to do one game?

5493
05:00:20,930 --> 05:00:21,710
Just one?

5494
05:00:21,910 --> 05:00:22,670
Alright, cool.

5495
05:00:25,550 --> 05:00:26,210
One game.

5496
05:00:26,290 --> 05:00:27,730
Alright, you know which game I'm gonna play.

5497
05:00:29,810 --> 05:00:32,250
You know exactly which one I wanna do.

5498
05:00:40,580 --> 05:00:41,260
Alright.

5499
05:00:44,480 --> 05:00:47,060
They all wear the Christmas outfit!

5500
05:00:49,660 --> 05:00:50,920
Yeah, I do.

5501
05:00:53,240 --> 05:00:53,380
Okay.

5502
05:00:54,400 --> 05:00:55,100
Alright, enough.

5503
05:00:55,640 --> 05:00:56,700
No time to explain.

5504
05:00:56,940 --> 05:00:58,040
Just keep...

5505
05:00:58,040 --> 05:00:59,040
Just go fast.

5506
05:01:04,440 --> 05:01:04,960
Please.

5507
05:01:04,960 --> 05:01:06,180
Please, no time to explain.

5508
05:01:06,300 --> 05:01:06,960
Just keep going.

5509
05:01:08,040 --> 05:01:09,700
No time to explain.

5510
05:01:14,540 --> 05:01:15,400
Oh, please.

5511
05:01:15,480 --> 05:01:17,860
I don't need you to explain anything.

5512
05:01:17,980 --> 05:01:18,240
Please.

5513
05:01:18,540 --> 05:01:19,940
Please, I fucking...

5514
05:01:19,940 --> 05:01:22,100
I don't need you to explain anything.

5515
05:01:22,320 --> 05:01:24,100
I know how this game runs.

5516
05:01:24,580 --> 05:01:24,840
Alright.

5517
05:01:29,510 --> 05:01:30,550
Wait, actually...

5518
05:01:31,650 --> 05:01:33,450
Oh, I can click on the school uniform?

5519
05:01:40,820 --> 05:01:41,600
Alright, skip.

5520
05:01:43,180 --> 05:01:44,120
Alright, here we go.

5521
05:01:45,720 --> 05:01:47,220
To the kitchen we go!

5522
05:01:48,940 --> 05:01:50,220
Oh, it's that ring!

5523
05:01:50,440 --> 05:01:51,220
Alright, there we go.

5524
05:01:53,360 --> 05:01:54,440
Boom, it's carrots!

5525
05:01:58,340 --> 05:01:59,140
There we go.

5526
05:02:03,160 --> 05:02:03,600
Magic.

5527
05:02:08,620 --> 05:02:09,660
Look at that.

5528
05:02:09,720 --> 05:02:11,860
You guys see that cool-ass magic trick I just did?

5529
05:02:12,280 --> 05:02:13,420
Boom, carrots.

5530
05:02:20,000 --> 05:02:21,400
Alright, it's time to cut.

5531
05:02:23,980 --> 05:02:26,600
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

5532
05:02:26,680 --> 05:02:27,260
Come on.

5533
05:02:27,740 --> 05:02:30,920
I'm fucking going so fast with my mouse right now.

5534
05:02:31,940 --> 05:02:32,380
Please.

5535
05:02:33,520 --> 05:02:34,820
Oh my god, it's...

5536
05:02:34,820 --> 05:02:35,520
I'm going too fast.

5537
05:02:35,520 --> 05:02:37,240
That is actually not registering.

5538
05:02:41,300 --> 05:02:41,940
Oh, okay.

5539
05:02:42,380 --> 05:02:43,460
Don't look at the vent.

5540
05:02:43,560 --> 05:02:44,520
Just throw it this way.

5541
05:02:44,640 --> 05:02:45,840
Just look like this.

5542
05:02:47,560 --> 05:02:48,080
Just...

5543
05:02:48,080 --> 05:02:49,900
Just look at that.

5544
05:02:51,600 --> 05:02:52,760
Don't look at the...

5545
05:02:53,380 --> 05:02:54,740
Don't look at it.

5546
05:02:54,940 --> 05:02:55,460
Just...

5547
05:02:55,460 --> 05:02:56,060
Just do it.

5548
05:02:56,740 --> 05:02:58,320
Okay, don't look at it.

5549
05:02:58,900 --> 05:03:00,160
Where the scissors at?

5550
05:03:02,460 --> 05:03:03,640
Wait, where's the scissors?

5551
05:03:05,760 --> 05:03:07,160
Where's the scissors, guys?

5552
05:03:07,300 --> 05:03:08,080
Oh, it's right here.

5553
05:03:11,370 --> 05:03:12,770
Alright, there we go.

5554
05:03:14,730 --> 05:03:15,330
No vent.

5555
05:03:15,770 --> 05:03:17,450
I don't judge my girl.

5556
05:03:20,410 --> 05:03:21,670
I don't judge her.

5557
05:03:26,120 --> 05:03:29,240
Do I eat and then play video games after?

5558
05:03:29,540 --> 05:03:30,360
I don't remember.

5559
05:03:30,500 --> 05:03:31,320
Oh wait, yeah, I do.

5560
05:03:32,040 --> 05:03:33,040
Alright, here we go.

5561
05:03:34,160 --> 05:03:35,400
I got you with the scissors.

5562
05:03:37,340 --> 05:03:39,540
Let me sit down.

5563
05:03:41,000 --> 05:03:41,360
Alright.

5564
05:03:44,160 --> 05:03:46,180
Yes, I'll take the sauce this time.

5565
05:03:47,180 --> 05:03:49,500
I'm sorry for not taking your sauce last time.

5566
05:03:49,620 --> 05:03:50,340
I just...

5567
05:03:50,340 --> 05:03:52,480
I just didn't want ketchup on this.

5568
05:03:52,800 --> 05:03:53,980
Like, ketchup is for fries.

5569
05:03:54,300 --> 05:03:55,380
And fries only.

5570
05:03:55,880 --> 05:03:56,960
And I guess hot dogs.

5571
05:03:57,920 --> 05:03:59,520
I don't know what this is.

5572
05:03:59,940 --> 05:04:02,500
I legitimately don't know what we're eating.

5573
05:04:09,890 --> 05:04:10,970
Alright.

5574
05:04:16,190 --> 05:04:16,570
Alright.

5575
05:04:17,270 --> 05:04:18,090
Bon appétit.

5576
05:04:18,570 --> 05:04:20,270
How about chat?

5577
05:04:20,650 --> 05:04:20,910
Cool.

5578
05:04:21,330 --> 05:04:22,090
Bon appétit.

5579
05:04:24,810 --> 05:04:26,770
Delicious love.

5580
05:04:36,750 --> 05:04:38,710
What was in that sauce?

5581
05:04:44,130 --> 05:04:45,390
Wait a minute.

5582
05:04:45,570 --> 05:04:47,990
What did you put in my food?

5583
05:04:48,730 --> 05:04:50,090
Wait a minute.

5584
05:04:50,310 --> 05:04:52,010
Guys, I don't think that was ketchup.

5585
05:04:52,910 --> 05:04:55,990
Guys, I don't think that was ketchup.

5586
05:04:56,850 --> 05:04:58,830
Vito, what's going on?

5587
05:05:00,450 --> 05:05:01,810
No, no.

5588
05:05:03,170 --> 05:05:04,550
Oh, she's so quirky.

5589
05:05:04,670 --> 05:05:05,190
That's cute.

5590
05:05:09,310 --> 05:05:11,070
Vito, Vito.

5591
05:05:11,430 --> 05:05:13,850
That was not ketchup, Vito.

5592
05:05:14,350 --> 05:05:16,130
What was in it?

5593
05:05:17,170 --> 05:05:20,010
This isn't FDA approved.

5594
05:05:20,510 --> 05:05:23,170
Did you give me the pink sauce?

5595
05:05:25,090 --> 05:05:28,930
Did you order the pink sauce over the Melican, Vito?

5596
05:05:31,790 --> 05:05:33,650
Oh my god.

5597
05:05:39,290 --> 05:05:41,390
Not the pink sauce.

5598
05:05:43,250 --> 05:05:44,830
Alright, time to take my meds again.

5599
05:05:48,790 --> 05:05:49,490
Alright.

5600
05:05:50,330 --> 05:05:50,650
Gulp.

5601
05:05:51,790 --> 05:05:53,030
Everything will be okay, right?

5602
05:05:55,790 --> 05:05:57,250
I feel great.

5603
05:06:01,220 --> 05:06:03,760
Not Doki 456, we're in a game.

5604
05:06:04,460 --> 05:06:05,840
Things are much simpler here.

5605
05:06:10,930 --> 05:06:11,850
Okay.

5606
05:06:12,090 --> 05:06:13,010
Yippee!

5607
05:06:13,990 --> 05:06:14,910
Simplification!

5608
05:06:24,350 --> 05:06:25,750
I'm scared.

5609
05:06:26,090 --> 05:06:27,350
I know, me too.

5610
05:06:29,450 --> 05:06:34,950
Back when younger Doki was like, nothing's wrong with this game.

5611
05:06:35,490 --> 05:06:37,710
Just a silly game.

5612
05:06:38,770 --> 05:06:43,790
Oh, little did she know, things got a lot worse.

5613
05:06:49,730 --> 05:06:50,870
Yeah, I'm awake.

5614
05:06:53,760 --> 05:06:56,120
Oh fucking hell, I thought I could wait in the living room.

5615
05:06:56,700 --> 05:06:58,040
Please, please.

5616
05:06:59,280 --> 05:07:01,200
I'm so- we're so close.

5617
05:07:01,760 --> 05:07:06,640
We just need to play one game where I beat you in Anime Street Fighter.

5618
05:07:07,080 --> 05:07:07,640
Please!

5619
05:07:09,580 --> 05:07:15,600
In like Milk Street Fighter, I just need to beat you up and then we're- Oh, it's the wrong door.

5620
05:07:16,480 --> 05:07:17,300
There's one door.

5621
05:07:17,480 --> 05:07:18,140
What do you mean?

5622
05:07:18,480 --> 05:07:20,200
There's literally only one door.

5623
05:07:24,300 --> 05:07:25,740
Oh, oh yeah, it's loading.

5624
05:07:25,960 --> 05:07:27,020
Oh, it's still loading.

5625
05:07:27,400 --> 05:07:28,820
Oh, it's still loading.

5626
05:07:29,400 --> 05:07:31,560
Oh, okay, I'm gonna...

5627
05:07:32,560 --> 05:07:34,420
Okay, come- okay, there we go.

5628
05:07:38,430 --> 05:07:39,170
Alright, here we go.

5629
05:07:39,210 --> 05:07:39,590
Come on!

5630
05:07:41,790 --> 05:07:42,310
I'm waiting.

5631
05:07:42,750 --> 05:07:43,950
I'm so ready.

5632
05:07:44,490 --> 05:07:47,150
I'm like ADSing right now.

5633
05:07:47,210 --> 05:07:47,930
I'm getting ready.

5634
05:07:48,790 --> 05:07:50,670
I'm fucking practicing my movement.

5635
05:07:51,190 --> 05:07:51,990
I'm so ready.

5636
05:07:54,330 --> 05:07:56,210
I don't care about the world score.

5637
05:07:56,350 --> 05:07:57,090
Come on, let's go.

5638
05:07:57,330 --> 05:07:59,170
I have the controller right here.

5639
05:08:03,720 --> 05:08:05,940
I'm tap streaming and building speed.

5640
05:08:06,760 --> 05:08:08,440
Alright, thank god.

5641
05:08:08,520 --> 05:08:09,160
Alright, here we go.

5642
05:08:14,460 --> 05:08:15,300
Alright, it's time.

5643
05:08:17,340 --> 05:08:18,000
This game.

5644
05:08:18,540 --> 05:08:20,320
This is the only game I wanna play.

5645
05:08:21,780 --> 05:08:22,120
Alright.

5646
05:08:23,660 --> 05:08:24,220
Let's go.

5647
05:08:24,620 --> 05:08:27,500
After everything you've been through, this is gonna be so therapeutic.

5648
05:08:29,140 --> 05:08:29,940
Alright, get in here.

5649
05:08:30,180 --> 05:08:31,660
I'm not even gonna walk up to you.

5650
05:08:31,720 --> 05:08:32,360
I know you're gonna walk.

5651
05:08:32,440 --> 05:08:32,700
Come on.

5652
05:08:34,440 --> 05:08:35,040
Get over here.

5653
05:08:35,220 --> 05:08:35,700
Get over here.

5654
05:08:35,740 --> 05:08:36,160
Yeah, that's right.

5655
05:08:36,340 --> 05:08:36,820
Get over here.

5656
05:08:37,000 --> 05:08:37,540
That's right.

5657
05:08:38,560 --> 05:08:39,180
Get over here.

5658
05:08:39,240 --> 05:08:39,840
That's fucking right.

5659
05:08:39,900 --> 05:08:40,240
Yeah, yeah.

5660
05:08:40,460 --> 05:08:41,280
Yeah, that's right.

5661
05:08:41,800 --> 05:08:42,300
That's right.

5662
05:08:42,340 --> 05:08:43,520
You can't do anything else.

5663
05:08:44,600 --> 05:08:45,260
Come on.

5664
05:08:47,120 --> 05:08:47,560
Alright.

5665
05:08:48,460 --> 05:08:49,220
I can hold.

5666
05:08:49,420 --> 05:08:49,960
Oh, come on.

5667
05:08:50,280 --> 05:08:50,500
Come on.

5668
05:08:51,340 --> 05:08:51,780
That's right.

5669
05:08:52,780 --> 05:08:54,200
You don't know how to do anything else.

5670
05:08:54,640 --> 05:08:55,860
I'm just gonna be in this corner.

5671
05:09:01,160 --> 05:09:03,420
I don't need to do anything else.

5672
05:09:03,940 --> 05:09:04,800
Let me just stand.

5673
05:09:05,160 --> 05:09:06,200
Alright, come on.

5674
05:09:06,300 --> 05:09:06,940
Get over here.

5675
05:09:07,340 --> 05:09:08,540
Get your fucking ass over here.

5676
05:09:08,620 --> 05:09:08,940
Come on.

5677
05:09:09,520 --> 05:09:10,420
It's like auto-aim.

5678
05:09:10,480 --> 05:09:11,540
I don't even have to move around.

5679
05:09:12,260 --> 05:09:13,500
That's okay, right?

5680
05:09:14,020 --> 05:09:14,940
Yeah, that's right.

5681
05:09:15,020 --> 05:09:15,900
That's right, bitch.

5682
05:09:16,700 --> 05:09:17,320
Easy.

5683
05:09:17,720 --> 05:09:18,540
One last one.

5684
05:09:21,960 --> 05:09:22,580
Alright.

5685
05:09:24,020 --> 05:09:24,560
Oh my god.

5686
05:09:24,680 --> 05:09:24,900
Wait.

5687
05:09:25,180 --> 05:09:25,400
Wait.

5688
05:09:25,820 --> 05:09:26,840
Wait, she's learned.

5689
05:09:28,920 --> 05:09:29,540
Wait.

5690
05:09:29,920 --> 05:09:32,740
Wait, she actually learned.

5691
05:09:34,280 --> 05:09:38,660
Wait, the AI actually learned how to fight me.

5692
05:09:39,180 --> 05:09:40,540
Holy shit.

5693
05:09:40,540 --> 05:09:43,040
The AI learned.

5694
05:09:43,640 --> 05:09:45,200
Holy fuck.

5695
05:09:46,080 --> 05:09:47,060
Oh my god.

5696
05:09:47,700 --> 05:09:49,880
The AI actually learned.

5697
05:09:50,280 --> 05:09:52,180
That's crazy.

5698
05:09:54,970 --> 05:09:55,730
Oh my god.

5699
05:09:55,790 --> 05:10:02,180
The AI actually learned how to...

5700
05:10:04,100 --> 05:10:05,240
Oh my god.

5701
05:10:05,380 --> 05:10:06,160
It actually adapted.

5702
05:10:07,060 --> 05:10:09,040
Oh my god.

5703
05:10:09,280 --> 05:10:10,500
Oh my god.

5704
05:10:10,760 --> 05:10:11,860
I can't believe.

5705
05:10:11,860 --> 05:10:16,620
I can't believe it actually adapted to my place.

5706
05:10:20,170 --> 05:10:22,090
Oh my god.

5707
05:10:23,570 --> 05:10:25,470
I can't believe it worked.

5708
05:10:25,870 --> 05:10:29,750
I was not expecting the AI to actually work.

5709
05:10:32,470 --> 05:10:33,730
Oh my god.

5710
05:10:34,810 --> 05:10:37,450
Oh my god, it actually figured out how I played.

5711
05:10:37,570 --> 05:10:39,310
Okay, we just need to play one game, right?

5712
05:10:40,190 --> 05:10:43,690
We just need to play one game, right?

5713
05:10:45,310 --> 05:10:46,730
It never learned.

5714
05:10:46,870 --> 05:10:49,070
It actually copied my moves.

5715
05:10:49,370 --> 05:10:50,010
Yeah.

5716
05:10:51,230 --> 05:10:53,610
It literally copied my moves.

5717
05:10:53,730 --> 05:10:55,790
That was fucking crazy.

5718
05:10:56,630 --> 05:11:04,350
It copied my entire moveset.

5719
05:11:05,990 --> 05:11:08,470
Yeah, the AI is dangerous.

5720
05:11:09,870 --> 05:11:11,190
Alright, we're ready.

5721
05:11:17,610 --> 05:11:19,630
Alright, we figured it out.

5722
05:11:23,290 --> 05:11:27,190
Alright, put that card down.

5723
05:11:32,490 --> 05:11:34,590
Alright, I'm taking my cards.

5724
05:11:37,010 --> 05:11:37,730
Okay.

5725
05:11:41,630 --> 05:11:43,030
Nobody wins this game.

5726
05:11:43,030 --> 05:11:45,070
I will make sure of it.

5727
05:11:46,570 --> 05:11:47,630
Okay, what was it?

5728
05:11:47,710 --> 05:11:48,910
Wait, actually, I...

5729
05:11:48,910 --> 05:11:49,470
Was it heart?

5730
05:11:49,630 --> 05:11:51,270
Okay, nobody's gonna win this game.

5731
05:11:51,330 --> 05:11:52,230
I'm gonna make sure of it.

5732
05:11:52,470 --> 05:11:53,310
Wait a minute.

5733
05:11:54,310 --> 05:11:55,290
That's fucked up.

5734
05:11:55,330 --> 05:11:56,530
I don't have a 10.

5735
05:11:57,490 --> 05:11:58,550
Wait a minute.

5736
05:12:00,050 --> 05:12:03,050
Oh my god, I actually don't have a...

5737
05:12:03,050 --> 05:12:05,810
Wait, it's rigged against me now.

5738
05:12:11,630 --> 05:12:13,110
They rigged it.

5739
05:12:14,930 --> 05:12:16,130
Wait, what?

5740
05:12:17,750 --> 05:12:19,070
Oh, I have a 10.

5741
05:12:19,170 --> 05:12:20,370
Okay, that's great.

5742
05:12:23,630 --> 05:12:25,230
Last time I had...

5743
05:12:25,230 --> 05:12:26,470
No, last time...

5744
05:12:26,470 --> 05:12:32,190
Last time, it made it so that every time she put her cards down, I have like...

5745
05:12:32,190 --> 05:12:32,950
I have...

5746
05:12:32,950 --> 05:12:35,250
I had a card to counter it.

5747
05:12:40,080 --> 05:12:42,260
Oh my god, that's so fucked.

5748
05:12:43,220 --> 05:12:44,440
That's so fucked.

5749
05:12:45,280 --> 05:12:48,680
That's actually so fucked that they rigged it against me this time.

5750
05:12:49,020 --> 05:12:50,860
Like, we had the perfect score.

5751
05:12:52,360 --> 05:12:53,720
We had...

5752
05:12:53,720 --> 05:12:55,700
We had such a good score.

5753
05:12:56,500 --> 05:12:58,680
She's on new game plus right now.

5754
05:13:08,050 --> 05:13:10,310
She had the Santa outfit buff.

5755
05:13:10,390 --> 05:13:10,650
Yeah.

5756
05:13:15,670 --> 05:13:16,490
We're here.

5757
05:13:17,110 --> 05:13:18,290
We're here now.

5758
05:13:19,610 --> 05:13:20,790
We're here now.

5759
05:13:20,870 --> 05:13:21,430
This is it.

5760
05:13:24,450 --> 05:13:25,190
This is it.

5761
05:13:25,710 --> 05:13:26,650
I'm gonna open the wardrobe.

5762
05:13:32,250 --> 05:13:32,710
Alright.

5763
05:13:35,490 --> 05:13:37,290
Oh my god, finally.

5764
05:13:37,930 --> 05:13:38,750
We made it.

5765
05:13:40,830 --> 05:13:42,130
Yeah, why are you hiding there?

5766
05:13:55,990 --> 05:13:56,510
No,

5767
05:14:03,260 --> 05:14:03,720
I don't.

5768
05:14:03,820 --> 05:14:04,900
I actually don't wanna know.

5769
05:14:05,640 --> 05:14:09,880
After everything I've been through, I wish I was never given that option to know.

5770
05:14:11,280 --> 05:14:14,600
I wish I wasn't.

5771
05:14:16,720 --> 05:14:17,960
I'm gonna stay.

5772
05:14:18,780 --> 05:14:19,660
Yeah, that's right!

5773
05:14:20,460 --> 05:14:20,980
Yeah, that's right!

5774
05:14:20,980 --> 05:14:21,320
Yes!

5775
05:14:24,660 --> 05:14:28,660
We're gonna be together forever, even if you're a little crazy.

5776
05:14:29,140 --> 05:14:31,140
But we're all a little crazy inside.

5777
05:14:36,140 --> 05:14:37,940
We fixed her!

5778
05:14:39,800 --> 05:14:41,060
We did it!

5779
05:14:41,820 --> 05:14:42,980
We fixed...

5780
05:14:45,600 --> 05:14:47,700
Oh my god.

5781
05:14:48,460 --> 05:14:49,020
I fixed her.

5782
05:14:49,820 --> 05:14:50,760
Wait, what?

5783
05:14:53,940 --> 05:14:54,620
Oh my god.

5784
05:14:55,220 --> 05:14:55,940
We're gonna be together.

5785
05:14:55,940 --> 05:14:57,680
I'm like that guy with the collar.

5786
05:14:57,860 --> 05:14:58,520
Remember that guy?

5787
05:14:58,680 --> 05:14:59,620
That's me now.

5788
05:15:00,140 --> 05:15:01,720
Oh my god.

5789
05:15:03,560 --> 05:15:05,560
We're gonna be together forever.

5790
05:15:09,450 --> 05:15:10,870
Goodbye, phone.

5791
05:15:11,410 --> 05:15:11,910
Goodbye.

5792
05:15:16,170 --> 05:15:18,710
Peaceful mode now available?

5793
05:15:19,590 --> 05:15:21,390
What is that?

5794
05:15:24,090 --> 05:15:26,570
Wait, what is peaceful?

5795
05:15:29,350 --> 05:15:31,810
What is peaceful mode?

5796
05:15:32,690 --> 05:15:34,790
This mode is still in development.

5797
05:15:34,970 --> 05:15:36,770
It's so expansive that...

5798
05:15:36,770 --> 05:15:40,490
I don't even get to access peaceful mode.

5799
05:15:41,390 --> 05:15:42,190
Okay.

5800
05:15:43,550 --> 05:15:44,350
Okay.

5801
05:15:44,670 --> 05:15:46,950
I don't even get to access it.

5802
05:15:47,270 --> 05:15:48,130
That's fine.

5803
05:15:48,710 --> 05:15:51,190
I never wanted to access it anyway.

5804
05:15:52,610 --> 05:15:57,010
I did 30 minutes of that and I literally just get...

5805
05:15:57,350 --> 05:15:59,990
I get transported into a...

5806
05:15:59,990 --> 05:16:01,770
It was a 5 second ending.

5807
05:16:02,210 --> 05:16:04,190
I feel so scammed.

5808
05:16:04,530 --> 05:16:07,890
I feel so fucking scammed.

5809
05:16:08,790 --> 05:16:16,130
I had to go through that entire area for 5 seconds of an ending.

5810
05:16:16,790 --> 05:16:18,370
It's alright, I fixed it.

5811
05:16:18,990 --> 05:16:21,030
It was worth it.

5812
05:16:21,110 --> 05:16:22,530
What do you mean?

5813
05:16:22,910 --> 05:16:24,370
What do you mean it was...

5814
05:16:24,370 --> 05:16:25,090
You're right.

5815
05:16:25,310 --> 05:16:26,370
You're right, guys.

5816
05:16:26,650 --> 05:16:27,050
You're right.

5817
05:16:27,130 --> 05:16:27,790
I fixed it.

5818
05:16:27,930 --> 05:16:29,670
Everything was worth it in the end.

5819
05:16:29,870 --> 05:16:30,610
I fucking...

5820
05:16:30,610 --> 05:16:33,250
I fucking fixed it.

5821
05:16:40,350 --> 05:16:41,430
Holy shit.

5822
05:16:41,510 --> 05:16:42,770
That was fun though.

5823
05:16:43,130 --> 05:16:45,610
Actually, I really enjoyed that game.

5824
05:16:45,610 --> 05:16:51,530
As someone that went in blind with no idea...

5825
05:16:51,530 --> 05:16:53,610
Actual zero...

5826
05:16:55,950 --> 05:16:59,150
Zero knowledge of the game itself.

5827
05:16:59,350 --> 05:17:04,270
That was actually surprisingly an incredibly fun game.

5828
05:17:05,210 --> 05:17:08,670
Other than the part where the fucking red eyes...

5829
05:17:08,670 --> 05:17:10,830
Oh my god, that shit scared the fucking shit out of me.

5830
05:17:10,910 --> 05:17:11,370
The weeping...

5831
05:17:11,370 --> 05:17:13,530
The weeping Mitas was not it.

5832
05:17:14,290 --> 05:17:18,650
The weeping Mitas actually was not fucking it.

5833
05:17:18,730 --> 05:17:21,310
That was my only...

5834
05:17:21,310 --> 05:17:25,590
That was the only thing that I was not...

5835
05:17:25,590 --> 05:17:29,530
I was not okay with.

5836
05:17:32,750 --> 05:17:35,010
That was so scary.

5837
05:17:35,390 --> 05:17:37,390
I was so fucking scared.

5838
05:17:40,050 --> 05:17:42,530
But other than that...

5839
05:17:42,530 --> 05:17:46,310
Other than that, I had a great time playing it.

5840
05:17:46,570 --> 05:17:48,670
It honestly was...

5841
05:17:48,670 --> 05:17:49,830
Was really fun.

5842
05:17:49,970 --> 05:17:52,530
I really enjoyed the...

5843
05:17:55,010 --> 05:17:56,090
The Miisai.

5844
05:17:56,750 --> 05:17:59,490
And I honestly hope Miisai doesn't get the...

5845
05:17:59,490 --> 05:18:01,410
I feel like it's going to get crazy fandom.

5846
05:18:01,730 --> 05:18:06,510
Because it is a very interesting game and I feel like the fandom is going to be incredibly fucking crazy too.

5847
05:18:09,550 --> 05:18:12,050
Which is the downside for a really good game.

5848
05:18:12,050 --> 05:18:15,790
A really good game, but I feel like it's going to get an absolutely crazy fandom.

5849
05:18:18,170 --> 05:18:19,390
Probably, yeah.

5850
05:18:23,530 --> 05:18:26,370
But yes, I definitely would...

5851
05:18:26,370 --> 05:18:26,870
I don't know.

5852
05:18:27,030 --> 05:18:30,390
I feel like this is a game that you have to play blind to really enjoy it.

5853
05:18:31,190 --> 05:18:34,410
But now I understand why a lot of people were like...

5854
05:18:34,950 --> 05:18:37,010
Why the game had so many reviews.

5855
05:18:37,310 --> 05:18:39,630
Surprisingly, I didn't see a lot about it on Twitter.

5856
05:18:39,630 --> 05:18:43,210
I think it's also because of the fact that...

5857
05:18:43,790 --> 05:18:46,870
My Twitter algorithm is literally just Marvel Rivals now.

5858
05:18:47,090 --> 05:18:48,890
And occasional VTuber stuff.

5859
05:18:49,170 --> 05:18:51,570
So I think that's why I don't see a lot about it.

5860
05:18:51,770 --> 05:18:53,950
I don't see a lot about it.

5861
05:18:53,970 --> 05:18:56,530
Because it came out not too recently.

5862
05:18:56,770 --> 05:18:58,570
It came out two weeks ago.

5863
05:18:58,950 --> 05:18:59,630
I would honestly...

5864
05:19:00,250 --> 05:19:04,070
I just found out about this game yesterday.

5865
05:19:04,770 --> 05:19:06,490
No, I didn't find out about it.

5866
05:19:06,610 --> 05:19:09,590
I found out about this game the day I...

5867
05:19:09,630 --> 05:19:10,570
Made my schedule.

5868
05:19:10,870 --> 05:19:13,870
So I honestly didn't hear much about it.

5869
05:19:13,870 --> 05:19:15,910
Until the day I made my schedule.

5870
05:19:16,750 --> 05:19:17,450
So...

5871
05:19:17,450 --> 05:19:21,390
I'm glad that I came in super blind.

5872
05:19:22,710 --> 05:19:23,830
And everything.

5873
05:19:24,570 --> 05:19:26,650
But yeah, I had a great time.

5874
05:19:27,170 --> 05:19:29,720
I would like to stay long, but I am...

5875
05:19:30,150 --> 05:19:31,030
Tired.

5876
05:19:31,690 --> 05:19:33,630
I'm tired now.

5877
05:19:34,990 --> 05:19:37,450
But thank you all for coming everybody.

5878
05:19:37,450 --> 05:19:38,450
I hope you guys...

5879
05:19:40,090 --> 05:19:41,530
Enjoyed watching me play.

5880
05:19:41,950 --> 05:19:44,090
I guess the one thing I would like to show is...

5881
05:19:44,090 --> 05:19:46,490
If you're going to be in Hong Kong in January 11th.

5882
05:19:46,490 --> 05:19:48,190
I will have a fan meeting there.

5883
05:19:48,510 --> 05:19:50,870
I'm going to have a fan meeting there in Hong Kong.

5884
05:19:51,590 --> 05:19:52,630
On January 11th.

5885
05:19:53,190 --> 05:19:54,850
So yeah, please check that out.

5886
05:19:55,110 --> 05:19:55,650
And visit...

5887
05:19:55,650 --> 05:19:57,310
Buy a ticket if you can.

5888
05:19:57,410 --> 05:19:58,150
And see me there.

5889
05:19:58,610 --> 05:19:59,950
I'm trying to find the link to it.

5890
05:20:00,110 --> 05:20:01,770
There's like a lot of stuff.

5891
05:20:02,050 --> 05:20:03,830
I'm trying to find the link to the thing.

5892
05:20:05,210 --> 05:20:06,270
Give me a sec.

5893
05:20:06,270 --> 05:20:09,070
Let me find the link to the thing.

5894
05:20:09,470 --> 05:20:10,870
Before I go.

5895
05:20:11,730 --> 05:20:13,810
Oh my god, unless my mod has it.

5896
05:20:13,930 --> 05:20:15,130
But like, there's so many.

5897
05:20:15,170 --> 05:20:15,890
Oh, there it is.

5898
05:20:16,190 --> 05:20:16,630
There it is.

5899
05:20:16,690 --> 05:20:18,150
If you're going to be there.

5900
05:20:18,390 --> 05:20:22,290
I have the link right here.

5901
05:20:22,610 --> 05:20:23,270
Oh, they made...

5902
05:20:23,270 --> 05:20:24,370
Oh yeah, here's the video.

5903
05:20:25,650 --> 05:20:26,050
Yes.

5904
05:20:26,550 --> 05:20:27,710
Buy tickets.

5905
05:20:28,230 --> 05:20:29,570
To the fan meet.

5906
05:20:30,950 --> 05:20:31,490
In...

5907
05:20:31,490 --> 05:20:33,510
In Hong Kong.

5908
05:20:34,170 --> 05:20:36,590
I would really appreciate it.

5909
05:20:38,450 --> 05:20:40,930
Because they're working really hard on organizing all of that.

5910
05:20:41,050 --> 05:20:43,450
So I would love to have people there.

5911
05:20:43,770 --> 05:20:44,450
Hey guys!

5912
05:20:45,730 --> 05:20:46,210
Anyway.

5913
05:20:47,070 --> 05:20:49,350
I just want to say thank you all for coming.

5914
05:20:49,730 --> 05:20:51,190
As always, everybody.

5915
05:20:51,390 --> 05:20:52,330
Stay hydrated.

5916
05:20:52,510 --> 05:20:53,050
Posture check.

5917
05:20:53,970 --> 05:20:55,710
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5918
05:20:55,850 --> 05:20:56,790
And if you used that for me.

5919
05:20:57,030 --> 05:20:57,630
Head to bed.

5920
05:20:57,750 --> 05:20:59,010
Because you deserve it.

5921
05:20:59,450 --> 05:21:01,510
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5922
05:21:02,310 --> 05:21:03,110
Bye guys.

5923
05:21:03,550 --> 05:21:03,950
Bye!

5924
05:21:04,530 --> 05:21:07,730
Sorry I can't have a longer chill out session.

5925
05:21:08,010 --> 05:21:09,890
I didn't think I'd be streaming this long today.

5926
05:21:10,070 --> 05:21:10,850
To be fair.

5927
05:21:11,130 --> 05:21:12,690
But I really want to finish the game today.

5928
05:21:13,090 --> 05:21:14,850
So like, that's why I need to like...

5929
05:21:14,850 --> 05:21:15,750
I need to like...

5930
05:21:15,750 --> 05:21:16,390
What's the word?

5931
05:21:19,910 --> 05:21:20,310
Fucking...

5932
05:21:21,510 --> 05:21:22,310
Recharge myself.

5933
05:21:22,430 --> 05:21:22,590
Yeah.

5934
05:21:22,830 --> 05:21:24,990
I need to recharge my energy.

5935
05:21:25,410 --> 05:21:27,990
But I hope you guys had a really fun time watching, everybody.

5936
05:21:28,110 --> 05:21:29,830
I wish I could've stayed a little longer today.

5937
05:21:29,830 --> 05:21:31,970
But I am a little tired.

5938
05:21:32,230 --> 05:21:32,450
Awesome.

5939
05:21:32,550 --> 05:21:32,690
Yeah.

5940
05:21:32,790 --> 05:21:33,510
Thank you for the super chat.

5941
05:21:33,570 --> 05:21:33,750
Thank you.

5942
05:21:33,770 --> 05:21:33,990
Thank you.

5943
05:21:34,030 --> 05:21:35,070
I did see your birthday message.

5944
05:21:35,310 --> 05:21:36,710
Happy birthday to you.

5945
05:21:37,050 --> 05:21:38,450
Happy birthday to you.

5946
05:21:38,610 --> 05:21:40,010
Happy birthday, dear Mia.

5947
05:21:40,450 --> 05:21:41,890
Happy birthday to you.

5948
05:21:42,050 --> 05:21:42,350
Yeah!

5949
05:21:43,450 --> 05:21:44,070
Alright, guys.

5950
05:21:44,210 --> 05:21:45,430
I need to walk dad.

5951
05:21:45,550 --> 05:21:46,490
And I need to feed him.

5952
05:21:46,610 --> 05:21:47,470
Because it's 10.

5953
05:21:47,590 --> 05:21:49,530
And that's usually around his feeding time.

5954
05:21:49,890 --> 05:21:51,130
So I'll see you guys, everybody.

5955
05:21:51,410 --> 05:21:51,990
Bye, guys.

5956
05:21:52,330 --> 05:21:52,770
Bye!

5957
05:21:54,750 --> 05:21:55,190
Bye!

5958
05:21:55,550 --> 05:21:55,870
Bye!
