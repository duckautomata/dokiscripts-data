1
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,140
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,380
Oh my God.

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,440
I know.

5
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,160
Surprise sponsor, everyone.

6
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,120
Not on schedule.

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,500
Surprise!

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,080
Today, we're having triple streams.

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,840
Let's go!

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,900
Look, I did say we might not have double streams today, but I didn't say we don't have triple!

11
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,600
Fuck!

12
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,360
But Doki, on your schedule, it says one stream.

13
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,960
Well, after this, I have a collab I have to do right after this.

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm not streaming the collab.

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,700
I'm just gonna show up.

16
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,960
And then after that, I play Silent Hill.

17
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,360
Oh my God.

18
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Oh, baby!

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a triple!

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,340
So, yeah.

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,540
Anyway, surprise!

22
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,780
We have a sponsor today!

23
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,980
For those who don't know about the Ascendant, earlier today...

24
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,540
Not today.

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,500
Sorry, guys.

26
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm a little bit messed up at the moment.

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm getting ready to play Silent Hill, so I didn't take my...

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,100
Guys, it's a joke.

29
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,740
That was a joke.

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,900
That was a joke.

31
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,180
But, like, I'm trying to get into the character of not taking meds.

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,460
Just to make sure my dead wife is still alive.

33
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,160
Anyway, for legal reasons, that's a joke.

34
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,240
Take your meds.

35
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,660
Anyway, we are playing the Ascendant!

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,560
It's out in beta right now, which means you can actually wishlist this game and try out the beta now for free!

37
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:41,920
So, if you want to support the stream and the sponsors, please click on the link in the description or pinned in the YouTube chat.

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,580
And wishlist the game.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,520
It really helps a lot.

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,520
Anyway, for those who don't know the Ascendant, we actually played this before.

41
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,680
I think like a month or two ago.

42
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,420
I've actually lost all concept of time.

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,440
For me, a day passes when I have zero work to do.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,240
And a day has yet to pass.

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,740
I don't know what that feels like in a long time.

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,480
So, I have lost all concept of time.

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,320
I don't even know when some streams... I don't know if you guys know this, but Sage Jam Slam was like...

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,100
The Sage Jam Slam was maybe like... Was it a month ago?

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,660
It was even less than that.

50
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,180
It was like three to four weeks ago or something.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,440
But yes, the first time we played this game, we were not sponsored.

52
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,180
And then we were joking around and like, you know, we were cyberbullying the devs to sponsor us.

53
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,960
And it worked!

54
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,720
The message is not a good message.

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,440
Don't cyberbully people, guys.

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,720
It doesn't work all the time, guys.

57
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,820
It's not a very good message, but it worked.

58
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,720
So, we did it, guys.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
We got sponsored, chat.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,540
From playing the game for free to being paid... to being paid to sign...

61
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,320
Okay, okay, the...

62
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,200
Okay, so, this really fucked up.

63
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,540
But, they were like, oh yeah, we can get you that dev so you can like harass and...

64
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,820
If you really want... It was so funny watching you harass our dev like that.

65
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,280
If you really want to, you can play with him again and then you can...

66
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,800
You can harass him again.

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,840
So, I was like, okay, I'll do an hour.

68
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,460
I just wanted an hour of just like, hanging out with you guys.

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,000
I was just like, I was just like, what the fuck?

70
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,440
So, it worked, guys.

71
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,260
We offered this dev as a sacrifice.

72
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,120
Thank you for the superchat.

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,380
Thank you, thank you.

74
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,040
It's not a very good message.

75
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,480
The moral of the story is, don't cyberbully.

76
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,660
I got paid to, so like, legally, it's okay for me.

77
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm getting paid to be toxic.

78
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,760
It's all just fun and jokes, guys.

79
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,860
It's all just...

80
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,300
Anyway, guys.

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:50,120
Like I said, feel free to check out the link in the description and pin on the YouTube chat.

82
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,700
You might even be able to get into my lobbies today, too, if you downloaded it already.

83
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,900
For those who don't know...

84
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,920
Alright, get ready, guys.

85
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,480
It might sound like I'm reading off of something.

86
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,970
Because you're like, wow, Doki, I've never seen you so articulated before.

87
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,410
But look, this is part of the sponsored, okay?

88
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,210
But...

89
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:21,650
Ascendant is a groundbreaking squad-based tactical FPS set in a vibrant retro-futuristic biopunk world.

90
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,210
So it's like in the 80s.

91
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,090
You guys have already seen it before, but basically it's like in the 80s and stuff.

92
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,210
It revolutionizes the genre with its unique adaptation mechanics.

93
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,830
Offering an ever-changing battlefield where strategy and adaptability are key.

94
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,090
And you gotta engage in intense 3v3v3v3...

95
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,790
Oh god, that's a lot of 3s.

96
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:52,630
PvP battles navigate ever-evolving landscapes and secure vital resources in a world where every match is unpredictable and different.

97
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,370
There was no way for me to say this in any natural way that I usually talk.

98
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,010
So it's clear.

99
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,310
But yeah, you can play it right now!

100
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,350
There's a chance to get into my lobbies.

101
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,090
My lobby is literally in NA.

102
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,790
Yeah, I know, it sounds very natural, guys.

103
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,690
Everyone, please clap.

104
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,550
Everyone, please clap and download the game now.

105
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,490
Anyway, let's try this again.

106
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,170
I sort of forgot how to play this game.

107
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,230
My brain is like...

108
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,210
After a long time, I'm like, how do I play this game again?

109
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,830
Oh, I got achievements!

110
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,990
Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.

111
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,650
I was like, who the fuck is talking to me?

112
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,490
Wait, am I alone?

113
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,850
Is there nobody?

114
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,950
Oh no, there's a real person!

115
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,330
Hey, real guy!

116
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,750
Is he real?

117
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,030
Oh my god, wait, these are all the stuff.

118
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,690
These are all the stuff I got from the other bait.

119
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,750
Is this a real guy?

120
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,510
I don't think he's real.

121
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,150
I can't tell.

122
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,950
Are there any real people in my lobby?

123
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,390
Wait, I remember there's like the 1v1 stuff here.

124
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,390
Like, I know the lobby is like super interactive.

125
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,530
Hey, I'd like to see what you're selling.

126
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,270
Do I have money?

127
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,330
Wait, I know my devs are watching.

128
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,370
Devs, if you're here right now, can you like give me...

129
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,270
All I'm saying...

130
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,380
Devs, my account...

131
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,350
What is my account's name?

132
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,270
Devs, if you're watching...

133
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,500
Wouldn't it be so funny...

134
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,300
If like, I try to buy something...

135
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,680
And then my account money...

136
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,900
And then I don't...

137
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,400
Oh hey, Jackie!

138
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,500
Daytona!

139
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,360
And then like, you know, I go into this...

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,000
And then all of this is like...

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,060
I don't know...

142
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
100,000 coins?

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
That'd be so...

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,500
It'd be so fun...

145
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,620
Chat, wouldn't you guys think that'd be the funniest thing you've ever seen?

146
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,840
And it's gonna make you guys wanna download and wishlist the game...

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,000
Even more, chat!

148
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,260
No!

149
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,780
Guys, come on!

150
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,840
It would be so funny!

151
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,500
Doki, they're already giving you actual money...

152
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,440
And you want virtual?

153
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,160
Yes!

154
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,280
Guys, you always... You gotta take your shot, guys!

155
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,740
Like, you always have to take your shot!

156
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,340
Oh!

157
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,380
Okay, I remember...

158
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,460
Oh yeah, by the way...

159
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,600
The lobby has like, a lot of...

160
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,420
Different things...

161
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,200
Cause I remember there was like, hide and seek...

162
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
There was like, 1v1s...

163
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,200
Oh, there's a spider now?

164
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,980
What the fuck does the spider do?

165
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,480
Um, there's the hide and seek over here...

166
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,560
We've done that...

167
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,440
And then the tryhards going under...

168
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,300
The tryhards who played the game like, 200 million times...

169
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,640
One, of course...

170
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,760
Um...

171
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,300
And then there's...

172
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,900
Who asked me if I was in the right version?

173
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,860
Don't make me paranoid!

174
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm like...

175
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm pretty sure I'm on the right version of the game...

176
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,700
And then there's...

177
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,260
What's this?

178
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,820
I know there's like...

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,780
There's like, a lot of places I didn't explore...

180
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,740
All I did was went straight into the game...

181
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,960
Wait, I wanna customize...

182
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,300
I know there's like, customization too...

183
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,580
By the way...

184
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Devs, I don't know if you know my username...

185
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,540
But it's definitely not Tokibert...

186
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,820
Maybe you got a little confused...

187
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,920
And that's why I don't have like...

188
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,260
$100,000 coins in my...

189
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,440
In my inventory...

190
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Maybe that's why I gave it to like...

191
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,240
Tokibert, but like, not Tokibert...

192
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,820
Because you're thinking, that can't be Tokibert...

193
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,280
There's no...

194
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,040
There's no way...

195
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,820
There's no way that's Tokibert...

196
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,200
That's all I'm saying...

197
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,500
Oh wait, what does he say?

198
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,560
Sport modules...

199
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,740
Oh, it's like...

200
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,780
It's more attack...

201
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,200
I don't need those...

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,440
Much off of my teammates...

203
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,960
Jesus, spoiled his...

204
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,440
I deserve things!

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,870
I deserve it!

206
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,960
Oh, and then you have like...

207
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,920
Abilities and perks...

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
So you can customize your...

209
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,640
Abilities and stuff...

210
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,880
I remember, everybody had like...

211
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,220
All the abilities in the fucking world...

212
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,300
And then I got shit on...

213
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,400
Because I didn't know how to play the game back then...

214
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,420
But I do now!

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,620
I do now, guys!

216
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,880
So now, I'm gonna shit on these fools...

217
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,400
Buy a custom weapon?

218
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,500
I don't need a custom weapon...

219
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I have all I need...

220
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,200
Alright, let's go over here...

221
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,580
Uh...

222
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,620
Do I need anything else?

223
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,360
Okay, I have extra space...

224
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,220
I have a shield...

225
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,500
I have all of this...

226
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,460
There's no way I'll get shit on...

227
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,020
I'm a gamer...

228
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,300
I don't even know if this is my current sensitivity...

229
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,800
We'll see...

230
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,360
Uh...

231
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,060
Alright, guys...

232
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,480
Don't worry...

233
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,540
Because when you're new, you didn't know what to do...

234
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,500
But now you do!

235
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,980
So all you have to do...

236
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,640
You see this computer over there?

237
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
You see that computer?

238
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,120
You customize...

239
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
Don't forget to do this...

240
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,460
When I first played...

241
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,500
I forgot to do that...

242
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,980
And don't forget to talk to...

243
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,520
Talk to the ladies...

244
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,300
To buy stuff...

245
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,420
Because then...

246
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,680
Now you know!

247
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Now you know!

248
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,900
I'm here to make sure you don't make the same mistakes like me...

249
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,680
Now you know!

250
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,760
Make sure to talk...

251
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,600
I know talking to people is very difficult...

252
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,420
But like...

253
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,060
I know, guys...

254
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,240
You gotta learn how to talk to all these women and men...

255
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
You see the exclamation points?

256
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,440
You gotta buy these things...

257
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,260
I know it's very hard...

258
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,900
And they're very handsome and pretty...

259
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
But you have to learn to talk to women...

260
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,900
To get the things you need...

261
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,700
You guys...

262
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,520
And sometimes men as well...

263
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,920
You gotta learn how to talk to the men as well...

264
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,220
To get the things you need...

265
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,780
Guys...

266
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,020
I know it's very difficult...

267
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,920
But I believe in you guys...

268
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,540
This is how you're gonna learn...

269
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,900
This is how you're gonna learn...

270
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,340
Why can't I just talk to them online?

271
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm fine...

272
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,300
And there's like...

273
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,660
This is like...

274
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,560
My reputation is not...

275
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh wait...

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,740
Do I give my 1?

277
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,520
I shouldn't give him upgrades...

278
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,920
And stuff...

279
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,660
For cosmetics...

280
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,340
That sounds terrible...

281
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,100
I need to upgrade my ability...

282
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,720
I know...

283
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,400
Oh, but then I would look so good, though!

284
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,380
If I upgrade my cosmetics, they'll know I'm fucking styling.

285
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,280
They'll know my reputation.

286
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,840
It's so high, so then they won't cyber-bully me.

287
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,300
They'll be like, oh my god, that girl's pretty fucking cool.

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,100
We won't cyber-bully her.

289
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,660
Oh, I think the shotgun was my favorite.

290
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,640
I didn't like the sniper, because the sniper at a low level is not as good.

291
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,600
I think the shotgun, as a beginner, was the best.

292
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,240
But yeah, you can customize, basically customize weapons and characters and everything.

293
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,580
Does anyone remember how to customize the person?

294
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
I mean, I'm already perfect right now.

295
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,000
He's perfect, but like...

296
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,200
I mean, look at me.

297
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,900
I'm already...

298
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,740
Does anyone remember how to customize the person?

299
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,460
Like, I don't really want... I mean, he's perfect already, but like, I'm just wondering.

300
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,200
No game audio?

301
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,300
I'll make sure... I'll boost up the game audio a little bit.

302
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,640
I mean, look at him.

303
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,900
He's even wearing a fucking crop top, too.

304
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,940
Peak performance, you'd say?

305
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,820
Yeah, exactly.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,940
I'd say he's even peak performance right now.

307
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,860
Alright, I guess we're ready to play.

308
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,800
We're ready.

309
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,600
We're ready to game, guys.

310
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,960
If you downloaded the game, you might have a chance to play with me right now.

311
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,620
I don't need tutorial.

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,220
Famous last words.

313
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,840
I don't need the tutorial.

314
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,160
I don't need the tutorial.

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,540
I can... I remember.

316
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,020
I played... I played... I played games where I had to farm.

317
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,560
Alright.

318
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,920
Here we go.

319
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,780
Oh, it's teams of two.

320
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,980
Oh, I did the game mode.

321
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,560
Alright, guys.

322
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,060
Remember when I said it's 3v3v3v3?

323
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,480
It's 2v2v2v2 now.

324
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,220
Guys, I should have read.

325
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,040
I chose the game mode where it's 2v2v2v2.

326
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,580
Guys, it's okay.

327
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,260
We're learning to read as well.

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,400
Alright.

329
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,000
Alright, we gotta beat up the snails.

330
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,420
We gotta beat these guys up.

331
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,640
And then we gotta get... Oh, hey, nice.

332
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,480
I got armor already.

333
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,880
Look at that.

334
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,140
Okay, I'm... See, I told you guys I can remember how to play video games.

335
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,940
Oh my god, this guy's played.

336
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
Wait, this guy's played longer than me.

337
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Wait, how does... Wait, he knows where all the snails are.

338
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,100
Yeah, we gotta farm snails.

339
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,440
Oh, there you are.

340
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,700
There you are.

341
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,580
That's fucking right.

342
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,520
Give me your money.

343
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,380
Alright, so I remember we gotta farm snails.

344
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,700
And then... And then after that, you use them to buy stuff.

345
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,720
So, I mean... Don't worry.

346
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,340
He knows how to play the video games.

347
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,300
So, like, I believe it.

348
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, hey, that's a blue snail.

349
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,300
That's blue.

350
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,220
He should have more stuff, right?

351
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,680
Okay, money.

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,280
Alright.

353
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,640
Guys, we're here to make sure that the snails... What are snails good for anyway?

354
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,120
Oh, shit.

355
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,220
Oh, shit.

356
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,000
Like, we're here to destroy the snail population.

357
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,720
Don't be like, no, my snail... You guys never gave a shit about these snails.

358
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,700
Don't fool me.

359
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,080
I know you guys didn't care.

360
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,360
For the French, then we definitely need to get rid of... Oh, my God.

361
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,280
Oh, why is it two?

362
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm leading them to my teammate.

363
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,600
Oh, hey, nice.

364
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,460
There's more snails.

365
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,500
Nice.

366
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,240
Yeah, see, they're invasive species.

367
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,800
I'm just trying to... Did you guys know that we have...

368
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,680
This is a really... Guys, this is not a fun fact, but fun fact.

369
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,500
We have eliminated 75% of the wildlife population.

370
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,780
And I'm gonna make sure it's 76%.

371
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
All right, where is my teammate going?

372
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,960
Where are you going?

373
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,080
I hope I'm not open mic.

374
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,580
Oh, wait, no, I shouldn't be.

375
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,920
There's no way.

376
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,980
Let's try... Whoa.

377
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,840
Whoa.

378
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,300
Oh, I forgot I have limited ammo.

379
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,580
I should use my pistol.

380
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,800
I knew I forgot something.

381
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,700
I should have been using my pistol.

382
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,640
Wait, he's leaving me.

383
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,760
Okay,

384
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,580
wait, he's leaving me.

385
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,480
Why are you leaving me?

386
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,560
We gotta... We gotta buy stuff.

387
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,300
We gotta do the thing.

388
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,400
Where the fuck is he going?

389
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,500
Hello?

390
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,460
Did I just leave him?

391
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,100
It's like, I thought we had to be a team player, sir.

392
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Oh my god, they're all just... Wait, wait, wait.

393
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
Are you still farming?

394
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,260
What is there to farm?

395
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,200
They're just snails.

396
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,720
Solo queue moment.

397
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,140
Where are you going, sir?

398
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,800
Wait, I can slide.

399
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,400
Are you still farming?

400
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,420
Guys, this is not MOBA.

401
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,960
He really, really hates the snails.

402
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,840
Doki, you don't understand.

403
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,020
You don't understand.

404
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,200
Bro, we're not playing a MOBA right now.

405
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,680
Get back in here.

406
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,500
Is this like... Is this their house?

407
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,220
Oh, it is.

408
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
Where's our house?

409
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,900
Oh, where's our house?

410
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,580
I like... Oh, no.

411
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,180
Where's our house?

412
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,180
Where did we live?

413
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,760
He got me so... Oh, it's over... Where is... Oh my god, our house is all the way over there.

414
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,760
This guy got me so confused that we never went back to our home.

415
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,720
Alright, I'm heading to my house.

416
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,240
He's not even going home.

417
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,020
Why don't you want to go home, sir?

418
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,700
This is our house.

419
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,200
And then... locate... Alright.

420
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,380
Nice, we did it.

421
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,800
Okay, there we go.

422
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,460
We did it.

423
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,800
I have zero... Like, my teammate is so far away.

424
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Like, I don't know what his plans are.

425
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,280
Oh, my plans are this, though.

426
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,560
That's my plan.

427
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,620
Oh, I got the bush!

428
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,500
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,320
That's my plan.

430
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,620
That's always been my plan.

431
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,680
What's going to happen to me?

432
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm going to die?

433
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,500
That would be silly.

434
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,960
That would be so silly.

435
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,140
Oh, wait.

436
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,140
Can I take their gun?

437
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,260
Is this better?

438
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,780
Oh, no.

439
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,660
It's just the same.

440
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,860
Oh, the shop's closed.

441
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,600
Oh, my god.

442
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm so... Don't worry.

443
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,840
He's farming.

444
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,140
Maybe he's aiming for late game.

445
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,520
Look, late game is very important.

446
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,140
I'm going to head to the shop.

447
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,380
I don't know what he's doing, but I'm heading to... He's still farming, guys.

448
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,140
Don't worry!

449
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,060
Are you serious?!

450
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm

451
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,870
farming this!

452
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,970
Oh, my god.

453
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh, my god.

454
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,380
Give me.

455
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,720
Give me.

456
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,580
Oh, my god.

457
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,080
Give me.

458
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,740
Give me.

459
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,660
Give me.

460
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,480
Where do I deposit?

461
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,300
Where do I...

462
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,560
There we go.

463
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,100
Oh, give me.

464
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,120
Oh, my god.

465
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,440
Okay.

466
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,940
Okay.

467
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,680
All right.

468
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,380
All right.

469
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,200
We did it.

470
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,260
I don't know what I did, but we did it.

471
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,200
Let's try.

472
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,720
Let's buy this right now.

473
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,320
I don't know.

474
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,420
I don't know.

475
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,120
Is this better?

476
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,380
I don't know.

477
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,060
I'm fucking panicking right now.

478
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,160
Oh, that's fine.

479
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,140
That's fine.

480
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm trying to figure shit out right now.

481
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,520
I don't know what we did, but we did it.

482
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,980
Oh, shit.

483
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,500
Don't worry.

484
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,560
I'm heading... No!

485
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,580
Voxel, you farm so much!

486
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
What was the point of farming?!

487
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,120
Oh, what the fuck?

488
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
No.

489
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,720
Oh, okay.

490
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,220
That's fine.

491
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,060
Give me the fucking loot.

492
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,460
That's fucking right.

493
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,580
You there!

494
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

495
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,420
I'm sorry.

496
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,080
I literally just killed two.

497
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,300
I'm so fucking sorry.

498
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,440
Oh, shit.

499
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,200
Wait, where?

500
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,380
Oh, my god.

501
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,980
That's fucking right.

502
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,040
That's fucking right.

503
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,240
Give me your... Goddamn shit.

504
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,860
Bitch.

505
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,600
You there.

506
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,420
Fucking...

507
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,780
You fucking there.

508
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,880
I can't believe he was like, are you there?

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,420
Come deposit!

510
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,720
Fucking, I'm going to deposit you.

511
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,100
Get over here.

512
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,200
I'm fucking letting my anger out on these fucking snails.

513
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,760
Oh, my god.

514
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,260
I'm fucking... I'm heading over!

515
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,260
You don't get it.

516
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,720
The snails killed his family.

517
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,220
He has to have his revenge.

518
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,160
James, thank you for the super chat.

519
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,720
Thank you.

520
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,540
Thank you.

521
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm coming over.

522
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,220
I'm fucking... I'm heading over.

523
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,900
You stupid fucking... Oh, I'm heading over with your goddamn money.

524
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,060
What do you... What do you want me to do?

525
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,240
Oh, he's going to die?!

526
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,860
Bro!

527
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,560
Oh, my god.

528
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:11,920
How?

529
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,720
Oh, my god.

530
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,620
Um, where are you?!

531
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Ah, shit!

532
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,320
Ah, you're dead!

533
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,820
Okay, that's fine.

534
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm fine.

535
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,520
That's not my fault!

536
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,500
That's on him for dying!

537
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,800
It's not my fault he's bad!

538
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,960
It's literally not my fault when people are bad.

539
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,660
Oh, my god!

540
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,240
No!

541
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,500
I didn't even see this fucking... Okay, I still have four more lives.

542
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,500
I still... It's fine.

543
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,380
It's fine.

544
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,100
I have four more lives.

545
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,320
I can't... My money!

546
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,820
My... No!

547
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,120
How could I deposit?

548
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,700
I couldn't.

549
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,880
I couldn't deposit.

550
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,320
I... I wanted to.

551
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,180
Okay, don't worry.

552
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,080
I got a fucking steward.

553
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,920
It's not my fault they're bad.

554
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,840
Good shot.

555
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,160
Bro, he doesn't believe in me!

556
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,220
He fucking insta-dies!

557
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,340
Look, all I'm saying is that if they're dead, then, like, we win automatically.

558
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,680
Wait, where?

559
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,220
I don't even see them.

560
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,220
Oh.

561
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,920
There we go.

562
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,080
Oh, I need... I need your heals.

563
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,500
I need your shit.

564
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,900
Okay.

565
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,660
Oh, my god.

566
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,900
I bet the money... I don't even know where I died, guys.

567
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,660
I don't even know where I...

568
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,060
I don't even know I'm... Oh, shit.

569
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,950
Okay, there we go.

570
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,290
Get down!

571
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,910
Get out of my fucking lobby!

572
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,030
That's fucking right!

573
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,630
I don't need heals!

574
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,510
Get out of my lobby!

575
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,590
Guys, we should do the objective.

576
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,150
Okay.

577
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,410
Alright, here we go.

578
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,490
Don't worry!

579
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,290
I'll actually do some!

580
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,010
Oh, my god.

581
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,110
Don't worry.

582
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,930
Don't worry, I'll figure this... No, I forgot to punch him!

583
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,330
Don't worry.

584
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,890
I'm fucking heading over.

585
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,070
Oh, god.

586
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,810
I... It'll be fine.

587
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,590
That's the worst that could happen.

588
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,850
Oh, he's fucking... We all... We have to work together, bro.

589
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,730
We... Bro, other guy!

590
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,770
We had... Bro, why did... Please!

591
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,150
We had to work together against him!

592
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,790
It was objective.

593
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,550
We have to get the blue thing.

594
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,550
Oh, I swear to god.

595
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,030
I swear to god.

596
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,170
Bro, he's so low.

597
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,210
Like, I got him so fucking low, man.

598
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,270
I swear... Oh, you... Oh!

599
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,550
I cracked him and everything!

600
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,110
I... I don't know.

601
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,710
I cracked him.

602
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,610
Oh!

603
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,990
I even cracked him, bro!

604
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:51,270
Guys, I don't think my teammate and I are... Guys, my teammate and I, we don't work together very well.

605
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,870
I think he's mad at me.

606
00:29:54,170 --> 00:30:01,030
I guess... I guess I'm not a team player, guys.

607
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,950
A team player.

608
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,050
Hey, hey, even if I'm not a team player, I'm getting these frags, though.

609
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,070
Yeah, guys, it's not my fault.

610
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,610
It's not my fault my teammate's bad.

611
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,950
It's okay.

612
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,750
It's alright, guys.

613
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,970
Bro, he was like farming for 200 years!

614
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,050
It's not my fault!

615
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,110
I got impatient!

616
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,290
I was like, stop farming!

617
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,110
We fight!

618
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,650
We fight and steal their farm.

619
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,650
That's how I fight.

620
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,170
I fight by stealing their farm.

621
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:56,730
It's like, basically, you gotta farm to grab items, to buy items, and then, like, get these objectives.

622
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,170
But, like, I'm a fragger, so...

623
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,870
And then, beating up snails gets you money and also, it gets you... Oh, shit, we don't want that.

624
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,970
It gets you money and HP back.

625
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,750
That's why... I have a purpose to beating up the snails.

626
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,230
It's not because I... It's a hate crime.

627
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,810
Like, they actually give me back my HP.

628
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,650
So, like, it's not because I'm a fucked up individual.

629
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:32,170
I literally need to beat them up for health.

630
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,350
That's what they all say.

631
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,650
Doki, it can be two things.

632
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,950
What the fuck?

633
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,090
Oh, shit.

634
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,550
Oh, what the fuck?

635
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,530
Bro, this is not fair.

636
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,370
BRO!

637
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,650
YOU HAVE A PERSON THAT ACTUALLY PLAYS WITH YOU!

638
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,690
My teammate fucking collapsed!

639
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,450
I should've just waited.

640
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,090
I should've just waited until...

641
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,210
I should've fucking waited until another team shows up.

642
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,210
Okay.

643
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,550
Don't worry.

644
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,250
It'll be fine.

645
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:19,910
We'll be fine.

646
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,450
I believe.

647
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,350
We'll just play the weight game.

648
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,170
We'll be little rats.

649
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,310
We can do this.

650
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,630
We'll just be little fucking rats, guys.

651
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,350
We can do this.

652
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:33,650
Truly.

653
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,270
Look.

654
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:42,610
Although I wasn't a team player, it's his fault that he didn't play for...

655
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,030
It's his fault that he didn't play around me.

656
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,630
I came from Overwatch.

657
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,950
You gotta play around the one trick.

658
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,770
I am the one trick.

659
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,970
I hear shooting.

660
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,810
Oh, it's over there.

661
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,390
Oh my god.

662
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,250
What the fuck is that?

663
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:11,690
Oh wait.

664
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,690
I dropped my shield.

665
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,510
SHIT!

666
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,150
He's using a shield that had nothing!

667
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,350
What the fuck is...

668
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,930
Okay, that shit scared me.

669
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,310
I was like, oh hey, shield.

670
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,590
If I click that, is that me?

671
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,130
What fucking...

672
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,230
Why is there a giant gorilla slapping me around?

673
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,990
It smells revenge.

674
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,350
It's okay.

675
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:38,770
It's okay.

676
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,630
They purposely... I still have two more lives.

677
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,150
It's fine.

678
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,610
That's fine.

679
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,150
It smells fire in the head.

680
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,290
Wait, where are they?

681
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:49,970
Oh.

682
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,510
Oh, okay.

683
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,190
We gotta kill him.

684
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,010
He came out of his shell.

685
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,770
It's fine.

686
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,810
Look, this is why we gotta kill all the snails.

687
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,730
This is what happens.

688
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,850
This is literally what happens when you don't kill all the snails.

689
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,150
What is he just standing there?

690
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,930
He's not even moving.

691
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,960
Oh my god.

692
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,600
I don't even know where he was.

693
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,520
Where he landed on.

694
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,200
Guys, I'm scared of the giant hitman.

695
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,820
Oh wait, that was him with the...

696
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,700
No, there's no way.

697
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,120
What the fuck?

698
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,120
Is that his gorilla?

699
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
Don't worry.

700
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm heading over.

701
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,600
I'm gonna run him off.

702
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
He thinks he can get away.

703
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,980
I have a car.

704
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,420
Is that his pet gorilla?

705
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,660
Bro, it is!

706
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,820
That's actually...

707
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,040
I'm literally getting shot at by his...

708
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,900
What the fuck?

709
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,900
Holy shit!

710
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,200
He has a fucking pet gorilla!

711
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,880
No!

712
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh my god!

713
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,300
Help!

714
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,600
I want a fucking pet gorilla!

715
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,980
Giant ass monkey.

716
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,660
I thought he was chasing him.

717
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,160
I didn't realize.

718
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,520
I didn't realize.

719
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,320
It was literally...

720
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,460
It was literally his pet.

721
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,520
Holy...

722
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,500
How do I win this?

723
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,780
I'm one man.

724
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,280
That's why I farm.

725
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh my god.

726
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,080
If I knew I could have bought a giant fucking gorilla by farming, I would have been back in the snail territory.

727
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,660
Just for that, I'm gonna crush you like a great, great, great ape, Vegeta.

728
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,880
Oh my god!

729
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,900
Bro!

730
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,860
Is it just me and him?

731
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,280
Oh my god.

732
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,040
You know what?

733
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,440
I'm fine.

734
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,880
I don't want to fight him anyway.

735
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,580
I'm fine.

736
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,860
I didn't want to fight that guy anyway.

737
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,920
I don't know about you guys.

738
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,000
He had a fucking gorilla on his team.

739
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,760
Wait, wait, wait.

740
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,600
I'm just like, yo, I'm fine with that.

741
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,260
I'm...

742
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,540
Bro, sick this creature.

743
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,940
Butcher.

744
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,520
Oh my god, that's all he did.

745
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,440
But your teammate wanted to buy...

746
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,100
Bro, that's all he did.

747
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,800
I told you, that's all he did.

748
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,740
All he did was farm the gorilla.

749
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,560
Okay, that was funny.

750
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,780
Guys, okay, guys.

751
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,000
Guys, if you play...

752
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,500
If you're good at this game, you can buy a fucking gorilla.

753
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,420
Yes, I would like to play this again.

754
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,000
Why?

755
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,440
Because I love this game so much.

756
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,840
And also, I was sponsored.

757
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,020
I was sponsored.

758
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,640
Nice.

759
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,040
Help us improve the performance.

760
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,340
Yeah, that was pretty good.

761
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,320
I got slapped by a gorilla.

762
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,160
There you go.

763
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,120
Nice.

764
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,820
Yeah.

765
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,480
Well, no, actually.

766
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,380
No, because...

767
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,840
I don't think I ever got slapped by a gorilla before.

768
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,420
Yeah.

769
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,920
Yeah, the gunplay is.

770
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,100
Please tell us anything.

771
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,300
I've never been slapped by a giant gorilla in an FPS game before.

772
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,620
Oh, shit!

773
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,540
Winston!

774
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,740
Shit, sorry.

775
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,900
But I've never been slapped by a giant gorilla.

776
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,960
That was not Winston.

777
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,100
Winston.

778
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
There we go.

779
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,860
There we go.

780
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,780
Hey, not last!

781
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,500
Not last!

782
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,940
I got...

783
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,720
You guys know this.

784
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,200
This is that.

785
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,040
See, guys?

786
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,240
Not last.

787
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,620
That couldn't talk.

788
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,320
True.

789
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,320
Wishlist now?

790
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:30,820
Oh, yeah, guys.

791
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,020
Remember to wishlist the game.

792
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,420
Oh, I saw that.

793
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,380
Maybe lower my sound effects.

794
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,420
Let me...

795
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,340
Where's the options?

796
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,060
Audio.

797
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,540
Sound effects.

798
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,220
I'll lower the sound effects a little bit.

799
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,480
Alright.

800
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,880
Well, now I know.

801
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm gonna buy some guns.

802
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,260
I'm gonna buy some guns after that.

803
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,040
Which one's the gun seller?

804
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,660
Map.

805
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,360
Alright, so these are all the things that we can buy.

806
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh, hey!

807
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,480
Is that me?

808
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,920
Oh, these are other people's games!

809
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,320
Ctrl -Shift-B.

810
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,200
Alright, let's see.

811
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,460
You know what?

812
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,100
Fuck it.

813
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,020
I'm gonna buy this.

814
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,180
I'm gonna buy this.

815
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,220
I think I'll need it.

816
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,740
It's like a shield.

817
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm gonna buy a fucking gorilla.

818
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,820
Okay.

819
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,740
After this, we're gonna ask the devs, how the fuck do I get a gorilla on my team?

820
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,040
Okay.

821
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,860
Oh, wait.

822
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,220
Oh, okay.

823
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,040
This is for a carrier ability.

824
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,580
I should have read better.

825
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,300
I should have read better.

826
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
I thought I could use that the entire...

827
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,540
That's fine.

828
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,060
Now I know, guys.

829
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,820
Guys, now every day, I learn to read a little better.

830
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,840
Chat, that's my goal in life.

831
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,640
Alright, what do they have?

832
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,080
Oh, combat perks!

833
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,120
Do I afford it?

834
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, no.

835
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,420
Receive from at least any dodge that I would kill or down you while at least this can only trigger once every 20... Oh, wait!

836
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,400
No, I like that.

837
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,120
What's my reputation?

838
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,580
Oh, my god.

839
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,960
This guy wants so much money from me.

840
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,660
This is still not...

841
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,900
Oh, my god.

842
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,320
Guys, my reputation went up one, but I still can't afford it.

843
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,800
It's okay.

844
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,720
It's okay.

845
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,100
One day, I'll be just as cool.

846
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,900
One day.

847
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,380
One day, I'll be just as cool as all the other people around here.

848
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,180
Alright.

849
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,280
This time.

850
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,920
This time.

851
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,360
This time.

852
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,800
This time will be better.

853
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,840
This time will go better.

854
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,320
I believe.

855
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,480
I...

856
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,740
I believe.

857
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,140
This time, my teammate will be better.

858
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:17,360
And if not, we're grabbing the Devon here and then he's gonna make me the fucking strongest gun ever and then we're gonna win.

859
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,540
And then we'll win.

860
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,680
The moment...

861
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,380
The moment we get that Devon, it's over for the lobby.

862
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,680
Like, it's not even gonna be fair for this lobby.

863
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,520
Alright, who's my... Oh, he's live, guys.

864
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,360
Okay.

865
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,920
I think the shotgun is the best, honestly, for...

866
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,820
Okay, he might have to change his gun's name, though.

867
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,720
It's not a pocket!

868
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,600
I just...

869
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,320
He just has everything in the game!

870
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,140
He has the best guns!

871
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,640
At that point, it's just GG's!

872
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,260
I win by sh... Guys, it's not... Guys, I have the... I have the aim.

873
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,020
I just need the right gun.

874
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:05,760
Hahaha!

875
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,500
The devs are pocketing me.

876
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,660
Alright, all... Look, I'm not an objective person.

877
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,460
All I...

878
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,880
I'm a fragger.

879
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,840
So, all you do is feed me kill... Feed me the people and then do the objective.

880
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,380
I'm not the... I'm not the Lucio on the cart.

881
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,160
I've been the Lucio on the payload for way too long.

882
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,640
It's my turn to kill.

883
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,860
I'm gonna... Must kill all these snails.

884
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,860
Like, I beat up so many snails.

885
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,880
That should be enough, right?

886
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,680
Alright, get over here.

887
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,420
Get your ass over here.

888
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,640
Get your fucking ass over here.

889
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,820
Get your... Hahaha!

890
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,340
Hahaha!

891
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,620
That's fucking right.

892
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,040
Get your ass over here.

893
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,000
Alright.

894
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,600
I think I can deposit.

895
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,080
That's where our... Yeah, that's our house.

896
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,440
I can deposit a little bit.

897
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:58,900
Oh wait.

898
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,720
Eighty... Oh my god, that's not enough.

899
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,080
Alright, let's see.

900
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,560
Climb up.

901
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,780
Okay, here we go.

902
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,080
Alright, activate.

903
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,660
I remember.

904
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,800
We gotta activate this and then we can see where things are.

905
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,960
Unlocks a tier 2.

906
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,780
Oh!

907
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,080
Okay, I want a tier 2 actually.

908
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,960
So it guarantees that I'll have a blue shield.

909
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,500
Alright, I need five more snails.

910
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,020
God, where's the... Where the fuck is the... Where the fuck... Oh, there they are.

911
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,600
Oh, I see you.

912
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,100
You know what?

913
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,900
I don't really care about... Oh wait, maybe it has...

914
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,100
I need to go over for the money.

915
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,820
I was gonna say...

916
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,780
You have to, like, go up and pick up the money, too.

917
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,340
See, guys?

918
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,380
I'm not that stupid.

919
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,960
I can remember things.

920
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,880
Okay, we gotta...

921
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh, hey, another snail.

922
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,580
Get your ass over here.

923
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,200
Get your fucking ass over here.

924
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,360
Oh my god, nice.

925
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:00,960
Tier 2.

926
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,440
And then more money.

927
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,820
Alright, that's good enough.

928
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,720
We got this.

929
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,120
Watch this, guys.

930
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,060
I'll show you how a gamer fucking works.

931
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,900
Alright, do I need to buy stuff?

932
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,420
No, right?

933
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,540
I don't know...

934
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,780
I don't know if I should.

935
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,820
I should, actually.

936
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,220
I'm gonna go to the shop.

937
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,620
I don't know if I can afford anything.

938
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,060
I can't remember how expensive things are.

939
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,640
Alright, watch this.

940
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,980
You see that gust over there?

941
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,600
Watch this, guys.

942
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,480
Weeeew.

943
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,580
Wait, what's that?

944
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,860
That's purple.

945
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,840
Is that the shop?

946
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,620
Why is it purple?

947
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,800
Oh, okay.

948
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,160
Shop time.

949
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,080
Can I afford anything?

950
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,900
Uh...

951
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,760
Okay.

952
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,600
Um...

953
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,500
Oh...

954
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,780
Wait.

955
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,880
How come you can afford stuff?

956
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:10,810
Wait, what?

957
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,830
How is...

958
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,950
How...

959
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,390
How did he buy that gun?

960
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,090
I thought he was broke like me.

961
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,710
No!

962
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,250
I need one dollar!

963
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,210
I actually...

964
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,190
I actually...

965
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,970
No,

966
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,540
no, no, no, please.

967
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,420
No, no.

968
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,000
No!

969
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,480
That's fucking right.

970
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,680
That's fucking right.

971
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,960
That's right, I'm gonna smack your ass.

972
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,000
That's fucking right.

973
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,080
Get your ass smacked right now.

974
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,480
Oh my god, I got that one dollar.

975
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:00,880
Yippee!

976
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,140
Wait, where's the shop?

977
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,260
Wait, where did the shop go?

978
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,960
Oh my god.

979
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh my god, I went the wrong way.

980
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,160
I was so excited.

981
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,700
I jumped down.

982
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,160
Okay, nice.

983
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,040
I can afford it now.

984
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:14,660
Let's go.

985
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,300
Okay.

986
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,340
Buying.

987
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,120
This has to be better.

988
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,660
This has to be better, because it's...

989
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,660
It says it's...

990
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,740
Okay, 119.

991
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,100
We should get a medkit.

992
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,080
I feel like I always need a medkit.

993
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,860
Wait, no, I'll grab a shield.

994
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,100
Alright, there we go.

995
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,800
Alright, here we go.

996
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,360
Okay, what is this gun, though?

997
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,760
Alright, don't worry!

998
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,100
Oh my god, this guy knows what he's doing.

999
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,880
Don't worry, I'm heading over!

1000
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,420
I'm coming over!

1001
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,460
I'll be a hero.

1002
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,920
I'll be a hero.

1003
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,000
Wait, who is he getting shot at?

1004
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,750
It's so bad.

1005
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,910
I'm gonna walk in a straight line and you won't be able to shoot shit.

1006
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,750
Bro, if that sniper was in my hands, it'd be over.

1007
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,450
Come on, where are you?

1008
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,110
That's not even right.

1009
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,850
Oh, it's you again!

1010
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,850
Oh, it's you again!

1011
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,910
You know what?

1012
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,110
Give me that sniper.

1013
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,750
Now that it's in my hands, I'll show you how it's done.

1014
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,650
That's not even right.

1015
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,150
I'm gonna slap that ass again.

1016
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:47,190
Show you how it's really done.

1017
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,850
I'm not sorry.

1018
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,290
Shouldn't we go over and get the fucking thing?

1019
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,370
Why are we going for A?

1020
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,270
I would love to farm that one guy.

1021
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,150
Over and over again.

1022
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,970
I recognize those cheeks.

1023
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,210
Wait, where's my teammate doing?

1024
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:20,590
Don't we wanna get to that guy?

1025
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,920
Oh my god, I'm climbing.

1026
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,300
I like how...

1027
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,900
Oh my god, wait, that's really far.

1028
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:29,680
You know what?

1029
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,980
No, he can have that.

1030
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,240
I saw how far it was and I'm just like, you know what?

1031
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,980
You can have that.

1032
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,280
You can have that.

1033
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,620
My laziness has won today.

1034
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm good.

1035
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,420
I'm okay.

1036
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,120
Wait, what?

1037
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,080
Oh, it's a bot.

1038
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,400
It's not even real.

1039
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,340
Is he trying to shoot?

1040
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,560
Who is he trying to shoot at?

1041
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,800
Oh!

1042
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,480
Oh shit!

1043
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:09,840
Okay.

1044
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,080
Oh, please leave me alone.

1045
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,620
I need this.

1046
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,340
Okay, now I know.

1047
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:19,800
Oh no.

1048
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,020
Was I him talking?

1049
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:35,860
I couldn't tell if it was in-game VC or not.

1050
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,520
Okay, nice, I killed him.

1051
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,180
Where is our...

1052
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:42,840
Where's my guy?

1053
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,200
Oh, there he is.

1054
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,040
How the fuck did you get...

1055
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,920
Oh, he's dead.

1056
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,080
Oh, he died.

1057
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,120
I was like, who's talking?

1058
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,240
Who's trying to interact with me?

1059
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,840
This is an interact-free zone.

1060
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,920
Oh no, no!

1061
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,540
I just shot him already!

1062
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,820
Oh my god!

1063
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,460
Okay, yeah, no.

1064
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,520
He's definitely talking.

1065
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,100
He's real.

1066
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,960
No, he's a real person, guys.

1067
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,200
Just sus.

1068
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,660
Wait, how do I heal?

1069
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,570
Sus, bro.

1070
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,990
Guys, I know my guy's a real person, guys.

1071
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,560
Where...

1072
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:41,820
What?

1073
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,390
Where's the fight?

1074
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,950
Oh, underneath!

1075
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,390
Okay.

1076
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,270
I didn't have to, but I did.

1077
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,150
I was contested.

1078
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,890
Oh, I didn't...

1079
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,550
Oh my god, I didn't hear him!

1080
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,510
Oh my god.

1081
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,610
I didn't hear him!

1082
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,230
I'm so stupid!

1083
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,690
It's just fucking ridiculous.

1084
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,870
This kid's gotta be cheating.

1085
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,320
This guy's mad.

1086
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,200
This guy's mad already.

1087
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,360
Bro, why is he so mad?

1088
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,440
No, I forgot to deposit!

1089
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,420
No, I'm a whitey shield.

1090
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,200
I'm a whitey shield.

1091
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,870
I did not expect that.

1092
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,940
I did not.

1093
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:58,420
Bro.

1094
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,080
Fuck kills me, he's cheating.

1095
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,480
Oh my god, wait!

1096
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,200
Oh my god, I thought he died already.

1097
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,380
I was gonna be like...

1098
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,500
I knew that.

1099
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,240
Yeah, I believe it.

1100
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,860
Oh my god, the toxicity.

1101
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,680
He has one life.

1102
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,540
Please don't die.

1103
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,500
You have one life left, please.

1104
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,000
I don't wanna be alone again, bro.

1105
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,560
I can't.

1106
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,360
Wait, there's a snail.

1107
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,540
Maybe he has blue shield.

1108
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,400
Okay.

1109
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,820
Just here for the blue shield.

1110
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,720
He didn't have blue shield, guys.

1111
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:34,900
There's...

1112
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,320
I'm like a little lost.

1113
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,000
Time to carry the...

1114
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,140
No, not again.

1115
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,280
Not again, please.

1116
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,280
There's too much pressure.

1117
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,720
I need to get...

1118
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,240
What?

1119
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,080
The fuck does that mean?

1120
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,140
What does that mean?

1121
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,060
A dinosaur?

1122
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,440
Oh, she...

1123
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,500
Become the...

1124
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,160
Oh!

1125
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,480
Oh my god, I'm gonna be the monkey!

1126
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,780
It's over.

1127
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,380
I'm him.

1128
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,960
How do I get out?

1129
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,520
Oh my god.

1130
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,260
It's so fucking over.

1131
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,700
Now I know how he did it.

1132
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,540
Now I'm him.

1133
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,540
Bro, what do you want me to do?

1134
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,380
Do you want me to go in?

1135
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,880
I fucking know.

1136
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,920
Bro, bro.

1137
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,140
Now I understand.

1138
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,300
Protect...

1139
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,200
Friend.

1140
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,840
Doki got a parkour.

1141
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,100
Give me a sec.

1142
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,200
Gorilla has a parkour.

1143
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,920
Gorilla has to take the stairs.

1144
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,800
Gorilla trying to figure out how stairs work.

1145
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,080
Whoa!

1146
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,600
Gorilla getting shot at!

1147
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,180
I don't know from where!

1148
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,460
Bro, do I heal from this?

1149
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,040
I don't.

1150
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,740
I don't know where I'm getting shot at.

1151
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,080
Give me intel!

1152
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,500
Oh my god, it wasn't wildlife.

1153
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,660
It was an actual giant fucking person.

1154
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,040
He gave me all the comms and then suddenly no comms as the gorilla.

1155
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,080
What does he want from me?

1156
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,680
I heal.

1157
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,420
Oh, he got it.

1158
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,900
I'm heading over.

1159
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,780
Don't worry.

1160
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,520
Where is he?

1161
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,640
Where is he?

1162
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,180
Where is he?

1163
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,000
Where is he?

1164
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,120
Gorilla don't speak people, Doki.

1165
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,380
What do you want me to do?

1166
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,300
I don't...

1167
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,280
Oh my god, gorilla getting shot at.

1168
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,340
Gorilla scared.

1169
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,700
Gorilla has no idea where shots are coming from.

1170
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,740
I'm like the most confused monkey there is.

1171
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,660
Like, it's above me.

1172
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,620
It's fucking above me.

1173
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,320
Okay, he's gonna regret this.

1174
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,300
Gorilla jump!

1175
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,320
Where is he?

1176
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,460
Where?

1177
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,660
Where?

1178
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,400
I'm just trying to figure...

1179
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,020
Where?

1180
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,620
Oh shit, he's heading a nuke over.

1181
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,840
Oh my god.

1182
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,940
Oh, there he is.

1183
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,040
He's a fucking coward.

1184
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,320
I see him now.

1185
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,520
I'm gonna spit on him.

1186
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,800
I'm gonna spit on this guy.

1187
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,860
I see you.

1188
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,620
I see you.

1189
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm gonna fucking head over soon.

1190
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,500
That's right, there is a drop off.

1191
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,220
There's drop off, that's right.

1192
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,340
I fucking figured out the drop off.

1193
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,300
That's fucking right.

1194
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,000
I figured it out.

1195
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,080
I figured out the drop off.

1196
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,280
You think I don't know?

1197
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,500
You think I don't know the drop off?

1198
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,240
You think you can just do that?

1199
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,320
You think...

1200
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,440
You think you can just do that and things will be okay?

1201
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,320
He's like...

1202
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,040
I'm gonna spit on you.

1203
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,600
I'm gonna fucking...

1204
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,740
I'm gonna spit on you.

1205
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,340
Fuck, I'm ready.

1206
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,620
I'm mad.

1207
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,920
I'm fucking ready.

1208
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,940
Where are you?

1209
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,720
Oh, that's fucking right.

1210
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,300
That's fucking right.

1211
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:21,980
Get over here.

1212
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,280
Oh my god, I'm too fucking thick.

1213
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,380
Get over here.

1214
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,840
Oh, get over... I'm too thick right now.

1215
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,480
I got... Where did he go?

1216
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,320
I wanna kill one person.

1217
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,620
I swear to god.

1218
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,260
Just...

1219
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,340
Oh, you think... Oh, I see you.

1220
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,440
You think you can get away from me?

1221
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,480
You think that's right?

1222
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,080
That's fucking...

1223
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,320
Oh my god, that's right.

1224
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,280
That's fucking right.

1225
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:48,560
Oh!

1226
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,880
Jesus Christ.

1227
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,560
Is this not...

1228
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,760
There we go.

1229
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,920
He thought he could get away.

1230
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,060
What's my purpose?

1231
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,780
What is my purpose?

1232
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,960
Is my purpose just Roman?

1233
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,340
I don't know what my purpose is anymore.

1234
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,120
What is my purpose?

1235
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,240
Human!

1236
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,660
Human!

1237
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,840
What is my purpose?

1238
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,400
What is my purpose?

1239
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,840
I don't know what my purpose is.

1240
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,540
He's farming!

1241
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,160
I'm following him!

1242
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,020
I thought he was gonna do something with me!

1243
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,920
That's it, I'm heading over the sea.

1244
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,980
I'm heading over...

1245
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,700
Monkey business.

1246
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,840
That's your purpose.

1247
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:56,140
I thought we were gonna get sea together!

1248
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,140
What happened?

1249
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,400
Oh, shit!

1250
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,520
Ah!

1251
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,220
Ah!

1252
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,480
That's right!

1253
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,660
Yes!

1254
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,120
Oh, I spit on your grave.

1255
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,740
That's fucking right.

1256
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,600
Where are you?

1257
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,160
Oh.

1258
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,400
Wait, where's sea?

1259
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,280
Oh, there's sea.

1260
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,140
Where's my guy?

1261
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,620
Oh, he's dead?

1262
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,040
Oh, no.

1263
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,160
I can't pick that up.

1264
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,560
I'm unable tonight.

1265
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,260
I don't get anything for that.

1266
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,380
Wait.

1267
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,740
Did they put it in the truck?

1268
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,360
Is it in the truck?

1269
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,960
Oh, it's... Oh, my God!

1270
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,600
It's a ray!

1271
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,900
Are you serious?

1272
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,640
Like, I don't... Oh, my God!

1273
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,600
What was that point?

1274
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,580
There he is.

1275
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,260
You can shoot him, shoot him.

1276
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,460
Yeah, shoot him.

1277
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,500
That's right.

1278
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,860
And I'll shoot you, too.

1279
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,580
Oh, I spit on you.

1280
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,640
What the fuck?

1281
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,140
What the hell?

1282
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,480
That's right.

1283
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,340
I need a heal.

1284
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,860
Gorilla heal.

1285
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,500
What?

1286
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,200
How is he...

1287
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,680
Why is he still talking about cheating?

1288
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,100
I've been gorillaing all this entire time.

1289
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,620
He's still fucking talking about the guy that's cheating?

1290
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,980
It's been 20 years.

1291
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,240
Let it go.

1292
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,700
It's been 20 years.

1293
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,980
Like, let it go.

1294
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,280
20 years have passed since we fought the guy.

1295
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,840
I'm literally a giant gorilla.

1296
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,720
You gotta let it go, bro.

1297
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,420
This is my gun now.

1298
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,880
This is my gun.

1299
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,420
Please.

1300
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,860
Where's my teammate?

1301
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,340
I've been spitting at people for 20 years.

1302
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,420
Where's my teammate?

1303
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,380
I can't pick it up.

1304
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,620
Bro, he's dead.

1305
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,440
I can't even pick it up.

1306
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,700
I'm a giant gorilla.

1307
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,080
That's the worst part.

1308
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,080
Bro, the best I can do is spit on people.

1309
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,100
I can't pick it up.

1310
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,840
He's dead.

1311
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,400
I'll just do this.

1312
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,160
Get out of here.

1313
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,100
I just wanna kill him.

1314
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:56,620
That's it.

1315
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,860
That's fine.

1316
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,520
I did my job.

1317
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,940
Monkey dead.

1318
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,580
I killed him though.

1319
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:19,020
Guys, I got so many kills by just guarding that one area for 20 years.

1320
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,900
Monkey hours are over.

1321
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,240
Oh my god.

1322
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,480
Oh my god.

1323
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,040
Oh my god.

1324
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,560
For 50 years.

1325
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,260
I fucking spit on so many people.

1326
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,760
Oh my god.

1327
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,380
Are they an enemy?

1328
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,790
Oh my god, he's working together.

1329
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:56,890
I guess we'll both work together to kill that one guy together.

1330
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:58,750
Come on.

1331
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,590
We can work together to kill him together.

1332
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:04,650
He has to go this way.

1333
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,250
That's fucking right, I knew it.

1334
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,210
What are you doing?

1335
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,170
What is he doing?

1336
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,490
What are you doing?

1337
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,540
Give me a sec.

1338
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,220
I'm just reloading.

1339
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,620
That's fucking right.

1340
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,100
That's right.

1341
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,500
That's right.

1342
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,540
My turn.

1343
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,400
No!

1344
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,000
We'll win this.

1345
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:52,640
No!

1346
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,720
I wanted to melee him to death.

1347
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,400
No, the melee didn't.

1348
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,400
I'll crawl away.

1349
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,000
I'll crawl away.

1350
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,820
Bro, the pistol has no ammo.

1351
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,920
I thought I could win by sheer melee.

1352
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,080
I'm just gonna crawl away.

1353
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,060
There's no way.

1354
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,680
I'm gonna crawl away until I'm there.

1355
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,360
I'm gonna crawl away until I'm there.

1356
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,160
Okay, we have two more lives.

1357
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,480
I did not in fact win that.

1358
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,700
Okay.

1359
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:31,640
Okay.

1360
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,380
I got killed by him.

1361
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,800
How many lives does he have left?

1362
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,560
I don't know.

1363
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,440
I wish I was him.

1364
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,220
There's no reds.

1365
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,720
There's no way.

1366
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,500
There's no reds left.

1367
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:43,960
There's no way.

1368
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,460
Okay, we'll see.

1369
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,480
How far away is it?

1370
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,100
It's not that far.

1371
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,320
There's hope.

1372
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:50,840
It's not that far.

1373
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,800
We can make it.

1374
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
It's him again.

1375
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,400
He thinks he can get away?

1376
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,280
He really thinks he can get away.

1377
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,640
Guys, he's getting away.

1378
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:07,960
Guys.

1379
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,120
What the fuck?

1380
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,260
Guys, he's getting away.

1381
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,040
Guys, I think he is getting away.

1382
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,540
Oh my god.

1383
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,920
Wait, he is.

1384
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,440
He really is.

1385
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:27,920
Holy shit.

1386
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,940
He really is.

1387
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,420
He's fucking with me.

1388
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,640
He actually is.

1389
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,280
Oh shit.

1390
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,980
Oh my god.

1391
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,640
It's my turn.

1392
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,140
It's my turn.

1393
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,800
Bro, I'm fucking taking your red gun.

1394
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,680
What the fuck?

1395
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,680
Oh my turn.

1396
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,280
My turn.

1397
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,500
Wow.

1398
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,720
This is fine.

1399
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,860
Okay.

1400
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,040
Wow.

1401
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,280
Oh yeah.

1402
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:19,840
Okay.

1403
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,320
Oh my god.

1404
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,620
Oh my god.

1405
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,540
One minute?

1406
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,150
Holy shit, he just goes up and grabs it.

1407
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,790
What the fuck?

1408
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,970
He just walked up and grabbed.

1409
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,170
You can do that?

1410
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,850
Just walk up there and grab it.

1411
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:52,490
He just walked up.

1412
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:53,650
Okay.

1413
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,070
Alright.

1414
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,130
Let's do this again.

1415
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:57,290
Oh my god.

1416
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:02,290
I thought I had more time.

1417
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,030
I legitimately thought I had more time.

1418
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,750
I didn't think he would just walk up.

1419
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,210
I was a fucking fool.

1420
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,610
I actually was a fool.

1421
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,970
He just fucking walks up.

1422
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,650
I had to defend it for another minute.

1423
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,610
It's fine.

1424
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:22,830
Okay.

1425
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,450
What's he gonna do?

1426
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,210
Flank me.

1427
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:28,450
Here we go.

1428
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,310
We figured it out.

1429
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,810
We figured it out, guys.

1430
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,090
There's no way.

1431
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,570
There's no way he's gonna do that again.

1432
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,650
There's no way.

1433
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,510
There's no way he's just gonna walk up again.

1434
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,930
Wait, am I the only one alive?

1435
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,230
Guys, I'm the only one alive!

1436
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:49,630
I'm being tracked.

1437
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:50,470
I'm not.

1438
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,730
Guys, I'm not the only one alive.

1439
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,430
I'm being tracked.

1440
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,270
What is he gonna do?

1441
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,350
Get over there in one second?

1442
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,010
Oh wait, he is.

1443
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,530
Wait a minute, he is.

1444
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,020
Oh my god.

1445
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,160
No, no, no, no.

1446
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,560
Oh my god.

1447
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,680
That's fucking right.

1448
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,340
I'm better!

1449
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:32,860
I'm so much better than you!

1450
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,700
Wait, I lost?

1451
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,980
I fucking won, but I lost.

1452
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,680
Oh, it's cause they have two.

1453
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,280
That's not fair!

1454
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,620
I had one!

1455
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,860
I had one.

1456
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,900
Bro, I did the most damage on these fuckers.

1457
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,220
Oh my god.

1458
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,700
She won the battle, but lost.

1459
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,980
Cause they had two!

1460
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,500
Not a clean sweep.

1461
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,180
You know what?

1462
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,040
That's like...

1463
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,280
That's like a moral victory.

1464
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,960
They couldn't get a clean sweep.

1465
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,120
They couldn't get a clean sweep in the end.

1466
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,360
So that's fine.

1467
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,440
That's fine.

1468
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:27,720
It's okay.

1469
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,360
It's okay.

1470
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,420
I was third.

1471
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,140
That's fine.

1472
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,080
I'll take them.

1473
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,880
It was the moment they killed the gorilla.

1474
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,630
Alright, let's team up with the dev.

1475
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,590
We're ready to play with the dev.

1476
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,950
Right now.

1477
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,050
Right now.

1478
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,470
I won the mental warfare.

1479
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,870
And that's all that matters.

1480
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,970
I won the mental warfare.

1481
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:02,970
By the way, guys.

1482
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,350
You can literally play the game right now.

1483
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,790
If you click the link on the description.

1484
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,490
That's in the description.

1485
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:13,430
Pinned in the chat box.

1486
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:14,450
So, yeah.

1487
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:15,270
Join out.

1488
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:15,930
Help the stream.

1489
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:16,750
Help the sponsor.

1490
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,770
Feel free to wishlist the game.

1491
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,250
And also, play the game right now.

1492
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,730
You might get into my queues.

1493
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,730
I won the mental warfare, guys.

1494
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:27,130
I slapped him.

1495
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:34,690
I'm pretty sure I killed majority of the lobby during that one run where I just started spitting on them.

1496
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:39,630
I just started spitting on them up in high ground.

1497
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:44,870
That's right.

1498
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,450
And they deserve it.

1499
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,670
I knew that you can buy a memory back.

1500
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:55,930
I just refused to because he was a waste of my money.

1501
01:10:56,150 --> 01:11:01,650
I just refused to.

1502
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:05,970
He was the one that died so fast.

1503
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,370
So, what's the point?

1504
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,850
What was the point when he died so fast?

1505
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,090
I'm gonna join the VC.

1506
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:22,450
Let's see.

1507
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,690
Where's the... I need to find the VC again.

1508
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,930
I have so many servers.

1509
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,610
Which one do I go?

1510
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,810
Why is there like three people in the...

1511
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,230
There's like...

1512
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,670
I'm like looking at the server.

1513
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:37,650
I'm okay.

1514
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,970
I just have a seasonal cough.

1515
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,390
And it's like...

1516
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,310
Start here.

1517
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,730
Doki voice chat.

1518
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,230
Oh, they went to the sick.

1519
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:46,950
Sick.

1520
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,390
I called them out.

1521
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:54,310
And then I saw two of them leaving the voice chat.

1522
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,070
I was like...

1523
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,850
Why is there like a fucking party over there?

1524
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:08,270
I was like, whoa, there's a party in the Doki voice chat.

1525
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,090
I was like, let's fucking go.

1526
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:13,150
And as they left, they left the party.

1527
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,950
They knew I was coming.

1528
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,130
So they left the party.

1529
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,750
I'm gonna join the VC.

1530
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,090
And then I'm gonna get the...

1531
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,510
Let me get my foogie ready.

1532
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:33,700
Hello.

1533
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,000
Hello.

1534
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:37,700
Hello.

1535
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,600
Oh my god.

1536
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,380
I am so definitely looking forward to this.

1537
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,300
Let's go.

1538
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,560
Hey, remember when you said you blacklisted me?

1539
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,160
What happened?

1540
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:47,860
I'm back.

1541
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,160
And this time you paid me.

1542
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,580
So you think you can come into my office?

1543
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,060
You think you can come into my home and be toxic and bully me?

1544
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,320
Dude, we paid so that I could bully you.

1545
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,520
Okay, I'm gonna leave right now.

1546
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,840
I can solo queue right now.

1547
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,540
I saw you solo queue.

1548
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,280
Yeah, and I almost won.

1549
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,220
I've never seen the gore lizard be played so badly.

1550
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,400
What do you mean?

1551
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,580
I got like 7 kills.

1552
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,920
What do you mean?

1553
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,600
You got like 7 kills playing the gore lizard the worst way possible.

1554
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,620
Yeah, and that's a talent.

1555
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,420
That means if I could play him optimally, I could get even more than 7 kills.

1556
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,760
The fact that I...

1557
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,920
Who the fuck cares about him?

1558
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:33,000
He told you to get the monkey.

1559
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,400
Yeah, but no.

1560
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,600
He told me to get the monkey, but then he didn't give me any other instructions.

1561
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,780
So he's a bad teammate.

1562
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:39,920
That's fair.

1563
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,060
And that's why you're here with me.

1564
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,940
So that way I could be the better teammate.

1565
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,180
Yeah, so your job is to do the objectives.

1566
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,000
And then I'll kill everybody else.

1567
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,700
I literally had no other expectation but that.

1568
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,660
Yeah, so just like last time.

1569
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,780
You're just gonna be a good little objective guy.

1570
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,300
And then I'll just be here killing everybody.

1571
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,040
Oh yeah, and then you have to make me a gun too.

1572
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,720
I have a surprise for you.

1573
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,740
You have a gun for me?

1574
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:08,260
How do I play with you?

1575
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,000
I don't remember.

1576
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,640
Press P. I'm watching your stream right now.

1577
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,000
I don't think you added me as a friend yet.

1578
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,960
No, I didn't.

1579
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,220
Oh, by the way, that's my friend code, guys.

1580
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,700
Please don't add me, guys.

1581
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,540
Go to find player.

1582
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:26,980
Maybe I should just do it.

1583
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,360
Yeah, you should just do it.

1584
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,520
My code is right there.

1585
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:31,440
You know what, guys?

1586
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,380
No, add me.

1587
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,780
So I know you downloaded the game.

1588
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,140
Add me right now.

1589
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,880
I wanna see how many of you actually downloaded the game.

1590
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,640
This is a sponsored stream, chat.

1591
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,280
Alright, that's in there.

1592
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,600
Guys, I'm fucking you.

1593
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,360
You guys are liars.

1594
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,380
I have zero friend requests.

1595
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,020
You have such fake friends.

1596
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,640
Wait, where's the request?

1597
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,360
I'm typing it.

1598
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:02,860
Oh, wait.

1599
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,540
No, that's not you.

1600
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,240
Look at that.

1601
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,020
That's a real Dragoon right there, guys.

1602
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,980
That's a Duck Automata.

1603
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,240
Yeah, the first person that actually added me.

1604
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,860
Alright, I sent you a friend request.

1605
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:16,780
I got you.

1606
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,400
No, that's not me.

1607
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,220
No, I got you.

1608
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,960
I know that's not you.

1609
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,580
You're the Jedi.

1610
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:22,800
Oh, okay.

1611
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,800
I was like, what the hell?

1612
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:29,460
Duck has been the only true Dragoon that added me.

1613
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,640
Why aren't you downloading the game and adding me on friends right now?

1614
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,700
Your boss won't know.

1615
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,180
Download the game right now.

1616
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,220
It's only 20 gig.

1617
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:49,280
Use the work Wi-Fi and download the game right now.

1618
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,320
Alright, I'm ready.

1619
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,360
How long have you had your little seasonal sickness?

1620
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,340
What's been going on with that?

1621
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,880
Oh, I've been sick for like a week now.

1622
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,380
But I'm not sick anymore.

1623
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,280
I'm just coughing.

1624
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,120
Oh, that's frustrating.

1625
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,640
Alright, we better win.

1626
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:05,920
Clutch your kick.

1627
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,360
Why did it...

1628
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,500
There we go.

1629
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,900
Alright, so I'm gonna praise you here.

1630
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,440
I'm really proud of you.

1631
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,380
You did really good.

1632
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,700
Of course!

1633
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,700
These people don't know how to aim.

1634
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,760
I had such low expectations you would remember how to play the game.

1635
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,640
I remembered!

1636
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,420
I was farming!

1637
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,780
Yeah, yeah, good job.

1638
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,300
I played him over.

1639
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:34,720
The other teammate, he's farming way too much.

1640
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,260
I don't know what that means.

1641
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,800
Yeah, he spent his entire life farming.

1642
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,880
He's playing League of Legends right now.

1643
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,340
Just killing minions the whole time.

1644
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:42,940
Yeah, that's why.

1645
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,360
He's been locked up in deadlock jail.

1646
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,400
And that's all he's been doing.

1647
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,340
Oh, wait.

1648
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:50,920
There we go.

1649
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,040
Alright, I have everything muted here.

1650
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,140
Alright, I'm ready.

1651
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,220
We're gonna do exactly the same thing.

1652
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:57,940
Alright, we're gonna farm.

1653
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,900
But we're not gonna farm for like half the match.

1654
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:03,820
Alright, nice.

1655
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,280
Wait, when does the gorilla actually unlock?

1656
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:11,240
So, the gorilla takes I wanna say about 5 minutes.

1657
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,840
Maybe almost 5 to 10 minutes to unlock.

1658
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,940
I forgot what the actual number was.

1659
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,740
But he's on this match.

1660
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,540
I don't remember everything!

1661
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,360
There's so much into this!

1662
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,580
Like, isn't the gorilla the best part about this?

1663
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,640
Why don't you remember the best part?

1664
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,920
I mean, I hard disagree.

1665
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,800
I think the best part about this game is killing the snakes.

1666
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,480
Oh my god.

1667
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,700
Now I know you're not the best player in your team.

1668
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,240
You don't know anything.

1669
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,380
You have no idea what we're talking about right now.

1670
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,540
Oh, you have in-game voice chat, by the way.

1671
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,680
Oh, I'm in.

1672
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,120
Okay, fine.

1673
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:44,620
I'll fix that.

1674
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,760
I was also harassing other people in my game, too.

1675
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,920
Oh, see, chat?

1676
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,400
He's a fucking bully, too!

1677
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,340
I'm just better at it than him.

1678
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:53,620
Oh, no, no.

1679
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,360
You don't even know anything.

1680
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:00,300
Guys, I'm basically saving the other players by bullying the bully.

1681
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,020
Alright.

1682
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,640
I get bullied all the time.

1683
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,180
I'm the community manager here, dude.

1684
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,080
I gotta like...

1685
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,420
I gotta listen to the people who are like, why is Doki Bird fucking threatening the entirety of the community?

1686
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:14,840
The entirety of the monkey!

1687
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,520
Oh, Snell!

1688
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,760
I can't find one at all.

1689
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:21,760
I found three.

1690
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,900
I thought you were supposed to carry me.

1691
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:24,460
The fuck?

1692
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,460
I literally found three Snells.

1693
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,640
You got RNGs on your side.

1694
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,160
No, I'm just good at the game.

1695
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,080
Alright, I got fifty dollars.

1696
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,220
Alright, we need to get a decent amount.

1697
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,220
Like, I wanna say, like, three hundred together.

1698
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,820
So, like, if you could find one fifty, I could find one fifty.

1699
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,000
We'll be set.

1700
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,680
Well, you're sort of behind right now.

1701
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,100
I'm trying to pick it up.

1702
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,380
You're sort of behind.

1703
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,680
I even gave you, like, so much time.

1704
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:53,780
Oh, look at that.

1705
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,340
I'm, like, way more ahead of you right now.

1706
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,720
Yeah, cause I've been exploring the map.

1707
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,160
Where are you even at?

1708
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,520
I've been exploring the map.

1709
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:05,020
I'm doing a little Amazon cruise right now.

1710
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,660
You're all the way over there in Narnia.

1711
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,940
I'm locked in right now.

1712
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,740
Can I say I'm not locked in?

1713
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,520
I don't think you're locked in.

1714
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,100
Look at that.

1715
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,140
Literally, the moment you said that, I got a hundred.

1716
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,080
Oh, wait.

1717
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:18,520
I'm poisoned.

1718
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
Why did it cost you so much of your life and your shields?

1719
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,900
Because I got poisoned and my teammate's not here to help me because he's not a team player.

1720
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,340
Yeah, that's fucking right.

1721
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:33,820
Wait.

1722
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,120
Wait, where am I?

1723
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,520
Actually, I don't even know.

1724
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,160
You're, like...

1725
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:41,800
Oh, shit.

1726
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:43,220
Oh, hey, Blue!

1727
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,060
Get over there, snail.

1728
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,900
Get your ass over here.

1729
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,840
I hear them slimy.

1730
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,060
Do we need, like, 40?

1731
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,940
150?

1732
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,420
Is that the goal?

1733
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,660
I think we have enough here.

1734
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,180
I have 130.

1735
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,860
Let's just go straight to our little base.

1736
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,280
Let's go to our house.

1737
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,300
Okay.

1738
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:09,800
I'm heading over.

1739
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,420
Alright, guys.

1740
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,320
The dev is here to actually teach us the game.

1741
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,260
What you learned from me, don't just delete that.

1742
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,180
Playing it the dookie way is not the right way, guys.

1743
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:24,660
Delete the gore lizard part.

1744
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,480
No, no.

1745
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:27,180
Keep that in.

1746
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,180
That was the best part.

1747
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,020
Keep that in.

1748
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,560
But, like, delete the rest.

1749
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,440
The gore lizard was the part where I was, like, the best at.

1750
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:42,980
I didn't know it was so possible to make, like, what people would call the most busted part of our game not the most busted part of the game.

1751
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:44,920
What do you mean?

1752
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,080
I killed seven people.

1753
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,160
I killed seven people!

1754
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,960
I thought we were going back to our base.

1755
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,280
We are going to our base.

1756
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,500
I already, like, unlocked everything.

1757
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,380
Look at that, guys.

1758
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:56,580
See?

1759
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,820
That's how you play the game.

1760
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,620
Yeah, the dookie way is more fun.

1761
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,640
I'm not saying it's, like, the wrong way.

1762
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,900
No, you were saying it was the wrong way.

1763
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,720
You were literally saying it was the wrong way.

1764
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,640
I'm trying to add context.

1765
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,660
You were literally trying to say it was the wrong way.

1766
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,160
I'm the guest here.

1767
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,680
Oh, wait, wait, gun!

1768
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:18,760
You have a gun for me?

1769
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,300
I got a gun for you, alright?

1770
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:20,760
Hold on.

1771
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,040
Let me grab this real quick.

1772
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,720
Let's go to a quiet place.

1773
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,840
Wait, why?

1774
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,940
You should just give it to me now.

1775
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,640
No, this is important.

1776
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,400
Wait, why?

1777
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,160
What if someone comes up and, like, kills us?

1778
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,020
Who's gonna kill us?

1779
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,540
You've seen the players in my lobby.

1780
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,620
Who the fuck is gonna kill us?

1781
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,820
We're going into training.

1782
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,720
Why do I need training?

1783
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,820
I'm already a master.

1784
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,520
Even masters need to train, okay?

1785
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,520
No, that's not true.

1786
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,020
That's what masters are supposed to be.

1787
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:54,540
Alright, so let's go right up here on top of this hill.

1788
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,320
Okay.

1789
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,800
Wait, is this a sniper?

1790
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,520
It is a sniper, alright?

1791
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:10,920
Alright, so, this sniper, whenever you were telling us, you know, hey, there's drop-off, you know, I don't like drop-off.

1792
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,900
This bullet doesn't have drop-off?

1793
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:18,780
We went back to the drawing board and we said, alright, we need to do something that speaks, like, the Oki language.

1794
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,600
Oh my god, there's no drop-off!

1795
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,000
Before you pick it up, just look at it.

1796
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,680
I picked it up!

1797
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,920
Oh my god, it's got a dick in it!

1798
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,260
Alright, I want you to shoot this all the way over here.

1799
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,840
You're gonna see not a single bullet drop.

1800
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,620
All the way over there.

1801
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,200
All the way over here?

1802
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,520
I don't know where it went.

1803
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,660
Where's the bullet hole?

1804
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,780
It's so fast.

1805
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,120
Try it again.

1806
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,840
I can't tell.

1807
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,120
Is there a bullet hole over there?

1808
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,340
Shoot that way.

1809
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,180
Maybe we gotta, like, get something a little bit better, like, in range here.

1810
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,880
Because that's a 4x scope, like a medium-ranged one.

1811
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,280
What the fuck are those green stuff that comes out of my bullet?

1812
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,980
It's toxic gas.

1813
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,380
It's like toxic spore clusters.

1814
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,680
Oh my god!

1815
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,020
Okay, so what does the gun actually say?

1816
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,980
It just says Dokinator.

1817
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,120
Oh!

1818
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,040
4x zoom cluster, short range.

1819
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:24,600
Let's go.

1820
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,320
No drop-off.

1821
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,300
Let's fucking go.

1822
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,540
Zero drop-off.

1823
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,780
Alright, this is it.

1824
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:29,800
See, guys?

1825
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,060
Peer pressure works.

1826
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,960
The moment you peer pressure a dev, they'll make a gun just for you.

1827
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:36,680
Exactly.

1828
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:40,760
And then all the other players are gonna complain, but it doesn't matter as long as I'm happy.

1829
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:45,820
We're setting an example for all the gamers around the world that make a jillion billion dollars.

1830
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,320
See?

1831
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,920
If you wanna have fun, don't have bullet drop-off.

1832
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,560
It's a hitscan.

1833
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,920
Alright, so, and I saw earlier, you know, chat talking about the Diddy.

1834
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,000
Diddy is still available in the game.

1835
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:02,920
I did not get rid of him.

1836
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,420
He's still unchained.

1837
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,880
He's just, you know, in prison.

1838
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,840
He's in prison, but his soul lives on.

1839
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,480
Just like the gun.

1840
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,060
Alright, so let's actually, let's go play some objective here.

1841
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:17,520
Let's go get some kills.

1842
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,280
Someone's got it already.

1843
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:21,760
Don't worry.

1844
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,380
I got the dookinity.

1845
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,100
If I get shot in my back, it's your fault.

1846
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,440
Nah, that's fine.

1847
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,660
I kinda hope you do.

1848
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:31,760
That's fucked up.

1849
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,680
I'm gonna lose the gun.

1850
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:34,860
I'll just get it back for you.

1851
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,220
That's fucked up.

1852
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,860
I'll just get it back for you.

1853
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,580
I'm gonna die again.

1854
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,080
I'm gonna die so many times, so you have to use your money to res me.

1855
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,200
I'll get my credit card out right now.

1856
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,760
Wait, where are they?

1857
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,120
They're like, pretty far right now.

1858
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:57,700
I think we should go over here to B instead, because there's a big fight happening over at A, so Oh, yeah, yeah, here.

1859
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,480
This little vortex right here.

1860
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,740
Yeah, it makes you jump higher.

1861
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:04,100
Jump into it, but you can get a nice little super slide if you time it.

1862
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,400
Where?

1863
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,240
I did it.

1864
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,180
Where are people at?

1865
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,680
They're all fighting over at A, I think.

1866
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,160
Why are we not going to A?

1867
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,140
Well, we're gonna get some air on them.

1868
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,120
I can see where people are at right now.

1869
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:25,920
There's two teams fighting at A, and there's a couple of teams all around here.

1870
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,140
You wanna set a fuckin' air strike tower?

1871
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,300
Like a precision air strike on people?

1872
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,040
Wait, what?

1873
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,520
It's glass, Doki!

1874
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,520
Just shoot through the glass!

1875
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,180
What?

1876
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,160
No, that's property damage.

1877
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,780
It's a video game!

1878
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,620
That's not what God thinks.

1879
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,660
You don't bring God in my Christian Minecraft server.

1880
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,040
Wait, where's A?

1881
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,200
Alright, alright, A is probably way up at the top.

1882
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:53,940
You see that right up there?

1883
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:54,940
Oh shit, you're right!

1884
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,620
Alright, let's do it.

1885
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,320
Pull the lever, Kronk.

1886
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,720
Pull the lever, Kronk!

1887
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,060
Alright, let's do a rocket jump.

1888
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,920
Wait, there's a rocket jump?

1889
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,420
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

1890
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:05,380
Jump onto it!

1891
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:08,740
Wait, what?

1892
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:10,580
What?

1893
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:13,380
Oh!

1894
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,180
Oh, that's what it does.

1895
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,700
Oh, wait, that's a robot.

1896
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,260
Oh, they secured A.

1897
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,840
That's why we went to B, because B was just gonna... we were gonna waste our time on it all day.

1898
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:25,740
We were gonna play Waddle Dee.

1899
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:26,960
I don't wanna do that to ya.

1900
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,500
Where are they?

1901
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,620
Um, they're probably...

1902
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,340
They just captured.

1903
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:32,600
They were way up here.

1904
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,340
I just marked.

1905
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,280
You have a map button.

1906
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:36,040
Maybe press M.

1907
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:36,800
I think you know it.

1908
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,580
Yeah, yeah, I've been looking at it.

1909
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,080
Yeah, they're like the top map.

1910
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,040
I just wanna shoot people.

1911
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,760
They're coming.

1912
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,980
These guys... I think we're in a sweat lobby, because my MMR's pretty high.

1913
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:46,320
Wait, what?

1914
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:49,420
You didn't reset your MMR in the dev console?

1915
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:50,600
No.

1916
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,420
Why not?

1917
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,720
I'm a baby.

1918
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,620
You're a baby?

1919
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,160
You just said you were the best in the game.

1920
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:57,740
What are you talking about?

1921
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,260
I'm the best in the game in my ELO!

1922
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,220
Oh, I forgot.

1923
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,580
Trash can ELO doesn't exist.

1924
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,240
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1925
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,440
Whoa, I'm getting shot at!

1926
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,420
Okay, okay, get ready to... I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1927
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,440
Whoa, I fell down.

1928
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,800
He broke the glass.

1929
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,760
How do I get back up top?

1930
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,020
Oh, I'm frightened.

1931
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:17,920
I don't know where the top is.

1932
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,180
Oh, where are they?

1933
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,880
I'm trying to look for them right now.

1934
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:24,420
He's right up here.

1935
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,580
He's looking at me so you can shoot him.

1936
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,680
I got him, I got him.

1937
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,240
I did it!

1938
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,380
I hear people shooting at you somewhere.

1939
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,300
I don't know.

1940
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:36,720
I know I heard...

1941
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,480
Oh, he's right here.

1942
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:39,980
Oh, just missed that.

1943
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:43,620
He's heading up.

1944
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:50,890
He's so low!

1945
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:52,310
There's a guy on me.

1946
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:53,170
Wait, Alan!

1947
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:54,750
Wait, there's a dragoon lobby!

1948
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:56,650
Oh, no.

1949
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:59,030
This is a shit MMR lobby.

1950
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:04,210
Alright, I'm heading over.

1951
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:08,510
I thought you were better.

1952
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,450
I am better, I won.

1953
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,970
Yeah, so why are you begging for your life there?

1954
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:14,630
I'm asking where you're at.

1955
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,110
Begging for your life like a pussy.

1956
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,990
Here's the purple shield.

1957
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:24,710
Oh, nice.

1958
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:25,290
Wait, wait, wait.

1959
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,670
Right below.

1960
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,330
Oh, I deserve this.

1961
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:33,170
I heard a gunshot below us.

1962
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:36,730
I did, because I'm not a pussy.

1963
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,050
Have you used your sniper yet?

1964
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:39,690
I did!

1965
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:41,190
I almost killed one guy!

1966
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:42,010
Almost?

1967
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:42,910
You didn't?

1968
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:44,650
Oh, I'm sorry!

1969
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:47,170
Your gun is fucking weak as shit!

1970
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:47,850
I do like...

1971
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,050
It's your gun.

1972
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:51,410
I literally got it off of you.

1973
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,270
It literally has your fucking name in it.

1974
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:55,370
What do you mean it's my gun?

1975
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:57,150
I can't believe you made such a...

1976
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:00,410
I can't believe you made a weak-ass gun for me.

1977
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,130
I can't believe it.

1978
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,390
I do 36...

1979
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:07,970
I did 36 damage per shot.

1980
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,690
Like, what the fuck was that?

1981
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:11,230
Alright, hear me out.

1982
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:11,950
I do have a confession.

1983
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:14,230
I actually did make that gun just for you.

1984
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:16,350
And I also made it the worst sniper rifle.

1985
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,490
I fucking knew it.

1986
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:18,310
I knew it.

1987
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,290
I fucking knew it.

1988
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:21,010
I was like, why is this a...

1989
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:23,450
I still killed somebody, because I'm just that good.

1990
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:25,910
That's fucking right.

1991
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:27,230
I hope you...

1992
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,250
Kill him!

1993
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:32,250
I did.

1994
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:33,770
Little baby.

1995
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,770
Oh, shit.

1996
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:38,490
Oh, shit.

1997
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,090
Maybe I should have res'd you.

1998
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:46,410
I can get P. Diddy back, though.

1999
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:47,350
But we need to get more power.

2000
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:49,830
Oh my god, what do we need?

2001
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:53,330
I fucking knew that gun was dog shit.

2002
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:54,110
I was like...

2003
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,490
I was like 30 fucking...

2004
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:58,810
30 damage per shot.

2005
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,570
And I hit every single shot.

2006
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:02,490
I was like, that can't be right.

2007
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:07,050
It has like the worst drop-off in a sniper rifle I've ever seen in any video game.

2008
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:07,790
I'm not gonna lie.

2009
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:10,390
Oh my god, you were trying to gas like me.

2010
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:11,330
I fucking knew it.

2011
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:12,590
I was like, I'm not...

2012
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:13,130
I knew it.

2013
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,150
I fucking knew it.

2014
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:18,150
The moment I hit somebody with that gun, I was like, this gun is dog shit.

2015
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:23,810
You were talking about it earlier, how it's wrong to cyber-bully people on the internet.

2016
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,890
Chat, I actually would like to say it's me.

2017
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:27,310
It's absolutely...

2018
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:28,310
Only this guy.

2019
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,270
Only this guy.

2020
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,350
Only Doki, though.

2021
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,210
Only this guy.

2022
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:31,250
Yeah.

2023
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:34,330
Wait, run him over.

2024
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,450
I'm gonna fight him.

2025
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:38,210
Why don't you wanna fight him?

2026
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:41,530
He could've fucking died and never played the game ever again.

2027
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:42,950
Where'd he go?

2028
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,510
Oh, there he is.

2029
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,530
Right here.

2030
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,110
Right up here.

2031
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,940
Wouldn't it be funny if he dies?

2032
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,080
Alan!

2033
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:02,490
Yeah, you'd like that.

2034
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,250
Oh, I killed somebody.

2035
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:05,390
Alright, nice.

2036
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,590
We need to go to B right there.

2037
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:09,070
They keep getting away with it right now.

2038
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:11,370
Wait, I'm gonna slap this guy.

2039
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:12,970
For his money and loot.

2040
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:15,250
Every time you slap him, you get shields back.

2041
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,970
Yeah, that's why I wanted to slap him.

2042
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:17,490
Okay.

2043
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:21,670
Wait, how much power do you need for the better sniper?

2044
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:25,010
For P Diddy, I think I needed like...

2045
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:26,030
360?

2046
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:28,150
Could be wrong.

2047
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:30,870
I mean, we could try and fight for B here really quick, actually.

2048
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:32,630
I think that's probably the better move here.

2049
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:34,390
It's really close to us.

2050
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,270
Alright, you got this.

2051
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:37,390
Okay.

2052
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,110
I got the dokenator in my hand, I believe.

2053
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,070
Oh shit, there's somebody here.

2054
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:42,690
I'm hit 79.

2055
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,270
Huge, huge.

2056
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:46,610
I actually didn't expect it to be helpful.

2057
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,490
Where did he go?

2058
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:50,710
He's inside.

2059
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:53,230
I hear him.

2060
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:54,430
I hear him too.

2061
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,990
I think he's falling all the way to the ground.

2062
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:57,370
Outside now?

2063
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:58,470
Oh shit!

2064
01:31:58,630 --> 01:31:59,150
He's on me.

2065
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:01,030
He's low.

2066
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,630
Oh, he's low, he's low.

2067
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:04,270
Yeah, I've downed him with poison.

2068
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:06,010
I got shot by two right here.

2069
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:10,990
Oh, this is sad.

2070
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:12,570
This is so sad to watch.

2071
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:13,430
This is very sad, yeah.

2072
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:15,510
Bro, this...

2073
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:17,630
Did you win?

2074
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:19,150
Yeah, I won.

2075
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:25,730
That's gonna be so sad if you didn't win that after I got them both low.

2076
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,270
No, no, that's fair.

2077
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,750
That was quite sad to watch in front of me.

2078
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:31,990
Can you drive?

2079
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:33,510
Do you know how to drive?

2080
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:34,750
Yeah, no.

2081
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:35,730
Depends.

2082
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:36,950
Which one?

2083
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:38,290
Depends.

2084
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:39,750
Depends on what?

2085
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,070
It just depends.

2086
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:43,590
Do you trust me with your life?

2087
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,710
And I don't think you do.

2088
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:49,170
I just need you to drive from point A to quite literally point B.

2089
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:50,830
It's a big old fucking yellow...

2090
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,050
Why?

2091
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,630
Why can't you drive?

2092
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,350
I'm far away, that's why I'm asking you to drive!

2093
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:56,550
Oh, I already left.

2094
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:57,890
There's no car anymore.

2095
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,190
I already...

2096
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:06,270
You should've said, can you stay at spawn and pick up the car?

2097
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:07,570
Like, you could've just said that.

2098
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,930
I didn't realize the intention was that you wanted me to drive.

2099
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,010
Get over to B.

2100
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:16,250
Get over to B.

2101
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,830
But like...

2102
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:20,510
But it's so far.

2103
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:23,130
That's why I said get over, bro!

2104
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:27,310
You didn't tell me to get the car in the first place!

2105
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:29,110
You just asked me a yes and no question!

2106
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:29,630
He told you everywhere!

2107
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:31,250
Oh, there's money here.

2108
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:32,850
You're just like...

2109
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,970
You're like, did you drive?

2110
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:36,990
And then I'm like, oh...

2111
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:38,750
But there was no context to that question.

2112
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,910
I just assumed you wanted me to do something.

2113
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,530
I didn't know you wanted me to do something.

2114
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:44,810
I assumed you knew what you were doing, too!

2115
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:46,210
That's why I said get in the car!

2116
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:48,490
I didn't realize you wanted me to get in the car.

2117
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:52,130
I just thought you wanted to know if I can drive or anything.

2118
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,570
And I was like, what an odd question to ask.

2119
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:00,870
Do I head over to B?

2120
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:02,870
Is it still possible?

2121
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,370
It's still possible!

2122
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:06,450
I'm gonna drive now!

2123
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,480
Alright, I'm heading over.

2124
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,800
I see you on the map.

2125
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,500
I should be right behind you.

2126
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,460
No, you're not.

2127
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:23,320
I'm right behind you.

2128
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:23,860
No, you're not.

2129
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,580
You're like 500 miles away from me.

2130
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,720
Not even 500.

2131
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,520
It says 200 meters right now on my screen.

2132
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,560
What if I just go up and steal it?

2133
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,560
I mean, you can.

2134
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,000
No, they didn't let me.

2135
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,940
I don't think they let you.

2136
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,800
I thought if you were closer, you could've helped me.

2137
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,680
But you weren't.

2138
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,080
You were so far.

2139
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,540
So you did lie.

2140
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,920
You could've helped me the first time.

2141
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,500
I can't get in the car right now!

2142
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:56,300
You had to mansplain about, oh, you need to tell me what it means.

2143
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:56,580
Yeah!

2144
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,580
You have to!

2145
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,420
I can't believe it.

2146
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,600
You didn't doki-proof this.

2147
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,040
You should've doki-proofed it.

2148
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,780
How should I doki-proof it?

2149
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,520
What are some examples of doki-proofing?

2150
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:17,040
Like saying, can you grab the car at spawn and drive over there?

2151
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,740
Instead of saying stuff like, do you drive?

2152
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,860
Because in my head, I'm like, in real life?

2153
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,040
Like...

2154
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,420
I thought you were just wanting to know more about me as a person.

2155
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,560
I didn't realize it was all about the game.

2156
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:36,960
Also, there's two guys right here that I'm trying to run over.

2157
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,420
Oh, I think...

2158
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,080
Are they real?

2159
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:42,840
I can't tell.

2160
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,420
I'm getting shot at now.

2161
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,820
I got shot at by two people.

2162
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:54,600
This isn't working out.

2163
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,600
Alright, we're regrouping.

2164
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,160
I think you guys spend your money to fucking bring me back.

2165
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,820
This is the worst I've ever gotten.

2166
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:02,500
This is the worst I've ever done in the game.

2167
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,160
I'm just saying.

2168
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:07,080
You know what?

2169
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:07,480
No, no, no.

2170
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:12,160
I was being nice earlier, but that guy that was running around not shooting you?

2171
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,120
That was the top player of the game.

2172
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:21,260
He got queued into... I'd personally DM him and be like, hey, there's this really horrible streamer coming in right now.

2173
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,180
She can't aim for shit.

2174
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,140
Can you be careful with her?

2175
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,720
What do you mean?

2176
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,240
The Kord whatever?

2177
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,360
That guy?

2178
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,160
Which one?

2179
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,080
Raiden.

2180
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,200
Raiden?

2181
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:32,400
I killed him.

2182
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:35,000
Yeah, I told him to let you kill him.

2183
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,120
No, you didn't.

2184
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,960
No, you didn't.

2185
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,380
You're fucking lying.

2186
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,260
You're fucking lying.

2187
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:43,480
Where are you?

2188
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,460
I'm literally behind you.

2189
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,760
I have a car right behind you.

2190
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,400
Alright, get out of the car.

2191
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,040
We're going inside.

2192
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:52,460
What are we doing?

2193
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,040
What are we doing?

2194
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,440
We're going downstairs.

2195
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:57,980
Why?

2196
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:00,220
Because it's faster that way.

2197
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,460
Why are we going downstairs?

2198
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,300
Our car doesn't fit there.

2199
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,420
We're literally in here.

2200
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,140
What do you mean it doesn't fit?

2201
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,260
No, it doesn't fit in some of the holes.

2202
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:14,760
See?

2203
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,340
Look, you're just bumping into everything.

2204
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,320
You're not even a good driver.

2205
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,460
I'm a way better driver than you are.

2206
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,600
I don't know after seeing that.

2207
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:24,440
I don't know.

2208
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:27,680
Why are we locking Gorillaz in?

2209
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,920
Is this P. Diddy?

2210
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,140
My P. Diddy is in here, yeah.

2211
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,560
I can just pause it.

2212
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:37,780
I have a thousand oil bottles.

2213
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,380
Wait, you need oil bottles?

2214
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:47,160
You somehow managed to reach out from prison and Wait, where's the gun?

2215
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:48,980
I need to buy it!

2216
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:50,360
That's what we're down here for.

2217
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,340
We're getting power to buy it.

2218
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,000
I gave you so much.

2219
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,960
How much did you give me?

2220
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,080
It's like 400 something now.

2221
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,080
Alright, let me see.

2222
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,220
I didn't see any money in there.

2223
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:07,380
It doesn't even shake my head.

2224
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,320
Bro, it says 120!

2225
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,200
Oh, that's on you.

2226
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,260
That means you're broke.

2227
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:12,340
Broke.

2228
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,280
It says 400 for me.

2229
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,260
See, it says 430.

2230
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,960
Mine says 140 because I've spent power on other things.

2231
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,480
Why were you spending money on other things?

2232
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,440
I bought the dokinator for you.

2233
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,080
That was a waste of time.

2234
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,560
It was totally worth it.

2235
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,300
Chat, was it a waste of time?

2236
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:44,740
Guys, after this stream just remember to comment on the stream afterwards.

2237
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,500
To die was the worst death I've ever encountered.

2238
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,820
Game of the year.

2239
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,580
How can I fight that?

2240
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Game of all time.

2241
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:58,660
Game of the year.

2242
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:05,360
But also game of the year at the end of the sentence.

2243
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,620
How can I even defend myself?

2244
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:17,500
That's why you don't cyberbully, guys.

2245
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,140
Or karma's going to get you.

2246
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:29,080
I'm going to find whoever Black Slapow is for game of the year.

2247
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,780
I'm literally going to find you.

2248
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,500
I'm going to live in your walls for the rest of your life.

2249
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:36,480
Jackpot.

2250
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,560
Game of the year for action.

2251
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,580
Where's the power, bro?

2252
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:41,120
I don't know.

2253
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,100
I got 480 now.

2254
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:51,240
By the time we get the gun, the game's going to be over.

2255
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,980
There's no B and C, dude.

2256
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:55,700
The game's going to be over.

2257
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,500
We got 10 euros, dude.

2258
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,100
Game of the year.

2259
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:00,940
Keep bullying her.

2260
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:01,860
Alright, let's go.

2261
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:10,560
Do you need a glass of water?

2262
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,300
No, it's just my life.

2263
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,340
You're bullying a sick person.

2264
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,660
That's so fucked up.

2265
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,700
What if it's like...

2266
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:26,440
What if I had something really bad in my immune system right now and you're like...

2267
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,740
You're just beating a fucking dog right now.

2268
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:30,940
That's so fucked up.

2269
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:42,400
You're beating up a fucking tiny ass dog right now by saying all these things.

2270
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:44,780
What if...

2271
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:48,380
What if I was gonna fucking... What if like...

2272
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:52,640
It was Terminal and this was the last video game I'm ever gonna play.

2273
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,120
That's the last memory you have of me.

2274
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,440
I'm gonna put that on my LinkedIn.

2275
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:12,780
There's gonna be an entire article that says indie game developer bullies VTuber into submission after dying from a critical single shot terminal.

2276
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:13,820
It's over.

2277
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,960
I'm gonna pin that on my LinkedIn.

2278
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,720
I'm pinning it on my LinkedIn and I'm gonna say...

2279
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,740
That was the last job you'll do.

2280
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:24,180
I'm gonna transcript everything and just say I'm sorry.

2281
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,340
That's fucking right.

2282
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,680
That's fucking right.

2283
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:30,020
See guys, you can make anybody apologize.

2284
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,200
See?

2285
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:38,160
Guys, don't guilt trip or manipulate people.

2286
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,060
This is what you don't do, Chad.

2287
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,440
This isn't working.

2288
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,740
Let's just go find B or C now.

2289
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:49,580
I can't find power to save my life here.

2290
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,540
I got like 500 things in there.

2291
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,040
I have 500 points.

2292
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,860
I don't have your 500 points.

2293
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:57,140
Those are your 500 points.

2294
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,520
Wait, so you don't get what I put in?

2295
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,680
I do, but I spent it already.

2296
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:03,120
You already spent it?

2297
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:05,820
No, I just put 200 more.

2298
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:09,340
I said I spent it on Dokenator the first time.

2299
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:10,700
Just now.

2300
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,740
It should be closer now.

2301
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:13,320
It should be closer.

2302
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,820
I put 200 in there.

2303
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:19,780
I put 200 in there.

2304
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:22,880
No!

2305
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,840
We don't have C!

2306
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,620
I have another 10.

2307
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,780
I'm trying to get out of this building right now.

2308
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,340
How do I get out of this building?

2309
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:41,600
That's offensive.

2310
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,140
I'll take that.

2311
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,120
Get this Dokenator dog shit out of my hands.

2312
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:46,860
I have...

2313
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,260
Just go towards B at this point.

2314
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,400
I put more stuff in there.

2315
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,240
That's 630.

2316
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:54,800
Go towards B.

2317
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,920
I will meet you there.

2318
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:58,460
I don't know how to get there.

2319
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,460
You took me inside this building.

2320
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,300
No, I'm upstairs.

2321
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:06,280
You took me inside this building and now I'm fucking stuck here for the rest of my life.

2322
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:07,480
Thank god.

2323
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,560
And then like...

2324
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,380
I'm outside now.

2325
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:12,400
I figured it out.

2326
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,460
Just go to B if you can make it.

2327
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,840
Looks like there's other teams there.

2328
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:16,640
We can still fight.

2329
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,100
We can actually play a real game here.

2330
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,880
I didn't even get to be a gorilla.

2331
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,620
We're OSHA certified.

2332
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,100
We'll get you Monk next game.

2333
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,380
I didn't get to be a gorilla.

2334
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,200
We'll get you the Monk next game.

2335
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,060
I can't believe it.

2336
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:32,760
Wait, are they getting contested right now?

2337
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:33,780
Yeah, they're being contested.

2338
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:34,980
The exclamation points are positive.

2339
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:39,260
Yeah, you can't complain about the Dokenator when you were the one that purposely made it weak.

2340
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,380
They're so right.

2341
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,000
They're so right.

2342
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,400
It wasn't me because my name isn't Dokenator.

2343
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,460
Your name is quite literally Doki's in there.

2344
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:49,860
No, no, no.

2345
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,680
My name is Doki Brood.

2346
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:57,860
Okay, I got the Bio Core.

2347
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:58,980
No thanks to you.

2348
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,440
I'm fucking defending you right now?

2349
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:03,020
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

2350
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:04,200
I got a kill.

2351
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,400
I don't see a kill in your name yet.

2352
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,960
I don't see a kill in your name yet.

2353
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:11,340
Oh yeah, let me fucking do everything, I guess.

2354
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,360
Oh, there we go.

2355
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,120
Let me do everything.

2356
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:14,140
Player down.

2357
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,920
How many shots have you been to?

2358
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:18,760
You don't have a blue shield.

2359
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,560
You don't level up shield like that.

2360
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:22,600
Yes, you do.

2361
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,720
You have enough power.

2362
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:24,540
I'm getting out of here.

2363
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,820
No, I don't.

2364
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:29,660
Hey.

2365
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,480
Oh shit, are you dead?

2366
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,400
I'm not dead yet, but he's trying to kill me.

2367
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,280
He's trying to heal up right here.

2368
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,740
He's right behind this tree and a rock.

2369
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,340
You ping him?

2370
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah, I did ping him.

2371
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,540
Pick up the live core if you can.

2372
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:53,680
You'll get full health.

2373
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:55,640
Oh, you're so much better.

2374
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:56,780
Wait, where is it?

2375
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:57,640
Oh, there it is.

2376
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,440
I'm gonna beat him up.

2377
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,140
Oh shit, oh shit!

2378
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:04,940
Ah!

2379
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:05,880
Okay, I'm dead.

2380
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:07,860
I'm dead.

2381
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:09,980
I'm so dead.

2382
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,340
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

2383
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,220
I'm coming, I'm coming.

2384
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,180
That's the most I can play in my life.

2385
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,240
That was the most I can play in my life.

2386
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,640
No, no, it's fair, it's fair.

2387
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:22,680
Okay, let's wait for you to respawn.

2388
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:24,080
No, I don't have respawn.

2389
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:25,780
Hold on, hold on.

2390
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,540
I can buy you back.

2391
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,160
You couldn't do it earlier.

2392
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:30,040
Buy someone back.

2393
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,700
Yeah, because my life was clearly more worth it.

2394
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,100
I know, I agree.

2395
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:39,640
I bet you if I look at my damage after this game, it's more than yours.

2396
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:42,120
Oh, you want to put a bet on it?

2397
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,620
You want to put a fucking bet on it, dude?

2398
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,180
But now it's too late because I'm dead, so it's not worth it.

2399
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,760
If I was alive, I would've.

2400
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,060
But now I'm dead.

2401
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:52,420
There it is.

2402
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,420
There we go.

2403
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:00,560
Get back in here!

2404
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,360
Wait, give me the gun.

2405
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,620
I don't have it.

2406
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,940
I never bought it.

2407
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:09,140
Oathkeeper's verdict is really good, actually.

2408
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:09,480
Oh, okay.

2409
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,300
I did have my vehicle.

2410
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,060
Okay, so another team stole it.

2411
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:18,140
Already?

2412
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:18,320
Already?

2413
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,200
Yeah, another team stole it already.

2414
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,100
It got out like 5 seconds ago.

2415
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,020
They can keep stealing it.

2416
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:31,100
Wait, did they put that thing in the core thing?

2417
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,660
No, they haven't tried to count it down yet.

2418
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,420
But it says final countdown.

2419
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:36,720
This is the match time.

2420
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,740
Oh, we lost.

2421
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,280
So we lost.

2422
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,240
If we pick it up, we still get more points.

2423
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:48,100
All I'm saying is that if somebody didn't...

2424
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:48,420
Oh, wait.

2425
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:49,560
I'm going to get off the car.

2426
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,500
Good luck.

2427
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,250
Oh, these guys are so easy to shoot.

2428
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:01,830
I can't even see them right now.

2429
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:07,380
Are they dead?

2430
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:07,860
I stole it!

2431
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:09,680
Are they dead?

2432
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:10,420
I can't tell.

2433
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:11,420
Just one died.

2434
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:13,460
Alright,

2435
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:21,360
so they at least don't capture it, so at least we can get an extra one.

2436
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,400
I think we got last place.

2437
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:26,840
We probably... Oh, there's a brower right there.

2438
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:27,380
That's unlucky.

2439
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,360
We just noticed that.

2440
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,300
There's a what?

2441
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:30,380
A brower.

2442
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,480
It's like a big ol' croco boy.

2443
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,660
Does he give us more points?

2444
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,180
Yeah, he gives us more points.

2445
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,940
He also gives us more ammo and power.

2446
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,800
Really big guns.

2447
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:46,960
I swear to God, I've been playing against this dad of turds for like four games straight.

2448
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,240
He's probably in your server.

2449
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:53,280
Like your fine side.

2450
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,040
Oh!

2451
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,320
I think you queued into West Coast.

2452
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:00,960
Because whenever you joined, we were like where the hell are you?

2453
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,800
You were like all alone.

2454
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:06,520
I did have more damage!

2455
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,200
I fucking knew I did more.

2456
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,540
You had a chance.

2457
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,940
I had more...

2458
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,720
Of course I had more damage.

2459
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:19,380
Guys, I just need you guys to know this guy's a dev for this game, so he's been playing this game for a long fucking time.

2460
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:22,960
And this is like my second time playing and I'm already out damaging him.

2461
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:23,820
That's all I'm saying.

2462
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,660
I'm already damaging this fucking...

2463
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,160
I just challenged you to a 1v1.

2464
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:36,100
1v1?

2465
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,020
Bro, we have 12 minutes left.

2466
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,720
I wanna fucking be a gorilla.

2467
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:44,120
You wanna be a gorilla?

2468
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:44,860
Alright, fine.

2469
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:47,340
I wanna be a gorilla.

2470
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:51,540
I'm not fucking wasting my time knowing that I'm gonna win.

2471
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:52,620
You wanna be a gorilla?

2472
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,400
Okay, let's say it.

2473
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:54,180
Just don't accept it.

2474
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,780
Where'd you go?

2475
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,260
I'm right here.

2476
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:08,500
I'm right here.

2477
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:13,210
I wanna be a gorilla.

2478
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:15,210
I wanna win a game.

2479
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:17,290
I wanna win a game.

2480
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:19,050
Alright, we'll get you a gorilla, alright?

2481
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:21,450
We have to end the stream with a win.

2482
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:25,010
We're not gonna get that dog shit dokey bird gun, okay?

2483
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:26,190
Yeah, dokinator.

2484
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:27,170
No, no, no.

2485
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:27,870
No, no, no.

2486
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:28,410
It's not...

2487
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:31,250
I did not license my rights.

2488
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:35,250
It's a bootleg.

2489
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,390
It's not mine.

2490
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:38,510
Got the ready up?

2491
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:40,450
Yeah, you got a ready up.

2492
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:41,310
What'd you do?

2493
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:42,630
I'm ready up.

2494
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:43,430
What did you do?

2495
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:45,710
There we go.

2496
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:46,410
I did it.

2497
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:47,370
We're searching.

2498
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:50,350
Yay!

2499
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:55,910
I'm gonna go grab a unsponsored Dr. Pepper from the fridge.

2500
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:02,710
Where is...

2501
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:04,470
Guys, I only have three friend requests.

2502
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:05,930
What the fuck is this, guys?

2503
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:15,830
Guys, prove to me that you downloaded the game by clicking the link on the description

2504
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,970
What is... Guys!

2505
01:50:24,170 --> 01:50:28,130
It can't be three Dracos that downloaded the game.

2506
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,870
It's free!

2507
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:33,490
I'm back.

2508
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,670
I have a question.

2509
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:36,470
What's a...

2510
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:38,750
Why did you choose a bird out of all animals?

2511
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:39,810
Because I like birds.

2512
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:42,650
Are you sure it wasn't supposed to be a rat?

2513
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:44,470
I like rats, too.

2514
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:47,110
But Doki Bird sounds cutie.

2515
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,210
That's fair game.

2516
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:50,710
I'm just asking.

2517
01:50:54,570 --> 01:50:55,710
Where's our match?

2518
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,650
Oh shit, now I went to six.

2519
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:59,110
Guys, I swear, guys.

2520
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:01,310
This doesn't go to ten, I swear to god.

2521
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:05,050
I need at least ten Dragoons to friend request me.

2522
01:51:06,690 --> 01:51:11,050
So I can tell people that I have friends.

2523
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:12,470
I have plenty of friends.

2524
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:16,150
I'm not gonna accept it, but like...

2525
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:20,290
You could've gotten people to be your minion in the game.

2526
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,730
Wait, really?

2527
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:22,870
Yeah, yeah.

2528
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:24,670
I'm sitting in front of you.

2529
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,850
You see that little cat girl behind me?

2530
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:28,290
On my jacket?

2531
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:33,370
That's actually another VTuber who's a part of our top dogs.

2532
01:51:34,050 --> 01:51:40,930
Every time I get a kill and I get Biocore secure, her name gets up in the clan leader.

2533
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:42,350
It's like creator clan basically.

2534
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:43,550
Oh, and I'm not in it?

2535
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:45,650
Well, you didn't fucking ask.

2536
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:48,110
I shouldn't need to ask.

2537
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:49,390
I should be offered.

2538
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:52,550
You know what?

2539
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:53,410
You're real.

2540
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:56,450
Who's in charge of that?

2541
01:51:56,730 --> 01:52:02,050
That's all I'm saying.

2542
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:04,650
We had a...

2543
01:52:05,370 --> 01:52:13,010
We had Summit and we had DrDisRespect play the games and they immediately searched their names and were like, who are your names after this fucking game?

2544
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:16,410
Alright.

2545
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:22,280
Alright, we're locking in.

2546
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:24,100
This is gonna be the game.

2547
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,640
I've always been locked in.

2548
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:27,080
I've always been locked in.

2549
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,140
That's why I out damage.

2550
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,480
I'm naturally locked in in whatever game I play.

2551
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:43,470
Alright.

2552
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:45,690
Snails.

2553
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:49,690
I will try to get PDiddy back.

2554
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,350
All I'm saying is the moment you put that gun in my hand it's over for everybody.

2555
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:55,550
That's crazy.

2556
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,170
It sounds like you really like the gun.

2557
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:03,250
I just like killing people in game.

2558
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:06,790
Get over here, snail.

2559
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:09,050
Get your ass over here.

2560
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:13,930
Look for a really big alligator.

2561
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:15,310
Oh, I saw those before.

2562
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:16,430
Yeah, yeah.

2563
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:18,450
He'll have all the good shit for us.

2564
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:25,220
Oh, I got shields.

2565
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,660
I have 70 points.

2566
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,780
150, right?

2567
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:42,120
I hear somebody next to me.

2568
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:42,940
Where did you go?

2569
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:46,040
There's actually real people coming this way.

2570
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,380
Why are they here?

2571
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:48,560
This is our farm.

2572
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,620
They're trespassing.

2573
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,840
They're not gonna have good guns.

2574
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,720
They literally just spawn.

2575
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,120
They're not, but like...

2576
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:04,740
They can still definitely catch us off guard if we're not careful.

2577
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:06,900
They won't.

2578
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:07,940
I'm a gamer.

2579
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,380
120.

2580
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,030
Are you last hitting a creep?

2581
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:21,810
You're last hitting them.

2582
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:23,470
Wait, do you get points for last hit?

2583
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:25,570
You technically do.

2584
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:28,870
Whenever you get a kill on them, you do get points for the kill.

2585
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:36,280
Yeah, I have 150 now.

2586
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:39,460
I'm not finding any fucking snails.

2587
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,460
We're farming together, though.

2588
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,120
No, it's because we're farming together.

2589
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:43,920
I should probably...

2590
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,100
You're the one that walked to me!

2591
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,480
I know, because I said there was somebody next to us!

2592
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,900
You could've 1v2'd.

2593
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,440
I probably could've.

2594
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:53,960
You could've 1v2'd.

2595
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:55,300
You're a pussy.

2596
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,120
You're a coward.

2597
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,880
I would've taken that 1v2.

2598
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:01,120
There's a blue shield, by the way.

2599
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,200
But now that you said that, I'm gonna take that blue shield.

2600
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:11,360
I'm gonna throw my blue shield and take that blue shield.

2601
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:14,000
You walked by a loot crate and didn't even loot it, bro.

2602
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:17,520
Oh, and there's another blue shield?

2603
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,280
Let's go.

2604
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,740
Wait, where's our...

2605
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,580
Where's our area to deposit?

2606
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:24,140
It's right over here.

2607
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,340
The one in front of me?

2608
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:26,900
Is it this?

2609
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,460
Yeah, you could go to this one right here, actually.

2610
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,220
I'm heading over.

2611
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:46,370
Wait, so do I just get it so we get the blue shield thing?

2612
01:55:48,050 --> 01:55:49,370
Don't buy the one in there.

2613
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:51,170
It's gonna cost more power.

2614
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:55,150
We'll just go to a shop to buy it.

2615
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:56,970
Oh, okay, so go to the yellow shop.

2616
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:59,090
Go to the yellow shop to do it.

2617
01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:02,590
We need to go here, though, to scan for the...

2618
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:05,790
You scan it now, and then I don't have to.

2619
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:06,930
Yeah.

2620
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:08,830
Shop time!

2621
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:11,650
Is that you that shot?

2622
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:12,190
Yeah.

2623
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:18,090
I deposit 380.

2624
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:20,250
No, no, no, it's over here.

2625
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:22,210
I see it, I see it.

2626
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:22,870
Over here.

2627
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:26,750
P. Diddy costs 675 power.

2628
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:27,830
Oh, we have 380.

2629
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,730
Yeah.

2630
01:56:29,050 --> 01:56:31,670
I have 280 now.

2631
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:33,470
What did you spend?

2632
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:34,850
Why?

2633
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:36,190
I got you a blue!

2634
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:38,470
If I die, I don't spawn with it.

2635
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,690
I get a shitty white one.

2636
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:40,990
Oh, that's on you.

2637
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:42,530
Just don't die.

2638
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:43,870
I'm trying not to.

2639
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:44,850
That's why I bought a blue shield!

2640
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:46,530
Just don't die.

2641
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:48,450
That's all I'm saying.

2642
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,580
I think I'm lost.

2643
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:54,480
Where am I?

2644
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,980
You're still underground.

2645
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:58,000
Oh, fuck!

2646
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:00,740
I'm going to kill this bot for shield.

2647
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,500
I'm killing a bot.

2648
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,660
You'll be fine.

2649
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,040
I'm going to push, I'm going to push, I'm going to push.

2650
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:12,440
I'm heading over, I'm heading over.

2651
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:18,040
Hey, at least you get your blue shield.

2652
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:19,580
It's froggy?

2653
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,240
At least you get your...

2654
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,360
Oh wait, it's two people.

2655
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,960
At least you got your blue shield.

2656
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,240
No wonder I couldn't hit him.

2657
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:31,880
He was lagging all over the place.

2658
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:34,560
I'm lost.

2659
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:35,720
Yeah, you are.

2660
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:36,840
We're OSHA certified.

2661
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:37,860
Just follow the exit signs.

2662
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,840
There's exit signs?

2663
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:40,780
Yeah, yeah.

2664
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,260
Look at the walls.

2665
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:42,520
Oh, there it is.

2666
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:42,940
Okay.

2667
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,720
Just follow the exit signs.

2668
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:48,520
Oh, nice.

2669
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:49,140
I got it.

2670
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,180
I figured it out.

2671
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,160
I figured it out.

2672
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,600
Every time you cough, I want to cough with you.

2673
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:00,040
There's so many blue armors.

2674
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:03,240
I found money.

2675
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:04,300
Yeah, yeah.

2676
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,140
I found 135 along the way.

2677
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:08,560
Okay, so we're getting pretty close to Diddy.

2678
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,280
How much do we have left?

2679
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,580
Uh, 125.

2680
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:12,380
We have 200.

2681
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:13,740
I want to say...

2682
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,980
like a little 200 more left, I think.

2683
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:19,400
Bro, why did they make it so expensive?

2684
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:27,100
Well, I built it, and we recently had some changes to how much specific modules cost.

2685
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:28,200
Literally today.

2686
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,800
Yeah, but they should have made it cheap for today.

2687
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:30,740
It got a little bit more expensive.

2688
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,820
Just for today, it should be a little cheaper.

2689
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:35,500
No, I totally agree.

2690
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:38,140
They should make it cheaper forever, so that way I don't have to spend that much next time.

2691
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:39,380
I think there's someone near me.

2692
01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:45,170
I think I heard gunshots near me.

2693
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:46,970
Uh, probably me.

2694
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:49,310
It was like two miles left.

2695
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:52,110
Interesting.

2696
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:54,950
You used the power and, didn't you?

2697
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:57,090
Nope, I don't know where my shop is.

2698
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:00,090
Uh, there are shops underground, too.

2699
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,170
Oh, there's one over here.

2700
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:05,650
If I die with this, it was meant to be.

2701
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:07,950
Alright, I have 515.

2702
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:09,650
You have 60.

2703
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:12,750
Is that enough?

2704
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:19,650
Uh, it would be enough if you were able to buy my gun, but I spent money to buy my shield, remember?

2705
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,810
So I just need like 200-ish more.

2706
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:22,470
Almost 200.

2707
01:59:23,150 --> 01:59:23,590
200?!

2708
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:28,410
Okay, we now need 675.

2709
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:29,810
No, don't do this to me, I'm just a little guy.

2710
01:59:29,810 --> 01:59:32,730
We need like 50 or like 60 power left, okay?

2711
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:38,800
I have a guy on me.

2712
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:40,220
Kill him.

2713
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:41,840
I can't.

2714
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:42,820
Why?

2715
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,060
He's like, I only have a shotgun.

2716
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:50,970
He's trying to kill me.

2717
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:53,430
I don't know where he went.

2718
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:55,170
He just stopped.

2719
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:57,430
Probably ran back.

2720
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:59,190
Probably scared of you.

2721
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:00,030
Okay.

2722
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:03,210
What?

2723
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:05,130
Oh, where did he go?

2724
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,790
Oh, he went that way, okay.

2725
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:07,750
I didn't see him.

2726
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:10,010
I'm just gonna give up.

2727
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:12,490
I'm just fucking trying to farm.

2728
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:15,090
Alright, the good news is, I can buy it now.

2729
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:16,590
Ah, finally!

2730
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,990
Okay, I'm gonna go spawn where you are at.

2731
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:24,770
I have exactly the amount needed for 1,000 oil bottles.

2732
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:25,330
Here we go.

2733
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:28,190
Alright, I'm respawning in 6.

2734
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:36,670
I'm gonna head straight to you and then I'll play the game.

2735
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,830
Yeah, then you'll play the game perfect.

2736
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:41,390
Oh shit, hey.

2737
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:49,150
Alright, I'm heading over.

2738
02:00:49,490 --> 02:00:50,510
I'm driving over.

2739
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:51,690
You're driving over?

2740
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,490
Stay above ground.

2741
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:54,930
Wait, there's some snails here.

2742
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:00,340
Alright, now I'm driving over.

2743
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,650
I hear gunshots.

2744
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:06,070
I hear a lot of gunshots.

2745
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:06,710
Alright, keep going.

2746
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:12,050
There, and here's all the ammo for it.

2747
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:14,750
If I die, do I keep this gun?

2748
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:16,750
No, but I can give it back to you.

2749
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:20,650
Buy a shield over here real quick.

2750
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:22,110
Jesus Christ.

2751
02:01:24,530 --> 02:01:25,730
Because you definitely need one.

2752
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:26,270
Okay.

2753
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:31,330
Can you buy me this gun right here?

2754
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:33,690
Because I need another gun besides my sniper.

2755
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:34,890
Because I gave you miners now.

2756
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:38,550
Can you switch that out?

2757
02:01:39,330 --> 02:01:41,250
You don't want that?

2758
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:42,530
I don't want that one.

2759
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:43,730
I want the one that I just asked for.

2760
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:47,270
Yeah, but if you're a gamer, guns don't matter, right?

2761
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:49,870
Except for this gun.

2762
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:51,210
Because this gun definitely matters.

2763
02:01:51,810 --> 02:01:53,010
It's exactly what happens.

2764
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,190
Right here, right here.

2765
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:55,210
Oh, okay.

2766
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:58,330
I'm not there yet.

2767
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:00,750
Where are they?

2768
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:04,050
He's right in front of you.

2769
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:05,530
I just got shredded.

2770
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:07,270
Oh my god, okay.

2771
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:11,410
I hit him for 68, but I don't think that matters.

2772
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:16,790
Because I have a sniper, so I don't want to risk it.

2773
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:18,290
Oh no!

2774
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:21,790
No, why are you following

2775
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:27,460
me?

2776
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,620
Okay, well now we've got two P-Diddies on the battlefield.

2777
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:32,240
I've got one, you've got one.

2778
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:33,260
Oh, they're fighting.

2779
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,740
Good, good, good.

2780
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:38,140
I think they're still below ground.

2781
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:40,860
I'm right next to you.

2782
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:41,600
I'm right below you.

2783
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:48,320
I think they're getting out right now.

2784
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:49,640
Yeah, yeah, they're out.

2785
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:50,020
They're out.

2786
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:53,000
Someone's right behind me.

2787
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:54,700
I killed the guy with the core.

2788
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:55,780
Nice.

2789
02:02:58,720 --> 02:02:59,580
You can get the core.

2790
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:00,300
You can get the core.

2791
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,620
Go, go, go, do your thing.

2792
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:03,300
No, you do your thing.

2793
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,700
I told you, you're the objective.

2794
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:06,480
I'll do the thing, I'll do the thing.

2795
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:07,480
Do the thing!

2796
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:10,260
He was AFK because he was trying to stream save.

2797
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:11,880
I'm pretty sure.

2798
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:15,580
I'm pretty sure he was AFK pulling up my stream being like, where are they?

2799
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:17,540
And then I just shot him in the head.

2800
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:18,240
I...

2801
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,020
Probably was.

2802
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:22,620
I fucking knew it.

2803
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:26,860
He was like, where did they go?

2804
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:27,680
I have to go all the way over there.

2805
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:28,640
I have to go all the way over there.

2806
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:29,660
So you gotta protect me.

2807
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,320
I'm trying my best.

2808
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:33,000
Me five.

2809
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:35,760
Hi.

2810
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:36,920
Is he on the ground?

2811
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:38,300
I got him.

2812
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,540
He's dead.

2813
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:41,920
GG.

2814
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:49,620
That's fucking right.

2815
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:51,660
Karma for trying to stream snipe.

2816
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:54,920
That's what you get.

2817
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,780
Trying to find where I was.

2818
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,480
Stream sniping in this day and age?

2819
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:04,240
Unheard of.

2820
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:07,680
Oh, someone's coming towards me right now.

2821
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:10,540
I am...

2822
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,840
Oh, they have cars, good luck.

2823
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:13,740
Yeah.

2824
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:17,320
Like, I ain't catching up to that car.

2825
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,300
At our base?

2826
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:22,400
At our base?

2827
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,480
Oh, what the fuck?

2828
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,320
You're so dead.

2829
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,380
Oh my god, I'm so fucking dead, dude.

2830
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:29,980
Jesus, they both just weird.

2831
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:32,240
I guess I'll head up here.

2832
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:32,580
It's Eco!

2833
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:33,620
It's Eco!

2834
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:34,920
I'm gonna head over here.

2835
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,200
Look at that, deserved.

2836
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,760
I'm gonna chill up here.

2837
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:50,160
Deserved.

2838
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:52,680
Wait, where do they have to go?

2839
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:54,880
They have to go to their base.

2840
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:55,820
Where's their base?

2841
02:04:58,940 --> 02:05:00,620
Uh, I actually don't know.

2842
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,720
Oh, they're getting shot at.

2843
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:04,140
Wait, there's a guy right in front of me.

2844
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:06,400
Just look at him.

2845
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:12,500
Oh, I just fucking hit him to the respawn screen.

2846
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:15,600
Alright, they're getting shot at, so we can go over there.

2847
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,220
Let's take this bridge.

2848
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:22,590
Wait, there's guys behind.

2849
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:24,710
I'll get him.

2850
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:27,830
I won't actually, but it's a thought that counts.

2851
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:29,670
Oh, I hit 77.

2852
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:32,030
I shot him.

2853
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:35,730
They're right in front of us now, I'm pretty sure.

2854
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:37,250
Yeah, they are.

2855
02:05:39,070 --> 02:05:40,470
Oh, nice.

2856
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:42,410
Grab it!

2857
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:44,230
I can't, somebody else has it.

2858
02:05:44,590 --> 02:05:45,070
Wait, already?

2859
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:46,690
Yeah, there was another squad.

2860
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:02,580
There we go.

2861
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:06,200
The dude moved all the way to the respawn screen, lol.

2862
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,960
Alright, you go get that.

2863
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,080
I go heal.

2864
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:13,620
Actually, no, I don't.

2865
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:16,020
Woah, why are you shooting at me?

2866
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:16,900
I have nothing.

2867
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:21,000
Oh, I didn't reload.

2868
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:23,060
I didn't reload, I didn't reload.

2869
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:24,600
I didn't reload either, shit.

2870
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:25,800
I got him.

2871
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:29,760
Yeah, but I did most of the damage.

2872
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:32,940
Oh, I got that guy.

2873
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:35,000
I'm dousing right now, I'm too weak.

2874
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:36,400
I got no shields.

2875
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:39,920
Go do your thing.

2876
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:40,920
I'm doing my thing.

2877
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:43,960
Very ouchy, very demure.

2878
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:45,860
What the fuck are these guns being?

2879
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:47,800
Surge beam?

2880
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:49,180
The fuck is that?

2881
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,300
Those are really good actually, those are healing gloves.

2882
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:54,260
Oh, I'm not taking it.

2883
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,600
I'm getting sandwiched.

2884
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,400
Fuck, dude.

2885
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,960
Dude, Jesus Christ.

2886
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:00,280
Oh, from there!

2887
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:03,760
Like right in front of me.

2888
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:09,240
No, I lost both the good guns.

2889
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,280
I was like, what is going on?

2890
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:19,860
Alright, I'm on my last life here.

2891
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:21,120
You've got three still.

2892
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:26,080
B is right there, we could go back for it.

2893
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,580
I need the gun.

2894
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:29,380
Nice.

2895
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:34,120
Holy shit, how do you have so much ammo for these?

2896
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:35,460
I spawn with it.

2897
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:37,700
Yeah, it's a heavy weapon.

2898
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:43,640
You drive there, I use the car.

2899
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,240
Wait, they're like right over here.

2900
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:52,120
They won't expect it when I'm like slowly walking over.

2901
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:58,420
Where are they going?

2902
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,200
They're like doing a big circle basically.

2903
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,560
Like, where is their base?

2904
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,580
Right behind.

2905
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:17,450
Oh my God, this guy can't be real.

2906
02:08:17,570 --> 02:08:19,430
I refuse to believe he's a real person.

2907
02:08:20,270 --> 02:08:22,350
Oh my God, now he hits everything?

2908
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:31,780
Um, I might be fucked a little bit.

2909
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:32,660
No!

2910
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:33,620
He's low!

2911
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:33,660
No!

2912
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:36,380
I'm fucked around!

2913
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:40,420
I'm fucked around.

2914
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:43,800
I'm fucked around because I was like that guy can't be real.

2915
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:47,120
No!

2916
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:49,380
Oh wait, you're dead.

2917
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:51,820
No, I don't have your gun then!

2918
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,160
You can buy me back.

2919
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,800
I do respawn with it.

2920
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,980
Wait, do I buy you back at the base?

2921
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,000
Uh, no.

2922
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:05,360
So whenever you respawn, I'll have a little marker for you to follow.

2923
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,980
It'll take you straight to it to respawn me.

2924
02:09:10,850 --> 02:09:11,270
Okay.

2925
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:13,350
You should have enough power to buy me back.

2926
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:15,950
I haven't bought stuff so... Yeah, you should be good.

2927
02:09:16,190 --> 02:09:16,750
Where is it?

2928
02:09:19,290 --> 02:09:21,190
There it is.

2929
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:21,650
Sorry.

2930
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:22,710
I was tabbed out.

2931
02:09:23,690 --> 02:09:29,450
There's this little blue square hexagon in the middle of your screen which says 140, 136.

2932
02:09:29,450 --> 02:09:30,430
Oh, there it is.

2933
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:30,690
Okay.

2934
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:34,310
Oh my god, it's so far!

2935
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:35,830
It's not that far.

2936
02:09:36,050 --> 02:09:38,110
You also run faster with the 3 when you press 3.

2937
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:39,670
Oh, it's just like a knife.

2938
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:40,790
Yeah.

2939
02:09:42,830 --> 02:09:45,190
I think it's below actually.

2940
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:45,730
Below?

2941
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:46,950
Yeah.

2942
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:53,530
Yeah, fall all the way down.

2943
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:54,670
Don't go right, go left.

2944
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:57,190
Jesus, I'm being tracked.

2945
02:09:57,410 --> 02:09:57,730
Why?

2946
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:00,390
I think you ran into somebody's like sports trap.

2947
02:10:00,530 --> 02:10:01,630
It's a cool thing.

2948
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:04,770
It's like, how am I being trapped right now?

2949
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:06,890
Oh, okay, there you go.

2950
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:07,490
Alright, give me your gun.

2951
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:16,550
Where is it?

2952
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:19,030
I didn't spawn with it.

2953
02:10:19,370 --> 02:10:24,150
I didn't pick what I didn't spawn with.

2954
02:10:25,290 --> 02:10:25,770
Okay.

2955
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:27,250
Okay.

2956
02:10:29,570 --> 02:10:30,430
Hold on, hold on.

2957
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:30,970
Let's go over here.

2958
02:10:31,670 --> 02:10:31,990
Okay.

2959
02:10:32,850 --> 02:10:33,490
Let's go over here.

2960
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,520
Wait, you don't have to buy it again?

2961
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:44,400
There's no way you can afford it.

2962
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:49,950
There's no way, I knew it.

2963
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,570
There's no way.

2964
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:53,570
I'm fucking heavy.

2965
02:10:54,210 --> 02:10:56,210
I don't know why... Here, here, here, take this one.

2966
02:10:56,370 --> 02:10:57,570
I have another custom.

2967
02:10:57,570 --> 02:10:58,650
Nice.

2968
02:10:58,870 --> 02:11:00,050
It's Kendrick Lamar.

2969
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,970
Okay, not like us.

2970
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:03,350
Alright.

2971
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:06,330
Oh yeah, I hear you.

2972
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:09,030
I am disappointed, chat.

2973
02:11:09,210 --> 02:11:10,410
I am disappointed.

2974
02:11:10,990 --> 02:11:17,790
I wasted my money on a guy that's been feeding all game.

2975
02:11:19,350 --> 02:11:20,870
I'm so disappointed.

2976
02:11:21,070 --> 02:11:23,850
I would never bring this man back if he was a random.

2977
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:29,090
If he was not a developer of this game I would never bring...

2978
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:31,410
I would block this guy right away.

2979
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:33,350
I would block him.

2980
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:36,330
Oh wait, exit this way.

2981
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:37,670
We still have a chance though.

2982
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,830
Exit this way.

2983
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:42,350
How the fuck do I?

2984
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:46,930
See, you should have an extra life for us.

2985
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:48,690
How do I get out of here?

2986
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:57,930
How do I get out of here?

2987
02:12:04,150 --> 02:12:05,370
We got an extra life.

2988
02:12:06,730 --> 02:12:07,090
Here?

2989
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:13,170
We're going back the same way we came.

2990
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:14,970
This one is supposed to be confusing.

2991
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:16,550
This is supposed to be a really tight quarter.

2992
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:20,790
Wait, is this a shotgun that you gave me?

2993
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:23,150
Yeah, it's a single shot though.

2994
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,930
Shoot a shot and get a feel for it.

2995
02:12:26,290 --> 02:12:26,650
Okay.

2996
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:28,930
The reload is not that bad.

2997
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:31,210
Yeah, the reload is supposed to be super duper fast.

2998
02:12:31,210 --> 02:12:33,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2999
02:12:38,110 --> 02:12:39,570
How long am I going to be trapped?

3000
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:40,830
I don't fucking know.

3001
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:41,970
You know the map.

3002
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:44,150
Wait, where's Gorilla?

3003
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:45,490
I want to be a Gorilla.

3004
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:46,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3005
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:47,670
You go do your thing.

3006
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:48,290
No, no, no, no.

3007
02:12:48,370 --> 02:12:49,890
You go put your thing.

3008
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:53,950
Gorilla should be, I believe, right here.

3009
02:12:54,410 --> 02:12:55,470
Oh no, that's a robot.

3010
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:58,110
Don't ignore that ping.

3011
02:12:58,190 --> 02:13:01,230
I think Monkey should be right here.

3012
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:03,070
Why isn't it pinging?

3013
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:05,370
Okay, you go do your objective.

3014
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:06,470
I'm heading over to Monkey.

3015
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:08,050
Okay, okay, go get Monkey.

3016
02:13:08,490 --> 02:13:10,030
I'm heading over to Monkey.

3017
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:13,730
Nobody is getting the Gorilla.

3018
02:13:13,970 --> 02:13:15,610
Oh, wait, can you ping that again?

3019
02:13:17,630 --> 02:13:18,070
Well...

3020
02:13:18,070 --> 02:13:18,890
Okay.

3021
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:20,590
I'm heading over.

3022
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:22,670
I don't know if it's on though.

3023
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:23,290
It should be on.

3024
02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:25,370
I'm heading over to the Gorilla.

3025
02:13:27,390 --> 02:13:29,090
Is it in the admin offices?

3026
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:30,970
Uh, no.

3027
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:33,590
Am I pinging in the right place here?

3028
02:13:33,730 --> 02:13:33,990
Sorry.

3029
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,690
I'm trying to play at the same time.

3030
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:38,290
Maybe...

3031
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:39,730
You know.

3032
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:42,370
I'm kind of like walking around.

3033
02:13:42,850 --> 02:13:44,270
Oh, Creature Containment, I found it!

3034
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:45,910
No!

3035
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:49,290
Can I kill the person in it?

3036
02:13:50,050 --> 02:13:51,250
I did, I killed him.

3037
02:13:52,070 --> 02:13:53,270
Somebody was in him.

3038
02:13:53,390 --> 02:13:54,230
I killed the guy.

3039
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:54,970
Somebody was in him?

3040
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:56,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there was a guy in him.

3041
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:57,230
It doesn't even have a name.

3042
02:13:57,370 --> 02:13:59,870
I think, literally, I'm not even kidding.

3043
02:13:59,970 --> 02:14:02,210
I think somebody got into the Gorilla Lizard and left the game.

3044
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:04,750
Fucker.

3045
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:06,350
I have an invisible gun.

3046
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:09,390
There's no name on it.

3047
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:11,530
I'm looking at the kill feed and there's no name on it.

3048
02:14:11,570 --> 02:14:14,430
I genuinely think someone griefed the hell out of that.

3049
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:15,970
I have an invisible gun.

3050
02:14:16,210 --> 02:14:17,190
I don't...

3051
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:18,970
How do I shoot?

3052
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,010
What happens when you shoot it?

3053
02:14:22,710 --> 02:14:25,130
It shoots, but the gun's invisible.

3054
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:30,170
Just go into your inventory, press tab, and then just click on the gun with your left click and then pick it back up.

3055
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:31,250
That might fix it.

3056
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:36,590
No, it's just an invisible gun.

3057
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:38,350
It might just be the bug, then.

3058
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:41,290
We have an invisible bug right now for specific weapons.

3059
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:41,690
Oh my god.

3060
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:44,090
It's not P. Diddy, though, is it?

3061
02:14:44,330 --> 02:14:47,690
No, it's the guy I killed, the random dude I killed.

3062
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:49,150
Oh, not P. Diddy, not like us.

3063
02:14:49,150 --> 02:14:49,990
Kendrick Lamar, there we go.

3064
02:14:50,810 --> 02:14:51,890
It's just a random...

3065
02:14:51,890 --> 02:14:53,770
Oh wait, are we gonna get that...

3066
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:54,650
Oh, we're gonna get C.

3067
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:55,670
I'm gonna go for B, then.

3068
02:14:56,170 --> 02:14:56,730
Yeah, yeah, go for B.

3069
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:57,550
We got C, easy.

3070
02:14:58,690 --> 02:14:59,490
Literally uncontested.

3071
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:01,450
Yay!

3072
02:15:03,610 --> 02:15:04,410
Holy shit!

3073
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:06,070
That's a tank to bring a tank over.

3074
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:07,610
Oh, they got a Deathbringer?

3075
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:09,890
Be careful, it's got lots of point...

3076
02:15:09,890 --> 02:15:10,670
like, shooties on it.

3077
02:15:10,690 --> 02:15:11,810
Wait, why is he looking...

3078
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:14,150
Go to B!

3079
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:17,850
Why is he looking at me?

3080
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,490
Go to B!

3081
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:20,870
Go to B!

3082
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:22,310
Unless he's part of that team, I guess.

3083
02:15:22,370 --> 02:15:24,130
Maybe he's part of that team, that makes more sense.

3084
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:26,990
Can't believe it.

3085
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:28,230
I didn't even get to be a gorilla.

3086
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:31,350
That was the only thing I wanted to do.

3087
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:34,490
Yeah, no, I feel really, really bad for you.

3088
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:36,490
Seems like someone quite literally got in there.

3089
02:15:36,490 --> 02:15:37,650
I can't believe it.

3090
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:41,190
Somebody would do that in a video game?

3091
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,510
We're gonna...

3092
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:45,750
I'm gonna go into our logs for this match and see who it was.

3093
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:46,910
I'm gonna go...

3094
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:48,270
Yeah, that's right.

3095
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,470
That's fucking right.

3096
02:15:49,610 --> 02:15:49,870
Remember.

3097
02:15:50,910 --> 02:15:52,890
Oh my god, they're fighting for it now.

3098
02:15:54,370 --> 02:15:55,250
I'm gonna wait.

3099
02:15:55,510 --> 02:15:57,390
Yeah, no, they're fighting for B.

3100
02:15:57,730 --> 02:15:58,390
I'm waiting.

3101
02:15:58,790 --> 02:16:00,510
I'm gonna wait.

3102
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:02,010
I have my invisible gun ready.

3103
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:10,260
Holy shit.

3104
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:13,980
Bro, I can't shoot with this gun.

3105
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:16,460
JK, I can.

3106
02:16:16,940 --> 02:16:17,340
I can.

3107
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:20,180
This is a good gun.

3108
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,240
It's invisible.

3109
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:23,100
I have no crosshair.

3110
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:28,560
Oh my god.

3111
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,260
This is not fair.

3112
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:31,220
I literally have zero crosshair for this gun.

3113
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:34,260
Your chat saw an extra life, by the way.

3114
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:35,920
It's right next to you, actually.

3115
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:37,740
It's a big old plant right here.

3116
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:40,000
There should be a heart in the middle of it.

3117
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:43,800
Oh,

3118
02:16:47,210 --> 02:16:47,730
this one.

3119
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:48,030
Yeah.

3120
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:51,330
There you go.

3121
02:16:51,410 --> 02:16:51,710
Nice.

3122
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:55,950
Alright, I'm here.

3123
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:57,890
They have a bio core.

3124
02:16:59,810 --> 02:17:01,310
I'm going behind them.

3125
02:17:03,530 --> 02:17:07,910
This invisible gun, they'll never see it coming because I can't even see this gun.

3126
02:17:09,410 --> 02:17:10,630
I got him!

3127
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:16,830
Alright, I'll get the core.

3128
02:17:17,570 --> 02:17:19,370
Oh, that was the guy with the core?

3129
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:20,010
Okay.

3130
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:24,540
Hey, that's PDiddy!

3131
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:27,420
Oh, you found PDiddy?

3132
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:28,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3133
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:29,160
I found it!

3134
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:34,420
Obviously, the invisible gun is actually OP.

3135
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:37,840
I just can't see anything on it.

3136
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:41,100
I'm reloading.

3137
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:43,060
Are you okay?

3138
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:46,480
Oh, he's coming over!

3139
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,300
Holy shit, he's heading over to me.

3140
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:55,320
Broke him, broke him, broke him, broke him.

3141
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:57,920
Where is he?

3142
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:59,500
Oh, dude, he fucked me up!

3143
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:04,890
I fucked him up, though.

3144
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:08,090
Yeah.

3145
02:18:09,710 --> 02:18:10,910
Wait, I should...

3146
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:11,810
Wait, you have the core.

3147
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:13,450
He has a tank.

3148
02:18:15,170 --> 02:18:16,530
Oh, pick up the core, though, if you can.

3149
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:17,930
No, but he has a tank, though.

3150
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:21,190
It's fine, it's fine.

3151
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:22,310
Let them take the cap.

3152
02:18:22,410 --> 02:18:23,850
Let them fight for it.

3153
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:25,250
I'm just gonna stay up here.

3154
02:18:25,410 --> 02:18:27,290
I wanna keep my invisible gun.

3155
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:30,190
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3156
02:18:30,270 --> 02:18:34,070
I just wanna climb up.

3157
02:18:37,230 --> 02:18:39,010
The core's still there, by the way.

3158
02:18:39,630 --> 02:18:43,290
Yeah, I think the person in the tank wants to try to bait you to grab it.

3159
02:18:43,710 --> 02:18:45,430
Yeah, that's why I'm not fucking grabbing it.

3160
02:18:46,110 --> 02:18:46,810
That's why!

3161
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:49,330
That's why I'm fucking not grabbing that shit.

3162
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:53,690
Oh, what the fuck?

3163
02:18:54,050 --> 02:18:54,450
There's so many people.

3164
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:55,990
There's another...

3165
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:57,010
Is that the same tank?

3166
02:18:58,310 --> 02:18:59,210
No, there should be only one tank.

3167
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:01,130
Yeah, that's the same guy!

3168
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:06,260
68?

3169
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,500
He's behind you?

3170
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:08,520
Yeah, yeah.

3171
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:10,460
I'm trying to grab the core right now.

3172
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,160
Oh my god, you're crazy.

3173
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:16,340
I don't know where... where did he go?

3174
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:17,760
Oh, they're right here, fuck.

3175
02:19:18,220 --> 02:19:20,520
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to find him for you.

3176
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,200
I'm literally above you.

3177
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,120
I'm literally behind you.

3178
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:27,100
It's okay, they're fighting, they're fighting!

3179
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:27,900
Just run, just run!

3180
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:28,960
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

3181
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:32,040
I'm watching!

3182
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,560
They're still fighting.

3183
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:47,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they don't know, they don't know.

3184
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:48,860
They're literally just fighting each other.

3185
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,320
Let them fight.

3186
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:58,610
What the fuck?

3187
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:00,690
This cat is not real, that's not a real man.

3188
02:20:00,850 --> 02:20:01,850
There's no way.

3189
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:03,570
He just took three bullets out.

3190
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:08,750
Is that it?

3191
02:20:10,930 --> 02:20:11,650
Is that it?

3192
02:20:11,710 --> 02:20:12,230
Did we do it?

3193
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,910
I don't see anybody dying.

3194
02:20:14,190 --> 02:20:14,750
Did people die?

3195
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:16,510
I knocked...

3196
02:20:16,510 --> 02:20:19,350
I downed somebody, but I think maybe he got rezzed?

3197
02:20:19,410 --> 02:20:20,030
Question mark?

3198
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:23,610
Yeah, that's what I think too, because I don't see any deaths on the kill feed right now.

3199
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:25,610
I don't see anybody running to you, so...

3200
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:27,870
I'll head over.

3201
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:31,090
Oh shit, someone's coming right now on vehicles.

3202
02:20:31,410 --> 02:20:31,650
Oh no.

3203
02:20:32,730 --> 02:20:34,830
Oh, I'm very far, I'm so far.

3204
02:20:35,570 --> 02:20:37,630
I didn't think they were gonna come over.

3205
02:20:39,810 --> 02:20:40,670
Leave me alone!

3206
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:41,830
There's like two squads here!

3207
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:42,630
Wait, what?

3208
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:43,850
They waited for you?

3209
02:20:43,850 --> 02:20:46,090
Yeah, they like, they drove their ass to me.

3210
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:46,970
Oh my god!

3211
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:49,270
You'll be fine.

3212
02:20:49,690 --> 02:20:50,830
We have another life.

3213
02:20:51,490 --> 02:20:54,090
Oh bro!

3214
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:56,030
You have another life, you'll be fine.

3215
02:20:56,310 --> 02:20:58,790
The other team is actively protecting me, I'm not even kidding.

3216
02:20:58,890 --> 02:20:59,450
Holy shit!

3217
02:21:01,710 --> 02:21:04,070
Guys, protect him and I'll come back to the game.

3218
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:11,470
All you stream snipers watching right now...

3219
02:21:11,470 --> 02:21:12,970
That'd be so fucking hilarious.

3220
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:16,010
I know you're watching the stream.

3221
02:21:17,010 --> 02:21:18,050
Protect him!

3222
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:19,730
And I'll come back.

3223
02:21:20,430 --> 02:21:20,950
Whoa!

3224
02:21:21,330 --> 02:21:22,870
And then I get shot at?

3225
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:26,050
Oh my god.

3226
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:28,670
You can spawn back at the home base here, by the way.

3227
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:31,350
Just click on the little truck icon at your respawn screen.

3228
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:32,990
The truck respawn?

3229
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:35,530
Bro, he like... where did he come from?

3230
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:36,410
I didn't know!

3231
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:38,930
My invisible gun!

3232
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,070
My invisible gun!

3233
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:47,750
I'm so sad.

3234
02:21:48,650 --> 02:21:50,850
I lost the invisible gun.

3235
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:52,950
It was so strong.

3236
02:21:54,650 --> 02:21:55,670
What was it firing like?

3237
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:57,750
It was like a...

3238
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,050
It was just...

3239
02:21:59,050 --> 02:22:00,970
It was like a... I don't know how to explain it.

3240
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:02,430
It just feels like a good gun.

3241
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:05,310
If you were to say...

3242
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:08,150
The rate of fire, was it like an assault rifle?

3243
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:09,270
It was like an SMG.

3244
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:10,430
Okay, yeah.

3245
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:11,650
I figured as much as an SMG.

3246
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:14,210
Yeah, but I could do long range with it.

3247
02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:14,830
That's the thing.

3248
02:22:14,830 --> 02:22:17,410
It was an SMG, but it worked with long range.

3249
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:19,470
Wait, we win?

3250
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:20,930
Wait, they were stream sniping.

3251
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:22,030
I fucking knew it.

3252
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:24,710
I fucking...

3253
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:25,530
I knew it.

3254
02:22:25,970 --> 02:22:27,390
I fucking knew it.

3255
02:22:27,470 --> 02:22:29,350
I knew they were stream sniping.

3256
02:22:29,410 --> 02:22:31,990
Look at that, we did it.

3257
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:37,070
Right now, if you're watching the stream, get out!

3258
02:22:40,250 --> 02:22:42,390
If you're watching the stream, leave!

3259
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:44,190
Okay, we won.

3260
02:22:44,190 --> 02:22:44,530
We still win.

3261
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:47,350
With the truck, we still win it.

3262
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:51,690
Look at that!

3263
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:53,050
We did it!

3264
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,790
We won!

3265
02:22:57,150 --> 02:22:58,150
I am sorry.

3266
02:22:58,930 --> 02:23:00,570
It's okay, we still won.

3267
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:02,310
I got two events claimed.

3268
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:03,770
What the fuck does that mean?

3269
02:23:03,890 --> 02:23:04,890
I'm a control freak.

3270
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:07,610
I mean, understandable, but what does that mean?

3271
02:23:08,350 --> 02:23:09,270
So, there's...

3272
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:11,550
The big thing with Ascendant is events.

3273
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,670
Remember the air strike that we had?

3274
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:15,310
That's an event.

3275
02:23:15,590 --> 02:23:17,670
We have tons of those.

3276
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,810
Those are like what make...

3277
02:23:18,810 --> 02:23:20,350
They're like map modifiers.

3278
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:22,250
And here we go again.

3279
02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:23,610
Top fragger.

3280
02:23:24,650 --> 02:23:25,610
And more damage.

3281
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:28,170
Honestly, you had P. Diddy.

3282
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:30,370
You had the power of P. Diddy in your hands.

3283
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:32,430
No, it was my invisible gun.

3284
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:35,550
My invisible gun.

3285
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:37,790
Did all of it.

3286
02:23:39,150 --> 02:23:39,590
GGs.

3287
02:23:40,310 --> 02:23:40,710
GGs.

3288
02:23:41,810 --> 02:23:42,550
That was fun.

3289
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:43,450
It was fun having you.

3290
02:23:43,670 --> 02:23:46,110
I'm glad we were able to come back in and play.

3291
02:23:46,850 --> 02:23:48,170
I knew it.

3292
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:51,730
I knew he was being a fucking tsundere right there.

3293
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:53,890
Shut up, dude.

3294
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:55,110
Look at that, guys.

3295
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:57,790
They were glad I was back.

3296
02:23:57,890 --> 02:23:59,590
All that shit talk he did.

3297
02:23:59,650 --> 02:24:00,970
He's a fucking pussy.

3298
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:01,830
I knew it.

3299
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:03,630
Fuck you, your mom, dude.

3300
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:08,890
GGs.

3301
02:24:08,930 --> 02:24:11,110
Thanks for inviting me back again.

3302
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:12,310
Yeah, for sure.

3303
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:16,230
Hopefully, your chat feels inclined to give it a shot.

3304
02:24:16,430 --> 02:24:17,250
It's a lot of fun.

3305
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:21,230
Hopefully, next time around, we'll get the Doki clan in the game.

3306
02:24:21,330 --> 02:24:22,290
Yeah, yeah.

3307
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:24,350
Yeah, guys.

3308
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:25,150
All right, guys.

3309
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:25,910
Like I said...

3310
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:27,170
Oh, nice.

3311
02:24:27,250 --> 02:24:28,450
I got 17 friends.

3312
02:24:28,550 --> 02:24:30,230
I bet you don't have 17 friends.

3313
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:31,630
I have...

3314
02:24:31,630 --> 02:24:32,470
Let me double check here.

3315
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:34,670
That's right.

3316
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:37,830
How the fuck do you have so many friends?

3317
02:24:39,070 --> 02:24:40,150
I have 27 friends.

3318
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:41,230
Guys, you know what to do.

3319
02:24:43,070 --> 02:24:43,710
This is my...

3320
02:24:43,710 --> 02:24:44,490
I know exactly what to do.

3321
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:46,250
I just need more friends than this guy.

3322
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:51,630
Guys, this is my ID.

3323
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:53,250
I think I have...

3324
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:53,790
Oh, no, I don't.

3325
02:24:53,870 --> 02:24:54,090
Never mind.

3326
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:56,330
This is my ID, guys.

3327
02:24:56,590 --> 02:25:00,670
As long as I have 27 friend requests, then I'm happy.

3328
02:25:01,310 --> 02:25:02,950
That's all I need to know.

3329
02:25:04,090 --> 02:25:05,170
Oh, I'm at 20!

3330
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:06,530
It's getting there.

3331
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:09,530
You've had that account for...

3332
02:25:09,530 --> 02:25:11,670
maybe potentially years.

3333
02:25:11,990 --> 02:25:12,730
But look at that.

3334
02:25:12,810 --> 02:25:14,030
I already have 20 friends.

3335
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:15,550
For years?

3336
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:18,270
To be fair, I've only been working here for a year.

3337
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:22,490
I have 21 friends now, guys.

3338
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:23,490
Hey, guys.

3339
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:25,310
I'm going to talk to my chat.

3340
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:27,130
Give some final words.

3341
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:38,310
A huge shout out to all the devs and I guess Jedi for playing with me and for inviting me back!

3342
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:41,110
Inviting me back to try Ascendant again.

3343
02:25:42,370 --> 02:25:42,710
Yeah!

3344
02:25:43,450 --> 02:25:44,630
Thanks so much again.

3345
02:25:45,290 --> 02:25:47,130
We'll see what happens next time.

3346
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:50,590
Maybe I'll have a better shitter gun.

3347
02:25:53,090 --> 02:25:55,070
I'm going to talk to my chat.

3348
02:25:55,070 --> 02:25:56,490
I'll see you later!

3349
02:25:57,010 --> 02:25:57,890
Have a good day!

3350
02:25:58,010 --> 02:25:58,150
Bye!

3351
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:00,150
Feel better!

3352
02:26:00,410 --> 02:26:01,030
Thank you!

3353
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:04,390
Huge shout out!

3354
02:26:04,470 --> 02:26:05,310
Wait, do I have more friends?

3355
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:08,050
We're almost getting there, guys.

3356
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:14,610
If you guys want to check out Ascendant, feel free to click on...

3357
02:26:14,610 --> 02:26:15,710
It's free right now!

3358
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:16,570
It's free to play.

3359
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:20,010
And so you can actually check it out at the moment.

3360
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:24,330
Just click on the link in the description or pinned in the chat box.

3361
02:26:25,070 --> 02:26:27,630
It really does help me a lot and the sponsor a lot.

3362
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:28,690
If you give it a try.

3363
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:34,410
Huge shout out for them for bringing me back as a paid sponsor.

3364
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:41,350
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching me play Ascendant and getting to know more about the game.

3365
02:26:41,670 --> 02:26:44,270
Honestly, my favorite part was actually being the gorilla.

3366
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:48,990
The gorilla was just so fun!

3367
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:51,450
You just walk around spitting on people.

3368
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:55,590
It was so fun!

3369
02:26:56,210 --> 02:26:57,410
Just spitting on people.

3370
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:59,770
I was just going...

3371
02:27:01,710 --> 02:27:03,250
Winton jump.

3372
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:04,970
Winton spit.

3373
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:11,710
Really, the gorilla was better than the invisible gun.

3374
02:27:13,970 --> 02:27:14,970
But yes!

3375
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:21,290
Please check out the game and support the devs.

3376
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:26,030
I'm trying to see if there's anything else I need to say.

3377
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:31,250
Trying to be a professional streamer right now.

3378
02:27:32,930 --> 02:27:35,490
There's a lot of stuff you can do in the lobby.

3379
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:47,030
I believe the open beta ends on the 21st of October.

3380
02:27:47,890 --> 02:27:56,170
If there's an open beta for the Steam Next Fest which means a lot of games are now open for beta and free to play to check out.

3381
02:27:57,150 --> 02:28:00,410
Please wishlist the game to support the devs and everything.

3382
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:04,530
Huge shoutout to PlayFusion for the sponsor and The Ascendant.

3383
02:28:05,170 --> 02:28:07,930
Even though they were like we're going to blacklist you, don't get it.

3384
02:28:07,950 --> 02:28:10,790
They brought me back and this time I got paid to do this.

3385
02:28:12,830 --> 02:28:13,150
Haha.

3386
02:28:14,950 --> 02:28:16,930
Peer pressure works again.

3387
02:28:17,410 --> 02:28:19,730
Everything always goes well for Doki.

3388
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:23,470
Hey guys, I'm going to head off now.

3389
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:26,070
As always I do have another stream.

3390
02:28:26,470 --> 02:28:30,590
I have Silent Hill 2 tonight in about a couple of hours.

3391
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:32,970
I do have an off stream collab.

3392
02:28:33,550 --> 02:28:40,250
It's apparently another Mario Party collab but I'm not sure if the participants are confirmed.

3393
02:28:41,370 --> 02:28:45,970
I'm not sure guys if it's not the same people.

3394
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:46,990
I'm sorry.

3395
02:28:49,410 --> 02:28:57,310
It's supposed to be me, Masayoshi, ChocoBars, IronMouse, and Ellum.

3396
02:28:57,470 --> 02:28:59,070
I'm not sure though if it's fully confirmed.

3397
02:28:59,830 --> 02:29:02,730
I won't be streaming on Twitch.

3398
02:29:03,330 --> 02:29:07,370
I won't be because I do have another stream at 5 at Silent Hill 2.

3399
02:29:07,750 --> 02:29:11,190
So that's why I don't want to do too many streams.

3400
02:29:11,650 --> 02:29:13,570
But yes, I'll see you guys later everybody.

3401
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:20,430
As always everyone, stay hydrated, pause, check out to get that blood flowing, and if you stay up for me head to bed because you deserve it.

3402
02:29:20,490 --> 02:29:21,850
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3403
02:29:22,330 --> 02:29:23,190
Bye guys.

3404
02:29:23,730 --> 02:29:26,010
The time is literally like now.

3405
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:31,070
It's supposed to be like now.

3406
02:29:31,330 --> 02:29:33,570
So I'll see you guys there I guess.

3407
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:34,750
Bye everyone!

3408
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:35,310
Bye!
