1
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,850
No, I followed you like when you were at your peak, so...

2
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,770
Oh, ow!

3
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,630
Ow, okay.

4
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,430
You know what?

5
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,830
You can just take the attitude.

6
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,490
Ow.

7
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,690
I guess I'm washed up, Jack.

8
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,510
I mean, how many years ago was...

9
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,070
I guess I'm washed.

10
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,230
Washed up.

11
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,270
I mean, it was one click.

12
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,630
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

13
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,290
How about this?

14
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,610
How about this?

15
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,370
I'll follow you back.

16
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,870
Yeah?

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,630
I'll follow you back.

18
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,110
Yeah?

19
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,910
All of you shut up, my friend Fuzzy Stucks.

20
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,910
All right, all right.

21
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,970
Okay, follow me first.

22
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,330
No, no, no, no, no.

23
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,050
This is bad.

24
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,470
No.

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,370
No, no, no.

26
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:39,970
Follow me first.

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,950
How would I know?

28
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,670
I already did my one click.

29
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,350
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

30
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,210
Because that was besides the point, okay?

31
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,730
You're not fucking nervous.

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,210
You're not fucking nervous.

33
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,210
You're not fucking nervous.

34
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,230
You're not fucking nervous.

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,290
You're not fucking nervous, bro.

36
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,610
See that?

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,810
Like, that's besides the point, okay?

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,750
Dude, this is like a more skill-based game.

39
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,270
All right, all right.

40
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,010
How about you follow me first and I'll give you your shout-out?

41
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,650
It's just that easy.

42
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,230
I'm scared.

43
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,550
Because that's the thing.

44
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,590
It's the issue, right?

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,550
It's the issue.

46
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,230
Yeah?

47
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,010
Whether Fuzzy gets the shout-out or not, it doesn't benefit me at all.

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,370
Yeah, but you clearly want to do this for your chatter.

49
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,890
You clearly, because it's day two and you're still on about this Fuzzy guy.

50
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,690
You could have moved on after day one.

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,530
Yeah, but I don't think he can move on.

52
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,210
That's the issue.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,210
Yeah, so if you really like your chatter, if you really appreciate them, follow me on Twitter right now.

54
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,410
Fuzzy, Fuzzy, are you in my chat still?

55
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:33,850
How much?

56
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,750
Or Fuzzy, ditch that guy and come to my chat.

57
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,750
I'll appreciate you.

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,630
Fuzzy, Fuzzy, you're, like, you're Fuzzy.

59
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,710
Fuzzy sucks.

60
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,590
Now's the time to like him.

61
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,630
Fuzzy, if you come to my chat, I'll give you a shout-out and I won't even end.

62
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,090
Only on my stream.

63
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,610
Yeah, no, he just said, I'm in Doki's chat right now.

64
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,570
Oh, shit, yeah, and your guy was like, I'm the Sonic chatter too.

65
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,870
Oh, man, your fat's coming to me now.

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,110
I don't need that follow.

67
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,130
I got Fuzzy already.

68
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,850
Take him, take him.

69
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,950
You don't need him?

70
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,590
All right.

71
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,430
That's why you got ninthplace.com a breaker, Fuzzy.

72
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,450
Other viewers in Sonic chat, I would appreciate you.

73
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,130
I would follow somebody to give you that shout-out.

74
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,070
But apparently, Sonic chat is the best way to get that shout-out.

75
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,770
Sonic doesn't care.

76
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,150
Sonic doesn't care at all.

77
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,990
It's literally one click!

78
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,670
That's right!

79
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,370
The offer's gonna go!

80
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:34,090
Alright, if you don't do that follow, you'll never get that shoutout or Sonic or Fuzzy back.

81
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,290
Fuzzy, you're gonna have to beg me for this.

82
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,650
You're gonna have to beg me for this because there's no incentive.

83
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,510
The fact that you can't even do one click...

84
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,050
It's a lie!

85
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,050
Fuzzy, I didn't mean it.

86
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,350
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,930
Fuzzy, you don't have to beg in my chat.

88
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,190
Listen, Doki, I can tell we're both stubborn people, so how about this?

89
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,190
I don't follow you.

90
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,770
Yeah?

91
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,590
But...

92
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,110
But?

93
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,290
You shout out Fuzzy anyway.

94
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,130
Alright, goodbye.

95
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,170
Fuzzy's my chatter now.

96
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,950
You know what?

97
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,350
Take him!

98
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,970
You know what, Fuzzy?

99
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,490
You're gonna have him!

100
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,110
You know what?

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,810
I'm out of here!

102
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,290
I'm out of here!

103
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,750
He's the viewers in Sonic's chat!

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,390
I won't do the run that he did!

105
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:33,270
Listen, if there's a chance in this next minigame where I can save your life and, you know, we can both, you know, survive and thrive together, okay?

106
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,390
I'm clicking the eject button and I'm gonna watch you... I'm gonna watch you perish!

107
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,010
Okay?

108
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,810
I'm gonna watch you perish!

109
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:39,690
Okay?

110
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be...

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,570
All I'm saying is that I have the support of my fans.

112
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,510
I don't know about you.

113
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,490
I'm gonna be clasping my hands together, okay?

114
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm gonna be clasping my hands together.

115
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,390
I guess you fall to your demise.

116
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,030
Feels like you're projecting Sonic.

117
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay?

118
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,470
Is this a bad thing?

119
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,150
Oh shit!

120
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,170
Fuzzy, thanks for the sub, Fuzzy!

121
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,750
Oh my god!

122
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,470
Fuzzy, you're not a real one.

123
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,210
You're not the real one.

124
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,010
You won't do stuff for your homies.

125
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,290
I'm not real at all.

126
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,390
I'm the real one!

127
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,110
Good job, Fuzzy!

128
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,310
Hey guys, so like...

129
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,470
Yeah, like...

130
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,210
that came out of nowhere.

131
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,390
I was literally eating...

132
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,670
And then Sonic just came over, and was like, hey...

133
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,870
And I was like, hey...

134
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,330
while I was trying to eat.

135
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,650
I was really trying to speedrun my fucking lunch.

136
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,130
During the waiting room.

137
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,780
And...

138
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,510
Okay...

139
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,990
I have my half-finished fucking meal in front of me.

140
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,150
Um, the content came to me.

141
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,110
Yeah, SonicFox jumpscare.

142
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,650
I was like, oh shit, okay.

143
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,490
I guess it's content time.

144
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,110
Hello everybody, welcome to day two.

145
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,070
You know like, okay, you know what's funny?

146
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,410
After day one, I was like, oh my gosh, why did I...

147
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,570
I was like, oh my god.

148
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,330
I could have been eliminated and just chilled.

149
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,110
And like, I told my friends, and my friends were like, bro, you could have like...

150
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,810
Why did you do this to yourself?

151
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,710
And I was like, but I just wanted to win.

152
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,890
I just wanted to survive.

153
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,270
And then, yeah, my friends were like, you're so stupid.

154
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,470
So, I guess I'll be here for days.

155
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:42,770
Day two!

156
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,050
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get eliminated on day two though.

157
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,250
Oh my gosh, but my exposure!

158
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,370
My free exposure, chat!

159
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,130
For the 1k?

160
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,430
Bro, 1k I need to survive for like, two more days, guys.

161
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,570
Like, this lobby is like 90% Minecrafters.

162
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,070
There is no way any of us are gonna... any of the normies out here that don't play Minecraft...

163
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,850
are gonna survive to day three and four.

164
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,330
Oh my god.

165
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,230
Anyway, so yeah.

166
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,490
Welcome to day two of the Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

167
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,610
The haunted house.

168
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,130
I think the next, this game, this game that we're gonna be doing...

169
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,790
is like, we're supposed to like, dodge the monsters or something.

170
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,170
And like, run from them and avoid them.

171
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,490
So, that's basically it.

172
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,590
I don't know if the...

173
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,630
Let me know the cinematics.

174
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,350
By the way, there's no emote mode today.

175
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,250
Yeah, apparently the monsters are gonna be chasing us.

176
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,610
Like, we have to cross some zones.

177
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,330
And then we have to...

178
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,710
We have to cross some zones and...

179
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,250
Get to the monsters and...

180
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,910
Like, avoid the monsters and stuff to the safe zone.

181
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,230
What else do I want to say?

182
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,710
Oh yeah, there's no emote mode this time.

183
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,610
Because there's nothing to ghost at the moment.

184
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,650
So, there's no emote mode.

185
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,830
So, you guys can like, backseat me for...

186
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,330
You know, if there was...

187
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,630
If there was no emote mode in the very first game, I would have known about the...

188
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,270
The tech.

189
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,090
You guys would have yelled at me about this...

190
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,290
The jump tech, guys.

191
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,650
You guys would have done...

192
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,310
Yelled at me about this.

193
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,190
Anyway...

194
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,270
Is Fuzzy still in my chat, Fuzzy?

195
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,610
Oh wait, I hear Goomy.

196
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,590
Goomy!

197
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,130
Hi!

198
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,090
Donkey, I was looking for you earlier and I found you but you were AFK.

199
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,750
Wait, oh!

200
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,210
Oh yeah, yeah, now I'm not...

201
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,530
I was eating.

202
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,730
Wait, why is there a ghost here?

203
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,450
What's she doing here?

204
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:41,990
I don't know, I'm following her.

205
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,270
Donkey, you can rest people in the next game.

206
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,950
Oh, okay, okay, we gotta stick together.

207
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,670
It's like Apex Legends.

209
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,570
Okay, okay, okay, we gotta stick together.

210
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,930
Hear my voice.

211
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:53,970
Well...

212
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,130
Yeah.

213
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,310
Don't... I'll be screaming.

214
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,590
Don't worry if I die.

215
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,470
I'm gonna stick with Antfrost.

216
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,550
And you can stick with me with Antfrost.

217
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,210
Oh, okay, okay.

218
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,610
And then Antfrost will carry both of us.

219
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,450
Yeah.

220
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,230
Yeah?

221
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,770
Yeah, because he's so strong.

222
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,710
Yeah, you're so...

223
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,390
Oh, my God.

224
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,070
Antfrost, have you been working out?

225
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,490
Whoa!

226
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,550
Whoa!

227
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,210
Oh, my God!

228
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,690
Have you tried?

229
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,210
Has anyone ever told you that you might be the best Minecraft player in the server?

230
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,030
I mean, yes, thank you, Charlie.

231
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,570
You're my best friend.

232
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,930
Okay, I don't think this ghost leads to anything.

233
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,470
I don't think this ghost is leading us anywhere, by the way.

234
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,290
I'm just like, I don't know.

235
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,990
God, I keep...

236
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,570
Me bubby, me bubby.

237
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,670
Cursing on accident.

238
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,790
It's okay.

239
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,530
As long as...

240
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:38,750
You're my best friend.

241
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,190
As long as we...

242
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,450
I think it only matters if you're in the finals.

243
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,950
You've been going around the world.

244
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,030
Yeah, I don't think so, either.

245
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,370
I think they just added that for fun.

246
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,510
I think you are.

247
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,350
I think you're going to make it.

248
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,850
You're going to be fine.

249
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,750
I was like, what?

250
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,030
Are we still following the ghost?

251
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:02,730
Okay.

252
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,630
Guys, I don't think the ghost leads anywhere, guys.

253
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,350
Oh, my God.

254
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,990
There's so many people.

255
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,490
There's so many people.

256
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,730
Oh, my God.

257
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,190
I'm getting overwhelmed.

258
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:09,710
Oh, my God.

259
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,270
Please.

260
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:10,930
Please.

261
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,090
Okay.

262
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,910
I need to find a corner to hide.

263
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,350
Sorry.

264
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,750
There's too many voices.

265
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,310
The voices.

266
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,750
Do you hear all those voices?

267
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,810
There's too many voices.

268
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,970
What do they say?

269
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,430
All right.

270
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,130
I'm going to eat my lunch, by the way.

271
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,970
I was speed running in the convention crowd.

272
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,930
No, man.

273
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,390
Oh, my God.

274
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:34,710
But, yeah.

275
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,830
I can't believe it.

276
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,470
The...

277
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,310
What's the word?

278
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:38,710
The...

279
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:50,110
My will to win overpowered my rational thinking because I was just like, you know, I was like, oh, my God.

280
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,410
I made it to the next day.

281
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,390
And then, like, 30 minutes later, the realization came in.

282
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,410
I was like, oh, my God.

283
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,250
I made it to the next day.

284
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,330
Hey.

285
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,970
What is that?

286
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,870
Where's your allies?

287
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,590
I think...

288
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,250
Yeah.

289
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,670
Oh, you need an ally.

290
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,910
Don't you, Irab?

291
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,250
I apparently know where three more are.

292
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,450
Yeah.

293
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,770
Oh, are you desperate now?

294
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,950
I mean, we were both friends in Mendoza, so I think it's...

295
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,550
Oh, yeah.

296
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,890
Yeah.

297
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,930
You want to be allied with a VTuber?

298
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,390
Is that where you're at in your life now?

299
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,490
I have nothing against VTubers.

300
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,550
Yeah.

301
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,690
You have nothing against VTubers?

302
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,570
Yeah.

303
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,650
Is that what your chat's saying, too?

304
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,630
Is that...

305
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,890
My chat does not represent me.

306
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,390
Oh, he doesn't represent you.

307
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,050
Oh, so you're saying your chat's liars, then.

308
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,710
My chat does not reflect me.

309
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,750
Oh, I see.

310
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,250
I see.

311
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,790
Well, you know, like, this game, you can res people, right?

312
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,690
The next game?

313
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:01,950
Yeah.

314
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,010
So, I got you.

315
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,490
You got me.

316
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,430
Yeah.

317
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,250
Yeah.

318
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,830
Right?

319
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,570
Yeah.

320
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,270
Okay.

321
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,050
So, this is the end of the video, guys.

322
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,090
I'll see you guys in the next one.

323
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,210
Bye!

324
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,090
Bye!

325
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:38,210
Bye!

326
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,370
Bye!

327
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,330
Yeah, we have stamina now.

328
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,990
Yeah, apparently like- Oh my gosh, my fucking food.

329
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,250
I can't even eat my food!

330
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,150
God damn it!

331
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,830
All right, we have voice chat reconnecting in three minutes.

332
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,590
Oh no, I lost her.

333
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,310
I looked away to put my food away!

334
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,430
All right.

335
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,530
Yeah, I know E-Rob's desperate now.

336
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,030
He needs- He needs people.

337
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,570
Wait, I lost her.

338
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,430
Guys, where did Gumi go?

339
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,730
Look, I will carry E-Rob, Gumi will carry me, and then- and Frost will carry Gumi.

340
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,230
We'll have like a chain.

341
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,990
We'll have- We'll have a chain of people helping.

342
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,570
Where the fuck did Gumi go?

343
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,890
Oh, guys, guys, it's time to find Where's Gumi?

344
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,590
Our favorite game.

345
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,170
Where- Oh, there- There she is.

346
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,650
Nice.

347
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:33,910
Okay.

348
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,250
All right, the chain will start the circle.

349
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,750
All right.

350
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,410
So like- Apparently, you can res people.

351
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,170
And all we need to do is make sure we don't fucking die.

352
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,330
Or if we do die, that- that we're close to- we're close to our allies.

353
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,270
All right.

354
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,150
Let's see.

355
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,750
Let me- I feel like I should adjust the volume a little bit.

356
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,950
I'll put it at 90 because some of the volume is so fucking loud sometimes.

357
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,670
But also like- Let me double check if- Uh...

358
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,570
I gotta bring up the game volume.

359
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,670
Okay.

360
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,570
My sound guy says bring up the game volume.

361
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,950
Wait, there's like more stuff now.

362
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,770
I guess I'll bring up the music and the environment.

363
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:26,960
Okay.

364
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,300
I don't know if that's better.

365
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,520
All right, let's go.

366
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,360
Also, for all the new viewers here.

367
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,800
I usually stream on the YouTube.

368
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,420
So please check me out over there.

369
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,360
I do like the Twitch events.

370
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,320
The Twitch events, I stream on Twitch because, you know.

371
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,340
It makes sense.

372
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
The Twitch invites- Whoa!

373
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,620
Okay.

374
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
The voices came back, chat.

375
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,380
Oh, sorry.

376
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,620
I misread my sound guy.

377
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,200
He said bring it down.

378
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
I brought it back up.

379
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,600
There we go.

380
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,420
All right.

381
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
The voices came back.

382
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,860
I got him.

383
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,420
I'll unmute when the voices start slowing down.

384
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,380
We'll fix that later.

385
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,300
There's just way too many- Too many people are still alive.

386
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,840
Too many people are still alive for this to work.

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,220
Okay.

388
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,680
The voices, they're so loud.

389
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,980
There's like music playing.

390
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,380
What the fuck?

391
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Oh my God.

392
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,180
Took my meds and the voices.

393
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,980
They're still coming.

394
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,740
Oh my God.

395
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,060
This is purgatory.

396
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,380
We will- We will re-enable it when the gate round starts.

397
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't think- I don't think I can deal with the voices at the moment.

398
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,720
Okay.

399
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,360
So, the voices would- Guys, I forgot to take my meds.

400
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,000
We know I took my meds, guys.

401
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,700
Guys, it's working.

402
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,820
The meds are working.

403
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,140
The voices stopped.

404
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,760
Hahahaha.

405
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,860
Oh my God.

406
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,240
The voices- I told you, medicine works.

407
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,580
Oh God, E.

408
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,260
Robb came back.

409
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,260
Hahahaha.

410
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,140
Don't worry.

411
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,060
I'll - Make sure I keep taking my meds.

412
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,100
Alright.

413
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,600
We're gonna have to- We're gonna have to work together, guys.

414
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,460
This is a teamwork.

415
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,200
E.

416
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,980
Robb found us.

417
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,740
Hahahaha.

418
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,320
We're going to have to work... oh!

419
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,320
Monsters and Prey.

420
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,250
What's this?

421
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,110
I did it!

422
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,250
I did it!

423
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,270
In the basement?

424
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,770
What the fuck?

425
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,530
We have to get to there.

426
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,910
Wait, that means eight people are going to get eliminated.

427
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,730
Wait, what protects me?

428
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,390
Oh shit.

429
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,590
Oh shit, ten of us?

430
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,990
Guys, that's going to be me.

431
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,390
Wait, what happens?

432
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,070
You will be injured and unable to move at a normal speed.

433
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,570
Oh, so I have to make sure I don't...

434
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,370
There's parkour?

435
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,730
Other players can heal you by crouching next to you, speeding up your recovery.

436
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,410
Oh no, there's parkour.

437
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,570
But this is not a time to rely on others.

438
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,690
Because it's everyone who themselves...

439
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,230
Oh no, not platforming.

440
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,970
Each of you will have a stamina meter.

441
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,770
It will decrease as you sprint.

442
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,750
And if it hits zero, you will lose the ability to sprint for three seconds.

443
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,610
It was a good run, guys.

444
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,730
It was!

445
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,030
Guys, it was a good run.

446
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,870
Now we have platforming.

447
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,650
Do your best to arrive in its safe zone as quickly as possible.

448
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,790
It was a good run.

449
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:54,350
If the gate closes before you arrive, you'll be ours forever.

450
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,730
The parkour is not that...

451
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,390
Yeah, okay, for a normal person.

452
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,530
Guys, I already have the VTuber debuff.

453
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,610
I don't know what you want from me.

454
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,610
Guys, I literally learned the jump tech.

455
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,890
Oh my god, there's Kachow!

456
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,910
I learned the jump tech, like, after the game was over.

457
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,390
Okay.

458
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,230
Let's see.

459
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,130
Where is...

460
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,590
Okay, we need to find...

461
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,670
Wait, where's Gumi?

462
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:31,990
Where's Gumi?

463
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,070
Where is she?

464
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,830
I need her to res me when I get hit.

465
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,370
I need her to res me.

466
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,050
I need to be on her backpack.

467
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,130
Where's the backpack?

468
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:43,850
Where...

469
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,650
That's not very helpful, guys.

470
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,490
Where the...

471
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,770
I don't know where...

472
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,050
Oh, there...

473
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,690
There's Gumi.

474
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,830
That's her.

475
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,910
Wait, is that her?

476
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,050
Is that...

477
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,230
Yeah!

478
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,310
Okay.

479
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,130
Doki!

480
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:57,930
Doki!

481
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,970
We all stick together, yes?

483
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,430
Don't worry.

485
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,870
We stick together.

486
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,910
I'll save you if you save me.

487
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,330
Of course.

488
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:04,990
Of course.

489
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,890
Wait, who's our group?

490
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,170
Who else do we get?

491
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,590
People that are coming over here.

492
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,330
We're meeting here.

493
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,750
Whoever's here is in our group.

494
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,570
Oh, okay, okay.

495
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,730
Yeah, we're all going to help each other out, right?

496
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,770
Warren, come here.

497
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,850
You want to join our group?

498
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,410
All right, guys.

499
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,410
Who's in this group?

500
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,930
All my friends.

501
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,270
Like, the cool people?

502
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:21,950
And if you're my friend, you would join.

503
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,690
All my friends are creepers.

504
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,430
No, you guys don't understand.

505
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,870
Are all your friends going to meet?

506
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,710
Oh, that's tough.

507
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,610
This is everyone?

508
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,290
Well, except for this guy.

509
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,450
This guy's not our friend.

510
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,950
That's crazy.

511
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,130
Except for that one guy over there.

512
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,270
He has so many friends.

513
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,130
I wish I had this many friends.

514
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,390
Hey, I wish you too, man.

515
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,070
I don't care who.

516
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,330
We need to get everybody through this.

517
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,070
Oh, you think so?

518
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,510
Well, not everybody.

519
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,290
Yeah, totally need to.

520
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,190
Because you can heal each other.

521
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,550
I'm saving everybody, man.

522
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:57,770
I think we need to stay near the beginning, but don't stay too close to the beginning.

523
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:57,910
Oh, okay.

524
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,610
So you want to like...

525
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,250
Like the front.

526
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,370
So you want to stutter, like get to the other side a little.

527
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,950
Yeah, let the people in the front kind of act like meat shields.

528
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,490
You know what I mean?

529
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,150
Oh, they're aggro.

530
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,190
They're all going to be like...

531
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,310
They're not dying.

532
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,050
They're going to be like crying.

533
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:11,950
Save us!

534
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,510
Save me!

535
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,410
Save us!

536
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,850
And then Madge is going to run past them.

537
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,890
They cried out, save us.

538
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,790
And I said, no.

539
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,490
Okay, buddy.

540
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,470
You can save Goomy.

541
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,390
Wait, where's Ad?

542
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,190
Bye, Goomy.

543
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,830
I thought Ad was supposed to help us.

544
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,230
I'll miss you, Goomy.

545
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,270
All right.

546
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,830
I think we need to gather.

547
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,910
All right.

548
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,050
Oh, okay.

549
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,290
Okay.

550
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,750
I just thought Ad was going to betray us there.

551
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,990
No, he would never.

552
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,850
I know where he lives.

553
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,830
Yeah, where?

554
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,390
I'll keep it a secret.

555
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,190
I'm trying to hear you.

556
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,350
Me and my chat will keep it a secret.

557
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,870
2279.

558
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,650
Acacia Street.

559
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,550
Oh.

560
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,290
Okay.

561
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,950
Oh, no!

562
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,910
Okay.

563
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,010
How am I supposed to...

564
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,870
How am I supposed to win if we don't know his address?

565
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,350
Oh, my God.

566
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,070
Two minutes.

567
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,470
Has it been eight minutes already?

568
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,190
Wait, really?

569
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:07,650
Damn.

570
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,530
All right.

571
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,570
Goomy, you wouldn't let me die, right?

572
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,850
We'll advance to day three together, right?

573
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:26,550
All I'm saying, Goomy, is for the fourth game, if we combine our chat's IQs together to do the puzzle, we might be able to beat one puzzle.

574
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,750
All right.

575
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:27,910
All right.

576
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,270
All right.

577
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,230
We might be able to solve one puzzle together.

578
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,430
Did you hear the lyrics?

579
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:31,850
Okay.

580
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,810
Let's go look for our friends.

581
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,450
All right.

582
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:33,950
All right.

583
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,170
All right.

584
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,890
Oh, my God.

585
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,150
Everybody is talking.

586
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,010
I found one.

587
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,850
All right.

588
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,290
Wait.

589
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,690
Bad Boy Halo is going to help us?

590
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,750
Oh, I found them.

591
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,730
Oh, is that the group?

592
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,550
Yeah.

593
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,430
But it's like bobbing like crazy out of it.

594
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:49,930
It was.

595
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,190
You abandoned us.

596
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:53,790
I was scared.

597
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,890
You're going to make sure we live right at...

598
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,050
I think it's just a bug.

599
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,830
I think it's just a bug.

600
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,910
I think it's just a bug.

601
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,630
Are they going to...

602
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,690
We've got to stick together.

603
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,170
Okay.

604
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:00,490
Yeah.

605
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,690
So, Bad Boy and his stutter like to get to the other side tunnel, too.

606
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,290
He wants to wait to leave a little.

607
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:05,490
Huh?

608
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,830
I don't know about that, either.

609
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,090
He said he wants to use people as meat shields, but I think the monsters reset.

610
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,930
They probably say in areas.

611
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:15,670
Yeah.

612
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,270
Maybe they're saying that so that he's going to make us slow down and he's going to be in the front.

613
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:20,670
Okay.

614
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,830
Why don't we all leave on the right-hand side?

615
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,710
Why don't we all leave to the right-hand side of the gate?

616
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,450
Yeah.

617
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:25,630
Yeah.

618
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:25,810
Yeah.

619
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,810
Turn it to zero.

620
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:26,830
Okay.

621
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,330
I like that.

622
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,470
I like that.

623
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,890
I like that.

624
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,830
That's a good idea.

625
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,670
That's it.

626
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,070
You got it.

627
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,570
You can heal each other.

628
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,010
Okay.

629
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,010
Yeah.

630
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,670
Stick to the right side.

631
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,110
Yeah.

632
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:33,690
Stick to the right side.

633
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,150
Oh, one more minute.

634
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,050
One more minute.

635
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,130
Wait.

636
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,430
Shane, can't we build that?

637
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,550
Yeah.

638
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,290
I'm scared.

639
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,110
Exactly.

640
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,110
Oh, my God.

641
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,490
There's no way they're going to let us die.

642
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,030
Right?

643
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:42,870
Okay.

644
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,250
Revive me.

645
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,150
Yeah.

646
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,550
Yeah.

647
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:45,750
Yeah.

648
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,570
Revive me, too.

649
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,730
Well, we come as a couple.

650
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,070
Yeah.

651
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,490
Yeah.

652
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,130
We're like a package two for one.

653
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,390
A two for one deal.

654
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,190
Oh, my God.

655
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,390
There's so many people.

656
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,230
I'm using the stamina thing.

657
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,190
All right, Ambrose.

658
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,950
Let's go over here.

659
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,950
Are you running up the car?

660
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,450
Okay.

661
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,230
I'm coming over here.

662
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:07,730
Wait.

663
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,530
You can...

664
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,270
Like, hit W, and then jump, and then go over W.

665
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,330
And just, like, move like that.

666
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,070
What?

667
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,050
What?

668
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,010
Just, like, hit W, and then jump, and then, like, let go over W.

669
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,770
And you sort of, like, jump along like this.

670
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,190
Okay.

671
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,870
I see.

672
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,850
I understand what you mean.

673
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,590
I'm confused.

674
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,370
Okay.

675
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,550
Let's go.

676
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm confused.

677
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,190
Let's go to the right side.

678
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,530
Okay.

679
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:27,890
Let's go to the right side.

680
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,390
I'm confused.

681
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,130
Am I sprinting up this guy?

682
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,370
Oh, God!

683
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,090
Oh!

684
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:32,850
Oh!

685
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,750
Oh!

686
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,830
Oh!

687
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,710
Here we go.

688
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,390
Oh!

689
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,970
Gate opens.

690
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,010
Here we go.

691
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,690
The last turn!

692
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,310
Yeah!

693
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,330
Let's go!

694
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,350
The last turn up!

695
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,450
The last turn up!

696
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:39,890
Yeah!

697
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,130
Where?

698
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,190
Where?

699
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,470
Where's my team?

700
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,510
Please, no music.

701
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,430
Guys, turn off the music.

702
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:48,870
Please.

703
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,490
It's so annoying.

704
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,450
Where's my team?

705
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,590
I don't know where my team is.

706
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,690
It's actually behind you.

707
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,350
It's behind you.

708
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,270
Come, come, come, come.

709
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:56,970
Is that my team?

710
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,570
One guy fell.

711
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,130
I can't see shit!

712
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,930
I'm stuck!

713
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,590
Guys, I don't know where to go!

714
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,450
Help!

715
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,770
Help!

716
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,030
There's too many people!

717
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,510
Guys!

718
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,030
Am I doing anything?

719
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,510
I don't think I can get up here.

720
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,950
What the fuck?

721
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,010
I don't know where to go from here.

722
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,390
This is stressful!

723
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,370
Guys, it's over.

724
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,850
Guys, it's over.

725
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,890
It's so over.

726
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,030
I can't see.

727
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,890
Shane, are you in F5 right now?

728
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,650
Or what are you doing?

729
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,810
Let's go!

730
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,590
Guys, I can't see anyone!

731
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,710
Please get out of my face!

732
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,930
Please get out of my face!

733
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,270
Tender just opened his mouth.

734
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,250
Guys, I don't know...

735
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:06,370
Oh wait!

736
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,170
It's in front of me!

737
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,650
Okay, guys.

738
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,110
I don't see you, but I think you're near me.

739
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,090
I see... I see steps.

740
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,970
Just keep communicating with me.

741
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,630
Just so I know you're near.

742
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,650
You can go under.

743
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,230
You can go under.

744
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,310
Where is it?

745
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,430
I'm so...

746
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,870
I'm so...

747
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,930
I'm so confused!

748
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,050
I'm so...

749
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,250
I'm so confused!

750
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,570
Oh!

751
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,190
He's dead!

752
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:35,770
He's dead!

753
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,630
I thought somebody died!

754
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,730
Oh my god!

755
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:41,630
Oh god!

756
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,110
Oh god!

757
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,950
Oh, F5, you're right!

758
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:45,790
Wait!

759
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,030
No, I can't!

760
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,430
Because I don't know where to look yet!

761
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,310
Oh my god!

762
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,170
He's a dead guy!

763
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,710
Oh my god!

764
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,570
There's so many dead people!

765
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,770
It's okay.

766
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,450
If I don't look behind me...

767
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,970
If I don't look behind me, everything will be fine!

768
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,310
Okay.

769
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,630
Okay.

770
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,410
We're recharging.

771
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,150
Okay, it's fine.

772
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,090
Everything is fine.

773
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,730
Hi, guys!

774
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,070
Okay, we're fine.

775
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,270
I hate this!

776
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,330
We're fine.

777
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,010
There's no way!

778
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,990
We're at the bottom!

779
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,170
Wait!

780
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,390
Alright, guys!

781
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,600
Oh my god!

782
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,280
The first save zone!

783
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,080
We made it!

784
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,640
Oh, that's the save zone!

785
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,040
Okay!

786
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,360
Save zone!

787
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,820
Okay, I didn't like that sound.

788
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,760
That sound was a little scary.

789
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,680
It was a little sus.

790
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,620
Oh, we're all in the save zone!

791
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
So we all have to wait!

792
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,040
We all have to wait!

793
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,020
I think I got something out of my mouth!

794
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,020
Oh my god!

795
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,260
Nice!

796
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,260
We made it, like, barely!

797
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,740
We made it!

798
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,560
We pulled that!

799
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,320
Oh, no!

800
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm so scared!

801
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,660
We did it!

802
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,260
We all made it!

803
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,840
Okay!

804
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,360
Alright, we made it!

805
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,780
We made it!

806
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,800
We made it!

807
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,040
We made it!

808
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,440
It might have been, like, really fucked up, but we made it!

809
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,340
We made it!

810
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,380
We made it!

811
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,740
We made it!

812
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,100
We made it!

813
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,920
We made it!

814
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,880
We made it!

815
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
We made it!

816
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,760
Oh my god!

817
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,580
Thank you!

818
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,380
Oh god!

819
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,000
I feel... oh god, thank you!

820
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,720
Finally!

821
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,840
Everything is nice and quiet now.

822
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,500
We took our beds.

823
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Oh, thank god we took our beds!

824
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,620
Oh my god!

825
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,480
The voices are gone.

826
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,340
I did it!

827
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,100
I couldn't see what was going on!

828
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,160
I have to F5!

829
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,520
Wait, she...

830
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,740
Yeah, yeah, did you F5?

831
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,260
Yeah.

832
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,780
I did a bit!

833
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,360
Yeah, that was fucked up.

834
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,940
I didn't... remember that first... that first obstacle with the trees?

835
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,320
That shit was crazy.

836
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,020
I don't even know how we got there.

837
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,060
I think we got TP'd.

838
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,640
Oh my god, E-Rob, you made it!

839
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,420
Yeah, yeah, were you, like...

840
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,000
Were you, like, 107th or something?

841
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,480
Oh my god, we did it, guys!

842
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yo, we barely made it, Dr. Gluhug.

843
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,640
Oh my god.

844
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,400
It was me and you next to each other and I was like, I don't know what we're gonna do.

845
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,060
It was me and you next to each other and I was like, I don't know what we're gonna do.

846
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,640
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

847
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,100
I'm asleep right now, alright?

848
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,760
I'm not turning off.

849
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,620
Oh!

850
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
I took my meds.

851
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,080
I took my meds.

852
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,660
It's okay.

853
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,640
Oh my god.

854
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,860
Silence.

855
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,800
The voices are gone.

856
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,600
Oh, thank god.

857
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Thank god.

858
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
Oh my god.

859
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,260
Guys, remember to take your meds or you're gonna have to listen to that the whole time.

860
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,400
Remember to take your meds, guys!

861
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,840
Take your meds!

862
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,440
Alright.

863
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,540
We have two more checkpoints.

864
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,440
I think we can make it.

865
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,180
We weren't in the back of the pack.

866
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,820
Chat.

867
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
Like, we weren't...

868
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,680
I think the moment I get hit by the monster, I'm fucked.

869
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,020
I think that's really it.

870
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,540
The moment the monster fucking touches me, like, it's over.

871
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,220
Like, it's so over.

872
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,080
We just shouldn't let the monsters touch me.

873
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
And we should be good.

874
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,540
Oh!

875
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,300
I feel like, yeah, there's no...

876
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,600
I feel like people don't revive.

877
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,020
Because, like, it's just so chaotic.

878
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
There's no way.

879
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,900
It's just so chaotic.

880
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,020
Oh yeah, the parkour's gonna be crazy.

881
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,060
The people who don't have the F5 is gonna get fucked over.

882
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,280
Because I could not see.

883
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,160
I could not see in first person at all.

884
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,260
Everyone's just running.

885
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,660
Remember to conserve your stamina.

886
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,720
Yeah, I need to remember to do that too.

887
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,220
Oh wait, it's time.

888
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,160
We gotta get there.

889
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,380
It's okay, we have peace and quiet.

890
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,960
I can't wait for more people.

891
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,860
I feel like we should be eliminating more people.

892
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,560
It's just...

893
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,700
108 is still too many people.

894
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,360
It's still too many.

895
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,740
We need to get rid of some.

896
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,400
Yeah, this was not meant for this many people.

897
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,360
I feel like maybe, like, have people each have their own parkour area.

898
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,560
Like, maybe divide it by 30.

899
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,460
And then we have 30 of these.

900
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,520
And then we have multiple parkour areas and have 30 people in each.

901
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,620
I feel like that would have been better.

902
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,920
Yeah.

903
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,220
It's just...

904
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,500
multiple lobbies.

905
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,760
This is just too much.

906
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,020
This actually is too much.

907
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,340
I mean, I cannot... I can't even see where I am right now.

908
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,340
Like, guys, I don't know if I should play an F5.

909
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,160
I can't see where my body is.

910
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,200
Where am I?

911
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm, like, in the...

912
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,420
I've been, like, in the horn.

913
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,280
Holy shit, the game almost crashed.

914
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,880
I'm, like, in the fucking club.

915
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,520
Oh...

916
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,420
Oh...

917
00:33:59,420 --> 00:33:59,640
Oh...

918
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,020
Where am I?

919
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,360
Guys...

920
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,720
Guys, I'm not gonna...

921
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,580
I don't...

922
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,120
Guys, I think this was a mistake, guys.

923
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,600
Guys, this seems to be a mistake now.

924
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,840
Oh, no.

925
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,800
Guys, I think it's over.

926
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,660
Guys, I think it's over.

927
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,700
Guys, I'm doing worse than I actually did.

928
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,560
Oh, no.

929
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,740
Oh, no.

930
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,040
Oh, no.

931
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm doing worse, guys.

932
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,720
Oh, no!

933
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,740
Oh, no, this is bad.

934
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,480
Okay, we gotta... we gotta do this.

935
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,740
I'm actually doing worse now.

936
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,000
We got an F5, everybody.

937
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,140
I can't see.

938
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,620
I actually couldn't see, guys.

939
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
Oh, my God.

940
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,080
Okay.

941
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,340
Don't worry.

942
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,240
It's not over yet.

943
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,400
We just gotta have to make it to the second checkpoint, everybody.

944
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,020
The moment we make it to the second checkpoint, we'll be okay.

945
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,380
Oh, God.

946
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,760
Oh, yeah.

947
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,920
That was definitely a mistake.

948
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,220
Whoever said F5, that was a mistake.

949
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,240
Now we're fucked a little.

950
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Now...

951
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,800
Now we're a little fucked, guys.

952
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay.

953
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,080
Okay.

954
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,360
Oh, I can't... I don't know how to, like, uh, make it so that...

955
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,800
Guys, how do you make it so I don't use my stamina accidentally?

956
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,560
Because...

957
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,980
Because, like, it won't let me cancel it.

958
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,860
I feel like...

959
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,020
I feel like I can't cancel it.

960
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
Oh, I got the one of the...

961
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,040
Got some...

962
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,380
No!

963
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:51,920
No!

964
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,200
Oh, no!

965
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,600
Wait, do we have to do this again?

966
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,060
We do!

967
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,120
No!

968
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
My stamina!

969
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,080
Okay.

970
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,600
Okay.

971
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,960
Okay.

972
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,360
Okay.

973
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,880
Okay.

974
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,040
Alright, we're okay.

975
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,420
No!

976
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,400
We're not okay!

977
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,800
Slow and steady.

978
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,360
Slow and steady, Doki.

979
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,740
Slow and steady.

980
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,140
It's parkour!

981
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,960
There's people worse than you at parkour!

982
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,520
No!

983
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,500
Oh, God.

984
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,420
There's people back there that's worse than you at this.

985
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
It'll be fine.

986
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,100
Oh, God.

987
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,340
There's people that are so cocky when it comes to parkour!

988
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,480
Okay, nice.

989
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,780
You got this!

990
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,820
Do I?

991
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,100
No.

992
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,900
Oh, my God.

993
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,580
My stamina.

994
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,670
Okay.

995
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,290
Oh, there he is.

996
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,110
Oh, God.

997
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,990
Oh, God.

998
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,850
Oh, God.

999
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,670
Oh, God.

1000
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,730
Oh, God.

1001
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,110
Oh, I'm so fucked.

1002
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,810
I'm so fucked.

1003
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,290
No!

1004
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:20,790
No!

1005
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,650
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1006
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,260
Woo!

1007
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,700
Look behind me!

1008
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Is he behind me?

1009
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,560
I don't wanna look!

1010
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,300
Okay.

1011
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,300
Oh, God.

1012
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,380
Oh, God.

1013
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,500
Woo!

1014
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:44,650
Fuck!

1015
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,250
Oh, that's scary.

1016
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,090
That was so scary.

1017
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,870
Oh!

1018
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,530
We're okay.

1019
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,030
We're okay.

1020
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,510
We're okay.

1021
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:51,990
We're okay.

1022
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,430
We're okay.

1023
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,130
That was really scary.

1024
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,750
But we're okay.

1025
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,320
Oh, my God.

1026
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,840
I just saw somebody died in front of me.

1027
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,700
Shit.

1028
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,140
Shit.

1029
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,780
Oh, God.

1030
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,100
Like...

1031
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,960
It's so scary cause like...

1032
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,380
Oh, my hands are shaking.

1033
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,420
I hate parkour.

1034
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,940
Oh, guys!

1035
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,880
This is so bad cause my hands are actually shaking!

1036
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,880
Oh, God.

1037
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,680
Oh!

1038
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,320
Okay.

1039
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,240
We gotta recharge our stamina.

1040
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,180
Oh, God.

1041
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:34,960
Oh!

1042
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,460
My hands are shaking so much!

1043
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,440
Oh, God.

1044
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,640
I have to...

1045
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,060
I'm so nervous.

1046
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,460
So I have to like...

1047
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,920
do it one by one.

1048
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,660
Cause I'm so nervous.

1049
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,340
Cause my hands are shaking so much.

1050
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh!

1051
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,160
Oh!

1052
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,720
Oh!

1053
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,820
Parkour makes me so nervous.

1054
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,680
Okay.

1055
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,880
Everything is okay.

1056
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,760
Oh!

1057
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh!

1058
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,780
Okay.

1059
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,100
Oh, God.

1060
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,980
Oh, God.

1061
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,940
I thought I couldn't see.

1062
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,320
I couldn't see right there.

1063
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,320
Oh!

1064
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,500
Oh!

1065
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,740
Because like there's no way.

1066
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,760
They just have to eliminate two, right?

1067
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,400
There's no way I'm the last two.

1068
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,140
I only messed up the parkour like once.

1069
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,720
Oh, I can't see.

1070
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,900
Why is this so long?

1071
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,800
Why was the first one so short?

1072
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,680
Like... Okay.

1073
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,760
This is bullshit.

1074
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,640
The first one was so short.

1075
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,440
And this feels like a...

1076
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,540
The fucking level gap between the two.

1077
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,920
Jesus.

1078
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,980
Ugh.

1079
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,180
Alright.

1080
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,620
Here you go.

1081
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,340
Please.

1082
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,360
I'd rather be average.

1083
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,360
Let me be the middle of the pack.

1084
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,740
Oh, thank God.

1085
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,240
There's at least two people behind me.

1086
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,460
Thank God.

1087
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,420
There's at least...

1088
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,720
There's at least two people behind me.

1089
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,700
We should be fine.

1090
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,100
Oh my God.

1091
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,060
The fact that no one's at the safe zone yet.

1092
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,840
It's concerning me.

1093
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,180
No one's at the safe zone.

1094
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,140
There's still like 200 fucking parkour.

1095
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,400
It never ends.

1096
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,260
It never fucking...

1097
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,780
It's like the marathon all over.

1098
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:04,700
Oh my God.

1099
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,180
Oh no.

1100
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,920
I hope I have allies.

1101
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,580
I...

1102
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1103
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,680
Okay.

1104
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,660
We got conservative stamina here.

1105
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,800
Oh God.

1106
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,340
Oh God.

1107
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,820
Oh God.

1108
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,260
I'm going left.

1109
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm going left.

1110
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,640
It was too scary so I'm gonna go left.

1111
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:28,950
Oh.

1112
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,750
I hope left is okay because I only have one person I'm following.

1113
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,910
I'm following.

1114
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,590
Okay, nice.

1115
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:37,990
Alright.

1116
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,550
Okay.

1117
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,630
Okay.

1118
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,810
I'm a little worried that there was only one person that was there.

1119
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,030
Okay.

1120
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,070
Oh, I'm getting better.

1121
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,430
Wait.

1122
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,490
Oh God.

1123
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,910
Someone made it.

1124
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,430
That means there's an end.

1125
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,470
Oh my God.

1126
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,210
People are making it.

1127
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,250
That means there is an ending to this.

1128
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,430
Oh my God.

1129
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,550
I can't believe it.

1130
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,310
No!

1131
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,670
Checkpoint's not that bad.

1132
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,390
Okay.

1133
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,770
I didn't fuck up too much.

1134
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,330
I got scared there.

1135
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,410
Oh God.

1136
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:33,830
Here we go.

1137
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,710
Okay.

1138
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,870
Okay.

1139
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,810
Okay.

1140
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,270
Almost scared myself there.

1141
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,290
Okay.

1142
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,510
I've refilled that stamina!

1143
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,770
Oh.

1144
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,750
Okay.

1145
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,570
There is an ending chat!

1146
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,440
The fact that there is an ending gives me so much hope!

1147
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,240
Oh my God.

1148
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,580
There is an end to this madness.

1149
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,960
Oh my God.

1150
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,320
I don't like that numbers are going up.

1151
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,920
Oh no.

1152
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,420
I don't like that.

1153
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,700
I don't...

1154
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,340
Oh no.

1155
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,280
Please tell me I can be middle of the pack.

1156
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,180
Please.

1157
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,500
Let me be the middle of the pack.

1158
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,520
That's all I ask.

1159
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,260
Oh God.

1160
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,480
Oh God.

1161
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,140
Where is everybody?

1162
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,540
Oh.

1163
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,560
58.

1164
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,780
The numbers are increasing, guys!

1165
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,360
Guys!

1166
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,200
Wait.

1167
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,360
Is that it?

1168
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,140
Is that the end?

1169
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,960
Is that it?

1170
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,020
I'm 71!

1171
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,600
Let's fucking go!

1172
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,400
Oh!

1173
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,960
I made it!

1174
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,700
Oh thank God.

1175
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,940
Oh God.

1176
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,140
Oh I made it.

1177
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,300
Oh.

1178
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,020
Okay.

1179
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,660
I'm better than like 40 people.

1180
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,220
Okay.

1181
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,720
We had a very scuff start.

1182
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,800
We had an incredibly scuff start.

1183
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,480
But we still live.

1184
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,800
The start!

1185
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,860
Definitely could be improved by a lot.

1186
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,480
Definitely could be improved by a lot.

1187
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,060
That was...

1188
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,320
That was...

1189
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,100
Oh.

1190
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,780
Yeah we had like a very rough time there.

1191
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,060
Like that was pretty fucking rough.

1192
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:57,480
Yeah.

1193
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,440
No more F5 chat.

1194
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,220
We've learned.

1195
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,120
No more fucking F5 for us.

1196
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,880
Oh.

1197
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,640
Oh I was so stressed out.

1198
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,520
I was so fucking stressed out there.

1199
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,320
I was so fucking stressed out there.

1200
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,740
My hands were literally shaking.

1201
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,900
Oh my God.

1202
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,800
Now they have to eliminate 5 more.

1203
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,400
Oh God.

1204
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,060
I just can't be the last 5.

1205
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,940
If I live.

1206
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,940
If I just can't be the last 5.

1207
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,320
I didn't mess up the parkour!

1208
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,580
So we're okay.

1209
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,980
Oh my God.

1210
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,160
My heart.

1211
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,900
My heart can't take these games.

1212
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,600
My heart can't take these games.

1213
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,820
Where is she?

1214
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,060
Where is she?

1215
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:39,340
Where is she?

1216
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,840
I don't see her.

1217
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,900
You liars.

1218
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,340
You liars.

1219
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,300
Oh.

1220
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:46,980
It's fine.

1221
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,060
I'm just happy that I was 70 so I was like in the middle of the pack.

1222
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,560
But she's right there.

1223
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,680
Where?

1224
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,860
I have to turn off because I took my meds today.

1225
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,940
So I don't hear the voices at the moment.

1226
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,200
So I don't hear the voices at the moment.

1227
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,120
I mean you'll hear her.

1228
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,060
Guys I don't know.

1229
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,400
I might hear her.

1230
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,820
But I'll also hear 30 other voices.

1231
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,580
So I don't know.

1232
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,540
So I don't know.

1233
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,120
I don't know guys.

1234
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,120
I don't really want to hear 30 other voices.

1235
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,540
The dark corner.

1236
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,920
Okay.

1237
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,300
Dark corner.

1238
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,820
Kind of like.

1239
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,120
And then I have to let go of W.

1240
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,160
I'm trying to remember how to look at my...

1241
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,840
I passed it?

1242
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,220
Oh my god.

1243
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,420
I can't find her.

1244
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
Where is she?

1245
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,900
Are you sure?

1246
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,840
Did you guys take your meds?

1247
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,280
Right of the door.

1248
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,160
Oh this is right.

1249
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,160
Oh there she is!

1250
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,660
Hello?

1251
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,640
Who me?

1252
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,500
Oh now you want to look at me you stupid...

1253
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,820
I had it muted!

1254
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,840
I couldn't find...

1255
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,900
I took my meds.

1256
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,080
I took my meds.

1257
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,980
So I couldn't hear the voices anymore.

1258
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,540
I wasn't even talking to you.

1259
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,120
I was in front of you.

1260
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,640
You know I'm blind.

1261
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,720
I appreciate you.

1262
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,400
You know that.

1263
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,960
You turned away from me twice.

1264
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,800
Okay I don't know about that.

1265
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,920
I don't remember that.

1266
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,660
Your chat probably does.

1267
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,960
Okay yes my chat was telling me where you are and I was lost.

1268
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,980
I kept looking around.

1269
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,940
You're hiding in the corridor.

1270
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,800
How am I supposed to see that?

1271
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,480
You were running back and forth here.

1272
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,560
You were running back and forth here.

1273
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,960
And then you just turned away.

1274
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,800
I was like you know what I'm done.

1275
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,040
I don't know.

1276
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,720
You were in the corridor.

1277
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,140
How was I supposed to know?

1278
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,540
What place did you get?

1279
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,580
I got 21st.

1280
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,240
I made a mistake by having F5 and I bumped into everything.

1281
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,980
I was like 70 something so I was like in the middle of the pack.

1282
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,160
Not last.

1283
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,660
I was alone by myself for a while.

1284
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:19,800
Wait really?

1285
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,760
That's scary.

1286
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,780
I didn't get caught by the monsters though.

1287
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,360
I didn't get caught either but I went on the right path.

1288
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,040
Everyone went left so I was all alone.

1289
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,560
Monster on the loose.

1290
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,340
Yeah.

1291
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,760
That was so scary when the monsters were chasing.

1292
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,280
The dog one was scary.

1293
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,380
The one on all fours.

1294
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,740
Oh yeah that guy was huge.

1295
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,860
Honestly I made shatter go in front of me.

1296
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,220
There was a couple people waiting.

1297
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,460
I was like I'm just going to run at it.

1298
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,140
Wait you ran at it?

1299
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,780
How did you live?

1300
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,600
If you have full stamina if you just run past it it won't be able to chase you for long enough.

1301
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,880
Oh my god it's so smart.

1302
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,020
Minecraft tech.

1303
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,560
Guys why couldn't you give me that Minecraft tech?

1304
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,120
There's so many of you.

1305
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,960
One of you guys could have given me that advice.

1306
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,720
One last person.

1307
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,320
That must be so scary.

1308
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,840
Yeah.

1309
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,980
When everyone started coming into the game I was like oh my god I'm all alone.

1310
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,160
Who got eliminated?

1311
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,280
Look at the scene.

1312
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,960
I feel like it's so embarrassing that they put your name up at the top.

1313
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,520
Oh Darryl this guy got eliminated.

1314
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,060
Oh no.

1315
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,820
Look at those people getting eliminated.

1316
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,420
Not us.

1317
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,300
As long as it's not us.

1318
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,980
See that person I could have picked them up and I didn't.

1319
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,640
Let's go.

1320
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,900
High fives.

1321
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,620
High fives.

1322
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,000
Up top.

1323
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,040
Maybe you are a bad boy.

1324
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,620
I am.

1325
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,580
I didn't pick up any randoms.

1326
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,940
Wait if it wasn't me would you pick me up?

1327
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,780
Yeah if it was you I would.

1328
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,240
I would be behind you.

1329
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,180
You have to turn around.

1330
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,620
You're all not turning around.

1331
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,960
You're not turning around for me?

1332
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,260
I'll pick you up.

1333
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,500
See okay wait yeah I will do it.

1334
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,960
Well Dokie here's the problem.

1335
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,220
I think all of us are usually ahead of you.

1336
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,640
One place.

1337
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,340
Yeah but you'll turn around right?

1338
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,220
Yeah totally.

1339
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,020
Yeah you'll turn around right?

1340
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,360
Yeah.

1341
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,620
Girl how are you going to play?

1342
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,940
I'm going to call you on discord if you don't pick me up.

1343
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,020
I'm on do not disturb at all times.

1344
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,200
You have my phone number.

1345
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,980
Yeah I'm going to call you on your I'll call you on your number.

1346
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,160
Just remember I'll call you on your phone number to pick me up.

1347
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,560
I'll call you on your phone number to pick me up.

1348
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,940
I'm going to mute again there's too many voices.

1349
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,900
I'm going to mute again there's too many voices.

1350
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,700
Dude just come over here.

1351
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,100
Yeah but they... but the gates.

1352
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,880
That's where...

1353
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,200
There's three minutes look at the timer.

1354
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,640
But the gates.

1355
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,080
Show mama.

1356
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,260
Oh woah.

1357
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,900
It's a nice party.

1358
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,700
Oh my god that parkour shit stressed me out so much.

1359
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,140
It's a nice party.

1360
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,760
It was so... my hands were shaking.

1361
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,440
Oh I just stopped sprinting after each jump and then I had full stamina the entire time.

1362
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,220
Yeah but it was just so stressful.

1363
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,720
Were you F5-ing the entire time?

1364
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,100
Is that why?

1365
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:36,760
No.

1366
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,880
I was like...

1367
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,780
I was first person.

1368
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,400
After I played it F5 in the beginning it was such a mess because I couldn't see where I am so I just played first person.

1369
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,680
I felt... I feel like this one this next one or the last one will have a lot more monsters.

1370
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,980
Because I feel like this one was parkour heavy.

1371
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,680
Yeah.

1372
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,120
Yeah.

1373
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:54,860
100%.

1374
00:51:54,860 --> 00:52:01,160
I'm pretty sure this one is also parkour because there was like the one with the lava in the cutscene.

1375
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:01,620
We already did the lava.

1376
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,540
No no the full lava though.

1377
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,140
There was like a lot more lava though.

1378
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:05,840
Wasn't it?

1379
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,360
Yeah.

1380
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,560
I feel like we just did that one.

1381
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,180
I feel like I didn't see the other lava area but maybe.

1382
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,560
How many people are you eliminating for this one?

1383
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,680
10 in total.

1384
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,220
So they're eliminating 2 each safety round.

1385
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,240
So this one is 2 then.

1386
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,900
So 4 people have been eliminated already.

1387
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,340
Oh okay nevermind 6.

1388
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,680
It might be 8 people.

1389
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,860
8?

1390
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,340
Guys.

1391
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,600
Do you automatically get up if no one picks you up or are you stuck behind?

1392
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,180
I think so.

1393
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,200
I think so.

1394
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,820
It just takes a while.

1395
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,820
Oh so we can just leave people behind then.

1396
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,660
No no no no no no.

1397
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,020
You leave certain people behind but you'll pick me up.

1398
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,120
Got it.

1399
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,380
Certain people leave behind.

1400
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,780
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1401
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,620
Certain people.

1402
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,100
Yeah leaving certain people behind.

1403
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,820
Yeah yeah yeah but not us.

1404
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,860
Certain people behind.

1405
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,520
Not us.

1406
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,880
If you don't pick me up.

1407
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,820
Gumi will be mad.

1408
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,840
Alright.

1409
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,320
Is that true Gumi?

1410
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:10,680
Gumi?

1411
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,320
Gumi we're a package deal.

1412
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,720
You said we're a package deal Gumi.

1413
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,200
What happened?

1414
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,360
I think I understand what's going on.

1415
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,420
Don't get betrayed by them.

1416
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,600
I just heard something and that's all I hear.

1417
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,920
Don't get betrayed by them.

1418
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,780
Got it.

1419
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,900
Don't get betrayed by them.

1420
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,860
Don't get betrayed by them.

1421
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,800
Don't get betrayed by them.

1422
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,240
I'm not picking up certain people.

1423
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,060
I'm not picking up certain people.

1424
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,440
We know who we're not trusting.

1425
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,900
Don't get betrayed by them.

1426
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,300
I misheard the overhearing.

1427
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,320
No.

1428
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,760
They're telling me to save them.

1429
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,600
We should head over.

1430
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,120
Alright.

1431
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,660
Now I took my meds again.

1432
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,280
Pure silence.

1433
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,080
It's okay.

1434
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,360
I see your colors baby.

1435
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,240
I took the wrong meds.

1436
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,760
I took the wrong one.

1437
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,360
Why?!

1438
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,300
I'm here.

1439
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,160
We're back.

1440
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,140
We're back.

1441
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,020
We're back.

1442
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,780
Woooo!

1443
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,080
Wait.

1444
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:29,600
Wait.

1445
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,500
Where to go?

1446
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:33,500
I...

1447
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,720
I guess here?

1448
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,220
Oh god.

1449
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:40,880
I can't see.

1450
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,000
Oh god.

1451
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,800
I hope front was the right way to go.

1452
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,480
That's what I hope for.

1453
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,980
I'm not using all my stamina, guys!

1454
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,100
I'm actually learning!

1455
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh my god.

1456
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,220
Oh my god, who was that?

1457
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,660
Who was that?

1458
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,580
Who was that, guys?

1459
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,860
Don't look behind!

1460
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,340
If you don't turn around and look, you won't get hurt.

1461
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,860
Guys, I can learn.

1462
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,440
I told you guys.

1463
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,020
I told you guys I can learn.

1464
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,680
I figured it out, guys!

1465
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,780
I figured out how to conserve my stamina!

1466
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,780
If I let go all the buttons, eventually I'll have my stamina.

1467
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,980
Eventually I stop, guys.

1468
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,180
I just gotta let everything go.

1469
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,480
Okay.

1470
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:46,920
What the fuck?

1471
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,240
Oh god.

1472
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,660
Oh, I hear people behind me!

1473
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,280
It's okay.

1474
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:55,980
It's okay.

1475
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,200
There's so many people that got caught.

1476
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,600
I didn't even see the monster!

1477
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,400
That was the scary part!

1478
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,900
I didn't even see the monster there!

1479
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:06,800
Yay!

1480
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,580
Conserving my stamina.

1481
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,440
Oh!

1482
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,000
We're okay.

1483
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,080
Guys, it only took two save zones to learn how to play this game.

1484
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,700
God, Minecraft is so easy.

1485
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,840
It's a fucking game for babies.

1486
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,700
Sorry!

1487
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,460
Holy shit!

1488
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,900
I think somebody died in front of me!

1489
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,840
Holy shit!

1490
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,040
Oh my god!

1491
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,900
I'm pretty sure someone literally died in front of me!

1492
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,280
Oh my god, that was so close!

1493
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,980
Holy fuck, that was actually so close!

1494
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,260
Holy shit!

1495
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,180
Guys, I think...

1496
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,360
It's okay, we're okay.

1497
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,480
Watch your tone!

1498
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,540
Don't ever call Minecraft.

1499
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,480
I'm sorry, Minecraft's not a game for babies.

1500
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,100
I'm so sorry.

1501
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,140
It's a game for adults.

1502
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,060
It's a game for adults.

1503
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,660
For 18 plus and over.

1504
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,640
But like, not that type of...

1505
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:05,780
Woo!

1506
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,160
Woo!

1507
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,880
But not that...

1508
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,140
Woo!

1509
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,180
I'm 18!

1510
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:11,260
I'm 18!

1511
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,500
I did it!

1512
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,600
Oh my god!

1513
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,180
I was ahead of going!

1514
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,580
Oh shit.

1515
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:22,880
Boo!

1516
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,480
I was...

1517
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,780
Come here!

1518
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,580
Ducky!

1519
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,740
I was ahead of you!

1520
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,800
Let's go, let's go!

1521
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,820
No, Ducky!

1522
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,060
I've been standing here!

1523
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,640
No, I got you!

1524
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,120
I was a player!

1525
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,180
I've been standing in front of you!

1526
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,500
You made it!

1527
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:40,740
Oh my god!

1528
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,480
Oh my god!

1529
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,280
We did it guys!

1530
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,680
We fucking did it!

1531
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,860
We're so good!

1532
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,440
We're so good!

1533
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,400
18!

1534
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,780
Let's go!

1535
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh my god.

1536
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,760
Guys, is this what it's like to be a fucking winner?

1537
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,160
Oh my god!

1538
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,560
I'm a... winner?

1539
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,980
I'm not last!

1540
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,820
Let's go!

1541
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,480
Oh my god, guys!

1542
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,500
Oh, Warren TV!

1543
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,380
Yeah, fuck you!

1544
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,620
You fucked me over yesterday!

1545
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,220
Yeah, that's right, Warren TV!

1546
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,020
You lied to me yesterday!

1547
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,560
That's called karma!

1548
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,360
Oh my god!

1549
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,320
I don't think I forgot about yesterday!

1550
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,860
I'm a pro at Minecraft, dude.

1551
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,600
There you go.

1552
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,260
I told you karma was gonna happen.

1553
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,660
Karma's a bitch.

1554
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,840
Oh my god.

1555
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,500
I'm gonna wake up.

1556
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,660
I'm gonna wake up from this nightmare.

1557
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh my god.

1558
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,500
Why was this one so goddamn short compared to what we... like, what?

1559
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Why was this one so goddamn short?

1560
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,460
Okay.

1561
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,280
Alright, turning down master and bringing everything down.

1562
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,720
Okay, we're gonna have to...

1563
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,300
Okay, we're gonna have to bring down the master volume because we have no idea what is anything tied to.

1564
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,020
So we're gonna bring down the master volume.

1565
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,200
We're like trying to figure out what is making the... like the ambient noises.

1566
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,000
And like...

1567
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,300
What is making the ambient noises and the monster noises?

1568
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,320
So we've been trying to figure it out.

1569
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,220
We've been turning everything down but it's not working!

1570
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,960
Like I don't understand!

1571
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,340
Nothing was working!

1572
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,540
Alright.

1573
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,760
Okay, we're just gonna turn up the voice then.

1574
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,480
Alright.

1575
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,560
We tried the weather, right?

1576
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:01,500
Maybe.

1577
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,260
It could be the weather actually.

1578
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,860
Okay, we're gonna turn the weather down.

1579
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,160
But...

1580
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,280
Is this volume too low?

1581
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,320
Was it too loud when we were playing?

1582
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,140
I couldn't tell.

1583
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,420
Honestly.

1584
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,860
Because like...

1585
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,020
Sound guy was saying that the monsters were being too loud.

1586
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,860
So I wasn't sure.

1587
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:23,910
It was fine?

1588
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,410
Yeah, it was.

1589
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,970
It's all over...

1590
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,750
Yeah, it is pretty all over in the place.

1591
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,330
Yeah.

1592
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,870
It was immersive.

1593
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:34,390
True!

1594
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,230
True.

1595
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,090
It was immersive.

1596
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,510
It was so immersive.

1597
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:38,250
Guys, see?

1598
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,690
Every game we learn more about how to play this game.

1599
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,910
We learn more and more about how to play.

1600
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,270
We're getting better chat.

1601
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,830
We're getting better at Minecraft.

1602
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,090
Because Minecraft is not a baby game.

1603
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,270
That was so fucked up.

1604
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,290
I called...

1605
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:03,150
Somebody died in front of me the moment I called Minecraft a baby game.

1606
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,110
That was so fucked up.

1607
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:06,770
I'm like, I'm sorry.

1608
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,130
I didn't mean it.

1609
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,530
I didn't mean it.

1610
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,990
I'm like, where did the monster come from?

1611
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:13,870
Dude.

1612
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,070
Yeah, Minecraft should be an esport.

1613
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,110
There should be a Bed Wars esport.

1614
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:21,630
The views will go insane.

1615
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,570
God struck them for my sins.

1616
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:25,790
God...

1617
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,770
Okay, look guys.

1618
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,990
God's aim is a little bit wonky, guys.

1619
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:29,730
Okay?

1620
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,030
He's not a game...

1621
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,510
God is not a gamer, guys.

1622
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:33,190
Alright?

1623
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,430
He sort of missed...

1624
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:36,030
I don't know.

1625
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:36,750
I don't know.

1626
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,670
He just missed, okay?

1627
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,830
But he taught me a lesson.

1628
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,430
Now I know.

1629
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,550
Never should talk Minecraft.

1630
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,290
No, next game is like a puzzle.

1631
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,090
It's a puzzle game.

1632
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,430
So like, as long as...

1633
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,690
Chat, you gotta help me backseat this, okay, guys?

1634
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,490
Guys, you gotta...

1635
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,430
You gotta help me backseat.

1636
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,450
I believe.

1637
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,110
I believe.

1638
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:04,490
I'll wait.

1639
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:04,990
Hopefully.

1640
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:05,390
Hopefully.

1641
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:05,670
Hopefully.

1642
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,010
Hopefully.

1643
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:06,110
Hopefully.

1644
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,470
Hopefully.

1645
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,710
Hopefully.

1646
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,070
He's still alive.

1647
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,750
I can't believe he's still alive.

1648
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,530
Where's Goomy?

1649
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,410
Where's Goomy?

1650
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,610
We gotta combine our chats together.

1651
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,910
Because if we average...

1652
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:26,150
If we average our chat's IQs together, it'd be like two.

1653
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:27,710
Two brain cells.

1654
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,430
And include Goomy and I.

1655
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,450
Because like, Goomy and I, we add our brains together, it'd be like 0.1.

1656
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,970
But if we add your chat and my...

1657
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:36,690
Like, her chat and my brain cells, it'd be like 0.1.

1658
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,010
But if we add my chat together, it'd be like 2.

1659
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,690
So you guys are like 1.8.

1660
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,550
Alright, we got...

1661
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,170
We can do this.

1662
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,210
We can do this.

1663
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:52,210
If we put all our brains together, we can do this, guys!

1664
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:55,890
There's no way!

1665
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,090
Alright, let's see who has...

1666
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,670
Look at all these dead bodies.

1667
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:01,310
Oh my god.

1668
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:03,790
Look at all these...

1669
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:04,230
That's me.

1670
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,390
I'm still alive, bitches.

1671
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:06,950
I'm still alive.

1672
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,610
But Doki, we have no brains.

1673
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,810
Yep, you have like 0.01%.

1674
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,130
So you add it all together, it would be a 2.

1675
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,010
Guys, it's a puzzle!

1676
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,070
We know me and puzzles, guys!

1677
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,010
All you puzzle dragons who keep telling me to play a puzzle game!

1678
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,810
This is your time to rise up!

1679
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:28,590
Chat.

1680
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:33,870
Literally, whenever you guys are like, Doki, please play a puzzle game!

1681
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:34,910
Play like those...

1682
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:35,370
Like, I can do this!

1683
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:36,590
I can do this!

1684
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:37,910
Guys, play that...

1685
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,330
Play that IQ...

1686
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:39,990
Like, what was it?

1687
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:44,090
The one where you have to draw lines or whatever to solve the puzzle?

1688
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:49,470
This is your chance to rise up and backseat me!

1689
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,310
It was like, Doki, play a little to the left!

1690
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,210
Doki, play!

1691
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,070
Doki, play a detective game!

1692
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:00,130
Doki!

1693
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:04,150
This is it.

1694
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,350
This literally is it.

1695
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:06,650
It's literally your moment to shine.

1696
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,630
I'm too lazy to do puzzles.

1697
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,070
It's okay, we can do this.

1698
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,530
I believe.

1699
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,330
Like, there's no way.

1700
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,990
It's like, we all work... we have... it's like each...

1701
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,050
Some people don't even have a chat to help them, guys.

1702
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,350
They have to use their own brains.

1703
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,590
That's why... that's why we're working together.

1704
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,970
We literally have chat advantage.

1705
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:35,770
And like, the best part is that... I'm sorry to all the Minecraft viewers.

1706
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,950
Like, it's not you guys.

1707
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:39,870
Minecraft viewers that are watching me, this doesn't pertain to you.

1708
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,310
This does not apply to you.

1709
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:45,790
But what's the best part is that we're not Minecraft viewers.

1710
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,290
Our main category is not Minecraft.

1711
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:54,190
So the... so the average age of a dragoon is at least over 13.

1712
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:06,190
So, we have a chance against the other Minecraft players.

1713
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,810
So we can do it, guys!

1714
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,910
But like, if you're a Minecraft viewer and you're watching me, this doesn't apply to you.

1715
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:22,010
Because you're watching me, so your age is already like...

1716
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,370
Gumi!

1717
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,350
Wait, where are you, Gumi?

1718
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:28,530
Gumi?

1719
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,010
Oh wow, it feels better.

1720
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:32,010
Gumi?

1721
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,350
Where's Gumi?

1722
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,210
Am I hearing voices again?

1723
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,910
Where did Gumi go?

1724
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,430
Where is she?

1725
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,810
Did I imagine that?

1726
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,550
You guys heard it too, right?

1727
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:02,790
You guys heard it?

1728
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,530
You guys heard that voice, right?

1729
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,610
Did you not hear what I heard?

1730
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:11,330
Guys?

1731
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,990
Did you not hear... hear... Gumi?

1732
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:17,630
Oh no.

1733
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,110
Guys, I think I'm...

1734
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,310
Oh, Gumi!

1735
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:24,230
Gumi!

1736
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:25,770
I see you running, Gumi!

1737
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,530
I know you're there.

1738
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,210
I know you're in front of me, Gumi.

1739
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:31,990
Gumi, where are you going?

1740
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,750
Gumi?

1741
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:37,430
She's losing...

1742
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,790
Gumi?

1743
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:38,510
Gumi?

1744
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:40,950
Gumi, what are you doing?

1745
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:42,210
Hey!

1746
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:42,970
Gumi!

1747
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,330
Why did you catch up so fast?

1748
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:47,270
I did it.

1749
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,390
I learned the Minecraft tech.

1750
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,130
I was 18th place.

1751
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,050
Are you proud of me?

1752
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:52,710
I am proud.

1753
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:53,690
I was ahead of you.

1754
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,530
Yeah.

1755
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:57,110
Are you proud of me?

1756
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,430
I became the master.

1757
01:06:58,770 --> 01:06:59,090
I am proud.

1758
01:06:59,450 --> 01:06:59,970
I am.

1759
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:00,310
Yeah.

1760
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,890
Yeah, it only took me two save points.

1761
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:05,710
We need...

1762
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,170
We need to do puzzles.

1763
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:08,890
Yeah, yeah.

1764
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:12,190
So your chat and my chat can work together in solving this puzzle.

1765
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:13,710
Yeah.

1766
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:14,710
Right?

1767
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,630
And...

1768
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:16,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1769
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,010
Yeah, yeah.

1770
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,250
Because they said emote only isn't on.

1771
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:21,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1772
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,470
Surely.

1773
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,150
Yeah, so we can backseat.

1774
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,670
We're allowed to get some help.

1775
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,010
Oh, and then like...

1776
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,450
If our chat can look at...

1777
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:28,150
God.

1778
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:30,010
Oh, my God.

1779
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:31,370
No.

1780
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:31,470
No.

1781
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:31,810
No.

1782
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,130
No.

1783
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:33,530
No.

1784
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:33,590
No.

1785
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,130
I already know what you're gonna say.

1786
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:38,610
I mean, people are ahead of us.

1787
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,020
You two in this room over here?

1788
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,660
It's a joke, guys.

1789
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,460
You guys didn't know.

1790
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,320
That's a joke, guys.

1791
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,840
It's a disclaimer.

1792
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,660
Don't do it.

1793
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,900
It's a joke, guys.

1794
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,040
Don't do it.

1795
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,700
Don't do it, guys.

1796
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,100
Guys, we're just joking.

1797
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,920
We're going to use our brains.

1798
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,580
We're not going to use other people's brains.

1799
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,700
We're going to use our brains together.

1800
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,840
And chat's brains, but like with no outside help other than that.

1801
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,070
So I don't know what... Oh wait, there's 20 Easter eggs now?

1802
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:18,690
Wait, what?

1803
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,870
I was not paying attention.

1804
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,310
What are the other Easter eggs look like?

1805
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:27,350
They're TVs again.

1806
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,770
Oh, they're more TVs?

1807
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:31,310
Yeah, I found nine of them already, Doki.

1808
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:31,890
Oh.

1809
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:33,970
Here, there's one right here.

1810
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,770
Oh, they added more TVs.

1811
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:42,750
Oh, I wonder what we get for 20 eggs.

1812
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:48,370
I got 18.

1813
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,170
I'm at 18 as well.

1814
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:51,330
I'm at 17.

1815
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:52,810
What one am I missing that you're at?

1816
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:54,630
Did you get the one behind the stairs?

1817
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,410
Yeah, I got the one behind the stairs.

1818
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,570
I live in Buckingham Palace.

1819
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,850
Where's the others?

1820
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,450
Wait, there's one upstairs?

1821
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:01,970
Wait, wait, wait.

1822
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,650
There's TVs upstairs?

1823
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:06,850
Nah, this is going to be troll.

1824
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,670
I did not say this.

1825
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:08,370
I did not say this.

1826
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,730
Who said this?

1827
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,450
There's a TV in one of the bedrooms.

1828
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:15,370
I searched all six bedroom sections.

1829
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,070
I didn't see one.

1830
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,470
It was like next to a bed.

1831
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,680
You just lied.

1832
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,060
Hey, there could be.

1833
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,640
That lie around is so fake.

1834
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:49,800
I mean, hey, if there was one, then they found an egg.

1835
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:50,640
No, no, no.

1836
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,240
Not like that, no.

1837
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,140
There's no reason.

1838
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,340
There's always a reason, chat.

1839
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,600
There's always a reason.

1840
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,500
Toki, wow.

1841
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,660
Joke keeper.

1842
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,160
Toki, I couldn't find one out here.

1843
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,700
Yeah, I couldn't.

1844
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,840
I like how you knew I was lying when I talked about the bedroom TV.

1845
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,100
Yeah.

1846
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,560
Well, honestly, I didn't even hear you, but I would have known either way.

1847
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:27,700
Yeah, I mean, I just found out about the TV.

1848
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,600
So, yeah.

1849
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,640
Oh, no, it's time.

1850
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,420
We gotta work together.

1851
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,920
He was the only one that didn't run to the bedrooms.

1852
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,780
It's joke keeper time.

1853
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,880
I can't believe it.

1854
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,700
I said that and everybody ran to the fucking...

1855
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,700
Ran to the fucking bedroom.

1856
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,620
Ain't no way.

1857
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,380
Let me find it.

1858
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:55,620
Let me find it.

1859
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,580
That's so funny.

1860
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:58,660
What?

1861
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,290
What's this?

1862
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:08,610
There's a farm.

1863
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,290
Oh, we've been here.

1864
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,670
Isn't this...

1865
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,090
To be fair, this looks like...

1866
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:15,790
La Granja.

1867
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,350
This looks like the...

1868
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,970
This literally looks like the fucking first map.

1869
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,070
Where is he going?

1870
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,630
He just ran past a familiar face.

1871
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,430
Where did he go?

1872
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:29,650
Oh, come on.

1873
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,030
Oh, hey.

1874
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:34,230
There's pictures there.

1875
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,550
Oh.

1876
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,210
There's a lot of pictures there.

1877
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:49,890
Silence.

1878
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,450
Oh, thank god.

1879
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,190
Nice.

1880
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,290
We did it, guys.

1881
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,450
We're free.

1882
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,110
We're free.

1883
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:05,310
Guys, I'm running out of meds, guys.

1884
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:09,690
I don't have... I don't have health insurance, guys.

1885
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,950
I can't keep... I can't keep taking them.

1886
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:15,450
We're gonna run out of meds soon.

1887
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:23,270
Guys, guys, I don't wanna have an addiction, guys.

1888
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,390
Buy more.

1889
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,650
Guys, what if I get addicted to it just like painkillers?

1890
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,570
Guys, I don't wanna be those painkillers, guys.

1891
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,560
Hello.

1892
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,180
Dude, I was talking about how you actually saw me.

1893
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,100
What?

1894
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,220
And how rare it is.

1895
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,160
Yeah, I saw you.

1896
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:45,620
You're like a dinosaur.

1897
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,260
Oh my god, evolving.

1898
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:47,740
You're like a dinosaur.

1899
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,540
You only see things that move.

1900
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,460
Yeah, that's true.

1901
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:49,840
Yeah.

1902
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,200
That's true.

1903
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,460
If you don't move, I don't see you.

1904
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,700
You're like becoming a human being almost.

1905
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,600
I see via...

1906
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:53,880
I see you almost.

1907
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,420
Heat vision.

1908
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,900
I look via heat vision and like movement.

1909
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,840
So if you don't move...

1910
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,220
You're like a human being.

1911
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,500
Yeah, yeah.

1912
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,220
I'm like...

1913
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,840
I think it's the side effects from the meds I'm taking.

1914
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,960
Every time I take it, the voices disappear.

1915
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,240
Oh, I let my voices go.

1916
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,540
You go wild?

1917
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,020
Right now, the voices are going...

1918
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,260
Beedee do do do do.

1919
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,580
Beedee do do do do.

1920
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,860
Beedee do do do do do.

1921
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,140
Beedee do do do do.

1922
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,520
Wait, I don't think that's healthy.

1923
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,000
What?

1924
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:26,840
I don't think...

1925
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,100
I don't think that's healthy, goon.

1926
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,720
And the other one's going...

1927
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,020
Dum dum dee doo ee.

1928
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,500
Dum dum dee doo ee dum.

1929
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,760
Dum dum dee doo ee.

1930
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,200
Dum dum dee doo ee dum.

1931
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:36,980
Bum.

1932
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,080
Ba da da.

1933
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,320
Ba da da.

1934
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,080
Wait, then how do you hear...

1935
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,220
Oh!

1936
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,560
Wait, how do you hear regular people?

1937
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,820
Maybe you're listening...

1938
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:43,440
Hearing the voices.

1939
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,760
It gets transcribed.

1940
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,540
Like there's a...

1941
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,000
There's like a text description.

1942
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,900
There's a little lag.

1943
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,880
Yeah, subtitles underneath the music.

1944
01:13:53,980 --> 01:14:00,280
So while you're talking, I hear, like, Nightcore in my right ear, Hamster's song in my left ear.

1945
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:04,820
Oh my god, you hear the Eurovision song, Nightcore?

1946
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,840
Yeah, that Eurovision song was...

1947
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,420
You know that song is actually from Eurovision?

1948
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,120
Yeah, I know, I know.

1949
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,520
That didn't even win, right?

1950
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,920
That didn't even win Eurovision.

1951
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,060
Yeah, you guys don't know, Rockefeller...

1952
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,580
Yeah, Rockefeller Feet, I honestly thought it was an American song.

1953
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,260
I thought Rockefeller was an American song.

1954
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,000
But it's actually a Eurovision song.

1955
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,740
And I don't think it even won Eurovision.

1956
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,100
And the only reason why it's popular is because of Nightcore.

1957
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,400
It's only popular because of Nightcore.

1958
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:54,420
I don't know, I was thinking about Rockefeller as in the Rockefeller Street.

1959
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,480
You know, the Rockefeller building in New York City.

1960
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,600
Yeah, it was Estonia.

1961
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,620
It was from fucking Estonia!

1962
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,140
That was like the country I least expected Rockefeller to be from.

1963
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,840
Because all I could think about is the Rockefeller building.

1964
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,500
The Rockefeller building in New York City.

1965
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:20,800
She was second to last in Eurovision?

1966
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,740
Oh my god, Rockefeller was second to last?

1967
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,220
To be fair, that song...

1968
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:32,400
That song is like the most popular song during that year too.

1969
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,100
I didn't know that.

1970
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,960
I thought it would be at least popular than that.

1971
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,720
Like who the fuck won Eurovision during that time?

1972
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,020
To be fair...

1973
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,380
Alright, I think everybody knows Eurovision is sort of like...

1974
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,240
It's not really about the song to be fair.

1975
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,220
Eurovision has never really been about the song.

1976
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,220
The quality of the song.

1977
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,300
It's about...

1978
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,660
It's about...

1979
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,700
It's about knowing which country is your ally.

1980
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,500
Like...

1981
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,320
Yo master's the only one that knows your country.

1982
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,460
Dude, that's really it.

1983
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,760
It's like, I'm friends with that country, I don't care how shitty this song is, but you're my friend.

1984
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,420
It's just like, it's just a show you guys who's friends with who.

1985
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,040
Oh, I'm missing strategy talks?

1986
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,040
Oh shit!

1987
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,420
I was jumping around!

1988
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,080
Wait, where is Goomy's...

1989
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,700
Okay, Mew4Me is not a strategy talk.

1990
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,720
That's all I'm saying, guys.

1991
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,080
I don't know...

1992
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,780
We're out of the basement, guys.

1993
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:10,400
The House of Nightmares, and now there are 100 of you left.

1994
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,680
The next challenge is one of The Conjurer's favorite nightmares.

1995
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,240
You will soon find yourself on a movie set.

1996
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:20,780
What?

1997
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:30,280
The houses, the furniture, and even the cows on the farm are all part of a fake set, which The Conjurer oversees personally.

1998
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,580
You will be given basic instructions...

1999
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,600
This is not a puzzle.

2000
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,960
It looks like baking cakes and brewing simple potions.

2001
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,620
Guys, this is not a puzzle.

2002
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,400
Quite everyone has completed the challenge.

2003
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:49,640
The curse will be cast upon the last person to successfully finish the previous challenge.

2004
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:57,100
In this challenge, your goal is to avoid being infected by The Conjurer...

2005
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,000
The puzzle, bake a cake?

2006
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,680
...for the duration of the two-minute timer.

2007
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:05,080
You can pass the curse to other players by tagging them.

2008
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:14,660
If you are infected when the timer hits zero, your soul will forever belong to us.

2009
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:20,480
The last set of players to complete each task will be eliminated.

2010
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,760
Oh god, that's gonna be me, guys.

2011
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,900
That's gonna be me!

2012
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,000
Task one.

2013
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:27,400
The last player will be eliminated.

2014
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,300
That's gonna be me!

2015
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,260
Task two.

2016
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,320
The last player will be eliminated.

2017
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,620
Oh god, this is gonna be me.

2018
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,700
Task three.

2019
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,140
The last two players will be eliminated.

2020
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:37,200
Goodbye, guys.

2021
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,520
We had a good run.

2022
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,560
Task four.

2023
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,180
The last three players will be eliminated.

2024
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,020
That's gonna be me!

2025
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,800
What the fuck?

2026
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:50,700
Yeah, the...

2027
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,280
Goodbye, everybody.

2028
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,840
Goodbye, everybody.

2029
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,860
That's a lot of people.

2030
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,920
What happened from, like, ten to, like, fucking two hundred?

2031
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:06,600
Today.

2032
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,080
So.

2033
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,960
Do as the conjurer says.

2034
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,800
And do it fast.

2035
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,160
Or your soul shall join the house of nightmares for eternity.

2036
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:17,860
Yeah, this is...

2037
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:18,760
We had a good run.

2038
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,040
You know what?

2039
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,800
We had such a good run.

2040
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,820
We had such a good run.

2041
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,380
We had such a good run.

2042
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:28,660
We had such a good run.

2043
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:28,840
We had such a good run.

2044
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,980
That run...

2045
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,840
I mean, we made it this far.

2046
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,120
Nobody expected me to be...

2047
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,520
To last round three.

2048
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:39,540
Guys.

2049
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,160
Nobody expected it.

2050
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,280
Wait, where's my team to strategize?

2051
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:45,600
Oh.

2052
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,720
It did look like there's...

2053
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,200
Well...

2054
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,000
Did it?

2055
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,400
It kinda looks like there's teams, right?

2056
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,520
I'm integrating into...

2057
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:56,820
Okay.

2058
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,180
I don't know.

2059
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,180
I don't know.

2060
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,060
Wait, I actually...

2061
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,700
Yeah, are they gonna divide us randomly?

2062
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,380
I don't think so.

2063
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,300
Or do it like they did yesterday?

2064
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,720
I think everyone's on the same map.

2065
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:04,920
I think everyone's on the same map.

2066
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,360
Yeah.

2067
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,760
It's 15 eliminations from...

2068
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,280
I don't think they know I just got here.

2069
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,420
Five eliminations from the curse.

2070
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,600
So we just need to all be together.

2071
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,120
And, like...

2072
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:11,520
Wait.

2073
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:11,720
Okay.

2074
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,280
Honestly, once you finish a task, I would get...

2075
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,100
I would get away from it and go hide somewhere.

2076
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:15,960
Yes.

2077
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,860
Once you do it, it kinda goes task by task, right?

2078
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,360
You do the task and then someone gets eliminated.

2079
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,680
You do it, then we run.

2080
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,440
I believe so.

2081
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,760
If it is separate groups, I don't think it would be.

2082
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:27,600
I think it will be.

2083
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,360
No, that's too many people.

2084
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,140
It was, like, one, one, two, three, four, four.

2085
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,980
Only eliminate 20 people?

2086
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,460
That's way too many to be split up.

2087
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,260
Because it's, like, 15 per group at that point.

2088
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,420
Well, one in...

2089
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,980
I think it's gonna be one in five for each group gets eliminated.

2090
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,740
So if they do five teams at a time, it means two people will get eliminated.

2091
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,120
Guys, how do I make a cake in Minecraft, guys?

2092
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,260
Guys, how do I make a cake in Minecraft?

2093
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:47,880
Wait.

2094
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:48,880
Wait.

2095
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:49,060
Wait.

2096
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:49,340
Wait.

2097
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:49,820
Wait.

2098
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,040
Wait.

2099
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,340
Wait.

2100
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:50,360
Wait.

2101
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:50,380
Wait.

2102
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:50,960
Wait.

2103
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:51,000
Oh, you're so mean.

2104
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,080
And then, like, half is fixed.

2105
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,240
We're gonna be doing potions, right?

2106
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,080
That's what I mean.

2107
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,340
Oh, sorry.

2108
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,800
That's why I think they're gonna do batches of teams.

2109
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,620
Guys, how do I do it?

2110
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:05,240
Okay, so for potions, all you do is you do nether wart and then you do whatever you need to get the effect that you want.

2111
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,180
I think the recipe will be there, because there's no way they're gonna do it.

2112
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,020
And if I tell you the recipe, they've given us a...

2113
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,580
Guys, how do I make potions?

2114
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,460
Because I've never made a potion before.

2115
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,040
How do you...

2116
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:14,820
Yeah, I was right.

2117
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:22,980
So whoever gets, like, the slowest gets eliminated, and then, like, the next valid person that The person that would be last to finish is gonna get the curse, so you just get out as soon as you're done.

2118
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,800
So you make your teams, and then you compete against your team again?

2119
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,960
I don't think it's a team, I think it's everybody on the same map.

2120
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,200
It's everyone on the same map.

2121
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,380
It's 100% everyone on the same map.

2122
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,100
8 year olds, guys!

2123
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,260
8 year olds, rise up!

2124
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,700
We need you to help me make a cake and improve potions!

2125
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,020
It is a lot, that's really overwhelming.

2126
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:41,780
2 minutes too, that's so long.

2127
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,460
Now's the time to take a shot to eliminate, just go grab the curse.

2128
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,300
I thought you were gonna say take a shot, like alcohol, and I'm like I'll bet.

2129
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:48,440
That's crazy.

2130
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,720
Alexa, how do you make a cake in Minecraft?

2131
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:54,740
So is it better to be with friends, or not with friends?

2132
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,520
What do you think?

2133
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,580
If I somehow get the curse, can you let me tag you so you can chase someone cause I'm not as fast?

2134
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,740
In theory, none of us should be cursed.

2135
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,780
Can I tag you so you can tag him?

2136
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,040
No.

2137
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:05,400
What?

2138
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:08,020
What happened to our package deal?

2139
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,400
Wait, so does everybody play hot potato?

2140
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,520
Yes.

2141
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:17,640
There'll be 1 person out of 100, so you just gotta be lucky.

2142
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:18,280
At that point, you're gonna lose.

2143
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,020
At that point, you just gotta get away from the last people, it seems like.

2144
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:21,680
Just outrun them.

2145
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,380
I don't know if there's a delay in passing it.

2146
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:26,160
I think there's not a delay, so you could also just go to the end and punch.

2147
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,820
In theory, a sweat won't have the potato, and if they do, something terribly wrong happens.

2148
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,120
Yeah, they're gonna wait till the last second and punch someone.

2149
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,380
We should probably walk over to the entrance.

2150
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,840
I mean, is this the entrance over here?

2151
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:39,440
Yeah.

2152
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:40,760
Oh, 2 minutes.

2153
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:41,320
2 minutes.

2154
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,240
I'm scared, guys.

2155
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:48,200
We at the bottom, 1 egg with 2 sugar on each side for the minute.

2156
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,260
And 3...

2157
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:53,000
Guys, okay, the moment we get the cake, I need you guys to spam that.

2158
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,660
I need you guys to spam that.

2159
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,380
So when you have the stuff for the cake, you can just click it.

2160
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,220
No, there's no emote only.

2161
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,780
There's no emote only for today.

2162
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,000
Alright, good luck, guys.

2163
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,220
Good luck, good luck.

2164
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,900
Okay, so you open your inventory and you see where, like, your shield would go, like, your offense.

2165
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,860
So slightly to the right of that, you click, and does it open your crafting menu?

2166
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:16,980
Yeah?

2167
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,860
We have a crafting menu?

2168
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,820
Slightly to the right.

2169
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,580
You'll find it.

2170
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:24,340
Yeah, click, like, a little, like, a little bit to the right of where your offhand is in your inventory.

2171
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,620
How do I...

2172
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:26,120
Slightly to the right.

2173
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,360
How do we open our inventory?

2174
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,400
You see at the top left, there's, like, a, there's, like, a red X, like, next to the thing on the right.

2175
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:31,780
How did he open?

2176
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,620
Oh my god!

2177
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,960
You wanna click that, and so it says, showing craftable with the checkmark.

2178
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:41,560
And then once you get the stuff for a cake, it'll tell you how to, like, it'll, like, literally just, you just click on it and it'll make it for you.

2179
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,680
Yeah, then you can just click it.

2180
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:43,800
We gotta go, guys.

2181
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,680
We need to walk over there.

2182
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,440
Wait, what did he teach them?

2183
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,620
I forgot!

2184
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,200
I forgot what I had, but Minecraft is still dying!

2185
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,480
How can you forget?

2186
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,320
It's been so long!

2187
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:00,180
We didn't...

2188
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:00,860
Where are you?

2189
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,320
I don't know, but people got eliminated.

2190
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,440
A Minecraft player got eliminated on the first day.

2191
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,900
You gotta follow my voice, Fulham?

2192
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,180
No, no, I wanna hear it louder, louder, louder.

2193
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,320
Hello, hello, Fulham.

2194
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,800
Right click on the shield?

2195
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,960
There's nothing on the shield.

2196
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,860
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow Stop meowing, you creeps!

2197
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,580
Stop it!

2198
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,340
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow Meow!

2199
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:23,940
Oh.

2200
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,100
Oh,

2201
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:34,070
God, oh, God.

2202
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,530
Where's my tag?

2203
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,130
Where's my tag?

2204
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:43,950
Find fuel at the fuel power for the generator?

2205
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:55,030
I hope these guys are heading to the generator.

2206
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,780
Wait, did I...

2207
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,760
Near the farmer's house.

2208
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,000
Oh, okay.

2209
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:17,700
I got confused.

2210
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,860
I got confused.

2211
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,140
Everybody was clicking.

2212
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,920
Oh, Eram didn't bring...

2213
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,280
Run,

2214
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:43,110
run, run.

2215
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,150
Oh, I ran.

2216
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:50,880
Confused.

2217
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,020
Everything was so confusing.

2218
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,420
Oh my god.

2219
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:03,720
We gotta run, we gotta hide.

2220
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,600
Run, run.

2221
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,520
Oh my god, people are trying to camouflage.

2222
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:17,120
I like how people are trying to camouflage right now.

2223
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,960
Oh my god, there's still like three people that have it.

2224
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,680
What the fuck?

2225
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,520
The fuck is that?

2226
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,380
Okay.

2227
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,000
Alright.

2228
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,920
How is there still like three people that haven't done...

2229
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:41,700
There's still like three people that haven't done the thing.

2230
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,120
Yeah!

2231
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,000
I like this spot.

2232
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:46,860
Yeah!

2233
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,400
There's no way they can't parkour this.

2234
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:50,840
Oh wait, hold on.

2235
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:51,360
Up there.

2236
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,280
Hold on.

2237
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,480
Ooh.

2238
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,780
Yeah, wait a minute.

2239
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:56,960
Yo, yeah, shift back here for the tag section.

2240
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:57,940
Look out, look out, look out, look out, look out.

2241
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:59,040
They won't find us, really.

2242
01:26:59,160 --> 01:26:59,320
They won't find us, really.

2243
01:26:59,320 --> 01:26:59,840
They won't find us, really.

2244
01:26:59,840 --> 01:26:59,920
Wait.

2245
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,360
We're fine, we're fine, guys.

2246
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,180
We're fine, we're fine.

2247
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:02,540
Oh, wait.

2248
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:03,220
No.

2249
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,160
No, I wanted to...

2250
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,140
It's a bit of alarming that Feinberg and Prefire left.

2251
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,760
Oh, who is it?

2252
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,940
Oh, someone got eliminated.

2253
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,480
And tied until the next one begins.

2254
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:16,820
Aspic.

2255
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:17,500
No way.

2256
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,000
This is such a good hiding spot, guys.

2257
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,340
This is such a good hiding spot.

2258
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:19,980
Good job.

2259
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,360
Oh, I see them over there.

2260
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:21,600
They're hiding.

2261
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,140
Whoa.

2262
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:22,980
Whoa.

2263
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,020
What the fuck?

2264
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:25,860
La TNT.

2265
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:27,280
Oh, no.

2266
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,220
Oh, what?

2267
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,100
Oh.

2268
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,440
Run!

2269
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,600
Oh, God.

2270
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,720
Where are we running?

2271
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,440
They're over there.

2272
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,240
They're behind us.

2273
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:35,500
Run!

2274
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,780
Okay, there's a...

2275
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,760
I don't know where she is.

2276
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:40,400
I'm scared.

2277
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,340
I'm so scared.

2278
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:43,920
I don't know where she is.

2279
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,880
I don't know where they are.

2280
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:45,900
I hope she die.

2281
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,360
Yo, guys.

2282
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,700
I think she is like directly behind us.

2283
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:49,960
Are they behind me?

2284
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,260
Are they behind me?

2285
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:51,820
I can't tell.

2286
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,360
I'm so scared.

2287
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,400
I'm so scared.

2288
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:53,840
I'm so scared.

2289
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:54,460
They're behind me.

2290
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,280
I'm just going to keep running because I don't know.

2291
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,760
There's no upstairs?

2292
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:00,600
No.

2293
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,260
No way I'm here.

2294
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:01,800
No way I'm staying here.

2295
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:01,820
Wait.

2296
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,100
Can we see the motherfucker through walls?

2297
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:03,780
Yeah, yeah.

2298
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,340
We'll see them.

2299
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:04,700
We'll see them through walls.

2300
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:05,800
It's not.

2301
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,180
Everybody's silent.

2302
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:06,560
Everybody's silent.

2303
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:06,940
Wait.

2304
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,480
Do we see them?

2305
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,320
I'm scared.

2306
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,280
I haven't seen them at all.

2307
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:09,740
Where are they?

2308
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,080
Where are they?

2309
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,000
Can't.

2310
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:14,420
I can't.

2311
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:14,740
I can't.

2312
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:15,340
Wait.

2313
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,080
Do the motherfuckers with COVID fast enough?

2314
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:17,940
No.

2315
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:18,600
No.

2316
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:18,680
No.

2317
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:18,740
No.

2318
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:18,800
No.

2319
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:20,900
Brad, you're cracked.

2320
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,720
I'm cracked.

2321
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,180
Well, yeah.

2322
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,680
You're awesome.

2323
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,040
I am very much cracked.

2324
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,100
Probably shouldn't hide in the house.

2325
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,380
Shh.

2326
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:28,880
Shh.

2327
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,480
Everybody's in the house.

2328
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,280
They're all in the house.

2329
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,000
Come in the house.

2330
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,040
Are we outlying?

2331
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:34,280
You little bitch.

2332
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,800
Cory Wayne.

2333
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:37,700
Cory Wayne.

2334
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,500
What are you doing, bro?

2335
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:39,420
Come up.

2336
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:39,800
Come up.

2337
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:39,960
Come.

2338
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,930
I think we can see them through the walls.

2339
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:49,330
Is it like an outline or what kind of glow is it?

2340
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,530
Yeah, it's an outline.

2341
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,450
Why don't we see it?

2342
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:55,390
I hear a heartbeat.

2343
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:56,470
Does everybody hear that?

2344
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:57,590
Yeah, it's getting like a bustle.

2345
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,010
Ah, there's ladders.

2346
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:05,980
I'm scared.

2347
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,020
Guys, I'm scared.

2348
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:12,300
How?

2349
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,140
How do you get up there?

2350
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:14,640
Back, back, back.

2351
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,720
Guys, I'm scared.

2352
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:17,780
I'm so scared.

2353
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,100
Thank God I speak Spanish.

2354
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:20,560
Come, come, come here.

2355
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,520
They're saying they're coming.

2356
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,760
Hide, hide, hide.

2357
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:23,380
Are you serious?

2358
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:24,340
Maptor!

2359
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:33,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2360
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,180
Collect water from the crate near the water well.

2361
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:36,860
Collect the water well.

2362
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,460
Where's the water well?

2363
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,060
Yeah, where is the water well?

2364
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,320
I don't know.

2365
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,060
Where's the water well, Reggie?

2366
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,100
Oh no.

2367
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,200
There's water bottles inside the house, inside of the fridge.

2368
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,200
Inside the fridge.

2369
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,140
I don't trust you, man.

2370
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,800
In the farm, in the farm, in the farm.

2371
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:53,000
I'm going to keep it real with you.

2372
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,380
I'm going to keep it $1.50.

2373
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,160
I do not trust you.

2374
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,620
Wait, it's in the house, guys.

2375
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,060
Go get it.

2376
01:29:58,900 --> 01:29:59,580
Collect sugar.

2377
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,020
Wait, actually, where is it?

2378
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:00,780
Oh, this is the water.

2379
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:06,310
Where is it?

2380
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:07,290
I'm so scared.

2381
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:08,490
I don't know.

2382
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,610
Is that a sugar cane over there?

2383
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:12,990
Oh my God, please tell me that it is.

2384
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:14,950
What if the sugar is coming from like a...

2385
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:16,550
Please tell me that it is.

2386
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:17,990
I'm just following the crowd.

2387
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,630
Where's the water bottle?

2388
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:19,290
See?

2389
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,210
Oh, I got it.

2390
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:21,690
You can just grab it.

2391
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:22,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2392
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,210
Where's the nether wart farm?

2393
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:24,250
Where's the nether wart farm?

2394
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:24,830
Where's the nether wart?

2395
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:26,090
Where's the nether wart?

2396
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,790
Oh, I see.

2397
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:27,390
I see the nether wart.

2398
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:27,970
Yeah, where's the nether wart?

2399
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,390
Where's the nether wart?

2400
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:29,830
Oh, yeah, that's this way.

2401
01:30:29,950 --> 01:30:30,330
Where are we going?

2402
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:30,950
How do we get it?

2403
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,630
Left hand.

2404
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,010
The nether wart's this way?

2405
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,230
Okay.

2406
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:34,330
It's by the fuel tower.

2407
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,370
Oh, it's over there.

2408
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:36,590
How do I grab the sugar?

2409
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,250
Don't go in here.

2410
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,420
Oh, the nether wart followed the crowd.

2411
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,660
You guys, where's nether wart?

2412
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:49,340
Oh, they were right there.

2413
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:49,600
There it is.

2414
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:49,940
There it is.

2415
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:50,140
Where's nether wart?

2416
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:51,200
In the house.

2417
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:51,740
Go to the house.

2418
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:52,940
Where'd you guys get the water?

2419
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:53,800
Oh, I'm so screwed.

2420
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,760
Where'd you get the water?

2421
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,200
Please?

2422
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:57,020
Yay!

2423
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,720
Wait, where's the water?

2424
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:00,840
From the cabinet.

2425
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:01,660
I'm just going to follow.

2426
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,320
I'm just going to follow.

2427
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,420
I'm just going to follow.

2428
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,760
Do you have the water?

2429
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,460
I'm going to follow.

2430
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,080
Yeah, I'm going to follow.

2431
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,240
Are you going to the powder?

2432
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:12,620
Yes, I am going to the powder.

2433
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,120
Okay.

2434
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,560
Okay, I follow you.

2435
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,400
There's a giant door that leads to the middle of it.

2436
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,460
I don't know where the water is.

2437
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,180
Where's the water?

2438
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,580
Oh, where's Clutch?

2439
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,340
He doesn't know where the water is.

2440
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:19,760
I don't have water.

2441
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,080
Yeah, where's the cabinet?

2442
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,020
Over here.

2443
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,040
Oh.

2444
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,180
Gumi, where are you?

2445
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,120
Guys, where's the cabinet?

2446
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:31,460
Guys.

2447
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:31,740
I don't know.

2448
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,120
Chicken coop.

2449
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:32,620
Where's the water?

2450
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:33,560
To go there.

2451
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:33,840
Who?

2452
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,720
An awkward potion?

2453
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:35,140
Go to the barn.

2454
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:35,580
The barn.

2455
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:36,140
Chicken coop.

2456
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:36,520
Chicken coop.

2457
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,040
Oh, I didn't know it said that.

2458
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,660
Wait, was that a chicken coop over there?

2459
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:40,160
Yeah.

2460
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,480
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the barn is a chicken coop.

2461
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,800
Gumi, are you going to brood the chicken coop?

2462
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:48,980
Chicken coop.

2463
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:49,180
Chicken coop.

2464
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:49,200
Chicken coop.

2465
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:49,320
Chicken coop.

2466
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:49,340
Chicken coop.

2467
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:49,680
Inside of The Barn.

2468
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,420
Ready to break in the barn?

2469
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:51,760
Right there.

2470
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,480
Where's the chicken coop?

2471
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,240
Where's the chicken?

2472
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,220
Is it in the house?

2473
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,100
Yeah, I think it's in the house, right?

2474
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,620
Is it in the house?

2475
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:03,100
Where's the chicken coop?

2476
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,340
Where's the water?

2477
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,040
Where's the water?

2478
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,540
I don't know where the chicken coop is.

2479
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,040
There's something swarming up there.

2480
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,220
I don't know how to get the water.

2481
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,860
Where's the chicken coop?

2482
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,700
I don't know about the chicken coop.

2483
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:24,900
Guys, where is the chicken coop?

2484
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,800
Is that it?

2485
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,420
Is that it?

2486
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,140
That's the chicken coop!

2487
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:33,080
That's where everybody is!

2488
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:34,380
That's where all the chickens are!

2489
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:35,900
Sugar first!

2490
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:36,540
Sugar first!

2491
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,420
Sugar first!

2492
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,360
No, no, no, sugar first.

2493
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,560
How do I, how do I prove it?

2494
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:43,600
Sugar first!

2495
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,820
Sugar first!

2496
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,180
Sugar first!

2497
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:46,480
Sugar first!

2498
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,180
Sugar first!

2499
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,440
Do not put sugar first!

2500
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,760
Guys, wait, what?

2501
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,060
Really?

2502
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,220
Yeah.

2503
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,200
Where's the conjurer?

2504
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:54,660
Sugar is first.

2505
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,980
What the fuck is a conjurer?

2506
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:57,280
What?

2507
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,040
Lace, top, left?

2508
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,600
Hey, man, get a uno!

2509
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:05,900
And then what?

2510
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,820
And then I put sugar?

2511
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,940
What happens after the sweet punch?

2512
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,100
Go to the conjurer.

2513
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:14,660
Where's that?

2514
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:15,740
Wait, fire.

2515
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,140
lived Like a juicio de agua.

2516
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,960
And then I put sugar?

2517
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,860
And then I put sugar?

2518
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:23,760
Oh, juicio de agua?

2519
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,720
No la negruar, no.

2520
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,720
Get her mind writing.

2521
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,640
Get her mind writing.

2522
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:32,060
No.

2523
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,540
More a la negruar.

2524
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,880
No, no, no only for the mug meat.

2525
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,660
Oh, put it...

2526
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:45,020
This is why we put sugar?

2527
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:47,320
Okay, we have to get another bottle of water, Flex, right?

2528
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:48,960
No, no, no, I already have a bottle.

2529
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:49,780
Oh, God.

2530
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,360
Is that big?

2531
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,420
Where's the counter?

2532
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:53,800
This big guy right here?

2533
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,680
False, it's the big guy.

2534
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,100
It's the big guy.

2535
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:55,800
To the left.

2536
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,040
Big guy to the left.

2537
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:57,740
Thank you, thank you.

2538
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:58,220
Okay.

2539
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,760
Hi, big guy.

2540
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:01,060
Hi.

2541
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:01,600
Yes!

2542
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:03,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2543
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:04,800
Yay!

2544
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:06,500
Yay!

2545
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,460
I lived!

2546
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:09,160
Ideal.

2547
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,520
Oh, my God.

2548
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,880
It was so stressful.

2549
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:12,680
From left to right.

2550
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,220
From left to right.

2551
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:14,460
From left to right.

2552
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,080
I think we're going to save by...

2553
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,520
Oh.

2554
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:17,800
It's fine.

2555
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:21,640
When we were getting Leatherwort, someone was getting water, so we're fine.

2556
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:23,200
Wait, where's milk?

2557
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,740
Do we have to go to the cows and milk today?

2558
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:29,940
Oh, that was so stressful.

2559
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:32,020
There's going to be Jake next to...

2560
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,220
I see a cow right there.

2561
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,000
Yeah, there's a cow over there.

2562
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,080
There's another one with milk there.

2563
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,000
Sonic, come here!

2564
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:41,540
Guys, I feel like I'm going to die from the curse.

2565
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,100
I think I'm going to die from the curse.

2566
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:44,440
I want to see.

2567
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,020
I'm scared.

2568
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:49,340
I'm so scared.

2569
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,340
And then eggs over there, and then sugar over there.

2570
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:55,020
Eggs over there, sugar there, wheat there, milk there.

2571
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:55,800
Where's the cow?

2572
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:57,420
It's in the farm.

2573
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,460
Oh, I see it.

2574
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:58,720
Yeah.

2575
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:02,920
Maybe we should stand right next to him while everyone's getting their stuff, no?

2576
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,700
Well, I feel like we should like...

2577
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:08,560
Well, nonetheless, standing here is good.

2578
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2579
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,840
This is where everything is.

2580
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,280
Every mob that's around is there for a reason.

2581
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,580
So I kind of want to just take care of them.

2582
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,660
Like, what is that right there?

2583
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:16,440
Your objective.

2584
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,900
Is that a cow?

2585
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,700
Yeah, there's a cow over there.

2586
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:21,700
Is that a sheep?

2587
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:22,640
No, that's a sheep.

2588
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:23,760
It looks like a sheep.

2589
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:24,580
Where's the wheat?

2590
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,940
How do we get into the wheat?

2591
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:27,660
There's a door over there.

2592
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:29,560
There's a door over there.

2593
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,420
Yeah, there's an entrance over here.

2594
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,240
Yeah?

2595
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,100
Yeah, let's look at it together.

2596
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,360
Yeah, let's look at the entrances.

2597
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,480
This one over here looks like it's going to be...

2598
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,480
An archery test.

2599
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:45,840
FPS.

2600
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:46,540
Yeah.

2601
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:48,820
I think it's going to be good if we like...

2602
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,580
Oh, this is bad.

2603
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,200
I don't know how to do archery in Minecraft.

2604
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,660
Just imagine triple take.

2605
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:55,960
There's a bullet drop off.

2606
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,280
Okay.

2607
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:57,760
Follow, follow, follow.

2608
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,300
Bro, are you just...

2609
01:35:59,300 --> 01:35:59,720
Wait, wait, wait.

2610
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,080
I'm high rolling by the...

2611
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,580
I'm high rolling standing by the chest over there.

2612
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,980
This is the cow.

2613
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,300
We got to get the wheat.

2614
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,400
Wait, that's not a real cow.

2615
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:07,940
It's a human.

2616
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,160
I feel like you just...

2617
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:09,760
Yeah, I just want to...

2618
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,800
I just want to know where it is though.

2619
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,380
Like I want to know...

2620
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,320
No, look at his face.

2621
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:13,580
That's not a real cow.

2622
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,480
That can't be a cow.

2623
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:16,580
I don't know.

2624
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,620
Yeah, but he could be like a costume.

2625
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,180
Wait.

2626
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:23,680
Dude, you can get on the walls just like...

2627
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,600
Wait, these are all freaks.

2628
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,640
There's no way.

2629
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:26,480
There's like a head.

2630
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,420
There's no way that's a cow.

2631
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,320
It looks like a human cow.

2632
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:34,700
It looks like some homunculus shit.

2633
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:37,380
Wait, that's a cow.

2634
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,740
It's a sheep also like that?

2635
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,520
Hey, don't judge.

2636
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,080
What the fuck?

2637
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:46,520
They all have those eyes.

2638
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,400
Those creepy eyes.

2639
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,800
The man cow bear.

2640
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,620
They all have those eyes.

2641
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,760
What the fuck is wrong with her?

2642
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,460
What is wrong...

2643
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:01,740
They all look like they have PTSD.

2644
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:03,980
No, it's better.

2645
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,220
They all have...

2646
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:07,160
They all look like they have PTSD.

2647
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,500
They all look like they have PTSD or some shit.

2648
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,400
Oh, come on up.

2649
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:10,900
Insane.

2650
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,080
What?

2651
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:13,600
Little cheats again.

2652
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,680
We got a parkour legend here.

2653
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:16,240
How do we even get up there?

2654
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,220
Oh my god.

2655
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,540
Like, they just look like they are traumatized about something.

2656
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:25,160
They like...

2657
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:25,900
They've seen things.

2658
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,240
See?

2659
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,540
Yeah.

2660
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:27,960
Yeah.

2661
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:29,980
We just ran off.

2662
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:31,380
Don't put sugar free.

2663
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:35,620
Oh my god.

2664
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,100
I feel like some people got fucked over.

2665
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:37,140
Oh my god.

2666
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,980
I feel like some people got fucked over because they put sugar first.

2667
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,220
Holy shit.

2668
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,480
God, I'm nervous.

2669
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:47,820
Being alive.

2670
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:48,900
I don't know.

2671
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,640
I don't know if it's good to be, like...

2672
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:54,120
like to live past this right now for the objective.

2673
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,600
cause, like, I'm getting more stressed the more...

2674
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:01,580
the more tasks we get, I'm getting more stressed out.

2675
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,120
If I was limited to one, I would...

2676
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,720
I could be chillin' right now.

2677
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:15,360
Holy shit, I'm so... like I'm actually so scared.

2678
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,580
That's okay, we're gonna be transported when the curse starts.

2679
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,760
When the curse starts, we're gonna be transported so it doesn't matter.

2680
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,540
Oh, there's like cows here too.

2681
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,160
We're gonna have to find the bucket.

2682
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:42,280
You know damn well that 70k is going to a fucking Minecrafter, guys.

2683
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,280
You know that, chat.

2684
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,700
There's no way a regular person is gonna get that 70k.

2685
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,100
Minecrafters have been playing Minecraft games for years.

2686
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:57,860
It's been 20... it's been almost 20 years since Minecraft came out.

2687
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:03,560
Some of these Minecraft streamers have been streaming Minecraft since like it came out, guys.

2688
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,020
Loser talk.

2689
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:06,960
Yeah, sure.

2690
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,380
Surefour, why aren't you in here?

2691
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,860
That was 70k.

2692
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,360
That could've been an easy 70k for you, Surefour.

2693
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,760
Why aren't you here?

2694
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,600
A hundred and fifty people?

2695
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,340
Guys, oof.

2696
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,360
That's an oof-er.

2697
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,900
Right there, Surefour.

2698
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,100
I can't believe it.

2699
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,180
They asked SK.

2700
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,860
And they didn't ask you?

2701
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,300
Sleepy and Warren were...

2702
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:37,100
Sleepy, Warren, and Menda were here.

2703
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:37,440
Man.

2704
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,860
Is it like... no, it's individual.

2705
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,520
It's like an individual shit.

2706
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,060
It's okay.

2707
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:48,000
Sleepy, Warren... all the Overwatch players got eliminated, by the way, though.

2708
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:48,940
Oh, yeah.

2709
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:54,060
Every Overwatch player that got in got eliminated, man.

2710
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,960
You could've been the one that lived.

2711
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,700
You could've been the last remaining Overwatch player.

2712
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,320
Oh, no.

2713
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:06,360
How awful.

2714
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:08,600
That could've been you.

2715
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:11,540
Oh, yeah.

2716
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:11,900
We should...

2717
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,100
We should be in the middle.

2718
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:13,380
Oh, yeah.

2719
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,040
We gotta be in the middle.

2720
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,880
We're gonna teleport out soon.

2721
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,500
I forgot about that.

2722
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,360
That's why you guys wanted me to be out of the fields.

2723
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:21,400
Oh, my God.

2724
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,360
E-Rob was 96?

2725
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,040
Yeah, I need...

2726
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:25,880
Yeah, I forgot.

2727
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,120
I need to be all the way over there.

2728
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,400
Oh, this is scary.

2729
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:28,700
Please.

2730
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:29,520
Please, 97.

2731
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:30,260
Give me a...

2732
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:32,460
Give me a sec to join the...

2733
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:33,380
the crowd.

2734
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:36,540
Let me...

2735
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,400
Guys, I'm lost.

2736
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:37,700
No!

2737
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:41,680
Oh, no!

2738
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,240
I'm fucked!

2739
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:43,540
Guys!

2740
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,380
I fucked myself over.

2741
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:48,400
No!

2742
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:49,140
No!

2743
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:49,900
No!

2744
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:50,920
I fucked myself over!

2745
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,760
I'm not with the crowd!

2746
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,520
Guys, I don't know how to get out of here!

2747
01:40:59,120 --> 01:40:59,760
Oh, no.

2748
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,140
Oh, no, guys.

2749
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:02,940
Oh, there's the crowd.

2750
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,280
There's the crowd.

2751
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:03,860
Oh, man.

2752
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:05,260
Oh, yeah.

2753
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:05,700
I got it.

2754
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,220
I got it.

2755
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:06,480
I got it.

2756
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:07,680
Oh, no!

2757
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,280
Oh, God.

2758
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,080
Cause he's behind us.

2759
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:10,620
Oh, I see him.

2760
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:10,980
I see him.

2761
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,240
I'm going this way.

2762
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:12,660
I'm going this way.

2763
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,080
I see them.

2764
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:14,160
I see them.

2765
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:14,620
I see them.

2766
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,240
I'm going this way.

2767
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:16,860
I'm following these guys.

2768
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,620
It's so over.

2769
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,060
I didn't know where I was.

2770
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:20,600
Oh, my God.

2771
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,300
Gun shift.

2772
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:24,720
Gun shift.

2773
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:25,500
Gun shift.

2774
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:26,760
Shift and...

2775
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:28,180
Bro, don't shift.

2776
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,520
Don't shift.

2777
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:29,860
Don't shift.

2778
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:30,380
Your arm is sticking out.

2779
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:30,760
Your arm is sticking out.

2780
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,060
Don't shift.

2781
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:31,520
Based on what?

2782
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:31,860
Based on what?

2783
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:32,080
Don't shift.

2784
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:32,820
Your arm is sticking out.

2785
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:33,280
Don't shift!

2786
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:33,720
What?

2787
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,400
Punch forward.

2788
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:34,900
Punch.

2789
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,200
Punch to not stick up.

2790
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:37,520
Just punch.

2791
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,480
Just punch in front.

2792
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:38,480
Just punch.

2793
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:38,780
Just punch in front.

2794
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,380
To not stick up.

2795
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:40,780
All right.

2796
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,280
Can we still see them glowing?

2797
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,180
This is an insane spot, bro.

2798
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,640
Yeah.

2799
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,540
It's going to be so busted next time, bro.

2800
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,220
Get that chicken head out of there.

2801
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,220
Get that chicken head out of there.

2802
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:49,860
Move your heads.

2803
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,140
Move your heads.

2804
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:51,740
Oh, it's coming!

2805
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,000
I'm joking.

2806
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,220
I'm joking.

2807
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,240
Why do you guys think this is funny?

2808
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,220
I don't wanna say that, bro.

2809
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:58,860
Shh.

2810
01:41:59,120 --> 01:41:59,320
Shh.

2811
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:01,620
Shh.

2812
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:02,380
Shh.

2813
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:03,160
Shh.

2814
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:03,600
Shh.

2815
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:03,960
Shh.

2816
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:04,520
Shh.

2817
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:04,780
Shh.

2818
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:04,800
Shh.

2819
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:04,980
Shh.

2820
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,040
Shh.

2821
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:06,380
Shh.

2822
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:08,900
Shift?

2823
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,000
And they're like, don't shift?

2824
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:10,760
And I was like, oh, shift!

2825
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,360
Don't move, don't move!

2826
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,420
No, no, no, no.

2827
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,460
Don't move.

2828
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:26,900
Don't worry, the Spanish Minecrafters know what they're doing!

2829
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,800
The Spanish Minecrafters know what they're doing!

2830
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:33,940
No, no, no, no.

2831
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,500
Of course they do!

2832
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,020
My crafter's very popular over there!

2833
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:40,600
Look at Quackity!

2834
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,080
Freddy, come with us, Freddy.

2835
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,920
The fucking head!

2836
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,800
The fucking head!

2837
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:50,880
Come with us, Freddy.

2838
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,060
Freddy Pusper.

2839
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,280
Oh, he's behind you!

2840
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,880
Oh, he's right behind me, isn't he?

2841
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:59,020
Nice.

2842
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,120
Nice.

2843
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,680
Oh, he did it.

2844
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,480
Oh, he did it.

2845
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:09,920
Oh, god.

2846
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:14,500
Find a note at the farmer's house.

2847
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2848
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:18,060
Where are we?

2849
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,580
Gumi, where's the farm?

2850
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:19,820
Gumi!

2851
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:22,300
Gumi!

2852
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:27,080
Gumi, I'm right behind you!

2853
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,400
Gumi's not slowing down, guys!

2854
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:30,900
Gumi!

2855
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:31,640
Gumi's not slowing down, guys!

2856
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:32,800
No, it's because of the language.

2857
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:33,800
They get it.

2858
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,480
Because Gumi's not slowing down.

2859
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,180
They're not slowing down for me!

2860
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,880
Wrong house!

2861
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:41,740
Wrong house!

2862
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,540
Dude, I got so bad spawn.

2863
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,020
That was such a bad spawn.

2864
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,600
Go to the fuel tower, go to the fuel tower.

2865
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,600
Wait, is it the right house?

2866
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,880
Fuel tower, they sent fuel.

2867
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:53,860
Is that not the right house?

2868
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,120
Sophie?

2869
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:56,780
Yeah, they're trolling.

2870
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,720
Wait, it's the right house?

2871
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:01,960
Aw, Doki run!

2872
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,880
I'm running, I didn't know!

2873
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,200
They were trapping me!

2874
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:05,840
You can't run.

2875
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,300
Is he in the house?

2876
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,140
Oh my god, we were just at the bottom.

2877
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:12,640
That's so cool.

2878
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,080
Wait, where is it?

2879
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,540
I don't know.

2880
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,000
Desk?

2881
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:21,380
Desk?

2882
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:22,260
Desk?

2883
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:22,960
Over here?

2884
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:24,980
Wait, where's the desk?

2885
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:25,280
Right here!

2886
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:25,540
Right here!

2887
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:25,960
Right here!

2888
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,320
Wait, where is it?

2889
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,040
Oh, I got it!

2890
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:29,520
I got it!

2891
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,520
I got it!

2892
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:34,440
Oh my god!

2893
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,680
We got trolled so... We got trolled so hard, Gumi!

2894
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,820
Oh, this is bad.

2895
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,840
We got trolled.

2896
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:48,920
Alright, back to it.

2897
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,420
I've seen the chest.

2898
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,060
I've seen the chest.

2899
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:55,140
I'm just gonna follow Gumi.

2900
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,260
Oh no, we have to... We saw it too!

2901
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,040
Oh my god, this is so nerve-wracking!

2902
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,380
Literally one guy!

2903
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,620
I got so confused!

2904
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,160
That's so fucked up.

2905
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,380
It's so fucked up.

2906
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:16,900
Alright, we're going upstairs.

2907
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,180
Where's the chest?

2908
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:18,560
Where's the chest?

2909
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:18,860
Where's the chest?

2910
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,300
It's upstairs.

2911
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,480
Yeah, there's a pile of books upstairs.

2912
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:25,620
Hey, it's really hard to speak Spanish so they don't understand.

2913
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:28,700
Where's the chest?

2914
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:29,380
Where's the chest?

2915
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,000
Oh wait, no, it's this chest.

2916
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:31,520
It's this chest.

2917
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,040
It's behind me.

2918
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:32,760
And where do I take the note?

2919
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,520
I followed Gumi!

2920
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,720
I followed Gumi!

2921
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:36,560
I got confused!

2922
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,020
Yes!

2923
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,040
Never follow Gumi!

2924
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,900
Use the note to find a chest.

2925
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,960
Try 1993.

2926
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:53,400
Oh, is it the number on your file?

2927
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:57,060
1... 1... 93...

2928
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,120
Wait, I'm not in?

2929
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,140
Where do I take it?

2930
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,080
Find the note right here.

2931
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,300
Right there.

2932
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,000
1993.

2933
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,460
The code is 1993.

2934
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:08,780
Click on it.

2935
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:09,140
1993.

2936
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:11,580
Alright, Gia, the books are at the top of the barn, okay, Gia?

2937
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,240
Oh god.

2938
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:12,600
Oh god.

2939
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:13,120
Oh god.

2940
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,300
The chest is behind the barn.

2941
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,500
Oh god.

2942
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:17,700
Oh, I got panicked, guys!

2943
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:18,800
I panicked!

2944
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,140
I panicked, everybody!

2945
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,060
I couldn't read because I was panicking!

2946
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,520
Did you get the note?

2947
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,280
Did you get the note?

2948
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,760
Did you get the note up there?

2949
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:31,140
No, it's me.

2950
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,440
Did you get the note?

2951
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:33,340
Run, run, run!

2952
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:34,600
Come on!

2953
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:36,240
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2954
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,740
Find a note near the pile of books.

2955
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,560
Oh my god.

2956
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:39,840
Where's the note?

2957
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,580
Where's the note?

2958
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:42,420
Where's the note?

2959
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:42,560
Book?

2960
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:44,200
Oh, thanks.

2961
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:45,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2962
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,500
Is that it?

2963
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,020
We're good?

2964
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:48,340
Up here?

2965
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,380
I don't know where to go.

2966
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,160
Up here?

2967
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:51,780
There's gonna be...

2968
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,240
I'm gonna come over here.

2969
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,640
Books right here?

2970
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:56,700
Do we have to fight right now?

2971
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:57,600
Yeah!

2972
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:58,060
Nice.

2973
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,040
Nice, Ross!

2974
01:46:59,040 --> 01:46:59,540
Where's the book?

2975
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,320
Where's the book?

2976
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:06,200
I'm so stressed out!

2977
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:08,920
I'm so stressed out!

2978
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:10,960
Holy fuck!

2979
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,400
Oh my god.

2980
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,420
So stressful!

2981
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,920
Oh my god!

2982
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:17,480
Use your note!

2983
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,520
I'm clicking it with the note and it's not opening!

2984
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:20,720
Oh my god!

2985
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,180
I'm gonna practice!

2986
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,400
I'm gonna practice!

2987
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:27,060
Yo, you guys wanna do an Autry practice right now?

2988
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:27,720
Oh my god!

2989
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:29,320
Yeah, I'm gonna go shoot.

2990
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:30,880
I'm gonna practice, guys.

2991
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,960
Oh god, there's falloff.

2992
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,560
Which one's my arrow?

2993
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
For the silverfish, right?

2994
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,080
Silverfish is one of the bottom.

2995
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:41,960
Okay.

2996
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:42,220
Okay.

2997
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:42,400
Okay.

2998
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:42,780
Okay.

2999
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:44,100
We got aim high.

3000
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:44,660
Okay.

3001
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:47,180
I don't even know which one's mine.

3002
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,200
Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the middle.

3003
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:49,560
There's no point in winning.

3004
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:50,680
Oh, it's for practice.

3005
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:51,640
I see.

3006
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,000
I wish I was better with the bow.

3007
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:55,620
Okay.

3008
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,180
What are we gonna use the sword for?

3009
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,720
Gumi went the wrong way several times!

3010
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:02,020
I couldn't trust her anymore!

3011
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,060
I couldn't trust her!

3012
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,180
She went the wrong way several times!

3013
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,620
Sonic got 11 points!

3014
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,540
Sorry, Fox got eliminated.

3015
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:12,260
Yeah, you were...

3016
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:12,360
You were...

3017
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:12,500
You were a ghost!

3018
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:13,820
One in each side.

3019
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:16,180
Oh, oh.

3020
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:16,700
These chickens!

3021
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:17,200
Fuck!

3022
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:18,380
Fuck!

3023
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:18,660
Deal!

3024
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,680
Going this way.

3025
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,540
Going to the house.

3026
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,380
I don't know, I'm scared.

3027
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:28,940
Oh god, they're going inside.

3028
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:29,460
I'm going to the house.

3029
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:30,780
They are coming this way.

3030
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,540
Oh god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3031
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:34,280
Which way are they coming over?

3032
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,220
I'm so scared!

3033
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:36,280
No no no no no no no.

3034
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:42,460
Oh no, oh no, oh no, guys, goodbye, everybody!

3035
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,460
Goodbye, everyone!

3036
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:47,100
This might be where we end up!

3037
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:47,440
We die!

3038
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,900
This might be where we die!

3039
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:52,700
Nooooo!

3040
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:54,860
Okay.

3041
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,280
Oh no.

3042
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,260
Oh fucking no.

3043
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,360
Oh no, guys, this is it.

3044
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,760
We actually got hit.

3045
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:09,390
Oh no.

3046
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:11,130
Yes.

3047
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:13,090
This is it, guys.

3048
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:16,390
It was so nice playing with you guys!

3049
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:20,050
We're gonna get eliminated by the curse!

3050
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:24,310
To the gate, to the gate.

3051
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,050
To the gate!

3052
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:25,650
To the gate!

3053
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:26,250
To the gate!

3054
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:27,870
Where am I gonna make it?

3055
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:31,590
Are we gonna make it to the gate?

3056
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:35,370
We might make it.

3057
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,650
We might make it to the gate.

3058
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:42,890
We might make it to the gate.

3059
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,690
We might make it to the gate!

3060
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:47,630
I knew the key!

3061
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:48,270
I was there!

3062
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:49,070
I was there at the key!

3063
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:51,930
I was the key person!

3064
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,250
Stay here, stay here, stay here.

3065
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,510
Get away, get away, get away.

3066
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:04,300
Run,

3067
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,060
run, run.

3068
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,740
Dude, they tried to get me.

3069
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,940
They tried to get me out.

3070
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:32,100
They tried to get me out.

3071
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,460
I knew it was going to start with the bomb.

3072
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,380
I knew it.

3073
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:35,800
I'm behind!

3074
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,640
I'm behind the gate!

3075
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:38,780
The gate!

3076
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,720
Really bad.

3077
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:43,320
Move,

3078
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,000
you fuckers!

3079
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,640
You all need to get out of my way.

3080
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:55,580
I swear to God I'm going to freak out.

3081
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,160
I can't tell how many I killed.

3082
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,740
I can't match my freak.

3083
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,600
Try to quit, try to quit.

3084
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:02,940
Don't spam, try to quit.

3085
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,360
Oh my God, please.

3086
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,280
Give me one.

3087
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:08,500
This...

3088
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,020
Give me one at least.

3089
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,560
Oh my God, how many did I get?

3090
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:18,440
Oh my God, how many did I get?

3091
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:18,820
Free firing.

3092
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,720
Oh my God, how many did I get?

3093
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,040
Oh my God, how many did I get?

3094
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:26,410
Oh no.

3095
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:26,890
It's a joke.

3096
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:29,150
It's a joke, eh?

3097
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:34,230
If you get critical, it's one-shot, so...

3098
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,850
Oh my God.

3099
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:38,550
Oh my God.

3100
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:39,190
How do you flash like that?

3101
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:39,530
Bow them.

3102
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:40,850
Bow them.

3103
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:41,450
Bow them.

3104
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:41,530
Okay.

3105
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:43,630
Jump, get critical, and kill the one.

3106
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,210
And that's it.

3107
01:51:44,210 --> 01:51:44,650
There's no problem.

3108
01:51:45,110 --> 01:51:45,850
I can't.

3109
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:47,110
That's it, but...

3110
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:49,130
Oh no, I can't see.

3111
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:50,830
It's actually sun.

3112
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:53,210
God!

3113
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:06,890
Red, there's a bunch outside the barn.

3114
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:07,870
Red, there's a ton outside.

3115
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:09,530
Oh my God.

3116
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:11,610
Okay, good.

3117
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:17,990
Oh my God, I need one more.

3118
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:19,470
It's on outside.

3119
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:21,530
I need one more too!

3120
01:52:22,350 --> 01:52:23,010
Oh God.

3121
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:24,590
Okay.

3122
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:29,690
This way is faster.

3123
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:31,790
You can jump up from the stairs.

3124
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:33,750
Two way.

3125
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:36,190
And jump from here.

3126
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:38,410
Oh no, no, no.

3127
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:39,090
Where's the Conjure?

3128
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:39,490
Where's the Conjure?

3129
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:40,490
In the middle?

3130
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:41,130
Okay.

3131
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:42,130
How do we get there?

3132
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:44,730
Break around the...

3133
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:54,070
How do you guys get there?

3134
01:52:58,750 --> 01:52:59,190
Oh no.

3135
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:01,350
I was actually in time.

3136
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:03,870
It's either the cake or the target practice.

3137
01:53:04,630 --> 01:53:05,070
Oh.

3138
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:07,110
Oh my God.

3139
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:09,110
Oh, I collided.

3140
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:09,650
Give me the meat!

3141
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:12,930
I'm so stressful.

3142
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:15,350
I hate this game.

3143
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:20,390
Oh my God.

3144
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:24,150
Oh my God.

3145
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:28,910
Oh my God.

3146
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:29,090
Oh my God.

3147
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:29,370
Oh my God.

3148
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:29,970
Oh my God.

3149
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:30,650
Oh my God.

3150
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,890
Oh my God.

3151
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:33,710
Oh my God.

3152
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:37,110
Guys, please.

3153
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:38,750
Just eliminate me.

3154
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:45,090
Guys, I'm gonna be the last 10.

3155
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:46,650
There's no fucking way.

3156
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:48,630
Oh.

3157
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:54,070
This is too much.

3158
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:54,710
My heart.

3159
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:56,470
My fucking heart, man.

3160
01:53:57,990 --> 01:54:00,210
My fucking heart.

3161
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:02,730
My heart.

3162
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:08,570
My fucking heart, man.

3163
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:09,530
I can't.

3164
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:10,930
My hands are shaking.

3165
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:13,410
And I'm so stressed out.

3166
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:15,110
And I want this to be over.

3167
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:19,170
Oh boy.

3168
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:23,110
No, no, no.

3169
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:27,990
I'm just gonna go here.

3170
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:30,850
My heart can't take it.

3171
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:36,910
My heart can't take it, guys.

3172
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:37,270
One.

3173
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:41,310
How many challenges are left, too?

3174
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:45,810
I'm assuming there's two more challenges and then one more ChrisRant, probably.

3175
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:47,830
How many have we done so far?

3176
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:49,770
We've done four ChrisRants.

3177
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:53,010
If someone could hit this double Neo, they're never getting tagged.

3178
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:54,290
No, I don't think you can.

3179
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:55,310
Wait.

3180
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,410
I got it, I got it.

3181
01:54:57,650 --> 01:54:58,970
Wait, that's just so much better, isn't it?

3182
01:54:59,070 --> 01:55:03,050
Jesus Christ, I got infected as the first person.

3183
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:05,670
But he didn't notice I infected him back.

3184
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:06,210
So we're safe.

3185
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:09,150
Oh my god, dude.

3186
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:10,510
I'm like hungry.

3187
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,710
I can't.

3188
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:14,150
I can't.

3189
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:15,730
So smart, so smart.

3190
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:22,650
We're here, we're here!

3191
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:24,710
I know, but you...

3192
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:26,030
Hi!

3193
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:28,050
I know, but you're crazy.

3194
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:31,110
Wait, is there one more...

3195
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:33,370
Hang in there, Toki.

3196
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:34,450
Uh-oh.

3197
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:36,010
Wait, they're getting tagged, they're getting tagged.

3198
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:39,050
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

3199
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:40,590
Uh-oh, stinky.

3200
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:43,490
You're not just gonna hide here, aren't you gonna dip?

3201
01:55:44,230 --> 01:55:45,050
Aren't you gonna dip?

3202
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:45,550
Yeah, let's hide here then.

3203
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:46,170
Wee!

3204
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:52,510
Okay, if they run in through stairs, we need to just escape again.

3205
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:53,690
Guys, I'm a little nervous.

3206
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:57,150
Yeah, I'm taking the route out the back if they get up the stairs.

3207
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:57,770
I love your spot down there.

3208
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:00,110
Stinky.

3209
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:01,730
The best point.

3210
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:02,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, surely.

3211
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,750
We're good, we're good.

3212
01:56:04,930 --> 01:56:06,650
Guys, if they come in, we're good.

3213
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:08,390
Ten seconds.

3214
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:09,890
Internal panic.

3215
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:11,810
Oh, God.

3216
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:13,010
You ready?

3217
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:15,350
Jump down there to fight them.

3218
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:19,550
Yay, we lived just to get eliminated.

3219
01:56:19,850 --> 01:56:20,370
No!

3220
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:22,730
We lived to get eliminated.

3221
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:27,170
It's water time.

3222
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:29,270
Oh, my God, of course it's bucket, bro.

3223
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:30,910
It's water time.

3224
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:32,430
It's water time.

3225
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:33,990
Oh, it's over there.

3226
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:35,690
You think the water well has the bucket?

3227
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:37,670
It says it on the top left.

3228
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:39,350
Hello.

3229
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:44,470
We didn't go the wrong way, so that's good.

3230
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:46,610
Cow pen, where's the cow pen?

3231
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:50,870
Cow pen, it's at the cow pen, at the cow pen.

3232
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:52,450
Where's the cow pen?

3233
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:53,550
Where the fuck is the cow pen?

3234
01:56:54,610 --> 01:56:55,510
It's over here, it's over here.

3235
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:56,910
Cow pen.

3236
01:56:59,150 --> 01:56:59,870
Brown cow?

3237
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:07,870
Brown cow?

3238
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:10,310
Brown cow?

3239
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:13,050
Follow the Spanish minecrafters.

3240
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,170
The cows look a little silly today.

3241
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:16,830
Follow the Spanish minecrafters.

3242
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:18,050
Follow the Spanish minecrafters.

3243
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:19,370
I don't think we know where we're going.

3244
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:21,590
Here, here, here.

3245
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:25,190
Oh, we're going to the pig pen or the weasel pen.

3246
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,890
Weasel pen.

3247
01:57:26,570 --> 01:57:31,050
Follow the Spanish Follow the Spanish minecrafters.

3248
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:31,190
Bear.

3249
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:33,510
Look, there's the hen.

3250
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:35,810
They know what they're doing.

3251
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:41,750
Is it kick time?

3252
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:42,690
It's kick time, guys.

3253
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:45,450
Get the recipe ready, guys!

3254
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:51,470
Get the recipe ready!

3255
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,990
Guys, how do I get to that weed faster?

3256
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:11,250
Guys, how do I get to that weed faster?

3257
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:16,550
Guys, I don't know how to get to the weed!

3258
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:20,910
Guys, GG's, guys.

3259
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:21,510
It was...

3260
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:23,810
It was a good run.

3261
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:28,390
It was a good run.

3262
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:31,210
I don't know how to get to that weed.

3263
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:32,310
I'm so...

3264
01:58:34,870 --> 01:58:35,750
I'm gonna go here.

3265
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:38,230
Guys, GG.

3266
01:58:38,330 --> 01:58:39,090
It was a good run.

3267
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,250
I don't know how to get to that weed faster.

3268
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:42,710
It was a good run!

3269
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:45,510
Goodbye.

3270
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:47,410
Goodbye, everybody.

3271
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:50,590
I'm too stressed out to do jumps.

3272
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:53,870
Oh, guys.

3273
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:55,270
Collect an egg.

3274
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:56,690
Oh, I know how to get the egg!

3275
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:57,870
This way?

3276
01:58:58,710 --> 01:58:59,270
This way?

3277
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:00,930
Oh.

3278
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:05,910
Guys, GG's.

3279
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:09,550
I don't know the route.

3280
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:12,590
Oh, no.

3281
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:14,130
I forgot the egg route.

3282
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:14,610
Guys!

3283
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:18,590
I forgot how... Guys, where's the eggs?

3284
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:21,030
Yeah, it has to be our tree next, right?

3285
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:22,410
But next one's awesome.

3286
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:24,730
Guys, where's the eggs?

3287
01:59:26,230 --> 01:59:26,670
Guys,

3288
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:31,630
where's the eggs?

3289
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:32,950
Where's the chicken coop?

3290
01:59:34,830 --> 01:59:36,270
Oh, is that the chicken coop?

3291
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:41,430
Is this the chicken coop?

3292
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:41,710
No?

3293
01:59:42,090 --> 01:59:42,750
Where's the eggs?

3294
01:59:43,730 --> 01:59:44,690
Where's the eggs?

3295
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:48,830
Farmer house?

3296
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:49,470
Is it this way?

3297
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:50,570
Oh, guys.

3298
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,090
I didn't know where the eggs were.

3299
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:54,710
I didn't know where the eggs were, guys.

3300
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:57,950
Is this where the eggs are?

3301
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:04,550
Guys!

3302
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:05,970
Guys!

3303
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:08,650
Guys!

3304
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:11,110
I didn't know where the eggs are.

3305
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:15,680
GG's.

3306
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:16,700
Guys, do you know where the eggs?

3307
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,280
I'm confused.

3308
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,200
Where are the eggs?

3309
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:21,820
Nobody's helping!

3310
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:24,940
Guys, it was a good run.

3311
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,560
I actually don't know where the eggs are.

3312
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,900
Guys, do you guys know where the eggs are?

3313
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:31,240
Guys?

3314
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:32,900
Do you guys know where the eggs are?

3315
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:33,840
Yeah.

3316
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:37,380
Where's the farmer's house again?

3317
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:38,720
I think I'm out though.

3318
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,480
I'm fucking GG's.

3319
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:41,940
Do you know where the farmer's eggs are?

3320
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:46,680
I think it's over.

3321
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,260
I think it's over.

3322
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:48,320
I got lost in the eggs.

3323
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,000
I got lost in the eggs.

3324
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,960
I survived the second day.

3325
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:55,840
I survived the second day.

3326
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:56,840
My chat fucked me.

3327
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,300
My chat made me lost.

3328
02:00:58,520 --> 02:00:59,440
And me too.

3329
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,480
I'm lost too.

3330
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:02,280
We're both lost.

3331
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:03,820
Right click, right click, hurry.

3332
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,820
Right click, hurry and run out.

3333
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:05,820
Okay.

3334
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:08,880
We got the eggs.

3335
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,500
We both got... chat, it's you and I.

3336
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:17,120
We both got lost together.

3337
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,280
We both got lost together.

3338
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:19,980
Doki.

3339
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:20,780
Yeah?

3340
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:23,160
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.

3341
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:25,300
I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.

3342
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:26,120
I'm so lost.

3343
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,800
It was a good run, Gumi.

3344
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,320
No, come on, Doki, run!

3345
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,120
You live on for me, Gumi.

3346
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:36,960
Gumi, live on for me.

3347
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:38,500
It's too late.

3348
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:40,800
It's too late, Gumi.

3349
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,380
We had a good run.

3350
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,840
You and we, just live.

3351
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:46,940
Gumi.

3352
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,280
Gumi.

3353
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,240
It's okay.

3354
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:52,460
It's over, Gumi.

3355
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:55,460
You have to accept the fact that it's over.

3356
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,240
It's over, Gumi.

3357
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,520
Gumi, it's over.

3358
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:03,860
It's over at last.

3359
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:05,520
Yes!

3360
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:09,480
Alright, I'm here to curse you all now.

3361
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:16,660
It's time to curse.

3362
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:18,560
Oh, my God.

3363
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,120
It's so cold.

3364
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:26,640
Oh, my God.

3365
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:27,500
It's time.

3366
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:29,860
Yes!

3367
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:33,800
Alright, it's time to be the curse.

3368
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:34,260
Yes.

3369
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:39,420
Oh, my God.

3370
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,580
Oh, my God.

3371
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:44,700
We're both idiots.

3372
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,000
We're both idiots.

3373
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:48,960
We're both idiots.

3374
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,140
Oh, my God.

3375
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:58,780
Shane, I was banking on following you this round.

3376
02:02:58,820 --> 02:02:59,220
Oh, my God.

3377
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:01,460
You seem very indecisive.

3378
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:01,640
We're both idiots.

3379
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:03,000
Which is kind of concerning me.

3380
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:05,500
Umi actually clutched it.

3381
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:07,300
Well, now you're going to my spot.

3382
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:09,980
Umi actually clutched it.

3383
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:10,820
What?

3384
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,320
No, no, no, trust.

3385
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:14,840
Trust, trust, trust.

3386
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,740
Trust, trust, trust.

3387
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:18,680
They're coming, they're coming.

3388
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,620
They went the other way at the start.

3389
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:26,680
So I don't know if they went the other way.

3390
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:29,080
We know he clutched it through the round with the chest.

3391
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:31,020
Josh, how do we get out of this place?

3392
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,340
Bro, you have to clutch up.

3393
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:41,220
It's the only way.

3394
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,060
Where's Sylvie?

3395
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,220
Hi, Apple.

3396
02:03:45,580 --> 02:03:47,400
I think people discovered our spot.

3397
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,740
They're coming, they're coming.

3398
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:54,460
They're coming, they're coming.

3399
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,380
They're coming, they're coming.

3400
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:58,060
Run here, run here.

3401
02:03:59,080 --> 02:03:59,880
I don't know what I said.

3402
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:01,800
I'm putting the chair under the table.

3403
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:02,580
Sorry.

3404
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:06,100
Guys, ball in the middle.

3405
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:07,180
Don't move, don't move.

3406
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,360
Try to get momentum.

3407
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:10,140
Come in, come in, come in.

3408
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,760
Umi actually took me to the finish line.

3409
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:15,320
He's right behind me, isn't he?

3410
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:17,440
Shout out to Umi.

3411
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:21,800
Shout out to Umi for taking me all the way to the end.

3412
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:23,460
So how are y'all doing?

3413
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,260
What the...

3414
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:27,080
Hola.

3415
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:29,940
I'm trying to get you bullied.

3416
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,420
Guys, we're both idiots, guys.

3417
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,020
There were so many instructions that I got scared.

3418
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:39,740
You know I panicked, guys.

3419
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,300
You know I panicked.

3420
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:43,160
We were both at fault.

3421
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:44,100
That's all, that's all.

3422
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:48,560
Except the fact that we both wanted to get there.

3423
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:52,020
Oh no.

3424
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:56,030
Okay, now this is where we leave.

3425
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:00,430
I got Kadazzer theme.

3426
02:05:02,090 --> 02:05:02,690
I got Kadazzer theme.

3427
02:05:02,690 --> 02:05:03,530
How is someone already finished?

3428
02:05:03,870 --> 02:05:05,030
You're blocking my shots, bro.

3429
02:05:05,170 --> 02:05:06,450
Give me a little space here, man.

3430
02:05:07,210 --> 02:05:08,070
I'm done, I'm done.

3431
02:05:08,230 --> 02:05:09,890
I got 12th, man.

3432
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:10,470
I kinda choked.

3433
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,890
Locked in.

3434
02:05:14,070 --> 02:05:15,550
We should probably back the fuck up.

3435
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:17,210
Locked in.

3436
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:19,490
That's so mean.

3437
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:20,270
Oh god.

3438
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:22,230
Umi.

3439
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,930
What?

3440
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:25,390
That's it?

3441
02:05:25,530 --> 02:05:25,750
No.

3442
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:26,730
Okay.

3443
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:28,930
Soki, you can do it.

3444
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:31,250
Bullet drop off, bullet drop off.

3445
02:05:31,370 --> 02:05:32,050
Aim a little higher.

3446
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:32,950
Okay.

3447
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:33,830
Nice, Soki.

3448
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:39,080
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!

3449
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,200
I got it, I got it, I got it!

3450
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,900
One more, one more, one more!

3451
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,820
One more, you got it!

3452
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,920
I have to do another day of this.

3453
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:53,880
Umi.

3454
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,000
Umi.

3455
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:56,420
Umi.

3456
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:01,040
We have to do day three, Umi.

3457
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:01,680
Wait, wait.

3458
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:04,000
You mean it!

3459
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:07,080
We have to do day three, Umi.

3460
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:07,900
We have to do day three, Umi.

3461
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:08,260
We have to do day three, Umi.

3462
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
You're the very last person!

3463
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:12,180
I hate that.

3464
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:14,440
Oh my god.

3465
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:17,240
I was... Umi clutched it and I was 85.

3466
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:19,520
And then I tagged somebody instantly.

3467
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:21,460
I know, I saw.

3468
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,220
Oh my god.

3469
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:23,700
Umi, you did it.

3470
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:24,260
Me and my chat.

3471
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,900
Now we play Valorant after this.

3472
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:28,260
Okay, Umi, my heart cannot take it right now.

3473
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:28,740
I'm fucking...

3474
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,300
I just want you to know.

3475
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,760
I went through like the five stages of grief there.

3476
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:41,080
Oh my god, no.

3477
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:43,220
My anxiety was peaking for you.

3478
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:48,920
The entire game, I didn't feel super anxious until you had...

3479
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,500
Oh my god.

3480
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:50,460
I was so lost.

3481
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:52,340
I was so lost.

3482
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,760
I didn't know where the eggs were.

3483
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:54,480
I was begging.

3484
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:56,560
Minecrafters are so cruel.

3485
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:57,260
I was begging.

3486
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:59,460
Nobody would tell me where the eggs are.

3487
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:01,520
And then sometimes they lie.

3488
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:04,440
Sometimes they tell you and then I'm like, I don't believe you.

3489
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:06,200
I can't believe it.

3490
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,440
You're not allowed to swear.

3491
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:10,940
But they gaslight us instead.

3492
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:13,560
They gaslight us.

3493
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,500
We made it.

3494
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:16,080
We made it.

3495
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:17,780
We did it.

3496
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:22,260
Is something scary going to happen?

3497
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:25,040
And then there's a possibility that we don't make it because...

3498
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,260
Guys, I don't know where the four embers are.

3499
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,880
There's so many houses.

3500
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:29,740
There's so many houses.

3501
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,260
The hard part was you guys were like, Stop.

3502
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:34,900
Back.

3503
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:35,500
There.

3504
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:36,260
Forward.

3505
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:38,520
That was what fucked me up.

3506
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:43,440
You guys were like, back.

3507
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:44,380
Forward.

3508
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,600
And I was like, back.

3509
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:46,200
Forward.

3510
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:46,900
Front.

3511
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:47,880
Left.

3512
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:55,360
Oh my god.

3513
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,760
When I was on the main stream.

3514
02:07:58,180 --> 02:07:59,740
Oh my god.

3515
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:02,260
I said my truth.

3516
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,500
I said my truth, guys.

3517
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,420
My truth.

3518
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,720
I didn't study.

3519
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,140
Please.

3520
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:16,160
A barn can be a house.

3521
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:17,420
I don't know.

3522
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:17,860
I don't know.

3523
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,320
I haven't been on the farm before.

3524
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:21,120
I'm a city gal.

3525
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:26,320
I'm a city gal.

3526
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:27,100
I'm a city gal.

3527
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:28,040
I don't know what's what.

3528
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:32,000
You don't say.

3529
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,280
Oh my god.

3530
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:35,620
40 people tomorrow.

3531
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:37,240
40 people get eliminated tomorrow?

3532
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,660
40 elims tomorrow.

3533
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:42,760
I still need two more.

3534
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:43,980
A house is a house.

3535
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:46,240
Tubbo died for this.

3536
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:46,460
Yeah.

3537
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,160
A minecrafter died so I can live on today.

3538
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:52,640
A minecrafter died so I can live on today.

3539
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:54,500
A minecrafter died so I can live on today.

3540
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:54,980
Gumi, please.

3541
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,860
Gumi, I don't know in my heart.

3542
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:58,000
What if I get a five stack?

3543
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,000
It's a five stack.

3544
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:00,220
A five stack?

3545
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:02,820
Okay, if you get a five stack going.

3546
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,500
I'm gonna go grab food though.

3547
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:07,480
I haven't finished my food.

3548
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,860
The last Vtuber lives on.

3549
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,960
The last Vtuber lives on.

3550
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:16,960
The last Vtuber died so I can be in day three.

3551
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:18,640
I can't believe it.

3552
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:23,360
I took an actual minecrafter spot.

3553
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:23,440
I took an actual minecrafter spot.

3554
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:23,940
I took an actual minecrafter spot.

3555
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:25,160
Too mean.

3556
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:26,040
Hi.

3557
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:28,120
Where's the new easter egg?

3558
02:09:30,620 --> 02:09:31,680
Equivalent exchange.

3559
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:32,760
Equivalent exchange.

3560
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:35,840
I'm just happy it's over.

3561
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:36,940
I'm happy.

3562
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,420
I can't believe it.

3563
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:43,840
I can't believe it.

3564
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:49,700
I can't believe it.

3565
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,920
I can't believe.

3566
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,260
Tomorrow we go again.

3567
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,020
Oh my god.

3568
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:04,520
I barely made it like four times.

3569
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:05,520
I should not be alive.

3570
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:07,580
I should not be alive.

3571
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:11,360
I already was going through like the five stages of grief of getting eliminated.

3572
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:12,500
Like...

3573
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:18,300
I have the plot armor.

3574
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,700
I have the plot armor.

3575
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:20,860
I'm the main character.

3576
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,740
I'm the main character.

3577
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:27,780
The main character plot.

3578
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:28,600
Guys, guys.

3579
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:37,960
How about we both agreed that we both fucked up together that we both fucked up together during that, the egg part.

3580
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:41,640
The egg section, we both messed up.

3581
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:42,240
Okay?

3582
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:45,460
As a group, we both take responsibility.

3583
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:49,140
And then Gumi clutched it for us.

3584
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:57,020
Gumi clutched it for us.

3585
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,420
But we both messed up together.

3586
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,720
Oh my god.

3587
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:07,180
Okay, group picture time.

3588
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:08,240
Oh gosh.

3589
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:11,580
How can we celebrate anything?

3590
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,720
He's gone.

3591
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:14,160
Who's gone?

3592
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:14,640
He's gone.

3593
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:15,920
Everyone's gone.

3594
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:18,340
Yeah, I took...

3595
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:20,460
I was the last person.

3596
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,320
I took a minecrafter's place.

3597
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:25,360
I don't even play this game.

3598
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:27,500
I just learned E is inventory today.

3599
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:29,440
That's crazy.

3600
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:32,820
And Tubbo lost to me.

3601
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:34,520
That's amazing.

3602
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:35,720
Oh my gosh.

3603
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:37,260
What a horrifying thing to hear.

3604
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:40,780
Oh my gosh.

3605
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,500
What a horrifying thing to hear.

3606
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:43,180
Yay.

3607
02:11:43,940 --> 02:11:44,360
Yay.

3608
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:49,000
Are we looking at the same area?

3609
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:50,960
I don't know.

3610
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,300
Where am I supposed to look at?

3611
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:56,780
Where am I supposed to look at?

3612
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,720
Where am I supposed to look at?

3613
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:00,460
I...

3614
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:03,660
I hope I'm looking at the...

3615
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:06,740
I hope I'm looking at the right area.

3616
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,260
I don't know.

3617
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:10,940
Who's the cameraman?

3618
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:13,400
Who's the cameraman?

3619
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:14,560
Two minutes?

3620
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:15,040
Oh.

3621
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:17,960
Okay.

3622
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:19,360
No.

3623
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,880
I have to be in front for exposure.

3624
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:34,520
As one of the last few non-Minecraft players in this lobby, I deserve to be in the front.

3625
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,960
Who messed up the...

3626
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,380
That's not fair.

3627
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:43,420
You guys have to be mature about this.

3628
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:46,140
I was mature enough to take responsibility.

3629
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:50,980
But now you guys also have to be mature enough to also take responsibility.

3630
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:53,540
Guys.

3631
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:56,560
We are mature adults here.

3632
02:12:57,400 --> 02:13:00,380
We should both equally take the blame.

3633
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:08,160
Guys.

3634
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:11,220
We both equally share the blame.

3635
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:12,520
But we can all agree.

3636
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:15,100
Gumi clutched it for us.

3637
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,880
Gumi saved our asses.

3638
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,660
Who was it?

3639
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:22,820
That kept on going.

3640
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:23,880
Left.

3641
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:24,600
Right.

3642
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:25,560
Back.

3643
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:26,200
Forward.

3644
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:31,260
Yay.

3645
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:32,840
We did it.

3646
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:34,100
No.

3647
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:36,060
It was me.

3648
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:36,940
Guys.

3649
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:37,100
Look.

3650
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:38,500
I was very overwhelmed.

3651
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:42,440
As the non-Minecraft player.

3652
02:13:42,660 --> 02:13:44,680
I am already directionally challenged.

3653
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:45,540
Guys.

3654
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:53,100
I was already very directionally challenged.

3655
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:54,980
Oh.

3656
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:55,840
You finally relaxed.

3657
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:58,800
Why does...

3658
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,740
Guys.

3659
02:14:00,410 --> 02:14:07,060
Why did my urge of wanting to win overpowered my rest week?

3660
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:14,240
I can't believe we made it today.

3661
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:17,000
It doesn't matter.

3662
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:18,820
We are going to get eliminated anyway.

3663
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:23,140
We are just too competitive.

3664
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:26,500
Oh my god.

3665
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,380
This is the most stressful rest week of all time.

3666
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:31,240
It really is.

3667
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:36,640
It's actually the most stressful rest week we've had.

3668
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:40,180
Each game has... It's like...

3669
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:42,040
Why am I so stressed out?

3670
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,900
Why am I so stressed out?

3671
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:50,900
Oh my god.

3672
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:53,560
Oh my god.

3673
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:53,840
Oh my god.

3674
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:54,040
Oh my god.

3675
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:54,060
Yes.

3676
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:56,700
Alright.

3677
02:14:56,740 --> 02:14:57,380
We are going to call it here.

3678
02:14:57,780 --> 02:15:00,940
Apparently, Gumi wants to 5-stack Valorant.

3679
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:03,380
So we might be back after I finish eating.

3680
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,480
And...

3681
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:08,260
After we finish eating and...

3682
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:10,580
Give...

3683
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:13,320
Give...

3684
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:13,860
Wait.

3685
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:14,560
What was I going to say?

3686
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:16,160
Fuck.

3687
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:16,540
Oh, sorry.

3688
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:19,780
After I finish eating we might pop up on Gumi's stream.

3689
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:22,320
And so I'm going to give her a raid.

3690
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:22,940
Hey guys!

3691
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:25,780
For those who are new here, I actually stream on the YouTube's.

3692
02:15:25,780 --> 02:15:27,400
It's less stressful over there.

3693
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:33,020
It's a lot less stressful over on the YouTube's side.

3694
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,100
So check me out there.

3695
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:36,380
If you don't want...

3696
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:41,260
If you don't want anxiety in each game because I don't know how to read.

3697
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:43,380
Check me out on the YouTube.

3698
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:46,700
And if you guys want to know whenever I go live on Twitch.

3699
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,600
Check me out on...

3700
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:49,580
Follow me on Twitter.

3701
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,580
So you know whenever I'm live on Twitch, guys.

3702
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:55,380
And...

3703
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:57,240
If you want to support me through other means.

3704
02:15:57,460 --> 02:15:58,920
Please feel free to check out my merch.

3705
02:15:59,160 --> 02:15:59,660
Hey guys.

3706
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:03,240
I can finally stop shaking.

3707
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:11,220
I swear nothing has made me as anxious or stressed out lately but this.

3708
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:12,960
Like I don't even play Minecraft.

3709
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:14,220
I don't know why.

3710
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:16,520
I don't even play Minecraft.

3711
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:19,360
Why is this so fucking nerve wracking?

3712
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:20,460
Hey guys.

3713
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,060
As always everybody stay hydrated.

3714
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:22,960
Posture check.

3715
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:24,700
Get more around to get that blood flowing.

3716
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:26,400
And if you suffer from it, head to bed.

3717
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:27,520
Because you deserve it.

3718
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:28,680
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3719
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:29,980
Bye guys.

3720
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:30,860
Bye.

3721
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,980
Forgot to say thank you for all the subs, bits, and files.

3722
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:21,160
Sorry I've been so stressed out that I've been so forgetful.

3723
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:22,160
Bonus ending.

3724
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:25,120
Thank you for all the subs, bitties, and files everybody.

3725
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:26,740
Anyway, bye for real.
