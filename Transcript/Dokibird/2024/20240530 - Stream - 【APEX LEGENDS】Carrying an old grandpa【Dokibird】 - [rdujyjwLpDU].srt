00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,600
I just...

74
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,900
I hit, like, seven bullets and none of them registered.

75
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
I just need you to know that.

76
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh, shit.

77
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,640
Also, chat, how's the volume for Tengen now?

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
How is that?

79
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,780
Is that okay?

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,040
How's my volume on Tengen stream, too?

81
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
You'll be fine.

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,220
I mean, I put you on compressor.

83
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,580
Oh, that's true.

84
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,520
Wait, so what have you been playing recently, Dungeon?

85
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,060
I know you've been playing that finals game for just a
tournament.

86
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,640
Uh-huh, even though it's just for tournament.

87
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,140
Yeah.

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
What did I play?

89
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,160
Yeah, what have you been playing?

90
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,140
Look, we've been having a rut, okay, guys?

91
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,680
We have like...

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,380
That's a good question.

93
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,980
We have, like, zero FPS games to play these days.

94
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,900
It is a hard time for FPS games.

95
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,580
Yeah, it's a hard time for us.

96
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,040
I like how someone said Tengen, life alert fund, but then
super chat it to me.

97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,880
Thank you, man.

98
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,640
Don't worry.

99
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,540
I'll make sure Tengen gets it.

100
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,180
Oh, wait.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,460
Have you tried X-Fion yet?

102
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,600
Um...

103
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,620
My friend's been trying to convince me to play, actually.

104
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,000
The good part is that there's no skill-based matchmaking.

105
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,040
Yeah, that's what I heard.

106
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,160
heard and it's like overwatching call of duty at the same
time don't like the pace how do you not like the pacing you

107
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,340
never played it yet i played the close beta like oh yeah you
got in beta oh okay yeah you think it's better than i got in

108
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,980
twice i felt i don't know is it is it just me like that i
haven't been touching that game in a while because like it

109
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:15,880
feels slower for somebody or am just thinking oh no i
haven't tried it yet because when the beta oh right they're

110
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:26,320
literally on the tree bro i'm blind they're literally right
in front of us tendon what the that's why you're old i'm not

like today what do you

112
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,720
It took you two hours to have white hair.

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,360
Oh my gosh.

114
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,280
What the fuck?

115
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,640
Oh, that's their whole team.

116
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,060
You can 1v3 that.

117
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,760
You're tension.

118
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
What does that mean?

119
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,220
You're tension.

120
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,160
That's what I mean.

121
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
You'll be fine, right?

122
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,360
Yeah, see?

123
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,780
Wait, where's his teammate?

124
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Nice.

125
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,700

Nice, man.

127
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,660
That is a long finish.

128
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,680
Yeah, I was gonna say.

129
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:22,520
bro took everything i killed yeah bro like what the wrong
with him bro i know right this is this is why he took

130
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:32,660
everything this is why chat this is why this is why you have
white hair i can't believe that man would do that i haven't

131
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:42,240
even i haven't even It was close.

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
We almost leaked it.

133
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,780
You know, if he had all his stuff, he would have.

134
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,520
Gorillas.

135
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,380
Yeah, he would have gorilla debut.

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,460
And I was like, do it.

137
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,580
He was like, shit out.

138
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,060
And I was a bad influence.

139
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,040
I was like, you should.

140
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,640
Man.

141
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,700
A bad idea is still an idea.

142
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,600
I mean, it would have been pretty cool.

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,500
It would have been funny.

144
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,420
I would have thought it would have been funny.

145
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,500
Because you're like...

146
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:18,180

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,240
Like, to be fair, our third was... Maybe we needed a fourth.

254
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,300
Yeah, maybe we need a fourth player to make up for this
Mirage.

255
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,840
We do.

256
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,940
Oh, yeah.

258
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:32,900

264
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:09,260
no like literally last week like some cable on the ocean was
like broke down into like something i guess yeah so we got

265
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,760
like redirected to another whole server so we could not
connect to singapore so it just there's a whole lot of

266
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:25,380
latency for a couple of while wait was that for like
indonesia only uh i guess it happened for like five four

bit the cable probably what the fuck well we never knew what

269
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,540
really happened i just said like i just suddenly got emailed
like oh something's wrong under the water so we're sorry

270
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:08,660
here's a compensation oh my god no the server oh wait oh
it's okay guys i thought i thought that was my internet that

271
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:18,080
would so funny if that was my internet i was like oh no the
shark fit another cable like there's no way that was like

272
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:33,600
the timing of that too i was like there's no way a shark
literally fit another cable nice okay oh no that's not the

273
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:52,320
gun i wanted oh what the oh i might need help oh wait no

274
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:01,760
that's calm down that's sorry I was that's why I was
watching the horizon the horizon was pretty embarrassing you

275
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:10,540
were yelling at me and you're spectating at the raw person
look no no no I was still knocked okay I still look Look, I

276
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,580
didn't realize you were not the horizon.

277
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
But you're playing...

278
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,120
Wait, what's her name again?

279
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,520
I already forgot her name.

280
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,180
I care.

281
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,780
Alter?

282
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,440
What do you think about Alter?

283
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,340
I'm not even sure.

284
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,120
It's fun.

285
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,160
I think...

286
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,820
Like, I can make portals randomly and then people would just
get thrown off.

287
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,260
I feel like Alter...

288
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,760
I made a portal out of nowhere and they just go through it.

289
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,220
I feel like Alter, you need to have a good team to play with
her.

290
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,860
Because she's so...

291
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,380
Oh, she's...

292
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,200

00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,160
You can be a PNG.

305
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,260
Yeah, but you can be a PNG until you debut because you don't
know when you're debuting yet.

306
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,020
Maybe tomorrow.

307
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,960

Yeah, I am.

312
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,020
But you don't know when that's going to be.

313
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,240
you know like i begged like you can just debut without the
stinger and then you just like it just shows up one day yeah

314
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:26,880

00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,360
He's, like, an old grandpa.

Um, and, like, in his lore, he has, like, white hair.

343
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,780
It's always about the white hair.

344
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,760
It's the only thing I can say that won't actually leak
anything.

345
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,960
That's, that's honestly true.

346
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,000

I think you can, right?

854
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,650
There's a lot of dead bodies in there.

855
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,550
That must be where they died.

856
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,450

That was cool.

991
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,910

992
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,530
You died a cream de la pussy.

993
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,790

00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,170
I expected that so much.

997
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,690
That was that back and forth.

998
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,090
Yo, there's a second team.

999
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,770
There's a second team.

1000
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,210
There is.

1001
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,110
We landed with like four teams.

1002
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:24,970
Oh my god.

1003
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,330
I mean, you clutched it.

1004
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:35,450
you clutched it and then you died well that's a win in my
book yeah oh shit whoa whoa okay he must have a shotgun ball

1005
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:50,680
there's no way that swap was so fast to see that that's that
was such a fucking fast swap man i have been streaming apex

1006
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:58,440
for three days straight have i were you actually streamed a
really i thought you know you played finals finals there's

1007
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:07,040
apex and then apex and then a break and then apex at night
and then apex and then now you apex yay i mean it shows it

1008
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:16,400
it shows that you're warmed up well probably it's mostly
stupidity because it's just the boys oh because you guys are

1009
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:24,460
playing rank right yeah we were yeah that's all your goals
so someone someone challenged us well someone challenged my

1010
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:29,860
teammate yeah, if you reach Masters, someone's gonna buy him
like a scuff controller or something like that, I don't

1011
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,100
know.

1012
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,080
But yeah, why does he want a controller?

1013
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,140
Because he's a controller player.

1014
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,240
I don't know.

1015
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,460
Oh, wait, no, tell him to get him a battle beaver.

1016
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:40,960
What's that?

1017
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,300
I don't do controller.

1018
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,000
That's like the controller that everybody use, like all the
pros uses.

1019
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,420
Oh, for real.

1020
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:47,780
Yeah.

1021
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,460
Let him know that.

1022
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,960
Yeah, I know because I bought one and I never used it.

1023
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:07,420
yeah i know we just met but i could tell you'd do that you'd
do that wait so like he needs to be masters to get that yeah

1024
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:17,480
but that's so fucking easy i know right yeah wait what what

01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,260
Yeah, they're just gonna camp us out.

1211
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,620
Let's head to the tunnels.

1212
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,000
It's not worth it.

1213
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:43,920
Not worth it.

1214
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,540
The zone is closing anyway, so...

1215
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,480
Wait, can we make it?

1216
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,100

Apparently, like, I tweeted out that, like, I joined a cool
religion.

1254
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:26,120
Apparently, cool in, like, I guess, like, Brazilian is ass.

1255
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,340
So I technically tweeted out, I joined an ass religion
today.

1256
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:36,880
All my, like, Brazilian dragoons are really confused.

1257
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,960
I never knew you were an ass person.

1258
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:48,840
I was like wondering why there's so much Brazilian comments.

1259
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,240
Shhh.

1260
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,200
Oh shit, it's King China.

1261
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:55,640
Fah!

1262
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,020
Why did I play Alter?

1263
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,260
Why did I go Alter?

1264
01:11:59,140 --> 01:11:59,840
Ah, damn.

1265
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,700
Yeah, so apparently people were like...

1266
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Why are you, why are you saying ask?

1267
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,220
So how did you join the ask hold?

1268
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,760
And like, where do I sign up, you know?

1269
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,860
Did you tear it open or what?

1270
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,580
Oh my god.

1271
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:28,460
Whoops.

1272
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:30,600
Whoops.

1273
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,720
I mean it works still.

1274
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,780
It works still.

1275
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,300
Yeah, it's Portuguese.

1276
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,760
Apparently, I don't even know how it's pronounced.

1277
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:48,920
But, like, someone in my comments, the replies were like,
oh, the Brazilian dragoons are coming.

1278
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,860
And I got so confused.

1279
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,880
I got so fucking confused.

1280
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:52,500
I was like, why?

1281
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,200
And then I saw it.

1282
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,060
It's silent and deadly religion.

1283
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,560
And I was, and then I saw, like, I guess I saw Portuguese in
my chat, like, in my replies.

1284
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,780
And I was like, why is there so much Portuguese?

1285
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:16,060

I was waiting for the new email, but, like, it wasn't sent.

Oh, wait, wait.

1330
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,400
Wait, he can do this.

1331
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,420
He's better.

1332
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:00,780

1334
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:01,340
He can.

1335
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,540
He's so much better.

1336
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,600
Someone's resing.

1337
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,140
Yeah, it's the guy that our guy fucking...

1338
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,140
Okay, he's not that better.

1339
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,740
You're never mind.

1340
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,240
He's not that much better.

1341
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,600
Look, maybe I'll be there at an Indonesian convention.

1342
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,840

1343

1346
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,800
I told you to tell them to email me, and you just, like,
replied back to the old email.

1347
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,100
Yeah, but like it's the old email.

01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,180
Indeed.

1372
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,820
I was just like, oh my god.

1373
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,160
That was so real.

1374
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:46,920
I'm fucked.

1375
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,540
They landed there, really?

1376
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,180
I don't have a gun.

1377
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,720
You don't have a gun.

1378
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,480
I have one gun.

1379
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,760
You know, like, they made a thing where you loot a pill.

1380
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,940
They automatically give you a gun when you first land.

1381
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:00,280
Oh, shit.

1382
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,180
Are they following us?

1383
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:01,900
Oh, fuck.

1384
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,820
No, I don't have a gun.

1385
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,340
Hey, oh my god.

Oh, I'm gonna rotate.

1388
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,000
If you guys die, it's on you.

1389
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,800
Oh, there's guns here.

1390

01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,470
They're scared now.

1392
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:23,010
They're scared.

1393
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,630

What else?

1411
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,570

1412
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,230

01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,050

That's what I do.

1562
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,730
That's what you do.

1563
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:10,870
Why fix when I can just buy?

1564
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,350
Because I can fix it.

1565
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,790
And I can't buy it.

1566
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,790
It's so much work.

1567
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,970
Monetarily wise?

1568
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:23,630
Yeah.

1569
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:25,210
I guess I can buy it.

1570
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:25,990
Yeah.

1571
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:29,250
But then I'll just change the switch immediately.

1572
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:31,730
You're not even, yeah, and then you can sell the old one.

that now you can auction off your i you know what you could

1574

What do you mean, ew!

1580
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:11,850
It's like a collection!

1581
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:13,070
Eww!

1582
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:17,670
Yeah, it comes with the it comes with the gamer sweat.

1583
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:19,590
What skills, indeed, I don't have one!

1584
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,550
The gamer sweat.

1585
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,590
Yeah, it just comes with my sweat, and that's it.

1586
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:27,630
Yeah, and then...

1587
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,510
Oh yeah, they like that, what the fuck?

1588
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:30,470
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

1589
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:31,890
The hell?

1590
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,410
That sounds like they're not, they're not buying it for the
skills.

1591
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:38,750
Put the mouse in the what?

1592
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:39,750
A jar.

1593
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:41,930
Oh, what the fuck?

1594
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:42,670
Okay, but tension.

1595
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,870
Think about the amount of money you'll get.

1596
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,250
Think about it.

1597
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:50,030
No.

1598
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,070
Think about it.

1599
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:52,230
You know, you know, it's tempting.

1600
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:53,370
You know, it's tempting.

1601
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:54,010
No.

1602
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:55,410
You know, you should auction it off.

1603
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:59,030
Yeah, but and then if it's signed too.

1604
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:03,050
What the fuck?

1605
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:03,870
I'm just...

1606
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:06,390
I'm just helping Tengen make money.

1607
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:07,330
What do you mean?

1608
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,250
Dude.

1609
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,850
Wait, what's that?

1610
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:11,270
You're fighting someone?

1611
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:14,610
Bro, this guy, I think this guy's special.

1612
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:18,970
Do you just go around and call people special?

1613
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,730
No, you should have seen what I just saw.

1614
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,590
Okay.

1615
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:27,470
You should have seen what I saw.

1616
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:32,710
You literally stood there to get shot at for, like, at least
five seconds.

1617
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:34,890
right here.

1618
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:37,310
He's definitely special.

1619
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:40,810
Don't hit him.

1620
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:43,230
I'm trying to figure out.

1621
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:43,910
Do you know where they are?

1622
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:44,990
I can't see them.

1623
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:46,450
Like, below me?

1624
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:46,890
Hey.

1625
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,990
You'll be fine?

1626
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:52,470
Ha!

1627
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:53,430
Ha!

1628
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:54,490
Ha!

1629
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,430
Oh, you'll be fine?

1630
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:58,150
Oh, you got them.

1631
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,730
There's his teammate, though.

1632
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:02,810
I'm in the sky waiting.

1633
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:04,970
Surely.

1634
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,550
Surely.

1635
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:07,310
Does he have heavy ammo?

1636
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,390
Is this a special guy?

1637
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:10,410
I almost killed?

1638
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:10,790
No.

1639
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:13,310
No, it's not.

1640
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:14,050
Let me know you're fine.

1641
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:14,750
Oh wait, I hear him.

1642
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:18,010
I know you guys find heavy ammo.

1643
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:21,410
Oh, there he is.

1644
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:24,850
Oh Was that the special kid?

1645
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,650
Um, what did he do?

1646
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,150
What did he do?

1647
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,230
This...

1648
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,290
What happened?

1649
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:35,830
What the fuck did he do?

1650
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:36,830
What?

1651
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:41,830
Okay, he blasted the whole Spitfire at me and didn't hit a
single one.

1652
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:44,510
I am like shotgun ranged, man.

1653
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:45,990
That might have been him.

1654
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:47,730
Oh my god.

1655
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,430
I told you.

1656
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:51,490
He's special.

1657
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:53,590
Oh wait, wait.

1658
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:56,050
From my right, I see the sniper.

1659
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,730
Oh wait, he's actually hitting you.

1660
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,290
Nice scream.

Oh, true.

2048
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:36,890
That's actually true.

2049
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:38,210
That's three weeks of food.

2050
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:40,670
Wait, really?

2051
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:43,750
If you find your place right, yeah.

2052
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:44,530
Oh my god.

2053
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:46,130
Bro.

2054
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:52,790
Other than, I guess like the only trade-off is that like
customs fucking suck.

2055
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:54,410
Yeah, well.

2056
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:59,350
You know, I'm $10 richer.

2057
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:00,510
I can almost say that.

2058
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:02,910
Yeah, only if you win this game though.

2059
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:03,930
What?

2060
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:04,790
Yeah.

2061
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:08,150
It applies to your winning the game.

2062
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:09,750
What?

2063
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:11,790
So it doesn't...

2064
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:13,870
A 20 bomb plus the win.

2065
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:18,150
All right, I grabbed some armor.

2066
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:21,110
$10 is $10.

2067
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:21,910
Honestly, yeah.

2068
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:23,190
Weather kind of suck.

2069
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,290
Was the weather suck?

2070
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:25,670
Why?

2071
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:27,130
It's hot.

2072
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:28,150
It's been like...

2073
01:57:28,150 --> 01:57:29,890
I mean, that's Asian in general, though.

2074
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:32,030
Is that just Asian?

2075
01:57:32,270 --> 01:57:32,490
Yeah.

Oh my god, we actually killed a child.

2081
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:09,330
Where's his teammate?

2082
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:10,030
In the game.

2083
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:10,690
In the game.

2084
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:11,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2085
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:12,390
In the game.

2086
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:13,990
My lawyer advises me.

2087
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:16,550
Nice.

2088
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:17,470
I got the kill.

2089
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:21,050
In the game.

2090
01:58:21,310 --> 01:58:21,750
In the game.

2091
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:22,210
Once again.

2092
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:22,910
In the game.

2093
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:24,190
We don't want to repeat.

2094
01:58:26,810 --> 01:58:28,670
Okay, but do you see that bloodhound?

2095
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,070
You are so confused.

2096
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:31,230
Whoa!

2097
01:58:32,150 --> 01:58:32,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2098
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:36,570
I'm gonna get healed real fast.

2099
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:39,350
To my left.

2100
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:42,250
Why?

2101
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:42,870
Don't leave.

2102
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:43,810
Where did he go?

2103
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:44,470
Oh, there he is.

2104
01:58:45,530 --> 01:58:46,450
Wait, he didn't get hit?

2105
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,190
He's so low!

2106
01:58:53,010 --> 01:58:53,770
Knocked him?

2107
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:55,110
Where's his teammate?

2108
01:58:59,310 --> 01:58:59,870
Bye!

2109
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:01,610
Bye!

2110
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:03,370
Give me your loot.

2111
01:59:05,570 --> 01:59:06,630
You'll be fine, right?

2112
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,090
Surely.

2113
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:10,350
Oh, no, there's another team.

2114
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:11,830
There's another team?

2115
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:13,150
Oh, wait, there's another team above, yeah.

2116
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:13,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2117
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:14,470
I'm bailing.

2118
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:14,850
I'm bailing.

2119
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,610
Where's the other...

2120
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:17,750
Where's his teammate, then?

2121
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:18,550
Shit.

2122
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:20,950
They're scared.

2123
01:59:23,070 --> 01:59:23,950
Wait, I hear him.

2124
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:24,610
To my left.

2125
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:25,910
Yeah, yeah, he's in here.

2126
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:26,550
He's in there.

2127
01:59:26,890 --> 01:59:27,630
He went inside.

2128
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:31,330
I didn't get him.

2129
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:34,330
How am I going to say I leaked this?

2130
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:34,950
Whoa!

2131
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,090
Red armor?

2132
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:39,550
What?

2133
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:40,610
That?

2134
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:43,590
Don't worry, I got you.

2135
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,430
Nice.

2136
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:50,410
They have to come to us.

2137
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,570
This team has to come to us.

2138
01:59:52,230 --> 01:59:52,790
Hold on, huh?

2139
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:55,290
Like four seconds.

2140
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:56,810
Oh man, dude.

2141
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:57,710
Yeah, they're rolling down.

2142
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:58,210
They're rolling down.

2143
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:58,750
I'm watching.

2144
01:59:59,190 --> 01:59:59,630
Sure, right?

2145
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:05,710
I'm just holding them.

2146
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:07,430
Where they at?

2147
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:09,770
My ping?

2148
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:10,390
Oh, there they are.

2149
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:10,830
My ping, my ping.

2150
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:12,870
On me?

2151
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:14,790
Behind us, raw?

2152
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:15,370
Yeah.

2153
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:18,930
Wait, that's like a solo.

2154
02:00:19,310 --> 02:00:19,650
Hiding.

2155
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,930
There's a solo right there.

2156
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:28,110
Yeah.

2157
02:00:29,170 --> 02:00:30,270
No, no, no, no, no.

2158
02:00:30,910 --> 02:00:31,230
No!

2159
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,990
Wait, that's not even a solo.

2160
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:39,110
Ooh, you want that.

2161
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:39,990
You want that.

2162
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,870
Wait, where did he go?

2163
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,850
Did someone rotated this?

2164
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:43,650
Yeah, they did.

2165
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:45,390
No way.

2166
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:46,430
No way.

2167
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:46,570
No way.

2168
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:47,870
No kill for you.

2169
02:00:48,170 --> 02:00:50,170
No way they rotated that.

2170
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:52,070
That's crazy.

2171
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:53,810
Hey, what the fuck?

2172
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:57,350
All right, one last team.

2173
02:00:58,430 --> 02:00:59,030
Uh-huh.

2174
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:02,810
One last team.

2175
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:02,990
Uh-huh.

2176
02:01:02,990 --> 02:01:03,130
One last team, huh?

2177
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:05,510
It would be funny that one team killed us?

2178
02:01:07,730 --> 02:01:09,210
That would be so funny.

2179
02:01:10,230 --> 02:01:12,690
It'll be so fucking funny, you know it.

2180
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:16,850
Wait.

2181
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:17,530
That's open.

2182
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:19,850
Yeah, we're getting shot by it.

2183
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:21,390
Oh my god!

2184
02:01:21,930 --> 02:01:24,430
Would it be funny if I just throw that right now?

2185
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:28,830
Oh, it's over there.

2186
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:35,610
Whoa, where am I getting shot from?

2187
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:36,110
I swear.

2188
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:38,050
What are you something stupid?

2189
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:39,670
It's like they're hitting me mid-airs.

2190
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:44,590
Oh wait, what the fuck?

2191
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:46,590
They're not one.

2192
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,860
Where's his teammate?

2193
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:58,360
Wait, his teammate's so far.

2194
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:00,740
They made a nexus.

2195
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:01,820
Oh!

2196
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,380
That's dumb.

2197
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,800
Tengen wants to get last kill!

2198
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:08,760
Tengen!

2199
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:10,520
Tengen!

2200
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:16,400
Man, they went by a nexus.

2201
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:17,540
That's annoying.

2202
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,440
Holy shit.

2203
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:21,520
They made it to Nexus to go back.

2204
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,460
Unlucky, Tengen.

2205
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,180
You had...

2206
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:25,580
That's crazy.

2207
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:27,140
Unlucky.

2208
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:30,240
That's crazy.

2209
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:32,960
Oh, but you got that...

2210
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:33,440
You got...

2211
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,820
Okay, but you didn't get other kills.

2212
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,720
Okay, that was 90 for the win.

2213
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:38,240
And...

2214
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:38,780
How much?

2215
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:39,940
How much?

2216
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,560
Whoa, you got seven kills?

2217
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:43,540
Bro, Red Sea.

2218
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:44,060
Red Sea.

2219
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,600
Delete your YouTube channel, Red Sea.

2220
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:51,180
That's 160.

2221
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,080
What?

2222
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,220
Yeah, the 90 on top.

2223
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,460
Also, Red Sea, I'm joking.

2224
02:02:57,580 --> 02:02:58,680
Don't delete your YouTube channel.

2225
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,720
But, like, bro, it's a little embarrassing, bro.

2226
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:07,880
A win?

2227
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:09,720
Yeah, you got a win.

2228
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:11,880
A win?

2229
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,020

Um, very long day.

2350
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:46,290
I didn't think I was going to play Rust for so long.

2351
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:49,450
Um, but I actually enjoyed the role-playing.

2352
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:51,830
And, like, it was actually funny.

2353
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:55,450
Like, Will Neff actually followed me back on Twitter, which
I thought was funny.

2354
02:11:55,930 --> 02:11:57,210
Which I thought was really nice.

2355
02:11:57,550 --> 02:12:01,710
Because, like, I didn't think he would, like, you know,
because he's also, like, a pretty big streamer.

2356
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:06,810
So, like, um, I thought it was really nice that Will Neff
followed me back.

2357
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:10,770
For those who don't know who he was, in Rust, he was, like,
he was Uncle.

2358
02:12:11,010 --> 02:12:11,830
He was Uncle...

2359
02:12:13,690 --> 02:12:14,090
Uncle...

2360
02:12:14,110 --> 02:12:32,370

Because I was like, oh, man.

02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:56,150
I don't think I have the energy for tomorrow.

2368
02:12:56,610 --> 02:12:57,490
I don't.

2369
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:03,590
I don't think I have the fucking energy.

2370
02:13:05,730 --> 02:13:06,030
Um.

2371
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:07,510
Yes, everybody.

2372
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:08,610
It was such a fun time.

2373
02:13:08,670 --> 02:13:09,890
Today was actually really fun.

2374
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:12,250
I was honestly so nervous.

2375
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:13,550
Uh.

2376
02:13:14,190 --> 02:13:16,210
So nervous today in Rust.

2377
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:18,870
And I like that.

2378
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:26,950
I'm happy that I was able to have such a fun experience.

2379
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:29,470
In Rust with everybody.

2380
02:13:30,110 --> 02:13:31,250

02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:33,030
Making like new friends and stuff.

2382
02:13:33,430 --> 02:13:34,250
And role playing.

2383
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:36,150
Because I'm always scared of role playing.

2384
02:13:36,610 --> 02:13:38,970
Because I'm very scared of like.

2385
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:41,250
I feel like I'm not a very good role player.

2386
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:44,090
So like I'm always super scared about role playing.

2387
02:13:44,110 --> 02:13:55,270
just because i don't think i'm good at role playing so i'm
glad that like i'm glad that i was able to to art like you
