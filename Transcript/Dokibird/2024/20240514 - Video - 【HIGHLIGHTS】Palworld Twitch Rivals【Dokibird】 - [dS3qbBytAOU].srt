1
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,810
Alright, character build, speedrun.

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,570
Alright, it looks like me.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,270
I'm getting my hair color.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,310
I'm good to go.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,190
I might need to look a little bit more healthy.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,650
Wait, this game has lore?

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,790
I did not know that.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,910
You have 150 hours on this game!

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,370
What do you mean?

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,850
I don't know, I just thought it was like pew pew pokemon.

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,970
Alright, I'm holding F.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,970
Oh my god!

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,750
Alright, where's our base?

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,050
What are we doing for our base?

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,210
Figure it out, motherfucker.

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,010
What do you mean?

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,630
Where are we building our base?

18
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,810
I'm making a workbench right here.

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,950
Basically what we're gonna do is work our way towards where we're gonna set up the base and just catch shit along the way.

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,870
If you get lost, just ask the gods where it is.

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,170
Alright, no problem.

22
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,710
Let me tab out real quick and ask the gods.

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,370
Murder is wrong from our PAL level?

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,530
That's a problem.

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,870
One of the global events is we have to get 20 humans and put them in the viewing cage.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:06,830
Oh wow!

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,090
That's neat!

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,830
I love that!

29
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,730
We had to catch like 5 of them earlier too.

30
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,190
How many people do we already have?

31
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,710
We have 1 people.

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,150
Hopefully we're about to have more people.

33
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,510
I will catch people too.

34
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,250
Yeah!

35
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,150
People catching!

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,310
This is what we wanted, Nintendo!

37
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,790
This is what we wanted!

38
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,670
I wanna catch Professor Oak.

39
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,630
We got another person.

40
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,590
You got another one?

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,930
Anyway, there's a guy down here in the rock.

42
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,190
If anybody has a PAL vault and wanna catch him, he's gonna be here.

43
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,450
I'm heading over.

44
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,130
Don't worry.

45
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,450
Where are you?

46
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,050
You have to hit him in the head because he doesn't have a hitbox.

47
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,330
Yeah, I got him.

48
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,510
No!

49
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,670
I got him out though.

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,910
Come on, get over here.

51
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,350
Oh, I got it!

52
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,110
We got it!

53
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,670
Wait!

54
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,310
There's a shiny lamp!

55
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,290
Don't kill it!

56
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,410
We get extra points as well.

57
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,670
I'm beating him up right now.

58
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,190
Oh, I got it!

59
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,970
I got a shiny!

60
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,530
Clip it!

61
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,590
Clip it, chat!

62
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,330
Clip it, bro!

63
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,030
Alright, go kill this sweeper.

64
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,810
Go die, Willow.

65
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,930
I only have a pickaxe, so I'm not helpful.

66
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,190
No, not the babies!

67
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,810
We don't care about the babies!

68
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,730
Oh god, oh god, I might actually die.

69
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,090
Give me that sweeper!

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,130
I missed!

71
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,550
Nice!

72
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,410
Clip, clip, I got them!

73
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,910
Another boss down.

74
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,750
Let's go!

75
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,230
We're on our way to get $500.

76
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,810
We're last place right now.

77
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,910
We're already at $500.

78
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,310
Guys, we're sort of 15th place right now.

79
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,030
We're 16 teams, right?

80
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,690
Guys, we're not last!

81
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,090
These things, we can do it so fucking fast.

82
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,890
I'm just saying.

83
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,310
Oh, we just got last place apparently.

84
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,030
Guys, don't worry.

85
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,850
I can speedrun all these bosses and then we're gonna get out of this.

86
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,850
We'll be fine, we'll be fine.

87
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,890
Because all we need is to catch up.

88
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,750
Oh my god, you're level 10!

89
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,790
I didn't even realize.

90
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,010
No, no, I meant like my wolf is level 10.

91
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,150
Yeah, because I forgot I killed the other one accidentally.

92
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,490
You don't lose your pals when you die.

93
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,650
No, but he died because I drowned him accidentally.

94
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,950
I did not!

95
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,470
I had to replace him for a little bit.

96
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,050
I had to replace him for a little bit.

97
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,730
Go Fox, go!

98
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,970
I don't have a weapon still because I keep...

99
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,290
Whoa!

100
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,210
He fucking almost one-shot me.

101
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:40,850
Holy shit.

102
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,790
Do you have a shield?

103
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,790
No, we don't need shields.

104
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,690
Shields are for losers.

105
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,470
I say as I'm about to die.

106
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,510
Can I catch him?

107
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,150
He's definitely dead.

108
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,110
Oh, okay, cool.

109
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,710
More balls, less shields.

110
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,210
That's right.

111
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,450
Please don't get involved.

112
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,930
Come on.

113
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,010
Please, at least give me that!

114
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,350
I got him!

115
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:03,830
I got him!

116
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,250
Clip it!

117
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,610
I'm dead though, but I got Grintail.

118
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,770
That's all that matters.

119
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,510
I can't seem to stay alive.

120
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:11,850
Whoa!

121
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,690
Shiny!

122
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,090
He, like, spawned next to me!

123
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,870
I was like, what am I hearing?

124
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,230
Oh, shit.

125
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

126
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,350
Please, I'm going to catch you.

127
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,790
Clip it!

128
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,490
Clip it!

129
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,110
I got him!

130
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,430
I got him!

131
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,850
That's fine!

132
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,790
I got the fuck.

133
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,150
And I died next to the respawn beacon.

134
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,270
It was worth it.

135
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,130
I'm gonna go capture the quiver right now.

136
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,230
Alright, let's hope I don't die.

137
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,550
Let's go.

138
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,050
Oh shit!

139
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,310
I don't think I'll be fine.

140
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,090
Oh, I don't have arrows.

141
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,790
Why do I keep forgetting to bring arrows?

142
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,770
Trying to catch this man!

143
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,010
Oh no, I'm too strong!

144
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,050
He's dead.

145
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,730
Oh well.

146
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,330
Oh no.

147
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,150
It is what it is.

148
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,350
No!

149
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,250
What is our ranking now?

150
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,290
My chat says that our ranking has not been updated.

151
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,650
Well, to be fair, we haven't really been doing any achievements.

152
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,030
We've just been like progressing.

153
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,870
I got quiver and clip clip clip!

154
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,670
Clip clip clip!

155
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,370
Oh, the cutest fucking pal in the game.

156
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,690
I would die for that thing.

157
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,630
Triph, have you done anything that hasn't been clipped yet?

158
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,430
Uh, I mean I've clipped a bunch of stuff but I haven't submitted anything.

159
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,910
I don't know.

160
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,770
Oh yeah, what have you not submitted?

161
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,550
I don't know.

162
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,470
I just asked them to clip and then I move on.

163
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,190
What is it?

164
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,970
What did you do?

165
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,070
Fuck it, they're in the clips!

166
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,090
I don't know what to tell you man!

167
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,610
What does it mean?

168
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,590
I'm trying to do as much as I can in the small amount of time I have.

169
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,190
What is your mission?

170
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,390
I'm trying to do as much as I can in the small amount of time I have.

171
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,770
What is your mission right now?

172
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,990
I'm fucking killing the bosses!

173
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,690
What do you think man?

174
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,070
Well, how many bosses have you done?

175
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,030
Fucking like six, seven, I don't know.

176
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,290
Oh, did we even clip seven of Shareforce bosses?

177
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,150
They're in the clips.

178
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,750
We need to make sure we got everything.

179
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,310
Please.

180
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,570
Oh, clip clip clip!

181
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,550
I got the... clip clip clip!

182
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,190
Let's go!

183
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,930
I got the bat!

184
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,590
I got the bat!

185
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,930
Okay, I can do one more boss I think.

186
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,110
Okay, I can get the doom mud.

187
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,410
Doom mud, get over here!

188
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,690
The last 10 points right here!

189
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,170
The last 10 points right here!

190
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,370
Let's go!

191
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,450
One fucking min-maxing?

192
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,470
Yeah, it was worth a try.

193
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,910
I wanted those tokotokotokos.

194
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,550
But then I had to use like five...

195
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,850
...trazillion balls on one.

196
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,210
Oh, please, please no.

197
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,210
That's a lot of balls.

198
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,630
That is...

199
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,250
Doom mud, I got doom mud clips!

200
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,250
I got doom mud!

201
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,430
Nice!

202
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,930
We got...

203
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,290
MVP!

204
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,910
Okay, how many minutes do I have left?

205
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,750
Oh, one minute.

206
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,490
Okay, that's it.

207
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,790
I got the one we needed.

208
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,050
Alright.

209
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,270
Here we got the one.

210
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,570
Here we got the one.

211
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,330
And then bot got all of our...

212
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,750
...palace that we captured.

213
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,070
Chill, Sweet, TwoMoss, Doom Mud, Pen King, Azuro, GrinTale, Broncherry.

214
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:35,750
Right?

215
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,410
We got Broncherry.

216
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,250
Kempaka.

217
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,850
Bushi, Quiverne, Felbat, Natalia, Broncherry Aqua, Warsec, Relaxasaurus.

218
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,050
Is that all of them?

219
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,270
We have everything.

220
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,070
Now we die.

221
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,890
Okay, now we're done.

222
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,170
Yay!

223
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,850
We can start now!

224
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,050
Okay, let's go!

225
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,330
Yay!

226
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,750
Let's go!

227
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,350
I'm ready to clip this when I defeat this tower.

228
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,730
Shoutout to my mods.

229
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,890
Thank you so much for clipping everything yesterday.

230
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,110
You're the realest.

231
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,650
They now have a nickname thanks to Dokie.

232
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,790
They're now called the PP mods.

233
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,750
PP mods?

234
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,790
Which sounds like...

235
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,350
PP mods?

236
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,450
I feel like the bosses just aren't, like, as worth it in this game.

237
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,430
I guess it's like Dark Souls, so it's like...

238
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,490
It's not as rewarding to kill them.

239
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,230
Yeah.

240
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,030
Van Worm, please!

241
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,750
Stop!

242
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,730
Oh my god.

243
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,650
My Van Worm got stuck.

244
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,750
No, why are you hungry?

245
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,330
You're not allowed to starve!

246
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,330
Stop starving!

247
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,270
Stop starving!

248
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,170
I didn't tell you!

249
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,610
Stop building!

250
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,970
Get the fucking bug here!

251
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,650
These fucking pals!

252
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,590
The gold-crafted balls!

253
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,510
This is not what I paid you for because you're not getting paid in general.

254
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,730
You're allowed to survive if you make balls.

255
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,850
Yeah.

256
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,090
Earn your food!

257
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,090
Let's go!

258
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,990
Finally!

259
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,890
Assembly line.

260
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,690
Clip this!

261
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,430
Clip, clip, clip, clip!

262
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,170
Boss eliminated!

263
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,390
Clip, clip, clip!

264
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,410
I'm starving.

265
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,030
I'm on HP.

266
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,570
Something's gonna sneeze and I'll die.

267
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,250
Hahaha!

268
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,190
In that moment, we get raided.

269
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,770
Right there.

270
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,290
No help.

271
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,750
Those five berries are for our pals, okay?

272
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,910
They gotta split it between the 14 of them.

273
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,330
Well, now it's too bad.

274
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,430
Now they have zero berries.

275
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,310
Oh ho ho!

276
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,890
Because I'm starving.

277
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,390
Lily's life matters more than the power.

278
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,390
Hahaha!

279
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,370
Exactly!

280
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,630
More easy.

281
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,930
Come on, leave me alone.

282
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,050
Leave me alone.

283
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,010
Oh shit.

284
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,230
Okay, do my... your turn.

285
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,030
You're level 22.

286
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,870
I think you'll be fine.

287
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,330
Actually, no.

288
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,590
You will not be fine.

289
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,650
Oh shit.

290
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,370
What?

291
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,450
You'll be fine.

292
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,170
Everything will be fine.

293
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,730
Alright, now.

294
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,510
You stay here.

295
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,050
You...

296
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,130
Oh my god.

297
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,310
Why is it 8%?

298
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,870
Alright, clip clip clip.

299
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,770
I got it for a dash.

300
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,610
Clip clip clip.

301
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,630
We got our first medium bosses.

302
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,330
Let's go!

303
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,550
Alright, who's the next boss?

304
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,090
That is a level 38.

305
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,010
I am not high enough level for this.

306
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,390
We don't have a choice.

307
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,410
Trust the process.

308
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,250
Trust the pal.

309
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,930
Trust Lily.

310
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,370
She is a certified pal.

311
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,110
Best pal.

312
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:43,990
I'm a certified pal.

313
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,270
Look, I'm fighting Lily.

314
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,770
How dare you!

315
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,170
You're fighting Lily?

316
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,090
I'm fighting Lily right now.

317
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,830
We're just friends.

318
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,290
Come on.

319
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:50,530
No!

320
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,310
Hahaha!

321
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,430
Let's go.

322
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,730
Yeah, I'm gonna beat the fuck out of you.

323
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,030
I'm gonna beat the fuck out of you.

324
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,210
I don't think I can kill the second tower girl.

325
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,770
She's way too strong.

326
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,270
No.

327
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:00,850
Noob down.

328
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,690
Oh god.

329
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,730
Uhhh... I don't know.

330
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,990
I feel like this is the fastest.

331
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,870
I'm not really...

332
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,510
I knew it was in the fastest.

333
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,850
Clip clip clip!

334
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,190
I finished tower two!

335
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,310
Let's go!

336
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,550
Clip clip clip!

337
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,830
Oh my god.

338
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,610
We did it.

339
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,190
Mine.

340
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,990
Back to work.

341
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,370
Work work.

342
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,270
Enough standing around.

343
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:20,770
Work work work.

344
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,090
It's time to get back to sleep.

345
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,630
Sweep sweep sweep.

346
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,050
That was fun.

347
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,210
Let's have some more of some time in some time soon.

348
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,790
Okay, you really do sound like the voice from the game though.

349
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,890
You can just tell me that you're the guy from...

350
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,250
You know...

351
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,070
Dude, I would be a sick voice actor.

352
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,810
Get a voice reel right now and apply.

353
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,550
I don't know how that fucking works.

354
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,470
Just have a...

355
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,490
Do I have to join like some voice actors guild or some fucking...

356
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,970
No, I don't think so.

357
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,970
Use your clout.

358
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,730
No, I ain't got clout.

359
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,170
Just be like, I'm a voice actor.

360
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,850
Haha, I'm a voice actor.

361
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,270
Done.

362
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,890
If you never try, you'll never get employed.

363
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,130
I don't want to try.

364
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,950
Why not?

365
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,070
I just want everything to be given to me.

366
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,490
I gotta stop talking like a true content creator.

367
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,250
How to become a voice actor.

368
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,950
Step one.

369
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,870
Declare intent.

370
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,490
It's just that easy.

371
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,150
Amazing.

372
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,770
I can do a... kill the mammarist, right?

373
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,810
Okay, well let's see if I can kill it.

374
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,850
If you need help, good luck.

375
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,890
Thank you.

376
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,470
I really appreciate that.

377
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,670
If you need help, no one can.

378
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,110
Good luck.

379
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,890
Haha, no one can help you.

380
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,070
But if you need it...

381
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,390
You're on your own.

382
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,630
Oh, this boss is easy.

383
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,910
I'm so fucking tanky now.

384
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,610
Or my pals are tanky.

385
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,350
Go pal, go.

386
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,590
I'm so good at Dark Soulings now.

387
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,070
Leave me alone.

388
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,090
My god, please.

389
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,470
Come on, mammarist.

390
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,370
Alright, let me check for time.

391
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,250
I'm just trying to catch my mammarist.

392
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,510
Why is it 5%?

393
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,710
This mammarist is taking fucking forever.

394
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,950
Oh my god, I think I definitely need a hyperspear or some shit.

395
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,970
What are the mats for hyperspear?

396
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,530
I have... we have all the mats.

397
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,610
I just can't kill them.

398
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,970
We need circuit boards.

399
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,050
I need to build this.

400
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,530
Oh, so mammarist is caught.

401
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,390
Clip, clip, clip.

402
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,070
I got it.

403
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,610
Clip, clip, clip.

404
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,630
Are you guys all ready for dungeon?

405
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,110
Yes.

406
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,070
Alright, alright.

407
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,970
Let's go find the...

408
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,930
Oh, yeah.

409
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,270
Make sure you don't get hit.

410
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,090
Just keep running.

411
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,310
Wait, did you get a wolf finally?

412
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,210
Pee pee.

413
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,510
I forgot to fucking bring it though.

414
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,050
I might die actually.

415
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,030
Pee pee, no.

416
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,970
I am consenting to witnessing a murder.

417
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,530
I am consenting to witnessing a murder right now.

418
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,770
911, please.

419
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,470
There's a murder happening right now.

420
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,230
Go, Panky.

421
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,850
Go, Vam.

422
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:22,950
Go, Vam.

423
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,510
Go, little guy.

424
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,150
You got this.

425
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,150
Well, I am just going to watch.

426
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,090
I don't have any fucking weapons anymore.

427
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,050
Yay, murder.

428
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,490
Yay.

429
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,530
Are you going to catch him?

430
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,110
No.

431
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,370
Clip, clip, clip.

432
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,250
Clip, clip, clip.

433
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,170
Pee pee, Vam.

434
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,830
Clip, clip, clip.

435
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,410
Alright.

436
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,570
Nice.

437
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,390
Watch.

438
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:41,690
Alright.

439
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,350
Clip, clip, clip.

440
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,990
We are here!

441
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,770
Clip, clip, clip.

442
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,550
We have life sanctuary 2.

443
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,510
Alright, I am leaving.

444
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:45,930
Goodbye.

445
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,950
Alright, clip, clip, clip.

446
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,470
Alright.

447
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,750
Clip, clip, clip.

448
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,170
Clip, clip, clip.

449
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,210
Bye.

450
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,230
You guys wanna do the petting now?

451
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,650
Yeah.

452
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,690
Let's do water first.

453
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,350
Let's just go in order.

454
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,450
Alright, 3, 2, 1, go.

455
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,210
There you go.

456
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,090
Clip, clip, clip!

457
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,670
Clip, clip, clip!

458
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,190
Alright, water's done.

459
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,760
Okay, well we have like 30 minutes, so you guys like...

460
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,380
Let's try to speedrun this.

461
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,720
Surefour and I can finish the rest of the bosses.

462
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,800
I'll try to build the...

463
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,120
We need to be at level 20 as well to make the zoo with 20 people in it.

464
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,480
Yeah, alright.

465
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,700
Surefour, do you wanna do the black marketeers right now with me?

466
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,060
I found the black marketeer, level 40.

467
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,000
Fuck him up.

468
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:29,940
Let's go.

469
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,420
We gotta capture him.

470
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,260
Oh my god.

471
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,100
Oh, he's...

472
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,460
Yeah, he's getting fucked up.

473
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,260
I'm a little over -encumbered.

474
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,820
Nice.

475
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,240
Nice.

476
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,000
12 percenter.

477
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,680
Let's go.

478
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,300
We got one of the black marketeers.

479
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,120
We just need one more.

480
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,480
Clip that!

481
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,100
Clip, clip, clip!

482
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,740
Clip us catching that one, then get it later.

483
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,760
My game's done.

484
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,340
I'm base level 20!

485
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,220
Clip, clip, clip!

486
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,360
Clip, clip, clip!

487
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,620
Base level 20.

488
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,720
Alright, viewing cage.

489
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,580
But we also need you to put in the humans.

490
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm putting in humans.

491
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,460
I'm putting in humans.

492
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,540
How do I put the humans in?

493
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,120
You walk up to it and hit X.

494
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,460
Okay.

495
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,440
Um...

496
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,520
I died.

497
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,560
How many do they need?

498
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,380
Okay, I'm putting more than three.

499
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,860
They're all gonna be in there.

500
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,040
Alright!

501
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,600
Clip, clip, clip!

502
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,580
Clip, clip, clip!

503
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,840
Viewing cage!

504
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,700
We need like two more!

505
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,460
Alright!

506
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,280
Surefour, you need to be back by three minutes if you can, so we can do the chickpea.

507
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,460
I'm getting the butcher knives.

508
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,800
Do we have to do it all at the same time?

509
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
I think so.

510
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
We should all get together, then.

511
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,920
We need to do this fast, because I need to go get my shit.

512
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,200
Let me know when you guys are ready.

513
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,180
How do I cleave them?

514
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,280
Uh, put it in your inventory.

515
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,160
Put it in your inventory.

516
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,480
Wait, I have it in my inventory, but I don't have a butcher option.

517
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,040
You have to be holding it.

518
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,520
You have to be holding it.

519
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:25,980
Yeah, hold it.

520
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,400
Hold it.

521
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,340
Wait, hold it?

522
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,060
I can't hold it.

523
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,560
You, you...

524
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:28,680
You, you...

525
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,860
You, you...

526
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,160
Weapon slot!

527
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,420
Quick!

528
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,440
Time is of essence!

529
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,680
I need to get level 50!

530
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,560
Put it in the weapon slot!

531
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,100
What do you mean?

532
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,440
You just dragged it there!

533
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,960
Take away one of your items!

534
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
Take away one of your items!

535
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,940
Alright, you guys are bugged.

536
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,260
You guys might have to re-log.

537
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,080
You have to re-log.

538
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,560
You have to re-log.

539
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,820
There's no other way to explain it other than just put it in your weapon slot.

540
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,400
That's the only way we can win.

541
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,760
That's literally all you do.

542
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,800
What do you mean?

543
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,840
You're picked at!

544
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,620
You're literally bugged.

545
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,860
You have to re-log.

546
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,540
I just re-logged.

547
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,820
And now I can't put it in my weapon slot.

548
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,440
Yeah, just re-log.

549
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,760
I still haven't re-logged!

550
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,520
What do you mean?

551
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,740
Put it in your weapon slot!

552
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Re-log!

553
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,700
No shot!

554
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,800
Okay, wait, I've got it.

555
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,100
It's there.

556
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,700
It's there.

557
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,440
It's not working anymore.

558
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,180
I got it.

559
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,480
I got it.

560
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,960
I got it.

561
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,340
I got it.

562
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,440
I got it.

563
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,920
I got it.

564
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,220
I got it.

565
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,540
I got it.

566
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,960
I'm gonna put it in my weapon slot.

567
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,020
No way you're thinking that, Brenn!

568
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,540
What?

569
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,980
I go downstairs and butcher this chicken.

570
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Finally.

571
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,640
All right, I'm downstairs.

572
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,180
Let's go.

573
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,660
Let's go.

574
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go.

575
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,060
All right, press.

576
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,340
Remember to press four.

577
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:28,980
One.

578
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,400
Go!

579
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,760
Butcher!

580
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,160
Clip, clip, clip!

581
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,080
Clip, clip, clip, clip!

582
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,480
Got it.

583
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:34,960
We got it.

584
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,060
It's right there.

585
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,400
You have one minute to get to level 50.

586
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,820
I'm gonna get to level 50.

587
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,600
What can you do in one minute or 30 seconds?

588
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,000
36 seconds.

589
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,100
I can't.

590
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,240
I can't.

591
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,740
I can't kill a boss.

592
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,080
Okay, I don't think we can get that in 30 seconds.

593
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,600
Your statue.

594
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,160
Your statue.

595
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,700
Your statue.

596
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,280
You know what, though?

597
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,200
We did really good.

598
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
Oh, we did pretty well.

599
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,260
We did pretty good.

600
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,020
We did pretty good.

601
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,240
If only I got 50, man.

602
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,440
If only I got 150, man.

603
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,160
We almost got 120, man.

604
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,800
That was the most stressful last five minutes.

605
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,660
Holy .

606
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,120
Top 3 guys!

607
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,360
I can't believe it everyone!

608
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,240
Top fucking 3!

609
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,700
Plus 1!

610
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,760
Plus 1!

611
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,880
Holy shit that was so fun!

612
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,980
When we started I still can't believe it.

613
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,340
The last 3 minutes we were just screaming at each other.

614
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,020
We were just like, guys!

615
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,120
I hope you guys had a great time with us today.

616
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,860
I'm really happy with my team, with PeePee, Chatlily and Surefour.

617
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,480
It was a great team.

618
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,460
So thank you everybody!

619
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,840
I'm gonna call it here.

620
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,920
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

621
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,020
Bye guys!

622
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,880
Bye!
