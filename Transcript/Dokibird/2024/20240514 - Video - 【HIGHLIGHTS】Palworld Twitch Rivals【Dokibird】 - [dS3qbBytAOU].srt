00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,850
Where are we building our base?

6
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,190
PP.

7
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,970
I'm making a workbench right here.

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,130
Basically, what we're going to do is we're going to work our
way towards where we're going to set up the base and just

9
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,030
catch shit along the way.

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,950
If you get lost, just, you know, ask the gods where it is.

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,550
Ask the gods.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,310
All right, no problem.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,810
So let me tab out real quick and ask the gods.

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,990
Murder is wrong from our pal level, right?

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,730
That's a problem.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,950
One of the global events is we have to get 20 humans and put
them in the viewing cage.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,370
Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,370
Oh, wow.

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,330

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,290
Hopefully we're about to have more people.

27
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,770
Yeah, I will catch people too.

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,570

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,350

Oh my god, you're level 10.

74
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,110
I didn't even realize.

75
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,430
Okay.

76
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,010
You kill him?

77
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,330
No, no.

78
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,230
I meant like my wolf is level 10.

79
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:19,730
Level 10.

80
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,510
Yeah, because I forgot I killed the other one accidentally.

81
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,650
You don't lose your pals when you die.

82
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,970
No, but he died because I drowned him accidentally.

83
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,910
I didn't.

84
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,670
So I had to replace him for a little bit.

85
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,530
Go Fox.

86
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,950
Go.

90
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,470
Whoa, whoa.

91
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,350
He fucking almost one shot me.

92
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:40,790
Holy shit.

93
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,890
Do you have a shield?

94
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:42,630
No.

95
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,870
We don't need shields.

96
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,030
Shields are for losers.

97
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,690
I say as I'm about to die.

98
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,250
Yeah.

99
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,610
Can I catch him?

100
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,390
He's definitely dead.

101
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,010
Oh, okay.

102
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:51,670
Well.

103
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,250
More balls.

104
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:52,890
Less shields.

105
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,350
That's right.

106
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,790
At least don't get involved.

107
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,250
Come on.

108
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,190
Come on.

109
00:03:59,530 --> 00:03:59,970
Please.

110
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,310
At least give me that.

111
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,430
I got him!

112
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,430

114
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,690
I'm dead though, but I got Grintel.

115
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,950
That's all that matters.

116
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,790
I can't.

117
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,750
seem to stay alive.

118
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,910
Whoa, shiny!

119
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,410
He, like, spawned next to me.

120
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,230

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,450
Please, please, I'll let you catch you.

124
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:23,990
Please.

125
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:24,910
Clip it!

126
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,590

127
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,270

128
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,630
I got him!

129
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,030
That's fine.

130
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,970
I got the fuck.

131
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,350
And I died next to the respawn beacon.

132
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,350
It was worth it.

133
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,730
Oh, look.

161
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,330
They're in the clips.

162
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,970
We need to make sure we got everything.

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:38,970

00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,510
One fucking min-maxing?

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,730
Yeah, it was too hard.

179
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,570
It was worth a try.

180
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,950

But then I had to use, like, five trazillion balls and one.

182
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,370

187
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,150
Is that over them?

188
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,530
We have everything.

189
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,290
Now we die.

190
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,110
Okay, now we're done.

191
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,430
You can start.

192
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,070
Okay, we can start now.

193
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,210
Okay, we can start.

194
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,010
Let's go.

195
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,590
I'm ready to clip this when I defeat this tower.

196
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,830
Shout out to my mods.

197
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,110
Thank you so much for clipping everything yesterday.

198
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,190
You're the realist.

199
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,690
They now have a nickname thanks to Doki.

200
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,990
They're now called the Peepy mods.

201
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,790
Which sounds like something that I feel like the bosses just
aren't like as well.

202
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,530
worth it in this game.

203
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,350
I guess it's like dark so so it's like it's not as rewarding
to kill them.

204
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,370
Yeah.

205
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,970
Van Worm please stop!

206
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,790
Oh my god.

207
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,810
I've Van Worm got stuff.

208
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,990
No, why are you hungry?

209
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,550
You're not allowed to starve.

210
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,470
Stop starving!

211
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,490
Stop starving!

212
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,470
I didn't tell you.

213
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,750
Stop building!

214
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,250
Get the fucking butt here!

215
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,010
These fucking pals!

216
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,710
The gold craft balls!

217
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,690
This is not what I paid you for because you're not getting
paid in general.

218
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,990
You're allowed to survive if you make balls.

219
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,010
Yeah.

220
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,310
Earn your food.

221
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,570
Let's go!

222
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,130
Assembly line.

223
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,570
Clip this clip, clip, clip, clip.

224
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,630
Boss eliminated.

225
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,390
Clip, clip.

226
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,570
I'm starving.

227
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,210
I'm on HP.

228
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,170
Something's gonna sneeze.

229
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,790
I'll die.

230
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,890
In that moment, we get raided right there.

231
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,190
No.

232
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,910
Those five berries are for our pals, okay?

233
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,030
They gotta split it between the 14 of them.

234
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,410
Well, now it's too bad.

235
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,610
Now they have zero berries.

236
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,070
Because I'm starving.

237
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,710
Lily's life matters more than the pal.

238
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,550
Exactly.

239
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,810
More easy.

240
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,030
Come on, leave me alone.

241
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,790
Leave me alone.

242
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,010
Oh, shit.

243
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,310
Okay, dude, my dear turn.

244
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,130
You're level 22.

245
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,930
I think you'll be fine.

246
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,490
Actually, no.

247
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,770
You will not be fine.

248
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,670
Oh, shit.

249
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:18,730
What?

250
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,490
That'll be fine.

251
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,290
Everything will be fine.

252
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,850
All right, now.

253
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,730
You stay here.

254
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,310
Oh, my God.

255
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,350
Why is it 8%?

256
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,030
All right, clip, clip, clip.

257
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,990
I got over a dash.

258
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,550
Clip, clip.

259
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,790
We got our first medium bosses.

260
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,710
Let's go.

261
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,890
All right, who's the next boss?

262
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,210
That is a level 38.

263
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,150
I am not high enough level for this.

264
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,550
We don't have a choice.

265
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,530
Trust the process.

266
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,310
Trust the pal.

267
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,490
Trust Lily she is a certified pal I'm a certified pal look
I'm fighting Lily

268
00:08:50,490 --> 00:09:07,730

269
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,810

Clap, clap, clap!

272
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,870
Oh my god, we did it.

273
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,050
Back to work.

274
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,490
Enough standing around.

275
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,970
Work, work, work.

276
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,910
It's time to get back.

277
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,750
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

278
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,710
Sweep, sweep.

279
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,470

280
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,910

I think so.

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,260
We shall get together then.

357
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,060
We need to do this fast because I need to go get my shit.

358
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,360
Let me know what you guys are already.

359
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,300
How do I cleave them?

360
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,400
Put in your inventory.

361
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,260
Put in your inventory.

362
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,700
Wait, I have it in my inventory, but I don't have a butcher
option.

363
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,020
Yeah, hold it.

364
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,460
Hold it.

365
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,420
Wait, hold it.

366
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,320
I can't hold it.

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,360
Wait.

368
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,520
Time is of this.

369
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:30,880
Guys!

370
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,860
I need to get level 50.

371
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,700
Put it on the weapon slot.

372
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,260
What do you mean?

373
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,880
You just drag it there.

374
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,140
Take away one of your items.

375
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,960
Take away one of your items.

376
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,540
Take away one of your items.

377
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:41,960
You guys are bugged.

378
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,320
You guys might not have to re-log.

379
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,100
You have to re-log.

380
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,620
You have to re-log.

381
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,100
Just re-log.

382
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,920
There's no other way to explain it other than just put it in
your weapon slot.

383
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,540
That's the only way we can win.

384
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,900
That's literally all you do.

385
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,980
What do you mean?

386
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,000
You're picked at?

387
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,640
You're literally bugged.

388
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,780
You have to re-log.

389
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,600
I just re-logged.

390
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,940
And now I can't put it in my weapon slot.

391
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,460
Yeah, just re-log.

392
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,820
I still haven't re-logged.

393
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,660
What do you mean?

394
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,960
Put it in your weapon slot.

395
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,100
No shot.

396
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,880
Okay, wait, I've got it.

397
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,720
It's there.

398
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,540
It's not worth it anymore.

399
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,400
I got it.

400
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,580
I got it.

401
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,120
I got it.

402
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm trying to put the chicken in my fucking weapon slot.

403
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,140
No fucking way you're thinking that, friend.

404
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,420
I go downstairs and butcher this fucking chicken.

405
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm downstairs.

406
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,260
Let's go.

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,740
Let's go.

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,080
Let's go.

Clip, clip, clip, clip.

Clip, clip.

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,580
Got it.

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,440
We got it.

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,740
