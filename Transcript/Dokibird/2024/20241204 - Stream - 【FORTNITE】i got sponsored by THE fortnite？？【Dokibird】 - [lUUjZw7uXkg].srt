1
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,710
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,690
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,150
Oh my god, sorry for being late.

4
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,010
Um, the Minecraft...

5
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,110
The Minecraft, uh, Twitch Rivals lasted longer than I expected.

6
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,950
Um, I thought it'd be three hours, but I guess because we made it to the finals, it was four hours.

7
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,430
Um, but yes, um, spoiler alert, we won.

8
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,550
That's why it took so long.

9
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,290
So, yeah, um, I won't be talking too much about...

10
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,110
There won't be life updates today because, like, today is a special day!

11
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,530
I mean, well, today is a packed day as well, because we also had the Fortnite...

12
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,370
Uh, not the Fortnite, sorry.

13
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,630
We had the Minecraft Twitch Rivals, but today we're also sponsored by Fortnite!

14
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,690
Yes!

15
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,170
This is sponsored by Fortnite!

16
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:55,890
Well, this video, this stream will be made into a highlight video, which is the official sponsor for it, but, like, since it's coming from this stream, um, uh, we're gonna be checking out the newest updates to Fortnite, so, like, Chapter 6, and some of the newest cosmetics,

17
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,890
the Battle Pass, all of that.

18
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:07,150
Um, it's actually uh, crazy, uh, because, um, um, I did not expect to get that email.

19
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,410
I was actually not expecting that at all.

20
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,710
I remember when I, I, uh, when I, I, because I read the email first, and I was like, oh my god, is this real?

21
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:31,590
And then, um, my, uh, my manager that reads the emails was actually on holiday, so then I was like, so I had to reply to myself, to it myself, and I was like, um, hello, this is the Doki Bird team, and, like, I'm so interested.

22
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:42,830
I was like, hi, this is the Doki Bird team, and, like, we'd like to know more details about this, uh, about the sponsor, uh, that you're, oh shit, Mint!

23
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,290
Oh, I have it disabled?

24
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,230
Wait, I have, no, it's cause Mint's not subscribed to me!

25
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,890
Hahahahaha!

26
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,630
That's right!

27
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,890
Mint, I have it so that you have to be subscribed to me to raid me.

28
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,870
That's...

29
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,350
Hahahahaha!

30
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,330
That's a key, right?

31
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,230
Exposed!

32
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,870
Hahahahaha!

33
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,510
Hahahahaha!

34
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,970
Actually, I don't know if that's true, I just said that just to, like, make you feel a little bad.

35
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,850
Actually, let me, let me check.

36
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,110
Actually, I don't even remember how to change it, cause I don't remember how to...

37
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:24,830
Hahahahaha!

38
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,530
Actually, let me check that.

39
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,490
You know, that makes sense!

40
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,330
I was like, that makes sense why now, now that I think about it, I was like, oh yeah, that's why I don't get raided.

41
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,530
Cause I, I have it so that people can't even raid me.

42
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,410
Oh, here.

43
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,690
Sorry, I turned it off.

44
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,350
Um...

45
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,170
Sorry.

46
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,270
Wait, no, I do have it!

47
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,770
Yeah, it's cause you weren't subscribed!

48
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,250
Man!

49
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,310
I don't even know she's here.

50
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,490
I do have that permission on!

51
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,630
You have to be subscribed to her!

52
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,290
Okay, now all channels can...

53
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,770
Now all channels can raid me.

54
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,250
Hahahahaha!

55
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,870
Hahahahaha!

56
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,070
That's a key, right?

57
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,650
I bet she's not even here right now.

58
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,190
Hahahahaha!

59
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,770
I bet she's...

60
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,670
Hahahahaha!

61
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,050
Oh, JK.

62
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,790
No, sorry.

63
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,930
Channels I subscribe to can redirect my content.

64
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,290
Oh, it's disabled because my channel subscription is, is private!

65
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,350
Oh!

66
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,070
It's cause, okay, now I understand.

67
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:35,970
It's cause, it's cause if the channel subscription, if our channel subscriptions are privated, um, so we both have private channel subscription, I'm subscribed!

68
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,290
I know I'm subscribed!

69
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,210
Hahahahaha!

70
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:46,270
But both of our channel subscriptions are privated, so like, um, you can't see it.

71
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,170
Oh, now you said something, man!

72
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,610
Oh, you were doubting it too!

73
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,970
You were like, wait, am I not actually subscribed?

74
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,770
Hahahahaha!

75
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,170
Okay, now all channels can redirect to my content now.

76
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,050
It's okay.

77
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,350
It's alright, we figured it out.

78
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,570
We figured it out, guys.

79
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,510
So it's both our faults, man.

80
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,670
It's both our faults.

81
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,810
No, I knew I was subscribed!

82
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,150
Hahahahaha!

83
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:27,250
No, no, it's both our faults, because we both have privated subscriptions, and because we both have privated subscriptions, um, it doesn't just allow redirect...

84
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,830
Hahahahaha!

85
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,770
To redirect...

86
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,490
Hahahahaha!

87
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,170
But now you can read it now!

88
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,750
Yay!

89
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,350
We did it, Mint!

90
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,090
We fixed the problem together!

91
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,510
Look at that!

92
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,070
We fixed the problem together.

93
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,790
Why is Mint not modded?

94
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,270
I don't know.

95
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,890
Why am I not modded on her channel?

96
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,050
I... Hahahahaha!

97
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,350
Hahahahaha!

98
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,470
Um...

99
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,850
Let's see...

100
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,250
Um...

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,710
But yeah, thank you again for the...

102
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,690
You first.

103
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,790
Um...

104
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,290
Thank you!

105
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,290
I hope everything is okay over there.

106
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,510
Um...

107
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,670
And that you'll feel better watching the stream.

108
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,050
No, her first.

109
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,050
She goes first.

110
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,810
Alright, I'm looking at...

111
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,170
Alright, Mint, I'm gonna look at your channel right now in the chatting thing, and then like, see if I'm modded.

112
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,090
Alright, am I modded?

113
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,230
I'm looking at her upcoming live stream.

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,870
Am I modded?

115
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,830
Not modded.

116
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,310
I'm not modded.

117
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,870
Hahahahaha!

118
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,090
Hahahahaha!

119
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,730
Anyway!

120
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,350
As I... As I was saying...

121
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,190
Why you don't... She doesn't even trust me as mod!

122
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,510
She doesn't even trust... This is a give or take, okay guys?

123
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,690
This is a give... A mod... Yeah, you know follow for follow.

124
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,750
Mod for mod.

125
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,210
Mod for mod.

126
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,730
Anyway, as I was saying, um... Yes, it's actually crazy.

127
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:13,270
I never expected myself to be uh... to be uh... sponsored by Fortnite of all games, because like, you know, I give them a lot of my money, so like, it's very surprising that they wanna give me money.

128
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:21,090
But I think they know that I'm gonna use the money they give me to buy more cosmetics and buy more outfits.

129
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,530
So like, to them, they're winning.

130
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:24,790
Hahahahaha!

131
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,610
Like...

132
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,450
I'm just gonna... I... Okay, so like, yesterday, I played...

133
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:37,650
If you guys didn't know, I played a little bit of Fortnite on Short4Stream, because he asked me to play Fortnite with him and his friends.

134
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,550
And then, literally, I booted it up, and then I...

135
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,410
I bought so many skins.

136
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,730
I bought so many cosmetics.

137
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,730
I was just like, ooh!

138
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,590
You know you can have Jordans now?

139
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,890
Oh my god, okay, I'm gonna show you guys.

140
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,910
This is actually fucking crazy.

141
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,950
I got... I was...

142
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,510
I was so happy.

143
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,150
Hahahahaha!

144
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,350
Oh, oh yeah!

145
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,170
By the way, I also spent money...

146
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,910
Um... I also...

147
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,410
I spent money... Yes.

148
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,410
Yeah.

149
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,510
Hahahahaha!

150
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,710
I'm Ninja.

151
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,190
Ninja was in the store.

152
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:09,930
Um...

153
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:10,950
Hahahahaha!

154
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,810
Ninja was in the store!

155
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,050
I bought the Ninja.

156
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,570
I bought the Ninja.

157
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,230
Yeah, look at my sweet Jordans!

158
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,270
Okay, so like...

159
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,450
So you can have shoes now.

160
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,750
You get shoes, and then...

161
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,030
You can't get Godzilla yet, but like...

162
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,310
Okay, but like...

163
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:31,850
Hahahahaha!

164
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,670
Okay...

165
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,390
But...

166
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,850
Okay, so basically...

167
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,530
Basically...

168
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,870
Frieza can wear...

169
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,950
Um... Frieza can wear Jordans now.

170
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,890
And...

171
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,310
Look at his dress!

172
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,390
Look at it!

173
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,850
I also bought...

174
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,170
I bought the Snoop walk.

175
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,910
I bought a Snoop walk.

176
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,250
Hahahahaha!

177
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,110
Frieza with the Jordans.

178
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,870
Yeah, so like...

179
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,090
Um... I got really excited, and then...

180
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,950
I literally forgot to use my creator code.

181
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,570
Okay, so by the way, guys...

182
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,490
You guys didn't know.

183
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,490
I...

184
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,250
Oh my god, I have Catwoman.

185
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,110
I have a supportive creator code.

186
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,750
So you can use like... You can just put Doki Bird.

187
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,070
And then like, um...

188
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,090
Basically, if you're going to buy skins anyway, I get like a little percentage off of it.

189
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,650
So like, that's basically it.

190
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,850
And then, um...

191
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,790
And...

192
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,830
And this is where my super... No!

193
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,210
John!

194
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,050
No, it goes to other things too!

195
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,130
John, I only use the super chat money from people who like...

196
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,710
Super chat me specifically for Fortnite skins.

197
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,450
Hahahahaha!

198
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,010
And it's a very high percentage.

199
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,870
Um, it doesn't work with my super chat money because this would be the last one.

200
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,750
Your super chat money is diverted to a different cat...

201
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,110
To a different area.

202
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,130
I have people that specifically super chat me just for Fortnite cosmetics and Fortnite outfits.

203
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,970
It's a Fortnite cosmetic fund.

204
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,970
Anyway, so like...

205
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,110
I was so excited.

206
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,810
Yeah, CC!

207
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,930
It's not you, John.

208
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,690
It's not your money.

209
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,770
It's Alan's money.

210
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,110
Super chat to Navel Doki.

211
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,070
Thank you for the super chat.

212
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,970
Thank you, thank you.

213
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,990
So like, basically...

214
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,390
Um, I was so excited that I forgot to use my code.

215
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,770
And I just gave them...

216
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,930
I gave Fortnite like $60 for free.

217
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,090
Oh my god, I...

218
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,830
Look at this.

219
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,250
She's a baddie.

220
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,730
He's a baddie, guys.

221
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,310
Whoa!

222
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,230
He's a fucking baddie.

223
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,930
He's a freaking bad... Okay.

224
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,230
And then...

225
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,850
Stop sharking!

226
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,730
Thank you for the magenta soup fund.

227
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,590
Thank you, thank you.

228
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,990
For the Fortnite cosmetic fund.

229
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,190
Thank you, thank you.

230
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,970
50 eagle bills to get more stuff.

231
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,450
Mr. Sand, thank you for the magenta soup fund.

232
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,450
Thank you, thank you.

233
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,470
Brown, thank you for the aqua soup fund.

234
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,610
Thank you, thank you.

235
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,270
Super chat for Fortnite cosmetics.

236
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,050
Thank you for the aqua...

237
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,730
See, John?

238
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,170
It's not your fund.

239
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,030
It's not your fund.

240
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,910
I have enablers.

241
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,670
I have other enablers in my chat.

242
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,450
Maxis, thank you for the...

243
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,050
For the very first super chat to enable me.

244
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,770
Look, ma, I'm an enabler.

245
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,890
See you guys.

246
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,930
Okay, so like...

247
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,550
Oh my god, I have Ariana.

248
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,950
So these are the Jordans.

249
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,010
These are the shoes.

250
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,010
You can get your kicks.

251
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,990
I bought this one because I thought it looked...

252
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,930
Because I'm waiting for Godzilla, basically.

253
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm...

254
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,730
Oh my god, did it refresh?

255
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,210
Oh my god, did it refresh?

256
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,990
Did it just refresh?

257
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,370
Oh my god, did it... Okay, it's at 4.

258
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,810
Okay, nevermind.

259
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,310
Okay, I was like, what happened?

260
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,350
So I'm waiting for Godzilla.

261
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,770
Godzilla is gonna release in January.

262
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,330
And then when Godzilla releases, I can have...

263
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,390
I can put these shoes on him.

264
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,410
I can put...

265
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,510
That's...

266
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,390
That's why I bought these shoes.

267
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,450
I was like, this is the perfect Godzilla shoes.

268
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,290
Right there.

269
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,030
And then there's like...

270
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,790
Apparently like this...

271
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,310
The theme for chapter 6 is Japan themed.

272
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,970
Because there's a lot of like...

273
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,230
The new map itself has like...

274
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,290
New locations where you're fighting like...

275
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:01,930
Demons and stuff.

276
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,930
Which looks really cool.

277
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,330
I was playing with Surefour, Gully, and Mr. Cow.

278
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,670
We call him Ben.

279
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:09,530
And...

280
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,430
Oh yeah, by the way, I finally talked to Moonmoon.

281
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,170
We finally...

282
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,950
You know, like 5 degrees of...

283
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,370
Like 6 degrees of Moonmoon.

284
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,490
Like, now we actually got...

285
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,270
We actually talked to Moonmoon that day.

286
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,370
We actually talked to him that day.

287
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:28,850
We actually talked to him that day.

288
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,230
But basically...

289
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,310
We kept dying to Ice Spice.

290
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,310
A lot.

291
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,770
While we were playing.

292
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,090
Ice Spice is fucking crazy.

293
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,550
She's wild.

294
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,530
She's a baddie.

295
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,710
She actually is a baddie.

296
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,070
We kept dying to her.

297
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,350
And she had a sword, guys.

298
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,390
Okay, wait.

299
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,210
Let me give you guys a clip.

300
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,410
It's so funny.

301
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,830
I love the clip.

302
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,130
It's so good.

303
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,430
No, I can't get my...

304
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,630
I can't get my Discord.

305
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,890
Let me show you guys the clip.

306
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,290
Actually, I love this clip.

307
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,210
She's a baddie.

308
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,450
There we go.

309
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,910
This is...

310
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,490
This is what happened to us.

311
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,910
So, there's a lot of...

312
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,910
Oh, and I got this too.

313
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,550
This is like the Zoomer YMCA now.

314
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,270
I got that as well.

315
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,050
And then...

316
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,030
Oh my god, it's the chicken!

317
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,190
It's...

318
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,350
Oh my god, they have Arrested Development!

319
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,670
Oh my god, go Freeza.

320
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,110
Go.

321
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,130
Oh my god.

322
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,870
Go style.

323
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,650
Also, you can get cars now.

324
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,150
So, there's a lot of...

325
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,810
Oh my god, watch this.

326
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,410
I think this is my favorite from Snoop Dogg.

327
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,210
Guys, I have a problem.

328
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,350
Guys, the one thing I'm really sad about...

329
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,150
is that...

330
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,110
Goku can't wear shoes.

331
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,410
Like, he can't wear the kicks.

332
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,130
So, that's what I'm like...

333
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,710
really sad about.

334
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,190
One of my favorite parts about Snoop Dogg...

335
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,350
the Snoop Dogg skin...

336
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,210
is that...

337
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,910
I can turn into a real dog.

338
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,030
Look at that.

339
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,220
I can turn into a real dog.

340
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,760
Look at him go.

341
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,260
He's already...

342
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,980
Look at that.

343
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,900
Oh yeah, and he's wearing my...

344
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,360
He's wearing the kicks right there.

345
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,540
Yeah.

346
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,620
Isn't it great?

347
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,720
Also, I have this one.

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,820
Which one is it?

349
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,780
Slim Sheik.

350
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,060
With the dog.

351
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,980
He got that dog in him.

352
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,840
This is a good reason...

353
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,400
that I'm your Oshi.

354
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,900
Ninja was in the store and I had to get him.

355
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,520
I also got Mr. Beast before all that stuff happened.

356
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
But I think it's still funny.

357
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,300
It's still a little funny though.

358
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,660
When you're like...

359
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,500
putting Mr. Beast after.

360
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,700
Now you're just evil.

361
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,800
I think it's even funnier...

362
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,580
now to die by...

363
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,600
Mr. Beast in Fortnite.

364
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,280
So...

365
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,000
So...

366
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,500
I got John Cena.

367
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,700
I have...

368
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,000
Peter Griffin.

369
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,620
I have Mr. Beast.

370
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,100
I...

371
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
Guys, I have a problem.

372
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,740
Every time I...

373
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,620
come back to Fortnite.

374
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,820
Another thing I love about Eminem...

375
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,280
is when you have him...

376
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,920
do the Slim Shady song.

377
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,880
He actually...

378
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,400
sings the lyrics too.

379
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,600
Please stand up.

380
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,840
Please stand up.

381
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,540
And then...

382
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,200
Guys, all I'm saying is that...

383
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,960
Fortnite is literally the...

384
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,180
It's literally one of the only games...

385
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,220
I actually spend cosmetics on.

386
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,280
Because like...

387
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
it's just so funny.

388
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,960
I don't know.

389
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,520
I just really enjoy...

390
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,180
I just really enjoy spending it on...

391
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,320
Fortnite skins.

392
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,420
Because I think it's just really funny.

393
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,460
It's just...

394
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,920
That's everything.

395
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,660
I could be Godzilla with Jordans.

396
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,360
I mean...

397
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,920
Anyway...

398
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,740
Since this is a sponsored stream, thank you again to Fortnite...

399
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,720
for sponsoring.

400
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,220
I'm sorry to my editor...

401
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,800
that has to censor...

402
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,980
all the third party stuff later.

403
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
Sadly, I cannot...

404
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,780
I won't be playing as...

405
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,240
Alright, let's see.

406
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,700
I'll be Candy Cane Man.

407
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,920
Mr. Dapper.

408
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,980
Mr. Dapper Man.

409
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,860
I'll be Mr. Dapper Man.

410
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,280
So...

411
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,420
They brought back OG Fortnite.

412
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,160
I think it's...

413
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,180
Which one is it?

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,940
OG Fortnite, guys?

415
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
Is it class...

416
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
Zero Beld Battle Royale.

417
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,960
Is it this one?

418
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,900
It's not out yet?

419
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,760
No, I played OG Fortnite.

420
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,680
Wait, what did I play yesterday...

421
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,280
Sure for.

422
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,560
What did I play?

423
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,900
Oh, is it Reload?

424
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,120
I think it was Reload.

425
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,060
Yeah, it was Reload.

426
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, no, it was.

427
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,900
Okay, we're a new duo.

428
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
I need to get carried.

429
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,400
I was like, there's no way it was.

430
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,800
Reload is like, OG.

431
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,440
Yeah, so they brought back...

432
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,920
They brought back, um, the original Fortnite.

433
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,800
I never got a chance to play the original Fortnite, but, um, I never got a chance to play the original Fortnite.

434
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,780
And, uh, um, but I heard they made all the guns hitscan now.

435
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,580
So, um, almost all the guns.

436
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,760
It's all the guns, but, you know, I don't, I don't want, I cannot do build mode.

437
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm so bad with build mode.

438
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,300
Like, I'm actually, I'm so bad with build mode.

439
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:59,180
It's actually, like, I would, I'd build one thing and then a child will build a fucking, sorry, a child, sorry to my editor, that's gonna have to start censoring me.

440
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,180
Um, a child will build a freaking apartment next to me and then I die.

441
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,880
So, like, I got eliminated.

442
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,720
So, um, I gotta remember, like, cause it's sponsored now.

443
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,920
And like, but the thing is, the best thing about it being a stream, because the sponsored portion is the video that's going to come from the stream.

444
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,040
I can say all these things, but then I'm making my editor have a harder time.

445
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,620
I forgot to take my backpack off!

446
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,360
Editor, can you censor the backpack?

447
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,020
Can you censor the backpack if you can?

448
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,220
I'm so sorry, editor.

449
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,000
Look, I'm moving around too, so it'll be easier.

450
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,240
It'll be so much easier.

451
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,780
I'm gonna move around, Mr. Editor, so you can be a poor editor.

452
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,560
Anyway, um, wait, is that Juice WRLD?

453
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,300
Oh my god, do I have Juice WRLD as my duo?

454
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,900
Oh my god, just put one main block.

455
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,500
It said move, just blur like 80% of the game.

456
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,620
Oh my god, I knew you'd be back.

457
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,040
Where's Juice WRLD in the drop?

458
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,820
Okay, so this is, oh, there's Tilted Towers.

459
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,060
We gotta go back to Tilted Towers.

460
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh, I forgot to unequip that too.

461
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,000
Uh, I forgot.

462
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

463
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,240
I forgot to unequip.

464
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,720
Oh, can you block this out too, editor?

465
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,020
It's gonna be okay, but can you also block the Shedron as well for me?

466
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,660
I really appreciate it.

467
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,380
It would be so easy if you could.

468
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,320
All right, nothing bad's gonna happen, right?

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,820
Yeah, just have my audio clip on and then you play Fortnite, Mr. Editor.

470
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,380
That's just have- get the audio clip on from this game and then you play Fortnite and then sync it up.

471
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,240
And then I think that would be easier, honestly.

472
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:29,720
That would- That would be- I honestly think that would actually be easier to do versus the shit I'm making you- Editor, just delete the pod.

473
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,900
Oh my god.

474
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,220
Oh, Juice WRLD is not coming back for me.

475
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,520
Oh, Juice WRLD.

476
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,140
Oh, guys, I'm fucking- I'm freaking dead.

477
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,820
Oh my god.

478
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,240
Oh, that's another Juice WRLD!

479
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Guys, I don't think- I don't think- I don't think Juice WRLD is coming back for me.

480
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,780
It's okay, I can- Oh, I can respawn.

481
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,280
I forgot.

482
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,120
This is reloaded.

483
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,460
Alright, Juice WRLD, I'm back.

484
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,100
Okay, Editor, make sure you censor every third-party IP I mention, Editor.

485
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,000
Just make sure I do that as well.

486
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,680
Make sure every time I mention a third-party entity, you also, like, censor the sound of that so it'll be like, hey, beep!

487
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,220
And then-

488
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,860
Like, it'll be that easy, Editor.

489
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,760
I believe in you.

490
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,740
I believe in you when you make this video.

491
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,760
It won't- It's not that difficult, trust me.

492
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,180
It'll be okay.

493
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,680
I believe- You guys believe in him?

494
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,540
I believe in him.

495
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,440
Editor, delete the vid.

496
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,160
They quit it.

497
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,160
You just lost yourself, Editor.

498
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,780
Wait, what?

499
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,940
Oh my god, that's just- That's just Juice WRLD.

500
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,540
Sorry, that's- Beep!

501
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,940
Beep!

502
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,320
What a great two-minute video, Editor.

503
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,200
Censored Jordans.

504
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,100
What's this?

505
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,140
Oh, hammer assault.

506
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Okay, I have two of these.

507
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,820
Okay, somebody reloaded over there.

508
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,680
Just start referring yourself in the third person, Potato.

509
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,280
Thank you for the super chat.

510
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,300
Thank you, thank you.

511
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, I am a little laggy.

512
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,480
Let me, like, fix that later.

513
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,100
Or, like, now, actually.

514
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,340
Is there somebody over there?

515
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,080
It's over there.

516
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,820
All right.

517
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,180
Okay, Editor, if you see a third-party IP, if I'm shooting a third part, just censor them.

518
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,580
Just, like, give them, like, a pixelated sensor so, like, they won't know what it is.

519
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,700
Like-

520
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,540
It's okay.

521
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,050
Oh my god, they're so tiny.

522
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,570
What?

523
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,340
Where are they?

524
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,040
Whoa!

525
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,950
Oh my god.

526
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,630
No!

527
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,250
No!

528
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,170
I hit the hundred!

529
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,070
No, Juice WRLD!

530
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,970
I'm dead!

531
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,670
Juice... Juice WRLD!

532
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,570
Juice WRLD!

533
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,470
Sorry, beep!

534
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,130
Juice WRLD, I swear.

535
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,970
I swear to god.

536
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,530
I'm freaking flying.

537
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,470
Goodbye.

538
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,730
Oh, yeah, make sure to make this, like, super pixelated, too, when I'm flying down.

539
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,810
So, like, they won't know.

540
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,370
Don't worry, it's fine.

541
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,670
It'll be fine.

542
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,610
See?

543
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,510
He's gonna reboot in seven seconds.

544
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,750
You're not making it.

545
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,770
Also, remember to pixelate Fender, too.

546
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,050
Like, just remember, just-

547
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,010
Beep, WRLD.

548
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,250
There you go.

549
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,590
It's gonna work, guys.

550
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,810
It's gonna work, trust me.

551
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,650
It's gonna look like- It's gonna be a great video, guys.

552
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,190
Where is this guy?

553
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,710
He's shooting.

554
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,420
I'm just gonna run up.

555
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,220
There we go.

556
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,160
Anti-Andrew.

557
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,200
All right, nice.

558
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:27,360
That's good that he has, like, an actual- What did I do wrong?

559
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,980
I don't understand!

560
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,500
What did I do wrong?

561
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

562
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm just doing my job.

563
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,200
Okay, I need to grab- Is he okay?

564
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,100
Is Juice WRLD okay?

565
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,980
Sorry, is Beep WRLD okay?

566
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
He'll be fine.

567
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,480
What is this gun?

568
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,600
This is a pump shotgun.

569
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,540
All right.

570
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,080
I feel bad.

571
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,160
What?

572
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,600
What did I do wrong?

573
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,820
Oh, yeah, he's dead.

574
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,880
He's eliminated.

575
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,450
He's not?

576
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,560
Wait, is this a PAP pistol?

577
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,160
Yes, okay.

578
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,180
Oh, what the fuck?

579
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,340
What the frick?

580
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,740
That's- That's right.

581
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,780
Wait, actually, it might be easier for you to just censor him every time, I swear.

582
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,220
That might be easier for me, actually.

583
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,460
Oh, no, Juice WRLD, no.

584
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,220
Juice WRLD, no.

585
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,160
Juice WRLD, no.

586
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,540
Just live.

587
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,160
All right, just- just- just put, like, beeps in there if I start swearing.

588
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Like, it might be easier for both of us.

589
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,560
Just think about it.

590
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Wait.

591
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,160
Sorry, I was choking on my own saliva because I'm not a real person.

592
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,720
Um, I can't function in society.

593
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,580
Okay.

594
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,740
Oh, hey, that's purple.

595
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,980
Wait, is that the same one?

596
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,400
Wait.

597
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,220
Wait, this is better.

598
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,690
This is better.

599
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,050
Beep WRLD, get over here.

600
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,780
Don't you love it when your VTuber's not real?

601
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,410
All right.

602
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,330
Where are they?

603
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,070
I feel like I need to lower the graphics quality.

604
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,710
Just so I don't lag.

605
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,250
Oh, this was all pre-recorded.

606
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,110
What if I was, like, government?

607
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,690
No, I shouldn't say that because some people might actually start freaking out.

608
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:10,930
But I'm gonna say, what if I was a government plant, just so I can harvest your data?

609
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,290
Anyway, make sure to not put that in the Fortnite VOD.

610
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,950
Make sure you don't put that in the Fortnite video.

611
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,570
I don't think that should be in it.

612
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,070
Yeah, I'm a psycops.

613
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,790
Yeah.

614
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,580
Where the heck are the people?

615
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,500
Nobody's, like, making noises.

616
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,280
Hello?

617
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,490
Oh, they're right below me.

618
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,880
That's what I like about the sponsor being a video.

619
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,340
I can say anything I want right now.

620
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,540
And then my editor.

621
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,540
I feel bad for my editor, but like...

622
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,260
But we can do this, editor.

623
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,920
We can work together.

624
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,800
We can... we can work together, editor.

625
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,340
Together!

626
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,420
It'll be fine.

627
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
We'll be so fine.

628
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,680
Wait, somebody is...

629
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm looking below us, because... oh, there... there he is.

630
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,640
Oh my god.

631
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,040
What?!

632
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,840
That should have hit!

633
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,040
My crosshair was definitely on that!

634
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,420
My crosshair was on that, like, 100%.

635
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,340
I was on the target.

636
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,220
Like, he's in there.

637
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,640
Oh, no.

638
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,260
I'm like, wait.

639
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,100
How do I get down?

640
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,340
Watch this.

641
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,320
Okay, I'll take those.

642
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,640
I'll take it.

643
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,440
That's fine.

644
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,920
I... it's, you know, it's just a little damage.

645
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,960
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

646
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,140
Thank you, thank you.

647
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,940
Take more money from my favorite government agent.

648
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,140
That's okay, editor.

649
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,420
Make sure to cut that out.

650
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,540
Cut that out.

651
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,640
From the actual video.

652
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,980
What?

653
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,520
Is something gonna self-destruct?

654
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,900
What?

655
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,540
What's that?

656
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,740
Oh, oh, I don't... I can't read.

657
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,420
Oh, oh, no.

658
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, no, Juice WRLD.

659
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Juice WRLD, you only have one life, Juice WRLD!

660
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,120
Juice WRLD, no!

661
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,660
That's right, Juice WRLD.

662
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,560
Oh, he doesn't know.

663
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,460
Eliminated.

664
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,200
All right, yoink.

665
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,820
The only issue is that nobody has, like, heals.

666
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,900
Nobody has shields right now.

667
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,460
That's my only problem.

668
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,500
Yeah, there's no sh... oh, there's only mini shields.

669
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,540
Oh.

670
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,800
Wait, when did you die?

671
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,540
I was not paying attention.

672
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,840
Sorry, BeepWRLD, when did you die?

673
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,440
Oh my god.

674
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,920
Oh, I didn't expect that.

675
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,380
That's right.

676
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,140
No, that's not right!

677
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,660
BeepWRLD!

678
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,220
BeepWRLD!

679
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,240
Wait, where did he...

680
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,700
Editor, don't put this in.

681
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,560
You fucker!

682
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh my god, you... you went for the gear package?

683
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,950
Bro, bro is gone of my life.

684
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,590
And he's gone.

685
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,130
It was so... oh my god.

686
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,830
Bro!

687
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,610
You actually... bro, I made such a sick play, too.

688
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,170
I made such a frickin' sick play.

689
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,630
And he...

690
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,490
trusted BeepWRLD.

691
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,470
No, do not put that in.

692
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,190
Zekra, thank you for the super chat.

693
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,010
Thank you, thank you.

694
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,230
What do you mean I don't blame him?

695
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,210
I did so well.

696
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,410
I actually was gaming there.

697
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,430
I...

698
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,490
I was gaming.

699
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,710
All right.

700
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,290
OG Fortnite's map is so small.

701
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,150
I never realized how small the map is.

702
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,590
Um...

703
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,110
Now we can raise the game volume.

704
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,730
Okay, game volume has been raised.

705
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,680
Not OG.

706
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,500
I just noticed... I saw Tilted Tower, so I thought it was the OG map.

707
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,920
Because there was no Tomato Town.

708
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,720
What?!

709
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,560
I hope you... you get eliminated.

710
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,680
Okay, every time... Editor, every time I say die, I...

711
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,380
That's so embarrassing.

712
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,100
Okay, I'm gonna give you some words that you can substitute in.

713
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,800
So, like, every time I say die...

714
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,560
Put...

715
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,480
eliminated.

716
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,760
Eliminated.

717
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,180
Eliminated.

718
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,560
Eliminated.

719
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,960
Eliminated.

720
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,140
All right, there.

721
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,400
I gave you some... I gave you... I, like, gave you some words.

722
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,280
So, like, you can sub in...

723
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,160
Eliminated every time I say die.

724
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,340
So, like, now you can just sub it.

725
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,740
So, and then, like, so if I keep saying eliminated...

726
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,100
I say so many different tones of eliminated.

727
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,780
That, like, it does... it will sound natural.

728
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,320
It's gonna sound super natural.

729
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,560
If you sub in the kill...

730
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,980
for eliminated, it'll sound so good.

731
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,540
Okay, let me get the... let me get Bender out of here.

732
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,800
What is... all right.

733
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,480
We'll put this one on and then let's get... let's get Shenron out of the way.

734
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,020
That's theirs, right?

735
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,940
That's... all right.

736
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,720
Well, it looks cool.

737
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
Oh, I like this one.

738
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,360
That's cute.

739
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,700
Please use a croquis.

740
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,240
Ah!

741
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,960
For your censored memes.

742
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,200
Thank you for the super chat.

743
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,720
Thank you.

744
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,680
Thank you.

745
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,640
Zeon.

746
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,040
All right, and let's get rid of this and then we'll do... oh, that's cool.

747
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,900
I like that.

748
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,500
Wait, no, this is cool.

749
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:31,900
Wait.

750
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,140
Oh, wait, the jetpack.

751
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,860
Actually, I want to do... I want this one.

752
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,100
All right, there we go.

753
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,120
We should be good now.

754
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,780
We should be good.

755
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,120
Wait, is that also family guy?

756
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,580
Oh, no.

757
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,160
Wait, that's family guy?

758
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,860
What is it?

759
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,220
May leave a stain.

760
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,920
No, it's art of... no, it's not.

761
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,720
There's no way.

762
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,080
That's not.

763
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,680
Wait, is that family guy?

764
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,420
The backpack?

765
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,280
No, that's not.

766
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,420
That's...

767
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,040
That's the llama.

768
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,620
No, that's Fortnite.

769
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,060
All right, the copyright.

770
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,020
Yeah, there you go.

771
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,860
We're good.

772
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,180
We're good.

773
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,400
All right, let's go.

774
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,500
We're so good now.

775
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,060
Wait, I want to go to the new map.

776
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,000
Let's do the new map.

777
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,100
It should be this.

778
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,720
Zero build.

779
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,620
Solo.

780
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,600
Oh, wait, no.

781
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,500
You know what?

782
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,180
Let's do solo.

783
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,880
We can do solo.

784
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,680
You haven't said...

785
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:28,680
eliminated!

786
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,320
Eliminated!

787
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,000
Eliminated!

788
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,500
Eliminated.

789
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,020
There we go.

790
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,840
That should be enough, right, for my editor?

791
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,140
That should...

792
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,640
That should...

793
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,520
Guys, do you think that's enough of a...

794
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,800
Do you guys think that's enough of a...

795
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,080
Audio... audio jungle for...

796
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,240
For my editor to use?

797
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,740
For the vibe?

798
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,780
Do you think...

799
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,860
It's...

800
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,360
It's... That should be fine, right?

801
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,400
Yeah, I think so.

802
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,140
Um...

803
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,280
That should be fine.

804
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
Anyway, guys, we can... I believe in us.

805
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,840
I definitely believe in us, guys.

806
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,460
No, he'll be fine.

807
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,320
He'll be fine.

808
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,940
He's not gonna quit.

809
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,500
This is the only thing that's not...

810
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,500
We have... This is why I'm stream... I'm gonna do a...

811
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,220
At least two hours.

812
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,540
Oh, I should... Let me...

813
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,860
Reset my graphics real fast.

814
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,920
Uh...

815
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,140
Low screen.

816
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,420
Um, I gotta make sure...

817
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,700
I'll do low.

818
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,980
I'm gonna do low graphics, so...

819
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,640
Hello?

820
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Okay, there we go.

821
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,140
I'm gonna do low so, like, I don't lag too much.

822
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,040
And then... There we go.

823
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,560
Oh, there we go.

824
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,500
We should be fine, right?

825
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,840
Yeah, everything feels...

826
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,860
Everything will be okay.

827
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
Don't worry.

828
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,760
Everything will be okay, guys.

829
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,700
I'll do 200.

830
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,600
Maybe that'll be better.

831
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,800
Uh...

832
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,180
Uh...

833
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,020
There you go.

834
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,540
All right.

835
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,980
So, like, they have this new area.

836
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,040
This area there, which is, like, they're, like, mini boss fights.

837
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,880
Help, this is Doki's editor from the future.

838
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,960
I forgot to keep something out and the feds got me more Doki before it's...

839
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,420
Thank you for the super chat burrito.

840
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,120
Thank you.

841
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,960
Thank you.

842
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
All right, there you go.

843
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,120
So...

844
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,300
This is one of the new areas.

845
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,660
I just saw this area before when I was, like, um...

846
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,240
When I was playing with Surefour and it's actually really crazy because it's basically a...

847
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,300
A mini boss fight.

848
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,900
So, oh my god.

849
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,560
Well, like, let's hope that maybe... Guys, do you think we... They'll want to work together?

850
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:10,260
Guys, do you think, like, these people are open to, you know, working together to kill the boss together?

851
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,320
Do you think they'll be okay with that?

852
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,520
This is a shotgun.

853
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,440
This is bad.

854
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,700
I only have a shotgun.

855
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:30,660
You guys think they would want to work together and we can be, like, you know, friends?

856
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,180
Oh...

857
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,260
Okay, that's...

858
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,980
That's the evil guy.

859
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,800
So, these are, like, evil things that can give you shields and stuff.

860
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,900
Guys, will we be fine?

861
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,420
Nice.

862
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,500
Eliminated.

863
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,260
See, at the end of the day, you don't have to...

864
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,020
Look at that.

865
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,160
And then...

866
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,220
I'm helping.

867
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,480
Oh my god.

868
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,200
No!

869
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,420
They slid in!

870
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,160
Oh, they got a point on me!

871
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,960
Guys, I don't know if I'm, like, cut out for a solo.

872
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,380
No, I don't know if I'm cut out.

873
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Oh my god.

874
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,480
These guys, these children are so much better than me.

875
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,380
These children...

876
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,240
I just want to... I just want to run on the walls.

877
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,080
Let me run.

878
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,300
Let me run.

879
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,480
Why don't they want me to cooperate with me?

880
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,000
Why won't they cooperate with me?

881
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,580
We're a team!

882
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,860
I don't understand.

883
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,260
I thought we were a team.

884
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,280
I don't understand.

885
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,620
Don't we want to do a boss fight together, teammates?

886
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:11,820
All right.

887
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,400
Yeah, don't worry.

888
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,980
I got you.

889
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,920
But still crazy.

890
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,120
It's so crazy to be sponsored by Fortnite because I play this game regardless if I'm sponsored or not.

891
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,860
And it's a bonus now.

892
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Now I got... now I get paid to play a game that I was gonna play anyway, so...

893
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,300
I'm spending money on Fortnite anyway.

894
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,040
I have so many emotes.

895
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:42,200
I have a problem, guys.

896
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,800
I have... I definitely have a problem.

897
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,980
Like, I paid for these.

898
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,880
This is how they get me.

899
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,660
The V-Bucks.

900
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
They know what I want.

901
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,900
Honestly, if they wanted to pay me in V-Bucks, I'd say yes.

902
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,360
I...

903
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,620
I would 100% say yes if they paid me in V-Bucks because then I don't have to go through the hassle of...

904
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:17,640
I don't have to go through the hassle of, like, connecting my PayPal and then logging into my PayPal to buy me...

905
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,540
to buy me V-Bucks.

906
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:26,360
I can just... if they just put V-Bucks into my account, like, the amount of money they paid me for the sponsored, I'd be happy.

907
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,680
And then... and then I could use, like...

908
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,780
I could... it's like an unlimited... it's like an unlimited money glitch because if they...

909
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:51,380
if they pay me in V-Bucks, I can then use those V-Bucks and then use my creator code and then I get paid back for using my own creator code to buy myself...

910
00:43:52,300 --> 00:44:08,300
to buy myself some Fortnite cosmetics and then I get from the money I get from using my own V-Bucks, uh, that was given to me by Epic, I can use it to buy more Fortnite cosmetics.

911
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,420
Anyway,

912
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,580
don't put this in.

913
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,140
Um, they might know my plan.

914
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,740
Don't put this in.

915
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,420
It's okay, just don't put it in.

916
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,680
The infinite Fortnite... yeah, exactly.

917
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,560
The infinite Fortnite money glitch.

918
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,100
Exactly.

919
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,200
It's just that easy.

920
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,620
I think my favorite though is the fact that it, uh, talked to... oh my god.

921
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,360
Um, thank you for your very first super chat, Arby!

922
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,580
Thank you, thank you.

923
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,260
He's like, I'll do a sponsorship, buy a list of emotes.

924
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,120
I'm going to need Epic.

925
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,820
Thank you for your very first super chat.

926
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,260
Oh my god.

927
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,560
Oh, okay, guys, you can be in the demons dojo.

928
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,200
Guys, I didn't know you guys liked that place that much.

929
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,360
That's fine.

930
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,760
I'll just walk away.

931
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
That's okay.

932
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,840
You can... I'll just walk away.

933
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,460
It's all right.

934
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,280
Oh, it's not okay!

935
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,380
Who killed me?

936
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,760
That's for killing me while I'm trying to do sponsored content.

937
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,840
That's...

938
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,400
Report me.

939
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,460
That's true.

940
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,120
I'm trying to... I'm trying to explore the map.

941
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,360
All right, guys, we're gonna go do duo now because I don't think I'm gonna survive.

942
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,520
I really don't think I'm gonna survive, guys.

943
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,290
How is that more skilled?

944
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,270
He was in the bush!

945
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,550
Also, don't put that in as well, guys, because we want to make sure I'm not toxic.

946
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,390
I'm not a toxic gamer in the video.

947
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:16,170
So make sure to remove anything where I am a little toxic.

948
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,690
And then, like, if I say something toxic, just be like...

949
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,250
Okay, I'm gonna give you some sound clips, editor.

950
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,290
You're a great person.

951
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,750
Good job!

952
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,930
Oh my god, you should be a professional gamer!

953
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,790
Wait, that sounds really sarcastic.

954
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,670
You should really be professional.

955
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,810
Are you a professional?

956
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,330
Nice shot!

957
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:44,170
So, like, you know, if I say something really bad, just put that in and...

958
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,210
Just put that sound clip in there.

959
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,710
So I'll be like...

960
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,170
You hear the... You get the audio, right?

961
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,070
So, like, nice shot!

962
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,170
Oh my god, you're so good!

963
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,070
Wow!

964
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,710
Wait, oh, sorry.

965
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,850
I didn't remove the sarcasm.

966
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,790
That's a really nice shot.

967
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,190
Oh my god, are you a pro?

968
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,010
It's okay.

969
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,690
He'll understand.

970
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,450
Editor will understand.

971
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:19,770
Nice shot, bro!

972
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,550
Wait, is that still sarcastic?

973
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,270
Sorry, it's, like, second nature to me.

974
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,890
How do you not be sarcastic?

975
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,130
Yo, nice shot, man!

976
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:28,970
Bro!

977
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,230
Bro, you work out?

978
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,590
Are you a gamer, bro?

979
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,030
Hey, editor.

980
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,070
This is the funding for your work.

981
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:43,970
Thanks.

982
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,110
Thank you for the super chat.

983
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,450
Thank you, thank you.

984
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,410
Wow!

985
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,130
I definitely got outplayed there.

986
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,930
Oh my god.

987
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,290
Are you 13?

988
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,410
Because, damn.

989
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,390
That's a Fortnite gamer.

990
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,290
No, I shouldn't put that in.

991
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,470
That's actually really bad.

992
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,530
I'm just trying to imply that, like, young kids are really good at Fortnite.

993
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,030
That's...

994
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:11,690
That's...

995
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:17,570
You know, like, what was that kid's name that won a million dollars from Fortnite?

996
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,550
That shit was crazy.

997
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,750
Yeah, cut that one out.

998
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,410
I'm just saying that, like, those kids have, like, Fortnite reflexes.

999
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,190
Wait, is there no one here?

1000
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,090
Oh, I can move faster now.

1001
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,610
I'm scared.

1002
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,960
Wait, is he doing the boss fight?

1003
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,020
Bro, why are you doing the boss fight?

1004
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:45,460
Oh, yeah.

1005
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,220
This is what the boss fight looks like.

1006
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,260
That... it's so cool.

1007
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,540
Where is she?

1008
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,280
Yeah, she has a gun.

1009
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,600
I'm shooting her.

1010
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,660
Frosty, I need you to help.

1011
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,380
Oh!

1012
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,260
Okay.

1013
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,160
Frosty, Frosty, where is he?

1014
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,210
That's fine.

1015
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,970
I'm stuck.

1016
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,270
Frosty, I'm stuck!

1017
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,590
Okay, nice.

1018
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:16,750
The night rose.

1019
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,770
And then, like, he's gonna pick her up.

1020
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,110
And you gotta shoot the eye.

1021
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,770
Oh, damn.

1022
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,910
Can I shoot from the back?

1023
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:26,270
Oh.

1024
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,010
And then, you gotta shoot her from here.

1025
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:31,850
No!

1026
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,250
She can't escape!

1027
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,550
Okay, bro.

1028
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,410
Frosty, I can't shoot at him!

1029
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,090
Oh, I can.

1030
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:40,830
Never mind.

1031
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:41,730
I can shoot the back.

1032
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,090
I didn't realize that.

1033
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:46,950
Fine, Frosty.

1034
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:47,590
I'm helping.

1035
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:50,930
Shoot her!

1036
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,090
Nice, we did it.

1037
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,790
Yoink.

1038
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,630
Here, I gave you the mask.

1039
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,850
Oh, you don't want that mask, Frosty?

1040
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:08,890
You don't want it?

1041
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,810
I'll take it.

1042
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,170
Yoink.

1043
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,790
What's this?

1044
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:13,850
Oh, no!

1045
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,230
This one's really cool.

1046
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,230
This one's really cool.

1047
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,190
Yeah, I'll grab a shotgun, too.

1048
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:19,450
Oh, my god.

1049
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,050
I can be a bush.

1050
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:20,470
Never mind.

1051
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,190
I'll get the bush.

1052
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,010
Wait.

1053
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:22,670
Yeah, okay.

1054
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:23,450
So, watch this.

1055
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,350
And then, I do that.

1056
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,190
And then, I go...

1057
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,150
Oh, wait.

1058
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,030
And then, I go...

1059
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:33,670
That's what happens.

1060
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,250
It's a portal.

1061
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,070
I think it's really cool because it's a portal.

1062
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,190
To air a while next to a wall to kick off of.

1063
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:42,530
Oh, wait.

1064
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,590
I need to... I want to get the care package.

1065
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,840
All right, we should get a care package now.

1066
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,580
Yeah, it's like a little portal thing.

1067
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:58,160
I was watching people, like, do this thing where you can res people with it, which I thought was really cool.

1068
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,160
Wait, I hear... I hear a chest.

1069
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:02,840
Nice.

1070
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,580
Oh, nice.

1071
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,120
More bushes.

1072
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,180
This is my favorite bomb because I can put...

1073
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,480
It's not suspicious at all.

1074
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,540
This... This bush in my...

1075
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,280
Is this a shotgun?

1076
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:18,620
Okay.

1077
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,120
This bush in my... In the concrete?

1078
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,020
Not suspicious at all.

1079
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,120
What are you talking about?

1080
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,940
Team... Yeah, we're gonna plant trees.

1081
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,220
I'm not Mr. Beast, so, like, you know I'm doing it for a good cause.

1082
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,220
Cut that edit.

1083
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,680
Make sure you don't put that in.

1084
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:45,220
Like, you're just gonna, like... You're gonna get to the beginning of it, and then we just suddenly cut to the end of this game.

1085
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,060
And they'll never... We'll cut to the end of the game.

1086
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,200
All right, nice.

1087
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,000
What gun is this?

1088
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,160
This is a assault rifle.

1089
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:00,720
Okay.

1090
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:07,730
What even is going into the video?

1091
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,010
New content!

1092
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:14,170
So, like, you guys... Okay, anyway, get this audio clip of me explaining about...

1093
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:19,970
Okay, so I'm gonna talk about the... I'll talk about the cool-ass demon girl we just fought.

1094
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,550
And then you're gonna put that audio on top of the part here.

1095
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,370
On the top of the part where I talked about Mr. Beast.

1096
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,390
So, like, they won't know.

1097
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,870
It's gonna sound so natural.

1098
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:36,110
And then, I know, like, the mouth movement is not gonna be the same.

1099
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,030
But, like, we can, like...

1100
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,070
Um, we can... We can, like, just edit that.

1101
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,370
Edit the mouth movement to fit the audio clip.

1102
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,170
So, anyway, um, I thought it was really cool.

1103
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,850
Because, yeah, like, there's always been, like, mini boss fights and stuff.

1104
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:54,890
And mini boss fights for Fortnite.

1105
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,890
And then, like, I think the boss fight was really cool for that.

1106
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,410
Because, like, you can get these masks.

1107
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,070
And, like, they don't know...

1108
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,530
They don't know who I am until I put that mask on.

1109
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,710
Make sure you don't include that part.

1110
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,290
Because that's a reference to something else.

1111
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,350
Um, but, like, I put on this...

1112
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,370
I put on this mask.

1113
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,390
And then, um, and I can portal and stuff.

1114
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:22,110
So, like, that's why I thought it was, like, a really cool, uh, really cool item.

1115
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,990
That's what the point of the mask is.

1116
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,830
I think my manager's gonna be mad at me.

1117
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:42,630
He gave me, like, a list of, like, okay, make sure you say this.

1118
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,310
And make sure you don't say these things.

1119
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,290
And then, like, in my head, like, for...

1120
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,350
So that your editor will, like, you know...

1121
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:54,690
So it'll be easier for, like, your editor to figure out what to do.

1122
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,950
I was like, yeah, I should be able to do that.

1123
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,390
Oh my god, look at this rap!

1124
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,130
There we go.

1125
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,090
I was like, yeah, I think I can do that.

1126
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,150
That should be fine.

1127
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,310
Um, but then I realized it's a lot harder than I thought.

1128
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,830
So, like, good luck.

1129
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,530
Oh, you can do, like, trick shots and stuff, uh, for...

1130
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,710
Wait, there's a train.

1131
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,490
Oh yeah, they have a train now, too.

1132
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,250
You can get, like, loot on the train.

1133
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:36,810
Is there anybody here?

1134
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:37,410
Beep beep.

1135
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:38,610
Beep beep.

1136
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:39,950
Anyone here?

1137
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,610
Anyone here?

1138
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,430
Beep beep.

1139
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:44,670
Hello?

1140
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,770
I'm following traffic rules.

1141
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,730
Wait, where is the train?

1142
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,870
Oh, I missed the train.

1143
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:53,690
Sorry, Frosty.

1144
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,050
I missed the train.

1145
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,490
Wait, is this actually a dragoon?

1146
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,930
My god, what are the odds?

1147
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,590
Wait, what's over there?

1148
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,670
Oh, that's another boss fight!

1149
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,430
We can take him!

1150
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,170
Oh yeah, you can get him!

1151
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,370
You can kidnap a child.

1152
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,170
Sorry, you can take a child.

1153
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,670
You can have a...

1154
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,150
Look, you can kidnap...

1155
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,510
Sorry, you can...

1156
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:22,070
You can have a child and then he'll do a little dance for you.

1157
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,130
Watch this.

1158
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,190
You can return the child, but that's not fun.

1159
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,330
Um, anyway, let's kill this guy.

1160
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,230
Let's get this boss fight.

1161
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,030
Oh!

1162
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:34,850
It's okay.

1163
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:35,850
Oh, they portal too.

1164
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,090
There's so many children!

1165
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:42,570
Oh yeah, you can return them to their home, but you don't have to do that.

1166
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:46,350
Okay.

1167
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,010
Don't worry, we got this.

1168
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,190
We got this, Frosty.

1169
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,970
Oh my god!

1170
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:53,670
Is he gonna...

1171
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,790
Frosty, no!

1172
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,850
Frosty, I have a child!

1173
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,780
Over here.

1174
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,260
Oh!

1175
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,200
No, I messed up.

1176
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,790
No, I messed up!

1177
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,900
I messed up!

1178
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,300
I got scared!

1179
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,000
No, I couldn't use the child!

1180
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,540
I got scared because they jumped down!

1181
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,680
They jumped down!

1182
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,000
I couldn't use...

1183
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,540
I couldn't make the child dance!

1184
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,520
I wanted to...

1185
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,880
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't say that.

1186
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,440
Um, what is it called?

1187
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,180
An elemental?

1188
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,860
I couldn't make the elemental dance for us, so I...

1189
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,120
When it...

1190
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,900
When it dances, it heals you and it's so cute.

1191
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,600
I couldn't show it to you guys.

1192
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,620
I wanted you guys to see the child.

1193
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,100
Sorry, I wanted...

1194
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,680
Sorry, editor.

1195
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,720
My filter's not working very well right now.

1196
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:15,940
I couldn't...

1197
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,940
Oh my god, we couldn't see the elemental dance for us.

1198
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:28,980
Okay, I'm gonna say the word elemental, and then you're gonna have to substitute.

1199
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,780
All right.

1200
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,100
Elemental.

1201
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:33,780
Elemental.

1202
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:44,060
So, whatever I say, whatever I say, child, substitute elemental.

1203
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,760
Okay, we're fine.

1204
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,060
Everything is fine.

1205
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,260
Okay, don't laugh.

1206
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,640
It makes it harder.

1207
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,860
At this point, just voice over the video.

1208
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:15,420
Okay, if we don't have enough content, we'll play Fortnite off-stream to make up for it.

1209
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:28,360
Just give me a list of things that you need clips of and then, like, you're gonna take the audio of that and then we can, like, place it up on it.

1210
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,700
That's... it's okay.

1211
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,740
But, like, we're getting our reactions, our natural reactions to things.

1212
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,360
I love...

1213
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,560
I think, like, the gunplay in Fortnite is really nice because they always have, like, so many different types of guns.

1214
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,940
Sapphire, thank you for the super chat.

1215
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,920
Thank you, thank you.

1216
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,920
I fucked up badly today.

1217
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:49,480
No!

1218
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,080
It's salvageable!

1219
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,100
This is so salvageable!

1220
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,480
Thank you, Fortnite, for the sponsor.

1221
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,740
I really appreciate it.

1222
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:56,940
I...

1223
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,040
I really appreciate it.

1224
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,660
I really do.

1225
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:08,360
Alright, here we go.

1226
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,960
Is he coming with me?

1227
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,500
He is, right?

1228
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,000
Nice.

1229
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:17,930
Nice.

1230
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,350
You know what's funny?

1231
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,550
At first, we were just, um...

1232
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,250
Cause, like, you know how I said, like, my manager was on vacation?

1233
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,330
So then, I was like, yeah, I can do, like, an edited VOD.

1234
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:29,970
That's fine.

1235
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,890
Like, not an edited VOD, but I can just, like, you know, record footage and then put audio over it.

1236
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,150
And then, my...

1237
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:35,850
When my...

1238
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:37,070
Oh my gosh, no, that's...

1239
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,970
That's Avatar.

1240
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,850
Sorry, that's Beep.

1241
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:46,130
And then, when my manager, uh, came back from vacation, um...

1242
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:47,930
He was like, no, what do you mean?

1243
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,450
He was like, you know what?

1244
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,770
Can we make you the stream?

1245
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,270
And then, they were like, no, that's fine.

1246
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,370
And then, we'll just, like, edit the VOD.

1247
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,650
We'll just edit the VOD.

1248
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,670
And then, they were like, yeah, that's fine.

1249
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,930
But then, like...

1250
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,270
Oh, hey.

1251
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,310
Oh, are you also?

1252
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:03,490
Edited.

1253
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,470
Make sure to cut this out, because it's copyrighted.

1254
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:10,890
And then, I was like...

1255
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,990
And then, it's like, no, it'll be easier.

1256
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,330
And I was like, are you sure?

1257
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,370
It's like, yeah, yeah, this will be easier for you.

1258
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,830
And now, I feel like it might not be easier.

1259
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:22,070
I...

1260
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:26,650
I don't know.

1261
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:28,650
Now...

1262
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,490
I don't think it is actually easier.

1263
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,050
Because they're like...

1264
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,890
And then, they got back from vacation.

1265
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,650
And they were like, oh, yeah, yeah, like...

1266
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:47,590
I know they're like, oh, yeah, can we just do, like, a VOD?

1267
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,890
Like, can we just, like, have her stream it?

1268
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:50,970
And then, like...

1269
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,290
Am I gonna be okay?

1270
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,270
So, now, I don't know.

1271
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,350
Oh, sh...

1272
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,130
What?

1273
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,350
Where did I get shot from?

1274
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:02,870
Wait, no, this is...

1275
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,210
Oh, this is not reloaded.

1276
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,350
This is not.

1277
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,330
I got beamed.

1278
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,250
Wait, you never got a gun?

1279
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:13,530
Bro!

1280
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,110
I didn't realize he never got a gun.

1281
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,590
So, then...

1282
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:23,390
So, now, I was like...

1283
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,130
My manager thought it was a great idea.

1284
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,950
Because they're like, it's easier.

1285
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,250
So, you don't have to...

1286
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,930
So, the reactions are more natural.

1287
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,190
But then, I think he forgot that, like...

1288
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,150
My reaction might be more natural.

1289
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,130
But it's definitely not...

1290
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:47,130
It might be...

1291
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:52,410
It might be just a little bit unhinged.

1292
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:55,450
Just a little bit for a more natural reaction.

1293
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:01,410
They forgot who exactly they're dealing with.

1294
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,630
It might be...

1295
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,110
It's like when, like, you know...

1296
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:07,550
I've been a streamer for so long.

1297
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,090
To the point where, like...

1298
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,410
Like, you know, I'm not a...

1299
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:12,610
I'm not brand risk.

1300
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,250
But it's more so of, like...

1301
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,550
I know my audience.

1302
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,970
To a point where, like...

1303
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,730
I know what I'm comfortable.

1304
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,930
Like, what is the comfortable stuff to say and stuff.

1305
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,430
But, like...

1306
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:27,810
It might not be the most, like, you know...

1307
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,870
It might not be comfortable for everybody.

1308
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:40,830
You know.

1309
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,350
So, it's like, you know, like...

1310
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:45,490
Some people will have their filters in check.

1311
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,590
I've been streaming for so long.

1312
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,070
That, like, I don't have filters anymore.

1313
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:52,970
Because, like...

1314
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,630
Well, I do to an extent.

1315
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,970
But my filters that's in place...

1316
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:01,030
Might not be the correct filters that I should have.

1317
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:05,930
Just...

1318
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,070
Maybe...

1319
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:07,530
I don't know.

1320
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,390
Seaport City?

1321
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,830
So, like, my intrusive thoughts are, like, going wild.

1322
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,130
I think my duo left me.

1323
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,650
Oh, okay.

1324
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:21,270
That's cool.

1325
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,050
Any dragoons in my lobby?

1326
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,010
Can I...

1327
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,870
Will you, like, make sure I survive?

1328
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:28,190
Alright.

1329
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,210
If any dragoons are in my lobby right now...

1330
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:35,130
If you see a PineappleGhost77 and you're in my lobby right now...

1331
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,030
Just, like, form a wall.

1332
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,730
Form a circle around me.

1333
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:41,550
That's all I want.

1334
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,850
Just form a circle.

1335
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,830
Why am I walking?

1336
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:46,150
How do I fix that?

1337
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:50,130
Oh my god.

1338
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,990
How do I fix that?

1339
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:51,730
Why am I walking?

1340
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,790
Yeah, the great dragoon wall.

1341
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,030
Press...

1342
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,030
Did I fix it?

1343
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:01,770
No.

1344
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:03,850
No.

1345
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,770
Oh, I did.

1346
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:06,570
I accidentally pressed comma.

1347
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:07,910
I don't know how I did it.

1348
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:08,990
So...

1349
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,630
I'm at Seaport Dragoons.

1350
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:11,770
Just...

1351
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:14,090
Okay, I'm not saying that as in, like...

1352
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,610
Mach 7, go kill me now.

1353
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,870
But, like, form...

1354
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,130
Make sure you form a wall around me.

1355
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:22,950
And I'll be safe.

1356
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,180
Okay.

1357
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,880
And we got shields here.

1358
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,740
Yeah, just form a wall.

1359
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,300
And then I'll know you're...

1360
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,500
Yeah, you're definitely...

1361
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,860
You're definitely not a dragoon.

1362
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,020
Hahahaha!

1363
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,500
Hahahaha!

1364
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,020
Oh no.

1365
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:50,690
Oh no.

1366
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:53,090
He's, like, right here, isn't he?

1367
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,270
He's not?

1368
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:57,590
Oh nice, okay.

1369
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,790
There's no way.

1370
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:04,250
All right, form a wall of your dragoon.

1371
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,730
And then like, I don't know, make sure I don't die.

1372
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:08,890
Oh my god.

1373
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,170
I'm gonna make the jump!

1374
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:20,690
That's right!

1375
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,990
Made the jump, but I'm scared.

1376
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:31,330
Where are they?

1377
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,890
Oh, this is my train now.

1378
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,050
My train now!

1379
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:38,270
That's right!

1380
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,010
Oh nice, I get to live here.

1381
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:43,630
Nice!

1382
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,550
I made the jump.

1383
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,710
All right, so you can hack this for like more loot, I'm pretty sure.

1384
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,790
All right, guys.

1385
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,610
All right, now I'm not at seaport anymore.

1386
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,130
I'm at- I'm heading to brutal boxcars.

1387
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:02,690
If you're a dragoon in my lobby, meet me at brutal boxcars.

1388
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:03,870
Meet me there.

1389
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,210
Wait, I think it's heals.

1390
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,330
Did they open this already?

1391
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,830
We need- we need a circle.

1392
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,290
Oh nice.

1393
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,610
Oh, they never hacked it!

1394
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,770
Wait, that's sick.

1395
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:17,890
That's good.

1396
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:19,130
It's good for me actually.

1397
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:20,910
I need this.

1398
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,990
I'll take that.

1399
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,310
All right, we're fine.

1400
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:26,910
Meet me there.

1401
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,010
We're- we're gonna go on a heist.

1402
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,970
Is anybody- form a car!

1403
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,050
It's like protect the president!

1404
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:39,690
Get cars and drive next- oh my god!

1405
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,170
No!

1406
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:41,550
Guys.

1407
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:45,330
Guys, I think they want to get on the- oh, you're so slow.

1408
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:48,550
Nerd.

1409
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:50,150
That's right.

1410
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,190
Couldn't even get on the train.

1411
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,930
I don't think those are dragoons, guys.

1412
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,530
Oh no, no, no!

1413
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,250
All right, friendly?

1414
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,610
Friendly people?

1415
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,090
Are there friendly people in the stop?

1416
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:11,770
Hello?

1417
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:12,050
Hello?

1418
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,190
Hey guys, you guys all friendly?

1419
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,370
All right, nice.

1420
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,430
Next stop.

1421
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,910
Next stop, Brutal Boss Cars.

1422
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:25,390
I'll see you guys there.

1423
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:30,870
Wait, we got shot one time and we're okay now.

1424
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,050
Nice.

1425
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:33,970
You know what that means.

1426
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:39,290
But it's like not co- what is- oh no.

1427
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,230
Oh no, what is it?

1428
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,010
Oh, this one.

1429
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:45,730
Default.

1430
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,450
This is the safest one.

1431
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:53,430
This is the safest dance.

1432
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,350
Anyway, you don't have to edit this one out.

1433
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,110
We're fine.

1434
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:00,990
Look at that.

1435
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:03,010
Look at that.

1436
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,490
Look at us go.

1437
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,950
Yeah, dance once if you're a friend.

1438
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,790
Dance twice if you're not a friend.

1439
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,790
So that I can have time to shoot you before you shoot me back.

1440
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,010
All right, any- but the- any dragoons here?

1441
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,550
Any dragoons to welcome me?

1442
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:24,490
Brutal Box Cars?

1443
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:25,330
Hello?

1444
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,070
Anyone here to welcome me?

1445
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,590
You know, like I got back from my trip and then I have people visiting me.

1446
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,750
You know, like that?

1447
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,350
Hello, guys.

1448
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:35,310
Anybody?

1449
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:36,970
Anyone?

1450
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,690
Oh, I think all the dragoons are dead.

1451
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:44,310
There's nobody.

1452
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:52,010
You know, there's nobody here to like greet me at the- oh, it's like, you know, you got off your flight.

1453
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:56,710
You got off your flight and nobody is there to welcome you home.

1454
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:57,810
Oh my god, there's a child!

1455
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:59,370
Guys, I'm gonna show you the child.

1456
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:01,470
Yoink.

1457
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:05,700
Yoink.

1458
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,640
Okay, watch this though.

1459
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,180
Dance for me.

1460
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:09,700
Wait.

1461
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,560
Oh, child.

1462
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,160
Child.

1463
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:12,880
Okay.

1464
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,560
Okay, the child needs a spot to dance.

1465
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,880
That is- oh!

1466
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,180
Oh, no!

1467
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,080
Okay, the child cannot dance.

1468
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,460
The child cannot dance on Kidnapping Successful.

1469
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,800
Okay, don't put that in.

1470
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:25,880
Kidna-

1471
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,420
We kidnapped him live on stream.

1472
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,800
Oh my god, we're so good.

1473
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,180
Okay.

1474
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:43,780
Okay.

1475
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:44,840
All right, watch this.

1476
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,880
Okay, we kidnapped an elemental, but watch this.

1477
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,540
It's so cute.

1478
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,500
Dance for me.

1479
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:51,660
Yeah!

1480
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:54,700
One!

1481
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:57,100
Two!

1482
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,900
You're so cute.

1483
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:00,560
There you go.

1484
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,400
That's what he does.

1485
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,720
That's what he does.

1486
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,700
That's so cute.

1487
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,040
I don't feel safe, like, at all.

1488
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,640
Like, I feel like, you know, I'm literally in the open right now.

1489
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,420
All right, let's- oh, somebody has a rifle.

1490
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,820
Oh my god, this is way too quiet.

1491
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,340
There's still 34 people alive?!

1492
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,620
Holy sh- I'm gonna get a car.

1493
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,800
I'm gonna try and feel more safe.

1494
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,200
Me and my- me and my elemental.

1495
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,480
Me and my child.

1496
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,940
This child feels safe.

1497
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,880
Me and my child.

1498
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,360
Oh my god, I turned on the radio.

1499
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,280
Okay, um, when I-

1500
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,620
It's okay, it's gonna be edited.

1501
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,680
It's gonna be edited.

1502
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,520
Literally,

1503
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,320
it yearns for the mines.

1504
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:27,140
That is so- that minecra- the Minecraft lore for the movie with Jack Black and then he's like, like, the whole- the whole lore of, like, Minecraft Steve is that he was a child that really wanted to be a a a coal miner.

1505
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,280
Like, that's his story.

1506
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:38,560
And then he got transported into Minecraft, which I thought was like, why would you want- People die in the mines.

1507
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:40,120
What the fuck?

1508
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,000
I can swear because I know you can't put that in the vine.

1509
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,360
I- that is nuts.

1510
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,860
He yearns for the mines.

1511
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,520
It's a little stupid.

1512
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,000
That's all I'm gonna say.

1513
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,360
And then, like, I'm just thinking, like, why is the apple a cube?

1514
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,820
Like, I don't understand.

1515
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,540
Why is the apple a cube?

1516
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,760
I'm gonna do to you what he did to me.

1517
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,600
Never mind.

1518
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,740
Oh, never mind.

1519
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,680
That's okay, I have air time.

1520
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:20,730
Oh, what the fuck?

1521
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,440
I don't have air time.

1522
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:30,300
Wait, there's- you're a freak.

1523
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,470
What kind of freak follows me?

1524
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:38,950
Oh, no.

1525
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,190
Wait, he's still- is he still following?

1526
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:41,830
I can't tell.

1527
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,050
I can't tell.

1528
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,030
No, it's not.

1529
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:47,810
My car's okay.

1530
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:48,690
Guys, it's okay.

1531
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,090
I- it's salvageable.

1532
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:50,810
I can fix it.

1533
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:52,870
I can fix this.

1534
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,130
Oh my god, there's a- there's another child.

1535
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,820
Get over here.

1536
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:01,580
Get over-

1537
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,980
I'm done playing with the other child.

1538
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:11,320
So, like, in the- in the other child.

1539
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,760
So, like, this child.

1540
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,060
This, like, this elemental.

1541
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,360
He makes you fly.

1542
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:24,190
But it's, like, one time you steal because, you know, you gotta go back to him.

1543
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,430
Hahaha.

1544
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,890
Okay, and then, like, get over here, child.

1545
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,830
And go- get over here, elemental.

1546
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,870
I'm coming back for you.

1547
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:36,910
And then you pick him up and then you can return him to his home.

1548
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:38,470
Right here.

1549
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:45,090
You pick up this child and you're like, feed him.

1550
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,250
Oh, they already fed him.

1551
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:46,850
Never mind.

1552
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:48,270
He's already been fed.

1553
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,550
I'm no use for you anymore.

1554
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,730
I like the other one more.

1555
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,290
Hahaha.

1556
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,830
Into the waters you go.

1557
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:00,870
Wait, where's the other one?

1558
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,750
Hey, where's the blue one?

1559
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,690
I like the blue one more.

1560
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,130
Oh, I guess I'll take you for now.

1561
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:11,930
You're mine.

1562
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,410
There you are, blue one!

1563
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:16,890
There's so many!

1564
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,350
Oh my god, get over here.

1565
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:20,810
That's right.

1566
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:22,090
Okay, three.

1567
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:22,750
That's right.

1568
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,830
Oh my god, look at all these orphans.

1569
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,370
Look at all these elementals.

1570
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,930
Look at these orphans here.

1571
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,030
Okay.

1572
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,710
Where are they?

1573
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,650
Oh, the strogan arena's here!

1574
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,210
Okay, that's like another place.

1575
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:50,510
This place is like freaky as hell.

1576
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:51,710
Oh my god, it's so far.

1577
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,730
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1578
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:54,790
I'm not gonna make it.

1579
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:55,790
It's way too far.

1580
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,530
They're gonna have like gold and purple guns by now I get there.

1581
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,310
Are you crying?

1582
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,460
Are you crying?

1583
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,020
What's that?

1584
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,920
Oh, it's fighting over there!

1585
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,820
I see them.

1586
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,900
They're like right over here.

1587
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,810
Okay, let's head over.

1588
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:31,670
We see he's happy!

1589
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:32,530
He's smiling!

1590
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,330
Look at him.

1591
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:36,950
He's like a little guy.

1592
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:41,570
Oh, they killed somebody.

1593
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:43,810
Okay.

1594
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,710
Look at that!

1595
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,330
See, look!

1596
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,510
He's so happy!

1597
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:55,530
He's like, again, again!

1598
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:56,590
Yeah?

1599
01:15:57,870 --> 01:15:58,790
Yeah, again?

1600
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:01,410
Right, child?

1601
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:03,390
Look at that.

1602
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,030
Oh my god, there he is.

1603
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,620
Oh my god, thank you for the rainbug!

1604
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,760
Thank you, thank you!

1605
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,220
I figured it out, guys.

1606
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,040
Oh no, child.

1607
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:18,880
Oh no.

1608
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,180
Oh my god.

1609
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,100
Oh no, that's not where I want to go, but that's fine!

1610
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,780
That's fine!

1611
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,920
Child, dance for me!

1612
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:38,530
Do your little jinky dance!

1613
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:41,770
Do your little dance!

1614
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,810
Okay, come back in my pocket.

1615
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:45,870
Child!

1616
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,290
They danced for me.

1617
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:51,810
It's fine.

1618
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:52,390
It worked.

1619
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,890
I can make him dance again.

1620
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:56,170
Oh.

1621
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,950
Now dance again.

1622
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,370
There we go.

1623
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,030
That's right.

1624
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,330
Good dancing.

1625
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:09,750
I don't have bullets left.

1626
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,050
No, no, you're not running away.

1627
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,350
You're not running away.

1628
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:16,510
You're not running away.

1629
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,270
All right.

1630
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,430
No, this is duos.

1631
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,550
I messed up.

1632
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,660
Oh, thank god.

1633
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,400
I need this.

1634
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:34,960
Actually.

1635
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,440
All right, good.

1636
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:37,960
We're okay.

1637
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,180
That's fine.

1638
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,660
The child is now safe.

1639
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,300
Guys, it was dangerous!

1640
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,340
He didn't know what- that child didn't know what was good for him, okay?

1641
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,400
I went over there and like saved him.

1642
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,080
He could have tripped and fell.

1643
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,520
I literally saved that guy.

1644
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,280
I'm a hero.

1645
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:09,860
You're welcome.

1646
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,370
Okay, where do I- okay, there's ammo.

1647
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:16,190
Nice.

1648
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:17,970
I was running out of ammo.

1649
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,230
All right.

1650
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,560
Is it really okay?

1651
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,580
We can find another one.

1652
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,780
I don't know what happens when you use all of them.

1653
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
I've never had that opportunity.

1654
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,160
Oh my god.

1655
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:33,940
Yes!

1656
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,140
Okay, wait, wait.

1657
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:36,920
Oh my god.

1658
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,480
Now I have anime on my side.

1659
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,720
Oh my god.

1660
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,340
This is good.

1661
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,140
This is good.

1662
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,020
This is good for us.

1663
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,320
Um, we don't need a shotgun because we have anime now.

1664
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,260
And then...

1665
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,440
Okay, nice.

1666
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:48,760
Okay.

1667
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,040
We have- no, you guys don't understand.

1668
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:59,540
We- I- I died to ice spice like two times with this.

1669
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,700
I- You guys don't understand.

1670
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,920
His anime is that strong.

1671
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,320
Oh no, I'm a little scared though.

1672
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,680
I don't know.

1673
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,600
Oh, they're over there.

1674
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,220
They're over there.

1675
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,820
You think he saw me?

1676
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,200
Guys, I think they saw me.

1677
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,740
I think they saw me.

1678
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,760
I'm pretty sure.

1679
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,020
I'm pretty sure they saw me.

1680
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,480
I need to be on the other side of them.

1681
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:38,160
I'm scared.

1682
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:46,240
I don't have enough time for my child to dance a little long.

1683
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,440
Dance one last time and then...

1684
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:54,720
I need to- I want to dance one last time with with my elementa.

1685
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,960
And then, uh, and see what happens to him.

1686
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,240
I just wonder what happens to him.

1687
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,420
I have my sword.

1688
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,780
I have my katana with me.

1689
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,300
I have it.

1690
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,260
We'll be fine, right?

1691
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,340
We're not gonna get sniped, right guys?

1692
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,800
We'll be fine.

1693
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,660
I'm literally- I think it's like...

1694
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,880
Three duos and then me.

1695
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,220
Wait, this is it.

1696
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:25,020
I'm gonna go in.

1697
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,720
Oh, no, they're just fighting over- what the fuck?

1698
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,040
What the fuck

1699
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,080
is going on?

1700
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:42,710
Is it safe?

1701
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,230
I'm waiting for the third party.

1702
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:49,910
Because there's no one knocked yet.

1703
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,510
I feel like I'm gonna get third partied here.

1704
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:58,690
Unless...

1705
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,310
There he is.

1706
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:02,250
There he is.

1707
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:03,330
He doesn't know.

1708
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:07,730
Just casually walking up.

1709
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,270
Just gotta make sure I'm safe here, too.

1710
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,110
Wait, where did he go?

1711
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:15,150
Oh, no, I lost track of people.

1712
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,850
Wait, where did he go?

1713
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:34,530
Where did he go?

1714
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:35,870
Oh, no.

1715
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,070
Enemy.

1716
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:40,410
Okay.

1717
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:42,730
All right, we're fine.

1718
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,310
We're fine.

1719
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:47,290
Enemy.

1720
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,750
We have enemy on our side.

1721
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,130
Where are they?

1722
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,250
Wait, where did they go?

1723
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,750
Where's my fighting?

1724
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:09,470
How am I supposed to third party when they don't fight?

1725
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,230
Wait, maybe right here?

1726
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:21,490
Yo, Kiamber Doge, I'm trying to find a fight right now.

1727
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:23,950
I'm a little scared, though.

1728
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:30,130
Wait, that's not fair.

1729
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,230
They have two teleporters.

1730
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,320
Wait, that's not fair.

1731
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,280
They have two teleporters.

1732
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,540
How the fuck am I supposed to compete with that?

1733
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,210
Guys, I don't- I don't know anymore.

1734
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:54,850
Wait, they knocked somebody.

1735
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,270
They knocked somebody so far!

1736
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:01,750
No, this is not path- I'm- I'm a solo.

1737
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,610
I'm a solo in this scary world.

1738
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,150
Me, I am a single dad.

1739
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:07,710
Um...

1740
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:11,170
Who adopted this orphan out of the goodness of my heart.

1741
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:12,250
And then...

1742
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:14,030
but...

1743
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:19,070
But I need to figure out how to get there.

1744
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:22,110
I need to figure out how to fucking survive.

1745
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,750
This bush is safe.

1746
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:40,090
Oh my god, this is a safe bush.

1747
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:44,590
It's two duos and me.

1748
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:47,470
Okay.

1749
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,030
There's two- two are here.

1750
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,030
Two are up the hill.

1751
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:57,210
And then there's me in this bush.

1752
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:03,030
Okay, okay.

1753
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:10,830
Like, what am I supposed to do in this situation?

1754
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:14,070
Oh my god, what am I supposed to-

1755
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,410
That's looking right.

1756
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:21,330
Yeah!

1757
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,550
I creeped up!

1758
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:32,690
He must be like- he must be like, what the fuck?

1759
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:35,510
Where did he even come from?

1760
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:36,790
That's right.

1761
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,130
Juice world!

1762
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:46,390
Oh my god, it's okay.

1763
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,730
At least somebody gets to be a winner.

1764
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:54,270
At least- right guys, that's all that matters.

1765
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,590
He gets to be a winner.

1766
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:09,690
Oh my god, where- oh wait, the battle pass is sick.

1767
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:10,090
Okay.

1768
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:12,650
What?

1769
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:13,490
Soon.

1770
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,550
This is my goal.

1771
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,790
This is unlocks at January- that's my goal.

1772
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,750
Wait, enable auto claim.

1773
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,370
Oh my god.

1774
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,050
No, I have to wait until January 17.

1775
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:25,510
But like- ooh!

1776
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,970
Wait, that's sick.

1777
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:30,010
I think like my favorite one was...

1778
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,230
My favorite- oh my god.

1779
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,690
Oh wait, that's not the child.

1780
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:36,050
Oh, it's a sticker!

1781
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,290
Oh, that- she's cute though.

1782
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,670
I also really like their original skins too.

1783
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,310
Um, their original skins are really cool as well.

1784
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,270
It's like the actual like, um...

1785
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:51,250
design and stuff.

1786
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:52,250
Everything.

1787
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:52,610
Everything.

1788
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,290
Who's that?

1789
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,990
Who's that buddy behind him?

1790
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,640
Okay, but then they have Baymax.

1791
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,160
I love how...

1792
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:11,360
All of these is like original skin and then there's Baymax.

1793
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,220
He's just- he's just there.

1794
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,560
He's just there.

1795
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,300
Oh, and then this is the night rose.

1796
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,140
This is the lady that we eliminated earlier.

1797
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,260
Um, wait, what's this?

1798
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,380
Is this like the- oh, it's a backpack.

1799
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,120
Wait, is this like- oh, the puppet dance.

1800
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,440
Yeah, she's the boss girl!

1801
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,180
So, what's the last one?

1802
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,840
The tactical night rose.

1803
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,380
I wonder if they have the- oh, they're- oh, is this a glider?

1804
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,120
Oh!

1805
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,560
Okay, that's sick.

1806
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,980
That's a sick glider though.

1807
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,760
I like the glider.

1808
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:52,840
Okay.

1809
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,360
All right, I got a list.

1810
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,280
I just- I was just sent a list of...

1811
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,880
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18.

1812
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,080
Sorry, I got sent a list of...

1813
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,300
Of like, um...

1814
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:15,500
For like, I get to- I- I figure out what pro to play with on- on...

1815
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,980
Is this Friday or Thursday?

1816
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,340
On Thursday or Friday?

1817
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,020
I don't remember.

1818
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:23,640
All right, I'm going to do trio now.

1819
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:24,860
Trio should be better.

1820
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,460
Trio should be better.

1821
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,400
Because like, they can't disappoint me, right?

1822
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,180
They can't- there's no way.

1823
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,960
There's no way they'll disappoint me this time.

1824
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:41,800
Do you think a two-hour vod- do you think a two- two hours of content will be enough for my editor?

1825
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,100
Or like...

1826
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:44,860
Is he fucked?

1827
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,740
To make like, 10 minutes.

1828
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:54,120
Do you think he'll be okay with the things I gave him?

1829
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:57,880
No.

1830
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,780
Do you think he'll be okay?

1831
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,640
Oh, okay.

1832
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:13,560
Remember to censor my- Okay, whenever this guy shows up next to me, remember to like, put like, those like, mosaic- mosaic blur right there.

1833
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,560
I'm gonna get more water.

1834
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:19,720
I'll be right back.

1835
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,240
If anything happens to me, I'm sorry.

1836
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,390
I think he'll be fine.

1837
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:46,890
He'll be okay.

1838
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,650
Thanks, Fortnite, for the sponsor.

1839
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,490
The editor's dead.

1840
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:54,970
He'll be fine, guys.

1841
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,850
Don't be- no dooming here.

1842
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:02,290
He'll be okay.

1843
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:03,570
I believe in our editor.

1844
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:11,010
We're always not gonna have a bot to edit- Darkblade, thank you for the super- super chat.

1845
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:12,370
Thank you, thank you.

1846
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,730
He'll be okay.

1847
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:21,870
Look, if a worse thing happens, I'll just put some extra stuff off stream.

1848
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:32,980
Look, my manager thought it would- it was- it would save so much time if I just stream it.

1849
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:40,100
And then like, um, so it's not like, scripted in terms of like, me reading off stuff, but like, little does he know.

1850
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,380
Offstream Doki.

1851
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:51,260
My stream- streamer Doki is a little unhinged.

1852
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,660
It's like, oh, it's gonna be much more natural, you know?

1853
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,340
It'll be so much more natural.

1854
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:04,920
You stream your reactions to like, the new content.

1855
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,160
True!

1856
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:11,230
Did I just get away?

1857
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:16,750
If it works, it works, you know?

1858
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:19,470
If it won't work, it works.

1859
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,900
Is there an extra gun here?

1860
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,600
Oh my god, I don't have a- Oh my god, oh!

1861
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:36,860
No!

1862
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:39,740
No!

1863
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,040
No!

1864
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,840
Wait, are they all alive?

1865
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,860
Wait, she's still alive.

1866
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:00,480
Cut the part where I die, but leaving that sick kill I got on my melee.

1867
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:10,080
And then he like, read the brief, and then he was like, oh.

1868
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:21,320
And then before, before like, my stream started, my manager was like, oh shit, I died so conveniently.

1869
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:27,060
My manager was like, did you read what you can and can't say?

1870
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,420
And I was like, yeah.

1871
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,800
And then he was like, but did you read it?

1872
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,340
And I was like, yeah.

1873
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:43,540
He's like, okay, but like, you know, you, you, you, you know like, what you can and can't say, right?

1874
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,280
I'm like, yeah.

1875
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:52,080
And in my head, I was like, the editor can edit it out.

1876
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:09,940
I was like, the editor can- Can edit, can edit it out, right?

1877
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,560
No,

1878
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,040
I did!

1879
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:21,780
I did read it!

1880
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,040
I did!

1881
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:34,710
I did, I, I, I 100% did.

1882
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,140
Also, this island.

1883
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:41,900
Oh, sorry.

1884
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,080
Okay, island.

1885
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:49,120
So whenever I say map, make sure I substitute it with island.

1886
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,380
Island.

1887
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,560
Island.

1888
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:52,980
Island!

1889
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,560
Island.

1890
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,060
I forgot it's an island.

1891
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:01,160
Like, it's like, like, it's just this random place in the middle of nowhere.

1892
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,820
I forgot about that.

1893
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,400
Like, this is an actual island area.

1894
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,120
Fuck, editor.

1895
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,460
I believe in you.

1896
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,400
I, I don't- I believe in you.

1897
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:27,140
And I- look, I did say, I did- where are we chopping?

1898
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,700
We can chop stuff?

1899
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:33,020
Oh my god, it's like a hidden bamboo grove.

1900
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,380
Wait, that's so cool.

1901
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:37,460
Wait, that's so cute.

1902
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,300
I like that.

1903
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,580
That's so cute.

1904
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:45,900
It's like a little hidden area that you can- oh, this guy's a Fortnite player right there.

1905
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,340
Oh my god, wait, that's a boss guy literally next to us.

1906
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,980
Wait, I don't think he's a good guy.

1907
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,060
Wait, where am I?

1908
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,100
He does not look like a good guy.

1909
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:09,380
Okay, I'm just gonna run because I have nothing and there's a car in front of me.

1910
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,320
Get in here!

1911
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,960
We're going to the mall!

1912
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,400
Get in here!

1913
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,140
We're all going to the mall!

1914
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,660
Midnight, get your ass in the car!

1915
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,290
That's right!

1916
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:33,850
Shopping trip, mall time!

1917
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:37,010
Where is this?

1918
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,010
Oh, it's over here.

1919
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:40,950
This is like, get in losers.

1920
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,460
Beep beep.

1921
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:47,460
Beep beep.

1922
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,360
Wait, you can boost in this tiny ass car?

1923
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:52,640
Sweet.

1924
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:57,540
All right, we can grab for stuff like...

1925
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,880
here at the gas station.

1926
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,420
Oh, there's like a little area here.

1927
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,420
Grab your stuff!

1928
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:04,820
Go!

1929
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,780
Loot this!

1930
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:07,540
Loot it!

1931
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:08,960
That's right!

1932
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,440
Make sure you censor that guy.

1933
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,600
Make sure he's just like this pile of mosaic running around.

1934
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,140
Ha ha ha!

1935
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,960
All right, I might be able to swap cars here too if it's a nice car.

1936
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,540
All right, grab your stuff.

1937
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,560
Wait, I need to grab stuff too.

1938
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,460
Is there anything here?

1939
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:35,080
There's nothing at the gas station?

1940
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,540
I guess there's food.

1941
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:41,320
Can I eat?

1942
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,180
Wait, does this give me shields?

1943
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:45,900
No, okay.

1944
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,620
Are you just waiting?

1945
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:52,340
You guys can drive too!

1946
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,720
Oh my!

1947
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,300
Ha ha ha!

1948
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,280
I love how those two are just waiting there.

1949
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:01,980
They're just like, any day now.

1950
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,220
Ha ha ha!

1951
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,600
She'll come back for us, right?

1952
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,880
Where's the loot?

1953
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,220
Like, where is the loot?

1954
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,840
Okay, we're gonna go to the fucking city.

1955
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,200
We'll be fine.

1956
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:18,220
Here we go.

1957
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,480
I like how they literally just sat there and waited for me.

1958
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,900
Like, ha ha ha!

1959
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:25,080
They're just like, any day now.

1960
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,360
She'll come back, right?

1961
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,300
All right, guys, it's shopping time.

1962
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,860
This is our shopping time.

1963
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,540
Oh, nice.

1964
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,140
Okay, nice.

1965
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,740
We filled up our shields.

1966
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,320
Oh!

1967
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,520
Wait, is this a...

1968
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,240
Let's see, what's this?

1969
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,940
Oh, that's just cool.

1970
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:51,680
Watch this.

1971
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:53,620
Look at that.

1972
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,520
Yeah, screw that wall.

1973
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh, shit!

1974
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:00,860
Oh my God.

1975
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,960
I'm so sorry, Boris.

1976
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:08,690
Okay, they're bots.

1977
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:09,350
Oh, thank God.

1978
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:10,090
Loot delivery!

1979
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:12,190
Loot delivery!

1980
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:16,030
It's okay.

1981
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:17,110
It's okay, man.

1982
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:18,650
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1983
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:19,370
They were bots.

1984
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:22,530
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1985
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:25,170
They were just bots.

1986
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,030
There's no way they're real.

1987
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:30,390
Oh, is that shield fish?

1988
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,110
Okay.

1989
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,560
We're fine, right?

1990
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,060
We need to get a better car.

1991
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,440
I want a sicker car.

1992
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:43,540
Oh!

1993
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,540
I asked and I received.

1994
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,080
There we go.

1995
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,600
All right, guys, come on!

1996
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:50,880
Get in here!

1997
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,600
Oh, there's a bike next to me, too!

1998
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,680
We can be like...

1999
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,200
Like a bodyguard in the president!

2000
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,260
Fill your shield?

2001
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:01,780
No.

2002
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,140
Okay, let me chug jug.

2003
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:15,370
That was a cool car earlier.

2004
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:20,970
You've ruined it.

2005
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,570
That's fucked up, man.

2006
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:33,930
Now we have some...

2007
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:37,630
I mean, I guess...

2008
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:41,450
No!

2009
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:43,910
The one before was cooler!

2010
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:46,630
That one was cooler!

2011
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,390
He overrode the trip!

2012
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,750
No, he could've just ran.

2013
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,150
Oh, my God, you could've ran.

2014
01:38:56,770 --> 01:38:57,330
Weak.

2015
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:03,130
I miss.

2016
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:08,340
Oh, shit!

2017
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,700
Oh, my God!

2018
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,560
Oh, my God!

2019
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,220
Bro!

2020
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,540
I still got him!

2021
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,300
I still got him!

2022
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:23,320
No!

2023
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,380
I still got him!

2024
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:37,120
Okay, I still killed him.

2025
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,940
I don't know!

2026
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,600
He, like, got in the car!

2027
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,480
The enemy guy got in the car!

2028
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:48,800
Oh, wait, I love that gun.

2029
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,840
Got in the car, and then...

2030
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:55,600
And then he, like, drove with me in it.

2031
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,940
And then I killed him.

2032
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,540
I can't believe I got away!

2033
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,400
That's crazy!

2034
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,700
That's actually crazy!

2035
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:12,740
Oh, my God!

2036
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,960
Double J, thank you in the super chat!

2037
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,760
There's no way you get away with it!

2038
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,920
What can I say?

2039
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:24,880
I'm just a gamer.

2040
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,240
And the guy...

2041
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,720
Actually, I had, like...

2042
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:33,320
30 HP, and I still won!

2043
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,340
Like, what the fuck?

2044
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:38,620
Okay.

2045
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,080
That's fine.

2046
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,540
Okay, now I don't know, editor.

2047
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,680
Our teammates...

2048
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,380
What do we do here?

2049
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:51,820
Editor, what do...

2050
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,860
Oh, my God!

2051
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:55,440
Editor, what do we do here?

2052
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:03,210
This is a little bit of a problem.

2053
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:07,710
Okay.

2054
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:11,270
Oh,

2055
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:20,470
my God, you're right!

2056
01:41:22,010 --> 01:41:24,850
We create a custom with just us!

2057
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:25,930
You're right!

2058
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,890
Okay, if I see you...

2059
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:30,330
If I see you...

2060
01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:31,570
Okay, I'm gonna create...

2061
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:35,690
After this game, I'm gonna create a custom for just us, guys.

2062
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:36,830
And then we're...

2063
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:38,050
It's not gonna be scripted.

2064
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:40,150
It's not gonna be scripted, guys.

2065
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:43,410
Oh, shit.

2066
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:44,290
Where are we dropping?

2067
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:46,850
Oh, I... Sorry, guys.

2068
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:48,430
You know how I pinged that area?

2069
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,440
Sorry, I know I pinged that area.

2070
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,220
But, like...

2071
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,700
Don't worry, I'm heading over there.

2072
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,180
Guys, no, no, don't be...

2073
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,020
Guys, no, no, no, don't be pussies.

2074
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,220
No, here!

2075
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:07,260
Here!

2076
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,600
That's right.

2077
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,600
Listen to me.

2078
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,680
We're dropping here.

2079
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:17,900
That's right.

2080
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:22,590
Alright, here we go.

2081
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,710
Alright, just make sure you don't have any...

2082
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:28,730
Make sure you are using...

2083
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:30,170
Non...

2084
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:33,490
Non-third IP skins, guys.

2085
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:36,150
Wait.

2086
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:38,030
Okay, they're at the edge over there.

2087
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:39,610
So maybe I can grab...

2088
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:40,970
I'll grab something over on the backside.

2089
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:44,090
There's no way somebody land in the back.

2090
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:49,750
There's no way.

2091
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:51,590
We'll be fine.

2092
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,340
Okay, here we go.

2093
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,920
Okay, I'm gonna drink this.

2094
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,740
Okay, I got some shields.

2095
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:13,200
Yeah, see?

2096
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:14,220
Everything's fine.

2097
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:15,200
And I got some banana.

2098
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,840
Oh, nice.

2099
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:17,860
Let me grab this.

2100
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,020
I believe in them.

2101
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:25,420
Okay.

2102
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:28,440
This is a shotgun, right?

2103
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,160
Okay, we're good.

2104
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,060
Don't worry, I'm coming over!

2105
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:32,680
No!

2106
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,760
Monkey boy, no!

2107
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:42,330
Guys, I still believe in us.

2108
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,830
In our way, I still believe in us.

2109
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,150
Wait, what?

2110
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:56,830
Oh, you're a dragoon!

2111
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:57,290
Thanks.

2112
01:43:59,130 --> 01:43:59,790
Did he die?

2113
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,290
He might have died.

2114
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,410
He might be dead.

2115
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,300
Mustard pack, get shit on.

2116
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:20,580
Get shit on, mustard pack.

2117
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,180
Die, get shit on!

2118
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:29,880
Oh my god, let me out.

2119
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,520
Oh my god.

2120
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,020
Don't worry, I got you guys.

2121
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,660
Don't worry, I got you guys!

2122
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,040
Coconut.

2123
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:59,080
Where's the other card?

2124
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,120
Is that it?

2125
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:02,400
Oh!

2126
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:06,880
Oh!

2127
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,200
Okay.

2128
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,980
You know the best part?

2129
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,920
Is that...

2130
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,960
The best part about this is that...

2131
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,320
Because he has a jigsaw skin...

2132
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,940
He doesn't exist in my...

2133
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:25,160
He's irrelevant.

2134
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,860
What a slide.

2135
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:32,660
It's okay, he's very irrelevant.

2136
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:35,080
Just because he's on jigsaw.

2137
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:35,860
Alright.

2138
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,640
How do I make a custom lobby again?

2139
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:38,600
It's been so long.

2140
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,700
I think it was...

2141
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:44,120
Oh my god guys, I don't remember how to make it.

2142
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,420
Guys, do you guys remember?

2143
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,320
I think it was...

2144
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,860
I think it was...

2145
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:50,860
Zero build?

2146
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,560
With a code.

2147
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,200
I know, I'm trying to remember how to do this.

2148
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,340
It's been so long.

2149
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,440
Wait, what are the quests?

2150
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,720
Oh, you can do quests to...

2151
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,060
Oh!

2152
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,100
You can do quests to like, unlock stuff.

2153
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:10,520
I didn't know you could do that.

2154
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:11,660
That's cute.

2155
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:14,940
Oh, that's cute, you can do all that.

2156
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,580
Oh, if you have like, Fortnite on...

2157
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,540
iPhone.

2158
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:20,440
You can have like, these things.

2159
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,660
Matchmaking key.

2160
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,500
Yes, but...

2161
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,280
Put your own code as a lobby.

2162
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,060
Oh, there it is!

2163
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:28,600
Custom key.

2164
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:29,880
There we go, okay!

2165
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:31,540
Our custom key.

2166
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,400
Sponsored.

2167
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,620
That's our custom key, guys.

2168
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:37,360
Alright.

2169
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,280
Did I put it?

2170
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:40,820
Sponsored.

2171
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,960
Yeah, alright, you go here.

2172
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,120
At the bottom, and it says custom key.

2173
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,120
Our custom key is...

2174
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:49,360

2175
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,020
That's...

2176
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:56,440
That's our custom key.

2177
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,920
And then we're gonna do...

2178
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,760
We're gonna do duos.

2179
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:02,980
We're gonna go duos.

2180
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:03,740
Our region!

2181
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,120
Our region is...

2182
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,500
I'll make you guys play on my region.

2183
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,120
Our region is...

2184
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,220
What the fuck?

2185
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,040
Okay, west.

2186
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:14,780
Okay, west.

2187
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:15,600
NA west.

2188
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,980
That's our region, guys.

2189
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,160
Alright, that should be it.

2190
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,840
Wait, queue is full?

2191
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:25,720
That's just me.

2192
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:27,800
It's literally sponsored.

2193
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,860
Where are you guys?

2194
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:36,960
Oh, we got it!

2195
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,360
The code is sponsored.

2196
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,860
That's the code, chat.

2197
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:43,080
I believe in us.

2198
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:45,160
That's literally the code.

2199
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,200
What could go wrong?

2200
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:50,240
What?

2201
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,260
What could go wrong?

2202
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:04,870
No copyrights!

2203
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:05,890
Okay, here are the rules.

2204
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:07,770
Here are the rules, guys.

2205
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:10,190
I hope you guys are taking the skins off.

2206
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:12,310
Okay, no...

2207
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:14,850
Copyright...

2208
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:15,670
Skins.

2209
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:16,870
Alright?

2210
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:19,030
That's the main concern.

2211
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:21,530
That's the main concern.

2212
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:22,590
We gotta make this natural.

2213
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:29,390
Okay, let me turn streamer mode on.

2214
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:31,250
Where's streamer mode for the music?

2215
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:33,930
We might have to turn it on just so we can...

2216
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:35,670
License audio.

2217
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:37,190
Mute others.

2218
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:38,350
Okay, there we go.

2219
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:40,970
Okay, I'm gonna mute you guys.

2220
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,490
Mute others.

2221
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:44,870
Okay, now we're actually...

2222
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:47,270
We're so natural now.

2223
01:48:47,450 --> 01:48:49,990
Alright, no copyright skins.

2224
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:52,650
Alright, that's it.

2225
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:55,090
That's it.

2226
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,170
Okay, code is...

2227
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:02,590
Code is...

2228
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:04,130
Wish I'd done this in the first place.

2229
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:05,850
Code is sponsored.

2230
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:09,930
That's the code.

2231
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,630
And then, that's the custom key.

2232
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:15,250
Sponsored.

2233
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:19,680
Custom...

2234
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:20,500
Custom key.

2235
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,260
Also, guys.

2236
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:24,380
If you guys didn't know.

2237
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:25,720
I have a creator code.

2238
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:27,880
So what you do is that you go to the shop.

2239
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:30,580
And then you support a creator down here.

2240
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,620
And then you put Doki Bird.

2241
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,080
And then...

2242
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,620
And then, bam!

2243
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:38,360
You support me.

2244
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:41,440
The mode is...

2245
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,360
Zero build.

2246
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,200
It's zero build.

2247
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:44,780
Duo.

2248
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:47,200
And then, oh yeah, I should write...

2249
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,100
West Coast.

2250
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:51,660
Duo.

2251
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:53,340
No build.

2252
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,120
We're not building.

2253
01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:56,840
There we go.

2254
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,780
That's everything.

2255
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,440
That's all the information here.

2256
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,000
Alright.

2257
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,600
Wait, do I start?

2258
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh, I could've started the smash.

2259
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:11,400
Sorry.

2260
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:11,520
Alright.

2261
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,480
Wait for it.

2262
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:19,160
79 people in the lobby.

2263
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,200
I'll go start.

2264
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:24,240
Wait, what was the maximum amount of people you can have in there?

2265
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,520
I don't remember.

2266
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,360
What's the maximum number?

2267
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,120
Okay, and then I put this up.

2268
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:32,820
Wow, guys.

2269
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,360
I just queued up random...

2270
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,060
Oh, I thought...

2271
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:36,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

2272
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:36,760
Sorry.

2273
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,540
Now, we could've had more of you guys here.

2274
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,420
Alright.

2275
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,640
I'm investigating your skins now.

2276
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,580
Alright, fashion show time.

2277
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:49,720
Show me your skins.

2278
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,020
It's fashion show time.

2279
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,500
Guys.

2280
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,780
Oh, wait, this is a new one.

2281
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:57,500
Oh, it's so cute.

2282
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,680
This is a newer one.

2283
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:01,760
Nice, nice fashion.

2284
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,400
Oh, nice, nice.

2285
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,640
Did you guys use my code to buy those?

2286
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,280
You guys used my code, right?

2287
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:09,900
Drip check.

2288
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:11,680
Alright, show me your best drip.

2289
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,080
Nice drip.

2290
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:16,760
Are these all originals?

2291
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:17,900
Those are actually really...

2292
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,600
I really like...

2293
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,340
Oh, she's cute.

2294
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,520
She's very cute.

2295
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:24,800
Who's on my team?

2296
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,760
Oh, it's...

2297
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,360
Jesus.

2298
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,660
This is the last.

2299
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,040
I believe in this.

2300
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,120
Alright, guys.

2301
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,420
We're gonna work together.

2302
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,260
Okay?

2303
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:37,780
Guys.

2304
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:41,780
In the spirit of Fortnite chapter 6.

2305
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:42,900
Guys.

2306
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:48,200
Let's all work together and kill the boss together.

2307
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,620
It'll be so natural.

2308
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:56,980
It'll be...

2309
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,020
It'll be...

2310
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,500
Guys, it'll be like...

2311
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,220
Can't believe it!

2312
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,240
In the spirit of Fort...

2313
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:09,400
Sorry, eliminate the boss together.

2314
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:14,440
In the spirit of Fortnite chapter 6.

2315
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:21,440
Somehow everybody's gonna work together and fight...

2316
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,320
Oh my god, maybe there's too many people.

2317
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:24,960
Oh my god.

2318
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:25,100
Okay.

2319
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:32,680
And if you don't find a gun, use your fists.

2320
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:33,540
Okay?

2321
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:37,920
If you have no gun, you just start fisting.

2322
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:41,060
Just start meleeing.

2323
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:43,380
Guys.

2324
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,900
It's just that easy.

2325
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:49,940
I bet we can melee her.

2326
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,160
Guys, I don't even think we need a gun.

2327
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:55,290
Guys, let's all go in and start meleeing.

2328
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:57,920
Let's all go in.

2329
01:52:58,780 --> 01:52:59,460
Screw it.

2330
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:00,500
Guys, melee!

2331
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:04,080
God, not me!

2332
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:06,480
Okay.

2333
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:14,510
Oh my god.

2334
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,130
Alright, we did it, guys!

2335
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:24,110
Oh my god, the items all got absorbed so fast.

2336
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:28,470
Alright, in the spirit of Fortnite...

2337
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:36,470
In the spirit of Fortnite, we're gonna eliminate the other bosses.

2338
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:39,290
Who's the next one?

2339
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:40,110
Who's next?

2340
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:42,730
I know there's two more bosses.

2341
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:44,630
Let's go find the other bosses, guys.

2342
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:50,850
Alright, in the spirit of Fortnite, we're gonna keep finding...

2343
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:52,410
In the spirit...

2344
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:53,850
Alright, guys, follow me!

2345
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:56,810
Follow me, guys!

2346
01:53:57,210 --> 01:53:59,170
We're gonna go find the other bosses.

2347
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:02,170
I'm tired.

2348
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:04,810
Shouldn't have died.

2349
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:06,630
Who would the other bosses be?

2350
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:09,390
That's right!

2351
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:12,870
Look at...

2352
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:14,230
Oh my god.

2353
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:18,390
God and anime is on my side now.

2354
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:22,670
Alright, guys, we gotta fill her up.

2355
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:24,250
Guys, sorry, let me...

2356
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:27,330
Oh wait, I don't need to...

2357
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:29,350
Can you guys break this for me?

2358
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:33,950
Guys, can you break this for me so I can go through?

2359
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:37,210
In the spirit of Fortnite, can you guys break the front area?

2360
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:38,050
Yeah, thank you.

2361
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:47,470
I love Fortnite.

2362
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:53,310
Where does the next boss spawn, guys?

2363
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,490
Guys!

2364
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:57,170
Who knows where the next boss spawns?

2365
01:54:57,970 --> 01:54:59,730
Who knows where it spawns, guys?

2366
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:02,350
Does anyone know?

2367
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:05,770
We gotta figure this out together, guys.

2368
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:10,690
In the spirit of Fortnite, who knows where the next boss is?

2369
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:12,250
Oh my god, a child!

2370
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:14,670
Yoink.

2371
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:21,030
Okay.

2372
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:22,170
Okay, alright.

2373
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,030
It has a seat in the map!

2374
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:26,050
That's what I'm trying to... Whoa!

2375
01:55:29,490 --> 01:55:30,510
It spawns on the...

2376
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:31,270
Alright, guys!

2377
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:35,870
Since it spawns on the third circle, we gotta wait.

2378
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:37,870
Wait, let's return a child.

2379
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:39,470
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go return a child.

2380
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:41,630
Alright, I'm gonna show you what it looks like.

2381
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:43,110
I forgot to show you guys.

2382
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,050
Alright.

2383
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:48,150
I don't say that.

2384
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:49,010
Wait, okay.

2385
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:56,850
So, like, after you find a elemental, you go over here and you go, return spirit.

2386
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:59,670
Return sprite to your home now.

2387
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:03,750
Go back to your home and then he gets absorbed.

2388
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:08,250
And you're like, go back to where you came from.

2389
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:10,390
Go back.

2390
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:13,370
Oh my gosh, I shouldn't have done that dance.

2391
01:56:13,790 --> 01:56:14,130
Hahaha!

2392
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,250
Yeah!

2393
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:19,810
And then you pick up another one.

2394
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,790
We did it, guys!

2395
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:23,550
We returned him home!

2396
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:27,350
Go home!

2397
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,770
Wait, that's the gun.

2398
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:30,690
Wait, I actually need that.

2399
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:31,330
No!

2400
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:32,430
That was bait!

2401
01:56:33,010 --> 01:56:33,610
Hahaha!

2402
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:35,530
No!

2403
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:37,150
No!

2404
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:39,470
Then they took the gun?!

2405
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:42,170
That's messed up.

2406
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:44,870
That was actually bait right there.

2407
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:45,450
Alright!

2408
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:52,630
We gotta go fill up the- Oh my god, we gotta go- Guys, I gotta go to a gas stop real quick, guys.

2409
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:53,770
I'm running out of gas.

2410
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,790
Alright.

2411
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:59,830
I gotta go to the- I gotta go refill the gas tank.

2412
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:03,530
Don't worry, I have money.

2413
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:05,730
Wait, actually, I might be short.

2414
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:07,990
Will you guys spot me some couple of dollars?

2415
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:14,090
Wait, you guys- Can you guys spot me a couple of dollars for gas, guys?

2416
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:16,250
Whoops, sorry.

2417
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:18,310
I'm actually not sorry.

2418
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:20,530
Alright.

2419
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:22,490
Don't worry, man.

2420
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:25,510
Oh my god, there's too many people alive.

2421
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:26,750
Let's go!

2422
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:29,910
Oh my god, that was a sick flip.

2423
01:57:30,190 --> 01:57:33,090
Okay, guys, guys, I need- Guys, please.

2424
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:35,710
Please, I need to fill up my gas.

2425
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:37,030
There we go.

2426
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:39,150
There we go.

2427
01:57:40,370 --> 01:57:40,770
Alright.

2428
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:42,750
Don't worry, filling it up.

2429
01:57:44,150 --> 01:57:45,430
Filling her up.

2430
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:48,150
We're fine.

2431
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:53,090
What did I say about copyright?!

2432
01:57:53,770 --> 01:57:54,670
Execute her.

2433
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:56,410
Execute her.

2434
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,390
She used copyright material.

2435
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:02,090
It's time for her to go.

2436
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:06,630
I'm not gonna do the dirty job.

2437
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:08,390
This woman right there.

2438
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:09,830
Execute her.

2439
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:11,590
Right here.

2440
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:13,630
She used copyright.

2441
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:16,770
Somebody take the shot!

2442
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:19,310
Somebody take the shot!

2443
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:21,490
Take the shot!

2444
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:23,370
Wait, where did she go?

2445
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:24,970
She's over there!

2446
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:25,710
She's in that car!

2447
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:26,770
Pull the car up!

2448
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,200
Okay.

2449
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:32,920
I'll do the dirty job.

2450
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:37,780
I can't believe you guys can't finish- Wait, they all look the same.

2451
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,360
Which one's the real one?

2452
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,260
Wait, stop!

2453
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:40,800
Stop!

2454
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:41,980
Wait, there's more than one!

2455
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,660
Wait, there- Wait!

2456
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:44,520
Stop!

2457
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:45,200
Stop!

2458
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:46,320
No!

2459
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,600
Guys, I messed up.

2460
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,460
I guess I- I- I caused anarchy.

2461
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,420
Oh no.

2462
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:58,000
Oh no.

2463
01:58:58,780 --> 01:58:59,900
My bad.

2464
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:01,600
My bad, guys.

2465
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:04,380
I didn't realize there were multiple

2466
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:11,620
That was my bad.

2467
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,880
I didn't realize.

2468
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:14,960
Oh, there he is!

2469
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:15,460
Let's go!

2470
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:16,820
In the spirit of Fortnite!

2471
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:18,020
Oh my god!

2472
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,220
In the spirit of Fortnite!

2473
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:20,640
Oh my god!

2474
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:21,260
Let me in.

2475
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,260
Okay, we gotta go here.

2476
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:26,360
Guys, next boss fight.

2477
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:27,500
Drive!

2478
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,440
It's time to show you guys the next boss fight.

2479
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:35,580
Guys, we're all heading there.

2480
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:36,940
That's right, everybody.

2481
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:37,580
Come on!

2482
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,880
I like how one guy died.

2483
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,400
I'm so sorry for that one person that died.

2484
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:47,020
Guys, why are you following the road?

2485
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,020
Why?

2486
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:51,780
Why do we have road safety right now?

2487
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,180
Ma'am!

2488
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,400
You don't need to follow the road!

2489
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,020
Drive!

2490
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:58,080
No!

2491
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:01,420
It's a car pileup!

2492
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:02,200
No!

2493
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,980
I messed up!

2494
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,500
I messed up!

2495
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:06,660
Oh no!

2496
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,140
Oh no!

2497
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:19,500
The pileup!

2498
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:27,170
Guys, this is why we follow road safety laws, guys.

2499
02:00:28,410 --> 02:00:33,970
I realized I realized why now we have traffic laws.

2500
02:00:37,190 --> 02:00:41,170
Alright, we gotta go.

2501
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:42,850
Go here!

2502
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,050
Now we gotta go here.

2503
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:44,970
This is closer.

2504
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:48,750
Which one's me?

2505
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:51,670
Okay, okay.

2506
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:52,410
Swap seats.

2507
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:53,290
Get out of the car.

2508
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,810
I'm driving.

2509
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:56,030
Get out of the car.

2510
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:58,330
You've lost your driving privileges.

2511
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:01,570
Get out of the car, ma'am.

2512
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:02,790
Ma'am?

2513
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:04,950
Ma'am, am I getting kidnapped right now?

2514
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:08,570
Where is he?

2515
02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:10,110
Where is he going?

2516
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:11,270
No!

2517
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:14,390
I was...

2518
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:17,450
Oh my god, I thought I was part of a hidden run just then.

2519
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:19,190
Alright, there we go.

2520
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:20,550
Goodbye.

2521
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:23,950
You've lost your driving privileges.

2522
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:28,150
Don't worry, it still works.

2523
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:31,430
Okay, like, I know this looks bad, but like, watch this.

2524
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:34,930
I know this looks bad, but watch this.

2525
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:40,630
Guys, I know this looks bad, but like, there we go.

2526
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:41,950
See, it's that easy.

2527
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:46,190
Guys, break the... break this.

2528
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:47,450
Guys, break this.

2529
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:49,130
Break this thing in front of me.

2530
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:56,270
Guys, break the... guys, break the rails in front... guys, break the rail in front of me.

2531
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:57,670
There we go.

2532
02:01:57,970 --> 02:01:58,590
There we go.

2533
02:01:58,730 --> 02:01:59,570
We did it.

2534
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:01,730
Oh my god, my car!

2535
02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:03,330
Okay, donate your car.

2536
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:04,510
Somebody donate their car.

2537
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:05,470
Give me your car.

2538
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:08,290
Get out of the driver's seat right now.

2539
02:02:09,190 --> 02:02:09,870
This is GTA.

2540
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:12,910
Get out of your driver's seat right now and give me your car.

2541
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:14,710
Give me...

2542
02:02:15,730 --> 02:02:16,490
Thank you.

2543
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:19,670
There we go.

2544
02:02:19,670 --> 02:02:20,470
There we go.

2545
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:21,430
We're gonna make it.

2546
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:23,110
We're gonna make it this time.

2547
02:02:25,570 --> 02:02:28,150
Alright, this time we're gonna make it.

2548
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:30,750
Alright, see?

2549
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:31,750
It's that easy.

2550
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:32,710
See?

2551
02:02:33,690 --> 02:02:35,030
We're almost there.

2552
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:40,150
Guys, don't... guys, don't kill him before I... guys, stop.

2553
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:40,770
Stop.

2554
02:02:41,050 --> 02:02:42,410
I have to be there.

2555
02:02:42,850 --> 02:02:46,790
Guys, guys, guys, I swear I have to be there.

2556
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,930
Oh my god!

2557
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:53,150
In the spirit of Fortnite, I have to be there for the kill!

2558
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:54,350
Sorry, elimination.

2559
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:55,210
Guys.

2560
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:56,610
Guys.

2561
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:02,430
Guys.

2562
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:05,050
We need to be...

2563
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:07,810
I need to be able to see it, guys.

2564
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:11,450
I need to be able to see the content.

2565
02:03:14,230 --> 02:03:14,830
That's...

2566
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:15,370
That's it.

2567
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:18,830
Oh my god, this car is like one hit away.

2568
02:03:19,870 --> 02:03:20,470
Okay.

2569
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:22,230
Alright!

2570
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:23,790
Next destination!

2571
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:26,950
Guys, next destination.

2572
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:29,850
I have to be there, though!

2573
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:32,110
I have to be there!

2574
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,590
I swear to god.

2575
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:38,830
Oh, I ran out of gas.

2576
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:40,930
Give me your car.

2577
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:42,350
Guy in front of me!

2578
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:42,910
Stop!

2579
02:03:43,890 --> 02:03:44,370
Stop!

2580
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:45,770
I'm commandeering your car!

2581
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:48,770
Guy in front of me!

2582
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:52,390
Guys, I need a car.

2583
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,090
Guy in front of me!

2584
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:54,190
You there!

2585
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:55,210
Guys!

2586
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:59,470
I need to commandeer a car!

2587
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:03,210
Get over here!

2588
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:04,390
Biker man!

2589
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:05,490
Get off!

2590
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:07,210
Biker man, get off!

2591
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:07,830
Thank you.

2592
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:10,030
Alright, there you go.

2593
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:10,990
I swear.

2594
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:13,930
I swear.

2595
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:16,450
Please!

2596
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:18,150
Please let me out!

2597
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:20,030
Okay.

2598
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:21,470
Where did my bike go?

2599
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:23,650
Where am I?

2600
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:23,950
Okay.

2601
02:04:24,190 --> 02:04:24,770
Thank you.

2602
02:04:25,170 --> 02:04:26,050
Alright, don't worry.

2603
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:26,810
We can make it.

2604
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:29,230
We can make it before it's gone.

2605
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:30,350
Alright.

2606
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:32,950
Okay, but watch this sick trick, though.

2607
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:33,550
Watch this.

2608
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:35,030
Wow!

2609
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:36,970
Look at that.

2610
02:04:38,030 --> 02:04:39,970
We can make it before it's gone.

2611
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:42,130
We can definitely make it.

2612
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:44,730
I ran out of gas.

2613
02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:46,790
Get off!

2614
02:04:47,210 --> 02:04:47,870
Give me your car!

2615
02:04:50,290 --> 02:04:52,610
Get out of the driver's seat right now!

2616
02:04:53,170 --> 02:04:54,510
And give me your car!

2617
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,890
Get out!

2618
02:04:57,990 --> 02:05:01,770
Get out of the driver's seat right now and give me your car!

2619
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:02,870
There you go.

2620
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:09,090
Alright, we're here!

2621
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:10,650
We're finally here!

2622
02:05:10,730 --> 02:05:11,630
We made it!

2623
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:12,870
Let's go!

2624
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:13,630
Woo!

2625
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:17,410
We're here!

2626
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:19,530
We're gonna fight him!

2627
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:21,010
Let's go!

2628
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:22,090
Let's fight him!

2629
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:25,110
This is a robbery.

2630
02:05:25,930 --> 02:05:26,650
Let's go.

2631
02:05:27,650 --> 02:05:28,690
Let's summon him.

2632
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:30,290
How do you summon him?

2633
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:32,050
I've never got this far before.

2634
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:35,950
Guys, in the spirit of Fortnite, how do we summon this guy?

2635
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:38,450
I'd never expect to get this far.

2636
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:40,030
I actually don't know.

2637
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:43,210
No, no, you don't do this to me.

2638
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,170
Don't.

2639
02:05:45,590 --> 02:05:47,210
I never got this far.

2640
02:05:48,650 --> 02:05:49,690
He's already...

2641
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:50,830
There's no way.

2642
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:51,830
There's no way.

2643
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:53,150
Did you guys kill them?

2644
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:55,890
Did you guys kill them already?

2645
02:05:57,690 --> 02:05:58,730
It's already...

2646
02:05:58,730 --> 02:06:00,610
Please, I need to see him!

2647
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:01,990
Please, I don't want to...

2648
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:03,090
I don't want to...

2649
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:05,510
Get the content off, guys, please.

2650
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:10,790
Oh my god.

2651
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:13,430
What do you mean it's already dead?

2652
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:15,470
What do you mean?

2653
02:06:16,370 --> 02:06:16,970
Who has a sword?

2654
02:06:17,770 --> 02:06:19,330
Drop a sword right now.

2655
02:06:19,810 --> 02:06:20,650
Who has a sword?

2656
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,290
Who has a sword?

2657
02:06:23,410 --> 02:06:25,330
Drop a sword right now in front of me.

2658
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:27,390
Who has it?

2659
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:31,150
Does anyone have a sword?

2660
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:34,150
Alright.

2661
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:36,510
In the spirit.

2662
02:06:36,710 --> 02:06:36,830
You.

2663
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:38,050
Give me your sword.

2664
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:40,290
Give me a sword.

2665
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:41,290
This is not a robbery.

2666
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:42,530
Give me your sword right now.

2667
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:43,670
You there.

2668
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:47,430
Give me your sword or I'll take drastic measures.

2669
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:51,050
No!

2670
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:52,450
Where am I?

2671
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:57,970
Where am I?

2672
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:00,050
Where's the woman with the sword?

2673
02:07:00,830 --> 02:07:02,270
Where did she go?

2674
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:05,090
They all look the same!

2675
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:06,630
There's too many women!

2676
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:09,550
Too many base form women!

2677
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:12,890
Which one is the woman I'm looking for?

2678
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:16,370
Oh, that was a cosmetic?

2679
02:07:16,650 --> 02:07:16,910
Oh.

2680
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:17,710
Nevermind.

2681
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:18,430
Alright.

2682
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:22,530
In the spirit of Fortnite.

2683
02:07:23,830 --> 02:07:26,950
Let me go up here first before I say anything.

2684
02:07:27,710 --> 02:07:29,010
In the spirit of Fortnite.

2685
02:07:30,430 --> 02:07:32,870
You must all kill each other except for me.

2686
02:07:38,930 --> 02:07:39,970
Except for me.

2687
02:07:39,990 --> 02:07:40,570
I'm safe.

2688
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:43,310
I shall watch from up here.

2689
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:46,410
Now fight.

2690
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:52,480
Now fight everyone.

2691
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:53,720
But not me!

2692
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:54,700
Not me!

2693
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:55,040
Not me!

2694
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:55,480
Not me!

2695
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:57,560
Not me!

2696
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:00,060
That's right.

2697
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,500
You all fight each other.

2698
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:03,140
Now Fortnite dance on his body.

2699
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:05,780
Now Fortnite dance on his body right now.

2700
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:06,540
This guy.

2701
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:08,840
Fortnite dance.

2702
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:10,160
It has to be the- No guys!

2703
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:10,460
Guys!

2704
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:11,040
On me!

2705
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:15,600
It's you.

02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:05,460
We can make it!

2893
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:07,560
We can make it!

2894
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:08,460
No!

2895
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,500
We can make it, guys!

2896
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,720
Just keep climbing!

2897
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:13,880
Just keep climbing!

2898
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:16,660
Guys!

2899
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:17,780
No, guys!

2900
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:18,740
No fighting!

2901
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:21,160
Think of the child!

2902
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:22,880
Think of the...

2903
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:24,420
Think of the child!

2904
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:25,360
My child!

2905
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:26,940
He's running away!

2906
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:27,880
No!

2907
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:30,420
Oh!

2908
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:32,160
He just dies!

2909
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:32,580
Okay.

2910
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:33,700
Okay, guys.

2911
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:34,440
That's fine.

2912
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:35,700
What are you trying to do?

2913
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:37,360
What are you doing?

2914
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,420
What are you doing?

2915
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:38,720
What are you doing?

2916
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:38,740
Yes!

2917
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:39,840
That's right.

2918
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:46,460
That's right.

2919
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,140
Who do you think you are?

2920
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:50,580
Who do you think you are?

2921
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,140
Alright.

2922
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:55,120
Alright, everybody.

2923
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:57,180
I need a sacrifice.

2924
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:00,380
Alright, default women.

2925
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:03,020
You know what that means.

2926
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:05,060
Oh!

2927
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:08,500
You guys had swords this entire time?

2928
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:11,020
You guys had swords this entire time?

2929
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:13,980
You guys had swords this entire time?

2930
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:17,060
No!

2931
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:25,660
How did you win?

2932
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,520
You weren't even part of the circle!

2933
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:29,660
You weren't even...

2934
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:31,500
Of course.

2935
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:36,420
He wasn't even part of the circle!

2936
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:38,040
Alright.

2937
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:39,440
We'll do one last game.

2938
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:41,840
I think my editor will be happy now.

2939
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:45,720
The guy was here like...

2940
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:46,860
Alright.

2941
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:48,360
This is a real game now.

2942
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:49,860
This is a real game.

2943
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:50,570
We're gonna do...

2944
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:52,300
We'll do duos.

2945
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:57,060
He pulled the medkit strat.

2946
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:05,440
It's a normal...

2947
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:06,500
It's a custom...

2948
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,140
But it's normal rules.

2949
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:09,720
We're not fucking around anymore.

2950
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:12,840
There's no more in the spirit of Fortnite anymore.

2951
02:19:13,060 --> 02:19:13,700
There's...

2952
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:18,880
This is real gaming hours.

2953
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:20,120
No more.

2954
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:24,740
No more in the spirit of Fortnite.

2955
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:29,080
Okay.

2956
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:30,600
Okay, we can start.

2957
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:33,080
Why can't I start the lobby?

2958
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:34,900
Wait.

2959
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:37,500
Who has the...

2960
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:38,140
Okay, guys.

2961
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,600
Somebody is queued up.

2962
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:42,080
And you got...

2963
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:44,180
If you see start match...

2964
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:46,500
Press start match, guys.

2965
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:47,840
If you...

2966
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:53,140
If you are queued up right now...

2967
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:56,900
And you see start match...

2968
02:19:57,700 --> 02:19:58,720
Start the match.

2969
02:19:59,340 --> 02:19:59,800
Guys.

2970
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:01,000
Please.

2971
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:01,240
Please.

2972
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:03,760
You were the first one there.

2973
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:04,740
Guys.

2974
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:06,780
Start the match.

2975
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:08,100
Please.

2976
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:14,500
We need you to start the lobby.

2977
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:16,060
Okay.

2978
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:16,680
Alright, guys.

2979
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,700
We're doing a new code.

2980
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:21,620
Now, it's called sponsor.

2981
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:23,380
Now.

2982
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:27,800
Now, it's just sponsor.

2983
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:28,700
Okay.

2984
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:31,560
Custom key is...

2985
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:33,920
I just deleted the E and the D.

2986
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:34,760
Alright.

2987
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:35,600
There we go.

2988
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:36,980
Wait, I don't have it.

2989
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:38,060
No, okay.

2990
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:39,280
It's just me.

2991
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:41,160
Wait, where did it go?

2992
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:46,090
Wait, where is it?

2993
02:20:46,310 --> 02:20:47,730
Why can't I start the match?

2994
02:20:48,090 --> 02:20:52,050
Wait a minute.

2995
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:53,270
Oh, no.

2996
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:54,530
I lost control of the lobby.

2997
02:20:55,870 --> 02:20:57,390
I lost control of the lobby.

2998
02:20:57,590 --> 02:20:58,990
Guys, I lost control of the lobby again.

2999
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:00,090
Okay, I'm going to type.

3000
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:00,970
Guys, I lost control.

3001
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:01,830
Alright, guys.

3002
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:02,650
New code.

3003
02:21:02,770 --> 02:21:04,330
I lost control of the lobby again.

3004
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:12,870
Okay, maybe this will work.

3005
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:16,190
Do I have it?

3006
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:18,090
I have it.

3007
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:18,690
Oh, my God.

3008
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:19,770
I got my code back.

3009
02:21:20,150 --> 02:21:20,790
I got it.

3010
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:23,570
Okay, it is editor.

3011
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:28,750
Alright, guys.

3012
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:30,150
Guys, this is a new...

3013
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:31,970
I have control of the code.

3014
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:33,370
This time, for real.

3015
02:21:33,970 --> 02:21:38,090
I have control of it.

3016
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:42,030
This time.

3017
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:43,270
He'll be fine.

3018
02:21:43,470 --> 02:21:44,970
It's like two and a half hours.

3019
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:46,970
I think he'll be okay.

3020
02:21:47,490 --> 02:21:48,430
He should be okay.

3021
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:49,650
Two and a half hours?

3022
02:21:51,930 --> 02:21:53,550
He should be fine.

3023
02:21:53,550 --> 02:21:55,550
He should be fine.

3024
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:56,530
Editor, edit this out.

3025
02:21:56,630 --> 02:22:00,630
Make it feel like I just happened to queue into...

3026
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:02,270
You know, this is not custom lobby.

3027
02:22:02,770 --> 02:22:03,850
This is, you know...

3028
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:05,410
This is just...

3029
02:22:05,410 --> 02:22:07,450
You know, a regular match.

3030
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:15,400
Alright, here we go.

3031
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:18,320
This is fine.

3032
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:21,600
Alright, 177.

3033
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,180
I forgot to start the match.

3034
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:27,500
I almost forgot to start the match.

3035
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:29,300
But we should be fine now.

3036
02:22:35,770 --> 02:22:36,850
Alright, last game.

3037
02:22:37,130 --> 02:22:37,950
Who's gonna be my duo?

3038
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:47,830
Who's gonna be my duo?

3039
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:49,010
Let's see.

3040
02:22:58,220 --> 02:22:59,180
Who's gonna be?

3041
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,080
My duo hasn't loaded in yet.

3042
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,900
Oh, this is a cute lobby, though.

3043
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,560
This is a really cute lobby.

3044
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:09,760
Oh my god.

3045
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,660
Oh my god.

3046
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:17,600
Alright, fashion show.

3047
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:19,900
Guys, fashion show time.

3048
02:23:20,380 --> 02:23:21,880
Fashion show, everybody.

3049
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,600
Show me your drip.

3050
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:25,300
Wait, that's so sick.

3051
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:30,060
Oh, wait, isn't that...

3052
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:31,220
Wait, this guy.

3053
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:32,200
Wait.

3054
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:35,380
He has a Samson skin.

3055
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:42,740
He has a rare Samson.

3056
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:44,000
He has a...

3057
02:23:45,420 --> 02:23:46,900
Oh my god.

3058
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:47,800
Isn't that...

3059
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:49,820
Isn't that super expensive?

3060
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:52,540
Alright, you pick where to go, Finn.

3061
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:57,990
Oh, whoops.

3062
02:23:58,950 --> 02:23:59,810
Okay, that's fine.

3063
02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:01,930
Mosaic that.

3064
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:04,630
You pick.

3065
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:06,210
Okay, I'll pick.

3066
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:11,330
Wherever I go, it's gonna be a little bit...

3067
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:11,930
chaotic.

3068
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:16,170
Okay.

3069
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:18,090
Mosaic that, editor.

3070
02:24:18,390 --> 02:24:19,270
I believe in you.

3071
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:21,410
I believe in you.

3072
02:24:21,910 --> 02:24:22,250
Oh, yeah.

3073
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:25,550
You can do this, editor.

3074
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:27,730
You got this.

3075
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:33,520
Isn't that skin, like, super rare?

3076
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:34,620
Guys, please.

3077
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:35,480
Please let me live.

3078
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,380
Please let me live.

3079
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:37,080
This is the last game.

3080
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:37,580
Please.

3081
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:38,500
This is the last game.

3082
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:39,500
You gotta let me live.

3083
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:40,100
Please.

3084
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:41,320
You gotta let me live.

3085
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:42,200
This is the last game.

3086
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:43,720
Please don't do this to me.

3087
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:44,440
Please.

3088
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:47,380
You gotta let me live.

3089
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,080
Give me your gun.

3090
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:50,200
Give me your gun.

3091
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:55,460
Oh my god.

3092
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,460
Oh my god.

3093
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,280
Oh my god.

3094
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:02,420
Why are you stealing my gun?

3095
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:07,680
Alright, guys.

3096
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:11,500
Guys, this is a natural lobby.

3097
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:12,820
Whoa, so natural.

3098
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:14,400
So natural.

3099
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:15,760
Wow!

3100
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:23,900
In the spirit of Fortnite, these randoms that I just happened to queue up with just happened to let me go free.

3101
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:25,560
That's crazy.

3102
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:26,880
Holy shit.

3103
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:27,980
You know what?

3104
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,920
Maybe Fortnite's not so toxic after all, everybody.

3105
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:32,200
Maybe...

3106
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:36,620
Maybe people are nice in Fortnite.

3107
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:38,000
Oh, thank you.

3108
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:38,580
Thank you.

3109
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:40,120
They won't know.

3110
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:46,830
They won't know if they see a bush here.

3111
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,670
Okay.

3112
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:51,890
Please, I need to get the band-aid.

3113
02:25:52,190 --> 02:25:55,590
Please, you are on top of the band-aid that I need to get.

3114
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:02,860
Whoops.

3115
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:04,220
No, my bush.

3116
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:05,100
My bush.

3117
02:26:05,820 --> 02:26:06,340
Guys.

3118
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,180
In the spirit of Fortnite, Oh my god.

3119
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,160
Oh, guys.

3120
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,320
It's looking a little suspicious.

3121
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:19,440
Sorry, I'm trying to get my band-aid.

3122
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:26,400
Guys, it's looking a little suspicious that, you know, we gotta weed some people out.

3123
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:29,880
So, like...

3124
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:31,600
Alright, who wants to be part of my groupie?

3125
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:35,100
Alright.

3126
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:37,660
Show me your most expensive emote.

3127
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:40,960
That's not copyrighted.

3128
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:45,460
Okay, I obviously can't kill my teammate.

3129
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:47,300
Alright.

3130
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:49,480
This is my posse.

3131
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,120
I'm gonna start a gang.

3132
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:53,640
Wait, that's...

3133
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:55,100
I'm gonna start a club.

3134
02:26:56,300 --> 02:26:57,900
Because, like, gangs are illegal.

3135
02:26:58,260 --> 02:26:59,920
But, like, I'm a very good person.

3136
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:01,080
I'm gonna start a club.

3137
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,100
It's gonna be called Club Doki.

3138
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:05,460
Okay, guys.

3139
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:06,880
Club, we love Fortnite.

3140
02:27:07,460 --> 02:27:07,940
Okay?

3141
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:09,020
Because we love Fortnite.

3142
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:12,120
And, like, we gotta say thank you to Fortnite for sponsoring.

3143
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:13,460
Anyone have shields?

3144
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:16,160
Anyone have shields?

3145
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:20,000
Guys, surely one of you guys have shields, right?

3146
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,580
Surely one of you guys have shields, right?

3147
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:28,400
Oh, there it is.

3148
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:28,780
Nice.

3149
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:30,160
Alright.

3150
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:31,900
Chug jug time.

3151
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:36,420
Alright.

3152
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:36,800
Alright, nice.

3153
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:37,560
Okay, we're fine.

3154
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:38,060
Alright.

3155
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:43,680
In the spirit of Fortnite, I gotta kill some of you guys.

3156
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:44,780
So stand in front of me.

3157
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:47,740
If you wanna be killed right now, stand right here.

3158
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:50,240
Right where I ping.

3159
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:55,040
Alright, and then, like, stand in the line after, okay?

3160
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:56,040
Alright.

3161
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,820
Wait, sorry, that's my gun.

3162
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:00,580
Alright, there we go.

3163
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:02,580
Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3164
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:03,280
No!

3165
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:04,260
Kill him!

3166
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:04,880
Kill him!

3167
02:28:07,310 --> 02:28:07,990
Get me out!

3168
02:28:08,090 --> 02:28:08,870
Get me out!

3169
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:10,050
Get the leader!

3170
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:13,420
Finn!

3171
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,180
Finn, where's Finn?

3172
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:20,550
Finn!

3173
02:28:21,310 --> 02:28:21,710
Stop!

3174
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,150
Finn, I need you!

3175
02:28:23,530 --> 02:28:23,950
Finn!

3176
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:25,470
Res me right now, Finn!

3177
02:28:28,030 --> 02:28:28,550
Finn!

3178
02:28:28,810 --> 02:28:29,250
No!

3179
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:38,750
Finn!

3180
02:28:39,570 --> 02:28:42,590
Wait, I need to report my teammate really fast.

3181
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:44,110
I need...

3182
02:28:47,370 --> 02:28:49,070
Teammate got eliminated.

3183
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:50,830
I need...

3184
02:28:50,830 --> 02:28:52,750
I need to report him.

3185
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:55,390
He got...

3186
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:57,090
No way!

3187
02:28:58,330 --> 02:29:01,150
In the spirit I need to report him.

3188
02:29:05,050 --> 02:29:07,150
What happened?

3189
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:12,070
Oh my god.

3190
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:17,910
Oh my god, they're still...

3191
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:23,020
Still here!

3192
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:26,060
They're still here!

3193
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:27,460
They're still here!

3194
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:33,520
Mr. President did not get down.

3195
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:34,400
Okay!

3196
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:43,500
Finn out there was doing a quadruple fucking flip instead of pressing E.

3197
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:47,520
Now that's the spirit of Fortnite.

3198
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:51,880
Oh my... I blame Finn.

3199
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:53,520
This is Finn's fault.

3200
02:29:59,470 --> 02:30:01,370
This is Finn's fault.

3201
02:30:04,410 --> 02:30:06,570
Finn, show yourself in my chat right now.

3202
02:30:06,730 --> 02:30:07,390
Which one's Finn?

3203
02:30:08,050 --> 02:30:09,070
I won't ban you.

3204
02:30:09,690 --> 02:30:11,010
But like, show...

3205
02:30:15,450 --> 02:30:16,650
But like...

3206
02:30:16,650 --> 02:30:17,530
Oh, is this Jesus?

3207
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:21,190
Oh my Jesus, no!

3208
02:30:24,570 --> 02:30:26,210
Which one is Finn?

3209
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:28,210
Finn, hide!

3210
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:32,150
I won't ban you, X.

3211
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:34,210
Finn, I just wanna...

3212
02:30:35,150 --> 02:30:37,390
I wanna give you a special reward, Finn.

3213
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:45,370
Anyone that... I don't know if you know this, Finn, but anyone that gets on my team gets...

3214
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:47,610
gets a special prize.

3215
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:54,680
Oh my god, is this like a... Oh wait, I really like this skin.

3216
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:57,200
It's like a Toontown.

3217
02:31:05,170 --> 02:31:06,270
I'm Finn.

3218
02:31:06,410 --> 02:31:08,110
No, I'm Finn.

3219
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:16,770
It's like those like, you know, like in the movies you're like, standing up and you committed this crime and then you're like, I did it.

3220
02:31:16,890 --> 02:31:18,710
No, I did it.

3221
02:31:18,850 --> 02:31:20,510
You can't ban us all.

3222
02:31:20,970 --> 02:31:23,450
You can't put all of us in.

3223
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:24,850
We are Finn.

3224
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:31,210
We are all Finn.

3225
02:31:39,570 --> 02:31:40,530
I'm Spiderman.

3226
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:42,690
No, I'm Spiderman.

3227
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:44,290
Wait, do you get fall damage?

3228
02:31:44,750 --> 02:31:45,690
Oh, you don't?

3229
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:47,130
Wait, that's so broken.

3230
02:31:48,350 --> 02:31:49,870
How's there 47 people left?

3231
02:31:49,970 --> 02:31:50,990
Guys, it's killing time.

3232
02:31:51,090 --> 02:31:52,250
Sorry, it's elimination time.

3233
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:53,850
Guys, it's... Shoot him.

3234
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:54,410
Take the shot.

3235
02:31:54,970 --> 02:31:55,630
Take the shot.

3236
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:57,510
Take the shot.

3237
02:31:57,790 --> 02:31:59,210
It's elimination time.

3238
02:31:59,830 --> 02:32:01,230
That's your teammate.

3239
02:32:02,290 --> 02:32:03,630
That's your...

3240
02:32:07,630 --> 02:32:08,550
Alright,

3241
02:32:14,320 --> 02:32:16,660
what's going on outside?

3242
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:22,690
Look at all these gamers.

3243
02:32:27,470 --> 02:32:29,610
Wait, those aren't...

3244
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:30,250
Take the shot.

3245
02:32:35,210 --> 02:32:36,150
That's right.

3246
02:32:36,670 --> 02:32:37,490
That's right.

3247
02:32:37,650 --> 02:32:40,210
You're no longer friends when I'm watching.

3248
02:32:41,170 --> 02:32:41,970
Take the shot.

3249
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:43,250
Dance on him.

3250
02:32:49,250 --> 02:32:50,050
That's fine.

3251
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:51,110
It was worth it.

3252
02:32:52,110 --> 02:32:52,430
What do you mean?

3253
02:32:53,210 --> 02:32:53,830
Oh, wait.

3254
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:56,370
Wait, I'm alive?

3255
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:06,600
Who's still alive?

3256
02:33:09,100 --> 02:33:10,720
Oh, that guy's still alive.

3257
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:12,680
We have...

3258
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:14,740
Why do we keep fucking...

3259
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:15,800
spectating Jesus?

3260
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:16,680
Why?

3261
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:19,340
Or is it Jesus?

3262
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:27,080
I recently learned there's like the other pronunciation of Jesus and it's Jesus, right?

3263
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:28,400
Is that how...

3264
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:30,040
Is that how you say it?

3265
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:33,040
Is that the real Finn?

3266
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:36,480
Is that the real Finn?

3267
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:37,100
Is that him?

3268
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:39,720
Where is he?

3269
02:33:55,220 --> 02:33:56,740
It was never a Finn.

3270
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,080
There was...

3271
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:05,200
There was never a Finn in this lobby.

3272
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:13,240
So he locked in.

3273
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:18,200
Erased.

3274
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:20,470
Oh my God!

3275
02:34:25,190 --> 02:34:26,670
Oh my God.

3276
02:34:27,330 --> 02:34:28,290
He just...

3277
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:30,270
He got eliminated.

3278
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:36,320
Aren't you not gonna save your friend?

3279
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:37,380
Jesus?

3280
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,120
What would Jesus do?

3281
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:41,960
Okay, apparently leave his friend.

3282
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,260
Goodbye,

3283
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:50,580
killer.

3284
02:34:56,650 --> 02:34:57,350
Goodbye.

3285
02:34:58,150 --> 02:35:01,330
Would Jesus really let his friend die?

3286
02:35:01,470 --> 02:35:01,730
Sorry.

3287
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:04,310
Get eliminated like that?

3288
02:35:04,650 --> 02:35:07,490
Is that truly what Jesus would do in Fortnite?

3289
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:10,850
Would he let his friend get eliminated?

3290
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:18,760
Jesus.

3291
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:20,400
Save him.

3292
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:21,720
Grab his car.

3293
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:24,040
They don't know you're there.

3294
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:27,560
They don't know.

3295
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:28,180
Go back!

3296
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:30,660
Go back and save your friend!

3297
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:34,720
Where are you on the map?

3298
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:39,700
Oh, we don't know where he is on the map.

3299
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:51,470
I got...

3300
02:35:51,470 --> 02:35:52,930
He came back to finish the job.

3301
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:54,870
Wait, where is your friend?

3302
02:35:56,590 --> 02:35:58,970
Could I be a Finn too?

3303
02:35:59,310 --> 02:36:01,570
Thank you, Mr. Chapman.

3304
02:36:01,770 --> 02:36:03,230
Thank you, thank you.

3305
02:36:06,450 --> 02:36:07,750
Wait, where is your friend?

3306
02:36:07,870 --> 02:36:09,670
Where did he...

3307
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:10,770
Where did he go?

3308
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:13,990
You didn't res him, so...

3309
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:15,510
I don't watch you no more.

3310
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:17,730
I only watch homies.

3311
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:20,450
You weren't a homie because you let him die.

3312
02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:22,810
Okay, editor.

3313
02:36:22,990 --> 02:36:26,390
Make sure you replace the die with eliminated.

3314
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:32,270
Okay, wait, wait.

3315
02:36:32,270 --> 02:36:33,970
I'm gonna make another sound clip.

3316
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:36,270
And then you take this audio...

3317
02:36:36,270 --> 02:36:38,790
And then replace the other audio of that moment.

3318
02:36:39,510 --> 02:36:41,850
I can't believe you let him get eliminated.

3319
02:36:42,710 --> 02:36:43,830
Okay, that should sync up.

3320
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:47,170
Alright, and then you let him get eliminated.

3321
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:49,390
Okay, you replace that...

3322
02:36:49,390 --> 02:36:51,130
With what I just said about dying.

3323
02:37:01,530 --> 02:37:02,690
What

3324
02:37:09,050 --> 02:37:10,650
is he...

3325
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:11,770
What is he trying to do?

3326
02:37:12,570 --> 02:37:15,210
I demand more eliminations!

3327
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:21,780
Jokey bird is hungry!

3328
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:26,860
She is hungry!

3329
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:30,140
She demands more eliminations!

3330
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:32,220
She is hungry!

3331
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:35,480
Oh, shit!

3332
02:37:35,620 --> 02:37:36,300
It's desktop A3W18LV!

3333
02:37:40,180 --> 02:37:41,340
I need more blood!

3334
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:45,220
That's right.

3335
02:37:50,020 --> 02:37:51,520
I demand more!

3336
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:53,080
Oh, look at these nerds on high ground.

3337
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:55,040
Okay, you guys wanna fight these nerds?

3338
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:56,080
They're like right here.

3339
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:57,840
That's where they are.

3340
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:01,240
They're literally...

3341
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:03,500
They're like right here.

3342
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:05,060
Wait, is this...

3343
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:06,900
Yeah, they're right here.

3344
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:08,540
You wanna fight these nerds right here?

3345
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:17,770
Okay, we got...

3346
02:38:17,770 --> 02:38:20,090
Alright, these guys...

3347
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:22,690
They're right over here.

3348
02:38:24,050 --> 02:38:25,870
They're literally right here.

3349
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:28,330
Look at these rats right here.

3350
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:34,170
There's these rats here.

3351
02:38:34,170 --> 02:38:36,650
That's trying to bait people into the house.

3352
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:37,770
They're like...

3353
02:38:37,770 --> 02:38:40,410
Look at this juicy loot we have.

3354
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:42,150
We have here.

3355
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:47,250
Wait, did he die?

3356
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:48,710
Wait, did I...

3357
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:51,310
Wait a minute.

3358
02:38:52,390 --> 02:38:52,870
Oh, no.

3359
02:38:53,010 --> 02:38:54,430
They're still alive.

3360
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:55,910
Okay, I thought they got shot at.

3361
02:38:56,290 --> 02:38:57,970
I thought when I...

3362
02:38:57,970 --> 02:38:59,610
Alright, they're literally right here.

3363
02:38:59,710 --> 02:39:02,350
They have to move to zone in 22 seconds.

3364
02:39:02,350 --> 02:39:04,570
So you can literally...

3365
02:39:04,570 --> 02:39:06,230
Camp outside here.

3366
02:39:06,750 --> 02:39:08,170
And then just shoot them.

3367
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:09,250
Shoot down on them.

3368
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:12,730
Nevermind.

3369
02:39:13,530 --> 02:39:14,050
Nevermind.

3370
02:39:14,170 --> 02:39:14,950
They're pussies.

3371
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:23,140
Alright.

3372
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:25,260
Let's see where these guys are going.

3373
02:39:30,130 --> 02:39:30,930
Wait, what?

3374
02:39:31,010 --> 02:39:31,930
Who are they shooting at?

3375
02:39:32,650 --> 02:39:34,610
Oh, there's a fight in front of them.

3376
02:39:34,930 --> 02:39:35,390
Yes!

3377
02:39:35,950 --> 02:39:36,410
Fight!

3378
02:39:36,410 --> 02:39:36,530
Fight!

3379
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:39,450
Give me more eliminations!

3380
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:44,770
I demand more eliminations!

3381
02:39:46,130 --> 02:39:47,210
That's right!

3382
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:50,390
Oh my god, there's a porta potty.

3383
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:56,460
Doki is hungry!

3384
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:59,380
Feed me!

3385
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:02,820
Feed me!

3386
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:05,260
I require...

3387
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:07,800
I require...

3388
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:09,800
Blood right now.

3389
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:14,980
Where is the guy that they're chasing?

3390
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:15,940
Oh, right here.

3391
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:18,220
Oh my god, carry him!

3392
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:18,980
Carry him!

3393
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:22,220
Oh, she's dead.

3394
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:23,100
Carry her!

3395
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:24,840
Do a fortnite dance in front of her!

3396
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:27,980
Do a fortnite dance in front of this girl!

3397
02:40:28,380 --> 02:40:29,900
Go back in the zone right now!

3398
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:31,220
And do a fortnite dance!

3399
02:40:31,220 --> 02:40:31,700
I'm so tired.

3400
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:38,040
Oh no.

3401
02:40:39,300 --> 02:40:41,140
Wait, why are you guys fighting in zone?

3402
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:44,400
Oh, because he has the...

3403
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:45,600
Oh, that's so smart.

3404
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:48,680
You let your homie die like that though?

3405
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:52,080
Oh my god!

3406
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:54,380
No wonder he has that skin.

3407
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:56,540
No fucking wonder.

3408
02:41:01,220 --> 02:41:02,120
That's actually crazy.

3409
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:04,060
Alright, who's still alive?

3410
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:12,340
Alright.

3411
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:14,360
Yeah, no shit.

3412
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,220
He's a gamer.

3413
02:41:17,080 --> 02:41:18,540
Oh, they're in the...

3414
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:19,500
Oh my god!

3415
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:22,680
Nevermind, anime was not on her side.

3416
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:25,340
Oh my god, anime...

3417
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:27,780
Don't worry!

3418
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:30,000
It'll be different for him, right?

3419
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:31,400
Okay, nevermind.

3420
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:36,660
Guys, I think I learned that you're not supposed to bring a sword to a gunfight.

3421
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:37,660
I...

3422
02:41:37,660 --> 02:41:39,540
I think I figured that out.

3423
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:46,560
I think I realized that...

3424
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:47,380
A sword...

3425
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:50,100
A sword in a gunfight is not...

3426
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:50,980
It's not it.

3427
02:41:51,860 --> 02:41:54,600
But how did Ice Spice do it?

3428
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:59,580
How did Ice Spice 1v4 this?

3429
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:04,920
Who would've thought?

3430
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:06,960
That's crazy.

3431
02:42:11,490 --> 02:42:12,470
Oh shit!

3432
02:42:12,690 --> 02:42:14,070
Wait, Jesus is still alive!

3433
02:42:15,230 --> 02:42:16,470
No, he got the sword.

3434
02:42:17,170 --> 02:42:18,910
He got the sword, guys.

3435
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:21,110
Oh my god, it's over!

3436
02:42:21,710 --> 02:42:23,290
He got the sword!

3437
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:32,540
Curse.

3438
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:35,700
It's a curse.

3439
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,160
Every time you get the sword...

3440
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:41,800
Bro, I wonder...

3441
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:43,760
Imagine if he just got shot right there.

3442
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:49,840
Oh my god, what's he gonna do?

3443
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:53,540
Make the child dance for me.

3444
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:57,940
I told you it's the curse of the sword.

3445
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:00,260
It's the curse of the sword!

3446
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:01,200
I told you!

3447
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:04,200
Anybody that has the sword...

3448
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:05,020
They perish!

3449
02:43:09,960 --> 02:43:11,900
Carry him and then...

3450
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:12,840
Emo on his body.

3451
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:15,000
Dance.

3452
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:17,100
Dance for him.

3453
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:19,840
Come on.

3454
02:43:20,060 --> 02:43:21,740
Come on, dance for him.

3455
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:29,880
He's like...

3456
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:30,380
No!

3457
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:31,800
No, editor!

3458
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:33,360
Edit this out!

3459
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:35,360
Edit this out, editor!

3460
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:40,100
Don't put this in!

3461
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:41,900
Don't put this in!

3462
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:45,160
Oh my god!

3463
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:46,340
Oh my god!

3464
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:47,720
It was a distraction!

3465
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:49,940
Oh my god!

3466
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:53,100
How do you feel, buddy?

3467
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:57,500
And then he's just gonna have trauma...

3468
02:43:57,500 --> 02:43:59,220
PTSD after that.

3469
02:44:03,700 --> 02:44:06,540
Oh my god.

3470
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:08,820
He survived.

3471
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:09,860
He survived.

3472
02:44:09,860 --> 02:44:12,580
He's gonna have fucking trauma after that.

3473
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:17,960
Bro, it was a honeypot.

3474
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:20,940
It was a honeypot mission all along.

3475
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:26,040
He took the shots for the team.

3476
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:28,060
In more ways than one.

3477
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:30,060
Now let the children dance.

3478
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:30,120
Let the children dance.

3479
02:44:35,960 --> 02:44:40,880
Oh my god.

3480
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:44,100
Wait, there's eight squads left.

3481
02:44:45,420 --> 02:44:46,440
Four more teams.

3482
02:44:46,520 --> 02:44:47,440
Wait, who's still alive?

3483
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:54,300
Me, I'm still alive.

3484
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:56,900
And then there's...

3485
02:44:56,900 --> 02:44:58,060
Oh, the bush people.

3486
02:44:58,480 --> 02:44:59,760
Guys, you wanna know where the bush men are?

3487
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:04,560
Where is this?

3488
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:10,540
Nevermind.

3489
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:12,620
I guess they ran off.

3490
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:20,120
Oh my god, he got a car.

3491
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:21,540
Wait, he had a car?

3492
02:45:21,620 --> 02:45:23,300
He like parked a car there?

3493
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:24,760
Run him over!

3494
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:26,280
You know you want...

3495
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:27,220
Aw, coward!

3496
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:28,920
Cowards!

3497
02:45:31,360 --> 02:45:32,360
Jesus Christ.

3498
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:37,240
Oh my god!

3499
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:39,000
Oh my god!

3500
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:43,280
Oh my god, they're gaming.

3501
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:45,700
There's no... they're fucking gaming.

3502
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:47,800
They're freaking gaming right now.

3503
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:49,420
Oh, nevermind, he's dead.

3504
02:45:50,660 --> 02:45:51,440
Unless...

3505
02:45:51,440 --> 02:45:52,480
He's jumping?

3506
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:54,740
Child dance.

3507
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:58,920
Gamer moment right there.

3508
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:03,120
Wait, how did the flamingo live?

3509
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:07,700
Goodbye, child.

3510
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:08,380
No!

3511
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:09,620
He ran away!

3512
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
The child ran away!

3513
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:14,980
He like booked it!

3514
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:17,100
He actually...

3515
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:19,320
He just booked it!

3516
02:46:27,690 --> 02:46:29,250
Alright, who's still alive?

3517
02:46:30,670 --> 02:46:32,010
Who the heck is this guy?

3518
02:46:34,570 --> 02:46:36,130
Who is... he has no...

3519
02:46:36,130 --> 02:46:36,730
Oh, there you go.

3520
02:46:36,870 --> 02:46:37,510
Pokecraft.

3521
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:39,610
Oh, he's a solo.

3522
02:46:39,610 --> 02:46:39,870
Hello!

3523
02:46:41,210 --> 02:46:41,890
That's me!

3524
02:46:43,350 --> 02:46:45,410
Someone do a drive-by and shoot him.

3525
02:46:48,110 --> 02:46:49,150
That's me!

3526
02:46:50,790 --> 02:46:53,350
Oh my god, he did do a drive-by!

3527
02:46:55,890 --> 02:46:57,590
Was that worth it?

3528
02:46:58,110 --> 02:47:00,250
Was that worth it?

3529
02:47:00,750 --> 02:47:01,090
Hello!

3530
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:03,750
Goodbye!

3531
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:08,830
I don't think that was worth it.

3532
02:47:08,910 --> 02:47:10,630
What did I do?

3533
02:47:11,070 --> 02:47:12,390
What do you mean?

3534
02:47:13,330 --> 02:47:15,150
Oh my god, the flamingo.

3535
02:47:16,210 --> 02:47:17,410
Goodbye, flamingo.

3536
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:22,240
Wait, what?

3537
02:47:24,820 --> 02:47:26,740
Oh, is it 1v1?

3538
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:29,460
Oh my god, it's a 1v1v1!

3539
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:31,220
It's a 1v1v1!

3540
02:47:31,220 --> 02:47:32,020
It's a 1v1!

3541
02:47:33,100 --> 02:47:35,940
Oh my god, he did it for him!

3542
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:38,440
He did it for him!

3543
02:47:43,290 --> 02:47:45,290
Oh my god!

3544
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:48,070
They did it!

3545
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:50,550
He did it for that guy!

3546
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:56,490
The honeypot to victory!

3547
02:47:56,750 --> 02:47:58,790
The backshots for the win!

3548
02:47:59,130 --> 02:48:01,030
It was all for him!

3549
02:48:03,930 --> 02:48:05,830
Oh my god, that was so fun!

3550
02:48:07,930 --> 02:48:09,310
That was so fun!

3551
02:48:09,750 --> 02:48:11,050
Thank you for the superchat!

3552
02:48:11,170 --> 02:48:12,170
Thank you!

3553
02:48:12,310 --> 02:48:15,370
I can't believe this is a sponsored stream.

3554
02:48:16,030 --> 02:48:19,110
Honestly, I had so much fun today.

3555
02:48:19,530 --> 02:48:21,410
Honestly, the whole day was incredibly fun.

3556
02:48:21,850 --> 02:48:22,810
Thank you for the superchat!

3557
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:23,530
Thank you!

3558
02:48:23,690 --> 02:48:24,790
That was fun!

3559
02:48:24,870 --> 02:48:25,590
Yeah, it was!

3560
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:27,090
Thank you all for playing with me!

3561
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:28,990
I really appreciate it, guys.

3562
02:48:28,990 --> 02:48:33,450
Thank you again to Fortnite and Epic for sponsoring the video.

3563
02:48:36,990 --> 02:48:38,310
He offended me!

3564
02:48:38,650 --> 02:48:39,910
Hashtag Flamingos!

3565
02:48:40,030 --> 02:48:41,590
Thank you for the superchat!

3566
02:48:42,310 --> 02:48:43,430
Thank you!

3567
02:48:43,890 --> 02:48:51,070
Huge shoutout again to Fortnite and the Epic Games for sponsoring me.

3568
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:52,810
We're going to have a video highlight.

3569
02:48:52,910 --> 02:48:54,850
I'm actually curious on how this is going to look.

3570
02:48:55,350 --> 02:49:00,650
There might be like, you know, off-stream content in there depending on how it's...

3571
02:49:01,270 --> 02:49:06,390
on what we need and what we need that I didn't provide from the stream.

3572
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:09,590
But, I had a great time.

3573
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:13,450
It's actually crazy to be sponsored to play a game that I really enjoy.

3574
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:18,530
And if you guys didn't know, I have a creator code so you guys can support me via other means.

3575
02:49:18,590 --> 02:49:20,790
If you like buying Fortnite cosmetics, this helps a lot.

3576
02:49:21,250 --> 02:49:23,670
It just basically gives me a percentage of some of the...

3577
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:27,830
So like, instead of it going all the way to Epic, it actually goes...

3578
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:29,290
A percentage of that goes to me.

3579
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:30,930
So yeah, this is like...

3580
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:32,150
It's just Doki Bird.

3581
02:49:35,070 --> 02:49:37,690
But yes, it was incredibly fun.

3582
02:49:38,150 --> 02:49:39,930
Thank you everybody for coming today.

3583
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:42,710
Thank you everybody for watching this morning with Minecraft.

3584
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:46,730
And for watching today for the Fortnite sponsor.

3585
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:49,470
It really does mean a lot, everyone.

3586
02:49:49,970 --> 02:49:51,910
I'm going to go head off now, guys.

3587
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:53,710
But thank you all for watching.

3588
02:49:54,050 --> 02:49:56,090
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3589
02:49:56,730 --> 02:49:57,310
Posture check.

3590
02:49:57,610 --> 02:49:59,030
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3591
02:49:59,130 --> 02:50:00,930
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3592
02:50:01,050 --> 02:50:02,430
Cause you deserve it.

3593
02:50:02,970 --> 02:50:05,330
It was great seeing all the new changes.

3594
02:50:05,710 --> 02:50:09,190
And the guns being hitscan is so cool because I'm really bad at projectile.

3595
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:11,490
So I love the hitscan update.

3596
02:50:12,190 --> 02:50:14,910
Cause like, I can only use hitscan guns.

3597
02:50:15,150 --> 02:50:18,330
I don't know why.

3598
02:50:18,370 --> 02:50:21,670
My mind is not wired to figure out how projectiles work.

3599
02:50:22,030 --> 02:50:25,730
So like, for me, it's really fun to be able to shoot hitscan guns.

3600
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:31,810
Because like, it's like my best, my strongest strength in shooting games.

3601
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:39,210
So yeah, and I loved all the new cosmetics and the outfits that they have in the newest map with the newest island.

3602
02:50:40,330 --> 02:50:43,190
With the different locations they added.

3603
02:50:43,470 --> 02:50:44,270
And the boss fights.

3604
02:50:44,710 --> 02:50:45,810
And the cosmetics and everything.

3605
02:50:45,990 --> 02:50:46,630
So thank you again.

3606
02:50:47,090 --> 02:50:48,530
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3607
02:50:48,850 --> 02:50:50,090
Bye guys!

3608
02:50:50,570 --> 02:50:51,490
Bye!
