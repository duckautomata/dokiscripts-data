1
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,660
It's 12.30.

2
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,080
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,300
I'm still waking up, guys.

4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,260
I don't know why I'm playing Cassidy right now.

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm not even going to be playing DPS.

6
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,520
Guys, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,180
I'm still...

8
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,620
My brain is still...

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:38,140
waking up I can never do 1230 streams because my brain is
always waking up I don't even know if the sound volume's

10
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:55,060
okay is my sound guy here is he here all right let me make
sure my sound is like not too loud all right let's see all

11
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:04,700
right look at this like gold gun okay guys i might have like
clickbaited you guys because i'm okay to be fair it is

12
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:15,360
master's rank but it doesn't mean this account is masters it
just means that i i will get i'll definitely get into master

13
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,560
games i just this account might not be masters but the
player base is not as high as it once was that like there is

14
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:41,060
a potential that i'll get into masters games um because one
one i found out i found out that like uh not today like

15
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:52,600
recently that like uh masters five is uh also i don't know
if it's too loud can't tell masters five is the threshold

16
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:03,540
for support to hit top 500 and i heard a lot of players are
like sort of low-key hard-stuck masters at the moment which

17
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:11,440
is very surprising like i was looking at streams and a lot
of players are like in masters like a lot of like the good

18
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,550
players i used to know back then are like in the masters elo
at the moment i was like what the fuck

19
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:36,840
i was like damn okay and um and then and then so i was like
oh wait i'm gonna be griefing top 500 players oh okay wait

20
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:45,440
because i was like okay i do have an account that has but
like obviously i'm not going to be playing on that account

21
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:55,360
because um i used to be good hence the word hence the past
tense but now i've been playing like other games like bunny

22
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
garden and like that so

23
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:12,540
so like i don't know how how like bunny garden and flight
simulator so like i don't know how well that translates back

24
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:23,160
to overwatch these days so i was just like um so so i was
like okay maybe i shouldn't play on the grandmaster account

25
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,200
i was like all right maybe i should do something that has a
master's mmar at first i was like all right i'm just gonna

26
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,500
rank up this account to masters and just go from there but
this is my main account by the way i haven't touched this

27
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,320
main i haven't

28
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:50,560
years with rank so because of that they had a hard reset in
rank um from over they had a hard reset from like overwatch

29
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,100
one to overwatch two um i mean like it's not like super okay
maybe not hard reset a soft reset uh so like i did

30
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:08,600
placements on this account and then um i did placements on
this account and then I did uh I uh yes this is the

31
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,920
Overwatch 1 account so like this this is actually this is
actually like the main main account and I was like usually

32
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,800
in the past I'll be like oh I don't want to tape this
account because uh this account is so sacred it has like you

33
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:34,600
know it has these it has all of these sprays you know oh my
god look at that you can tell it's the main account Oh, the

34
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
sprays are animated.

35
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,140
Whoa.

36
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,700
Holy shit.

37
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,120
Look at that.

38
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,340
The sprays, they move.

39
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,860
So for those who are not familiar with the Overwatch rating
system, the spray moves because I was top 500, so you get a

40
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,740
moving spray.

41
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,220
So I was like, usually in the past...

42
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:13,600
past Tokyo be like no don't taint this account because
because that's your top 500 account don't play on it but

43
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:23,380
like all my top 500 records have been fucking erased because
they erased Overwatch 1 top 500 leaderboards so it doesn't

44
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:34,380
matter anymore it doesn't matter anymore I don't I don't
care I didn't get top 500 in Overwatch 2 on this account I

45
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,320
did it on a I did it on a brand new account.

46
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,760
So, like, this account doesn't have the Overwatch 2 Top 500.

47
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,220
So, it doesn't matter to me.

48
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,320
Plastic, thank you for the magenta soup.

49
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,660
Thank you, thank you.

50
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,220
Are you uploading to Flats right now?

51
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,420
What's the Flats right now?

52
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't watch, I don't watch Flats.

53
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm sorry.

54
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,140
Thank you for the magenta soup.

55
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,620
Thank you, thank you.

56
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,820
He used to cry in Overwatch Rank.

57
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,660
I bumped into him a lot in Overwatch Rank.

58
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,960
But I don't watch his YouTube content.

59
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Because his YouTube content.

60
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,000
He's like.

61
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,000
Like.

62
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,620
What are the reasons?

63
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,420
The Plants is really good at gaming the algorithm.

64
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,740
And like.

65
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,420
Making videos that like.

66
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,240
Majority of the Overwatch players like to watch.

67
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,060
But like.

68
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm not majority of the Overwatch players.

69
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,280
I just watch Rank.

70
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,240
Like I don't care.

71
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,720
I would, right, and also, like, these days, I don't even
really watch Overwatch Rink streams.

72
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,820
And I only watch, like, I only watch, like, Shure 4 playing
Rink, because I think it's funny when he loses.

73
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,450
I'm not, like, other girls.

74
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,190
I just watch Shure 4 play Overwatch Rink, because I just
think it's funny.

75
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,730
And I guess, like, Ruben, too, sometimes.

76
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,230
Because he's a friend.

77
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:17,570
I don't think sound guy's awake guys sound guy is not as
awake as me so how has the how how has the sound been uh

78
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,370
chat yeah I think that's like the only Overwatch content
I've been watching the last couple of months like it's

79
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:32,750
literally just sure for it mostly um I'm like trying to
think have I watched anybody else I mean I watched like like

80
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:44,610
I guess like 10 like five minutes of Aspen meta i was like
she's a support player like i was like i was like all right

81
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,170
let's see what's meta okay i need i need to know what
support meta is and now i was just like all right aspen's

82
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:57,950
the support player is the best way to figure it out watch
the watch the support player to see what meta is call that

83
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,170
uh but i haven't like actually watched overwatch content i
think like by the time flats became an overwatch content

84
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,610
creator i've stopped watching overwatch because i used to
watch of watch content but like i like but that was like

85
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:21,350
past doki very very past doki also you might be like oh my
god doki why is your name on the left side kitsune um they

86
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:28,310
have like a streamer mode now where your name changes every
game thank fucking god for that because that actually is a

87
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:39,670
lifesaver because like uh i i was like a little bit
embarrassed Okay, no, okay, this is also the reason why I

88
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:47,270
stopped caring about, like, my rank on this account,
because, like, there's streamer mode now, so then I was just

89
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:54,330
like, and it changes every game, so every game, um, your
name changes on the bottom left, which is a fucking

90
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,890
lifesaver, especially if I have private profile, so they'll
never know, that's me, uh, but, like, I was a little

91
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:13,530
embarrassed in Diamond Yilo, I was, I was a little, I was a
little embarrassed being just a little bit embarrassed being

92
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:27,990
in diamond elo on this account so I had I was like oh they
must never know they must never know um no way you're

93
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,230
actually good in video game I was good in video games we
don't know anymore

94
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:49,210
anymore all right um let me ask like an oh wait is my are
any of my mods on that's a good question wait are any of my

95
00:11:49,210 --> 00:12:00,590
mods on what do you mean it was okay there's a reason why
i'm on streamer mode i am a bit embarrassed also like uh

96
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,730
ruben asked if we wanted to do i'm gonna play a couple of
solo games first and then if i if i d rank because i'm

97
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:17,090
actually like on the line between diamond one and diamond
two so like if we i won't join voice though i won't join

98
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:27,830
voice call but if we d rank we're calling in reinforcements
which is like so we have like three games at least of solo

99
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,230
we have three games of solo at least okay

100
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:45,630
so so that'll be it we're gonna try our best so yeah anyway
we're gonna be queuing support d1 support and then if we get

101
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:53,950
to masters then yippee uh but anyway you're gonna see what i
mean regardless of what rank i am at the moment because i'm

102
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:01,330
in d1 i will automatically get not automatically but
majority of time i'll be in master games so like in the end

103
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:09,390
i will throw i will fucking get somebody out of top 500 if
it's and that's all that matters chat that's all that

104
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:16,490
matters we're not playing cassidy i just like i just like
warming up in uh like i just like the sound and hitting the

105
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:24,150
headshots in uh in the training range on cassidy because
it's not as fun on any other character it's only on it's

106
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:40,400
only fun on cassidy um all right let's see i think my i have
like a backup sound guy right uh all right all right i have

107
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:49,380
a backup sound guy so i'm gonna check also like next week by
the way guys next week uh i tweeted about it but next week i

108
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:57,300

gonna have a rest week but like it might not end up being a

109
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,040
rest week because there's a lot of stuff going on next week

110
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:12,220

you'll see why You'll see You'll see why Alright Oh my god

112
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,200
Why do I hear myself?

113
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,020
Why do I hear myself?

114
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,360
Do I have a stream up?

115
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:42,420
my god where's the stream oh okay sorry sorry guys i had a i
had my own stream open and i was like what the fuck who is

116
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:57,940
that bitch that voices okay here we go we're gonna start all
right uh so yeah i am going to all right guys i'm i'm a

117
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:05,460
little embarrassed of showing you my my profile right now so
I'm gonna change my icon as well

118
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,660
I just need you guys to know I had a really some really
rough games while trying to see if I could speedrun the

119
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:28,780
masters and like I had some I had but you can this is the
main account these are all the icons I have so so

120
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm just saying I got like a little embarrassed.

121
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,400
Okay, look.

122
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm also like, look, see, it changes every time.

123
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Guys, it changes every time in the name.

124
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:52,460
So like, I got, okay, so the reason why I'm a little
embarrassed is that, um, I thank God I'm private profile.

125
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,520
But like, anyway, uh, thank God is, thank God.

126
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,140
This is when I used to be good.

127
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:16,000
so you get these are all the top 500 icons so like this is
when i was i used to be decent at the game and and this is

128
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,320
what i was complaining about like you see the icon that used
to be really pretty and they started being just guns and i

129
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:31,680
was like this is so ugly and then it was like so tiny too
This used to be like the top 500 icon in season 24 and I was

130
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,400
like so ugly compared to like This this was like actually so
pretty to have and then and then later on they're like oh We

131
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:48,180
should add the top 500 icon logo so people will know it's
top 500 so like at first there was no top 500 icon logo but

132
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,340
it's just a golden gun and it was so fucking ugly and then
yeah I miss when

133
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:07,480
And now it's just like the tag the gamer tag Which was only
available for like one season or something Yeah, so like

134
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,260
they had to make a lot of them that they ran out of maps
Which is understandable, you know They actually ran out of

135
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,820
maps for the top 500 icon

136
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:34,700
And back then top 500 was actually hard to get guys okay
back then top 500 was hard to get because there was an

137
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:47,940
actual player based chat so he can't say that it wasn't
actually pretty difficult because it wasn't masters it

138
00:17:47,940 --> 00:18:04,320
wasn't masters anyway so like the reason Another reason why
I am, uh, uh, the reason why that, like, uh, I am a little

139
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,760
embarrassed of showing my profile at the moment is because
the most played hours on it is Kiriko, but I have a solid

140
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,760
30% win rate on Kiriko at the moment because every time
we're losing, I just swap to Kiriko.

141
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:33,520
Kiriko for like you know okay because like they're okay
because but because it's like well I we're losing I might as

142
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:42,680
well practice Kiriko you know that's like that's like my
mindset going in I'm like well we're losing anyway so I

143
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:51,480
think it's like a good time to practice so that's all right

144
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:02,060
like it's a it's a good time to practice her since like she
is meta so i might as well but i do play kiriko sometimes

145
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:10,000
when i don't when i'm not losing so like the moments when i
win on kiriko is when i like is when like i automatically i

146
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,360
pick her out of like first hand not because like you know i
was why is there a what the how many fucking okay this is

147
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,720
why i need to warm up oh my god i missed like 20 shots it's
because they're not training bots so like it was It's...

148
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,300
Oh, the falloff damage, too.

149
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,140
That's insane.

150
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,320
Where are they?

151
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,120
I hear them.

152
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
I hear you!

153
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,660
Oh, okay.

154
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,360
So what do you usually play?

155
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,660
I like Anna.

156
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,000
Anna's like the most fun, but then Anna also requires aim,
which like, I don't know if I have right now, because I'm

157
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,860
still...

158
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm still waking up, guys.

159
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,260
Like, please, Vera, let me have this one!

160
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:51,960
Oh!

161
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,600
This is bullshit.

162
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,520
I don't know if I have the aim at the moment for Anna
because I'm still warming up.

163
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,400
This is different.

164
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,560
They're not training dummies.

165
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,860
They actually move.

166
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,780
They actually...

167
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,100
These people move.

168
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,620
Nice, I'll take that.

169
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,760
Jesus Christ, a fallout.

170
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,100
There you go.

171
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,740
They're not like training dummies where I know the pattern
of their movements.

172
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,440
These people actually have strafe patterns.

173
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,020
Hello?

174
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,280
The people are.

175
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,560
Oh, please.

176
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,980
Please be nice.

177
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,940
Okay, thank you.

178
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,420
Killing the AFK.

179
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,320
That's right.

180
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,480
I gotta take what I can get, guys.

181
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,020
I'm that desperate.

182
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,540
What the fuck is this?

183
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,860
Look at that Cassie falloff damage.

184
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:07,420
Holy No, bro, respect the 1v1 Okay, we're gonna bring,
alright, we're AFK now too We gotta bring down the game

191
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,020
I swear, if it was not 1252, I hit those.

192
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,140
Guys, guys, I'm just saying, you should see me in night
queues, okay?

193
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,480
In night queues is where I shy.

194
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,840
I swear In night queues is where I shine

195
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:14,820
I hit so many shots in night queues I swear to God I'm not
fucking with you guys I'm not coping You should see me in

196
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,740

197
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200

i i swear when we the moment we hit the night cue time hours
i'll be like pop pop headshot headshot it's just we're we're

201
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:58,560
we're at a rough place I hear if it weren't for your
parents, you'd be as much an outlaw as me.

202
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,880
I know I say that, and I should definitely not play Anna
right now.

203
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,900
I should not.

204
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Have mercy.

205
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,500
I just woke up.

206
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,400
Breezy, thank you for the super chat.

207
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,780
Thank you.

208
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,680
Thank you.

209
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,460
Please.

210
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,300
It's just a little rough.

211
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,740
Look, see, it changes.

212
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,640
The name changes and everything.

213
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
So I'm like, I'm okay with...

214
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,920
Copium in this natural habitat.

215
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,320
So he's thinking of this to be just not copium.

216
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,840
It's a scientific fact.

217
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,120
Look, see, I hit those.

218
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,740
Okay, we don't hit those, but it's because he was strafing.

219
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,440
So like, I got confused, you know?

220
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,380
You know, and like...

221
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,320
Oh my gosh.

222
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,000
Ah!

223
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Shit!

224
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,160
Oh, I fucking might die, though!

225
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,080
I told you I!

226
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
I hit those!

227
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,400
Bitch!

228
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Oh, you see I hit both tracer shots too!

229
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,700
You guys didn't believe me.

230
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,630
I'm slowly waking up.

231
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,340
I'm slowly waking up.

232
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,700
This is me and my natural habitat.

233
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,660
I have you.

234
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,400
Keep fighting.

235
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,620
There.

236
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,580
Nobody believes.

237
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,120
leave me until I did a fucking sick-ass shot on the tracer.

238
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,040
There we go.

239
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,240
Oh, that's not my fault.

240
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,200
If you die, we have a Kiriko.

241
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,560
We also have a Kiriko.

242
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,980
That is not my fault.

243
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,880
Please get rid of this fucking tracer.

244
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,420
Polish, am I the only one that hits the tracer?

245
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,060
It's okay.

246
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,420
We get like, we get like three free games.

247
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
And then if we derank, we'll call in the reinforcements.

248
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,420
Oh, God.

249
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
I think I might go Zen, actually.

250
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,040
You know what?

251
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,240
Alright, it's fine.

252
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,260
It's fine.

253
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I'm believing you!

254
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,740
And he's at time!

255
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,320
Okay, okay.

256
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,240
Bro, okay, come on.

257
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,380
Alright, we're gonna help save our fucking junker real fast.

258
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,920
Whoa!

259
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,580
Okay, never save your junker.

260
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,260
Junker.

261
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,340
Never say Junker.

262
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,080
Okay.

263
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,820
I'm gonna go Sinjar everyone.

264
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,240
Okay, here we go.

265
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,400
Here we go.

266
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,420
This will work.

267
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,260
I swear.

268
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,220
Never.

269
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,960
I have the most healing.

270
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,440
You guys cannot be like, Junkie, heal your teammates.

271
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,780
I literally have the most healing out of both teams.

272
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Like, look at that.

273
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,200
He's so scared of me now.

274
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,000
Look at him.

275
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,480
He's so fucking scared.

276
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,380
Okay, there you go.

277
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,640
Alright, we don't have cleanse.

278
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,360
We're so fucked.

279
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,900
You're so fucked.

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,160
Never say I'm washed.

285
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,860

It's fine.

474
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,700
He didn't need my ult.

475
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,840
I saved my ult for next fight, guys.

476
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,260
That was intentional.

477
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,520
Because I knew he would clutch this.

478
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,500
This was the same guy where his shit was bugging.

479
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,900
It was the same guy.

480
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,740
Don't butterfly him.

481
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,340
Oh my god.

00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,400
Please.

483
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,500
This is how much I believe in him.

I believe in you.

485
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,740

00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,480
Picanto, you got this!

487
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,100
Picanto!

488
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,440
Where is he?

489
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,100
Wait, where is Picanto?

490
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,140
There he is.

491
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,780
Look at that.

492
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:45,760

00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,360
This man deserves it.

495
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,620
Cool guys, don't look at it.

496
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,740
Don't look at maids.

497
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,180
But then I missed.

498
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,640
Maybe I should start looking.

499
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,120
Okay, we're fine.

500
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,440
See?

501
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,120
We are so fine.

502
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,020
We're so healthy.

503
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,860
Look at that.

504
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,930
They didn't see.

505
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,970
The condom did not see.

506
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,810
He didn't see.

507
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,390
Okay, that was a little embarrassing.

508
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,010
Big antsy.

509
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,090
Always believe in Picanto.

510
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,790
Guys, look.

511
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,450

I've warmed up in everything.

513
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,870
What the fuck is he doing here?

514
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,310
Oh my god, what are they all doing here?

515
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,010

00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,430
He actually has...

518
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,730

I realized I was like, my mic was too low a bit when that
was a little too low.

528
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,330
Every game, I just, I get one mistake.

536
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,480
Guys, guys, there is actually a chance we might lose.

537
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,800
There's...

538
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,380
It's crazy for me to say, but we live in a world where we
could actually lose.

539
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,980
Oh, look at that!

540
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,720

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,580
Okay, we're fine.

543
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,820
We're okay.

544
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,500
I'm gonna swap off, because, like, I am not playing.

545
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,840
into this.

546
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,940
I'm not playing Anna into this.

547
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,140
No, fuck that shit.

548
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,640
This is too much.

549
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,800
This is too much.

550
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,080
I refuse to heal through a Sigma shield.

551
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,260
Alright, Kirko.

552
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,380
Guys, it's not because we're losing them swapping to Kirko.

553
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,120
It just makes sense.

554
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,660
I hate playing Anna against Sigma.

555
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,020
Okay, guys.

556
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,380
It's not because I'm giving up.

557
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Guys, it actually makes sense to play Kiriko in this
scenario.

558
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,480
Wait, we should fucking push up because...

559
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,280
Yeah.

560
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,500
Oh.

561
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,940
There we go.

562
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,280
See?

563
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,180
Look at that.

564
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,020
We're slowly but surely raising our Kiriko win rate.

565
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,720
Look at that.

566
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,560
I told you, it makes sense to play Kiriko.

567
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,300
This was my first death, by the way.

568
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,000

Our insurance was not ready.

576
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,520
So we play another.

577
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,460
Alright, we need to slowly warm back up or aim anyway.

578
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,340
That's fine.

579
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,860

Oh, God.

00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,690

There we go.

620
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,670
Oh, no!

621
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,770
Who expected the fourth party?

622
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,250
Who expected that?

623
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,930
You know, I'm inspired now.

624
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,170
I'm not inspired.

625
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,970
I haven't played Tracer in so long.

626
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,470
Guys, it's been a while since I played Tracer.

627
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,670
Oh, God, not against Kierkega.

628
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,670
Playing against Kierkega with Tracer is like playing against
my character.

629
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,450
Oh god, that's scary.

630
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,830
Oh, it's like one headshot away.

631
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,770
Oh, please have mercy.

632
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,090
What's that?

633
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:30,930
I see here, Lucio.

634
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,910
Okay, full regen.

635
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,310
Because I don't know my map health packs.

636
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,630
That's the only reason to play Tracer.

637
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,930
You know where all the health packs are, but I don't.

638
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:42,570
That's the thing.

639
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,510
Oh.

640
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,090
No!

641
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:48,970
Here we go.

642
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,770
I take those.

643
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,390
I'm desperate.

644
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:56,870
I'm desperate.

645
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,610
No!

646
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,210
No!

647
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:03,750
Okay.

648
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,830
Where is...

649
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:06,390
It's okay.

650
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,330
I'm rank 1 in deathmatch.

651
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,270
Guys, don't talk to me unless you're rank 1 in deathmatch.

652
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,010
Where the fuck is he?

653
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,650
Oh shit.

654
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:15,710
Okay, watch this.

655
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,470
Whoa, Sombra.

656
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,010
Oh, no, I don't have Blinks anymore.

657
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:24,750
No.

658
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,150
No.

659
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:29,950
No.

660
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:31,910
I got...

661
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,710
Bro, there was three people.

662
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,670
Does anyone get the license plate?

663
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,150
It's not fair.

664
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,610
There was, like, three.

665
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,210
I'm one tracer.

666
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:45,750
Oh, my God.

667
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,230
Why is it all Kirko's?

668
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:47,870
Please.

669
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,010

They don't know.

689
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,130
They don't know.

690
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,410
Oh god.

691
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,190
Oh god.

692
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,310
They don't know.

693
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,490
They don't know I'm here.

694
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,210
I need a regen because I don't know where the health packs
are.

695
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,710
I don't know where the health packs are.

696
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:35,950
Bro!

697
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,490

Okay, nice.

699
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,070
I got the Kiriko kill.

700
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,710
She's just watching.

701
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,770
It made me...

702
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,250
It gave me performance anxiety when he just started
watching.

703
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:49,590
Like...

704
00:51:49,710 --> 00:52:02,370
I don't know what to do Oh thank god It's okay We in the
game We in the game Actually a hunting party

705
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:14,790
They were judging me They were looking at me It happens to
all of us Can I play Mercy?

706
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:21,650
Guys Do I get my one my one mercy game

707
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,390
yes have I proven myself enough to have one mercy game

708
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:44,710
look I get I get one mistake and one mercy game do I can I
not can I not try anymore

709
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:48,910
crack now.

710
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,570
You say that and then you get, like, you get, like, two guys
yelling at you because you're playing Mercy.

711
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,110
Playing Mercy would be the mistake.

712
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,510
Guys, sometimes a support player just want to play Mercy,
okay?

713
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,430
They just want to play Mercy and just relax, alright?

714
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:14,890
Guys, I need you to know that that sometimes people just
don't want to aim and that's why Mercy and Brigette was

715
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,350
born.

716
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:16,530
That widow?

717
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,270
That's why I don't I personally don't like this map if they
have a good widow.

718
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:22,250
Oh.

719
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,550
Oh, he fucking dead.

720
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,170
Okay, I should play Kiriko.

721
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,650
I'll save the Doom and then I'm going to swap the Kiriko
because we need a cleanse.

722
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:38,570
Alright.

723
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,030
Guys, it's not because we were losing.

724
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,910
It just makes sense to play Kiriko.

725
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,270
Okay, guys.

726
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,310
Sometimes I play to pick Kiriko because it's...

727
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,410
It makes sense.

728
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:50,530
Alright.

729
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,070
He was just pepper spraying me so I was just like, whatever.

730
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:02,190
Guys, there are moments when I pick her because she just was
the character to play.

731
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:05,710
Alright, we're fine.

732
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:06,850
We're fine.

733
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,230
Even if we lose, we have a demotion protection.

734
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,810
Oh my god, please.

735
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:14,950
Please.

736
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,950
Do one damage.

737
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,090
Oh, guys, it's fine.

738
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:21,890
I'm alive.

739
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:22,530
I'm alive.

740
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,270
I am... I am not alive anymore.

741
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:26,230
I'm alive.

742
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,050
Please tell me you're not DOOM 1 trick.

743
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,770
Please tell me you're not DOOM 1 trick because we really
need you to be somebody else.

744
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,230
They are hard counting you, my dude.

745
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,310
They are hard countering you.

746
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,230
Oh, thank God.

747
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,570
Oh, thank God.

748
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:47,470
Okay, they missed.

749
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,190
Are you serious?

750
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,630
Okay, that was a mistake.

751
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,630
I swear to God, please just be alive.

752
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:02,690
This is all I want.

753
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:03,630
Be alive.

754
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:04,930
He has all.

755
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,470
Winston has all.

756
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:08,610
Winston...

757
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:09,970
Why are you there?

758
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:11,450
Why are you there?

759
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,030
All tombs are...

760
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,730
Not anymore.

761
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,150
There's just tombs that, like...

762
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,310
Oh.

763
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:18,750
Okay.

764
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,710
All right, they wasted that.

765
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:22,450
That's good.

766
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,350
That's good.

767
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,250
They wasted the all.

768
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,210
They wasted it all.

769
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:26,910
We're fine.

770
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,210
Yeah, there's structures there now.

771
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,030
There's new stuff.

772
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:34,810
There's so many new things.

773
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,150
It's okay.

774
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,030
It's okay.

775
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,390
Maybe our doom.

776
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,270
Maybe our doom will swap.

777
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,350
Oh, thank fucking God.

778
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,070
I honestly never expected him to swap, but thank God.

779
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,690
Also, nobody talks in Overwatch anymore.

780
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:51,830
It's actually sad.

781
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,990
Everyone just plays the game.

782
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:54,890
There you go.

783
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,770
That's how you're headshot.

784
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,750
Wait, I think he still has all.

785
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,710
I don't think he's expected to get burned that quickly.

786
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,030
Look at that.

787
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,350
Look at that headshot.

788
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,010
Oh, look at that.

789
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,930
That was not a headshot, but look at that, though.

790
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,830
Jesus Christ, please.

791
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,350
There's too many flankers.

792
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:14,930
Okay.

793
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:16,810
Alright.

794
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:32,470

00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,170
It's okay.

798
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:55,170
As long as I don't publicly say the toxic stuff to them,
we're fine.

799
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,510
Like how trash this Tracer is.

800
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,990
He should uninstall this game right now.

801
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,130
But it's okay.

802
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,330
Please, Bap!

803
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,970

Oh my Yeah, it's okay.

We have rank insurance later This is the reason look it's
not me that I have a 30% win rate It's not my fault that I

806
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:51,170
have a 30% win rate on Kierkega It's just it's unwinnable
I'm in an unwinnable scenario like He's only 14 years old

807
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,670
It's look I swear to God.

808
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:01,390
It's not a me issue when it comes to Kiriko

809
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:10,450
I swear to God My team my team is just

810
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:28,630
Let's just say say they could be held back a grade let's
just say that i'm out here skipping five grades my teammates

814
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:16,430

had one of my friends call me like a heal bot on Kiriko

815
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:25,830
because all I do was like heal instead of like dpsing um and
then i like 1v1ed them on kiriko and then i fucking shit on

816
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:36,050

818
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:47,710
i was like well fuck you who said i'm a heal bot on kiriko

819
00:59:53,790 --> 01:00:00,370
It's not my fault that my team keeps fucking dying so I
can't DPS like it's not my fault

820
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:14,970
Okay, look that okay, I might have missed shots there But

822
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,010
It's different.

823
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,070
I'm not a heal bot on Kiriko.

824
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,310
Alright, I can also DPS too.

825
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,170
But like I need to win the game so I can't fucking try to
prove a point at the moment.

826
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,010
Because I need to make sure my team's alive.

827
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:39,450
Like I said, it's not my fault that I'm healing so much on
Kiriko.

828
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,630
Like I have to keep them alive.

829
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,170
Look, I have to keep him alive!

830
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,570
Oh my god, I swear, please poke please.

01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:36,610
Headshot.

844
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:37,630
Boom.

845
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:39,390
Climb the wall.

846
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:40,410
Headshot.

847
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:41,510
Boom!

848
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,870
There you go.

849
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:43,910
Easy.

850
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,910
Oh god.

851
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:46,770
Oh.

852
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,150
Oh god.

853
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,750
Oh god, alright, we're fine.

854
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:54,310
Everything is okay.

855
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:59,110
Everything, the most, we're totally gonna lose this.

856
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,390
Wait, wait, wait.

857
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,450
I actually have...

858
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:07,670
Wait!

859
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,970
No, we're totally gonna lose this.

860
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,790
I'm going in with zero confidence here.

861
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:16,410
I honestly do not...

862
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,230
not think that this is winnable.

863
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,070
Unless I do have my rush.

864
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,330
Yeah, Masters is top 500 now.

865
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:28,710
If you're in Diamond, I think Masters is Diamond 5.

866
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,230
Or Diamond, not Diamond 5, Diamond 1?

867
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:32,010
Maybe?

868
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,550
Maybe Diamond 1?

869
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,110
It's okay!

870
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,530
I'm protecting you!

871
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,150
Everything will be fine!

872
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:49,050
Are you fucking... I... I can't I can't believe it.

873
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:51,170
My rush got fucking eliminated.

874
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,270
My rush actually got eliminated by a hack.

875
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,590
Oh god, this might be where I die.

876
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,410
This might be where I die.

877
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:05,650
Oh god.

878
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:06,510
Oh.

879
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:09,830
I'm that good.

880
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:10,650
I didn't need rush.

881
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,830
I'm so good that I don't even need rush.

882
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,710
You got this.

883
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,050
Who the fuck needs rush?

884
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:21,730
I'm that good.

885
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,070
Never judge me.

886
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:23,670
I have to...

887
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,750
Okay, don't look at this, though.

888
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:25,810
Don't look at this.

889
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,870
Look at the heals.

890
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,410
I am not a heal bot.

891
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,050
I am not a heal bot.

892
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,310
But I kept my team alive.

893
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,690
I'm the same.

894
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,710
I'm not a heal bot on Kiriko.

895
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:43,670
Guys, I'm not a heal bot on Kiriko.

896
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:47,430
I had more damage than our BAP on Kiriko.

897
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:50,950
That's so different.

898
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:52,350
It's okay.

899
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,750
We have rank insurance now.

900
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,710
We have rank insurance.

901
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,150
We don't.

902
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:03,850
We don't talk about our fucking accuracy.

903
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,270
Not a heal bot.

904
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,390
Look at the...

905
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,350
That's different.

906
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:14,970
I had to heal that much because my team was dying.

907
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,150
Look, we're slowly but surely raising our...

908
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:19,970
Kiriko win rate, guys.

909
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:26,590
One, thank, welcome to, welcome back to Tamayo Fire, welcome
back.

910
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,970
Um, straight, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank
you, guys.

911
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,150
Guys, okay, look, in Overwatch is actually not a compliment
what I found out.

912
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,770
how do I know?

913
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,690
I've surprisingly been called a heal bot on Kiriko.

914
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,970
Not, not just once.

915
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:51,230
Like, it was like heal bot quote unquote derogatory

916
01:04:54,930 --> 01:05:06,430
so i so unfortunately that's how i know the heal bot is not
the way to go why is it that bad because when you're playing

917
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:16,650
kierko the issue you're supposed to put in the dps as well
when you're playing kierko too but like i apparently i i I

918
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:22,870
do not put in enough TPS for them to be happy about it.

919
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,210
Yo, yo, how you guys doing?

920
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,430
Holy shit, he's loud.

921
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:28,090
Give me a sec.

922
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,710
We're gonna, I'm gonna have to adjust the fucking thing.

923
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,450
All right, give me a sec.

924
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,690
We gotta adjust, how do you adjust the fucking volume?

925
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,850
Is there like individual volume sliders?

926
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,550
Oh my god, that's so loud.

927
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,130
Oh my god.

928
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,830
Okay, wait.

929
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:55,030
voice chat oh is it because like voice chat volume is like
i'm putting at 75 there we go guys i'm not throwing i'm not

930
01:05:55,030 --> 01:06:06,290
throwing it's my time wait i'm a sombra oh my god okay
there's no reason to play mercy with sombra tracer with two

931
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:17,510
flankers there's no reason guys i'm not picking kyrko i'm
not picking Kiriko because I'm throwing.

932
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,430
It's because cop-wise, I have to.

933
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,710
Sometimes you just have to play these characters.

934
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,070
But it doesn't mean you're throwing.

935
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:29,890
Thank you.

936
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:33,750
It's just not...

937
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,210
Oh, please, Ruben, you are my rank insurance.

938
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:42,350
If I start losing without rank insurance, what does that say
about my insurance?

939
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:46,790
Okay.

940
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,410
All right.

941
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,770
Okay, we have Anna.

942
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,150
Okay, we have two flankers.

943
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,470
You can't blame my team.

944
01:06:54,490 --> 01:07:01,030
Everybody's playing, everybody playing the required
character, except for our DPS, which is unfortunately like,

945
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,110
you know, what we need good DPS.

946
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,310
I should have avoided this, Sombra.

947
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,310
I should have avoided this, Sombra.

948
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,090
There's rank insurance now.

949
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:12,730
Yes, my rank insurance is called having a duo.

950
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,630
That's my rank insurance.

951
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,670
Look, I did have a pause.

952
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,750
Is he still holding it?

953
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:25,650
He's still holding it.

954
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,630
Is my head peeking?

955
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,490
We're fine.

956
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:27,930
We're fine.

957
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:29,030
See?

958
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:29,770
We're okay.

959
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:31,830
We're okay.

960
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:33,590
All right, we're all here.

961
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:34,270
Look.

962
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:35,770
Oh my god, thank god.

963
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:36,950
He's playing soldier now.

964
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,270
Oh, thank god.

965
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:38,610
Okay.

966
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,070
All right, and then he died.

967
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,770
But that's okay.

968
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:44,830
It's okay.

969
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:45,510
He's dead.

970
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:46,690
Okay.

971
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,530
All right.

972
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:50,670
This is fine.

973
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,550
They used coffee and they used rush.

974
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,570
I think I won more being solo.

975
01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:01,870
I'm just all I'm saying is that I won more games playing
solo.

976
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,730
We'll be able to walk out of spawn.

977
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:04,730
It'll be beautiful.

978
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:09,690
All right.

979
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,690
Wait, I think I can like chill now.

980
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:16,070
We have Ana, we have Soldier and we have Ash.

981
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,370
Nice.

982
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:18,350
Alright.

983
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,510
This is it.

984
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,010
Here's my rush so I can swap later.

985
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,450
It's okay.

986
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:24,490
It's just on Reuben.

987
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,510
It's fine.

988
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,190
He's fine.

989
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,370
Look, he's so healthy.

990
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,090
Look at that.

991
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:30,790
He took two.

992
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,390
Oh, and then our soldier died.

993
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,050
Oh, and then our other DPS died.

994
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:34,470
Okay.

995
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,050
This just wasn't the game.

996
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:42,030
This is just not the game.

997
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,550
This is just not the game.

998
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:44,910
This is just...

999
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,110
It's her news.

1000
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:49,530
It's alright.

1001
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,230
We're just...

1002
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,890
We were not meant to win this.

1003
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,790
It was canon.

1004
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:56,270
It was fucking...

1005
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,710
Yo, I can...

1006
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,910
I can recontest with flex.

1007
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,530
It was just canon.

1008
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,230
It was just...

1009
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:08,170
No, he's not!

1010
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,930

She did it.

1062
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,480
She did it.

1063
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:14,680
She did it.

1064
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,720

It's fine.

1070
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,400
The hero we all deserved.

1071
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,920
She got her one kill.

1072
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,140
We did it.

1073
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,340
Now I don't have the damage booster anymore.

1074
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:39,760
Oh my god.

1075
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,920

I am not okay.

1078
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,000
Oh my god.

1079
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:44,640
Two kills!

1080
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,000

1081
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:46,520

1082
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,960
Never doubted you for a second.

1083
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,100
What the fuck was that Rhine Shatter?

1084
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,600
It was called Optimism.

1085
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,900

We're in a stage of it's fine and it's not fine.

1104
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,700
But it'll be fine.

I win these.

1111
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:07,780
That's a crazy thing.

1112
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,260
All right, let's see.

1113
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,480
I'm going to play.

1114
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,480
I'm going to play Kiriko.

1115
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,340
On land, I would have won that.

1116
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:27,420

I don't think he's fine.

1123
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,180
I don't think he was fine.

1124
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:06,160
That means because I refunded my mercy, because I refunded
my mercy, that means I get to play mercy next game because I

01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,140
Guys, maybe Mercy was like 100% not the pick.

1143
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,740
He's slamming me.

1144
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,720

Not a heal bot.

1163
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,280
I have less damage than our Ana.

1164
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,040
But I was also playing...

1165
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:31,540

01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,130

It's fine.

1182
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,190
Oh, it's not fine.

1183
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:10,510
I ran away.

1184
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:12,950
Oh, no.

1185
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:15,250
It's okay.

1186
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,010

as our Anna.

1190
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,890
That's all I'm saying.

1191
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,330
I'm not saying that our Anna was bad.

1192
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:01,230
I'm saying that I'm really good.

1193
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:11,670
I'm just saying I was pretty good with that fucking damage

Um, yeah, our hogs did.

1209
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,830
Our fucking tracer was AFK.

1210
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:43,890
I'm tired of all the realism shooters, like the...

1211
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,070
What was it?

1212
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:47,370
Like, the PUBGs and the Tarkovs.

1213
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:51,150
I just want, like, more of, like, non-realism shooters.

1214
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,930
Realism shooters just die so fast.

1215
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,330
It's just not fun for me.

1216
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,030
Why is there a floating orb?

1217
01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:58,970
No!

1218
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:00,530
No!

1219
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,130
What?

1220
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,650
The ride is a floating orb!

1221
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,150
I don't check that!

1222
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,790
I literally can't see the ride!

1223
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,770
I'm like, no!

1224
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:12,210
It's back!

1225
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,090
It's fine.

1226
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,230
The ride is a floating orb!

1227
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:21,830
the ride.

1228
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:25,070
I actually can't see the ride.

1229
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:31,010
What is this bug?

1230
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:35,970
That bug only existed when my drives were crashing.

1231
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:37,790
Oh no.

1232
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:42,210
I actually can't see where the ride is.

1233
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,390
That's so bad.

1234
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:50,130
I'm sorry I can't see the ride.

1235
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,410
Holy shit.

1236
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:54,110
I don't see this.

1237
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:55,390
What is this bug?

1238
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:58,310
I haven't had that bug.

1239
01:22:58,530 --> 01:22:59,410
It's so large.

1240
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,170
It's just orbs.

1241
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:01,770
Okay.

1242
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,050
We can also kill Ryan.

1243
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:08,290
Oh, if I don't know where that ride is, I'm sorry.

1244
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:09,990
I'm sorry.

1245
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:12,090
I can't see him.

1246
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:18,030
I... That's a dead body.

1247
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,070
Okay, we know that.

1248
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,830
I can't actually...

1249
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:38,870
don't know what this is so bad this is actually so bad oh my
god okay oh no i i'm gonna assume the ride heart is with the

01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:51,710

1251
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:56,790
Oh.

1252
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:58,710
He has played.

1253
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:00,230
He has played.

1254
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:01,130
He has played.

1255
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,030
He has played now.

1256
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,570
I got sled by our fuckiana.

1257
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:11,270
What the fuck is this bug?

1258
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:12,490
It's alright.

1259
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:14,010
This is...

1260
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,990
This is a little awkward.

1261
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:20,110
This is...

1262
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:20,450
Wait!

1263
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,250
I'm an orange too!

1264
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:25,190
Guys!

1265
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:35,290
At least I can see the Rhine now.

1266
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,130
I can see the Rhine.

1267
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:38,310
It's fine.

1268
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:42,410
I can't see anything else.

1269
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:44,790
But I can see the Rhine though.

1270
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,010
It's just Genji, Manoblady.

1271
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:46,970
You can't die fast.

1272
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:49,330
You're kidding.

1273
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,830
It's okay.

1274
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:52,990
I can see the ride now.

1275
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:54,610
Guys, I can see.

1276
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,350
It's actually a really big one.

1277
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,010
Yes.

1278
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:02,410
And they all just...

1279
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:04,010
Oh my god, I was going to say.

1280
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:07,390
Guys, I don't think my rank insurance is working, guys.

1281
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:12,570
I have realized my rank insurance is absolutely not working.

1282
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:18,190
I'm an or.

1283
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:34,830

1284
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:49,550
Guys I'm losing with the rank insurance I think I might need
a refund It might need a refund My insurance has like I was

1285
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:54,450
winning more As soon as I got rank insurance, I think I got
sold a scam.

1286
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:58,130
Guys, as soon as I got rank insurance, I've been losing
games.

1287
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:01,390
People are turning into orbs.

1288
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:09,650
Things was not going so well for me.

1289
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:17,630
Oh my god, I see my hands.

1290
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,130
Holy shit.

1291
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:23,350
I can see my arms now!

1292
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,770
This is it!

1293
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:27,190
Alright.

1294
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:30,150
I'm not saying Ruben's scammed me.

1295
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:32,650
We've got a rock win and we win.

1296
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,870
That's it.

1297
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,150
Not saying.

1298
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:43,630
I hope I can see you right.

1299
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:45,750
Tank who's 14 and 10.

1300
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:47,490
Alright, here you go.

1301
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,370
I refuse.

1302
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,950
I refuse to lose to that guy.

1303
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:56,710
To be fair, one of our DPS has like 11 deaths.

1304
01:26:58,210 --> 01:26:59,810
All right, there you go.

1305
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,130
We're not orbs anymore.

1306
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:02,870
We're not orbs anymore.

1307
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:03,810
This is it.

1308
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,310
Guys, they're on Rhine and Zen again.

1309
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:07,490
We're not orbs.

1310
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,630
But somebody's an orb.

1311
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,530
All right, this is a little awkward.

1312
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:17,670
Oh, this is so awkward.

1313
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,890
Where is the Rhine?

1314
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,250
What?

1315
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:26,890
Where's the big, fucking fat ride?

1316
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:28,890
I'm the most worried.

1317
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:32,610
I think the most worried part is...

1318
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,670
Is I'm scared.

1319
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:35,430
I'm fucking...

1320
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:36,790
I won't be able to see the pin.

1321
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,750
I will not be...

1322
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,810
I 100% will not be...

1323
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:47,610
I definitely will not be able to see my fucking ride.

1324
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,830
Wait, big, big, big, big, big.

1325
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,650
Someone else to step on the point.

1326
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:58,350
There you go.

1327
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:01,450
Oh, that's so easy.

1328
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:02,790
I'm gonna go for the Ana.

1329
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:06,510
Where are you, Ruben?

1330
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:07,530
Where are they?

1331
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:10,450
Oh, what is this fucking bug?

1332
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:13,530
What?

1333
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,010
Oh, no, what is he?

1334
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:18,110
What is he?

1335
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,610
What hero is he?

1336
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,490
Okay, do him.

1337
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,270
Okay, all right, Doom.

1338
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:24,650
Okay.

1339
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:26,590
What is that, Firewall?

1340
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:27,430
Thank you.

1341
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:33,030
Okay.

1342
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:34,310
We don't...

1343
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:35,050
It's that ride.

1344
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:35,990
That's ride.

1345
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:37,350
That's...

1346
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:42,210
Okay.

1347
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,670
I'm gonna hope everybody will be fine.

1348
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:47,110
Wait, what is that?

1349
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,730
What is that?

1350
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,490
Is that a Doom?

1351
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:51,370
I'm still here.

1352
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:52,750
Just give me a sec to...

1353
01:28:52,770 --> 01:29:02,270
I might need to restart my game.

1354
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:05,230
I might need to restart my game.

1355
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,510
I might need it.

1356
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:08,990
Oh my god.

1357
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:13,990
I couldn't even see the orb.

1358
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:18,090
I'm restarting game.

1359
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:19,930
Oh my god.

1360
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:22,650
I'm one game away from the right game.

crazy all right here we go we'll be fine this time this time

1369
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:14,270

drives aren't my drives are not crashing i know that for

1370
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:22,830
sure because like last time Last time when we had Orbs in
Overwatch, it was because, like, my PC was fucking dying.

1371
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,250
This is still not the...

1372
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:29,090
I'm not using my new PC yet, because I haven't had time to
set up my new PC.

1373
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:30,430
But, like, okay.

1374
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:34,090
Your storage space, this is probably being used by something
else.

1375
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:35,890
Check Task Manager.

1376
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,150
Oh, no.

1377
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:40,070
How bad is my storage space right now?

1378
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:41,250
Can't be that bad.

1379
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:42,930
Yeah, it's not even that bad.

1380
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:46,270
It's not, like, my storage space is at 41%.

1381
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,270
What the fuck?

1382
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:50,190
I just hope my PC isn't great.

1383
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:51,210
Same thing happens.

1384
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:51,750
The mod up.

1385
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:53,170
Very common on my...

1386
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:53,990
Oh no.

1387
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,170
Is it...

1388
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:56,830
Is it...

1389
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:57,870
Is it my game?

1390
01:31:58,570 --> 01:31:58,970
Is it...

1391
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:01,610
Is it...

1392
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:02,430
Is it my PC?

1393
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:02,850
Well no.

1394
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:03,390
Well no.

1395
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:03,870
Well no.

1396
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:04,670
It's my PC.

1397
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,270
If everybody's orbs again here.

1398
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:07,130
But thing is.

1399
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,290
I play so much.

1400
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:09,530
I think it's because I'm streaming.

1401
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,990
Maybe it's because I'm streaming that the games are getting
rough.

1402
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:13,130
Like...

1403
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:18,310
Is it me?

1404
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:18,530
Is it me?

1405
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:20,370
Am I the problem?

1406
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:25,430
Am I the issue here?

1407
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:26,990
All right, no worry.

1408
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,710
Well, no.

1409
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:29,150
Well, no.

1410
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:31,570
I got my refund so I can play Mercy again.

1411
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,270
I got my refund, guys.

1412
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:34,970
Is everybody loaded in?

1413
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:36,310
Everybody's loaded in.

1414
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:37,150
It was not me.

1415
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:37,990
It was a game.

1416
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:39,250
Look, see?

1417
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:40,730

1418
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:43,030

01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:45,910
See?

1423
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:46,870

01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:47,750
There's a...

1425
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:48,630

I fucking knew it wasn't me.

1429
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:54,850
It's never me.

1430
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:56,150
It's never me.

1431
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:02,010
About checking the archives.

1432
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:04,410

I'm so good at plans, dude.

1469
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:05,030
I might be a genius.

1470
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,890
Guys, it's not me.

1471
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:14,390

1473
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:28,650
Oh my god.

1474
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:34,270
Guys, this is why you don't play.

1475
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,650
This is why...

1476
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:37,270
Mercy...

1477
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:38,170
I say whatever you want about Curie.

1478
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,650
All I'm saying...

1479
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:44,650
All I'm saying is that...

1480
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:46,970
Playing Mercy is pretty rough.

1481
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:54,990
Look, it's my team.

1482
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:58,490
Mercy is only as good as the team.

1483
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:01,010
Alright.

1484
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:06,830
I hope the Echo dies.

1485
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:08,030
That's all I'm saying.

1486
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:13,690
I hope the Echo dies.

1487
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:17,990
Holy shit.

1488
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:19,310
I'm just getting targeted.

1489
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:22,250
I'm 100% getting targeted.

1490
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,410
There's no way.

1491
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:27,670
There's no way I die every time.

1492
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:30,390
They have nothing because they also just use high noon.

1493
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:30,930
Oh, wait.

1494
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:32,830
Did I, like, res that?

1495
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:33,990
Maybe I should res that.

1496
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:34,530
Should I wait?

1497
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:34,890
No.

1498
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:35,870
Oh, they probably have high noon.

1499
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:36,950
I'll just wait.

1500
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:38,650
All right, I'm going to go maybe.

1501
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:40,650
I'm just going to walk on this sick.

1502
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:42,670
I'll go do the echo.

1503
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:44,250
Something a horrible person would do.

1504
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,750
But it would be a shame if the echo dies.

1505
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:47,290
Oh.

1506
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,870
It'll be a shame

01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:08,650
He dies with a pocket He fucking dies with a pocket.

1510
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:10,190
You can't save him.

1511
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:11,570
Oh my god.

1512
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:21,430
Holy shit You can't heal stupid If he dies with a pocket,
you can't fucking save him!

1513
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,410
I knew it wasn't me.

01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,160
Can't climb your way out of this.

1677

This sucks.

1680
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:39,340

We'll be fine.

1740
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,260

01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:26,260
This is it!

1781
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:28,440
I saved my cleanse for that one moment!

01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,380
The one streamer moment!

1784
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,880
I did it.

1785
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:35,900

1786
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:37,940

01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,620
I should not do that.

1789
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:43,720
I could have got hooked.

1790
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:47,640
I almost got hooked there.

1791
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:49,820
Bad rush.

1792
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,380
Oh god.

1793
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:53,340
Oh god.

1794
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,250
Oh god.

1795
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:57,460
No!

1796
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:02,660
Please, go let them flip it!

1797
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,580
Do not let them flip it!

1798
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,400
Hit your shots!

1799
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:08,200
The soldier didn't hit the shots.

1800
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,660
The soldier didn't hit the shots.

1801
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:12,440
Oh my god, I'm anti-knife, I can't.

1802
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:14,400
Not like this.

1803
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:16,490
Not like this.

1804
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:19,660
Don't get hooked!

1805
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,720
No, he doesn't hook.

1806
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:23,900
He has no hook.

1807
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,120
See?

1808
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:30,300
Ana, please.

1809
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:32,800
Ana, he can jump back up.

1810
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:34,500
They can jump back up.

1811
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,220
Ana, please.

1812
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:37,480
Please.

1813
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:40,700
He knows how to jump.

1814
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:41,740
Ana, no!

1815
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:44,340
No!

1816
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,020
He's one?

1817
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:49,820
Ana, why would you be there?

1818
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,840
They know how to jump!

1819
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:00,620
There you go.

1820
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:05,040
Don't say it's over!

1821
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:07,740
Don't say it, guys!

1822
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,800
It can't be over yet!

1823
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:12,380
Maybe I'm just an Ana bot.

1824
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,070
Maybe I'm just an Ana one trick, you know?

1825
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:16,340
Because...

1826
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:19,820
I could just be an Ana one trick at this point.

1827
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:26,460
I feel like I've had more success as Ana.

1828
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,640
I can't believe it.

1829
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:32,720
I do better when I'm on Ana than any other character.

1830
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:36,480
Alright, no more getting picked.

1831
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:38,020
Yeah.

1832
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,540
Whoever gets picked, we blame for the entire game.

1833
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:41,860
Oh god, I'm gonna run away.

1834
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:43,260
I'm gonna be here.

1835
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:45,420
I'm gonna position myself away from everybody.

1836
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:49,600
Alright.

1837
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,980
Feels like sunlight, huh?

1838
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:53,520
I'm going to not keep the attack.

1839
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:56,480
Yeah, I'm going to save my cleanse for our aunties.

1840
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:57,960
No hinder.

1841
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:00,000
Ooh.

1842
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,860
Don't die, guys.

1843
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:06,640
Whoa.

1844
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:07,360
Whoa.

1845
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,420
You're doing that thing.

1846
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:10,760
Oh, no more.

1847
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:11,780
Dropping and dropping and dropping.

1848
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:12,400
You're dropping.

1849
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,040
But our DPS needs help.

1850
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,420
I'm on point with Hogg, by the way.

1851
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:18,800
Oh, God.

1852
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,640
Oh, God.

1853
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,800
Wait, what the fuck?

1854
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:26,880
No way!

1855
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,360
Daughter!

1856
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:30,120
I had just thought my Ana's got this!

1857
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:30,920
This is winnable.

1858
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:32,380
No, you actually should be winnable.

1859
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:32,980
I come back to him.

1860
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:34,640
Oh, God.

1861
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,020
Oh, God.

1862
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:39,160
Really good today.

1863
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:40,180
Alright.

1864
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:42,860
Oh, my God!

1865
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:46,280
We still have one more fight, though, guys.

1866
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:49,700
We still have one more fight, and he's on Doomfest, and he's
not in Orville.

1867
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:50,360
Okay.

1868
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:50,960
Okay.

1869
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,740
There's still one more fight.

1870
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,860
There's still one more fight.

1871
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:57,900
I gotta keep our...

1872
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:00,540
I gotta keep our DPS alive.

1873
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:04,080
I'll do him half.

1874
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:05,840
Praise on me.

1875
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,080
This is fine.

1876
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:12,020
Cleanse!

1877
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:14,800
Cleanse!

1878
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:16,320
Alright, no throwing.

1879
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:16,980
Got you!

1880
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:17,520
I got you!

1881
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:18,060
I got you!

1882
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:19,540
I got you!

1883
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:22,680
It's so winnable!

1884
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:26,960
I'm just that good!

1885
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:32,260

1890
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:44,500

What's the point of cleansing?

2009
02:08:44,850 --> 02:08:46,750
Oh my god!

2010
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:51,210
What's the point of cleansing if he just eats it?

2011
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:59,310
Oh my god, I hope it was at least delicious.

2012
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:02,550
Oh my god.

Okay, we needed maybe a Zarya there.

2023
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:33,910
We need maybe for Zarya Symmetra.

2024
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:36,990
That's, um, honestly could have gone worse.

2025
02:09:37,530 --> 02:09:38,370
We just do better on offense.

2026
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:39,130
It's okay.

2027
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:41,170
We'll do better on offense, right?

2028
02:09:41,630 --> 02:09:42,690

2033
02:09:47,150 --> 02:09:47,650
It's okay.

2034
02:09:47,790 --> 02:09:51,610
As long as I'm throwing other people's top 500 games, I'm
fine with that.

2035
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:58,630
As long as I'm give it and take it, hundreds from people,
I'll be fine.

2036
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:01,090
We're an offense team.

2037
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:03,510
We're an offense team, guys.

2038
02:10:04,190 --> 02:10:04,870
This is it.

2039
02:10:07,050 --> 02:10:09,090
We're just an offense team.

2040
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:10,450
This was our legacy.

2041
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:14,550
This was what we're meant to play as.

2042
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:18,150
Like, we were just meant to be...

If he plays fucking Zarya, I wouldn't have to!

2056
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:24,230
We should just win this for three.

02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:39,050
Look at that.

2065
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:40,470
See?

2066
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:42,210
I knew we were in...

2067
02:11:42,210 --> 02:11:44,550
I knew we were in an offense team.

2068
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:48,730
Okay, I'm gonna fucking cap.

2069
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,730
They don't need heals.

2070
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:53,990
They don't need heals, guys.

2071
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:54,730
We're five.

2072
02:11:56,750 --> 02:12:03,470
All I'm saying is that now that we have Zarya, I don't need
to play.

2073
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:05,670
I don't need to play Kierko anymore.

2074
02:12:06,090 --> 02:12:08,250
Because the Zarya bubbles is our cleanse.

2075
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:11,210
We have tank cleanse.

2076
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:15,190
So I can play whatever I want.

2077
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:16,430
Oh my god.

2078
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:17,270

Remember when I said I'm going to counter the win-thun?

2137
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:39,450
I did not predict a ult.

2138
02:15:42,610 --> 02:15:43,090
Okay.

2139
02:15:44,090 --> 02:15:47,790
I can't stop a fucking monkey ult.

2140
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:48,950

02:15:51,590 --> 02:15:54,270
I can't stop a monkey ult.

Alright, okay, hear me out.

2145
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:00,410
Okay, I can't swap.

2146
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:01,290
I should build an ult first.

2147
02:16:01,610 --> 02:16:04,030
I'm gonna build this ult first, and then we'll swap.

2148
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:06,810
Monkey too strong.

2149
02:16:08,170 --> 02:16:10,050
It was just unlucky.

2150
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:13,170
I'm gonna protect this Ana, though.

2151
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:17,130
I'll protect people.

2152
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,750
Don't worry.

2153
02:16:18,830 --> 02:16:20,050
I'll protect my team.

2154
02:16:21,530 --> 02:16:22,390
I'm gonna fall scarred.

2155
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:24,630
I'll be here with Yonkart.

2156
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:27,790
Oh shit.

2157
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:29,370

02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:30,330

02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:34,170
Please.

2161
02:16:34,650 --> 02:16:36,910
I thought the auto wouldn't look at me.

2162
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:38,230
It's okay.

2163
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:38,790
Guys.

2164
02:16:39,070 --> 02:16:39,910
It's okay, guys.

2165
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:40,470
It's okay.

2166
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:42,090
It was just...

2167
02:16:42,090 --> 02:16:43,210
Okay, maybe it's not okay.

2168
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:44,570
Maybe it's...

2169
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:48,950
Maybe it's not okay.

2170
02:16:49,690 --> 02:16:50,970
Maybe it's not okay.

2171
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:52,110
I shouldn't be swapping.

2172
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:52,750
Look.

2173
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:53,510

Morris the pick.

2175
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:56,150
The plan isn't working.

02:16:56,930 --> 02:17:04,810
I realized that like maybe I need to know how to play break

We're a gamer experience right there.

2240
02:21:42,580 --> 02:21:45,000
There's so just one bottom right.

2241
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,160

02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:51,100

Doom absolutely dies.

2248
02:22:22,300 --> 02:22:22,860
He has no block.

2249
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:23,860

02:31:34,410 --> 02:31:36,000
I won't troll chat.

2362
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:36,840
For reals.

2363
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:45,880
Yeah, queues are fast.

2364
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,120

02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:52,420

It sets the sun sets.

2368
02:31:57,560 --> 02:31:59,620
This was when I used to be good.

2369
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:07,180
This was when people wouldn't target me because I was a
V-tuber.

2370
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:15,700
Alright.

2371
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:20,700
The old animated sprays.

2372
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:22,200
Guys, I'm only losing.

2373
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:25,600
I'm only losing because people are targeting me.

2374
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:26,940
Say no now.

2375
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,860
I used to win because I wasn't a V-tuber back then.

2376
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:33,320
be nicer to me.

2377
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:37,200

2378
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:37,960
Okay.

2379
02:32:39,220 --> 02:32:40,360

02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:43,360
Oh my god, it's another...

2381
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:45,340
Oh god, it's another doom.

2382
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:47,840
I might have...

2383
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:48,420
No!

2384
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,200
I got a pick here.

2385
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:52,440
Oh god.

2386
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:53,900
Oh god, please.

2387
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:55,980
I have 20 people on me.

2388
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:01,240
Bro, what is going on?

2389
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:02,080
Why is there so...

2390
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:03,640
Why do we have another...

2391
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:04,460
Why is every...

2392
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:05,420
Oh, Sombra for Doom.

2393
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,280
Okay, I was going to say, why is everybody playing Sombra?

2394
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,340
And I realized Doom.

2395
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:09,300
Doom.

2396
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:11,360
I'm going, Diva.

2397
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:14,240
You just got to beat up the back line.

2398
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:16,460
All right, here we go.

2399
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,980
Honestly, he's going to get a kill.

2400
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:21,900
I can...

2401
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:22,300
I believe.

2402
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:24,340
Sombra, if you can touch, I can follow up.

2403
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:24,980
Never mind, never mind.

2404
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:26,280
He's not going to touch, man.

2405
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:27,960
I don't think he can make it.

2406
02:33:28,660 --> 02:33:30,840
Let's say, there's no way.

2407
02:33:32,480 --> 02:33:34,650
There's no way he makes it is.

2408
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:39,800
And we got a pick, though.

2409
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:40,700
Whoa!

2410
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:42,540
Look at him go!

2411
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:45,080

02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:03,400
This is where I die.

2467
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:05,040

He's solo.

02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:26,960

Can I cross?

2484
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:33,580
Do I have enough time to cross?

2485
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:35,920
I'm walking in a straight line.

2486
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:37,260
Please don't headshot me.

2487
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:45,880
Oh, no.

2488
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:47,200
Oh, no!

2489
02:37:53,460 --> 02:37:54,820
Leave me alone!

2490
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:56,960
Okay.

2491
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:57,840
Alright.

2492
02:37:58,640 --> 02:37:59,620
Alright, here we go.

2493
02:38:01,220 --> 02:38:01,820
We're fine.

2494
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,760
He's just acting fully.

2495
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:08,680
It's fine.

2496
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:09,240
We're okay.

2497
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:11,380
We're okay, guys.

2498
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:12,480
Nothing to worry about.

2499
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:16,140
Let me live!

2500
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:17,660
Please!

2501
02:38:19,240 --> 02:38:21,020
Please, for the love of God!

2502
02:38:22,060 --> 02:38:23,900
Oh my god, I see him!

2503
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:25,240
I see him!

2504
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:28,900
I see him and I hear the tracer!

2505
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:30,700
Let me live!

2506
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:35,920
Go ahead.

2507
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:37,300
Oh god.

2508
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:38,600
That's fine.

2509
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:39,180
Got my tool?

2510
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:41,260
You win those, they don't have res.

2511
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:42,480
That's good.

2512
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:46,660
They just have Mercy, Zen, and Doom.

2513
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:47,440
You win that.

2514
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:50,060
DMV activated.

2515
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:52,340
Oh my god, please.

2516
02:38:53,140 --> 02:38:53,540
Kill Mercy.

2517
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:57,820
Oh my god, just kill the Zen.

2518
02:38:58,380 --> 02:38:59,400
Kill the Zen!

2519
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:04,620
When you're getting...

2520
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:08,900
Okay, anybody can't be afraid of Doom the way I was being
treated.

2521
02:39:13,380 --> 02:39:16,080
The bully is back.

2522
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:18,880
Oh my god.

2523
02:39:23,830 --> 02:39:24,990
If you saw what I was...

2524
02:39:24,990 --> 02:39:27,510
You guys saw literally what I was going through.

2525
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:31,230
You guys saw the targeted hate.

2526
02:39:31,770 --> 02:39:37,030
Oh my god.

2527
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:41,820
This is it.

2528
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:42,900
I'll be okay.

2529
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:43,900
I'll be okay guys.

2530
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:46,140
I'll be okay this time.

2531
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:47,480
There's no way.

2532
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:48,480
Report.

2533
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:52,480
I will not leave a broken world behind.

2534
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:54,320
Wait, which one's?

2535
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:54,900
Stay sharp.

2536
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:57,820
It's hard to keep you alive when you distract it.

2537
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:04,720
But...

2538
02:40:14,210 --> 02:40:15,570
A mother's wife.

2539
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:17,590
Your work is never done.

2540
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:29,470
You're right, good thinking guys.

2541
02:40:30,270 --> 02:40:30,850
Good thinking.

2542
02:40:36,850 --> 02:40:37,810
Fuck that dude.

2543
02:40:41,030 --> 02:40:42,150
It's coming.

2544
02:40:45,470 --> 02:40:47,470
Oh my god, they have a Symmetra.

2545
02:40:52,270 --> 02:40:53,890
Oh my god, he's on fire.

2546
02:40:55,650 --> 02:40:56,490
Oh, no.

2547
02:40:57,850 --> 02:40:58,710
Oh, we got Zenyata.

2548
02:40:58,850 --> 02:40:59,510
We got Zenyata.

2549
02:41:00,030 --> 02:41:00,610
He's anti.

2550
02:41:00,810 --> 02:41:01,890
I swear to God.

2551
02:41:02,310 --> 02:41:03,190
I swear, please.

2552
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:05,770
Please don't let him live.

2553
02:41:06,670 --> 02:41:07,310
I got my two.

2554
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:10,490
All right, we're fine.

2555
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:12,810
Ash, they have no supports.

2556
02:41:13,330 --> 02:41:13,750
We're okay.

2557
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:18,650
Oh, thank God.

2558
02:41:19,630 --> 02:41:20,070
Thank God.

2559
02:41:20,830 --> 02:41:22,790
Worst in your previous kit.

2560
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:36,200
I'm okay that rock needed an ante oh thank god okay our
somber is actually shutting him down that makes me a lot

2562
02:41:47,020 --> 02:41:47,760

oh thank god guys guys he left me alone now he's targeting
He's eating Sombra!

2564
02:41:57,100 --> 02:41:58,820
He has a new person to hate!

2565
02:41:59,360 --> 02:42:00,660
Guys, that wall was so...

2566
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:01,600
That wall needed healing.

2567
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:02,440
You guys don't understand.

2568
02:42:06,220 --> 02:42:07,200
Guys, I panicked Naded.

2569
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:10,520
I couldn't help it.

2570
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,160
I panicked.

2571
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:12,980
It was so scary.

2572
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:13,700
You don't understand.

2573
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:16,160
Holy shit.

2574
02:42:16,260 --> 02:42:17,120
He almost burned to death.

2575
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:19,640
I literally got it just in time.

2576
02:42:23,710 --> 02:42:24,730
Wait, is that junk rat?

2577
02:42:25,130 --> 02:42:26,170
No, that wasn't.

2578
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:26,850
That was just doom.

2579
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:30,350
Oh, GG's.

2580
02:42:30,550 --> 02:42:31,070
Oh, thank God.

2581
02:42:31,370 --> 02:42:31,850
He stopped.

2582
02:42:32,650 --> 02:42:34,870
Guys, he stopped.

2583
02:42:35,190 --> 02:42:37,050
He stopped going for me.

2584
02:42:40,150 --> 02:42:41,470
Oh, my God.

2585
02:42:41,610 --> 02:42:46,750
The constant hack is actually ring around the rosy ring
around the rosy.

2586
02:42:46,950 --> 02:42:50,830
Is that guy of all people talking shit to his teammates?

2587
02:42:51,130 --> 02:42:51,510
No!

2588
02:42:55,310 --> 02:43:00,890
Guys, the moment I stopped ring-arounding the rosy, it was
over.

2589
02:43:02,050 --> 02:43:05,730
I was like, maybe I don't need a ring-around the rosy, you
know?

2590
02:43:06,170 --> 02:43:10,970
Maybe I was confident in being like, the Doomfist is not
aiming for me, clearly.

2591

02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:16,120
It's like an extra player.

2764
02:55:16,340 --> 02:55:17,940
It's like having, like, six players.

2765
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,120
Guys, it doesn't help that would play this game.

2766
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:23,260
I like late night cues.

2767
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:28,320
And, like, late night cues are absolutely the most terrible
thing you can ever play on.

2768
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:31,080
What?

2769
02:55:33,460 --> 02:55:33,900
Muchaloo.

2770
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:36,460
Okay, this is where I die, most likely.

2771
02:55:36,480 --> 02:55:48,460
unless I don't die because I'm a gamer it's okay I'll do
something eventually give me a sec oh they used Susu again

2772
02:55:49,600 --> 02:56:02,020
there you go see alright I gotta hide look at that another
Susu okay let's hope he doesn't die because he doesn't

2773
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:15,020
because he's gaming gamer of the your fucking course well
thank you easiest game of my life we're gonna 2-0 them right

2774
02:56:15,020 --> 02:56:25,100

2-0 them look at that and the anti who is she even though

2775
02:56:25,100 --> 02:56:30,200
like like a top 500 Anna should be able to anti anything but
like who is she

2776
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:37,760
oh shit It's okay.

2777
02:56:39,820 --> 02:56:40,780
We can...

2778
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:42,220
Alright, I'm gonna back out.

2779
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:44,340
I don't think we're gonna win this.

2780
02:56:44,360 --> 02:56:46,760
I don't think...

2781
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:47,740
Wait, they're running?

2782
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:48,660
Sigma?

2783
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:50,520
That's cheating!

2784
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:52,040
Oh, I'm gonna die.

2785
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:52,960
No, you're not!

2786
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:53,820
No, you're not!

2787
02:56:54,100 --> 02:56:55,380
I'm a fucking healer!

2788
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:57,340
No, I'm not the Sigma.

2789
02:56:57,660 --> 02:56:58,340
I can't...

2790
02:56:58,340 --> 02:57:00,920
I hate playing on against Sigma.

2791
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:03,160
This is it.

2792
02:57:04,260 --> 02:57:04,740
Wait.

2793
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:05,880
This guy died!

2794
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:09,880
No, he doesn't I've never seen someone more one HP in my
life.

2795
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:19,920
Oh, no, please please please please please please please I
had to back off he was This is not perfect Okay, he just

2796
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:29,010
gave him like 100 HP, but that's okay Oh my god, that poor
Sigma got cyber bullied so hard

2797
02:57:32,460 --> 02:57:45,910
No, shoot the dwarf it would be so funny beautiful oh no
that that sleep would have hit if the sigma didn't have

2798
02:57:45,910 --> 02:58:00,410
shield it would have hit 100% fucking hell wait is that okay
we're fine everything's fine i got the capacity too for that

2799
02:58:00,410 --> 02:58:12,470
i'm saying is that because i'm a support any any kills my
dps gets is my kill It's the rule of law.

2800
02:58:13,170 --> 02:58:14,330
Who is he ulting?

2801
02:58:14,890 --> 02:58:16,850
Oh, our poor fucking torb.

2802
02:58:17,130 --> 02:58:18,230
Wait, more than no fade.

2803
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,370
We can kill Sig.

2804
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:21,290
Oh!

2805
02:58:23,050 --> 02:58:24,850
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2806
02:58:25,370 --> 02:58:26,770
Not the shield, not the shield.

2807
02:58:27,450 --> 02:58:29,550
No, you suck your fat ass took the anti!

2808
02:58:32,430 --> 02:58:33,550
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2809
02:58:33,770 --> 02:58:35,050
Cassidy, take the hit for me.

2810
02:58:36,610 --> 02:58:37,570
Cassidy, take the hit.

2811
02:58:37,570 --> 02:58:53,670

sec it's okay I'll contest for us I'll punch him sorry Torr

2812
02:58:53,670 --> 02:59:01,430
intentional body block by the way very intentional I'm body
blocking for the other team

2813
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:08,450
that's okay See?

2814
02:59:09,390 --> 02:59:09,510
2-0.

2815
02:59:09,890 --> 02:59:10,730
Alright, who wants to bet?

2816
02:59:10,990 --> 02:59:12,010
We're gonna 2-0 with them.

2817
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:16,110
Guys, I don't have a problem with betting.

2818
02:59:17,530 --> 02:59:19,250
He wanted the healing.

2819
02:59:22,650 --> 02:59:23,610
Yay, yippee!

2820
02:59:25,530 --> 02:59:26,950
How are we overwatching?

2821
02:59:27,270 --> 02:59:29,870
I think we're like solid even at the moment.

2822
02:59:29,950 --> 02:59:31,950
If we win one more game, we're positive.

2823
02:59:32,350 --> 02:59:33,950
It only took us three hours.

2824
02:59:37,370 --> 02:59:39,550
We went through a lot.

2825
02:59:42,210 --> 02:59:46,730
If we win one more game, we have a positive win rate.

2826
02:59:48,930 --> 02:59:50,490
It just takes one game.

2827
02:59:51,050 --> 02:59:54,730
Oh my god, I'm living life by the edge.

2828
02:59:56,290 --> 02:59:57,710
Oh, they have a Zen.

2829
02:59:58,430 --> 03:00:00,590
Oh no, not a Zenyada.

2830
03:00:01,390 --> 03:00:03,530
Only took three hours to break even.

2831
03:00:05,030 --> 03:00:05,850
It's just business.

2832
03:00:08,750 --> 03:00:10,250
Okay, that's not fair.

2833
03:00:10,330 --> 03:00:11,350
Like I'm being shot at.

2834
03:00:12,050 --> 03:00:12,790
That's not fair.

2835
03:00:13,150 --> 03:00:13,570
It's okay.

2836
03:00:13,970 --> 03:00:15,490
I am also being shot at.

2837
03:00:17,170 --> 03:00:17,750
It's okay.

2838
03:00:17,870 --> 03:00:18,190
Oh no.

2839
03:00:19,470 --> 03:00:21,030
Oh wait, he's alive?

2840
03:00:21,790 --> 03:00:22,470
Wait, he's alive?

2841
03:00:23,230 --> 03:00:24,690
How the fuck is he alive?

2842
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:28,270
Oh, I got you.

2843
03:00:28,470 --> 03:00:28,690
Oh, I got you.

2844
03:00:28,870 --> 03:00:29,170
Oh, I got you.

2845
03:00:29,310 --> 03:00:29,670

2846
03:00:30,110 --> 03:00:30,270

2847
03:00:30,270 --> 03:00:30,470
I got you.

2848
03:00:30,470 --> 03:00:30,510
I got you.

2849
03:00:30,510 --> 03:00:30,550
I got you.

2850
03:00:30,550 --> 03:00:31,110
I have to reload.

2851
03:00:33,410 --> 03:00:33,810
I got you.

2852
03:00:33,910 --> 03:00:34,250
I got you.

2853
03:00:34,370 --> 03:00:34,810
I got you.

2854
03:00:35,790 --> 03:00:36,430
How are we alive?

2855
03:00:36,450 --> 03:00:37,370
Nice!

2856
03:00:37,610 --> 03:00:37,830
Nice!

2857
03:00:40,190 --> 03:00:42,090
This game is so trash.

2858
03:00:42,590 --> 03:00:44,830
Yes, but what else do I have left?

2859
03:00:48,450 --> 03:00:49,370
Like, what was it?

2860
03:00:49,390 --> 03:00:51,590
Marvel Rivals waiting room right now.

2861
03:00:51,990 --> 03:00:54,450
This is my...

2862
03:00:55,050 --> 03:00:58,470
This is the waiting room for the Marvel shooter game.

2863
03:01:00,210 --> 03:01:01,530
They have a hog now.

2864

Okay, they know I'm here.

2865
03:01:03,750 --> 03:01:04,350

03:02:05,390 --> 03:02:07,550
Wait, where was my bodyguards?

2874

2875
03:02:09,890 --> 03:02:13,110
I hope the Cassidy dies in game.

2876
03:02:13,610 --> 03:02:14,270
I don't mind.

2877
03:02:15,050 --> 03:02:17,290
We should all be one, one, one, one, one.

2878
03:02:20,570 --> 03:02:21,230
All right.

2879
03:02:21,950 --> 03:02:23,110
This is so unchanging.

2880
03:02:26,390 --> 03:02:26,910
Okay.

2881
03:02:29,530 --> 03:02:30,190
That's fine.

2882
03:02:30,970 --> 03:02:32,430
Yes, it's perfect vibe.

2883
03:02:32,790 --> 03:02:34,010
This is not fine anymore.

2884
03:02:34,670 --> 03:02:35,750
This is not fine anymore.

2885
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:38,310
I would have...

2886
03:02:38,310 --> 03:02:45,010
Okay, all I'm saying is that I could have actually 100%
killed the cure girl with just my shame.

2887
03:02:48,230 --> 03:02:50,390
No, the castle didn't live!

2888
03:02:51,010 --> 03:02:52,730
Press all the cues.

2889
03:02:53,250 --> 03:02:55,930

03:04:36,350 --> 03:04:37,310

I actually don't want to play Kiriko.

2904
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:43,230

I actually hate this map, like, so much.

2906
03:04:49,090 --> 03:04:52,330
I wish they would remove this map.

2907
03:04:53,150 --> 03:04:53,510
Okay.

I swear.

2910
03:05:01,570 --> 03:05:03,570
I swear it's not because of me, though.

2911
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:05,510
Every time I lose as...

2912
03:05:05,510 --> 03:05:08,190
Every time I lose as Kierko, it's not me.

2913
03:05:08,650 --> 03:05:10,270
It was never me.

2914
03:05:12,410 --> 03:05:13,490
I swear.

2915
03:05:13,990 --> 03:05:15,030
I swear, guys.

2916
03:05:18,850 --> 03:05:20,870
It's never a me issue.

2917
03:05:21,110 --> 03:05:21,830
All I'm saying.

2918
03:05:26,130 --> 03:05:27,590
Here we go.

2919
03:05:28,150 --> 03:05:28,690
Yay.

2920
03:05:29,470 --> 03:05:30,910
I hate this map, though.

2921
03:05:31,110 --> 03:05:32,630
I hate this map so much.

2922
03:05:34,430 --> 03:05:36,050
Oh, it's not me.

2923
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:38,750
It's my tank and DPS and other support.

2924
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:38,950
Hey.

2925
03:05:39,970 --> 03:05:40,350
Hello.

2926
03:05:41,030 --> 03:05:42,210
We must strike them down.

2927
03:05:42,370 --> 03:05:42,630
Alright.

2928
03:05:45,570 --> 03:05:45,890
Wait.

2929
03:05:46,170 --> 03:05:47,170
I went the wrong way.

2930
03:05:47,330 --> 03:05:47,790
I'm sorry.

2931
03:05:48,590 --> 03:05:50,130
I don't know why I went this way.

2932
03:05:51,210 --> 03:05:53,170
My actual teammates are over here.

2933
03:05:53,450 --> 03:05:54,730
Oh, that's a good.

2934
03:05:56,830 --> 03:06:01,370
What the f- Where did the chunker game from?

2935
03:06:02,210 --> 03:06:03,370
Holy shit.

2936
03:06:04,090 --> 03:06:05,770
Where did he come from?

2937
03:06:06,430 --> 03:06:07,830
What the fuck?

2938
03:06:09,690 --> 03:06:11,410
They also have a slumber now.

2939
03:06:12,610 --> 03:06:15,710
Alright, this is a little awkward that we lost that.

2940
03:06:15,770 --> 03:06:17,370
We got the initial pick too!

2941
03:06:18,190 --> 03:06:22,130
Wait, I don't know if I saw it as the streamish mode name,
but like...

2942
03:06:22,130 --> 03:06:24,050
If it's not, then he's actually...

2943
03:06:24,590 --> 03:06:26,150
Oh, I'm scared.

2944
03:06:27,690 --> 03:06:28,850
I'm so scared.

2945
03:06:29,710 --> 03:06:30,890
Oh, I'm so scared.

2946
03:06:31,170 --> 03:06:31,850
I leave.

2947
03:06:32,110 --> 03:06:32,870
I leave.

2948
03:06:33,350 --> 03:06:35,650
Guys, I might lose my positive win rate right here.

2949
03:06:36,050 --> 03:06:39,530
I have a plan.

2950
03:06:39,650 --> 03:06:40,430
I want to go under there.

2951
03:06:41,230 --> 03:06:41,930
I might lose.

2952
03:06:42,110 --> 03:06:42,350
Guys.

2953
03:06:42,370 --> 03:06:43,370
I'm following you.

2954
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:47,310
There might be a moment where I lose my positive win rate.

2955
03:06:48,810 --> 03:06:49,110
Maybe.

2956
03:06:50,410 --> 03:06:51,350
It's possible.

2957
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:53,830
It's possible.

2958
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:55,910
And then he's...

2959
03:06:55,910 --> 03:06:56,090
Hold up.

2960
03:06:56,290 --> 03:06:56,450
Leave him.

2961
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:56,690
Leave him.

2962
03:06:56,710 --> 03:06:56,990
Leave him.

2963
03:06:58,030 --> 03:06:59,490
Do we leave him?

2964
03:06:59,490 --> 03:07:00,390
Did we leave him?

2965
03:07:00,810 --> 03:07:01,890
I don't think we left him.

2966
03:07:02,750 --> 03:07:03,790
I don't think...

2967
03:07:04,230 --> 03:07:04,470
Please!

2968
03:07:04,710 --> 03:07:04,950
Please!

2969
03:07:05,170 --> 03:07:05,430
Me!

2970
03:07:05,610 --> 03:07:05,910
Me!

2971
03:07:06,050 --> 03:07:06,570
Cleanse!

2972
03:07:06,750 --> 03:07:07,410
I'm important!

2973
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:10,250
This is still winnable.

2974
03:07:10,550 --> 03:07:11,710
Guys, I didn't get cleansed.

2975
03:07:13,350 --> 03:07:15,210
I didn't get... Guys, I didn't get cleansed.

2976
03:07:16,910 --> 03:07:17,910
I don't...

2977
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:19,210
We're cleansed.

2978
03:07:20,450 --> 03:07:22,230
Are Kierkegaard only cleansed themselves?

2979
03:07:22,890 --> 03:07:27,030
See, this Kierkegaard looks like a person with a 29% win
rate.

2980
03:07:27,390 --> 03:07:28,130
Not gonna lie.

2981
03:07:30,410 --> 03:07:34,210
I bet you that Kierkegaard has a worse win rate than me on
Kierkegaard.

2982
03:07:36,050 --> 03:07:37,610
Oh, I was fucking around.

2983
03:07:37,670 --> 03:07:38,170
I was fucking around.

2984
03:07:38,450 --> 03:07:39,090
I was fucking around.

2985
03:07:39,370 --> 03:07:40,910
Why would a Samba be right there?

2986
03:07:41,390 --> 03:07:43,470
Why would she be right here?

2987
03:07:43,630 --> 03:07:43,930
Guys!

2988
03:07:49,810 --> 03:07:52,830
Like, why would she be right here?

2989
03:07:53,210 --> 03:07:58,190
Oh my god.

2990
03:08:00,730 --> 03:08:01,410
Like, how?

2991
03:08:01,830 --> 03:08:03,750
How are they like at her spawn?

2992
03:08:08,130 --> 03:08:09,870
Okay, here we go.

2993
03:08:10,790 --> 03:08:12,050
Just somber things.

2994
03:08:12,910 --> 03:08:13,330
I swear.

2995
03:08:13,890 --> 03:08:14,250
Target it.

2996
03:08:14,570 --> 03:08:15,730
100% target it.

2997
03:08:15,790 --> 03:08:16,530
There's no way.

2998
03:08:18,330 --> 03:08:19,830
There's no way it's not targeted.

2999
03:08:22,850 --> 03:08:24,050
I'm just gonna...

3000
03:08:25,990 --> 03:08:26,710
Go.

3001
03:08:27,570 --> 03:08:27,830
Go.

3002
03:08:33,830 --> 03:08:34,590
I'm dead.

3003
03:08:36,810 --> 03:08:38,590
No more go.

3004
03:08:40,510 --> 03:08:42,410
They're all low.

3005
03:08:44,270 --> 03:08:46,330
Oh my god.

3006
03:08:48,190 --> 03:08:48,670
Good kill.

3007
03:08:49,210 --> 03:08:51,050
I am going to go Zenyata.

3008
03:08:52,270 --> 03:08:52,610
What?

3009
03:08:52,950 --> 03:08:53,970
For the widow?

3010
03:08:54,270 --> 03:08:55,750
Did she just solo all together?

3011
03:08:56,170 --> 03:08:57,050
Yeah, for widow?

3012
03:08:57,910 --> 03:08:59,050
That's crazy.

3013
03:09:00,010 --> 03:09:01,830
That's kind of fucked up.

3014
03:09:01,970 --> 03:09:02,930
You bypassed it, wouldn't you?

3015
03:09:06,530 --> 03:09:09,610
It was nice having a positive win rate for a little bit,
though.

3016
03:09:10,250 --> 03:09:11,710
I had a good time with that.

3017
03:09:13,110 --> 03:09:15,090
It felt really good for, like, one second.

3018
03:09:15,150 --> 03:09:18,270
They're shaking's not top right now, which means we can go
top.

3019
03:09:18,530 --> 03:09:19,610
Oh, wait a second.

3020
03:09:19,730 --> 03:09:20,290
You got a touch.

3021
03:09:20,390 --> 03:09:21,530
Oh, that's the...

3022
03:09:21,630 --> 03:09:22,170
I didn't realize.

3023
03:09:22,950 --> 03:09:23,710
Ah, that's fine.

3024
03:09:23,830 --> 03:09:24,490
We weren't winning that fight.

3025
03:09:24,970 --> 03:09:25,870
Uh, all right.

3026
03:09:26,190 --> 03:09:27,290
I'm going to die.

3027
03:09:27,510 --> 03:09:28,230
Might as well.

3028
03:09:29,150 --> 03:09:30,870
I might as well.

3029
03:09:32,670 --> 03:09:34,270
Guys, no, I have an idea.

3030
03:09:35,090 --> 03:09:35,930
I have an idea.

3031
03:09:36,050 --> 03:09:37,110
I think they're chasing us.

3032
03:09:37,630 --> 03:09:38,210
This is it.

3033
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:39,950
This is the plan.

3034
03:09:40,370 --> 03:09:40,890
This is it.

3035
03:09:41,910 --> 03:09:43,210
This has to be the plan, right?

3036
03:09:45,350 --> 03:09:46,150
This is it.

3037
03:09:47,010 --> 03:09:48,030
There's no way.

3038
03:09:48,870 --> 03:09:50,750
It would be so funny if I get railed right here.

3039
03:09:51,670 --> 03:09:52,630
It would be so funny.

3040
03:09:54,530 --> 03:09:55,650
Two Chaos, two Chaos this is it!

3041
03:09:55,710 --> 03:09:56,850
I knew it!

3042
03:09:57,050 --> 03:09:59,330
I fucking knew this was the plan.

3043
03:10:00,590 --> 03:10:02,090
I miss the character.

3044
03:10:03,250 --> 03:10:04,350
I knew it.

3045
03:10:04,390 --> 03:10:05,010
How good are you?

3046
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:07,870
I knew it guys.

3047
03:10:08,110 --> 03:10:09,530
This was the plan all along.

3048
03:10:09,770 --> 03:10:13,310
Me too.

3049
03:10:13,910 --> 03:10:14,130
All right.

3050
03:10:14,510 --> 03:10:15,370
All we have to do?

3051
03:10:15,970 --> 03:10:17,830
Make sure our widow is pocketed.

3052
03:10:19,710 --> 03:10:20,330
What the fuck?

3053
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:23,670
Why is there three people here behind us?

3054
03:10:23,830 --> 03:10:24,810
Oh, they're just...

3055
03:10:24,810 --> 03:10:26,150
Oh, that's not good.

3056
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:28,610
Yeah, this is not good at all.

3057
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:32,150
This ends now.

3058
03:10:32,450 --> 03:10:32,910
It's fine.

3059
03:10:33,110 --> 03:10:33,890
It's not fine.

3060
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:34,950
I was gonna say this is winnable.

3061
03:10:34,950 --> 03:10:36,370
It's not fine anymore.

3062
03:10:38,230 --> 03:10:39,590
It's not fine anymore.

3063
03:10:40,610 --> 03:10:41,890
It's not fine anymore.

3064
03:10:42,590 --> 03:10:43,970
It's not fine anymore.

3065
03:10:44,490 --> 03:10:45,710
Kiriko, it's not fine.

3066
03:10:45,890 --> 03:10:47,170
It's not fine at all.

3067
03:10:47,270 --> 03:10:49,070
No, Ruben, you are the only one left!

3068
03:10:49,090 --> 03:10:50,210
You know, I got a little ambitious.

3069
03:10:52,470 --> 03:10:52,930
No!

3070
03:10:56,640 --> 03:10:57,340
It's okay.

3071
03:10:57,460 --> 03:10:58,320
It'll be different here.

3072
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:02,400
It'll be different, I believe.

3073
03:11:03,220 --> 03:11:05,080
I just realized how big I am on the screen.

3074
03:11:05,160 --> 03:11:07,920
I hope that has not been, like, the gameplay.

3075
03:11:13,600 --> 03:11:17,920
After three hours, I realized, whoa, I'm like one fourth of
the screen.

3076
03:11:22,180 --> 03:11:22,880
It's fine.

3077
03:11:23,060 --> 03:11:23,760
Oh, see the bubbles!

3078
03:11:25,880 --> 03:11:27,580
Make it bigger.

3079
03:11:29,080 --> 03:11:30,020
I got you!

3080
03:11:30,980 --> 03:11:32,100
Wait, okay, I got you.

3081
03:11:32,100 --> 03:11:33,140
Okay, all right.

3082
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:35,120
That's fine.

3083
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:36,720
We're fine.

3084
03:11:36,900 --> 03:11:38,820
Not quite.

3085
03:11:40,960 --> 03:11:42,680
We need it bigger.

3086
03:11:45,280 --> 03:11:47,020
Nice, we did it.

3087
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:49,300
Woo!

3088
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:51,660
That was a little ambitious.

3089
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:55,600
They used EMP, they used Rush, they used Queen All.

3090
03:11:55,960 --> 03:11:57,600
That was very ambitious.

3091
03:11:58,480 --> 03:12:00,500
Go Bigger Go All.

3092
03:12:00,740 --> 03:12:03,720
I can't see shit and make it bigger.

3093
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:19,240
oh oh there he is i'm a little scared just a little scared
just a little bit just a little bit

3094
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:32,740
it's fine it's not fine anymore it is absolutely not fine

3095
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:40,420
Famous last words.

3096
03:12:44,380 --> 03:12:44,900
Guys.

3097
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:47,000
It was nice having it.

3098
03:12:47,460 --> 03:12:48,960
I think it was like...

3099
03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:51,680
It was pretty cool having a positive win rate, though.

3100
03:12:52,180 --> 03:12:53,620
It was pretty cool.

3101
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:56,680
I...

3102
03:12:57,560 --> 03:12:59,020
I had a good time.

3103
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:01,740
Seeing what that was like.

3104
03:13:02,340 --> 03:13:03,380
Dragon, think of the Super Chat.

3105
03:13:03,460 --> 03:13:04,120
Thank you, thank you.

3106
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:04,800
Hey, Doki.

3107
03:13:04,920 --> 03:13:05,720
How's it going?

3108
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:06,760
I ordered Chipotle.

3109
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:07,700
We were...

3110
03:13:07,700 --> 03:13:08,920
It was a reversal.

3111
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:12,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

3112
03:13:12,480 --> 03:13:13,860
That shit was so rough.

3113
03:13:15,660 --> 03:13:17,320
That shit was so fucking rough.

3114
03:13:17,780 --> 03:13:19,160
And it was a fucking reversal.

3115
03:13:19,980 --> 03:13:21,100
That's actually crazy.

3116
03:13:22,940 --> 03:13:24,920
I worked so hard.

3117
03:13:26,620 --> 03:13:34,360
By the way, for those who don't know what reversal means,
reversal is basically our team was considered stronger than

3118
03:13:34,360 --> 03:13:35,240
the enemy team.

3119
03:13:35,440 --> 03:13:36,260
But there's no way.

3120
03:13:36,600 --> 03:13:38,000
I refuse to believe that.

3121
03:13:40,980 --> 03:13:44,520
Anyway, uh, but yeah, those are my stats.

3122
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:45,820
It's a little...

3123
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:49,760
It's not the best.

3124
03:13:53,140 --> 03:13:54,540
Welcome to Rialto.

3125
03:13:58,210 --> 03:13:59,210
Alright, here we go.

3126
03:13:59,850 --> 03:14:01,650

03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:04,110

3162
03:15:55,310 --> 03:15:55,650

Oh, God, please.

3164
03:15:57,430 --> 03:15:57,910
Wait, wait, wait.

3165
03:15:59,010 --> 03:15:59,410
That's okay.

3166
03:15:59,470 --> 03:15:59,770
You got the next one.

3167
03:15:59,770 --> 03:16:00,250
Got this.

3168
03:16:00,890 --> 03:16:01,270
All right.

3169
03:16:01,970 --> 03:16:02,830
I have to reload.

3170
03:16:02,990 --> 03:16:03,750
I have to reload.

3171
03:16:04,030 --> 03:16:04,310
Okay.

3172
03:16:05,070 --> 03:16:05,990
I have to reload.

3173
03:16:05,990 --> 03:16:07,010
In the tank, let's go.

3174
03:16:07,010 --> 03:16:07,770
Look at your tour.

3175
03:16:07,930 --> 03:16:08,630
But he is running.

3176
03:16:09,050 --> 03:16:09,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3177
03:16:09,690 --> 03:16:11,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3178
03:16:11,950 --> 03:16:12,250
No!

3179
03:16:14,850 --> 03:16:17,730
No, stop doing streamer things.

3180
03:16:17,730 --> 03:16:18,250
I made space.

3181
03:16:21,750 --> 03:16:22,570
Stop doing streamer things.

3182
03:16:22,570 --> 03:16:23,610
My heart broke on the lamp.

3183
03:16:24,170 --> 03:16:27,590
Stop doing streamer things with the name.

3184
03:16:32,770 --> 03:16:34,190
Play the wind.

3185
03:16:34,850 --> 03:16:35,970
Don't play for streamer.

3186
03:16:35,990 --> 03:16:37,110
Streamer moments!

3187
03:16:40,970 --> 03:16:43,230
That's all I asked for!

3188
03:16:44,190 --> 03:16:45,950
We don't need streamer mode!

3189
03:16:46,310 --> 03:16:47,710
Cool streamer clips!

3190
03:16:48,170 --> 03:16:50,070
But the content...

3191
03:16:50,070 --> 03:16:51,630
The content is winning!

3192
03:16:53,850 --> 03:16:58,250
I try to play the best I can and I still make content.

3193
03:16:58,830 --> 03:17:01,530
That's just a fucking content diff right there.

3194
03:17:03,910 --> 03:17:05,790
I'm not seeing content diff.

3195
03:17:07,450 --> 03:17:08,090
But...

3196
03:17:08,090 --> 03:17:08,930
Content diff.

3197
03:17:09,170 --> 03:17:09,830
No, you're new.

3198
03:17:11,450 --> 03:17:14,770
Let's put like 400 ults right now.

3199
03:17:15,250 --> 03:17:16,990
Oh my god, the 2k!

3200
03:17:17,910 --> 03:17:19,630
We definitely do not.

3201
03:17:20,170 --> 03:17:20,930
Is the Bob there?

3202
03:17:22,130 --> 03:17:23,230
Is the Bob still there?

3203
03:17:23,730 --> 03:17:24,370
Oh my god.

3204
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:27,430
Nice.

3205
03:17:29,330 --> 03:17:30,910
Now you do.

3206
03:17:31,870 --> 03:17:32,090
What?

3207
03:17:33,390 --> 03:17:34,030
I...

3208
03:17:34,030 --> 03:17:35,310
But my hog is just so...

3209
03:17:35,310 --> 03:17:35,810
It's okay.

3210
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:36,570
So terrible.

3211
03:17:37,030 --> 03:17:37,050
We're good.

3212
03:17:37,050 --> 03:17:37,330
Oh my god.

3213
03:17:37,390 --> 03:17:38,150
One continent.

3214
03:17:38,350 --> 03:17:39,070
Let's jump here.

3215
03:17:39,090 --> 03:17:40,070
It's like a neon hog.

3216
03:17:40,810 --> 03:17:41,590
Literally neon hog.

3217
03:17:42,910 --> 03:17:43,350
Oh no.

3218
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:44,350
They're making content.

3219
03:17:44,570 --> 03:17:45,690
They're trying to make content again.

3220
03:17:46,350 --> 03:17:48,110
They're trying to make content again.

3221
03:17:48,830 --> 03:17:50,070
I'm pushing the ash, bro.

3222
03:17:50,550 --> 03:17:51,150
Oh, what?

3223
03:17:51,230 --> 03:17:52,010
You're inting.

3224
03:17:53,110 --> 03:17:53,250
Oh wait.

3225
03:17:53,250 --> 03:17:53,330
No?

3226
03:17:54,810 --> 03:17:58,450
How does, how does me, how does me train the ash change this
way?

3227
03:17:59,150 --> 03:18:00,630
Bro, he got out junked.

3228
03:18:00,690 --> 03:18:01,250
Uh, watch this.

3229
03:18:01,430 --> 03:18:03,750
He got out junked so hard.

3230
03:18:03,990 --> 03:18:04,530
Keep watching.

3231
03:18:06,310 --> 03:18:20,270

3238
03:19:33,150 --> 03:19:39,950
to be fair though if you're streaming this game non-stop you
have to you have to figure out some ways to make this

3239
03:19:39,950 --> 03:19:49,630
engagement engaging but then to be fair people watch shroud

He's also a millionaire.

03:20:45,930 --> 03:20:46,470
Okay, I gotta go.

3247
03:20:49,010 --> 03:20:50,090
Am I gonna die?

03:20:54,250 --> 03:20:55,010
I'm dead to this.

3250
03:20:55,190 --> 03:20:56,230
I'm not dead to this.

3251
03:20:57,370 --> 03:20:58,630
I'm not dead to this.

3252
03:20:58,650 --> 03:20:59,590
That hero is so cringe.

3253
03:21:00,210 --> 03:21:00,950
We're fine.

3254
03:21:01,170 --> 03:21:01,470
We're fine.

3255
03:21:03,170 --> 03:21:04,430
We can do this.

3256
03:21:04,610 --> 03:21:05,330
I have ult.

3257
03:21:05,570 --> 03:21:05,910
It's crazy.

3258
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:08,930
It comes to a win.

3259
03:21:09,910 --> 03:21:14,050
Alright, here you go.

3260
03:21:14,290 --> 03:21:15,310
It'll be fine.

3261
03:21:15,610 --> 03:21:18,650
We might have a junk rat, but we'll be fine.

3262
03:21:20,610 --> 03:21:21,270
Okay, I'm watching.

3263
03:21:21,430 --> 03:21:21,670

3264
03:21:21,690 --> 03:21:21,930
Oh!

That's actually good!

3266
03:21:23,330 --> 03:21:24,530
That's actually a good bomb!

3267
03:21:26,090 --> 03:21:26,510
There you go.

3268
03:21:28,590 --> 03:21:30,070
We're doing it.

3269
03:21:31,350 --> 03:21:32,390
Is Doki winning?

3270
03:21:33,170 --> 03:21:50,690
winning being even in my win rate percentage right now for
today even after three and a half hours that'll be fine okay

3271
03:21:50,690 --> 03:22:04,390

whoa why am I flying into I only remember that because I was

3272
03:22:04,390 --> 03:22:06,130

hard in the game that like he he like rage quit overwatch no

3276
03:23:00,310 --> 03:23:10,510

It was like Tim the Tapman, Moon Moon, and...

3280
03:23:34,710 --> 03:23:35,570
Who is it?

3281
03:23:35,830 --> 03:23:39,230
It was like Tim, Moon, Moon, and one DPS player.

3282
03:23:39,450 --> 03:23:40,190
I don't remember who.

3283
03:23:40,870 --> 03:23:42,530
I wish I had the clips, though.

3284
03:23:43,990 --> 03:23:45,350
I wish I had the clips.

3285
03:23:46,250 --> 03:23:47,690
Always play Ramatra, right?

3286
03:23:47,970 --> 03:23:48,990
Okay, Zenyatta time.

3287
03:23:49,370 --> 03:23:50,570

I think he wants to punch me now.

3302
03:25:10,530 --> 03:25:12,050

3303
03:25:12,630 --> 03:25:12,810

Whoops.

3312
03:25:26,130 --> 03:25:26,610
He should die.

3313
03:25:26,630 --> 03:25:26,930

3314
03:25:27,230 --> 03:25:27,410

That's all I want.

3320
03:25:37,450 --> 03:25:38,930
Oh, I didn't give a punch this time.

3321
03:25:39,510 --> 03:25:40,690
I didn't commit a mistake.

3322
03:25:42,230 --> 03:25:42,470
Oh.

3323
03:25:42,790 --> 03:25:43,550

03:25:43,630 --> 03:25:44,010
Okay.

3325
03:25:44,010 --> 03:25:44,170

03:25:44,250 --> 03:25:44,730

3327
03:25:45,450 --> 03:25:46,250

You're welcome.

3331
03:25:51,190 --> 03:25:51,850

03:30:32,740 --> 03:30:34,000
I'm actually mad.

3417
03:30:34,120 --> 03:30:35,100
We don't need to overchase.

3418
03:30:35,300 --> 03:30:36,060
They should be close to us.

3419
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:36,580
They should be close to us.

3420
03:30:36,720 --> 03:30:37,100
Be careful.

3421
03:30:37,960 --> 03:30:38,740
More one, more one.

3422
03:30:39,260 --> 03:30:39,680

3423
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:41,120

3424
03:30:41,920 --> 03:30:42,860
I'm almost a rally.

3425
03:30:44,100 --> 03:30:44,920
I'm almost a rally.

3426
03:30:45,960 --> 03:30:47,220
I'm almost a rally.

3427
03:30:47,480 --> 03:30:51,280
Oh, I need care.

3428
03:30:51,440 --> 03:30:51,780

03:30:52,900 --> 03:30:53,180
I've rallied.

3432
03:30:53,180 --> 03:30:53,900
I've rallied one to stun.

3433
03:30:53,980 --> 03:30:55,260
Oh, oh my God.

3434
03:30:55,620 --> 03:30:56,200
I'm shooting the wall.

3435
03:30:56,300 --> 03:30:56,420
I'm coming.

3436
03:30:56,560 --> 03:30:57,020
I'm on the way.

3437
03:30:57,080 --> 03:30:57,460
I'm on their way.

3438
03:30:58,260 --> 03:30:58,680
I'm on their way.

3439
03:30:59,320 --> 03:30:59,600
Okay.

3440
03:30:59,740 --> 03:31:00,200
I have to reload.

3441
03:31:00,200 --> 03:31:00,800
I have to reload.

3442
03:31:00,980 --> 03:31:01,540
I have to reload.

3443
03:31:01,940 --> 03:31:02,940
We gotta kill Mayap, right?

3444
03:31:03,840 --> 03:31:04,220
No!

3445
03:31:04,300 --> 03:31:05,720
Me-wo, me-wo, me-wo, me-wo.

3446
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:06,940
Me-wo, me-wo, me-wo.

3447
03:31:06,960 --> 03:31:07,360
Oh,

3449
03:31:13,220 --> 03:31:14,720
They have May-O, though.

3450
03:31:15,540 --> 03:31:16,520
They have May-O.

3451
03:31:16,520 --> 03:31:17,540
I'm on one of those, I say, I say Kari.

3452
03:31:18,420 --> 03:31:19,100
Okay, big.

We only have, we only have Tectonic.

3455
03:31:23,720 --> 03:31:24,220
What did they use?

3456
03:31:24,380 --> 03:31:26,520
I thought, what, Meteor-Site, Tectonic, Lizard.

3457
03:31:27,560 --> 03:31:29,440
Oh, they should have both supports.

3458
03:31:30,200 --> 03:31:30,900
We just have tectonic.

3459
03:31:31,060 --> 03:31:38,980
We need to, we need to try and like farm nano here and like
maybe use tectonic for so we can build a farm.

3460
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:42,240

3508
03:35:10,650 --> 03:35:12,090
No, no, wow.

3509
03:35:15,460 --> 03:35:17,520
Oh my god, they have a junk as well.

3510
03:35:18,180 --> 03:35:19,600
Was this a junk from the last game?

3511
03:35:19,740 --> 03:35:20,260
I can't tell.

3512
03:35:21,460 --> 03:35:21,900
No!

3513
03:35:23,420 --> 03:35:24,620
Wait, the ram's anti.

3514
03:35:24,700 --> 03:35:25,100
You can die.

3515
03:35:25,160 --> 03:35:26,300
Can he?

3516
03:35:26,600 --> 03:35:27,100
Are you sure?

3517
03:35:27,680 --> 03:35:28,660
Are you sure about that?

3518
03:35:29,520 --> 03:35:32,100
Are you... Are you 100% about that?

3519
03:35:32,860 --> 03:35:34,340
Are you... Okay, nice.

3520
03:35:35,140 --> 03:35:35,740
He can die.

3521
03:35:36,300 --> 03:35:37,180
He's anti-ed again.

3522
03:35:37,480 --> 03:35:37,900
Good job.

3523
03:35:39,160 --> 03:35:40,500
I can keep doing this forever.

3524
03:35:42,440 --> 03:35:42,960
Okay.

3525
03:35:43,560 --> 03:35:46,280
I actually might have to go Kirko because they have Ana.

3526
03:35:47,360 --> 03:35:47,920
Oh wait, they don't!

3527
03:35:47,940 --> 03:35:48,660
They don't have Ana!

3528
03:35:48,800 --> 03:35:49,380
I can stay!

3529
03:35:52,880 --> 03:35:54,120
I can stay Ana!

3530
03:35:55,160 --> 03:35:56,000
to go Kiriko!

3531
03:35:56,700 --> 03:35:58,660
Oh my god.

3532
03:35:59,520 --> 03:36:02,800
Oh, saw a light flash by before my eyes.

3533
03:36:04,280 --> 03:36:06,760
Okay, well I have nano in like one game.

3534
03:36:07,120 --> 03:36:07,560
Holy shit.

3535
03:36:08,100 --> 03:36:09,180
I just built it off of...

3536
03:36:09,180 --> 03:36:10,980
That means they had DPL assault soon.

3537
03:36:11,400 --> 03:36:13,540
Because I fucking farmed this nano off of.

3538
03:36:14,860 --> 03:36:15,420
What?

3539
03:36:15,640 --> 03:36:16,960
Alright, I take those.

3540
03:36:23,350 --> 03:36:23,910
Okay.

3541
03:36:24,930 --> 03:36:25,230
Go!

3542
03:36:28,010 --> 03:36:29,310
Just do anything.

3543
03:36:30,030 --> 03:36:30,990
Just do anything.

3544
03:36:31,790 --> 03:36:33,070
Just to see anything, Nano.

3545
03:36:34,690 --> 03:36:35,110
There you go.

3546
03:36:35,810 --> 03:36:36,690
I just don't miss.

3547
03:36:38,610 --> 03:36:40,750
It only took four hours to warm up, guys.

3548
03:36:43,590 --> 03:36:47,290
It just took four hours to warm up, but we're here now.

3549
03:36:48,510 --> 03:36:48,890
We're here.

3550
03:36:48,990 --> 03:36:49,640
We made it.

3551
03:36:51,290 --> 03:36:52,930
We fucking made it!

3552
03:36:54,830 --> 03:36:55,310
Aw.

3553
03:36:56,990 --> 03:36:58,090
Where's the pharaoh?

3554
03:36:59,390 --> 03:37:01,710
I was like, does he exist in my game?

3555
03:37:04,410 --> 03:37:06,010
Guys, I also hit those.

3556
03:37:07,510 --> 03:37:08,550
Let's see.

3557
03:37:09,070 --> 03:37:10,110
Oh, he's so dead.

3558
03:37:10,890 --> 03:37:12,050
He's so fucking dead.

3559
03:37:13,210 --> 03:37:14,030
He's so dead.

3560
03:37:15,390 --> 03:37:15,910
He's...

3561
03:37:15,910 --> 03:37:16,750
I'm not okay.

3562
03:37:16,890 --> 03:37:17,310
I lied.

3563
03:37:18,010 --> 03:37:19,550
Why did he not run out?

3564
03:37:21,370 --> 03:37:23,170
Alright, I guess I'll back up a little.

3565
03:37:23,910 --> 03:37:24,930
I guess I'll, thank you.

3566
03:37:24,930 --> 03:37:26,810
The junk rat helped me back up.

3567
03:37:28,370 --> 03:37:29,350
Oh, all right.

3568
03:37:29,470 --> 03:37:30,670
And we all split up.

3569
03:37:31,670 --> 03:37:31,910
Please.

3570
03:37:33,190 --> 03:37:34,170
Oh my god.

3571
03:37:34,330 --> 03:37:35,130
Thank you.

3572
03:37:36,550 --> 03:37:37,230
Thank you.

3573
03:37:40,030 --> 03:37:41,150
Oh my god, we're okay.

3574
03:37:42,110 --> 03:37:43,230
I told you I'll be okay.

3575
03:37:43,590 --> 03:37:44,910
I'm going left side.

3576
03:37:46,650 --> 03:37:46,990
All right.

3577
03:37:47,130 --> 03:37:49,110
All DPS are at different angles.

3578
03:37:49,650 --> 03:37:50,350
Where do we go?

3579
03:37:50,470 --> 03:37:51,190
I don't know.

3580
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:52,030
Okay.

3581
03:37:57,070 --> 03:38:00,630
Which is the right side to look at, I don't know.

3582
03:38:00,650 --> 03:38:01,630
Oh, my HP.

3583
03:38:03,490 --> 03:38:03,950
There you go.

3584
03:38:04,870 --> 03:38:05,470
It is winnable!

3585
03:38:06,330 --> 03:38:07,150
I come back doom.

3586
03:38:07,810 --> 03:38:09,350
Oh, he's just better.

3587
03:38:09,690 --> 03:38:09,950
He's still winnable.

3588
03:38:10,330 --> 03:38:11,110
He's just better.

3589
03:38:13,710 --> 03:38:15,050
I told you.

3590
03:38:15,630 --> 03:38:16,370
We'll be fine.

3591
03:38:18,410 --> 03:38:19,290
I missed.

3592
03:38:22,010 --> 03:38:23,070
He has to die.

3593
03:38:27,640 --> 03:38:28,900
No, we lost our fucking...

3594
03:38:28,900 --> 03:38:30,220
I'm not even curious, so this is winnable.

3595
03:38:31,260 --> 03:38:31,800
Is it?

3596
03:38:34,700 --> 03:38:36,960
It didn't feel winnable for me!

3597
03:38:38,460 --> 03:38:40,260
Oh, wait, they flipped, they flipped.

3598
03:38:41,420 --> 03:38:42,420
Oh, it is winnable!

3599
03:38:42,540 --> 03:38:43,040
It is!

3600
03:38:45,220 --> 03:38:46,720
My first death, no!

3601
03:38:49,460 --> 03:38:51,280
My first death, no!

3602
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:54,200
I'm so...

3603
03:38:54,200 --> 03:38:55,600
Okay, he apologized, so it's okay.

3604
03:38:55,700 --> 03:38:57,540

No, we can do this.

3609
03:39:36,380 --> 03:39:38,800
First game, watching the other healer carry.

3610
03:39:38,920 --> 03:39:40,760

3644
03:41:55,530 --> 03:42:00,790

3706
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:11,120
Barbecue lover.

3707
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:12,520
Oh, my God.

3708
03:47:13,660 --> 03:47:14,940

3709
03:47:16,920 --> 03:47:17,220
Yeah.

3710
03:47:17,620 --> 03:47:21,140

03:47:22,700 --> 03:47:23,660

3715
03:47:28,280 --> 03:47:29,160
I almost forgot.

3716
03:47:29,400 --> 03:47:30,420
He must be British.

3717
03:47:31,240 --> 03:47:31,720
Guys.

3718
03:47:33,220 --> 03:47:35,680
He must love the BBC News.

3719
03:47:36,100 --> 03:47:37,340
He's from British.

3720
03:47:37,620 --> 03:47:39,260
He's playing on any servers.

3721
03:47:39,560 --> 03:47:42,140
He's EU playing on NA servers.

3722
03:47:43,100 --> 03:47:44,200
It has to be it.

3723
03:47:46,660 --> 03:47:47,380
Sure.

3724
03:47:48,340 --> 03:47:49,420
What else could it be?

3725
03:47:49,760 --> 03:47:50,820
I don't understand.

3726
03:47:52,220 --> 03:47:55,320
If it's not the BBC News, what else could it be?

3727
03:47:55,860 --> 03:47:57,880
There's no other alternatives.

3728
03:47:58,600 --> 03:48:00,860
The BBC News is copyrighted.

3729
03:48:00,980 --> 03:48:01,960
It's trademarked.

3730
03:48:05,240 --> 03:48:10,440
Guys, all I'm saying, NBC News is trademarked, so it can't
be anything else.

3731
03:48:15,270 --> 03:48:15,770
Oh my god.

3732
03:48:16,010 --> 03:48:18,470
This fucking ham is just going a merry-go-round.

3733
03:48:20,950 --> 03:48:21,390
Oh.

3734
03:48:22,050 --> 03:48:22,530
Poor.

3735
03:48:22,710 --> 03:48:23,810

3736
03:48:23,810 --> 03:48:26,010
I think we are...

3737
03:48:26,010 --> 03:48:26,610
Oh.

3738
03:48:27,870 --> 03:48:29,270
I missed through that.

3739
03:48:29,570 --> 03:48:31,290
I missed through that hard.

3740
03:48:33,610 --> 03:48:34,090
Goodbye.

3741
03:48:34,730 --> 03:48:35,150
They don't know.

3742
03:48:35,410 --> 03:48:37,350
They do, they do, they do, they do, they do, they do, they
do.

3743
03:48:38,490 --> 03:48:39,690
They didn't know that.

3744
03:48:41,690 --> 03:48:43,350
Oh my god, you live.

3745
03:48:44,270 --> 03:48:45,390
Wait, this is reconcilable.

3746
03:48:45,590 --> 03:48:46,430
That is a huge red.

3747
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:49,410
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3748

Huge cleanse.

3750
03:48:53,090 --> 03:48:54,530
I mean, it was pretty big.

3751
03:48:55,170 --> 03:48:56,790
This is big as BBC News.

3752
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:02,130
There you go.

3753
03:49:02,510 --> 03:49:02,630

03:49:11,590 --> 03:49:12,050
We can kill Brig.

3756
03:49:12,170 --> 03:49:12,630

3815
03:54:51,140 --> 03:54:56,980
I live for so long on the cart because no one else wants to
go on the cart.

3816
03:54:57,540 --> 03:55:00,300
Why is the port on the cart duty?

3817
03:55:00,960 --> 03:55:01,620
Why?

3818
03:55:02,300 --> 03:55:02,920
Why?

3819
03:55:10,010 --> 03:55:13,750
The poor Anna has to be on cart duty.

3820
03:55:13,990 --> 03:55:15,090
The old lady.

3821
03:55:20,050 --> 03:55:21,850
Somebody give me a life alert.

3822
03:55:22,290 --> 03:55:25,230
This old lady should not be on cart duty.

3823
03:55:26,230 --> 03:55:27,890
Please BBC News.

3824
03:55:28,310 --> 03:55:29,590
Save us.

3825
03:55:31,730 --> 03:55:33,950
I've got a good feeling.

3826
03:55:34,510 --> 03:55:35,170
This could be something.

We'll be so relaxed by then.

3831
03:56:17,470 --> 03:56:19,850
Why can't the BBC news help us?

3832
03:56:20,150 --> 03:56:21,290
I don't understand.

3833
03:56:23,150 --> 03:56:24,870
There's a reason why I don't want to go.

3834
03:56:26,950 --> 03:56:28,150
I can't.

3835
03:56:28,610 --> 03:56:30,730
Maybe I should care.

3836
03:56:31,770 --> 03:56:32,890
More on the mercy.

3837
03:56:33,010 --> 03:56:33,850
No, no, no, not ready.

3838
03:56:33,990 --> 03:56:34,350
Not ready.

3839
03:56:38,610 --> 03:56:41,410
Why did I decide to play fucking Kiriko?

3840
03:56:42,230 --> 03:56:44,890
I knew playing Kiriko was a mistake.

3841
03:56:46,810 --> 03:56:47,590
I knew it.

3842
03:56:48,430 --> 03:56:49,850
I knew it was a mistake.

3843
03:56:51,010 --> 03:56:53,730
The game give if and the game take it the way.

3844
03:56:57,390 --> 03:56:58,430
Holy shit.

3845
03:56:58,650 --> 03:57:00,110
We like stuffed that ball.

3846
03:57:03,630 --> 03:57:05,070
That ball.

3847
03:57:06,310 --> 03:57:06,850
That ball.

3848
03:57:08,610 --> 03:57:12,370
ball needs to be put down in the game.

3849
03:57:16,610 --> 03:57:16,810
Ugh.

3850
03:57:17,890 --> 03:57:18,810
He's old.

3851
03:57:18,990 --> 03:57:19,890
He's too old.

3852
03:57:21,330 --> 03:57:21,910
Alright, here you go.

3853
03:57:23,810 --> 03:57:25,430
That body ball was really good, though.

3854
03:57:28,130 --> 03:57:33,350
All I'm saying is that that ball has lived past his life.

3855
03:57:36,630 --> 03:57:38,230
I swear to God.

3856
03:57:39,130 --> 03:57:40,750
Put that rodent down.

3857
03:57:40,950 --> 03:57:42,110
It's a pest.

3858
03:57:42,130 --> 03:57:47,230
Oh my god, he's so low!

3859
03:57:48,650 --> 03:57:49,710
Someone quick!

3860
03:57:54,150 --> 03:57:59,250
We literally, okay, honestly, all we need is just a Sombra.

3861
03:57:59,730 --> 03:58:00,990
That's literally all we need.

3862
03:58:01,490 --> 03:58:01,990
That's weird.

3863
03:58:05,570 --> 03:58:06,950
Oh, we do have a Sombra!

3864
03:58:08,610 --> 03:58:10,230
This is how irrelevant our Sombra was.

3865
03:58:10,370 --> 03:58:11,770
I didn't even know we had a Sombra.

3866
03:58:12,510 --> 03:58:15,350
Guys, our Sombra should not have been pushing the cart.

3867
03:58:15,510 --> 03:58:16,470
I'm sorry.

3868
03:58:18,270 --> 03:58:20,190
Sombra should not have been pushing.

3869
03:58:20,590 --> 03:58:24,110
He needs to be out there to get rid of this rodent
infestation.

3870
03:58:24,310 --> 03:58:25,290
Our cast is half his feet.

3871
03:58:27,270 --> 03:58:27,770
Okay.

3872
03:58:28,730 --> 03:58:29,390
Bye-bye.

3873
03:58:31,550 --> 03:58:32,290

03:59:31,450 --> 03:59:32,470

We're very capable of killing the brick here.

3899

Break, break, break, break, break, break.

It's okay.

4037
04:10:35,110 --> 04:10:36,370
It's not okay.

4038
04:10:39,110 --> 04:10:41,290

4044
04:10:55,030 --> 04:10:56,870

4045
04:10:59,490 --> 04:11:00,050
Guys.

4046
04:11:00,810 --> 04:11:02,970

04:11:10,890 --> 04:11:12,630
Oh my god.

4048
04:11:13,390 --> 04:11:13,950

04:11:13,950 --> 04:11:15,470
Maybe I'll break.

4050
04:11:17,970 --> 04:11:18,530

4051
04:11:19,210 --> 04:11:24,970
Stay close to me and I'll keep you safe.

4052
04:11:25,090 --> 04:11:25,950
Maybe this is it.

4053
04:11:26,970 --> 04:11:30,230
Maybe all I need to do is play break as well.

4054
04:11:32,830 --> 04:11:45,630
yeah we can use cure yeah yeah up the win rate yeah that
that seems right guys guys maybe it's if i was brink maybe

We're going to win five games in a row after that.

04:14:13,200 --> 04:14:17,080
This is exactly where our luck changes.

4079
04:14:21,130 --> 04:14:22,010
This is it.

4080
04:14:26,870 --> 04:14:28,570

If you look at Ruben's Twitch bots, he fucking streams 18
plus hours of Overwatch every fucking day.

It's literally- Guys, I've just been targeted, okay?

I could be masters so easily, I've just been targeted.

4118
04:17:46,190 --> 04:18:02,270
I swear I can easily get masters It's just streaming the
grind Is a lot more difficult They don't care Yeah yeah It's

4119
04:18:02,270 --> 04:18:09,930

04:19:22,120 --> 04:19:22,440

Yeah, it is.

4136
04:19:53,600 --> 04:19:57,560
It made the hog turn around and try and look for me.

4137
04:19:58,040 --> 04:20:05,940
So it was intentional because the hog turn around forced a
bad positioning and then let's my team, uh, it let my team

4138
04:20:05,940 --> 04:20:06,500
push up.

4139
04:20:11,370 --> 04:20:12,590
Candle didn't shoot the fair.

4140
04:20:12,890 --> 04:20:15,070
If he shot the fair, I could have got the Rizzo.

4141
04:20:17,110 --> 04:20:17,930
Oh, no.

4142
04:20:18,090 --> 04:20:18,970

04:20:48,620 --> 04:20:49,540
I lost last game.

4156
04:20:50,380 --> 04:20:50,820
Yeah.

4157
04:20:51,380 --> 04:20:51,660
Yay!

4158
04:20:55,420 --> 04:20:56,200
There we go.

4159
04:20:56,960 --> 04:20:57,640
We're doing it.

4160
04:20:57,740 --> 04:20:58,200
We're fine.

4161
04:21:00,240 --> 04:21:02,260
Joki, when will you stop playing Overwatch?

4162
04:21:03,380 --> 04:21:03,920
Stop?

4163
04:21:11,520 --> 04:21:12,920
When's stream gonna end?

4164
04:21:13,360 --> 04:21:13,820
End?

4165
04:21:14,420 --> 04:21:16,060
Let me see what I can do.

4166
04:21:21,380 --> 04:21:23,800
You're never getting off this wild rives.

4167
04:21:26,340 --> 04:21:27,500
Look at that.

4168
04:21:27,960 --> 04:21:29,400
Peak mercy gameplay.

4169
04:21:35,080 --> 04:21:35,640
End?

4170
04:21:37,100 --> 04:21:39,020
How does one stop?

4171
04:21:39,520 --> 04:21:45,220
Look, all I'm saying is that if I wasn't streaming my
gameplay, we would have been masters.

4172
04:21:45,400 --> 04:21:47,060
We would have been like masters too.

4173
04:21:47,620 --> 04:21:49,680
Alright guys, I'm not coping.

4174
04:21:49,820 --> 04:21:50,460
It's the truth.

4175
04:21:51,380 --> 04:21:53,120
Is 100% the truth.

4176
04:21:53,420 --> 04:21:54,300
I'm not coping.

4177
04:21:56,180 --> 04:21:56,720
And?

4178
04:21:59,340 --> 04:22:01,800
It's because, you know, I have to entertain.

4179
04:22:02,760 --> 04:22:04,040
And I have to...

4180
04:22:04,040 --> 04:22:05,380
Oh my god.

4181
04:22:05,640 --> 04:22:07,200
That's fucked up.

4182
04:22:07,220 --> 04:22:08,540
Oh my god.

4183
04:22:11,600 --> 04:22:13,900

4184
04:22:14,120 --> 04:22:14,720

4185
04:22:14,980 --> 04:22:15,340
There you go.

4186
04:22:15,460 --> 04:22:15,540

4208
04:23:41,410 --> 04:23:42,390
Alright, let's see.

4209
04:23:42,630 --> 04:23:42,850
Okay.

4210
04:23:42,870 --> 04:23:47,110
This guy was top 500 in Overwatch 1, season 1.

4211
04:23:47,910 --> 04:23:48,970
Damn, he's watched as hell.

4212
04:23:49,570 --> 04:23:50,470
Alright, Junkertown.

4213
04:23:52,250 --> 04:23:52,840

Don't worry.

4217
04:24:01,710 --> 04:24:03,930
I did not expect to stream this long today.

4218
04:24:05,470 --> 04:24:10,830
I get into these phases in gaming where...

4219
04:24:10,830 --> 04:24:12,030
I suddenly just...

4220
04:24:12,870 --> 04:24:14,710
I just can't stop playing.

4221
04:24:18,290 --> 04:24:22,910
Overwatch is like my biggest problem when it comes to that.

4222
04:24:24,770 --> 04:24:28,630
It's like when I get into like a stride, it's just so hard
to stop.

4223
04:24:30,010 --> 04:24:32,550
It's just so fucking hard to stop when it comes to
Overwatch.

4224
04:24:35,250 --> 04:24:36,690
Yo, yo, yo.

4225
04:24:38,690 --> 04:24:40,150

Let's look at soldier.

4304
04:30:05,950 --> 04:30:06,530

I'll keep you alive!

4307
04:30:12,030 --> 04:30:12,950

You're alive!

4311
04:30:18,090 --> 04:30:18,570
Magic.

4312
04:30:23,610 --> 04:30:25,810
Oh, that is a very good hook.

4313
04:30:29,550 --> 04:30:30,650
Wait, what?

4314
04:30:31,490 --> 04:30:33,050
Here's somebody behind us.

4315
04:30:33,570 --> 04:30:35,270
Oh, there he is.

4316
04:30:36,510 --> 04:30:38,290

04:30:50,370 --> 04:30:51,310
I'm getting involved.

4324
04:30:51,470 --> 04:30:52,510
I'm pushing up too.

He'll be fine.

4326

He has the Joe Keeper with a negative win rate on Kirko.

4327
04:30:58,750 --> 04:31:00,090
He'll be fine.

4328
04:31:03,550 --> 04:31:05,890
What's the worst that could happen?

4329
04:31:10,350 --> 04:31:10,390
Oh!

4330
04:31:15,830 --> 04:31:19,010
Alright, I can't save, like...

4331
04:31:19,010 --> 04:31:20,910

Like, he fucking exploded.

4333
04:31:24,270 --> 04:31:24,910
Okay.

4334
04:31:26,290 --> 04:31:30,370
That was like a fucking nuclear fucking bomb right there.

4335
04:31:31,090 --> 04:31:33,170
Basically brought on the next fallout.

4336
04:31:35,770 --> 04:31:37,070
Oh, he was low though.

4337
04:31:37,870 --> 04:31:39,070
That's what happened.

4338
04:31:41,470 --> 04:31:41,770
Okay.

4339
04:31:42,050 --> 04:31:43,610
He's giving me all charge.

4340
04:31:44,490 --> 04:31:44,930
It's okay.

4341
04:31:45,850 --> 04:31:46,810
I love all charge.

4342
04:31:49,730 --> 04:31:50,250
Got it?

4343
04:31:53,370 --> 04:31:54,730
Oh, he's so low, he's so low.

4344
04:31:55,390 --> 04:31:57,110
It's so low!

4345
04:32:00,050 --> 04:32:00,750
And he missed!

4346
04:32:01,330 --> 04:32:01,410
Oh!

4347
04:32:02,470 --> 04:32:04,250
There's no way you can die from this!

4348
04:32:04,610 --> 04:32:06,770
There's no way you're getting pocketed so hard!

4349
04:32:08,370 --> 04:32:08,930
I'm leaving!

4350
04:32:11,470 --> 04:32:12,670
If you die, you die!

4351
04:32:18,890 --> 04:32:19,390
Where?

4352
04:32:20,090 --> 04:32:20,930
Oh, there.

4353
04:32:23,510 --> 04:32:26,350
I mean, I'm fucking try my best here.

4354
04:32:29,590 --> 04:32:30,810
Oh, I guess I'll leave.

4355
04:32:31,330 --> 04:32:32,590
Oh, wait, this is last fight!

4356
04:32:32,870 --> 04:32:33,250
No!

4357
04:32:34,690 --> 04:32:36,430
This was last fight!

4358
04:32:40,230 --> 04:32:40,670
Alright.

4359
04:32:41,430 --> 04:32:43,470
Guys, why did no one tell me it was last fight?

4360
04:32:45,790 --> 04:32:47,550
Guys, nobody said anything.

4361
04:32:50,630 --> 04:32:51,570
Wait, did we touch it?

4362
04:32:51,790 --> 04:32:52,630
Guys, did we touch it?

4363
04:32:52,630 --> 04:32:53,930
Not bad, but it's fine.

4364
04:32:55,390 --> 04:32:57,750
Did we... Did we touch it?

4365
04:33:00,210 --> 04:33:01,810
Leaving in the last...

4366
04:33:01,810 --> 04:33:04,890
How is I supposed to know it was last fight?

4367
04:33:06,630 --> 04:33:07,250
How?

4368
04:33:10,530 --> 04:33:13,050
Why did no one tell me?

4369
04:33:14,290 --> 04:33:15,570
Guys, I can't remind.

4370
04:33:15,790 --> 04:33:16,990
Anyway, I need to do my...

4371
04:33:16,990 --> 04:33:18,530
I need to do my waiting room.

4372
04:33:19,030 --> 04:33:21,290
Okay, good night, dragons.

4373
04:33:22,650 --> 04:33:23,270
Dragons.

4374
04:33:24,910 --> 04:33:28,080
Okay, the waiting room is here.

4375
04:33:29,930 --> 04:33:31,640
I sure...

4376
04:33:32,210 --> 04:33:36,230
Time for some post-overwatch.

4377
04:33:37,290 --> 04:33:39,770
Overwatch last game.

4378
04:33:40,650 --> 04:33:41,950
Last game.

4379
04:33:43,010 --> 04:33:44,950
Stress relief.

4380
04:33:47,670 --> 04:33:50,610
Wait, the time for some post-overwatch relaxing time.

4381
04:33:50,930 --> 04:33:54,890
Because I totally got Masters back.

4382
04:33:54,910 --> 04:33:56,530
There you go.

4383
04:33:56,630 --> 04:33:57,330
There you go.

4384
04:33:57,470 --> 04:33:58,190
I did it.

4385
04:33:58,350 --> 04:33:59,490
And is this a white raiding room?

4386
04:34:00,290 --> 04:34:01,150
How many seconds do I have?

4387
04:34:01,230 --> 04:34:01,590
20 seconds.

4388
04:34:01,690 --> 04:34:02,850
I can get there in 20 seconds.

4389
04:34:03,330 --> 04:34:03,890
There you go.

4390
04:34:05,430 --> 04:34:05,790
All right.

4391
04:34:05,950 --> 04:34:07,750
We're doing this my way.

4392
04:34:08,410 --> 04:34:10,030
I can get there in 20 seconds.

4393
04:34:10,770 --> 04:34:10,790
See?

4394
04:34:13,170 --> 04:34:13,570
Mercy.

4395
04:34:13,870 --> 04:34:14,790
Was he always mercy?

4396
04:34:18,570 --> 04:34:20,050
Oh no, she was like Mora.

4397
04:34:22,630 --> 04:34:22,830
Hey.

4398
04:34:24,490 --> 04:34:26,070
Why damage boost me?

4399
04:34:26,230 --> 04:34:27,550
I'm fucking...

4400
04:34:27,550 --> 04:34:29,330
Oh my god.

4401
04:34:32,070 --> 04:34:33,170
That's okay.

4402
04:34:33,730 --> 04:34:34,630
We just regrouped.

4403
04:34:35,370 --> 04:34:35,810
Okay.

4404
04:34:36,690 --> 04:34:38,990
Um, this is looking positive already.

4405
04:34:40,750 --> 04:34:43,590
It's looking okey-dokie right here.

4406
04:34:44,930 --> 04:34:47,370
Very okey-dokie right here.

4407
04:34:48,590 --> 04:34:49,430
Okay.

4408
04:34:49,990 --> 04:34:50,450
Okay.

4409
04:34:50,850 --> 04:34:51,330
Okay.

4410
04:34:51,330 --> 04:34:51,990
Hey, big guy.

4411
04:34:52,810 --> 04:34:53,210
Okay.

4412
04:34:53,230 --> 04:34:53,970
Very fine.

4413
04:34:54,270 --> 04:34:55,270
I feel so healthy.

4414
04:34:57,230 --> 04:34:59,330
I feel so very healthy.

4415
04:35:04,530 --> 04:35:05,970
Bro, the Ana's just there by himself!

4416
04:35:07,610 --> 04:35:09,090
I think I made an error.

4417
04:35:09,710 --> 04:35:10,530
No, you didn't!

4418
04:35:11,030 --> 04:35:12,050
No, you didn't!

4419
04:35:12,310 --> 04:35:15,390
You don't die!

4420
04:35:18,670 --> 04:35:19,210
Those!

4421
04:35:20,550 --> 04:35:21,470
Where is this?

4422
04:35:22,050 --> 04:35:23,610
Where is this Weedo?

4423
04:35:23,890 --> 04:35:25,110
Oh, okay, wait a minute.

4424
04:35:25,850 --> 04:35:26,290
Oh, hog.

4425
04:35:26,510 --> 04:35:27,110
Oh, hog.

4426
04:35:27,790 --> 04:35:28,370
Oh, hog.

4427
04:35:29,230 --> 04:35:31,070
Okay, we're fine.

4428
04:35:31,350 --> 04:35:33,350
She hits those.

4429
04:35:33,470 --> 04:35:34,550
That's right, she is me.

4430
04:35:35,310 --> 04:35:36,970
Oh, never peeking again.

4431
04:35:37,370 --> 04:35:37,470
Never...

4432
04:35:37,470 --> 04:35:41,330
Never peeking again!

4433
04:35:44,930 --> 04:35:46,330
Just don't peek.

4434
04:35:49,210 --> 04:35:50,550
She is me.

4435
04:35:51,190 --> 04:35:52,150
I is her.

4436
04:35:53,570 --> 04:35:54,110
There you go.

4437
04:35:54,730 --> 04:35:57,290
This is exactly why I went Kiriko.

4438
04:35:57,810 --> 04:35:58,490
Oh no.

4439
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:03,810
Oh, oh, please don't get headshot.

4440
04:36:04,070 --> 04:36:04,890
Please don't get headshot.

4441
04:36:05,430 --> 04:36:06,450
Please don't get headshot.

4442
04:36:08,550 --> 04:36:13,210
Oh, well, please both my teammates don't get headshot.

4443
04:36:13,830 --> 04:36:14,570
That's all I would.

4444
04:36:18,490 --> 04:36:18,830
No.

4445
04:36:21,170 --> 04:36:22,670
Yeah, I'm one too.

4446
04:36:26,650 --> 04:36:29,210
Why is everybody peaking that way?

4447
04:36:29,230 --> 04:36:45,130

4450
04:37:04,540 --> 04:37:06,380
Oh my god!

4451
04:37:06,660 --> 04:37:07,600
That's sad.

4452
04:37:09,560 --> 04:37:10,900
That's sad.

4453
04:37:13,060 --> 04:37:14,700
That's so sad.

4454
04:37:18,360 --> 04:37:19,600
That's so sad.

4455
04:37:23,220 --> 04:37:26,600
Please somebody save me.

4456
04:37:32,680 --> 04:37:34,480
We can recontest this.

4457
04:37:34,540 --> 04:37:35,300
Oh my god.

4458
04:37:36,100 --> 04:37:37,040
I might be a liar.

4459
04:37:38,280 --> 04:37:38,580
Yes.

4460
04:37:38,880 --> 04:37:39,480
I'm definitely a liar.

4461
04:37:40,320 --> 04:37:42,200
The win streak starts next game.

4462
04:37:43,160 --> 04:37:43,960
I swear.

4463
04:37:46,980 --> 04:37:49,500
The win streak will start next game.

4464
04:37:50,440 --> 04:37:52,880
Because I don't think this game is it.

4465
04:37:54,100 --> 04:37:55,140
I know.

4466
04:37:57,080 --> 04:37:58,680
Can we kill Hog to blow?

4467
04:37:58,940 --> 04:37:59,640
I don't know.

4468
04:37:59,820 --> 04:38:00,280
Can we?

4469
04:38:00,700 --> 04:38:03,700
No one can hide from my sight.

4470
04:38:06,480 --> 04:38:09,140
Oh, whoop, whoop, whoop.

4471
04:38:09,520 --> 04:38:10,660
I'm so sad.

4472
04:38:11,460 --> 04:38:15,420
Oh my god, the very first widow kill we've ever got.

4473
04:38:16,740 --> 04:38:18,040
Oh, okay, he went up.

4474
04:38:18,720 --> 04:38:19,860
That's actually crazy.

4475
04:38:20,060 --> 04:38:20,860
We did it, guys.

4476
04:38:21,540 --> 04:38:22,100
Congratulations.

4477
04:38:23,100 --> 04:38:24,120
We did the bare minimum.

4478
04:38:28,390 --> 04:38:30,270
We actually did the bare minimum.

4479
04:38:30,530 --> 04:38:31,770
I'm so proud of you all.

4480
04:38:33,230 --> 04:38:34,390
Oh!

4481
04:38:40,530 --> 04:38:41,690
Missed.

4482
04:38:41,850 --> 04:38:42,990
Give me all charge.

4483
04:38:46,910 --> 04:38:47,770
Their cast is one.

4484
04:38:48,650 --> 04:38:49,110
Oh, nice.

4485
04:38:49,730 --> 04:38:49,930
Whoa.

4486
04:38:51,810 --> 04:38:52,390
Okay.

4487
04:38:55,750 --> 04:38:56,330
Okay.

4488
04:39:01,090 --> 04:39:02,250
Okay.

4489
04:39:03,370 --> 04:39:03,970
Oh!

4490
04:39:04,210 --> 04:39:10,310
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure he was not meant.

4491
04:39:10,570 --> 04:39:11,050
Oh, there we go.

4492
04:39:11,230 --> 04:39:11,970
He hit me.

4493
04:39:12,030 --> 04:39:13,650
He hit me.

4494
04:39:16,450 --> 04:39:17,730
Oh, my God.

4495
04:39:18,430 --> 04:39:19,150
They did it.

4496
04:39:20,690 --> 04:39:20,710
Guys.

4497
04:39:21,070 --> 04:39:22,430
They used nano at least.

4498
04:39:22,970 --> 04:39:24,390
Guys, this team.

4499
04:39:25,330 --> 04:39:26,210
I'm almost back.

4500
04:39:26,290 --> 04:39:27,370
This team might not be it.

4501
04:39:28,110 --> 04:39:29,190
This team might not be it.

4502
04:39:32,390 --> 04:39:32,910
Goodbye.

4503
04:39:38,070 --> 04:39:40,050
This team was just not it.

4504
04:39:45,010 --> 04:39:46,450
It was just...

4505
04:39:46,450 --> 04:39:48,290
This team was just not it, guys.

4506
04:39:48,410 --> 04:39:50,230
It was just...

4507
04:39:50,230 --> 04:39:50,810
You know.

4508
04:39:51,350 --> 04:39:52,790
There was nothing we could do.

4509
04:39:55,370 --> 04:39:57,110
It took us...

4510
04:39:57,110 --> 04:40:02,610
It took us 10 deaths for our widow to out-widdle the widow.

4511
04:40:06,610 --> 04:40:07,870
It was just that.

4512
04:40:08,730 --> 04:40:09,830
It really was.

4513
04:40:10,490 --> 04:40:23,350
not it that's not it next match surely it's the next match
is when our win street starts i believe

4514
04:40:26,790 --> 04:40:36,190

need a refund on my insurance though

4515
04:40:43,450 --> 04:40:46,890
I think my... I might need a refund.

4516
04:40:51,410 --> 04:40:54,110

04:55:46,380 --> 04:55:47,440
Lose, win.

4683
04:55:50,120 --> 04:55:51,360
This is fucked up.

4684
04:55:51,640 --> 04:55:53,460
What if I match fix this right now?

4685
04:55:55,820 --> 04:55:57,540
But like, I should have said that out loud.

4686
04:55:57,740 --> 04:56:02,200
So if I like, you know, whichever pool has the most money,
and then somehow...

4687
04:56:05,200 --> 04:56:05,600
Okay.

4688
04:56:05,820 --> 04:56:06,740
There's a line behind us.

4689
04:56:07,560 --> 04:56:08,260
We're okay.

4690
04:56:08,400 --> 04:56:09,080
Completely alone.

4691
04:56:09,380 --> 04:56:10,040
Without shatter.

4692
04:56:12,500 --> 04:56:13,620
What is he gonna do?

4693
04:56:13,740 --> 04:56:14,360
Kill us?

4694
04:56:15,540 --> 04:56:16,560
See, we're fine.

4695
04:56:17,380 --> 04:56:18,500
Oh my god, there's a soul.

4696
04:56:18,520 --> 04:56:19,940
behind us.

4697
04:56:20,300 --> 04:56:21,040
Kill the soldier!

4698
04:56:23,100 --> 04:56:23,660
Nice.

4699
04:56:23,920 --> 04:56:24,800
Soldier's dead.

4700
04:56:26,600 --> 04:56:27,100
Soldier's dead.

4701
04:56:29,980 --> 04:56:31,080
Get this more off me!

4702
04:56:31,860 --> 04:56:32,260
Do it.

4703
04:56:32,380 --> 04:56:32,720
Okay.

4704
04:56:32,720 --> 04:56:33,520
Kill our...

4705
04:56:33,520 --> 04:56:34,240
Okay, we're fine.

4706
04:56:34,400 --> 04:56:34,660
We're back.

4707
04:56:35,060 --> 04:56:38,720
Betting your favor never seems to work, so I'm betting
against you now.

4708
04:56:39,060 --> 04:56:40,220
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

4709
04:56:40,460 --> 04:56:40,580
Thank you.

4710
04:56:40,900 --> 04:56:41,340
Thank you.

4711
04:56:42,100 --> 04:56:42,680
Look at that.

4712
04:56:46,760 --> 04:56:48,460
E-Sports cabinet.

4713
04:56:48,520 --> 04:56:52,500
is now legal in 37 states.

4714
04:56:52,860 --> 04:56:54,140
I'm Canadian!

4715
04:56:56,640 --> 04:56:58,220
Wait, it's more legal.

4716
04:56:58,660 --> 04:56:59,400
Wait, never mind.

4717
04:56:59,680 --> 04:57:00,080
You're right.

4718
04:57:00,220 --> 04:57:00,800
Wait, it works.

4719
04:57:00,940 --> 04:57:01,460
Never mind.

4720
04:57:02,000 --> 04:57:04,320
It works because it's legal everywhere.

4721
04:57:04,700 --> 04:57:05,620
That's fucking right.

4722
04:57:07,260 --> 04:57:09,300
I forgot about that.

4723
04:57:10,680 --> 04:57:12,560
It's legal everywhere in Canada.

4724
04:57:12,860 --> 04:57:15,360
That's why streamers move to Canada.

4725
04:57:15,580 --> 04:57:18,380
The capo is actually true.

4726
04:57:18,520 --> 04:57:32,680

Okay, I might have been hit.

05:01:30,340 --> 05:01:32,080
Where's the rest of our team?

4791
05:01:33,920 --> 05:01:35,440
Where's the rest of our team?

4792
05:01:35,620 --> 05:01:37,120
Why are they going up?

4793
05:01:37,640 --> 05:01:39,840
Why are they still pushing this?

4794
05:01:40,640 --> 05:01:42,540
After everything we did.

4795
05:01:45,960 --> 05:01:47,240
He's literally won.

4796
05:01:51,160 --> 05:01:51,980
They're trading.

4797
05:01:52,000 --> 05:01:53,920
Oh, god damn it.

4798
05:01:54,820 --> 05:01:55,120
Okay.

4799
05:01:55,840 --> 05:01:56,220
We're fine.

4800
05:01:57,440 --> 05:01:57,840
We're fine.

4801
05:01:59,080 --> 05:02:00,720
Okay, I can swap back to Ana.

4802
05:02:00,920 --> 05:02:02,280
I don't have to play Kiriko anymore.

4803
05:02:03,300 --> 05:02:04,540
Okay, I'm pushing the payload.

4804
05:02:05,140 --> 05:02:06,100
I'm pushing the guy.

4805
05:02:07,940 --> 05:02:08,540
I'm pushing him.

4806
05:02:09,380 --> 05:02:10,380
Here we go.

4807
05:02:10,740 --> 05:02:11,520
Goodbye, Ana.

4808
05:02:12,020 --> 05:02:12,860
Goodbye, Tracer.

4809
05:02:13,400 --> 05:02:14,400
Oh, there they are.

4810
05:02:14,660 --> 05:02:15,500
We need our tank.

4811
05:02:16,080 --> 05:02:16,760
I'm almost there.

4812
05:02:16,940 --> 05:02:18,080
We need our tank.

4813
05:02:18,920 --> 05:02:19,440
Somebody.

4814
05:02:22,000 --> 05:02:23,160
I'm sorry, soldier.

4815
05:02:23,280 --> 05:02:24,980
If you die, you fucking die.

4816
05:02:27,180 --> 05:02:28,180
Okay, that's good.

4817
05:02:28,260 --> 05:02:28,500
That's good.

4818
05:02:28,640 --> 05:02:29,720
Ruben has all...

4819
05:02:31,100 --> 05:02:32,320
Ruben has all...

4820
05:02:32,320 --> 05:02:32,540
Oh!

4821
05:02:33,380 --> 05:02:34,000
It's okay.

4822
05:02:35,800 --> 05:02:37,480
It's not okay anymore.

4823
05:02:38,160 --> 05:02:40,780
It is absolutely not okay anymore.

4824
05:02:41,260 --> 05:02:42,040
It is...

4825
05:02:42,040 --> 05:02:44,880
It is absolutely not.

4826
05:02:45,080 --> 05:02:45,820
Just kill me.

4827
05:02:46,000 --> 05:02:47,620
Just kill me so I don't get staggered.

4828
05:02:52,380 --> 05:03:06,300

05:03:27,610 --> 05:03:28,270
We go back.

4831
05:03:28,870 --> 05:03:31,410
Oh, I wish we can kill a lot of things.

4832
05:03:31,670 --> 05:03:32,690
I'm calling out the DPS warden VC.

4833
05:03:34,250 --> 05:03:35,870
Oh, my God.

4834
05:03:37,430 --> 05:03:41,090
All I'm saying is that you guys bet against me.

4835
05:03:42,530 --> 05:03:45,050
All I'm saying is that I fixed this match, guys.

4836
05:03:45,790 --> 05:03:47,030
The match is fixed.

4837
05:03:47,450 --> 05:03:50,050
The spring defeat.

4838
05:03:55,620 --> 05:03:57,280
Guys, I got the payout.

4839
05:03:58,800 --> 05:04:00,620
Guys, I got the payout.

4840
05:04:03,380 --> 05:04:05,880
It was because I fixed a match.

4841
05:04:06,000 --> 05:04:07,220
I lost intentionally.

4842
05:04:07,720 --> 05:04:10,060
So I got the highest payout possible.

4843
05:04:11,520 --> 05:04:12,820
Looks like chat is right.

4844
05:04:13,100 --> 05:04:14,640
The cycle continues.

4845
05:04:15,320 --> 05:04:15,800
Mamahaku.

4846
05:04:16,000 --> 05:04:16,180
Thank you.

4847
05:04:16,360 --> 05:04:16,880
Super chat.

4848
05:04:17,180 --> 05:04:17,340
Thank you.

4849
05:04:17,380 --> 05:04:18,020
Thank you.

4850
05:04:22,440 --> 05:04:23,020

4851
05:04:23,260 --> 05:04:24,020
I guys.

4852
05:04:24,160 --> 05:04:24,960
It's because.

4853
05:04:26,880 --> 05:04:27,280
It's because.

4854
05:04:27,380 --> 05:04:28,880
I did that on purpose, guys.

4855
05:04:29,160 --> 05:04:30,380
I did that on purpose.

4856
05:04:33,840 --> 05:04:35,020
We're back where we were.

4857
05:04:35,720 --> 05:04:40,200
We're actually back where we were after five hours.

4858
05:04:42,840 --> 05:04:45,480
I deserve to play Mercy at that point.

4859
05:04:47,480 --> 05:04:48,640
I would say get another 10.

4860
05:04:48,720 --> 05:04:50,040
Is this how it works?

4861
05:04:50,400 --> 05:04:51,520

4887
05:07:03,460 --> 05:07:05,140

It was just insurance.

05:10:37,090 --> 05:10:38,070
Oh, goodbye.

4955
05:10:44,820 --> 05:10:46,460

05:16:20,150 --> 05:16:20,430
That's fine.

5040
05:16:22,150 --> 05:16:22,670
Guys!

5041
05:16:23,810 --> 05:16:24,330
Stop!

5042
05:16:25,770 --> 05:16:27,450
I don't have ears!

5043
05:16:29,430 --> 05:16:31,570
You'll have to try harder than that.

5044
05:16:31,870 --> 05:16:32,530
Can we back up a little bit?

5045
05:16:32,590 --> 05:16:33,570
I need to recharge my shield.

5046
05:16:35,970 --> 05:16:36,710
I'm- please.

5047
05:16:36,990 --> 05:16:38,030
I'm so low.

5048
05:16:38,890 --> 05:16:40,530
I'm so far away.

5049
05:16:41,950 --> 05:16:42,350
Please.

5050
05:16:42,850 --> 05:16:43,630
I'm on my way.

5051
05:16:44,630 --> 05:16:45,530
Please, guys.

5052
05:16:48,270 --> 05:16:49,170
Yo, I'm backing up.

5053
05:16:49,290 --> 05:16:49,770
Yo, back up.

5054
05:16:51,950 --> 05:17:08,650
Oh, he definitely has shattered though he 100% has it he
definitely has it I feel the shatter I feel it right here oh

5055
05:17:08,650 --> 05:17:18,830
my god there it is there there it is there it is

5056
05:17:23,710 --> 05:17:24,230
What?

5057
05:17:25,050 --> 05:17:25,210
What?

5058
05:17:26,250 --> 05:17:27,430
There it is!

5059
05:17:29,750 --> 05:17:30,410
All right.

5060
05:17:31,350 --> 05:17:33,770
We reconcast, we reconcast, 100%.

5061
05:17:33,770 --> 05:17:34,770
All right.

5062
05:17:36,390 --> 05:17:37,190
All right.

5063
05:17:37,610 --> 05:17:39,370
There's a lining here, though.

5064
05:17:42,390 --> 05:17:43,150
Oh, here we go.

5065
05:17:44,370 --> 05:17:44,790
Oh, here we go.

5066
05:17:45,330 --> 05:17:45,850
Five.

5067
05:17:51,370 --> 05:17:52,550
Yo, what is it on to do?

5068
05:17:52,690 --> 05:17:52,810
Yo, what is it on to doing?

5069
05:17:53,590 --> 05:17:55,270
Wait, there's an Ana right here.

5070
05:17:58,790 --> 05:18:00,290
I'm gonna go for the soldier.

5071
05:18:01,410 --> 05:18:03,610
There's literally an Ana in our spawn.

5072
05:18:03,810 --> 05:18:05,370
Like, what?

5073
05:18:06,310 --> 05:18:08,090
Is there Ana still alive back there?

5074
05:18:08,330 --> 05:18:09,810
Where the fuck did the Ana go?

5075
05:18:14,480 --> 05:18:18,140
I'm, like, a bit scared about where the Ana is.

5076
05:18:20,060 --> 05:18:20,580
Like...

5077
05:18:20,580 --> 05:18:21,500
Like...

5078
05:18:22,860 --> 05:18:23,380
Like...

5079
05:18:26,000 --> 05:18:27,120
Wait, oh!

5080
05:18:27,660 --> 05:18:29,260
I'm defending Reds.

5081
05:18:29,400 --> 05:18:30,440
Wait, Ana's behind!

5082
05:18:31,720 --> 05:18:33,460
There's an Ana still back there?

5083
05:18:34,860 --> 05:18:40,870
Did we get the Ana?

5084
05:18:44,520 --> 05:18:46,200
Is the Ana still there?

5085
05:18:46,580 --> 05:18:47,100
I'm stuck.

5086
05:18:49,660 --> 05:18:51,400
Bro, is the Ana still...

5087
05:18:53,040 --> 05:18:55,600
Bro, the Ana still's there!

5088
05:18:57,120 --> 05:18:58,940
Bro, get the fuck away!

5089
05:19:03,450 --> 05:19:04,450
I...

5090
05:19:04,450 --> 05:19:04,890
Leave!

5091
05:19:07,810 --> 05:19:10,450
Leave Rachel's throwing...

5092
05:19:12,550 --> 05:19:13,290
Like...

5093
05:19:13,290 --> 05:19:15,690
They had to still...

5094
05:19:17,010 --> 05:19:18,270
Guys, I won.

5095
05:19:20,210 --> 05:19:21,630
I fucking knew it, guys.

5096
05:19:22,250 --> 05:19:22,590
Guys.

5097
05:19:22,970 --> 05:19:24,510
That's all it took, guys.

5098
05:19:25,530 --> 05:19:26,870
Expect... Alright, guys.

5099
05:19:26,950 --> 05:19:27,510
It's alright.

5100
05:19:28,490 --> 05:19:29,230
It's...

5101
05:19:32,170 --> 05:19:32,910
It's...

5102
05:19:32,910 --> 05:19:35,310
Oh shit, what practice range?

5103
05:19:35,690 --> 05:19:37,470
I don't mean practice range!

5104
05:19:39,130 --> 05:19:41,690
I mean, it's three minutes, it's five, it's three minutes.

5105
05:19:42,470 --> 05:19:43,290
Oh my god.

5106
05:19:43,910 --> 05:19:47,230
Alright, we're gonna chill for three minutes, guys.

5107
05:19:47,350 --> 05:19:48,070
A little reset.

5108
05:19:48,730 --> 05:19:49,330
This is it.

5109
05:19:49,770 --> 05:19:53,330
On the sixth hour, we're gonna get our masters here.

5110
05:19:54,030 --> 05:19:55,010
On the sixth hour.

5111
05:19:55,210 --> 05:19:55,790
Six hour.

5112
05:19:56,930 --> 05:19:58,790
Yeah, she got...

5113
05:19:58,790 --> 05:20:01,110
The enemy Ryan could not fucking heal.

5114
05:20:02,650 --> 05:20:02,890
Okay.

5115
05:20:02,910 --> 05:20:07,130
The enemy ran got fucked over because he didn't have an
honor with him.

5116
05:20:07,450 --> 05:20:07,830
All right.

5117
05:20:08,130 --> 05:20:08,730
It's fine.

5118
05:20:09,550 --> 05:20:10,270
It's fine.

5119
05:20:10,770 --> 05:20:11,370
Guys.

5120
05:20:12,770 --> 05:20:13,610
We'll be okay.

5121
05:20:14,550 --> 05:20:15,790
This is the win streak.

5122
05:20:17,430 --> 05:20:20,250
The rank up strongest bar hasn't gone up.

5123
05:20:21,070 --> 05:20:21,470
Guys.

5124
05:20:21,790 --> 05:20:21,990
Guys.

5125
05:20:22,530 --> 05:20:23,850
It was a visual bug.

5126
05:20:24,390 --> 05:20:24,670
Guys.

5127
05:20:25,370 --> 05:20:26,290
A visual bug.

5128
05:20:26,330 --> 05:20:30,390
You might think that the rank up bar has not gone up at all.

5129
05:20:30,850 --> 05:20:32,330
Like, not even once.

5130
05:20:32,910 --> 05:20:42,710
last five and a half hours but it was merely just a visual
bug and this is where it all changes this is exactly where

5131
05:20:42,710 --> 05:20:51,550
everything changes here like look at that if i can hit those
headies right here as cassidy's i can hit those headies on

Thank you Keep it up dokey the marathon the win street
begins with when the better team's going to bed!

5140
05:21:35,790 --> 05:21:37,410
I am the better team!

5141
05:21:38,090 --> 05:21:39,690
I'm the better healer!

5142
05:21:40,050 --> 05:21:40,850
I swear!

5143
05:21:42,370 --> 05:21:44,390
I'm the better healer!

5144
05:21:44,810 --> 05:21:45,950
It's just not me!

5145
05:21:46,070 --> 05:21:46,910
It's not me!

5146
05:21:47,670 --> 05:21:49,390
Guys, it's absolutely not me.

5147
05:21:49,590 --> 05:21:52,470
Look at those headshots I'm taking against bots!

5148
05:21:53,350 --> 05:21:53,970
Look at that!

5149
05:21:54,770 --> 05:21:55,710
Look at these flicks!

5150
05:21:56,710 --> 05:21:57,350
Boom, boom!

5151
05:21:57,670 --> 05:21:58,530
Flick, flick, flick.

5152
05:21:59,390 --> 05:21:59,950
Come on.

5153
05:22:00,510 --> 05:22:01,290
Look at that.

5154
05:22:01,350 --> 05:22:02,890
And then...

5155
05:22:02,890 --> 05:22:05,790
Come on, get an Anakin that can do that.

5156
05:22:07,250 --> 05:22:07,770
Go, Vio.

5157
05:22:09,190 --> 05:22:10,970
Like, are you trying to say these flicks?

5158
05:22:13,430 --> 05:22:15,630
These flicks are causing me to lose?

5159
05:22:17,810 --> 05:22:21,970
It's just unfortunate that every time I lose, I get a bad
player on my team.

5160
05:22:23,890 --> 05:22:26,310
What does each game have in common?

5161
05:22:27,150 --> 05:22:27,730
Not me.

5162
05:22:28,450 --> 05:22:30,270
I play different healers.

5163
05:22:31,370 --> 05:22:32,870
Because I can flex.

5164
05:22:34,850 --> 05:22:35,890
Like, look at that.

5165
05:22:36,090 --> 05:22:37,670
I haven't missed a single shot.

5166
05:22:39,490 --> 05:22:39,850
There we go.

5167
05:22:40,430 --> 05:22:41,150
I think as we're ready.

5168
05:22:43,210 --> 05:22:43,670
This is it.

5169
05:22:44,230 --> 05:22:45,070
There's no way.

5170
05:22:46,390 --> 05:22:47,490
Guys, there's no way.

5171
05:22:52,730 --> 05:22:55,030
This will 100% carry over.

5172
05:22:58,390 --> 05:23:00,690
100% this will carry over.

5173
05:23:02,070 --> 05:23:02,610
What?

5174
05:23:03,190 --> 05:23:09,650
I know the issue we just need a third player to play DPS so
we have all roles accounted for

5175
05:23:14,190 --> 05:23:26,570
all I'm saying if we have a third player we will have a DPS
player that we can count on and then I have a tank player

5176
05:23:26,570 --> 05:23:29,970
that I can count on and then there's me I can count on
myself

5177
05:23:33,850 --> 05:23:36,950
I can't count on myself, you know?

5178
05:23:38,730 --> 05:23:41,290
Boy, thank you for thanks.

5179
05:23:46,710 --> 05:23:46,830
300!

5180
05:23:46,830 --> 05:23:47,250
This is it.

5181
05:23:49,410 --> 05:23:50,890
We can do this, guys.

5182
05:23:51,150 --> 05:23:53,010
You have it private for friends too?

5183
05:23:53,910 --> 05:23:54,770
Yes, sure.

5184
05:23:55,030 --> 05:23:59,970
I don't think...

5185
05:23:59,970 --> 05:24:01,230
I don't think I'm in range.

5186
05:24:05,610 --> 05:24:17,970
it'll be different it'll be different we need guys i just
think we need a dps player to make this to make it work i

5187
05:24:17,970 --> 05:24:30,470
think that's why so funny oh my god that's hilarious i think
that is why we haven't succeeded it has to be it like what

5188
05:24:30,470 --> 05:24:35,210
jesus christ That was kind of a...

5189
05:24:35,210 --> 05:24:35,650
No!

5190
05:24:36,030 --> 05:24:36,830
The goal character!

5191
05:24:38,390 --> 05:24:39,490
Kill that guy!

5192
05:24:39,970 --> 05:24:41,070
What the fuck?

5193
05:24:41,370 --> 05:24:41,610
Okay.

5194
05:24:42,850 --> 05:24:43,330
Ow.

5195
05:24:44,390 --> 05:24:45,270
I got a little ambitious.

5196
05:24:45,550 --> 05:24:45,690
Okay.

5197
05:24:46,090 --> 05:24:46,310
The res.

5198
05:24:46,470 --> 05:24:47,510
They got the res off.

5199
05:24:49,150 --> 05:24:50,990
Bro, Sherman's been playing Overwatch every fucking day.

5200
05:24:51,170 --> 05:24:51,850
Beaver left us.

5201
05:24:52,810 --> 05:24:54,150
That is so fucked up.

5202
05:24:54,290 --> 05:24:55,170
How could he...

5203
05:24:55,170 --> 05:24:55,170
He's touching grass.

5204
05:24:55,310 --> 05:24:55,970
How could he?

5205
05:24:56,490 --> 05:24:56,970
Why?

5206
05:24:57,630 --> 05:24:58,070
Ew.

5207
05:24:58,350 --> 05:25:00,790
I've been playing six hours of Overwatch touching grass.

5208
05:25:00,870 --> 05:25:01,810
What the fuck is that?

5209
05:25:04,730 --> 05:25:07,090
Can't be any other reason.

5210
05:25:07,290 --> 05:25:07,310
Nope.

5211
05:25:08,770 --> 05:25:11,710
Oh, that was an insane hook.

5212
05:25:12,250 --> 05:25:12,630
Holy shit.

5213
05:25:12,870 --> 05:25:13,330
No sleep dart.

5214
05:25:13,590 --> 05:25:13,950
I'm not.

5215
05:25:14,190 --> 05:25:15,070
That hook was insane.

5216
05:25:15,450 --> 05:25:16,910
In my video game.

5217
05:25:19,210 --> 05:25:20,030
You see those shots?

5218
05:25:21,110 --> 05:25:21,670

05:40:07,440 --> 05:40:08,320
They're reasons.

5424
05:40:09,000 --> 05:40:09,640
Oh no.

5425
05:40:10,060 --> 05:40:11,300

Alright, here you go.

Yeah, it's everyone's butt, but me.

05:40:19,700 --> 05:40:20,540
Because I'm perfect.

5430
05:40:20,560 --> 05:40:22,620
I probably get like a restraining order on you.

5431
05:40:22,640 --> 05:40:23,460
I'm fucking perfect.

5432
05:40:26,100 --> 05:40:28,660
I make the enemy team feel nothing but fear.

5433
05:40:29,220 --> 05:40:30,480
Alright, oh shit.

5434
05:40:30,700 --> 05:40:31,900
Oh, whoa.

5435
05:40:35,080 --> 05:40:37,920
I don't feel so good.

5436
05:40:38,460 --> 05:40:39,560
Wait, what the fuck?

5437
05:40:39,780 --> 05:40:40,460
Bro, what are you doing?

5438
05:40:41,140 --> 05:40:43,320
I was getting a little creative.

5439
05:40:45,360 --> 05:40:46,360
Why is she alive?

5440
05:40:47,260 --> 05:40:48,340
Yo, keep me up.

5441
05:40:48,760 --> 05:40:49,200
I live.

5442
05:40:50,460 --> 05:40:51,000
Does she?

5443
05:40:51,320 --> 05:40:52,700
Yo, she did not live.

5444
05:40:53,480 --> 05:40:55,360
Oh my god.

5445
05:40:56,980 --> 05:40:58,740
We, that was not living.

5446
05:40:58,900 --> 05:41:00,980
I think that was the opposite of living.

5447
05:41:01,280 --> 05:41:02,000
Dude, that monkey was one.

5448
05:41:04,000 --> 05:41:04,480
Definitely.

5449
05:41:06,500 --> 05:41:07,080
Oh, okay.

5450
05:41:08,000 --> 05:41:09,660

5451
05:41:12,820 --> 05:41:13,300
What?

5452
05:41:15,740 --> 05:41:19,420
Okay, that was like the most bullshit shot I've ever seen.

5453
05:41:20,140 --> 05:41:20,940
Holy shit.

5454
05:41:22,840 --> 05:41:23,980
Look, I didn't start.

5455
05:41:24,600 --> 05:41:25,420
I didn't start.

5456
05:41:25,500 --> 05:41:27,860
I was not the first one to die, so it was not me.

5457
05:41:28,760 --> 05:41:29,560
That's all I'm saying.

5458
05:41:30,300 --> 05:41:33,200
I might swap Ana later after I get all of it.

5459
05:41:34,880 --> 05:41:35,960
Yeah, definitely.

5460
05:41:36,240 --> 05:41:38,000
Actually, I can suppose Zenyatta, actually.

5461
05:41:38,220 --> 05:41:39,840
I feel like Zenyatta would be perfect.

5462
05:41:41,220 --> 05:41:42,500
So we can burn the monkey.

5463
05:41:43,580 --> 05:41:45,060
All of them are under right now.

5464
05:41:46,340 --> 05:41:47,140
Wait, I have all...

5465
05:41:47,140 --> 05:41:48,440

Whoa!

5467
05:41:49,600 --> 05:41:51,440
No, it's just a stage name.

5468
05:41:52,620 --> 05:41:55,040

While I was hooking, I went from a lot of HP to not a lot of
HP.

5560
05:49:28,210 --> 05:49:28,650
That's crazy.

5561
05:49:28,970 --> 05:49:29,850
Yeah, that was scary.

5562
05:49:30,530 --> 05:49:31,810
You won't know I'm here, right?

5563
05:49:31,990 --> 05:49:33,910
Okay, I got 16 damage on the board.

5564
05:49:36,370 --> 05:49:37,050
See, they didn't know.

5565
05:49:38,110 --> 05:49:38,590
Oh!

5566
05:49:39,010 --> 05:49:39,630
They did it!

5567
05:49:39,630 --> 05:49:39,950
Wow!

5568
05:49:41,190 --> 05:49:41,670
No!

5569
05:49:42,010 --> 05:49:42,610
So many friends!

5570
05:49:43,090 --> 05:49:44,610
Harassing our...

5571
05:49:44,610 --> 05:49:45,670
This is targeted!

5572
05:49:46,050 --> 05:49:46,910
I'll avenge you.

5573
05:49:48,690 --> 05:49:48,930
No.

5574
05:49:49,690 --> 05:49:50,730
Wait, they just used turret.

5575
05:49:50,890 --> 05:49:51,510
This is fine.

5576
05:49:52,610 --> 05:49:53,590
We got the Zario.

5577
05:49:53,750 --> 05:49:54,750
We can still engage and win.

5578
05:49:55,610 --> 05:49:56,910
Yeah, we got the Zario.

5579
05:49:58,590 --> 05:49:58,910
Alright.

5580
05:49:59,910 --> 05:50:00,170
Nice.

5581
05:50:00,310 --> 05:50:00,850
We did it.

5582
05:50:01,950 --> 05:50:02,510
Good trade.

5583
05:50:10,230 --> 05:50:11,030
Oh my god.

5584
05:50:11,370 --> 05:50:11,750
No bugs.

5585
05:50:15,370 --> 05:50:16,590
I can't see anything.

5586
05:50:16,730 --> 05:50:16,810
I can't see anything.

5587
05:50:16,810 --> 05:50:18,090
I can't see anything, but I think I'm shooting them
correctly.

5588
05:50:19,030 --> 05:50:19,710
Oh, I am!

5589
05:50:20,450 --> 05:50:20,750
No.

5590
05:50:20,950 --> 05:50:21,670
He looks rocked.

5591
05:50:21,750 --> 05:50:22,190
Oh, fuck.

5592
05:50:22,550 --> 05:50:24,630
Okay, I might have given them, like, 200 energy.

5593
05:50:25,170 --> 05:50:25,710
That's okay.

5594
05:50:28,270 --> 05:50:30,450
Oh, I got baited!

5595
05:50:36,890 --> 05:50:38,490
Guys, get rid of the Zarya, please.

5596
05:50:38,710 --> 05:50:40,350
For the love of God, get rid of the Zarya.

5597
05:50:43,290 --> 05:50:43,710
Oh, no.

5598
05:50:43,890 --> 05:50:44,670
Ruben's so dead.

5599
05:50:45,890 --> 05:50:46,630
He's so dead.

5600
05:50:46,750 --> 05:50:48,090
Okay, I gotta stop face-taking.

5601
05:50:50,730 --> 05:50:52,730
Oh, our Ana's so fucking good.

5602
05:50:52,730 --> 05:50:54,050
Oh, okay.

5603
05:50:54,050 --> 05:50:54,990
Okay.

5604
05:50:56,050 --> 05:50:56,910
Holy shit.

5605
05:50:57,370 --> 05:50:58,470
This is it.

5606
05:50:59,410 --> 05:51:03,650
That is genuinely massive as it was closing too.

5607
05:51:05,570 --> 05:51:05,670
Over here.

5608
05:51:06,570 --> 05:51:07,750
Holy fuck.

5609
05:51:07,950 --> 05:51:08,110
All right.

5610
05:51:09,970 --> 05:51:12,470
Oh no, the fucking truck fuck me over.

5611
05:51:13,010 --> 05:51:13,770
I'm so mad.

5612
05:51:14,130 --> 05:51:15,070
No, he's so low.

5613
05:51:15,670 --> 05:51:15,970
No!

5614
05:51:16,550 --> 05:51:17,650
That's not good.

5615
05:51:18,710 --> 05:51:20,150
It's really not good.

5616
05:51:20,390 --> 05:51:20,550
Bro.

5617
05:51:20,990 --> 05:51:21,690
Please.

05:51:21,890 --> 05:51:22,570
Please.

5619
05:51:24,050 --> 05:51:27,910
Please stop targeting me, I'm just a poison yada!

5620
05:51:28,090 --> 05:51:29,370
And they raised their guy.

5621
05:51:29,570 --> 05:51:30,770
I'm just...

5622
05:51:30,770 --> 05:51:32,970
I'm just a poison yada!

5623
05:51:34,090 --> 05:51:34,650
Stop!

5624
05:51:35,610 --> 05:51:37,150

5629
05:51:42,290 --> 05:51:43,590
I have no legs.

5630
05:51:44,610 --> 05:51:45,950

What kind of question is that?

5658
05:53:40,070 --> 05:53:40,470
We're fine.

5659
05:53:40,910 --> 05:53:41,750
It's like basketball.

05:54:06,250 --> 05:54:08,010

05:54:08,230 --> 05:54:08,650

05:54:08,790 --> 05:54:10,310

5675
05:54:13,570 --> 05:54:15,430

05:54:15,890 --> 05:54:16,070

5678
05:54:19,530 --> 05:54:20,370
One bubble.

5679
05:54:21,170 --> 05:54:23,470
Jesus Christ, leave me the fuck alone.

5682
05:54:40,730 --> 05:54:41,070
What?

5683
05:54:45,370 --> 05:54:49,250
Oh, he saw my little foot But why would he go there?

5684
05:54:49,990 --> 05:54:51,850
Why the fuck would he go there?

5685
05:54:54,070 --> 05:54:55,390
I told you I knew it.

5686
05:54:55,530 --> 05:54:56,310
I knew I was getting targeted.

5687
05:54:56,910 --> 05:54:57,750
I knew it.

5688
05:54:57,810 --> 05:55:01,990
There was no other reason like existing man I fucking knew
it.

5689
05:55:02,110 --> 05:55:04,390
Nobody believed me when I said I got targeted

5690
05:55:08,030 --> 05:55:10,030
There's literally no other explanation

5691
05:55:13,790 --> 05:55:16,570
There's no other explanation guys

5692
05:55:20,410 --> 05:55:21,610
How else

5693
05:55:25,730 --> 05:55:27,690
How else?

5694
05:55:30,930 --> 05:55:31,090
Yay!

5695
05:55:36,510 --> 05:55:37,690

5696
05:55:41,350 --> 05:55:42,470
I believe.

5697
05:55:46,820 --> 05:55:48,730
Start believing guys.

5698
05:55:49,070 --> 05:55:50,450
You gotta keep on believing.

5699

5701
05:56:25,680 --> 05:56:28,060
Kiriko win rate Like, at least 50.

5702
05:56:29,540 --> 05:56:34,320
To be fair, you can get a negative win rate and be top 500
now, apparently.

5703
05:56:37,380 --> 05:56:38,920
Please, Doki, I want to go to sleep.

5704
05:56:45,600 --> 05:56:46,000
Sleep?

5705
05:56:49,740 --> 05:56:51,560

5711
05:57:36,520 --> 05:57:37,780
That was a hit.

5712
05:57:38,440 --> 05:57:39,340
It was a visual bug.

5713
05:57:40,840 --> 05:57:43,980
It's crazy that we're experiencing all kinds of visual bugs
right now.

5714
05:57:44,820 --> 05:57:47,480
It's absolutely... How unlucky are we?

5715
05:57:51,380 --> 05:57:57,860
Like, wow, all these visual bugs are things that hit but
didn't show up.

5716
05:58:00,260 --> 05:58:02,100
Like, holy shit.

5717
05:58:03,080 --> 05:58:03,840
How is this possible?

5718
05:58:08,380 --> 05:58:10,060

05:58:17,660 --> 05:58:19,060
Holy shit.

5721
05:58:21,380 --> 05:58:27,400
We need to call an exterminator with all these bugs you're
encountering, Togi.

5722
05:58:29,320 --> 05:58:37,380

It's not Dokium anymore if I'm winning.

5728
05:59:13,350 --> 05:59:14,450
It's reality.

5729
05:59:19,090 --> 05:59:20,890
I wonder if they'll expect me to do it.

5730
05:59:21,470 --> 05:59:23,370
Let the Kitsune guide you.

5731
05:59:25,210 --> 05:59:26,090
What do we have to win?

5732
05:59:26,650 --> 05:59:27,270
There you go.

5733
05:59:27,850 --> 05:59:28,570
Whoa!

5734
05:59:30,570 --> 05:59:34,400

05:59:46,280 --> 05:59:48,420
Reality is often disappointing.

5740
05:59:50,860 --> 05:59:52,080
AP, thank you for the super chat.

5741
05:59:52,220 --> 05:59:52,860
Thank you, thank you.

5742
05:59:52,940 --> 05:59:54,120
Is Owatch a game we're playing?

5743
05:59:54,220 --> 05:59:56,320
If you're not a streamer, gaining income from playing it?

5744
05:59:56,540 --> 05:59:57,280
Thank you for the super chat.

5745
05:59:57,400 --> 05:59:58,040
Thank you, thank you.

5746
05:59:58,500 --> 05:59:58,880
Thank you.

5747
05:59:59,700 --> 06:00:07,140
But like, but don't play too long or you're gonna turn like
out like me with a, where a not addiction and i can quit at

5748
06:00:07,140 --> 06:00:23,680
any time i've got you i can quit at any time they have
fucking sigma bro they have sigma oh shit what is going on

5749
06:00:25,220 --> 06:00:37,240
prove it i can quit whenever i want i can't hunt i can quit
whatever i want i just chose not to quit right now guys i

5750
06:00:37,240 --> 06:00:49,820
can pick and choose it's just right now i chose not to i'm
escaping guys oh no we do a ministerial amount of glory i

5751
06:00:49,820 --> 06:00:50,670
come back on doom

5752
06:00:57,180 --> 06:01:02,800
all right guys i don't actually i'll be back in time i don't
what

5753
06:01:06,140 --> 06:01:07,180
I knew it.

5754
06:01:07,480 --> 06:01:07,760
Fucking math.

5755
06:01:08,100 --> 06:01:08,840
Math should be banished.

5756
06:01:09,680 --> 06:01:10,140
Fuck math.

5757
06:01:12,220 --> 06:01:13,680
This is why math is terrible.

5758
06:01:13,940 --> 06:01:15,660
We should get rid of math so we can have that.

5759
06:01:16,080 --> 06:01:17,860
If we get rid of math, we won't have physics.

5760
06:01:18,040 --> 06:01:19,460
If we get rid of physics, we won't have gravity.

5761
06:01:21,360 --> 06:01:21,660
Life does not need gravity.

5762
06:01:21,660 --> 06:01:23,060
We just want to make this game a little bit longer.

5763
06:01:23,680 --> 06:01:24,780
Life does not need gravity.

5764
06:01:25,520 --> 06:01:26,900
I rather we float out from the...

5765
06:01:26,900 --> 06:01:30,400
I float on Earth and then into space.

5766
06:01:30,600 --> 06:01:31,680
So then we can go to space.

5767
06:01:33,920 --> 06:01:34,480
Oh my god.

5768
06:01:35,920 --> 06:01:38,680
My fingers felt weird there.

5769
06:01:41,620 --> 06:01:42,380
See?

5770
06:01:42,620 --> 06:01:43,140
Not me.

5771
06:01:43,520 --> 06:01:45,040
Poor guy.

5772
06:01:49,570 --> 06:01:50,330
Fine.

5773
06:01:50,670 --> 06:01:51,490
I saved the Ana.

5774
06:01:51,830 --> 06:01:52,230
We're fine.

5775
06:01:53,890 --> 06:01:54,810
Did my job.

5776
06:01:59,130 --> 06:02:01,030
What the fuck?

5777
06:02:01,890 --> 06:02:02,650
Whoa!

5778
06:02:05,750 --> 06:02:07,170
I'll save you from mass!

5779
06:02:08,730 --> 06:02:09,110
Christ.

5780
06:02:10,130 --> 06:02:12,530
She just missed.

5781
06:02:13,890 --> 06:02:14,530
Five.

5782
06:02:15,210 --> 06:02:15,590
We're five.

5783
06:02:16,130 --> 06:02:16,490
We're five.

5784
06:02:16,730 --> 06:02:16,810
We're five.

5785
06:02:16,810 --> 06:02:17,770
We're so five.

5786
06:02:18,930 --> 06:02:19,710
We're so five.

5787
06:02:19,950 --> 06:02:22,350
Please get one kill.

5788
06:02:23,450 --> 06:02:24,090
What?

5789
06:02:24,990 --> 06:02:26,490
Oh, no.

5790
06:02:26,490 --> 06:02:26,650
She was so low.

5791
06:02:26,650 --> 06:02:26,870
She's one.

5792
06:02:28,170 --> 06:02:29,270
Oh, no.

5793
06:02:30,130 --> 06:02:31,070
He was so low.

5794
06:02:31,890 --> 06:02:32,190
Thank you.

5795
06:02:32,510 --> 06:02:35,690
Feedback, acknowledge I'll choose algorithm over.

5796
06:02:35,810 --> 06:02:36,530
Oh, right.

5797
06:02:36,710 --> 06:02:37,650
Thank you.

5798
06:02:37,710 --> 06:02:38,190
Guys.

5799
06:02:38,190 --> 06:02:39,390
Keep an eye out.

5800
06:02:39,870 --> 06:02:40,590
C9!

5801
06:02:41,170 --> 06:02:41,630
C9!

5802
06:02:43,350 --> 06:02:43,710
No!

5803
06:02:45,430 --> 06:02:46,110
No!

5804
06:02:46,770 --> 06:02:47,750
Thank God!

5805
06:02:51,190 --> 06:02:51,910
Bro!

5806
06:02:53,430 --> 06:02:54,390
Holy shit!

5807
06:02:54,830 --> 06:02:58,930
That doesn't matter.

5808
06:02:59,450 --> 06:03:00,430
That provides them with nothing.

5809
06:03:01,450 --> 06:03:05,170
We don't get an extra fight on it.

5810
06:03:06,070 --> 06:03:07,290
Oh my god.

5811
06:03:07,290 --> 06:03:07,690
That doesn't matter.

5812
06:03:10,040 --> 06:03:10,620
I can quit.

5813
06:03:11,900 --> 06:03:13,020
I can quit.

5814
06:03:13,940 --> 06:03:14,920
Where is he?

5815
06:03:15,080 --> 06:03:16,680
No, I lost him!

5816
06:03:16,740 --> 06:03:18,620
Sorry, I missed all my shots.

5817
06:03:19,020 --> 06:03:20,100
Oh my god!

5818
06:03:20,740 --> 06:03:25,600
He fucking floated around like a fucking butterfly.

5819
06:03:29,580 --> 06:03:29,680
Okay.

5820
06:03:29,680 --> 06:03:31,940
I couldn't see where he was.

5821
06:03:33,060 --> 06:03:36,380
See, look, us kill us, letting them see nine that four.

5822
06:03:37,440 --> 06:03:39,060
Made it so that the rest of the team is staggering.

5823
06:03:40,240 --> 06:03:40,800
Easy.

5824
06:03:41,280 --> 06:03:43,180
That was so fucking easy.

5825
06:03:43,280 --> 06:03:46,040
Oh no.

5826
06:03:47,500 --> 06:03:48,000
Where is she?

5827
06:03:50,400 --> 06:03:51,560
Okay, we got it.

5828
06:03:52,520 --> 06:03:52,980
We got it.

5829
06:03:54,060 --> 06:03:56,420
I might be slowly losing HP, but we got it.

5830
06:03:57,180 --> 06:03:57,180
Oh!

5831
06:03:57,400 --> 06:03:59,100
And another win!

5832
06:03:59,780 --> 06:04:03,100
Long as win streak an Overwatch 2 player has ever got 4.

5833
06:04:04,000 --> 06:04:04,900
It adds up.

5834
06:04:05,260 --> 06:04:07,260
It keeps adding up.

5835
06:04:07,760 --> 06:04:10,020
I have more healing than her healing.

5836
06:04:10,040 --> 06:04:12,520
It keeps adding up, guys.

5837
06:04:12,920 --> 06:04:13,740
Wait, what?

5838
06:04:14,160 --> 06:04:15,860
Holy shit, that's so sad.

5839
06:04:16,920 --> 06:04:18,040
Yeah, it's pretty easy to get.

5840
06:04:18,680 --> 06:04:20,900
High healing whenever you're playing Roadhog running down.

5841
06:04:22,000 --> 06:04:23,220
Oh my god.

5842
06:04:24,220 --> 06:04:24,580
There's me.

5843
06:04:24,580 --> 06:04:24,960
There's me.

5844
06:04:25,000 --> 06:04:25,580
Did you see me?

5845
06:04:26,080 --> 06:04:26,820
I was right there.

5846
06:04:27,540 --> 06:04:28,360
You see me there?

5847
06:04:28,740 --> 06:04:30,460
Guys, guys, we just...

5848
06:04:30,460 --> 06:04:32,260
Guys, guys, guys.

5849
06:04:32,780 --> 06:04:33,340
Remember...

5850
06:04:33,340 --> 06:04:34,760
We started from the bottom.

5851
06:04:35,960 --> 06:04:36,480
Guys.

5852
06:04:40,140 --> 06:04:42,560
We started from the bottom!

5853
06:04:44,100 --> 06:04:46,040
who you were!

5854
06:04:50,680 --> 06:04:53,680
Remember where you came from.

5855
06:04:57,540 --> 06:04:58,260
Alright.

5856
06:04:58,920 --> 06:04:59,400
Let's see.

5857
06:04:59,640 --> 06:05:00,260
What do we do?

5858
06:05:02,720 --> 06:05:04,300
This is my origin story.

5859
06:05:06,080 --> 06:05:06,400
Okay.

5860
06:05:08,040 --> 06:05:08,560
This is it.

5861
06:05:09,680 --> 06:05:10,020
You know what?

5862
06:05:10,040 --> 06:05:21,340
what no this is where we prove all the haters wrong this is
where we pay all we prove all the haters wrong bite size

5863
06:05:21,340 --> 06:05:30,040
thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you here's the
insurance for hopefully the last game i believe in donkey

5864
06:05:30,040 --> 06:05:40,700
thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you don't get over
no this is it I prove all the haters wrong I might have a

5865
06:05:40,700 --> 06:05:54,120
negative win rate on Kiriko but this is where I make it
positive wait actually like how how fucked am I this is

5866
06:05:54,120 --> 06:05:59,640
where we're gonna make a 35% win rate this is it

5867
06:06:04,980 --> 06:06:07,180
Oh my god, have confidence.

5868
06:06:08,480 --> 06:06:10,000
Have the confidence.

5869
06:06:10,820 --> 06:06:11,780
They're on Maga.

5870
06:06:12,280 --> 06:06:12,640
Kill me.

5871
06:06:15,180 --> 06:06:16,400
I get free relevant.

5872
06:06:16,700 --> 06:06:16,920
It's fine.

5873
06:06:19,540 --> 06:06:20,200
This is it.

5874
06:06:21,560 --> 06:06:24,100
Okay, I actually might have to go Zenyara because they have
mine.

5875
06:06:25,480 --> 06:06:28,060
100% confidence right here.

5876
06:06:29,080 --> 06:06:30,400
You've got to have the confidence.

5877
06:06:31,420 --> 06:06:33,280
Oh my god, he was so low.

5878
06:06:34,740 --> 06:06:39,760
Okay, I wanted to die there so I can play this character.

5879
06:06:40,640 --> 06:06:41,180
No TP.

5880
06:06:41,520 --> 06:06:43,600
Guys, there's a reason why I died.

5881
06:06:43,840 --> 06:06:45,220
I wanted to play Zenyata.

5882
06:06:46,320 --> 06:06:50,380
Guys, this was the strategic swap here.

5883
06:06:51,140 --> 06:06:54,000
I had to die so I could do this.

5884
06:06:54,220 --> 06:06:54,420
Big kill.

5885
06:06:59,270 --> 06:07:01,410
So I could do this, guys.

5886
06:07:02,970 --> 06:07:04,630
It was all strategic.

5887
06:07:07,410 --> 06:07:09,650
Oh my god, he's so low though.

5888
06:07:09,970 --> 06:07:11,550
He's so low though.

5889
06:07:13,930 --> 06:07:15,270
Someone please!

5890
06:07:15,710 --> 06:07:17,690
Oh that's really not good.

5891
06:07:18,370 --> 06:07:19,810
Oh that's not good for us.

5892
06:07:20,850 --> 06:07:23,410
Oh my god!

5893
06:07:27,670 --> 06:07:29,870
Oh my god!

5894
06:07:29,890 --> 06:07:31,130
There was...

5895
06:07:31,130 --> 06:07:33,010
I immediately die anyway?

5896
06:07:34,450 --> 06:07:34,830
Woo!

5897
06:07:35,810 --> 06:07:37,050
This is it.

5898
06:07:37,410 --> 06:07:37,810
It's fine.

5899
06:07:37,890 --> 06:07:38,910
I got the maga, guys.

5900
06:07:39,870 --> 06:07:40,170
It's fine.

5901
06:07:40,270 --> 06:07:41,010
I got the maga.

5902
06:07:43,050 --> 06:07:44,430
Guys, I got the maga.

5903
06:07:44,530 --> 06:07:44,970
It's fine.

5904
06:07:45,250 --> 06:07:46,430
I got my one.

5905
06:07:47,430 --> 06:07:48,390
Oh, my God.

5906
06:07:48,490 --> 06:07:49,170
That was scary, though.

5907
06:07:49,810 --> 06:07:50,390
He has walls.

5908
06:07:51,110 --> 06:07:52,770
There's no way he knows I'm down here.

5909
06:07:53,370 --> 06:07:54,990
We already have Link Trents.

5910
06:07:55,090 --> 06:07:55,370
Winnebill.

5911
06:07:55,970 --> 06:07:57,070
We don't need him.

5912
06:08:00,010 --> 06:08:01,030
We don't need her.

5913
06:08:02,210 --> 06:08:03,050
We need me, though.

5914
06:08:08,990 --> 06:08:10,870
Guys, I'm just gonna slowly walk over to her.

5915

Okay, guys.

5919
06:08:47,570 --> 06:08:49,830
Guys, it's not because I went...

5920
06:08:49,830 --> 06:08:51,230
Guys, I think...

5921
06:08:51,230 --> 06:08:52,950
I think...

5922
06:08:52,950 --> 06:08:54,890
Guys, I think me going...

5923
06:08:55,590 --> 06:08:56,850
Oh my god.

5924
06:08:57,010 --> 06:08:58,850
I think me going Kirko cursed the game.

5925
06:08:59,450 --> 06:09:00,910
I think it cursed the game, guys.

5926
06:09:01,850 --> 06:09:03,910
I think it cursed...

5927
06:09:03,910 --> 06:09:05,490
I think it cursed the game.

5928
06:09:09,350 --> 06:09:09,950
Okay.

5929
06:09:11,130 --> 06:09:13,890
As long as I...

5930
06:09:16,590 --> 06:09:17,990
Guys, I'm scared.

5931
06:09:18,990 --> 06:09:19,570
I'm stuck.

5932
06:09:20,790 --> 06:09:21,930
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

5933
06:09:24,030 --> 06:09:24,550
Nice.

5934
06:09:25,650 --> 06:09:26,230
We're...

5935
06:09:26,230 --> 06:09:27,410
Alright, we're gonna do this.

5936
06:09:29,090 --> 06:09:29,950
We go in.

5937
06:09:30,230 --> 06:09:30,890
We go in.

5938
06:09:30,890 --> 06:09:31,710
We go in with that.

5939
06:09:32,750 --> 06:09:33,070
Alright.

5940
06:09:33,610 --> 06:09:34,890
If Maga alts, I'm sorry.

5941
06:09:38,070 --> 06:09:40,390
If he alts, I am so sorry.

5942
06:09:41,450 --> 06:09:42,010
Nice.

5943
06:09:44,210 --> 06:09:45,090
I had to.

5944
06:09:45,230 --> 06:09:45,930
I had to.

5945
06:09:46,610 --> 06:09:48,190
My life was so important.

5946
06:09:51,940 --> 06:09:55,760
Guys, I don't know if it's noticeable, but I definitely
don't know how to position a Zenyatta.

5947
06:09:57,000 --> 06:09:58,160
Is it noticeable, guys?

5948
06:09:58,660 --> 06:09:59,880
It's not, right?

5949
06:10:00,780 --> 06:10:01,700
It's not, right?

5950
06:10:01,720 --> 06:10:03,000
I didn't know that anyways.

5951
06:10:08,700 --> 06:10:09,820
Oh, my God.

5952
06:10:12,640 --> 06:10:13,080
Bitch.

5953
06:10:13,320 --> 06:10:14,080
I need backup.

5954
06:10:14,540 --> 06:10:15,180
Good kills.

5955
06:10:18,800 --> 06:10:19,380
Woo!

5956
06:10:23,730 --> 06:10:24,310
Woo!

5957
06:10:24,970 --> 06:10:27,230
There is a Marga coming up to you.

5958
06:10:27,630 --> 06:10:28,130
I'm dead.

5959
06:10:28,250 --> 06:10:28,670
I'm dead.

5960
06:10:29,330 --> 06:10:29,630
I'm dead.

5961
06:10:29,770 --> 06:10:30,130
I'm dead.

5962
06:10:31,510 --> 06:10:33,790
There are so many people there!

5963
06:10:36,450 --> 06:10:38,690
Guys, I don't think that one is.

5964
06:10:39,350 --> 06:10:42,050
Oh my god, he lost the fight?

5965
06:10:43,250 --> 06:10:43,830
What?

5966
06:10:43,830 --> 06:10:44,930
There's the enemy turret!

5967
06:10:46,230 --> 06:10:50,950
Guys, it was a nice- it was a pretty cool win streak though,
not gonna lie.

5968
06:10:55,510 --> 06:10:59,750
I think the win streak was so cool though, I was like...

5969
06:11:00,850 --> 06:11:03,510
Getting that win streak was pretty fucking pog.

5970
06:11:07,290 --> 06:11:09,210
Oh, that's where I lose!

5971
06:11:10,670 --> 06:11:13,630
It was- it was a cool win streak.

5972
06:11:13,830 --> 06:11:17,030
It was nice while it lasted, you know?

5973
06:11:17,890 --> 06:11:23,100
It was nobody thought we nobody thought we had it in it, but
we did

5974
06:11:27,110 --> 06:11:32,120
It was a pretty sick win streak for a while it really was

5975
06:11:35,890 --> 06:11:38,910
Why did I pull the gear go?

5976
06:11:42,980 --> 06:11:47,300
Here we go It's not over yet.

5977
06:11:49,840 --> 06:11:52,140
We pull it right here.

5978
06:11:59,570 --> 06:12:00,830
Well, it was the other team's one.

5979
06:12:00,890 --> 06:12:01,710
It really was.

5980
06:12:02,470 --> 06:12:02,810
Honestly.

5981
06:12:05,190 --> 06:12:06,970
It honestly was.

5982
06:12:11,260 --> 06:12:12,700
I'll find my own.

5983
06:12:12,900 --> 06:12:14,340
I can't believe it.

5984
06:12:14,560 --> 06:12:15,080
Again.

5985
06:12:15,940 --> 06:12:19,500
My team and also the enemy team did this to me.

5986
06:12:20,140 --> 06:12:21,280
As always.

5987
06:12:21,780 --> 06:12:22,660
They always.

5988
06:12:22,740 --> 06:12:32,120
do this to me yep getting some good mileage out of them no
no no this is it this is where everything changes chat

5989
06:12:32,120 --> 06:12:42,820
everything changes right here i think you need to spend
money in the shop so you can boost your gear go win right

5990
06:12:42,820 --> 06:12:48,380
shit you're right i haven't bought anything in this game for
like years that makes so much more sense

5991
06:12:51,590 --> 06:12:56,270
all right It's like, how else would we lose?

5992
06:12:58,970 --> 06:13:00,470
I didn't die though.

5993
06:13:03,850 --> 06:13:06,230
All I'm saying is I did not die.

5994
06:13:06,730 --> 06:13:11,030
To be fair, I think having a Bastion one trick is also sort
of like causing stuff.

5995
06:13:12,730 --> 06:13:14,010
Not gonna lie.

5996
06:13:14,530 --> 06:13:17,350
Having a Bastion one trick is not helping.

5997
06:13:22,570 --> 06:13:24,010
Oh, goodbye Bastion.

5998
06:13:26,490 --> 06:13:27,150
Hello!

5999
06:13:28,570 --> 06:13:29,830
Hello, bastion!

6000
06:13:31,110 --> 06:13:33,010
Don't make me use cleanse!

6001
06:13:34,050 --> 06:13:37,870
Oh, I should have used cleanse instead of looking at my
bastion.

6002
06:13:38,790 --> 06:13:40,790
Guys, I think I figured it out.

6003
06:13:43,390 --> 06:13:46,150
We should absolutely not help our bastion.

6004
06:13:48,590 --> 06:13:49,910
I think...

6005
06:13:49,910 --> 06:13:51,790
I think I figured it out.

6006
06:13:55,150 --> 06:13:58,790
We should help everybody but the bastions.

6007
06:13:59,290 --> 06:13:59,710
Oh, yep.

6008
06:14:00,010 --> 06:14:00,810
It's over.

6009
06:14:01,490 --> 06:14:02,810
It was so cool, though.

6010
06:14:03,390 --> 06:14:07,890
Having the record for the highest win streak in Overwatch
history.

6011
06:14:08,790 --> 06:14:10,130
A swapping four.

6012
06:14:10,550 --> 06:14:11,670
It's so fucking cool.

6013
06:14:11,890 --> 06:14:13,410
I've never experienced that before.

6014
06:14:16,290 --> 06:14:16,310
Okay.

6015
06:14:17,210 --> 06:14:17,590
Here we go.

6016
06:14:18,590 --> 06:14:19,250
Here we go.

6017
06:14:20,810 --> 06:14:21,470
Woo!

6018
06:14:21,790 --> 06:14:23,030
Okay, let's go left side

6019
06:14:28,310 --> 06:14:38,430
I'm okay I'm okay, or TP, so we're gonna kill her All right,
see I told you

6020
06:14:41,710 --> 06:14:54,410
Guys, it's not okay guys, it's not okay Hey guys, please
somebody get rid of the fucking god zone I knew it wasn't

6021
06:14:54,410 --> 06:14:54,930
okay.

6022
06:14:54,930 --> 06:14:58,130
I still have a widow up there, so don't die to her.

6023
06:14:58,810 --> 06:15:00,350
Well, guess who's going to die to her?

6024
06:15:00,630 --> 06:15:04,030
In three, two...

6025
06:15:04,030 --> 06:15:09,710
Oh my god, I don't have an ear anymore.

6026
06:15:10,050 --> 06:15:12,750
I don't...

6027
06:15:14,890 --> 06:15:17,170
Oh, I'm incredibly black.

6028
06:15:17,530 --> 06:15:17,970
Just kidding.

6029
06:15:18,510 --> 06:15:18,750
Oh.

6030
06:15:18,810 --> 06:15:18,950
Oh.

6031
06:15:21,770 --> 06:15:25,900
Which one is ours and which one is I'll never know.

6032
06:15:27,150 --> 06:15:28,070
Oh, goodbye.

6033
06:15:31,470 --> 06:15:31,790
No.

6034
06:15:32,470 --> 06:15:34,750
Now we have to play this game longer?

6035
06:15:35,390 --> 06:15:35,750
And Maga ult?

6036
06:15:36,570 --> 06:15:37,470
And Larry ult?

6037
06:15:39,990 --> 06:15:40,770
What's going on?

6038
06:15:40,830 --> 06:15:41,530
Good question.

6039
06:15:43,510 --> 06:15:44,190
Maga.

6040
06:15:46,730 --> 06:15:48,030
Leave me alone.

6041
06:15:50,430 --> 06:15:51,610
Where is he?

6042
06:15:52,010 --> 06:15:53,010
Where's the Maga?

6043
06:15:57,850 --> 06:16:00,910
He's like up here, but I don't know if I could climb it.

6044
06:16:01,250 --> 06:16:02,150
Don't worry, I got you.

6045
06:16:04,510 --> 06:16:06,450
Wait, somebody's a sleepy...

6046
06:16:06,450 --> 06:16:07,450
Who shot me?

6047
06:16:12,390 --> 06:16:14,350
Did you hit anything, Bastion?

6048
06:16:14,970 --> 06:16:18,210
Judging by you being no one's dying, I assume no.

6049
06:16:19,110 --> 06:16:20,410
Oh my god.

6050
06:16:20,730 --> 06:16:21,710
It's fucking crazy.

6051
06:16:23,010 --> 06:16:23,210
Ah!

6052
06:16:24,030 --> 06:16:24,710

They were not giving up.

06:17:20,390 --> 06:17:22,350
They were absolutely not.

Honestly, I'm okay if we lose this, so then we don't...

I'm okay if we don't cap.

6086
06:18:37,360 --> 06:18:38,680

06:19:57,140 --> 06:19:57,820
Thank you.

6096
06:19:58,240 --> 06:19:58,620
Alright.

6097
06:19:59,140 --> 06:20:03,350
I sort of was not surprised with the outcome of that...

6098
06:20:03,960 --> 06:20:05,140
of that ult.

6099
06:20:05,820 --> 06:20:10,320
For some reason, I was definitely not surprised with what
happened there.

6100
06:20:10,480 --> 06:20:12,540
I will wait for Rush before I...

6101
06:20:13,280 --> 06:20:38,810
have rush before I uh all right here you go this is it I'm
gonna do it oh my shit all right bye okay we both use cage

6102
06:20:38,810 --> 06:20:45,990

6103
06:20:46,410 --> 06:20:47,010
Please!

6104
06:20:48,030 --> 06:20:49,230
He's alive!

6105
06:20:49,730 --> 06:20:50,670
Oh my god, I'm...

6106
06:20:51,130 --> 06:20:51,710
Oh, alive.

6107
06:20:51,850 --> 06:20:52,010
Okay.

6108
06:20:53,070 --> 06:20:57,630
I thought I fell.

6109
06:20:58,330 --> 06:20:59,590
I legitimately thought I fell.

6110
06:21:03,250 --> 06:21:05,190
They're junk and Kiri are bottom left.

6111
06:21:05,350 --> 06:21:05,950
They don't have Suzu.

6112
06:21:07,170 --> 06:21:09,370
Okay, they're not bottom left anymore.

6113
06:21:14,000 --> 06:21:14,600
Okay.

6114
06:21:15,580 --> 06:21:17,240
It's fine, Suzu!

6115
06:21:20,580 --> 06:21:21,620
It's okay?

6116
06:21:21,900 --> 06:21:23,140
It's not okay anymore?

6117
06:21:24,240 --> 06:21:25,380
It's not okay?

6118
06:21:29,650 --> 06:21:32,510
Oh my god, it's winnable!

6119
06:21:33,170 --> 06:21:36,150
Okay, this is okay.

6120
06:21:37,510 --> 06:21:39,470
This is, this is okay.

6121
06:21:40,650 --> 06:21:42,170
This is this is okay.

6122
06:21:42,210 --> 06:21:42,390
Okay.

6123
06:21:52,010 --> 06:21:53,310
This is okay.

6124
06:21:53,950 --> 06:21:55,090
We could keep going.

6125
06:22:05,670 --> 06:22:07,730
It'll be fine.

6126
06:22:08,370 --> 06:22:10,210
It'll be fine.

6127
06:22:10,710 --> 06:22:15,990
I'll find my own path.

6128
06:22:16,510 --> 06:22:17,750
This is okay.

6129
06:22:19,390 --> 06:22:21,350
Dead weight gets left behind.

6130
06:22:21,410 --> 06:22:22,550
Whoa, is that an emote?

6131
06:22:22,750 --> 06:22:23,650
What the fuck?

6132
06:22:24,630 --> 06:22:25,810
It has to be an Emo.

6133
06:22:26,070 --> 06:22:26,330
What?

6134
06:22:27,030 --> 06:22:29,110
This is a long fucking Emo.

6135
06:22:29,590 --> 06:22:31,470
Does it stop when, like, he's done walking?

6136
06:22:32,950 --> 06:22:33,590
Oh, my God.

6137
06:22:33,670 --> 06:22:34,510
Wait, that's pretty sick.

6138
06:22:34,630 --> 06:22:35,610
I didn't know that was an Emo.

6139
06:22:38,490 --> 06:22:39,070
Oh, yeah.

6140
06:22:39,190 --> 06:22:40,630
It keeps going until...

6141
06:22:46,410 --> 06:22:48,150
Now push him to the door.

6142
06:22:53,090 --> 06:22:53,490
Okay.

6143
06:22:53,610 --> 06:22:53,930
Okay.

6144
06:22:53,930 --> 06:22:54,330
Okay.

6145
06:22:54,630 --> 06:22:55,730
Okay, come on.

6146
06:22:56,050 --> 06:22:58,290
It'll be cool if you walk out the door like this.

6147
06:22:58,550 --> 06:22:58,590
No!

6148
06:22:58,930 --> 06:23:00,110
It would have been so cool.

6149
06:23:02,430 --> 06:23:03,670
Okay, not gonna lie.

6150
06:23:03,830 --> 06:23:06,030
It would have been so funny if he got like headshot.

6151
06:23:06,370 --> 06:23:07,770
Oh my god.

6152
06:23:08,070 --> 06:23:08,430
What?

6153
06:23:09,750 --> 06:23:11,410
What happened to his HP?

6154
06:23:13,750 --> 06:23:16,310
Like, actually, what happened to his HP?

6155
06:23:17,210 --> 06:23:19,990
What the fuck happened to his HP?

6156
06:23:20,610 --> 06:23:22,250
Oh, it's because they have a widow.

6157
06:23:24,090 --> 06:23:24,610
Oh!

6158
06:23:28,690 --> 06:23:29,810
That's why...

6159
06:23:29,810 --> 06:23:32,270
Guys, now I'm not so sure anymore.

6160
06:23:33,710 --> 06:23:35,230
Okay, this is okay.

6161
06:23:39,190 --> 06:23:39,750
What?

6162
06:23:40,910 --> 06:23:41,830
Are you serious?

6163
06:23:42,110 --> 06:23:44,030
Oh, this is not okay anymore.

6164
06:23:45,270 --> 06:23:47,330
Guys, there might be...

6165
06:23:47,330 --> 06:23:49,290
I personally think they should remove Maga from the game.

6166
06:23:49,590 --> 06:23:52,570
This might not be as okay as I expected it to be.

6167
06:23:52,930 --> 06:23:54,130
This is awful.

6168
06:23:55,670 --> 06:23:57,060
They use them all.

6169
06:24:00,310 --> 06:24:03,190
It's not as okay because they have a widow.

6170
06:24:05,410 --> 06:24:06,510
Their widow's on fire.

6171
06:24:07,170 --> 06:24:07,810
Oh, no.

6172
06:24:08,610 --> 06:24:09,310
Oh, no.

6173
06:24:09,470 --> 06:24:10,790
It's not okay anymore.

6174
06:24:10,910 --> 06:24:11,790
Where's our Ana?

6175
06:24:12,810 --> 06:24:13,790
Oh, no.

6176
06:24:13,950 --> 06:24:15,630
I have to do this to...

6177
06:24:16,710 --> 06:24:17,990
No, no!

6178
06:24:18,470 --> 06:24:20,050
Where did our Ana go?

6179
06:24:21,690 --> 06:24:23,670
Our Ana was flanking!

6180
06:24:26,430 --> 06:24:31,030
Our Ana was flanking so I had to heal it all by myself.

6181
06:24:36,810 --> 06:24:39,750
Ana, I needed heals help.

6182
06:24:40,590 --> 06:24:42,790
I needed you to help me.

6183
06:24:47,830 --> 06:24:48,390
Ana.

6184
06:24:53,950 --> 06:24:54,630
No.

6185
06:24:56,730 --> 06:24:59,490
Guys, we could have had this match in like 30 minutes ago.

6186
06:24:59,810 --> 06:25:00,530
Not gonna lie.

6187
06:25:01,850 --> 06:25:06,750
This match could have been over so long ago and I went queue
in another game.

6188
06:25:08,630 --> 06:25:11,670
I could have been in another game by now!

6189
06:25:15,990 --> 06:25:17,650
Can't believe your name is Egghouse.

6190
06:25:17,750 --> 06:25:18,450
It's Egghouse.

6191
06:25:20,410 --> 06:25:22,230
It's one shot, one kill.

6192
06:25:22,850 --> 06:25:24,990
It's, it's, what was the other ones?

6193
06:25:25,050 --> 06:25:26,550
I already forgot the other one names.

6194
06:25:26,790 --> 06:25:28,370
Other stream sniper mode names.

6195
06:25:30,670 --> 06:25:31,230
Yay!

6196
06:25:33,130 --> 06:25:33,690
Yay!

6197
06:25:37,590 --> 06:25:42,810
Could have been- it was Slayer, already Tracer, it was
Kitsune, it was...

6198
06:25:46,270 --> 06:25:47,390
12 hooks.

6199
06:25:51,170 --> 06:25:52,510
Three minutes of this.

6200
06:25:53,350 --> 06:25:55,130
Three minutes of a perfect game.

6201
06:25:55,630 --> 06:25:59,730
And with my teammates, it is not going to be a perfect game
and you all know it.

6202
06:26:01,630 --> 06:26:03,710
I don't even want to peek.

6203
06:26:05,610 --> 06:26:05,970
Good kill.

6204
06:26:07,710 --> 06:26:07,830
Oh.

6205
06:26:08,810 --> 06:26:11,210
Oh, it's approaching, guys.

6206
06:26:14,210 --> 06:26:15,990
Oh, we're trying.

6207
06:26:16,270 --> 06:26:17,690
We're trying so high.

6208
06:26:20,830 --> 06:26:21,670
Oh.

6209
06:26:22,170 --> 06:26:25,290
Oh, no, I don't have suzu right now.

6210
06:26:26,930 --> 06:26:29,070
Oh, this is scary.

6211
06:26:34,910 --> 06:26:42,090
okay you have self-heal now now get your self-heal in charge
they're just waiting no oh it's okay

6212
06:26:46,650 --> 06:26:57,770
guys i think our bastion may or may not have been a through
like just maybe just say maybe

6213
06:27:02,770 --> 06:27:03,850
a reversal.

6214
06:27:04,030 --> 06:27:04,630
There's no way.

6215
06:27:04,670 --> 06:27:07,250
I got a Bastion One Trick and they gave me a reversal.

6216
06:27:07,750 --> 06:27:08,230
I got it.

6217
06:27:08,530 --> 06:27:13,630
I got a Bastion One Trick and they're giving me a reversal!

6218
06:27:18,370 --> 06:27:21,190
How is this fair?

6219
06:27:25,970 --> 06:27:27,410
It's okay, guys.

6220
06:27:28,070 --> 06:27:31,750
I achieved something that has never been achieved in
Overwatch history.

6221
06:27:32,770 --> 06:27:36,290
In Overwatch 2 history, a four-game win streak.

6222
06:27:36,970 --> 06:27:38,830
Guys, this has never been done before.

6223
06:27:39,490 --> 06:27:41,890
I got a four-game win streak, everybody.

6224
06:27:42,470 --> 06:27:42,750
I...

6225
06:27:44,310 --> 06:27:46,710
It truly was...

6226
06:27:47,690 --> 06:27:49,970
It truly was unstoppable.

6227
06:27:50,630 --> 06:27:57,310
The first one, the very first Overwatch 2 player to achieve
such a feat.

6228
06:27:58,070 --> 06:28:00,050
We were so close.

6229
06:28:00,550 --> 06:28:02,750
The four-game win streak.

6230
06:28:02,770 --> 06:28:11,850
streak right here live for all of us to see is that crazy

6231
06:28:16,870 --> 06:28:27,650

6235
06:28:55,310 --> 06:28:56,410
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

6236
06:28:56,630 --> 06:28:57,110
Thank you, thank you.

6237
06:28:57,530 --> 06:28:57,550
Exactly.

6238
06:28:57,910 --> 06:28:59,790
Don't worry, I played them with the water with no ice right
now.

6239
06:28:59,970 --> 06:29:00,610
How's it going?

6240
06:29:01,510 --> 06:29:02,350
I'm in charge.

6241
06:29:02,850 --> 06:29:03,830
Don't forget that.

6242
06:29:03,950 --> 06:29:04,890
This is it.

6243
06:29:05,630 --> 06:29:06,630
Two games in a row.

6244
06:29:07,950 --> 06:29:09,770
There's no way we could fail.

6245
06:29:10,770 --> 06:29:12,970
Two games in a row, we could do this.

6246
06:29:13,570 --> 06:29:15,110
Seems more likely than you think.

6247
06:29:15,350 --> 06:29:15,550
Chat.

6248
06:29:16,690 --> 06:29:19,430
Seems more fucking likely than you think.

6249
06:29:22,550 --> 06:29:23,670
Attackers incoming.

6250
06:29:24,790 --> 06:29:26,170
Defend objective A.

6251
06:29:26,810 --> 06:29:27,190
They're here.

6252
06:29:28,950 --> 06:29:29,770
Don't threat.

6253
06:29:30,210 --> 06:29:31,370
I see you.

6254
06:29:31,690 --> 06:29:33,530
Junker queen soldier, Hanzo.

6255
06:29:35,290 --> 06:29:36,650
No, I'm like, what?

6256
06:29:37,250 --> 06:29:38,810
How did I hit nobody?

6257
06:29:40,130 --> 06:29:41,650
Okay, some of these...

6258
06:29:42,570 --> 06:29:43,370
I blame ping.

6259
06:29:43,790 --> 06:29:44,490
I'm going high ground.

6260
06:29:44,630 --> 06:29:44,770
Wait.

6261
06:29:44,850 --> 06:29:45,530
There's no way.

6262
06:29:45,550 --> 06:29:46,570
Soldier's going right side?

6263
06:29:47,410 --> 06:29:48,510
Oh, they're all high ground.

6264
06:29:51,590 --> 06:29:52,110
Oh, guy.

6265
06:29:53,170 --> 06:29:54,590
Oh, oh, guy.

6266
06:29:58,740 --> 06:29:59,700
Oh, guy.

6267
06:30:00,300 --> 06:30:00,840
We're fine.

6268
06:30:05,390 --> 06:30:07,270
Hey, there is a Kiriko over there.

6269
06:30:12,750 --> 06:30:13,070
MP!

6270
06:30:15,290 --> 06:30:15,930
Yay!

6271
06:30:20,290 --> 06:30:20,930
Yay!

6272
06:30:22,090 --> 06:30:22,990
Oh, not yay.

6273
06:30:25,190 --> 06:30:26,390

run at me.

06:31:48,490 --> 06:31:49,210
Yep, I knew it.

6289
06:31:49,990 --> 06:31:51,090

06:32:25,130 --> 06:32:26,870
I don't know what to do.

6302
06:32:28,550 --> 06:32:30,630
I'm not finished.

6303
06:32:31,370 --> 06:32:34,290
Why is everyone so spread out?

6304
06:32:36,030 --> 06:32:36,570
Why?

6305
06:32:41,130 --> 06:32:41,510

6310
06:32:48,690 --> 06:32:49,590
This is my home.

6311
06:32:52,690 --> 06:32:53,770
Oh no, I have to reload.

6312
06:32:54,650 --> 06:32:55,050
It's okay.

6313
06:32:55,150 --> 06:32:55,830
I hit those.

6314
06:32:56,290 --> 06:32:58,920

6315
06:33:01,270 --> 06:33:02,070
It's okay.

6316
06:33:03,070 --> 06:33:03,610
We're fine.

6317
06:33:03,790 --> 06:33:04,610
Wait, they capped?

6318
06:33:05,170 --> 06:33:05,870
Wait, how?

6319
06:33:05,890 --> 06:33:07,090
When did they capped?

6320
06:33:07,830 --> 06:33:09,310
I didn't even notice!

6321
06:33:14,610 --> 06:33:16,530
I actually did not even notice the cap.

6322
06:33:19,730 --> 06:33:20,330
I'm dead.

6323
06:33:24,120 --> 06:33:25,080
JK, I'm alive.

6324
06:33:25,420 --> 06:33:26,140
We're so back.

6325
06:33:29,240 --> 06:33:30,240
We're so back.

6326
06:33:30,820 --> 06:33:32,000
I'm alive, bitch.

6327
06:33:35,710 --> 06:33:36,970
Okay, here we go.

6328
06:33:38,370 --> 06:33:39,450
I'm so scared.

6329
06:33:42,850 --> 06:33:44,190
I'm so scared.

6330
06:33:44,870 --> 06:33:45,710
I'm so scared.

6331
06:33:51,300 --> 06:33:52,420
I'm so...

6332
06:33:52,420 --> 06:33:52,740
Alright.

6333
06:33:53,360 --> 06:33:53,780
Fuck it.

6334
06:33:56,860 --> 06:33:57,600
Fuck it.

6335
06:33:58,240 --> 06:33:59,340
It was worth it.

6336
06:33:59,920 --> 06:34:00,640
It was...

6337
06:34:00,640 --> 06:34:01,580
It was worth it.

6338
06:34:01,660 --> 06:34:04,460
I know I could have waited for the nano for the blade.

6339
06:34:05,100 --> 06:34:06,380
But I can't be bothered.

6340
06:34:10,320 --> 06:34:11,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6341
06:34:11,900 --> 06:34:12,160
Ash.

6342
06:34:12,960 --> 06:34:13,340
Please.

6343
06:34:14,260 --> 06:34:14,720
Alright.

6344
06:34:17,400 --> 06:34:17,860
Alright.

6345
06:34:19,120 --> 06:34:21,840
Okay, they're gonna have Maga alt and then we're fucked.

6346
06:34:22,160 --> 06:34:24,960
As long as I'm not next to him, we should be fine, right?

6347
06:34:26,860 --> 06:34:28,800
As long as we're not next to...

6348
06:34:28,800 --> 06:34:33,300
They also have, not only do they have Maga alt, they also
have Blade.

6349
06:34:34,000 --> 06:34:35,320
But it'll be okay, right?

6350
06:34:35,880 --> 06:34:41,220
Not only do they have Blade, but they also have Soldier alt,
but we'll be fine, right?

6351
06:34:46,180 --> 06:34:49,000
Well, we'll be so fine.

6352
06:34:49,900 --> 06:34:53,320
Oh, this is it.

6353
06:34:53,620 --> 06:34:53,940
I couldn't...

6354
06:34:54,420 --> 06:34:55,280
Oh, this is it.

6355
06:34:55,640 --> 06:34:56,780
Oh, goodbye.

6356
06:34:57,160 --> 06:35:00,600
Okay, they use Rush and Maga and Blade.

6357
06:35:00,880 --> 06:35:01,340
This is it.

6358
06:35:02,340 --> 06:35:03,640
I could...

6359
06:35:03,640 --> 06:35:07,200
I could see my life flash by there.

6360
06:35:07,820 --> 06:35:08,740
I saw it.

6361
06:35:09,900 --> 06:35:13,180
I saw my life flash before me right there.

6362
06:35:13,860 --> 06:35:15,580
exactly at that moment.

6363
06:35:15,580 --> 06:35:17,280
We also have nano.

6364
06:35:18,100 --> 06:35:19,500
Yeah, we have nano cage.

6365
06:35:27,120 --> 06:35:28,380
Oh no.

6366
06:35:31,860 --> 06:35:32,340
No!

6367
06:35:34,940 --> 06:35:35,300
No!

6368
06:35:40,680 --> 06:35:42,660
It's because they went Malga!

6369
06:35:43,940 --> 06:35:44,780
I'm so close.

6370
06:35:44,900 --> 06:35:45,680
It was so close.

6371
06:35:46,740 --> 06:35:47,880
We were so close.

6372
06:35:49,340 --> 06:35:55,360
They still had bl- No, we had bl- This team is the anti-fun
police.

6373

06:36:01,620 --> 06:36:03,720
Dude, I hate all of you so much.

6375
06:36:05,520 --> 06:36:07,320
We were this close.

6376
06:36:09,480 --> 06:36:12,500
We were this close, everybody.

6377
06:36:22,450 --> 06:36:23,970
Oh my god.

6378
06:36:25,650 --> 06:36:28,170
I can't believe it

6379
06:36:31,990 --> 06:36:36,930
We were right there We were right there

6380
06:36:40,030 --> 06:36:51,110

Right here, right now.

6383
06:36:59,990 --> 06:37:02,250
No, my sanity is perfectly healthy.

6384
06:37:04,890 --> 06:37:05,770
My sanity.

6385
06:37:07,890 --> 06:37:08,510
No.

6386
06:37:11,850 --> 06:37:13,170
I can change heroes.

6387
06:37:14,710 --> 06:37:15,330
Yeah, I can't.

6388
06:37:16,010 --> 06:37:17,390
This is it.

6389
06:37:18,450 --> 06:37:19,630
Is it Maga?

6390
06:37:20,370 --> 06:37:22,510
Oh my god, I almost...

6391
06:37:22,510 --> 06:37:23,350
A headshot there.

6392
06:37:25,170 --> 06:37:26,170
Where is he?

6393
06:37:34,000 --> 06:37:36,400
Oh, he's actually so low, though.

6394
06:37:37,320 --> 06:37:38,220
I think it's actually not fair.

6395
06:37:39,520 --> 06:37:40,400
How low he was.

6396
06:37:42,460 --> 06:37:44,780

Oh, I know for sure your HP is going down.

6422

Go, Kirko!

6454
06:41:06,240 --> 06:41:07,260

06:41:15,060 --> 06:41:16,160
Oh my god, that's embarrassing.

6459
06:41:19,360 --> 06:41:21,760
Their bath looks like he has a window.

6460
06:41:25,900 --> 06:41:27,380
Oh my god.

6461
06:41:28,060 --> 06:41:28,400

Yeah, I have pulse too soon.

6472
06:42:50,140 --> 06:42:51,640
Look, all I'm saying is...

6473
06:42:53,360 --> 06:42:55,460
If we have time, I'll swap to Ana.

6474
06:42:58,160 --> 06:42:59,500
Okay, there we go.

6475
06:43:00,440 --> 06:43:02,880
I need to get my fucking wall in time.

6476
06:43:05,860 --> 06:43:07,080
Oh, nice.

6477
06:43:09,420 --> 06:43:10,120
Go!

6478
06:43:10,680 --> 06:43:11,340
No!

6479
06:43:11,660 --> 06:43:12,560
Get gone!

6480
06:43:13,160 --> 06:43:14,680
That is so embarrassing!

6481
06:43:15,080 --> 06:43:18,000
I have to touch Kiri, Kiri, Kiri, Kiri, Kiri.

6482
06:43:23,620 --> 06:43:24,320
No!

6483
06:43:28,460 --> 06:43:29,160
No!

6484
06:43:31,810 --> 06:43:33,450
I just got trans!

6485
06:43:34,290 --> 06:43:34,610
No!

6486
06:43:35,670 --> 06:43:38,630
I can't believe it.

6487
06:43:38,650 --> 06:43:39,830
I literally just got trans.

6488
06:43:41,370 --> 06:43:43,910
I was like the deal breaker here.

6489
06:43:45,930 --> 06:43:48,130
I literally just got it too.

6490
06:43:52,170 --> 06:43:52,790
Oh no.

6491
06:43:53,490 --> 06:43:54,370
They have Mogul.

6492
06:43:56,170 --> 06:43:58,630
They have Mogul.

6493
06:44:03,770 --> 06:44:06,050
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6494
06:44:09,390 --> 06:44:10,750
Oh, hell no.

6495
06:44:10,970 --> 06:44:12,470
Oh, get out, get out, get out.

6496
06:44:12,630 --> 06:44:13,170
Leave, leave, leave.

6497
06:44:13,310 --> 06:44:14,690
No, we lost our Hanjo!

6498
06:44:16,530 --> 06:44:17,970
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

6499
06:44:18,090 --> 06:44:19,330
That's a good kill.

6500
06:44:21,510 --> 06:44:22,190
They have Raj.

6501
06:44:22,930 --> 06:44:23,370
I'm engaged.

6502
06:44:23,610 --> 06:44:24,610
We have to get in there.

6503
06:44:24,650 --> 06:44:25,530
I have Trent!

6504
06:44:26,370 --> 06:44:27,710
Just make sure I live!

6505
06:44:28,330 --> 06:44:29,410
Oh, they have Blade, too.

6506
06:44:29,890 --> 06:44:32,230
Which is...

6507
06:44:32,230 --> 06:44:33,250
Oh, God, no.

6508
06:44:33,410 --> 06:44:34,450
They have Blade, guys.

6509
06:44:35,090 --> 06:44:35,570
Guys.

6510
06:44:36,370 --> 06:44:37,310
They have Blade.

6511
06:44:38,090 --> 06:44:39,050
So, like...

6512
06:44:39,050 --> 06:44:40,430
There we go.

6513
06:44:41,730 --> 06:44:41,950
Oh!

6514
06:44:45,990 --> 06:44:47,870
How is he alive?

6515
06:44:48,730 --> 06:44:52,170
Oh my gosh, this is bad.

6516
06:44:52,810 --> 06:44:53,690
This is so bad

6517
06:44:58,240 --> 06:45:18,390
Oh my god I kicked them off I kicked them off Oh my god That
took me kick That's the only way That was the only Wait!

6518
06:45:21,830 --> 06:45:24,650
Cosmetic links for the win.

6519
06:45:27,150 --> 06:45:29,870
The thing is...

6520
06:45:29,870 --> 06:45:33,130
I don't know if I should play...

6521
06:45:33,130 --> 06:45:36,970
I don't know if I should fucking play Anna or Zen.

6522
06:45:37,790 --> 06:45:40,210
Because they've both been working so well.

6523
06:45:40,630 --> 06:45:42,790
I will not leave a broken world behind.

6524
06:45:42,930 --> 06:45:44,350
I can't believe it.

6525
06:45:44,470 --> 06:45:46,450
I kicked him off.

6526
06:45:50,330 --> 06:45:51,450
Holy shit.

6527
06:45:53,530 --> 06:45:54,030
Nothing ventured.

6528
06:45:54,790 --> 06:45:55,510
Nothing gained.

6529
06:45:55,950 --> 06:45:56,650
This is it.

6530
06:45:59,330 --> 06:46:01,130
It should be it.

6531
06:46:02,170 --> 06:46:03,370
My mother trained half our team.

6532
06:46:04,050 --> 06:46:06,050
I'll sign the rest of you up for lessons.

6533
06:46:07,410 --> 06:46:09,290
Can I stick with Zen?

6534
06:46:09,490 --> 06:46:10,050
Play Zen?

6535
06:46:10,430 --> 06:46:10,610
Okay.

6536
06:46:12,970 --> 06:46:13,950
But we could build Nano!

6537
06:46:14,310 --> 06:46:15,870
We will find Tranquility.

6538
06:46:15,870 --> 06:46:17,150
But we could build Nano though.

6539
06:46:18,810 --> 06:46:21,570
I feel like I should play Ana for the Nano.

6540
06:46:22,730 --> 06:46:24,170
I'm going to go for the Nano.

6541
06:46:24,870 --> 06:46:27,150
The Nano for the...

6542
06:46:28,790 --> 06:46:32,770
The Nano for the, you know, the Genji Blade.

6543
06:46:37,250 --> 06:46:38,050
It might be worth it.

6544
06:46:38,890 --> 06:46:39,990
Just think of the plan.

6545
06:46:44,440 --> 06:46:45,940
This is why I went Ana.

6546
06:46:46,260 --> 06:46:47,660
They have no...

6547
06:46:55,300 --> 06:46:56,220
Oh, no.

6548
06:46:56,760 --> 06:46:58,520
No, the Torbjard!

6549
06:47:01,580 --> 06:47:04,020
Even if I was Zen, even if I was Zen, it would not have
mattered.

6550
06:47:04,280 --> 06:47:08,700
I'm going to say, it would not have mattered if I was Yada.

6551
06:47:12,940 --> 06:47:14,240
A junk rat.

6552
06:47:19,300 --> 06:47:21,360
Zen could have kicked the way.

6553
06:47:22,080 --> 06:47:22,960
It would not matter.

6554
06:47:23,080 --> 06:47:23,760
All I'm saying.

6555
06:47:31,010 --> 06:47:32,330
More dead, more dead.

6556
06:47:35,590 --> 06:47:37,710
After reload, after reload.

6557
06:47:43,710 --> 06:47:44,350
Okay.

6558
06:47:45,970 --> 06:47:46,110
Okay.

6559
06:47:47,570 --> 06:47:48,810
Alright, here we go.

6560
06:47:49,070 --> 06:47:50,610
Zen would have kicked.

6561
06:47:54,650 --> 06:47:57,530
Guys, it would not have mattered if I...

6562
06:48:04,250 --> 06:48:05,610
I don't mind.

6563
06:48:05,630 --> 06:48:06,770
I almost have all two.

6564
06:48:11,260 --> 06:48:13,120
I'm just gonna reload just in case.

6565
06:48:22,540 --> 06:48:26,180
I'm a little scared knocking to that.

6566
06:48:34,490 --> 06:48:37,670
What is going on?

6567
06:48:40,370 --> 06:48:42,650
I told you!

6568
06:48:43,290 --> 06:48:44,350
Trust the nano!

6569
06:48:45,390 --> 06:48:47,150
Trust the nano.

6570
06:48:47,990 --> 06:49:04,150
what the same what the is happening what the fuck is
happening what the fuck okay I wish I could heal the tire

6571
06:49:20,680 --> 06:49:26,840
oh god oh god oh god oh

6572
06:49:30,420 --> 06:49:46,480
my god oh my god where is there a turret there Oh my god
There was so many things There was so many things Why were

6573
06:49:46,480 --> 06:49:48,640
there so many things

6574
06:49:51,700 --> 06:50:04,240
Okay Now the question is Zen or I'm gonna go Zen yada The
trans The trans might be clutch The trans could be Clutch

6575
06:50:04,260 --> 06:50:06,400
much as all I'm saying.

6576
06:50:09,740 --> 06:50:10,940
This could be it.

6577
06:50:11,600 --> 06:50:13,240
We might need this for the trans.

6578
06:50:14,040 --> 06:50:14,960
Amid discord.

6579
06:50:15,140 --> 06:50:16,320
I like the main thing.

6580
06:50:17,220 --> 06:50:17,740
Tranquility.

6581
06:50:18,560 --> 06:50:19,340
They have us coming.

6582
06:50:19,740 --> 06:50:20,680
So let's give it to them.

6583
06:50:21,220 --> 06:50:21,980
Good to see you.

6584
06:50:24,180 --> 06:50:24,240
Hey.

6585
06:50:24,620 --> 06:50:24,980
Hello.

6586
06:50:27,360 --> 06:50:28,880
We're almost there.

6587
06:50:29,560 --> 06:50:34,080
I think I think the craziest part is this might be the
longest stream I've done on this channel.

6588
06:50:34,260 --> 06:50:34,740
far.

6589
06:50:36,180 --> 06:50:40,600
I don't have a problem.

6590
06:50:40,900 --> 06:50:43,240
I can stop at any time.

6591
06:50:43,700 --> 06:50:45,300
So far, yes.

6592
06:50:46,700 --> 06:50:48,100
I swear I can stop.

6593
06:50:48,180 --> 06:50:49,400
Resident Evil was seven hours.

6594
06:50:53,690 --> 06:50:54,950
But don't worry.

6595
06:51:06,780 --> 06:51:09,000
It's not about the gaining of Elos.

6596
06:51:09,180 --> 06:51:11,260
It's about the friends we made all alive.

6597
06:51:17,110 --> 06:51:18,030
Holy shit!

6598
06:51:18,690 --> 06:51:21,350
Okay, he got fucking deleted!

6599
06:51:22,050 --> 06:51:23,890
Oh my god!

6600
06:51:25,590 --> 06:51:26,950
Holy shit!

6601
06:51:29,050 --> 06:51:30,030
Big damage.

6602
06:51:30,430 --> 06:51:31,230
They're on Bastion now.

6603
06:51:32,250 --> 06:51:32,550
Christ.

6604
06:51:32,890 --> 06:51:34,250
And they're on Hanso instead of Ganji.

6605
06:51:34,930 --> 06:51:36,050
That damage was crazy.

6606
06:51:37,210 --> 06:51:38,410
What friends did you make?

6607
06:51:38,590 --> 06:51:39,490
You guys!

6608
06:51:44,330 --> 06:51:47,870
Okay, someone's gonna be like, you, perilous, parasocialist.

6609
06:51:48,470 --> 06:51:51,810
You guys, guys.

6610
06:51:53,690 --> 06:51:54,730
You're my friend.

6611
06:52:06,110 --> 06:52:07,570
Okay, I got it.

6612
06:52:08,430 --> 06:52:09,030
Oh, that's okay.

6613
06:52:10,990 --> 06:52:12,190
Parasocial andy.

6614
06:52:12,930 --> 06:52:13,530
Whoa!

6615
06:52:14,370 --> 06:52:14,390
Whoa!

6616
06:52:14,390 --> 06:52:20,750
That's what top care.

6617
06:52:20,750 --> 06:52:26,110
Dink Is he still up top?

6618
06:52:26,630 --> 06:52:31,410
Here we go.

6619
06:52:31,790 --> 06:52:32,210
Here we go.

6620
06:52:32,690 --> 06:52:33,630
We're alive!

6621
06:52:34,170 --> 06:52:34,710
We're alive!

6622
06:52:42,950 --> 06:52:52,090
Don't keep me there so I am uncomfortable I'm killing myself
Whoa

6623
06:52:56,670 --> 06:53:00,350
I'm sorry, but I prefer you as a streamer.

6624
06:53:09,490 --> 06:53:11,990
What the fuck?

6625
06:53:20,290 --> 06:53:21,690
It's okay, guys!

6626
06:53:22,290 --> 06:53:23,990
My Discord is still on him!

6627
06:53:24,190 --> 06:53:24,650
I think?

6628
06:53:25,730 --> 06:53:26,990
We did it!

6629
06:53:27,290 --> 06:53:27,590
Okay.

6630
06:53:27,830 --> 06:53:28,670
You fucking ass.

6631
06:53:28,790 --> 06:53:29,610

Okay.

6648
06:56:03,010 --> 06:56:05,190

06:56:09,270 --> 06:56:09,990

06:56:18,770 --> 06:56:19,310
Funny story.

06:56:19,490 --> 06:56:19,810
There you go.

6656
06:56:20,070 --> 06:56:20,610
That's all.

6657
06:56:22,390 --> 06:56:24,950
If only you'll know what the story was.

6658
06:56:26,270 --> 06:56:27,430
I guess you'll never know.

6659
06:56:28,950 --> 06:56:32,050
It's too bad you'll never know what the story was, guys.

6660
06:56:35,350 --> 06:56:36,990
Oh my god.

6661
06:56:38,830 --> 06:56:41,290
Guys, there's a juggernaut behind us!

6662
06:56:41,750 --> 06:56:42,830
So funny.

6663
06:56:46,430 --> 06:56:52,150
Okay, guys, all right, Doki, please, we can't keep a fort
paying your assures that we can meet someone.

6664
06:56:52,690 --> 06:56:54,450
Thank you for the super chat.

6665
06:56:54,710 --> 06:56:54,930
Thank you.

6666
06:56:54,950 --> 06:56:55,550
Thank you.

6667
06:56:55,750 --> 06:56:56,690
Okay, funny story.

6668
06:56:57,270 --> 06:56:58,490
I remember when this was.

6669
06:56:58,570 --> 06:57:00,670
I think this was, like, one or two years ago or something.

6670
06:57:01,210 --> 06:57:05,110
And I got invited to do, like, a testing of Overwatch 2 or
something.

6671
06:57:05,310 --> 06:57:09,750
I think it was like, yeah, like, like, a testing of...

6672
06:57:09,750 --> 06:57:10,790
Not testing.

6673
06:57:10,890 --> 06:57:11,190
Oh, yeah.

6674
06:57:11,450 --> 06:57:12,070
Not testing.

6675
06:57:12,250 --> 06:57:12,390
Sorry.

6676
06:57:12,510 --> 06:57:17,670
It was, like, It was some fucking in-house scrims or
something with...

6677
06:57:18,410 --> 06:57:20,610
With a bunch of like Overwatch content creators.

6678
06:57:20,810 --> 06:57:23,390
And I was like, oh cool, I didn't stream it because I was
like tired.

6679
06:57:23,870 --> 06:57:25,030
So then I joined it.

6680
06:57:25,290 --> 06:57:29,590
What I didn't realize is that devs were...

6681
06:57:31,990 --> 06:57:33,870
Devs were part of it.

6682
06:57:34,750 --> 06:57:36,710
So I didn't realize this.

6683
06:57:37,270 --> 06:57:43,310
And then so one of the content creators was asking for my
opinion on Overwatch 2.

6684
06:57:43,630 --> 06:57:46,750
And I straight up was like, I don't know, it's just
Overwatch 1.

6685
06:57:46,930 --> 06:57:49,150
It's just the maps are different except, like, oh, you know.

6686
06:57:49,450 --> 06:57:53,950
I would be like, you know, just the maps are, like, a little
different.

6687
06:57:54,090 --> 06:57:57,050
Like, oh, like, oh, one of the maps just is, like, nighttime
and daytime.

6688
06:57:57,390 --> 06:57:59,630
And then all my team was...

6689
06:58:04,790 --> 06:58:07,590
All my team were Overwatch...

6690
06:58:07,590 --> 06:58:09,710
Can we save now for H?

6691
06:58:11,990 --> 06:58:12,870
And then...

6692
06:58:14,370 --> 06:58:15,990
One of them...

6693
06:58:15,990 --> 06:58:17,630
I think like...

6694
06:58:18,910 --> 06:58:19,510
So...

6695
06:58:19,510 --> 06:58:21,190
Yeah, that...

6696
06:58:21,190 --> 06:58:24,010
That was a jokie moment right there.

6697
06:58:24,170 --> 06:58:25,310
It was a...

6698
06:58:26,010 --> 06:58:27,810
That's a manga moment.

6699
06:58:28,130 --> 06:58:28,970
And then...

6700
06:58:28,970 --> 06:58:36,370
And then I remember one of the comic creators was like,
well, obviously, like, since, you know, this guy is the

6701
06:58:36,370 --> 06:58:38,870
developer, maybe he could take that as...

6702
06:58:38,870 --> 06:58:39,730
as feedback.

6703
06:58:40,350 --> 06:58:43,070
And I was like, oh shit!

6704
06:58:43,630 --> 06:58:48,530
I was just like, oh, wait, is the desert here?

6705
06:58:49,410 --> 06:58:53,630
The desert, desert part of the fucking scrums?

6706
06:58:54,190 --> 06:58:54,410
Oh!

6707
06:58:56,490 --> 06:58:58,810
This is a certified dokey moment.

6708
06:58:59,850 --> 06:59:03,050
Very certified dokey moment, definitely.

6709
06:59:05,490 --> 06:59:10,650
I would have logged off and changed my name.

6710
06:59:14,770 --> 06:59:17,150
I should have was like, it's just Overwatch 1.

6711
06:59:17,450 --> 06:59:19,750
Like, I was like, that's what I said.

6712
06:59:20,210 --> 06:59:22,150
I was like, it's just Overwatch 1.

6713
06:59:22,330 --> 06:59:27,270
Like the maps are just like, oh, like there's new maps, but
it's just like daytime and nighttime.

6714
06:59:33,350 --> 06:59:33,810
Like...

6715
06:59:33,810 --> 06:59:35,310
Oh, it's me.

6716
06:59:36,050 --> 06:59:37,350
Can you kill their Larry?

6717
06:59:39,030 --> 06:59:39,610
It's me.

6718
06:59:40,490 --> 06:59:41,950
You weren't lying.

6719
06:59:46,340 --> 06:59:57,600
so yeah that was they hated toky because she told the truth
i can't believe it i got baited i got baited and seeing my

6720
06:59:57,600 --> 07:00:07,760
thoughts because when the conicators asked for my opinion
and then i didn't realize i didn't realize it the viewer had

6721
07:00:07,760 --> 07:00:10,200
gems in the team oh my god let's go

6722
07:00:24,290 --> 07:00:26,670
I got set up!

6723
07:00:27,470 --> 07:00:29,530
I got fucking set up!

6724
07:00:35,920 --> 07:00:37,860
Oh, this is a little awkward.

6725
07:00:40,560 --> 07:00:40,980
Thanks.

6726
07:00:45,500 --> 07:00:45,640
Whoa.

6727
07:00:49,300 --> 07:00:50,580
He's like one hit.

6728
07:00:51,800 --> 07:00:52,240
Oh, yeah.

6729
07:00:52,780 --> 07:00:53,460
Oh, shit.

6730
07:00:53,600 --> 07:00:54,520
No, don't look at that.

6731
07:00:55,700 --> 07:00:56,220
Nice.

6732
07:00:57,220 --> 07:00:58,720
Literally left him.

6733
07:00:59,200 --> 07:01:00,840
How are the next points in front of us?

6734
07:01:01,920 --> 07:01:02,280
Whoa.

6735
07:01:03,180 --> 07:01:04,080
There's a weedo.

6736
07:01:05,060 --> 07:01:06,020
Feel the weedo.

6737
07:01:08,560 --> 07:01:09,520
Okay, we got this.

6738
07:01:10,640 --> 07:01:11,500
Oh, poor Lucio.

6739
07:01:11,820 --> 07:01:13,140
I'm heading over to the point.

6740
07:01:15,280 --> 07:01:16,520
We got it.

6741
07:01:19,100 --> 07:01:20,360
Oh, I hear them.

6742
07:01:22,640 --> 07:01:24,500
Oh, he got baited.

6743
07:01:24,560 --> 07:01:25,680
Just like how I got baited.

6744
07:01:25,700 --> 07:01:37,840
the shintaga overwatch in front of devs almost the same
thing oh yeah oh yes

6745
07:01:41,600 --> 07:01:51,840
almost the same thing now he knows your thing the thing is
it wasn't one overwatch devs it was like two overwatch devs

6746
07:01:51,840 --> 07:01:53,460
on my team so

6747
07:01:57,120 --> 07:02:00,380
And this was when Overwatch 2 just came out.

6748
07:02:01,000 --> 07:02:02,480
That was like...

6749
07:02:02,480 --> 07:02:03,160
It gets...

6750
07:02:03,160 --> 07:02:05,460
I like how the more I talk about this, the worse it gets.

6751
07:02:05,540 --> 07:02:07,880
It was when it just came out, too.

6752
07:02:12,120 --> 07:02:14,460
So it was even more awkward.

6753
07:02:15,000 --> 07:02:15,760
Did they say anything?

6754
07:02:15,760 --> 07:02:16,640
I don't remember.

6755
07:02:16,800 --> 07:02:17,920
I was so embarrassed.

6756
07:02:18,340 --> 07:02:22,900
I was so embarrassed with everything that happened.

6757
07:02:23,460 --> 07:02:25,220
I actually don't remember.

6758
07:02:25,460 --> 07:02:27,460
I'm just gonna fight for a little bit later.

6759
07:02:28,780 --> 07:02:29,500
No!

6760
07:02:30,040 --> 07:02:36,500
It's okay, I need to play Kierko anyway because they went
fucking on a life flash before your ass.

6761
07:02:37,520 --> 07:02:38,180
That's fine.

6762
07:02:38,840 --> 07:02:41,080
The blackout from anxiety.

6763
07:02:41,900 --> 07:02:44,060
Bro blocked up memories.

6764
07:02:44,900 --> 07:02:47,100
You would block the memories too!

6765
07:02:47,220 --> 07:02:48,260
What do you mean?

6766
07:02:50,140 --> 07:02:50,860
Imagine...

6767
07:02:55,180 --> 07:02:58,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, just something similar, like, yeah, thank
you, the super chat, thank you.

6768
07:02:58,720 --> 07:03:05,800
I called, like, the playtesters and some of the devs and
Apex, like, bots, because I was like, I was like, oh, my

6769
07:03:05,800 --> 07:03:07,920
God, you guys are real play, oh, shit.

6770
07:03:08,040 --> 07:03:08,860
I have a plan.

6771
07:03:09,660 --> 07:03:17,540
Because I got invited to an Apex playtest, and then I was
just like, I was like, wait, these are real people, because,

6772
07:03:17,760 --> 07:03:24,380
like, I thought, like, people on my team and also, like, the
people on the enemy teams were, like, bots, like, actual,

6773
07:03:24,540 --> 07:03:25,000
like, bots.

6774
07:03:25,020 --> 07:03:27,400
And then I realized wait a minute.

They're actually like sort of communicating in text And I
was like, are you guys real p?
