1
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:03,630
Ladies, gentlemen, and non-biny-finies, welcome to WrestleTuber 2024 Day 2!

2
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,750
Day 1 was an intense day of London bridges, colorful characters, and a bit of scuff.

3
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,210
But what surprises await us today?

4
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,550
Stay tuned!

5
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:31,730
And now, presenting your overlord, your caster, the one, the only, Donkey!

6
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,020
Oh my god, wow!

7
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,640
I did not expect that intro!

8
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,960
Oh my god, just need you guys to know, he was very nervous before we started.

9
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,340
He was like, I don't know what to say guys.

10
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,440
Oh wow, that was amazing!

11
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,120
Give it up for our announcer there!

12
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,620
Woo!

13
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,580
Anyway, welcome to Day 2 of WrestleTuber!

14
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,220
What we'll be doing for Day 2 is the remaining brackets and then the finals!

15
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,700
To find out who will be the champion of WrestleTuber 2024!

16
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,800
Very exciting day today.

17
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,540
We actually have, it's a little less scuffed.

18
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,520
They're still gonna be scuffed because I am a one man opioid.

19
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,940
I am a BS person.

20
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,740
But we did improve the tech and behind the scenes for all of you guys.

21
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,140
So I hope you guys, look I even have my own, like we even had time to afford a custom headset as well.

22
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,080
Instead of the default headset.

23
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,520
But we actually have a set schedule for the casters as well as what the matches are.

24
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,520
So I'll give you guys the rundown of the brackets and who's gonna be casting who.

25
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,760
Mint and I will be casting the finals.

26
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
The last couple of final matches.

27
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:24,440
So at the first set of rotations, we actually have two special guests that will be doing, that will be casting the show matches for us.

28
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,100
We have someone that has been in the actual WWE!

29
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,600
Casting the show match with BuffBuff, Blue Sea, Maryletter and Shy Lily.

30
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,260
And so our special guest is actually Jibo.

31
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:53,040
If you guys don't know who Jibo is, he was in the actual WWE Mason Mace.

32
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,460
If you guys don't remember Mason...

33
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,240
He was actually in WWE.

34
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,460
And he will be doing the casting with Taka for the show match.

35
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm sorry, it's not John Cena.

36
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
Sorry, Mason D Madden.

37
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
It is not...

38
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,900
Guys, it is not John Cena.

39
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,800
I mean technically he could be there.

40
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,480
He could just be in the background.

41
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,440
We don't really know.

42
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,300
You can't really see him.

43
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,320
Anyway, so for the brackets.

44
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,600
After the show match.

45
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,440
After the tag team show match.

46
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,200
This will be our bracket for the day.

47
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,320
It's a little bit more professional now.

48
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,640
So the very first match after the brackets.

49
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,400
Sorry, after the show match.

50
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,460
Will be Fuyo versus Snuffy.

51
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Then after that, whoever wins that match will be against Nana.

52
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,960
And then whoever wins that match will be against Emma.

53
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,820
And then after that, we have bracket two.

54
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,480
This bracket will be casted by Snuffy and Fillion.

55
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,020
So right after the show matches with our guest casters.

56
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
Taka and Jibo.

57
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
We will have Snuffy and Fillion casting these matches.

58
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,180
In bracket two.

59
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,940
Sorry, this is the original.

60
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,140
I just say there will be a little bit of scuff.

61
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,260
They will also be casting Luto versus Sayu as well.

62
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,080
After that, we will rotate our casters.

63
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,160
With Kai and Octavio.

64
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,680
Unfortunately, Gerard has to...

65
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,120
Gerard has to...

66
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,500
Is sick right now.

67
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,380
So he will be substituted by Kai.

68
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,380
And from there, they will be casting the winner of the Luto versus Sayu match against Anon.

69
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,380
And then after that, they will be casting for the two of the final matches.

70
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,320
For the final matches.

71
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,520
For the final bracket.

72
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,580
Mint and I will be spinning a wheel.

73
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,780
To dictate who will be facing who in the final bracket.

74
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,600
And from then on...

75
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
And then we find the champion!

76
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,800
Yay!

77
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,560
It's going to be a very exciting day.

78
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,900
I hope you guys will enjoy day two.

79
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
It's going to be very fun.

80
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm so excited.

81
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,200
And I'm really...

82
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,560
Happy with...

83
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,120
How...

84
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,100
Like talented everybody was.

85
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,860
How incredible everyone was.

86
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,200
From day one.

87
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,200
And everybody's hard efforts.

88
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
And all the participants.

89
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,300
So far in WrestleTuber.

90
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,780
I hope you guys will enjoy day two!

91
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,380
Everybody!

92
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,340
I really do hope you guys will enjoy day two.

93
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,000
Anyway!

94
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,460
From then on...

95
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,700
Remember!

96
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,420
Remember...

97
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you guys remember what the belt looks like?

98
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,420
Because whoever is going to win this show match...

99
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,440
Will be bringing this belt...

100
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,420
Home tonight!

101
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,060
Well not tonight.

102
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,260
They still have to ship it.

103
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,140
But they get the PNG tonight!

104
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,860
Alright!

105
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,480
Well I guess that's it for me in the main casting chair.

106
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,200
So let's go over to our guest casters.

107
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,680
In the interview section.

108
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,920
Bye guys!

109
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,620
What a day for wrestling!

110
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,400
Let me tell you it's great to be here.

111
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,520
Back to VTubing after 10 months.

112
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,300
Alongside you Yebo!

113
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,320
Taka it is pandemonium in the WrestleDrome!

114
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,580
How are you feeling tonight?

115
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,700
You had to come out of hiatus.

116
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,800
I had to come out of retirement.

117
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,620
This is a big fight feel!

118
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,700
Oh without a shadow of a doubt.

119
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,180
Night one was explosive.

120
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,740
So that means night two will be implosive.

121
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,700
It expands and now it retracts.

122
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,060
And as it retracts more things will be colliding in the center of that squared circle.

123
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
Ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,180
Yeah I'm going to explode all over the place Taka.

125
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,600
We are both guest casting here tonight.

126
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,340
I am Yellow Snow Taka Hata.

127
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,520
And I am joined by Dick Inky Yebo.

128
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,160
Yes you can call me Dick Inky.

129
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,440
That is my commentary name.

130
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,020
I'm the only person here to have Vince McMahon yapping in my ear during commentary during a horrible Hell in a Cell match.

131
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,540
Tonight I've got Doki in my ear.

132
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,940
So if I say anything bad it's her fault.

133
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,220
There we go.

134
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,740
You got it.

135
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,660
You confirmed it right here.

136
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,180
She is the master of this domain.

137
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,660
Her domain has expanded to encapsulate professional wrestling as well.

138
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,180
And we're up for a heck of a first bout here.

139
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,980
Because I believe we're having a mixtag action.

140
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,360
And I believe we have an interview set to be taking away.

141
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,560
Please take us away Juna.

142
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,520
Hello.

143
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,060
Thank you so much.

144
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,420
Hello.

145
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,860
Right now we have...

146
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,360
We have...

147
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
Oh I'm sorry.

148
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh it's so cute.

149
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,640
We have Mary, Lucy, Shy Lily and the buff pup here.

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,020
Right now they are...

151
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,340
That's me.

152
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,900
You scared me.

153
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,460
We were talking and we like got thrown in here and I got scared.

154
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,540
I was like what happened?

155
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,080
I am God.

156
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,940
I took you here.

157
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,360
You should have waited.

158
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,480
Yes, all to the inside.

159
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,000
Lay your praises upon me for I have arrived.

160
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,720
Amazing.

161
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,460
Incredible.

162
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,580
Our show match will be consisting of two tag teams.

163
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,580
Consisting of Mary and buff pup and Lucy and Shy Lily.

164
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,340
So for the two dog pros.

165
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,620
We are going to have a little bit of a battle.

166
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,200
How are you feeling about this match so far?

167
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,320
Well I'm...

168
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,340
When it comes to double D's that's what we are.

169
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,080
We are the double D crew.

170
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,520
Okay.

171
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,180
I feel very confident.

172
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,460
Just because dogs get things done.

173
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,120
So.

174
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,380
Yeah.

175
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,340
They do.

176
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,980
Dogs back where it's gone.

177
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,900
Well they got sort of bones.

178
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,060
That's true.

179
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,860
I'm certain we are going to win because I've got buff pup.

180
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,280
So I mean they are done.

181
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,880
That's true.

182
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,720
And also like I like bones so like if I make Shy Lily and Lucy a skeleton then I can just take them.

183
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,160
So.

184
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Oh I see.

185
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,140
Yeah.

186
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,360
Oh I didn't think about that.

187
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I'll give you a scratch.

188
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,580
Well what do the two cute girls have to say in response?

189
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,120
I want buff to sit on my face.

190
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,980
Alright done.

191
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,260
Easy.

192
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,560
I mean I'm a...

193
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,800
I got a bone that you can chew on.

194
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,120
But it's not much of a...

195
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,140
Tension.

196
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:03,940
Tension.

197
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,260
Tension.

198
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,220
Tension.

199
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,060
Tension.

200
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,160
Tension.

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,600
Tension.

202
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,640
Tension.

203
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:07,840
Tension.

204
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:07,860
Tension.

205
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,180
Tension.

206
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,420
Tension.

207
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,020
Tension.

208
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,780
Tension.

209
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,520
Tension.

210
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,740
What about a bone?

211
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,060
It's not about resting it's about just like body contact with way too much skin.

212
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah honestly like if I win or lose like I think I'm winning regardless so.

213
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,200
You know.

214
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
I'm winning either way.

215
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,220
I'm a great...

216
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,460
I'm happy to hear that there's great sportsmanship and skinship here.

217
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,860
With all of the contestants in the show match.

218
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,840
Well other than being choked cold and being sat on.

219
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,100
I hope you guys do well in the ring.

220
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,940
Thank you.

221
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,240
And good luck.

222
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
Thank you.

223
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,380
Yes of course.

224
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,500
Thank you.

225
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,320
Thank you so much.

226
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,060
Goodbye.

227
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,240
Goodbye!

228
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,520
Please fight me.

229
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:46,920
Goodbye.

230
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,500
See you.

231
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,660
Bye.

232
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,160
Now I gotta say, one tag team is absolutely gorgeous.

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,680
Well, they're both gorgeous, to be honest, but one team does appear to have that dog in them.

234
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,960
That dog is very important when it comes to a professional wrestling match, Taka.

235
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,780
Because they can run around on all fours like a hound.

236
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,300
But so can cats.

237
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,480
That's true.

238
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,920
But not like hounds, but like cats.

239
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,660
Speaking of cats and dogs, that's what this scrap is gonna be all about, let me tell you.

240
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,280
It's like a feral free-for-all.

241
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
A fo-ree-for-all.

242
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,660
A fo-for-for-for-free-for-all, correct.

243
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,360
Absolutely.

244
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,180
Absolutely.

245
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,820
Now I gotta, I gotta get, let's take it away to our ring announcer.

246
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:42,380
In this corner, you can hear them barking from two corners of the planet.

247
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,620
You have the Buff Bro Buff Pop and...

248
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,170
The tension is palpable, I do not know what they're about to say.

249
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:01,010
Well, what's happening right now is the, is the big dog is making their entrance singles, because they are not...

250
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,290
Taking their sweet time.

251
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:13,610
I mean, when you look at this buff, you look this talented, you look this amazing, you'd take your time too, basking in this adulation from this wonderful capacity.

252
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,730
And I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie.

253
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,210
You have a capacity crown of over 13,000 people in the Wrestler Trooper Dome.

254
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:18,470
What are we right now, Taka?

255
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,350
What?

256
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,790
What, what state are we in right now?

257
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,870
A state of denial, Yebo!

258
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,930
Yes, yes, that's the correct answer.

259
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,570
Because no one can deny it.

260
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,330
You can see everybody in the audience here tonight.

261
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,070
How buff this pup is.

262
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,970
Where does that tail go?

263
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,560
Oh Rob...

264
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,000
Ring announcer!

265
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,740
I love this guy!

266
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,160
And in this corner, you have the Buff Bro Buff Pop.

267
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,460
See, that is a classy outfit there.

268
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,600
It looks expensive, it looks velvety.

269
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,640
I can appreciate Meriwether getting a custom model just for this occasion with their symbol on the back.

270
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,420
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

271
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,560
Money, money, money, money.

272
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,860
Usually people smoke in that jacket, but he may end up smoking the competition in it.

273
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,260
Let's see if he can make it rain on his competition tonight.

274
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,320
And their opponent...

275
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,300
coming in from the other side of the ring...

276
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,700
it's not just Lucy Juicy...

277
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,820
it's Lucy Pyre!

278
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,440
Now hold on now, Taka.

279
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,360
Did she just wake up?

280
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
Clearly she was napping in the back.

281
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,200
They got themselves a coffee.

282
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,120
They still have brought the blanket because they're not fully awake.

283
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,180
You know that thing when you wake up in the morning and you're like, I'm gonna go get my coffee.

284
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,020
And like, you know, I appreciate the dedication to taking some time to get some sleep.

285
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,680
Because the one thing you don't want to do is sleep on the competition.

286
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,500
And that might be what happens...

287
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,120
I just wonder if...

288
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,920
I just wonder if she's fully prepared for what's going on today.

289
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,140
It looks like she's still napping.

290
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,240
Doesn't matter where or when he's competing...

291
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,060
Well, hopefully she starts with rest holds to start the match.

292
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,280
And maybe they'll wake up from there.

293
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,300
Oh yeah.

294
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,560
That's a little insider baseball for you guys in the chat.

295
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,120
That's for all the smarks in the audience.

296
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,840
All the smart marks.

297
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,540
And her teammate...

298
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,620
coming in...

299
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,100
she's not just a wailing gotcha girl.

300
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,760
She's...

301
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,100
It's...

302
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,220
Shyalily.

303
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,080
Alright, from the bedroom to the pool house.

304
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,320
Maybe they were sleeping in the same place.

305
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,280
Maybe they were sleeping in the pool house.

306
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,260
Either way, Shyalily...

307
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,040
Womp womp indeed, ladies and gentlemen.

308
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,800
I have seen how she has destroyed a pineapple.

309
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,860
This person can destroy the competition.

310
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,060
The crowd is whomping.

311
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,000
What did she destroy the pineapple with?

312
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,960
You know what?

313
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,340
It's best left unsaid.

314
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,740
Interesting.

315
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,240
Interesting.

316
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,640
And the crowd is whomping.

317
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,420
Don't you see the whompage happening in the audience?

318
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,460
You can hear them whomping.

319
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,160
Whomplamania.

320
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,220
Whomplamania is running wild.

321
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,900
Whomp!

322
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,240
Whomp!

323
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,440
Whomp!

324
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,980
Whomp!

325
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,880
Whomp!

326
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,440
Whomp!

327
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,660
Look at the eyes.

328
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,600
The eyes tell a story.

329
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,340
The eyes don't lie and the eyes spell disaster tonight at Sacrifice.

330
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,340
The apex mammal of our species.

331
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,980
And their opponents are in for a whale of a time.

332
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,590
That's pretty good, Taka.

333
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,390
Thank you.

334
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:09,790
Thank you.

335
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,690
You should get a raise.

336
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,490
You know what?

337
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,290
You know what?

338
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,170
Maybe.

339
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,930
Maybe if you're good.

340
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,450
Speaking of good, this match is brought to you by Gamersups, everybody.

341
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,370
Thank you.

342
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,630
For all of you attending this wonderful event.

343
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,450
And let's get this thing started with some tag team action.

344
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,590
Let's get it on!

345
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,470
Oh, it's a tornado tag.

346
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,510
Look at the size of Buff Pup.

347
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,090
Now, Taka, I'm a bit of a tag team aficionado myself.

348
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,790
I'm undefeated on the independence.

349
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,590
Champion in multiple countries.

350
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:49,150
So if you have any questions for how to win a tornado tag team match, feel free to ask me.

351
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,090
Okay.

352
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,810
So as a whomp...

353
00:20:51,810 --> 00:21:00,770
So now, if you're the biggest person in the tag match like Buff Pup is, how do you avoid getting targeted by the wily, small, tiny ones?

354
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,750
Just like that.

355
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,270
You do a thes press and you beat the pulp out of the face, Taka.

356
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,230
If you stay off the ground, they can't put you on the ground.

357
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,270
And look at that!

358
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,630
Whoa!

359
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,450
Look at that!

360
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,350
She just sat on her!

361
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,550
That cake-based offense.

362
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,130
Now, Mary just grabbed a sledgehammer from underneath the ring.

363
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,690
Now, this is an Extreme Rules tornado tag match.

364
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,230
And this is essentially a complete anarchy already.

365
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,410
Shia Lili's got a steel chair!

366
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,350
She got a steel chair!

367
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,110
Anything goes!

368
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,130
Narrowly avoiding the chair.

369
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,450
Buff Pup avoiding the damage, locking up with Shia Lili yet again.

370
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,170
And Shia Lili decides to walk the dog to the ropes.

371
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,810
Oh, if you put the dog on the leash, they're not gonna like that very much, Taka.

372
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,430
Oh, and just kneeling!

373
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,330
Lucy!

374
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,930
Oh, and that's exactly what you need to do against a larger opponent, Taka.

375
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,550
You gotta chop the tree down.

376
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,890
Break down the legs.

377
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,470
And make sure they have nothing to walk on.

378
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,470
Corkscrew leg dri- corkscrewing them!

379
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,370
Oh, picking apart all the limbs.

380
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,830
Oh, a pin attempt is being made!

381
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,370
That's not just a pin, that's a sexy pin.

382
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,190
Sidewalk slam maybe?

383
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:09,650
Yes!

384
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,070
Oh, I believe they call that deep pin attration.

385
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,710
It rhymes with attrition.

386
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,050
Makes me wanna get back in the ring, Taka.

387
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,270
It does.

388
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,410
I mean, you gotta be feeling enamored by these superstars.

389
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,290
In the ring, Buff Pup laying in an absolute clinic!

390
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,310
Oh, now the numbers game.

391
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,610
Now you've fought many different tag teams.

392
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,070
How would you handle someone with the size and buffness of Buff Pup?

393
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,050
Well, honestly, Taka, I've never been in the ring with somebody bigger than me.

394
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,810
I'm approximately 9 feet tall and 800 pounds.

395
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,050
But, there was somebody who was...

396
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,730
Oh my god!

397
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,830
What a sledgehammer throw!

398
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,530
They threw a sledgehammer at Lucy Pyre's head!

399
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,870
Absolutely no regard for human society and wellness.

400
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,150
Well-being.

401
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,810
They say dog is man's best friend, but they can also be your worst enemy if you cross him.

402
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,610
Oh, lookit, that's Chekov's table right there.

403
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,570
Somebody's gotta go through it by the end of the match.

404
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,890
Otherwise, everybody's going to be disappointed.

405
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,270
One armed...

406
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,630
Press!

407
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,310
That's the size advantage there, Taka.

408
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,050
Oh, and a knuckle shuffle!

409
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,750
That wasn't all five.

410
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,730
That was just four knuckles.

411
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,730
We see Mary going again for another item.

412
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,530
Pulling in a trash can!

413
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,930
About to take out the trash!

414
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,110
Somebody says, you know Waifu is trash.

415
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,970
Mary saying that Lucy Pyre belongs to the trash.

416
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,070
Oh, what a beautiful move by Buff Puff there.

417
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,530
It looks to me like the dogs are in control.

418
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,290
The dog... and now going for a sneaky pin here.

419
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,710
Like, hold on!

420
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,350
Kick out at one, but we got a table!

421
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,850
We have a table at play!

422
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,490
The crowd is going wild.

423
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,650
They're saying, tables, tables, tables!

424
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,990
Oh, nice!

425
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,790
This is hard to even call.

426
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,450
Now it looks like the team of Shia Lillie and Lucy have managed to start matching up with the dogs a little bit more.

427
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,370
Now trying to keep pace.

428
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,430
Lucy grabbing the garbage can she was placed in.

429
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,290
Oh!

430
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,830
I thought we were going to see a double team on the outside.

431
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,390
Perhaps being sandwiched between the trash can and two dogs.

432
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,450
Oh!

433
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,150
Shia Lillie throwing... but...

434
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,250
Oh!

435
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,750
What a rolling damage there to Buff Puff who was slammed into the grate.

436
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,510
As Mary is picking apart.

437
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,750
Lucy Pyre on the other side.

438
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,870
The dogs are firmly in control here tonight, Taka.

439
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,350
The dogs are barking!

440
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,510
And that's not just from the audience, folks.

441
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,300
The dogs are getting overly worked out.

442
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,320
They can tire themselves out without even realizing it.

443
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
And that's the challenge.

444
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,540
Can their singular...

445
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,820
Oh!

446
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,180
Just threw that in the back of Shia Lillie's head!

447
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,100
Unbelievable!

448
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,480
Now Taka, that's actually a great point.

449
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,220
Could the dogs have started off really hot and maybe tuckered themselves out before the match is over?

450
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,040
Is this a game of attrition?

451
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,480
It really depends.

452
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,340
Are they in the small dog park or the big dog park?

453
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,740
Well, I see a couple of big dogs and a couple of people in the audience are chanting for the big dogs.

454
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,240
But I guess we'll find out who, when they win tonight.

455
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,780
Lucy being double teamed by Mary and Buk Buk Buk Buk striking a pose.

456
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,740
Taunting.

457
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,180
Arrogance.

458
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,520
We'll have to see if that comes back to bite them.

459
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,540
But Lucy grabbing an item from under the ring.

460
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,140
Well, Lucy grabs it from under the ring, but no!

461
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,100
Buk Buk's gonna... Oh!

462
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,780
Beautiful!

463
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,120
Oh.

464
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,960
Turning neck breaker into even more offense.

465
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,460
Shia Lillie taunting the opponents to get into the ring.

466
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,300
What is this?

467
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,360
What is Shia Lillie going for here?

468
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,740
And that's a beautiful back body drop!

469
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,400
Lucy's on fire!

470
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,640
Will that be enough for Buk Buk Buk?

471
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,920
Break up by Shia Lillie.

472
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,060
This is the danger of a tornado match.

473
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,440
Oh!

474
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,560
A big dog punch!

475
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,400
Blood.

476
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:09,840
Blood.

477
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,400
Kick out at two.

478
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,160
Only two.

479
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,900
That was close, Taka.

480
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,960
What is Buk Buk doing?

481
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,160
That's 500 pounds of... Oh, never mind.

482
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,300
We're good.

483
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,620
No, that's smart.

484
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,900
He's too big to go up there.

485
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,000
Just taking out...

486
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,040
Just taking out Shia Lillie.

487
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,360
Oh.

488
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Oh my gosh.

489
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,460
She's got a family.

490
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,560
2-on-1 beatdown.

491
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,280
Oh!

492
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,760
And Lucy takes a steel chair to the head from Mary.

493
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,720
Oh, pop up drop kick.

494
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
Well, a reverse.

495
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,700
Shia Lillie reversing it.

496
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh!

497
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,300
And a drop kick from Mary.

498
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,080
This is...

499
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,620
This is getting hard to watch, Taka.

500
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh, this is some PWG-style wrestling right now.

501
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,480
Oh my god!

502
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Buk Buk with the sledgehammer!

503
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,400
Haunting the opponents.

504
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,460
They've been pretty cocky since the start of this match.

505
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:07,740
Oh!

506
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,380
Hitting Mary!

507
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,140
Buk Buk just hit Mary in the back of the head!

508
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,820
Couldn't take advantage.

509
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,120
She couldn't take advantage of the miscommunication and they are back on the same page.

510
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,140
The dogs are in sync.

511
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,760
Silently thrown away.

512
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,380
Lucy Pyre grabbing hold of Mary, throwing Mary back in the ring.

513
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,140
Pinfalls have to occur inside the ring to my knowledge.

514
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,100
And Lucy...

515
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,560
That's very true.

516
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,160
Oh!

517
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,520
Pulling Buk Buk...

518
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,720
What's this?

519
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,600
Oh!

520
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,340
My goodness!

521
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,200
Tope!

522
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,800
Tope Shua Shida!

523
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,340
Mama mia!

524
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,720
Buk Buk is... What is Buk Buk thinking right now?

525
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,380
Oh!

526
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Into the steps!

527
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,340
Oh, gosh.

528
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,120
Somebody's got to go through that table, Taka.

529
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,440
Bad booking.

530
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,020
Someone has to.

531
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,200
We have three tables at play right now and...

532
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,580
Oh!

533
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,720
Back in the...

534
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,040
Back in the head!

535
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,860
But it's not in the ring.

536
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,800
It's not in the ring.

537
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,420
Oh!

538
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Mary had the kendo stick knocked out of their hand.

539
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,840
Buk Buk is observing.

540
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,140
This is their chance.

541
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,200
This is their chance.

542
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,020
This could be it.

543
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,260
He's woofin' up.

544
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,820
And now the teams are... Now they're both targeting.

545
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,900
They're going after Lucy again!

546
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,540
And there... It's that pack-a-dog mentality, Taka.

547
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,620
Never mind.

548
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,080
Mary has decided to switch up and go after Shia...

549
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,320
Oh!

550
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,740
Miss!

551
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,660
Did they hit?

552
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:36,960
Oh, no.

553
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,360
They did hit.

554
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,020
Wow.

555
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,780
It's really not... It's really not safe to be throwing these weapons around.

556
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,580
Don't throw kendo sticks!

557
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,300
It's not a... Oh!

558
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,280
Blood on the outside!

559
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,100
Buk

560
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,460
Buk is taking apart Lucy.

561
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,920
And Shia Lily makes Mary pay for it on the outside.

562
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,240
In all my years, I don't think I've ever seen a match this brutal.

563
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,340
What is... What is Buk Buk doing on the outside?

564
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,880
On the outside!

565
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,140
That's the hardest part of the ground, Taka!

566
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,540
Back of the... Back of the head!

567
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,360
Whoa!

568
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,280
Oh, my God!

569
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,520
Mary almost tapped out!

570
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,180
Mary almost tapped out there for a second!

571
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,500
This could be it.

572
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,040
This could be it.

573
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,980
Oh, now she's bleeding too.

574
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,100
Mary going for a pin.

575
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,560
Is that it?

576
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,800
One... Two...

577
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,780
Oh, that's it!

578
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,300
She was so close!

579
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,360
Last second!

580
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,300
Your winners...

581
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,460
Give a good ol' bark...

582
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,600
For the dogs...

583
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,240
Meriwether...

584
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,280
And Bufpo!

585
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,680
Not only did they have those dogs in them, those dogs won.

586
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,620
Now their opponents have their dog in them too.

587
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,600
Man's best friend... Man's worst enemy.

588
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,480
Taka, what do you think... What did you expect going into that match?

589
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,560
Did you expect that outcome?

590
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,640
I actually expected Shia Lili to be bigger than Buf Pop.

591
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,760
Whales are very big.

592
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,340
Yeah, yeah, they start off pretty big, but big dogs stand on top.

593
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,780
That's true.

594
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,360
That's true.

595
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,020
We're also on land, so...

596
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,480
Wow.

597
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,880
Physical position.

598
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,220
Wow.

599
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,600
What a show!

600
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,460
I can't believe...

601
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,560
The Double Ds, they won?

602
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,700
What...

603
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,680
I need to ask, I must ask the two cute girls.

604
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,720
How did it feel having a very buff big dog come at you with a sledgehammer?

605
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,880
I would be shitting my pants if I was in your position.

606
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,160
I need to see her after that.

607
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,840
Why was she so big?

608
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
Why did she... Oh my god!

609
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,640
Why was she...

610
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,200
Where the...

611
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,400
Is that as good for you as it was for me, Pop?

612
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,800
Honestly, I was scared.

613
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,200
There was one point where I thought I was going to get like 18 plus and I was really nervous.

614
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,080
I was like...

615
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,980
Oh my god, I feel so bad.

616
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,620
I literally was like bashing everyone's head with a sledgehammer.

617
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,960
I don't know what the heck came over me.

618
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,060
I need a rabies vaccine after.

619
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,460
Well, yeah, we both get exposed to something.

620
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,460
It seems to be the we...

621
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,320
We have to call 911 again.

622
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,460
911, please.

623
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,720
Please.

624
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,420
Well, for the Double D team...

625
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,760
Round two?

626
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,700
Round two?

627
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:39,740
Round...

628
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,820
No, it's either, bro.

629
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,120
We'll do round two next weekend.

630
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,320
Okay, okay.

631
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,620
Am I okay?

632
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,020
Okay.

633
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,340
Well...

634
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,960
Well, does the Double T have any...

635
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,140
I think he needs to be put down.

636
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,000
I think he needs to be put down.

637
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,820
I think he needs to be put down.

638
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,320
I need backup.

639
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,000
Please.

640
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,560
Please.

641
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,020
Please.

642
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,660
Patrick, what I have...

643
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,100
Help.

644
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,420
Help.

645
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,740
I need...

646
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:03,940
Hello?

647
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Cut the cameras.

648
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,000
I need help.

649
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,580
Help.

650
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,180
Please.

651
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,080
Don't worry about it.

652
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,580
Just...

653
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,380
It's the rabies.

654
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,420
It's the rabies?

655
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,020
It's okay.

656
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,400
Okay.

657
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,460
That dog needs to be neutered.

658
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,120
It's okay.

659
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm my dog alone.

660
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,580
He's fine.

661
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,120
He's fine.

662
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,900
He's just excited.

663
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,080
Don't worry.

664
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,120
Buff got this.

665
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,500
Don't worry.

666
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,100
She got it under control.

667
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,860
Don't worry about it.

668
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,200
You saw in the match.

669
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,540
She had to like put him in place as well in the match.

670
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:30,960
I did.

671
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,440
I hit him in the back of the head with a sledgehammer.

672
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,920
She had no friends.

673
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,800
Only in the football match.

674
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,080
That was my warning shot.

675
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,580
I love wrestling.

676
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,720
I love it.

677
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,820
Just give him a second in the crate.

678
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,980
He'll be all right after.

679
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,340
In the crate?

680
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,740
All right.

681
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,120
I understand.

682
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,460
He just...

683
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,300
He still needs crate training.

684
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,900
He's just a puppy.

685
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
He needs to be trained and leashed.

686
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:51,820
Well...

687
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,540
Well, do...

688
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,920
Thank you so much for the show match.

689
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,000
Do any of you guys have any words for the upcoming matches?

690
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,520
Like any match that you're going to be playing?

691
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,860
I think I'm going to be playing the motivational speeches that you could possibly give them.

692
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,580
I better see some bloodshed.

693
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,420
I better see some double D action out there.

694
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:06,720
Okay.

695
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,460
I want to see some flinging, some flying, some barking even.

696
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,100
Maybe some sweat.

697
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,780
Some spitting.

698
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,300
I need sweat and blood and sweat and sweat.

699
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,060
And I hope it gets sweaty.

700
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,140
I think we're getting a preview for next week's meet up.

701
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,840
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us for our show match.

702
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,500
Show match.

703
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,640
Where, next week?

704
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,260
I am so sorry.

705
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,020
I'm okay.

706
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,400
It was a pleasure having you guys here, I hope...

707
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,940
Thank you for shutdown me.

708
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,300
I hope all of you guys get baby shock.

709
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,640
I'm going to get through.

710
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,600
Oh, god.

711
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,480
We got them.

712
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,620
We delete us every week.

713
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,760
They've got too much of that dog in them, Dick Inky.

714
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,640
I will say that.

715
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,040
Somebody call Animal Control, because that animal is out of control.

716
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,340
Absolutely.

717
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,860
Thank you, guys!

718
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,060
Thank you for being the guest caster for this show.

719
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,520
And this is the show match!

720
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,500
I guess this is behind the scenes Doki here.

721
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,780
We're gonna be going back to the main stage everybody.

722
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:17,560
But let's say a huge thank you to everybody here for the show matches and the winners of the show match, the dogs.

723
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,300
I was very surprised they beat the anime girls.

724
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,780
But I guess...

725
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,500
I was the dog.

726
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,160
Every dog has its day!

727
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,960
Some of the girls might need some rabies shots later.

728
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,620
Anyway, say thank you to all the people there.

729
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,760
We're gonna go back to the main stage to get ready for the tournament.

730
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,660
Thank you!

731
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,720
Thank you!

732
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,020
Thank you!

733
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,860
Bye bye guys!

734
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,490
Oh, wow I forgot to take the belt off.

735
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,330
Hey!

736
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,850
Like I said, thank you to the people at the show match.

737
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,510
That was fucking extraordinary.

738
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,890
It was like a last minute change.

739
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,790
I know originally it was like a tornado tag.

740
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,430
But then I decided to change it to extreme because I was like...

741
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:06,970
Whoa!

742
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,270
They can like throw hammers?

743
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,490
So I had to include it.

744
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,570
Again a huge shout out to our guest casters.

745
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,710
Give me a sec.

746
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,330
I want to be sure if...

747
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,510
Snuffy and Fillion are ready to cast the beginning of the tournament.

748
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,170
So give me a sec.

749
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,810
I'm going to check as I cue them in.

750
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,090
Guys, one man army here.

751
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,970
If they're not ready, we will have a little change of casters.

752
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,450
We might have Kai and Octavio to start us off.

753
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,890
So just give me a sec as I check it out here.

754
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:56,790
But for those who are waiting, for those who are waning, the first match is not this one.

755
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,230
That is not the first match.

756
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,090
The first match was technically Fuyo versus Snuffy.

757
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,570
But at the moment, I am not sure if Snuffy is in the ring at the moment.

758
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,410
So if we do not have...

759
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:23,530
If Snuffy is not here yet, we might have Octavio and Kai come over to do bracket 2, I believe.

760
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,910
To do bracket 2.

761
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,190
For Araka and Luto.

762
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:34,170
So for now, at the moment, I don't believe Snuffy is in the stadium at the moment.

763
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,210
So we are going to have a little, slight change of the casters.

764
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:47,330
And we are going to have Kai and Octavio to come in to cast for Luto and Sayu.

765
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,170
So give me a sec everybody.

766
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,830
As I ping, let them know.

767
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,010
Um...

768
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,250
Oh, they should know.

769
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,070
They are in this call.

770
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,490
Kai and Octavio, are you guys ready to cast the first match?

771
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,030
Kai and Octavio.

772
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,810
Pinging Kai and Octavio.

773
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,890
You guys can talk.

774
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,830
Oh, we can talk?

775
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,130
Okay.

776
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,050
Yeah, we can talk.

777
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,930
You guys can talk in the headset to let me know.

778
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,690
I'm just sending emojis.

779
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,270
What is this?

780
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,770
It's like...

781
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,350
I was like...

782
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,170
We are here.

783
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,750
You guys are here.

784
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,310
That is good to know.

785
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,390
I was a little worried when I didn't get any response.

786
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,270
No one's here for some reason.

787
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,970
We were in the break room.

788
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,690
Yeah, yeah.

789
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:52,030
When we were pinging them from the break room, I had to be sure they were here and ready to cast before I rotate them in.

790
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,350
But yes, thank you again to Kai for substituting for me.

791
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,650
And thank you to Gerard for the interview.

792
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,810
Are you guys ready to cast for your first match?

793
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,650
Do you guys remember what your first match is?

794
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:02,970
Yes!

795
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,910
Who are they?

796
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,950
Before I send you over to the interview table.

797
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,850
Um...

798
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,490
Oh, shit.

799
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,090
Who are they?

800
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,410
Yeah!

801
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,570
Sending you over to the interview stage.

802
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,170
I hope you guys are already sitting down, guys.

803
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,990
Oh, yeah.

804
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,350
I'm running.

805
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,390
Whoa!

806
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:24,790
Oh, shit!

807
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,990
Sorry, I just...

808
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,630
You're gigantic!

809
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,790
I'm sorry.

810
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,110
It's all gas in there.

811
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,570
There's nothing.

812
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,070
It's empty.

813
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,530
Hello, hello!

814
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,430
Sorry, I'm trying to peer over the desk.

815
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,490
There we go.

816
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,950
There we go.

817
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,110
Hi, everyone!

818
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,910
And welcome to Day 2.

819
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,250
There's been some really, really exciting matches.

820
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,990
And I hope you guys are ready for the...

821
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,190
Fucking shit.

822
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,330
That's about to go down today.

823
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,450
How are you feeling, Octavio?

824
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,310
I'm feeling great.

825
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:59,610
And, you know, we are a follow-up to the awesome Taka and Jibo earlier.

826
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,670
They have actual WWE experience.

827
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,610
We do have actual WWE experience, too.

828
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,610
Yesterday.

829
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,470
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, for sure.

830
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:08,830
Yesterday.

831
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,250
Yeah.

832
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,930
And then I lost.

833
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,770
And then... That counts, though, right?

834
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,290
That counts.

835
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,070
For sure.

836
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,070
I won, then I lost.

837
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,490
So we're both losers here.

838
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,610
And I think that's great.

839
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,310
We're the perfect people.

840
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,190
Yeah, no, it's great, you know.

841
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,090
It'll bring, like, a good perspective, I think.

842
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,570
Alright?

843
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,370
Mm-hmm.

844
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,290
Absolutely.

845
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:32,070
From the perspective of those who who will never make it in the WWE.

846
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,510
Okay, just how sad would you put it?

847
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,850
Just how sad!

848
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,970
Alright.

849
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,430
Alright.

850
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,730
But hello, everybody.

851
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,310
Yeah.

852
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,870
Where are our wrestlers?

853
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,070
Are they here?

854
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,010
We are currently waiting for them to come from the back.

855
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:47,250
Whoa!

856
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,250
Oh, they're coming!

857
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,170
They're coming!

858
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,630
They sure are coming!

859
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,950
Oh my god!

860
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,890
We're waiting for them to become smaller!

861
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,550
I'm sorry.

862
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,610
I guess red people today just have really big heads.

863
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:00,950
I don't know.

864
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,910
It's just how it is.

865
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,110
What's up with that?

866
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,510
I don't know.

867
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,150
I don't know.

868
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:05,890
Strangely.

869
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,310
But... Buta?

870
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,430
Excuse me?

871
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,630
Excuse me?

872
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:09,790
What?

873
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,370
Don't make me jump over this table.

874
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,330
I will fight you right now.

875
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,670
Okay.

876
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,290
Short bitch.

877
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:16,450
Professional.

878
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,470
Anyways.

879
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,390
Damn.

880
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,170
Who's fighting here?

881
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,210
I'm not quite sure.

882
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,310
Listen.

883
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,570
It should be me in the ring.

884
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,070
It should be me.

885
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,450
But it's okay.

886
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,110
I'll be professional.

887
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:25,690
It's fine.

888
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:26,710
It's fine.

889
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,310
We'll lock in.

890
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:27,870
We'll lock in.

891
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,270
Whoa.

892
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:29,930
We not...

893
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,150
I'm waiting for a response.

894
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:34,370
Are they here?

895
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:34,670
Oh wait.

896
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,230
True.

897
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,650
I think Luto might still be in the break room.

898
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,050
Maybe having some cheese and crackers.

899
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,390
Who knows?

900
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:42,930
But...

901
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,110
Honestly though.

902
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,010
Honestly.

903
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,550
While we wait.

904
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,290
I just want to say.

905
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,250
I am very excited to be substituted in.

906
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,970
I saw that we were missing a red reptile.

907
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,350
And I was like.

908
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:53,670
Oh shit.

909
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:53,970
Wait.

910
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,270
I'm also a red reptile.

911
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:55,930
This will work.

912
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:57,810
Yeah.

913
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,790
The other reptile.

914
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,510
Extinct already.

915
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,190
So that's fine.

916
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,730
It's over.

917
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,710
It's the age of the dragon now.

918
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,270
Yeah.

919
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:05,990
Yeah.

920
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:06,410
Fuck that.

921
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,310
This is better.

922
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,650
This is way better.

923
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,030
You think so?

924
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,030
Yeah.

925
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,450
Definitely.

926
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,050
You know what?

927
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,850
Here's the thing.

928
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,250
Yesterday I was beaten by a dragon.

929
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:16,770
I mean.

930
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,870
I beat a dragon.

931
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,830
Oh really?

932
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,830
And now I'm casting with a dragon.

933
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,990
So I think that's character development for me.

934
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,670
Yeah.

935
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,050
True.

936
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:24,370
True.

937
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:24,590
True.

938
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,890
Although I think you're crazy.

939
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,530
Because I don't think you'd beat a dragon.

940
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:28,890
But anyway.

941
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,410
That's crazy.

942
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,130
That's just like my opinion.

943
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,390
That's the way I want to see things.

944
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,090
You can't beat a dragon.

945
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,530
But you know.

946
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:33,790
It's fine.

947
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,170
You know.

948
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,130
If you want to lie like that.

949
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:35,750
That's cool.

950
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,090
Fair and square fight.

951
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:37,910
No.

952
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,530
I didn't see nothing.

953
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,510
I didn't see nothing.

954
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,390
No.

955
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,070
I didn't see nothing.

956
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,610
Well I saw your fight.

957
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,070
No you didn't.

958
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,510
And you got beaten.

959
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,770
Within like three minutes.

960
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,830
I don't think you saw anything.

961
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,650
And I think you're crazy.

962
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,710
And I think you're strange for saying that actually.

963
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,250
Excuse me.

964
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,290
You had the biggest trash talk in the beginning too.

965
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,630
You were like.

966
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,410
I'm going to split this lime into two.

967
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,830
And squirt it into your eyes.

968
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,650
Oh my god.

969
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,350
You did watch.

970
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,650
Okay.

971
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:03,930
Down.

972
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,030
Down.

973
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,130
Down.

974
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:04,530
That's embarrassing.

975
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,030
Okay.

976
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,530
Down.

977
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:05,770
Down.

978
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,570
I would have rather you not perceive me.

979
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:07,730
Alright.

980
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,750
No.

981
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,070
Okay.

982
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:10,570
Listen.

983
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,170
I needed to at least like.

984
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,090
I'm a firm believer in like manifestation.

985
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,750
Alright.

986
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,790
If you want something to happen.

987
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:16,470
You gotta believe.

988
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,850
It's gonna happen.

989
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,250
Alright.

990
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:18,690
So I'm like.

991
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,010
You know what.

992
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,290
I'm gonna.

993
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,070
Hell yeah.

994
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,150
I'm gonna beat her fucking ass.

995
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,570
Hell yeah.

996
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,230
I'm gonna fucking win.

997
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:22,750
But you know what.

998
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,470
Sometimes it just.

999
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,670
That's a lot of talk coming from down here.

1000
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,650
It doesn't turn out that way sometimes.

1001
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,630
The losers bracket casting.

1002
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,330
But trust me.

1003
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,310
If it was me and June on the ring.

1004
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,430
I would have won.

1005
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,070
I would have won.

1006
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,530
No.

1007
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,090
No.

1008
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,010
We already know.

1009
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,510
It was just a bad moment.

1010
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,030
I would not chip on my end.

1011
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,110
We've already met up and we talked about this.

1012
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:41,890
No.

1013
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,090
I'm sorry.

1014
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,010
I'm sorry.

1015
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:44,550
No.

1016
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:45,730
Again.

1017
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,370
I'm manifesting.

1018
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,910
I would literally be.

1019
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,150
Stop calling me puta.

1020
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,050
You fucking puta.

1021
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,070
I literally beat you.

1022
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,630
I think we need a show match.

1023
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,670
Do you see.

1024
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,250
Do you see what I have to put up with?

1025
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,650
We are getting some response from Luto Real.

1026
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,670
Not Clickbait.

1027
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,070
She's on her way.

1028
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,710
She's on her way.

1029
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,250
She's just grabbing some snacks.

1030
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,230
And there she is.

1031
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:09,610
Sayu.

1032
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,350
Luto.

1033
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,110
Are you here?

1034
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,170
So that's what my opponent sounds like?

1035
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:16,910
Yep.

1036
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,110
This is definitely Luto.

1037
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,990
Damn.

1038
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,110
Are you in today, Sayu?

1039
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:24,570
Yes.

1040
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,990
I'm excited to be here.

1041
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,110
It'll be my debut as a wrestler.

1042
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,710
It's gonna be great.

1043
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,450
It's gonna be great.

1044
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:33,890
Raiden, Luto.

1045
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:38,690
How will you defeat someone that's, you know, four or three times your size?

1046
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,570
With my Australian powers.

1047
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,450
And demon powers.

1048
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,530
Demon powers?

1049
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,770
Australian demon powers.

1050
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,510
Yes, because all demons come from Australia.

1051
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,150
This is true.

1052
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,190
Oh shit.

1053
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:57,650
Exactly.

1054
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,110
Kangaroos are fucking terrified.

1055
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,690
They're weird.

1056
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,050
Yeah, kangaroos and koalas.

1057
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,310
They're like demonic.

1058
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,790
They're scary.

1059
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,490
They shouldn't exist.

1060
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,470
I'm very excited to see how this will end up.

1061
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,210
An Australian versus an American?

1062
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:15,970
The AA?

1063
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,830
Yeah, sure, sure.

1064
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,270
I don't know.

1065
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,250
I'm unsure.

1066
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,170
I'm so sorry.

1067
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,030
You're okay.

1068
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,750
It's my first day on the job.

1069
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,430
I am gonna win.

1070
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,850
Where's this shit talking?

1071
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,430
You're not gonna win.

1072
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,530
You're just a little robo boy.

1073
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,870
Can't handle all this...

1074
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:39,490
kangaroo.

1075
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,050
And you're a son of a bitch who's gonna die.

1076
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:43,750
What?

1077
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,390
Yeah, tell them all.

1078
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,290
Well...

1079
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,750
Yeah, tell them all.

1080
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,450
Yeah, well, for real.

1081
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,170
I'm intimidated.

1082
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:53,930
I think they're ready.

1083
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:55,970
I'm feeling the energy.

1084
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:56,870
I'm feeling the tension.

1085
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,350
It's actually kind of scary.

1086
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,790
What the heck?

1087
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:59,790
Yeah, I'm scared.

1088
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:00,790
You shake it, I'm shaking.

1089
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,930
I'm gonna bring my kangaroo.

1090
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,270
I'm gonna bring my kangaroo.

1091
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,510
You're gonna bring a kangaroo?

1092
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,070
I'll bring out two kangaroos.

1093
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,950
I'll bring out two kangaroos.

1094
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,290
I'll bring out my computer to smack the shit out of you with.

1095
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,710
I'll bring...

1096
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,250
even more computers.

1097
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,110
I'm sorry.

1098
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,250
I am not sorry.

1099
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,430
That's not your seagull laugh.

1100
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:30,930
I'm just like...

1101
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,190
What is going on?

1102
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:36,190
Damn.

1103
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,950
Well, I think they're ready to go into the ring.

1104
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,650
Yeah, they could take you to the ring.

1105
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,890
I wanna see how this goes there.

1106
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,330
The Australian and the American.

1107
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,990
Oh, jeez, I gotta look over the table again.

1108
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:48,430
I'm sorry.

1109
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,250
I'm too short.

1110
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,150
I'm too short.

1111
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,570
I'm sorry.

1112
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,050
Okay, there we go.

1113
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,250
They got the step stool.

1114
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:55,670
Thank you.

1115
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:56,630
Thank you.

1116
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,610
Alright, who do you think's gonna win?

1117
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,150
I'm actually...

1118
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:01,550
That's scary.

1119
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,590
That's actually demonic.

1120
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,750
Look at Luto there.

1121
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,250
Yeah, Luto's actually got... I'm terrified.

1122
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:12,270
Honestly, my money was on Sayu, but after hearing that kangaroo stuff, I don't know.

1123
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,150
I'm scared.

1124
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:13,810
True, true.

1125
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,310
And honestly, Sayu just looks like a guy.

1126
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,890
Yeah, bro's just a dude.

1127
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,810
Like, it's like...

1128
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:25,090
One little guy against a fucking demon from Australia.

1129
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:25,730
I'm sorry.

1130
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,230
True.

1131
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,130
I wouldn't be scared.

1132
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,750
Just look at that hair, that mustache, those horns.

1133
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,110
Ah, Dan's too intimidating.

1134
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,550
Here we go.

1135
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,690
In this corner...

1136
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:42,610
We have...

1137
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,510
The handsomest tech support around...

1138
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,810
Totally not biased.

1139
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,230
It's...

1140
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,350
Sayu!

1141
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,230
Definitely not biased.

1142
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,510
Let's fucking go!

1143
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:56,890
Yeah!

1144
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,710
He's announcing himself.

1145
00:46:59,230 --> 00:46:59,710
Wow.

1146
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,510
That's kinda... That's kinda a new look.

1147
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,090
If you think about it.

1148
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,350
Hey, shush!

1149
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,750
It's just you telling me, shush!

1150
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,570
I do love how he's staying on brand.

1151
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,050
Like, on board, right foot forward as well.

1152
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:14,430
Look at this.

1153
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:16,810
Oh.

1154
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,770
He's figuring it out.

1155
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:20,850
He's figuring it out.

1156
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,330
Oh, there he goes.

1157
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,270
Into the ring he rolls, and alright.

1158
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,030
A competitor who always has his...

1159
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,470
It's funny because he's just tech support.

1160
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,470
Ready for a major battle.

1161
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,270
And he's doing this.

1162
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,330
Honestly, I get surprised at how well you customize these.

1163
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:36,810
Holy fuck.

1164
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,410
And now...

1165
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:43,530
Coming to the stage...

1166
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,250
After grabbing...

1167
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:49,210
Oh.

1168
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,810
Okay.

1169
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,560
The suspense!

1170
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,740
It's Ludo!

1171
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:00,980
It's Ludo!

1172
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:02,860
It's Ludo!

1173
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,660
Eh, Yasqueen!

1174
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,620
Look at that slay!

1175
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,520
Let's fucking go!

1176
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,220
I didn't expect this very bright outfit.

1177
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,940
Bright pink, blue and yellow.

1178
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,920
Bright is the way to go though.

1179
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,600
It makes you look flashy, alright.

1180
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,440
You get extra style points.

1181
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,020
I love the holographic horns too.

1182
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,540
It's a vibe.

1183
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:21,980
It's a vibe.

1184
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,740
It's her world and we're just living in it.

1185
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,020
Really.

1186
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,820
Her weird Australian little world.

1187
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,540
Actually, wait.

1188
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:29,940
I can't remember.

1189
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,220
You got that headphone thing.

1190
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,860
You know how the skull gets compressed because of you wearing headphones?

1191
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,140
He has that.

1192
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,140
Look at him.

1193
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:41,720
Oh no!

1194
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,140
Don't do him like that!

1195
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,680
Don't do him like that!

1196
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:47,920
Damn!

1197
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,080
A little shimmy?

1198
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,740
Alright, alright.

1199
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,640
I see you, I see you.

1200
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,780
Luto knows how to work the crowd.

1201
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,500
Yeah!

1202
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,000
Look at that.

1203
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,980
Oh my god, wait.

1204
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,080
I just realized that's a diaper.

1205
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,080
What the fuck did that not promise?

1206
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,100
That's a fucking diaper!

1207
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,020
I guess demons need diapers.

1208
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,240
True.

1209
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,700
Never thought about that.

1210
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,800
Bro, I can hear myself.

1211
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,220
There we go.

1212
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,540
Sayu with the Goku hair.

1213
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,540
Oh my god.

1214
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,560
If Luto is smart, she'd take off the diaper and just yeet it at him as an intimidation tactic.

1215
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:21,960
Oh!

1216
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,920
Immediately with a...

1217
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,640
Oh my god!

1218
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,320
Don't tell me this big demon is a high flyer.

1219
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,220
Already starting with the freaking aerial moves.

1220
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:32,580
Yeah!

1221
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:32,960
Holy crap!

1222
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,860
Already pinned him.

1223
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,520
Oh, he keeps jumping!

1224
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,500
Oh, you broke your back!

1225
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:37,840
No!

1226
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:40,960
Oh!

1227
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,620
Focus on the arm.

1228
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,200
Yeah, clip those wings.

1229
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1230
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,700
Oh, oh, she's in pain.

1231
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,700
Oh, oh, she's gonna come back.

1232
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,160
Reversal.

1233
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,620
Missed the elbow.

1234
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,300
Ooh.

1235
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,800
Ooh, and he breaks her top one down.

1236
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:02,620
Oh no.

1237
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,940
Sayu targeting the legs here.

1238
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,840
Oh, punch her.

1239
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,380
You know Kanda Roo's have really strong punches.

1240
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,020
You know Kanda Roo's have really strong punches.

1241
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,040
I'm not sure if they're so scary.

1242
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:15,880
Woo!

1243
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,960
Nice!

1244
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,460
Look at that leap.

1245
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,080
Are you crazy?

1246
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,080
This big demon is a high flyer.

1247
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,680
Right?

1248
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,220
This fucking maneuvering.

1249
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,740
That's terrifying.

1250
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,100
Ooh, suplex by Sayu.

1251
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,160
Setting foot in the ring now.

1252
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,480
Oh, they're going back in the ring.

1253
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,980
Sayu being polite, waiting for Luto.

1254
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,480
Very nice of him.

1255
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,040
To the turnbuckle.

1256
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,360
What's going on?

1257
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,420
Oh, is she gonna jump on him?

1258
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,540
Another aerial!

1259
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,220
Oh my god!

1260
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:46,780
No!

1261
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,760
500 pounds!

1262
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,740
Jesus, his ribs are broken!

1263
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,940
On top of the tech support.

1264
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,520
I think the diaper added more pounds to it.

1265
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,680
Dude, I think so.

1266
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,320
Oh god!

1267
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,160
Oh jeez.

1268
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,360
Oh.

1269
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,880
Oh my god.

1270
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Wow, that was pretty cool.

1271
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,640
Dude.

1272
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,000
They're maneuvering so good.

1273
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,000
Holy crap!

1274
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,500
Come on Sayu, you gotta win for all tech support guys everywhere.

1275
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,480
You gotta do it!

1276
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,040
From the back!

1277
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,680
Yeah, clip those wings.

1278
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,040
Yeah!

1279
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,620
That's his favorite move.

1280
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,960
Get her out!

1281
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,460
Get her out!

1282
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,940
Oh, and a pin from Sayu.

1283
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,360
Ooh!

1284
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,580
Nah, not even a one count.

1285
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,820
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1286
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,740
Come on, you gotta step it up!

1287
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,860
I'm not feeling impressed yet.

1288
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,940
Thinks a lot of it for us.

1289
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,920
I feel like both of their endurances are really...

1290
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,540
really high.

1291
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,700
Oh, knee to the face!

1292
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,880
Dude, look at that freaking jumping around they're doing.

1293
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,180
Ooh.

1294
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,680
Oh!

1295
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,440
She keeps missing like that.

1296
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,060
Oh my god!

1297
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,300
Dude, those free aerial kicks just take me out like every time.

1298
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,200
It's so brutal.

1299
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,600
Oh, right to the gut.

1300
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,020
Are you gonna jump?

1301
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,420
Another aerial kick!

1302
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:17,700
Oh!

1303
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,820
Here we go!

1304
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,660
Oh, she gets...

1305
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,780
Oh, she gets fucking knocked down!

1306
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,440
It's punch to the back.

1307
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,400
Submission!

1308
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
True, true.

1309
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,700
That's terrible.

1310
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,840
You kinda have to wonder what the heck is in that diaper.

1311
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:40,840
That's true.

1312
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,600
It's very, very bloated.

1313
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,820
I wanna find out if I'm being honest with you.

1314
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,480
I don't wanna know.

1315
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,960
What's scary is that the tail also pops out of the diaper.

1316
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,500
So...

1317
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,860
That's already like a hole in there.

1318
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,300
Oh god.

1319
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,800
So who knows, maybe there's a...

1320
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,020
Maybe there's a signature move with the diaper.

1321
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,120
Okay.

1322
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,120
Oh!

1323
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,940
Oh no, but they got out.

1324
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,580
They're fighting it out.

1325
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:13,880
They're fighting outside.

1326
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,180
You gotta get in the ring!

1327
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,900
Oh man, Sayu's just getting carried away.

1328
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,540
What's the count for?

1329
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,380
Damn, Sayu taunting.

1330
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,100
Ooh.

1331
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,460
Doesn't care about the count.

1332
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,000
Right to the hamstrings.

1333
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,680
Oh, there we go.

1334
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,920
Alright, back in the... there they go.

1335
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,880
Luto thinking about her life choices.

1336
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,500
Taking her time.

1337
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,100
She's taking her time.

1338
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,620
She doesn't need to rush.

1339
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,380
Does she wanna move from Australia to America after this?

1340
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:41,860
Who knows?

1341
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,480
Oh my god.

1342
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,100
Oh my god, poor Luto.

1343
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,120
She's getting beat the fuck up.

1344
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:49,920
Oh my god.

1345
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,140
Yeah, being dragged on the floor.

1346
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,260
Oh, finisher!

1347
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,660
Oh!

1348
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,140
No.

1349
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,520
It's Sayu's favorite move.

1350
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,760
The clip in the wings again.

1351
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,780
Oh my god.

1352
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,060
Yeah.

1353
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,900
You know, if you really kinda think about it, it almost looks like Sayu's kinda wearing a diaper too.

1354
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,720
A little bit.

1355
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,440
Just a little bit for the back there.

1356
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,480
That's a new meta!

1357
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,520
That's a new meta for wrestling.

1358
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,240
Yeah.

1359
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,360
It works for intimidation.

1360
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,120
Yeah.

1361
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,760
Honestly though, if I saw Luto in the ring, I'd shit my pants too.

1362
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:32,940
Valid.

1363
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,180
So valid.

1364
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,820
Ooh.

1365
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,360
Oh, they're holding hands?

1366
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,340
Oh, this is...

1367
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,920
Oh, they throw them out.

1368
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,200
It was another aerial.

1369
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,820
Again!

1370
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,100
Oh no, that's scary.

1371
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,680
That's scary.

1372
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,640
Oh, you're so far away.

1373
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,180
Oh!

1374
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:49,940
Whoa!

1375
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,000
From the roof!

1376
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,800
That leap!

1377
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,660
Insane!

1378
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,180
Oh my god!

1379
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,100
Sat on Sayu's face with that dirty diaper!

1380
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,360
Oh!

1381
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,380
Not quite, not quite.

1382
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,160
Almost.

1383
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,460
Oh, rolled out of the ring.

1384
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,500
Sayu needed to escape.

1385
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,460
Not the miss.

1386
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,320
Ooh!

1387
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:16,940
Ooh!

1388
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,000
This is actually pretty...

1389
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,960
This is intense.

1390
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,760
Oh, what's he doing?

1391
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,460
He's gonna do the...

1392
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,020
He really likes the hands.

1393
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,380
Suplex!

1394
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:33,560
Oh!

1395
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,260
Is this gonna be a triple suplex?

1396
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,700
Woohoohoohoo!

1397
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,860
How is he doing that?

1398
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,340
Crazy!

1399
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,760
That demon is a thousand pounds!

1400
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,260
And he's just tech support!

1401
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,840
Oh man!

1402
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,700
Oh man!

1403
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,060
Oh man!

1404
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,080
Oh shit, come on, you gotta get up!

1405
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,940
Trying to remove, trying to decapitate the demon there.

1406
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,560
Oh!

1407
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,200
Oh!

1408
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,820
I like how they have the same color scheme.

1409
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,780
They can be on one team.

1410
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,860
That's true, they got like that hot pink going on.

1411
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,500
Yeah, yeah!

1412
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,800
Oh my god, literally?

1413
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,160
Twenty?

1414
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,720
Oh!

1415
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,880
Is Sayu gonna be counted out?

1416
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,060
No, come on!

1417
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,560
You gotta get up!

1418
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:17,980
Nine!

1419
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,060
Sayu!

1420
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,660
Not like this!

1421
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,360
Oh my god!

1422
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,480
And Luto wins!

1423
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,580
Holy shit!

1424
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,160
Luto won that!

1425
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,180
Damn!

1426
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,440
By knocking Sayu out of the ring.

1427
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,200
After she went to get some snacks.

1428
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,100
It's Luto!

1429
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:38,840
LUTOOOOOO!

1430
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,340
Woo!

1431
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,040
Holy crap!

1432
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:44,900
Dude!

1433
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,960
I thought Sayu was gonna win.

1434
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,120
Oh my god.

1435
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,480
Yeah, no, that chest is crazy.

1436
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,920
That's really big.

1437
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,400
That's what the diaper does!

1438
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,060
That's the power of the diaper!

1439
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,560
Holy shit!

1440
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,900
Yeah, it embiggens the chest.

1441
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,740
And makes everything like really, really strong.

1442
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,200
Damn!

1443
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,200
Wow.

1444
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,620
Luto!

1445
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,220
With a win!

1446
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,140
Well, congratulations, Miss Luto!

1447
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,720
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't think someone...

1448
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,200
I guess you just look really small in front of me.

1449
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,480
I don't know, you look super big in the ring!

1450
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,380
Apparently you were seven feet tall!

1451
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,480
Yeah!

1452
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,600
What do you have to say, Miss Luto?

1453
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,080
It's the diaper, man!

1454
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,620
And Sayu is standing on a stool?

1455
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,040
What are you guys talking about?

1456
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,080
I got robbed.

1457
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,120
You got robbed?

1458
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,200
Sayu, would you like to explain how did you get robbed?

1459
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,080
I think that count was a little fast.

1460
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,620
It went from eight, then nine, and then ten just came like half a second faster.

1461
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,360
I'm just saying.

1462
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,720
Also, it's my first day on the job.

1463
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:46,880
Classic.

1464
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,460
Classic rig card.

1465
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,980
Hey, you know...

1466
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,100
Yeah?

1467
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,560
Yes?

1468
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,140
Yeah.

1469
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,680
No, that's it, you know?

1470
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,440
It was right there.

1471
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,020
We don't!

1472
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,700
We don't know.

1473
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,300
Just take the L and move on, man!

1474
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:02,780
Just move on.

1475
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,520
That's for Luto.

1476
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,140
Crazy.

1477
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,640
Luto, I must...

1478
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,000
The only W is for me, the L for you, man!

1479
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,700
Luto, I must ask.

1480
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,740
I've been curious.

1481
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,020
I'm sure the audience is also very curious.

1482
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,280
What was your inspiration for your outfit?

1483
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:19,780
Oh!

1484
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,420
I'd like to know that too, actually.

1485
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,680
I wanted to be the most, like, flamboyant one.

1486
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,480
I wanted to kill you guys with how gay I am.

1487
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,180
Whoa!

1488
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,160
Oh my god!

1489
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,800
The power of...

1490
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,700
What was the power of being gay?

1491
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,040
I can't believe it.

1492
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,520
Sayu has died by gay.

1493
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,040
You know what?

1494
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,660
A way to go.

1495
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,880
Wouldn't have it any other way.

1496
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,600
Did you like my diaper?

1497
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,380
Did you like it when I sat on your face?

1498
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:48,600
Yeah!

1499
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,080
Was it warm, Sayu?

1500
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,500
No, I wasn't a fan of the diaper, but everything else was fine.

1501
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,800
Everything else was fine.

1502
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,860
The diaper, I wasn't a fan.

1503
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,940
Oh, we were fans of it, huh?

1504
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,220
Okay.

1505
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,880
We really liked the diaper.

1506
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,040
See, this is why I stick to a desk job.

1507
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,800
Oh my goodness!

1508
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,540
The match was super close.

1509
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,000
You guys went on for a while, and...

1510
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,300
I must say, I'm very proud of both of you guys.

1511
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:18,100
Even though someone may have upped their class a little bit because of a diaper.

1512
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,160
I think it was a fair fight.

1513
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:22,620
I think it was a fair fight.

1514
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:22,780
Oh man.

1515
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,820
Yeah, I think I only won because of the diaper, to be honest.

1516
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,760
Yeah, I think I only won because of the diaper, to be honest.

1517
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,540
If you really think about it, there was a pin, and that's very dangerous on the diapers.

1518
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,340
So, if anything, I'm just saying...

1519
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,100
Probably, just qualifications could be a thing.

1520
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,540
Well, actually, she should have been disqualified.

1521
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,980
Well, Sayu, your suit was made out of metal, so I don't know what you want me to do.

1522
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,960
No, it just looks that way.

1523
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,140
It just looks that way?

1524
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,200
Okay.

1525
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:46,860
What is it?

1526
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,000
It's just cloth?

1527
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,020
It's just very good material.

1528
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,640
It's just very good cashmere.

1529
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,660
I don't know what you want from me.

1530
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,260
Oh yes.

1531
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,700
The coat, man.

1532
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,320
The coat.

1533
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,980
Actually, AI0, Humanity 1.

1534
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:00,520
Humanity 1.

1535
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,820
Well, thank you so much.

1536
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:10,240
I am so grateful and honored to have witnessed this match, and I would like to thank you both for wrestling each other.

1537
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,260
Thank you.

1538
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,360
Congratulations again, Ms. Luto.

1539
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,500
Oh yeah.

1540
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,640
Let's go!

1541
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,020
What's that weird?

1542
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,440
Thank you for wrestling each other.

1543
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,640
Thank you for smashing and dashing and ball smashing.

1544
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,880
What do you want me to say?

1545
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,320
Thank you for doing it for Juna.

1546
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,420
Thank you.

1547
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,000
Yes, I love watching people fight.

1548
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,560
I love watching people fight.

1549
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,080
Thank you, Luto.

1550
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,900
Thank you.

1551
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,520
Thank you.

1552
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:30,520
Thank you.

1553
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:30,520
Thank you.

1554
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:31,840
Thank you.

1555
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:32,900
Thank you.

1556
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,500
I will sit on you with my diaper again.

1557
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,080
Thank you.

1558
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,460
Thank you, Juna.

1559
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,540
I'd rather you didn't.

1560
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,100
But thank you.

1561
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,320
Alright.

1562
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,180
Now that was all for this fight.

1563
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,480
And now we will actually be going back to the main stage.

1564
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,940
Because I believe now we will be subbing in the other casters.

1565
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,720
I think we're being kicked out for our diaper comment.

1566
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,380
I was too far.

1567
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:56,920
Okay.

1568
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,620
I'm sorry.

1569
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:57,780
Sorry.

1570
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,300
Listen.

1571
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,360
Just, I mean, Doki, if you want, you can give me another chance.

1572
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:01,960
Alright, it's fine.

1573
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,480
I promise.

1574
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,020
I promise!

1575
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,100
I promise!

1576
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:10,540
Thank you to Kai and Octavio for casting the first game!

1577
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,900
We have Snuffy and Fillion in the house now!

1578
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,380
In the stadium, in the backstage!

1579
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,780
And I'm queuing in!

1580
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,540
Can we get Snuffy and Fillion on the intercoms for us?

1581
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,320
Snuffy and Fillion, are you guys here?

1582
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:28,900
Hello?

1583
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,360
Are you guys ready?

1584
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,440
We're ready, boss.

1585
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,440
Alright, Snuffy, do you know who is next in the match?

1586
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,280
Myself.

1587
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:38,880
Yeah!

1588
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,320
Shout out to some bows, baby!

1589
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,560
And she's against Fuyo.

1590
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,060
Yes, yes.

1591
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,100
Miss Fuyo.

1592
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,360
Now, Fuyo is in the building as well.

1593
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,640
How do you feel, Snuffy?

1594
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,220
Finally.

1595
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:53,600
Finally.

1596
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:53,880
How do you feel?

1597
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,340
Finally, I get to talk to Fuyo the legend.

1598
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,420
We've been saying a couple words back and forth.

1599
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,620
Not gonna lie to you, chat.

1600
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,300
Why didn't you guys post that on Twitter?

1601
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,300
Why didn't you?

1602
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,560
I should've!

1603
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,560
You should tweet that out right now so the viewer audience will know what...

1604
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,220
Anyway, for those who don't know...

1605
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,140
Chat, you better make this pop off because it's about to age poorly in 20 minutes.

1606
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,520
Yeah, we're talking milk out here.

1607
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:23,780
I need you guys to know, Snuffy and Fuyo were like chit-talking each other in the server.

1608
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:23,860
We're talking milk out here.

1609
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:32,020
Oh, like they were making like elaborate videos and everything to each other, but they never posted it in the public.

1610
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:32,900
I had no idea.

1611
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,520
I was like, why he had to just tweet that shit out?

1612
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:37,180
It was fucking personal.

1613
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:43,680
They did like high effort video shit to each other, but it just stayed in the Discord server.

1614
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,300
I was so confused.

1615
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,640
Anyway, next matchup is with Snuffy versus Fuyo.

1616
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,680
And will be casted by Snuffy and Fuyo.

1617
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,260
Off to the interview stage.

1618
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,880
Oh, the Snuffy.

1619
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,420
I did scream a lot yesterday and now my voice is fricked today.

1620
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,020
If it cracks, then it is what it is.

1621
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,060
Also, Snuffy, did you just use Shadow Clone Jutsu on yourself?

1622
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,400
That's actually an actor I've substituted myself in for.

1623
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,060
Oh, okay.

1624
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,060
You're fighting a Leprechaun reject or what's going on here?

1625
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,680
Excuse me, that's Fuyo Man?

1626
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,840
That's Fuyo Man.

1627
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,020
Fuyo Man smash.

1628
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:40,190
Fuyo Man slaps the wrap horn.

1629
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,230
I'm so fucking dead, you guys.

1630
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:47,030
You're dead already, but you haven't even started the fight.

1631
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,030
Fuyo Man, Fuyo Man, please, mercy, mercy.

1632
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:51,510
No mercy.

1633
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,970
Oh shit.

1634
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:56,770
I didn't know it was going to be like this, dude.

1635
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:57,470
Shit talk.

1636
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:57,670
Shit talk.

1637
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,710
Yeah, I want to hear some candy versus a heart.

1638
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,250
I want to hear some candy versus a heart.

1639
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,730
Let's have a made this junk public.

1640
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:07,670
I'm going to be motherfucking Cheerios because I'm about to eat this Leprechaun for breakfast, dude.

1641
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,230
Let's go.

1642
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,550
You could have done that last night.

1643
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,630
But you were too scared to show up.

1644
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,690
Snuff, you're going to take that?

1645
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,290
Yeah.

1646
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,350
Let me just... what do these cards say?

1647
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:29,870
Just call me Daft Punk because tonight I'm going to get lucky.

1648
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,910
I'm going to fully like my laundry.

1649
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,430
Okay.

1650
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:43,710
I'm over witnessing Twitter in real life right now.

1651
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,790
I just want to see them fight.

1652
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,330
I just tweeted an aggressive video towards Fuyo Cloverman.

1653
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,550
Oh, you're sub tweeting right now?

1654
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,390
He told me the same thing.

1655
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,270
What is going on?

1656
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,570
I can't come up with anything clever so I'm resorting to posting on social media.

1657
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:05,790
That's classic.

1658
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,330
Fuyo men will destroy.

1659
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:10,590
Oh god.

1660
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,190
Alright, well, Loser has to delete their Twitter.

1661
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:13,950
Can we agree?

1662
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:17,290
Oh.

1663
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:17,770
No.

1664
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,330
Yeah, we'll put all the cards on this one.

1665
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,370
That's simply the winner.

1666
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,950
Well, I...

1667
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,310
I'm going to go with the card.

1668
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,050
I'm going to go with the Tension and...

1669
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:31,370
I feel one is very, very ready, and the other is a little intimidated.

1670
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:33,150
Slightly.

1671
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,290
Ever so slightly, I think.

1672
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,910
But I am excited to see how this goes.

1673
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:42,310
I've been waiting since yesterday, but it's finally happening, and I'm sure everyone else is super excited.

1674
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,990
Are you ready to fight?

1675
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:45,810
Yes.

1676
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:46,650
It's my grand legacy.

1677
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,550
I'm going to win four games in a row.

1678
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:51,270
And Fuyo, you're going to be the first step on the way to victory.

1679
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,070
It's your canon event!

1680
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,150
I would like to see you troll.

1681
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:57,270
Dang.

1682
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,350
Snuffy, how are you gonna commentate yourself?

1683
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:03,950
Don't worry.

1684
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,170
This is all a hired actor performance.

1685
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,850
This is just on my mini list of things that I'm extra skilled at.

1686
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,010
Wait, Snuffy, we swapped seats!

1687
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,310
Yesterday I was on the other side.

1688
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,130
How sick is that?

1689
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:16,970
My voice is dying one sec.

1690
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,770
We bought more than one seat this time.

1691
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:20,930
I like sharing our seat.

1692
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,310
Yep, alright, let's have a get in this junk.

1693
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,230
Snuffy, what is your... what is your face reveal?

1694
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,530
I'm the trash man!

1695
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:37,170
I go out and I start throwing garbage all over the place.

1696
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,030
Yeah, you look like you need a gastric bypass.

1697
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,890
I don't know if this is gonna work out, Snuffy.

1698
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,170
This is Danny Stavito!

1699
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,570
This is my hired actor!

1700
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,910
He's too paid to win the game for me.

1701
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,710
Danny Stavito.

1702
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,830
In this corner...

1703
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:59,010
We have...

1704
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:01,190
The little green thing...

1705
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:03,930
Becoming the big green thing!

1706
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,350
It's not Fuyo Cloverfield, it's Fuyo Man!

1707
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,930
Why is there another diaper?!

1708
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,250
I can't deal with this man!

1709
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,570
Well, Philly, in wrestling, it does get dirty.

1710
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,290
He's also not to have any accidents on the ring.

1711
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:25,070
Are those programmer socks?

1712
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:27,010
What is going on, ladies and gentlemen?

1713
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:27,730
Programmer socks?

1714
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,550
You see that junk?

1715
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,470
No, those are like, high... like knee highs.

1716
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,310
Those are beautiful.

1717
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:34,410
Kind of kinky.

1718
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,210
Oh, nice.

1719
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,450
A little bit of sugar in his step, dare I say.

1720
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:37,810
Thanks.

1721
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,830
A little bit of gold at the end of the rainbow, you know?

1722
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,770
Bro's showing us the whole rainbow right now.

1723
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,230
They're really doing it to us.

1724
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,090
They're showing us his lucky charms.

1725
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:57,050
And finally, risen from her slumber...

1726
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:04,470
Debuting the face reveal, the trash man, Snuffy!

1727
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:10,190
Snuffy, you didn't shave!

1728
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,350
What?

1729
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:16,930
It's me, I'm over here!

1730
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:17,490
It's me!

1731
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,470
I'm winning!

1732
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:20,950
I'm gonna win it all!

1733
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,290
Wait, can you not hear the game sound either, Snuffy?

1734
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:26,890
I'm through, everybody!

1735
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,590
It just sounds like you're talking in a room by yourself to me.

1736
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:34,970
Why isn't the crowd going crazy right now, guys?

1737
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:35,390
Come on!

1738
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:36,810
Everybody, woo-yah!

1739
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,190
Woo-yah, Snuffy, the trash man!

1740
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,070
Woo-yah!

1741
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:41,430
Woo-yah!

1742
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:42,850
Woo-yah!

1743
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,090
Fucking go!

1744
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,070
You're gonna hit the MC hammer!

1745
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:52,230
Who's fucking tweaking right now?

1746
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:54,750
Who's fucking tweaking right now?

1747
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,830
What am I watching right now?

1748
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,970
Are you gonna take off the hoodie or just stay on in the fight?

1749
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,830
I think I take it off.

1750
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,570
I'm really just the same.

1751
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:05,150
Oh, yeah!

1752
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,730
You should've just put it back on!

1753
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:09,810
Okay, here we go.

1754
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,410
I gotta fucking win this one.

1755
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:11,630
Oh my god.

1756
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:21,050
Okay, we're so not fast with Snuffy, just handing the actual beat down on this man.

1757
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,530
Slay head slam to the face.

1758
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,050
And this dude is already reeling.

1759
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:25,910
I don't know where Snuffy is.

1760
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,030
She's under the table right now?

1761
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,690
Am I slow-casting this?

1762
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:34,670
Fuck you!

1763
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,370
Fuck you, bitch!

1764
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,290
Grab ahold of the arm snap!

1765
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:38,870
Okay.

1766
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,190
I'm just gonna go for the straight up arm snap.

1767
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:48,210
Okay, now this is about to be the actual Richter Thor-scale earthquake right now.

1768
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:48,910
Slap!

1769
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,450
There's no way to overwave!

1770
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:50,850
One!

1771
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,830
Two!

1772
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:52,930
Okay, no, just a one count.

1773
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,450
Just a one count.

1774
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,170
Snuffy, don't get too ahead of yourself.

1775
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,390
You're not gonna get him that effing easy.

1776
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,150
But so far, this has been a one-sided beatdown.

1777
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:04,910
I feel like I'm watching, I don't know, like, Michael's son from GTA try and fight Trevor right now.

1778
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,750
This is absolutely grim coming out of the effing, uh, the gates here.

1779
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:10,710
I mean...

1780
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,810
Okay, straight for the nuts!

1781
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,250
I mean, hit him where it hurts!

1782
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,170
That's a straight critical.

1783
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,830
Mysterio walks!

1784
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:23,110
Snuffy walks back to her corner to give this man some time to breathe, only to come in with a rocket fist face slam.

1785
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,410
I mean, this is ridiculous.

1786
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:28,230
This dude's mohawk is painted like a rainbow and his face is gonna be painted red soon.

1787
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,150
Wait, it's not the face slam!

1788
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:30,450
Wait, is he getting pinned?!

1789
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,510
Wait, Snuffy, you almost got reversed!

1790
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:33,930
Alright.

1791
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,290
Looks like this man's trying to take out the trash.

1792
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:45,410
And Snuffy's really...

1793
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,670
This man is making a getaway!

1794
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:47,430
Just kidding!

1795
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,390
The animation cancelled back into the arena.

1796
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,930
Okay, and Snuffy's going for the backbreaker.

1797
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,970
Gonna age his spine about a few years.

1798
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:59,150
And now she's tossing out the chair.

1799
01:10:59,150 --> 01:10:59,770
And now the chair's gonna take out the trash herself!

1800
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,870
I'm gonna eat you like an egg!

1801
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:04,710
I'm gonna eat you like an egg!

1802
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,030
This is called hiding the body.

1803
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,650
She learned this one from Metal Gear Solid.

1804
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:10,370
And now she's gonna pick him up and maybe...

1805
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:10,630
And now she's gonna pick him up and maybe...

1806
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,310
I don't even know.

1807
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,250
Put him back down.

1808
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,430
This goes crazier than an Eminem rap song right now.

1809
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,050
I'm gonna do my signature move.

1810
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:20,370
A trash scrawl!

1811
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,770
A trash scrawl!

1812
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,190
Bruh!

1813
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,270
Here we go!

1814
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,230
Here we go!

1815
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:28,710
You messed up.

1816
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:29,610
Snuffy!

1817
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,710
No, no, this is the build up!

1818
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:33,130
Look at that!

1819
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,790
Oh yeah, baby!

1820
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,730
Oh yeah!

1821
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,870
My man is sniffing the rainbow, but the backflip misses and he gets up.

1822
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:41,470
Get a fucking whip!

1823
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,230
Oh shi- I feel like Snuffy might be getting rocked here.

1824
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:48,190
She's getting taken out too, again, off the top rope.

1825
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:52,310
I think her spine hit a 45 degree angle, but this man is...

1826
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,150
Jesus Christ!

1827
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,190
Crushing in her chest cavity right now.

1828
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,350
Oh, for you!

1829
01:11:58,510 --> 01:11:58,970
For you!

1830
01:11:58,970 --> 01:11:59,310
AHHHH!

1831
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:03,870
Wait, Snuffy, you good?

1832
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:04,850
Snuffy, you good?

1833
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:16,810
Oh shi- And both of them decide to make a mutual agreement to take the fight outside of them at the exact same time.

1834
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,410
But this man is tenacious.

1835
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:19,490
He stops at nothing.

1836
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:21,970
Oh my god!

1837
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,970
I'm in the wrestling match anymore!

1838
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:25,930
This is a brawl in the back streets of Detroit!

1839
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,530
Fuck!

1840
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,880
Okay, Snuffy's about to take him and throw him back where he came from, sending him out of the arena himself.

1841
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,720
Oh god!

1842
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,180
They're getting married!

1843
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,300
You can kiss the bride!

1844
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,320
Just kidding, he's Andrew Tate.

1845
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,880
And now he's going back in.

1846
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,300
He's gonna pick Snuffy up.

1847
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,900
Now we're entering dangerous territory, ladies and gentlemen.

1848
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,600
There's an epic six seconds on the clock.

1849
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,060
Four more seconds and they're going to be out.

1850
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,020
I'm gonna win it!

1851
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:53,280
Oh!

1852
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,020
Snuffy, you have to get back in the arena!

1853
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,440
Okay, not bad.

1854
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,400
Okay, they're back in.

1855
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,940
The competitors are back in.

1856
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:01,460
It's almost Monday.

1857
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:04,080
That means it's almost trash day.

1858
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,980
I can still win.

1859
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,380
Snuffy's getting reset back to default programming right now.

1860
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,700
I mean, she might go work at a trash compactor after this job's over.

1861
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,600
But she is fighting for the ground tooth and nail.

1862
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,500
I'm gonna make food eat all the place she was just in a trash compactor!

1863
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,260
Okay.

1864
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,960
I'm gonna gouge your eyes out.

1865
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:27,360
Oh, god!

1866
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:27,860
The key!

1867
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:28,500
Oh!

1868
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:28,880
Oh!

1869
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,160
Oh!

1870
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,560
And he's giving her some crazy action right now!

1871
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,300
Even crazier action!

1872
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,700
Is Snuffy into it?

1873
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,680
No, she is not!

1874
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,360
No, she's not!

1875
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,900
And this man is so frustrated.

1876
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,240
He got her number, but he couldn't get to fourth base.

1877
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,480
He's gonna taunt her now that she's on the ground.

1878
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,380
This is insane.

1879
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,240
Oh, yeah!

1880
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,300
Let me go!

1881
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:50,760
Oh, my god!

1882
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,000
She's getting stepped on.

1883
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,340
She's like watching an effing sub in real time.

1884
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,820
I'm not talking submarine, ladies and gentlemen.

1885
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,440
T-bagged her on the way through.

1886
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,380
Picks her up and slams her down the floor!

1887
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,400
Oh, my god!

1888
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,480
And now this man is hitting an effing...

1889
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,760
Hawkeye reindeer?

1890
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,540
Okay.

1891
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,340
I think Snuffy just might be dead.

1892
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,160
I'm not willing to see that call sign anymore.

1893
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:15,960
Her rings are shattered.

1894
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,660
What's going on?

1895
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,180
She's getting bedspreads!

1896
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,400
I mean, I know VTubers are light, but come on, Snuffy!

1897
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,760
That dropped like a paperweight!

1898
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,500
Holy moly!

1899
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,500
Oh, this could be it.

1900
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,440
Oh, god!

1901
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,600
Is he gonna do a backflip?

1902
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,080
He just straight up misses.

1903
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:32,820
You fucking thought!

1904
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,280
You thought!

1905
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,700
You thought I was dead!

1906
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,180
Oh, my god!

1907
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,780
And then Snuffy's turned to turn around.

1908
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,440
That's why I'm a paid actor, Fuyo man!

1909
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,360
That's why I'm a paid actor!

1910
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,300
And now I'm gonna make you eat dirt!

1911
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,280
I mean, that was a devious elbow straight to his left nipple.

1912
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,860
I think that might be an effing sub.

1913
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,340
Another one to the left nipple!

1914
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,960
We're taking serious damage there.

1915
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,020
That's gotta be bruising.

1916
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,240
Okay, the third T back of the fight.

1917
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,200
He goes in for the single leg shot.

1918
01:14:59,280 --> 01:14:59,580
My moment!

1919
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:02,620
Snuffy counters and then tosses him out like trash again.

1920
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:03,920
Sorry.

1921
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,280
Oh, my god!

1922
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,080
That looked like an illegal nut shot!

1923
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,340
He went head over nut!

1924
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,500
And he is down on the ground for sure.

1925
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,100
I'm just falling on top of you.

1926
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,300
I don't have any special moves.

1927
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,280
Oh, god!

1928
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,400
I'm gonna twist your fucking head!

1929
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,160
Snuffy's just gonna break his neck!

1930
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,580
I'm gonna rip your ears off!

1931
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,320
Some of these moves are getting down by a little bit.

1932
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:24,440
Oh, my god!

1933
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,240
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

1934
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,300
In the ninth- they are busting out all of the moves.

1935
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:29,720
Oh!

1936
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,660
And you need to win this crown.

1937
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,540
Oh, god, I'm...

1938
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,980
Snuffy, you're fleeing the fight right now!

1939
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:35,980
I need a minute.

1940
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,480
I need like five seconds.

1941
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,640
Just give me like... Oh, my god.

1942
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,680
Oh, no.

1943
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:43,100
The green goblin comes in with the effing green neck snap.

1944
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,660
Snuffy's down for the count.

1945
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,380
But it's a good thing she cannot get pinned outside of the arena.

1946
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,540
Otherwise, she might be dead right now.

1947
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:50,640
Oh, my god!

1948
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,560
That was my heart!

1949
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,180
I think it just exploded.

1950
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:53,500
Oh!

1951
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,620
Okay, he just sent her back home.

1952
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,180
I'm getting yanked around like a fish.

1953
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,340
Snuffy, how are you feeling about the fight so far?

1954
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,720
Hell, you have so much endurance!

1955
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,420
Wait, the roll is off of the mat!

1956
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,820
And she's actually getting pulled around!

1957
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,800
Jesus Christ!

1958
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,440
Somebody called Dana White!

1959
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,720
This is getting outside the scope of a fight.

1960
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,020
I mean, I don't even know if Snuffy can get up in time.

1961
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,140
We're up to six seconds, ladies and gentlemen.

1962
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,420
Give me like two more seconds, maybe.

1963
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,720
Seven seconds?

1964
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,480
No, one.

1965
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,200
Then restart the count.

1966
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,420
Oh my god.

1967
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,780
I mean, Snuffy's notes have become internal at this point.

1968
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,960
You put up any value buttons, but...

1969
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,080
There's too many people counting on me right now!

1970
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,660
My senpai!

1971
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:45,700
My master!

1972
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,900
I won't disappoint them!

1973
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:48,500
I can't!

1974
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,520
Not after all the training I went through!

1975
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,000
Alright, Izuku, you're up.

1976
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,460
Izuku Midoriya is kicking it into gear to take out Bakugo here.

1977
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,100
I'm not sure if this is gonna pay off though.

1978
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:56,700
OH!

1979
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,160
I'm gonna show everybody my special skill!

1980
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:06,700
She's heading to do the London Bridge's falling down?

1981
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,760
I don't know if this man can survive what's happening right now.

1982
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,340
I don't know if this man can survive what's happening right now.

1983
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:16,620
I think Snuffy has eighteen different variations of falling on top of him.

1984
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,580
And it's somehow working.

1985
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,580
Don't you wanna hug Fuyo, man?

1986
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,700
Don't be afraid of the dark!

1987
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,180
One!

1988
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,260
Two!

1989
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,040
There's no way!

1990
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,800
My god, this was so close!

1991
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,440
This was so close!

1992
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,180
Snuffy's about to save blood for the Blood God.

1993
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,040
Just give up!

1994
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,420
The hammer of Elba dropped.

1995
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,580
I think Snuffy is saying my order was still raw and she wants a refund on it.

1996
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,200
I'm not really sure to take from that one.

1997
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,020
Give me my drink!

1998
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,140
I think three concussions in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.

1999
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,640
And these characters are not really still in at this point.

2000
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,040
We're just watching cells of their former selves fight for anything.

2001
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,440
I'm gonna make your fucking brain!

2002
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,540
A shamrock shake!

2003
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,680
Oh!

2004
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,200
And Snuffy uses the falling for the eighteenth time!

2005
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,320
I mean, Snuffy certainly has a favorite move.

2006
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,620
Let's fucking go.

2007
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:13,440
Just call me fucking Fall Guys because you're about to see this guy fall!

2008
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:13,880
And she's effing twerking.

2009
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:13,880
What?

2010
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,800
She had a backflip?

2011
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,200
There's no

2012
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:20,420
way!

2013
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,260
Oh my god!

2014
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,900
Oh my god, Fuyo, man!

2015
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,540
You have the endurance of a god!

2016
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,960
I commend you!

2017
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:26,720
I commend you!

2018
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:27,580
I commend you!

2019
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,460
She's gonna commend him with a hearty choke to the neck.

2020
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,720
I mean, this is the fight that keeps on giving, chat.

2021
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,100
It is like hepatitis.

2022
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,860
These fires do not stop for anything.

2023
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,040
Come here, man.

2024
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,380
Come here.

2025
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,100
I'm gonna show you why I take out the garbage.

2026
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,340
At some point, I wouldn't be surprised if Snuffy grabbed an audience from the effing stands to pull into this fight.

2027
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,660
Use them as a bludgeoning tool.

2028
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:46,960
Oh god!

2029
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,640
I mean, this is getting serious business.

2030
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,920
I see a kid in the front row.

2031
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,200
I mean, I don't know if he can handle that.

2032
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,600
Let's see what's happening right now.

2033
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,340
They're back into the arena as we speak.

2034
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,620
And I think Snuffy...

2035
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,000
Oh, she...

2036
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,760
Super slam!

2037
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,700
This is not like on the tramp.

2038
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,840
She'll have a spirit bomb straight on top of her.

2039
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:09,060
Oh, I mean...

2040
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:09,780
Oh, Folio man, are you exhausted?

2041
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,680
Oh shit, my balls!

2042
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,220
I don't know how these two fires are still standing.

2043
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,040
Folio man, stop!

2044
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,160
Oh no!

2045
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:18,960
Wait!

2046
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,820
There's no way!

2047
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,400
He said, Snuffy, do you like that?

2048
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,160
You like that?

2049
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,340
She does not!

2050
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,180
Oh my god.

2051
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,540
She's still in this fight.

2052
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,600
I don't even know how she's doing.

2053
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,240
I don't know how they're still alive.

2054
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,480
This random girl in the back is cheering for USA.

2055
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,620
I think this man came to the wrong concert venue.

2056
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,160
Oh my god.

2057
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,400
Because I'm American!

2058
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,420
She's a leprechaun!

2059
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,160
Could Snuffy take out the luck of the Irish?

2060
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,840
No, that guy said, this is awesome, get a life!

2061
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,260
Her leg just got kicked through the rope.

2062
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,480
I don't even know what's going on.

2063
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,420
I just got my toes stubbed.

2064
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,200
Oh god!

2065
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:55,980
What's happening?

2066
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:56,980
Folio, please.

2067
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,220
Oh!

2068
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,820
Oh my god!

2069
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,180
Is he going for the pin?

2070
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,060
No, another powerbomb.

2071
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,140
Never mind.

2072
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,140
I don't know what's happening.

2073
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,000
The fireman...

2074
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,840
A new move, ladies and gentlemen!

2075
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:12,480
Oh my god!

2076
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,720
That is a fractured elbow.

2077
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,160
And now he's raising the roof like an effing 2018...

2078
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,020
I don't know if I can last.

2079
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,040
I don't know if you can make it, but the roaring 20s is called.

2080
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,200
They want their dance moves back.

2081
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,480
This man is about to go and grab the top rope, I imagine.

2082
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,240
But he's really far away from Snuffy.

2083
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,120
I don't know if he can reach.

2084
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,100
Oh my god!

2085
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,860
And he turns her head into a pancake.

2086
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,960
I mean, her IQ is definitely below 100 if it wasn't before.

2087
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,920
Just kidding.

2088
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,280
What the frick!

2089
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:43,760
No!

2090
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:44,500
Wait!

2091
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,660
Snuffy took her own self out of the move!

2092
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:50,500
Snuffy!

2093
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:51,720
No!

2094
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,320
You took yourself out!

2095
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,780
What happened?

2096
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:56,540
And our winner...

2097
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:02,540
It usually isn't easy being green, but today, green has won!

2098
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,560
It's Fuyo Man!

2099
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,420
Fuyo Man!

2100
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:09,580
Fuyo Man!

2101
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:11,880
Yeah.

2102
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,020
Yeah.

2103
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,720
Holy moly.

2104
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:16,800
Fuyo Man, destroy!

2105
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,000
Snuffy!

2106
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,760
Snuffy, are you there?

2107
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:21,840
Snuffy!

2108
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,120
Oh!

2109
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,400
Oh god!

2110
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,280
I have murdered a raccoon.

2111
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,820
Oh yeah, I got...

2112
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,220
I just got my shit kicked in so bad.

2113
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,420
I got my shit kicked in so bad.

2114
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,100
I can almost feel that actor's realism.

2115
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,840
He got his shit kicked in so bad, dude.

2116
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,820
That was insane.

2117
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,720
That was an actual slobber knocker of a fight.

2118
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:43,960
That was an actual slobber knocker of a fight.

2119
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,320
Yo, Mr. Fuyo, did you ever feel like the match was in doubt?

2120
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,640
No, this is just an horrible Saturday.

2121
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,560
Or Sunday.

2122
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,240
I can't get the days right.

2123
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,560
But sure can't land his punches.

2124
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,800
You gotta respect that, ladies and gentlemen.

2125
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,820
Just tell me, Fuyo Man, on a Saturday.

2126
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,140
On a Sunday, he's already so unpleasant.

2127
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,940
Meet him on a Saturday, you might not even leave to tell about it.

2128
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,340
Dang, Fuyo Man, you put up a good fight.

2129
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,200
It looks like we settled the beef.

2130
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,460
So, uh, Snuffy.

2131
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,520
Are you gonna rescind all of your statements you made against Fuyo?

2132
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:23,580
I always knew Fuyo was gonna be my biggest hurdle in the fight, and that's why I don't mind that I lost to them, because I feel like they're gonna go and win it all.

2133
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,740
And it'll show that I was truly, at least, second best at the most.

2134
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:28,740
Man.

2135
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,020
Alright.

2136
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,080
That is okay.

2137
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:32,940
Well...

2138
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,240
Those are acceptable standards.

2139
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,860
That was a crazy fight.

2140
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,500
That was like 18 variations of people turning themselves into pancakes.

2141
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:43,260
I mean, like I'm talking IHOP at that point.

2142
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,960
Yeah, that looked like a Waffle House at 3 in the morning.

2143
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:47,880
That was pretty insane.

2144
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:54,440
We had the the sort of energy and stamina that...

2145
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,820
I would like to say something.

2146
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,080
You'd only see normally in a rabid fight.

2147
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:04,340
So, it looks like Ursula stole our interviewer's voice, and then hopefully she'll return at any second now.

2148
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:05,180
But...

2149
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:05,580
Yeah.

2150
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,460
So, anyway, what I was thinking...

2151
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,400
I was mad!

2152
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,440
I was mad!

2153
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,400
Fuyo-man, please, before you go, please!

2154
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,920
I must ask!

2155
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:17,900
What?

2156
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,660
It's a temperament.

2157
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,440
I-I-I'm our first match.

2158
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:23,920
Sudo had a diaper and won!

2159
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,260
You had a diaper and won!

2160
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,080
What does this mean?

2161
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:26,560
Please!

2162
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:27,620
I must know!

2163
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,820
It's a fashion statement.

2164
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,580
Bro said belt!

2165
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:39,780
They're reinventing the wrestling attire here by mainstreaming the diaper.

2166
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,140
Do you plan on rocking this diaper if you win at all?

2167
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,820
What does that say about future wrestling?

2168
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,040
The diaper stays on during the match.

2169
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,260
Dang!

2170
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:51,180
The World of Warcraft classic drip.

2171
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,400
I mean, this person's dynamic and they are full of utility.

2172
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,000
God, Sam!

2173
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,780
Snuffy, I-I must-I must ask.

2174
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,800
Was the person standing in for you did he shower?

2175
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,780
No, he never showered.

2176
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,220
When I did-when I went through the interview process, he was probably the stinkiest of the bunch.

2177
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,120
I was hoping maybe if he didn't have...

2178
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,680
Yeah.

2179
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:21,620
Maybe if he didn't have pure fighting skill, he might have just been able to, like, fumigate Fuyo to the point where she would not be able to, like, enter the ring.

2180
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,600
It would be like a debuff.

2181
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,420
Like a-like a nuclear gas.

2182
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:34,160
I will say I've done my-I've done my research on Fuyo and Fuyo does- Fuyo man, would you like to explain what I'm about to say?

2183
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,980
I believe the stench was matched.

2184
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,200
Yes.

2185
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,720
Wait, your stench maxing?

2186
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:44,780
Fuyo man only showers once a month.

2187
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:45,360
Of course.

2188
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:52,120
My stench didn't bother Fuyo at all because they matched it even with something even stinkier.

2189
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:52,600
Exactly.

2190
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,440
I'm gonna be honest.

2191
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:04,560
I think that was the best match of WrestleTuber 2024 yet.

2192
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:05,640
Oh my god!

2193
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,660
I-I'm-I'm-I'm gonna be honest.

2194
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,600
I think it was the best one.

2195
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:13,900
And I-I can't wait to see how Fuyo-how far Fuyo man goes.

2196
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,840
I believe in you, Fuyo man.

2197
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,180
Let's go, Fuyo man!

2198
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,600
Yeah!

2199
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:18,900
Yay!

2200
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:21,540
Well.

2201
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,500
And, um, now I get my co-caster back.

2202
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,100
Da-ding!

2203
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,140
Yeah, now I don't have to grow in the whole time.

2204
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,040
I mean, the paid actor, of course.

2205
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,320
That was definitely not me getting my ass peed.

2206
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,200
That was not humiliating in the least.

2207
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,640
I was also just a paid actor.

2208
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:43,440
Alright.

2209
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,760
I believe it's time for our next fight.

2210
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,740
Are we gonna bring on our contestants?

2211
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:47,800
Is that how this works?

2212
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,620
Wait a second.

2213
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,200
Since Fuyo won, does that mean Fuyo sticks around?

2214
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,640
Yeah, Fuyo is gonna go fight the next fight now.

2215
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,140
I believe Fuyo man is gonna take the whole match.

2216
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:01,900
Wow.

2217
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:04,900
And Fuyo man's- Of course.

2218
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,740
And Fuyo man's opponent is going to be none other than the lovely Nana?

2219
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:11,700
Yes.

2220
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:15,120
The Nana that destroyed the Gerard, the pregnant dinosaur.

2221
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,000
Oh.

2222
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:23,000
Alright, well I can't wait to see when she, uh, when she shows up on the effing set, but, uh, Fuyo!

2223
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,820
I mean, are you gonna change up your strategy this time around versus Snuffy?

2224
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,460
Fuyo man destroy.

2225
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,520
Miku?

2226
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,220
Tatsune Miku?

2227
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,020
Tatsune Miku?

2228
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:37,060
Good morning.

2229
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,800
Good Miku morning.

2230
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,720
Miku morning!

2231
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,780
Miss Nana, are you ready to fight the Fuyo man?

2232
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,240
Oh yeah!

2233
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,360
Let's go!

2234
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,800
I have a habit of crushing small things on the earth.

2235
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,240
You're calling Fuyo man small?!

2236
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,760
Oh yeah!

2237
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,380
Oh yeah!

2238
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,920
Compared to the galaxy, all I see is a tiny green snotty speck.

2239
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,560
Oh!

2240
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:02,540
Frig!

2241
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,120
Fuyo man destroy.

2242
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,000
Someone just casted Shrigger onto Fuyo man.

2243
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,480
I mean, this is more accurate champ size right now.

2244
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,160
This is ridiculous.

2245
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,100
Fuyo man big heart.

2246
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,720
Fuyo- yes, Fuyo man, you're very, very big.

2247
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:20,820
So large.

2248
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,760
They shrunk down to save their energy.

2249
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:23,580
Yes.

2250
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:24,860
I see, I see.

2251
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:29,280
I think honestly the biggest thing here is Fuyo man's ego, which I'm about to crush tonight.

2252
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,480
Dang!

2253
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,700
I think that's a good assumption.

2254
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:38,220
I think if Fuyo man continues this match, by the time he's done with his last match, he's gonna Dr. Manhattan fucking delete the next guy.

2255
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,120
So you need to put a stop to this.

2256
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,180
Like a god dang super villain.

2257
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,140
Leave it to me!

2258
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:43,600
Do you feel the pressure?

2259
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,480
Leave it to me!

2260
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,540
I have history.

2261
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,800
I have a complete resume of putting an end to many things, including bloodlines.

2262
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,000
So watch out for your man.

2263
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:52,480
Dang!

2264
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:59,920
I mean, speaking of superheroes, you guys are pretty much the same size as Thanos and Ant-Man, and we all saw that day we could end up.

2265
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,980
So, any predictions today, chat?

2266
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:02,500
Let's see.

2267
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,920
I think they're ready.

2268
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:06,400
Fuyo man destroy.

2269
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,980
The viewers are rooting for Nana today.

2270
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:11,160
Fuyo man is close.

2271
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:16,780
They want to see Fuyo man win it all, but they also would like to see Nana bring in a win, it looks like.

2272
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,380
Fuyo man, I have the ultimate question for you, Fuyo man.

2273
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,760
New York or DC?

2274
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:23,940
Europe.

2275
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:27,200
Doesn't matter.

2276
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:33,320
Doesn't matter because I will be sending your dead leprechaun corpse to the National Museum.

2277
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,400
Anywhere.

2278
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:34,960
Okay?

2279
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,440
Okay?

2280
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,960
That's where I'll be sending it.

2281
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:37,720
Oh my god.

2282
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,120
He's gonna be a specimen in the museum.

2283
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:39,940
Don't even ask for a mailing address.

2284
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,420
Just send her a coffin.

2285
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,480
She's come to deal business.

2286
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,040
Oh yeah.

2287
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:47,260
You will need all the leprechaun work for that.

2288
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,700
We need all the leprechaun work for that.

2289
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:51,760
Oh yeah.

2290
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:55,340
You're talking up the luckiest person in the room right now.

2291
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:56,500
That's pretty hard.

2292
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,140
I'll take my chances.

2293
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,060
Fuyo can win out of pure luck.

2294
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,100
She's got that manipulation going.

2295
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,960
She's got the plus 10 luck skill.

2296
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,820
That's a pretty insane logic.

2297
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,380
Anything can be your downfall.

2298
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,580
You might trip on a banana peel.

2299
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,920
Why is there one in the wrestling room?

2300
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,340
Luck baby, luck.

2301
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,340
Life is a gamble.

2302
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,080
Bring it on.

2303
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,740
I think that's the great attitude to bring it on.

2304
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:21,060
I think that's the great attitude to bring it on.

2305
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,100
I would like to see this match.

2306
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,400
Fuyo versus Nana.

2307
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:23,920
Nana?

2308
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,140
This is gonna be good.

2309
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:29,330
Wait.

2310
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:30,710
Now you got me doubting.

2311
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,510
It's Nana, right?

2312
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:33,010
Or Nana?

2313
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,250
It's Nana.

2314
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:35,350
Okay.

2315
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:35,910
Thank you.

2316
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:38,050
Banana ooh nana.

2317
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:41,410
There is a banana on the stage.

2318
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,170
Ooh nana.

2319
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:44,150
Ooh nana.

2320
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:44,970
I've never heard that.

2321
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:45,550
Wait.

2322
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:46,650
Can I not hear the... Okay.

2323
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:47,110
Ooh.

2324
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,110
I like the fit.

2325
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:53,310
It's giving Rarity My Little Pony very amazing personal favor.

2326
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:53,310
Stop.

2327
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:54,470
That's literally what Juna told me.

2328
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:55,510
That's literally what Juna...

2329
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,990
I'm sorry.

2330
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:57,430
I'm sorry.

2331
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:03,370
All the way from the cosmos of Australia.

2332
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:04,570
I like the halo.

2333
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:07,130
You know them as the vanquisher of dinosaurs.

2334
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,210
You know them as the vanquisher of dinosaurs.

2335
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:09,130
It's the galaxy.

2336
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:11,430
It's Nana.

2337
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:13,410
It's Nana.

2338
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,400
Give me some audio on the TV.

2339
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:22,780
Give me some audio on the TV.

2340
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,240
Yeah.

2341
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,860
Not Doug who can't hear it.

2342
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:25,800
Whoa.

2343
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:26,500
Okay.

2344
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,700
An angel ascends down from the heavens.

2345
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,560
I mean this is absolutely magnificent.

2346
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,220
Oh my.

2347
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,340
The drip is insane.

2348
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,900
This might be one of my favorite wrestling outfits I've yet to see.

2349
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:36,740
This might be one of my favorite wrestling outfits I've yet to see.

2350
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,220
Oh my God.

2351
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:39,560
And she wastes no time getting straight into the arena.

2352
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:39,720
Oh my God.

2353
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:39,720
And she wastes no time getting straight into the arena.

2354
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,400
Krong on all fours like a possessed animal.

2355
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,100
But this is not an animal.

2356
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:48,260
She's displaying her absolute attitude and ownership of this stage.

2357
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:52,780
But this is not an animal.

2358
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,520
There's at least 10 Discord moderators saying please step on me right now.

2359
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,160
I can tell.

2360
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,980
I'm one of them and I'm currently in her DMs.

2361
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:00,660
Interesting.

2362
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,880
Well we're gonna have to see if...

2363
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,280
He's mean.

2364
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,960
He's green.

2365
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:09,540
It's the diaper wearing machine coming back.

2366
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:10,780
FUYA MAN!

2367
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:16,220
I just had shivers go down my spine.

2368
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,320
Yeah the PTSD kicked in.

2369
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:19,560
I think...

2370
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,780
Oh my God.

2371
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,540
The way he looked.

2372
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:25,880
I hate the way you look.

2373
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,160
The way you talk.

2374
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,280
This mean green killing machine has already shed some blood today.

2375
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,880
This mean green killing machine has already shed some blood today.

2376
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,860
Will they be back to return that favor?

2377
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,020
Will they still have the stamina to take another win?

2378
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:38,840
Will they still have the stamina to take another win?

2379
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,100
Will they show you guys why I died?

2380
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,640
And it wasn't because I'm unskilled.

2381
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:44,740
And it wasn't because I'm unskilled.

2382
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:45,140
Truly.

2383
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:46,400
We're gonna see why.

2384
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,800
Nana will put up a good fight I'm sure.

2385
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,140
We might be able to see Nana pull off a win here.

2386
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:53,180
Nana's tired.

2387
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,980
Yeah that's what I was gonna say right?

2388
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,720
Fuyo Man just came out of an epic grueling fight.

2389
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,960
Do you see his chest?

2390
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,160
It's red and sore.

2391
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,760
I think it's just his nips slipping I'm not gonna lie.

2392
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:05,600
Insane pepperonis there.

2393
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,520
With eyes.

2394
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:08,280
They also have eyes I see.

2395
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,860
I'm not sure what the context is but alright let's go.

2396
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,060
Straight into the fight!

2397
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:17,580
Nana taking an instant lead on this.

2398
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,020
Oh!

2399
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,440
Nana is taking control of the situation.

2400
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,920
She's lifting for...

2401
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,660
Oh my god!

2402
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,140
A little bit...

2403
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,880
Fuyo takes advantage of that sloppy landing.

2404
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,220
Nana might have gotten ahead of herself here.

2405
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,180
Oh no!

2406
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,460
Is it gonna be a clothesline?

2407
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,040
No it's a collision head on.

2408
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,780
40 miles an hour train versus 40 miles an hour train.

2409
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,660
That's a massive problem.

2410
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:41,600
Nana taking control of the situation with an amazing dead drop there.

2411
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,080
Oh!

2412
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,820
And just mind gaming the situation here.

2413
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:45,460
Whoa!

2414
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,380
She just pulled Fuyo's signature move on himself.

2415
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,100
She jumped over his head with a tea bag.

2416
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,640
I mean that's a taste of his own medicine.

2417
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:52,660
Oh!

2418
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,420
She's grabbing him by the beard.

2419
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:54,880
Oh!

2420
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,000
She's grabbing him by the beard.

2421
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Whoa!

2422
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,960
Bringing Fuyo man down to the ground.

2423
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:57,480
Oh!

2424
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,780
Fuyo man's got it with a straight kick!

2425
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,560
Kicks from the floor as well as beard grabbing.

2426
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,220
I mean this fight is already off to an unkempt start.

2427
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:06,380
Fuyo.

2428
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,220
Oh my god!

2429
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:10,600
Really showing those bar fights coming in handy here.

2430
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,580
Oh my goodness!

2431
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:14,220
Going for the weak spots right on the elbow there.

2432
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,440
That's gonna throw her in the air.

2433
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,100
That's gonna throw Nana in for a turn anytime they want to set up some moves.

2434
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,200
That's gonna throw Nana in for a turn anytime they want to set up some moves.

2435
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:19,520
Oh!

2436
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:20,320
Pull up!

2437
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,520
I mean, Nana's kind of taking that beating roll into this fight.

2438
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,080
Oh my goodness!

2439
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:24,380
Yeah!

2440
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:27,320
Fuyo man is leading quite strongly into this match.

2441
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:27,820
Oh!

2442
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:30,800
But Nana is turning the moves back around in her favor.

2443
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,100
Oh!

2444
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:31,100
But Nana is turning the moves back around in her favor.

2445
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,020
This could still look up to her.

2446
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:33,460
Oh!

2447
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,520
She got on the beard again!

2448
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:35,860
Leave the man's face alone!

2449
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:36,640
She's insane!

2450
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,260
Remove the flesh and bone!

2451
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,140
Go Nana!

2452
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:40,400
Go!

2453
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,900
Do what your body is telling you!

2454
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,380
Remove the flesh!

2455
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,440
Oh sorry I got a little bit of a...

2456
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,020
I'm a little caught up in the moment.

2457
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:49,600
She should have called him Popo but I don't think she needs that guy at this point.

2458
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,020
She is just delivering the smackdown on all levels right now.

2459
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:53,240
Oh!

2460
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,060
But Fuyo interjects with another low blow.

2461
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,260
Elbow to the eyes there.

2462
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:58,960
That's a little...

2463
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,800
She's gonna rest and sleep on him.

2464
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,360
Nana is showing skill.

2465
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,460
Oh my... Fuyo with another low blow.

2466
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:08,820
See Fuyo is just interjecting with these quick little jabs.

2467
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,120
And Nana will turn it back around and be like, You know what?

2468
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,780
This is what real skill looks like.

2469
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,300
Let's see if she can do it again.

2470
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:21,020
Oh and see another situation where a trained professional meets somebody who's only learned through backyard brawling.

2471
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:25,260
Yeah I think Nana has a lot of openings in her defenses.

2472
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,780
She keeps getting kicked in the head.

2473
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,180
She might have to look out for that weak spot.

2474
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,300
Nana has some professionalism.

2475
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,280
She looks like she's here to win.

2476
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:34,900
Wait one...

2477
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,480
Oh!

2478
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,960
Fuyo-man is not so quick to give up as we've seen with our match.

2479
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,760
Fuyo-man is a dedicated insane stamina giver.

2480
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:42,960
Oh my god.

2481
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,700
But you know I didn't realize...

2482
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:45,820
Oh my god!

2483
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,040
The reverse flying axe kick!

2484
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,400
Fuyo-man took off the diaper for this match.

2485
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:51,720
This person watches Naruto.

2486
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,660
So could this be the loss?

2487
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:56,200
Is this loss?

2488
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,200
I don't know.

2489
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:00,200
I think you just take her to Ibiza.

2490
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,920
I've seen Warheads slam into the sides of this ring that I've had my entire career so far.

2491
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,680
But she's getting picked back up.

2492
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,720
And she's stunned.

2493
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,900
What is happening?

2494
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,840
She just dislocated Nana's arm.

2495
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,760
She's being sacrificed like Abraham's eldest son.

2496
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:16,900
Her neck is about to snap.

2497
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,520
Fuyo doesn't look like...

2498
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,360
Oh she can hold her!

2499
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,580
Oh she takes him off.

2500
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,180
They're both hurt from that move.

2501
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,700
Nana turned that around in her favor.

2502
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,000
A weak drop.

2503
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,280
She misses her kick there.

2504
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:31,040
Both of these wrestlers behaving like they're at least six drinks in right now.

2505
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,740
Not even sure if they know who they're fighting anymore at this point.

2506
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,580
Fuyo definitely has at least three concussions.

2507
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:36,220
Oh my god.

2508
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:38,120
Fuyo cannot...

2509
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,060
Burping him like a baby boy.

2510
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,880
Let's see if Nana can keep the lead.

2511
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,260
Fuyo can turn it around.

2512
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,200
What is this?

2513
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,920
Oh my god.

2514
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,180
She got him in the ham sandwich.

2515
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,180
They turned into an ice cream sandwich for that maneuver.

2516
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:56,040
Again, Nana really does not have good defense when she goes for grapples.

2517
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,640
It's a common weak spot for her.

2518
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,680
Wait, she's down!

2519
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,200
Fuyo just turned that around on her too.

2520
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,200
Oh my...

2521
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,780
Fuyo wins just like that!

2522
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,060
An instant turnaround.

2523
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,760
Fuyo man sweep.

2524
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,420
Nana must be green with Evie.

2525
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,340
Because moving on is Fuyo man!

2526
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,920
It's the second final row, Snuffy!

2527
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:25,700
We witnessed Fuyo Man do a reversal on one of the opponent's signature moves to take them out.

2528
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,500
He is a counter-god!

2529
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,160
I knew Fuyo Man was going to take the lead and win it all.

2530
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,740
I told you guys that his win would be ominous.

2531
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,600
Fillion, are you going to step in here?

2532
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,480
Will you be seeing Fuyo Man in your matches?

2533
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,140
I might have to at this rate.

2534
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:41,100
I'm kind of scared though.

2535
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:46,080
I mean this guy might have a contract with FaZe Clan because this dude can counter strike for sure.

2536
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,300
I don't know.

2537
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:49,920
Don't laugh at that.

2538
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,920
Okay, let's take it back to the casters or the interviewers.

2539
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,460
Oh my god.

2540
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,520
Small but mighty.

2541
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,240
And strong enough to take down a fucking galaxy?

2542
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,980
Nana, what do you have to say?

2543
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,880
You were talking big mad shit.

2544
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,760
Do you know what?

2545
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,040
I'm actually not too mad because guess what?

2546
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:18,920
Fuyo has to go against at least three other people from my dead agency.

2547
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,980
And so the will of the Treadmill continues.

2548
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,540
I may fall today, but you will go against all those who come after me.

2549
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,800
Good luck, Fuyo man.

2550
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,520
You are literally invoking all nine members of the One For All legacy right now.

2551
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,900
I don't know what's going on.

2552
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,220
The F4Legacy is going to be the one for all.

2553
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:36,960
I'm going to be the one for all.

2554
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,280
I'm going to be the one for all.

2555
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:39,980
Fuyo is on our head.

2556
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:40,920
Fuyo is on our head.

2557
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,520
What is going on, ladies and gentlemen?

2558
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,080
This man has jumped into our hair.

2559
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,280
Fuyo man, destroy.

2560
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:48,180
No!

2561
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,560
Fuyo man, are you ready to reenact the fucking Christmas Carol?

2562
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:54,700
Because you're about to Ebenezer Scrooge this company's last members.

2563
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,040
Are you ready to win it all?

2564
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:59,460
Are you going to fight the ghosts of VTuber past, present, and future?

2565
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,180
I will murder.

2566
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:03,480
I see.

2567
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:04,720
He has learned well.

2568
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,900
He has learned well.

2569
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,920
That was a victory with no diaper.

2570
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:12,440
I would like to put that out there too.

2571
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,720
Fuyo man did not wear his signature diaper that match.

2572
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:17,180
That means that wasn't even a fraction of his power.

2573
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,860
Kindness is cool, Pencil.

2574
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,000
Kindness is very cool.

2575
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:25,260
That is actually Fuyo man's real underwear, by the way.

2576
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,000
It's true.

2577
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,180
Yes, I acknowledge your drip.

2578
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:31,980
Will you be selling it after this match, Fuyo man?

2579
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:33,360
Oh!

2580
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,700
If money horrid.

2581
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,680
Get your licensed merchandise.

2582
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,360
I need an adult!

2583
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:44,680
Fuyo man.

2584
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:45,540
Fundies.

2585
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,540
You'll win every match you ever enter.

2586
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,440
Oh, I got an SD card.

2587
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:53,420
Oh!

2588
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:54,880
Oh!

2589
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:55,720
Oh my.

2590
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,340
Fillion is dead.

2591
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:58,420
Oh my god.

2592
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,160
Fillion is back.

2593
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,280
We're so back.

2594
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:00,900
We're so back.

2595
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,540
We're so back.

2596
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,260
And we'll come back.

2597
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,420
Oh my god.

2598
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:04,320
One second.

2599
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:04,640
You don't want to have me now.

2600
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:06,540
Well...

2601
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:09,100
Not an axe like Thanos, snap the wrong person.

2602
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,400
Okay, please, I have a right on God's green herb to walk around.

2603
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,860
Fireman, what are your next opponent?

2604
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:18,600
It's a bit scary.

2605
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,720
Are you ready to raid her dungeon?

2606
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:22,640
Yes.

2607
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,440
Fireman raid.

2608
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:26,660
Fireman destroy.

2609
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:31,200
Come on, Omiya Emma, you have to avenge me!

2610
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,680
You have to avenge me!

2611
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,060
For Prism and for Cerulea!

2612
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,240
For all of us!

2613
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,660
Stop the leprechaun!

2614
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:38,920
Stop the Irish!

2615
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,300
End them!

2616
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,400
Stop the Irish!

2617
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,280
End them!

2618
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,400
End quote.

2619
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,360
Let's fucking go, Fuyo man.

2620
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,580
Your life ends ten seconds from now.

2621
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:49,840
Let's see if that's true.

2622
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,120
My final message...

2623
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,460
Alright, well we're gonna go ahead and move Nonna out of here.

2624
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,500
Thank you so much for competing.

2625
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,980
Thank you so much Snuffy and Fillion and Doki.

2626
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:01,180
Great job.

2627
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,600
And thank you so much, Fuyo and Juna.

2628
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,500
Thank you so much.

2629
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:04,080
Bye bye!

2630
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,340
Goodbye, bye bye!

2631
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:06,460
Bye bye!

2632
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,880
Alright, and we're gonna bring in our next competitor.

2633
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,740
Somehow she looks even bigger right now than the other one.

2634
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:16,280
It is going...

2635
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:16,980
I mean, dang!

2636
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,140
I mean, bigger in a lot of ways.

2637
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:22,420
She is up and she is ready for combat.

2638
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,400
It is...

2639
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:23,960
Emma!

2640
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,100
Miss Emma.

2641
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:26,460
Oh.

2642
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,320
What?

2643
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,080
What?

2644
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:28,860
Is she asleep?

2645
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,140
Ring-a-ding-ding, Emma!

2646
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,380
Your match is starting!

2647
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,420
Oh my god!

2648
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:37,760
Who's there to disturb my sl- What?

2649
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:38,500
What?

2650
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:40,840
Where is the next opener?

2651
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,820
Sorry, what's here?

2652
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,860
Wiki wiki, Emma!

2653
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,800
Emma, it's time for you to call for someone.

2654
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:50,180
Are you ready for this challenge?

2655
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,060
I know you just woke up.

2656
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:52,960
I see no one over here.

2657
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,660
Are you ready to kill somebody?

2658
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:55,900
Somebody?

2659
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:56,180
Where?

2660
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,920
Yo, Fuyo, speak up!

2661
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:58,720
Fuyo, speak up!

2662
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:01,660
You might have to squint a little bit, but Fuyo-man...

2663
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,680
Fuyo-man destroyed.

2664
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,160
Holy shit!

2665
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:05,220
What is that thing?

2666
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,600
Oh my god!

2667
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:07,840
Miss Emma.

2668
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:08,260
Oh, you...

2669
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,080
What?

2670
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:09,520
What?

2671
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:13,920
Miss Emma, Fuyo-man has won two games in... two matches in a row.

2672
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,040
Do you feel intimidated?

2673
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,320
I don't know.

2674
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,280
I cannot even see him down there.

2675
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,880
Can you climb, Fuyo-man?

2676
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,720
Of course.

2677
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:27,500
What is it?

2678
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:28,320
Attack on Titan?

2679
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:29,960
Climb to...

2680
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,260
What is happening?

2681
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:34,020
Fuyo-man is not the only thing that can climb on those ropes in the match.

2682
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:37,060
There's other things that Fuyo-man has sealed it, escalating.

2683
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,700
Fuyo-man escalated the funny questions.

2684
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,900
Wow, Fuyo-man, you are so bold.

2685
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:48,480
I respect that.

2686
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,000
Emma, does Fuyo-man feel good?

2687
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,820
Fuyo-man feels very good.

2688
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,160
Oh, that's very nice.

2689
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:56,420
Three inches.

2690
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:02,240
Fuyo-man, since you are so small, I'm going to smash you like really gentle, okay?

2691
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:05,340
So I'll make sure you don't cry and pee in your diapers.

2692
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,340
I'm feeling some weird tension already.

2693
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,220
Fuyo-man, destroy.

2694
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:12,440
Okay, Fuyo-man, we shall see about that.

2695
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:18,100
Emma, are you trying to like warm into submission before the match even starts right now?

2696
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,160
Because it seems like the charm isn't working right now.

2697
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,420
Mind games is exactly what sets the mental for victory.

2698
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,140
I am not.

2699
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,640
Yeah, and this guy has a stronger mental game than Michael Scott.

2700
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,400
I don't know.

2701
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:37,080
Mentally quiver and shake is exactly what you need to make them waver their faulty strength and confidence.

2702
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,920
Make Fuyo-man doubt why he's on this stage.

2703
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,980
Make him doubt why he was ever in this career.

2704
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,820
Fuyo-man is confused.

2705
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:46,520
Oh, no, it's working.

2706
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,180
We're manipulating him.

2707
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,680
Fuyo-man, you always wanted to be a doctor.

2708
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:51,980
Remember what your mother said.

2709
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,860
What does that mean?

2710
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:56,220
Doctor.

2711
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:59,140
Good gaslight.

2712
01:42:59,320 --> 01:42:59,760
Yes.

2713
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:00,960
That's amazing.

2714
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:12,000
Well, Fuyo-man is about to perform an elaborate examination on his opponent, Emma, today.

2715
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:14,100
Emma, are you ready for your examination?

2716
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,540
I am super ready.

2717
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,820
He can inspect me whenever he wants.

2718
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,060
I see what he finds.

2719
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,700
Sounds like we should get to it.

2720
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:23,920
Oh.

2721
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:24,220
Oh.

2722
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:32,370
I'm gonna be knowledgable for following you nearly ten or so times.

2723
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:32,370
frick.

2724
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:33,290
Alright.

2725
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:35,410
These two fighters are coming up.

2726
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:36,650
We're gonna see how this goes.

2727
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:37,290
Dude.

2728
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:41,250
I feel like his opponents just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

2729
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:42,550
First was Snuffy.

2730
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:45,070
And she's like a normal-sized kind of human, right?

2731
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,170
Right?

2732
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:46,770
And then after that, Nana.

2733
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:52,590
And now a little like... I don't know how many more times this guy can take down.

2734
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:54,030
People come in many different shapes and sizes.

2735
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:57,710
You're barely tall enough to get above the casting fence.

2736
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:59,830
In this corner, winning back to back.

2737
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:01,970
He's mean.

2738
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:03,290
He's green.

2739
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:05,250
You know him.

2740
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,370
It's Fuyo Man!

2741
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:15,450
For the third time, this man comes out spinning in circles and hitting poses.

2742
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:16,550
Is he going to take a dump?

2743
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:19,230
And there it is.

2744
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:21,690
And now he's ready for combat.

2745
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:24,830
Oh my goodness.

2746
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:26,350
He makes the crowd quiver.

2747
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:28,050
Everybody's at unease.

2748
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:33,130
They don't know whether to root, cheer, cry, celebrate, text their loved ones.

2749
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:34,570
They don't know what's going to happen.

2750
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:37,350
But Fuyo Man is going to make it freaking happen.

2751
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:37,730
He's going to be legendary.

2752
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:40,830
I just want to see what's under the hat at this point.

2753
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:41,630
I'm really curious.

2754
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:43,010
What's he got underneath there?

2755
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:58,370
The man, the myth, the legend, the leprechaun, Fuyo Man taking the stage, showing off why he is now a two consecutive win winner and perhaps maybe even three today.

2756
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:03,510
And returning all the way from her dungeon, it's your final boss.

2757
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:07,070
But will it be Fuyo Man's final boss?

2758
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:08,750
It's...

2759
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:10,270
Wow.

2760
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:16,700
She comes out with Majestia's Frick.

2761
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:19,700
She looks like the final boss of an Elden Ring franchise game.

2762
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,120
She's intimidating.

2763
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:28,280
Lady royalty herself, Emma, about to show what this doctor's appointment will diagnose us with.

2764
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,880
Absolute queenship here.

2765
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,820
Look at that form.

2766
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,200
Look at the professionalism.

2767
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:34,160
Look at the posture.

2768
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,500
This bitch is here to win.

2769
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:39,900
Her jewelry kind of looks like a collection of weapons.

2770
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:39,960
I'm going to go with the one that's going to be the most popular.

2771
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:40,060
I'm going to go with the one that's going to be the most popular.

2772
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:46,200
I don't know if she's gonna be allowed to keep those on during the fight, but hey, I mean, they make custom rules themselves, so we'll see how this goes down.

2773
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh, she's... she's above getting on the ring herself.

2774
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:50,820
You will... you will let her in.

2775
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:52,080
You will be appropriate here.

2776
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,480
You will let a lady into the ring.

2777
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,100
No one's going to have her on the ropes.

2778
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:56,420
Chivalry is dead.

2779
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,420
All right, slay the crown.

2780
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,560
Oh, my God, she's working the crowd right now.

2781
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,300
Someone in the crowd just passed out.

2782
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:06,500
Oh, yes.

2783
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:07,700
Take her crown.

2784
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,940
Take her throne.

2785
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:27,660
Oh, Fuyo!

2786
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,080
Come on, it's Dexter!

2787
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:34,560
I mean, this inspection is his fist with her face, but she kicks him in the nuts, so she knows a thing or two about anatomy also.

2788
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,800
And she just slam-dogs him!

2789
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,620
I think the fight's over.

2790
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,400
Never mind, this man gets up.

2791
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,580
How is this possible?

2792
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,920
Emma has been watching Fuyo-man's last matches.

2793
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,920
She might be able to know how to mind game Fuyo-man to a win here.

2794
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,280
She's studied his moves.

2795
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,620
She knows his routine.

2796
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,280
Ooh, but that might not be enough!

2797
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,600
She's reversing the karma on her, disrespecting her at her own game.

2798
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,460
Fuyo-man knows a thing or two about psychic damage himself.

2799
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:04,540
Fuyo-man is at the top of his game right now, and he's showing why he is, right now, ready.

2800
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,380
He's the next Axel Tuber 2024's prodigal son.

2801
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:11,520
I mean, yeah, this guy's on that thing CSI Miami's most wanted right now.

2802
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,780
Oh my god!

2803
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:16,600
Wait, not the rope!

2804
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:17,920
Oh my god!

2805
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,620
He just clipped her skull through three different layers of rope!

2806
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:23,660
I mean, that's gotta be some quantum physics involvement right there.

2807
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,420
This man is breaking rods.

2808
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,760
He almost just shattered the game devs' fabrication of this level.

2809
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,940
I was worried the whole game was in a crouch, but this guy's getting mounted and beaten to a pulp.

2810
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:32,260
Oh my god!

2811
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:34,540
I mean, he's doing the Omni-Man versus Invincible.

2812
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:35,920
He's doing 40 years speech right now.

2813
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,440
Jesus Christ!

2814
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:39,980
He's getting flipped over?

2815
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:40,900
Stared at?

2816
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,280
I... okay?

2817
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,540
Getting ridden like a piggy bank?

2818
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:44,360
I don't really know.

2819
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:45,900
Uh... oh, he got a jump!

2820
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:46,800
Yana's starting it off strong.

2821
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,860
She's not even letting Fuyo-man have a chance here.

2822
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,060
Oh!

2823
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:52,420
But Fuyo-man is signature with the jabs.

2824
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,760
You know that's his trick move.

2825
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,180
Whenever someone gets on top, he finds a way to get out.

2826
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:57,960
He knows, yeah!

2827
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,100
Whether it's the knee, the foot, or the elbow, he's always quick with the jabs.

2828
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,580
He counters.

2829
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,480
And now he's cranking the hog.

2830
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,420
He's doing this one for the fans.

2831
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,300
That's for sure.

2832
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:10,400
And Nana's gonna get back up and see if she can handle this.

2833
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,180
I didn't think she'd roll.

2834
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,100
He's getting pinned!

2835
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,900
My man got epic scorpion, but it wasn't even close.

2836
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:16,320
Not even for a second.

2837
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:17,840
I mean, wrestling.

2838
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:20,720
This is looking more like a cuddle match at this point.

2839
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,380
Can we see a little bit more aggression?

2840
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,600
Oh my goodness.

2841
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:25,760
Stop kissing in the bedroom and telling.

2842
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,540
I wanna see some bloodshed.

2843
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:29,080
I wanna see some bones breaking.

2844
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:30,560
Fuyo-man, destroy!

2845
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,080
Stands her back up.

2846
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,540
Puts her down.

2847
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:35,940
He's going for the elbow shatter.

2848
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,220
That's a really strong move.

2849
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,360
It can break a ligament, I think.

2850
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,100
I don't know.

2851
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:39,400
Oh yeah.

2852
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:40,500
Ooh!

2853
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:44,580
Fuyo-man aims to put every single opponent down for the count.

2854
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,520
He does not want to see them at work tomorrow.

2855
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,600
He wants them to be calling off.

2856
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,420
He knew she was leaving the arena, and he caught her out.

2857
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,180
Oh my god!

2858
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,360
Fuyo-man countering every move Emma throws out.

2859
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:57,900
That's insane.

2860
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,000
And just gets slammed over the stairs.

2861
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:03,160
And she's back in the arena.

2862
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,500
I think she's hoping for a timeout.

2863
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,500
Fuyo-man...

2864
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,540
I mean, there's only three seconds.

2865
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:09,500
...gives his composure together.

2866
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,180
One second.

2867
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,400
Give Emma a little bit of time to...

2868
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,920
Okay, and there he goes.

2869
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:14,120
Yep.

2870
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:15,880
His composure fully filled now.

2871
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,860
And instantly slamming her head into the ring.

2872
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,300
Okay.

2873
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:20,120
Ooh!

2874
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,040
But Fuyo-man can't get ahead of himself.

2875
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,680
She's no setback.

2876
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:24,700
Let's go!

2877
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:25,680
Let's see.

2878
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:25,960
Ooh!

2879
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:26,980
Oh no!

2880
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,100
It's a counter again!

2881
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:29,600
Always quick with the counter.

2882
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:30,220
Damn!

2883
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,360
Oh my goodness!

2884
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,560
And he's not letting her go.

2885
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,380
The crotch grab.

2886
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,960
She can care like a pussy, Buzz Lightyear fan.

2887
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,260
Oh my god.

2888
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:40,780
Donald Trump can take a page out of this one.

2889
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,540
But he's going for the pin right now.

2890
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:42,920
Whoa!

2891
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,300
Another quick Fuyo!

2892
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:45,300
Oh my god.

2893
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:45,380
Not quite.

2894
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:48,140
I thought he made quick business and jam out of her.

2895
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,340
Just like the last match.

2896
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:49,800
But no.

2897
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:52,340
Emma's gonna show us what she's made out of.

2898
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:54,060
Is he going for the teabag?

2899
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:54,480
Hopefully crunchy peanut butter.

2900
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:55,340
Oh no!

2901
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,840
It could be jam.

2902
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:00,180
And Fuyo-man spreading it on his toast for breakfast.

2903
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:02,340
The whiplash slingshot.

2904
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:03,060
She's dazed.

2905
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:03,860
I don't understand how much...

2906
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:04,300
Oh!

2907
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:05,720
Oh my god.

2908
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,960
She's got abducted in reverse.

2909
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,100
And she's getting picked up.

2910
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:08,940
Pause on the ground.

2911
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,440
Is it gonna be a pin?

2912
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,660
No, it's gonna be a curve saw maneuver.

2913
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,540
She flies across the room with a Superman punch!

2914
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,960
Is that lights out?

2915
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,780
One, two!

2916
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:17,640
Fuyo-man!

2917
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,780
Oh my god.

2918
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:22,900
She was one second away from putting down Fuyo's reign of terror.

2919
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,600
And now she's staring at him.

2920
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:27,280
Fuyo-man is a survivor.

2921
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:28,700
Okay.

2922
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,180
She might show bruising blood.

2923
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:31,360
But he...

2924
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,200
Oh my god.

2925
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:32,800
He's quivering.

2926
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:33,380
He's shaking.

2927
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:33,940
He's begging.

2928
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,120
If this goes on for much longer, he might tap out.

2929
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,080
But not quite.

2930
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,360
The fight still goes on.

2931
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:40,260
Dude, that could have been a serious timeout.

2932
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:40,700
Okay.

2933
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:41,620
And she landed this.

2934
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:42,920
And she tried to put her pits up to the nose.

2935
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,620
But Fuyo-man said he smelled worse.

2936
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:45,480
Oh my god.

2937
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:48,060
She just dropped her entire body weight on him.

2938
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,220
And she's gonna do it again.

2939
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:51,240
She said, take a whiff of this.

2940
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:52,440
Oh my...

2941
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:52,920
Woo!

2942
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:54,540
Oh, she didn't...

2943
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:54,760
She didn't...

2944
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,600
She spared him.

2945
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,380
She spared him.

2946
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,780
She just skipped over him.

2947
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:58,380
Okay.

2948
01:50:58,920 --> 01:50:59,360
Oh!

2949
01:50:59,480 --> 01:50:59,920
Oh!

2950
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,560
Oh my god.

2951
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,340
And Fuyo is just...

2952
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:03,020
She's showing why you don't skip.

2953
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:04,060
Oh my god.

2954
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:08,300
I feel like I'm watching a John Wick movie right now with the amount of exchanges that are taking place right here.

2955
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:09,440
Oh my...

2956
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,280
Oh my god!

2957
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:10,840
What was that?

2958
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,560
She just did some sort of Tekken move on him.

2959
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,160
That was insane.

2960
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,180
That was a Wily Lee's Sun Kick, I believe.

2961
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,720
Um, I saw that one in Naruto.

2962
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,840
And this man climbs up on the poles just to get beaten down by her even more.

2963
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:23,380
Just can you remember versus her?

2964
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:26,560
She's about to snap her in half again like a Twinkie.

2965
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:27,340
I...

2966
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:28,380
Will he get the move off completely?

2967
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:29,960
He's not sure if he can get the footing here.

2968
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:31,320
Can he make it off?

2969
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:32,060
What's Emma doing?

2970
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,160
Nana's fighting back for sure.

2971
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,160
What's happening?

2972
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,040
Oh my god, just tiring her out?

2973
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:36,920
What was that?

2974
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,000
I don't know.

2975
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,520
Stretching her body like a masseuse?

2976
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:43,660
I mean, this dude's performing like a sumo wrestler right now.

2977
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:47,160
Fuyo man is wanting Emma to beg for forgiveness.

2978
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,380
Oh, and he's not done yet.

2979
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,340
He's about to...

2980
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,520
Oh no.

2981
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,180
Oh no.

2982
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,180
Oh no, the Fuyo signature.

2983
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:55,000
Emma's in a pin!

2984
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:55,500
She's in a pin!

2985
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,320
One, two, Emma fight!

2986
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,960
Oh no, no, no.

2987
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:01,320
It could have ended right there.

2988
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,320
That was so close.

2989
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:05,340
But Emma seems to be freeing the arena again.

2990
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,300
She's pulling herself on the outside of the wires.

2991
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,360
If she gets punched here, she could fall off.

2992
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,800
The reversal!

2993
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,880
She counters him in his own game!

2994
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,200
One!

2995
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:16,000
Could it be?

2996
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:16,560
Two!

2997
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:17,660
No!

2998
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,960
Fuyo man is not a quitter!

2999
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,360
I mean, every single count goes to at least two nowadays.

3000
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,340
It's only going to take one moment from the hit of three count at this point.

3001
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:26,680
They're both...

3002
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,080
Yeah, they're both on the ropes here.

3003
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,560
This is...

3004
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:29,480
This is getting close.

3005
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,080
Literally.

3006
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:32,120
Oh wait, that's the whole point of the thing.

3007
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,060
But they're going to go in and snap his ankle!

3008
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:35,980
I don't even know what happened.

3009
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:37,600
I think like, it seems like he is feeling it.

3010
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,400
Emma has definitely done some damage here.

3011
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:40,940
I think he might have crippled him.

3012
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,240
Oh my goodness.

3013
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:43,680
Oh!

3014
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,680
She shoots high on the head kick!

3015
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:49,180
But apparently it was so intimidating, Fuyo falls over anyway.

3016
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,860
I believe in Emma.

3017
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,340
She's got some fierce kicks.

3018
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:55,880
And those shoes don't look comfortable to get hit by.

3019
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:57,440
She's grabbing Fuyo man.

3020
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,340
This could be it.

3021
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,460
Fuyo man cannot be hit by Emma's kick.

3022
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:00,200
Emma does not counter this.

3023
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,700
There's no cheap shots here.

3024
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:02,380
Oh!

3025
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:06,800
And she's making it so Emma knows now what Fuyo man's game is.

3026
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:07,800
She knows how to win.

3027
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:12,640
She knows not to give Fuyo the upper hand by getting a counter option here.

3028
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,520
Let's see if she can win it here.

3029
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,880
The chiropractic spinal repair just came out of her.

3030
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,700
Now she's doing another chiropractic move.

3031
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:23,080
I mean this guy's getting adjusted from the inside out.

3032
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:26,160
Somebody get Fuyo man's physician on the phone.

3033
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:26,500
Oh!

3034
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,820
And he's still in the match!

3035
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:29,440
Oh my god!

3036
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:30,400
Holy moly.

3037
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,360
And now Fuyo man's running for his own life.

3038
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,660
It might be his turn to flee out of the arena for once.

3039
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:37,300
But I mean he gets a good hit on Emma.

3040
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,180
Flip throw.

3041
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,860
Oh my god!

3042
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:40,900
I saw bread!

3043
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:41,940
I saw blood!

3044
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:43,960
I think this might be it ladies and gentlemen.

3045
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:44,820
Emma might be out.

3046
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:46,460
One, two, three!

3047
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:51,960
Fuyo man wins three times in a row!

3048
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,380
Fuyo man cannot be stopped!

3049
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:00,760
Back to back to back!

3050
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:02,560
Your winner!

3051
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,360
Kindness is cool.

3052
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:15,340
I think Fuyo man is a great leader to take this match.

3053
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:18,680
Fuyo man making insane waves here right now.

3054
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,080
Three back to back to back sweeps here.

3055
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:26,560
Fuyo man is on fire and does not look like they're letting up at any point.

3056
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,800
Who can stop Fuyo man?

3057
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,320
Who can take the win?

3058
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,200
Yeah.

3059
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:32,580
So I mean some people out there they say Ronaldo's a goat.

3060
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,720
Some people say Messi.

3061
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,880
But to me Fuyo's my goat.

3062
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:37,260
I'm not gonna lie.

3063
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:39,680
I mean this man has been on an absolute rampage.

3064
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:41,640
He's just torn through three people.

3065
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:46,100
I don't know faster than like geez an effing bull in a china shop.

3066
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,920
I mean this man is a force of nature.

3067
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:53,000
Let's bring it back over I think in a little bit to see how this post game breaks down.

3068
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,760
Fuyo man sweeeep.

3069
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,480
Holy shit.

3070
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,440
Emma how are you feeling after that match?

3071
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,380
No way.

3072
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,320
This can't be.

3073
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:11,000
I lost to a little guy called Fuyo man.

3074
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:15,200
I wasn't supposed to be this easily defeated.

3075
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,440
But he's too powerful maybe because he's too green.

3076
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:21,400
I can never defeat a green guy.

3077
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:25,240
That's it!

3078
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,800
Dungeon raid is closed!

3079
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:28,240
No one can come in anymore!

3080
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:32,880
I'm gonna go take my rest, gonna respawn, gonna go to chiropractic and everything.

3081
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:34,500
Gonna enjoy the nature.

3082
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,920
But I'm gonna be afraid of green.

3083
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:38,160
No, I'm gonna stay at home.

3084
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,120
I'm gonna cry.

3085
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,480
I hate green.

3086
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:41,360
Green is horrible.

3087
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,400
Yo man, your response?

3088
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:45,980
Kindness is cool.

3089
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,400
Green is cool.

3090
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:49,220
Throw them and destroy.

3091
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:54,820
I must say, Emma, how did it feel having this tiny little three-incher all over you?

3092
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:56,480
A what?

3093
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:00,860
Hail it up and you're next.

3094
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:08,560
Fuyo is more Santa than Dwayne the Rock Johnson and he's winning just as much.

3095
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:09,440
This is crazy.

3096
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:12,360
Emma, don't be afraid to eat your greens.

3097
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:14,860
Spinach might make your match a win next time.

3098
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:15,480
Don't worry.

3099
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:19,200
Fuyo man is a legend though and I'm excited to see you win.

3100
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:22,700
I'm excited to see what more he conquers in this WrestleTuber 24.

3101
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:23,840
Whoa.

3102
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,680
Vegetables are horrible.

3103
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:28,080
Just like Fuyo man.

3104
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,040
It's okay Fuyo man.

3105
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:35,180
I wish you suffer eating vegetables forever.

3106
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:37,440
Eat your veggies.

3107
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:41,380
No, Fuyo man.

3108
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,400
I will take my rest.

3109
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:47,780
Dungeon raid will be closed for a week, for a month, for a year, for decades.

3110
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:51,820
Fuyo man is banned in my dungeon.

3111
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,160
No more Fuyo man.

3112
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:55,660
Dang.

3113
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:57,180
Fuyo man understands.

3114
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,580
Fuyo man.

3115
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:04,840
How does it feel being one of the first finalists for the WrestleTuber?

3116
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,220
A normal Sunday.

3117
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:11,640
Wow, I love that confidence.

3118
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:16,860
I guess Emma loves a man with confidence.

3119
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:19,820
No wonder she folded.

3120
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:21,640
He is very confident.

3121
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:23,720
Even though it's the intercise.

3122
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,840
Alright, well...

3123
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:31,640
Wait, so what do we have coming up next?

3124
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,200
Are we...

3125
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,120
We have...

3126
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:38,200
It looks like our next match I think is with...

3127
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,700
Is this Luto again?

3128
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,520
Luto running it back.

3129
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,540
I'm not sure who his opponent is today.

3130
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:46,100
Let me see.

3131
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:46,540
Let me check.

3132
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:46,840
Let me check.

3133
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:47,520
Check the broadcast.

3134
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:52,200
We're getting word that it is Luto versus Anon.

3135
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:53,100
Anon?

3136
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:54,100
Anon?

3137
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:55,460
Anon?

3138
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:55,860
Anon?

3139
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:56,560
Who is Anon?

3140
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:57,460
Anon.

3141
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:58,340
Anon.

3142
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,480
Ooh.

3143
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,880
They look mighty saucy though.

3144
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:03,060
This is gonna be a good match.

3145
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:08,900
Fuyoman finally getting a well-deserved rest after a three back-to-back win here.

3146
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:12,600
We might see more wins from Fuyoman, but for now...

3147
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:15,220
we're starting it up with a different match today.

3148
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:16,020
We have...

3149
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:18,740
Luto versus...

3150
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:19,960
Anon.

3151
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:21,080
Anon.

3152
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:21,880
Anon?

3153
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:22,460
Anon?

3154
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,120
I believe it's Anon.

3155
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:25,400
We'll have to ask them what their preferred pronouns are.

3156
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,340
We'll find out here.

3157
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,080
Dang!

3158
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,200
What is this, Luto?

3159
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:33,120
Luto, you are way too dressed up to be fighting someone to the death right now.

3160
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:34,660
I mean, you look extravagant.

3161
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:36,420
Oh, yes.

3162
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:37,160
Oh, what's that?

3163
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:37,820
Wait, hold on.

3164
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:38,900
What?

3165
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,520
Okay, that was Anon, I believe.

3166
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,360
Sorry.

3167
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:42,980
Anon?

3168
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:43,300
Yes?

3169
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:44,980
Oh, my bad.

3170
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:46,460
I got too excited.

3171
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,280
Wait a second.

3172
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:49,840
Who are you?

3173
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,200
I'm not.

3174
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,000
I'm not.

3175
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:53,680
You impersonated someone?

3176
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,660
A master of impersonation.

3177
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:56,820
No, no, no.

3178
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:58,560
I would never.

3179
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:01,300
Interesting.

3180
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,000
All right.

3181
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:04,320
And we have also here Luto.

3182
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:05,420
Yes.

3183
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:07,720
Luto, welcome back.

3184
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:08,200
Welcome back.

3185
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:10,720
So, what are your records so far in the tournament, guys?

3186
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,700
How have you guys done so far?

3187
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:12,740
Is it like one and one?

3188
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:14,960
I believe Luto maybe has won... has won one.

3189
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:14,960
I believe Luto maybe has won one.

3190
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,420
Has won two?

3191
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:16,540
Luto, is it true?

3192
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:16,760
Two.

3193
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:17,280
One or two?

3194
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:18,440
One.

3195
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:19,300
One?

3196
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:19,660
Okay.

3197
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:20,080
We got the one.

3198
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:20,540
Yeah.

3199
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,940
Both are at one win.

3200
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,120
So, this is a pretty interesting match.

3201
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:28,200
We'll see who's truly stronger here then to win two matches rather than one.

3202
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:31,400
Were you just lucky or is this a true test of skill?

3203
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:32,640
Let's find out.

3204
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:35,460
Well, how are you feeling?

3205
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,260
I just want to say, Sao Sao Hall wrestlers, Shenzai Wario, being chilling.

3206
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:41,160
Okay, I'm not.

3207
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,820
I cannot lose.

3208
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:43,280
Oh, my God.

3209
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,600
I cannot fucking lose you.

3210
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:46,440
A brawl is forming.

3211
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,360
Oh, I'm trying to Spirit Bomb right now.

3212
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:51,160
I mean, God power anime and China on her side.

3213
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:52,260
I'm trying.

3214
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:56,160
I better see you beat me hard then, Luto.

3215
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:57,340
If you dare.

3216
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:01,000
I'm gonna sit on you with my stinky guy, but you ain't gonna see.

3217
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,420
Do it.

3218
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,520
I dare you.

3219
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,340
Do it and also choke me while you're at it.

3220
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:07,040
Okay.

3221
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:08,780
Fuck yeah.

3222
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,480
I'm so bad.

3223
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:13,500
Oh, God.

3224
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,860
You guys are all diaper abusers.

3225
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:18,740
This might be a fight to remember, chat.

3226
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:21,020
Our talent here, they are fierce.

3227
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:26,280
They are fire and they are ripping each other apart in the backstage right now.

3228
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:28,360
What will that say about the match?

3229
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:29,640
Oh, I'm excited.

3230
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:30,480
How are you?

3231
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:34,680
Dude, I want to see them murder each other.

3232
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:39,140
I will murder her right with my ass.

3233
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,280
Oh, yes.

3234
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,760
Wait, can you bring in a weapon too?

3235
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:44,700
Not me.

3236
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:46,140
I have my tail.

3237
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:49,380
Is that good enough?

3238
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:50,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3239
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,340
Hit me with that too.

3240
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:51,920
Hit me with that too.

3241
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:53,000
Okay, I got you.

3242
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:53,540
I got you.

3243
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,200
Oh, thank you.

3244
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:56,980
I mean, no thank you.

3245
02:00:57,140 --> 02:00:58,460
That's... that'd be awful.

3246
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:01,860
Actually, I wouldn't want that.

3247
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:06,520
I also don't want to hold hands with you in bed and gloveless.

3248
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:09,260
Will you not change the title of this stream?

3249
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,920
Wrestling on Sex.

3250
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:12,440
All right, all right.

3251
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:12,740
I'm gonna go.

3252
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:13,620
I can do that.

3253
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,800
I can do that.

3254
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,560
Thank you Gamer South for sponsoring today's stream.

3255
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:21,220
Make sure to use code SNACKER for 10% off at the discount section.

3256
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:22,800
Whoa.

3257
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:24,260
That was fun.

3258
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:26,700
Let's get to the fight.

3259
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:27,420
Let's go.

3260
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:37,320
All right, Snuffy.

3261
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:38,940
Here it is.

3262
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:42,740
We got someone that looks like a crash test dummy versus the third one.

3263
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,960
I'm not even sure who's gonna win at this point.

3264
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,620
I could not tell you which one is which.

3265
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,960
Now let's see them kill each other.

3266
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:50,940
True.

3267
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:56,380
I believe none is gonna be the one with the bunny ears, but let's see it.

3268
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:02,860
In this corner, it's the diaper from hell.

3269
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:08,580
The spawn of the demon lord himself, the Crimson Devil.

3270
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:11,340
Hey!

3271
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:12,120
Hey!

3272
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:12,740
Hey!

3273
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,420
It's LUTO!

3274
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,060
Absolutely extravagant.

3275
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:22,200
This guy's just Fuyo, but on a whole different level of zesty.

3276
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,600
I mean, this person's coming in for the effing crown.

3277
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,240
It looks like they got their horns from a CSGO loot crate.

3278
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:32,280
I mean, there's a lot of effing bling bling on this bad boy.

3279
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:36,280
You know, I almost want to see it.

3280
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:40,080
I feel like somebody, this is somebody who truly rivals Fuyo Man's energy.

3281
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:44,580
And I think if anybody was to bring Fuyo Man's energy, a decent match, it could be Luto.

3282
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:47,900
Luto might be able to match the swagger of Fuyo Man.

3283
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,480
But we will see if Luto has what it takes to win it all and see him in the ring.

3284
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:58,440
Or will Luto collapse and we'll see another hero rise to the occasion in the form of NAN.

3285
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:02,260
Why is Luto wearing a coffee filter around her neck?

3286
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:08,120
I believe that's an old Victorian tissue for sneezing into.

3287
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:08,540
See?

3288
02:03:08,860 --> 02:03:09,400
Okay.

3289
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,980
He just did a really epic strategy.

3290
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:11,760
Just like...

3291
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:14,160
And then you just look upwards.

3292
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:17,540
And it just absorbs the entire radius of the explosion.

3293
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:19,300
So they can wipe the blood off on it.

3294
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:19,560
I see.

3295
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:20,440
It's similar to the diaper.

3296
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:20,700
Yeah.

3297
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:26,120
It's basically Luto is going for a full Versile equipment standard here.

3298
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,880
And making their way to the stage.

3299
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:33,940
All the way from Wonderland.

3300
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:37,400
Hopping into the ring.

3301
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:41,360
It's NANANA.

3302
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:46,170
Dang.

3303
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:48,670
I don't know what's going on.

3304
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:51,710
But this is like a nothing Yu Ji Ha clan member.

3305
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:52,630
The outfit.

3306
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:55,750
NAN is giving us a bit of sauce here.

3307
02:03:56,050 --> 02:03:58,630
I like the face on the ass.

3308
02:03:58,930 --> 02:03:59,770
Very iconic.

3309
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:02,890
She said, I know where you're looking and meet my gaze.

3310
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:05,250
Oh yeah, we're making eye contact right now.

3311
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:07,150
She's kinda like my grandma.

3312
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:10,030
She probably smells like her too.

3313
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:12,350
I imagined at least like death.

3314
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:12,750
Now...

3315
02:04:13,450 --> 02:04:13,890
Ooh.

3316
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,490
A little bit of sauce.

3317
02:04:15,730 --> 02:04:17,830
NAN is looking pretty confident coming into this fight.

3318
02:04:17,970 --> 02:04:19,250
I'd like to see her stir it up.

3319
02:04:19,350 --> 02:04:20,650
She's got one win under her belt.

3320
02:04:20,770 --> 02:04:22,370
So this is not new to her.

3321
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:25,470
I do like the purple gas that's everywhere.

3322
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:28,930
It makes a little bit more mysterious and maybe even smells like peppermint.

3323
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:29,930
But we'll see.

3324
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:30,310
Whoa.

3325
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:34,750
She might be a rabbit, but she's behaving rather catty.

3326
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:36,790
Okay.

3327
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,530
Let's see how this fight unfolds.

3328
02:04:41,530 --> 02:04:42,250
I don't know what to respond.

3329
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:47,090
Wait.

3330
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,130
What's getting started?

3331
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:49,410
Lutoh's just keepin' on the claws.

3332
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:51,590
You see that chunk?

3333
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:53,830
I'm back on.

3334
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:54,990
It is.

3335
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:59,310
I mean these people kind of look like Five Nights at Freddy's characters.

3336
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:02,290
But they are already delivering the animatronic beat down.

3337
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:03,310
Oh my god!

3338
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:06,730
Lutoh might be dressed like a Walmart children's bicycle.

3339
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:09,970
But she is delivering like a semi truck.

3340
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:11,030
Absolutely.

3341
02:05:11,030 --> 02:05:11,230
Absolutely.

3342
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:15,890
And I thought like at the first like, Nan was going to be in serious danger because of the size difference.

3343
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:21,050
But I mean, Nan knows her angles and she's already doing some big damage on Ludo's extremities.

3344
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:25,350
I mean, she might take down her weak point one by one like Johnny Appleseed cutting down a tree.

3345
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:26,630
Oh, my God.

3346
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:30,290
It's a brains over brawn type situation here, I think, Philly.

3347
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:37,750
And oh, my gosh, Nan might be smaller, but she outsizes by speed and swiftness with this skill.

3348
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:38,750
Oh, my goodness.

3349
02:05:38,770 --> 02:05:39,810
She's already got him wrapped up.

3350
02:05:39,810 --> 02:05:40,210
Pin!

3351
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:41,350
Two!

3352
02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:41,730
Oh!

3353
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:42,590
There's no way.

3354
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:48,490
Two counts of Zoe would have been insane, but Ludo's already fleeing the arena and Nan wants none of it.

3355
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:50,810
This person will stop at the end of the Earth to kill you.

3356
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:50,970
Oh, my God!

3357
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:52,730
A little front flip.

3358
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:53,790
Oh!

3359
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:56,630
I think her face is caved in.

3360
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:57,210
I don't know.

3361
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:02,630
Ludo does have the diaper, so if she shits the bed early, it is going to be able to save her.

3362
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:05,210
That could be the play.

3363
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:06,130
I guess we'll have to see.

3364
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:08,650
And Nan is taunting at the crowd.

3365
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:09,310
No!

3366
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:10,170
Oh, my God!

3367
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:11,330
She got headbutted by the Hordes.

3368
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:12,070
Nan is feeling confident.

3369
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:14,030
And she got the Hordes.

3370
02:06:14,030 --> 02:06:16,310
She played with the Bull and she got the Hordes.

3371
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:18,850
They're having to stare down the sentry.

3372
02:06:18,950 --> 02:06:22,270
Nan disrespectfully gets back into the arena right in front of Ludo.

3373
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:24,450
Doesn't give a single frick in the world.

3374
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:27,170
Alpha Gigantat energy coming out of her.

3375
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:29,710
And we're going up on a Tuesday.

3376
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:34,670
Nan is keeping the segue of this fight strong in her favor.

3377
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:34,990
Jesus!

3378
02:06:34,990 --> 02:06:35,170
Ooh!

3379
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:38,150
And I say that right as she loses her cool.

3380
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:39,790
The Rockstar Splash!

3381
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,450
The Whitsplam!

3382
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:42,130
Oh, my God!

3383
02:06:42,230 --> 02:06:42,970
Ludo going for it!

3384
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:43,130
Ooh!

3385
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:47,750
How many apps can they take up beating this much?

3386
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:52,510
Ludo is treating Nan like a game of hopscotch.

3387
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:53,730
Oh, my...

3388
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:54,150
Oh!

3389
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,410
She won't just stop fucking jumping!

3390
02:06:56,790 --> 02:07:00,310
I mean, she does know her weight is her greatest asset, it looks like, in this fight.

3391
02:07:00,490 --> 02:07:00,890
Oh!

3392
02:07:01,330 --> 02:07:03,970
And Nan is getting the actual beatdown put on her.

3393
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:06,010
Underneath.

3394
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:07,290
Over the top.

3395
02:07:07,650 --> 02:07:08,390
Uh-oh!

3396
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:09,130
Picked up.

3397
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:09,690
And...

3398
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:09,930
Oh!

3399
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:10,490
Oh!

3400
02:07:12,950 --> 02:07:15,690
She's breaking her ankle falling down on top of her.

3401
02:07:16,530 --> 02:07:17,530
Oh, my God!

3402
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:18,010
Oh, my God!

3403
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:19,910
Weapons out of nowhere stroking the pin!

3404
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:21,790
Ludo getting the steam into a swift...

3405
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:22,010
Ooh!

3406
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:24,750
I mean, Nan might be indestructible.

3407
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:26,170
They're small and dense.

3408
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:27,330
It's like an effing black hole.

3409
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,450
Not just one, but it gets to the second count.

3410
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:32,670
She's still raring and ready to go!

3411
02:07:32,830 --> 02:07:34,830
Let's see what she has to show!

3412
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:35,690
In the board!

3413
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:36,510
Right into the crowd!

3414
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:36,850
Oh!

3415
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:39,510
A little bit of fan service for the people!

3416
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:40,990
The guy in the picture!

3417
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,630
Definitely got a full head of hair there.

3418
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:43,810
Oh, my God!

3419
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:44,910
Maybe even a kiss!

3420
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:47,330
Ooh!

3421
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:50,390
And some blood on your pants!

3422
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:52,730
Oh, my God!

3423
02:07:52,890 --> 02:07:54,470
The joker flip on the ankle.

3424
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:55,230
That was kind of insane.

3425
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:58,250
But it looks like that was a reversal exaggert that Ludo needed.

3426
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:58,950
Just kidding.

3427
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:00,050
Just kidding.

3428
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:03,350
These two are getting dirty with it!

3429
02:08:03,410 --> 02:08:03,670
Okay!

3430
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:05,670
I've never seen the maneuver in my life!

3431
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:08,190
This man's being pulled in 18 different directions!

3432
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:10,510
I'm like watching human origami right now!

3433
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:10,790
Oh, my God!

3434
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:12,890
She's got her strangled right now!

3435
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:13,630
Absolutely!

3436
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:15,010
But she's plunging her in the face!

3437
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:16,250
Oh, she's got her in the eyes!

3438
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:19,890
We're at six seconds.

3439
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:20,810
Can she get back in the arena?

3440
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:24,090
They're using every possible resource to stay alive this match.

3441
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:24,950
If Nani gets back in, it could be over.

3442
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:25,550
Oh!

3443
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:29,030
And Ludo is getting high off the crowd's energy!

3444
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:30,350
Let's go!

3445
02:08:30,350 --> 02:08:31,410
Ludo definitely just formed a clip.

3446
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:32,210
Oh!

3447
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:34,330
Oh!

3448
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:37,690
And the energy is fueling Ludo like a battery!

3449
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:41,410
She's like a vampire sapping after the energy!

3450
02:08:41,610 --> 02:08:43,050
The crowd is fueling her!

3451
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:44,510
Chat is going crazy!

3452
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:45,630
The whispers!

3453
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:45,830
The crowd!

3454
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:46,670
I think Nani's dead!

3455
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:47,910
Nani's dead!

3456
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:50,010
I think Nani's just dead!

3457
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:53,630
Some brain activity, signs of life.

3458
02:08:54,030 --> 02:08:55,950
Ludo's coming down to finish the fight, I guess.

3459
02:08:56,810 --> 02:08:57,310
Oh!

3460
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,710
Oh, Jesus Christ!

3461
02:08:58,710 --> 02:08:59,970
She's not down yet!

3462
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:01,670
She just needed a minute.

3463
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:05,470
Wait, Ludo's on the... begging for mercy right now.

3464
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:06,790
Ludo's a fool to give her the time!

3465
02:09:07,190 --> 02:09:07,690
True.

3466
02:09:08,190 --> 02:09:10,870
A shot like that to the ego could really shake you up mentally!

3467
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:11,930
Are we going to the stands?

3468
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:12,550
No, we're not.

3469
02:09:12,730 --> 02:09:14,210
The Evan caster desk right there?

3470
02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:15,190
That's you and me, Snappy.

3471
02:09:15,190 --> 02:09:15,990
You see us over there?

3472
02:09:16,370 --> 02:09:16,770
Yeah!

3473
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:19,810
But it looks like they're not going to be visiting us today.

3474
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:21,950
Unfortunate.

3475
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:24,410
The steel stairs could be... oh my god!

3476
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:25,870
We do have a fine table for you!

3477
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:27,370
Yeah, for sure.

3478
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:27,390
Oh!

3479
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:28,310
And she's got her by the hair!

3480
02:09:28,470 --> 02:09:29,370
Oh my god!

3481
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:30,350
Nan!

3482
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:32,850
Is absolutely killing her!

3483
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:35,570
I'm watching Killer Instinct unfold in real-time!

3484
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:36,970
What's happening?

3485
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:36,970
What's happening?

3486
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:38,550
She's getting abducted back in the arena?

3487
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:40,050
Oh my god!

3488
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:42,430
Nan said, I'm not done yet.

3489
02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:43,830
I don't want this match to end.

3490
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:45,130
I still have something to show.

3491
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:46,710
Said you don't want Nan to lose.

3492
02:09:46,730 --> 02:09:47,250
Oh, a murder!

3493
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:49,130
And he's going slamming the face down.

3494
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:52,690
He's just staring at her.

3495
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:54,370
Again.

3496
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:56,470
Did they just high five each other?

3497
02:09:57,450 --> 02:09:57,890
Okay.

3498
02:09:58,030 --> 02:09:59,130
Oh my god!

3499
02:09:59,450 --> 02:09:59,770
Oh!

3500
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:01,390
The counter punches!

3501
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:04,110
Nan's taking two, three, and she's out.

3502
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:07,110
Oh my god!

3503
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:09,050
And it's non-stopped!

3504
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:12,950
She looks like she's dropping thunder.

3505
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:14,270
She's just jumping on the back and shaking her.

3506
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:16,730
Oh, almost the wind for Nan, but she's still going!

3507
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:19,670
The armbar?

3508
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,290
The armbar?

3509
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,310
I don't really know.

3510
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:23,450
That maneuver was very effective.

3511
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:24,430
You can't just hold it on her fingers.

3512
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:26,010
And the screen has gone black.

3513
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:28,870
And Lucho has... What just happened?

3514
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:29,350
Oh no!

3515
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:30,410
The turnaround!

3516
02:10:31,530 --> 02:10:32,810
Was that a technical foul?

3517
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:33,870
They reset back to neutral?

3518
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:36,010
Jesus, what just happened?

3519
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:40,550
Lucho just mind wiped the entire crowd and reset the match!

3520
02:10:40,890 --> 02:10:41,550
No way!

3521
02:10:42,570 --> 02:10:44,150
Devil mind tricks!

3522
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:45,130
True!

3523
02:10:46,590 --> 02:10:50,670
The hold person is a really effective ability as it turns out.

3524
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:52,430
I think Nan might be out.

3525
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:55,330
Nan doesn't even know where she is anymore!

3526
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:56,590
Oh no!

3527
02:10:57,870 --> 02:10:59,250
What is happening?

3528
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:03,280
The physics should not allow for that!

3529
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,640
This is like an epic bowling fly!

3530
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:08,980
And we are back to playing hopscotch with her.

3531
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:09,780
I think Nan is dead.

3532
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:10,540
Oh my god!

3533
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:13,140
Using her body like gravel!

3534
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:16,260
I don't know if Nan gets up from this one.

3535
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:19,520
Nan is not looking good!

3536
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:21,800
I believe I'm seeing a little bit of blood here even.

3537
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:23,360
This is a gruesome one.

3538
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:25,320
Oh my goodness!

3539
02:11:25,660 --> 02:11:26,280
Elbow slams!

3540
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:26,920
It's a slaughter!

3541
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:29,020
Lucho is not letting up!

3542
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:30,020
It's not okay!

3543
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:30,900
No!

3544
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:33,180
And the win goes to Lucho!

3545
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:35,380
Holy moly!

3546
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:36,440
Holy moly!

3547
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:40,420
The diaper meta is real!

3548
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,780
Your winner is...

3549
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:44,340
Your winner is...

3550
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:45,560
Lucho!

3551
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:55,050
Lucho!

3552
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:55,650
My god!

3553
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:59,330
Someone get this one on an effing Taylor Swift track!

3554
02:11:59,410 --> 02:12:00,330
This guy has got lungs too!

3555
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:01,770
Let me see.

3556
02:12:01,870 --> 02:12:04,870
Let's go back to the audience or our casters for the post interview.

3557
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:06,590
I'm effing ready for this junk.

3558
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:07,310
Snuffy!

3559
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:11,850
Did you expect the diaper meta to really make it to the finals twice?

3560
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:11,970
Did you expect the diaper meta to really make it to the finals twice?

3561
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:12,890
Wait, no.

3562
02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:14,490
It's just one match from the finals, right?

3563
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:16,530
You were really almost there.

3564
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:18,130
I'm surprised!

3565
02:12:18,530 --> 02:12:22,890
You know, I guess I would say I was hoping for a little bit more of an upset here.

3566
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:25,810
The last couple matches have seemed pretty set in stone.

3567
02:12:26,050 --> 02:12:26,990
But I'm excited!

3568
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:35,170
I think nothing is more hype than to see two strong components combine each other into one epic fight battle.

3569
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:37,330
Well, what's here for Lucho and Nan?

3570
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:38,170
What's up guys?

3571
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:39,010
How's that fight looking?

3572
02:12:40,230 --> 02:12:41,150
Diaper meta!

3573
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:44,440
Diaper meta!

3574
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:45,260
Let's go!

3575
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:52,340
Nan, how does it feel to not just get beat up by one of your coworkers but two of them?

3576
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:56,900
Let's just say I came for the match and I came from the match.

3577
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:57,320
Oh!

3578
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:03,240
I feel like I just lost something!

3579
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:10,000
I must say Lucho, your stamina is insane.

3580
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,100
But I feel like you'll have...

3581
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:15,100
Are there any opponents that you're looking forward to fighting?

3582
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:19,020
Oh yeah, I'm ready to bring the Irishman down!

3583
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:23,340
Sorry, that's a tall tree to cut down.

3584
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:25,300
I mean, this man has been unstoppable.

3585
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:26,660
Exactly!

3586
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:29,960
We need to get this!

3587
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:33,820
Do you have any plans on taking down Fuyo Man, Lucho?

3588
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:37,920
I think whoever is stinkier gets to take it home, right?

3589
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:41,500
What's the last time you showered?

3590
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:42,020
What's the last time you showered?

3591
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:44,420
Oh, that's classified information!

3592
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:46,020
I can't give you that for free!

3593
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:46,680
Oh, shiiiiit!

3594
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:49,680
Well, you heard it here, folks.

3595
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:51,160
Lucho is indeed...

3596
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,640
horrendously stinky.

3597
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:58,260
I'm covered in pinchling!

3598
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:00,020
I can't lose this!

3599
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:06,360
Alright, well, I'm still in the fight too, so don't forget that.

3600
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:08,440
It's gonna be me versus two diapers, I feel like.

3601
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:10,560
And maybe someone else, I don't quite remember.

3602
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:11,980
We're gonna have to sell clothes.

3603
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:16,500
We'll need to do our Hard Spins with our final match tickets with how stinky our wrestlers are.

3604
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:17,840
What a mess!

3605
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:23,660
Well, any further words, Snappy, before we send it back over to the main desk?

3606
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:24,900
I think that's everything.

3607
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:26,660
That was an amazing match by you two.

3608
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,080
What insane skill.

3609
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:30,960
Thank you both, Lucho and Non, for an amazing fight.

3610
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:32,600
Let's take you back to the main desk.

3611
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:34,140
Thanks, Nogii!

3612
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:35,360
Thank you!

3613
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:38,040
Wooowww!

3614
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:39,060
Okay!

3615
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,720
Is that how you thought that was gonna go?

3616
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:44,480
Wait...

3617
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,720
Who are you rooting for?

3618
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:50,660
Wow guys, that was an insane fight.

3619
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:58,140
You know, I realized when Fuyume was actually not supposed to do a third fight in a row because I messed up the order.

3620
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:03,260
But like, at this point, Fuyume deserves that bye in the final bracket.

3621
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:08,080
Because we were supposed to send Emma and Fuyume to the final bracket.

3622
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:14,400
But you know, after winning three in the fucking row, Fuyume deserves the bye.

3623
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:17,660
I did not expect Fuyume to travel this far.

3624
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:29,860
So, now that I believe we finished all our brackets, let me bring the brackets up onto the screen for all of you guys.

3625
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:32,980
So you guys see what has happened.

3626
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:34,660
So as you guys know...

3627
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:37,860
Oh, I got some fancy graphics going in for all of you.

3628
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:41,100
Alright, so we have...

3629
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:45,560
Sayu did not win, so let me get rid of Sayu's card.

3630
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:48,800
Alright, Luto proceeds here.

3631
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:54,200
And she does the Teleports Behind You Undertaker special.

3632
02:15:54,440 --> 02:16:00,300
So I guess she travels all the way with Fillion in bracket...

3633
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:01,740
I know it says Fillion vs.

3634
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:02,220
Luto.

3635
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:07,920
But if you guys didn't remember, everyone that makes it to the finals here in their bracket...

3636
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,960
Actually gets reshuffled.

3637
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:11,140
So...

3638
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:14,160
I cannot be bothered to realign this.

3639
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,520
But if you guys didn't know...

3640
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,900
Like, Fillion and Luto might not even face each other.

3641
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:19,820
We are going to be spinning a wheel!

3642
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:26,220
We are going to spin a wheel to decide who exactly they are going to be fighting in the end.

3643
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:31,500
So we have Fillion and Luto making it in to the final brackets.

3644
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:33,680
We don't know who they are going to fight though yet.

3645
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:35,000
We are not sure yet.

3646
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:37,420
So that is the results for bracket two.

3647
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:38,700
Bracket one!

3648
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:42,300
Fillionman ends up getting the bye!

3649
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:45,120
Who does send my finals!

3650
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:48,800
Because I made a mistake.

3651
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:53,900
So...

3652
02:16:55,240 --> 02:17:01,320
So let me put in the bracket number one for you guys for the visual.

3653
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:05,520
So as you guys know, we have Fillion beating Nana.

3654
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:07,400
And also beating Everland.

3655
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:13,160
So Fillionman automatically gets the bye to the semi-finals.

3656
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:15,720
Because I made a mistake.

3657
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:18,640
And at that point, Fillionman won three times in a row.

3658
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:20,300
And they deserve that win.

3659
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:28,140
If you win three in a row, you might as well get in to the semis automatically.

3660
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:35,480
So whoever wins their next match in the final bracket will be facing Fillionman.

3661
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:36,340
Finally!

3662
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:39,620
Okay, also for those who need a visual.

3663
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,220
Bam!

3664
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:41,340
Here she is.

3665
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:42,440
Here is Fillion.

3666
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:46,160
So you guys can see it in the visual alone to see how it goes.

3667
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,440
And there she goes.

3668
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:50,960
And then we might as well just put her over Emma because she beat Emma.

3669
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:54,720
So we know only one person is advancing in bracket one.

3670
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:56,680
Finally in bracket three!

3671
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:02,300
We didn't have any matches in bracket three because we actually finished bracket three on day one.

3672
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:04,320
But we'll show you guys who they are.

3673
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:06,380
Who made it into the final.

3674
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:07,940
The final bracket.

3675
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,820
Let me pull up bracket three.

3676
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:10,860
Boom!

3677
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:13,640
And then get rid of Fillion real quick.

3678
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:16,300
It is Sarah and Beto.

3679
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:22,700
So Sarah and Beto are going to be heading over to the final bracket.

3680
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,580
So how are we going to decide this?

3681
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:34,900
Like we said, we will be spinning a wheel of names of all the people that made it to the final bracket.

3682
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:37,400
And I do have somebody here.

3683
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:39,500
As I mentioned earlier today on the stream.

3684
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:41,200
That's going to be helping me.

3685
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:43,780
Helping me spin the wheel.

3686
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:46,400
It will be like that game.

3687
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:47,740
That Wheel of Fortune game.

3688
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:48,820
No, what is it?

3689
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:51,300
Wheel of Fortune game where she will spin the wheel for me.

3690
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,840
And then we'll see who it is.

3691
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,300
Are you in the room?

3692
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,400
Are you in the room my other person?

3693
02:18:57,860 --> 02:18:57,940
Yeah!

3694
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:58,540
I'm here!

3695
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,820
Well the item kind of lost.

3696
02:19:01,860 --> 02:19:02,620
Well the item...

3697
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:03,480
Wait!

3698
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:04,780
Oh my gosh!

3699
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:06,060
Woo!

3700
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,620
Just like a real ghost!

3701
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:09,340
Wow!

3702
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:12,780
Am I good?

3703
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,900
Do I need to move?

3704
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:14,840
Look at where I go.

3705
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:16,980
Woo!

3706
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:23,040
She sneaked her way in.

3707
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:27,880
Were you watching some of the games, Ben?

3708
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:28,960
I was.

3709
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,380
I was watching some of the games.

3710
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:31,660
Which one was your favorite?

3711
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:32,220
What?

3712
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:33,460
I'm back.

3713
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:35,780
I don't know.

3714
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,900
I think Fuyo Man is kind of crazy.

3715
02:19:37,980 --> 02:19:38,980
I know.

3716
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:39,460
I do.

3717
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:40,680
I know.

3718
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:44,960
If I see Fuyo Man in the alley, I don't think I'm going to make it.

3719
02:19:45,180 --> 02:19:45,840
No, I don't.

3720
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:46,440
I think I'm...

3721
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:48,020
I would actually just...

3722
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:49,380
I would kill myself first.

3723
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:50,860
I'll do it for you.

3724
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,540
I'll die by my own hands.

3725
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,240
Yeah.

3726
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,000
I mean it makes sense.

3727
02:19:58,060 --> 02:19:59,040
It's Fuyo Man.

3728
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,320
Like, I'd agree.

3729
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:03,360
Anyway.

3730
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:04,960
So we got our little wheel here.

3731
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:07,320
I haven't wrote anybody's names yet on the wheel.

3732
02:20:08,140 --> 02:20:11,380
So give me a sec as I put... you know, give me a sec.

3733
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:14,620
Tell me some of your favorite moments, Mint, while I write the wheel.

3734
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:16,480
Write the names in the wheel.

3735
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:20,380
Okay, I was half watching and also half eating my spaghetti.

3736
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,820
Let's see... what happened?

3737
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:27,320
Oh gosh.

3738
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:32,660
You just talk about Frio Mad if you want to.

3739
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:35,680
I'm completely prepared as a caster, thank you.

3740
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:40,940
I've heard a lot that there's a bunch of diapers going on.

3741
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:41,820
Oh, that's true.

3742
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:42,220
That's true.

3743
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:43,420
Did you plan that, Doki?

3744
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:45,640
Why would you say that?

3745
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:47,940
Like, what about me and diapers?

3746
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:49,080
I don't know.

3747
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:50,120
I just feel like...

3748
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:56,800
I just get this vibe from you.

3749
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:57,500
I don't know what it is.

3750
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:58,080
This diaper vibe?

3751
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:04,260
I don't know.

3752
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:06,940
Yeah, so there's a bunch of diapers going on.

3753
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:07,920
I think, what is it?

3754
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:10,260
Fillion's going against some diaper people.

3755
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:11,440
Well, we don't know yet.

3756
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:13,420
She might not be though from the wheel.

3757
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:13,840
Oh, true.

3758
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:14,400
The wheel.

3759
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:16,940
Yeah, the wheel decides who they're fighting.

3760
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,520
Am I missing a person?

3761
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:21,900
I think this could tell it's the wheel of the worst.

3762
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:22,500
The wheel.

3763
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:23,380
Here we go.

3764
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,020
It's time to spin that wheel.

3765
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:27,460
Oh, yeah.

3766
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:27,920
Yeah.

3767
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:32,840
We really only need to spin it twice to be fair because like Frio got the automatic buy.

3768
02:21:33,460 --> 02:21:34,320
But, all right.

3769
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:34,840
Here we go.

3770
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:36,000
Spinning that wheel.

3771
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,620
So, is this who's going against Frio?

3772
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:42,200
No, it's who's going... No, Frio gets to buy in the semi-finals.

3773
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:42,400
Oh, yeah.

3774
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:42,680
Okay.

3775
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:43,840
So, it's gonna be Luto.

3776
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,640
Who is Luto gonna fight?

3777
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:47,240
We're gonna find out.

3778
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:48,500
All right.

3779
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:49,700
Who is Luto?

3780
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:52,580
Luto's either gonna fight Fillion, Vettel, or Sarah.

3781
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:03,060
Oh, Luto and Vettel will be our first match.

3782
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:03,440
Oh.

3783
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:09,980
In the finals bracket, which means Fillion will be fighting Sarah in the next fight.

3784
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:11,240
Okay.

3785
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:12,940
She avoided the diaper.

3786
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:13,340
Let's go.

3787
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:13,700
Yeah.

3788
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:14,320
She avoided...

3789
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:16,660
Yeah.

3790
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:18,800
But whoever... Oh, that's true.

3791
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:24,280
That's true because like whoever wins the battle versus Luto will have to fight Frio man.

3792
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:28,780
So, like... So, there won't be two diapers fighting each other in the finals.

3793
02:22:29,260 --> 02:22:30,220
Oh, man.

3794
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:30,860
Yeah.

3795
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:31,400
So...

3796
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:32,780
So...

3797
02:22:33,460 --> 02:22:33,540
Yeah.

3798
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:36,480
And then like... And then I guess like... Wait.

3799
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:41,580
Let's pull out the... Let's pull out the brackets here so we can order this up.

3800
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:42,800
Let me pull it out.

3801
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:43,900
Where is my image here?

3802
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:45,580
I'm very prepared as you see, Mint.

3803
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,260
Very professional.

3804
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:47,540
Yeah.

3805
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:47,540
I know.

3806
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:47,820
And you always are.

3807
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:48,440
I know.

3808
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:48,980
I know.

3809
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:54,880
I mean, of course.

3810
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:56,280
Yeah.

3811
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,700
So, Sarah will be... Okay.

3812
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:01,100
This will be where Frio got the automatic buy.

3813
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,440
And then Sarah and Fillion are...

3814
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:03,620
Yeah.

3815
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:04,160
...down here.

3816
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:06,860
And you see this, right?

3817
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,020
Yeah.

3818
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:08,900
I'm watching your stream.

3819
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:10,880
It's a little... It's a little delayed.

3820
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:11,700
It's a little delay.

3821
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:11,960
Okay.

3822
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:13,160
And then there's Luto here.

3823
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:17,680
Luto is going to be fighting Betel down here.

3824
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:22,820
And then Frio gets to automatically advance.

3825
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:28,100
So, Frio will be fighting whoever wins in the Luto versus Betel.

3826
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:31,480
And then Sarah will be fighting Fillion.

3827
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:32,100
Yeah.

3828
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:33,420
Yeah.

3829
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:33,580
Yes.

3830
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:33,820
All right.

3831
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:34,960
Okay.

3832
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,220
But we do have a problem, Mint.

3833
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:39,300
We do have a little problem here.

3834
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:40,080
What's that?

3835
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:40,700
What's that?

3836
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:40,820
Oh, God.

3837
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:45,060
Is that we are sort of missing two fighters at the bottom.

3838
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:46,340
What?

3839
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:46,780
Oh.

3840
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:47,220
Yeah.

3841
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:48,200
I think I did...

3842
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:48,480
Yeah.

3843
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:50,940
I did like a little miscalculation, Mint.

3844
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:51,600
Uh-oh.

3845
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:52,440
Okay.

3846
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:52,940
Wow.

3847
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:54,160
That's so unbranded for you.

3848
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:54,800
Come on, girl.

3849
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:58,500
She can't... She can't count, you guys.

3850
02:23:58,500 --> 02:23:58,620
Oh, yeah.

3851
02:23:58,760 --> 02:23:59,160
Yeah.

3852
02:23:59,160 --> 02:23:59,400
Yeah.

3853
02:23:59,440 --> 02:23:59,840
Okay.

3854
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:00,200
Look.

3855
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:01,160
I mean...

3856
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:02,880
I was...

3857
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:09,740
I'm gonna say, like, you were... you fucking, like, broke into the arena out of nowhere.

3858
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:14,580
And even though I had a security guard... You killed off all our security guards.

3859
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,240
Like, what was I supposed to do?

3860
02:24:16,260 --> 02:24:18,800
I spent the night hiring a new security guard.

3861
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:20,340
How was I supposed to get in if I didn't kill off the security guards?

3862
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:20,360
Fucking face -throw!

3863
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,340
You're a ghost!

3864
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:22,440
I know.

3865
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:25,760
I just... Like, you know, they were... They were looking at me the wrong way.

3866
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:27,340
I don't know what to tell you.

3867
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:31,640
Well, it's a good thing.

3868
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:31,980
I don't know what to tell you.

3869
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:31,980
Well, it's a good thing.

3870
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:32,240
I don't know what to tell you.

3871
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:32,240
Well, it's a good thing.

3872
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:32,480
I don't know what to tell you.

3873
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:32,480
Well, it's a good thing.

3874
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:36,580
I hired a new security guard to tighten up the security.

3875
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:37,740
You wanna meet him?

3876
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3877
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:39,500
Alright, yeah.

3878
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:39,740
Sure.

3879
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:40,020
Alright.

3880
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:40,640
Camera, guys.

3881
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,320
Bring in... Bring in our new security guard.

3882
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:44,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3883
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:54,420
Matara?

3884
02:24:55,660 --> 02:24:56,100
Wait.

3885
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:58,320
What happened to the security guard I hired?

3886
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:01,240
I'm gonna fight you.

3887
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:02,620
I'm gonna cook you.

3888
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:03,960
I'm gonna eat you.

3889
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:05,320
I'm gonna kick you.

3890
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:06,580
I'm gonna punch you.

3891
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:08,140
I'm gonna throw you off the wall.

3892
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:09,420
I'm gonna pick you up.

3893
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:11,240
I'm gonna twirl you around like a little princess.

3894
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:11,780
Ugh.

3895
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:21,240
Okay.

3896
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:23,720
Mint.

3897
02:25:24,860 --> 02:25:25,340
Uh...

3898
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:30,320
Don't kill me!

3899
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:31,660
Don't kill me!

3900
02:25:32,460 --> 02:25:32,940
Oh.

3901
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:35,400
Ugh.

3902
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:38,400
What did she mean by that?

3903
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,580
Is she gonna eat me?

3904
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:40,920
Or am I gonna eat you?

3905
02:25:40,980 --> 02:25:41,840
What did she mean by that?

3906
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:44,040
I don't know, Mint.

3907
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:46,700
What does she mean by that?

3908
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:50,820
Um...

3909
02:25:50,820 --> 02:25:51,900
What did you do?

3910
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:54,780
What didn't I do?

3911
02:25:57,140 --> 02:25:58,260
Did you...

3912
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:00,540
Did you bring her over here?

3913
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:01,980
Why is she trying...

3914
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:06,180
Why is she trying to kill all the security guards?

3915
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:09,440
I might have told her that we were like having a coup, you know?

3916
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,480
Like that we were...

3917
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:14,020
That I was just like, hey, I'm gonna kill you.

3918
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:17,320
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we like, you know, did our podcast from...

3919
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:18,580
From the wrestling ring?

3920
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,440
In the stadium.

3921
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:20,040
In the ring.

3922
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:20,500
But this one went...

3923
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:22,320
It was already kind of taken, you know?

3924
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:23,240
But we had to...

3925
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:31,100
Well, I guess we have another match to make up the brackets then.

3926
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:35,500
The Podcast Battle of the Century.

3927
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:38,480
Mint versus Matarath.

3928
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:43,720
What's funny is that, like, she's not actually here here at the moment.

3929
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:49,780
No, she like said, hey I'm gonna go on vacation but I'm still gonna kick your ass.

3930
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:58,040
So she said, she said like a spiritual form of her, so to kick Mint's ass.

3931
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:02,060
And she still killed my security guard, so...

3932
02:27:02,060 --> 02:27:05,180
She did enough, yeah she did all that she needed to do.

3933
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:06,320
Yeah, like she...

3934
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:16,080
So unfortunately, unfortunately, now there's no more security left in WrestleTuber.

3935
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:20,500
So, but we don't have any crashes after that I'm pretty sure, right Mint?

3936
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:21,520
Just come on in everybody!

3937
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,640
No, do not come on in everyone!

3938
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:27,960
Do not come on in!

3939
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:29,100
The door is wide open!

3940
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:33,780
I will start selling off Doki's socks, okay?

3941
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:36,300
Again, what do you mean?

3942
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:36,780
What do you mean again?

3943
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:38,580
I didn't say again!

3944
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:39,640
Oh, I said again!

3945
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:43,740
Oh, did this happen before?

3946
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,240
That's what I'm saying!

3947
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,340
I was like, when has this happened before?

3948
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:53,760
Alright guys, before we go off to our final bracket...

3949
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:58,320
We are going to have a 10 minute intermission.

3950
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:05,300
The next two matches will be casted by Kai and Octavio.

3951
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:06,300
And I believe that...

3952
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:07,400
There will be a Fillion match.

3953
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,060
So Fillion really wanted to cast her own match.

3954
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:13,540
So we'll have her jump right in with Kai and Octavio.

3955
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,160
And to cast with them as well.

3956
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:21,640
Anyway guys, we hope you enjoy WrestleTuber so far for day two.

3957
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:26,080
And Mint and I, we will cast the final matches after Octavio and Kai.

3958
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:29,400
So Mint will be casting her own match against Matara.

3959
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,400
Her spiritual form of Matara.

3960
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:35,280
Okay, she's not here.

3961
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:36,000
I can whip her ass.

3962
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:38,400
Wait, what would we do if...

3963
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:40,920
Will you be voicing for Matara?

3964
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:42,640
Yeah, I'll voice for Matara.

3965
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:48,960
Okay, alright, we'll see you guys soon in 10 minutes everybody.

3966
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:50,760
Don't go yet!

3967
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:53,080
The finals are going to be here soon.

3968
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:54,400
See you there!

3969
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:55,880
See you in a bit!

3970
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:14,530
2.

3971
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:19,430
The end of the video The battle between the two teams.

3972
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:19,490
The end of the video is coming!

3973
02:39:19,710 --> 02:39:20,030
The

3974
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:21,780
ending is coming!

3975
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:21,920
The end of the video is coming!

3976
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:23,240
The ending is coming!

3977
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:24,640
The ending is coming!

3978
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:28,800
Oh,

3979
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:47,140
shit, sorry!

3980
02:42:48,300 --> 02:42:50,380
Let me... let me...

3981
02:42:50,380 --> 02:42:51,700
Sorry, sorry.

3982
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:53,760
The intermission was wild.

3983
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:56,940
Oh, wait, it was up on top of me.

3984
02:42:58,660 --> 02:43:00,600
Sorry, we needed a couple extra minutes.

3985
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:10,310
Anyway, welcome back!

3986
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:15,390
Welcome back to day two of WrestleTuber.

3987
02:43:15,410 --> 02:43:20,130
I hope you guys had a nice break during the intermission.

3988
02:43:20,570 --> 02:43:25,330
Be able to stretch your legs, get hydrated, walk around a little bit.

3989
02:43:25,530 --> 02:43:28,870
Because it's already been almost three hours of WrestleTuber.

3990
02:43:29,210 --> 02:43:29,590
Wow.

3991
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:32,270
Yeah, time really flies by.

3992
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:33,830
Oh, a noticement!

3993
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:35,270
You've got headphones!

3994
02:43:35,710 --> 02:43:36,510
Did you buy them from home?

3995
02:43:37,410 --> 02:43:39,050
Uh, no, I made these.

3996
02:43:39,230 --> 02:43:45,310
I ripped them off some guy's head and I spray painted them in the back.

3997
02:43:45,890 --> 02:43:48,490
Yeah, just like how you killed that security guard.

3998
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:53,830
Yeah, I hope you didn't pay like a security deposit or anything.

3999
02:43:53,870 --> 02:43:54,930
Because you're not getting that.

4000
02:43:57,890 --> 02:43:58,990
Oh, it's alright.

4001
02:43:59,150 --> 02:43:59,570
It'll be alright.

4002
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:00,310
It was minimum wage.

4003
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:00,970
It's okay.

4004
02:44:00,970 --> 02:44:01,930
It was minimum wage.

4005
02:44:02,310 --> 02:44:03,690
Anyway, everybody.

4006
02:44:03,930 --> 02:44:06,390
So, we will not be casting yet.

4007
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:08,970
Me and Mitt will not be casting yet.

4008
02:44:09,010 --> 02:44:12,850
Instead, when it would be Matara versus Mitt, then we'll rotate in.

4009
02:44:12,990 --> 02:44:21,470
So, the first casters going in for the finals will be Octavio and Kai.

4010
02:44:22,730 --> 02:44:24,150
Paging Octavio and Kai.

4011
02:44:24,270 --> 02:44:25,570
Are you guys ready?

4012
02:44:26,830 --> 02:44:27,350
Yes.

4013
02:44:27,350 --> 02:44:28,050
Octavio and Kai?

4014
02:44:28,050 --> 02:44:28,210
Yeah.

4015
02:44:29,030 --> 02:44:29,710
I'm ready.

4016
02:44:29,930 --> 02:44:32,170
You guys even remember who is the next matchup?

4017
02:44:33,330 --> 02:44:34,070
Oh, Jesus.

4018
02:44:34,350 --> 02:44:34,750
Yeah.

4019
02:44:35,530 --> 02:44:36,870
You do it this time.

4020
02:44:36,930 --> 02:44:37,790
I said it last time.

4021
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:38,790
You say it this time.

4022
02:44:40,250 --> 02:44:41,290
It's battle.

4023
02:44:42,630 --> 02:44:44,190
It's battle and...

4024
02:44:44,190 --> 02:44:45,090
Yeah, yeah.

4025
02:44:47,550 --> 02:44:48,590
It's over.

4026
02:44:48,870 --> 02:44:49,210
It's over.

4027
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:51,510
Oh, yeah.

4028
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:52,270
The demon.

4029
02:44:52,350 --> 02:44:53,470
The demon Luto.

4030
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:55,730
What's your full name?

4031
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:56,370
Yes.

4032
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:57,230
There you go.

4033
02:44:57,790 --> 02:44:58,670
Ara Kaluto.

4034
02:44:59,030 --> 02:45:01,110
Are you reading from my OPS right now?

4035
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:06,650
No, totally.

4036
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:07,250
No, no, no.

4037
02:45:07,250 --> 02:45:07,750
Tell me that.

4038
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:08,710
All right, guys.

4039
02:45:08,970 --> 02:45:11,710
So, Mitt and I will be muting very soon.

4040
02:45:11,890 --> 02:45:15,170
So, we're going to take it away to the next casters.

4041
02:45:15,210 --> 02:45:16,130
Good luck, guys.

4042
02:45:16,250 --> 02:45:16,770
Good luck.

4043
02:45:17,150 --> 02:45:18,090
Good luck.

4044
02:45:18,950 --> 02:45:19,830
Good luck.

4045
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:19,970
Hey.

4046
02:45:22,030 --> 02:45:22,870
We are back.

4047
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:23,190
Oh, my God.

4048
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:24,150
I got a big head again.

4049
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:26,170
Oh, what is this?

4050
02:45:26,550 --> 02:45:26,890
Help me.

4051
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,670
Hello?

4052
02:45:28,190 --> 02:45:29,150
Oh, hello.

4053
02:45:29,270 --> 02:45:29,830
Hello.

4054
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:31,370
How are we?

4055
02:45:32,810 --> 02:45:33,490
Hello.

4056
02:45:33,490 --> 02:45:34,290
How are you?

4057
02:45:34,370 --> 02:45:37,210
You're about to face someone with a very stinky diaper.

4058
02:45:37,670 --> 02:45:38,710
Listen, listen.

4059
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:41,650
I have something very brief to say.

4060
02:45:41,730 --> 02:45:46,030
I will not stoop to this stick and twisted diaper meta.

4061
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:50,690
Today, I fight as a man, not as a baby.

4062
02:45:50,890 --> 02:45:53,710
You just say that because you're scared of the diaper.

4063
02:45:53,710 --> 02:45:55,290
Of course I'm scared.

4064
02:45:55,610 --> 02:45:57,610
I can't believe a grown man is scared of the diaper.

4065
02:45:57,830 --> 02:45:58,410
What are you, a child?

4066
02:45:58,410 --> 02:45:59,890
You see what they're doing to people out there?

4067
02:46:00,170 --> 02:46:01,090
It's terrifying.

4068
02:46:01,850 --> 02:46:02,750
Oh, yeah?

4069
02:46:03,070 --> 02:46:04,690
Well, let me sit on you anyway.

4070
02:46:05,770 --> 02:46:07,370
Oh, my God.

4071
02:46:07,850 --> 02:46:10,070
Listen, I've been watching.

4072
02:46:10,230 --> 02:46:11,330
I've seen teleportation.

4073
02:46:11,470 --> 02:46:13,530
I've seen green monsters.

4074
02:46:13,970 --> 02:46:17,170
I have everything stacked against me.

4075
02:46:17,190 --> 02:46:17,810
I'm just a man.

4076
02:46:18,590 --> 02:46:20,690
Got any last dying words, my dude?

4077
02:46:21,850 --> 02:46:22,170
Yeah.

4078
02:46:22,590 --> 02:46:22,950
What?

4079
02:46:23,210 --> 02:46:23,790
I'll win.

4080
02:46:25,250 --> 02:46:26,450
Nah, no way!

4081
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:29,330
I take this thing all the way.

4082
02:46:29,530 --> 02:46:29,730
Diaper meta!

4083
02:46:30,250 --> 02:46:30,770
Oh, man.

4084
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:34,390
I don't know how you're going to win without the diaper, but I'm looking forward to see how this match is going to go.

4085
02:46:34,490 --> 02:46:34,850
I don't know.

4086
02:46:34,890 --> 02:46:35,770
I'm not convinced, man.

4087
02:46:35,950 --> 02:46:38,750
Okay, everyone who's had a freaking diaper wins, man.

4088
02:46:38,810 --> 02:46:39,290
I'm scared.

4089
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:40,750
I'm scared.

4090
02:46:41,250 --> 02:46:41,890
True battle.

4091
02:46:42,030 --> 02:46:42,310
Battle.

4092
02:46:43,050 --> 02:46:44,230
I hope you brought a diaper.

4093
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:46,430
No, no diapers for me.

4094
02:46:46,730 --> 02:46:48,410
We're going commando today, baby.

4095
02:46:49,110 --> 02:46:51,490
I said, because when you shit yourself...

4096
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:52,430
They're all going to see.

4097
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:55,990
Then I'm braver than the rest.

4098
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:56,030
You know what?

4099
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:56,030
That's fine.

4100
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:56,590
Shit into the air.

4101
02:46:56,730 --> 02:46:57,090
That's great.

4102
02:46:58,450 --> 02:47:01,450
We shit like men, not cowards.

4103
02:47:01,630 --> 02:47:02,830
We don't need diapers.

4104
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:05,270
Can't wait for that chocolate fountain, man.

4105
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:05,670
Can't wait.

4106
02:47:07,210 --> 02:47:08,610
I shit in the light.

4107
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:12,710
I don't hide in the shadow.

4108
02:47:13,110 --> 02:47:15,050
You expose it to the sun god.

4109
02:47:17,810 --> 02:47:19,050
The world will see.

4110
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:20,730
Man, God isn't real.

4111
02:47:21,810 --> 02:47:22,830
God isn't real.

4112
02:47:23,530 --> 02:47:24,510
I have no words.

4113
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:32,850
I like these two are the craziest, most unhinged people I've known for a bit.

4114
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:33,850
And I'm very scared.

4115
02:47:34,110 --> 02:47:36,230
I don't, I don't, I don't, I have no words.

4116
02:47:36,970 --> 02:47:38,830
I don't know what else to ask, honestly.

4117
02:47:39,070 --> 02:47:39,810
I'm scared.

4118
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:41,970
You know what's crazy?

4119
02:47:41,990 --> 02:47:44,250
When even the fucking interviewer is like fucking shaking.

4120
02:47:44,370 --> 02:47:46,370
Like, holy shit, man.

4121
02:47:46,510 --> 02:47:47,470
What the fuck?

4122
02:47:47,930 --> 02:47:48,790
I'm going to win.

4123
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:49,870
That's all you gotta know.

4124
02:47:49,990 --> 02:47:50,550
I'm winning.

4125
02:47:50,710 --> 02:47:51,610
I'm sitting on you.

4126
02:47:51,710 --> 02:47:52,650
I'm watching you.

4127
02:47:52,750 --> 02:47:53,830
I have my ass.

4128
02:47:54,210 --> 02:47:55,730
This meta ends today.

4129
02:47:56,310 --> 02:47:57,030
Nuh uh.

4130
02:47:58,170 --> 02:47:59,850
The energy in here is kind of stinky.

4131
02:48:00,670 --> 02:48:02,190
Coasters, please take this away.

4132
02:48:02,490 --> 02:48:02,970
Please.

4133
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:03,770
Okay.

4134
02:48:04,590 --> 02:48:05,930
Alright, we'll save you.

4135
02:48:06,030 --> 02:48:06,250
Alright.

4136
02:48:06,290 --> 02:48:07,590
I think it's time to get in.

4137
02:48:07,710 --> 02:48:07,910
Let's see.

4138
02:48:08,150 --> 02:48:09,630
Gotta see this fight happen.

4139
02:48:09,730 --> 02:48:12,070
Which ideology, diaper or no diaper, will win today?

4140
02:48:12,670 --> 02:48:13,630
In the ring.

4141
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:16,170
This is terrible.

4142
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:17,570
Oh, man.

4143
02:48:17,570 --> 02:48:18,070
Oh, my God.

4144
02:48:19,530 --> 02:48:20,110
You know what?

4145
02:48:20,110 --> 02:48:23,730
It's kind of weird that Bettle kind of looks normal compared to Luto.

4146
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:24,990
Yeah, I was just about to say.

4147
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:28,230
I had to like blink and like process his fucking face for a second.

4148
02:48:28,430 --> 02:48:30,010
I was like, wait, hold on.

4149
02:48:30,030 --> 02:48:31,770
He's just wearing... Oh, no, no, no.

4150
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:32,270
He... Yeah.

4151
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:34,250
Bettle has that double face thing going on.

4152
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:36,430
He has a painted face and his own face.

4153
02:48:36,670 --> 02:48:37,030
Yeah.

4154
02:48:37,350 --> 02:48:38,070
Over each other.

4155
02:48:38,130 --> 02:48:40,830
Dude, I love how his eyes are like spread out so he could like see everything.

4156
02:48:41,790 --> 02:48:43,590
He's a real anime man.

4157
02:48:44,090 --> 02:48:44,450
Yeah.

4158
02:48:44,710 --> 02:48:47,490
He's looking at things with like every angle, bro.

4159
02:48:47,510 --> 02:48:48,370
He sees everything.

4160
02:48:51,630 --> 02:48:52,890
Yeah, wait.

4161
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:53,550
We'll see.

4162
02:48:53,650 --> 02:48:58,830
We'll see if the non diaper believer will win against a diaper meta believer.

4163
02:48:59,170 --> 02:48:59,950
Yeah.

4164
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:07,250
Holding true to the diaper meta.

4165
02:49:08,990 --> 02:49:11,930
It's your underworld spawn.

4166
02:49:15,050 --> 02:49:16,450
It's Loose!

4167
02:49:20,190 --> 02:49:20,590
LUTO!

4168
02:49:22,330 --> 02:49:22,730
Yeah!

4169
02:49:24,090 --> 02:49:24,490
Woo!

4170
02:49:26,390 --> 02:49:27,350
Oh, I love her.

4171
02:49:27,370 --> 02:49:27,730
Oh, there we go.

4172
02:49:27,790 --> 02:49:28,150
I see it.

4173
02:49:28,170 --> 02:49:28,570
I see it now.

4174
02:49:28,710 --> 02:49:29,270
Just a vibe.

4175
02:49:29,370 --> 02:49:29,550
Damn.

4176
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:30,970
Vibin'.

4177
02:49:30,970 --> 02:49:31,210
True, true.

4178
02:49:31,370 --> 02:49:35,310
I can't believe we started the frickin' diaper thing.

4179
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:36,070
I know.

4180
02:49:37,370 --> 02:49:38,090
We're trendsetters.

4181
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:38,530
Now it's gonna apply to everything.

4182
02:49:39,350 --> 02:49:40,130
True, true.

4183
02:49:41,690 --> 02:49:44,650
That's just the pure power of the diaper.

4184
02:49:44,750 --> 02:49:45,470
It's strong, okay?

4185
02:49:45,470 --> 02:49:47,670
Got LUTO vibing the demon from hell!

4186
02:49:49,210 --> 02:49:49,690
Ah.

4187
02:49:50,010 --> 02:49:50,770
Hell yeah.

4188
02:49:50,810 --> 02:49:54,070
You know, this fight is more than just a fight between wrestlers.

4189
02:49:54,410 --> 02:49:55,030
Oh yeah?

4190
02:49:55,070 --> 02:49:59,750
It's a fight between an ordinary human in Gabus Battle and the demon race.

4191
02:50:00,610 --> 02:50:01,910
The demon diaper race.

4192
02:50:02,230 --> 02:50:03,690
The demon diaper race.

4193
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:04,530
They're their own breed?

4194
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:05,070
Mm.

4195
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:05,670
Then they shepherd?

4196
02:50:06,670 --> 02:50:07,430
True, true.

4197
02:50:07,610 --> 02:50:09,090
Dude, do you think that LUTO... Who are you rooting for here?

4198
02:50:09,390 --> 02:50:13,030
Wait, do you think that LUTO's like the diaper demon queen then?

4199
02:50:13,210 --> 02:50:13,970
You think she's the queen?

4200
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:14,810
You think she's on top?

4201
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:15,130
Yeah!

4202
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:16,010
Yeah!

4203
02:50:16,510 --> 02:50:21,390
I also noticed that she keeps her diaper intact with a pin in front.

4204
02:50:21,850 --> 02:50:23,510
With a gigantic pin.

4205
02:50:24,490 --> 02:50:24,990
True!

4206
02:50:25,050 --> 02:50:25,950
Yeah, I remember...

4207
02:50:25,950 --> 02:50:26,690
Did you see that?

4208
02:50:26,750 --> 02:50:27,750
I saw you bringing that up before.

4209
02:50:27,790 --> 02:50:31,330
Yeah, I think if she were smart she'd take that and like stab his eyes out.

4210
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:33,970
But you know, that would be against the rules.

4211
02:50:34,230 --> 02:50:34,770
You know.

4212
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:37,170
And opposing the diaper...

4213
02:50:37,990 --> 02:50:40,970
It's the jester with the silver hair.

4214
02:50:41,790 --> 02:50:44,350
The most charming baby girl himself!

4215
02:50:44,350 --> 02:50:45,530
Battle!

4216
02:50:48,110 --> 02:50:48,730
Let's go!

4217
02:50:50,110 --> 02:50:51,410
That's my senpai!

4218
02:50:51,610 --> 02:50:53,830
The weirdest senpai ever!

4219
02:50:55,090 --> 02:50:55,670
Oh, come on!

4220
02:50:55,670 --> 02:50:56,370
You gotta hype him up more!

4221
02:50:56,370 --> 02:50:56,570
He's a jester!

4222
02:50:58,130 --> 02:50:59,590
Just call him like, yeah, he's weird!

4223
02:50:59,870 --> 02:51:01,970
But I love him and he's great!

4224
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:03,530
He's a man!

4225
02:51:03,870 --> 02:51:06,230
The representative of flat supremacy!

4226
02:51:08,310 --> 02:51:09,670
Let's fucking go!

4227
02:51:10,470 --> 02:51:12,270
Dude, that face is just terrible.

4228
02:51:12,290 --> 02:51:13,150
Holy shit.

4229
02:51:13,150 --> 02:51:15,250
Also the fastest intro in the business.

4230
02:51:16,150 --> 02:51:16,550
Yeah.

4231
02:51:17,530 --> 02:51:18,450
He's all business.

4232
02:51:19,210 --> 02:51:19,810
Hell yeah.

4233
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:20,950
He didn't come here to play, man.

4234
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:21,670
He came here to win.

4235
02:51:22,470 --> 02:51:23,790
Oh yeah, here we go!

4236
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:27,270
Both of them are high flyers actually, now that I realize it.

4237
02:51:27,350 --> 02:51:29,870
I wonder who's gonna do the first like fucking jumping attack.

4238
02:51:29,950 --> 02:51:30,350
I'm waiting.

4239
02:51:30,430 --> 02:51:31,090
Those are my favorites.

4240
02:51:33,010 --> 02:51:33,410
Okay.

4241
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:35,290
Oh, dropkick on the face!

4242
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:38,630
But it wasn't enough to like... to drop her?

4243
02:51:39,010 --> 02:51:39,710
Oh damn!

4244
02:51:40,550 --> 02:51:40,950
Wow!

4245
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:42,530
Oh, shh!

4246
02:51:42,590 --> 02:51:42,950
Dude!

4247
02:51:43,890 --> 02:51:45,430
The advantage here keeps changing.

4248
02:51:45,610 --> 02:51:46,070
Who's winning?

4249
02:51:46,210 --> 02:51:47,010
Bettle or Luto?

4250
02:51:47,070 --> 02:51:48,010
I can't tell.

4251
02:51:48,230 --> 02:51:48,410
Oh my god.

4252
02:51:48,410 --> 02:51:49,210
Oh, they keep missing!

4253
02:51:49,610 --> 02:51:51,030
They keep jumping and missing!

4254
02:51:51,210 --> 02:51:51,830
Ah, there we go!

4255
02:51:52,390 --> 02:51:53,790
Dude, Bettle's just freaking agile.

4256
02:51:53,830 --> 02:51:54,470
What the fuck?

4257
02:51:54,550 --> 02:51:54,790
Oh shit.

4258
02:51:54,890 --> 02:51:55,230
One!

4259
02:51:55,610 --> 02:51:56,690
Okay, no, no, no.

4260
02:51:56,770 --> 02:51:57,470
That'd be too quick.

4261
02:51:57,550 --> 02:51:57,950
That'd be too quick.

4262
02:51:58,070 --> 02:51:58,430
No, no, no.

4263
02:51:58,470 --> 02:51:59,410
Come on, get up buddy, get up!

4264
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:01,530
Bettle here has the makings of a champion.

4265
02:52:01,630 --> 02:52:03,230
I'm sure he can recover.

4266
02:52:03,230 --> 02:52:04,110
Oh, right in the balls.

4267
02:52:04,110 --> 02:52:05,730
Oh no, right in the balls!

4268
02:52:05,970 --> 02:52:06,830
Right in the face!

4269
02:52:08,030 --> 02:52:08,390
Balls!

4270
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:09,590
Balls in the face!

4271
02:52:09,870 --> 02:52:10,930
Bettle's the most important thing!

4272
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:11,330
Balls in parts!

4273
02:52:12,490 --> 02:52:12,950
Oh!

4274
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:16,090
Body slams from the top of the rope!

4275
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:17,090
No face, it's over.

4276
02:52:18,430 --> 02:52:20,070
Oh my god, you're really down!

4277
02:52:20,370 --> 02:52:21,130
Oh, come on!

4278
02:52:21,150 --> 02:52:21,470
Oh no, Luto is going crazy.

4279
02:52:21,470 --> 02:52:22,110
Luto going feral.

4280
02:52:23,270 --> 02:52:25,170
Oh, he dragged my back butt!

4281
02:52:25,390 --> 02:52:25,610
No!

4282
02:52:25,730 --> 02:52:26,410
Luto does not have any of it!

4283
02:52:26,410 --> 02:52:27,490
Was that the balls or the stomach?

4284
02:52:29,990 --> 02:52:31,110
Damn, Bettle!

4285
02:52:32,130 --> 02:52:34,870
You need to add 300 more pounds to your weight!

4286
02:52:36,050 --> 02:52:40,090
Yeah, I don't know, Luto's kinda like flinging him around like way too easily.

4287
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:40,170
Rude.

4288
02:52:40,370 --> 02:52:40,890
Rude.

4289
02:52:43,090 --> 02:52:43,610
Oh!

4290
02:52:43,610 --> 02:52:44,730
Head to the mat!

4291
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:47,450
Okay.

4292
02:52:47,610 --> 02:52:49,510
Oh, reversal by Bettle, that's great.

4293
02:52:50,770 --> 02:52:51,690
Oh, yay!

4294
02:52:51,790 --> 02:52:53,470
One of Bettle's signature flips!

4295
02:52:53,850 --> 02:52:54,490
Hell yeah!

4296
02:52:55,410 --> 02:52:56,610
Oh, oh, oh!

4297
02:52:57,310 --> 02:52:57,830
Headlock?

4298
02:52:57,970 --> 02:52:58,530
What's he doing?

4299
02:52:58,630 --> 02:52:59,070
What's he doing?

4300
02:52:59,270 --> 02:53:00,550
He's setting him up.

4301
02:53:00,890 --> 02:53:01,450
Setting him up.

4302
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:03,130
Throwing him around.

4303
02:53:03,430 --> 02:53:04,330
Oh no!

4304
02:53:04,690 --> 02:53:05,270
Oh, oh, oh!

4305
02:53:05,490 --> 02:53:06,010
Crazy!

4306
02:53:06,050 --> 02:53:06,550
Yay!

4307
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:07,270
The fake!

4308
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:08,490
To the throw!

4309
02:53:09,350 --> 02:53:10,070
Oh shit!

4310
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:10,410
And a pin!

4311
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:11,350
One!

4312
02:53:11,970 --> 02:53:12,370
Oh!

4313
02:53:12,650 --> 02:53:12,850
Ah!

4314
02:53:14,110 --> 02:53:16,690
Don't count Bettle out just because he's 200 pounds less.

4315
02:53:18,510 --> 02:53:19,830
That's what makes him so agile, right?

4316
02:53:19,830 --> 02:53:20,750
He's made out of skin and bone.

4317
02:53:24,610 --> 02:53:25,410
Oh no!

4318
02:53:25,610 --> 02:53:26,250
That was insane!

4319
02:53:26,650 --> 02:53:28,170
That slam was insane!

4320
02:53:28,550 --> 02:53:29,930
And now a submission technique.

4321
02:53:30,110 --> 02:53:30,510
Break his leg!

4322
02:53:30,610 --> 02:53:31,010
Break his leg!

4323
02:53:31,050 --> 02:53:31,590
With the legs.

4324
02:53:31,690 --> 02:53:31,890
Oh!

4325
02:53:33,390 --> 02:53:33,930
Dislocate it!

4326
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:35,490
Oh man.

4327
02:53:35,810 --> 02:53:36,870
No, he can't get up.

4328
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,390
He can't get up.

4329
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:38,170
Oh!

4330
02:53:38,170 --> 02:53:39,510
Right in the nuts again!

4331
02:53:40,330 --> 02:53:42,190
What is this targeted attack on the nuts?

4332
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:47,070
Oh my god, wait.

4333
02:53:47,070 --> 02:53:47,710
Setting him up again.

4334
02:53:47,710 --> 02:53:48,270
Setting him up again.

4335
02:53:48,590 --> 02:53:50,130
Bro, these elaborate setups are so pretty.

4336
02:53:50,130 --> 02:53:51,210
Finally it's gonna work in his favor.

4337
02:53:51,850 --> 02:53:53,030
Is he gonna do the fake?

4338
02:53:53,030 --> 02:53:53,450
Another flip!

4339
02:53:53,510 --> 02:53:54,410
Oh, but it didn't work.

4340
02:53:55,170 --> 02:53:55,570
Oh!

4341
02:53:55,570 --> 02:53:56,510
But he still got her.

4342
02:53:58,030 --> 02:53:59,390
Dropkick to the stomach.

4343
02:53:59,550 --> 02:54:00,090
Another one!

4344
02:54:00,190 --> 02:54:00,450
Oh!

4345
02:54:00,450 --> 02:54:00,530
I love that!

4346
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:01,090
And another flip.

4347
02:54:01,110 --> 02:54:01,430
Yes.

4348
02:54:01,430 --> 02:54:01,850
That's my favorite.

4349
02:54:01,930 --> 02:54:03,590
He loves that flamboyant flair.

4350
02:54:03,950 --> 02:54:04,350
No!

4351
02:54:04,350 --> 02:54:04,810
Come on!

4352
02:54:04,890 --> 02:54:06,190
On a one count only?

4353
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:08,030
This is still anybody's game.

4354
02:54:08,250 --> 02:54:08,750
Yeah.

4355
02:54:08,930 --> 02:54:11,190
Honestly, Beto can be dropped by just a single punch.

4356
02:54:13,550 --> 02:54:15,590
Dude, I don't know, man.

4357
02:54:15,670 --> 02:54:18,610
I wanna see what happens to Luto if she removes her diaper.

4358
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:20,170
I feel like...

4359
02:54:20,170 --> 02:54:22,490
It's like those power limiters, right?

4360
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:23,170
It's like rock leading the fucking weights, alright?

4361
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:24,710
Yeah, that's a power limiter, definitely.

4362
02:54:25,150 --> 02:54:26,530
Take out the diaper.

4363
02:54:26,690 --> 02:54:27,750
Hell breaks loose on the ring.

4364
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:30,730
She needs that limiter to fight in a normal man's wrestling match.

4365
02:54:33,970 --> 02:54:34,490
Oh!

4366
02:54:34,490 --> 02:54:35,010
What?

4367
02:54:35,610 --> 02:54:37,670
The referee bumped into Luto?

4368
02:54:37,930 --> 02:54:38,990
Oh my god!

4369
02:54:40,410 --> 02:54:41,110
Oh no.

4370
02:54:41,230 --> 02:54:41,870
Get picked out!

4371
02:54:41,970 --> 02:54:42,150
One!

4372
02:54:42,230 --> 02:54:42,610
Could this be it?

4373
02:54:42,710 --> 02:54:42,870
One!

4374
02:54:42,990 --> 02:54:43,450
Two!

4375
02:54:43,550 --> 02:54:44,110
Two!

4376
02:54:44,110 --> 02:54:44,330
Oh!

4377
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:45,670
Still not.

4378
02:54:45,670 --> 02:54:46,190
Still not.

4379
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:46,330
Two!

4380
02:54:46,330 --> 02:54:46,330
Two!

4381
02:54:46,770 --> 02:54:47,570
Still not enough.

4382
02:54:48,110 --> 02:54:48,670
Flip!

4383
02:54:49,330 --> 02:54:49,890
Hey!

4384
02:54:49,930 --> 02:54:51,050
Look at those flips!

4385
02:54:52,750 --> 02:54:53,950
That's my Oshii!

4386
02:54:54,170 --> 02:54:54,430
Two!

4387
02:54:54,610 --> 02:54:55,170
Two!

4388
02:54:55,250 --> 02:54:55,810
Woo!

4389
02:54:56,130 --> 02:54:56,690
Almost.

4390
02:54:57,250 --> 02:54:58,130
I'm scared.

4391
02:54:58,270 --> 02:54:58,630
I'm scared.

4392
02:54:58,930 --> 02:55:02,090
Dude, Beto's kind of going crazy right now.

4393
02:55:02,210 --> 02:55:03,450
Oh, he removed the turnbuckle.

4394
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:04,990
I think Beto might win.

4395
02:55:04,990 --> 02:55:05,190
He's running.

4396
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:06,990
Oh!

4397
02:55:07,930 --> 02:55:08,410
Oh!

4398
02:55:08,450 --> 02:55:08,970
Okay, okay.

4399
02:55:09,790 --> 02:55:10,790
Another flip, maybe.

4400
02:55:10,970 --> 02:55:12,190
I'm kind of scared.

4401
02:55:12,330 --> 02:55:12,470
I'm scared.

4402
02:55:12,550 --> 02:55:13,050
Oh no!

4403
02:55:13,170 --> 02:55:14,190
The reversal on Beto!

4404
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:16,730
Oh no, dude!

4405
02:55:17,090 --> 02:55:18,190
He took too long to set up.

4406
02:55:18,190 --> 02:55:19,470
He took too long!

4407
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:19,770
He took too long to set up.

4408
02:55:19,770 --> 02:55:19,770
He took too long!

4409
02:55:21,170 --> 02:55:22,830
Oh no, he's going crazy.

4410
02:55:23,390 --> 02:55:24,670
Beto's going to go feral now.

4411
02:55:24,790 --> 02:55:24,930
Dude!

4412
02:55:25,290 --> 02:55:26,030
Oh no!

4413
02:55:26,250 --> 02:55:27,130
Oh no!

4414
02:55:27,310 --> 02:55:28,370
Right on the cement.

4415
02:55:30,130 --> 02:55:31,410
Get back in the ring!

4416
02:55:31,410 --> 02:55:31,770
No!

4417
02:55:31,770 --> 02:55:32,930
That's not just one!

4418
02:55:33,230 --> 02:55:34,010
It's three!

4419
02:55:34,790 --> 02:55:35,190
What?!

4420
02:55:35,910 --> 02:55:37,850
I'm going to do the three suplex combo!

4421
02:55:38,290 --> 02:55:39,850
Oh man.

4422
02:55:40,810 --> 02:55:41,830
Come on, Beto!

4423
02:55:41,930 --> 02:55:42,650
You were doing so good!

4424
02:55:43,090 --> 02:55:43,210
Please, please.

4425
02:55:43,210 --> 02:55:44,110
This is so sad.

4426
02:55:44,450 --> 02:55:45,470
This is so sad!

4427
02:55:45,830 --> 02:55:46,070
Oh, and the Todd!

4428
02:55:46,350 --> 02:55:47,410
Oh, you were really going to take that?

4429
02:55:47,410 --> 02:55:47,870
Oh no, and the Todd!

4430
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:48,830
Let my boy go!

4431
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:50,470
Let my boy go!

4432
02:55:50,690 --> 02:55:50,810
Let him get up, man!

4433
02:55:51,070 --> 02:55:51,930
Let him get up!

4434
02:55:54,740 --> 02:55:55,140
No!

4435
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:56,580
Oh man!

4436
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:57,460
Okay, okay.

4437
02:55:57,640 --> 02:55:57,700
Come on.

4438
02:55:58,960 --> 02:55:59,360
Oh!

4439
02:55:59,620 --> 02:56:00,800
He stepped on the chest!

4440
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:02,940
Two inches deep, straight to the heart!

4441
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:05,360
He's going to get up.

4442
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:06,340
He's going to get palpitations after.

4443
02:56:06,460 --> 02:56:06,860
Dude!

4444
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:08,200
What happened?!

4445
02:56:08,680 --> 02:56:09,760
Oh my god!

4446
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:11,020
Oh!

4447
02:56:11,020 --> 02:56:11,500
What happened?!

4448
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:11,760
Yeah, I'm sorry.

4449
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:13,400
He can't breathe after this.

4450
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:15,180
How is he supposed to breathe after this?

4451
02:56:15,340 --> 02:56:17,240
His ribs must have punctured his lungs.

4452
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:17,240
True.

4453
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:17,960
He has multiple rib fractures now.

4454
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:18,500
Yeah!

4455
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:20,780
He got the flail chest.

4456
02:56:22,320 --> 02:56:23,020
He's going to die.

4457
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:24,820
This is not a wrestling match anymore.

4458
02:56:24,820 --> 02:56:26,160
Did the referee move out of the way, man?!

4459
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:27,240
Try to see the action!

4460
02:56:27,640 --> 02:56:29,100
Oh my god, this lady's out of the way.

4461
02:56:29,100 --> 02:56:29,600
I think Beto paid the referee.

4462
02:56:29,980 --> 02:56:30,300
Oh, finish!

4463
02:56:31,720 --> 02:56:32,900
That's going to result in concussion.

4464
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:33,260
Flip!

4465
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:34,220
Flip!

4466
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:35,140
Right in the ass!

4467
02:56:35,140 --> 02:56:35,620
Right in the butt!

4468
02:56:35,660 --> 02:56:36,100
Ay!

4469
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:36,980
The favorite flip!

4470
02:56:36,980 --> 02:56:37,460
And another flip!

4471
02:56:37,660 --> 02:56:38,560
It's your favorite flip.

4472
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:39,220
Hell yeah.

4473
02:56:39,320 --> 02:56:39,820
I love him.

4474
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:40,420
He looks so slick.

4475
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:42,920
Okay, okay.

4476
02:56:44,020 --> 02:56:44,460
Damn!

4477
02:56:46,140 --> 02:56:47,020
The backbreaker!

4478
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:49,600
What is this?!

4479
02:56:49,600 --> 02:56:49,840
No!

4480
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:51,040
The surprise pin?!

4481
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:52,240
Oh my god!

4482
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:52,460
No!

4483
02:56:52,480 --> 02:56:53,580
Not like this!

4484
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:56,160
Okay, we're safe.

4485
02:56:57,860 --> 02:56:59,680
Oh no, the diaper to the face!

4486
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:00,680
Oh my god, I thought she was going to sit on his face!

4487
02:57:01,740 --> 02:57:03,700
You can hear the squelch from here!

4488
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:04,880
Oh, dude!

4489
02:57:05,140 --> 02:57:05,760
The stink!

4490
02:57:06,060 --> 02:57:07,040
It's filling up the arena!

4491
02:57:07,240 --> 02:57:07,640
Jesus!

4492
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:07,960
Woo!

4493
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:10,660
Beto still has a chance.

4494
02:57:10,780 --> 02:57:12,380
A kick to the back.

4495
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:14,340
Oh, do I just kick the diaper off?!

4496
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:16,320
He's going to remove the turnbuckle again!

4497
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:17,540
Oh my god!

4498
02:57:17,560 --> 02:57:17,860
What?!

4499
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:19,920
He's removed two now!

4500
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:22,460
What is he going to do about it?

4501
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:23,480
Fucking flip, man!

4502
02:57:24,400 --> 02:57:25,400
Fucking flip, man!

4503
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:26,180
Oh my god!

4504
02:57:26,240 --> 02:57:26,720
He can't just...

4505
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:27,580
He can't just body slam normally.

4506
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:29,480
He has to flip.

4507
02:57:29,700 --> 02:57:31,060
Yeah, got to add a little flip.

4508
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:32,160
Oh my god!

4509
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:33,520
Crazy!

4510
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:35,120
Uses his body as a weapon!

4511
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:36,560
A fireball!

4512
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,700
Dude, he's a fucking weapon!

4513
02:57:38,860 --> 02:57:39,420
He needs a permanent one for him!

4514
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:43,100
Humanity will not give in to the devil and Satan!

4515
02:57:45,420 --> 02:57:45,900
Okay.

4516
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:47,080
Oh, the taunt!

4517
02:57:47,080 --> 02:57:48,300
Oh, the battle didn't like that!

4518
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:50,820
Oh, headbutt right to the ribs!

4519
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:54,420
Disrespect!

4520
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:55,100
This is what you get for thumping!

4521
02:57:57,600 --> 02:57:59,020
It was a cool spear, though.

4522
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:00,540
It was, it was.

4523
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:02,000
Oh, this might be it!

4524
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:03,600
This might be it!

4525
02:58:03,820 --> 02:58:04,240
One!

4526
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:05,000
Two!

4527
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:06,920
Oh, come on!

4528
02:58:09,420 --> 02:58:10,780
It's still anybody's game.

4529
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:11,960
Oh, another...

4530
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:12,460
Oh, what's he doing?

4531
02:58:12,780 --> 02:58:13,940
Oh, top of the rope!

4532
02:58:13,940 --> 02:58:14,160
Oh, I thought he was going to take it off again.

4533
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:16,060
Oh, come on, do the jump.

4534
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:16,340
Come on!

4535
02:58:16,340 --> 02:58:17,280
Finger guns, finger guns!

4536
02:58:17,960 --> 02:58:19,360
Come on, do the flip!

4537
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:20,220
You know you want to!

4538
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:20,860
Max left!

4539
02:58:20,960 --> 02:58:21,380
Oh!

4540
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:22,740
Fucking broke his ass!

4541
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:23,620
He missed!

4542
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:24,280
Failed!

4543
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:27,280
That little, little butt...

4544
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:27,300
Oh, why?

4545
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:28,400
Little squish...

4546
02:58:28,400 --> 02:58:29,840
Oh, what is that?

4547
02:58:30,060 --> 02:58:32,600
He said, yeah, you're going to fucking kick me in the balls!

4548
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:33,440
That's illegal!

4549
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:34,180
Yeah, I think I can kick you in the balls!

4550
02:58:34,180 --> 02:58:34,200
Yeah, I think I can kick you in the balls!

4551
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:34,220
Yeah, I think I can kick you in the balls!

4552
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:34,380
Think again!

4553
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:35,760
Think again!

4554
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:36,720
The illegal move!

4555
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:37,440
Two!

4556
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:38,320
Three!

4557
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:39,860
I can't believe it!

4558
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:39,920
Holy shit!

4559
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:41,120
He fucking won!

4560
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:41,820
I can't believe it!

4561
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:42,800
I can't believe it!

4562
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:43,760
I can't believe it!

4563
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:46,520
With a low blow to win the match!

4564
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:50,560
Your baby girl is all grown up!

4565
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:52,740
No diapers for the winner!

4566
02:58:53,300 --> 02:58:53,820
Bravo!

4567
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:55,400
I can't believe it!

4568
02:58:55,580 --> 02:58:58,760
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

4569
02:58:59,120 --> 02:58:59,220
Holy shit!

4570
02:58:59,220 --> 02:58:59,420
That was so...

4571
02:58:59,420 --> 02:59:00,120
That was beautiful!

4572
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:02,120
Oh my God, I have like a tear in my eye.

4573
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:03,460
Oh, man.

4574
02:59:03,540 --> 02:59:03,800
Oh, my God.

4575
02:59:03,800 --> 02:59:04,180
Oh, my God.

4576
02:59:04,180 --> 02:59:04,200
Oh, my God.

4577
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:05,440
That was great!

4578
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:10,260
Ladies and gentlemen, Bettle's the motherfucking winner!

4579
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:13,780
Oh, we should be the diapers for the key!

4580
02:59:13,780 --> 02:59:13,820
What a Chad move!

4581
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:14,540
What a Chad move!

4582
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:14,800
Holy shit!

4583
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:18,700
The dirtiest move he did!

4584
02:59:19,240 --> 02:59:21,620
I didn't know Luto could lose like that!

4585
02:59:21,940 --> 02:59:24,740
Dude, I didn't think it could get dirtier than the diaper, but here we are.

4586
02:59:24,940 --> 02:59:25,280
I...

4587
02:59:25,280 --> 02:59:25,680
Yeah.

4588
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:27,700
My fucking balls!

4589
02:59:29,160 --> 02:59:29,720
He kicked me in the balls!

4590
02:59:29,720 --> 02:59:30,100
He kicked me in the balls!

4591
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:33,920
He kicked me in the balls!

4592
02:59:34,060 --> 02:59:34,620
You can't...

4593
02:59:34,620 --> 02:59:37,640
You can't talk to a man on his fucking balls like that!

4594
02:59:37,720 --> 02:59:40,860
I thought you were fighting like a man, not like a fucking chicken!

4595
02:59:41,220 --> 02:59:43,060
Well, if I remember correctly, you did it too!

4596
02:59:43,840 --> 02:59:45,940
I can't go for the balls!

4597
02:59:46,660 --> 02:59:48,660
I was just matching my opponent!

4598
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:50,400
What can I say?

4599
02:59:51,560 --> 02:59:52,040
I...

4600
02:59:52,040 --> 02:59:52,500
I...

4601
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:55,360
Bettle, I need to know the thought process of grabbing Luto's balls.

4602
02:59:55,540 --> 02:59:55,940
Why...

4603
02:59:55,940 --> 02:59:56,860
Why did you do it?

4604
02:59:57,160 --> 03:00:00,220
Listen, to defeat your opponent, you attack the source.

4605
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:02,100
The diaper is the source.

4606
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:03,740
You will go for the heart!

4607
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:04,040
I...

4608
03:00:04,440 --> 03:00:05,360
The diaper heart!

4609
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:06,600
Throw it!

4610
03:00:06,780 --> 03:00:07,480
Was it warm?

4611
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:08,300
Was it warm?

4612
03:00:08,960 --> 03:00:09,900
Oh, it was warm.

4613
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:12,380
But it was not as warm as my burning passion.

4614
03:00:13,280 --> 03:00:14,040
Was it big?

4615
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:14,760
Was it big enough for you, Elise?

4616
03:00:15,640 --> 03:00:16,300
Ah, yeah.

4617
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:18,400
It's

4618
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:24,970
a match, but I will not lose in size!

4619
03:00:25,750 --> 03:00:25,790
Oh!

4620
03:00:29,830 --> 03:00:30,230
Wow.

4621
03:00:31,250 --> 03:00:31,650
Wow.

4622
03:00:32,050 --> 03:00:34,010
The gay demon versus the goth lesbian.

4623
03:00:34,110 --> 03:00:36,070
Who would have thought that the goth lesbian would win?

4624
03:00:36,190 --> 03:00:36,850
Well, you know what?

4625
03:00:37,490 --> 03:00:38,570
Luto, you're pretty calm.

4626
03:00:38,610 --> 03:00:38,650
I'm just...

4627
03:00:38,670 --> 03:00:39,410
I'm pretty confident, but I don't know.

4628
03:00:39,470 --> 03:00:40,550
It ended up not paying off.

4629
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:41,890
Kind of sad to say.

4630
03:00:41,990 --> 03:00:43,970
I thought the diapers were the key, but it wasn't.

4631
03:00:45,010 --> 03:00:46,130
More like, uh...

4632
03:00:46,130 --> 03:00:47,790
More like LUSTO.

4633
03:00:49,330 --> 03:00:50,110
Oh, wow.

4634
03:00:51,290 --> 03:00:52,750
That was my senpai!

4635
03:00:53,250 --> 03:00:54,350
He's so funny!

4636
03:00:54,790 --> 03:00:55,970
Oh, you're so funny.

4637
03:00:57,150 --> 03:00:57,730
I'm gonna...

4638
03:00:57,730 --> 03:01:00,130
I'm just gonna call you cock grabber from now on.

4639
03:01:00,170 --> 03:01:00,970
Ball grabber!

4640
03:01:01,010 --> 03:01:02,090
You're a ball grabber!

4641
03:01:03,510 --> 03:01:05,050
I will wear that title with pride.

4642
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:06,390
Ball grabber!

4643
03:01:08,250 --> 03:01:08,650
I'm gonna...

4644
03:01:08,650 --> 03:01:10,190
The Ball Grabber Battle was made today.

4645
03:01:10,190 --> 03:01:11,290
The title was so, like, wrong and so...

4646
03:01:12,230 --> 03:01:12,750
I'm...

4647
03:01:12,750 --> 03:01:13,270
I'm...

4648
03:01:13,270 --> 03:01:14,830
My brain can't process this.

4649
03:01:14,830 --> 03:01:15,290
The myth, the legend.

4650
03:01:15,810 --> 03:01:17,870
My brain can't process this right now.

4651
03:01:18,010 --> 03:01:19,010
It's too late for me.

4652
03:01:19,530 --> 03:01:22,050
The Great Grabber of Balls!

4653
03:01:22,050 --> 03:01:22,250
It's no honor!

4654
03:01:22,250 --> 03:01:22,610
Battle wins!

4655
03:01:23,330 --> 03:01:26,470
The more you say it, the more I question my life choices.

4656
03:01:26,870 --> 03:01:31,350
His name has B and L, which is present in balls.

4657
03:01:31,990 --> 03:01:32,510
Wow.

4658
03:01:33,270 --> 03:01:34,130
So true.

4659
03:01:34,690 --> 03:01:35,610
So that makes sense.

4660
03:01:36,110 --> 03:01:37,670
Yeah, so true.

4661
03:01:37,890 --> 03:01:38,490
So true.

4662
03:01:38,650 --> 03:01:40,190
I need to get a raise.

4663
03:01:40,330 --> 03:01:40,530
Cool.

4664
03:01:40,730 --> 03:01:41,710
I need a raise.

4665
03:01:42,130 --> 03:01:42,850
Jesus Christ!

4666
03:01:45,530 --> 03:01:47,970
Well, congratulations, battle, I guess.

4667
03:01:49,010 --> 03:01:49,790
Thank you.

4668
03:01:51,490 --> 03:01:51,970
Congratulations!

4669
03:01:53,610 --> 03:01:54,730
Hey, that was a great fight!

4670
03:01:54,770 --> 03:01:55,610
Thank you so much!

4671
03:01:55,930 --> 03:01:56,390
Congrats!

4672
03:01:56,390 --> 03:01:57,250
Even though it was really dumb!

4673
03:01:57,250 --> 03:01:59,030
For that amazing, amazing performance.

4674
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:02,010
Those clips are insane.

4675
03:02:02,590 --> 03:02:03,810
Never forget about it.

4676
03:02:03,870 --> 03:02:05,530
I will never forget.

4677
03:02:06,850 --> 03:02:07,330
Good.

4678
03:02:07,430 --> 03:02:08,630
You just started looking.

4679
03:02:08,650 --> 03:02:09,590
I'm going to go to Ludo's Villain Arc right now.

4680
03:02:13,510 --> 03:02:17,210
One day, everyone will know the wrath of the diaper queen!

4681
03:02:17,930 --> 03:02:18,810
One day they will!

4682
03:02:20,510 --> 03:02:20,910
Fuyo

4683
03:02:24,580 --> 03:02:26,960
diaper man is truly supposed to be!

4684
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:29,720
Battle's going to go up against the Fuyo man!

4685
03:02:30,460 --> 03:02:31,560
Are you ready?

4686
03:02:31,740 --> 03:02:32,140
Are you scared?

4687
03:02:32,140 --> 03:02:32,360
Wait, what?

4688
03:02:32,460 --> 03:02:32,680
Yeah.

4689
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:33,740
I am?

4690
03:02:34,120 --> 03:02:34,880
Yes, you are.

4691
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:36,360
You are going to be up against Fuyo man.

4692
03:02:36,360 --> 03:02:37,160
Why did I win?

4693
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:37,780
Why did I win?

4694
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:38,300
Oh my god.

4695
03:02:40,060 --> 03:02:42,140
Maxlok battle versus the leprechaun?

4696
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:43,820
Gotta get out of here!

4697
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:45,220
That's a match for the centuries.

4698
03:02:45,940 --> 03:02:46,340
Wow.

4699
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:49,500
Yeah, I am so...

4700
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:52,240
I am ready for Fuyo man to beat him up.

4701
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:53,140
Next?

4702
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:54,400
Alright, now we are going on to the next!

4703
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:54,660
We are the next contestants.

4704
03:02:54,900 --> 03:02:55,300
Yeah!

4705
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:56,340
Do you guys know them?

4706
03:02:57,960 --> 03:02:58,360
Maybe.

4707
03:02:58,720 --> 03:02:59,000
Yeah.

4708
03:02:59,000 --> 03:02:59,640
Do you know who is fighting?

4709
03:03:00,580 --> 03:03:00,980
Maybe.

4710
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:01,360
Yeah, Kai.

4711
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:02,240
Will you be able to tell?

4712
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:02,500
Kai knows.

4713
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:03,320
What?

4714
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:04,120
No, you know.

4715
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:04,620
Kai knows.

4716
03:03:04,880 --> 03:03:05,140
What?

4717
03:03:05,140 --> 03:03:05,980
What did you say?

4718
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:07,820
What do you mean by...

4719
03:03:07,820 --> 03:03:08,280
You know them.

4720
03:03:08,300 --> 03:03:08,960
You said their names before.

4721
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:09,440
It's...

4722
03:03:10,060 --> 03:03:10,340
It's...

4723
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:10,900
Let's say it together.

4724
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:11,620
It's...

4725
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:11,980
Oh my god.

4726
03:03:12,100 --> 03:03:12,480
It's...

4727
03:03:12,480 --> 03:03:13,040
It's...

4728
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:13,720
It's...

4729
03:03:14,460 --> 03:03:15,020
Fillion...

4730
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:16,480
Fillion!

4731
03:03:16,780 --> 03:03:17,340
Yeah!

4732
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:18,740
And...

4733
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:20,340
And...

4734
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:22,360
Sarah!

4735
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:24,080
Sarah!

4736
03:03:24,420 --> 03:03:24,780
Yes!

4737
03:03:25,300 --> 03:03:25,760
Yeah!

4738
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:29,020
How do you feel about the casters not knowing who you guys are?

4739
03:03:29,400 --> 03:03:30,040
Wait, what happened?

4740
03:03:30,360 --> 03:03:31,820
Wait, I am not animated anymore?

4741
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:34,120
Did I get fired?

4742
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:35,600
How?

4743
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:36,440
Yeah, you got fired.

4744
03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:37,960
I bought Tenta!

4745
03:03:37,960 --> 03:03:38,280
I bought Tenta!

4746
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:40,360
We had a bunch of cups already.

4747
03:03:42,220 --> 03:03:43,100
Can't afford it anymore.

4748
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:43,400
All right.

4749
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:43,880
I'm sorry.

4750
03:03:43,880 --> 03:03:44,140
I'm Indy now.

4751
03:03:44,140 --> 03:03:44,660
What can I say?

4752
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:45,960
It's definitely what it is.

4753
03:03:46,060 --> 03:03:46,540
All right.

4754
03:03:46,620 --> 03:03:48,480
Like, who am I up against?

4755
03:03:48,860 --> 03:03:49,180
Sarah?

4756
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:50,640
Oh, it's the snake lady.

4757
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:53,300
Oh, look, look, Fillion.

4758
03:03:53,360 --> 03:03:57,020
You probably don't know who I am, but I don't really care because I have a philosophy.

4759
03:03:57,400 --> 03:03:57,500
No, I know who you are.

4760
03:03:58,080 --> 03:03:58,880
It's pretty simple.

4761
03:03:59,180 --> 03:03:59,500
What?

4762
03:03:59,560 --> 03:04:01,520
I'm going to be so good that they can't ignore me.

4763
03:04:01,640 --> 03:04:03,500
So that goes for you, my opponent.

4764
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:05,200
It goes for the audience and it goes for everyone.

4765
03:04:05,860 --> 03:04:08,100
Because look, people might not know me out there.

4766
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:08,260
They might not know me.

4767
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:10,200
They might not even like me, but I don't need to be liked.

4768
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:11,660
I need to win.

4769
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:14,580
So I'm going to play the villain if it means I get that card.

4770
03:04:14,580 --> 03:04:15,340
We're taking a villain arc.

4771
03:04:15,460 --> 03:04:15,720
Yeah.

4772
03:04:15,860 --> 03:04:16,780
I respect it.

4773
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:17,180
Damn.

4774
03:04:17,180 --> 03:04:18,160
Look, I remember you.

4775
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:19,660
The pilot is very spicy today.

4776
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,820
You're the one that killed Doki Bird, aren't you?

4777
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:24,460
I am.

4778
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:25,040
I am.

4779
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:25,760
Oh, Bogan.

4780
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:27,260
I casted you yesterday.

4781
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:28,720
I saw all of your moves.

4782
03:04:28,840 --> 03:04:29,700
I observed them.

4783
03:04:30,060 --> 03:04:31,780
Anything you do, I can dodge.

4784
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:33,060
You understand me?

4785
03:04:33,380 --> 03:04:35,580
I will avenge Doki.

4786
03:04:37,340 --> 03:04:38,240
You've learned from me.

4787
03:04:38,260 --> 03:04:40,120
You've learned from Doki and you think you can take me on now, huh?

4788
03:04:40,620 --> 03:04:42,060
Yeah, I don't need to take you on.

4789
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:43,280
I'll just kick you in the nuts.

4790
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:44,220
Learned that one in battle.

4791
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:50,680
So, yeah, you're pretty much downloaded and you only took up one gigabyte on my hard drive.

4792
03:04:50,860 --> 03:04:51,260
I'm sorry.

4793
03:04:54,840 --> 03:04:56,060
Kick the snake in the nuts.

4794
03:04:56,600 --> 03:04:57,280
Oh, uh, yeah.

4795
03:04:58,880 --> 03:05:01,180
I think you'll find that anatomically incorrect.

4796
03:05:02,220 --> 03:05:03,480
I mean, I don't know.

4797
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:06,200
You could kick Sarah in the nuts, but she's got a whole fucking snake, right?

4798
03:05:06,240 --> 03:05:07,480
You can kick her in the nuts.

4799
03:05:07,500 --> 03:05:08,240
She'll just yank you.

4800
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:09,060
You can yeet that snake.

4801
03:05:09,140 --> 03:05:11,420
How do you counter that?

4802
03:05:13,640 --> 03:05:15,260
Grabbing the snake by the balls, too.

4803
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:16,900
Yeah, true.

4804
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:24,280
The more you know.

4805
03:05:24,340 --> 03:05:26,660
Listen, I will avenge Doki.

4806
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:30,420
I will flip on your face and I will beat you into a pulp.

4807
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:33,340
I will take your teeth and remove the venom from them.

4808
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:35,740
And then I'll sell your skin as a purse.

4809
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:37,580
You understand me?

4810
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:38,220
You tried, but you failed.

4811
03:05:38,240 --> 03:05:40,340
I'm not necessarily a venomous snake.

4812
03:05:40,500 --> 03:05:42,680
I'm one of the types that can constrict you.

4813
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:45,720
I'll have you tapping before long.

4814
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:47,000
Let's just say that.

4815
03:05:47,240 --> 03:05:48,760
I don't care what your kinks are.

4816
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:50,320
What's up with get down those fights?

4817
03:05:53,800 --> 03:05:55,400
I think they're ready.

4818
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:56,880
Well, at least there's no kink shenanigans.

4819
03:05:57,140 --> 03:05:57,740
They're ready.

4820
03:05:57,920 --> 03:05:58,600
Get them out there.

4821
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:00,720
We accept all kinks here.

4822
03:06:00,900 --> 03:06:02,200
A very accepting environment.

4823
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:02,940
We love that.

4824
03:06:03,020 --> 03:06:03,260
All right.

4825
03:06:03,260 --> 03:06:04,380
We got to throw them in the ring.

4826
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:05,460
Get them in the ring.

4827
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:06,120
Get out!

4828
03:06:06,340 --> 03:06:06,860
All right.

4829
03:06:07,820 --> 03:06:08,220
We got to throw them in the ring.

4830
03:06:08,220 --> 03:06:09,080
All right.

4831
03:06:09,240 --> 03:06:11,920
Who do you think is going to win, man?

4832
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:12,700
I don't know.

4833
03:06:12,820 --> 03:06:14,020
It's a difficult one.

4834
03:06:14,200 --> 03:06:15,660
Fillion is a high flyer.

4835
03:06:15,660 --> 03:06:17,360
Both Bogan has a snake.

4836
03:06:18,260 --> 03:06:19,360
She can't fucking...

4837
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:20,840
She's got a fucking snake, man.

4838
03:06:20,840 --> 03:06:21,600
Like, I don't know.

4839
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,060
I don't know.

4840
03:06:24,700 --> 03:06:27,080
Let's see if she can pull off what she learned from the battle match.

4841
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:29,860
Fillion better be thankful that she won't bring out the snake during the battle.

4842
03:06:29,940 --> 03:06:31,360
Usually she brings out the snake at the end.

4843
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:32,020
That's true.

4844
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:32,280
We'll see.

4845
03:06:32,340 --> 03:06:32,600
That's true.

4846
03:06:32,740 --> 03:06:33,180
But who knows?

4847
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:33,980
Maybe she'll change her mind.

4848
03:06:34,880 --> 03:06:36,980
Slithering her way to the stage.

4849
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:38,200
Oh, what did she do?

4850
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:41,580
The serpent that doesn't take shit from anybody.

4851
03:06:42,360 --> 03:06:44,800
The serpent storyteller herself.

4852
03:06:46,380 --> 03:06:47,000
Sarah.

4853
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:57,040
I got to harmonize there.

4854
03:06:57,220 --> 03:06:57,980
Where is she?

4855
03:06:58,060 --> 03:06:58,820
Where is she?

4856
03:06:58,920 --> 03:06:59,440
Where is she?

4857
03:06:59,680 --> 03:06:59,880
Sarah.

4858
03:07:00,040 --> 03:07:05,020
She forgot the snake backstage, all right?

4859
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:06,020
She left it in the break room.

4860
03:07:06,360 --> 03:07:07,380
You're cute.

4861
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,200
Where is she?

4862
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:08,960
Where is Sarah?

4863
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:10,400
Where is Sarah?

4864
03:07:10,900 --> 03:07:12,420
Where is this damn powerlifter?

4865
03:07:12,420 --> 03:07:13,460
Don't tell me she got cold feet.

4866
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:14,740
Sarah.

4867
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:17,180
There she is.

4868
03:07:17,360 --> 03:07:18,460
There she is.

4869
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:20,200
Let's fucking go, Sarah.

4870
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:21,060
Finally.

4871
03:07:21,100 --> 03:07:22,880
Look at those tight shorts.

4872
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:25,740
They're very tight.

4873
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:25,940
Hell yeah.

4874
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:30,120
Dude, she's got so much muscle.

4875
03:07:30,140 --> 03:07:31,360
Holy fuck.

4876
03:07:31,360 --> 03:07:32,300
Fucking Bill.

4877
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:33,260
Holy crap.

4878
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:35,720
I'm not quite sure.

4879
03:07:35,780 --> 03:07:37,200
Is that hair or like a...

4880
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:37,880
I don't know.

4881
03:07:37,880 --> 03:07:38,180
I don't know.

4882
03:07:38,180 --> 03:07:38,640
No, that's hair.

4883
03:07:39,140 --> 03:07:39,780
Yeah, that's hair.

4884
03:07:39,920 --> 03:07:40,320
It's actual hair.

4885
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:42,820
I thought it was like a thing, like a cloth.

4886
03:07:43,380 --> 03:07:43,940
Oh, okay.

4887
03:07:44,060 --> 03:07:44,560
No, no, no.

4888
03:07:44,560 --> 03:07:44,900
It's her hair.

4889
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:45,200
It's her hair.

4890
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:47,880
She takes such good care, you know?

4891
03:07:48,120 --> 03:07:49,540
It's like so flowy.

4892
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:50,820
Oh my God.

4893
03:07:51,100 --> 03:07:52,120
Crawling on the floor.

4894
03:07:52,580 --> 03:07:53,140
That's intimidating.

4895
03:07:53,540 --> 03:07:55,380
Immersing herself in what it means to be a snake.

4896
03:07:57,360 --> 03:07:58,000
Dude, I don't know.

4897
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,560
I feel like half of these intros are so intimidating.

4898
03:07:59,800 --> 03:08:00,780
I'd just be scared shitless.

4899
03:08:00,820 --> 03:08:02,860
I don't know how Fillion's going to deal with all the diapers, man.

4900
03:08:03,680 --> 03:08:05,480
She's just going to have to like shit on...

4901
03:08:05,480 --> 03:08:05,780
I'm sorry.

4902
03:08:06,020 --> 03:08:07,240
I can't get over the diapers, man.

4903
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:07,820
I can't.

4904
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:08,160
I can't.

4905
03:08:08,180 --> 03:08:08,900
It's the end of an era.

4906
03:08:08,960 --> 03:08:10,840
I need to get over it, but it's stuck, man.

4907
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:11,420
I can't.

4908
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:13,140
I can't accept reality.

4909
03:08:13,500 --> 03:08:15,840
I mean, diaper meta, our legacy.

4910
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:18,160
That's our legacy as casters for today.

4911
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:23,580
You bet next year's WrestleTuber will have a bunch more diapers.

4912
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:24,820
Yeah, I know.

4913
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:26,620
Next year's WrestleTuber, everybody's obligated.

4914
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:27,060
Everyone.

4915
03:08:27,760 --> 03:08:28,200
Diaper.

4916
03:08:28,720 --> 03:08:29,440
Wrestle diaper.

4917
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:31,700
Everybody has a custom diaper.

4918
03:08:35,160 --> 03:08:37,920
And you can buy diaper merch in the future.

4919
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:38,420
Right?

4920
03:08:38,660 --> 03:08:39,300
Oh my God.

4921
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:41,120
No, not the merch.

4922
03:08:41,320 --> 03:08:42,500
Oh my God.

4923
03:08:43,740 --> 03:08:44,880
Dude, actually though.

4924
03:08:45,080 --> 03:08:45,800
No, no, no.

4925
03:08:46,820 --> 03:08:47,420
Actually, no.

4926
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:48,300
No, I'm just kidding.

4927
03:08:48,620 --> 03:08:49,060
No.

4928
03:08:49,460 --> 03:08:50,220
Actually, yes.

4929
03:08:51,080 --> 03:08:53,220
If I had a diaper, I'd want it to be...

4930
03:08:53,220 --> 03:08:53,700
That's useful.

4931
03:08:53,820 --> 03:08:54,640
Diapers are useful.

4932
03:08:55,800 --> 03:08:56,300
It's true.

4933
03:08:56,460 --> 03:08:57,900
And it's also the great equalizer.

4934
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,200
All of us wore a diaper before.

4935
03:09:01,340 --> 03:09:02,000
That's true.

4936
03:09:02,500 --> 03:09:03,420
Yeah, true.

4937
03:09:04,500 --> 03:09:06,040
I'm sure dragons wear diapers.

4938
03:09:06,720 --> 03:09:07,160
Well.

4939
03:09:07,160 --> 03:09:17,320
Well, I mean, maybe when I was like a wee dragon, but not anymore because I'm a big girl, obviously, and I'm very old and wise because, you know, I'm like a god and I'm like old like that.

4940
03:09:17,380 --> 03:09:20,820
Well, when we're super old, like geriatric age, we will wear diapers again.

4941
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:22,280
No, no, no.

4942
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:23,760
Dragons were just like built different.

4943
03:09:24,980 --> 03:09:25,640
Sorry to say.

4944
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:26,820
So we just don't.

4945
03:09:26,820 --> 03:09:27,640
We're just better.

4946
03:09:27,940 --> 03:09:28,840
Oh, okay.

4947
03:09:29,140 --> 03:09:29,500
Yeah.

4948
03:09:29,520 --> 03:09:29,760
Okay.

4949
03:09:29,760 --> 03:09:30,060
I see.

4950
03:09:30,460 --> 03:09:30,820
Yeah.

4951
03:09:30,900 --> 03:09:31,140
I see.

4952
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:32,940
But maybe you could be the first.

4953
03:09:33,020 --> 03:09:33,480
Who knows?

4954
03:09:35,440 --> 03:09:36,340
Start a movement.

4955
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:37,520
Set the trend.

4956
03:09:37,540 --> 03:09:38,540
Yeah, trendsetter.

4957
03:09:40,480 --> 03:09:43,280
This intro still goes on and on.

4958
03:09:43,400 --> 03:09:43,460
Dude, it's so fucking long.

4959
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:45,820
It's been an hour.

4960
03:09:46,120 --> 03:09:46,960
Both bugging.

4961
03:09:46,980 --> 03:09:47,400
All right, there we go.

4962
03:09:47,460 --> 03:09:47,960
Get out of here.

4963
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:48,620
Stop.

4964
03:09:48,620 --> 03:09:49,080
Thank you.

4965
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:49,840
Get out of here.

4966
03:09:51,140 --> 03:09:52,460
Here we go, guys.

4967
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:53,820
Oh, my God.

4968
03:09:53,820 --> 03:09:54,140
All right.

4969
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:55,380
Here comes Fillion.

4970
03:09:57,660 --> 03:10:02,620
And making an appearance outside of VR chat.

4971
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:03,460
Oh, my God.

4972
03:10:03,460 --> 03:10:08,280
Here to grace our presence, it's Fillion.

4973
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:10,560
Yeah, yeah, yo.

4974
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:13,780
Look at those moves.

4975
03:10:14,060 --> 03:10:14,420
Yeah.

4976
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:15,620
I don't know what those moves are called.

4977
03:10:15,620 --> 03:10:16,120
A little dancey dance.

4978
03:10:16,660 --> 03:10:17,460
Yeah, no, me neither.

4979
03:10:18,140 --> 03:10:20,100
I don't know any moves anyone's making today.

4980
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:20,380
Are those the moves?

4981
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:21,540
I don't know wrestling moves.

4982
03:10:21,540 --> 03:10:22,360
I don't know dance moves.

4983
03:10:22,440 --> 03:10:22,720
TikTokers use these days.

4984
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:25,660
Oh, do you know, Octavia, do you know how to hit the gritty?

4985
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:27,360
Yeah.

4986
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,460
You do?

4987
03:10:28,620 --> 03:10:29,880
It's like, I do this.

4988
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:32,620
Yeah.

4989
03:10:33,080 --> 03:10:33,440
So I'm like, oh, my God.

4990
03:10:33,440 --> 03:10:33,560
See that?

4991
03:10:33,660 --> 03:10:33,940
Get it.

4992
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:35,220
Yeah, that was really impressive.

4993
03:10:35,460 --> 03:10:35,600
Yeah.

4994
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:36,960
That was so impressive.

4995
03:10:37,140 --> 03:10:40,560
So, I think I need more practice, honestly.

4996
03:10:42,520 --> 03:10:43,060
Me too.

4997
03:10:43,260 --> 03:10:44,340
Fillion should have done the gritty.

4998
03:10:44,420 --> 03:10:45,280
Zero out of ten intro.

4999
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:48,820
Yeah, what the heck is this dance?

5000
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:51,180
This dance is actually very, like, very old.

5001
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:53,960
Yeah, this is what the kids do nowadays, all right?

5002
03:10:53,980 --> 03:10:54,680
We're doing the...

5003
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:55,260
This is like 2008 dance.

5004
03:10:55,540 --> 03:10:56,880
When were we hitting the gritties?

5005
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:57,780
All right, this is...

5006
03:10:57,780 --> 03:10:58,400
You're old.

5007
03:10:58,460 --> 03:10:59,340
Get out of here with that shit.

5008
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:01,900
This was the year where we all had eyeliner on.

5009
03:11:02,680 --> 03:11:03,420
It's that old.

5010
03:11:04,120 --> 03:11:06,340
I just want to hear about hitting the gritty in skibbity toilet.

5011
03:11:06,480 --> 03:11:06,760
That's it.

5012
03:11:10,420 --> 03:11:11,640
Okay, here we go.

5013
03:11:12,060 --> 03:11:13,760
I don't know what to bet my money on.

5014
03:11:13,820 --> 03:11:14,520
Fillion versus Bulk Bogan.

5015
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:16,000
I don't know, too.

5016
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:18,740
Though I kind of want to...

5017
03:11:18,740 --> 03:11:19,460
Oh, oh, oh.

5018
03:11:19,980 --> 03:11:20,560
Oh, whoa.

5019
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:22,280
All right, that's just like fucking whiplash.

5020
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:22,300
Holy shit.

5021
03:11:22,300 --> 03:11:23,820
Those signature Fillion flips.

5022
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:27,340
I can't wait to see what goes on here.

5023
03:11:27,440 --> 03:11:28,660
What's Bulk Bogan's strategy?

5024
03:11:30,140 --> 03:11:30,740
I think...

5025
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:31,840
I think Bulk Bogan is a high flyer.

5026
03:11:31,860 --> 03:11:32,240
There we go.

5027
03:11:32,560 --> 03:11:33,140
Bulk Bogan is pure.

5028
03:11:33,140 --> 03:11:33,420
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

5029
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:33,600
He's got the strength.

5030
03:11:33,840 --> 03:11:34,460
Pure muscle.

5031
03:11:34,460 --> 03:11:35,880
Yeah, I was going to say he's pure muscle.

5032
03:11:35,980 --> 03:11:36,360
Exactly.

5033
03:11:37,240 --> 03:11:37,760
Whoa!

5034
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:38,180
Whoa!

5035
03:11:38,480 --> 03:11:41,220
Just rode on Fillion, the poor little cat.

5036
03:11:41,580 --> 03:11:42,580
Is that a cat?

5037
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:43,620
He casually breaks your spine.

5038
03:11:45,580 --> 03:11:46,100
Ouch.

5039
03:11:46,300 --> 03:11:47,420
Oh, oh, the flip.

5040
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:47,960
Oh.

5041
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:48,800
Oh!

5042
03:11:49,460 --> 03:11:49,980
Damn!

5043
03:11:50,040 --> 03:11:50,500
Whoa!

5044
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,580
The people's elbow.

5045
03:11:52,120 --> 03:11:52,580
Damn.

5046
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:55,160
But Bulk Bogan's very aggressive.

5047
03:11:56,940 --> 03:11:57,460
Ah!

5048
03:11:58,540 --> 03:12:00,360
Sticking the landing every time.

5049
03:12:00,420 --> 03:12:00,600
Oh, another elbow.

5050
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:01,060
That's inaccurate.

5051
03:12:02,440 --> 03:12:03,400
Fillion seems to be a little more aggressive.

5052
03:12:03,420 --> 03:12:04,880
She seems to be moving at times two speed.

5053
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:06,700
Yeah, I was just about to say that.

5054
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:09,380
She's like so fucking speedy right now.

5055
03:12:09,440 --> 03:12:09,960
Oh my God.

5056
03:12:10,060 --> 03:12:12,140
She got that Final Fantasy haste spell on.

5057
03:12:12,280 --> 03:12:12,560
I thought that was me.

5058
03:12:13,900 --> 03:12:14,620
Or drugs.

5059
03:12:15,380 --> 03:12:16,040
Or drugs.

5060
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:16,900
I don't know.

5061
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:18,460
She's bringing out her A game, right?

5062
03:12:20,220 --> 03:12:21,100
Oh, pinned already.

5063
03:12:21,100 --> 03:12:21,460
Oh, a pin already.

5064
03:12:22,980 --> 03:12:24,180
One, two, two.

5065
03:12:24,380 --> 03:12:24,660
Oh, okay.

5066
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:25,540
I thought that was not good for her.

5067
03:12:25,580 --> 03:12:26,040
That was like, holy shit.

5068
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:26,160
Too early.

5069
03:12:26,300 --> 03:12:26,740
That's too early.

5070
03:12:26,920 --> 03:12:27,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5071
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:29,140
Oh.

5072
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:29,700
Oh.

5073
03:12:29,860 --> 03:12:30,420
What are you...

5074
03:12:30,420 --> 03:12:31,280
What's going on here?

5075
03:12:31,460 --> 03:12:31,620
Are you setting up?

5076
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:31,860
Are you setting up?

5077
03:12:32,720 --> 03:12:33,080
Oh.

5078
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:33,340
Oh.

5079
03:12:33,340 --> 03:12:33,400
Oh.

5080
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:34,580
Yeah, she's like, get out of here.

5081
03:12:35,400 --> 03:12:35,760
Flip.

5082
03:12:37,140 --> 03:12:37,860
Oh, man.

5083
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:39,320
That was so cool if you landed it.

5084
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:39,460
A dropkick to the back.

5085
03:12:39,540 --> 03:12:40,480
That's gotta hurt.

5086
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:43,520
A herniated spine.

5087
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:43,780
Ravager or something.

5088
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:45,320
Come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

5089
03:12:45,640 --> 03:12:47,200
Oh, butt to the face.

5090
03:12:47,420 --> 03:12:47,860
Oh, so lucky.

5091
03:12:47,860 --> 03:12:49,460
A non-diaper butt to the face.

5092
03:12:49,500 --> 03:12:49,760
Yeah.

5093
03:12:50,200 --> 03:12:50,860
So lucky.

5094
03:12:50,860 --> 03:12:51,840
I should not wear a diaper.

5095
03:12:52,880 --> 03:12:53,240
So lucky.

5096
03:12:55,020 --> 03:12:58,080
Just straight up like bone structure and fat.

5097
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:01,720
Oh, flip.

5098
03:13:01,980 --> 03:13:02,280
Oh.

5099
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:05,420
That was sick.

5100
03:13:05,480 --> 03:13:05,820
That was sick.

5101
03:13:05,880 --> 03:13:06,240
That was sick.

5102
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:07,580
Props to the cameraman.

5103
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:08,900
The cameraman is doing great.

5104
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:09,620
Dude, right?

5105
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:13,160
I'm like this fucking referee that drives me through the roof every time.

5106
03:13:13,300 --> 03:13:13,540
True.

5107
03:13:13,900 --> 03:13:14,300
True.

5108
03:13:14,740 --> 03:13:15,140
Whoa.

5109
03:13:15,220 --> 03:13:16,140
Oh, my God.

5110
03:13:16,980 --> 03:13:18,740
Fucking Satan downed another one.

5111
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:19,700
From the ring.

5112
03:13:20,900 --> 03:13:21,560
My God.

5113
03:13:21,620 --> 03:13:24,000
How does she not get dizzy from doing all those flips?

5114
03:13:26,340 --> 03:13:26,740
Oh.

5115
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:27,220
What was that?

5116
03:13:27,540 --> 03:13:27,940
Oh.

5117
03:13:29,820 --> 03:13:30,220
Okay.

5118
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:31,760
Oh.

5119
03:13:31,980 --> 03:13:32,000
Ah.

5120
03:13:32,200 --> 03:13:33,200
Right on the cement.

5121
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:33,400
Oh.

5122
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:33,960
Come on.

5123
03:13:33,960 --> 03:13:34,220
Get her.

5124
03:13:34,240 --> 03:13:34,800
Get her down.

5125
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:35,280
Get her down.

5126
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:36,200
Right in front of the crowd.

5127
03:13:36,360 --> 03:13:38,420
Look at all those three men in the black shirts.

5128
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:38,860
Yeah.

5129
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:42,540
The crowd is so excited.

5130
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:42,920
Okay.

5131
03:13:42,920 --> 03:13:43,240
So hyped.

5132
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:44,560
Okay.

5133
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:46,000
Keep them inside the ring.

5134
03:13:46,480 --> 03:13:46,840
Yeah.

5135
03:13:47,260 --> 03:13:48,620
So you can pin them when you need them to.

5136
03:13:49,180 --> 03:13:49,940
Get in the ring.

5137
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:50,280
Oh.

5138
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:51,200
They're staring each other down.

5139
03:13:51,640 --> 03:13:52,920
One in heaven, one in hell.

5140
03:13:54,860 --> 03:13:55,220
Oh.

5141
03:13:55,280 --> 03:13:55,400
Oh.

5142
03:13:55,700 --> 03:13:56,060
Oh.

5143
03:13:56,720 --> 03:13:57,400
Holy shit.

5144
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:57,860
Do it.

5145
03:13:57,880 --> 03:13:57,980
Do it.

5146
03:13:57,980 --> 03:13:59,200
Just carried like a twig.

5147
03:13:59,500 --> 03:13:59,960
Do it.

5148
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:00,160
Do it.

5149
03:14:00,520 --> 03:14:00,880
Oh.

5150
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:02,060
Head to the turnbuckle.

5151
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:03,480
That's got to hurt as well.

5152
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:03,980
That's even worse though.

5153
03:14:03,980 --> 03:14:04,200
Yup.

5154
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:07,020
Ah.

5155
03:14:07,280 --> 03:14:07,640
Whoa.

5156
03:14:07,820 --> 03:14:08,660
I thought it was whatever.

5157
03:14:08,780 --> 03:14:09,140
What?

5158
03:14:09,520 --> 03:14:09,880
Huh?

5159
03:14:10,220 --> 03:14:14,040
You didn't tell me Bulk Bogan was also athletic and flexible like that.

5160
03:14:15,060 --> 03:14:15,820
Oh my god.

5161
03:14:15,820 --> 03:14:15,840
The setup.

5162
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:16,760
I didn't know she did that as well.

5163
03:14:17,540 --> 03:14:17,900
Oh.

5164
03:14:17,900 --> 03:14:18,200
Oh.

5165
03:14:18,220 --> 03:14:18,700
Here we go.

5166
03:14:18,780 --> 03:14:18,880
One.

5167
03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:19,960
This referee is so freaking slow.

5168
03:14:20,180 --> 03:14:20,520
Two.

5169
03:14:20,780 --> 03:14:21,140
Two.

5170
03:14:21,440 --> 03:14:21,880
I know.

5171
03:14:21,900 --> 03:14:22,240
Right.

5172
03:14:22,260 --> 03:14:23,180
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

5173
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:25,560
Fillion is too slippery.

5174
03:14:26,100 --> 03:14:27,160
Too slippery and thin.

5175
03:14:27,260 --> 03:14:27,380
Yeah.

5176
03:14:27,400 --> 03:14:28,180
She's too fast.

5177
03:14:28,180 --> 03:14:28,880
Oh.

5178
03:14:29,140 --> 03:14:30,020
Butt to the face.

5179
03:14:30,120 --> 03:14:30,480
Again.

5180
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:33,480
Oh.

5181
03:14:33,560 --> 03:14:34,160
Pull her arm off.

5182
03:14:34,240 --> 03:14:34,880
Pull her arm off.

5183
03:14:35,020 --> 03:14:35,200
Yeah.

5184
03:14:38,660 --> 03:14:39,500
Grab her by the hair.

5185
03:14:39,580 --> 03:14:39,760
Yeah.

5186
03:14:40,860 --> 03:14:43,880
I just realized Fillion is in like a generic dance practice outfit.

5187
03:14:45,060 --> 03:14:45,420
Yeah.

5188
03:14:45,440 --> 03:14:45,640
She...

5189
03:14:45,640 --> 03:14:46,040
Listen.

5190
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:47,520
She's not here for the bells and whistles.

5191
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:48,320
She's getting to...

5192
03:14:48,320 --> 03:14:49,000
Yeah.

5193
03:14:49,040 --> 03:14:49,220
No.

5194
03:14:49,240 --> 03:14:50,280
She had a warm up.

5195
03:14:50,320 --> 03:14:50,540
All right.

5196
03:14:51,060 --> 03:14:51,880
She was warming up.

5197
03:14:53,080 --> 03:14:53,440
Yeah.

5198
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:55,760
Oh man.

5199
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:58,000
Fillion actually rivals Gavis Battle in all the...

5200
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:58,160
Oh.

5201
03:14:58,180 --> 03:14:58,960
I need to see a...

5202
03:14:59,000 --> 03:14:59,640
Maybe even better.

5203
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:04,320
I need to see a Fillion versus Battle fight just for all the flips, dude.

5204
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:06,440
Oh yeah.

5205
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:06,660
Oh, shit.

5206
03:15:07,080 --> 03:15:07,600
Oh.

5207
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:07,760
Oh.

5208
03:15:07,760 --> 03:15:08,120
Oh.

5209
03:15:08,200 --> 03:15:08,720
Oh.

5210
03:15:08,720 --> 03:15:09,540
Kick in the air.

5211
03:15:10,120 --> 03:15:10,640
Gnarly.

5212
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:11,280
Converse to the face.

5213
03:15:11,340 --> 03:15:11,360
Oh.

5214
03:15:11,360 --> 03:15:12,020
Head down.

5215
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:13,040
One.

5216
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:13,420
One.

5217
03:15:13,580 --> 03:15:13,900
Two.

5218
03:15:14,060 --> 03:15:14,580
Two.

5219
03:15:14,600 --> 03:15:14,780
Three.

5220
03:15:14,940 --> 03:15:15,260
Oh.

5221
03:15:15,740 --> 03:15:16,900
Not yet.

5222
03:15:17,020 --> 03:15:17,500
Damn.

5223
03:15:17,500 --> 03:15:19,160
Now, this seems to be...

5224
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:21,160
This feels like it's going to be a long battle.

5225
03:15:21,380 --> 03:15:21,880
Yeah.

5226
03:15:22,060 --> 03:15:22,540
We'll see.

5227
03:15:22,960 --> 03:15:26,880
Why did Ludo just like dramatically like roll up?

5228
03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:28,220
Like, oh God.

5229
03:15:28,260 --> 03:15:28,600
Not again.

5230
03:15:28,740 --> 03:15:29,120
Oh.

5231
03:15:29,820 --> 03:15:32,000
She set herself up for that one, honestly.

5232
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:34,140
Her own butt to Bulk Bogan's face.

5233
03:15:34,420 --> 03:15:35,700
Bony and thin.

5234
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:36,180
Oh.

5235
03:15:36,220 --> 03:15:37,100
That's got to hurt.

5236
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:39,100
Oh, the ankles.

5237
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:43,020
Oh my God.

5238
03:15:44,900 --> 03:15:45,640
Oh no.

5239
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:46,180
This is just...

5240
03:15:46,180 --> 03:15:47,300
Bulk Bogan is...

5241
03:15:47,300 --> 03:15:47,320
I know.

5242
03:15:47,320 --> 03:15:48,200
I was about to say, I can't watch.

5243
03:15:48,420 --> 03:15:49,180
This is just...

5244
03:15:49,760 --> 03:15:50,800
Ludo, come on.

5245
03:15:50,960 --> 03:15:51,260
Yeah.

5246
03:15:51,660 --> 03:15:52,500
Get it together.

5247
03:15:52,840 --> 03:15:53,140
What?

5248
03:15:54,620 --> 03:15:55,960
Bulk Bogan, you're snake.

5249
03:15:56,380 --> 03:15:56,860
Oh.

5250
03:15:56,860 --> 03:15:57,420
Think of your...

5251
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:58,080
Oh my God.

5252
03:15:58,100 --> 03:16:00,880
An elbow from the top of the rope to the cement.

5253
03:16:01,640 --> 03:16:02,120
What?

5254
03:16:02,380 --> 03:16:03,240
Oh my God.

5255
03:16:03,500 --> 03:16:05,140
Fillion just won't let her get up.

5256
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:07,300
Fillion, don't kill Bulk Bogan.

5257
03:16:07,960 --> 03:16:10,560
Her snake won't know what happened to her owner.

5258
03:16:10,900 --> 03:16:11,800
Oh God.

5259
03:16:14,220 --> 03:16:14,840
Oh, what?

5260
03:16:15,100 --> 03:16:18,820
The snake is waiting at home for Bulk Bogan and she never comes back.

5261
03:16:19,580 --> 03:16:20,600
That's so sad.

5262
03:16:20,720 --> 03:16:21,380
Oh my God.

5263
03:16:21,820 --> 03:16:22,760
Snake, where are we at?

5264
03:16:22,840 --> 03:16:25,340
Listen, we're putting up the snake up for like auction.

5265
03:16:25,640 --> 03:16:26,660
Everybody put your...

5266
03:16:26,660 --> 03:16:26,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

5267
03:16:26,840 --> 03:16:27,960
Put your auctions in the chat.

5268
03:16:28,060 --> 03:16:28,920
How much are you...

5269
03:16:28,920 --> 03:16:30,360
How much you want to buy the snake for?

5270
03:16:30,980 --> 03:16:34,120
We need to find a new owner for Bulk Bogan's snake.

5271
03:16:36,400 --> 03:16:36,760
Damn.

5272
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:39,220
Dude, I feel like they should already be counting like Ludo.

5273
03:16:39,260 --> 03:16:40,740
It's just like not getting up.

5274
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:41,880
Yeah.

5275
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:44,060
Oh no, there she goes.

5276
03:16:44,100 --> 03:16:44,540
There she goes.

5277
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:45,920
She's not done yet.

5278
03:16:46,400 --> 03:16:47,600
She's not out to fight yet.

5279
03:16:48,940 --> 03:16:49,740
Come on, strike back.

5280
03:16:50,600 --> 03:16:52,240
Don't let her treat you like that, Ludo.

5281
03:16:52,240 --> 03:16:52,340
Oh, yeah.

5282
03:16:52,340 --> 03:16:52,940
It's the reversal.

5283
03:16:54,200 --> 03:16:54,620
Let's go.

5284
03:16:54,940 --> 03:16:55,900
Oh, right in the gut.

5285
03:16:55,960 --> 03:16:56,660
Oh, right in the gut.

5286
03:16:56,660 --> 03:16:56,800
Reversal.

5287
03:16:56,800 --> 03:16:56,820
Reversal.

5288
03:16:56,840 --> 03:16:57,120
Reversal, Sarah.

5289
03:16:57,860 --> 03:17:00,560
Oh, how do you block an arm that thick?

5290
03:17:01,240 --> 03:17:02,280
Dude, you can't.

5291
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:03,420
She's just a fucking tank.

5292
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:06,280
Whoops.

5293
03:17:07,240 --> 03:17:07,680
Oh.

5294
03:17:07,920 --> 03:17:08,360
Oh.

5295
03:17:08,520 --> 03:17:08,960
Whoops.

5296
03:17:09,440 --> 03:17:09,880
Yo.

5297
03:17:10,860 --> 03:17:12,460
Oh, what am I watching?

5298
03:17:12,580 --> 03:17:13,340
The wrestling or Olympics?

5299
03:17:13,740 --> 03:17:13,960
Dude.

5300
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:17,600
These flips are fucking insane.

5301
03:17:18,100 --> 03:17:19,080
Feelings in the wrong place.

5302
03:17:19,140 --> 03:17:21,760
She should be at the fucking gymnastics Olympics, all right?

5303
03:17:21,780 --> 03:17:22,760
Not the fucking WWE.

5304
03:17:23,820 --> 03:17:26,060
But it's not on me to judge her career path.

5305
03:17:26,160 --> 03:17:26,580
One, two, three.

5306
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:26,820
Oh, she's not out.

5307
03:17:26,840 --> 03:17:27,800
This is it.

5308
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:28,480
That was it.

5309
03:17:29,140 --> 03:17:30,120
Killian won.

5310
03:17:30,220 --> 03:17:30,960
I'm fucking huge.

5311
03:17:31,940 --> 03:17:33,740
Against Bucky Bogon.

5312
03:17:34,480 --> 03:17:35,600
Holy crap.

5313
03:17:35,900 --> 03:17:37,280
Bucky Bogon.

5314
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:43,240
No, not Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's Killian.

5315
03:17:44,520 --> 03:17:45,080
Yes.

5316
03:17:46,060 --> 03:17:46,620
Fucking congrats.

5317
03:17:46,620 --> 03:17:47,120
That was insane.

5318
03:17:47,840 --> 03:17:50,960
Dude, I thought she was going to whip out that snake, but she didn't.

5319
03:17:51,360 --> 03:17:53,060
Ah, she should've done it.

5320
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:54,640
Fuck Bogon.

5321
03:17:54,660 --> 03:17:55,600
All of that gym.

5322
03:17:55,600 --> 03:17:57,240
All of that workout for what?

5323
03:17:57,560 --> 03:17:59,140
Fillion, Fillion, why are you flexing?

5324
03:17:59,180 --> 03:18:00,300
You have nothing there bro.

5325
03:18:00,340 --> 03:18:01,240
You look like a toothpick.

5326
03:18:01,260 --> 03:18:02,880
Why are you flexing?

5327
03:18:06,720 --> 03:18:08,500
It's alright, listen, I can't talk shit.

5328
03:18:08,540 --> 03:18:09,320
She fucking won.

5329
03:18:09,420 --> 03:18:10,500
So it doesn't fucking matter.

5330
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:11,560
Yeah true.

5331
03:18:11,580 --> 03:18:13,680
Muscles actually don't matter if you think about it.

5332
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:13,720
What?

5333
03:18:15,300 --> 03:18:18,680
Alright, let's go see what they have to say.

5334
03:18:18,900 --> 03:18:20,120
That's just Fillion bone and tendons.

5335
03:18:20,960 --> 03:18:22,940
How the fuck did you...

5336
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:23,500
like...

5337
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:25,960
How did you raise him up?

5338
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:27,240
How could you flip him?

5339
03:18:27,500 --> 03:18:28,500
I need to know!

5340
03:18:29,320 --> 03:18:30,720
I used the power...

5341
03:18:30,720 --> 03:18:32,380
of God in anime...

5342
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:33,920
and I showed her my snake.

5343
03:18:36,940 --> 03:18:38,920
And it was over before it began.

5344
03:18:39,220 --> 03:18:40,960
Like I said, new purse.

5345
03:18:41,220 --> 03:18:42,060
Is it a Pato?

5346
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:42,780
Is it a Gucci?

5347
03:18:43,060 --> 03:18:43,940
No, it's a Sarah.

5348
03:18:45,520 --> 03:18:46,040
Alright.

5349
03:18:46,120 --> 03:18:48,020
I just have one thing I want to say.

5350
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:50,780
My name's not...

5351
03:18:50,780 --> 03:18:51,760
Sarah.

5352
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:52,680
It's not!

5353
03:18:52,940 --> 03:18:53,440
It's Luto.

5354
03:18:53,680 --> 03:18:54,460
It is...

5355
03:18:54,460 --> 03:18:55,680
Sarah Nagare.

5356
03:18:55,800 --> 03:18:56,940
Remember that name!

5357
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:58,140
I'm coming back.

5358
03:18:58,240 --> 03:18:59,600
And I'm coming back with a vengeance.

5359
03:18:59,940 --> 03:19:01,060
You better believe it.

5360
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:03,320
This is not the last time you've seen me.

5361
03:19:03,540 --> 03:19:05,400
So remember it next time.

5362
03:19:05,840 --> 03:19:06,580
Hey, hey.

5363
03:19:06,660 --> 03:19:08,600
Let me know when you can touch your toes.

5364
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:09,260
Alright?

5365
03:19:10,900 --> 03:19:11,420
What?

5366
03:19:12,160 --> 03:19:13,440
Snakes don't have toes.

5367
03:19:14,040 --> 03:19:14,560
Alright.

5368
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:19,080
Well, let me know when you put them on and then touch them.

5369
03:19:19,380 --> 03:19:20,180
Oh, whoa.

5370
03:19:20,420 --> 03:19:22,040
I put them on.

5371
03:19:22,940 --> 03:19:23,520
I feel like...

5372
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:25,320
Let me just get my fake toes and I'll...

5373
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:26,640
I do find some feet.

5374
03:19:27,800 --> 03:19:30,100
I just find some feet and strap them on real quick.

5375
03:19:30,200 --> 03:19:31,100
It's like Velcro, you know?

5376
03:19:31,320 --> 03:19:32,880
I'll just... I'll just... I'll throw them on.

5377
03:19:32,920 --> 03:19:33,160
It's okay.

5378
03:19:33,300 --> 03:19:35,020
I didn't know Fillion liked feet.

5379
03:19:35,140 --> 03:19:36,040
A snake with toes?

5380
03:19:36,820 --> 03:19:37,460
Hey, hey.

5381
03:19:37,460 --> 03:19:38,340
No kinkshaming.

5382
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:39,140
No kinkshaming.

5383
03:19:39,140 --> 03:19:39,460
Hey, hey.

5384
03:19:39,580 --> 03:19:40,720
I'm not here for the feet.

5385
03:19:40,780 --> 03:19:41,500
I'm here for the snake.

5386
03:19:41,540 --> 03:19:42,040
Give me gin.

5387
03:19:42,240 --> 03:19:43,140
I'm keeping that, nerd.

5388
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:45,480
I want his little mustache.

5389
03:19:47,420 --> 03:19:48,180
Oh, God.

5390
03:19:48,220 --> 03:19:48,960
True, he does look very distinguished.

5391
03:19:48,960 --> 03:19:49,520
He does have a mustache.

5392
03:19:49,920 --> 03:19:51,340
Yeah, I just realized that.

5393
03:19:51,360 --> 03:19:51,780
He's very distinguished.

5394
03:19:51,860 --> 03:19:52,260
He's very gentle.

5395
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:58,820
Saurabh, because you did fuse with Jyn, does he have anything to say?

5396
03:20:00,020 --> 03:20:02,620
Yeah, I do have something to say, and that is...

5397
03:20:02,620 --> 03:20:05,580
Are we allowed to swear on this, or is this family friendly?

5398
03:20:07,260 --> 03:20:08,900
I've sworn a bunch of times, so...

5399
03:20:08,900 --> 03:20:09,660
I mean, I don't know.

5400
03:20:10,980 --> 03:20:13,620
At least if you get in trouble, we get in trouble together, so...

5401
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:14,180
Do it.

5402
03:20:14,200 --> 03:20:14,480
Do it.

5403
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:15,240
Do it.

5404
03:20:16,060 --> 03:20:18,200
No, I'll be good to everyone.

5405
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:19,580
You fackers!

5406
03:20:19,860 --> 03:20:20,380
Frick!

5407
03:20:20,500 --> 03:20:22,960
I'll be back, and I'll be snakier than ever.

5408
03:20:23,260 --> 03:20:24,280
You just watch now.

5409
03:20:24,380 --> 03:20:28,500
I'm gonna get these snaky dogs out, and you're gonna be facking licking them next time.

5410
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:29,800
Oh, my God!

5411
03:20:31,060 --> 03:20:32,260
You know what?

5412
03:20:32,300 --> 03:20:34,300
I'm looking forward to your comeback, alright?

5413
03:20:34,740 --> 03:20:36,200
I will remember this.

5414
03:20:36,260 --> 03:20:36,780
I'm so immersed.

5415
03:20:37,100 --> 03:20:38,020
I'm so immersed.

5416
03:20:39,980 --> 03:20:40,500
Alright.

5417
03:20:40,920 --> 03:20:45,220
Well, I believe now we will actually be rotating the camera.

5418
03:20:45,220 --> 03:20:47,920
So, thank you guys for your...

5419
03:20:48,500 --> 03:20:49,320
Thank you.

5420
03:20:49,440 --> 03:20:50,200
It was fun.

5421
03:20:50,500 --> 03:20:51,840
What a great fight.

5422
03:20:52,320 --> 03:20:53,080
It was.

5423
03:20:53,080 --> 03:20:53,440
It was.

5424
03:20:53,820 --> 03:20:54,280
Yeah.

5425
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:56,240
Congrats.

5426
03:20:58,580 --> 03:20:59,780
I'll carry on your legacy.

5427
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:02,640
You and Dokis.

5428
03:21:03,540 --> 03:21:04,220
Thank you.

5429
03:21:04,460 --> 03:21:05,780
Take it all the way, Fillion.

5430
03:21:06,760 --> 03:21:08,000
I'm ready to go my way.

5431
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:09,040
I don't like this!

5432
03:21:09,220 --> 03:21:09,960
You're supposed to be mean!

5433
03:21:12,420 --> 03:21:13,700
I'm still in my Villanox.

5434
03:21:13,880 --> 03:21:14,140
No, I'm sorry.

5435
03:21:15,220 --> 03:21:15,440
I'm not in your friendship.

5436
03:21:15,620 --> 03:21:16,560
Yo, sorry.

5437
03:21:16,640 --> 03:21:17,460
I gave you my PayPal.

5438
03:21:21,780 --> 03:21:22,720
What's going on?

5439
03:21:22,720 --> 03:21:22,920
I'll come out later.

5440
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:23,340
Don't worry.

5441
03:21:26,020 --> 03:21:26,540
Alright.

5442
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:27,280
Okay.

5443
03:21:27,360 --> 03:21:28,460
So we're rotating casters.

5444
03:21:29,520 --> 03:21:31,460
Behind the scenes Doki.

5445
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:36,240
I'm gonna kick you guys off the facking casting table now.

5446
03:21:36,660 --> 03:21:37,180
Goodbye.

5447
03:21:37,400 --> 03:21:37,920
Goodbye.

5448
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:40,720
Snap them and they're gone.

5449
03:21:41,540 --> 03:21:44,060
And then, we're gonna roll up now.

5450
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:47,780
It's our show now.

5451
03:21:47,800 --> 03:21:49,600
It's our show now.

5452
03:21:50,720 --> 03:21:51,440
Yes!

5453
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:56,220
A huge thank you to Kai and Octavio for casting.

5454
03:21:56,560 --> 03:21:58,900
That was their last match to cast.

5455
03:21:59,100 --> 03:22:03,900
And now, it's just Mint and I left for the final couple of matches.

5456
03:22:04,320 --> 03:22:06,400
And are you excited, Mint?

5457
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:09,240
You're gonna be fighting the spirit form of Matara.

5458
03:22:09,620 --> 03:22:12,140
Oh, everybody needs to be ready.

5459
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:14,060
I'm ready to fight.

5460
03:22:14,060 --> 03:22:15,140
I'm ready to fight.

5461
03:22:15,140 --> 03:22:15,200
I'm ready to fight.

5462
03:22:15,200 --> 03:22:15,660
I'm ready to pull out.

5463
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:17,600
I'm not afraid to bite.

5464
03:22:17,800 --> 03:22:18,800
I just have to say that.

5465
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:22,420
It's sad that Matara just can't really...

5466
03:22:22,420 --> 03:22:23,360
Oh yeah.

5467
03:22:23,420 --> 03:22:24,400
I'll speak for Matara.

5468
03:22:24,500 --> 03:22:27,160
Okay, hold on.

5469
03:22:27,220 --> 03:22:28,120
Okay, I got it.

5470
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:31,000
Okay, here's a...

5471
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:34,960
We're starting the rough talk, right?

5472
03:22:35,040 --> 03:22:35,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5473
03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:36,900
Go at it.

5474
03:22:37,060 --> 03:22:37,820
Hag fight.

5475
03:22:39,060 --> 03:22:39,540
Okay.

5476
03:22:43,020 --> 03:22:43,500
Okay.

5477
03:22:45,620 --> 03:22:46,660
Matara-kun!

5478
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:49,320
You are a bug.

5479
03:22:49,400 --> 03:22:50,840
What do you have to say about that?

5480
03:22:53,940 --> 03:22:55,540
I am a bug.

5481
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:59,360
And I have a lot to say about that.

5482
03:23:00,680 --> 03:23:01,960
I have...

5483
03:23:01,960 --> 03:23:03,040
For you, man?

5484
03:23:03,360 --> 03:23:04,340
For you, man?

5485
03:23:05,900 --> 03:23:07,180
For you, man?

5486
03:23:07,180 --> 03:23:07,900
Is that you?

5487
03:23:07,980 --> 03:23:08,840
For you, man?

5488
03:23:09,940 --> 03:23:12,080
No, this is Matara-kun.

5489
03:23:13,260 --> 03:23:15,640
This guy is always so needed.

5490
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:16,640
Matara-kun!

5491
03:23:16,660 --> 03:23:19,040
I didn't realize you were related to Fuyumen.

5492
03:23:19,440 --> 03:23:20,080
Matara?

5493
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:22,940
I think, um...

5494
03:23:22,940 --> 03:23:26,580
I might be a great great great descendant.

5495
03:23:26,660 --> 03:23:28,260
That's why I'm also so ugly.

5496
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:29,460
Oh, stop!

5497
03:23:30,020 --> 03:23:30,660
Oh!

5498
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:35,660
What do you have to say to Mint Matara?

5499
03:23:36,540 --> 03:23:42,040
I have to tell her that I hope she uh, kind of...

5500
03:23:42,040 --> 03:23:44,020
I hope she eats my flesh and I...

5501
03:23:44,380 --> 03:23:45,320
That's what I hope.

5502
03:23:46,820 --> 03:23:47,280
What?

5503
03:23:48,460 --> 03:23:48,920
That's...

5504
03:23:48,920 --> 03:23:54,440
No, the only foot you'll be eating is my foot, Matara-kun.

5505
03:23:59,960 --> 03:24:03,060
Interviewer, are you not gonna ask more questions, interviewer?

5506
03:24:03,160 --> 03:24:03,600
I...

5507
03:24:03,600 --> 03:24:04,420
I...

5508
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:08,640
I feel like I'm out of place, Tama, to be honest.

5509
03:24:08,780 --> 03:24:09,980
I feel like I'm very out of place.

5510
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:11,760
I shouldn't be here.

5511
03:24:11,880 --> 03:24:12,200
Goodbye.

5512
03:24:12,880 --> 03:24:13,740
Goodbye, all of us.

5513
03:24:13,740 --> 03:24:15,760
You just want to do your job!

5514
03:24:16,740 --> 03:24:19,560
Ask her some really tough questions!

5515
03:24:19,820 --> 03:24:20,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

5516
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:21,740
Ask Matara some questions!

5517
03:24:22,280 --> 03:24:23,400
Any questions!

5518
03:24:24,540 --> 03:24:25,680
Any questions?

5519
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:27,800
I... I need...

5520
03:24:28,340 --> 03:24:32,300
I need to know, since you're not physically here, are you...

5521
03:24:33,020 --> 03:24:35,900
Are you technically like a ghost spirit as well?

5522
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:38,300
So it's like ghost on ghost fighting?

5523
03:24:38,440 --> 03:24:39,340
Ghost on ghost action?

5524
03:24:40,600 --> 03:24:42,340
That's a really great question.

5525
03:24:43,760 --> 03:24:44,440
Um...

5526
03:24:44,440 --> 03:24:45,900
Why are you laughing?

5527
03:24:46,100 --> 03:24:47,240
Why are you laughing?

5528
03:24:48,500 --> 03:24:51,620
Why are you laughing, Matara?

5529
03:24:52,400 --> 03:24:55,560
Why are you laughing, Matara?

5530
03:24:55,560 --> 03:24:55,720
Why are you laughing, Matara?

5531
03:24:56,140 --> 03:24:58,520
Why are you laughing, Matara?

5532
03:24:58,880 --> 03:25:00,760
I think Matara is choking.

5533
03:25:01,380 --> 03:25:03,500
We gotta call an ambulance.

5534
03:25:04,100 --> 03:25:06,780
We need to know the harmless maneuvers.

5535
03:25:06,840 --> 03:25:07,540
She's choking.

5536
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:09,580
We need a resurrector.

5537
03:25:09,580 --> 03:25:11,700
We need to get the electric postage.

5538
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:13,120
She needs to come back to life.

5539
03:25:16,300 --> 03:25:18,120
Um, what was the question?

5540
03:25:18,340 --> 03:25:19,540
I forgot the...

5541
03:25:20,460 --> 03:25:20,720
Yeah?

5542
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:22,600
What was the question?

5543
03:25:23,060 --> 03:25:25,220
Okay, but Tyra, how are you going to beat Min?

5544
03:25:25,920 --> 03:25:26,440
Yeah?

5545
03:25:27,320 --> 03:25:34,120
Uh, I'm gonna probably first, uh, I'm gonna show her my boobs and I'm gonna show her my butt.

5546
03:25:35,100 --> 03:25:38,420
And then she'll be too embarrassed to fight me anymore.

5547
03:25:39,440 --> 03:25:40,960
Oh, damn, Min.

5548
03:25:40,960 --> 03:25:43,700
My personality is shit, so it's all I've got.

5549
03:25:43,980 --> 03:25:45,460
Oh, I...

5550
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:47,560
Well, Min, wait.

5551
03:25:48,180 --> 03:25:52,360
Well, I need to know now, Min, do you like ass and boob?

5552
03:25:53,540 --> 03:25:55,540
I'm an ass and a boob.

5553
03:25:55,540 --> 03:25:58,000
Ass is life and boob is hometown.

5554
03:25:59,220 --> 03:26:01,460
Are you gonna go ham on her boobs?

5555
03:26:02,120 --> 03:26:04,780
I'm gonna motorboat the fuck out of those boobs.

5556
03:26:04,900 --> 03:26:08,340
I'm gonna get in there, I'm gonna get in there nice and juicy, I'm gonna...

5557
03:26:09,720 --> 03:26:10,800
I'm gonna get in there.

5558
03:26:10,960 --> 03:26:12,100
I'm gonna get in there real good.

5559
03:26:12,640 --> 03:26:13,960
What the fuck?

5560
03:26:16,740 --> 03:26:22,720
Well, I guess we gotta take to the ring then so she can make her dreams come true, guys.

5561
03:26:22,720 --> 03:26:23,800
I'll see you there, Min.

5562
03:26:24,760 --> 03:26:27,060
Gotta make that dream come true.

5563
03:26:29,100 --> 03:26:32,460
Whoa, I forgot to kick them off of the stage too.

5564
03:26:32,840 --> 03:26:33,640
Give me a sec.

5565
03:26:34,340 --> 03:26:34,820
Whoops.

5566
03:26:34,960 --> 03:26:35,040
Whoops.

5567
03:26:35,120 --> 03:26:36,440
Sorry about that.

5568
03:26:36,460 --> 03:26:37,040
There we go.

5569
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:38,660
He's taking a nap.

5570
03:26:38,660 --> 03:26:41,320
We had to drag him out of the room.

5571
03:26:42,400 --> 03:26:44,100
He had a rough time.

5572
03:26:46,160 --> 03:26:49,420
Well, Min, how do you feel about fighting Matara?

5573
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:50,300
Oh my god.

5574
03:26:51,560 --> 03:26:53,860
This is my first time seeing the bottom.

5575
03:26:56,440 --> 03:27:02,200
We contacted someone to secretly make a wrestler for Min and Matara.

5576
03:27:02,660 --> 03:27:05,340
Told Min, I was like, you're gonna enjoy this.

5577
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:07,360
Oh my god, it's so good.

5578
03:27:09,900 --> 03:27:11,600
I saw the intro.

5579
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:14,820
You're definitely gonna enjoy the intro.

5580
03:27:15,100 --> 03:27:15,120
Oh no.

5581
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:15,500
Okay.

5582
03:27:16,600 --> 03:27:17,680
She's hungry.

5583
03:27:18,240 --> 03:27:21,340
Her big meaty claws are ready.

5584
03:27:22,100 --> 03:27:25,100
Flying in her cockroach stunt double.

5585
03:27:26,200 --> 03:27:28,680
It's Matara-Khan!

5586
03:27:30,520 --> 03:27:31,280
Oh my god.

5587
03:27:31,280 --> 03:27:31,820
What is she...

5588
03:27:31,820 --> 03:27:33,320
She has her wine!

5589
03:27:33,320 --> 03:27:34,320
She's Fortnite emoting.

5590
03:27:34,500 --> 03:27:37,160
She brought her red solo cup.

5591
03:27:37,580 --> 03:27:38,060
Oh my god.

5592
03:27:38,060 --> 03:27:38,780
She really did.

5593
03:27:40,300 --> 03:27:41,780
See, she's not here to fight.

5594
03:27:41,840 --> 03:27:42,580
She's here to party.

5595
03:27:42,580 --> 03:27:43,980
Yeah, she's here to party.

5596
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:45,200
It's mom time.

5597
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:53,020
She's got her wine ready and she's ready to party.

5598
03:27:53,620 --> 03:27:55,620
Look, she's showing off her butt to everybody.

5599
03:27:55,700 --> 03:27:56,660
Her boobs to everybody.

5600
03:27:56,720 --> 03:27:57,020
Yeah.

5601
03:27:57,020 --> 03:27:57,860
You're not exclusive.

5602
03:27:58,480 --> 03:28:00,200
Oh, she did not see that camera.

5603
03:28:00,920 --> 03:28:03,520
Those glasses are not helping you, Matara.

5604
03:28:03,700 --> 03:28:05,160
What are those gringers?

5605
03:28:05,680 --> 03:28:06,860
Oh my god.

5606
03:28:06,860 --> 03:28:07,600
Woah!

5607
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:09,120
For free?

5608
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:10,940
Oh my god.

5609
03:28:11,320 --> 03:28:13,080
She's showing everything.

5610
03:28:13,740 --> 03:28:14,720
Look at that dance.

5611
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:17,000
Is that what she's gonna do to me?

5612
03:28:17,120 --> 03:28:18,280
Cause me-ow.

5613
03:28:18,440 --> 03:28:19,040
Woah.

5614
03:28:20,260 --> 03:28:21,280
Which part?

5615
03:28:21,440 --> 03:28:23,040
The feet or the...?

5616
03:28:27,740 --> 03:28:30,500
Damn calm down, man.

5617
03:28:30,560 --> 03:28:32,700
There's plenty of Matara to go around.

5618
03:28:33,440 --> 03:28:34,060
Oh yeah.

5619
03:28:34,060 --> 03:28:34,280
Yeah.

5620
03:28:34,720 --> 03:28:39,880
I mean, I actually don't even know what the size differences are in the ring.

5621
03:28:40,200 --> 03:28:41,700
It'll be interesting to see.

5622
03:28:41,960 --> 03:28:44,120
All right, there you're coming up!

5623
03:28:44,120 --> 03:28:45,540
Evil beware.

5624
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:47,580
You're in for a scare.

5625
03:28:49,020 --> 03:28:56,240
Projecting herself onto the ring is our own ghost maid, dressing up as Solid Snake...

5626
03:29:00,080 --> 03:29:01,600
Oh my gosh, she took off her jacket.

5627
03:29:04,520 --> 03:29:05,560
Oh, there you are.

5628
03:29:05,660 --> 03:29:07,440
I like the little...

5629
03:29:07,440 --> 03:29:08,360
Oh!

5630
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:09,720
Oh my gosh!

5631
03:29:15,820 --> 03:29:17,900
Why are you looking at Min?

5632
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:22,040
I'm observing the situation going on here.

5633
03:29:22,200 --> 03:29:23,740
Oh, you're calculating right now.

5634
03:29:23,780 --> 03:29:26,120
Making those math equations in your head.

5635
03:29:26,120 --> 03:29:30,240
I'm seeking out every exit of this building after it explodes.

5636
03:29:31,580 --> 03:29:33,240
I'm gonna blow it up.

5637
03:29:35,420 --> 03:29:37,560
Oh, you're observing alright.

5638
03:29:38,120 --> 03:29:39,840
Oh, I don't actually wish this...

5639
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:40,620
What are you...

5640
03:29:43,640 --> 03:29:46,680
That's $100,000 of explosion right there.

5641
03:29:47,120 --> 03:29:49,780
Yeah, and I've got an ass to beat, so...

5642
03:29:49,780 --> 03:29:51,020
Turn around.

5643
03:29:52,320 --> 03:29:53,680
Oh, wait!

5644
03:29:56,560 --> 03:29:59,180
That leaves nothing to imagination.

5645
03:29:59,700 --> 03:30:01,220
Not at all.

5646
03:30:01,920 --> 03:30:03,900
Like, who am I?

5647
03:30:03,920 --> 03:30:05,740
Call my name!

5648
03:30:05,940 --> 03:30:07,580
Say my name!

5649
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:08,880
Min!

5650
03:30:09,220 --> 03:30:09,700
Min!

5651
03:30:10,140 --> 03:30:10,460
Min!

5652
03:30:12,360 --> 03:30:13,200
Lowly!

5653
03:30:13,620 --> 03:30:14,460
Min!

5654
03:30:14,800 --> 03:30:15,300
Min!

5655
03:30:15,640 --> 03:30:15,800
Min!

5656
03:30:16,080 --> 03:30:19,260
I can't hear you!

5657
03:30:24,320 --> 03:30:27,260
Oh my god, I'm going huge with power.

5658
03:30:29,480 --> 03:30:31,740
Give your... This is your spirit bomb.

5659
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:32,740
Alright, let's see.

5660
03:30:32,840 --> 03:30:36,100
Oh, she's got... Make sure she's doing her stretches right now.

5661
03:30:36,320 --> 03:30:37,400
Oh, I'm so laid back.

5662
03:30:37,520 --> 03:30:38,340
I'm ready for this.

5663
03:30:38,380 --> 03:30:38,840
I'm so ready.

5664
03:30:38,960 --> 03:30:41,060
Oh my god, look how bulky...

5665
03:30:41,060 --> 03:30:43,160
Oh my god, she's...

5666
03:30:46,180 --> 03:30:46,840
It's fine!

5667
03:30:47,060 --> 03:30:47,680
It's fine!

5668
03:30:47,820 --> 03:30:49,180
I'm getting her defenses low!

5669
03:30:49,740 --> 03:30:52,520
I mean, you got the feet right up to your face.

5670
03:30:53,220 --> 03:30:55,020
She ain't wearing any shoes.

5671
03:30:55,100 --> 03:30:55,360
It's okay!

5672
03:30:55,660 --> 03:30:58,540
You know, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?

5673
03:30:58,540 --> 03:31:00,360
What is she doing?

5674
03:31:00,880 --> 03:31:03,560
She's voting on me!

5675
03:31:03,640 --> 03:31:04,540
This is so rude!

5676
03:31:04,840 --> 03:31:07,140
She's doing her bomb dance on you!

5677
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:08,660
Oh my god!

5678
03:31:09,360 --> 03:31:11,100
This is a Fortnite avatar!

5679
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:13,220
I know I look like Snake, but come on!

5680
03:31:14,020 --> 03:31:18,360
Oh no, I don't feel very confident anymore after that.

5681
03:31:18,760 --> 03:31:18,780
Oh, oh.

5682
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:19,920
Oh god.

5683
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:20,800
It's fine.

5684
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:21,360
I'm gonna...

5685
03:31:21,360 --> 03:31:24,640
It's the Lord Farquaad cut, okay?

5686
03:31:24,680 --> 03:31:25,420
They did me dirty.

5687
03:31:32,530 --> 03:31:34,590
I mean, you're so hopeless!

5688
03:31:34,650 --> 03:31:35,970
She brought you back to the ring!

5689
03:31:36,390 --> 03:31:37,990
I win it on my own!

5690
03:31:38,010 --> 03:31:38,730
Thank you very much!

5691
03:31:40,390 --> 03:31:41,890
Oh, she missed!

5692
03:31:42,430 --> 03:31:45,470
Those glasses are the wrong prescription, Matara!

5693
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:48,170
Everyone has the same sign in the background.

5694
03:31:49,810 --> 03:31:51,330
There's like 15 people.

5695
03:31:52,010 --> 03:31:53,070
Come on, get up, Matara.

5696
03:31:53,130 --> 03:31:53,870
Look, she's lazy.

5697
03:31:54,110 --> 03:31:54,570
She's lazy.

5698
03:31:54,930 --> 03:31:56,730
She's like, no, you come to me, Mint.

5699
03:31:56,910 --> 03:31:57,470
You come to me.

5700
03:31:57,470 --> 03:31:58,910
No, she's laying on the ground.

5701
03:32:00,470 --> 03:32:01,950
She hurt her hip.

5702
03:32:02,010 --> 03:32:02,510
Bro, this is so...

5703
03:32:02,510 --> 03:32:03,230
This is a hack fight.

5704
03:32:03,410 --> 03:32:04,450
We gotta be careful.

5705
03:32:04,810 --> 03:32:05,370
Woah!

5706
03:32:06,610 --> 03:32:06,730
Woah!

5707
03:32:07,430 --> 03:32:08,970
This choke on Matara?

5708
03:32:09,550 --> 03:32:10,870
Oh my god!

5709
03:32:11,350 --> 03:32:12,530
It's my thighs!

5710
03:32:12,790 --> 03:32:13,390
My thighs!

5711
03:32:14,130 --> 03:32:15,650
The choke hold of the century!

5712
03:32:16,830 --> 03:32:19,950
Oh, and then Matara's gonna bring Mint up.

5713
03:32:20,830 --> 03:32:21,390
Ooh!

5714
03:32:21,970 --> 03:32:22,530
Already?

5715
03:32:22,950 --> 03:32:23,230
No!

5716
03:32:23,350 --> 03:32:23,890
Already?

5717
03:32:24,250 --> 03:32:24,750
One!

5718
03:32:25,110 --> 03:32:25,630
One!

5719
03:32:26,050 --> 03:32:27,430
Okay, Mint is in for it.

5720
03:32:27,430 --> 03:32:28,190
Couldn't even get to two.

5721
03:32:28,430 --> 03:32:29,730
Yeah, didn't even get to two.

5722
03:32:29,830 --> 03:32:31,530
That was a bit too early, Matara.

5723
03:32:31,770 --> 03:32:32,050
Yeah.

5724
03:32:32,990 --> 03:32:34,870
She's ready to play with me some more.

5725
03:32:34,930 --> 03:32:35,850
I'm just rolling over.

5726
03:32:36,450 --> 03:32:38,110
Oh my god, the jump, the recovery!

5727
03:32:39,570 --> 03:32:40,810
Oh, I think so.

5728
03:32:40,890 --> 03:32:41,450
The ref?

5729
03:32:41,550 --> 03:32:42,490
Come on, get out of the way, Mat.

5730
03:32:42,650 --> 03:32:43,570
Holy shit!

5731
03:32:44,010 --> 03:32:45,190
She's flipping, she's flying.

5732
03:32:45,550 --> 03:32:47,030
She's like, she's using her wings.

5733
03:32:47,150 --> 03:32:47,590
She's cheating!

5734
03:32:49,330 --> 03:32:50,990
You're literally a ghost.

5735
03:32:52,430 --> 03:32:54,530
Yeah, but I don't look very ghostly here.

5736
03:32:54,950 --> 03:32:56,670
She still looks like a damn bug.

5737
03:32:56,730 --> 03:32:57,390
What is this?

5738
03:33:00,570 --> 03:33:02,190
You can literally float.

5739
03:33:02,710 --> 03:33:03,890
What is this?

5740
03:33:03,910 --> 03:33:05,290
Oh my god!

5741
03:33:05,630 --> 03:33:06,110
Bro!

5742
03:33:06,210 --> 03:33:07,690
I thought she was gonna pin me like that.

5743
03:33:07,870 --> 03:33:10,110
Yeah, she did a fucking split on you.

5744
03:33:10,550 --> 03:33:12,250
She loves showing off.

5745
03:33:12,390 --> 03:33:13,210
Come on, get up, Mint.

5746
03:33:13,250 --> 03:33:13,890
What are you doing?

5747
03:33:14,190 --> 03:33:17,090
I mean, she has all the time she needs in the world.

5748
03:33:17,130 --> 03:33:17,270
Oh!

5749
03:33:18,030 --> 03:33:19,930
She cannot split on Mint.

5750
03:33:20,530 --> 03:33:22,230
I'm just like Solid Snake.

5751
03:33:22,330 --> 03:33:25,210
There's no microwave that can defeat me, everybody.

5752
03:33:28,150 --> 03:33:30,430
Alright, and Mint is grabbing onto Matara.

5753
03:33:30,630 --> 03:33:31,690
She's doing the flip.

5754
03:33:31,690 --> 03:33:34,350
Oh, but Matara, she's punching back on her head!

5755
03:33:34,550 --> 03:33:36,310
That's a concussion right there.

5756
03:33:36,670 --> 03:33:39,330
Yeah, why did you grab her like that, Mint?

5757
03:33:39,370 --> 03:33:39,850
What did you do?

5758
03:33:39,930 --> 03:33:40,710
Oh, the second pin!

5759
03:33:40,810 --> 03:33:41,310
Another pin!

5760
03:33:41,870 --> 03:33:42,310
One!

5761
03:33:43,130 --> 03:33:44,570
Oh, another one.

5762
03:33:44,930 --> 03:33:46,910
Matara's doing these pins a little bit too early.

5763
03:33:46,910 --> 03:33:47,690
I got the endurance.

5764
03:33:47,930 --> 03:33:49,630
Oh my god, I'm actually crawling like a rhythm mic.

5765
03:33:50,090 --> 03:33:51,410
That's just sad, Mint.

5766
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:52,210
That's just...

5767
03:33:52,210 --> 03:33:55,650
No, that was me showing how sneaky I am in the middle gear.

5768
03:33:55,750 --> 03:33:56,190
True, true.

5769
03:33:56,190 --> 03:33:59,130
Mint is performing the sneaky crawl right there.

5770
03:33:59,190 --> 03:33:59,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5771
03:33:59,810 --> 03:34:01,330
I don't think Matara saw her.

5772
03:34:02,970 --> 03:34:04,390
She's like, where did she go?

5773
03:34:04,730 --> 03:34:08,210
Oh, oh, and Matara got out of the pin, but doesn't matter!

5774
03:34:08,410 --> 03:34:10,770
Oh my god!

5775
03:34:10,850 --> 03:34:11,670
Holy shit!

5776
03:34:11,770 --> 03:34:13,590
The London Bridge suplex!

5777
03:34:14,070 --> 03:34:16,690
Of course I can pull off the London Bridge.

5778
03:34:16,830 --> 03:34:17,930
I coined the term!

5779
03:34:18,030 --> 03:34:18,670
Of course!

5780
03:34:18,770 --> 03:34:22,870
The London Bridge was created by Mint in the 1980s.

5781
03:34:22,930 --> 03:34:23,410
Yeah.

5782
03:34:23,770 --> 03:34:26,210
When she was just 70 years old.

5783
03:34:29,130 --> 03:34:30,610
A wee 70.

5784
03:34:30,790 --> 03:34:30,990
Yeah.

5785
03:34:30,990 --> 03:34:32,590
Oh my god, she just hopped over me!

5786
03:34:32,590 --> 03:34:35,590
Oh, and she hopped over you, but it didn't matter!

5787
03:34:36,110 --> 03:34:37,230
It didn't even matter.

5788
03:34:37,490 --> 03:34:40,850
She's just gonna keep gut-punching you and then another fucking grab?

5789
03:34:41,290 --> 03:34:42,390
I can take a punch.

5790
03:34:42,570 --> 03:34:43,230
I can take a, you know?

5791
03:34:43,230 --> 03:34:44,870
Okay, to be fair, you took like a thousand.

5792
03:34:45,330 --> 03:34:45,390
Okay, move.

5793
03:34:45,670 --> 03:34:49,850
Oh, and she couldn't even get up from that jump!

5794
03:34:50,750 --> 03:34:52,610
Doesn't look too good for you, Mint.

5795
03:34:53,390 --> 03:34:54,130
Doesn't look... oh!

5796
03:34:54,270 --> 03:34:55,190
She grabbed her feet?

5797
03:34:55,410 --> 03:34:56,050
Grabbed the grippers.

5798
03:34:56,750 --> 03:34:57,830
They're huge.

5799
03:34:58,010 --> 03:34:59,270
They're easy to grab, you know?

5800
03:34:59,310 --> 03:35:00,570
But Matara's coming back up.

5801
03:35:00,570 --> 03:35:02,870
She's not gonna go down without a fight.

5802
03:35:02,930 --> 03:35:05,510
Oh, I'm gonna ride her like a damn pony!

5803
03:35:05,730 --> 03:35:06,170
Come on!

5804
03:35:06,710 --> 03:35:07,870
Nay for me!

5805
03:35:09,470 --> 03:35:10,030
Nay!

5806
03:35:10,250 --> 03:35:14,030
This is some horseplay shit that we're seeing live!

5807
03:35:15,030 --> 03:35:18,350
Mint, bring in the bedroom to that ring!

5808
03:35:18,350 --> 03:35:19,090
I don't know what's going on.

5809
03:35:19,090 --> 03:35:19,970
What are you doing?

5810
03:35:21,450 --> 03:35:22,850
That's my tokusatsu.

5811
03:35:27,070 --> 03:35:28,190
And another!

5812
03:35:28,370 --> 03:35:28,950
It's a blur pin!

5813
03:35:28,950 --> 03:35:30,630
Here we go!

5814
03:35:30,630 --> 03:35:31,130
One!

5815
03:35:31,130 --> 03:35:32,070
Two!

5816
03:35:32,470 --> 03:35:33,470
Three!

5817
03:35:34,930 --> 03:35:35,930
Yes!

5818
03:35:35,990 --> 03:35:37,530
I got everybody!

5819
03:35:38,230 --> 03:35:38,550
Mint!

5820
03:35:40,730 --> 03:35:44,990
That's... I was actually very surprised, because like Matara came in fucking flailing right away.

5821
03:35:44,990 --> 03:35:47,190
She had no endurance, man.

5822
03:35:47,830 --> 03:35:48,130
Yeah.

5823
03:35:50,470 --> 03:35:55,070
The winner is...

5824
03:35:55,070 --> 03:35:55,750
Solid

5825
03:36:00,670 --> 03:36:04,230
Mint taking in another win.

5826
03:36:05,010 --> 03:36:06,510
Look at her go.

5827
03:36:06,970 --> 03:36:10,050
I guess we gotta interview the loser then, Matara.

5828
03:36:10,470 --> 03:36:11,230
Oh no!

5829
03:36:12,570 --> 03:36:14,590
How does Matara have to say?

5830
03:36:15,470 --> 03:36:16,010
Uh...

5831
03:36:16,890 --> 03:36:22,350
Matara, you talked very lowly about yourself, and I think that may have affected your performance.

5832
03:36:24,190 --> 03:36:26,970
I don't think so, so much.

5833
03:36:27,050 --> 03:36:28,210
I think, uh...

5834
03:36:29,090 --> 03:36:31,590
You know, I think, uh... I don't think.

5835
03:36:31,750 --> 03:36:32,770
I have a concussion.

5836
03:36:34,230 --> 03:36:39,030
Do you recall how many glasses of wine you had before you stepped into the match?

5837
03:36:39,810 --> 03:36:41,350
That's a great question.

5838
03:36:41,950 --> 03:36:43,290
Thank you for asking.

5839
03:36:43,950 --> 03:36:46,290
Um, you know, uh...

5840
03:36:46,290 --> 03:36:48,070
But, uh...

5841
03:36:48,070 --> 03:36:49,390
I have to say is...

5842
03:36:49,390 --> 03:36:52,230
Oh no!

5843
03:36:56,830 --> 03:36:58,010
Matara's having a stroke!

5844
03:36:58,670 --> 03:37:01,370
She's gonna live in here in cockroach life right now!

5845
03:37:02,430 --> 03:37:04,290
Someone call the ambulance!

5846
03:37:04,770 --> 03:37:06,070
She's having a stroke!

5847
03:37:11,530 --> 03:37:15,250
Somebody take her away from the town medical home!

5848
03:37:16,570 --> 03:37:17,810
Guys, okay...

5849
03:37:18,090 --> 03:37:18,910
Yeah, she's gone.

5850
03:37:19,070 --> 03:37:19,970
Alright, so, sorry...

5851
03:37:19,970 --> 03:37:20,730
Call an ambulance.

5852
03:37:21,030 --> 03:37:21,810
Please, for me.

5853
03:37:24,230 --> 03:37:27,550
Alright, so, um... Unfortunately...

5854
03:37:28,230 --> 03:37:28,870
Um...

5855
03:37:28,870 --> 03:37:36,290
She used up too much of her endurance and stamina in that match and it over-exerted her poor little heart.

5856
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:38,610
She's a real hag, you guys.

5857
03:37:38,650 --> 03:37:39,430
Like, actually.

5858
03:37:40,010 --> 03:37:41,490
And what are you?

5859
03:37:44,530 --> 03:37:45,170
Yeah!

5860
03:37:46,030 --> 03:37:46,670
Anyway...

5861
03:37:47,990 --> 03:37:49,190
Anyway, so...

5862
03:37:49,190 --> 03:37:54,850
Unfortunately, um... Let's send some thoughts and prayers to Matara and hope she recovers...

5863
03:37:54,850 --> 03:37:55,470
Uh...

5864
03:37:55,470 --> 03:37:57,590
From that heart attack after that match, guys.

5865
03:37:57,730 --> 03:37:59,270
Thoughts and prayers to Matara.

5866
03:37:59,270 --> 03:37:59,670
Thoughts and prayers.

5867
03:38:00,010 --> 03:38:00,890
Guys, thoughts and prayers.

5868
03:38:01,610 --> 03:38:02,090
Um...

5869
03:38:02,090 --> 03:38:08,050
And we'll... The WrestleTuber will make sure to send her a bouquet of flowers at her hospital bed.

5870
03:38:08,190 --> 03:38:09,510
Because she will pull through, guys.

5871
03:38:09,690 --> 03:38:11,230
We will know she can pull through.

5872
03:38:11,610 --> 03:38:12,090
Anyway!

5873
03:38:12,290 --> 03:38:14,930
It's up to the next match-up!

5874
03:38:15,050 --> 03:38:16,810
The semi-finals!

5875
03:38:18,330 --> 03:38:21,150
With Fuyauman and Benta!

5876
03:38:21,950 --> 03:38:24,170
Do we have Fuyauman and Benta?

5877
03:38:24,170 --> 03:38:25,970
For the interview room?

5878
03:38:26,650 --> 03:38:27,530
Oh, God.

5879
03:38:27,750 --> 03:38:30,250
I... I'm... I'm... I'm scared.

5880
03:38:30,850 --> 03:38:31,370
Why?

5881
03:38:31,610 --> 03:38:32,310
Why are you scared?

5882
03:38:32,310 --> 03:38:33,350
Tell us, Benta.

5883
03:38:33,370 --> 03:38:33,710
Why are you scared?

5884
03:38:33,990 --> 03:38:35,470
I've seen that thing in the ring.

5885
03:38:35,570 --> 03:38:36,250
It's not human.

5886
03:38:36,550 --> 03:38:37,070
Thing?

5887
03:38:37,470 --> 03:38:38,230
Excuse me.

5888
03:38:38,350 --> 03:38:39,010
Fuyauman is Fuyauman.

5889
03:38:39,010 --> 03:38:39,650
It's a monster!

5890
03:38:39,910 --> 03:38:40,950
He has a name!

5891
03:38:40,990 --> 03:38:41,510
Fuyauman!

5892
03:38:41,510 --> 03:38:42,370
The pronouns are Fuyo.

5893
03:38:43,070 --> 03:38:44,370
Fuyauman is Fuyauman.

5894
03:38:45,070 --> 03:38:45,930
It's Fuyauman.

5895
03:38:45,930 --> 03:38:47,830
Fuyauman, the strong little man.

5896
03:38:49,630 --> 03:38:50,670
Oh, God.

5897
03:38:52,370 --> 03:38:53,190
Let's just chill.

5898
03:38:53,230 --> 03:38:53,630
Let's just chill.

5899
03:38:53,630 --> 03:38:53,870
Let's just chill.

5900
03:38:53,870 --> 03:38:54,050
Let's just chill.

5901
03:38:54,170 --> 03:38:54,670
Oh, God.

5902
03:38:54,890 --> 03:38:55,230
It's fine.

5903
03:38:55,330 --> 03:38:55,510
It's fine.

5904
03:38:56,110 --> 03:38:57,430
Listen, I made a promise.

5905
03:38:58,490 --> 03:38:59,210
You made a promise?

5906
03:38:59,330 --> 03:38:59,910
You made a promise to who?

5907
03:39:00,130 --> 03:39:00,730
I made a promise.

5908
03:39:00,810 --> 03:39:01,110
I made a promise.

5909
03:39:01,210 --> 03:39:02,310
I beat the diaper meta.

5910
03:39:02,430 --> 03:39:03,310
The diaper meta is going down.

5911
03:39:03,430 --> 03:39:03,490
He's so smart.

5912
03:39:03,750 --> 03:39:04,710
Or I die in the ring.

5913
03:39:05,070 --> 03:39:07,250
Does this mean you're also going to grab Fuyauman by the balls?

5914
03:39:07,730 --> 03:39:08,450
If I have to.

5915
03:39:08,950 --> 03:39:11,430
I think there's going to be a diaper in the way of the balls, though.

5916
03:39:11,450 --> 03:39:11,770
Yeah.

5917
03:39:12,010 --> 03:39:13,430
How would you... There's so much padding.

5918
03:39:13,590 --> 03:39:14,550
How would you get through it?

5919
03:39:15,450 --> 03:39:16,990
With enough force, anything is possible.

5920
03:39:17,770 --> 03:39:18,090
Whoa.

5921
03:39:18,570 --> 03:39:19,470
I like that confidence.

5922
03:39:19,630 --> 03:39:19,790
You got a grister.

5923
03:39:21,750 --> 03:39:22,290
Got you.

5924
03:39:22,570 --> 03:39:22,890
Fuyauman.

5925
03:39:22,890 --> 03:39:26,430
Fuyauman, how will you prevent him from grabbing your balls?

5926
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:28,810
Fuyauman destroy.

5927
03:39:30,610 --> 03:39:31,050
What?

5928
03:39:31,310 --> 03:39:31,550
What?

5929
03:39:31,550 --> 03:39:32,330
What do I do?

5930
03:39:32,670 --> 03:39:33,830
You know, it's simple.

5931
03:39:33,910 --> 03:39:34,370
I like it.

5932
03:39:34,430 --> 03:39:35,110
Yeah, he's so simple.

5933
03:39:35,150 --> 03:39:37,670
He's such a man of his words, you know?

5934
03:39:37,690 --> 03:39:41,030
All those ladies out there swooning right now for Fuyauman.

5935
03:39:41,350 --> 03:39:42,670
Beto, come on, Beto.

5936
03:39:42,710 --> 03:39:44,770
Say something for the fans, Beto.

5937
03:39:44,830 --> 03:39:45,890
Just give us some confidence.

5938
03:39:46,110 --> 03:39:46,750
Fan service.

5939
03:39:46,930 --> 03:39:47,370
Come on.

5940
03:39:47,390 --> 03:39:48,630
What is our fan service?

5941
03:39:49,370 --> 03:39:50,370
To the fans.

5942
03:39:50,430 --> 03:39:50,810
The fans.

5943
03:39:50,870 --> 03:39:52,030
I'm going to win.

5944
03:39:52,190 --> 03:39:52,610
I'm going to win.

5945
03:39:52,610 --> 03:39:52,870
I'm going to win.

5946
03:39:52,890 --> 03:39:53,630
I'm going to take this thing all the way.

5947
03:39:53,670 --> 03:39:55,510
I got defeat of Fuyauman.

5948
03:39:56,230 --> 03:39:57,090
I got to win.

5949
03:39:57,130 --> 03:39:57,810
I got to win this whole thing.

5950
03:39:57,870 --> 03:39:58,330
I got to win it.

5951
03:39:58,370 --> 03:39:59,190
I got to win this whole thing.

5952
03:39:59,550 --> 03:40:01,030
That's right, Charlie.

5953
03:40:01,290 --> 03:40:03,210
You're going to win the whole thing.

5954
03:40:04,490 --> 03:40:05,270
The whole thing.

5955
03:40:05,330 --> 03:40:06,710
We believe in you, Charlie.

5956
03:40:07,070 --> 03:40:07,990
You got this.

5957
03:40:08,310 --> 03:40:08,910
Oh, come on.

5958
03:40:08,910 --> 03:40:09,490
Good luck, Petty.

5959
03:40:11,550 --> 03:40:13,030
We'll see you in the ring.

5960
03:40:15,310 --> 03:40:15,930
All right.

5961
03:40:16,470 --> 03:40:19,010
It seems like... I mean, people are voting for Beto.

5962
03:40:19,990 --> 03:40:21,870
People think Beto might win.

5963
03:40:21,870 --> 03:40:26,950
I tend to find the nervous ones, they have a wild side to them.

5964
03:40:27,090 --> 03:40:27,730
That's so true.

5965
03:40:27,970 --> 03:40:31,990
People underestimate just how strong they really are.

5966
03:40:32,110 --> 03:40:37,050
Maybe Beto is just giving that low confidence acting.

5967
03:40:37,390 --> 03:40:41,770
So Fuyauman will not expect it when Beto grabs the balls.

5968
03:40:42,570 --> 03:40:47,790
Well, it's also just like when you push him into a corner, their survival instincts come out.

5969
03:40:47,790 --> 03:40:47,850
Oh, true.

5970
03:40:48,030 --> 03:40:48,750
Fight or flight.

5971
03:40:48,930 --> 03:40:50,450
They go fucking wild.

5972
03:40:50,750 --> 03:40:51,090
Yeah.

5973
03:40:51,090 --> 03:40:52,350
I saw what you did to Matara.

5974
03:40:52,810 --> 03:40:53,670
I know.

5975
03:40:53,790 --> 03:40:55,590
I saw you fucking go wild.

5976
03:40:57,010 --> 03:40:58,130
I always do.

5977
03:40:59,090 --> 03:41:00,070
Oh my God.

5978
03:41:00,110 --> 03:41:00,630
Oh, there you are.

5979
03:41:00,710 --> 03:41:03,470
The first round of the semi-finals.

5980
03:41:04,750 --> 03:41:05,870
You know him.

5981
03:41:05,990 --> 03:41:07,790
The last diaper standing.

5982
03:41:08,970 --> 03:41:11,570
It's Fuyauman!

5983
03:41:13,370 --> 03:41:14,770
It's going to be pretty exciting.

5984
03:41:14,990 --> 03:41:20,150
If Fuyauman wins this match, she would have won four matches in a row.

5985
03:41:21,090 --> 03:41:21,530
That's insane.

5986
03:41:21,710 --> 03:41:22,310
That is.

5987
03:41:22,370 --> 03:41:22,550
Yeah.

5988
03:41:23,970 --> 03:41:26,630
She got that back-to-back three wins.

5989
03:41:26,810 --> 03:41:28,970
Nobody expected it, too.

5990
03:41:29,830 --> 03:41:30,650
Are you sure?

5991
03:41:31,050 --> 03:41:31,490
I mean...

5992
03:41:31,490 --> 03:41:31,910
Okay.

5993
03:41:31,910 --> 03:41:33,290
Well, the third one...

5994
03:41:33,290 --> 03:41:34,550
It's the luck of the Irish, everybody.

5995
03:41:34,670 --> 03:41:35,870
Oh, the luck of the Irish.

5996
03:41:35,910 --> 03:41:36,530
You're right.

5997
03:41:40,170 --> 03:41:41,370
Well, maybe not luck.

5998
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:42,410
Maybe it's all pure skill.

5999
03:41:43,890 --> 03:41:45,650
I mean, looking like that.

6000
03:41:46,450 --> 03:41:46,930
Wowee.

6001
03:41:48,090 --> 03:41:48,570
Yeah.

6002
03:41:49,270 --> 03:41:53,030
Oh, spreading those legs for everybody to see.

6003
03:41:53,790 --> 03:41:54,770
Very confident.

6004
03:41:55,210 --> 03:41:55,970
Fuyauman hides nothing.

6005
03:41:56,310 --> 03:41:56,550
Yeah.

6006
03:41:56,650 --> 03:41:57,670
He doesn't need to hide.

6007
03:41:57,710 --> 03:41:58,690
He knows what he's got.

6008
03:41:58,850 --> 03:42:00,610
I mean, look, his shirt is off just now.

6009
03:42:01,010 --> 03:42:04,510
Oh, he has a medal!

6010
03:42:05,450 --> 03:42:07,650
The diaper denier...

6011
03:42:08,950 --> 03:42:09,470
Beto!

6012
03:42:14,750 --> 03:42:18,550
You know, I heard Beto has, like, massive...

6013
03:42:18,550 --> 03:42:20,070
Max luck going in.

6014
03:42:20,270 --> 03:42:21,990
He might have, like...

6015
03:42:21,990 --> 03:42:28,030
You know how, like, in the skill set, you, like, go, like, skill attributes, you go max on, like, HP, strength, and everything?

6016
03:42:28,450 --> 03:42:34,870
I heard, like, Beto, he is, like, negative on everything, like, intellect, defense, strength, but the luck...

6017
03:42:34,870 --> 03:42:37,250
That's where he puts all the skill points in.

6018
03:42:37,510 --> 03:42:37,670
Oh.

6019
03:42:38,070 --> 03:42:39,250
Sometimes that's all you need.

6020
03:42:39,490 --> 03:42:39,830
I know.

6021
03:42:39,930 --> 03:42:40,630
I mean, like...

6022
03:42:41,050 --> 03:42:42,130
It took him this far.

6023
03:42:42,250 --> 03:42:44,390
He's literally in the semi-finalists now.

6024
03:42:44,630 --> 03:42:44,750
Yeah.

6025
03:42:45,150 --> 03:42:46,990
I mean, those eyes have seen everything.

6026
03:42:47,170 --> 03:42:47,850
And I mean...

6027
03:42:47,850 --> 03:42:50,030
They are viewing everything.

6028
03:42:50,370 --> 03:42:51,770
Like a goddamn chameleon.

6029
03:42:53,070 --> 03:42:55,530
Oh, Beto, why are you running away?

6030
03:42:56,050 --> 03:42:58,490
This is the semi-finals, Beto!

6031
03:42:59,150 --> 03:43:00,150
Elbow him!

6032
03:43:03,210 --> 03:43:07,270
Maybe, maybe... maybe how we talked pre-game is...

6033
03:43:07,270 --> 03:43:09,170
Maybe, like, he's got scared.

6034
03:43:09,570 --> 03:43:14,670
I truly thought Fuyoman was gonna throw him out like trash, you know?

6035
03:43:14,670 --> 03:43:14,810
I know.

6036
03:43:17,950 --> 03:43:19,190
Just taking him out.

6037
03:43:19,990 --> 03:43:21,350
Take him out early.

6038
03:43:21,830 --> 03:43:24,950
To be fair, I feel like they're in the wrong weight class.

6039
03:43:25,430 --> 03:43:25,590
Like...

6040
03:43:25,590 --> 03:43:27,330
I feel like that, too.

6041
03:43:27,370 --> 03:43:29,470
We should not be fighting Beto right now.

6042
03:43:29,810 --> 03:43:30,250
Like...

6043
03:43:31,110 --> 03:43:34,950
Beto can be snapped like a goddamn twig at the moment.

6044
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:36,610
Beto has the height, you know?

6045
03:43:36,610 --> 03:43:37,770
It gives him a little bit of height.

6046
03:43:37,790 --> 03:43:38,590
He does have the height, yeah.

6047
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:39,290
Oh.

6048
03:43:40,790 --> 03:43:41,350
Beto, no.

6049
03:43:41,390 --> 03:43:41,990
Don't crawl away.

6050
03:43:42,110 --> 03:43:44,090
We still have, like, three more minutes of this game.

6051
03:43:44,330 --> 03:43:44,730
Beto.

6052
03:43:46,750 --> 03:43:48,390
He had to keep going.

6053
03:43:48,690 --> 03:43:50,630
Show us the ball grab!

6054
03:43:51,230 --> 03:43:51,590
Yeah!

6055
03:43:52,310 --> 03:43:55,110
Who is your bet on, Dokie?

6056
03:43:55,330 --> 03:43:55,830
My bet?

6057
03:43:56,030 --> 03:43:59,130
I think... you know, I feel like the luck might play into it, honestly.

6058
03:43:59,350 --> 03:44:02,210
I believe Beto might actually pull through to the finals.

6059
03:44:03,810 --> 03:44:04,910
Okay, we'll see.

6060
03:44:05,070 --> 03:44:10,810
I mean, it's gonna be interesting to see the guy that, like, was the most underestimated wrestler...

6061
03:44:10,810 --> 03:44:14,710
...who had no confidence on himself suddenly pulling through to the finals.

6062
03:44:14,710 --> 03:44:16,590
Suddenly pulling through.

6063
03:44:16,790 --> 03:44:17,210
Oh!

6064
03:44:18,190 --> 03:44:19,910
Beto, I just talked, like, mad shit.

6065
03:44:19,990 --> 03:44:20,310
Come on.

6066
03:44:20,410 --> 03:44:20,950
Give it up.

6067
03:44:24,030 --> 03:44:26,090
That was pretty rough.

6068
03:44:26,390 --> 03:44:28,350
I mean, this is how I started, you know?

6069
03:44:28,390 --> 03:44:28,990
Yeah, exactly!

6070
03:44:29,530 --> 03:44:30,110
Like, Matara pummeled...

6071
03:44:30,110 --> 03:44:32,030
You gotta get pushed into a corner.

6072
03:44:32,230 --> 03:44:32,570
Come on!

6073
03:44:32,910 --> 03:44:35,730
Yeah, Matara pummeled the shitter out of you, but then you made it.

6074
03:44:35,750 --> 03:44:36,250
You recovered.

6075
03:44:36,350 --> 03:44:39,410
You had the stamina for the long-term gaming.

6076
03:44:40,070 --> 03:44:44,250
Oh, and then the fucking grapple throw into the ring.

6077
03:44:44,350 --> 03:44:44,690
Oh!

6078
03:44:44,690 --> 03:44:45,930
And then the stomp on the head.

6079
03:44:46,290 --> 03:44:48,590
He's just casually kicking him, like...

6080
03:44:48,590 --> 03:44:50,390
He's not even, like, wrestling.

6081
03:44:50,510 --> 03:44:51,490
It's just a street fight.

6082
03:44:51,670 --> 03:44:53,290
It's just a regular fight.

6083
03:44:54,290 --> 03:44:57,270
I like the fancy little twisty punch he did, though.

6084
03:44:57,410 --> 03:44:58,890
The twisty neck.

6085
03:44:59,170 --> 03:44:59,850
A little spin.

6086
03:44:59,970 --> 03:45:01,250
A little spin and a punch.

6087
03:45:01,670 --> 03:45:03,930
Fuyo-man, you gotta be fighting in the ring!

6088
03:45:04,090 --> 03:45:04,970
Also, Beto...

6089
03:45:04,970 --> 03:45:05,710
Three!

6090
03:45:06,090 --> 03:45:06,770
The kiss!

6091
03:45:07,930 --> 03:45:08,890
The taunt.

6092
03:45:08,890 --> 03:45:09,630
Oh, yeah.

6093
03:45:09,750 --> 03:45:12,090
He's blowing you a kiss of good luck, Beto.

6094
03:45:12,150 --> 03:45:14,250
You gotta take that to maximize more of your luck.

6095
03:45:14,250 --> 03:45:14,810
Oh!

6096
03:45:14,950 --> 03:45:15,430
I like that.

6097
03:45:15,550 --> 03:45:16,250
And I got his name.

6098
03:45:16,290 --> 03:45:16,590
Look at that!

6099
03:45:16,650 --> 03:45:17,250
Oh my god!

6100
03:45:17,730 --> 03:45:19,590
That kiss made him stronger.

6101
03:45:19,850 --> 03:45:20,790
Oh my god.

6102
03:45:20,850 --> 03:45:21,410
And the flip!

6103
03:45:22,290 --> 03:45:23,550
The flip jump.

6104
03:45:23,590 --> 03:45:26,350
And the fucking... Oh my god!

6105
03:45:26,430 --> 03:45:27,970
Is this just a fighting game?

6106
03:45:28,070 --> 03:45:29,070
Is this just Tekken?

6107
03:45:32,230 --> 03:45:34,590
I know those movesets in Tekken!

6108
03:45:36,970 --> 03:45:39,390
He plays one Tekken and is now an expert.

6109
03:45:39,390 --> 03:45:40,650
Yeah, the one-two-one!

6110
03:45:42,590 --> 03:45:45,230
The one-two-one down-up-one?

6111
03:45:47,610 --> 03:45:49,490
That was my favorite combo.

6112
03:45:49,490 --> 03:45:52,310
Oh my god, we have favorite combo in Tekken.

6113
03:45:54,010 --> 03:45:57,250
But it looks like... Oh, but Fuyo-man's gonna grab him.

6114
03:45:57,430 --> 03:45:58,590
Is he gonna fucking Bane him?

6115
03:45:58,750 --> 03:45:59,810
Oh, and then the first pin!

6116
03:45:59,810 --> 03:46:00,230
Oh, the pin!

6117
03:46:00,290 --> 03:46:00,530
The pin!

6118
03:46:00,930 --> 03:46:01,450
One!

6119
03:46:01,610 --> 03:46:02,150
One!

6120
03:46:02,150 --> 03:46:03,690
Oh, just one.

6121
03:46:04,070 --> 03:46:04,950
Just one.

6122
03:46:05,070 --> 03:46:05,430
Still another shot.

6123
03:46:05,770 --> 03:46:07,850
Still another shot here for Beto.

6124
03:46:07,850 --> 03:46:10,030
What is in Fuyo-man's pants?

6125
03:46:10,650 --> 03:46:13,770
I mean... you know what's in his pants.

6126
03:46:14,070 --> 03:46:15,370
On the back side?

6127
03:46:16,230 --> 03:46:17,230
On the back?

6128
03:46:17,250 --> 03:46:17,910
Oh, the back side!

6129
03:46:18,310 --> 03:46:19,010
Oh, I see.

6130
03:46:19,070 --> 03:46:20,170
You think I meant...

6131
03:46:22,710 --> 03:46:25,370
You also know what's in his pants.

6132
03:46:26,550 --> 03:46:28,590
I'm being told that it's a coin.

6133
03:46:28,790 --> 03:46:29,490
Oh, I see.

6134
03:46:30,230 --> 03:46:32,790
I hope it's not a chocolate coin.

6135
03:46:33,070 --> 03:46:33,390
No.

6136
03:46:36,410 --> 03:46:38,370
But that's how leprechoins make coins!

6137
03:46:38,770 --> 03:46:40,370
That's how they fill the coins up.

6138
03:46:40,370 --> 03:46:40,590
Oh, what?

6139
03:46:41,530 --> 03:46:42,510
Oh, man.

6140
03:46:42,510 --> 03:46:42,990
Oh, so close!

6141
03:46:43,050 --> 03:46:45,250
He got a two while Fuyo-man got a one.

6142
03:46:47,130 --> 03:46:49,130
Come on, Fuyo-man, get up!

6143
03:46:49,510 --> 03:46:50,330
Oh, Beto!

6144
03:46:50,330 --> 03:46:55,630
Oh, I just see Fuyo-man go into the corner and like down a handful of Lucky Charms and see what happens.

6145
03:46:56,150 --> 03:47:03,450
I like how Beto removed one of the cushions in the ring, and then Fuyo-man used it against him.

6146
03:47:05,250 --> 03:47:06,030
Beto, no!

6147
03:47:06,190 --> 03:47:09,330
You're supposed to use that to your advantage!

6148
03:47:09,810 --> 03:47:10,330
Beto!

6149
03:47:10,330 --> 03:47:10,830
Oh, come on!

6150
03:47:10,950 --> 03:47:11,850
One step away!

6151
03:47:12,570 --> 03:47:13,770
He's gargoyling.

6152
03:47:13,830 --> 03:47:14,610
He's gargoyling.

6153
03:47:14,890 --> 03:47:15,490
Okay.

6154
03:47:15,710 --> 03:47:16,630
Oh, oh, oh!

6155
03:47:16,770 --> 03:47:17,990
What was the point?

6156
03:47:18,050 --> 03:47:20,270
Beto missed, but Fuyo also missed.

6157
03:47:21,010 --> 03:47:25,230
I guess like Beto's frail body just couldn't take it.

6158
03:47:25,650 --> 03:47:26,250
Throw him out!

6159
03:47:26,250 --> 03:47:26,250
Throw him out!

6160
03:47:26,250 --> 03:47:27,590
And he hits the ring.

6161
03:47:28,190 --> 03:47:29,190
Hits the ring.

6162
03:47:29,830 --> 03:47:31,630
What is that move called, Mint?

6163
03:47:31,730 --> 03:47:33,130
What is he doing right now?

6164
03:47:33,910 --> 03:47:34,510
That...

6165
03:47:35,430 --> 03:47:38,330
That was a flying...

6166
03:47:38,330 --> 03:47:39,910
That was the soaring eagle.

6167
03:47:40,010 --> 03:47:41,010
The soaring eagle?

6168
03:47:41,110 --> 03:47:42,910
I think that's an actual real wrestling move.

6169
03:47:47,730 --> 03:47:48,710
Oh, shoot!

6170
03:47:48,870 --> 03:47:49,650
That was in their pen!

6171
03:47:49,950 --> 03:47:50,450
One!

6172
03:47:50,890 --> 03:47:51,490
Two!

6173
03:47:51,690 --> 03:47:52,050
Damn!

6174
03:47:52,970 --> 03:47:55,590
I really thought... I really thought...

6175
03:47:56,130 --> 03:47:56,850
Oh, my God.

6176
03:47:57,210 --> 03:47:58,910
Oh, and another jump kick!

6177
03:48:00,470 --> 03:48:01,910
Come on, Beto!

6178
03:48:02,970 --> 03:48:05,630
Your pens were all so close!

6179
03:48:06,210 --> 03:48:06,870
So close!

6180
03:48:07,450 --> 03:48:08,070
Oh, but the...

6181
03:48:08,330 --> 03:48:09,750
Oh, is Beto out of stamina?

6182
03:48:10,210 --> 03:48:11,770
Oh, this could be bad.

6183
03:48:11,770 --> 03:48:14,270
I feel like Beto hasn't really moved that much, if any.

6184
03:48:14,510 --> 03:48:18,130
Oh, I like how Fuyo-man moved him from side to side diagonally.

6185
03:48:18,250 --> 03:48:20,770
It's like a little house decorating project right there.

6186
03:48:20,830 --> 03:48:21,170
Yeah!

6187
03:48:22,550 --> 03:48:25,470
That's called the... That's called the Patrick Star, where you...

6188
03:48:25,470 --> 03:48:27,990
Take my Beto and move it over there.

6189
03:48:29,170 --> 03:48:30,470
I was so close!

6190
03:48:32,450 --> 03:48:34,550
The Patrick Star maneuver.

6191
03:48:35,130 --> 03:48:35,810
Oh, no.

6192
03:48:35,850 --> 03:48:37,390
Fuyo-man is going to tell it to the crowd.

6193
03:48:37,390 --> 03:48:38,710
Are you not entertained?

6194
03:48:39,990 --> 03:48:41,090
Oh, I'm quite entertained.

6195
03:48:41,290 --> 03:48:42,910
This is a great... This is a great match.

6196
03:48:43,250 --> 03:48:46,010
Beto, just... You can't just grab him and think it's over, Beto.

6197
03:48:46,050 --> 03:48:47,370
You gotta do more than that.

6198
03:48:47,610 --> 03:48:50,410
Oh, and then Beto... Oh, he... Did he miss?

6199
03:48:50,590 --> 03:48:53,030
I couldn't tell if Fuyo just tripped or he missed.

6200
03:48:54,150 --> 03:48:56,050
And he stomps him on the head.

6201
03:48:56,530 --> 03:48:58,290
Look at him writhing on the ground.

6202
03:48:58,390 --> 03:48:59,190
It's so sad.

6203
03:48:59,550 --> 03:49:00,850
Just... Someone...

6204
03:49:01,220 --> 03:49:02,830
Someone help this leprechaun.

6205
03:49:03,450 --> 03:49:05,710
Someone quick find his pot of gold!

6206
03:49:05,710 --> 03:49:10,790
And then Beto jumps out of the ring to do a die.

6207
03:49:12,170 --> 03:49:13,830
Beto with his colorful hair.

6208
03:49:13,950 --> 03:49:15,150
He's the end of the rainbow.

6209
03:49:15,570 --> 03:49:17,690
Oh, oh, and he does a special move.

6210
03:49:17,910 --> 03:49:18,270
Oh!

6211
03:49:19,510 --> 03:49:20,730
That's gonna hurt.

6212
03:49:21,530 --> 03:49:25,090
Oh, but Fuyo-man fucking knees him in the face.

6213
03:49:25,590 --> 03:49:26,070
Three!

6214
03:49:26,510 --> 03:49:27,470
Come on, guys.

6215
03:49:27,530 --> 03:49:28,650
You guys get out of the ring.

6216
03:49:28,710 --> 03:49:30,350
You can't pin it outside the ring.

6217
03:49:30,470 --> 03:49:31,050
Y'all get in.

6218
03:49:31,690 --> 03:49:31,750
Yeah.

6219
03:49:32,550 --> 03:49:33,990
Just throwing him around.

6220
03:49:34,630 --> 03:49:35,110
Four!

6221
03:49:36,490 --> 03:49:37,250
Oh my gosh.

6222
03:49:37,330 --> 03:49:37,630
Five!

6223
03:49:37,630 --> 03:49:38,610
Are we gonna see them?

6224
03:49:38,650 --> 03:49:39,950
Are we gonna see them get timed out?

6225
03:49:39,950 --> 03:49:40,810
Both disqualified?

6226
03:49:41,190 --> 03:49:41,530
Yeah.

6227
03:49:42,150 --> 03:49:44,710
If both get timed out outside the ring, what happens?

6228
03:49:45,070 --> 03:49:48,570
Well, are we gonna see it for the first time live on this stream?

6229
03:49:48,650 --> 03:49:49,050
No, no, no.

6230
03:49:49,370 --> 03:49:51,410
But we could see someone get disqualified.

6231
03:49:52,290 --> 03:49:53,130
Oh, seven!

6232
03:49:53,230 --> 03:49:54,470
Oh, seven is gonna close!

6233
03:49:55,170 --> 03:49:58,110
Beto, knock him out so he can go inside!

6234
03:49:58,790 --> 03:49:59,010
Eight!

6235
03:49:59,010 --> 03:49:59,570
Oh my god.

6236
03:49:59,570 --> 03:50:02,450
Oh, Beto slid in like a ferret.

6237
03:50:02,510 --> 03:50:02,870
Oh my god.

6238
03:50:02,870 --> 03:50:04,010
Is Flu-Met at...

6239
03:50:04,010 --> 03:50:04,430
Nine!

6240
03:50:04,430 --> 03:50:04,990
No!

6241
03:50:04,990 --> 03:50:07,830
Wait, Flu-Met got him D-tiered?

6242
03:50:07,850 --> 03:50:08,770
Ten!

6243
03:50:08,850 --> 03:50:12,870
Oh my god!

6244
03:50:12,910 --> 03:50:16,250
Beto eliminated both diaper players!

6245
03:50:17,110 --> 03:50:20,190
The diapers are no more!

6246
03:50:21,510 --> 03:50:27,890
Say hello to the diaper denier, the diaper vanquisher, Beto!

6247
03:50:28,810 --> 03:50:29,730
Wow.

6248
03:50:29,990 --> 03:50:31,310
Oh my god.

6249
03:50:31,470 --> 03:50:32,550
I think...

6250
03:50:32,550 --> 03:50:35,230
That was just embarrassing for Fuyo!

6251
03:50:35,630 --> 03:50:36,830
That was so...

6252
03:50:36,830 --> 03:50:38,670
Yeah, Fuyo really started so strong.

6253
03:50:38,970 --> 03:50:39,650
It's just...

6254
03:50:39,650 --> 03:50:40,190
Wow.

6255
03:50:40,210 --> 03:50:48,570
The fact that like she got eliminated from outside the ring, the one of the most embarrassing ways to get eliminated by.

6256
03:50:48,650 --> 03:50:49,070
Yeah!

6257
03:50:49,070 --> 03:50:52,330
I mean, I guess Beto is just a, you know, he's a potty trainer believer.

6258
03:50:52,710 --> 03:50:53,290
I know!

6259
03:50:53,630 --> 03:50:58,830
He's teaching all those babies how to use the bathroom, how to use the toilet.

6260
03:50:59,170 --> 03:50:59,430
Yeah!

6261
03:50:59,430 --> 03:51:01,590
Well, I guess we'll see what Beto says.

6262
03:51:01,590 --> 03:51:03,270
And also Fuyo!

6263
03:51:03,510 --> 03:51:05,530
Back to the interview stage, I guess.

6264
03:51:05,870 --> 03:51:06,270
Yeah!

6265
03:51:08,990 --> 03:51:09,750
Fuyo man!

6266
03:51:10,630 --> 03:51:11,490
Fuyo man!

6267
03:51:11,630 --> 03:51:12,170
What happened?

6268
03:51:13,290 --> 03:51:14,790
Fuyo man beep dee.

6269
03:51:20,080 --> 03:51:22,380
Well, I hope you get some good...

6270
03:51:22,380 --> 03:51:22,920
Kindness is cruel.

6271
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:28,980
Well, now we know why...

6272
03:51:28,980 --> 03:51:31,400
Fuyo man will try, little man, some other day.

6273
03:51:31,560 --> 03:51:32,520
Some other day.

6274
03:51:32,540 --> 03:51:33,900
Well, I hope you get some good...

6275
03:51:33,900 --> 03:51:34,480
I hope it'll be recorded.

6276
03:51:34,620 --> 03:51:36,020
I'll record it on my iPhone.

6277
03:51:36,280 --> 03:51:39,200
And it's, sadly, past Fuyo man's bedtime.

6278
03:51:39,520 --> 03:51:39,820
Bedtime.

6279
03:51:40,160 --> 03:51:40,480
Yeah.

6280
03:51:40,960 --> 03:51:42,320
Oh, Mr. Beto.

6281
03:51:42,360 --> 03:51:43,320
How did you do it?

6282
03:51:43,380 --> 03:51:45,420
How did you become the diaper denier?

6283
03:51:45,880 --> 03:51:47,680
You know, it's just, you know, I...

6284
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:48,540
I don't know.

6285
03:51:48,620 --> 03:51:52,520
I mean, I got flung around like a hacky sack for about 90% of the match.

6286
03:51:52,700 --> 03:51:56,060
But I think, I think a little bit of luck actually came in at the end there.

6287
03:51:56,540 --> 03:51:56,780
Wow!

6288
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:57,320
Hey.

6289
03:51:57,460 --> 03:51:59,280
Nobody expected that from...

6290
03:51:59,280 --> 03:52:01,060
You didn't even expect to win yourself.

6291
03:52:01,500 --> 03:52:02,600
I can't believe it.

6292
03:52:04,900 --> 03:52:08,800
Do you have some... like, do you actually have some self-confidence now?

6293
03:52:10,440 --> 03:52:10,920
Yes.

6294
03:52:10,920 --> 03:52:13,220
That diaper just got changed.

6295
03:52:16,120 --> 03:52:17,080
Fuyomen destroy.

6296
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:19,280
Please get this thing out of here.

6297
03:52:19,280 --> 03:52:20,040
I can't do this.

6298
03:52:20,080 --> 03:52:20,820
I don't want to do this.

6299
03:52:22,840 --> 03:52:26,320
Alright, Fuyomen, come on, it's your bedtime now, Fuyomen.

6300
03:52:26,440 --> 03:52:28,740
We gotta take you out to Fuyomen.

6301
03:52:28,740 --> 03:52:29,240
Have fun.

6302
03:52:29,940 --> 03:52:31,220
Goodbye, Fuyomen.

6303
03:52:33,260 --> 03:52:34,300
Goodbye, Fuyomen.

6304
03:52:34,560 --> 03:52:35,100
Bye-bye.

6305
03:52:36,620 --> 03:52:43,840
Bero, you will be fighting either Mint or Fillion in the finals.

6306
03:52:44,240 --> 03:52:48,400
How do you feel, Bero, to move this far up in this tournament?

6307
03:52:49,300 --> 03:52:51,020
You know, I didn't think I'd get this far.

6308
03:52:51,140 --> 03:52:56,480
Frankly, I didn't think I'd make it past the first round, but to see myself here, I am just over the moon.

6309
03:52:56,720 --> 03:52:58,060
I'm so excited.

6310
03:52:58,140 --> 03:52:58,720
But you know what?

6311
03:52:58,740 --> 03:52:59,700
I've said it since the beginning.

6312
03:52:59,840 --> 03:53:00,740
I'm taking this whole thing.

6313
03:53:00,820 --> 03:53:01,700
This whole thing, it's mine.

6314
03:53:01,880 --> 03:53:04,120
You want that belt, don't you, Bero?

6315
03:53:04,320 --> 03:53:05,600
That belt belongs to me.

6316
03:53:05,960 --> 03:53:07,180
Oh, well then.

6317
03:53:07,280 --> 03:53:09,980
Well, I guess we'll see who you're going to be fighting next.

6318
03:53:10,200 --> 03:53:16,100
Because up next, we have Fillion versus Mint in the semi-finals.

6319
03:53:16,900 --> 03:53:18,400
Let's see if Fillion's ready.

6320
03:53:18,620 --> 03:53:20,660
Can we bring Fillion into the stage?

6321
03:53:20,760 --> 03:53:22,100
Into the interview room?

6322
03:53:22,200 --> 03:53:22,660
Fillion.

6323
03:53:23,240 --> 03:53:24,680
And kick Bero out?

6324
03:53:24,860 --> 03:53:25,500
Yo, what up, gamers?

6325
03:53:27,420 --> 03:53:28,140
Alright, Fillion.

6326
03:53:28,140 --> 03:53:28,340
Hello.

6327
03:53:28,740 --> 03:53:29,240
You're not in the finals yet?

6328
03:53:29,360 --> 03:53:30,420
You're in semis.

6329
03:53:30,420 --> 03:53:31,040
You're semis.

6330
03:53:31,060 --> 03:53:32,360
You're going to be fighting Mint here.

6331
03:53:32,560 --> 03:53:33,540
One of our casters.

6332
03:53:33,660 --> 03:53:34,600
How many people are the fight?

6333
03:53:35,020 --> 03:53:35,800
Two more.

6334
03:53:36,020 --> 03:53:36,860
Two more, yeah.

6335
03:53:37,780 --> 03:53:40,420
I'm fighting an entire effing army right now.

6336
03:53:40,500 --> 03:53:44,220
I feel like effing Leonidas and then like the effing Persians coming at me.

6337
03:53:44,540 --> 03:53:45,520
What is this?

6338
03:53:45,980 --> 03:53:46,520
I'm feeling good.

6339
03:53:47,840 --> 03:53:48,720
You're fighting...

6340
03:53:48,720 --> 03:53:49,380
What am I fighting?

6341
03:53:50,440 --> 03:53:51,880
Fillion fighting a lot of people.

6342
03:53:52,060 --> 03:53:52,500
Who am I fighting?

6343
03:53:52,500 --> 03:53:52,500
Mint.

6344
03:53:52,500 --> 03:53:54,120
You're fighting Mint, our other caster.

6345
03:53:54,220 --> 03:53:54,420
Mint, yeah.

6346
03:53:54,520 --> 03:53:56,460
Yeah, this is going to be caster versus caster.

6347
03:53:57,020 --> 03:53:58,200
No, I can't do this.

6348
03:53:59,120 --> 03:54:00,040
Can I just...

6349
03:54:00,040 --> 03:54:00,580
Yeah?

6350
03:54:00,640 --> 03:54:01,800
I just want to see y'all duke it out.

6351
03:54:02,780 --> 03:54:03,140
Please.

6352
03:54:03,180 --> 03:54:03,940
Just like fight each other.

6353
03:54:03,980 --> 03:54:04,580
Like, snack talk.

6354
03:54:04,720 --> 03:54:05,020
Please.

6355
03:54:05,240 --> 03:54:05,760
You know what?

6356
03:54:05,760 --> 03:54:07,320
I can't have the caster on caster violence.

6357
03:54:07,780 --> 03:54:08,700
There's just no way.

6358
03:54:09,020 --> 03:54:10,740
You know what I'm more surprised by?

6359
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:13,260
Like, the fact that Fillion made it this far.

6360
03:54:13,340 --> 03:54:14,560
But like, look at her.

6361
03:54:14,640 --> 03:54:16,000
She looks emancipated.

6362
03:54:16,320 --> 03:54:19,660
She looks like she has no muscle in that... in those bones.

6363
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:21,340
Fillion, are you just going to take that?

6364
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:24,440
Yeah, I mean, I built a beef jerky zombie from Dark Souls 1.

6365
03:54:24,620 --> 03:54:26,680
That's my name, by the way.

6366
03:54:27,140 --> 03:54:28,140
I know, I know.

6367
03:54:28,220 --> 03:54:28,960
But here's the thing.

6368
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:29,460
Here's the thing.

6369
03:54:29,520 --> 03:54:29,840
Here's the thing.

6370
03:54:29,940 --> 03:54:31,420
You know who knows Bill like me?

6371
03:54:31,880 --> 03:54:32,320
Who?

6372
03:54:32,980 --> 03:54:33,420
Luffy.

6373
03:54:33,740 --> 03:54:35,840
And he's going to be king of the pirates.

6374
03:54:36,020 --> 03:54:36,360
That's true.

6375
03:54:36,860 --> 03:54:36,960
Cool.

6376
03:54:37,840 --> 03:54:40,060
Also, yeah, I'm not emancipated.

6377
03:54:40,120 --> 03:54:40,860
I don't have freedom yet.

6378
03:54:40,980 --> 03:54:41,300
So...

6379
03:54:41,300 --> 03:54:41,600
Oh.

6380
03:54:42,000 --> 03:54:42,440
Yeah.

6381
03:54:43,260 --> 03:54:43,700
Wait.

6382
03:54:43,700 --> 03:54:45,260
Sorry, I said the wrong word.

6383
03:54:45,580 --> 03:54:47,020
Did you mean Amacia?

6384
03:54:47,140 --> 03:54:47,840
I thought you...

6385
03:54:48,400 --> 03:54:51,380
What's the right way when you're like malnourished?

6386
03:54:51,440 --> 03:54:53,220
She looks malnourished like hell.

6387
03:54:53,760 --> 03:54:54,900
Okay, I'm malnourished.

6388
03:54:54,960 --> 03:54:55,220
Great.

6389
03:54:55,460 --> 03:54:55,760
Okay.

6390
03:54:55,760 --> 03:54:57,800
This is why Doki got eliminated.

6391
03:54:58,140 --> 03:54:58,840
This is why.

6392
03:54:59,680 --> 03:55:00,320
I'm sorry.

6393
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:01,680
I don't seem too good here.

6394
03:55:01,960 --> 03:55:02,200
Wait, Doki.

6395
03:55:02,380 --> 03:55:04,920
I'm literally carrying your legacy right now.

6396
03:55:04,940 --> 03:55:05,540
Oh, shit.

6397
03:55:05,540 --> 03:55:06,060
You're right.

6398
03:55:06,180 --> 03:55:06,200
And you're going to blame me.

6399
03:55:06,460 --> 03:55:06,860
Sorry.

6400
03:55:07,100 --> 03:55:07,500
Sorry.

6401
03:55:07,760 --> 03:55:09,200
Aillion, kick her ass.

6402
03:55:09,800 --> 03:55:11,120
Hey, hey, wait a second.

6403
03:55:14,200 --> 03:55:15,000
Good luck to you, too.

6404
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:16,560
Mid, defend yourself, Mid.

6405
03:55:16,680 --> 03:55:18,380
Mid didn't even get a chance to defend herself.

6406
03:55:19,540 --> 03:55:20,620
What did she have to defend, though?

6407
03:55:21,180 --> 03:55:22,200
What are you... What are you saying?

6408
03:55:22,260 --> 03:55:22,780
What are you talking about?

6409
03:55:23,220 --> 03:55:24,600
No one talks shit.

6410
03:55:24,600 --> 03:55:25,480
Oh.

6411
03:55:26,140 --> 03:55:28,900
Wait, did not... Oh yeah, because I talk shit for her.

6412
03:55:29,320 --> 03:55:29,340
Yeah.

6413
03:55:30,500 --> 03:55:31,360
Yeah, you did.

6414
03:55:35,680 --> 03:55:36,640
Aillion, roaster.

6415
03:55:37,620 --> 03:55:38,800
You just let her...

6416
03:55:39,900 --> 03:55:40,980
I'm just sitting here.

6417
03:55:41,060 --> 03:55:41,560
I'm feeling good.

6418
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:43,400
I'm not gonna roaster.

6419
03:55:43,880 --> 03:55:44,680
You're not gonna roaster?

6420
03:55:44,840 --> 03:55:45,080
Whoa.

6421
03:55:46,680 --> 03:55:49,200
Because she's my friend in the making.

6422
03:55:49,400 --> 03:55:49,880
Awww.

6423
03:55:50,440 --> 03:55:54,580
As the future king of the pirates meant, if I win, you have to join my army.

6424
03:55:54,580 --> 03:55:54,820
My crew.

6425
03:55:55,120 --> 03:55:55,480
Oh.

6426
03:55:55,600 --> 03:55:55,840
Oh.

6427
03:55:56,440 --> 03:55:56,620
Oh.

6428
03:55:56,860 --> 03:55:59,000
I'm not- Wait, what kind of pirating are we doing?

6429
03:55:59,740 --> 03:56:00,100
Pirate.

6430
03:56:00,780 --> 03:56:01,780
The legal kind.

6431
03:56:01,800 --> 03:56:02,700
I'm making songs off my own.

6432
03:56:05,380 --> 03:56:08,940
It's a small time gig, but you know, in the- You know, we'll be mafia in the future.

6433
03:56:09,100 --> 03:56:09,600
You know what I'm saying?

6434
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:09,900
Okay.

6435
03:56:10,140 --> 03:56:10,500
Okay.

6436
03:56:10,940 --> 03:56:11,300
Okay.

6437
03:56:11,440 --> 03:56:11,800
Mafia?

6438
03:56:11,860 --> 03:56:12,160
Okay.

6439
03:56:12,360 --> 03:56:12,500
Okay.

6440
03:56:12,740 --> 03:56:12,900
Uh.

6441
03:56:12,980 --> 03:56:13,220
Um.

6442
03:56:13,420 --> 03:56:15,420
Is it alright, Fillion, if I wipe your ass?

6443
03:56:16,300 --> 03:56:16,660
Um.

6444
03:56:16,700 --> 03:56:16,860
Um.

6445
03:56:16,860 --> 03:56:17,380
That's gay.

6446
03:56:17,960 --> 03:56:18,320
So.

6447
03:56:18,400 --> 03:56:18,420
So.

6448
03:56:18,720 --> 03:56:18,880
So.

6449
03:56:19,240 --> 03:56:20,000
I mean, hey.

6450
03:56:20,100 --> 03:56:20,720
No, no, no.

6451
03:56:20,860 --> 03:56:21,140
Listen.

6452
03:56:21,300 --> 03:56:22,200
We're not there yet, okay?

6453
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:22,800
Okay.

6454
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:23,320
Let's just wait.

6455
03:56:23,700 --> 03:56:24,060
Okay.

6456
03:56:24,060 --> 03:56:24,260
Oh, yeah.

6457
03:56:24,260 --> 03:56:24,500
Oh my gosh.

6458
03:56:24,620 --> 03:56:25,180
On the ring.

6459
03:56:25,360 --> 03:56:26,080
Yeah, on the ring.

6460
03:56:28,340 --> 03:56:30,380
To get it started in a ring.

6461
03:56:30,600 --> 03:56:31,440
Alright, let's go.

6462
03:56:31,600 --> 03:56:33,000
Off to the ring we go.

6463
03:56:35,300 --> 03:56:35,740
Alright.

6464
03:56:36,540 --> 03:56:36,980
Alright.

6465
03:56:37,060 --> 03:56:38,140
I'm here in the ring.

6466
03:56:40,460 --> 03:56:42,500
You're doing your projection right now.

6467
03:56:42,780 --> 03:56:43,220
Yup.

6468
03:56:43,380 --> 03:56:44,280
Oh my gosh.

6469
03:56:44,300 --> 03:56:45,200
Alright, here we go.

6470
03:56:45,200 --> 03:56:46,660
Look, I'm loyal to the mission, okay?

6471
03:56:46,660 --> 03:56:48,360
Let's start the match now.

6472
03:56:48,980 --> 03:56:50,340
Alright, let me make that pull.

6473
03:56:51,120 --> 03:56:52,400
You know what would be so sad?

6474
03:56:52,520 --> 03:56:53,040
If I lose.

6475
03:56:53,400 --> 03:56:53,740
Yeah?

6476
03:56:54,060 --> 03:56:58,060
After Fillion has wrestled so many people and I just didn't watch.

6477
03:56:59,660 --> 03:57:01,120
That's so true.

6478
03:57:01,380 --> 03:57:02,540
It'll be so sad.

6479
03:57:03,300 --> 03:57:04,000
Oh my gosh.

6480
03:57:04,060 --> 03:57:06,160
She like fought her way here and just showed up.

6481
03:57:06,300 --> 03:57:07,500
It's your king of the furry pirates.

6482
03:57:08,300 --> 03:57:14,020
It's Fillion making her way to the stage with some weird Fortnite dance.

6483
03:57:15,500 --> 03:57:17,820
I love how like, you know like her matches.

6484
03:57:18,080 --> 03:57:22,080
Like all she does is flip and it's like, it's so true to her character.

6485
03:57:22,080 --> 03:57:23,500
Those are the scariest ones.

6486
03:57:23,540 --> 03:57:23,940
Yeah.

6487
03:57:24,060 --> 03:57:25,780
Those are the scariest ones.

6488
03:57:25,980 --> 03:57:31,280
Like, like the fact that she does like 20 flips into a kick is so scary.

6489
03:57:31,360 --> 03:57:32,220
Just like Luffy.

6490
03:57:35,100 --> 03:57:38,160
I don't even remember your move set, Mitt.

6491
03:57:38,220 --> 03:57:39,720
All I remember is you crawling away.

6492
03:57:40,000 --> 03:57:40,460
That's like...

6493
03:57:40,460 --> 03:57:43,660
My move set is get my ass kicked until I'm ready.

6494
03:57:45,320 --> 03:57:48,580
Until my masochist points rank up and then I'm like, yeah.

6495
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:49,300
Yeah.

6496
03:57:51,320 --> 03:57:57,580
It's like you absorb all the damage in and then like after absorbing all of it, you let out one punch.

6497
03:57:57,820 --> 03:58:00,100
One punch with all that damage power.

6498
03:58:00,640 --> 03:58:02,600
It's basically how it's true.

6499
03:58:03,540 --> 03:58:06,080
There she goes dancing her way.

6500
03:58:06,620 --> 03:58:08,900
Dancing her way to freedom.

6501
03:58:09,320 --> 03:58:10,560
To the finals.

6502
03:58:10,560 --> 03:58:11,980
The carefree ones.

6503
03:58:12,160 --> 03:58:12,620
Oh my God.

6504
03:58:12,620 --> 03:58:14,080
She's break dancing now.

6505
03:58:14,140 --> 03:58:14,820
She's busking.

6506
03:58:14,960 --> 03:58:16,740
She's busking for coins, guys.

6507
03:58:17,480 --> 03:58:19,960
Oh, if only we could take the coin from Fuyo's...

6508
03:58:19,960 --> 03:58:20,880
Fuyo's ass.

6509
03:58:20,940 --> 03:58:21,240
Fuyo's ass?

6510
03:58:21,680 --> 03:58:22,240
Yeah.

6511
03:58:22,700 --> 03:58:24,840
You might want to wash it off a little bit.

6512
03:58:26,940 --> 03:58:28,140
Oh shit.

6513
03:58:28,220 --> 03:58:28,560
Hello?

6514
03:58:29,360 --> 03:58:30,200
Solid Mitt.

6515
03:58:30,760 --> 03:58:33,300
It's time for you to get on the stage.

6516
03:58:33,800 --> 03:58:40,100
Because Solid Mitt is sneaking in to face off against Fillion.

6517
03:58:40,500 --> 03:58:44,060
Give it up for Solid Mitt.

6518
03:58:45,560 --> 03:58:46,600
Oh my God.

6519
03:58:48,500 --> 03:58:50,580
Mitt, Mitt, she's here.

6520
03:58:51,400 --> 03:58:55,540
She's here analyzing the arena again.

6521
03:58:55,640 --> 03:58:56,640
Even though she wouldn't.

6522
03:58:57,080 --> 03:58:58,340
Even though she shouldn't have this knowledge again.

6523
03:58:58,340 --> 03:58:58,940
Okay, it might have changed.

6524
03:58:58,940 --> 03:59:00,720
It might have changed in the last ten minutes.

6525
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:01,420
Changed in ten minutes?

6526
03:59:03,900 --> 03:59:05,980
I don't know about that, Mitt.

6527
03:59:06,020 --> 03:59:09,500
I think you might need to get your head checked after the concussion Matara gave you.

6528
03:59:09,860 --> 03:59:12,720
I needed to get my head checked before then, don't you?

6529
03:59:13,100 --> 03:59:13,500
Oh, true.

6530
03:59:15,340 --> 03:59:16,960
Since you were born.

6531
03:59:17,860 --> 03:59:21,120
The doctors were like, maybe there's something wrong.

6532
03:59:21,540 --> 03:59:23,980
Since I was born and then I died.

6533
03:59:24,700 --> 03:59:27,920
And then I never got it checked out.

6534
03:59:29,940 --> 03:59:31,140
Knock, knock.

6535
03:59:31,220 --> 03:59:32,220
Is anybody home?

6536
03:59:32,900 --> 03:59:34,480
It's me, the champion.

6537
03:59:34,920 --> 03:59:37,760
Oh, the future champion right here.

6538
03:59:38,340 --> 03:59:39,040
Oh yeah.

6539
03:59:39,860 --> 03:59:42,680
He's telling everybody, say my name.

6540
03:59:42,680 --> 03:59:44,560
Say my name.

6541
03:59:44,880 --> 03:59:45,340
Say my name.

6542
03:59:45,340 --> 03:59:45,940
Say my name.

6543
03:59:48,610 --> 03:59:50,810
Say her name, chat.

6544
03:59:51,330 --> 03:59:52,570
Say her name.

6545
03:59:53,370 --> 03:59:55,470
Who said solid farquaad?

6546
04:00:03,740 --> 04:00:06,740
Farquaad is in his anime phase right now.

6547
04:00:08,060 --> 04:00:09,820
He dyed his hair.

6548
04:00:10,640 --> 04:00:12,520
Yeah, you know.

6549
04:00:13,840 --> 04:00:14,800
It's a comeback.

6550
04:00:15,000 --> 04:00:15,260
It's a look.

6551
04:00:15,300 --> 04:00:16,140
It's coming back, everybody.

6552
04:00:16,360 --> 04:00:16,840
It's coming back.

6553
04:00:17,100 --> 04:00:18,460
She's bringing it back.

6554
04:00:18,460 --> 04:00:20,280
She's bringing the Farquaad back.

6555
04:00:20,480 --> 04:00:22,440
Oh my god, Fillion lane.

6556
04:00:22,660 --> 04:00:23,740
Fillion is so fast.

6557
04:00:23,820 --> 04:00:26,460
Yeah, she's so fucking fast.

6558
04:00:26,940 --> 04:00:27,380
Oh my god.

6559
04:00:27,600 --> 04:00:29,660
I mean look at her build.

6560
04:00:29,880 --> 04:00:30,360
It's okay.

6561
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:31,420
Min is absorbing.

6562
04:00:31,540 --> 04:00:36,000
You're absorbing all the damage so that you can't do one power kick.

6563
04:00:36,620 --> 04:00:37,840
Yummy yummy yummy.

6564
04:00:38,040 --> 04:00:38,460
Give me more.

6565
04:00:38,460 --> 04:00:39,180
Hurt me more.

6566
04:00:39,240 --> 04:00:40,040
Keep pummeling her, Fillion.

6567
04:00:40,160 --> 04:00:41,360
Keep pummeling her.

6568
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:46,040
She likes it.

6569
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:47,280
Oh yeah.

6570
04:00:48,460 --> 04:00:48,940
Oh my god.

6571
04:00:48,960 --> 04:00:51,080
And now she's like, wait, are you getting pinned already?

6572
04:00:51,460 --> 04:00:52,420
I don't think so.

6573
04:00:52,680 --> 04:00:55,420
No, she's just breaking your... yeah, she's just breaking your wrist.

6574
04:00:55,700 --> 04:00:59,060
Oh, she asked the audience and they were like, no don't do it.

6575
04:00:59,120 --> 04:01:00,400
That's too much.

6576
04:01:00,880 --> 04:01:02,360
No, don't do the wrist breaker.

6577
04:01:02,820 --> 04:01:04,440
That's bad in 20 countries.

6578
04:01:05,240 --> 04:01:10,120
Oh, and then Fillion picks you up and elbows you in the fucking stomach.

6579
04:01:10,120 --> 04:01:11,820
I can't even get a move in.

6580
04:01:12,420 --> 04:01:13,980
Yeah, because you're not supposed to.

6581
04:01:14,000 --> 04:01:14,900
It's the first two minutes.

6582
04:01:15,760 --> 04:01:16,900
Oh, what am I?

6583
04:01:17,220 --> 04:01:17,660
What?

6584
04:01:17,740 --> 04:01:18,440
What did you do?

6585
04:01:18,460 --> 04:01:19,600
What was that, Mint?

6586
04:01:19,680 --> 04:01:20,360
What was that move?

6587
04:01:20,980 --> 04:01:25,240
I think I did the... I can't even tell you.

6588
04:01:25,280 --> 04:01:25,980
I just made it up.

6589
04:01:26,140 --> 04:01:26,860
Oh my god.

6590
04:01:26,880 --> 04:01:28,740
What a pioneer in wrestling.

6591
04:01:29,080 --> 04:01:31,240
Mint literally just made up... wait, already?

6592
04:01:31,540 --> 04:01:31,740
One!

6593
04:01:31,960 --> 04:01:32,400
Two!

6594
04:01:32,580 --> 04:01:32,700
Two!

6595
04:01:33,960 --> 04:01:38,960
If Fillion lost there, that would be the biggest upset of the century.

6596
04:01:39,480 --> 04:01:40,760
It would have been way too quick.

6597
04:01:40,900 --> 04:01:42,340
I think I even... I would have been disappointed.

6598
04:01:42,540 --> 04:01:44,400
Yeah, even like it just wasn't fair.

6599
04:01:44,540 --> 04:01:45,340
It was just fighting.

6600
04:01:45,540 --> 04:01:47,840
Like, look at how malnourished she is.

6601
04:01:48,000 --> 04:01:48,440
Did he...

6602
04:01:48,440 --> 04:01:49,460
Did anyone feed her?

6603
04:01:49,800 --> 04:01:52,540
Did anyone feed Fillion at all?

6604
04:01:52,940 --> 04:01:54,500
Did we just keep her in a cage?

6605
04:01:54,920 --> 04:01:58,180
Is she yellow from being a Simpsons or is she yellow from...

6606
04:01:58,180 --> 04:01:58,560
Kidney failure.

6607
04:01:58,740 --> 04:02:00,380
From the scurvy?

6608
04:02:00,560 --> 04:02:02,120
Yeah, the scurvy.

6609
04:02:03,060 --> 04:02:07,500
So, but I feel like we've kept Fillion in a cage since this was announced.

6610
04:02:09,160 --> 04:02:10,560
Oh my god, come on, Mint!

6611
04:02:10,820 --> 04:02:11,560
Mint, no!

6612
04:02:11,560 --> 04:02:13,240
Don't get DQ'd from the outside of the room!

6613
04:02:13,240 --> 04:02:14,320
She got a Kodak coil!

6614
04:02:14,420 --> 04:02:15,820
She's picking up the code!

6615
04:02:16,660 --> 04:02:17,700
I did.

6616
04:02:19,480 --> 04:02:21,260
Sorry, she's on a call right now.

6617
04:02:21,340 --> 04:02:23,520
She had a cell phone to pick up.

6618
04:02:23,540 --> 04:02:25,200
Oh my god, please, somebody...

6619
04:02:25,200 --> 04:02:25,980
One!

6620
04:02:27,260 --> 04:02:29,260
I feel like there's no way.

6621
04:02:29,460 --> 04:02:31,940
We're at the end of the last match for I'm outside the ring.

6622
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:33,360
There's no way it'll be twice in a row.

6623
04:02:33,700 --> 04:02:34,160
Right!

6624
04:02:35,720 --> 04:02:39,400
You're picking her up and you do a suplex and in a row... wait, it's a continuous grab?

6625
04:02:39,840 --> 04:02:40,800
Oh my god!

6626
04:02:41,040 --> 04:02:42,180
Two fucking grabs!

6627
04:02:43,280 --> 04:02:45,500
What a wall in Tekken terms.

6628
04:02:45,580 --> 04:02:47,580
That was a down forward... I'm doing...

6629
04:02:47,580 --> 04:02:48,760
I'm doing my original move again.

6630
04:02:50,100 --> 04:02:51,060
We should come up.

6631
04:02:51,140 --> 04:02:53,060
You know what, Doki, I'll give you the honors.

6632
04:02:53,180 --> 04:02:53,920
What do you want to call it?

6633
04:02:54,260 --> 04:02:56,340
I think I'll call it scrambling the egg.

6634
04:02:57,000 --> 04:02:57,440
Scrambling?

6635
04:02:57,440 --> 04:02:59,700
Yeah, you're scrambling her egg right now.

6636
04:03:00,800 --> 04:03:01,940
Oh, another pin!

6637
04:03:02,640 --> 04:03:03,080
One!

6638
04:03:03,880 --> 04:03:04,320
Two!

6639
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:07,440
Going for another round!

6640
04:03:08,500 --> 04:03:09,460
Okay, come on.

6641
04:03:09,700 --> 04:03:12,340
Alright, if you're gonna go for another round, you should get up instantly at that point.

6642
04:03:12,720 --> 04:03:14,800
I know she's gonna have her comeback now.

6643
04:03:14,920 --> 04:03:15,760
Yep, she's gonna...

6644
04:03:15,760 --> 04:03:17,720
Oh, it's a bait!

6645
04:03:17,900 --> 04:03:18,180
It's a bait!

6646
04:03:18,260 --> 04:03:18,520
One!

6647
04:03:19,140 --> 04:03:19,660
Two!

6648
04:03:20,200 --> 04:03:21,960
It was just a bait.

6649
04:03:22,380 --> 04:03:24,380
You're in for another fight, Mint.

6650
04:03:25,180 --> 04:03:26,320
You're ready to...

6651
04:03:26,320 --> 04:03:27,240
I'm ready to go.

6652
04:03:27,800 --> 04:03:29,160
Ready to go again.

6653
04:03:29,400 --> 04:03:30,400
Oh, and she chucks you out.

6654
04:03:30,400 --> 04:03:31,720
I'm ready to go outside the ring.

6655
04:03:32,280 --> 04:03:33,600
You wanna go outside, Mint?

6656
04:03:33,660 --> 04:03:34,200
You wanna go outside?

6657
04:03:35,680 --> 04:03:36,200
Outside?

6658
04:03:36,480 --> 04:03:36,820
Outside?

6659
04:03:37,020 --> 04:03:37,580
You said outside?

6660
04:03:37,900 --> 04:03:39,040
Oh my god!

6661
04:03:39,380 --> 04:03:41,200
She's about to walk the dog.

6662
04:03:42,260 --> 04:03:43,300
Oh, she's laughing at me.

6663
04:03:43,300 --> 04:03:44,440
This is so embarrassing.

6664
04:03:44,480 --> 04:03:45,840
That's a little embarrassing.

6665
04:03:46,020 --> 04:03:47,180
We just met each other.

6666
04:03:47,300 --> 04:03:50,260
You're really gonna let this zoomer laugh at you?

6667
04:03:51,080 --> 04:03:51,920
Oh gosh.

6668
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:54,520
As a hag, are you really gonna let this zoomer do this?

6669
04:03:54,520 --> 04:03:55,700
I have more worldly experience, okay?

6670
04:03:55,820 --> 04:03:56,840
I can teach a...

6671
04:03:56,840 --> 04:03:58,700
You can teach this little kid a lesson?

6672
04:03:59,180 --> 04:03:59,520
Yeah.

6673
04:04:00,740 --> 04:04:04,040
This is literally like a fight between the old and the new.

6674
04:04:04,920 --> 04:04:06,280
Who would win this?

6675
04:04:07,200 --> 04:04:08,520
The new... the rookie?

6676
04:04:08,760 --> 04:04:09,660
Or the...

6677
04:04:10,760 --> 04:04:11,980
Or the boomer?

6678
04:04:11,980 --> 04:04:12,400
I mean...

6679
04:04:13,300 --> 04:04:16,160
You have to learn from the old to not repeat history, you know?

6680
04:04:16,200 --> 04:04:17,140
Oh, that's true.

6681
04:04:17,360 --> 04:04:17,840
That's true.

6682
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:20,680
Is she learning anything in that furry brain of hers?

6683
04:04:22,200 --> 04:04:25,080
I think she just wants food in that brain of hers.

6684
04:04:25,240 --> 04:04:25,380
Right?

6685
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:29,540
When somebody has to get her something.

6686
04:04:29,640 --> 04:04:30,940
Another suplex!

6687
04:04:31,380 --> 04:04:32,700
Oh my god, the lucky bridge!

6688
04:04:32,980 --> 04:04:34,280
The lucky bridge won!

6689
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:38,980
If you got that, that would have been fucking crazy.

6690
04:04:39,020 --> 04:04:39,880
That would have been insane.

6691
04:04:39,940 --> 04:04:41,180
That would have been insane.

6692
04:04:41,220 --> 04:04:43,120
But she did it with a bracelet on you!

6693
04:04:44,300 --> 04:04:45,180
Wait, wait!

6694
04:04:45,220 --> 04:04:45,760
Are you tapping out?

6695
04:04:45,840 --> 04:04:46,400
Are you tapping out?

6696
04:04:46,600 --> 04:04:47,700
No, no, no!

6697
04:04:47,780 --> 04:04:47,860
Keep

6698
04:04:50,960 --> 04:04:51,400
going!

6699
04:04:51,620 --> 04:04:53,000
You can still breathe!

6700
04:04:54,520 --> 04:04:55,380
Yeah, I can.

6701
04:04:55,720 --> 04:05:00,080
You're not gonna lie, when you did that move earlier, I was like, damn, she's flexible.

6702
04:05:00,580 --> 04:05:00,940
Ah!

6703
04:05:02,560 --> 04:05:04,560
Oh my god, you're bubbling her!

6704
04:05:05,420 --> 04:05:06,380
Oh my god!

6705
04:05:06,400 --> 04:05:07,260
She can take a hint.

6706
04:05:07,720 --> 04:05:08,320
Grab her tail!

6707
04:05:08,880 --> 04:05:10,180
Oh yeah, grab her tail!

6708
04:05:10,740 --> 04:05:11,440
Grab her tail!

6709
04:05:11,440 --> 04:05:12,100
Don't let her do this!

6710
04:05:12,220 --> 04:05:12,920
She missed!

6711
04:05:13,340 --> 04:05:14,400
You dodged it!

6712
04:05:15,980 --> 04:05:17,060
Oh, and then some other...

6713
04:05:17,060 --> 04:05:18,200
Might be another pin right here.

6714
04:05:18,360 --> 04:05:19,220
Oh my god!

6715
04:05:19,620 --> 04:05:20,620
It took her down!

6716
04:05:20,620 --> 04:05:21,260
A kneecap to the skull!

6717
04:05:22,980 --> 04:05:24,540
Oh my god, and the kick to the head!

6718
04:05:24,540 --> 04:05:26,000
I picked her up just to bring her down.

6719
04:05:26,320 --> 04:05:29,280
Bro, she's spitting on the crowd with how hard you're hitting!

6720
04:05:30,720 --> 04:05:32,200
Oh, and she's coming out of the ring.

6721
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:32,720
Running away.

6722
04:05:33,400 --> 04:05:35,800
She's getting a reset right now.

6723
04:05:36,040 --> 04:05:38,000
That's a tactical reset right there.

6724
04:05:38,040 --> 04:05:39,540
It was the concussion.

6725
04:05:39,580 --> 04:05:40,440
She didn't know where she was.

6726
04:05:40,520 --> 04:05:40,840
Yeah.

6727
04:05:41,560 --> 04:05:42,340
She's like...

6728
04:05:42,340 --> 04:05:43,200
Come on, pit her!

6729
04:05:43,240 --> 04:05:43,620
Yeah!

6730
04:05:44,100 --> 04:05:44,620
One!

6731
04:05:45,400 --> 04:05:45,920
Two!

6732
04:05:46,520 --> 04:05:48,940
Oh, and it wasn't ready.

6733
04:05:49,340 --> 04:05:50,320
It wasn't ready.

6734
04:05:51,000 --> 04:05:52,460
Fillion, just do the 20 flips!

6735
04:05:52,720 --> 04:05:54,360
That's all you have to do, Fillion!

6736
04:05:55,360 --> 04:05:56,680
I'll do 20 more!

6737
04:05:57,240 --> 04:05:59,260
Oh, and then... what was that?

6738
04:05:59,440 --> 04:06:00,060
I don't know.

6739
04:06:00,180 --> 04:06:03,060
I think Mr. Farquaad got drunk there.

6740
04:06:03,480 --> 04:06:07,900
I was... that was my, like, Spiderman roleplay.

6741
04:06:08,060 --> 04:06:08,420
What the fuck?

6742
04:06:08,420 --> 04:06:10,240
She brick danced on your face!

6743
04:06:13,400 --> 04:06:14,200
Oh, that was pretty...

6744
04:06:14,200 --> 04:06:15,980
Oh, that was crazy!

6745
04:06:16,340 --> 04:06:17,280
Oh, you're getting another...

6746
04:06:17,280 --> 04:06:17,840
You're getting pinned!

6747
04:06:18,080 --> 04:06:19,120
Wait, this might be it!

6748
04:06:19,140 --> 04:06:19,640
One!

6749
04:06:21,340 --> 04:06:21,760
Two!

6750
04:06:22,760 --> 04:06:23,740
Not it!

6751
04:06:24,320 --> 04:06:26,480
Mitt is ready for another round.

6752
04:06:26,960 --> 04:06:27,880
Come on.

6753
04:06:28,780 --> 04:06:31,160
And another... and another pin!

6754
04:06:31,700 --> 04:06:32,820
Oh my god, wait!

6755
04:06:33,140 --> 04:06:33,760
One!

6756
04:06:33,840 --> 04:06:34,460
Two!

6757
04:06:36,020 --> 04:06:37,260
One more!

6758
04:06:37,280 --> 04:06:38,240
I really thought that was it!

6759
04:06:38,240 --> 04:06:39,100
One more!

6760
04:06:39,120 --> 04:06:40,660
I really thought that was it!

6761
04:06:41,320 --> 04:06:42,980
Mitt is going one more!

6762
04:06:43,280 --> 04:06:44,320
It's not over!

6763
04:06:44,460 --> 04:06:46,180
I gotta finish my story!

6764
04:06:46,460 --> 04:06:47,620
It's not over!

6765
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:51,360
I'm coming back from the dead.

6766
04:06:51,620 --> 04:06:52,700
Oh, she's doing the sneaky.

6767
04:06:52,860 --> 04:06:54,140
She's doing the tactical sneak.

6768
04:06:54,180 --> 04:06:55,000
Yeah, I'm sneaking, I'm sneaking.

6769
04:06:55,080 --> 04:06:56,280
She's sneaking right now.

6770
04:06:56,520 --> 04:06:57,600
She's gotta take a break.

6771
04:06:57,660 --> 04:06:57,880
She's like, water break.

6772
04:06:57,880 --> 04:06:59,620
Why am I taking a break in the corner?

6773
04:07:01,020 --> 04:07:04,100
She's like, Give me a sec, I need a water break.

6774
04:07:04,220 --> 04:07:05,500
My haggen stinks, I really...

6775
04:07:06,280 --> 04:07:07,760
Okay, it could be anyone.

6776
04:07:07,900 --> 04:07:09,960
Seriously, the next pin, it's gotta be it.

6777
04:07:10,180 --> 04:07:12,500
Oh, but it doesn't look too good for you, Mitt.

6778
04:07:12,640 --> 04:07:14,180
It doesn't look too good for you.

6779
04:07:14,420 --> 04:07:15,500
I know, I'm pretty tired.

6780
04:07:15,560 --> 04:07:16,100
I'm not gonna lie.

6781
04:07:17,900 --> 04:07:20,700
She's like, Please, just one water break.

6782
04:07:20,900 --> 04:07:22,140
That's all I want.

6783
04:07:23,480 --> 04:07:24,880
Oh, she's climbing up.

6784
04:07:26,040 --> 04:07:26,500
Miss!

6785
04:07:26,500 --> 04:07:26,960
Miss!

6786
04:07:27,060 --> 04:07:27,520
Miss!

6787
04:07:27,760 --> 04:07:29,540
The crowd's cheering her on.

6788
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:31,280
And she hits those!

6789
04:07:32,660 --> 04:07:33,120
She...

6790
04:07:33,720 --> 04:07:34,400
Wait, what?

6791
04:07:35,500 --> 04:07:37,320
Oh, my God!

6792
04:07:37,500 --> 04:07:38,820
You teleported her!

6793
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:43,600
Oh, my God!

6794
04:07:44,500 --> 04:07:45,040
Oh, my God!

6795
04:07:45,040 --> 04:07:46,940
breathes out of that!

6796
04:07:47,440 --> 04:07:49,860
The teleporting!

6797
04:07:51,140 --> 04:07:52,860
How is that legal?

6798
04:07:52,860 --> 04:07:53,600
What is she doing?

6799
04:07:54,180 --> 04:07:56,300
Another big personal kid.

6800
04:07:56,700 --> 04:07:57,780
You really...

6801
04:07:57,780 --> 04:08:00,080
You're gonna lose after teleporting!

6802
04:08:00,080 --> 04:08:00,300
Oh, no!

6803
04:08:00,420 --> 04:08:00,920
Oh, no!

6804
04:08:00,940 --> 04:08:02,600
One, two!

6805
04:08:10,860 --> 04:08:12,020
Teleporting, Mitt!

6806
04:08:12,380 --> 04:08:20,060
Your winner heading to the finals is not SolidFarQuad, but it's Philly!

6807
04:08:20,480 --> 04:08:21,300
Oh, no!

6808
04:08:24,120 --> 04:08:25,180
You know what?

6809
04:08:25,280 --> 04:08:26,940
At least I beat Mittara.

6810
04:08:27,120 --> 04:08:27,780
That's all that matters.

6811
04:08:27,860 --> 04:08:34,340
I can't believe it.

6812
04:08:34,340 --> 04:08:37,840
You did the Undertaker teleport behind you move.

6813
04:08:37,840 --> 04:08:39,140
But it was just...

6814
04:08:39,620 --> 04:08:40,300
I still lost!

6815
04:08:40,320 --> 04:08:41,520
I still lost!

6816
04:08:42,060 --> 04:08:44,660
That would have been so hard, Mitt!

6817
04:08:46,440 --> 04:08:47,500
But it's okay.

6818
04:08:47,800 --> 04:08:48,680
It's okay, Mitt.

6819
04:08:48,700 --> 04:08:49,700
You did your best.

6820
04:08:49,920 --> 04:08:51,340
Now let's go talk to Philly.

6821
04:08:51,460 --> 04:08:53,040
She's heading to the finals!

6822
04:08:53,480 --> 04:08:55,200
Against a better...

6823
04:08:58,820 --> 04:08:59,660
Oh, my God.

6824
04:09:00,020 --> 04:09:01,060
Oh, my God.

6825
04:09:01,480 --> 04:09:02,860
Dude, what the hell?

6826
04:09:03,540 --> 04:09:04,360
You said...

6827
04:09:04,360 --> 04:09:06,120
Whoa, whoa, the audio...

6828
04:09:06,120 --> 04:09:07,100
What the fuck?

6829
04:09:08,220 --> 04:09:09,780
The audio was like...

6830
04:09:09,780 --> 04:09:11,060
Yeah, it was kind of going a little crazy.

6831
04:09:12,660 --> 04:09:14,340
Dude, the game is angry!

6832
04:09:17,260 --> 04:09:19,240
Mitt Honda was in the fucking game!

6833
04:09:19,300 --> 04:09:19,740
Holy shit!

6834
04:09:20,460 --> 04:09:21,360
What's going on?

6835
04:09:21,420 --> 04:09:22,060
What's going on?

6836
04:09:22,060 --> 04:09:22,760
I can't hear it!

6837
04:09:22,880 --> 04:09:25,620
I can't hear it!

6838
04:09:25,680 --> 04:09:26,640
What's going on?

6839
04:09:27,320 --> 04:09:27,800
It's Discord.

6840
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:28,320
It's Discord.

6841
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:28,640
Don't worry.

6842
04:09:28,760 --> 04:09:28,820
Don't worry.

6843
04:09:28,880 --> 04:09:30,200
That was funny.

6844
04:09:30,200 --> 04:09:30,740
That was funny.

6845
04:09:31,560 --> 04:09:32,900
But, well, Mitt.

6846
04:09:33,560 --> 04:09:35,720
Will you be joining Philly's pirate ship?

6847
04:09:36,400 --> 04:09:37,320
I guess so.

6848
04:09:37,600 --> 04:09:39,280
I guess... I don't know.

6849
04:09:39,300 --> 04:09:39,960
What am I gonna have to do?

6850
04:09:40,000 --> 04:09:40,700
Swap the poop deck?

6851
04:09:42,440 --> 04:09:44,140
Mitt, you were a worthy opponent.

6852
04:09:44,500 --> 04:09:46,180
One of the toughest I've ever faced.

6853
04:09:47,040 --> 04:09:47,900
And you know what?

6854
04:09:48,060 --> 04:09:49,620
I have a spot on my crew just for you.

6855
04:09:49,900 --> 04:09:51,500
On the right hand of my ship.

6856
04:09:52,040 --> 04:09:53,260
Leading my steering wheel.

6857
04:09:53,640 --> 04:09:54,080
What?

6858
04:09:54,300 --> 04:09:55,520
She can't drive, though.

6859
04:09:56,180 --> 04:09:56,800
Yes, I can.

6860
04:09:56,900 --> 04:09:57,220
Shut up!

6861
04:09:58,280 --> 04:09:59,220
I can't either.

6862
04:09:59,320 --> 04:10:00,120
So we're in the same boat.

6863
04:10:01,600 --> 04:10:02,000
Literally.

6864
04:10:03,540 --> 04:10:05,140
So, Mitt, I want to say...

6865
04:10:05,560 --> 04:10:05,960
I'd be honored.

6866
04:10:05,960 --> 04:10:06,800
I thought you were gonna win.

6867
04:10:06,860 --> 04:10:09,660
But 90% of that fight, I was on the ropes.

6868
04:10:09,800 --> 04:10:15,140
But the moment you teleported behind me, the moment you had that anime moment, I knew I couldn't lose to you.

6869
04:10:15,220 --> 04:10:19,060
Because if I did, I would never be able to have someone so strong on my team.

6870
04:10:20,540 --> 04:10:20,940
Wow.

6871
04:10:21,340 --> 04:10:21,600
Wow.

6872
04:10:22,660 --> 04:10:23,540
I mean, yeah.

6873
04:10:23,780 --> 04:10:24,860
You took that moment.

6874
04:10:24,940 --> 04:10:30,080
It was like a real shonen protagonist moment where all hope was lost for you.

6875
04:10:31,640 --> 04:10:32,880
You manifested it.

6876
04:10:32,940 --> 04:10:33,900
You manifested your win.

6877
04:10:34,520 --> 04:10:34,920
Yup.

6878
04:10:34,960 --> 04:10:36,060
So here's what we're gonna do.

6879
04:10:36,140 --> 04:10:37,720
We're gonna go to the grocery store together.

6880
04:10:37,940 --> 04:10:39,380
And we're gonna buy a bunch of stuff.

6881
04:10:39,640 --> 04:10:40,860
You're gonna pay for it.

6882
04:10:41,080 --> 04:10:43,640
And then we'll have a really sick nasty dinner.

6883
04:10:45,380 --> 04:10:46,760
Wait, that sounds so normal.

6884
04:10:47,020 --> 04:10:49,540
That sounds like such a normal plan from the builder.

6885
04:10:49,560 --> 04:10:49,900
Exactly.

6886
04:10:50,180 --> 04:10:51,160
Wait, can you cook?

6887
04:10:51,820 --> 04:10:52,220
No.

6888
04:10:52,340 --> 04:10:53,360
I can make you a cereal.

6889
04:10:53,360 --> 04:10:54,160
Yeah.

6890
04:10:54,700 --> 04:10:55,880
That's about my level too.

6891
04:10:56,180 --> 04:10:58,460
Oh, so you basically hired a maid!

6892
04:10:59,200 --> 04:11:00,280
Oh my god!

6893
04:11:00,480 --> 04:11:01,340
We can make cereal!

6894
04:11:02,260 --> 04:11:03,740
You hired a maid!

6895
04:11:03,820 --> 04:11:05,600
You got a maid for your pirate ship!

6896
04:11:06,320 --> 04:11:06,940
Wait, true!

6897
04:11:07,140 --> 04:11:08,040
I'm a maid, cafe maid.

6898
04:11:08,120 --> 04:11:08,840
We don't do anything.

6899
04:11:09,960 --> 04:11:12,360
But you can draw pictures on our food.

6900
04:11:12,480 --> 04:11:13,100
You can make your own rice.

6901
04:11:13,100 --> 04:11:13,820
You can make pictures on our cereal.

6902
04:11:14,260 --> 04:11:15,980
There's chefs in the back.

6903
04:11:16,780 --> 04:11:18,660
You can take a photo of her.

6904
04:11:18,940 --> 04:11:21,980
You can make elf with her cute spells.

6905
04:11:22,440 --> 04:11:23,340
Get the elf out of here.

6906
04:11:23,360 --> 04:11:23,920
You can make an alphabet cereal.

6907
04:11:24,320 --> 04:11:27,900
And you can make words out of it.

6908
04:11:29,140 --> 04:11:29,740
Elphabets.

6909
04:11:29,780 --> 04:11:30,780
What are we, five?

6910
04:11:32,600 --> 04:11:34,380
Wait, I can't spell my name.

6911
04:11:35,920 --> 04:11:37,840
Spell her name on her cereal.

6912
04:11:38,340 --> 04:11:40,060
Okay, I can help you.

6913
04:11:40,140 --> 04:11:40,600
You know what?

6914
04:11:40,660 --> 04:11:41,620
That's my job.

6915
04:11:41,900 --> 04:11:42,660
That's my job.

6916
04:11:43,360 --> 04:11:45,240
You're a babysitter now.

6917
04:11:45,460 --> 04:11:46,340
Oh my god.

6918
04:11:48,440 --> 04:11:52,160
Well, you are in the finals now.

6919
04:11:52,260 --> 04:11:53,340
Did you expect yourself to win?

6920
04:11:55,060 --> 04:11:56,040
I'm gonna be honest.

6921
04:11:56,200 --> 04:12:02,280
No, but the moment I saw my character hit a triple, double, backflip, quintuple, ultra axe kick on like five different people.

6922
04:12:02,560 --> 04:12:04,640
I knew I had something magical.

6923
04:12:05,660 --> 04:12:08,860
I feel like Kirito and like I'm against Kayaba right now.

6924
04:12:09,920 --> 04:12:10,400
Wow.

6925
04:12:11,660 --> 04:12:15,360
Let's call in Beto to the finals.

6926
04:12:16,520 --> 04:12:17,480
Oh boy.

6927
04:12:17,780 --> 04:12:19,980
You know, you know, this match, this match.

6928
04:12:20,120 --> 04:12:21,180
It's not just the finals.

6929
04:12:21,240 --> 04:12:21,940
This is personal.

6930
04:12:22,060 --> 04:12:23,020
This is personal.

6931
04:12:23,140 --> 04:12:23,340
What's the final?

6932
04:12:23,360 --> 04:12:24,220
What does Fillion do to you?

6933
04:12:25,620 --> 04:12:27,500
You, Fillion, called me Charlie.

6934
04:12:28,300 --> 04:12:28,640
Oh.

6935
04:12:29,480 --> 04:12:31,850
Was that?

6936
04:12:31,970 --> 04:12:33,370
Yeah, I'm so mad about it.

6937
04:12:33,810 --> 04:12:35,890
Everyone just called me Charlie now.

6938
04:12:35,950 --> 04:12:36,790
You think I like that?

6939
04:12:36,950 --> 04:12:38,430
Okay, but you're more critical.

6940
04:12:38,610 --> 04:12:39,790
Now look into my eyes.

6941
04:12:40,130 --> 04:12:41,890
Doki Bird told me to say it.

6942
04:12:41,990 --> 04:12:45,130
Okay, but like as a caster, you should have researched your content.

6943
04:12:45,230 --> 04:12:46,810
You should have researched the content.

6944
04:12:46,990 --> 04:12:48,950
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gassing you up, okay?

6945
04:12:49,170 --> 04:12:51,470
I stand behind Doki Bird.

6946
04:12:51,650 --> 04:12:53,350
And I'm here on her legacy.

6947
04:12:53,850 --> 04:12:55,050
You all did this to me.

6948
04:12:55,110 --> 04:12:57,550
You took my fist and put it through your trolley face.

6949
04:12:57,790 --> 04:12:58,550
You understand me?

6950
04:12:58,630 --> 04:13:00,050
Oh my god.

6951
04:13:00,110 --> 04:13:01,590
She pulled out the Charlie.

6952
04:13:01,690 --> 04:13:03,610
She called you by your fake name.

6953
04:13:04,070 --> 04:13:07,330
Well, well, then I'll call you David.

6954
04:13:08,250 --> 04:13:08,970
David?

6955
04:13:09,950 --> 04:13:13,010
My name's not David.

6956
04:13:13,750 --> 04:13:14,130
My name's not David.

6957
04:13:14,130 --> 04:13:15,910
My name's not David.

6958
04:13:15,910 --> 04:13:16,770
We'll see who takes this.

6959
04:13:16,810 --> 04:13:22,430
David and Charlie, congratulations for making it to the finals, everybody.

6960
04:13:23,030 --> 04:13:24,190
David and Charlie, congratulations for making it to the finals, everybody.

6961
04:13:25,110 --> 04:13:29,170
You got so many people to get here as the final two.

6962
04:13:30,070 --> 04:13:35,290
Audience, who do you think is going to take the champion belt home?

6963
04:13:35,730 --> 04:13:39,450
Guys, seems like Bettle is currently winning the Polo Spillion.

6964
04:13:39,970 --> 04:13:40,530
What?

6965
04:13:40,690 --> 04:13:41,990
Oh no.

6966
04:13:42,510 --> 04:13:42,950
Wait, how?

6967
04:13:43,490 --> 04:13:45,550
Bettle's like a knock-off version of me though.

6968
04:13:45,590 --> 04:13:45,990
Is he not?

6969
04:13:46,410 --> 04:13:47,110
What the?

6970
04:13:47,950 --> 04:13:49,910
I don't care to explain.

6971
04:13:50,390 --> 04:13:52,370
Why do eight whips, he does three?

6972
04:13:52,370 --> 04:13:53,710
We are not the same.

6973
04:13:54,470 --> 04:13:56,770
Do you do the ball grabs though?

6974
04:13:58,190 --> 04:13:59,750
I fight with honor.

6975
04:13:59,950 --> 04:14:01,610
And I fight for my friends, okay?

6976
04:14:02,790 --> 04:14:05,610
And this man has no dignity.

6977
04:14:06,410 --> 04:14:07,410
What friends?

6978
04:14:07,710 --> 04:14:08,030
What friends?

6979
04:14:08,530 --> 04:14:08,990
Oh no.

6980
04:14:09,110 --> 04:14:10,810
Listen up, Charlie.

6981
04:14:13,210 --> 04:14:15,670
Your name is Beta.

6982
04:14:16,350 --> 04:14:18,830
Your drip is Beta.

6983
04:14:19,170 --> 04:14:21,570
And your favorite video game is...

6984
04:14:21,570 --> 04:14:22,350
...Bettle.

6985
04:14:22,370 --> 04:14:23,070
It's for Betas!

6986
04:14:25,010 --> 04:14:26,870
How did you know I liked League of Legends?

6987
04:14:27,210 --> 04:14:28,370
Oh no!

6988
04:14:29,710 --> 04:14:31,010
She's beyond saving.

6989
04:14:31,270 --> 04:14:33,010
Ladies and gentlemen, it speaks for itself.

6990
04:14:33,990 --> 04:14:37,310
Well, let's take this fight to the ring.

6991
04:14:37,450 --> 04:14:40,890
The final match in this tournament, guys.

6992
04:14:41,090 --> 04:14:44,630
Let's see who will take the champion belt.

6993
04:14:44,970 --> 04:14:46,350
And off we go.

6994
04:14:47,190 --> 04:14:47,830
Wow.

6995
04:14:48,630 --> 04:14:51,730
It's been a long, long time.

6996
04:14:51,730 --> 04:14:52,350
And I'm so excited.

6997
04:14:52,350 --> 04:14:53,150
Two days.

6998
04:14:53,430 --> 04:14:54,510
Oh, it has been.

6999
04:14:54,670 --> 04:15:00,170
We had so many fighters come in and out.

7000
04:15:00,270 --> 04:15:02,630
So many upsets today.

7001
04:15:03,250 --> 04:15:06,430
Some of us didn't even make it past the single round.

7002
04:15:06,570 --> 04:15:09,770
The finals are here.

7003
04:15:10,350 --> 04:15:14,750
Give it up for the Diaper Vanquisher!

7004
04:15:15,530 --> 04:15:17,850
Give it up for the Diaper Vanquisher!

7005
04:15:17,850 --> 04:15:18,110
Give it up for the Diaper Vanquisher!

7006
04:15:18,290 --> 04:15:19,010
Give it up for the Diaper Vanquisher!

7007
04:15:19,010 --> 04:15:19,950
There he is.

7008
04:15:19,990 --> 04:15:23,450
His last final entrance into the ring.

7009
04:15:23,450 --> 04:15:23,790
His last final entrance into the ring.

7010
04:15:23,810 --> 04:15:27,310
Will he vanquish another opponent today, Mint?

7011
04:15:28,690 --> 04:15:29,710
I... I'm...

7012
04:15:29,710 --> 04:15:30,450
I don't know.

7013
04:15:30,470 --> 04:15:31,550
I'm feeling pretty...

7014
04:15:31,550 --> 04:15:32,830
It's hard to say.

7015
04:15:32,890 --> 04:15:34,310
Each has their own strengths.

7016
04:15:34,410 --> 04:15:35,670
And so...

7017
04:15:35,670 --> 04:15:38,330
It could be anyone's game, honestly.

7018
04:15:38,610 --> 04:15:39,610
The thing is...

7019
04:15:39,610 --> 04:15:45,550
The thing I'm scared about, and I think that might hurt Betta, is that this time he was actually confident.

7020
04:15:46,410 --> 04:15:47,450
I think so too.

7021
04:15:47,590 --> 04:15:48,050
I think so too.

7022
04:15:48,170 --> 04:15:51,570
And here is your alleged alpha...

7023
04:15:52,550 --> 04:15:53,070
FAILURE!

7024
04:15:55,030 --> 04:15:57,390
There she goes, doing another dance.

7025
04:15:57,530 --> 04:15:59,770
Ready for more coins being thrown at her.

7026
04:16:00,030 --> 04:16:00,670
Yup.

7027
04:16:00,810 --> 04:16:02,610
She's gotta buy lunch, guys.

7028
04:16:05,950 --> 04:16:07,310
Throw coins at her!

7029
04:16:07,930 --> 04:16:09,630
She's got... she's starving!

7030
04:16:09,910 --> 04:16:10,350
Please!

7031
04:16:10,370 --> 04:16:12,430
If you're cold, she's cold!

7032
04:16:12,950 --> 04:16:13,590
Please!

7033
04:16:15,150 --> 04:16:17,990
She's wearing all these shorts and a shirt...

7034
04:16:18,530 --> 04:16:19,450
T-shirt, guys!

7035
04:16:21,570 --> 04:16:23,450
She can't afford anything.

7036
04:16:23,810 --> 04:16:24,630
Right now...

7037
04:16:24,630 --> 04:16:25,870
Look at her...

7038
04:16:26,830 --> 04:16:27,830
I think...

7039
04:16:27,830 --> 04:16:31,830
I think the greatest strength that both of these guys have...

7040
04:16:31,830 --> 04:16:34,150
And truly, honestly, the thing that...

7041
04:16:34,150 --> 04:16:38,890
That makes them different from the rest, is that they just don't have a single thought behind their eyes.

7042
04:16:39,110 --> 04:16:40,290
Oh, that is so true!

7043
04:16:40,590 --> 04:16:41,250
That is so true!

7044
04:16:41,690 --> 04:16:44,510
Just from the interview process, I could tell...

7045
04:16:44,510 --> 04:16:48,770
I could tell they must have repeated 5th grade like 3 times or so Yeah...

7046
04:16:48,770 --> 04:16:51,570
Before becoming a streamer.

7047
04:16:51,930 --> 04:16:52,710
Oh yeah.

7048
04:16:52,930 --> 04:16:58,670
100% There she goes breakdancing one last time.

7049
04:17:01,550 --> 04:17:04,190
I do hope Beto's confidence doesn't...

7050
04:17:04,190 --> 04:17:05,250
Oh, there's the belt!

7051
04:17:05,370 --> 04:17:08,730
The champion WrestleTuber belt!

7052
04:17:09,430 --> 04:17:10,570
Yeah, it's beautiful!

7053
04:17:11,030 --> 04:17:13,410
Wrestle for that belt, guys!

7054
04:17:19,490 --> 04:17:21,850
My hero academia.

7055
04:17:25,250 --> 04:17:30,030
I hope Beto's confidence doesn't, you know, hurt him in the end.

7056
04:17:30,150 --> 04:17:34,150
That's like... because like every match he got through, he was not confident at all.

7057
04:17:34,170 --> 04:17:34,730
Yeah, exactly.

7058
04:17:35,030 --> 04:17:37,510
It was like that... being pushed into...

7059
04:17:37,510 --> 04:17:40,910
Oh, that is... one, two...

7060
04:17:40,910 --> 04:17:46,290
Okay, it's a match ended there.

7061
04:17:46,290 --> 04:17:47,430
Oh, Finn!

7062
04:17:47,530 --> 04:17:48,650
What's going on?

7063
04:17:49,090 --> 04:17:49,730
Beto!

7064
04:17:49,890 --> 04:17:50,350
What?

7065
04:17:50,470 --> 04:17:53,490
Oh my god, he's getting spanked like a bad child!

7066
04:17:53,490 --> 04:17:53,790
Bad child!

7067
04:17:53,810 --> 04:17:54,470
Bad baby!

7068
04:17:54,650 --> 04:17:55,830
Bad baby!

7069
04:17:55,950 --> 04:17:56,850
Bad baby!

7070
04:17:57,090 --> 04:17:57,990
Bad baby!

7071
04:17:58,730 --> 04:18:02,870
Oh my god, that double jump on the ring!

7072
04:18:03,990 --> 04:18:06,290
Oh, on the rope too!

7073
04:18:06,510 --> 04:18:08,950
I feel like they share one brain cell together.

7074
04:18:09,210 --> 04:18:09,850
I think so too.

7075
04:18:10,150 --> 04:18:10,530
Yeah, I think he...

7076
04:18:10,530 --> 04:18:11,350
Look, they're dancing together.

7077
04:18:11,630 --> 04:18:12,190
Oh my god.

7078
04:18:13,370 --> 04:18:15,350
He should... Holy shit!

7079
04:18:15,710 --> 04:18:18,490
Beto, where was those moves in the last day?

7080
04:18:18,910 --> 04:18:19,390
Whoa!

7081
04:18:20,190 --> 04:18:23,390
Oh my god, he's confident right now!

7082
04:18:24,230 --> 04:18:25,190
Confident Beto!

7083
04:18:25,470 --> 04:18:26,730
That could bite him in the butt though.

7084
04:18:27,070 --> 04:18:29,270
Not gonna lie, confident Beto is scary.

7085
04:18:29,930 --> 04:18:31,550
I'm seeing moves...

7086
04:18:31,550 --> 04:18:31,970
What is going on?

7087
04:18:31,970 --> 04:18:34,950
Okay, I... Oh my god, so he's the ring around the Rosie.

7088
04:18:35,050 --> 04:18:35,510
What do you mean?

7089
04:18:35,810 --> 04:18:35,830
Yeah.

7090
04:18:36,110 --> 04:18:36,950
Another pin?

7091
04:18:37,230 --> 04:18:37,490
What?

7092
04:18:37,650 --> 04:18:38,670
He's tired already.

7093
04:18:38,950 --> 04:18:39,110
Oh, I do!

7094
04:18:39,310 --> 04:18:39,990
Come on, Tails!

7095
04:18:40,070 --> 04:18:40,690
Get up, Tails!

7096
04:18:42,010 --> 04:18:47,330
Okay, but did you see how Beto was heavily breathing there from just like one minute of fighting?

7097
04:18:47,690 --> 04:18:48,430
It's true, it's true.

7098
04:18:48,490 --> 04:18:49,410
Oh my... she's flipping...

7099
04:18:49,410 --> 04:18:50,110
She's flipping...

7100
04:18:50,110 --> 04:18:51,290
She's just showing off in there.

7101
04:18:51,290 --> 04:18:56,230
The chat donated 500 bits for a flip, so she's got a...

7102
04:18:56,230 --> 04:18:58,010
Do a flip, VTuber!

7103
04:18:58,050 --> 04:18:58,630
Do a flip!

7104
04:18:59,050 --> 04:19:01,010
Oh my god, the sound alert is going off.

7105
04:19:01,070 --> 04:19:01,670
Do a flip!

7106
04:19:02,030 --> 04:19:05,530
And 500 bitties, thank you for the 500 bitties on Twitch for a billion.

7107
04:19:09,830 --> 04:19:12,510
Oh man, Beto's back in the ring though.

7108
04:19:12,790 --> 04:19:14,170
Oh, another pin!

7109
04:19:14,390 --> 04:19:15,110
Another pin!

7110
04:19:15,310 --> 04:19:16,070
Oh, this is it.

7111
04:19:16,110 --> 04:19:16,690
Look at his face.

7112
04:19:17,790 --> 04:19:18,890
He's not ready.

7113
04:19:19,010 --> 04:19:21,130
He is ready to keep on wrestling.

7114
04:19:21,130 --> 04:19:21,630
Yeah.

7115
04:19:22,490 --> 04:19:24,010
But he's a little tired.

7116
04:19:24,090 --> 04:19:24,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

7117
04:19:24,630 --> 04:19:26,150
And Fillion missed again.

7118
04:19:26,430 --> 04:19:27,010
Missed again.

7119
04:19:28,550 --> 04:19:30,050
Okay, Beto back to the ring.

7120
04:19:30,130 --> 04:19:33,090
Back to the ring and then a fucking grapple with his legs!

7121
04:19:33,310 --> 04:19:33,830
Oh!

7122
04:19:33,830 --> 04:19:34,610
Another pin.

7123
04:19:34,770 --> 04:19:35,870
Do the countdown, Min.

7124
04:19:35,870 --> 04:19:36,510
Come on, Fillion gets trolled!

7125
04:19:36,810 --> 04:19:37,330
One!

7126
04:19:37,430 --> 04:19:39,050
Oh, it's just one.

7127
04:19:39,230 --> 04:19:39,950
Just one.

7128
04:19:40,250 --> 04:19:40,850
Just one.

7129
04:19:41,330 --> 04:19:42,230
This is intense.

7130
04:19:43,050 --> 04:19:45,190
Honestly, it could be anybody's game.

7131
04:19:45,370 --> 04:19:46,970
Seriously, it could be anyone's game.

7132
04:19:47,130 --> 04:19:47,390
Yeah.

7133
04:19:48,450 --> 04:19:50,770
Like, they all seem like...

7134
04:19:50,770 --> 04:19:52,350
seem like they could take it home.

7135
04:19:52,510 --> 04:19:52,630
Oh!

7136
04:19:52,770 --> 04:19:53,790
The taunt!

7137
04:19:54,290 --> 04:19:54,810
Whoa!

7138
04:19:55,450 --> 04:19:59,290
Oh, I feel like Fillion just has more speed stats than him.

7139
04:20:00,250 --> 04:20:01,370
I think so too.

7140
04:20:01,530 --> 04:20:02,770
Beto might be really lucky.

7141
04:20:02,950 --> 04:20:05,910
But like, is luck gonna save him if she's just so fast?

7142
04:20:06,250 --> 04:20:08,890
And she just flips for fun.

7143
04:20:08,970 --> 04:20:09,210
Yeah.

7144
04:20:09,230 --> 04:20:10,630
And everyone keeps redeeming Flip.

7145
04:20:11,250 --> 04:20:14,270
Guys, stop donating 500 biddies!

7146
04:20:14,330 --> 04:20:15,150
She has to wrestle!

7147
04:20:15,630 --> 04:20:16,150
Oh!

7148
04:20:16,950 --> 04:20:17,470
Oh!

7149
04:20:18,110 --> 04:20:18,150
Oh!

7150
04:20:19,950 --> 04:20:20,650
Stop, guys!

7151
04:20:22,950 --> 04:20:23,770
Come on.

7152
04:20:23,790 --> 04:20:24,930
Oh, come on, Beto!

7153
04:20:25,050 --> 04:20:25,590
Get up!

7154
04:20:25,890 --> 04:20:26,790
He's gonna have a comeback.

7155
04:20:26,990 --> 04:20:27,790
He's gonna have a comeback.

7156
04:20:29,090 --> 04:20:30,170
She's gonna come back.

7157
04:20:30,250 --> 04:20:32,270
He's gonna come back when we least expect it.

7158
04:20:32,330 --> 04:20:34,230
That has been the majority of his matches.

7159
04:20:34,510 --> 04:20:35,770
Fillion does another Flip.

7160
04:20:35,970 --> 04:20:36,170
Oh!

7161
04:20:36,310 --> 04:20:38,570
But Beto blocks it with his Knives!

7162
04:20:39,930 --> 04:20:41,310
He denied it!

7163
04:20:41,410 --> 04:20:43,390
Oh, but the Crouch Kick...

7164
04:20:43,390 --> 04:20:44,070
The Cranium Check.

7165
04:20:44,850 --> 04:20:48,130
Okay, but like, remember when Fillion said that she would never win?

7166
04:20:48,130 --> 04:20:50,090
Never stoop that low to target the balls?

7167
04:20:50,290 --> 04:20:52,410
We just saw her hit a nut shot!

7168
04:20:53,270 --> 04:20:55,030
Is there no integrity anymore?

7169
04:20:55,210 --> 04:20:56,690
And another rope break!

7170
04:20:56,730 --> 04:20:58,110
Are you serious?

7171
04:20:58,310 --> 04:20:59,170
A rope break?

7172
04:20:59,190 --> 04:21:02,970
The very first rope break of the whole tournament!

7173
04:21:03,310 --> 04:21:04,110
Yeah, I think so!

7174
04:21:04,510 --> 04:21:05,170
Wait, another?

7175
04:21:06,250 --> 04:21:06,850
One!

7176
04:21:06,850 --> 04:21:07,450
Two!

7177
04:21:08,170 --> 04:21:10,310
Oh, that was so close!

7178
04:21:10,450 --> 04:21:11,390
That was so close!

7179
04:21:11,630 --> 04:21:13,030
We thought it was over!

7180
04:21:13,490 --> 04:21:14,710
I thought so.

7181
04:21:15,130 --> 04:21:16,870
I was ready to call it!

7182
04:21:18,830 --> 04:21:20,470
Oh, and another Flip.

7183
04:21:20,830 --> 04:21:21,970
Not so fast, not so fast though.

7184
04:21:22,710 --> 04:21:24,630
These are two wild cards.

7185
04:21:24,970 --> 04:21:25,730
They're so wild.

7186
04:21:25,930 --> 04:21:29,290
Honestly, I felt like the ref might have been paid off.

7187
04:21:29,390 --> 04:21:30,450
That should have been three!

7188
04:21:30,750 --> 04:21:33,970
I counted in my head and it was three.

7189
04:21:34,290 --> 04:21:35,610
Hey, what are you saying, Dokia?

7190
04:21:35,690 --> 04:21:36,790
Are you saying this is not fair?

7191
04:21:37,490 --> 04:21:39,570
Well, I'm not saying it.

7192
04:21:39,610 --> 04:21:40,910
I'm implying it.

7193
04:21:41,830 --> 04:21:43,370
Isn't this your tournament?

7194
04:21:44,470 --> 04:21:44,950
No!

7195
04:21:45,870 --> 04:21:49,530
Didn't you and Matara kill off the majority of my staff?

7196
04:21:50,390 --> 04:21:51,890
Oh, just the guards!

7197
04:21:51,950 --> 04:21:53,350
We're not touching the referee!

7198
04:21:53,550 --> 04:21:54,490
We don't care about them!

7199
04:21:56,510 --> 04:21:58,830
Well, considering I lost, maybe we should have.

7200
04:21:59,210 --> 04:22:05,710
I mean, the refs are now scared for their safety after what you've done, so maybe they got paid off for more protection!

7201
04:22:06,910 --> 04:22:08,110
We're already at seven.

7202
04:22:08,330 --> 04:22:08,930
Oh my god.

7203
04:22:09,030 --> 04:22:10,190
Wait, where's eight?

7204
04:22:11,250 --> 04:22:12,310
There's no more countdown?

7205
04:22:12,970 --> 04:22:14,210
We were at six!

7206
04:22:14,210 --> 04:22:14,770
Oh, seven!

7207
04:22:14,870 --> 04:22:15,190
Seven!

7208
04:22:15,310 --> 04:22:15,950
There it is!

7209
04:22:16,030 --> 04:22:16,490
There it is!

7210
04:22:16,570 --> 04:22:16,890
There it is!

7211
04:22:16,910 --> 04:22:17,750
No, don't bring her back!

7212
04:22:17,870 --> 04:22:19,250
What are you doing, Petal?!

7213
04:22:20,250 --> 04:22:21,230
What are you doing?!

7214
04:22:21,230 --> 04:22:22,950
You could de-cute her off of the ring!

7215
04:22:23,350 --> 04:22:23,710
Oh!

7216
04:22:25,270 --> 04:22:25,630
Oh?

7217
04:22:25,630 --> 04:22:26,350
Did he slip?

7218
04:22:26,510 --> 04:22:27,790
What's going on?

7219
04:22:27,830 --> 04:22:28,390
Banana peel there?

7220
04:22:28,530 --> 04:22:29,210
Yeah, the loony...

7221
04:22:29,210 --> 04:22:30,870
We call that the loony tunes, everybody!

7222
04:22:32,150 --> 04:22:33,130
Oh, oh my god!

7223
04:22:33,170 --> 04:22:33,390
The...

7224
04:22:33,390 --> 04:22:33,790
Oh!

7225
04:22:33,790 --> 04:22:33,950
Oh!

7226
04:22:34,070 --> 04:22:35,090
And Petal denied!

7227
04:22:36,050 --> 04:22:36,410
Intercepted!

7228
04:22:36,410 --> 04:22:36,770
Intercepted!

7229
04:22:36,770 --> 04:22:37,970
He intercepted!

7230
04:22:37,990 --> 04:22:38,150
Oh!

7231
04:22:38,410 --> 04:22:39,570
But it doesn't matter!

7232
04:22:40,150 --> 04:22:41,590
It doesn't matter!

7233
04:22:41,670 --> 04:22:42,330
Is she gonna pin him?

7234
04:22:42,370 --> 04:22:42,810
Is she gonna pin him?

7235
04:22:42,870 --> 04:22:43,110
Oh!

7236
04:22:43,110 --> 04:22:43,470
Oh!

7237
04:22:43,470 --> 04:22:43,550
Oh!

7238
04:22:43,730 --> 04:22:44,630
There's the countdown!

7239
04:22:44,890 --> 04:22:45,630
Where's the count?

7240
04:22:45,790 --> 04:22:46,230
The rep!

7241
04:22:46,410 --> 04:22:46,790
The rep!

7242
04:22:46,790 --> 04:22:47,710
What's going on, rep?!

7243
04:22:54,010 --> 04:22:54,530
What?!

7244
04:22:54,530 --> 04:22:56,630
Then we just see!

7245
04:22:56,710 --> 04:22:57,310
Oh, what?!

7246
04:22:57,310 --> 04:22:57,870
One!

7247
04:22:57,870 --> 04:22:58,210
Two!

7248
04:22:58,330 --> 04:22:58,850
Two!

7249
04:22:58,990 --> 04:23:01,410
Oh, and that hit denial!

7250
04:23:02,630 --> 04:23:03,150
I...

7251
04:23:03,150 --> 04:23:07,510
Guys, I think... I think... I think the rep...

7252
04:23:07,510 --> 04:23:08,210
I think this is a rigged match!

7253
04:23:08,390 --> 04:23:09,390
I think this is a rigged match!

7254
04:23:09,530 --> 04:23:10,050
Oh!

7255
04:23:10,350 --> 04:23:10,750
Here we go!

7256
04:23:10,830 --> 04:23:11,190
One!

7257
04:23:11,250 --> 04:23:11,510
Two!

7258
04:23:13,350 --> 04:23:14,330
Petal's here for another.

7259
04:23:14,570 --> 04:23:15,650
Petal's here for another.

7260
04:23:16,510 --> 04:23:17,030
What?

7261
04:23:17,030 --> 04:23:17,110
What?

7262
04:23:17,150 --> 04:23:18,270
Feline gets trolled.

7263
04:23:18,910 --> 04:23:19,670
Where'd the lights go, guys?

7264
04:23:20,030 --> 04:23:20,290
Oh!

7265
04:23:20,450 --> 04:23:21,250
Where'd the lights go?

7266
04:23:21,370 --> 04:23:22,370
This is so rigged!

7267
04:23:22,370 --> 04:23:23,190
Oh my god!

7268
04:23:23,190 --> 04:23:24,790
She copied the move!

7269
04:23:25,590 --> 04:23:26,930
It doesn't matter!

7270
04:23:27,290 --> 04:23:28,490
It doesn't matter!

7271
04:23:28,650 --> 04:23:28,910
Bella tried to do another...

7272
04:23:28,910 --> 04:23:30,470
She knew what to do!

7273
04:23:30,670 --> 04:23:32,570
She knew what to do after me!

7274
04:23:32,730 --> 04:23:37,590
She knew... Yeah, she downloaded your moveset and knew how to counter it!

7275
04:23:38,450 --> 04:23:40,630
What if there was a second teleport?

7276
04:23:40,930 --> 04:23:41,410
Oh!

7277
04:23:42,990 --> 04:23:44,510
That is crazy!

7278
04:23:44,510 --> 04:23:46,850
Oh my god!

7279
04:23:47,630 --> 04:23:51,350
Petal is maxing that luck right now!

7280
04:23:51,850 --> 04:23:53,650
That did not look good for Feline.

7281
04:23:53,990 --> 04:23:56,770
That looks like it's definitely her.

7282
04:23:56,930 --> 04:23:57,930
Oh, her legs.

7283
04:23:57,970 --> 04:24:00,130
She ain't flipping anytime soon anymore.

7284
04:24:00,370 --> 04:24:01,190
I don't think so.

7285
04:24:01,570 --> 04:24:01,850
No!

7286
04:24:02,170 --> 04:24:06,070
He's getting rid of all her appendages so she'll never flip again.

7287
04:24:06,090 --> 04:24:07,390
It's because she doesn't get enough calcium!

7288
04:24:07,870 --> 04:24:09,310
Her bones are brittle.

7289
04:24:09,710 --> 04:24:11,270
Someone throw her an orange.

7290
04:24:11,670 --> 04:24:12,450
Oh, no!

7291
04:24:14,550 --> 04:24:19,710
If you're gonna be throwing things in the ring, she needs that orange right now.

7292
04:24:19,730 --> 04:24:21,170
She's like Popeye.

7293
04:24:21,270 --> 04:24:25,790
She grabs a can of spinach and like eats it and becomes strong.

7294
04:24:26,330 --> 04:24:27,550
Oh my god!

7295
04:24:27,670 --> 04:24:30,690
Petal reset the count so it's back to four.

7296
04:24:30,850 --> 04:24:32,790
Petal, stop putting her back in the ring!

7297
04:24:35,350 --> 04:24:35,910
Oh!

7298
04:24:36,310 --> 04:24:38,690
And the knockout of the ring!

7299
04:24:38,770 --> 04:24:40,810
You're not allowed in this ring anymore.

7300
04:24:41,230 --> 04:24:42,310
Petal, you have to come back in the ring.

7301
04:24:42,310 --> 04:24:42,490
Oh, I can't.

7302
04:24:42,770 --> 04:24:45,970
Oh, Billion jumped out as well!

7303
04:24:46,530 --> 04:24:49,170
I think she reset the count by jumping out.

7304
04:24:49,570 --> 04:24:49,610
I think so too.

7305
04:24:50,270 --> 04:24:52,370
We'll find out soon if it goes back to one.

7306
04:24:52,450 --> 04:24:53,350
I don't see an eight.

7307
04:24:54,770 --> 04:24:56,130
Yeah, she reset it.

7308
04:24:56,130 --> 04:24:57,230
Time to count, everybody.

7309
04:24:57,690 --> 04:24:58,750
He's going back in.

7310
04:24:58,930 --> 04:24:59,670
You know what comes after two?

7311
04:24:59,910 --> 04:25:00,630
I mean, one.

7312
04:25:05,090 --> 04:25:07,210
I think we need a teacher here.

7313
04:25:09,290 --> 04:25:10,110
Oh my god.

7314
04:25:10,110 --> 04:25:14,750
Oh, Billion was trying to fucking flip on her but he ended up flipping on her!

7315
04:25:15,790 --> 04:25:17,390
And another flip!

7316
04:25:18,910 --> 04:25:19,490
This is it.

7317
04:25:19,590 --> 04:25:21,430
Oh, Petal's doing a little dance.

7318
04:25:21,610 --> 04:25:22,770
Like, cheer me on.

7319
04:25:22,890 --> 04:25:23,550
The taunt.

7320
04:25:23,550 --> 04:25:24,110
The taunt.

7321
04:25:24,350 --> 04:25:24,470
Oh!

7322
04:25:25,470 --> 04:25:26,310
Billion's not happy.

7323
04:25:26,370 --> 04:25:26,770
Oh, wait!

7324
04:25:27,110 --> 04:25:27,630
One!

7325
04:25:28,330 --> 04:25:28,850
Two!

7326
04:25:29,490 --> 04:25:30,730
Oh, so close!

7327
04:25:31,090 --> 04:25:31,910
So close.

7328
04:25:32,330 --> 04:25:33,990
Come on, the crowd's getting restless.

7329
04:25:34,250 --> 04:25:35,210
Come on, Billion!

7330
04:25:35,290 --> 04:25:38,410
The crowd needs to know if you're gonna lose or win!

7331
04:25:39,290 --> 04:25:40,730
Oh, another jump.

7332
04:25:40,890 --> 04:25:41,650
Oh, it's gonna hit.

7333
04:25:41,690 --> 04:25:42,390
We got a cutscene.

7334
04:25:42,490 --> 04:25:42,910
It's gonna hit!

7335
04:25:43,230 --> 04:25:45,370
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

7336
04:25:45,770 --> 04:25:46,670
That's gotta hurt.

7337
04:25:46,670 --> 04:25:47,490
That's gotta hurt.

7338
04:25:47,790 --> 04:25:49,790
But he's not gonna pin though, Mint.

7339
04:25:50,850 --> 04:25:53,210
Yeah, he's not done playing around with her.

7340
04:25:53,710 --> 04:25:54,250
Oh!

7341
04:25:55,830 --> 04:25:56,990
And another one.

7342
04:25:57,210 --> 04:25:58,030
Oh, here we go, here we go!

7343
04:25:58,530 --> 04:25:59,070
One!

7344
04:25:59,470 --> 04:26:00,010
Two!

7345
04:26:00,710 --> 04:26:01,250
Three!

7346
04:26:01,450 --> 04:26:01,990
Three!

7347
04:26:05,960 --> 04:26:06,500
Three!

7348
04:26:07,800 --> 04:26:11,420
Your winner for WrestleTuber 2020!

7349
04:26:11,520 --> 04:26:12,060
Your winner for WrestleTuber 2020!

7350
04:26:12,060 --> 04:26:12,540
Four!

7351
04:26:14,140 --> 04:26:16,080
The Charlie Denier!

7352
04:26:16,360 --> 04:26:18,740
The Diaper Destroyer!

7353
04:26:19,280 --> 04:26:22,200
The Baby Girl himself!

7354
04:26:23,440 --> 04:26:24,280
Maddo!

7355
04:26:35,010 --> 04:26:35,850
Insane.

7356
04:26:35,850 --> 04:26:42,870
That was actually... that was the most insane match I've seen today, Mint.

7357
04:26:43,010 --> 04:26:43,510
Absolutely.

7358
04:26:43,850 --> 04:26:45,130
It was worthy of the finale.

7359
04:26:45,490 --> 04:26:49,750
The fact that the ref just disappeared for five seconds.

7360
04:26:51,870 --> 04:26:53,110
What's this win deserved?

7361
04:26:53,370 --> 04:26:55,910
I don't know, let's talk to Beto.

7362
04:26:55,950 --> 04:26:57,930
Let's ask Beto what the fuck was that?

7363
04:26:58,430 --> 04:26:59,670
Yeah, Beto.

7364
04:27:02,290 --> 04:27:05,210
Before anyone makes any accusations, I did not pay the ref.

7365
04:27:05,310 --> 04:27:05,610
Okay?

7366
04:27:05,650 --> 04:27:06,430
I don't know what that was.

7367
04:27:06,810 --> 04:27:07,570
That wasn't me.

7368
04:27:08,290 --> 04:27:11,830
Just totally a fair and normal game.

7369
04:27:12,390 --> 04:27:12,810
Sure.

7370
04:27:13,130 --> 04:27:13,650
Yeah.

7371
04:27:14,030 --> 04:27:14,790
Uh-huh.

7372
04:27:14,910 --> 04:27:16,450
So where did that ref go?

7373
04:27:16,910 --> 04:27:19,090
That was a really fair game.

7374
04:27:20,790 --> 04:27:22,830
They were tying their shoe, you know?

7375
04:27:23,010 --> 04:27:24,070
They were tying?

7376
04:27:24,070 --> 04:27:24,590
Who knows?

7377
04:27:24,750 --> 04:27:24,790
Who knows?

7378
04:27:26,290 --> 04:27:28,810
Counting the money that was slipped into their pocket.

7379
04:27:29,210 --> 04:27:29,530
Yeah.

7380
04:27:29,650 --> 04:27:34,110
I'm gonna show the fans what your championship thing looks like real quick.

7381
04:27:34,370 --> 04:27:36,050
So there he is!

7382
04:27:36,150 --> 04:27:38,310
The winner of WrestleTuber Championship.

7383
04:27:39,230 --> 04:27:41,170
Some would say it might not be deserved.

7384
04:27:41,430 --> 04:27:43,470
Others would say he was just lucky.

7385
04:27:43,690 --> 04:27:48,010
And the ref, you know, he had something in his eye, you know, during one of those crucial moments.

7386
04:27:48,490 --> 04:27:49,510
We'll never know.

7387
04:27:49,590 --> 04:27:50,430
We'll never know.

7388
04:27:51,590 --> 04:27:52,990
Hey, Fillion, how do you feel?

7389
04:27:54,050 --> 04:27:56,710
Alright, well, I'm not gonna say it was rigged.

7390
04:27:57,850 --> 04:27:58,690
Okay, we're gonna say it.

7391
04:27:58,690 --> 04:27:59,490
But it was rigged.

7392
04:28:00,410 --> 04:28:00,810
Yeah.

7393
04:28:02,930 --> 04:28:03,330
Yeah.

7394
04:28:04,590 --> 04:28:07,870
Now, I will say it was a really fantastic tournament, you know?

7395
04:28:07,890 --> 04:28:09,250
I had a really great time here.

7396
04:28:09,350 --> 04:28:10,670
I didn't think it would make it this far.

7397
04:28:10,950 --> 04:28:12,030
But I'm gonna say this.

7398
04:28:12,450 --> 04:28:17,990
The worst thing position ever is to go through an entire tournament just to lose the very ninth place.

7399
04:28:17,990 --> 04:28:20,470
I will never forget this day.

7400
04:28:20,650 --> 04:28:23,310
This thing will burn until WrestleTuber 2025.

7401
04:28:23,950 --> 04:28:26,050
And I will come back stronger than ever.

7402
04:28:26,330 --> 04:28:28,010
And I'll be on gear.

7403
04:28:29,170 --> 04:28:29,810
Oh, yeah.

7404
04:28:29,910 --> 04:28:31,170
We're looking forward to it.

7405
04:28:31,350 --> 04:28:33,750
Yeah, I'm gonna do my best Lance Armstrong impression.

7406
04:28:33,990 --> 04:28:35,090
And you guys can get swept.

7407
04:28:36,010 --> 04:28:36,530
Damn.

7408
04:28:37,270 --> 04:28:40,570
Well, that is some fighting words.

7409
04:28:40,690 --> 04:28:44,950
I guess we'll see if Fillion will get a rematch in 2025.

7410
04:28:46,050 --> 04:28:47,150
And next year.

7411
04:28:47,990 --> 04:28:52,990
Well, Fillion, we have to lead you out of the interview stage because we got to interview the winner now.

7412
04:28:53,230 --> 04:28:54,170
So, sorry.

7413
04:28:54,250 --> 04:28:56,010
As the loser, you might have to leave.

7414
04:28:56,130 --> 04:28:56,410
It's alright.

7415
04:28:57,690 --> 04:28:59,210
You did amazing, though.

7416
04:28:59,230 --> 04:29:00,010
I'm so proud of you.

7417
04:29:00,370 --> 04:29:00,810
You did great, though.

7418
04:29:01,050 --> 04:29:02,850
You made it this far.

7419
04:29:03,410 --> 04:29:05,090
And you made a lot of friends, right?

7420
04:29:05,490 --> 04:29:06,610
You made a lot of friends?

7421
04:29:06,830 --> 04:29:07,430
Yeah, you made friends.

7422
04:29:07,910 --> 04:29:08,310
Yeah.

7423
04:29:08,450 --> 04:29:08,850
Yeah.

7424
04:29:11,830 --> 04:29:12,230
Yippee.

7425
04:29:12,710 --> 04:29:13,330
Don't do it.

7426
04:29:13,670 --> 04:29:14,830
I'll take my leave.

7427
04:29:15,310 --> 04:29:17,210
And I'll take my crew with me after.

7428
04:29:17,210 --> 04:29:17,870
Alright.

7429
04:29:18,230 --> 04:29:18,830
Well fought.

7430
04:29:18,910 --> 04:29:19,770
Good luck.

7431
04:29:20,010 --> 04:29:20,910
I'll see you there.

7432
04:29:21,130 --> 04:29:21,750
Good luck.

7433
04:29:22,490 --> 04:29:27,170
Well, Betel, you had you were the least confident out of all of our contestants.

7434
04:29:27,390 --> 04:29:28,630
And oh, God.

7435
04:29:33,450 --> 04:29:34,690
I fucking won.

7436
04:29:34,830 --> 04:29:35,890
I told you.

7437
04:29:35,950 --> 04:29:36,930
I told everybody.

7438
04:29:37,170 --> 04:29:38,170
I said it.

7439
04:29:38,230 --> 04:29:39,070
I would win.

7440
04:29:39,150 --> 04:29:39,910
And look at me now.

7441
04:29:40,190 --> 04:29:41,070
Look at me, Mom.

7442
04:29:41,390 --> 04:29:42,470
I did it.

7443
04:29:42,890 --> 04:29:44,010
I did it.

7444
04:29:45,190 --> 04:29:46,010
Is he okay?

7445
04:29:46,250 --> 04:29:47,110
I don't think so.

7446
04:29:47,110 --> 04:29:50,070
Did he get bit by Mary earlier?

7447
04:29:50,290 --> 04:29:52,290
I don't think he's okay guys.

7448
04:29:52,770 --> 04:29:54,150
Is he crying?

7449
04:29:54,610 --> 04:29:55,530
I think he's crying.

7450
04:29:56,530 --> 04:29:58,670
Steph, we might need some tissues real quick.

7451
04:29:58,890 --> 04:29:59,770
It's just a game.

7452
04:30:00,990 --> 04:30:01,890
You did great.

7453
04:30:02,030 --> 04:30:07,530
How do you feel being such a winner and holding that championship belt?

7454
04:30:08,290 --> 04:30:09,710
You know, it feels good.

7455
04:30:10,130 --> 04:30:12,430
I had some brothers in this and this.

7456
04:30:12,510 --> 04:30:13,870
I had to kill my brother to get here.

7457
04:30:14,510 --> 04:30:15,390
Oh, you do?

7458
04:30:16,370 --> 04:30:18,790
You know, I fought my brother in the ring.

7459
04:30:18,790 --> 04:30:18,810
He fought his brother.

7460
04:30:19,030 --> 04:30:19,550
He fought his twin.

7461
04:30:19,790 --> 04:30:20,810
He fought battle too.

7462
04:30:21,350 --> 04:30:24,190
I had to absorb his nutrients to become more powerful.

7463
04:30:24,530 --> 04:30:27,210
Wait, that means you were fighting as two!

7464
04:30:27,910 --> 04:30:30,650
You had literally two battles in you!

7465
04:30:31,290 --> 04:30:32,230
I had two.

7466
04:30:32,370 --> 04:30:34,970
We fused to become the perfect life form.

7467
04:30:35,030 --> 04:30:37,490
So it was a 2v1 this entire time.

7468
04:30:37,770 --> 04:30:38,730
Liquid battle.

7469
04:30:39,570 --> 04:30:40,730
Liquid battle, yeah!

7470
04:30:41,230 --> 04:30:42,010
Liquid battle.

7471
04:30:43,050 --> 04:30:43,990
I'm liquid battle?

7472
04:30:45,390 --> 04:30:45,770
Liquid battle.

7473
04:30:47,510 --> 04:30:48,690
Liquid dies!

7474
04:30:48,930 --> 04:30:49,530
No way!

7475
04:30:49,910 --> 04:30:51,030
I'm not liquid battle.

7476
04:30:51,270 --> 04:30:51,930
I'm not liquid battle.

7477
04:30:54,970 --> 04:30:56,770
I can't believe it.

7478
04:30:57,030 --> 04:31:02,630
Battle here will be holding on to that champion belt.

7479
04:31:03,110 --> 04:31:09,070
To represent the winner of the very first WrestleTuber 2024.

7480
04:31:10,410 --> 04:31:13,050
No one will stop him.

7481
04:31:13,830 --> 04:31:14,590
Unless...

7482
04:31:16,370 --> 04:31:17,070
Oi,

7483
04:31:34,150 --> 04:31:34,150
dude.

7484
04:31:34,510 --> 04:31:35,890
This is not gonna work at all.

7485
04:31:43,250 --> 04:31:43,790
This is really 있는데요.

7486
04:31:43,790 --> 04:31:43,970
No one has enough energy.

7487
04:31:46,290 --> 04:31:46,990
Please

7488
04:32:00,740 --> 04:32:03,000
don't pick that up at home, he will be satisfied.

7489
04:32:05,540 --> 04:32:12,240
Ah, oh man, that fatto.

7490
04:32:12,240 --> 04:32:17,540
Me too.

7491
04:32:17,600 --> 04:32:19,320
Did I Francisco?

7492
04:32:19,320 --> 04:32:23,220
Your security guard turned out to be a bug in disguise inside my phone.

7493
04:32:23,320 --> 04:32:25,480
Because you killed my original security guard!

7494
04:32:26,140 --> 04:32:29,100
We now have a new contender?

7495
04:32:30,040 --> 04:32:31,440
Who are you, sir?

7496
04:32:33,160 --> 04:32:34,420
Who are you?

7497
04:32:34,420 --> 04:32:34,620
I'm the hero.

7498
04:32:39,380 --> 04:32:41,120
Sir, are you okay?

7499
04:32:43,020 --> 04:32:43,820
What is this?

7500
04:32:44,060 --> 04:32:44,900
Are you okay?

7501
04:32:46,680 --> 04:32:47,240
Sir?

7502
04:32:47,700 --> 04:32:48,960
The vocal fry!

7503
04:32:49,360 --> 04:32:50,360
Oh my god!

7504
04:32:53,060 --> 04:32:55,080
Oh my god, I'm scared, Fettle.

7505
04:32:55,120 --> 04:32:55,620
Are you scared?

7506
04:32:55,700 --> 04:32:56,000
I'm scared.

7507
04:32:56,000 --> 04:32:57,140
I don't have to fight them, do I?

7508
04:32:57,240 --> 04:32:59,400
Oh, you're fighting this 3D man right now.

7509
04:32:59,860 --> 04:33:00,140
What?

7510
04:33:01,720 --> 04:33:03,340
Come with me, man.

7511
04:33:03,460 --> 04:33:04,480
Come with me, Pedro.

7512
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:10,460
It's not over, Fettle.

7513
04:33:10,700 --> 04:33:13,240
You gotta defend your title.

7514
04:33:14,900 --> 04:33:15,240
Already?

7515
04:33:16,020 --> 04:33:16,980
Where's my belt?

7516
04:33:17,240 --> 04:33:18,160
Where's my belt?

7517
04:33:18,540 --> 04:33:18,940
Oh no!

7518
04:33:19,420 --> 04:33:20,760
It's over there, sir!

7519
04:33:20,980 --> 04:33:22,120
It's over there!

7520
04:33:22,220 --> 04:33:22,580
No, no, no.

7521
04:33:22,580 --> 04:33:23,420
Please don't hurt us.

7522
04:33:24,140 --> 04:33:25,380
Alright, battle's over.

7523
04:33:25,780 --> 04:33:26,640
Good luck, Fettle!

7524
04:33:26,780 --> 04:33:28,060
Off to the ring we go!

7525
04:33:28,280 --> 04:33:29,380
Good luck, everybody!

7526
04:33:32,120 --> 04:33:33,000
Where's my belt?

7527
04:33:34,340 --> 04:33:35,960
Oh my god!

7528
04:33:36,640 --> 04:33:38,880
The secret matchup!

7529
04:33:39,200 --> 04:33:44,300
We have another invasion of WrestleTuber!

7530
04:33:44,900 --> 04:33:47,960
Who could've thought that another intruder would happen?

7531
04:33:48,340 --> 04:33:51,280
Yeah, we thought there would be like one, but... three?

7532
04:33:51,840 --> 04:33:53,620
Three intruders!

7533
04:33:53,880 --> 04:33:58,060
This is what happens when there's no more security in this event, guys.

7534
04:33:58,860 --> 04:34:01,360
And WrestleTuber keeps you on your toes, everybody.

7535
04:34:03,900 --> 04:34:05,760
I can't believe it!

7536
04:34:05,920 --> 04:34:09,820
Bro, Fettle has to fight a 3D prince!

7537
04:34:09,820 --> 04:34:11,160
He has to fight a shadow.

7538
04:34:11,280 --> 04:34:12,000
What is this?

7539
04:34:12,020 --> 04:34:12,640
Kingdom Hearts?

7540
04:34:12,800 --> 04:34:13,880
What's going on here?

7541
04:34:14,900 --> 04:34:16,080
Fighting Shad.

7542
04:34:16,610 --> 04:34:17,920
Oh my god.

7543
04:34:18,040 --> 04:34:19,680
Did someone say the door to darkness?

7544
04:34:22,760 --> 04:34:27,460
WrestleTuber 2024 is not over yet!

7545
04:34:29,060 --> 04:34:32,340
Your champion for now...

7546
04:34:32,830 --> 04:34:33,200
Battle!

7547
04:34:38,140 --> 04:34:39,160
Oh man.

7548
04:34:39,500 --> 04:34:42,400
I mean, he's showing the world.

7549
04:34:42,460 --> 04:34:44,880
He's showing the world a belt that he literally...

7550
04:34:44,880 --> 04:34:46,520
just won like two minutes ago.

7551
04:34:46,740 --> 04:34:46,980
Yeah.

7552
04:34:47,540 --> 04:34:49,280
He's attached to it.

7553
04:34:49,360 --> 04:34:49,980
He likes it.

7554
04:34:51,100 --> 04:34:54,760
It would be very embarrassing if he loses it in just like...

7555
04:34:54,760 --> 04:34:56,920
you know, after holding onto it for like five minutes.

7556
04:34:57,180 --> 04:34:59,120
He already wrote it into his will.

7557
04:34:59,320 --> 04:35:01,220
He might have to rewrite again.

7558
04:35:07,210 --> 04:35:08,150
He's flexing.

7559
04:35:08,190 --> 04:35:09,070
He's like showing everybody, look!

7560
04:35:09,270 --> 04:35:10,010
Look, guys!

7561
04:35:10,230 --> 04:35:11,230
I did it, guys!

7562
04:35:11,710 --> 04:35:13,610
I won the belt, guys!

7563
04:35:14,070 --> 04:35:14,550
Look!

7564
04:35:14,610 --> 04:35:16,550
He has a pretty heavy belt too, you know?

7565
04:35:16,550 --> 04:35:18,130
He's probably already tired.

7566
04:35:18,390 --> 04:35:19,390
Oh my god, I know.

7567
04:35:19,610 --> 04:35:22,250
Like he's already wasting his endurance right now.

7568
04:35:24,610 --> 04:35:26,570
Fero, you have a match!

7569
04:35:26,970 --> 04:35:27,530
Fero!

7570
04:35:27,950 --> 04:35:30,470
You have a match with Yuusan!

7571
04:35:30,650 --> 04:35:32,930
You can't just use all of your energy now!

7572
04:35:33,490 --> 04:35:34,730
He's gonna gloat a little.

7573
04:35:34,850 --> 04:35:43,250
And just like in Pokémon, when Gary became champion, five minutes later, a new champion might be on the horizon.

7574
04:35:45,170 --> 04:35:46,290
It's Yuuuuma!

7575
04:35:49,520 --> 04:35:51,360
Who is that on the screen?

7576
04:35:59,230 --> 04:36:02,130
He's gonna blow... they're gonna blow your mind.

7577
04:36:06,070 --> 04:36:09,970
I think, you know, the next evolution after human is human.

7578
04:36:10,230 --> 04:36:10,870
Human.

7579
04:36:12,250 --> 04:36:14,030
We are witnessing history.

7580
04:36:14,310 --> 04:36:17,950
Yuusan is the next level of evolution right now.

7581
04:36:19,330 --> 04:36:21,230
I'm afraid for Beto.

7582
04:36:21,470 --> 04:36:25,690
Beto is like tired from all the wrestling he did.

7583
04:36:25,910 --> 04:36:30,230
Just for a secret opponent to just show up?

7584
04:36:30,610 --> 04:36:31,890
Mind freak.

7585
04:36:32,270 --> 04:36:34,730
He's here to freak your mind.

7586
04:36:35,350 --> 04:36:36,010
Wow!

7587
04:36:37,090 --> 04:36:38,390
Look at it!

7588
04:36:38,430 --> 04:36:38,830
Oh my god.

7589
04:36:38,910 --> 04:36:40,130
You know what?

7590
04:36:40,310 --> 04:36:42,030
Yuusan just won by performance alone.

7591
04:36:46,610 --> 04:36:47,370
Holy...

7592
04:36:47,370 --> 04:36:47,930
Time out.

7593
04:36:47,930 --> 04:36:48,750
Touchdown!

7594
04:36:50,770 --> 04:36:52,150
Oh my god.

7595
04:36:52,230 --> 04:36:52,670
It's not over yet.

7596
04:36:52,730 --> 04:36:53,190
Oh my god.

7597
04:36:53,250 --> 04:36:53,830
You know what?

7598
04:36:53,870 --> 04:36:55,370
Yuusan, fan service.

7599
04:36:55,690 --> 04:36:58,030
Giving the fans what they want right now.

7600
04:36:58,290 --> 04:36:59,030
Oh yeah.

7601
04:36:59,590 --> 04:37:00,730
I don't know.

7602
04:37:00,790 --> 04:37:03,450
Beto looks pretty puny next to this guy right now.

7603
04:37:03,770 --> 04:37:05,190
That was gonna be...

7604
04:37:05,190 --> 04:37:06,030
Oh shit.

7605
04:37:06,130 --> 04:37:07,630
Oh my god!

7606
04:37:09,350 --> 04:37:13,210
That's definitely the wrong weight class.

7607
04:37:13,790 --> 04:37:15,090
Holy shit.

7608
04:37:15,090 --> 04:37:17,230
He just falls to the ground.

7609
04:37:17,270 --> 04:37:17,930
It's okay Beto.

7610
04:37:17,950 --> 04:37:18,450
You can do it.

7611
04:37:18,530 --> 04:37:18,990
It's okay Beto.

7612
04:37:18,990 --> 04:37:19,570
Just get up.

7613
04:37:19,590 --> 04:37:20,250
Beto get up.

7614
04:37:20,330 --> 04:37:21,370
Beto you got this.

7615
04:37:22,250 --> 04:37:23,370
Oh my god.

7616
04:37:23,690 --> 04:37:24,210
Yuusan.

7617
04:37:24,210 --> 04:37:25,230
The arms are limp.

7618
04:37:25,350 --> 04:37:26,170
The arms are limp.

7619
04:37:26,230 --> 04:37:27,350
What the fuck?

7620
04:37:27,710 --> 04:37:28,690
Beto please.

7621
04:37:28,910 --> 04:37:29,410
Wait.

7622
04:37:30,790 --> 04:37:34,590
It's a fucking double flip into Beto.

7623
04:37:36,770 --> 04:37:41,070
Not only can you man show off but also show up.

7624
04:37:41,190 --> 04:37:42,570
Oh my god.

7625
04:37:42,590 --> 04:37:43,550
To be fair.

7626
04:37:43,910 --> 04:37:45,070
Yuusan hasn't failed.

7627
04:37:45,090 --> 04:37:47,550
He hasn't fought anybody since his first match.

7628
04:37:49,810 --> 04:37:51,070
He's primed and ready.

7629
04:37:51,670 --> 04:37:56,130
They're primed and ready to beat the shit out of Beto right now.

7630
04:37:57,250 --> 04:38:01,910
Yuusan's not even doing moves to hurt Beto.

7631
04:38:02,110 --> 04:38:03,090
He's just showing off.

7632
04:38:03,490 --> 04:38:04,270
He's just showing off.

7633
04:38:04,490 --> 04:38:04,630
Yeah.

7634
04:38:06,330 --> 04:38:06,930
Oh!

7635
04:38:07,330 --> 04:38:08,890
To the face.

7636
04:38:09,190 --> 04:38:10,010
To the face.

7637
04:38:11,010 --> 04:38:11,610
Okay.

7638
04:38:12,050 --> 04:38:13,730
Hey there's a child there.

7639
04:38:13,830 --> 04:38:14,630
Let's play a little game.

7640
04:38:14,630 --> 04:38:15,070
Let's play a little game.

7641
04:38:15,070 --> 04:38:15,970
I'm gonna let you to do it fair you guys.

7642
04:38:16,150 --> 04:38:16,610
Hey!

7643
04:38:16,750 --> 04:38:18,070
Spin on the child!

7644
04:38:18,170 --> 04:38:19,470
The child will remember it forever!

7645
04:38:22,150 --> 04:38:23,670
He'll absorb the power!

7646
04:38:24,110 --> 04:38:28,210
He'll absorb your power and absorb the nutrients just like how Beto absorbed his twin.

7647
04:38:30,370 --> 04:38:32,250
Yuusan's like is this what you want?

7648
04:38:33,450 --> 04:38:34,370
Take him.

7649
04:38:34,450 --> 04:38:35,370
I don't want him.

7650
04:38:35,870 --> 04:38:37,270
Take out the trash.

7651
04:38:37,350 --> 04:38:38,530
Come on Yuusan.

7652
04:38:39,690 --> 04:38:40,770
Come on Beto.

7653
04:38:40,790 --> 04:38:41,750
Where's your max luck?

7654
04:38:42,130 --> 04:38:45,050
Your max luck should overpower any of your skills!

7655
04:38:45,050 --> 04:38:45,330
Anything!

7656
04:38:47,070 --> 04:38:48,230
Guys, I...

7657
04:38:49,250 --> 04:38:49,770
Guys...

7658
04:38:50,350 --> 04:38:52,450
I think I feel a little bit bad.

7659
04:38:57,110 --> 04:38:57,930
He's tired.

7660
04:38:58,110 --> 04:39:02,030
He like totally let his guard down thinking he was done with all these matches.

7661
04:39:02,110 --> 04:39:03,870
He unclenched, you know?

7662
04:39:04,250 --> 04:39:09,110
He was fully clenched up during the entire tournament.

7663
04:39:09,230 --> 04:39:11,730
And he thought... Beto thought it was just over.

7664
04:39:12,230 --> 04:39:13,190
Wait, is it?

7665
04:39:13,330 --> 04:39:14,070
Uh oh.

7666
04:39:14,110 --> 04:39:14,530
Uh oh.

7667
04:39:14,530 --> 04:39:14,750
Wait.

7668
04:39:14,870 --> 04:39:15,150
Oh!

7669
04:39:16,210 --> 04:39:17,070
What in the blitz!

7670
04:39:17,070 --> 04:39:20,010
Oh no, he's just emoting in the ring.

7671
04:39:29,410 --> 04:39:30,810
No way.

7672
04:39:32,950 --> 04:39:34,470
No way.

7673
04:39:34,590 --> 04:39:37,150
It took all of five minutes.

7674
04:39:38,610 --> 04:39:40,750
But we, um...

7675
04:39:41,910 --> 04:39:42,670
Yeah.

7676
04:39:45,390 --> 04:39:47,730
We have a new champion!

7677
04:39:49,590 --> 04:39:50,350
Human!

7678
04:39:57,470 --> 04:39:58,050
Oh.

7679
04:39:58,270 --> 04:39:58,770
Hahaha.

7680
04:39:59,250 --> 04:39:59,830
I...

7681
04:40:01,310 --> 04:40:02,370
Well, uh...

7682
04:40:02,370 --> 04:40:07,530
I'm not gonna lie, I totally looked away for one minute, and it actually fucking happened.

7683
04:40:08,470 --> 04:40:09,510
Well, um...

7684
04:40:10,170 --> 04:40:11,250
That was...

7685
04:40:11,250 --> 04:40:12,790
That was inter...

7686
04:40:12,790 --> 04:40:13,230
I...

7687
04:40:13,230 --> 04:40:15,410
Well, that was a slaughter, man.

7688
04:40:15,670 --> 04:40:16,250
Like...

7689
04:40:16,250 --> 04:40:19,390
You fell is really emoting in the state...

7690
04:40:19,390 --> 04:40:20,190
What do we do?

7691
04:40:20,650 --> 04:40:21,230
Hahaha.

7692
04:40:23,050 --> 04:40:23,630
Hahaha.

7693
04:40:23,790 --> 04:40:24,370
Hahaha!

7694
04:40:24,370 --> 04:40:29,730
I guess let's talk to Bettle and Ysane.

7695
04:40:33,320 --> 04:40:35,840
Oh, what happened?

7696
04:40:36,380 --> 04:40:36,440
Hey guys!

7697
04:40:37,560 --> 04:40:38,960
Did I win?

7698
04:40:40,820 --> 04:40:42,380
Yeah, hang on.

7699
04:40:42,680 --> 04:40:43,420
No!

7700
04:40:45,520 --> 04:40:49,240
We had the title for 14 seconds!

7701
04:40:51,520 --> 04:40:53,220
You tongue out!

7702
04:40:57,600 --> 04:40:58,640
It's okay!

7703
04:40:58,920 --> 04:41:00,580
It's okay, Bettle!

7704
04:41:00,960 --> 04:41:03,400
It's okay, you know...

7705
04:41:04,560 --> 04:41:05,240
Like...

7706
04:41:05,840 --> 04:41:09,720
It's just... you know... I mean, look at this!

7707
04:41:10,000 --> 04:41:11,600
Like, you really think...

7708
04:41:11,600 --> 04:41:13,100
How was I supposed to win?

7709
04:41:13,220 --> 04:41:16,340
You really think you could win against that?

7710
04:41:16,780 --> 04:41:17,380
No!

7711
04:41:20,120 --> 04:41:20,800
No...

7712
04:41:22,460 --> 04:41:23,520
This is...

7713
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:25,080
This is terrible!

7714
04:41:26,660 --> 04:41:27,040
Um...

7715
04:41:29,840 --> 04:41:32,480
How did it feel to be a winner for five minutes, Bettle?

7716
04:41:33,600 --> 04:41:34,360
Well, I...

7717
04:41:34,360 --> 04:41:35,080
Well, it felt great.

7718
04:41:35,140 --> 04:41:35,440
It felt great.

7719
04:41:35,700 --> 04:41:38,080
I'm happy to be a winner of something for about five minutes, but...

7720
04:41:40,120 --> 04:41:43,680
I just lost it already!

7721
04:41:44,280 --> 04:41:45,440
I'm so proud of you, man.

7722
04:41:45,760 --> 04:41:46,520
I'm proud of you.

7723
04:41:47,120 --> 04:41:48,120
You're the real Chad.

7724
04:41:48,420 --> 04:41:49,540
You did so well, man.

7725
04:41:49,760 --> 04:41:50,040
Wow!

7726
04:41:50,460 --> 04:41:51,260
Thanks, you man!

7727
04:41:52,300 --> 04:41:53,040
No problem.

7728
04:41:53,180 --> 04:41:53,620
No problem.

7729
04:41:53,620 --> 04:41:54,740
We witnessed it!

7730
04:41:55,840 --> 04:41:59,960
We witnessed the mystery in the making by the first evolution...

7731
04:42:00,600 --> 04:42:02,300
The next evolution...

7732
04:42:02,840 --> 04:42:04,640
Of humankind!

7733
04:42:05,040 --> 04:42:06,260
Of humankind!

7734
04:42:06,460 --> 04:42:09,660
One day, it will be just like you saw it!

7735
04:42:11,180 --> 04:42:12,620
One day...

7736
04:42:12,640 --> 04:42:13,620
You man!

7737
04:42:13,680 --> 04:42:14,540
You man!

7738
04:42:14,680 --> 04:42:15,460
You man!

7739
04:42:15,460 --> 04:42:16,340
You man!

7740
04:42:16,580 --> 04:42:17,520
You man!

7741
04:42:17,520 --> 04:42:18,180
You man!

7742
04:42:18,180 --> 04:42:18,600
You man!

7743
04:42:18,940 --> 04:42:19,300
You man!

7744
04:42:19,480 --> 04:42:20,300
You man!

7745
04:42:20,360 --> 04:42:20,960
You man!

7746
04:42:20,960 --> 04:42:21,560
You man!

7747
04:42:22,480 --> 04:42:23,460
You man!

7748
04:42:23,460 --> 04:42:27,080
What are your words to your fans, to your audience?

7749
04:42:28,820 --> 04:42:29,880
What do you have to say?

7750
04:42:31,260 --> 04:42:31,800
Um...

7751
04:42:32,640 --> 04:42:33,920
Check my music video.

7752
04:42:35,520 --> 04:42:37,000
Is this a self-promo?

7753
04:42:40,060 --> 04:42:40,600
Wow!

7754
04:42:45,060 --> 04:42:49,220
You man will be back behind the building selling mixtapes, everybody.

7755
04:42:49,740 --> 04:42:49,940
Yeah, yeah!

7756
04:42:50,260 --> 04:42:51,140
After the show!

7757
04:42:51,140 --> 04:42:53,160
Actually, watch my music video.

7758
04:42:55,760 --> 04:43:09,700
If you guys want a signed copy of you man's music album, come outside backstage for the VIP pass where Chad buys an autographed you man album.

7759
04:43:11,180 --> 04:43:14,200
I guess Beto will also be there, I guess, too.

7760
04:43:14,600 --> 04:43:16,200
What will you be selling, Beto?

7761
04:43:17,940 --> 04:43:18,880
I don't know.

7762
04:43:20,420 --> 04:43:20,820
Nothing?

7763
04:43:21,500 --> 04:43:22,720
Just be there!

7764
04:43:23,280 --> 04:43:25,240
I'll just stand there, I guess.

7765
04:43:26,480 --> 04:43:27,020
It's okay.

7766
04:43:28,080 --> 04:43:29,600
Second place is not too bad.

7767
04:43:29,800 --> 04:43:30,880
That means Billion got third.

7768
04:43:33,660 --> 04:43:34,060
Yeah.

7769
04:43:34,320 --> 04:43:35,280
Yeah, you got second!

7770
04:43:35,880 --> 04:43:38,440
I mean... wait, I got... well, I mean, I got first, then second.

7771
04:43:38,860 --> 04:43:39,820
Yeah, but... yeah.

7772
04:43:39,860 --> 04:43:41,380
What does that equate to?

7773
04:43:41,760 --> 04:43:43,720
Second place, because it was the last second.

7774
04:43:43,920 --> 04:43:43,940
Nothing!

7775
04:43:44,260 --> 04:43:44,660
No!

7776
04:43:44,760 --> 04:43:45,160
Okay.

7777
04:43:45,420 --> 04:43:45,820
Great.

7778
04:43:45,980 --> 04:43:46,000
No!

7779
04:43:48,000 --> 04:43:48,400
No!

7780
04:43:48,400 --> 04:43:48,880
I'm glad I have spoken.

7781
04:43:50,360 --> 04:43:54,100
All right, well, we're gonna take it back to the main casting room.

7782
04:43:54,760 --> 04:43:55,800
Thank you, guys.

7783
04:43:55,940 --> 04:43:57,300
Thank you, Beto, Yusan.

7784
04:43:57,700 --> 04:43:59,120
Thank you for being here.

7785
04:43:59,960 --> 04:44:04,840
Even though Yusan did break in and took away that man's happiness that he felt.

7786
04:44:04,960 --> 04:44:07,240
Like, he was the happiest he's ever been in his whole life.

7787
04:44:07,440 --> 04:44:10,300
And he took it, and they took it away within five minutes.

7788
04:44:10,560 --> 04:44:11,520
But anyway...

7789
04:44:11,520 --> 04:44:11,800
I'm sorry, man.

7790
04:44:12,000 --> 04:44:13,140
Yeah, you did well.

7791
04:44:13,440 --> 04:44:13,960
Bye-bye.

7792
04:44:17,080 --> 04:44:17,840
Thanks, guys.

7793
04:44:17,880 --> 04:44:18,440
Thanks, everybody.

7794
04:44:18,440 --> 04:44:22,080
It was great being a winner for 14 seconds.

7795
04:44:22,220 --> 04:44:23,520
It doesn't hurt at all.

7796
04:44:24,740 --> 04:44:26,460
Yeah, just be better next time.

7797
04:44:26,560 --> 04:44:27,020
It's okay.

7798
04:44:27,500 --> 04:44:28,120
Yeah, okay.

7799
04:44:28,360 --> 04:44:29,980
Yeah, they want me to fight God.

7800
04:44:30,180 --> 04:44:31,380
What was I supposed to do?

7801
04:44:33,740 --> 04:44:35,360
You tried your best, man!

7802
04:44:35,540 --> 04:44:36,380
You tried your best!

7803
04:44:36,620 --> 04:44:37,360
That's all that matters!

7804
04:44:37,460 --> 04:44:41,240
You fought God and lasted, like, at least three minutes.

7805
04:44:41,500 --> 04:44:41,980
You know?

7806
04:44:42,820 --> 04:44:43,840
That's an accomplishment.

7807
04:44:44,600 --> 04:44:46,120
But you don't succeed!

7808
04:44:47,380 --> 04:44:48,420
I mean, he's right.

7809
04:44:48,420 --> 04:44:48,560
You're a great announcer.

7810
04:44:48,900 --> 04:44:49,320
Yeah.

7811
04:44:50,440 --> 04:44:51,040
Thanks.

7812
04:44:51,720 --> 04:44:52,540
All right.

7813
04:44:53,380 --> 04:44:58,920
We're gonna be back to the main stage real quick for Min and I.

7814
04:44:59,020 --> 04:45:00,880
We're gonna see you guys at the main stage, guys.

7815
04:45:01,180 --> 04:45:01,960
All right.

7816
04:45:03,620 --> 04:45:04,220
Wow.

7817
04:45:04,740 --> 04:45:07,100
What a night.

7818
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:08,940
Wow.

7819
04:45:09,880 --> 04:45:10,480
Wow.

7820
04:45:12,180 --> 04:45:15,760
I don't even know what to say about all of that.

7821
04:45:15,860 --> 04:45:16,380
That was...

7822
04:45:17,020 --> 04:45:18,140
That was...

7823
04:45:18,420 --> 04:45:21,620
pretty crazy what we experienced tonight.

7824
04:45:22,440 --> 04:45:22,880
Yeah.

7825
04:45:24,120 --> 04:45:26,300
Truly one for the books, I think.

7826
04:45:26,860 --> 04:45:27,300
Yeah.

7827
04:45:27,360 --> 04:45:31,000
You know, I felt like, you know, like, we should end it with Royal Rumble.

7828
04:45:31,060 --> 04:45:37,940
But with, you know, you, you, man's invasion, I felt like that was, like, the perfect way to, like, end the whole event.

7829
04:45:38,560 --> 04:45:41,040
And what an event, Min.

7830
04:45:41,160 --> 04:45:41,840
What an event.

7831
04:45:42,100 --> 04:45:44,720
Like, there were so many things that happened.

7832
04:45:45,180 --> 04:45:47,000
Like, the fact that, like...

7833
04:45:48,440 --> 04:45:55,320
Fuyo made it so far and, like, pioneered the diaper meta just to get defeated by Bettle.

7834
04:45:55,740 --> 04:46:00,620
And then Bettle won just to lose it in 14 seconds.

7835
04:46:01,380 --> 04:46:03,160
We saw ball grabbing.

7836
04:46:03,340 --> 04:46:05,060
We saw diaper grabbing.

7837
04:46:05,280 --> 04:46:07,080
We saw titty grabbing.

7838
04:46:07,300 --> 04:46:08,300
We saw head grabbing.

7839
04:46:08,400 --> 04:46:10,780
We saw every sort of grabbing that we could have grabbed.

7840
04:46:11,480 --> 04:46:12,620
And you know what?

7841
04:46:12,720 --> 04:46:13,860
You, man, grabbed the title.

7842
04:46:14,020 --> 04:46:16,200
And the belt right off of...

7843
04:46:16,200 --> 04:46:18,840
Right off of Bettle's body.

7844
04:46:25,940 --> 04:46:27,900
Bettle stood no chance.

7845
04:46:28,500 --> 04:46:30,080
That, that, man...

7846
04:46:30,080 --> 04:46:30,640
Oh, my.

7847
04:46:30,740 --> 04:46:33,620
GUSA was fucking built there.

7848
04:46:34,520 --> 04:46:35,320
Oh, yeah.

7849
04:46:35,680 --> 04:46:36,480
I was like...

7850
04:46:37,060 --> 04:46:38,160
Oh, my God.

7851
04:46:38,180 --> 04:46:38,900
I felt like...

7852
04:46:38,900 --> 04:46:41,040
Like, GUSA was just fucking flipping.

7853
04:46:41,420 --> 04:46:46,180
And, like, the fact that, like, they ended it with a flip while Bettle was...

7854
04:46:46,180 --> 04:46:46,280
I know.

7855
04:46:46,480 --> 04:46:52,540
...stayed lying on the ground in his pool of blood outside the ring.

7856
04:46:53,100 --> 04:46:55,540
Just so sad that he was fighting again.

7857
04:46:55,640 --> 04:46:57,000
He was like, why am I here?

7858
04:46:57,380 --> 04:46:59,440
Why am I here just to suffer?

7859
04:46:59,720 --> 04:47:02,540
Just Bettle luck next time, I guess.

7860
04:47:03,140 --> 04:47:03,660
Ooh.

7861
04:47:04,400 --> 04:47:05,960
I guess you gotta come.

7862
04:47:05,980 --> 04:47:09,100
How are you feeling, Dokie, after, you know, pulling off such a crazy event?

7863
04:47:09,400 --> 04:47:10,920
It feels, feels like...

7864
04:47:10,920 --> 04:47:11,480
It's crazy.

7865
04:47:11,720 --> 04:47:14,500
It feels like I'm speechless in a way.

7866
04:47:14,500 --> 04:47:17,740
Like, there's no words to really describe how I really feel right now.

7867
04:47:18,240 --> 04:47:24,280
There was some stuff along the way, but everybody enjoyed the experience, the time, the fans, the participants.

7868
04:47:24,580 --> 04:47:27,680
You should have seen the Discord while the matches were going on.

7869
04:47:27,780 --> 04:47:28,420
Oh, yeah.

7870
04:47:28,420 --> 04:47:34,280
Like, the cast, the staff, and, like, the participants were just, like, laughing along the way with some of the stuff that was going on.

7871
04:47:35,260 --> 04:47:38,400
Mid, how do you feel casting for this after breaking in?

7872
04:47:39,060 --> 04:47:39,820
Oh, it was great.

7873
04:47:39,920 --> 04:47:41,280
Thank you for having me.

7874
04:47:41,380 --> 04:47:44,240
And, you know, sorry that I, like, kind of just can't...

7875
04:47:44,240 --> 04:47:45,740
Sorry that I killed, like...

7876
04:47:45,740 --> 04:47:47,700
But, hey, but, you know, think of it.

7877
04:47:47,760 --> 04:47:50,020
I killed off a bunch of guys, so you don't have to pay them.

7878
04:47:50,220 --> 04:47:51,120
Oh, that's true.

7879
04:47:51,220 --> 04:47:51,800
That's true.

7880
04:47:52,160 --> 04:47:52,960
Easy peasy.

7881
04:47:53,200 --> 04:47:54,480
That is so true, Mid.

7882
04:47:54,640 --> 04:47:59,900
But, like, some would say you're the reason why Beto lost, like, his belt.

7883
04:48:00,620 --> 04:48:01,580
Wait, what do you mean by that?

7884
04:48:01,700 --> 04:48:10,880
Because by you killing the security guards, you started the domino effect of all these other contestants coming in because we had no more security.

7885
04:48:13,260 --> 04:48:14,140
Um, I...

7886
04:48:14,140 --> 04:48:14,220
I don't know.

7887
04:48:14,220 --> 04:48:21,140
I think what the other thing I have to say about that is, if you were a real champion, you would be able to beat anybody that comes in through that door.

7888
04:48:21,280 --> 04:48:21,700
Sounds like a good strategy.

7889
04:48:21,700 --> 04:48:23,420
So, even if it's Grandpa or Joe...

7890
04:48:24,240 --> 04:48:27,960
So, Beto did not deserve the belt.

7891
04:48:30,840 --> 04:48:31,320
Sorry.

7892
04:48:32,320 --> 04:48:33,120
Sorry, Beto.

7893
04:48:33,500 --> 04:48:34,500
Beto next time.

7894
04:48:34,520 --> 04:48:35,580
Beto next time.

7895
04:48:36,100 --> 04:48:36,780
We're all going to have to wait.

7896
04:48:38,640 --> 04:48:39,120
We're all going to have to wait.

7897
04:48:39,120 --> 04:48:39,780
Before we call it.

7898
04:48:39,820 --> 04:48:39,860
Before we call it.

7899
04:48:39,860 --> 04:48:43,740
We got to thank some people for this event.

7900
04:48:43,920 --> 04:48:44,200
I'm really sad that I failed.

7901
04:48:44,200 --> 04:48:50,480
For the people that made the graphics, everything from here, the videos and everything.

7902
04:48:51,080 --> 04:48:59,980
First off, as you guys can see, the logo, belts and graphics were done by SugarType, Melly and OniPilot.

7903
04:49:00,080 --> 04:49:04,300
A huge shoutout to them for making the assets for those things.

7904
04:49:04,560 --> 04:49:09,200
We also have other people who thank, like the trailer video and the singers.

7905
04:49:10,120 --> 04:49:15,480
The last minute... I think... sorry, my...

7906
04:49:17,020 --> 04:49:17,620
Katara.

7907
04:49:17,660 --> 04:49:20,800
It says Katara from Avatar The Last Airbender.

7908
04:49:20,820 --> 04:49:21,400
Katara!

7909
04:49:22,580 --> 04:49:23,180
Amazing!

7910
04:49:23,660 --> 04:49:24,260
Katara!

7911
04:49:24,420 --> 04:49:27,020
Oh my god, Katara was here too, guys?

7912
04:49:27,400 --> 04:49:28,640
Holy shit!

7913
04:49:31,400 --> 04:49:33,480
It's okay, it's Katara-mine, you guys.

7914
04:49:34,300 --> 04:49:37,380
It wasn't actually Katara, she was here in spirit.

7915
04:49:37,460 --> 04:49:38,000
It was Katara.

7916
04:49:39,200 --> 04:49:41,320
Katara's spirit name has a different name.

7917
04:49:41,320 --> 04:49:41,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7918
04:49:41,780 --> 04:49:42,920
And her name is Katara.

7919
04:49:43,420 --> 04:49:47,940
She inspired the original... the Katara from Avatar The Last Airbender.

7920
04:49:48,140 --> 04:49:49,900
It was based off of Matara.

7921
04:49:50,040 --> 04:49:50,540
Yeah, yeah.

7922
04:49:50,640 --> 04:49:56,260
But yes, we want you guys to know, like those intro videos, like the Mint and Matara intro videos were done like...

7923
04:49:56,260 --> 04:49:59,020
basically on the day of their period.

7924
04:49:59,500 --> 04:50:02,760
It's like I received the Matara video like this morning.

7925
04:50:03,140 --> 04:50:03,800
This morning.

7926
04:50:04,920 --> 04:50:09,100
So a huge shoutout to Hebe and Nightden.

7927
04:50:09,200 --> 04:50:10,200
And then...

7928
04:50:11,360 --> 04:50:13,940
Finally, we have also the...

7929
04:50:13,940 --> 04:50:16,560
the backgrounds that was done.

7930
04:50:16,640 --> 04:50:18,760
The stadium background was done by JL.

7931
04:50:18,960 --> 04:50:25,500
And the fanart compilation, the video that you saw during the intermission and the starting stream and the outro in the end...

7932
04:50:25,500 --> 04:50:27,100
was done by Rabbit Hole.

7933
04:50:27,180 --> 04:50:31,060
So they looked through all the fanart and put it all together into the video for us.

7934
04:50:31,200 --> 04:50:32,940
So a huge shoutout to them.

7935
04:50:33,120 --> 04:50:36,480
And finally, a shoutout to everyone that participated.

7936
04:50:37,160 --> 04:50:38,500
All the contestants.

7937
04:50:38,500 --> 04:50:39,540
All the wrestlers.

7938
04:50:39,540 --> 04:50:40,520
The staff team.

7939
04:50:40,700 --> 04:50:42,440
For giving up their time.

7940
04:50:43,300 --> 04:50:44,200
Being here.

7941
04:50:44,440 --> 04:50:46,220
Like all those hours being here.

7942
04:50:46,280 --> 04:50:47,060
Doing the interviews.

7943
04:50:47,220 --> 04:50:47,940
Doing the announcements.

7944
04:50:48,080 --> 04:50:48,820
Doing the casting.

7945
04:50:49,200 --> 04:50:52,740
They all gave up their time to be here participating in this event.

7946
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:55,440
And so we gotta give them a shoutout.

7947
04:50:55,480 --> 04:50:58,520
My throat is dying after casting for two hours.

7948
04:50:59,140 --> 04:51:00,340
Can I go home now?

7949
04:51:00,480 --> 04:51:01,540
Can I go home now?

7950
04:51:03,140 --> 04:51:03,700
Sorry.

7951
04:51:04,080 --> 04:51:04,460
Yeah.

7952
04:51:05,460 --> 04:51:06,020
Huge...

7953
04:51:06,020 --> 04:51:07,000
Great...

7954
04:51:07,000 --> 04:51:08,020
Great announcing.

7955
04:51:08,760 --> 04:51:11,280
Man, you did amazing for your first time.

7956
04:51:11,600 --> 04:51:13,000
This guy was so nervous.

7957
04:51:13,300 --> 04:51:13,340
Oh, thanks.

7958
04:51:13,760 --> 04:51:14,680
He was so scared.

7959
04:51:14,680 --> 04:51:15,020
I was.

7960
04:51:15,020 --> 04:51:15,560
I was shaking.

7961
04:51:15,980 --> 04:51:16,420
Yeah.

7962
04:51:17,160 --> 04:51:17,940
It was crazy.

7963
04:51:18,060 --> 04:51:20,300
How do you feel announcing for WrestleTuber?

7964
04:51:21,140 --> 04:51:22,020
I'm fucking tired.

7965
04:51:24,080 --> 04:51:24,960
Bro, I...

7966
04:51:24,960 --> 04:51:27,240
My head is like slightly lightheaded.

7967
04:51:27,300 --> 04:51:29,200
I was like, man, I guess I did use a lot of oxygen.

7968
04:51:31,260 --> 04:51:31,880
I'm beat.

7969
04:51:32,760 --> 04:51:33,200
Yeah.

7970
04:51:33,280 --> 04:51:34,140
We're all tired.

7971
04:51:34,280 --> 04:51:34,880
But it's...

7972
04:51:34,880 --> 04:51:36,460
It's almost over, guys.

7973
04:51:36,620 --> 04:51:37,500
It's almost over.

7974
04:51:37,580 --> 04:51:42,540
And finally, a shoutout to Gamersupps for sponsoring this tournament, this event.

7975
04:51:42,780 --> 04:51:43,960
They paid for everything.

7976
04:51:44,140 --> 04:51:48,040
Basically, I didn't have to pay for any of the stuff like the belts, the...

7977
04:51:48,820 --> 04:51:52,460
The belts, the graphics, the videos, all that stuff that I said all these people made.

7978
04:51:52,640 --> 04:51:53,900
I didn't have to pay for it.

7979
04:51:54,760 --> 04:51:58,100
Gamersupps kindly decided to pay for all of this.

7980
04:51:58,280 --> 04:52:00,100
So thank you again to Gamersupps.

7981
04:52:00,260 --> 04:52:03,700
Well, this is the end of the show, everybody.

7982
04:52:03,700 --> 04:52:05,760
My throat is dead.

7983
04:52:07,640 --> 04:52:09,820
My throat is dead.

7984
04:52:10,160 --> 04:52:14,160
Do you have any final words, Mint, to tell the audience?

7985
04:52:14,560 --> 04:52:14,760
Nope.

7986
04:52:14,760 --> 04:52:15,060
Okay.

7987
04:52:15,340 --> 04:52:16,480
