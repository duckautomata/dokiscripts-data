day today we actually have it's it's a little less scuffed

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:39,910
they're still gonna be scuffed because i am a one mad obs
person but but but we did improve that we did improve the

12
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:47,790
tech and behind the scenes for all of you guys so I hope you
guys look I even have my own cut like we even had time to

13
00:06:47,790 --> 00:07:00,470
afford a custom headset as well instead of the default
headset but we actually have a set schedule for the casters

14
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,790
as well as what the matches are so I'll give you guys the
rundown of the brackets and who's to be casting who?

15
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,850
Mint and I will be casting the finals, the last couple of
final matches.

16
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:22,870
So at the first set of rotations, we actually have two
special guests that will be doing, that will be casting the

17
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,650
show matches for us.

18
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:37,790
We have someone that has been in the actual WWE casting the
show match with BuffBuff, Bluzy, Maryletter, and Shy Lily.

19
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,370
And so our special guest is actually Jibo.

20
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:53,170
If you guys don't know who Jibo is, he was in the actual WWE
Mason Mace.

21
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,390
If you guys don't remember Mason.

22
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,770
He was actually in WWE and he will be doing the casting with
Taka for the show match.

23
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,370
I'm sorry, it's not John Cena.

24
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,930
Sorry, Mason D Madden.

25
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,090
It is not, guys, it is not John Cena.

26
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,970
I mean, technically he could be there.

27
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,610
He could just be in the background.

28
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,630
We don't really know.

29
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,510
You can't really see him.

30
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,670
Anyway, so for the brackets, after the show match, match.

31
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,430
This will be our bracket for the day.

32
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,530
It's a little bit more professional now.

33
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:43,570
So the very first match after the brackets, sorry, after the
show match will be Fuyo versus Snuffy.

34
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,870
Then after that, whoever wins that match will be against
Nana.

35
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,130
And then whoever wins that match will be against Emma.

36
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,890
And then after that, we have bracket two.

37
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,590
This bracket will be casted by and Phillion.

38
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:09,310
So right after the show matches with our guest casters, Taka
and Jibo, we will have Snuffy and Phillion casting these

39
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,510
matches in bracket two.

40
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,090
Sorry, this is the original.

41
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,250
I just say there will be a little bit of scuff.

42
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,410
And they will also be casting Luto versus Sayu as well.

43
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,250
After that, we will rotate our casters with Kai and Octavio.

44
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:39,730
Unfortunately, Gerard has to, Gerard has to, uh, uh, is sick
right now, so he will be substituted by Kai, uh, and from

45
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,750
there, uh, they will be casting the winner of the Luto vs.

46
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:54,030
Side match against Anon, and then after that, they will be
casting for the, two of the final matches, um, for the final

47
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,850
matches, for the final bracket, we, Mint and I will be
spinning a wheel.

48
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:12,090
to to dictate who will be facing who in the final bracket
and from then on and then we find the champion yay it's

49
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:23,730

WrestleTuber.

52
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,690
I hope you guys will enjoy day two, everybody.

53
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,470
I really do hope you guys will enjoy day two.

54
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,170
Anyway, from there on, remember, do you guys remember what
the belt looks like?

55
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,990
Because whoever's going to win this show match will be
bringing this belt home tonight.

56
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,190
Well, not tonight.

57
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,630
They still have to ship it.

58
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:11,350
PNG tonight all right well I guess that's it for me in the
main casting chair so let's go over to our guest casters in

59
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,490
the interview section bye guys

60
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:27,460
what a day for wrestling let me tell you it's great to be
here back to V-Tubing after 10 months alongside you Yibo

61
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,540
Dhaka it is pandemonium in the wrestle drone are you feeling
tonight you had to come out of uh hiatus i had to come out

62
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:42,180
of retirement this is a big fight field oh it's at without a
shout out without night one was explosive so that means

63
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:49,500
night two will be implosive it expands and now it retracts
and as it retracts more things will be colliding in the

64
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,460
center of that squared circle ladies and gentlemen i i'm
going to explore it all over the place taka we are both

65
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:03,760
guest casting here tonight i am yellow snow takahada and i
am by Dick Inkey Yebo.

66
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,300
Yes, you can call me Dick Inkey.

67
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,640
That is my commentary name.

68
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,900
I'm the only person here to have Vince McMahon yapping in my
ear during commentary during a horrible Hell in a Cell

69
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,220
match.

70
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,680
Tonight, I've got Doki in my ear.

71
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,100
So if I say anything bad, it's her fault.

72
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,300
There we go.

73
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,760
You confirmed her right here.

74
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,460
She is the master of this domain.

75
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,860
Her domain has expanded to encapsulate professional
wrestling as well.

76
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,640
And we're up for a heck of a first bout here because I
brought you up.

77
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,940
we're having a mixed tag action and i believe we have an

Amazing.

85
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,740
We are, our show match will be consisting of two tag teams,
consisting of Mary and Buffpup and Lucy and Shy Lily.

86
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,380
So for the two dog pros, how are you feeling about this
match so far?

87
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,260
Well, I'm, when it comes to double D's, that's what we are,
we're the double D crew.

88
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,820
Okay, I feel very confident just because dogs get things
done so yeah yeah dogs back we're just gone well that's true

89
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:45,200
i'm certain we're going to win because i've got buff pop so
i mean that's true and also like i like bones so like if i

90
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:54,960
make charlie and lucy a skeleton then i can just take them
so oh i see him yeah i didn't think about that well what did

91
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,500
the two cute girls have to say in response i want buff to
sit on my face all right done easy i got a bone that you can

92
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,920
chew There's not much work.

93
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,680
There's a bunch of banter between both tag teams.

94
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,380
The tension is both palpable and sexual, Yibo.

95
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm palpitating all over the place right now, Taka.

96
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,340
That's what wrestling is about, just like body contact with
way too much skin.

97
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,380
Yeah, honestly, like if I win or lose, like I think I'm
winning regardless, so, you know.

98
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm winning either way.

99
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,100
I'm happy to hear that there's great sportsmanship and
skinship here with all of the contestants in the show match.

100
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,540
Well, other than being choked and being sat on, I hope you
guys do well in the ring and good luck.

101
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,920
Thank you so much.

102
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,680
Yes, of course.

103
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,300
Thank you so much.

104
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,220
Goodbye.

105
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,460
Goodbye.

106
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,760
Please fight me.

107
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,600
See you.

108
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,020
Bye.

109
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,230
Now I gotta say, one tag team is absolutely gorgeous.

110
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,870
Well, they're both gorgeous, to be honest, but one team does
appear to have that dog in them.

111
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,090
Dog is very important when it comes to a professional
wrestling match, Taka.

112
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,870
Because they can run around on all fours like a hound.

113
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,450
But so can cats.

114
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,550
That's true.

115
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,090
But not like hounds, but like cats.

116
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,830
Speaking of cats and dogs, that's what this scrap is going
to be all about.

117
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,850
Let me tell you.

118
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,470
It's like a feral free-for-all.

119
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,790
A fere-for-all.

120
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,770
A fere-for-all, correct.

121
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,590
Absolutely.

122
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,290
Absolutely.

123
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,990
Now, I got to get, let's take it away to a ring announcer.

124
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:48,070
sir in this corner you can hear them barking from two
corners of the planet you have the buff bro buff pop and

125
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:58,680
attention is palpable I do not know what they're about to
say well what's happening right now is the is the big dog is

126
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,640
making their entrance singles because they are taking their
sweet time I mean, when you look at this buff, you look this

127
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:14,380
talented, you look this amazing, you'd take your time to
basking in this adulation from this wonderful capacity crown

128
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,300
of over 13,000 people in the Ressler Trooper Dome.

129
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,320
What?

130
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,940
What state are we in right now?

131
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
A state of denial, Yibo.

132
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes, yes, that's the correct answer.

133
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,000
Because no one can deny.

134
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,350
audience how buff this pup is where where does that tail go

135
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,000

Svelvety.

139
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,740
Svelvety.

140
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,800
I get appreciate Maryweather getting a custom model just for
this occasion with their symbol on the back.

141
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,740
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money.

142
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
Money, money, money, money!

143
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,980
Usually people smoke in that jacket, but he may end up
smoking the competition in it.

144
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,460
Yeah, let's see if he can make it rain on his competition
tonight.

145
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,460
Mm-hmm.

146
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:59,860
opponents coming in from the other side of the ring it's not
just Lucy juicy it's Lucy pyre now hold on now Taka did she

147
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,940
just wake up I clearly she was napping in the back they got
themselves a coffee they still have brought the blanket

148
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,000

wake up in the morning you're like i'm gonna go get my

149
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,280
coffee and like you know i i i appreciate the dedication to
taking some time to get some sleep because the one thing you

150
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,680
don't want to do is sleep on the competition and that it
might be what i just wonder if i just wonder if she's fully

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:32,700
prepared for what's going on today it looks like she's still
napping well hopefully she starts with rest holds to start

Maybe they were sleeping in the same place.

156
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,460
Maybe they were sleeping in the pool house.

157
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,180
Either way, Shire Lily, wamp, wamp indeed, ladies and
gentlemen.

158
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,060
I have seen how she has destroyed a pineapple.

159
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,220
This person can destroy the competition.

160
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,240
The crowd is wamping.

161
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,100
What did she destroy the pineapple with?

162
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,080
You know what?

163
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,520
It's best left unsaid.

164
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,520
Interesting, interesting.

165
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
And the crowd is wamping.

166
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,340
Don't you see the wampage happening in the audience?

167
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
as you can hear them Wompa Media.

168
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,360
Wompa Media is running wild.

169
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:41,900
Wompa!

170
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,220
Wom!

171
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,380
Wom!

172
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:44,840
Wom!

173
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,200
Wom!

174
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,300
Wom!

175
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Wom!

176
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,900
Look at the eyes.

177
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,760
The eyes tell a story.

178
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,540
The eyes don't lie and the eyes spell disaster tonight at
Sacrifice.

179
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,800
The apex mammal of our species.

180
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,340
And their opponents are in for a whale of a time.

181
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,540
That's good tucker thank you thank you you should get a
raise you know what you know what

182
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:26,300
maybe maybe if you're good speaking of good this match is
brought to you by gamer subs everybody thank you for all of

183
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,820
you to attending this wonderful event and let's get this
thing started with some tag team action let's go it's a

184
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:40,420
tornado tag look at the size of buff pup I'm a bit of a tag
team aficionado myself.

185
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm undefeated on the Independence champion in multiple
countries.

186
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,380
So if you have any questions for how to win a tornado tag
team match, feel free to ask me.

187
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay.

188
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,520
So as a...

189
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,680
Now, if you're the biggest person in the tag match, like
Buff Pupp is, how do you avoid getting targeted by the

190
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,060
wierly, small, tiny ones?

191
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,900
Just like that.

192
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,440
You do a Thespress and you beat the pulp out of the face,
Taka.

193
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,380
If you stay off the ground, can't put you on the ground.

194
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,500
And look at that!

195
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,560
Look at that!

196
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,500
She just sat on her!

197
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
That cake-based offense.

198
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,260
Now, Mary just grabbed a sledgehammer from underneath the
ring.

199
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,400
Now, this is an extreme rules tornado tag match, and this is
essentially a complete anarchy already.

200
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,700
Shia Lily's got a steel chair!

201
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,320
She got steel chair!

202
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,420
Everything goes!

203
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,220
Narrowly avoiding the chair.

204
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:38,140
Buff-puff avoiding the damage, locking up with Shia Lily yet
again, and Shia Lily decides to walk the dog to the road.

205
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,440
Oops.

206
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,960
Oh, if you put the dog on the leash, they're not going to
like that very much, Taka.

207
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,540
Oh, and just kneeling.

208
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,540
Lucy.

209
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, and that's exactly what you need to do against a larger
opponent, Taka.

210
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,600
You've got to chop the tree down, break down the legs, and
make sure they have nothing to walk on.

211
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,580
Cork screwing them.

212
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,440
Oh, kicking apart all the limbs.

213
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,020
Oh, a pin attempt is being made.

214
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,620
That's not just a pin.

215
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,480
That's a sexy pin.

216
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,400
Sidewalk slam, maybe?

217
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,440
Oh.

218
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,320
I believe they call that deep pin attrition.

219
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,840
It rhymes with attrition.

220
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,120
Makes me want to get back in the ring, Taka.

221
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,400
It does.

222
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,300
I mean, you've got to be feeling enamored by these
superstars in the ring.

223
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,580
Buff Pup laying in an absolute clinic.

224
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,460
Oh, now the numbers game.

225
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,140
How would you handle someone with the size and buffness of
Buff Pup?

226
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,180
Well, honestly, Taka, I've never been in the ring with
somebody bigger than me.

227
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm approximately nine feet tall and 800 pounds, but there
was somebody who was...

228
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,880
Oh my God!

229
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,020
What was the sledgehammer throw?

230
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,840
They threw a sledgehammer at Lucy Pyer's head!

231
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,340
Absolutely no regard for human society and well-being.

232
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,000
They say dog is man's best friend, but they can also be your
worst enemy if you cross him.

233
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh, look at that's Chekhov's table right there.

234
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,700
Somebody's got to go through it by the end of the match.

235
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,160
Otherwise, everybody's going to be disappointed.

236
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,820
One armed Press!

237
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,380
That's the size advantage there, Taka.

238
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,360
Oh, and a knuckle shuffle.

239
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,840
That wasn't all five.

240
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
That was just four knuckles.

241
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,900
We see Mary going again for another item.

242
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,820
Oh, I got a trash can!

243
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
About to take out the trash!

244
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,380
Somebody says, you know, who is trash?

245
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,320
Mary's saying that Lucy Pire belongs to the trash.

246
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Oh, what a beautiful!

247
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:48,340
move by bus pop there it looks to me like the dogs are in
control the dog and now going for a sneaky pin here like

248
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:57,220
hold on kick out at one but we got us tables we have a table
at play the crowd is going wild they're saying tables tables

249
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:05,820
tables oh nice this is hard to even call this is now it
looks like the team of Shia Lily and Lucy have managed to

250
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,500
start matching up with the dogs a little bit more now trying
to keep pace lucy grabbing the garbage can she was placed in

251
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,040
oh i thought we were going to see a double team on the
outside perhaps being sandwiched between the trash can and

252
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,500
two dogs

253
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:32,200
shyly throwing but oh and a rolling damage there to buff up
who just slammed into the great as mary is picking apart

254
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,040
lucy pyre on the other side the dogs are firmly in control
here tonight, Taka.

255
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,740
The dogs are barking, and that's not just from the audience,
folks.

256
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,380
But dogs can get overly worked out.

257
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,460
They can tire themselves out before even realizing it, and
that's the challenge.

258
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,360
Can their singular... Oh, it just threw that in the back of
Shantily Lee's head!

259
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,280
Unbelievable!

260
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,560
Now, Taka, that's actually a great point.

261
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,360
Could the dogs have started off really hot and maybe tucker
themselves out before the match is over?

262
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:18,040
a game of attrition it really depends are they in the small
dog park or the big dog park oh I see a couple of big dogs

263
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,800
and a couple of people in the audience are chanting for the
big dogs but I guess we'll find out who when they win

264
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:32,060
tonight Lucy being double-teamed by Mary a buck buck buck
buck striking a pose taunting arrogance will we'll have to

265
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:39,500
see if that comes back to bite them but Lucy grabbing an
item from under his mind was about to grabs him from under

266
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,020
the ring, but no, Bump Pup's got a, oh, beautiful.

267
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh, turning neckbreaker into even more offense.

268
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,620
Chai Lilly taunting the opponents to get into the ring.

269
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,680
Into the hammerlock.

270
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,380
What is this?

271
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,480
What is Chai Lilly going for here?

272
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,900
And that's a beautiful back body drop.

273
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,760
Lucy's on fire!

274
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,140
Oh!

275
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,560
Will that be enough for Bump Pup?

276
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
Oh, break up by Shai Lilly.

277
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,200
This is the danger of a tornado match.

278
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, a big dog punch!

279
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:20,240
blood blood kick out of two only two that was close taka
what is pop pop doing that's 500 pounds of oh never mind

280
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:31,460
we're good go fine oh no okay no that's smart he's too big
to go up there just taking out just taking out shy lily oh

281
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:43,200
my gosh she's got a family one beat down oh and lucy takes a
steel crown of the head from mary Oh, a pop-up drop kick.

282
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,720
Oh, a reverse.

283
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,040
I'm slightly reversing it.

284
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,440
Oh, and a drop kick from Mary.

285
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,400
This is...

286
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,720
This is getting hard to watch, Tommy.

287
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,380
Oh, this is some PWG-style wrestling right now.

288
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,660
Oh, my God.

289
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,420
Buff-Pup with the sledgehammer.

290
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,640
Haunting the opponents.

291
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,540
They've been pretty cocky since the start of this match.

292
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,660
Oh, hitting Mary!

293
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Muffpump just hit Mary in the back of the head.

294
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,000
Couldn't take advantage.

295
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,220
She couldn't take advantage of the miscommunication, and
they are back on the same page.

296
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,520
The dogs are in sync.

297
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,060
Silently thrown away.

298
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,560
Lucy Pire grabbing hold of Mary, throwing Mary back in the
ring.

299
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,300
Pinfalls have to occur inside the ring, to my knowledge.

300
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,740
And Lucy- That's very true.

301
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,280
Oh!

302
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,620
Pulling Muffpump.

303
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:37,960
What's this?

304
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,980
Oh!

305
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,780
My goodness!

306
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,840
Topi!

307
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,040
Topi sueshida!

308
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,780
Mama Mia!

309
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,000
Buffpup is, what is Buffpup thinking right now?

310
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,740
Oh, into the steps!

311
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,280
Somebody's got to go through that table, Taka.

312
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,620
Bad booking.

313
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,040
Someone has to, we have three tables at play right now, and
oh, oh, back in the, oh, back in the head.

314
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,000
But it's not in the ring, it's not in the ring.

315
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:06,920
Oh!

316
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,560
Mary had the candlestick knocked out of their hand.

317
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,160
Buff Pup is observing.

318
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,360
This is their chance.

319
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,360
This is their chance.

320
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,360
This could be it.

321
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,710
He's woofing up.

322
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,070
And now the teams are switching.

323
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,950
Now they're both targeting.

324
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,150
They're going after Lucy again.

325
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,650
It's that pack-a-dog mentality, Taka.

326
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:32,750
Never mind.

327
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,130
Mary has decided to switch up and go after her shot.

328
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,970
Oh, miss.

329
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,730
Did they hit?

330
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,430
No, they did hit.

331
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,150
Wow.

332
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,910
It's really not safe to be throwing these weapons around.

333
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,730
Don't throw Kendo sticks.

334
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,150
That's not a...

335
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,570
blood on the outside.

336
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,790
Bup, Bup taking apart Lucy.

337
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,250
And Shia Lily makes Mary pay for it on the outside.

338
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,410
In all my years, I don't think I've ever seen a match this
brutal.

339
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,730
What is Bup, Bup doing on the outside?

340
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,030
On the outside.

341
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,210
That's the hardest part of the ground, Taka.

342
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,790
Back of the, back of the head.

343
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,590
Whoa, oh my God, Mary almost tapped out.

344
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,290
Mary almost tapped out there for a second.

345
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,130
This could be it.

346
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,530
Oh, now she's bleeding, too.

347
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,370
Mary going for a pin.

348
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,410
One, two.

349
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,130
Oh, that's it.

350
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,530
She was so close.

351
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,610
Last second.

352
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,870
Your winners.

353
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,590
Give a good old bark for the dogs.

354
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,770
Meriwether and Boff Paul.

355
00:29:52,830 --> 00:30:05,970
not only did they have those dogs in them those dogs won now
their opponents have their dog in them too man's best friend

356
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:14,670
man's worst enemy Taka what do you think what what did you
expect going into that match did you expect that outcome I

357
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:27,220
actually expected Shia Lily to be bigger than buff pup
whales are very big Yeah, yeah, they start off pretty big,

358
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,620
but big dogs stand on top.

359
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,020
That's true.

360
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,400
We're also on land, so.

361
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,700
Wow.

362
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,360
Wow.

363
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,860
What a show.

364
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,160
I can't believe the double Ds.

365
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,740
They won.

366
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:53,460
I need to ask, I must ask the two cute girls, how did it
feel having a very buff big dog?

367
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,900
come at you with a sledgehammer.

368
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,540
I would be shitting my pants if I was in your position.

369
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,560
I need to say something.

370
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,900
Why was she, oh my god.

371
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,840
Why was she, where the alpha cut off?

372
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,540
Is that as good for you as it was for me, pop?

373
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,900
Honestly, I was scared.

374
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,420
There was one point where I thought I was gonna get like 18
plus and I was really nervous.

375
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:19,140
I was like, I was like, I was like, oh my god, I feel so
bad.

376
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,660
I literally was like bashing everyone's head with a
sledgehammer.

377
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,140
I don't know what the heck came over me.

378
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,260
I need a rabies vaccine after.

379
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,860
I even hate Mary.

380
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,700
We have to call 911 again.

381
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,780
911, please.

382
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Well, for the double D team.

383
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,920
Round two?

384
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,260
Round two?

385
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,880
Nice.

386
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,100
Either, bro.

387
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,300
We'll do round two next weekend.

388
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,620
Okay, okay.

389
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,780
On my place.

390
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,340
Well.

391
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,780
Well, does the double T have any?

392
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,820
I think he needs to be put down.

393
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,500
I think he needs to be put down.

394
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,400
I need backup.

395
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,140
Please.

396
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,360
I can't drink water.

397
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,020
I need, hello.

398
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
Cut the cameras.

399
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,160
I need, I need help.

400
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,020
Don't worry, buddy.

401
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,460
Just, it's the rabies.

402
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,500
It's the rabies.

403
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,160
It's okay.

404
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,600
That dog needs to be neutered.

405
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,380
It's okay.

406
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,320
I'm my dog alone.

407
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,700
He's fine.

408
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,240
He's fine.

409
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,080
He's just excited.

410
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,260
Come on.

411
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,840
Got this, don't worry.

412
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,200
She got it under control to worry about it.

413
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,720
You saw in the match, she had to, like, put him in place as
well in the match.

414
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,480
I did, I hit him in the back of the head with a sword chain.

415
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,700
She had no friends only in the whole match.

416
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
I love wrestling!

417
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,060
I love her!

418
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,000
Rory, it's like, just give him a second in the crate.

419
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
He'll be all right after.

420
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,220
In the crate, all right, I understand.

421
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,400
He just, he still needs crate training.

422
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,040
He's just a puppy.

423
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
He needs to be trained and leashed.

424
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,060
Well, do you, thank you so much for the show match.

425
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:02,740
Do any of you guys have any words for the upcoming matches,
like any motivational speeches that you could possibly give

426
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:02,980
them?

427
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,700
I better see some bloodshed.

428
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,560
I better see some double D action out there.

429
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,700
Okay, I want to see, I want to see some flinging, some
flying, some barking even.

430
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,180
Maybe some sweat.

431
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,280
I need sweat and blood and sweat and sweat and I hope it
gets sweaty.

432
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
I think we're getting a cream for next week.

00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,740
I guess this is behind the scenes Doki here.

441
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,200
We're going to be going back to the main stage everybody.

442
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:17,020
But let's say a huge thank you to everybody here for the
show matches and the winners of the show match.

443
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,800
The dogs.

444
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,540
I was very surprised they beat the anime girls.

445
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,080
But I guess So, I guess...

446
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,520
Every dog has its day.

447
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,200
Some girls might need some rabies shots later.

448
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,800
Anyway, say thank you to all the people there.

449
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,000
We're going to go back to the main stage to get ready for
the tournament.

450
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,000
Thank you.

451

00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:41,920
Bye.

455
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,380
Oh, wow.

456
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,680
I forgot to take the belt off.

457
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,600
Hey, like I said, thank you.

458
00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:02,120
the people at the show match um that was fucking extreme it
was a last minute change I know originally it was like a

459
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:13,740
tornado tag but then I decided to change it to extreme
because I was like whoa they can like throw hammers so I had

460
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:23,200
to include it again a huge shout out to our guest casters
give me a sec I want to be sure if um Snuffy and Philean are

461
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,740
ready to cast the beginning of the tournament.

462
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,000
So give me a sec as I cue them in.

463
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,460
Guys, one man army here.

464
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,060
If they're not ready, we will have a little change of
casters.

465
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,660
We might have Kai and Octavio to start us off.

466
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,060
So just give me a sec as I check it out here.

467
00:35:51,040 --> 00:36:02,380
waiting uh for those who are waiting um the first match is
not this one that is not the first match the first match was

468
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:13,060
technically fuio versus snuffy uh but at the moment i am not
sure if snuffy is in the ring at the moment so if we do not

469
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:23,700
have um if snuffy and snuffy is not here yet we will might
have Octavio and Kai come over to do bracket two I believe

470
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:33,960
we to do bracket two for Araka and Luto so for now at the
moment I don't believe Snuffy is in the stadium at the

471
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:44,820
moment so we are going to have a little slight change of the
casters and we are going to have Kai um kai and octavio to

That is good to know.

481
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,980
I was a little worried when I didn't get any response.

482
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,700
I'm sorry, Aaron.

483
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,400
And no one's here for some reason.

484
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
We're in the break room.

485
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,240
Yeah, yeah, we were peeing them from the break room.

486
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:52,260
I had to be sure they were here and ready to cast before I
rotate them in.

487
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,140
But yes, thank you again to Kai for substituting for Gerard.

488
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,920
Are you guys ready to cast for your first match?

489
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,200
Do you guys remember what your first match is?

490
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,200
Yes.

491
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,180
Who are they?

492
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,180
Who are they before I send you over to the interview table?

493
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Oh, shit.

494
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,480
Who are they?

Yesterday.

And then that, that counts though, right?

505
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,480
That counts.

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,040
Yeah.

Then I lost.

510
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,940
So we're both losers here.

511
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,480
We're like, we're the perfect people.

Yeah, no, it's great.

513
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,240
You know, it'll break like a good perspective, I think.

514
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,400
All right.

515
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:32,920
The perspective of those who, who will never make it in the
WWE ever.

516
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,200
Okay.

517
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,140
Just sound sad when you put it like, just sound sad.

518
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,260
All right.

519
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:46,760

525
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:44,280
i think luto might still be in the break room maybe having
some cheese and crackers who knows but uh honestly though

526
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,620
honestly while we wait i just want to say um i am very
excited to be substituted in um i saw that we were missing a

527
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,700
red reptile and i was like oh wait i'm also a red reptile
this will work uh so yeah the other reptile extinct already

529
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:17,560
way better you think so yeah definitely you know what here's
the thing yesterday i was beaten by a dragon i mean i beat a

530
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,460
dragon oh really and now i'm casting with a dragon so i
think that's character development for me yeah true true

531
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,820
true um although i think you're you're crazy because i don't
think you'd be a dragon but anyway that's that's crazy

532
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,720
that's that's just like my opinion that's that's the way i
want to see things you can't beat a dragon but you know it's

533
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,760
fine you know if you want like lie like that you know that's
cool you know fair and square fight no i didn't see nothing

534
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:48,200
no i didn't see nothing well i saw your fight no you didn't
you got beaten within like three minutes you didn't you i

535
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,500
don't think you saw anything and i think you're crazy and i
think you're strange for saying that actually yeah excuse me

536
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:01,340
you had the biggest trash talk in the beginning too you're
like i'm gonna split this lime into two and squirt it into

537
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,900
your eyes oh my god you did Yeah, second.

538
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,620
Alright, okay, down.

539
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,860
No, I would have rather you not perceive me, alright.

540
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,320
No.

541
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,700
Okay, listen.

542
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,880
I need it to at least, like, okay, I'm a firm believer in,
like, manifestation, all right?

543
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,360
If you want something to happen, you've got to believe it's
going to happen, all right?

544
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,060
So I'm like, you know what?

545
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm going to, hell, yeah, I'm going to beat her fucking ass.

546
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,320
Hell, yeah, I'm going to fucking win.

547
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:22,840
But you know what?

548
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,140
Sometimes it just...

549
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
That's a lot of talk.

550
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,920
And that's why we're now here, all right?

551
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,980
And I'll be here.

552
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,820
The loser's bracket casting.

553
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh, but trust me, if it was me and June on the ring, I would
have win.

554
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,260
I would have won.

555
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,080
So, yeah.

556
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,100
It was just a bad matchup on my end.

557
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,580
We've already met up and we talked about this, Papu.

558
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
No, I'm sorry.

559
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,160
I'm sorry.

560
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,400
No, again, I'm manifesting.

561
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,240
I would literally be...

562
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,140
Stop calling Pukenya, you fucking pukenya.

563
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,260
I literally be right.

564
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,820
I think we need a show match.

565
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,480
Do you see what I have to put up with?

566
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,780
We are getting some response from Luto Real, not Clickbait.

567
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,240
She's on her way.

568
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,520
She's just grabbing some snacks.

569
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,560
Oh, and there she is!

570
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,540
Sayu, Luto!

571
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,220
Are you here?

572
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,400
So that's what my opponent sounds like?

573
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,240
This is definitely Luto.

574
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,100
Yes.

575
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,260
Damn.

576
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,280
Are you inside Sayu?

577
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,220
I'm excited to be here.

578
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,320
It'll be my debut as a wrestler.

579
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
It's gonna be great.

580
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,800
It's gonna be great and Luto, How will you defeat someone
that's, you know, four or three times your size?

581
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:47,740
With my Australian powers and demon powers.

582
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,500
Demon powers.

583
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,000
Australian demon powers.

584
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,660
Yes, because all demons come from Australia.

585
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,800
This is true.

586
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,340
Oh, my.

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,460

I do love how he's staying on brand.

617
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,160
Right foot forward as well.

618
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:14,480
Look at this.

619
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:18,620
Oh.

620
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,480

00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,140
It's okay.

622
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,500
Oh, there he goes.

623
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,340
Into the ring.

624
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,140
He rolls in.

625
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:24,480
All right.

626
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,680
It's funny because he's just tech support.

627
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,500
And he's doing this.

628
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,540
Honestly, I get...

629
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,460
I get surprised at how well you could customize these.

630
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,440
Holy fuck.

631
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:47,100
And now, coming to the stage after grabbing.

632
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,920
Oh, freaking.

633
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,950
The suspense!

634
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,010
It's Ludo!

635
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,690
Hey, Yasqueen.

636
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,690
Look at that slave.

637
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:06,210
Yeah!

638
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,950
Let's fucking go!

639
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,170
I didn't expect this very bright outfit, bright pink, blue
and yellow.

640
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,450
Bright is the way to go though, okay?

641
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,810
It makes you look flashy, alright?

642
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,630
You get extra style points.

643
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,090
I love the holographic horn too.

644
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,130
It's a vibe, it's a vibe.

645
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,170
Like, it's just, it's her world and we're just living in it,
really.

646
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,890
Her weird Australian middle world.

647
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,010
Actually, wait, I can't remember.

648
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,370
You got that headphone thing?

649
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:42,850
You know how the skull gets compressed because of you
wearing headphones he has to look at them oh no don't do him

650
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:54,330
like that don't do him like that damn a little shimmy all
right all right i see you i see you luto knows how to work

651
00:48:54,330 --> 00:49:06,010
the crowd yeah look at that oh my god wait i just realized
that's a diaper that's a diaper i guess demons need diaper

652
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:07,430
True.

653
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,950
Bro, I can hear myself.

654
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,030
There we go.

655
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,750
Sayu with a Goku hair.

656
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,830
If Luto's smart, she'd take off the diaper and just yeet it
at him as an intimidation tactic.

657
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,050
Immediately with a...

658
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:25,790
Oh my god!

659
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,510
Don't tell me this big demon is a high flyer.

660
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,390
He's starting with the freaking aerial moves.

661
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,330
Holy crap!

662
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:34,990
Already pinned?

663
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,670
Oh, you broke your back.

664
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:38,250
No.

665
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,810
Oh, focus on the arm.

666
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,450
Yeah, clip those wings.

667
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,770
Those demon wings.

668
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:49,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,910
Oh, oh, she's in pain.

670
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,890
Oh, oh, she's gonna come back.

671
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:54,330
Reversal.

672
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,810
Miss the elbow.

673
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,310
Oh, and he brings her top one down.

674
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,990
Sayu targeting the legs here.

675
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:06,630
Oh!

676
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:08,830
Oh, that's got a heart.

677
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,550
You know kangaroos are, have really strong punches.

678
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,310
I'm not sure if they're, they're so scary.

679
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,090
Woo!

680
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,590
Ow!

681
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,030
Nice!

682
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,590
Look at that leap.

683
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,470
He's crazy!

684
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,230
This big demon is a high flyer.

685
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:24,790
Right?

686
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,450
This fucking maneuvering!

687
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,250
That's terrifying!

688
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,230
Ooh, suplex by Sayu.

689
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,550
Oh, they're going back in the ring.

690
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,270
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

691
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:35,510
Right.

692
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,130
Sia being polite waited for Luto.

693
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,830
Very nice of him.

694
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,190
To the turnbuckle.

695
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:42,950
What's going on?

696
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,550
Oh, is she gonna jump on him?

697
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,650
Another aerial!

698
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:46,370
Oh my god!

699
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:47,010
No!

700
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:47,710
Oh, come on!

701
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,290
500 pounds!

702
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:51,950
Jesus, his ribs are broken!

703
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,270
On top of the tech support!

704
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,970
I think the diaper added more pounds to it too.

705
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:02,930
Dude, I think so!

706
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,590
Oh god!

707
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,230

711
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,130
No, no, no, no, no.

712
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,050
Come on, you got to step it up.

713
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:49,990
I'm not feeling impressed yet.

714
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:51,550
Thanks a lot.

715
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,790
I feel like both of their endurances are really, really
high.

716
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,810
Oh, me to the face.

717
00:51:59,170 --> 00:51:59,990
Freaking jumping around they're doing.

718
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,590
Oh, she keeps missing like that.

719
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,290
Dude, those free aerial kicks just take me out.

720
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:23,230
every time it's so brutal all right do they get are you
gonna jump another area oh oh but oh here we go oh she gets

721
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:37,930
oh she gets fucking knocked down it's funny i can't i can't
help but one submission okay true true you kind of you kind

722
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,930
of have to wonder what the heck is in that diaper.

723
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:41,010
That's true.

724
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,690
It's very, very bloated.

725
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,890
I want to find out if I'm being honest with you.

726
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,730
I don't want to know.

727
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,070
What's scary is that the tail also pops out of the diaper.

728
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:59,290
So that's already like a hole in there.

729
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:01,910
So who knows?

730
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:05,210
Maybe there's a signature move with that diaper.

731
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,770
Oh, no, but they got out.

732
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,070
They're fighting outside.

733
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:15,290
You got to get in the ring.

734
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,030
You got to get in the ring.

735
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,950
Oh, man, Sayu's just getting carried away.

736
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,750
What's the count for?

737
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,490
Damn, Sayu taunting.

738
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,690
Doesn't care about the count.

739
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:29,190
Right to the hamstrings.

740
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:31,850
Oh, there we go.

741
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:32,630
All right, back in there.

742
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:32,990
There they go.

743
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:33,510
There they go.

744
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,010
Luto thinking about her life choices.

745
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:37,610
Taking her time.

746
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,170
She's taking her time.

747
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:38,830
She don't need a rush.

748
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,510
Does she want to move from Australia to America after this?

749
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:42,090
Who knows?

750
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,630
Oh my god.

751
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,150
Poor Luto.

752
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,270
She's just getting beat the fuck up.

753
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,990
Oh my god.

754
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,350
Being dragged on the floor.

755
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:55,890
Oh, finish her.

756
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:56,950
Oh.

757
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,990
No, it's it's it's Sayu's favorite move.

758
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,510
Oh, and the the the clip in the wing.

759
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:13,510
again oh my god yeah you know if you really kind of think
about it it almost looks like saiyu's kind of wearing a

760
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:21,730
diaper too a little bit just just a little bit for the back
there that's that's a new meta it's a new meta for wrestling

761
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:31,930
yeah you know it works for intimidation yeah honestly though
if i saw luto the ring i'd ship my pants too so you know

764
00:54:54,570 --> 00:55:06,570
sat on saiyu's face with that dirty diapar oh not quite not
quite almost Oh, rolled out of the ring.

765
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:09,670
Sayu needed to escape.

766
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,890
Not the miss.

767
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,030
This is actually pretty...

768
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:24,930
Oh, what's he doing?

769
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,430
He's gonna do it.

770
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,310
He really likes the hands.

771
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:32,590
Subplex!

772
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,470
Oh, is this gonna be a triple subplex?

773
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,130
How is he doing that?

774
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,130
That demon is a thousand pounds!

775
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,030
And he's just tech support!

776
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,250
Oh man!

777
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,850
Oh man.

778
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:56,270
Trying to remove, trying to decapitate the demon there.

779
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,770
Oh!

780
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,970
I like how they have the same color scheme.

781
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:04,930
They can be on one team.

782
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,010
They got like that hot pink going on.

783
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:08,870
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,290
Oh my God, literally 20.

785
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,170
Oh, oh, is Sayu gonna be counted out?

786
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,630
No, come on, you gotta get out.

787
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:18,210
Nine!

788
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:19,070
Sayu!

789
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,110
Not like this!

790
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,830
Not like this!

791
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,890
Lutha wins!

792

Holy shit!

793
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,310
Lutha won that.

794
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:28,430
Damn.

795
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,670
By knocking Sayu out of the ring.

796
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,550
After she went to get some snacks,

797
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:38,410
It's Luto!

798
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:42,590
Woo!

799
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,310
Holy crap, dude!

800
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,090
I thought I was going to win.

801
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,310
Oh my god.

802
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,670
Yeah, no, that chest is crazy.

803
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,110
That's really big.

804
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,590
That's what the diaper does.

805
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,250
That's the power of the diaper.

806
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:55,790
Holy shit!

807
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,050
Yeah, it embeds the chest.

808
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,990
And makes everything like really, really strong.

809
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:02,590
Damn.

810
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:03,390

Luta, I must ask.

821
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,170
I've been curious, and I'm sure the audience is also very
curious.

822
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,550
What was your inspiration for your outfit?

823
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,130
Oh.

824
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,650
I'd like to know that, too, actually.

825
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,770
I wanted to be the most, like, flamboyant one.

826
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,750
I wanted to kill you guys with how gay I am.

827
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:30,910
Whoa, whoa!

No!

831
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,310
Well, the power of...

832
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,190
I can't believe it.

833
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,070
Sayu has died by gay.

834
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,190
You know what?

835
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,730
A way to go.

836
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,490
Wouldn't have it any other way.

837
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,730
Did you like my diaper?

838
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,470
Did you like it when I sat on your face?

839
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,830
Yeah!

840
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,050
Was it warm, Sayu?

841
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,590
You sat on Sayu's face with the diaper, please?

842
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,630
No, I wasn't a fan of the diaper, but everything else is
fine.

843
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,870
Everything else was fine.

844
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,810
The diaper I wasn't a fan.

845
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,010
Oh, we were fans of it, huh?

846
00:58:59,130 --> 00:58:59,330
Okay.

847
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,990
We really like the diaper.

848
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,150
See, this is why I stick to a desk job.

849
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:15,110
the match was super close I I you guys went on for a while
and I must say I'm very proud of both of you guys even

850
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:27,430
though someone may have up their class a little bit because
of a diaper I I think it was a fair fight you really think

851
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:35,190
about it there was a pin and that's very dangerous on the
diapers so if anything I'm just saying probably just

852
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:43,430
qualifications could be a thing Sayu, your suit was made out
of metal, so I don't know what you want me to do.

853
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,110
No, it just looks that way.

854
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:45,170
It just looks that way.

855
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,070
It just looks that way?

856
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:46,970
What is it?

857
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:47,730
It's just cloth?

858
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,710
It's just very good cashmere.

859
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,450
I don't know what you want from it.

860
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:54,390
Oh, yes.

861
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,810
The cope, man.

862
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:56,730
The cope.

863
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,150
Actually, AI zero, humanity one.

864
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:03,930
Well, thank you so much.

865

Octavio for casting the first game.

873
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:15,370
We have Snuffy and Philly in the house now.

874
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,810
In the stadium, in the backstage.

875
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,070
Can I'm queuing in?

876
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:24,790
Can we get Snuffy and Philly on the intercoms for us?

877
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:25,970
Snuffy and Philly.

878
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,690
Are you guys here?

879
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,090
Hello.

880
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,670
Are you guys ready?

881
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,610
We're ready, boss.

882
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,570
All right, Snuffy.

883
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,670
Do you know who is next in the match?

884
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:52,790
myself yeah and she's against fuyo yes yes oh miss fuyo whoa
now fuyo is in the building as well how do you feel snuffy

885
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:59,030
finally how do you feel i get to talk to fuyo the legend
we've been saying a couple words back and forth not gonna

886
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,890
lie to you chat oh yeah why didn't you guys post that on on
Twitter, right?

887
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,530
I should have, I should have, right?

888
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:11,270
You should tweet that out right now so that the viewer
audience will know what, anyway, for those who don't know.

889
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,210
You better make this pop off, because it's about to age
poorly in 20 minutes.

890
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,750
Yeah, we're talking milk out here.

891
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:24,090
I need you guys to know, Snuffy and Fuyo were like,
chit-talking each other in the server.

892
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:31,730
Oh, like they were making like, elaborate videos and
everything to each other, But they never posted it in the

893
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:32,170
public.

894
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,750
I had no I was like, why can't just tweet that shit out?

895
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:45,790
What is up with this high effort video shit to each other,
but it just stayed in the discord server I was so confused.

896
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:55,490
Anyway, next matchup is with Snuffy versus Fuyo and will be
casted by Snuffy and Philly and off to the interview stage

897
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:56,010
to them

898
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,670
did scrimmable yesterday and now my voice is frick today.

899
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,170
Um, if it cracks then it is what it is.

900
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,330
Also, snuffy did you just use Sadako and Judo stone
yourself?

901
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,530
That's actually an actor I've substituted myself in for.

902
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:25,370
Okay, you're fighting a leprechaun reject or what's going on
here?

903
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,910
That's, excuse me, that's Fuyo Man?

904
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,110
I can't believe that's Fuyo Man.

905
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:31,790
Fuyo Man

906
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,280
So that's the way I pull in.

907
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
I'm so fucking dead, you guys.

908
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,160
You're dead already, but you haven't even seen it before.

909
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,100
Oh, my God, oh, man, please.

910
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,640
Mercy, mercy.

911
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,860
No, mercy.

912
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,240
Oh, shit.

913
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,100
Come on, man.

914
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:55,600
I don't know.

915
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,860
It's going to be like this, dude.

916
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:57,820
I thought, I don't know.

917
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,120
This is, yeah, I want to hear some tender version of Drake
right now.

918
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,880
Like, let's have him make this young public.

919
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,740
All right, and I'm going to, I'm going to be motherfucking
Cheerios, because I've got to eat this leprechaun for

920
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,820
breakfast, dude.

921
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,420
Let's go.

922
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,340
Why did you say lucky Trump?

923
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,020
Last night.

924
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,840
But you were too scared to show up.

925
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,920
Snuff, you're gonna take that?

926
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:19,560
Yeah.

927
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,520
Let me just, what do these cards say?

928
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,160
Just call me Daft Punk because tonight I'm gonna get lucky.

929
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,320
I'm gonna get lucky.

930
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,380
I'm gonna fold your liquor full of my laundry.

931
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:40,620
Okay.

932
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,900
I'm over witnessing Twitter in real life right now.

933
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,920
I just want to see them fight.

934
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,560
I just tweeted an aggressive video towards Fuyo Cloverman.

935
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,180
Oh, and you're sub-tweeting right now?

936
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,460
He told me that's what I'm going on.

937
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,760
I can't come up with anything clever, so I'm resorting to
posting on social media.

938
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,000
That's classic.

939
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,660
Fuyo man will destroy.

940
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:20,520
oh god all right well loser has to delete their twitter can
we agree oh no yeah we'll put all the cards on this one

941
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:32,540
that's simply the winner well i the tension and i i feel one
is very very ready and the other is a little intimidated

942
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:41,960
slightly ever so slightly i think but i am excited to see
how but it's finally happening and I'm sure everyone else is

943
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,760
super excited.

944
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,140
Wow, wow, wow.

945
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,200
Are you ready to fight?

946
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:46,820
It's my grand legacy.

947
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,100
I'm about to win four games in a row in Fulio.

948
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,560
You're going to be the first step on the way to victory.

949
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,420
It's your pain in the vent.

950
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,400
I would like to see you in Chihuahua.

951
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,320
Dang.

952
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,220
Snuck it.

953
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,740
How are you going to commentate yourself?

954
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,080
Don't worry.

955
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,240
It's a hired actor.

956
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,400
This is all a hired actor performance.

957
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:15,060
list of things that i'm extra skilled at wait it's nothing
we saw seats yesterday i was on the other side how sick is

01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:40,340
throwing garbage all over the way yeah You look like you
need a gastric bypass.

961
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,020
I don't know if this is going to work out, Snuffy.

962
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,280
This is Danny Stovito.

963
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,740
This is my hired actor.

964
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:51,540
He's too paid to win the game for me.

965
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,800
Danny Stovito.

966
01:06:53,340 --> 01:07:04,220
In this corner, we have the little green thing becoming the
big green thing.

967
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,260
It's not Fuyo Cloverfield.

968
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,620
It's Fuyo Mervito.

969
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,500
Why is there another diaper?

970
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,680
I can't deal with this man.

971
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,340
Well, Philly in wrestling does get dirties.

972
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,460
He's also about to have the accidents on the ring.

973
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,280
Are those programmer socks?

974
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,100
What is going on, ladies and gentlemen?

975
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,000
Remember, fuck?

976
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,700
Yeah, you see that, John?

977
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,360
No, those are like highs.

978
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,640
Like, like knee highs.

979
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,500
Those are beautiful.

980
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:34,540
Kind of kinky.

981
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,320
Oh, nice.

982
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,500
A little bit of sugar in his step, dare I say.

983
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,420
A little bit of face in here.

984
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,240
Thanks.

985
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,180
A little bit of gold at the end of the rainbow, you know?

986
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,060
We're showing us the whole rainbow right now.

987
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,400
They're really doing it to us.

988
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,360
They're showing us his lucky charms.

989
01:07:52,820 --> 01:08:04,660
And finally, risen from her slumber, debuting the face
reveal, the trash man, Snuffy!

990
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,580
Snuffy, you didn't shave!

991
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:12,460
What?

992
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,280
It's me!

993
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,220
I'm over here!

994
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:17,720
It's me!

995
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:18,840
I'm over here!

996
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:19,620
I'm winning!

997
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,240
I'm gonna win it all!

998
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,400
Wait, can you not hear the game sound either, Snuffy?

999
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,180
It's true, everybody!

1000
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,780
It just sounds like you're talking in a room by yourself to
me.

1001
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,080
Why isn't the crowd going crazy right now, guys?

1002
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,540
Come on!

1003
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,320
Everybody!

1004
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,000
Woo yeah!

1005
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:37,780
Woo yeah!

1006
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,240
Woo yeah!

1007
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,620
You're gonna hit the MC hammer?

1008
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,620
Who's fucking tweaking right now?

1009
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,940
What am I watching right now?

1010
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,720
Are you gonna take off the hoodie or is it stay on in the
fight?

1011
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,940
I think I take it off.

1012
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,660
I'm really curious to see.

1013
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,320
Oh yeah.

1014
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,520
That, no, okay.

1015
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,020
You shouldn't just put her back on.

1016
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:09,900
Okay, here we go.

1017
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,440
I gotta fucking win this.

1018
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:11,680
Hold on.

1019
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:11,900
Oh my god.

1020
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,600
Okay, we're so not fast.

1021
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,240
Snubby just handed the actual beat down on this man.

1022
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,700
Slate head slam to the face.

1023
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,120
And this dude is already reeling.

1024
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,260
I don't know where Snubby's just under the table right now.

1025
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,880
Am I slow casting this?

1026
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,580
Fuck you.

1027
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,520
Fuck you, big.

1028
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,000
Okay.

1029
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,400
I'm just going to go for these straight up arms snap.

1030
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,840
Okay, now this is about to be the actual.

1031
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:48,560
actual Richter floor scale earthquake right now.

1032
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,000
Slip.

1033
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,300
There's no way it's over.

1034
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,960
Wait, one, two.

1035
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,000
Okay, no, just a one count.

1036
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,620
Just a one count.

1037
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,300
It's not if you don't get too ahead of yourself.

1038
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,540
You're not going to get them that effing easy.

1039
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,400
But so far, this has been a one-sided beatdown.

1040
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:05,060
I feel like I'm watching, I don't know, like, Michael's son
from GTA try and fight Trevor right now.

1041
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,920
This is absolutely grim coming out of the effing gates here.

1042
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,900
I mean, okay.

1043
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:12,980
Straight for the nuts.

1044
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,320
I mean, hit him where it hurts.

1045
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:14,840
That's a street.

1046
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,520
critical.

1047
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,500
The cereal box!

1048
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,280
Snuffy walks back to her corner and gives this man some time
to breathe only to come in with a rocket fist face slam.

1049
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,660
I mean, this is ridiculous.

1050
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,540
This dude's Mowalk is painted like a rainbow and his face
can be painted red soon.

1051
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,960
It's Snuffy getting pinned?

1052
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,920
But Snuffy, you almost got reversed.

1053
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:34,100
Alright.

1054
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,540
Looks like this man's trying to take out the trash.

1055
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:51,800
And Snuffy really and this man is making a getaway just
kidding the animation canceled back into the arena okay and

1056
01:10:51,800 --> 01:11:01,520
stubby's going for the backbreaker gonna age his spine about
a few years and now she's tossing out the trash herself i'm

1057
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:08,820
gonna i'm gonna eat you like an egg this is called hide in
the body she's going this one from metal gear solid and now

1058
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:16,680
she's gonna pick them up and maybe like i don't even know
put them back down doing an Eminem rap song right now.

1059
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,360
I'm going to do my signature move.

1060
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,540
A trash growl, bruh.

1061
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,400
We go.

1062
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,980
I think you messed up.

1063
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:29,620
Snuffy!

1064
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,880
No, no, this is the- This is the build up.

1065
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,480
Look at that.

1066
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,960
Oh, yeah, baby!

1067
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,100
Oh, yeah!

1068
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:41,040
My man, it's sniffing the rainbow, but the back foot misses,
and he gets up.

1069
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:41,600
Get a fucking whip.

1070
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,300
Oh, shoot.

1071
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,840
I feel like Snuffy might be getting wrong.

1072
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:53,620
here she's getting taken out too again off the top rope I
think her spine at a 45 degree angle but this man is Jesus

1073
01:11:53,620 --> 01:12:12,980
Christ crushing in her chest cavity right now for you oh
wait it's not very good it's not very good and both of them

1074
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:19,340
decide to make a mutual agreement to take the fight outside
of the exact same time but this man tenacious he stops at

1075
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:31,900
nothing oh my god i'm just a wealthy match anymore this is a
brawl in the back streets of detroit okay snuffy's about to

1076
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:38,700
take him and throw him back where he came from sending him
out of the arena himself oh god they're getting married you

1077
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:45,040

he's going back in he's gonna pick snuffy up now we're

1078
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:51,400
entering dangerous territory ladies and gentlemen there's an
epic six seconds on the four more seconds and they're going

1079
01:12:51,400 --> 01:13:02,800
to be out I'm gonna win it oh okay not bad okay they're back

1080
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:12,440

reset back to default programming right now I mean she might

1081
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,700
go work at a trash compact drive this jobs over but she is
fighting for the ground to the nail she was just in a

1082
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,200
Okay.

1083
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,120
I'm going to gouge your eyes out.

1084
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,600
Oh, God.

1085
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,100
The key.

1086
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,460
Oh, oh, oh.

1087
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,760
Eddie's giving her some crazy action right now.

1088
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,480
Even crazier action.

1089
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,880
It's not me and do it.

1090
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,980
No, she is not.

1091
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,560
No, she's not.

1092
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,060
And this man is so frustrating.

1093
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,440
He got her number, but he couldn't get to fourth base.

1094
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,640
So he's going to taunt her now that she's on the ground.

1095
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,840
This is insane.

1096
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,340
Oh, yeah.

1097
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,100
Oh my god, she's getting stepped on.

1098
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,580
She's like watching an effing sub in real time.

1099
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,960
I'm not talking submarine, ladies and gentlemen.

1100
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,700
T-bagged her on the way through.

1101
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:02,440
Picks her up and slams her down on the floor.

1102
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,820
Oh my god.

1103
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,000
And now this man is hitting an effing...

1104
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,820
Haka Ranger?

1105
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,080
Okay.

1106
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,460
I think Snuffy just might be dead.

1107
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,560
I'm not willing to sit in a call, Maverick anymore.

1108
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,900
Wait, what's going on?

1109
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,500
She's getting back.

1110
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,620
I mean, I know vTubers are light, but come on, Snuffy.

1111
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:25,980
Drop like a paperweight.

1112
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,600
Holy moly.

1113
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,800
Okay, this could be it.

1114
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,640
Is he gonna do a backflip?

1115
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,280
He just straight up misses.

1116
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,820
You thought I was dead.

1117
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,080
Oh my god, that's Snuffy's turn to turn around.

1118
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,740
That's why I'm a paid actor, Fuyo man.

1119
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,560
That's why I'm a paid actor.

1120
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,660
And now I'm gonna make you eat dirt.

1121
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,440
I mean, that was a devious elbow straight to his left
nipple.

1122
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,460
I think that might be an epic another one to the left
nipple.

1123
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,480
We're taking serious damage there That's got to be bruising
Okay, the third team back of the fight.

1124
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:02,920
He goes in for the single shot Snuffy counters and then
tosses him out like trash again.

1125
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,280
Oh my god that looks like an illegal nut shot.

1126
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,180
He went head over nut and he is down on the ground for sure
I'm just falling on top of you.

1127
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,500
I don't have any special moves.

1128
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,420
Oh god.

1129
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,260
I'm gonna twist you Snuffy's just gonna break his neck.

1130
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,940
You're gonna rip your ears off.

1131
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,340
Some of these moves are getting down by illegal, ladies and
gentlemen.

1132
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,520
In the night, they are busting out all of the moves.

1133
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,900
Andy need to win this crown.

1134
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,360
Oh, God.

1135
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,620
Snuffy, you're fleeing the fight right now?

1136
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,960
Just give me like...

1137
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,800
Oh, my God.

1138
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:39,860
Oh, no.

1139
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,280
The green goblin comes in with the effing green neck snap.

1140
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,540
Snuffy's down for the count, but it's a good thing she can't
not get pinned outside of the arena.

1141
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:55,720
might be dead right now oh my god that was my heart i think
it just exploded okay he just he's just sending her back i'm

1142
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:06,200
getting yanked around like i'm feeling snuffy harry-pill
about the fight so far how you have so much endurance wait

1143
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,300
the ball is off of the mat and she's actually getting
polarized

1144
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:19,840
jesus christ somebody called dana white this is getting
Outside the scope of a fight.

1145
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,140
I mean, I don't even know snuff.

1146
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,220
You can get up in time.

1147
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,500
We're up to six seconds ladies and gentlemen Two more
seconds maybe like oh my god.

1148
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:37,420
Seven seconds No one they restart the count they restart the
count Head into the knee I mean snuff these notes have

1149
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:42,980
become internal at this point You don't have any belly
buttons, but there's too many people counting on me right

1150
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:47,960
now My senpai my master I won't disappoint them.

1151
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,920
I can't God, after all the training I went through.

1152
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,600
All right, Zuko Midori is kicking it in the gear to take out
Bakugo here.

1153
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,300
I'm not sure if this is going to pay off, though.

1154
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:57,180
Oh!

1155
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,700
I'm going to show everybody my special skill.

1156
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:06,910
She's heading into the London Bridge is falling down.

1157
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,890
I don't know if this man can survive what's happening right
now.

1158
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:17,770
I think Snuffy has 18 different variations of falling on top
of him, and it's somehow working.

1159
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,850
Don't be afraid of the dark.

1160
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,230
Dude, there's no way!

1161
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,070
My god, this was so close!

1162
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,750
This was so close!

1163
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,410
Snuffy's about to say blood for the blood god.

1164
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:33,310
Just give up!

1165
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,670
The hammerer the elbow dropped.

1166
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,670
I think Snuffy's saying my order was still raw, she wants a
refund on it.

1167
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:45,270
I'm not really sure to take him that one.

1168
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,450
Give me my drink!

1169
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:53,350
I think three concussions in this fight, ladies and
gentlemen, and these characters are not really still in at

1170
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,790
this point.

1171
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:56,070
We're just watching cells of their former cells.

1172
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:57,770
I'm gonna make your fucking brain.

1173
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:59,930
A shamrock shake.

1174
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:06,410
Oh, and Snuffy uses the fallen for the 18th time.

1175
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:08,550
I mean, Snuffy certainly has a favorite move.

1176
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:09,730
Let's fucking go.

1177
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:13,690
Just call me fucking fall guys because you're about to see
this guy fall.

1178
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,830
She had a backflip.

1179
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:16,210
There's

1180
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:20,690
no...

1181
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,670
Oh my god.

1182
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:22,230
Oh my god.

1183
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:24,750
For real man, you have the endurance of a god.

1184
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,050
I commend you.

1185
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:26,870
I commend you.

1186
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:27,730
I commend you.

1187
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,570
Come in with a hearty choke to the neck.

1188
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,870
I mean, this is the fight that keeps on giving, chat.

1189
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,230
It is like hepatitis.

1190
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,050
These fires do not stop for anything.

1191
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:37,670
Come here.

1192
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,130
Come here.

1193
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:40,310
I'm going to show you why I take out the garbage.

1194
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:45,470
At some point, I wouldn't be surprised if Snuffy grabbed an
audience from the effing stands to pull into this fight.

1195
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:46,530
Use them as a bludgeon.

1196
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:46,930
Oh, God.

1197
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:48,770
I mean, this is getting serious business.

1198
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,050
I see a kid in the front row.

1199
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,350
I mean, I don't know if he can handle that.

1200
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,650
Let's see what's happening right now.

1201
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:57,970
They're back into the arena as we speak, and I think
Snuffy... Oh, God.

1202
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:15,610
Oh, she oh I mean your man are you exhausted oh shit my
balls I don't know how these two fires are still standing

1203
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:27,110
wait there's no way he says nothing do you like that you
like that she does not oh my god she's still in this fight I

1204
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,330
don't even know how they're still alive.

1205
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,690
This random nerd in the back is cheering for USA.

1206
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,090
I think this man came to the wrong concert venue.

1207
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,570
Oh my god.

1208
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,710
I'm American.

1209
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,990
She's a leprechaun.

1210
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,350
Can Snuffy take out the luck of the Irish?

1211
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,350
No, that guy said this is awesome.

1212
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,070
Get alive.

1213
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,370
Heck, he just got kicked through the rope.

1214
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,490
I don't even know what's going on.

1215
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,510
I just got my toe stubs.

1216
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,810
Oh god.

1217
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:56,130
What's happening?

1218
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,290
Oh, please.

1219
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:01,990
Wait, this is gonna be it?

1220
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:03,310
Is he gonna go for the pin?

1221
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,130
No, another power bomb.

1222
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:06,230
Never mind.

1223
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:07,290
I don't know what's happening.

1224
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:09,150
The fireman- Oh!

1225
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:11,970
A new move, ladies and gentlemen!

1226
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,050
Oh!

1227
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:18,650
That is a fractured elbow, and now he's raising the roof
like an F-ing 2018.

1228
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,450
Oh, I don't know if my kid lasts.

1229
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:24,090
I don't know if you can make it, but the Roar in 20s is
called.

1230
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,330
They want their dance move back.

1231
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:35,130
the top rope I imagine but he's really far away from snuffy
I don't know if he can reach oh my god and he turns her head

1232
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:46,430
into a pancake I mean her IQ is definitely below 100 if it
wasn't before just kidding wait snuffy took our own self out

1233
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:47,690
of the move

1234
01:20:50,810 --> 01:21:04,490
snuffy no you took yourself out and our winner it usually
isn't easy being green but today green has won it's for you

1235
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:20,130
man yeah actually sacks and i imagine the wind tastes a lot
more like pennies holy boy destroy snuffy snuffy you there

1236
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:33,450
oh god i have murdered a raccoon Oh, yeah, I got, I just got
my shit kicked in so bad.

1237
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:37,210
I can almost feel that actor's realism.

1238
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,990
He got his shit kicked in so bad, dude.

1239
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,250
That was, that was insane.

1240
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:43,830
That was an actual slobber knocker of a fight.

1241
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:46,470
Yo, Mr. Fuyo, did you ever feel like the match was in doubt?

1242
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:50,850
No, this is just a normal Saturday or Sunday.

1243
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,730
I can't get the days right, but sure can't land his punches.

1244
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,950
You gotta respect that, ladies and gentlemen.

1245
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:05,150
man on a Saturday because on a Sunday he's already so
unpleasant meet him on a Saturday you might not even leave

1246
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:12,730
to tell about it dang Fuyo man you put up a good fight it
looks like we settled the beef so uh snuffy are you gonna

1247
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:19,310
rescind all of your statements you made against Fuyo I
always knew Fuyo was gonna be my biggest hurdle in the fight

1248
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:24,810
and that's why I don't mind that I lost to them because I
feel like they're gonna go and win it all and it'll show

1249
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,790
that I was truly at least second

1250
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:39,650
all right those are acceptable standards that was a crazy
fight that was like 18 variations that people turned

1251
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:46,730
themselves into pancakes I mean like I'm talking I hop at
that point yeah that looked like a waffle house at 3 in the

1252
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:57,550
morning that was pretty insane we had the sort of energy and
stamina that I would like to say something normally in a

1253
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:04,630
rapid fight so It looks like Ursula stole our interviewer's
voice, and then hopefully she'll return it any second now.

1254
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:05,710
But, yeah.

1255
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,390
So, anyway, what I was thinking.

1256
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:09,290
I was mad at him!

1257
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:10,530
I was mad!

1258
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,790
Funo, man, please, before you go, please!

1259
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,090
I must ask!

1260
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:17,570
It's...

1261
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,310
What?

1262
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:19,750
It's a diaper med.

1263
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:20,890
I...

1264
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,770
Our first...

1265
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:22,770
Our first match.

1266
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:24,070
Ludo had a diaper in one.

1267
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:25,390
You had a diaper in one.

1268
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:26,250
What does this mean?

1269
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:26,810
Please.

1270
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:27,690
I must know.

1271
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,090
It's a fashion statement.

1272
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:30,110
It's...

1273
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:32,910
Bro said belt.

1274
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:39,870
They're reinventing the wrestling attire here by
mainstreaming the diaper.

1275
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:42,270
Do you plan on rocking this diaper if you win at all?

1276
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,030
What does that say about future wrestling?

1277
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,190
The diaper stays on during the match.

1278
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:48,470
Dang.

1279
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,370
The War of Warcraft classic drip.

1280
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:55,550
I mean, this person's aerodynamic and they are full of
utility.

1281
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:58,170
God, Sam.

1282
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:03,110
Snuffy, I must ask, was the person standing in for you?

1283
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:03,990
Did he shower?

1284
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,830
No, he never showered.

1285
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:11,310
When I went through the interview process, he was probably
the stinkiest of the bunch.

1286
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:16,850
I was hoping maybe if he didn't have, yeah, maybe if he
didn't have pure fighting skill, he might have just been

1287
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:21,710
able to fumigate Fuyo to the point where she would not be
able to enter the ring.

1288
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:25,670
It would be like a debuff, like a nuclear gas.

1289
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:34,450
on Fuyo and Fuyo, does, Fuyo man, would you like to explain
what I'm about to say?

1290
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:37,230
I believe the stench was matched.

1291
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:38,270
Yes.

1292
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,790
Wait, your stench maxing?

1293
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,930
Fuyo man only showers once a month.

1294
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:45,750
Of course.

1295
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:52,250
My stench didn't bother Fuyo at all because they matched it
even with something even stinkier.

1296
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:53,810
Discord mod sent.

1297
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,650
A diaper.

1298
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:55,750
A diaper?

1299
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:00,590
Well, I'm going to be honest.

1300
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:04,770
I think that was the best match of WrestleTuber 2024 yet.

1301
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:05,850
Oh, my God.

1302
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,790
I'm going to be honest.

1303
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,870
I think it was the best one.

1304
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:14,070
And I can't wait to see how far Fuyo Man goes.

1305
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,030
I believe in you, Fuyo Man.

1306
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,490
Let's go, Fuyo Man.

1307
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:17,870
Yeah!

1308
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:18,390
Non-bys.

1309
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:19,250
Let's go.

1310
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:20,290
Yay!

1311
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:20,790
Yay!

1312
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:24,770
And now I get my co-caster back.

1313
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:25,230
Da-ding.

1314
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:34,710

paid actor of course that was definitely not me getting my

1315
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:45,870

Good morning.

Miss Nana, are you ready to fight the Fuyo Man?

Oh yeah, let's go.

1328
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,950
I have a habit of crushing small things on the earth.

1329
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,090
You're calling Fuyo Man small?

1330
01:26:56,310 --> 01:27:01,470
Oh yeah, oh yeah, compared to the galaxy, all I see is a
tiny green snotty speck.

1331
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:02,770
Oh, Frigo.

1332
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:04,350
Fuyo man, destroy.

1333
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:09,130
Someone just catches Shrigger on Fuyo man.

1334
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:11,610
I mean, this is more accurate champ size right now.

1335
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:12,530
This is ridiculous.

1336
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,390
Fuyo man, big heart.

1337
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:19,950
Yes, Fuyo man, you're very, very big.

1338
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:22,970
Fuyo man is shrunk down to save their energy.

1339
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:23,710
Yes.

1340
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,030
I see, I see.

1341
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:28,090
I think, honestly, the biggest thing here is Fuyo man's ego.

1342
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,490
which I'm about to crush tonight.

1343
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:31,990
I think that's a good assumption.

1344
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:37,010
I think if Fuyu Man continues this match, by the time he's
done with his last match, he's going to doctor Manhattan

1345
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,410
fucking delete the next guy.

1346
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:42,310
So you need to put a stop to this, like a goddamn
supervillain.

1347
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,550
Leave it to me.

1348
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,530
Leave it to me.

1349
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:46,630
I have history.

1350
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:50,970
I have a complete resume of putting an end to many things,
including bloodlines.

1351
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:52,210
So watch out for you, man.

1352
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:57,910
I mean, speaking of superheroes, you guys are pretty much
the same size as Thanos and Ant-Man.

1353
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:00,150
And we all saw that thought we could end up.

1354
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,110
So any predictions today, chat?

1355
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:02,730
Let's see.

1356
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:06,050
Well, I think they're ready.

1357
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:10,270
The viewers are rooting for Nana today.

1358
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:11,390
Fuyo Man is closed.

1359
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:13,490
They want to see Fuyo Man win at all.

1360
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:16,270
But they also would like to see Nana bring in a win.

1361
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:16,870
It looks like.

1362
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:20,510
Fuyo Man, I have the ultimate question for you, Fuyo Man.

1363
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,890
New York or DC.

1364
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:24,350
Europe.

1365
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,250
It doesn't matter.

1366
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,090
Because...

1367
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:36,290
matter because i will be sending your dead leprechaun corpse
to the national museum anywhere okay okay i'll be that's

1368
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:43,110
where i'll be sending it oh my god he's gonna be a mask for
a man and dress just send her a coffin she's come to deal

1369
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:54,570
business oh yeah you will need all the leprechaun look for
that oh yeah you're talking up the luckiest person in the

1370
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:58,390
room right now that's pretty hard I'll take my chances.

1371
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:00,290
Win out of pure luck.

1372
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,230
She's got that manipulation going.

1373
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,130
She's got the plus 10 luck skill.

1374
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:05,950
That's a pretty insane logic.

1375
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:07,430
Anything can be your downfall.

1376
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,690
You might trip on a banana peel.

1377
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,070
Why is there one on the wrestling list?

1378
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:11,110
Luck, baby.

1379
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:14,510
Life is a gamble.

1380
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:15,310
Bring it on.

1381
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:20,810
I think that's the great attitude to bring it on.

1382
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:22,190
I would like to see this match.

1383
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:23,590
Fuyo versus Nana.

1384
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,030
Nana?

1385
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:25,290
This is going to be good.

1386
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,740
Wait, now you got me doubting.

1387
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,660
It's it's it's it's Nana, right?

1388
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,180
Or Nana?

1389
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,340
It's Nana.

1390
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,200
Nana.

1391
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,020
Thank you.

1392
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:36,420
Yeah, Nana.

1393
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,440
No, no, no.

1394
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:38,160
Oh, Nana.

1395
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,640
There is a banana on the stage.

1396
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,300
Oh, Nana.

1397
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,120
Nala, I've never heard that.

1398
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,340
Wait, can I not hear the.

1399
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:46,700
Okay.

1400
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,260
Oh, I was like, I like the fit.

1401
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,720
It's giving Rarity My Little Pony.

1402
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:52,640
Very amazing.

1403
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:53,460
Stop.

1404
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,500
That's literally what Juna told me.

1405
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,640
That's literally what Juna told me.

1406
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:57,160
I'm sorry.

1407
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:57,600
I'm sorry.

1408
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:14,360
all the way from the cosmos of australia you know them as
the vanquisher of dinosaurs it's the galaxy it's not give

1409
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:29,460

one of my favorite wrestling outfits I've yet to see.

1411
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,680
Oh my god, and she wastes no time getting straight into the
arena.

1412
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,640
Quang on all fours like a possessed animal.

1413
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,200
But this is not an animal.

1414
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,600
This is the grace of a goddess.

1415
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,420
She's displaying her absolute attitude and ownership of this
stage.

1416
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:53,020
She's saying, Fuyo, I want to see what you have to bring
because I own this place.

1417
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,680
There's at least 10 Discord moderators saying, please step
on me right now.

1418
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,320
I can tell.

1419
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,320
I'm one of them and I'm currently in her DMs.

1420
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:00,780
Interesting.

1421
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,280
Well, we're going to have to see it bar.

1422
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,500
He's mean.

1423
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,260
He's green.

1424
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,720
It's the diaper-wearing machine coming back.

1425
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,120
Fudaman!

1426
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:16,380
I just had shivers go down my spine.

1427
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,780
Yeah, the PTSD kicked in.

1428
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:19,980
I think...

1429
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:21,860
Oh, my God.

1430
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:22,900
The way he looks.

1431
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,100
I hate the way you look.

1432
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,360
The way you talk.

1433
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,460
This mean, green, killing machine has already shed some
blood today.

1434
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:40,320
will they be back to return that favor will they still have
the stamina to take another win will they show you guys why

1435
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:49,740
i died and it wasn't because i'm unskilled truly we're gonna
see why nana will put up a good fight i'm sure we might be

1436
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:56,040

tired he's yeah that's what i would say right like fuyo man

1439
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:19,640
straight to the fight i nana not gonna take it down an
instant lead on this nana is taking control of the situation

1440
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:29,240
she's lifting oh my god on that back what was insane a
little bit oh fuyo takes advantage of that sloppy landing

1441
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:33,640
nana might have gotten ahead of Is it going to be a close
line?

1442
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,600
No, it's a collision.

1443
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:38,080
Head-on, 40 miles an hour train versus 40 miles an hour
train.

1444
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,740
That's not taking control of the situation with an amazing
dead drop there.

1445
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,020
Oh, my God.

1446
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,920
And just mind-gaming the situation here.

1447
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:45,800
Whoa.

1448
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,560
She just pulled Fuyo's signature move on himself.

1449
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,260
She jumped over his head with a tea bag.

1450
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,860
I mean, that's a taste of his own medicine.

1451
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,480
Oh, but she's got him by the beard.

1452
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,220
Whoa, bringing Fuyo Man down to the ground.

1453
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:00,120
Oh, the Fuyo Man's got it with a straight kick.

1454
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,680
Kicks from the floor as well as beard grabbing.

1455
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:05,580
I mean, this fight is already off to an unkempt start.

1456
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:06,580
Fuyo.

1457
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,320
Oh, my God.

1458
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,740
Really showing those bar fights coming in handy here.

1459
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:11,840
Oh, my goodness.

1460
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,400
Going for the weak spots right on the elbow there.

1461
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,300
That's going to throw Nana in for a turn anytime they want
to set up some moves.

1462
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,280
Oh, Pup.

1463
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,600
I mean, Nana's kind of taking a beating early into this
fight.

1464
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:24,280
Oh, my goodness.

1465
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:24,540
Yeah.

1466
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,440
Fuyo Man is leading quite strongly into this match.

1467
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,280
Oh, yeah.

1468
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,940
But Nana is turning the moves back around in her favor.

1469
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:41,400
to her oh she's got the beard again leave the man's face
alone she's insane remove the flesh and bone go nana go do

1470
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:47,140
what your body is telling you remove the flesh oh sorry i
got a little caught up in the moment and she should have

1471
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:52,320
called him popo but i don't even think she needs that guy at
this point she is just delivering the smackdown on all

1472
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:59,740
levels right now oh but fuyo interjects with another low
blow i've elbow to the eyes there that's a little that's a

1473
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:05,580
little Oh my, Fuyo with another low blow.

1474
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:08,880
See, Fuyo is just interjecting with these quick little jabs.

1475
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:12,920
And Nana will turn it back around and be like, you know
what, this is what real skill looks like.

1476
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,380
Let's see if she can do it again.

1477
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:21,140
Oh, and see another situation where a trained professional
meets somebody who's only learned through backyard brawling.

1478
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:25,460
Yeah, I think Nana has a lot of, you know, openings in her
defenses.

1479
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,900
She keeps getting kicked in the head.

1480
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,420
She might have to look out for that weak spot.

1481
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,440
Nana has some professionalism.

1482
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,680
Oh, but that's the most powerful.

1483
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:40,880
like she's here for sure wait one oh fuyo man is not so
quick to give up as we've seen with our match fuyo man is a

1484
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:51,160
dedicated insane stamina god oh but you know i did realize
the reverse flying oh yo man took off the diaper for this

1485
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:57,640
match so could this be the loss is this loss i don't know
Oh, my.

1486
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,520
I mean, I think you're just taking her to abuse us.

1487
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,100
I've seen warheads slam into the sides of this ring than I
have my entire career so far.

1488
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,900
But she's getting picked back up, and she's stunned.

1489
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,200
What is happening?

1490
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,140
She's just dislocated Nana's arm kick bone.

1491
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:16,040
She's being sacrificed like Abraham's own son.

1492
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,200
Her neck is about to snap.

1493
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,820
Oh, it doesn't look like...

1494
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:19,500
Oh, she can hold her.

1495
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,760
Oh, she takes him off.

1496
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,320
They're both hurt from that move.

1497
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,840
Nana, turn it out around in her favor.

1498
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,160
A weak drop.

1499
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,400
She misses her kick there.

1500
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,200
I don't know if that's going to be...

1501
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:32,920
these wrestlers behaving like they're at least six drinks in
right now not even sure if they know who they're fighting

1502
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:41,720
anymore at this point oh my god not only burping him cannot
burping him like a baby boy let's see if nana can keep the

1503
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:51,100
lead oh but fuyo could turn it around what is this oh my god
she got him in the ham sandwich they turned into an ice

1504
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:56,820
cream sandwich for that maneuver again nana really does not
have good defense when she goes for grapples it's a common

1505
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:08,340
word what wait she's down just turned that around on her too

1507
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:29,840
reversal on one of the opponent's signature moves to take
them out he is a counter god he's i knew fuyo man was gonna

1508
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:36,480

would be ominous philian are you gonna step in here is it

1509
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:42,460

at this rate i'm kind of scared though i mean this guy might

1510
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:50,060
have a contract with phase clan because this dude can
counter strike for sure i i don't know i don't have that

1511
01:36:50,060 --> 01:37:04,060
okay but let's take him back to the casters or the
interviewers oh my god small but mighty and strong enough to

1512
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:12,980
take down a fucking galaxy nana what do you have to say you

1513
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:20,920
too mad because guess what who yo has to go against at least
three other people from my dead agency and so the will of

1514
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:29,540
the tragedy continues i may fall today but you will go
against all those who come after me good luck for your man i

1515
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:35,380
was literally invoking all nine members of the one for all
legacy right now i don't know what's going on the effing

1516
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:44,920
entire plan over your head what is on our head what is going
on ladies and gentlemen this man has jumped into her hair.

1517
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,480
Fuyo man, destroy.

1518
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:54,280
Fuyo man, are you ready to reenact a fucking Christmas carol
because you're about to ebonize or scrooge this company's

1519
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:54,900
last members.

1520
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,200
Are you ready to win it all?

1521
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:59,740
Are you going to fight the ghosts of VTuber past, present,
and future?

1522
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,620
I will learn her.

1523
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:03,600
I see.

1524
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,880
He has learned well.

1525
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,060
He has learned well.

1526
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,020
That was a victory with no diaper.

1527
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,560
I would like to put that out there too.

1528
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:17,760
Fuyo man did not wear his signature diaper that match, that
means that that wasn't even a fraction of his power.

1529
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,980
Kindness is cool, Pansu.

1530
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,320
Kindness is very cool.

1531
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,440
That is actually Fuyo Man's real underwear, by the way.

1532
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,240
It's true.

1533
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,420
Yes, I acknowledge your drip.

1534
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,200
Will you be selling it after this match, Fuyo Man?

1535
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,940
Only if money horrid.

1536
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,840
Get your licensed merch.

1537
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,680
I need an adult.

1538
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:45,760
Undies.

1539
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:49,800
You'll win every match you ever enter.

1540
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,400
I got a secret.

1541
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:53,460
Oh.

1542
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,720
Oh my affiliate is dead.

1543
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,380
We're so back.

1544
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:00,940
We're so back.

1545
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:01,620
We're so back.

1546
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,340
We'll come back.

1547
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:03,220
I'm back.

1548
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,560
One second.

1549
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,220
I'm not actually Thanos snapped the wrong person.

1550
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,220
Please.

1551
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,700
I have a right on God's greener to walk around.

1552
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,120
For your man, what are your next opponent?

1553
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:18,880
It's a bit scary.

1554
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:21,080
Are you ready to raid her dungeon?

1555
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:22,780
Yes.

1556
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,740
For your men raid.

1557
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,080
For your men destroy.

1558
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,260
Come on, Omia, Emma.

1559
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:31,400
You have to avenge me.

1560
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,020
You have to avenge me!

1561
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,080
For Prism and for Therulia!

1562
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:36,480
For all of us!

1563
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,860
Stop the leprechaun!

1564
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,180
Stop the Irish!

1565
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:40,500
End them!

1566
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,440
Stop the Irish end them!

1567
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,660
End quote.

1568
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,600
Let's fucking go, Fuyo, man.

1569
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,740
Your life ends 10 seconds from now.

1570
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:49,960
Let's see if that's true.

1571
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:51,960
My final message.

1572
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:55,100
All right.

1573
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,540
Well, we're going to go ahead and move Nana out of here.

1574
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,800
Thank you so much for competing.

1575
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:02,740
Thank you so much, Snuffy, Philly, and Doki, and Ryo and
Juno.

1576
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:03,760
Thank you so much.

1577
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,240
Bye-bye.

1578
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,300
Goodbye, Kola.

1579
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:06,560
Bye-bye.

1580
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,360
All right.

1581
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,040
And we're going to bring in our next competitor.

1582
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,740
Somehow, she looks even bigger right now than the other one.

on hiden climb to is not the only thing that can climb on

1590
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:42,080
those ropes in the match there's other things that fuyo man
has sealed it escalating yeah escalated the funny questions

1591
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:47,140
Wow, Fuyo man, you are so bold.

1592
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:48,740
I respect that.

1593
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,260
Emma, does Fuyo man feel good?

1594
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,260
Fuyo man feels very good.

1595
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,740
The three inches.

1596
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:02,420
Since you are so small, I'm going to smash you with like
really gentle, okay?

1597
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:05,560
So I'll make sure you don't cry and pee in your diapers.

1598
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,760
I'm feeling some weird tension already.

1599
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,160
Fuyo man.

1600
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:12,640
Okay, Fuyo man, we shall see about that.

1601
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,280
You're trying to like warm into submission before the match
even starts right now?

1602
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:20,680
Because it seems like the charm isn't working right now.

1603
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:25,020
Mind games is exactly what sends the mental for victory.

1604
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,880
Yeah, and this guy's a stronger mental game than Michael
Scott.

1605
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:29,660
I don't know.

1606
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:37,400
Mentally quiver and shake is exactly what you need to make
them waver their faulty strength and confidence.

1607
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,120
Make Fuyo Man doubt why he's on this stage.

1608
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,200
Make him doubt why he was ever in this career.

1609
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,780
Oh no, it's working.

1610
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:48,540
We're manipulating him.

1611
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,800
Fuyo Man, you always wanted to be a doctor.

1612
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,620
Remember what your mother said.

1613
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:55,960
What did that mean?

1614
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:56,600
Fuyo Man, doctor.

1615
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:58,990
Good gaslight.

1616
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:02,040
That's amazing.

1617
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:12,160
Well, Fuyo Man is about to perform an elaborate examination
on his opponent, Emma today.

1618
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:14,480
Amma, are you ready for your examination?

1619
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:16,760
I am super ready.

1620
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:19,400
He can inspect me whenever he wants.

1621
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,380
I see what he finds.

1622
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:22,940
Sounds like we should get to it.

1623
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:32,640
Ah, frick.

1624
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:33,560
All right.

1625
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:35,520
These two fighters are coming up.

1626
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:36,820
We're going to see how this goes.

1627
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:41,420
Dude, I feel like his opponent just keep getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

1628
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:42,660
First, do a snuffy.

1629
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,360
And she's like a normal size.

1630
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:52,240
of human right and then after that nana and now a little
like like i don't know how many more titans this guy can

1631
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:58,220
take down many different shapes and sizes you're barely
you're barely telling us to get above the casting fence

1632
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:14,940
winning back to back he's mean he's green you know him it's
for the third time this man comes out spinning in circles

1633
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:15,660
and hitting poses?

1634
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:16,740
Is he going to take a dump?

1635
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,540
And there it is.

1636
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:22,160
And now he's ready for combat.

1637
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,000
Oh my goodness.

1638
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,440
He makes the crowd quiver.

1639
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,260
Everybody's at unease.

1640
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:33,380
They don't know whether to root, cheer, cry, celebrate, text
their loved ones.

1641
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,660
They don't know what's going to happen.

1642
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:38,320
But Fuyo Man is going to make it freaking legendary.

1643
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:40,900
I just want to see what's under the hat at this point.

1644
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:41,840
I'm really curious.

1645
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,160
What's he got underneath there?

1646
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:44,320
The man.

1647
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:55,420
the myth, the legend, the leprechaun, Fuyo Man taking the
stage, showing off why he is now a two consecutive win

1648
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:58,560
winner, and perhaps maybe even three today.

1649
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:07,540
And returning all the way from her dungeon, it's your final
boss, but will it be Fuyo Man's final boss?

1650
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,700
It's a...

1651
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,290
Wow!

1652
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:16,770
And she comes out with Majestia's Frick.

1653
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:20,050
She looks like the final boss of an Elden Ring franchise
game.

1654
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,750
She is intimidating.

1655
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:25,670
Lady Royalty herself, Emma, about this show.

1656
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:28,490
What this doctor's appointment will diagnose us with.

1657
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,050
Absolute queenship here.

1658
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:31,910
Look at that form.

1659
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:33,330
Look at the professionalism.

1660
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:34,490
Look at the posture.

1661
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:36,730
This bitch is here to win.

1662
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:40,010
Her jewelry kind of looks like a collection of weapons.

1663
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:42,530
I don't know if she's going to be allowed to keep those on
during the fight.

1664
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:44,270
But, hey, I mean, they made custom.

1665
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:50,250
rules themselves so we'll see how this goes down oh she's
she's above getting on the ring herself you will you will

1666
01:45:50,250 --> 01:46:02,510
let her in you will be appropriate here you will let a lady
into the ring no one is dead all right slowly the crowd oh

1667
01:46:02,510 --> 01:46:09,130
my god she's working the crowd right now someone in the
crowd just passed out yes take her crown take her throne

1668
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:20,790
take care of it while she's away killing the fight begins
now Fuyo Man versus Emma Chad who are you rooting for who's

1669
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:30,490
gonna take it all the three-time Fuyo Man win or will Emma
upset the match let's find out oh I mean this inspection is

1670
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:36,390
his fist with her face but she kicks him in the nuts so she
knows a thing or two about anatomy also and she just slammed

1671
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:43,610
dogs up I think the fight's over never mind this man gets up
how is this possible Emma has been watching Fuyo Man's last

1672
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:48,090
match as she might be able to know how to mind game Fuyo Man
to a win here.

1673
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:49,530
She's studied his moves.

1674
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:50,750
She knows his routine.

1675
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,310
Oh, but that might not be enough.

1676
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:55,790
She's reversing the karma on her, disrespecting her in her
own game.

1677
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,750
Fuyo Man knows a thing or two about psychic damage himself.

1678
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:07,230
Fuyo Man is at the top of his game right now, and he's
showing why he is right now WrestleTuber 2024's prodigal

1679
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:07,530
son.

1680
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:10,110
I mean, yeah, this guy's on Fing CSI Man.

1681
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:11,670
He's most wanted right now.

1682
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:13,510
This dude...

1683
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:16,010
Oh my god.

1684
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:18,090
Oh my god.

1685
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:20,770
He just clipped her skull through three different layers of
rope.

1686
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:23,730
I mean, that's got to be some quantum physics involvement
right there.

1687
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:27,850
He almost just shattered the game devs fabrication of this
level.

1688
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:32,090
I was where the whole game was in a crouch, but this guy's
getting mounted and beat into a pub.

1689
01:47:32,350 --> 01:47:36,150
I mean, he's doing the Omniman versus Invincible in 40 years
speech right now.

1690
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:37,830
Jesus Christ.

1691
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:41,150
He's getting flipped over, stared at.

1692
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:43,650
I, okay, getting rid of like a piggy bank.

1693
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:44,530
No.

1694
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:46,910
Yana's starting it off strong.

1695
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,030
She's not even letting Fuyo Man have a chance here.

1696
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:52,490
Oh, but Fuyo Man is signature with the jabs.

1697
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:53,950
You know that's his trick move.

1698
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:57,250
Whenever someone gets on top, he finds a way to get out.

1699
01:47:57,290 --> 01:48:00,750
He knows, yeah, whether it's the knee, the foot, or the
elbow.

1700
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:02,130
He's always quick with the jabs.

1701
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:02,710
He counters.

1702
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:04,670
And now he's cranking the hog.

1703
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,490
Oh, my God.

1704
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:07,490
For the fans, that's for sure.

1705
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:10,470
And Nana's going to get back up and see if she can handle
this.

1706
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:11,250
I did this wrong.

1707
01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:12,370
He's getting pinned.

1708
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:14,110
My man got every scorpion.

1709
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:21,010
wasn't even close not even for a second i mean wrestling
this is looking more like a cuddle match at this point can

1710
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:27,150
we try a little bit more aggression oh my goodness stop
kissing in the bedroom and telling i want to see some

1711
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:35,310
bloodshed i want to see some bones breaking fuyo man destroy
the stands are back up puts her down he's going for the

1712
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:42,450
elbow shatter that's a really strong move it can break a
ligament i think i don't know yeah oh fuyo man aims to put

1713
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:49,570
every the count he does not want to see them at work
tomorrow he wants them to be calling off he knew she was

1714
01:48:49,570 --> 01:49:00,990
leaving the arena and he caught her out oh my god oh yo man
countering every move emma throws out that's insane oh my

1715
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:08,430
god of the stairs and she's back in the arena i think she's
hoping for a timeout foo yo man i mean there's only three

1716
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:15,510
seconds composure together okay seconds give me a little bit
of time to okay and there he goes yep Is composure fully

1717
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:18,990
filled now and instantly slamming her head into the ring?

1718
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:22,230
Oh, but Fuyo Man can't get ahead of himself.

1719
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:23,850
She's no setback.

1720
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:24,850
Let's go.

1721
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:25,790
Let's see.

1722
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:26,950
Oh, no.

1723
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,090
Oh, Fuyo Man.

1724
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:29,770
Always quick with the counter.

1725
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:32,730
Oh, my goodness.

1726
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:33,670
He's going to the crotch.

1727
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:34,650
And he's not letting her go.

1728
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,690
The crotch grab.

1729
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:37,110
The personal grip.

1730
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:37,970
5,000.

1731
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:39,350
Oh, my God.

1732
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:42,730
Donald Trump can take a page out of this one, but he's going
for the pin right now.

1733
01:49:42,730 --> 01:49:43,150
Phew!

1734
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,370
Another quick Fuyo!

1735
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:45,570
Oh my god.

1736
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:51,850
I thought he made quick business and jam out of her, just
like the last match, but no, Emma's gonna show us what she's

1737
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:52,830
made out of.

1738
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:54,130
Is he going over the tea bag?

1739
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:55,470
Oh no!

1740
01:49:56,090 --> 01:50:00,530
It could be jam and Fuyo man spreading it on his toast for
breakfast.

1741
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:02,390
I think she's dizzy.

1742
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:03,090
She's dazed.

1743
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,270
I don't know just how much...

1744
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:08,230
Oh my god, she's got abducted in reverse, and she's getting
picked up.

1745
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:09,130
Toss on the ground.

1746
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:10,590
This is gonna be a pin.

1747
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:11,790
No, it's gonna be a curbsaw maneuver.

1748
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:21,730
eyes across from with a soup man punch is that lights out
two oh my god she was the one second away from putting down

1749
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:33,210
fuyo's reign of terror and now she's staring at him like an
animal survivor i okay but he oh my god he's quivering he's

1750
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:38,950
shaking he's begging if this goes up for much longer you
might tap out but not quite the fight still goes on dude

1751
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:44,390
that could have been a serious timeout okay and she ran to
put her pits up to the nose, but Fuyo Man said he smelled

1752
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:44,970
worse.

1753
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:45,870
Oh my god.

1754
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:49,370
She just dropped her entire body weight on him, and she's
going to do it again.

1755
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:51,550
She said, take a whiff of this.

1756
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:53,130
Oh my woo.

1757
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:55,650
Oh, she didn't have a really good minimum.

1758
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:56,290
She spared him.

1759
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:56,650
She spared him.

1760
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:57,990
She's just skipping over him.

1761
01:50:58,630 --> 01:50:58,630
Okay.

1762
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:00,630
Oh, oh, oh my god.

1763
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:03,230
And Fuyo is showing why you don't skip.

1764
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:04,310
Oh my god.

1765
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:08,450
I feel like I'm watching a John Wick movie right now with
the amount of exchanges that are taking place right here.

1766
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:09,430
Oh my.

1767
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:10,350
Oh my god.

1768
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:11,070
What was that?

1769
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:13,750
She just did some sort of Tekken move on him.

1770
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:14,770
That was insane.

1771
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:16,350
Sun kick, I believe.

1772
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:17,910
I saw that one in Naruto.

1773
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:21,970
And this man climbs up on the poles just to get beaten down
by her even more.

1774
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:23,590
Just can he reverses her?

1775
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:26,790
It's about to snap her in half again like a Twinkie.

1776
01:51:27,290 --> 01:51:28,470
I, will you get the move all complete?

1777
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:30,150
He's not sure if he can get the footing here.

1778
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:31,630
Can he make it off?

1779
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:33,290
Nana's fighting back for sure.

1780
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:36,270
Oh my god, just tiring her out?

1781
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:37,210
What was that?

1782
01:51:37,610 --> 01:51:38,110
I don't know.

1783
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:39,930
Stretching her body like a masseuse?

1784
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:44,210
I mean, this dude's performing like a sumo wrestler right
now.

1785
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:47,390
Fuyo man is wanting Emma to beg for forgiveness.

1786
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:49,570
Oh, and he's not done yet.

1787
01:51:49,690 --> 01:51:51,750
He's about to oh no.

1788
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:53,210
Oh no.

1789
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:54,550
Oh no, the Fuyo signature.

1790
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:55,770
She's in a pin.

1791
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,570
One, two, Emma fight!

1792
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:00,070
Oh no, no, no.

1793
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:01,510
It could have ended right there.

1794
01:52:01,610 --> 01:52:02,510
That was so close.

1795
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,550
But Emma seems to be fleeing the arena again.

1796
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:07,410
She's pouring herself on the outside of the wires.

1797
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:09,490
If she gets punched, she could fall off.

1798
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,030
The reversal.

1799
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:22,810
counters i'm at his own game one could it be two no fuyo man
is not a quitter i mean every single count goes to at least

1800
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:27,650
two nowadays it's only gonna take one moment from the hit a
three count at this point both yeah they're both on the

1801
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:33,230
ropes here this is this is getting close literally oh wait
that's the whole point of the thing but they're gonna go in

1802
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:39,270
and snap his ankle i don't even know what happened i think
like he is feeling it emma has definitely done some damage

1803
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:43,470
here i think he might have crippled him oh my goodness.

1804
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:47,950
Oh, she shoots high on the head kick, but apparently it was
so intimidating.

1805
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:49,510
Fuyo's falls over anyway.

1806
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,910
I believe in Emma.

1807
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:56,050
She's got some fierce kicks, and those shoes don't look
comfortable to get hit by.

1808
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:57,550
She's grabbing Fuyo Man.

1809
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:58,390
This could be it.

1810
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,310
Fuyo Man cannot counter this.

1811
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:01,930
There's no cheap shots here.

1812
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:04,290
Oh, and she's making it so.

1813
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:06,890
Emma knows now what Fuyo Man's game is.

1814
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,930
She knows how to win.

1815
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:12,570
She knows not to give Fuyo the upper hand by getting a
counter option here.

1816
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:18,790
here let's see if she can win it here the chiropractic
spinal repair just came out of her now she's doing another

1817
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:26,970
chiropractic i mean this guy's getting adjusted from the
inside out somebody get fuyo man's physician on the phone oh

1818
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:33,910
and he's still in the match holy moly and now fuyo man's
running for his own life it might be his turn to flee out of

1819
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:42,950
the arena for once but i mean he gets a good hit on emma
flips her over oh my god i saw bread i saw blood I think

1820
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:44,070
this might be it, ladies and gentlemen.

1821
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:44,970
Emma, might be on.

1822
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:47,390
One, two, three.

1823
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,030
Three.

1824
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:52,190
Fuyo Man wins three times in a row.

1825
01:53:54,630 --> 01:53:57,990
Fuyo Man cannot be stopped.

1826
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:03,070
Back to, back to, back your winner.

1827
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:11,650
Kindness is cool.

1828
01:54:11,850 --> 01:54:12,570
I think Fuyo.

1829
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:15,670
Man is a great leader to take this match.

1830
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:18,930
Buoyo Man making insane waves here right now.

1831
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:22,250
Three back-to-back-to-back sweeps here.

1832
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:26,610
Buoyo Man is on fire and does not look like they're letting
up at any point.

1833
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:28,070
Who can stop Buoyo Man?

1834
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:29,550
Who can take the win?

1835
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:32,690
Yeah, I mean, some people out there, they say Ronaldo's a
goat.

1836
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:33,910
Some people say Messi.

1837
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:36,070
But to me, Buoyo's my goat.

1838
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:37,510
I'm not going to lie.

1839
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:40,170
I mean, this man has been on an absolute rampage.

1840
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:41,770
He's just torn through three people.

1841
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:42,490
I don't know.

1842
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:49,850
faster than like geez an effing born a china shop i mean
this man is a force of nature uh let's bring it back over i

1843
01:54:49,850 --> 01:55:02,010

down for your man sweep holy shit how are you feeling after

1844
01:55:02,010 --> 01:55:09,390
that match no way this can't be i lost to a little guy

1845
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:20,970
I wasn't supposed to be this easily defeated but he's too
powerful maybe because he's too green I can never defeat a

1846
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:30,510
green guy he's like a Hulk to me that's it dungeon red is
close no one can come in anymore I'm gonna go take my rest

1847
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:37,490

enjoy the nature but I'm gonna be afraid of green no I'm

horrible man your response kindness is cool green is cool

1849
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:59,890
soil men destroy i must say emma how did it feel having this
tiny little three inch here all over you a what a little

01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:10,650
than your next julio is more sanitized than dwayne the rock
johnson and he's winning just as much this is crazy emma

1851
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:17,590

match a win next time don't worry fuyu man is a legend

1852
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:27,970

wrestle tuber 24 whoa vegetables are horrible just like fuyu

month for a year for the decades fuyo man is banned in my

the first finalists for the wrestle tuber a normal sunday oh

1856
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:18,090
wow i i love that confidence I guess Emma loves a man with
confidence.

1857
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:19,950
No wonder she folded.

1858
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:21,890
He is very confident.

1859
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:23,850
Even though it's the exercise.

1860
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:30,130
Alright, well, uh...

1861
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,790
Wait, so what do we have coming up next?

1862
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:33,030
Are we, um, snuffing?

1863
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:33,390
Do we know?

1864
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:38,630
It looks like our next match, I think, is with...

1865
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:39,970
Is this Luto again?

1866
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:41,770
Luto running it back?

1867
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:45,690
I'm not sure who his opponent is today.

1868
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:46,150
Let me see.

1869
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:46,610
Let me check.

1870
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:47,870
Let me check the broadcast.

1871
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:52,150
We're getting word that it is Luto versus Anan.

1872
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:55,350
Anananananananan.

1873
01:57:55,490 --> 01:57:55,570
Anan.

1874
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:56,490
Who's Anan?

1875
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:57,510
Anan.

1876
01:57:57,950 --> 01:57:58,390
Anan.

1877
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:02,030
They look mighty saucy, though.

1878
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:03,170
This is going to be a good match.

1879
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:09,130
Fuyo Man finally getting a well-deserved rest after a three
back-to-back win here.

1880
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:18,150
We might see more wins from Fuyo Man, but for now, we're
starting it up with a different match today we have luto

1881
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:26,030

I cannot fucking lose you!

1892
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:48,570
I'm trying to spirit bomb right now.

1893
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:51,670
I mean, God, power of animated China on her side.

1894
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:56,330
I better see you beat me hard than Luto.

1895
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:57,550
If you dare.

1896
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:01,350
I'm gonna sit on you with my stinky diaper and you ain't
gonna save!

1897
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:02,590
Do it!

1898
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:03,850
I dare you!

1899
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:04,410
Do it!

1900
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:06,610
And also trust me while you're at it!

1901
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:07,310
Okay!

1902
02:00:08,190 --> 02:00:09,090
Fuck yeah!

1903
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,930
I know, that was so bad.

1904
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:13,730
Oh, good.

1905
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:16,030
You guys are all diaper abusers.

1906
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:18,970
This might be a fight to remember, Chad.

1907
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:21,230
Our talent here, they are fierce.

1908
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:26,490
They are fire and they are ripping each other apart in the
backstage right now.

1909
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:28,610
What will that say about the match?

1910
02:00:28,910 --> 02:00:29,890
Oh, I'm excited.

1911
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:31,330
How are you?

1912
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:34,850
Dude, I want to see how they murder each other.

1913
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:39,090
I will murder her right with my ass.

1914
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:40,470
Oh, yes.

1915
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:40,770
Oh, yes.

1916
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:42,930
Wait, can you bring in a weapon too?

1917
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:46,570
I'm not condoning any of that.

1918
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:46,990
Yeah.

1919
02:00:47,630 --> 02:00:48,490
I have my tail.

1920
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:49,550
Is that good enough?

1921
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:50,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1922
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:51,430
Hit me with that too.

1923
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:52,050
Hit me with that too.

1924
02:00:52,210 --> 02:00:53,130
All right, okay, I got you.

1925
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:53,910
I got you, remember.

1926
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:55,410
Oh, thank you.

1927
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:57,150
I mean, no thank you.

1928
02:00:57,450 --> 02:00:58,790
That's gonna be awful.

1929
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:00,350
Absolutely.

1930
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:02,110
I wouldn't want that.

1931
02:01:02,430 --> 02:01:06,650
I also don't want to hold hands of you in bed and gloveless.

1932
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:09,450
We're going to change the title of this stream.

1933
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:11,230
X.

1934
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:12,610
All right, all right.

1935
02:01:12,830 --> 02:01:13,810
Oh, I can do that.

1936
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:17,750
I thank the gamers for sponsoring today's stream.

1937
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:22,070
Make sure to use code Snacker to 10% off at the discount

1938
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:23,050
Whoa.

1939
02:01:23,690 --> 02:01:24,290
What?

1940
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,870
Let's get to the fight.

1941
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:27,890
Let's go.

1942
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:37,390
All right, Snuffy.

1943
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:39,150
Here it is.

1944
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:40,110
Here it is.

1945
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:40,410
All right, Snuffy.

1946
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:40,850
Here it is.

1947
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:43,090
Crash says dummy versus the thing.

1948
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:47,290
I'm not even sure who's going to win at this point.

1949
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:48,810
I could not tell you which one is which.

1950
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:50,230
Now let's see him kill each other.

1951
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:51,130
True.

1952
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:56,730
I believe none is going to be the one with the bunny ears,
but let's see it.

1953
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:03,270
In this corner, it's the diaper from hell.

1954
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:06,410
The spawn of the demon lord himself.

1955
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:08,930
The crimson devil.

1956
02:02:13,690 --> 02:02:14,570
It's Luto!

1957
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:19,110
Absolutely extravagant.

1958
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:22,310
This guy's just Fuyo born on a whole different level of
Zesty.

1959
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:25,770
I mean, this person's coming in for the effing crown.

1960
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:29,450
It looks like they got their horns from a CSGO loot crate.

1961
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:32,470
I mean, there's a lot of effing bling bling on this bad boy.

1962
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:36,310
You know, I almost want to see it.

1963
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:40,250
I feel like somebody, this is somebody who truly rivals Fuyo
Man's energy.

1964
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:44,690
If anybody was to bring Fuyo Man a decent match, it could be
Luto.

1965
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:48,090
Luto might be able to match the swagger of Fuyo Man.

1966
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:52,630
But we will see if Luto has what it takes to win it all and
see him in the ring.

1967
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:58,610
Or will Luto collapse and we'll see another hero rise to the
occasion in the form of Nyan.

1968
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:02,390
Why is Luto wearing a coffee filter around her neck?

1969
02:03:03,370 --> 02:03:08,310
I believe that's an old Victorian tissue for sneezing into.

1970
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:08,690
See?

1971
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:10,830
He just did a really epic stretch.

1972
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:18,490
strategy just like and then you just look upwards and it
just absorbs the entire radius of the so they can wipe the

1973
02:03:18,490 --> 02:03:25,530
blood off on it it's similar to the diaper yeah it's
basically luto is going for a full versatile equipment

1974
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:46,580
standard here and making their way to the stage all the way
from Wonderland hopping into the ring it's no no no no dang

1975
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:55,360
I don't know what's going on but this is like a nothing you
Chihawk clan member the outfit not giving us a bit of sauce

1976
02:03:55,360 --> 02:04:04,200
here I like the face on the ass very iconic she said I know
where you're looking and meet my gaze oh yeah we're making

1977
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:15,140
not entering the ring my grandma she probably smells like
her too i imagined at least like death now oh a little bit

1978
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:20,340
of sauce not is looking pretty confident coming into this
fight i'd like to see her stir it up she's got one win under

1979
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:27,440
her belt so this is not new to her i do like the purple gas
that's everywhere it makes a little bit more mysterious and

1980
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:36,960
maybe even smells like peppermint but we'll see whoa she
might be a rabbit but she's behaving rather cash Okay.

1981
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,680
Let's see how this is vital.

1982
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:42,620
I don't know what to respond.

1983
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,220
Wait.

1984
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,320
Let's get it started.

1985
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,760
You see that chunk?

1986
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,280
The diaper is back on.

1987
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,280
It is.

1988
02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:01,200
I mean, these people kind of look like Five Nights at
Freddy's characters, but they are already delivering the

1989
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,480
animatronic beatdown.

1990
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,500
Oh my god.

1991
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:13,560
a walmart children's bicycle but she is delivering like a
semi truck absolutely and i i thought like at the first like

1992
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:18,980
non was gonna be in serious danger because of the size
difference but i mean no one knows her angles and she's

1993
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:24,300
already doing some big damage on ludo's extremities i mean
she might take down her weak point one by one like johnny

1994
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:32,440
apple c cutting down a tree oh my god it's a brains over
brawn type situation here i think philly and oh my gosh not

1995
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:42,300
might be smaller speed and swiftness with this skill oh my
goodness she's already got him wrapped up in two oh there's

1996
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:48,760
no way two guys this way would have been insane but ludo's
already fleeing the arena and non wants none of it this

1997
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:57,140
person will stop at the end of the earth and kill you a
little front whip oh i think her face is caved in i don't

1998
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:05,540
know ludo does have the diaper so if she shits the bed early
it is going to be able to save her that could be the play i

1999
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:14,100
guess we'll have to see and not is taunting at the crowd oh
my god she got his feeling confident and she got the hordes

2000
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:20,860
she played with the bull and she got the hordes having to
stare down the century not disrespectfully gets back into

2001
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:28,080
the arena right in front of luto doesn't give a single freak
in the world alpha giga chat energy coming out of her and

2002
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:37,240
we're going up on a tuesday not is keeping the segue of this
fight strong in your favor oh and i say that right as she

2003
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:48,060
loses her cool the rock star split slam oh my god ludo going
for oh how many ads can they take up beating this much like

2004
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:58,320
ludo is treating non like a game of hopscotch oh my oh she
won't just stop fucking jumping i mean she does know her

2005
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:04,480
weight is her greatest asset it looks like in this fight Oh,
and Nod is getting the actual beat down put on her.

2006
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:10,240
Underneath, over the top, picked up, and slammed.

2007
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:15,900
It's just a break of her ankle falling down on top of her.

2008
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:18,280
Oh, my God.

2009
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:19,220
Flip comes out of nowhere.

2010
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:19,980
Stoke into the pin.

2011
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,740
Steam into a swift.

2012
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:22,260
Oh.

2013
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:24,880
I mean, Nod might be indestructible.

2014
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:26,260
They're small and dense.

2015
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:27,600
It's like an effing black hole.

2016
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:30,600
I assume that that gets us the second count.

2017
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:32,840
She's still raring and ready to go.

2018
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:36,640
Let's see what she has to show right into the crowd.

2019
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,760
Oh, and a little bit of fan service for the people.

2020
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:42,780
The guy that got a full head of hair there.

2021
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:43,920
Oh, my God.

2022
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:45,640
Maybe even a kiss.

2023
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:50,620
Oh, and some blood on your pants.

2024
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:52,960
Oh, my God.

2025
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,580
The Joker flip on the ankle.

2026
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:55,560
That was kind of insane.

2027
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,440
But it looks like that was a reversal exactly that Ludo
needed.

2028
02:07:58,700 --> 02:07:59,100
Just kidding.

2029
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,220
Just kidding.

2030
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:03,460
These two are getting dirty with it.

2031
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:05,820
I've never seen the maneuver in my life.

2032
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:08,320
This man's being folded in 18 different directions.

2033
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,720
I'm like watching human origami right now.

2034
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:13,100
She's got her strangled right now.

2035
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:13,880
Absolutely.

2036
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,280
But she's plunger in those veins.

2037
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:16,520
Oh, she's got her in the eyes.

2038
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:20,840
We're at six seconds because she's getting back in there.

2039
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:24,180
Every possible resource to stay alive this match.

2040
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:25,120
It could be over.

2041
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:29,260
Oh, and Ludo is getting high off the crowd's energy.

2042
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:30,480
Let's go.

2043
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:31,040
Oh,

2044
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,920
and the energy is fueling Luto like a battery.

2045
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:41,600
She's like a vampire sapping after the energy.

2046
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:43,160
The crowd is fueling her.

2047
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:44,720
Chat is going crazy.

2048
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,660
The whispers.

2049
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:46,720
I think Nona's dead.

2050
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,140
Nona's dead.

2051
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,140
I think Nona's just dead.

2052
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,800
Some brain activity, signs of life.

2053
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,120
Luto's coming down to finish the fight, I guess.

2054
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:58,840
Oh, oh, Jesus.

2055
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:00,140
She's not down yet.

2056
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:01,900
She just needed a minute.

2057
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:04,160
Wait, Luta's on the...

2058
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:06,960
Begging for Luta was a fool to give her the time.

2059
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:07,920
True.

2060
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:12,080
Are we going to the stands?

2061
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:12,660
No, we're not.

2062
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:14,300
You have been cast or desk right there?

2063
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:15,220
That's you and me, Snoppy.

2064
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,180
You see us over there?

2065
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:17,400
Yeah.

2066
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,100
But it looks like they're not going to be visiting us today.

2067
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:22,060
Unfortunate.

2068
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:23,900
Still stairs could be...

2069
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:24,440
Oh, my God.

2070
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,000
We do have a fine table for you.

2071
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,440
Oh, and she's got her by the hair.

2072
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:29,680
Oh, my God.

2073
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:38,020
is absolutely killing her i'm watching killer instinct
unfold in real time what's happening she's getting abducted

2074
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:45,380
back into the arena oh my god non said i'm not done yet i
don't want this match to end i still have something to show

2075
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:55,860
said you don't want none of this a murder slam in the face
down i he's just staring at her again did they just high

2076
02:09:55,860 --> 02:10:01,580
five each other okay oh my god oh counter punches.

2077
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,320
Nod's taking two, three, and she's out.

2078
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:09,280
Oh, my God, and it's non-stop.

2079
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:13,240
She looks like she can't drop and thunder.

2080
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:15,200
She's just jumping on the back and shaking her.

2081
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:17,080
But she's still going.

2082
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:20,480
The arm bar, the arm bar?

2083
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,500
I don't really know what that maneuver was very effective.

2084
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,560
You can't just held on her fingers.

2085
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:26,060
And the screen has gone black.

2086
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:28,960
And Lucho has... What just happened?

2087
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:29,620
No!

2088
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:32,920
The turner Was that a technical foul?

2089
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:34,060
They reset back to neutral?

2090
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,120
Jesus, what just happened?

2091
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:40,920
Lucho just mind-wiped the entire crowd and reset the match.

2092
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,020
No way!

2093
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:44,500
Devil mind tricks.

2094
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:45,460
True.

2095
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:50,800
The whole person is a really effective ability, as it turns
out.

2096
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,580
I think Na might be out.

2097
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:53,320
This could be it.

2098
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:55,500
Na doesn't even know where she is anymore.

2099
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:56,720
Oh, no!

2100
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:57,800
This could be the finisher!

2101
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:58,520
Oh!

2102
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:01,460
What is hell out?

2103
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:12,000
not allowed for that this is like probably flying and we're
back to playing hopscotch with her oh my god using her body

2104
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:20,960
like gravel oh i don't know if not gets up from this one non
is not looking good i believe i'm seeing a little bit of

2105
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:31,700
blood here even this this is a gruesome one oh my goodness
it's a slaughter luto is not letting up it's not okay no in

2106
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:47,520
the window to loot oh holy moly the diaper meta is real your
winner is loot oh

2107
02:11:54,260 --> 02:12:02,760

ready for this junk snuffy did you the diaper meta to really

2109
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:19,740
make it to the finals twice wait no it's just one match from
the finals right i almost there i'm surprised you know i i

2110
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:25,680
guess i would say i was hoping for a little bit more of an
upset here the last couple matches have seemed pretty set in

2111
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:33,920
stone but i'm excited i think i think nothing is more hype
than to see two strong components combine each other into

2112
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:41,280
one epic fight battle well what's here for luto and non
what's up guys how's that fight looking die for murder

2113
02:12:46,990 --> 02:12:55,210
non how does it feel to not just get beat up by one of your
co-workers but two of them let's just say i came for the

2114
02:12:55,210 --> 02:13:08,470
match and i came from the match oh it was great i feel like
i just lost something well i must say luto you you've been

tall tree to cut down i mean this man has been unstoppable

2117
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:35,610
exactly three different we need to get this do you have do
you have any plans on taking down fuyo man luto i think i

2118
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:38,530
think whoever is think he gets to take it home right so

2119
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:44,810
Oh, that's classified information.

2120
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:46,250
I can't give you that for free.

2121
02:13:48,370 --> 02:13:49,850
Well, you heard it here, folks.

2122
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:53,970
Luto is indeed horrendously stinky.

2123
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:58,630
I'm covered in benchling.

2124
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:00,490
I can't lose these.

2125
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:03,750
All right.

2126
02:14:03,950 --> 02:14:06,510
Well, I'm still in the fight, too, so don't forget that.

2127
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:08,570
It's going to be me versus two diapers, I feel like.

2128
02:14:08,690 --> 02:14:10,730
And maybe someone else, I don't quite remember.

2129
02:14:11,450 --> 02:14:21,390
sell clothes bins with our final match tickets with how
stinky our wrestlers are my goodness well uh any further

2130
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:26,890
words snuffy before we send it back over to the main desk i
think that's everything that was an amazing match by you two

2131
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:35,290
what insane skill thank you both luto and non for an amazing
fight let's take it back to the main desk thanks okay thank

was gonna go wait who were you rooting for wow guys that was

2133
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:57,410
an insane fight you know i realized when uh fuyo man was
actually not supposed to do a third fight in a row because i

2134
02:14:57,410 --> 02:15:05,650
missed up the order but like at this point fuyo man deserves
that buy in the final bracket because we were supposed to

2135
02:15:05,650 --> 02:15:12,410
send emma and fuyo man to the final bracket but you know
fucking row.

2136
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:14,630
Fuyo Man deserves to buy.

2137
02:15:14,810 --> 02:15:17,990
I did not expect Fuyo Man to travel this far.

2138
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:30,130
So, now that I believe we finished all our brackets, let me
bring the brackets up onto the screen for all of you guys,

2139
02:15:30,430 --> 02:15:33,250
so you guys see what has happened.

2140
02:15:33,670 --> 02:15:37,890
So, as you guys know, oh, I got some fancy graphics going in
for all of you.

2141
02:15:39,290 --> 02:15:51,450
Alright, so we have uh wait saiyu did not win so let me get
rid of saiyu's card all right luto proceeds here and she

2142
02:15:51,450 --> 02:16:00,870
does the teleports behind you undertaker special so i guess
she travels all the way with phillian in bracket i know it

2143
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:07,990
says phillian versus luto but if you guys didn't remember
everyone that makes it to the finals here in their bracket

2144
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:16,970
actually gets reshuffled so I cannot be bothered to realign
this, but if you guys didn't know, like, Philean Luto might

2145
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:18,010
not even face each other.

2146
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:19,990
We are going to be spinning a wheel.

2147
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:26,450
We are going to spin a wheel to decide who exactly they're
going to be fighting in the end.

2148
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:31,750
So we have Philean Luto making it in to the final brackets.

2149
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:33,810
We don't know who they're going to fight, though, yet.

2150
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:35,110
We're not sure yet.

2151
02:16:35,390 --> 02:16:37,610
So that is the results for bracket two.

2152
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:39,010
Bracket one.

2153
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:49,450
Fuyo man ends up getting the buy Who to send my finals
Because I made a mistake

2154
02:16:55,310 --> 02:17:04,730
So let me grab put in Let me put in the bracket number one
for you guys for the visual So as you guys know we have Fuyo

2155
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:16,070
Beating Nana and also beating Emma So Fuyo man automatically
gets the buy to the semi-finals because I made a mistake and

2156
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:26,150
at that point Fuyo Man won three times in a row and they
deserve that win if you win three in a row you might as well

2157
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:35,730
get into the semis automatically so whoever wins their last
the next match in the final bracket will be facing Fuyo Man

2158
02:17:35,730 --> 02:17:39,830
finally um okay also for those who need a visual.

2159
02:17:40,470 --> 02:17:40,470
Bam.

2160
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:41,570
Here she is.

2161
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:42,730
Here's Fuyo.

2162
02:17:43,130 --> 02:17:46,350
So you guys can see it in the visual alone to see how it
goes.

2163
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:47,790
And there she goes.

2164
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:51,110
And then we might as well just put her over Emma because she
beat Emma.

2165
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:55,010
So we know only one person is advancing in bracket one.

2166
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:56,930
Finally in bracket three.

2167
02:17:57,450 --> 02:18:02,570
We didn't have any matches in bracket three because we
actually finished bracket three on day one.

2168
02:18:02,810 --> 02:18:08,170
But we'll show you guys who they are who made it into the
final bracket.

2169
02:18:08,690 --> 02:18:19,230
Let me pull up bracket three boom and then get rid of foo
real quick it is sarah and betta so sarah and betta are

2170
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:28,030
going to be heading over to the final bracket and finally so
how are we going to decide this like we said um we will be

2171
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:38,250
spinning a wheel uh of names of all the people that made it
to the final bracket and i do have somebody here as i

2172
02:18:38,250 --> 02:18:45,810

2173
02:18:45,810 --> 02:18:51,950

2174
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:58,030

Well then I am kind of lost.

2177

Well then.

2178
02:19:06,330 --> 02:19:08,850
Just like a real goat.

2179

Am I good?

2180
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:14,050

Where do I go?

2182
02:19:20,910 --> 02:19:23,430
She sneaked her way in.

02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:25,550
What are you watching?

2184
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:26,350

2186
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:26,910
She sneaked her way in.

2191
02:19:57,510 --> 02:20:07,010

our little wheel here i haven't wrote anybody's names yet on

2192
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:14,050
the wheel um so give me a sec as i put you know give me a
sec give tell me some of your favorite moments man while i

2193
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:26,510

also have eating my spaghetti so um let's see uh what

2194
02:20:26,510 --> 02:20:38,910
happened oh gosh you just talk about real mad if you want to
i'm completely prepared as a caster thank you um i've heard

2195
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:45,330
a lot that there's a bunch of diapers going on oh that's
true that's true did you plan that doki oh why why would you

2196
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:49,170
say that like what was me about me and diapers I don't know.

2197
02:20:49,290 --> 02:20:56,910
I just feel like just like this vibe from you.

2198
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:57,230
I don't know.

2199
02:20:57,550 --> 02:20:58,510
This diaper vibe?

2200
02:20:59,190 --> 02:21:04,270
I don't know.

2201
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:06,930
Yeah, so there's a bunch of diapers going.

2202
02:21:06,990 --> 02:21:08,130
I think, what is it?

2203
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:10,430
Phyllian's going against some diaper people.

2204
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:11,570
Well, we don't know yet.

2205
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:13,470
She might not be, though, from the wheel.

2206
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:14,010
Oh, true.

2207
02:21:14,130 --> 02:21:14,510
The wheel.

2208
02:21:14,750 --> 02:21:17,190
Yeah, the wheel decides who they're fighting.

2209
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:18,650
Am I missing a person?

2210
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:28,310
I think this it could count as the wheel of the worst the
wheel here we go it's time to spin that wheel oh yeah yeah

2211
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:34,970
when we really only need to spin it twice to be fair because
like we got the automatic buy but all right here we go

2212
02:21:34,970 --> 02:21:43,410
spinning that wheel we going against flio no it's who's
going no feel gets the buy in the semi-finals so it's gonna

2213
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:49,790
be luto who is luto gonna fight We're gonna find out All
right, who is Ludo?

2214
02:21:50,130 --> 02:22:05,450
Ludo's either gonna fight Phileon, Betel, or Sarah Ludo and
Betel will be our first match in the finals bracket Which

2215
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:13,130
means Phileon will be fighting Sarah in the next fight Okay,
she avoided the diapers.

2216
02:22:13,470 --> 02:22:23,170
Yeah, she avoided yeah but whoever oh that's true that's
true because like whoever wins the betel versus luto will

2217
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:32,830
have to fight fuyo man so like so that there won't be two
diapers fighting each other in the finals oh man yeah so so

2218
02:22:32,830 --> 02:22:40,670
uh yeah and then like um and then i guess like wait let's
pull out the let's pull out the brackets here so we can

2219
02:22:40,670 --> 02:22:47,410
order this up let me pull it out where is my image here i'm
Very professional.

2220
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:48,110
You always are.

2221
02:22:48,190 --> 02:22:48,770
I mean, I know.

2222
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:49,130

2223
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:52,830

2224
02:22:54,170 --> 02:22:55,070
I mean, of course.

2225
02:22:56,030 --> 02:22:56,430
Yeah.

2226
02:22:56,810 --> 02:23:01,290
So, Sarah will be, okay, this will be where Fuyo got the
automatic buy.

2227
02:23:01,970 --> 02:23:04,590
And then Sarah and Philean are down here.

2228
02:23:05,330 --> 02:23:07,030
And you see this, right?

2229
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:09,010
Yeah, I'm watching your stream.

2230
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:11,070
It's a little delayed.

2231
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:11,790
There's a little delay.

2232
02:23:11,890 --> 02:23:12,050
Okay.

2233
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:13,470
And then there's Luto here.

2234
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:15,210
Luto is going to be fighting.

2235
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:18,170
Beto down here.

2236
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:23,290
And then Fuyo gets to automatically advance.

2237
02:23:23,770 --> 02:23:28,270
So Fuyo will be fighting whoever wins in the Luto versus
Beto.

2238
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:31,710
And then Sarah will be fighting Phillion.

2239
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:33,610
Yes.

2240
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:34,010
Alright.

2241
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:35,130
Okay.

2242
02:23:35,270 --> 02:23:37,390
But we do have a problem, Mint.

2243
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:39,510
We do have a little problem here.

2244
02:23:39,710 --> 02:23:40,350
What's that?

2245
02:23:40,450 --> 02:23:40,730
What's that?

2246
02:23:40,750 --> 02:23:45,190
Is that we are sort of missing two fighters at the bottom.

2247
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:55,290
what oh yeah i think i did it yeah i did like a little
miscalculation mint oh okay wow that's so i'm brand free she

can't she can't count you guys yeah yeah yeah okay look i
mean i was i'm gonna say like you were you fucking like

2249
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:15,330
broke into the arena out of nowhere and even though i had a
security you killed off all our security guards like Like,

2250
02:24:15,490 --> 02:24:16,310
what was I supposed to do?

2251
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:18,850
I'd spend the night hiring a new security guard.

2252
02:24:19,330 --> 02:24:20,530
Fuck your face, bro.

2253
02:24:20,770 --> 02:24:21,750
You're a ghost.

2254
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:26,050
I know, I just, like, you know, they were looking at me the
wrong way.

2255
02:24:26,210 --> 02:24:27,830
I don't know what to tell you.

2256
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:36,830
Well, it's a good thing I hired a new security guard to
tighten up the security.

2257
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:37,870
You wanna meet him?

2258
02:24:38,470 --> 02:24:39,150

Doki!

2273
02:25:36,990 --> 02:25:38,570
What did she mean by that?

2274
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:41,030
I'm gonna eat me or I'm gonna eat you?

2275
02:25:41,210 --> 02:25:42,190
What did she mean by that?

2276
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:47,090
I don't know, what does she mean by that?

2277
02:25:50,690 --> 02:25:52,130
What did you do?

2278
02:25:53,310 --> 02:25:54,970
What didn't I do?

2279
02:25:56,590 --> 02:26:07,210
Did you you did you bring her over here why is she trying
why is she trying to kill all the security guys i might have

2280
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:15,110
told her that we were like having a coup you know like that
we were that i was just like hey wouldn't it be cool if we

2281
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:22,210
like you know did our podcast from from the wrestling
stadium but this one was it was already kind of taken you

2282
02:26:22,210 --> 02:26:31,650
know but we had well i guess we Another match to make up the
brackets then.

2283
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:35,870
The podcast Battle of the Century.

2284
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:38,370
Mint versus Matara.

2285
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:44,110
What's funny is that, like, she's not actually here, here at
the moment.

2286
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:50,050
No, she, she, like, said, hey, I'm going to go on vacation,
but I'm still going to kick your ass.

2287
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:55,990
So she said, she said a, like, a spiritual form of her.

2288
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:57,910
So to kick Mint's ass.

2289
02:26:57,930 --> 02:27:09,770
ass and she still killed my security guard so she did it up
yeah she did all that she needed to do yeah like she so

2290
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:19,250
unfortunately unfortunately um now there's no more security
left in wrestle tuber so but we don't have any crashes after

come on no do not come on in everyone do not come on The

2292
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:29,490
door is wide open.

2293
02:27:29,510 --> 02:27:30,430
No, no, no.

2294
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:34,030
I will start selling off Doki's socks, okay?

2295
02:27:35,130 --> 02:27:37,090
Again, what do you mean again?

2296
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:38,730
I didn't say again.

2297
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:39,990
Oh, I said this again.

2298
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:43,950
Oh, did this happen before?

2299
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:46,310
That's what I'm saying.

2300
02:27:46,370 --> 02:27:48,530
I was like, what has this happened before?

2301
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:57,910
All right, guys, before we go off to our final bracket, we
are going to have a 10-minute interview.

2302
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:58,570
her mission.

2303
02:27:59,690 --> 02:28:05,450
The next two matches will be casted by Kai and Octavio.

2304
02:28:05,910 --> 02:28:07,570
And I believe there will be a Phelan match.

2305
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:10,230
So Phelan really wanted to cast her own match.

2306
02:28:10,410 --> 02:28:16,370
So we'll have her jump right in with Kai and Octavio and to
cast with them as well.

2307
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:21,830
Anyway guys, we hope you enjoy WrestleTuber so far for day
two.

2308
02:28:22,450 --> 02:28:31,210
And Mint and I, we will cast the final matches after Octavio
and her own match against Matara, her spiritual form of

2309
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:31,670
Matara.

2310
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:35,370
Hey, she's not here.

2311
02:28:35,470 --> 02:28:36,150
I could whip her ass.

2312
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:36,930
I mean, she's fine.

2313
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:41,050
Wait, what do we do if, like, will you be voicing for
Matara?

2314
02:28:41,490 --> 02:28:42,750
Yeah, I'll voice for Matara.

2315
02:28:42,830 --> 02:28:43,870
I'll voice for Matara.

2316
02:28:45,130 --> 02:28:45,610

Listen, listen.

2377

I have something very brief to say.

2378
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:46,140
I will not stoop to this thick and twisted diaper meta.

2379
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:56,200

I have everything stacked against me.

2383
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,040
I'm just a man.

2384
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:21,020

02:46:22,060 --> 02:46:22,260

Yeah, no way!

2389
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:29,480
I take this thing all the way.

2390
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:34,100
Oh, man, I don't know how you're going to win without the
diaper, but I'm looking forward to see how this match is

2391
02:46:34,100 --> 02:46:34,480
going to go.

2392
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:34,900
I don't know.

2393
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:35,960
I'm not convinced, man.

2394
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,900
Okay, everyone who's had a freaking diaper wins, man.

2395
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:39,500
I'm scared.

2396
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:40,960
I'm scared.

2397
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,060
True battle.

2398
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:42,960
I'm out of the middle.

2399
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:44,380
I hope you brought a diaper.

2400
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:46,680
No diapers for me.

2401
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,640
We're going commando today, baby.

2402
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:49,460
What?

2403
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:49,820
That's sad.

2404
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:52,780
Because when you shit yourself, they're all going to see.

2405
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:55,500
You know what?

2406
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:56,040
That's fine.

2407
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:56,720
Shit into the air.

2408
02:46:56,820 --> 02:46:57,260
That's great.

2409
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:01,560
We shit like men, not cowards.

2410
02:47:01,940 --> 02:47:03,120
We don't need diapers.

2411
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:05,380
Can't wait for that chocolate fountain man.

2412
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:08,800
I shit in the light.

2413
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:12,920
I don't hide in the shadow.

2414
02:47:13,720 --> 02:47:15,340
You expose it to the sun god.

2415
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:17,100
The sun god.

2416
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,240
The world will see.

2417
02:47:19,900 --> 02:47:20,920
Man, God isn't real.

2418
02:47:22,420 --> 02:47:22,960
God isn't real.

2419
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:24,640
I have no words.

2420
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:34,080

for a bit, and I'm very scared.

2421
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:36,460
I don't, I don't, I have no words.

True, true.

2438
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:35,620
I can't believe we started the freaking diaper thing.

2439
02:49:35,860 --> 02:49:36,300
I know.

2440
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,680
Now it's been applied to everything.

2441
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:40,340
True, true.

2442
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:44,760
That's just, again, the pure power of the diaper.

2443
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:45,640
It's strong, okay?

2444
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,840
Yeah, Luto vibing the demon from hell.

Hell yeah.

2446
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:54,200
You know, this fight is more than just a fight between
wrestlers.

2447
02:49:54,820 --> 02:49:55,100
Oh yeah.

2448
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:58,300
It's a fight between an ordinary human and Gavis Behron.

2449
02:49:58,380 --> 02:50:00,120
and the demon race.

2450
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:02,080
The demon diaper race.

2451
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:03,860
The demon diaper race.

2452
02:50:04,040 --> 02:50:04,880
They're their own breed.

2453
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:05,820
Then they shepherd.

2454
02:50:06,980 --> 02:50:07,620
True, true.

2455
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:09,300
Who are you rooting for here?

2456
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:13,160
Wait, do you think that Luto's like the diaper demon queen
then?

2457
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:14,040
You think she's queen?

2458
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:14,940
You think she's on top?

2459
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:15,520
Yeah.

2460
02:50:15,860 --> 02:50:16,260
Yeah.

2461
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:21,660
I also noticed that she keeps her diaper intact with a pin
in front.

2462
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:23,760
With a gigantic pin.

2463
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:25,120
True.

2464
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:25,940
Yeah, I remember.

2465
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:26,760
Did you see that?

2466
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:28,140
Sayu bringing that up before, yeah.

2467
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:31,440
I think if she were smart, she'd take that and, like, stab
his eyes out.

2468
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:35,000
But, you know, that would be against the rules, you know.

2469
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:36,920
And opposing the diaper.

2470
02:50:38,500 --> 02:50:41,400
It's the jester with the silver hair.

2471
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:44,940
The most charming baby girl himself.

2472
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:46,240
Battle!

2473
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:49,040
Let's go!

2474
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:54,120
That's my senpai, the weirdest senpai ever.

2475
02:50:55,240 --> 02:50:55,740
Oh, come on.

2476
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:56,680
He's a jester.

2477
02:50:57,460 --> 02:50:58,300
Oh, my gosh.

2478
02:50:58,380 --> 02:51:09,020

2485

Get up.

2486
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:01,640
Betel here has the makings of a champion.

2487
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:04,020
I'm sure he can recover.

2488
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:05,860
Oh, no, right in the balls!

2489
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:07,060
Right in the face!

2490
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:08,500
Balls!

2491
02:52:08,660 --> 02:52:09,740
Balls in the face!

2492
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,860
Betel's most important parts!

2493
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:13,280
Oh!

2494
02:52:14,300 --> 02:52:16,180
Body slams from the top of the rope.

2495
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:17,280
No face, it's over.

2496
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:19,360
Oh, no.

2497
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:20,740
Luto is going crazy.

2498
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:22,220
Luto going feral.

2499
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:25,340
Oh, he trained my back butt!

2500
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:25,800
No!

2501
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:27,680
Was that the balls or the stomach?

2502
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:31,320
Damn, Betel.

2503
02:52:31,900 --> 02:52:32,120
Oh.

2504
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:35,360
You need to add 300 more pounds to your weight.

2505
02:52:36,460 --> 02:52:36,980
Yeah, I don't know.

2506
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:37,920
To make this match even.

2507
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:40,320
Flinging him around, like, way too easy.

2508
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:41,160
Rue it.

2509
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:45,040
Oh, head to the mat.

2510
02:52:47,300 --> 02:52:47,580
Okay.

2511
02:52:48,440 --> 02:52:49,180
Reversal by Betel.

2512
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:49,780
That's great.

2513
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:51,960
Oh, yay.

2514
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:53,680
One of Betel's signature flips.

2515
02:52:54,140 --> 02:52:54,680
Hell yeah.

2516
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:56,720
Oh, oh, oh.

2517
02:52:56,940 --> 02:52:57,100
Oh.

2518
02:52:57,460 --> 02:52:57,940
Headlock.

2519
02:52:58,160 --> 02:52:58,360
What's he doing?

2520
02:52:58,380 --> 02:52:58,640
What's he doing?

2521
02:52:58,780 --> 02:52:59,200
What's he doing?

2522
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:00,840
He's setting him up.

2523
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:01,580
Setting him up.

2524
02:53:02,740 --> 02:53:03,320
Throw him around.

2525
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:05,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2526
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:05,960
Oh, oh, oh.

2527
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:08,740
The fake to the throw.

2528
02:53:10,040 --> 02:53:10,660
And a pin.

2529
02:53:11,580 --> 02:53:11,620
One.

2530
02:53:12,500 --> 02:53:12,700
Ah.

2531
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:16,960
Don't count battle out just because he's 200 pounds less.

2532
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,860
That's what makes him so agile, right?

2533
02:53:19,860 --> 02:53:20,960
He's made out of skin and bone.

2534
02:53:24,580 --> 02:53:25,540
Oh, no.

2535
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:28,260
That slam was insane.

2536
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:30,120
And now a submission technique.

2537
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:30,620
Break his leg!

2538
02:53:30,700 --> 02:53:31,060
Break his leg!

2539
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:31,680
With the legs.

2540
02:53:33,560 --> 02:53:34,120
Dislocate it.

2541
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:35,640
Oh man.

2542
02:53:36,220 --> 02:53:36,920
No, he can't get up.

2543
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:37,520
He can't get up.

2544
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:38,060
He can't get up.

2545
02:53:38,060 --> 02:53:38,300
Oh!

2546
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:39,820
Right in the nuts again!

2547
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:42,340
What is this targeted attack on the nuts?

2548
02:53:46,440 --> 02:53:47,160
Oh my god, wait.

2549
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:48,300
Setting him up again.

2550
02:53:48,680 --> 02:53:49,200
Again, bro.

2551
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:50,360
These elaborate setups are so pretty.

2552
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:51,320
Finally, it's going to work in his favor.

2553
02:53:52,020 --> 02:53:53,080
Is he going to do the fake?

2554
02:53:53,080 --> 02:53:53,540
Another flip.

2555
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:54,540
Oh, but it didn't work.

2556
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:55,560
Oh!

2557
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:56,660
But he still got her.

2558
02:53:58,380 --> 02:53:59,620
kick to the stomach.

2559
02:53:59,780 --> 02:54:00,240
Another one.

2560
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:01,220
Oh, I love it.

2561
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:01,940
That's my favorite.

2562
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:03,700
He loves that flamboyant flair.

2563
02:54:04,140 --> 02:54:04,960
No, come on.

2564
02:54:04,980 --> 02:54:06,340
Ooh, on a one count only.

2565
02:54:07,080 --> 02:54:08,240
This is still anybody's game.

2566
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:11,580
Honestly, Beto can be dropped by just a single punch.

2567
02:54:13,980 --> 02:54:15,760
Dude, I don't, I don't know, man.

2568
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:18,800
What happens to Luto if she removes her diaper?

2569
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:20,440
I feel like.

2570
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:22,600
It's like those are power limiters, right?

2571
02:54:22,660 --> 02:54:24,780
It's like rock weight in the fucking weights, all right?

2572
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:26,680
Take out the diaper.

2573
02:54:27,080 --> 02:54:28,260
She needs that.

2574
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:31,320
to fight in a normal man's wrestling match.

2575
02:54:33,980 --> 02:54:35,280
Oh, what?

2576
02:54:36,260 --> 02:54:37,780
The referee bumped into Luto?

2577
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:39,440
Oh, my God.

2578
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:41,280
Oh, no.

2579
02:54:41,400 --> 02:54:42,020
Get pinned down.

2580
02:54:42,740 --> 02:54:43,040
One.

2581
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:43,860
Two.

2582
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:44,400
Two.

2583
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:45,700
Still not.

2584
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:46,220
Still not.

2585
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:47,860
Still not enough.

2586
02:54:48,480 --> 02:54:49,120
Oh, flip.

2587
02:54:49,640 --> 02:54:51,400
Hey, look at those flips.

2588
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:54,060
That's my Oshi.

2589
02:54:55,820 --> 02:54:55,920
Two.

2590
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:57,060
Oh, almost.

2591
02:54:57,380 --> 02:54:58,280
I'm scared.

2592
02:54:58,380 --> 02:54:58,900
I'm scared.

2593
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:02,260
Dude, Betel's kind of going crazy right now.

2594
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:03,580
Oh, he removed the turnbuckle.

2595
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:05,140
What's he planning?

2596
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:07,120
Oh.

2597
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:09,240
Okay, okay.

2598
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:10,980
Another flip, maybe.

2599
02:55:11,380 --> 02:55:12,280
I'm kind of scared.

2600
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:13,140
Oh, no.

2601
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:14,380
The reversal on Betel.

2602
02:55:15,660 --> 02:55:16,920
Oh, no, dude.

2603
02:55:17,380 --> 02:55:18,580
Right into the announcer's table.

2604
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:19,720
Just too long.

2605
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:22,140
Oh, no.

2606
02:55:22,220 --> 02:55:22,980
He's going crazy.

2607
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:24,780
Betel's going to go feral now.

2608
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:26,200
Oh, no.

2609
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:27,300
Oh, no.

2610
02:55:27,540 --> 02:55:28,360
Right on the 7th.

2611
02:55:28,380 --> 02:55:28,880
Ah!

2612
02:55:30,460 --> 02:55:31,700
Get back in the ring!

2613
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:33,140
That's not just one!

2614
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:34,300
It's three!

2615
02:55:34,900 --> 02:55:35,080
What?

Come on, Beto, you were doing so good!

2619

This is so sad!

2620
02:55:44,820 --> 02:55:45,640
This is so sad!

2621
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:46,460
Oh, in the taunt!

2622
02:55:46,620 --> 02:55:47,420
Oh, you're really gonna take that?

2623
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:49,160
Oh no, in the taunt, let my boy go!

2624

2640
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:39,340
Hell yeah.

2641
02:56:39,440 --> 02:56:39,880
I love it.

2642
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:40,600
Looks so sick.

2643
02:56:42,460 --> 02:56:42,720
Okay.

2644
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:44,320
Oh.

2645
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:44,800
Damn.

2646
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:47,080
The backbreaker.

2647
02:56:49,160 --> 02:56:49,660
What is this?

2648
02:56:49,780 --> 02:56:50,940
No, the surprise pin.

2649
02:56:51,620 --> 02:56:52,440
Oh my God.

2650
02:56:52,760 --> 02:56:53,820
Not like this.

2651
02:56:55,220 --> 02:56:55,700
Okay.

2652
02:56:55,840 --> 02:56:56,340
We're safe.

2653
02:56:57,660 --> 02:56:58,820
Oh, no.

2654
02:56:58,820 --> 02:56:59,680
the diaper into the face.

2655
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:00,820
Oh my god, I thought she was going to sit on his face.

2656
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:04,020
Oh, you can hear the squelch from here.

2657
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:05,940
Oh, dude, the stick.

2658
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:07,180
It's filling up the arena.

2659
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:08,100
Woo.

2660
02:57:09,680 --> 02:57:10,800
Betel still has a chance.

2661
02:57:10,980 --> 02:57:11,400
Oh, no.

2662
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:12,500
A kick to the back.

2663
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:13,000
Oh, come on.

2664
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:14,260
Just kick the diaper off.

2665
02:57:14,860 --> 02:57:16,500
He's going to remove the turnbuckle again.

2666
02:57:17,140 --> 02:57:17,760
Oh, God.

2667
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:20,140
He's removed two now.

2668
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:22,460
What is he going to do about it?

2669
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:23,480
What is he going to do about it?

2670
02:57:23,480 --> 02:57:23,660
Fucking slam, man.

2671
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:25,780
Fucking flip slam me out.

2672
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:26,280
Oh, my god.

2673
02:57:26,380 --> 02:57:27,680
He can't just body slam normally.

2674
02:57:28,820 --> 02:57:29,880
He has the flip.

2675
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:31,180
Yeah, I got out a little flare.

2676
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:32,580
Oh my god!

2677
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:36,860
He uses his body as a weapon of fireball.

2678
02:57:37,540 --> 02:57:38,840
Dude, he's a fucking weapon.

2679
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:39,980
He needs a permanent walk around.

2680
02:57:39,980 --> 02:57:43,240
Humanity will not give in to the devil and Satan.

2681
02:57:46,300 --> 02:57:47,140
Oh, the taunt.

2682
02:57:47,380 --> 02:57:48,440
Oh, but battle didn't like that.

2683
02:57:48,500 --> 02:57:51,120
Oh, headbutt right to the ribs.

2684
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:55,000
This is what you get for taunt.

2685
02:57:57,300 --> 02:57:58,800
There was a cool spear.

2686
02:57:58,820 --> 02:58:12,060

No, you're gonna fucking kick me in the ball?

2690
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:33,920
That's illegal.

2691
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:34,800
Think again.

2692
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:35,900
Think again.

2693
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:37,140
The illegal move.

2694
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:40,000
I can't believe it.

2695
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:41,880
I can't believe it.

2696
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:44,220
I can't believe it.

2697
02:58:44,240 --> 02:58:46,680
With a low blow to win the match.

2698
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:50,780
Your baby girl is all grown up.

2699
02:58:51,220 --> 02:58:53,240
No diapers for the winner.

2700
02:58:54,040 --> 02:58:55,540
I can't believe it.

2701
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:56,280
No.

2702
02:58:56,740 --> 02:58:58,800
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

2703
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:00,500
That was so, that was beautiful!

2704
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:02,420
Oh my god, I have like a tear in my life.

2705
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:03,660
Oh man!

2706
02:59:04,480 --> 02:59:05,700
That was great.

2707
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:10,600
Ladies and gentlemen, battles the motherfucking winner!

2708
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:14,920
Oh, we should be What a sad, what a sad move.

2709
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:18,840
The dirtiest move he did.

2710
02:59:19,820 --> 02:59:21,980
I didn't know Luto could lose like that.

2711
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:24,980
Dude, I didn't think it could get dirtier than the diaper,
but here we are.

2712
02:59:25,160 --> 02:59:25,820
I- yeah.

2713
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:28,140

go for the balls i was just matching my opponent so what can

2716
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:58,580

grabbing luto's balls why why did you do it listen to defeat

2717
02:59:58,580 --> 03:00:07,280
your opponent you attack the source the diaper is the source

lesbian would win you know what little you're pretty

The myth, the legend.

2727
03:01:16,260 --> 03:01:18,060
My brain can't process this right now.

2728
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:19,360
It's too late for me.

His name has BNL.

2733
03:01:30,340 --> 03:01:31,540
Which is present in balls.

2734
03:01:32,380 --> 03:01:32,620
Wow.

03:01:34,820 --> 03:01:36,300
So that makes sense.

My budget!

03:03:39,330 --> 03:03:40,490
We have budget cups, sorry.

2772
03:03:42,250 --> 03:03:43,510
I can't afford it anymore, alright.

2773
03:03:43,530 --> 03:03:44,890
I'm indie now, what can I say?

2774
03:03:45,030 --> 03:03:46,130
It's definitely what it is.

2775
03:03:46,450 --> 03:03:48,690
Alright, like, who am I up against?

2776
03:03:48,970 --> 03:03:49,370
Sarah?

2777
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:50,890
Oh, it's a snake lady.

2778
03:03:52,110 --> 03:03:57,710
Oh, look, look, Philly, and you probably don't know who I
am, but I don't really care, because I have a philosophy and

2779
03:03:57,710 --> 03:03:59,070
it's pretty simple.

2780
03:03:59,430 --> 03:04:01,690
I'm gonna be so good that they can't ignore me.

2781
03:04:01,890 --> 03:04:05,430
So that goes for you, my opponent, goes for the audience,
and goes for everyone.

2782
03:04:06,050 --> 03:04:11,830
Because, look, people might not know me out there they might
not even like me but i don't need to be liked i need to win

2783
03:04:12,270 --> 03:04:19,930
so i'm gonna play the villain if it means i get that yeah i
respect it yeah i remember the pilot is very spicy today

I'm sorry.

2792
03:04:54,890 --> 03:04:56,170

Oh, uh, yeah.

2794
03:04:58,930 --> 03:05:01,570

2795
03:05:02,370 --> 03:05:02,570
Yeah.

2796
03:05:02,670 --> 03:05:06,290

she's got a whole fucking snake, right?

2797
03:05:07,130 --> 03:05:16,750
and then she'll just yeet that snake like right how do you
counter that grabbing the snake by the balls too true yeah

2798
03:05:16,750 --> 03:05:31,770
true the more you listen i will avenge toky i will flip on
your face and i will beach into a pulp i will take your

2799
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:39,170

skin as a purse understand me right but uh i'm not

2800
03:05:39,170 --> 03:05:46,250
necessarily a venomous snake i'm one of the types that will
constrict you so um i'll have you tapping before long let's

phillian is a high flyer both bogan has a snake you can't

2805
03:06:19,070 --> 03:06:26,810
fucking do she's got a snake man like i don't know i don't
know let's see if she can pull off what she learned from the

2806
03:06:26,810 --> 03:06:31,150
battle match thankful that she won't bring out the snake
during the battle usually she brings out the snake at the

2807
03:06:31,150 --> 03:06:34,430
end that's true we'll see but who knows maybe she'll change
her mind

2808
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:42,090
the serpent that doesn't take shit from anybody.

2809
03:06:42,990 --> 03:06:48,330
The serpent's storyteller herself, Sarah.

2810
03:06:49,690 --> 03:06:50,210
Oh,

2811
03:06:56,430 --> 03:06:57,010
that harmonizer.

2812
03:06:57,690 --> 03:06:58,070
Where is she?

2813
03:06:58,470 --> 03:06:59,030
Where is she?

2814
03:06:59,090 --> 03:06:59,570
Where is she?

2815
03:06:59,790 --> 03:07:00,290
Sarah.

2816
03:07:00,710 --> 03:07:02,250
Her sweet ass time.

2817
03:07:03,370 --> 03:07:05,110
She forgot the snake backstage, all right?

2818
03:07:05,150 --> 03:07:06,170
She left it in the break room.

2819
03:07:07,130 --> 03:07:07,890
Fuck you!

2820
03:07:08,130 --> 03:07:09,210
Where's Sarah?

2821
03:07:09,850 --> 03:07:10,890
Where's Sarah?

2822
03:07:11,350 --> 03:07:12,590
Where's this damn pilot?

2823
03:07:12,870 --> 03:07:13,730
Don't tell me she got cold feet!

2824
03:07:14,710 --> 03:07:17,350
Oh, there she is.

2825
03:07:17,750 --> 03:07:18,670
There she is.

2826
03:07:18,730 --> 03:07:20,450
Let's fucking go, Sarah.

2827
03:07:21,590 --> 03:07:23,250
Look at those tight shorts.

2828
03:07:25,290 --> 03:07:25,910
They're very tight.

2829
03:07:28,590 --> 03:07:30,230
She's got so much muscle.

2830
03:07:30,710 --> 03:07:32,450
Holy fuck, fucking bill.

2831
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:33,430
Holy crap.

2832
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:35,790
I'm not quite sure.

2833
03:07:35,910 --> 03:07:37,110
Is that hair or like a...

2834
03:07:37,970 --> 03:07:38,790
No, that's hair!

2835
03:07:39,470 --> 03:07:39,850
Yeah, that's hair!

2836
03:07:40,030 --> 03:07:40,510
It's actual hair.

2837
03:07:40,930 --> 03:07:43,070
I thought it was like a thing, like a cloth.

2838
03:07:43,470 --> 03:07:44,090
Oh, okay.

2839
03:07:44,290 --> 03:07:44,610
No, no, no.

2840
03:07:44,670 --> 03:07:44,950
It's her hair.

2841
03:07:45,070 --> 03:07:45,310
It's her hair.

2842
03:07:45,470 --> 03:07:47,950
She takes such good, like, such good care, you know?

2843
03:07:48,270 --> 03:07:50,250
It's like, so flowy.

2844
03:07:50,530 --> 03:07:50,930
Oh my god.

2845
03:07:51,110 --> 03:07:52,370
Crawling on the floor.

2846
03:07:52,690 --> 03:07:53,370
That's intimidating.

2847
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:55,570
Immersing herself and what it means to be a snake.

2848
03:07:57,450 --> 03:07:58,030
Dude, I don't know.

2849
03:07:58,030 --> 03:07:59,770
I feel like half of these intros are so intimidating.

2850
03:07:59,890 --> 03:08:00,850
I'd just be scared shitless.

2851
03:08:00,990 --> 03:08:03,050
I don't know how Phelan's gonna deal with all the diapers,
man.

2852
03:08:03,790 --> 03:08:06,010
She's just gonna have to, like, shit on, I'm sorry.

2853
03:08:06,170 --> 03:08:07,110
I can't get over the diapers.

2854
03:08:07,130 --> 03:08:13,710
man I can't it's the end of an era I need to get over it but
it's it's it's stock man I can't I can't accept reality I

2855
03:08:13,710 --> 03:08:22,410
mean diaper diaper meta our legacy that's our legacy as cast
is for today I love it you bet next year's WrestleTuber will

2856
03:08:22,410 --> 03:08:29,690
have a bunch more diapers yeah no next year's WrestleTuber
everybody's obligated everyone diaper Russell diaper

2857
03:08:29,690 --> 03:08:38,690
everybody has a custom diaper yeah and you can buy merch in
the future, right?

2858
03:08:38,830 --> 03:08:39,510
Oh my god!

2859
03:08:39,970 --> 03:08:41,470
No, not the merch!

2860
03:08:41,930 --> 03:08:42,930
Oh my god!

2861
03:08:43,950 --> 03:08:45,490
Dude, actually, though...

2862
03:08:45,490 --> 03:08:45,930
No, no, no.

2863
03:08:46,930 --> 03:08:47,550
Actually, no.

2864
03:08:47,890 --> 03:08:47,890
No.

2865
03:08:48,010 --> 03:08:48,370
I'm just kidding.

2866
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:50,410
Actually, yes.

2867
03:08:51,470 --> 03:08:53,370
If I had a diaper, I'd want it to be dazzled.

2868
03:08:53,370 --> 03:08:53,830
That's useful.

2869
03:08:54,090 --> 03:08:54,830
Diapers are useful.

2870
03:08:55,990 --> 03:08:56,490
It's true.

2871
03:08:56,630 --> 03:08:58,050
It's also the Great Equalizer.

2872
03:08:58,150 --> 03:09:00,370
All of us wore a diaper before.

2873
03:09:01,590 --> 03:09:02,130
That's true?

2874
03:09:02,610 --> 03:09:03,570
Yeah, true.

2875
03:09:04,550 --> 03:09:06,190
I'm sure dragons wear diapers.

2876
03:09:07,150 --> 03:09:14,230
Well, I mean, maybe when I was like a wee dragon, but not
anymore, because I'm a big girl, obviously, and I'm very old

2877
03:09:14,230 --> 03:09:17,410
and wise, because, you know, I'm like a god, and I'm like,
oh, like that.

2878
03:09:17,570 --> 03:09:21,230
When we're super old, like geriatric age, we will wear
diapers again, so.

2879
03:09:21,850 --> 03:09:23,890
No, no, no, dragons, we're just, like, built different.

2880
03:09:25,230 --> 03:09:26,870
Sorry to say, so we just don't.

2881
03:09:27,050 --> 03:09:27,750
We're just better.

2882
03:09:28,170 --> 03:09:29,010
Oh, okay.

2883
03:09:29,310 --> 03:09:30,130
Yeah, I see.

2884
03:09:30,690 --> 03:09:30,910
Yeah.

2885
03:09:30,970 --> 03:09:31,230
I see.

2886
03:09:31,930 --> 03:09:33,090
But maybe you could be the first.

2887
03:09:33,270 --> 03:09:33,630
Who knows?

2888
03:09:34,350 --> 03:09:34,710
Right.

2889
03:09:35,110 --> 03:09:36,470
I can't start a movement.

2890
03:09:37,130 --> 03:09:37,590
Set the trend.

2891
03:09:37,830 --> 03:09:39,010
Yeah, trend setter.

2892
03:09:40,530 --> 03:09:43,270
This intro still just goes on and on.

2893
03:09:44,590 --> 03:09:46,030
It's been an hour.

2894
03:09:46,430 --> 03:09:46,990
But bugging.

2895
03:09:47,210 --> 03:09:47,510
All right, there we go.

2896
03:09:47,630 --> 03:09:48,370
Get out of here.

2897
03:09:48,730 --> 03:09:49,190
Thank you.

2898
03:09:49,350 --> 03:09:50,110
Get out of here.

2899
03:09:51,470 --> 03:09:52,690
Here we go, guys.

2900
03:09:53,030 --> 03:09:53,930
Oh, my God.

2901
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:54,350
All right.

2902
03:09:54,630 --> 03:09:55,650
Here comes Phelian.

2903
03:09:57,810 --> 03:10:06,590
And making an appearance outside of VR chat here to grace
our presence.

2904
03:10:08,930 --> 03:10:09,290
It's failure!

2905
03:10:10,110 --> 03:10:10,870
Yeah, yeah, yo!

2906
03:10:12,850 --> 03:10:13,970
Look at those moves.

2907
03:10:14,390 --> 03:10:15,030
Yeah, I love those moves.

2908
03:10:15,030 --> 03:10:15,870
I don't know what those moves are called.

2909
03:10:16,670 --> 03:10:17,570
Yeah, no, me neither.

2910
03:10:18,250 --> 03:10:20,210
I don't know what any moves anyone's making today.

2911
03:10:20,870 --> 03:10:21,510
I don't know wrestling moves.

2912
03:10:21,770 --> 03:10:22,530
I don't know dance moves.

2913
03:10:23,610 --> 03:10:25,730
Oh, do you know, Octavia, do you know how to hit the gritty?

2914
03:10:27,210 --> 03:10:27,570
Yeah!

2915
03:10:28,070 --> 03:10:28,610
You do?

2916
03:10:28,710 --> 03:10:30,030
It's like, I do this.

2917
03:10:33,130 --> 03:10:33,690
See that?

2918
03:10:33,730 --> 03:10:34,150
Get it!

2919
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:35,650
Yeah, that was really impressive, man.

2920
03:10:36,270 --> 03:10:37,090
I'm also impressed.

2921
03:10:37,390 --> 03:10:40,910
Don't, um, I think I need more practice, honestly.

2922
03:10:42,870 --> 03:10:43,210
Me too.

2923
03:10:43,530 --> 03:10:44,390
Philly, you should have done the gritty.

2924
03:10:44,650 --> 03:10:45,470
Zero out of 10 intro.

2925
03:10:47,810 --> 03:10:48,890
Yeah, what the heck is this dance?

2926
03:10:49,150 --> 03:10:51,370
This dance is actually very like, very old.

2927
03:10:52,050 --> 03:10:54,070
This is what the kids do nowadays, all right?

2928
03:10:54,170 --> 03:10:55,650
We're doing like 2008 dance.

2929
03:10:55,650 --> 03:10:57,010
When were we hitting the gritties?

2930

All right, this is your old.

2931
03:10:58,590 --> 03:10:59,430
Get out of here with that shit.

2932
03:10:59,570 --> 03:11:02,090
This was the year where we all had eyeliner on.

2933
03:11:02,770 --> 03:11:03,610
It's that old.

2934
03:11:04,270 --> 03:11:05,630

Okay, I thought that was gonna go for it.

That was like too early.

2954
03:12:26,430 --> 03:12:26,890
That's too early.

2955
03:12:27,110 --> 03:12:27,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:12:31,550 --> 03:12:32,010
Are you setting up?

2960
03:12:33,030 --> 03:12:33,330
Oh.

Ah!

Oh man, that was so cool.

2965
03:12:38,950 --> 03:12:39,610
A drop kick to the back.

2966
03:12:39,770 --> 03:12:40,750
That's got a hurt.

2967
03:12:42,390 --> 03:12:43,890
A herniated spine.

2968
03:12:44,290 --> 03:12:45,510
Come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

2969
03:12:45,810 --> 03:12:47,450
Oh, butt to the face!

Oh, so lucky!

2971
03:12:48,710 --> 03:12:49,510
A non-diaper butt to the face!

2972
03:12:50,290 --> 03:12:52,030
So lucky I should not wear a diaper.

2973
03:12:55,050 --> 03:12:58,230
Just straight up like bone structure and fat.

2974
03:13:00,310 --> 03:13:00,830
Oh.

2975
03:13:01,370 --> 03:13:01,890

03:13:02,230 --> 03:13:02,430
Ooh.

What?

2978
03:13:05,650 --> 03:13:05,910
That was sick.

2979
03:13:06,010 --> 03:13:06,490
That was sick.

2980
03:13:06,950 --> 03:13:07,750
Props to the cameraman.

2981
03:13:08,130 --> 03:13:09,070
The cameraman is doing great.

2982
03:13:09,210 --> 03:13:09,810
Dude, right?

2983
03:13:10,310 --> 03:13:13,290
Unlike this fucking referee that drives me through the roof
every time.

2984
03:13:13,630 --> 03:13:13,710
True.

2985
03:13:15,270 --> 03:13:15,390
Whoa!

2986
03:13:17,010 --> 03:13:18,890
Fucking Satan down another one!

2987
03:13:19,030 --> 03:13:20,050
From the ring!

2988
03:13:21,290 --> 03:13:24,310
My God, how does she not get dizzy from doing all those
flips?

2989
03:13:25,610 --> 03:13:25,810
Oh.

2990
03:13:26,590 --> 03:13:27,390
What was that?

2991
03:13:27,850 --> 03:13:28,090
Oh.

2992
03:13:29,970 --> 03:13:30,390
Okay.

2993
03:13:31,490 --> 03:13:33,470
Ah, right on the cement.

2994
03:13:33,810 --> 03:13:35,330
Come on, get her, get her down, get her down!

2995
03:13:35,650 --> 03:13:36,390
in front of the crowd.

2996
03:13:36,530 --> 03:13:38,770
Look at all those three men in the black shirts.

2997
03:13:41,310 --> 03:13:43,350
Crowd is so excited, so hyped.

2998
03:13:44,510 --> 03:13:46,190
Okay, keep him inside the ring.

2999
03:13:47,270 --> 03:13:48,950
So you can pin him when you need him to.

3000
03:13:49,410 --> 03:13:50,170
Get in the ring!

3001
03:13:50,310 --> 03:13:51,390
Oh, they're staring each other down.

3002
03:13:51,990 --> 03:13:53,110
One in heaven, one in hell.

3003
03:13:55,010 --> 03:13:55,450
Oh, oh.

3004
03:13:55,890 --> 03:13:56,250
Oh!

3005
03:13:56,810 --> 03:13:57,910
Holy shit, do it!

3006
03:13:57,930 --> 03:13:59,230
Just carried like a twig.

3007
03:13:59,810 --> 03:14:00,230
Do it!

3008
03:14:00,730 --> 03:14:02,250
Oh, head to the turnbuckle.

3009
03:14:02,590 --> 03:14:03,650
That's got to hurt as well.

3010
03:14:07,390 --> 03:14:07,790
Whoa!

3011
03:14:08,170 --> 03:14:08,390
Whoa!

3012
03:14:09,810 --> 03:14:10,130
Huh?

3013
03:14:10,290 --> 03:14:14,650
You didn't tell me Bulk Bogan was also athletic and flexible
like that.

3014
03:14:15,270 --> 03:14:16,130
I got the setup.

3015
03:14:16,130 --> 03:14:16,930
I know she did that as well.

3016
03:14:17,770 --> 03:14:18,890
Oh, here we go.

3017
03:14:19,030 --> 03:14:20,210
This referee is so freaking slow.

3018
03:14:20,630 --> 03:14:20,670
Two!

3019
03:14:20,970 --> 03:14:21,270
Two!

3020
03:14:21,550 --> 03:14:22,310
I know, right?

3021
03:14:22,330 --> 03:14:23,430
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3022
03:14:24,550 --> 03:14:25,690
Fillion is too slippery.

3023
03:14:26,450 --> 03:14:27,270
Too slippery and thin.

3024
03:14:27,450 --> 03:14:28,290
Yeah, she's too fast.

3025
03:14:28,370 --> 03:14:28,830
She's too fast.

3026
03:14:28,970 --> 03:14:30,130
Oh, butt to the face.

3027
03:14:30,450 --> 03:14:30,850
Again.

3028
03:14:33,190 --> 03:14:34,310
Oh, pull her arm off.

3029
03:14:34,530 --> 03:14:35,030
Pull her arm off.

3030
03:14:35,130 --> 03:14:35,530
Yeah!

3031
03:14:36,550 --> 03:14:36,990
Yeah!

3032
03:14:38,670 --> 03:14:40,010
Crap her by the ear, yeah!

3033
03:14:41,170 --> 03:14:44,170
I just realized Phyllian is in like a generic dance practice
outfit.

3034
03:14:45,290 --> 03:14:47,630
Yeah, she, listen, she's not here for the bells and
whistles.

3035
03:14:47,930 --> 03:14:48,790
She's getting to...

3036
03:14:48,790 --> 03:14:50,690
Yeah, no, she had a warm-up, all right?

3037
03:14:51,330 --> 03:14:52,330
She was warming up.

3038
03:14:53,370 --> 03:14:53,670
Oh!

3039
03:14:55,670 --> 03:14:58,990
Phyllian actually rivals Gavis Battle in all the acrobatics.

3040
03:14:59,230 --> 03:14:59,810
Maybe even better!

3041
03:15:00,330 --> 03:15:04,430
I need to see Phyllian versus Battle fight just for all the
flips, dude.

3042
03:15:05,970 --> 03:15:07,010
Oh, shit.

3043
03:15:07,610 --> 03:15:09,790
Oh, kick in the air.

3044
03:15:10,290 --> 03:15:11,350
Converse to the face.

3045
03:15:12,990 --> 03:15:14,890
One, one, two, three.

3046
03:15:16,090 --> 03:15:17,210
Not yet.

3047
03:15:17,470 --> 03:15:21,290
Now, this seems to be, this feels like it's going to be a
long battle.

3048
03:15:21,950 --> 03:15:22,090
Yeah.

3049
03:15:22,250 --> 03:15:22,650
We'll see.

3050
03:15:23,230 --> 03:15:27,270
Why did Ludo just like dramatically like her all up?

3051
03:15:27,790 --> 03:15:28,950
Like, oh, God, get it.

3052
03:15:29,410 --> 03:15:32,090
Oh, she set herself up for that one, honestly.

3053
03:15:32,310 --> 03:15:35,050
Her own butt to Bulk Bogan's face, bony.

3054
03:15:36,210 --> 03:15:37,770
That's gotta hurt.

3055
03:15:38,530 --> 03:15:39,390
Oh, the ankles.

3056
03:15:41,910 --> 03:15:43,490
Oh my god.

3057
03:15:45,390 --> 03:15:46,230
Oh no, I can't.

3058
03:15:46,570 --> 03:15:47,770
Bulk Bogan is...

3059
03:15:47,770 --> 03:15:48,430
I can't watch.

3060
03:15:48,610 --> 03:15:49,530
This is just...

3061
03:15:50,230 --> 03:15:50,990
Ludo, come on.

3062
03:15:51,330 --> 03:15:51,510
Yeah.

3063
03:15:52,010 --> 03:15:52,770
Get it together.

3064
03:15:53,070 --> 03:15:53,330
What?

3065
03:15:54,670 --> 03:15:56,410
Bulk Bogan, your snake!

3066
03:15:56,950 --> 03:15:57,610
Think of your...

3067
03:15:57,610 --> 03:15:57,850
Ah!

3068
03:15:58,370 --> 03:16:01,090
An elbow from the top of the rope to the cement!

3069
03:16:01,950 --> 03:16:02,350
What?

3070
03:16:02,510 --> 03:16:05,390
Oh my god, Philly just won't let her get up!

3071
03:16:05,530 --> 03:16:07,490
Phelian, don't kill Bulk Bogan!

3072
03:16:08,150 --> 03:16:10,790
Her snake won't know what happened to her owner!

3073
03:16:11,110 --> 03:16:12,070
Oh god!

3074
03:16:14,310 --> 03:16:15,070
Oh, what?

3075
03:16:15,390 --> 03:16:19,210
The snake is waiting at home for Bulk Bogan and she never
comes back.

3076
03:16:19,750 --> 03:16:21,630
That's so sad, oh my god!

3077
03:16:22,110 --> 03:16:25,450
Snake, we're, yeah, we're, listen, we're putting the snake
up for like auction.

3078
03:16:25,990 --> 03:16:30,430
Everybody put your, put your auctions in the chat, how much
are we, how much you want to buy this snake for?

3079
03:16:31,150 --> 03:16:34,290
We need to find a new owner for Bulk Bogan's snakes.

3080
03:16:36,430 --> 03:16:36,830
Damn.

3081
03:16:37,210 --> 03:16:39,290
Dude, I feel like they should already be counting like Ludo.

3082
03:16:39,530 --> 03:16:41,070
It's just like not getting up.

3083
03:16:43,110 --> 03:16:43,650
Oh, no.

3084
03:16:43,770 --> 03:16:44,130
There she goes.

3085
03:16:44,310 --> 03:16:44,730
There she goes.

3086
03:16:45,310 --> 03:16:46,130
She's not done yet.

3087
03:16:46,670 --> 03:16:47,930
She's not out the fight yet.

3088
03:16:49,290 --> 03:16:49,410
Okay.

3089
03:16:49,530 --> 03:16:49,670
Okay.

3090
03:16:50,650 --> 03:16:52,170
Don't let her treat you like that.

3091
03:16:52,250 --> 03:16:52,430
Oh, yeah.

3092
03:16:52,630 --> 03:16:53,070
The reversal.

3093
03:16:54,210 --> 03:16:55,010
Let's go.

3094
03:16:55,030 --> 03:16:56,010
Oh, right in the gut.

3095
03:16:56,310 --> 03:16:56,970
Oh, right in the face.

3096
03:16:57,970 --> 03:16:58,370
Ooh.

3097
03:16:58,570 --> 03:17:00,730
How do you block an arm that thick?

3098
03:17:01,470 --> 03:17:02,370
Dude, you can't.

3099
03:17:02,390 --> 03:17:03,590
She's just a fucking tank.

3100
03:17:06,930 --> 03:17:18,950
whoops oh whoops yo oh what am I watching the rest of our
Olympics dude these flips are insane feelings in the wrong

3101
03:17:18,950 --> 03:17:25,910

right not the fucking WWE but it's not on me to one career

3102
03:17:25,910 --> 03:17:39,430
path three this is it that was it billion one against bulky
bogey holy The furry speedster straight out of your chat.

3103
03:17:40,010 --> 03:17:43,470
No, not Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's Philean.

3104
03:17:44,930 --> 03:17:45,330
Yeah!

3105
03:17:46,410 --> 03:17:47,550
That was insane.

3106
03:17:48,490 --> 03:17:51,010
Dude, I thought she was going to whip out that snake, but
she didn't.

3107
03:17:51,930 --> 03:17:53,470
Ah, she should have done it.

3108
03:17:54,070 --> 03:17:57,510
Well, Philean, all of that gym, all of that workout for
what?

3109
03:17:57,750 --> 03:17:59,230
Philean, why are you flexing?

3110
03:17:59,350 --> 03:18:00,370
You have nothing there, bro.

3111
03:18:00,470 --> 03:18:01,250
You look like a toothpick.

3112
03:18:01,630 --> 03:18:03,070
Why are you flexing?

3113
03:18:06,810 --> 03:18:07,510
It's all right.

3114
03:18:07,630 --> 03:18:08,550
Listen, I can't talk shit.

3115
03:18:08,690 --> 03:18:09,430
She fucking won.

3116
03:18:09,490 --> 03:18:10,770
So it doesn't fucking matter.

3117
03:18:11,250 --> 03:18:11,950
It doesn't matter.

3118
03:18:12,070 --> 03:18:13,810
Muscles actually don't matter if you think about it.

3119
03:18:16,710 --> 03:18:17,510
All right.

3120
03:18:17,750 --> 03:18:18,930
Let's go see what they have to say.

3121
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:20,370
That's just in-bone and tendons.

3122
03:18:20,870 --> 03:18:21,230
Philly and Philly.

3123
03:18:21,490 --> 03:18:26,090
How the fuck did you, like, how did you raise him up?

3124
03:18:26,310 --> 03:18:27,410
How could you flip him?

3125
03:18:27,990 --> 03:18:28,710
I need to know.

3126
03:18:29,750 --> 03:18:34,110
I used the power of God in anime and I showed her my snake.

3127
03:18:37,110 --> 03:18:39,190
And it was over before it began.

3128
03:18:39,710 --> 03:18:41,210
Like I said, new purse.

3129
03:18:41,590 --> 03:18:42,130
Is it a Pada?

3130
03:18:42,330 --> 03:18:42,970
Is it a Gucci?

3131
03:18:43,250 --> 03:18:44,130
No, it's a Sarah.

3132
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:46,330
All right.

3133
03:18:46,650 --> 03:18:48,350
I just have one thing I want to say.

3134
03:18:48,870 --> 03:18:52,030
And my name's not Sarah.

3135
03:18:52,330 --> 03:18:53,570
It's not Luto.

3136
03:18:54,130 --> 03:18:55,830
It is Sarah Nagare.

3137
03:18:55,970 --> 03:18:58,250
Remember that name because I'm coming back.

3138
03:18:58,490 --> 03:18:59,850
And I'm coming back with a vengeance.

3139
03:19:00,230 --> 03:19:01,210
You better believe it.

3140
03:19:01,350 --> 03:19:03,530
This is not the last time you've seen me.

3141
03:19:03,750 --> 03:19:05,510
So remember it next time.

3142
03:19:05,990 --> 03:19:08,770
Hey, hey, let me know when you can touch your toes.

3143
03:19:09,310 --> 03:19:09,590
All right.

3144
03:19:11,370 --> 03:19:11,510
What?

3145
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:13,610
Snakes don't have toes.

3146
03:19:14,550 --> 03:19:14,730
All right.

3147
03:19:16,030 --> 03:19:19,410
Well, let me know when you put them on and then touch them.

3148
03:19:19,750 --> 03:19:20,410
Oh, whoa.

3149
03:19:20,670 --> 03:19:22,110
I put them on.

3150
03:19:22,750 --> 03:19:26,890
I feel like- Let me just get my fake toes and I'll- I just
find some feet.

3151
03:19:28,130 --> 03:19:30,210
I'll just find some feet, like, strap them on real quick.

3152
03:19:30,270 --> 03:19:31,190
It's like Velcro, you know?

3153
03:19:31,230 --> 03:19:32,890
Yeah, I'll just, I'll throw them on.

3154
03:19:32,990 --> 03:19:33,330
It's okay.

3155
03:19:33,390 --> 03:19:33,650
Wow.

3156
03:19:33,750 --> 03:19:35,150
I didn't know Philean liked feet.

3157
03:19:35,530 --> 03:19:37,550
We're learning a lot of things today.

3158
03:19:37,830 --> 03:19:39,270
Hey, no king shaming, no king shaming.

3159
03:19:39,850 --> 03:19:40,810
Hey, I'm not here for the feet.

3160
03:19:40,930 --> 03:19:41,590
I'm here for the snake.

3161
03:19:41,750 --> 03:19:42,190
Give me Jin.

3162
03:19:42,450 --> 03:19:43,310

3164
03:19:47,390 --> 03:19:48,250
Oh, God.

3165
03:19:48,250 --> 03:19:49,190
True, he does look very distinguished.

3166
03:19:50,050 --> 03:19:51,850
Yeah, I just realized that he's very distinguished.

3167
03:19:51,850 --> 03:19:52,290
He's very gentle.

3168
03:19:54,030 --> 03:19:54,470

3171
03:19:57,690 --> 03:19:58,990
Does he have anything to say?

3172
03:20:00,030 --> 03:20:01,850
Yeah, I don't have something to say.

3173
03:20:02,070 --> 03:20:05,830
And that is, are we allowed to swear on this or is his
family friendly.

3174
03:20:07,310 --> 03:20:09,910
I've sworn a bunch of times so I mean I don't know.

3175
03:20:10,790 --> 03:20:14,950

03:28:49,110 --> 03:28:56,210
Projecting herself onto the ring is our own ghost maid
dressing up as solid snake.

3328
03:28:58,710 --> 03:28:59,430
Meant!

3329
03:28:59,430 --> 03:29:01,750

explodes.

Oh, I don't actually wish What are you?

3346
03:29:43,680 --> 03:29:47,160

Yeah, and I've got an ass to beat solid snake Turn around.

03:30:32,930 --> 03:30:33,670
Oh, she's gone.

3359
03:30:33,770 --> 03:30:36,310
Make sure she's doing her stretches right now.

3360
03:30:36,410 --> 03:30:37,570
Oh, I'm so laid back.

3361
03:30:37,670 --> 03:30:38,430

3362
03:30:38,510 --> 03:30:38,930
I'm so ready.

3363
03:30:45,970 --> 03:30:49,610
It's fine, I'm getting her defenses low.

3364
03:30:50,110 --> 03:30:52,710
I mean, you got the feet right up to your face.

3365
03:30:53,410 --> 03:30:55,130
She ain't wearing any shoes.

3366
03:30:55,310 --> 03:30:55,690
It's okay.

3367
03:30:56,010 --> 03:30:58,750
You know, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?

3368
03:30:59,630 --> 03:31:00,370

03:31:08,010 --> 03:31:08,910
Oh, my God.

I'm just like solid snake.

3412
03:33:22,660 --> 03:33:25,540
There's no microwave that can defeat me, everybody.

3413
03:33:28,260 --> 03:33:28,860
All right.

3414
03:33:29,060 --> 03:33:30,540
And Mint is grabbing onto Matara.

3415
03:33:30,960 --> 03:33:31,860
She's doing the flip.

3416
03:33:32,140 --> 03:33:34,520
Oh, but Matara's punching back on her head.

3417
03:33:34,720 --> 03:33:36,640
That's a concussion right there.

3418
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:37,080
Yeah.

3419
03:33:37,220 --> 03:33:39,160
Why did you grab her like that?

3420
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:39,960
Mint, what did you do?

3421
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:40,860
Oh, the second pin.

3422
03:33:40,880 --> 03:33:41,660
Another pin.

3423
03:33:42,200 --> 03:33:42,640
One.

3424
03:33:43,380 --> 03:33:44,840
Oh, another one.

3425
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:47,340
Matara's doing these pins a little bit too early.

3426
03:33:48,060 --> 03:33:49,960
Oh my god, I'm actually crawling like I'm in the microwave.

3427
03:33:50,320 --> 03:33:51,520
That's just sad, Mint.

3428
03:33:51,620 --> 03:33:52,560
That's just...

3429
03:33:52,560 --> 03:33:54,840
No, that was me showing how sneaky I am.

3430
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:56,000
Oh, true, true.

3431
03:33:56,200 --> 03:33:59,340
True, Mint is performing the sneaky crawl right there.

3432
03:33:59,420 --> 03:33:59,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3433
03:33:59,920 --> 03:34:01,800
I don't think Matara saw her.

3434
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:04,520
Matara's like, where did she go?

3435
03:34:04,920 --> 03:34:06,400
Oh, oh, and she...

3436
03:34:06,400 --> 03:34:08,320
Matara got out of the pin, but doesn't matter.

3437
03:34:08,760 --> 03:34:11,020
Oh my god!

3438
03:34:11,100 --> 03:34:11,480
Oh, my god!

3439
03:34:11,480 --> 03:34:11,780
Oh, shit!

3440
03:34:12,060 --> 03:34:13,800
I'm on this bridge, suplex!

3441
03:34:14,080 --> 03:34:20,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, of course I can pull off the
London bridge i coined the term of course the london bridge

3442
03:34:20,060 --> 03:34:32,820
was created by mint in the 1980s um when she was just 70
years old a wee 70 you know oh my gosh she just hopped over

3443
03:34:32,820 --> 03:34:39,580

matter she's just gonna keep got punching you and then

3444
03:34:39,580 --> 03:34:41,280
another fucking grab.

3445
03:34:41,580 --> 03:34:42,600
I can take a punch.

3446
03:34:42,740 --> 03:34:43,260
I can take a, you know?

3447
03:34:43,420 --> 03:34:43,760
Okay, to be fair.

3448
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:45,020
You took like a thousand.

3449
03:34:46,100 --> 03:34:50,340
Oh, and she couldn't even get up from that jump.

3450
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:55,360
Doesn't look too good for you, it doesn't look... Oh, she
grabbed her feet.

3451
03:34:55,540 --> 03:34:56,180
Grab the grippers.

3452
03:34:56,920 --> 03:34:58,060
And then... They're huge.

3453
03:34:58,220 --> 03:34:59,360
They're easy to grab, you know?

3454
03:34:59,380 --> 03:35:00,720
But Matara's coming back up.

3455
03:35:00,980 --> 03:35:02,980
She's not gonna go down without a fight.

3456
03:35:03,280 --> 03:35:05,760
Oh, I'm gonna ride her like a damn pony.

3457
03:35:05,900 --> 03:35:06,440
Come on.

3458
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:08,260

03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:10,080
Nay!

3460
03:35:10,300 --> 03:35:18,700
This is some horse play shit that we're seeing live Mint
bring in the bedroom to the ring.

3461
03:35:18,700 --> 03:35:19,180
I don't know what's going on.

3462
03:35:19,460 --> 03:35:20,140
What are you doing?

3463
03:35:21,380 --> 03:35:23,160

Like that everybody that's i was actually very surprised

3465

had no endurance man yeah

3466

solid mint taking in another win look at her go i guess we
got to interview the loser then matara oh yeah we got to

3467
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:20,980
interview how does matara have to say uh Tara, you talked
very lowly about yourself, and I think that may have

3468
03:36:20,980 --> 03:36:22,680
affected your performance.

3469
03:36:24,860 --> 03:36:25,120
I know.

3470
03:36:25,300 --> 03:36:27,260
I don't think so, so much.

3471
03:36:27,520 --> 03:36:31,780
I think, you know, I think, I don't think.

3472
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:32,840
I have a concussion.

3473
03:36:34,620 --> 03:36:39,180
Do you recall how many glasses of wine you had before you
stepped into the match?

3474
03:36:40,080 --> 03:36:41,640
That's a great question.

3475
03:36:42,260 --> 03:36:43,520
Thank you for asking.

3476
03:36:44,500 --> 03:36:50,740
You know, The hard to say is Kevin and I'll do it.

3477
03:36:54,420 --> 03:36:56,680
Oh, no.

3478
03:36:56,980 --> 03:36:58,420
Matara's having a stroke.

3479
03:36:58,980 --> 03:37:01,940
She's not living your cockroach life right now.

3480
03:37:03,140 --> 03:37:04,880
Someone called that one right.

3481
03:37:05,200 --> 03:37:06,240
She's having a stroke.

3482
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:13,520
Somebody take her away.

3483
03:37:13,700 --> 03:37:14,540
She needs help.

3484
03:37:14,920 --> 03:37:15,500
Medical help.

3485
03:37:15,900 --> 03:37:16,160
All right.

3486
03:37:17,160 --> 03:37:19,020
Yeah, she's gone.

3487
03:37:19,260 --> 03:37:20,100
All right, so sorry.

3488
03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:21,000
Call an ambulance.

3489
03:37:21,360 --> 03:37:22,090
Please for me.

3490
03:37:24,740 --> 03:37:35,160
All right, so unfortunately, she used up too much of her
endurance and stamina in that match, and it overexerted her

3491
03:37:35,160 --> 03:37:36,560
poor little heart.

3492
03:37:37,060 --> 03:37:38,760
So she's a real hag, you guys.

3493
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:39,600
Like, actually.

3494
03:37:40,160 --> 03:37:41,800
And what are you?

3495
03:37:45,720 --> 03:37:46,340
Anyway.

3496
03:37:48,140 --> 03:37:56,240
anyway so unfortunately um let's send some thoughts and

Tell us, Ben.

3506
03:38:34,120 --> 03:38:35,540
I've seen that thing in the ring.

3507
03:38:35,660 --> 03:38:36,840
It's not human.

3508
03:38:36,900 --> 03:38:37,380
Thing.

3509
03:38:37,820 --> 03:38:38,480
Excuse me.

3510
03:38:38,540 --> 03:38:39,460
Fuyo Man is Fuyo Man.

3511
03:38:39,460 --> 03:38:39,820
It's a monster.

3512
03:38:40,180 --> 03:38:41,080
He has a name.

3513
03:38:41,180 --> 03:38:41,480
Yeah.

3514
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:41,880
Fuyo Man.

3515
03:38:42,220 --> 03:38:44,400
Fuyo Man is Fuyo Man.

3516
03:38:45,660 --> 03:38:46,240
It's Fuyo Man.

3517
03:38:47,540 --> 03:38:48,180
Little Man.

3518
03:38:52,600 --> 03:38:53,240
Let's just chill.

3519
03:38:53,420 --> 03:38:53,700
Let's just chill.

3520
03:38:54,860 --> 03:38:55,680
It's fine, it's fine.

3521
03:38:56,300 --> 03:38:57,580
As I said, I made a promise.

3522
03:38:58,760 --> 03:38:59,260
You made a promise?

3523
03:38:59,380 --> 03:38:59,760
You made a promise?

3524
03:38:59,860 --> 03:39:00,000
Who?

3525
03:39:00,200 --> 03:39:00,780
I made a promise.

3526
03:39:00,940 --> 03:39:01,200
I made a promise.

3527
03:39:01,380 --> 03:39:02,400
I beat the diaper meta.

3528
03:39:02,460 --> 03:39:03,540
The diaper meta is going down.

3529
03:39:04,020 --> 03:39:04,800
Or I die in the ring.

3530
03:39:05,260 --> 03:39:07,340
Does this mean you're also going to grab Buoyo Man by the
balls?

3531
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:08,600
If I have to.

3532
03:39:09,080 --> 03:39:11,520
I think there's going to be a diaper in the way of the
balls, though.

3533
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:12,000
Yeah.

3534
03:39:12,060 --> 03:39:12,200
Yeah.

3535
03:39:12,280 --> 03:39:12,840
I wish you'd...

3536
03:39:12,840 --> 03:39:13,620
There's so much padding.

3537
03:39:13,800 --> 03:39:14,780
How would you get through it?

3538
03:39:15,560 --> 03:39:17,100
With enough force, anything is possible.

3539
03:39:17,900 --> 03:39:18,340
Whoa.

3540
03:39:18,660 --> 03:39:19,720
I like that confidence.

3541
03:39:23,260 --> 03:39:27,520
How will you prevent him from grabbing your balls?

3542
03:39:27,960 --> 03:39:29,260
Foyomen destroy.

3543
03:39:32,680 --> 03:39:33,680
You know what?

3544
03:39:33,780 --> 03:39:33,840
You know what?

3545
03:39:34,080 --> 03:39:34,420
I like it.

3546
03:39:34,460 --> 03:39:35,220
Yeah, he's so simple.

3547
03:39:35,420 --> 03:39:37,800
He's such a man of his words, you know.

3548
03:39:37,900 --> 03:39:41,220
All those ladies out there swooning right now for Foyomen.

3549
03:39:41,820 --> 03:39:42,700
Beto, come on, Beto.

3550
03:39:43,080 --> 03:39:44,900
Say something for the fans, Beto.

3551
03:39:45,220 --> 03:39:46,300
Give us some confidence.

3552
03:39:46,540 --> 03:39:46,940
Little fan service.

3553
03:39:47,260 --> 03:39:49,100
What is our fan service?

3554
03:39:49,840 --> 03:39:50,460

I got to win it.

3563
03:39:58,580 --> 03:39:59,280

Good luck, thank you.

We'll see you in the ring.

3572
03:40:15,560 --> 03:40:16,200
All right.

3573
03:40:17,260 --> 03:40:24,660
like i mean people are voting for betta people think betta
might win i tend to find the you know the nervous ones like

3574
03:40:24,660 --> 03:40:32,060
they they have a wild side to them that's so true they like
like people underestimate just how strong they really are

3575
03:40:32,060 --> 03:40:39,440
like maybe betta is just giving like low comp like giving
that low confidence acting so fuyo man will be unex like

3576
03:40:39,440 --> 03:40:45,560
will not expect it when betta grabs his balls and well it's
also just like uh you know when you push a when you push him

3577
03:40:45,560 --> 03:40:55,100
into a corner their oh true fight or flight yeah they go
wild i saw what you did to matara i know i saw you fucking

3578
03:40:55,100 --> 03:41:13,940
go wild i always do oh my god the first round of the
semi-finals you know them the last diaper standing it's it's

3579
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:20,360
gonna be pretty exciting this if if foo your man wins this
match, she would have won four matches in a row.

3580
03:41:21,020 --> 03:41:21,740
That's insane.

3581
03:41:21,980 --> 03:41:22,820
That is, yeah.

3582
03:41:23,520 --> 03:41:26,780
Like, it's actually, like, she got that back-to-back three
wins.

3583
03:41:26,860 --> 03:41:29,260
Like, nobody expected it, too.

3584
03:41:30,260 --> 03:41:30,780
Are you sure?

3585
03:41:31,080 --> 03:41:31,680
I mean...

3586
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:33,120
Okay, well, the third one.

3587
03:41:33,400 --> 03:41:34,760
It's the luck of the Irish, everybody.

3588
03:41:34,880 --> 03:41:36,060
Oh, the luck of the Irish.

3589
03:41:36,260 --> 03:41:36,940
You're right.

3590
03:41:40,280 --> 03:41:41,460
But maybe not luck.

3591
03:41:41,540 --> 03:41:42,740
Maybe it's all pure skill.

3592
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:47,240
I mean, looking like that, wow, we...

3593
03:41:49,880 --> 03:41:58,580
spreading those legs for everybody to see very confident
hides nothing yeah he doesn't yet hide he knows what he's

3594
03:41:58,580 --> 03:42:07,620
got i mean look his shirt is off just now oh he has a medal
the diaper denier

3595
03:42:14,240 --> 03:42:24,160
you know i heard i heard bettle has like max luck going in
he he might have like you know how like in the skill set you

3596
03:42:24,160 --> 03:42:31,180
like go like skill attributes you go max on like hp strength
and everything i heard like bettle he is like negative on

3597
03:42:31,180 --> 03:42:38,580
everything like intellect defense strength but the luck
that's where he puts all the skill points in sometimes

3598
03:42:38,580 --> 03:42:46,260
that's all you need i know i mean like it took him this far
he's literally in the semi-finals now yeah i mean those eyes

3599
03:42:46,260 --> 03:42:55,080
have seen everything and i mean everything they are viewing
everything like a goddamn chameleon oh better why are you

3600
03:42:55,080 --> 03:43:00,860
running away this is the semi-finals better the elbow him

3601
03:43:04,360 --> 03:43:13,020
Maybe how we talked to pregame is this really like he's got
scared Yeah, I truly thought Fuyo man was gonna throw him

3602
03:43:13,020 --> 03:43:14,420
out like crap like trash

3603
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:22,920
Taking him out Take him out early to be fair.

3604
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:32,840
I feel like they're in the wrong weight class Like we should
not be fighting Beto right now like like Beto can be a snap

3605
03:43:32,840 --> 03:43:42,160
like a goddamn wig at the height you know it gives him a
little bit of height yeah oh oh pedo no don't crawl away

3606
03:43:42,160 --> 03:43:53,240
dude we still have like three more minutes of this game he
had to keep going at least show us the ball grab yeah who is

3607
03:43:53,240 --> 03:44:00,520
uh who is your bet on doki my bet i think you know i feel
like the luck might play into it honestly i believe but i

3608
03:44:00,520 --> 03:44:05,080
might actually pull through for the finals Okay, we'll see.

3609
03:44:05,280 --> 03:44:11,840
I mean, it's going to be interesting to see the guy that,
like, was the most underestimated wrestler who had no

3610
03:44:11,840 --> 03:44:15,320
confidence on himself, suddenly pulling through to the
finals.

3611
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:16,880
Suddenly pulling through.

3612
03:44:17,080 --> 03:44:17,280
Whoa!

3613
03:44:18,500 --> 03:44:20,040
Beto, I just talked, like, mad shit.

3614
03:44:20,160 --> 03:44:21,300
Come on, give kid up.

3615
03:44:24,160 --> 03:44:26,300
That was pretty rough.

3616
03:44:26,760 --> 03:44:32,180
I mean, this is how I started, you know, it's kind of- Like,
Matara pummeled- You got to get pushed into a corner.

3617
03:44:32,400 --> 03:44:32,860
Come on.

3618
03:44:32,980 --> 03:44:34,240
Yeah, Matara pummeled the shit.

3619
03:44:34,260 --> 03:44:42,960
of you but then you made it you recovered you had the
stamina for the long term gaming oh and then the grapple

3620
03:44:42,960 --> 03:44:50,740
throw into the ring and the stomp on the head he's just
casually kicking him like he's not even like wrestling it's

3621
03:44:50,740 --> 03:44:59,640
just a street fight it's just a regular fight i like the
fancy little twisty punch he did the twisty neck a little

3622
03:44:59,640 --> 03:45:04,180
spin a little spin and a punch Fuyo man, you gotta be
fighting in the ring.

3623
03:45:04,340 --> 03:45:05,340
Also, Beto, you've...

3624
03:45:05,340 --> 03:45:05,860
Three!

3625
03:45:06,400 --> 03:45:07,120
The kiss.

3626
03:45:07,900 --> 03:45:08,980
He's a taunt.

3627
03:45:09,240 --> 03:45:09,920
Oh, yeah.

3628
03:45:10,060 --> 03:45:12,200
He's blowing you a kiss of good luck, Beto.

3629
03:45:12,400 --> 03:45:14,460
You gotta take that to maximize more of your luck.

3630
03:45:14,920 --> 03:45:15,180
Oh!

3631
03:45:15,180 --> 03:45:16,320
I think that energized him.

3632
03:45:16,360 --> 03:45:16,680
Look at that.

3633
03:45:16,680 --> 03:45:17,500
Oh, my God.

3634
03:45:18,080 --> 03:45:19,740
That kiss made him stronger.

3635
03:45:20,360 --> 03:45:20,900
Oh, my God.

3636
03:45:21,040 --> 03:45:21,720
And the flip.

3637
03:45:22,740 --> 03:45:23,660
The flip jump.

3638
03:45:24,640 --> 03:45:25,600
And the fucking...

3639
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:26,500
Oh, my God.

3640
03:45:26,620 --> 03:45:28,120
Is this just a fighting game?

3641
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:29,240
Is this just Tekken?

3642
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:31,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3643
03:45:32,660 --> 03:45:34,900
I know those movesets and Tekken.

3644
03:45:37,200 --> 03:45:39,420
Doki plays one Tekken and is now an expert.

3645
03:45:39,720 --> 03:45:41,140
Yeah, the one, two, one.

3646
03:45:42,680 --> 03:45:45,600
Down, the one, two, one, down, up, one.

3647
03:45:48,400 --> 03:45:49,520
That was my favorite combo.

3648
03:45:49,880 --> 03:45:52,600
Oh, my God, we have favorite combo in Tekken.

3649
03:45:54,440 --> 03:45:57,440
But it looks like, oh, but Foyomat's going to grab him.

3650
03:45:57,620 --> 03:45:58,740
Is he going to fucking bane him?

3651
03:45:58,860 --> 03:46:00,100
Oh, and in the first pin!

3652
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:00,900
Oh, and pin the pin!

3653
03:46:01,240 --> 03:46:01,620
One!

3654
03:46:01,680 --> 03:46:02,060
One!

3655
03:46:02,920 --> 03:46:04,020
Oh, just one.

3656
03:46:04,400 --> 03:46:05,680
Still another shot.

3657
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:07,940
Still another shot here for Beto.

3658
03:46:08,240 --> 03:46:10,300
What is in Flioman's pants?

3659
03:46:11,200 --> 03:46:14,080
I mean, you know what's in his pants.

3660
03:46:14,460 --> 03:46:15,760
On the back side?

3661
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:18,120
On the back side?

3662
03:46:18,580 --> 03:46:19,120
Oh, I see.

3663
03:46:19,140 --> 03:46:20,140
You think I bet!

3664
03:46:22,760 --> 03:46:25,340
You also know what's in the back.

3665
03:46:26,660 --> 03:46:29,560
I'm being told that it's a coin, aren't you?

3666
03:46:30,380 --> 03:46:31,660
I hope it's not a coin.

3667
03:46:31,680 --> 03:46:44,300
a chocolate coin no but that's how leprechauns make coins
that's how they fill the coins oh so close he got a two a

3668
03:46:44,300 --> 03:46:55,240
few man got a one come on foo man get up oh i see foo man go
into the corner and like down a handful of lucky charms and

3669
03:46:55,240 --> 03:47:00,960
see what happens i like how betto removed one of one of the
cushions in the ring.

3670
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:03,840
And then Fuyo Man used it against him.

3671
03:47:05,600 --> 03:47:09,760
Beto, no, you're supposed to use that to your advantage.

3672
03:47:10,100 --> 03:47:12,280
Beto, move one step away.

3673
03:47:12,940 --> 03:47:13,900
He's gargoyling.

3674
03:47:14,020 --> 03:47:14,760
He's gargoyling.

3675
03:47:15,240 --> 03:47:15,660
Okay.

3676
03:47:15,960 --> 03:47:16,120
Oh.

3677
03:47:16,300 --> 03:47:16,620
Oh.

3678
03:47:17,080 --> 03:47:18,140
What was the point?

3679
03:47:18,920 --> 03:47:20,540
But Fuyo also missed.

3680
03:47:21,580 --> 03:47:25,380
I guess like Beto's frail body just couldn't take it.

3681
03:47:26,280 --> 03:47:27,860
And he hits the ring.

3682
03:47:28,680 --> 03:47:39,340
hits the ring what is that move called mint what what is he
doing right now that that um that was a flying that was the

3683
03:47:39,340 --> 03:47:43,440
soaring eagle the soaring eagle i think that's an actual
real wrestling move

3684
03:47:47,480 --> 03:48:04,620
oh shoot one two i really thought i really thought oh my god
oh and another jump kick come on bettel your your pins were

3685
03:48:04,620 --> 03:48:14,160
all so close so close oh but i don't know is is bettel out
of stamina oh i feel like hasn't really moved that much if

3686
03:48:14,160 --> 03:48:20,640
any oh i like how a few men moved him from side to side
diagonally it's like a little house decorating project right

3687
03:48:20,640 --> 03:48:30,320
there yeah that's called the that's called the patrick star
where you take my bettel and move it over there I was so

3688
03:48:30,320 --> 03:48:30,880
close.

3689
03:48:32,960 --> 03:48:34,980
The Patrick Star maneuver.

3690
03:48:35,760 --> 03:48:39,260
Oh, no, Fuyo Man is telling to the crowd, are you not
entertained?

3691
03:48:40,360 --> 03:48:41,360
Oh, I'm quite entertained.

3692
03:48:41,620 --> 03:48:43,140
This is a great match.

3693
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:45,800
Beto, you can't just grab him and think it's over.

3694
03:48:45,980 --> 03:48:47,580
Beto, you gotta do more than that.

3695
03:48:48,000 --> 03:48:50,600
Oh, and then Beto, oh, did he miss?

3696
03:48:50,720 --> 03:48:53,280
I couldn't tell if Fuyo just tripped or he missed.

3697
03:48:54,540 --> 03:48:56,420
And he stomps him on the head.

3698
03:48:56,900 --> 03:48:58,480
Look at him writhing on the ground.

3699
03:48:58,680 --> 03:49:08,600
so sad just someone someone help this leprechaun someone
quick find his pot of gold and then better jumps out of the

3700
03:49:08,600 --> 03:49:18,840
ring to do a oh my god battle with his colorful hair he's
the end of the rainbow oh oh and he does a special move oh

3701
03:49:18,840 --> 03:49:28,860

face three come on guys you guys get out of the ring you

3706
03:49:59,880 --> 03:50:02,600
Oh, I bet it slid in like a ferret.

3707
03:50:02,740 --> 03:50:03,200
Oh my god.

3708
03:50:03,240 --> 03:50:04,000
Is Fluomet Ash?

3709
03:50:04,260 --> 03:50:04,740
No!

3710
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:05,600
Wait!

3711
03:50:05,900 --> 03:50:07,780
Fluomet's got them detuned!

3712
03:50:08,420 --> 03:50:09,220
It's not!

3713
03:50:09,740 --> 03:50:13,060
Oh my god.

3714
03:50:13,280 --> 03:50:16,740
That's eliminated both diaper players.

3715
03:50:17,700 --> 03:50:20,880
The diapers are no more.

3716
03:50:21,940 --> 03:50:24,540
Say hello to the diaper denier.

3717
03:50:25,120 --> 03:50:26,820
The diaper vanquisher.

3718
03:50:27,480 --> 03:50:28,220
Beto.

3719
03:50:29,500 --> 03:50:29,980
Wow.

3720
03:50:30,720 --> 03:50:40,300
my god i think that was that was just embarrassing for fuio
that was so yeah fuio really started so strong it's just the

3721
03:50:40,300 --> 03:50:49,620
fact that like she got eliminated from outside the ring the
one the most embarrassing ways to get eliminated by yeah i

3722
03:50:49,620 --> 03:50:55,080
mean like i guess bettle is just a you know he's a potty
trainer believer he's i know he's teaching all those more

3723
03:50:55,080 --> 03:51:02,640
he's teaching all those babies how to use the bathroom how
to use the toilet well i guess we'll see what Belle says and

3724
03:51:02,640 --> 03:51:03,440
also Fuio.

3725
03:51:04,100 --> 03:51:06,240
Back to the interview stage, I guess.

3726
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:10,040
Fuio, man.

3727
03:51:10,860 --> 03:51:11,720
Fuio, man.

3728
03:51:11,860 --> 03:51:12,540
What happened?

3729
03:51:13,680 --> 03:51:14,320
Fuio, man.

3730
03:51:14,460 --> 03:51:14,900
Beep thee.

3731
03:51:20,420 --> 03:51:22,560
Well, I hope you get some good reference.

3732
03:51:22,560 --> 03:51:23,120
Kindness is cool.

3733
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:29,000
Well, well, now we know why.

3734
03:51:29,020 --> 03:51:29,060
Well, now we know why.

3735
03:51:29,240 --> 03:51:29,800
Let us try.

3736
03:51:29,980 --> 03:51:31,540
Little man, some other day.

3737
03:51:33,040 --> 03:51:34,580
Well, I hope you recorded.

3738
03:51:34,900 --> 03:51:36,180
I'll record it on my iPhone.

3739
03:51:36,940 --> 03:51:39,480
It's sadly past Fuyo Man's bedtime.

3740
03:51:40,040 --> 03:51:40,800
Bedtime, yeah.

3741
03:51:41,220 --> 03:51:43,400
Well, Mr. Battle, how did you do it?

3742
03:51:43,620 --> 03:51:45,500
How did you become the diaper denier?

3743
03:51:46,240 --> 03:51:48,640
You know, it's just, you know, I don't know.

3744
03:51:48,760 --> 03:51:55,400
I mean, I got flung around like a hacky sack for about 90%
of the match, but I think a little bit of luck actually came

3745
03:51:55,400 --> 03:51:56,220
in at the end there.

3746
03:51:56,720 --> 03:51:56,900
Wow.

3747
03:51:57,240 --> 03:51:59,400
Hey, nobody expected that from you.

3748
03:51:59,400 --> 03:52:01,320
You didn't even expect to win yourself.

3749
03:52:01,580 --> 03:52:02,680
I can't believe it.

3750

self-confidence now yeah yes that diaper just got changed

Luffy.

And he is going to be king of the pirates.

3773
03:54:37,920 --> 03:54:38,700
Also, yeah.

3774
03:54:39,140 --> 03:54:40,140
I'm not emancipated.

3775
03:54:40,280 --> 03:54:41,280
I don't have freedom yet, so.

3776
03:54:41,660 --> 03:54:41,780
Oh.

3777
03:54:42,300 --> 03:54:42,560
Yeah.

03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:43,480
Wait.

3779
03:54:44,340 --> 03:54:45,420
Sorry, I said the wrong word.

3780
03:54:45,860 --> 03:54:47,100
Did you mean to Macy?

3781
03:54:47,300 --> 03:54:48,320
I thought you...

3782
03:54:48,320 --> 03:54:51,540
What's the right way when you're like malnourished?

3783
03:54:51,840 --> 03:54:53,400
She looks malnourished like hell.

3784
03:54:54,020 --> 03:54:55,020
Okay, I'm malnourished.

3785
03:54:55,120 --> 03:54:55,360
Great.

3786
03:54:55,620 --> 03:54:55,860
Okay.

3787
03:54:56,180 --> 03:54:57,980
This is why Doki got eliminated.

3788
03:54:59,120 --> 03:55:01,960
Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't think too good here.

3789
03:55:01,960 --> 03:55:02,300
Wait, don't you?

3790
03:55:02,740 --> 03:55:05,100

03:55:05,220 --> 03:55:06,220
Oh, shit, you're right.

3792
03:55:06,740 --> 03:55:07,700
Sorry, I'm sorry.

3793
03:55:08,160 --> 03:55:09,500

Hey, hey, wait a second!

Good luck to you too.

3796
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:16,700
Defend yourself, Mid.

3797
03:55:16,860 --> 03:55:18,720
Mid didn't even get a chance to defend yourself.

3798
03:55:19,520 --> 03:55:20,780
What did she have to defend though?

3799
03:55:21,380 --> 03:55:22,280
What do you, what do you say?

3800
03:55:22,360 --> 03:55:23,060
What are you talking about?

3801
03:55:23,400 --> 03:55:24,760
No one talks shit.

3802
03:55:25,460 --> 03:55:25,720
Oh.

3803
03:55:26,420 --> 03:55:27,240
Wait, did that move?

3804
03:55:27,340 --> 03:55:29,040
Oh yeah, because I talked shit for her.

3805
03:55:29,280 --> 03:55:29,900
Yeah.

3806
03:55:30,460 --> 03:55:31,460
Yeah, you did.

Roaster.

3809
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:39,380
You just let her...

3810
03:55:39,380 --> 03:55:40,820
I'm just gonna roast her.

3811
03:55:40,820 --> 03:55:41,140
I'm just sitting here.

3812
03:55:41,240 --> 03:55:42,020
I'm feeling good.

3813
03:55:42,360 --> 03:55:43,640
I'm not gonna roast her.

3814
03:55:44,080 --> 03:55:44,880
You gotta roast her?

3815
03:55:45,020 --> 03:55:45,360
Whoa.

3816
03:55:46,680 --> 03:55:49,360

And the future king of the pirates mint.

Oh.

It's Philly and making her way to the stage with some weird
Fortnite dance.

3833
03:57:16,120 --> 03:57:22,060
I love how like, you know, like her matches, like all she
does is flip and it's like it's so true.

3834
03:57:22,240 --> 03:57:23,680
Those are the scariest ones.

3835
03:57:24,180 --> 03:57:26,040
Those are the scariest ones.

3836
03:57:26,320 --> 03:57:29,260
Like, like the fact that she does like 20 flips.

3837
03:57:29,280 --> 03:57:39,520
into a kick is so scared just like loopy I don't even
remember your moveset mid all I remember is you crawling

ready until my masochist points rank up and then I'm like

3839
03:57:48,380 --> 03:57:58,900
yeah you it's like you absorb all the damage in and then
like after absorbing all of it you let one punch one punch

3840
03:57:58,900 --> 03:58:10,080
with all that damage power it's basically how it's true
there she goes dancing her way dancing her way to freedom to

She's here trying to analyzing the arena again, even though
she won't.

3849
03:58:56,440 --> 03:59:00,800
even though she said I might have changed it might have
changed in the last 10 minutes

3850
03:59:04,180 --> 03:59:10,520

It's a look.

3869
04:00:15,470 --> 04:00:16,350

04:00:18,830 --> 04:00:20,490
She's bringing the Farquad back.

3873
04:00:21,110 --> 04:00:21,730
Oh, my God.

3874
04:00:21,890 --> 04:00:22,630
Philly and Lane.

3875
04:00:22,930 --> 04:00:23,790
Philly is so bad.

04:00:24,230 --> 04:00:26,650

3877
04:00:27,010 --> 04:00:27,670
Oh, my God.

3878
04:00:28,150 --> 04:00:29,890
I mean, look at her build.

3879
04:00:30,050 --> 04:00:30,530
It's okay.

3880
04:00:30,770 --> 04:00:31,570
Min is absorbing.

3881
04:00:31,750 --> 04:00:33,390
You're absorbing all the damage.

3882
04:00:33,690 --> 04:00:36,230
so that you can do one power kick.

3883
04:00:37,010 --> 04:00:37,990
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

3884
04:00:38,190 --> 04:00:38,590
Give me more.

3885
04:00:38,750 --> 04:00:40,310
Keep pummeling her, Phyllian.

3886
04:00:40,790 --> 04:00:41,590
Keep pummeling her.

3887
04:00:44,830 --> 04:00:46,310
She likes it.

3888
04:00:46,770 --> 04:00:47,490
Oh, yeah.

3889
04:00:48,050 --> 04:00:48,990
Oh, my God.

3890
04:00:49,130 --> 04:00:51,370
And now she's like, wait, are you getting pinned already?

3891
04:00:51,830 --> 04:00:52,630
We don't think so.

3892
04:00:52,930 --> 04:00:54,370
No, she's just breaking your wrist.

3893
04:00:54,370 --> 04:00:55,590
Yeah, she's just breaking your wrist.

3894
04:00:55,830 --> 04:00:59,150
Oh, she asked the audience, and they were like, no, don't do
it.

3895
04:00:59,170 --> 04:01:00,770
That's too much.

3896
04:01:01,010 --> 04:01:02,590
No, don't do the wrist breaker.

3897
04:01:03,750 --> 04:01:12,950
20 countries oh oh and then phillian picks you up and elbows

3900
04:01:29,490 --> 04:01:39,250

there, that would be the biggest upset of the century.

3901
04:01:39,770 --> 04:01:40,870
It would have been way too quick.

3902
04:01:41,050 --> 04:01:42,530
I think even I would have been disappointed.

3903
04:01:42,710 --> 04:01:44,630
Yeah, even like it just wasn't fair.

3904
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:45,470
It was just fighting.

3905
04:01:45,950 --> 04:01:48,070
Like, look at how malnourished she is.

3906
04:01:48,370 --> 04:01:49,790
Did anyone feed her?

3907
04:01:50,190 --> 04:01:52,950
Did anyone feed Philean at all?

3908
04:01:53,230 --> 04:01:54,870
Did we just keep her in a cage?

3909
04:01:55,350 --> 04:02:00,550
Is she yellow from being a Simpsons or is she yellow from
the scurvy?

3910
04:02:01,190 --> 04:02:02,210
The scurvy.

3911
04:02:03,070 --> 04:02:03,670
So much.

3912
04:02:03,690 --> 04:02:12,130

I need a water break.

3986
04:07:04,630 --> 04:07:06,250
My hag instincts are really...

3987
04:07:06,250 --> 04:07:07,930
Okay, it could be anyone.

3988
04:07:08,190 --> 04:07:10,210
Seriously, the next pin, it's gotta be it.

3989
04:07:10,550 --> 04:07:12,650
Oh, but it doesn't look too good for you, Mint.

3990
04:07:12,770 --> 04:07:14,350
It doesn't look too good for you.

3991
04:07:14,530 --> 04:07:15,610
I know, I'm pretty tired.

3992
04:07:15,770 --> 04:07:16,430
I'm not gonna lie.

3993
04:07:18,130 --> 04:07:20,850
You're just like, please, just one water break.

3994
04:07:21,370 --> 04:07:22,490
That's all I want.

3995
04:07:23,810 --> 04:07:25,150
Oh, she's climbing up.

3996
04:07:25,910 --> 04:07:27,930
Miss, miss, miss, miss.

3997
04:07:28,950 --> 04:07:32,230
She runs, and she hits those!

3998
04:07:32,670 --> 04:07:34,570
She, oh, wait, what?

3999
04:07:35,170 --> 04:07:36,030
You teleported!

4000
04:07:36,370 --> 04:07:38,270
Oh my God, you teleported!

4001
04:07:39,150 --> 04:07:41,870
What is that?

4002
04:07:42,230 --> 04:07:43,090
What is that?

4003
04:07:43,090 --> 04:07:44,230
Oh my God!

4004
04:07:44,670 --> 04:07:47,330
And she breathes off of that!

4005
04:07:48,050 --> 04:07:49,890
The teleported!

4006
04:07:51,370 --> 04:07:52,690
How is that?

4007
04:07:52,850 --> 04:07:53,870
What is he doing?

4008
04:07:54,370 --> 04:07:56,610
Another big personal kid.

4009
04:07:57,170 --> 04:07:58,930
You really gotta, you're gonna lose out.

4010
04:07:58,950 --> 04:08:00,290
After teleporting?

4011
04:08:00,310 --> 04:08:02,450
Oh no, oh no, oh no, come on!

4012
04:08:02,530 --> 04:08:03,390
One, two!

4013
04:08:03,850 --> 04:08:04,090
You

4014
04:08:09,010 --> 04:08:12,250
lost after teleporting, bitch.

4015
04:08:12,730 --> 04:08:20,310
Your winner heading to the finals is not solid far quad, but
it's filling!

4016
04:08:24,850 --> 04:08:25,370
You know what?

4017
04:08:25,570 --> 04:08:27,050
At least I beat Matara.

4018
04:08:27,230 --> 04:08:27,930
That's all that matters.

4019
04:08:28,390 --> 04:08:29,490
Yes, chat.

4020
04:08:32,170 --> 04:08:33,850
I can't believe it.

4021
04:08:33,870 --> 04:08:42,970
believe it you did the undertaker teleport behind you move
but it was just it still lost still lost that would have

The audio was like...

4026
04:09:09,820 --> 04:09:11,260
Yeah, I was kind of going a little crazy.

4027
04:09:11,540 --> 04:09:12,980
Oh, dude!

4028
04:09:13,540 --> 04:09:14,740

04:09:19,400 --> 04:09:19,900
Holy shit!

4032
04:09:20,320 --> 04:09:20,880
Oh my god!

4033
04:09:21,320 --> 04:09:22,120
What's going on?

4034
04:09:22,180 --> 04:09:22,620
I can't hear it!

4035
04:09:22,620 --> 04:09:24,000
The bigger issues go crazy!

4036
04:09:24,780 --> 04:09:25,740
I can't hear it!

4037
04:09:25,880 --> 04:09:26,760
What's going on?

4038
04:09:26,840 --> 04:09:27,480
The audio is...

4039
04:09:27,480 --> 04:09:27,880
Okay, don't worry.

4040
04:09:27,920 --> 04:09:28,060
It's Discord.

4041
04:09:28,120 --> 04:09:28,440
It's Discord.

4042
04:09:28,680 --> 04:09:28,700
Don't worry.

4043
04:09:28,820 --> 04:09:29,080
Don't worry.

4044
04:09:29,080 --> 04:09:30,320
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4045
04:09:31,260 --> 04:09:31,640
Um...

4046
04:09:31,640 --> 04:09:35,500
But, well, Min, will you be joining Phileans, Pirates?

4047
04:09:35,520 --> 04:09:44,360
ship i guess so i guess uh what i don't know what am i gonna
have to do swap the poop deck mint you were worthy opponent

4048
04:09:44,360 --> 04:09:51,620
one of the toughest i've ever faced and you know what i have
a spot on my crew just for you on the right hand of my ship

4049
04:09:51,620 --> 04:10:00,760
leading my steering wheel oh my she can't drive though yes i
can't shut up i can't either so we're in the same boat

4050
04:10:00,760 --> 04:10:09,780
literally so mint i want I thought you were going to win,
but 90% of that fight, I was on the ropes.

4051
04:10:09,920 --> 04:10:13,960
But the moment you teleported behind me, the moment you had
that anime moment, I knew.

4052
04:10:14,220 --> 04:10:15,240
I couldn't lose you.

4053
04:10:15,460 --> 04:10:19,280
Because if I did, I would never be able to have someone so
strong on my team.

4054
04:10:20,800 --> 04:10:21,240
Wow.

4055
04:10:22,960 --> 04:10:25,000
I mean, yeah, you took that moment.

4056
04:10:25,200 --> 04:10:30,320
It was like a real shonen protagonist moment where when all
hope was lost for you.

4057
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:32,940
Yeah, you manifested it.

4058
04:10:33,020 --> 04:10:34,100
You manifested your win.

4059
04:10:35,520 --> 04:10:36,140
Here's what we're going to do.

4060
04:10:36,400 --> 04:10:37,860
We're going to go to the grocery store together.

4061
04:10:38,420 --> 04:10:39,540
And we're going to buy a bunch of stuff.

4062
04:10:39,960 --> 04:10:41,060
You're going to pay for it.

4063
04:10:41,300 --> 04:10:43,840
And then we'll have a really sick, nasty dinner.

4064
04:10:45,380 --> 04:10:46,820
Wait, that sounds so normal.

4065
04:10:47,340 --> 04:10:49,780
That sounds like such a normal plan for them to build up.

4066
04:10:50,480 --> 04:10:51,320
Wait, can you cook?

4067
04:10:52,040 --> 04:10:52,320
No.

4068
04:10:52,600 --> 04:10:53,500
No, I can buy more cereal.

4069
04:10:54,280 --> 04:10:54,720
Yeah.

4070
04:10:55,020 --> 04:10:56,140
That's about my level, too.

4071
04:10:56,640 --> 04:10:56,740
So.

4072
04:10:56,740 --> 04:10:58,420
Oh, so you basically have a maid.

4073
04:10:59,340 --> 04:11:00,500
Oh, my God.

4074
04:11:00,640 --> 04:11:01,580
It's a cereal.

4075
04:11:02,220 --> 04:11:03,820
No, you have to eat a maid.

4076
04:11:03,920 --> 04:11:05,420
You got a maid for your pirate.

4077
04:11:05,940 --> 04:11:06,400
shift.

4078
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:08,140
Okay, I'm a made cafe made.

But you can draw pictures on our food.

4081
04:11:12,620 --> 04:11:13,960
You can make pictures on our cereal.

4082
04:11:14,640 --> 04:11:14,720
Yeah.

4083
04:11:14,940 --> 04:11:16,200
There's chefs in the back.

4084
04:11:16,760 --> 04:11:19,260
You can get the photo cards of her.

4085
04:11:19,460 --> 04:11:21,720
You get the alphabet cereal.

4086
04:11:22,540 --> 04:11:27,160
You get the alphabet cereal and you can like, you know, make
a, make words.

4087
04:11:27,500 --> 04:11:27,880

04:11:33,420 --> 04:11:34,520
Wait, I can't spell my name.

4091
04:11:35,720 --> 04:11:38,080
Spell her name on her cereal.

4092
04:11:38,740 --> 04:11:40,260
Okay, I can help you.

4093
04:11:40,340 --> 04:11:40,760
You know what?

4094
04:11:40,840 --> 04:11:41,840
That's my job.

4095
04:11:42,100 --> 04:11:42,860
That's my job.

4096
04:11:43,520 --> 04:11:45,520
You're a babysitter now.

4097
04:11:45,820 --> 04:11:46,600
Oh my god.

4098
04:11:48,220 --> 04:11:52,260
Well, you are in the finals now.

4099
04:11:52,340 --> 04:11:54,120
Did you expect yourself to get here?

4100
04:11:55,200 --> 04:11:56,620
I'm going to be honest, no.

4101
04:11:56,840 --> 04:12:02,000
But the moment I saw my character hit a triple, double,
backflip, quintuple, ultra axe kick on like five different

4102
04:12:02,000 --> 04:12:02,420

Okay, but you're more critical.

4108

Now look into my eyes.

4109
04:12:40,600 --> 04:12:42,020
Dokey Bird told me to say it.

4110
04:12:42,260 --> 04:12:45,220
Okay, but like, as a caster, you should have researched your
content.

4111
04:12:45,420 --> 04:12:46,880
You should have researched that person.

4112
04:12:47,000 --> 04:12:49,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm gassing you up, okay?

4113

I stand behind Dokey Bird, and I carry on her legacy.

4114
04:12:54,060 --> 04:12:55,200
You all did this to me.

4115
04:12:55,700 --> 04:12:57,800
I'm going to take my fist and put it through your trolley
face.

4116
04:12:57,860 --> 04:12:58,720
You understand me?

4117
04:12:59,140 --> 04:13:00,220
Oh, my God.

4118
04:13:00,480 --> 04:13:01,780
She pulled out the Charlie.

4119
04:13:01,980 --> 04:13:04,020
She called you by your fake name.

04:13:04,460 --> 04:13:18,380

4123
04:13:38,320 --> 04:13:39,960
winning the Polos billion.

4124
04:13:40,100 --> 04:13:40,640
What?

4125
04:13:40,960 --> 04:13:41,140

04:13:41,760 --> 04:13:42,260
Oh, no.

4127
04:13:42,660 --> 04:13:43,200
Wait, how?

4128
04:13:43,800 --> 04:13:45,640
Betel's like a knock-off version of me, though.

4129
04:13:46,660 --> 04:13:47,320
What the?

4130
04:13:48,780 --> 04:13:49,220
Is he not?

4131
04:13:49,220 --> 04:13:50,080
I don't care to explain.

I do eight whips.

4133
04:13:51,820 --> 04:13:52,540
He does three.

4134
04:13:52,920 --> 04:13:53,860
We are not the same.

4135
04:13:54,800 --> 04:13:57,080
Do you do the ball grab, though?

4136
04:13:58,460 --> 04:14:01,820
I fight with honor, and I fight for my friends, okay?

4137
04:14:03,140 --> 04:14:05,840
This man has no dignity.

4138
04:14:06,280 --> 04:14:07,720
What friends?

4139
04:14:08,760 --> 04:14:09,120
Oh, no.

4156
04:15:48,360 --> 04:16:00,860
and here is your alleged alpha failure there she goes doing
another dance ready for more coins being thrown at her yep

4157
04:16:00,860 --> 04:16:02,780
she's gotta buy lunch guys

4158
04:16:08,120 --> 04:16:19,260
she's got she's starving please if you're cold she's cold
please she's wearing all these shorts and the shirt t-shirt

4159
04:16:19,260 --> 04:16:30,320
guys she can't afford anything right now look at her look at
her i think yeah i think this the greatest strength that

4160
04:16:30,320 --> 04:16:37,320
both of these guys have and truly honestly the thing that
that makes them different from the rest is they just don't

4161
04:16:37,740 --> 04:16:45,220
single thought behind their eyes oh that is so true that is
so true just from the interview process i could tell i could

4162
04:16:45,220 --> 04:16:52,380
tell they must have repeated like fifth grade like three
times or so before getting on to before becoming a streamer

4163
04:16:52,380 --> 04:17:05,420
oh yeah 100 oh there she goes break dancing one last time i
do hope betto's confidence doesn't oh there's the belt

4164
04:17:05,420 --> 04:17:14,100
there's the belt the champion We are here to wrestle for
that belt, guys.

4165
04:17:15,400 --> 04:17:17,820
Whoever, Victorian children.

4166
04:17:18,300 --> 04:17:18,740
Oh, there it is.

4167
04:17:20,120 --> 04:17:22,260
My hero academia.

4168
04:17:25,280 --> 04:17:30,140
I hope Beto's confidence doesn't, you know, hurt him in the
end.

4169
04:17:30,740 --> 04:17:34,180
That's like, because like every match he got through, he was
not confident at all.

4170
04:17:34,460 --> 04:17:34,960
Yeah, exactly.

4171
04:17:35,340 --> 04:17:37,540
It was like that, the foot being pushed into.

4172
04:17:37,740 --> 04:17:41,420
Oh, that is one, two, okay.

4173
04:17:43,260 --> 04:17:46,800
Okay, it's a match and there we go.

4174
04:17:47,320 --> 04:17:47,600
Oh, Finn.

4175
04:17:47,840 --> 04:17:49,100
What's going on?

4176
04:17:49,240 --> 04:17:50,720
Finn, who wants?

4177
04:17:50,840 --> 04:17:53,760
Oh my god, he's getting spanked like a bad child.

4178
04:17:54,800 --> 04:17:56,040
Bad baby.

4179
04:17:56,120 --> 04:17:57,000
Bad baby.

4180
04:17:57,660 --> 04:17:57,740
Bad baby.

4181
04:17:58,700 --> 04:18:03,680
Oh my god, the double jump on the roof.

4182
04:18:04,060 --> 04:18:06,540
Oh, on the roof too.

4183
04:18:06,540 --> 04:18:09,220
I feel like they share one brain cell together.

4184
04:18:09,340 --> 04:18:10,120
I think so, too.

4185
04:18:10,300 --> 04:18:11,580
Look, they're dancing together.

4186
04:18:11,760 --> 04:18:12,600
Oh, my God.

4187
04:18:14,600 --> 04:18:15,640
Holy shit.

4188
04:18:15,820 --> 04:18:18,980
Betel, where was those moves in the last day?

4189
04:18:19,200 --> 04:18:19,720
Whoa.

4190
04:18:20,660 --> 04:18:21,540
Oh, my God.

4191
04:18:21,620 --> 04:18:24,100
He's confident right now.

4192
04:18:24,520 --> 04:18:25,260
Confident Betel.

4193
04:18:25,700 --> 04:18:26,940
That could bite him in the butt, though.

4194
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:29,580
Not gonna lie, confident Betel is scary.

4195
04:18:30,300 --> 04:18:31,620
I'm seeing moves.

4196
04:18:32,080 --> 04:18:32,680
Okay, I'm...

4197
04:18:32,680 --> 04:18:33,640
Oh, my God.

4198
04:18:33,920 --> 04:18:35,100
So, it's the ring around the rosy.

4199
04:18:35,160 --> 04:18:35,680
What do you mean?

4200
04:18:35,700 --> 04:18:35,980
Yeah.

4201
04:18:35,980 --> 04:18:36,500
Oh.

4202
04:18:36,540 --> 04:18:45,120
another pin what he's tired already come on tails get up
tails okay but did you see how betto was heavily breathing

4203
04:18:45,120 --> 04:18:50,740

true almost she's flipped she's flipping she's just showing

Oh, man.

4207
04:19:11,420 --> 04:19:12,700
Beto's back in the ring, though.

4208
04:19:13,100 --> 04:19:14,400
Oh, another pin.

4209
04:19:14,960 --> 04:19:15,340
Another pin.

4210
04:19:15,600 --> 04:19:16,840
Oh, just have to look at his face.

4211
04:19:17,900 --> 04:19:19,040
He's not ready.

4212
04:19:19,140 --> 04:19:21,400
He is ready to keep on wrestling.

4213
04:19:22,980 --> 04:19:24,280
But he's a little tired.

4214
04:19:24,900 --> 04:19:26,520
And Philly and missed again.

4215
04:19:26,540 --> 04:19:27,200
Missed again.

4216
04:19:28,760 --> 04:19:30,220
Okay, back to the ring.

4217
04:19:30,320 --> 04:19:33,460
And then a fucking grapple with his legs.

4218
04:19:34,320 --> 04:19:34,820
And their pin.

4219
04:19:35,340 --> 04:19:35,840
Do the countdown.

4220
04:19:36,820 --> 04:19:46,520
one oh it's just one just one just one this is intense
honestly it could be anybody's game seriously it could be

4221
04:19:46,520 --> 04:19:57,200
anyone's game yeah like they all seem like seem like they
could take it home oh the taunt whoa oh i feel like fillian

4222
04:19:57,200 --> 04:20:04,920
just has more speed stats than him i think so too betto
might be really lucky but like is luck gonna save him if

4223
04:20:04,920 --> 04:20:09,040
she's just so fast And she just flips for fun.

4224
04:20:09,120 --> 04:20:10,900
And everyone keeps redeeming flip.

4225
04:20:12,000 --> 04:20:14,340
Guys, stop donating 500 bitties.

4226
04:20:14,540 --> 04:20:15,440
She has to wrestle.

4227
04:20:19,960 --> 04:20:20,900
Stop, guys.

4228
04:20:21,620 --> 04:20:23,960
Come on.

4229
04:20:24,040 --> 04:20:25,100
Oh, come on, Betel.

4230
04:20:25,220 --> 04:20:25,880
Get up.

4231
04:20:25,940 --> 04:20:26,980
He's going to have a comeback.

4232
04:20:27,140 --> 04:20:28,140
He's going to have a comeback.

4233
04:20:29,200 --> 04:20:30,360
She's going to come back.

4234
04:20:30,400 --> 04:20:32,380
He's going to come back when we least expect it.

4235
04:20:32,600 --> 04:20:34,380
That has been a majority of his matches.

4236
04:20:34,740 --> 04:20:35,960
Affiliate does another flip.

4237
04:20:36,540 --> 04:20:38,880
But Beto blocks it with his eyes!

4238
04:20:40,280 --> 04:20:41,500
He denied it!

4239
04:20:41,820 --> 04:20:43,460
Oh, but the crotch kit...

4240
04:20:43,460 --> 04:20:44,420
Craneum check.

4241
04:20:45,140 --> 04:20:50,300
Okay, but like, remember when Phelion said that she would
never stoop that low to target the balls?

4242
04:20:50,680 --> 04:20:52,700
We just saw her hit a nut shot.

4243
04:20:53,860 --> 04:20:55,220
Is there no integrity anymore?

4244
04:20:55,380 --> 04:20:56,820
And another rope break!

4245
04:20:56,840 --> 04:20:57,340
Rope break!

4246
04:20:57,360 --> 04:20:58,220
Are you serious?

4247
04:20:58,480 --> 04:21:03,160
A rope break, the very first rope break of the whole
tournament.

4248
04:21:03,480 --> 04:21:04,360
Oh, yeah, I think so.

4249
04:21:04,840 --> 04:21:05,320
Wait, another?

4250
04:21:05,940 --> 04:21:06,420
What?

4251
04:21:06,540 --> 04:21:20,900
one two oh that was so close we thought it was over i
thought so i was ready to call it oh and another not so fast

4252
04:21:20,900 --> 04:21:28,920
not so fast though these are two wild cards they're so wild
honestly i felt like i felt like the ref might have been

4253
04:21:28,920 --> 04:21:35,900
paid off that should have been three it felt i counted in my
head and it was three hey what are you saying doki are you

4254
04:21:35,900 --> 04:21:46,960
not saying this is a fair you know well i'm not saying it
i'm implying it isn't this your turn of it no did you and

4255
04:21:46,960 --> 04:21:54,340
matara kill off the majority of my staff like oh just the
guards we're not touching the referee we don't care about

4256
04:21:54,340 --> 04:22:03,700
them yeah considering i lost maybe we should have i mean the
reps are now scared for their safety after what you've done

4257
04:22:03,700 --> 04:22:12,140
so maybe they got paid off for more protection we're already
at seven oh my god wait where's eight where's there no more

4258
04:22:12,140 --> 04:22:18,400

4265
04:23:13,800 --> 04:23:14,560
Biddle's here for another.

4266
04:23:15,120 --> 04:23:15,920
Biddle's here for another.

4267
04:23:16,980 --> 04:23:18,580
Phelan gets trolled.

4268
04:23:20,120 --> 04:23:21,400
Where'd the lights go?

4269
04:23:21,400 --> 04:23:22,280
This is so weird!

4270
04:23:22,780 --> 04:23:25,080
I thought she copied the move!

4271
04:23:25,960 --> 04:23:27,000
It doesn't matter!

4272
04:23:27,580 --> 04:23:28,620
It doesn't matter!

4273
04:23:29,220 --> 04:23:30,740
She knew what to do!

4274
04:23:30,960 --> 04:23:32,720
She knew what to do after me!

4275
04:23:32,960 --> 04:23:37,860
Yeah, she downloaded your moveset and knew how to counter
it.

4276
04:23:38,460 --> 04:23:40,980
I don't think there was a second teleport.

4277
04:23:43,320 --> 04:23:44,980
That is crazy.

4278
04:23:45,880 --> 04:23:47,420
Oh my god.

4279
04:23:48,220 --> 04:23:51,820
Betel is maxing that luck right now.

4280
04:23:52,500 --> 04:23:53,880
That did not look good for Phelian.

4281
04:23:54,480 --> 04:23:56,960
That looks like it's definitely her.

4282
04:23:57,080 --> 04:23:58,080
Oh, her legs.

4283
04:23:58,080 --> 04:24:00,260
She ain't flipping anytime soon anymore.

4284
04:24:00,380 --> 04:24:01,440
I don't think so.

4285
04:24:02,360 --> 04:24:06,160
He's getting rid of all her appendages so she'll never flip
again.

4286
04:24:06,180 --> 04:24:07,660
It's because she doesn't get enough calcium.

4287
04:24:07,860 --> 04:24:09,640
Her bones are brittle.

4288
04:24:10,200 --> 04:24:11,660
Someone throw her an orange.

4289
04:24:14,660 --> 04:24:20,000
If you're going to be throwing things in the ring, she needs
that orange right now.

4290
04:24:20,480 --> 04:24:21,300
She's like Popeye.

4291
04:24:21,500 --> 04:24:26,200
She grabs a can of spinach and eats it and becomes strong.

4292
04:24:26,940 --> 04:24:27,700
Oh my god.

4293
04:24:27,920 --> 04:24:29,480
Beto reset the count.

4294
04:24:29,700 --> 04:24:30,860
So it's back to four.

4295
04:24:31,120 --> 04:24:33,160
Beto, stop putting her back in the ring.

4296
04:24:35,420 --> 04:24:37,840
Oh, and then knock.

4297
04:24:37,860 --> 04:24:45,640
out of the ring you're not that not allowed in this ring
anymore you have to come back in ring oh jillian jumped out

4298
04:24:45,640 --> 04:24:54,760
as well i think she reset the count by jumping out we'll
find out soon if it goes back to one i don't see an eight

4299
04:24:54,760 --> 04:25:07,400

4300
04:25:09,140 --> 04:25:20,200

he ended up flipping on her and another flip this is it oh

4301
04:25:20,200 --> 04:25:32,320

taunt the taunt oh oh wait wait one two oh so close so close

4302
04:25:32,320 --> 04:25:35,300
come on the crowd's getting restless Come on, Phelian.

4303
04:25:35,820 --> 04:25:38,880
The crowd needs to know if you're going to lose or win.

4304
04:25:39,880 --> 04:25:40,860
Oh, another jump.

4305
04:25:40,980 --> 04:25:41,720
Oh, it's going to hit.

4306
04:25:41,800 --> 04:25:42,500
We got a cutscene.

4307
04:25:42,520 --> 04:25:42,980
It's going to hit.

4308
04:25:43,460 --> 04:25:45,660
Oh, that's got to hurt.

4309
04:25:46,000 --> 04:25:46,800
That's got to hurt.

4310
04:25:46,800 --> 04:25:47,820
That's got to hurt.

4311
04:25:48,020 --> 04:25:50,040
But he's not going to pin, though, Mint.

4312
04:25:51,100 --> 04:25:53,440
Yeah, he's not done playing around with her.

4313
04:25:54,140 --> 04:25:54,580
Oh.

4314
04:25:56,040 --> 04:25:57,200
And another one.

4315
04:25:57,280 --> 04:25:57,820
Oh, here we go.

4316
04:25:57,900 --> 04:25:58,280
Here we go.

4317
04:25:59,000 --> 04:25:59,480
One.

4318
04:26:00,080 --> 04:26:00,560
Two.

4319
04:26:01,300 --> 04:26:01,560
Three.

4320
04:26:05,410 --> 04:26:05,890
Three.

4321
04:26:07,890 --> 04:26:12,470
Your winner for WrestleTuber 2024.

4322
04:26:14,660 --> 04:26:16,350
The Charlie Denier.

4323
04:26:17,370 --> 04:26:19,090
The Diaper Destroyer.

4324
04:26:20,110 --> 04:26:22,910
The Baby Girl himself.

4325
04:26:23,950 --> 04:26:24,550
Battle.

4326
04:26:35,100 --> 04:26:35,980
Insane.

4327
04:26:36,380 --> 04:26:43,020
That was actually, that was the most insane match I've seen
today, man.

4328
04:26:43,120 --> 04:26:43,660
Absolutely.

4329
04:26:43,940 --> 04:26:45,460
It was worthy of the finale.

4330
04:26:45,980 --> 04:26:50,040
The fact that the ref just disappeared for five seconds.

4331
04:26:50,440 --> 04:26:53,300
Oh, what does this win deserve?

4332
04:26:53,740 --> 04:26:54,560
I don't know.

4333
04:26:55,120 --> 04:26:55,940
Let's talk to Beto.

4334
04:26:56,060 --> 04:26:58,160
Let's ask Beto what the fuck was that?

4335
04:26:58,680 --> 04:26:58,900
Yeah.

4336
04:27:03,080 --> 04:27:05,320
Before anyone makes any accusations, I did not pay the ref.

4337
04:27:05,500 --> 04:27:06,800
Okay, I don't know what that was.

4338
04:27:07,020 --> 04:27:07,240
I didn't know.

4339
04:27:07,240 --> 04:27:07,820
That wasn't me.

4340
04:27:08,740 --> 04:27:12,140
Just totally a fair and normal game.

4341
04:27:12,560 --> 04:27:12,980
Sure.

4342
04:27:13,600 --> 04:27:13,840
Yeah.

4343
04:27:14,440 --> 04:27:14,840

4347
04:27:44,200 --> 04:27:48,320
the ref you know he had You know during one of those crucial
moments.

4348
04:27:48,820 --> 04:27:49,780
We'll never know.

4349
04:27:49,840 --> 04:27:53,160
We'll never know Hey Phelan, how do you feel?

4350
04:27:54,440 --> 04:27:54,620

know, I had a really great time here I didn't think it was

4353
04:28:10,160 --> 04:28:15,960
make it this far, but I'm gonna say this the worst thing
position ever is to go through an entire tournament

4354
04:28:15,980 --> 04:28:18,340
tournament just to lose the very ninth round.

4355
04:28:19,060 --> 04:28:20,640
I will never forget this day.

4356
04:28:20,820 --> 04:28:23,700
This thing will burn until WrestleTuber 2025.

4357
04:28:24,540 --> 04:28:26,240
And I will come back stronger than ever.

4358
04:28:26,660 --> 04:28:28,180
And I'll be on gear.

4359
04:28:29,400 --> 04:28:29,980

Look at me, mom.

I did it.

4386
04:29:43,220 --> 04:29:43,940
I did it.

4387
04:29:44,340 --> 04:29:44,940
I did it.

4388
04:29:45,420 --> 04:29:46,160
Is he okay?

4389
04:29:46,540 --> 04:29:47,540
I don't think he's...

4390
04:29:47,540 --> 04:29:50,200
Did he get bit by, like, did he get bit by Mary earlier?

4391
04:29:50,360 --> 04:29:51,020
I think...

4392
04:29:51,020 --> 04:29:52,440
I don't think he's okay, guys.

4393
04:29:52,780 --> 04:29:53,600
I don't think he's...

4394
04:29:53,600 --> 04:29:54,380
Is he crying?

4395
04:29:54,760 --> 04:29:55,820
I think he's crying.

4396
04:29:56,660 --> 04:29:58,920
Steph, we might need some tissues real quick.

4397
04:29:58,960 --> 04:30:00,120
Oh, it's just a game.

4398
04:30:01,280 --> 04:30:02,040
You did great.

4399
04:30:02,320 --> 04:30:07,740
How do you feel being such a winner and holding that
championship belt?

4400
04:30:08,660 --> 04:30:09,860
You know, it feels good.

4401
04:30:10,120 --> 04:30:10,540
It feels good.

4402
04:30:10,680 --> 04:30:12,540
I had some brothers in this and this.

4403
04:30:12,640 --> 04:30:14,600
I had to kill my brother to get here, so...

4404
04:30:15,020 --> 04:30:15,640
Oh, you too?

4405
04:30:16,600 --> 04:30:19,140
It was, you know, I fought my brother in the ring.

4406
04:30:19,280 --> 04:30:19,620
He fought his brother.

4407
04:30:20,240 --> 04:30:21,060
He fought battle too.

4408
04:30:21,780 --> 04:30:24,480
I had to absorb his nutrients to become more powerful.

4409
04:30:25,160 --> 04:30:27,660
Wait, that meant, that means you were fighting us too.

4410
04:30:28,440 --> 04:30:30,980
You had literally two battles in you.

4411
04:30:31,800 --> 04:30:35,020
I had two, we fused to become the perfect life form.

4412
04:30:35,200 --> 04:30:37,840
So it was a 2v1 this entire time.

4413
04:30:37,840 --> 04:30:38,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4414
04:30:39,820 --> 04:30:41,040
Liquid battle, yeah.

4415
04:30:41,560 --> 04:30:42,180
Liquid battle.

4416
04:30:43,240 --> 04:30:44,000
I'm Liquid battle.

4417
04:30:44,280 --> 04:30:44,760
What can I say?

4418
04:30:45,020 --> 04:30:45,840
I have liquid battle.

4419
04:30:48,040 --> 04:30:49,040
Liquid dies.

4420
04:30:49,320 --> 04:30:49,920
No, wait.

4421
04:30:50,220 --> 04:30:51,220
I'm not liquid battle.

4422
04:30:51,500 --> 04:30:52,020
I'm not liquid battle.

4423
04:30:55,120 --> 04:30:56,960
I can't believe it.

4424
04:30:57,460 --> 04:31:10,100
Battle here will be holding on to that champion belt to
represent the winner of the very first WrestleTuber 2024.

4425
04:31:11,180 --> 04:31:15,000
No one will stop him unless...

4426
04:32:07,350 --> 04:32:09,570
A surprise guest?

4427
04:32:10,250 --> 04:32:11,910
Oh my god!

4428
04:32:12,330 --> 04:32:13,190
We have a...

4429
04:32:13,190 --> 04:32:15,390
This is why we need security guards.

4430
04:32:16,030 --> 04:32:18,090
Man, this is why.

4431
04:32:18,690 --> 04:32:19,190
I...

4432
04:32:19,190 --> 04:32:22,890
Hey, hey, hey, your security guard turned out to be a bug in
the sky in the summer.

4433
04:32:23,010 --> 04:32:26,010
Because you killed my original security guide!

4434
04:32:26,670 --> 04:32:29,270
We now have a new contender?

4435
04:32:30,370 --> 04:32:31,770
Who are you, sir?

4436
04:32:33,630 --> 04:32:34,650

Sir, are you okay?

4439
04:32:42,210 --> 04:32:44,010

4440
04:32:44,430 --> 04:32:45,090
Are you okay?

4441
04:32:46,850 --> 04:32:47,610

4446
04:32:55,970 --> 04:32:56,290
I'm scared.

4447
04:32:56,310 --> 04:32:57,250
I don't have to fight them, do I?

4448
04:32:57,530 --> 04:32:59,730
Oh, you're fighting this 3D man right now.

It's not over, Fettle.

4453
04:33:11,290 --> 04:33:13,490
You got to defend your title.

4454
04:33:14,870 --> 04:33:15,310
Already?

4455
04:33:16,230 --> 04:33:17,150

04:33:21,190 --> 04:33:22,230

it would be like one but three three intruders this is what

4461
04:33:54,890 --> 04:34:04,990
happens when there's no more security in this event guys hey
russell tuber keeps me on your toes everybody i can't

embarrassing if he loses it in just like you know after

4466
04:34:55,330 --> 04:35:01,770
holding on to it for like five minutes he already wrote it
into his will he might have to rewrite again

You can't just use all up your energy now.

04:35:33,900 --> 04:35:43,540
And just like in Pokemon, when Gary became champion, five
minutes later, a new champion might be on the horizon.

04:35:44,240 --> 04:35:46,580
It's you, man.

I don't know.

4483
04:37:01,060 --> 04:37:03,740
Betel looks pretty puny next to that guy right now.

4484
04:37:04,000 --> 04:37:05,340
That one's got to be.

4485
04:37:05,600 --> 04:37:06,180
Oh, shit.

4486
04:37:06,500 --> 04:37:08,200
You're, oh, my God.

4487
04:37:09,800 --> 04:37:13,700
The definitely the wrong weight class.

4488
04:37:14,380 --> 04:37:15,180
Holy shit.

4489
04:37:15,820 --> 04:37:17,340

04:43:26,680 --> 04:43:27,300
It's okay.

4544
04:43:28,100 --> 04:43:29,800
Second place is not too bad.

4545
04:43:29,980 --> 04:43:31,160
That means Billion got third.

4546
04:43:33,740 --> 04:43:34,220
Yeah.

4547
04:43:34,380 --> 04:43:35,480

Yeah, but, yeah.

4550
04:43:40,280 --> 04:43:41,520
What does that equate to?

4551
04:43:41,840 --> 04:43:43,600
Second place, because it was the last.

4552
04:43:43,940 --> 04:43:43,960
Nothing.

4553
04:43:44,460 --> 04:43:44,700
No.

4554
04:43:45,440 --> 04:43:45,520
Okay.

4555
04:43:45,700 --> 04:43:45,920
Great.

4556
04:43:47,940 --> 04:43:49,100
God has spoken.

4557
04:43:50,740 --> 04:43:54,420
All right, well, we're going to take it back to the main
casting room.

4558
04:43:55,220 --> 04:43:56,020
Thank you, guys.

4559
04:43:56,100 --> 04:43:57,540
Thank you, Beto, Yuson.

4560
04:43:58,100 --> 04:43:59,480
Thank you for being here.

4561
04:44:00,020 --> 04:44:06,260
Even though Yuson did break in and took away that man's
happiness that he felt, like he was the happiest he's ever

4562
04:44:06,260 --> 04:44:10,660
been in his old life and he took it and they took it away
within five minutes.

4563
04:44:10,660 --> 04:44:11,640
But anyway...

4564
04:44:11,640 --> 04:44:11,980
Sorry, man.

4565
04:44:12,300 --> 04:44:13,300

Thanks, everybody.

4569
04:44:19,050 --> 04:44:22,250
It was great being a winner for 14 seconds.

4570
04:44:22,530 --> 04:44:23,670
It doesn't hurt at all.

4571
04:44:25,130 --> 04:44:26,550
Yeah, just be better next time.

4572
04:44:26,770 --> 04:44:27,170

Yeah, okay.

4574
04:44:28,710 --> 04:44:30,190
Yeah, they want me to fight God.

4575
04:44:30,350 --> 04:44:31,470
What was I supposed to do?

4576
04:44:34,010 --> 04:44:35,590
You tried your best, man.

4577
04:44:35,650 --> 04:44:36,610
You tried your best.

4578
04:44:36,890 --> 04:44:45,190
that matters you tried you fought god and lasted like at
least three minutes you know that's an accomplishment but

right wow what a night wow wow um i don't even know what to

4581
04:45:13,930 --> 04:45:26,110
say about all of that that was uh that was pretty crazy what
we experienced tonight uh yeah uh truly one for the books i

4582
04:45:26,110 --> 04:45:33,070
think yeah you know i was i felt like you know like we
should end it with royal rumble with you know you you man's

4583
04:45:33,070 --> 04:45:42,110
invasion i felt like that was like the perfect way to like
end the whole event and what an event meant what an event

4584
04:45:42,110 --> 04:45:52,050
like there were so many things that happened like the fact
that like um fuyo made it so far and like pioneered the

4585
04:45:52,050 --> 04:46:02,890
diaper diaper meta just to get defeated by better and then
better one just to lose it in 14 seconds we saw ball

4586
04:46:02,890 --> 04:46:10,330
grabbing, we saw diaper grabbing, we saw titty grabbing, we
saw head grabbing, we saw every sort of grabbing that we

4587
04:46:10,330 --> 04:46:11,030
could have grabbed.

4588
04:46:12,210 --> 04:46:12,790
And you know what?

4589
04:46:12,850 --> 04:46:19,290
You man grabbed the title and the belt right off of the
pedal's body.

4590
04:46:25,370 --> 04:46:28,450
Right on the pedal's no chance.

4591
04:46:28,790 --> 04:46:31,210
That man, oh my, do you say?

4592
04:46:31,230 --> 04:46:34,430
was fucking built there.

4593
04:46:34,930 --> 04:46:35,470
Oh, yeah.

4594
04:46:35,730 --> 04:46:38,230
I was like, oh, my God.

4595
04:46:38,350 --> 04:46:41,250
I felt like, like, Yusua was just fucking flipping.

4596
04:46:41,890 --> 04:46:50,870
And, like, the fact that, like, they ended it with a flip
while Beto stayed lying on the ground in his pool of blood

4597
04:46:51,470 --> 04:46:52,910
outside the ring.

4598
04:46:53,650 --> 04:46:55,770
Just so sad that he was fighting again.

4599
04:46:55,890 --> 04:46:57,290
He was like, why am I here?

4600
04:46:57,550 --> 04:46:59,630
Why am I here just to suffer?

4601
04:46:59,970 --> 04:47:08,890
Just Beto luck next time i guess oh i guess you gotta come
are you feeling doki after you know pulling off such a crazy

4602
04:47:08,890 --> 04:47:16,270
event it feels feels like it's great it feels like i'm
speechless in a way like there's no words to really describe

4603
04:47:16,270 --> 04:47:23,810
how i really feel right now there was some stuff along the
way but everybody enjoyed the experience the time the fans

4604
04:47:23,810 --> 04:47:29,950
the participants you should have seen the discord while the
matches were going on like oh yeah the staff and like the

4605
04:47:29,950 --> 04:47:35,010
participant was just like laughing along the way with some
of the stuff that was going on.

4606
04:47:35,770 --> 04:47:38,670
Mint, how do you feel casting for this after breaking in?

4607
04:47:39,230 --> 04:47:40,090
Oh, it was great.

4608
04:47:40,310 --> 04:47:46,150
Thank you for having me and, you know, sorry that I, like,
kind of just can't, you know, sorry that I killed like...

4609
04:47:46,150 --> 04:47:47,810
But, hey, but, you know, think of it.

4610
04:47:47,910 --> 04:47:50,270
I killed off a bunch of guys, so you don't have to pay them.

4611
04:47:50,530 --> 04:47:51,210
So it's just like...

4612
04:47:51,210 --> 04:47:51,890
Oh, that's true.

4613
04:47:52,290 --> 04:47:53,130
Easy peasy.

4614
04:47:53,350 --> 04:47:54,670
That is so true, Mint.

4615
04:47:54,810 --> 04:48:00,030
But, like, some would say you're the reason why Beto lost,
like, his belt.

4616
04:48:01,030 --> 04:48:01,750
What do you mean by that?

4617
04:48:02,070 --> 04:48:09,130
Because by you killing the security guards, you started the
domino effect of all these other contestants coming in

4618
04:48:09,130 --> 04:48:11,390
because we had no more security.

4619
04:48:13,550 --> 04:48:20,970
All I have to say about that is if you were a real champion,
you would be able to beat anybody that comes in through that

4620
04:48:20,970 --> 04:48:21,310
door.

4621
04:48:21,510 --> 04:48:22,910
So even if it's Grandpa Joe.

4622
04:48:24,670 --> 04:48:28,310
So Beto did not deserve the development.

4623
04:48:31,030 --> 04:48:32,030
That's a little...

4624
04:48:32,550 --> 04:48:34,630
Sorry, battle next time.

4625
04:48:34,830 --> 04:48:36,010
Battle next time.

4626
04:48:38,850 --> 04:48:43,990
Before we call it, we gotta thank some people for this
event.

4627
04:48:45,050 --> 04:48:50,770
For the people that made the graphics, everything from here,
the videos and everything.

4628
04:48:51,590 --> 04:49:00,090
First off, as you guys can see, the logo, belts, and
graphics were done by Sugar Type, Melly, and Oni Pilot.

4629
04:49:01,030 --> 04:49:08,930
them for making the assets for for those things we also have
other people who think like the trailer video and the

4630
04:49:08,930 --> 04:49:25,290
singers um the last minute um like i was i think sorry my
matara it says katara from avatar to last air katara oh my

4631
04:49:25,290 --> 04:49:33,770
god katara was here too guys holy shit It's okay, it's
Katara mine, you guys.

4632
04:49:34,890 --> 04:49:38,050
It wasn't actually Matara, she was here in spirit, it was
Katara.

4633
04:49:38,050 --> 04:49:38,890
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

4634
04:49:39,350 --> 04:49:41,290
Matara's spirit's name has a different name.

4635
04:49:41,310 --> 04:49:41,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4636
04:49:41,770 --> 04:49:43,190
Her name is Katara.

4637
04:49:44,070 --> 04:49:48,050
She inspired the original, the Katara from Avatar, the last
Airbender.

4638
04:49:48,510 --> 04:49:50,030
It was based off of Matara.

4639
04:49:50,130 --> 04:49:50,690
Yeah, yeah.

4640
04:49:50,890 --> 04:49:56,330
But yes, we want you guys to know, like those intro videos,
like the Mint and Matara intro videos were done like

04:50:41,210 --> 04:50:48,370
giving up their time being here, like all those hours being
here, doing the interviews, doing the announcements, doing

4648
04:50:48,370 --> 04:50:49,010
the casting.

4649
04:50:49,530 --> 04:50:52,950
They all give up their time to be here participating in this
event.

4650
04:50:53,630 --> 04:50:55,510
And so we gotta give them a shout out.

4651
04:50:55,570 --> 04:50:58,650
My throat is dying after casting for two hours.

4652
04:50:59,630 --> 04:51:00,450
And I go home now.

4653
04:51:01,030 --> 04:51:02,030
I go home now.

4654
04:51:03,810 --> 04:51:04,250
Yeah.

4655
04:51:04,790 --> 04:51:04,910
Yeah.

4656
04:51:05,130 --> 04:51:09,330
You know, huge, great, great announcing, man.

4657
04:51:09,490 --> 04:51:11,550
You got, you did amazing for your first time.

4658
04:51:12,090 --> 04:51:13,110
This guy was so nervous.

4659
04:51:14,050 --> 04:51:14,750
He was so scared.

4660
04:51:14,750 --> 04:51:15,170
I was.

4661
04:51:15,170 --> 04:51:15,730
I was shaking.

4662
04:51:17,330 --> 04:51:18,210
It was crazy.

4663
04:51:18,310 --> 04:51:20,350
How do you feel announcing for WrestleTuber?

4664
04:51:21,490 --> 04:51:22,250
I'm fucking tired.

4665
04:51:24,010 --> 04:51:27,350
Bro, I, my head is like slightly lightheaded.

4666
04:51:27,470 --> 04:51:29,350
I was like, man, I guess I did use a lot of oxygen.

4667
04:51:31,330 --> 04:51:32,030
I'm beat.

4668
04:51:33,350 --> 04:51:36,630
Yeah, we're all tired, but it's almost over, guys.

4669
04:51:36,810 --> 04:51:37,610
It's almost over.

4670
04:51:37,810 --> 04:51:42,750
And finally, a shout out to GamerSubs for sponsoring this
tournament, this event.

4671
04:51:43,090 --> 04:51:44,730
They paid for everything, basically.

4672
04:51:44,830 --> 04:51:51,450
I didn't have to pay for any of the stuff, like the belts,
the, um, the belts, the graphics, the videos, all that stuff

4673
04:51:51,450 --> 04:51:52,690
that I said, all these people made.

4674
04:51:52,990 --> 04:51:54,050
I didn't have to pay for it.

4675
04:51:54,450 --> 04:51:58,270
GamerSubs kindly decided to pay for all of this.

4676
04:51:58,630 --> 04:52:00,110
So thank you again to GamerSubs.

4677
04:52:01,410 --> 04:52:03,970
This is the end of the show, everybody.

4678
04:52:04,690 --> 04:52:06,310
My throat is dead.

4679
04:52:06,370 --> 04:52:08,310
I feel like Glen Doki Reds.

4680
04:52:08,410 --> 04:52:10,110
My throat is dead.

4681
04:52:10,670 --> 04:52:14,430
Do you have any final words, Mint, to tell the audience?

4682
04:52:15,390 --> 04:52:16,310
Oh, I gotta say.

4683
04:52:16,570 --> 04:52:17,250
I gotta say...

4684
04:52:20,250 --> 04:52:21,790

04:52:22,030 --> 04:52:24,170
