All right, cool.

61
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,220
Oh, my gosh.

62
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,900
Why did my guy have to win this fight?

63
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,520
I wanted to queue up for the next game.

64
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,440
I will never, ever, ever be paying rent ever again after
this year.

65
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,980
I fucking hate it.

66
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,340
Yeah, but then you're going to have a mortgage.

67
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,140
I would rather pay a mortgage every day of the week.

68
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,260
To be fair, mortgages are actually good for you or your
credit.

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh, yeah.

70
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,560
Oh, yeah.

71
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,220
But not like too bad of a mortgage.

72
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,740
If you don't get a too bad of a mortgage.

73
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah.

74
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
The more you pay off your credit, your mortgage, the better
credit you get.

75
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,960
Yeah, 100%.

76
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Because it says you're a responsible homeowner.

77
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,080
Responsible.

78
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,640
Apparently there's an earthquake in LA.

79
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,400
I didn't feel anything.

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,540
There was.

81
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,600
Apparently.

82
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,040
The earth is dying.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,120
Where my friend lived.

84
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,680
Honestly.

85
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,240
This is why he didn't live like, you need to live away from
the ocean.

86
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,820
So you don't have to worry about the water sucking up the
land if there was an earthquake.

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,220
Yeah, live in a landlocked city.

88
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,220
Oh, New York City, seriously.

89
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,440
Is code out yet?

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,620
You're always asking if the code is out.

91
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm freaking out, dude.

92
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm freaking out.

93
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,560
Is the code out?

94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,040
When does my fucking stream go live?

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
Waiting for the fucking...

96
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,480
No, I'm waiting for the YouTube thing to be like, go live.

97
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,640
Oh, my God.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,500
10 minutes is so long.

99
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,940
10 minutes is actually so long.

100
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,940
It's such a long delay.

101
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:44,840
All right.

102
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,500
Who the fuck is?

103
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,720
I guess it's because, like, you know, like...

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,440
Cheater mans, hacker mans.

105
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Because it's like, that's how long...

106
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,460
It's like too into the game that at that point, they can't
do anything in the stream tonight.

How am I supposed to know where you land in Scripps?

132
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,730
It's time to watch all his streams.

133
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,970
Did you put the code in the chat, Timber?

134
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,790

We're so fucked.

143
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,610
Don't worry, viewers won't find until 10 minutes later.

144
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:17,770
Alright, she lands checkpoint and checkpoint and fissure, it
looks like.

145
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,710
Fissure.

146
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,230
Okay, so we just avoid that.

147
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,690
Just go the opposite side of that.

148
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,570
Sorry, I just had code in chat.

149
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,130
Oh, it codes out?

150
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,910
Yeah, but I need to warm up my charge rifle.

151
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,750
You though?

152
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,310
You really need to warm up your charge rifle?

153
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:38,990
Tell

154
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,760
me when to join the lobby, because I'm still in this goddamn
trio's match.

155
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,280
I can't leave because this guy has tried so hard to carry
me.

156
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,300
He knows you're a streamer, he's like...

157
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:11,700
he's done so much for me all right codes out baby w let's go
tempo thanks for code let's let's not get round one no no

158
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:21,780
one i mean bro i'm gonna be honest if we get round one that
would be so funny that'd be funny in a very bad way that'd

159
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:32,400
be so funny don't worry our viewers won't know delete oh
right uh 15.

160
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:41,900
say 15 yeah oh my god bro my aim's not not doing so well
just so you know honestly if we're being real we probably

161
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,500
should have changed our names for the first like yeah we
should have changed i'm not kidding so we don't get a stream

162
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:56,280
snake so some people won't know how much lobby we were in
they would definitely throw our game for the content

163
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,060
I'd would.

164
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,380
They probably don't even stream, so there's no play.

165
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,620
Yeah, no, they don't need a stream.

166
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,500
It's the satisfaction.

167
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,280
I'll use stream snipers.

168
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm turning on the mode thing, the mode that doesn't tell me
who killed me.

169
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,860
So none of you will get satisfaction.

170
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,200
None of you will get satisfaction.

171
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,100
Not if no one can see it.

172
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,760
All right, my chargeback goes on my duck.

173
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm ready to go.

174
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,800
Apparently, you're so quiet while I figure this out 10
minutes later.

175
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,440
No, I can't adjust the volume because I have to fucking
fight.

176
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,700
Oh, wait.

177
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm gonna pull up a map so I can figure out whatever.

178
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,300
Oh, shit.

179
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,200
What the fuck?

180
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,140
What the fuck?

181
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,140
Oh, my God.

182
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh, my God.

183
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,480
Nice wig.

184
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,700
Oh, my God.

185
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,220
High wig.

186
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,160
Yeah, we're fucking shocked.

187
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,460
I blame Whig.

188
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,480
It's all.

189
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
This is your fault, Whig.

190
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,420
This is your fault.

191
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,520
If we get fucking landed on, it's all Whig's fault.

192
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,620
All right.

193
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,800
We'll just say where we're going.

194
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,480
Where are we going, though?

195
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,700
Because actually, we don't know what we're doing.

196
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,960
We haven't discussed that at all.

197
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,840
I know.

198
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,260
I've been waiting for this discussion for a while.

199
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,480
What you mean, you just woke up.

200
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,500
I've been asking.

201
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,980
I was like, whoa, where do we go, guys?

202
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,640
What do we play?

203
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,640
I've been asking this for a while.

204
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,540
Where are we going, dude?

205
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,460
What's going on?

206
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,540
Um, I mean, where are we going?

207
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,180
Yeah, that's a good question.

208
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,500
I mean, I feel like, I don't know.

209
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,980
It's also only 15 teams, so.

210
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,700
Harvester would be pretty good for us.

211
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,740
Wait, where do we, what, um, what placement do we have to do
to, to like, top 10?

212
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,280
Okay.

213
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,800
We just need to be better than five teams.

214
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,420
That's it.

215
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:08,780
all the way through so all we ought to see it be better than
five teams yeah which is really easy or should be yeah

216
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:21,350
there's already teams contesting each other so this is great
this is good for us all right yeah bro oh my god what the oh

238
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,150
I think you're way too confident right now.

239
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,770
It's called.

240
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Let's do Ceto and Stacks.

242
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,270
Those ones should be free.

243
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,010
All right, Ceto and Stacks.

244
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,330
I don't remember where either of these are.

245
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,530
Wait, so should I...

246
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,570
I should go Watson, right?

247
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,350
Because they're on Stormflight.

248
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,930
And then Caustic on World's Edge.

249
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,290
Okay, but where do I go?

250
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,870

Yeah, yeah, because you're the roller.

254
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,390
We were, we're starting.

255
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,310
I'm playing Blood both maps then.

256
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,030
You guys cool with that?

257
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,170
Yeah, okay, wait, what do I play?

258
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,690
What do I play?

259
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,290
Bang?

260
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,250
I mean, on this map, Bang probably.

261
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,090
Okay, I'll do Bang.

262
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,390
Okay, you guys gotta like micromanage me here.

263
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,070
Oh, you're good, you're good.

264
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,610
I'll do my best.

265
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,730
You're good.

266
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,330
I'm locked in.

267
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,490
I'm locked in.

268
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,210
Here's our IGL.

269
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,490
Yeah, you're gonna micromanage me.

270
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,390
I always turn my brain off when I rank.

271
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,090
I can't lie, bro, no Valp though.

272
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:35,030
we need make sure we just prioritize evac towers we find one
literally just say something like immediately get an evac

273
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,910
you're like hey got an evac it's gonna be a super important
comm just because we don't have a valve to get in anywhere

274
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:49,810
agreed uh how do we loot cedo um okay so cedo station i
think one should land the bottom side near jurassic one and

275
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,190
then one just lands in the middle and one goes big building
on the right side it's pretty simple i mean we could go we

276
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,030
could stretch bean and just maybe see if there's someone's
going bean but i think we just don't get greedy here because

277
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,910
i don't even know oh my god we have hot zone yay whoa
that'll be too we don't even know if we're gonna land on yet

278
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,210
but that no one could have said anything and they can still
land here we might get a contest just watch out we just

279
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:14,690
chill we just chill yeah it's like here's the play if we're
gonna get tested make sure we just group up together at some

280
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:24,850
spot on seo station go from there yeah yeah no one has
dropped from this plane no there's like one team here i

281
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:36,590
don't 14 squads we just got to be better than four squads
this is it we got to be better than four squads to be fair

282
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,870
announcing where we're going is actually probably worse for
us just because of people wanting to land on us i know

283
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:48,250
that's why i was like i don't know we should talk about we
should have typed this out uh timberland middle and then

284
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:55,770
i'll land a beer yeah you're good okay i'll land the side
there that's on here yeah dear thing you're good all right

285
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,230
so i mean Whatever guns you guys want to take, feel free.

286
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,210
This first round doesn't really, shouldn't be that hard for
us.

287
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:00,730
I got an evac.

288
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:01,730
Hard rifle.

289
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,170
Nice.

290
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,170
Good call.

291
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,430
Look at us.

292
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,650
Look at you.

293
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,910
We're doing so well.

294
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,730
Let's fucking go.

295
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,530
We're off to a better start than we ever thought.

296
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,330
We got an evac on the first drop.

297
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,410
Let's fucking go.

298
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,070
This is better than Twitch Rivals.

299
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,710
Oh, that's way better than Twitch Rivals.

300
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,030
I think actually anything's better than Twitch Rivals.

301
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,750
Twitch Rivals never happen.

302
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:33,610
so painful how do we have zero beacons oh just like twitch
rivals we had to we had to fly somewhere else to get a

303
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:39,750
beacon yeah every time every time i mean we could just this
zone actually might be ending near us i think it's gonna be

304
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,850
barometer but we can just stay here for right now and just
play for the next zone i think we're just chilling barometer

305
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:52,950
side or uh chill towards uh see that far yep i don't want to
use a car there's also this year i haven't seen a vault but

306
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,930
I have it, but you want the vault.

307
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,050
No, you're good.

308
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,410
You're good.

309
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,570

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,070
There's a 6x here if you want, when you get the tri-drifle.

321
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,530
There's another Evac!

00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,390
I found a vault, too.

327
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:16,590
Nice.

328
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,690
Oh my god, there's so many vaults.

329
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,150
Yeah, I'm not going to lie.

330
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,750
After I said that, I just found like so many.

331
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,250
Yeah, I'd found like two votes.

332
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:24,850
Holy shit.

333
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,130
Is there any evo caches that we could farm up in the way
too?

334
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,150
I mean, it's just going to pull towards the outside side.

335
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,110
It's just going to be right side area.

336
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,530
So if we can get there quick and do one of those buildings,
we're good to go.

337
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,330
I doubt we get sent on.

338
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,530
We might get sent on, but I'm going to be honest.

339
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,930
I'm pretty confident in our 3v3 ability.

340
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,490
We might not play it by all time, but I think we're better
than the average player in these lobbies.

341
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,790
I think I'm on like 100 frames.

342
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,970
Oh, no.

343
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,290
Performance.

344
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,750
Oh, no.

345
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,810
No, no, no, no.

346
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,190
Okay.

347
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,050
No, we're okay.

348
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,070
I think we're okay.

349
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,050
Okay.

350
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,610
Are you sure we're okay?

351
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,230
I don't know.

352
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,230
This does not feel like 240 frames, but like, maybe it's my
mod today.

353
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,690
We're good.

354
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,250
All right.

355
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,450
You guys ready to rip it out or what?

356
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,330
No, we're okay.

357
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:07,790
We're okay.

358
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,150
We're okay.

359
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,370
I'll play this one game on less frames.

360
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:10,850
That's fine.

361
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,510
Where was the other evac out, Doki?

362
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,990
What was it?

363
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,390
It was like in one of the buildings here.

364
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:17,950
Oh, gosh.

365
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,930
You might be able to find it in the one of the buildings.

366
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,010
I have an evac as well.

367
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:21,870
Oh, okay.

368
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,610
I mean, we only need two.

369
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,930
We're not going to do that.

370
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,750
three to get into zone should be fine i think i'd actually i
found it okay now i should start ripping the end i think

371
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:34,070
yeah yeah we're good okay they would just start the rotation
in let's go we're gonna rotate through the jurassic side

372
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:44,830
let's go through here yeah chargeable all right oh i follow
my hammer point one team died one team died oh don't forget

373
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,970
we already get a poison point just from being top 15.

374
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:54,510
yeah zone davis kill everyone okay don't forget If we're on
my Evac here, we're going to start right at the end.

375
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,110
Just continue my Evac.

376
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,150
We're going to get into Barometer front side if we can.

377
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,430
I'll go first and I'll just tell you guys where to land with
the ping.

378
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,130
It's okay, so my landing's awful and I'll just tell you guys
where to go.

379
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,890
Do we want to try and get that?

380
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,670
What, the Evo cache?

381
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:07,190
Yeah.

382
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,030
We probably should.

383
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,590
Yeah.

384
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:09,670
What?

385
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,030
You good?

386
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,390
Hello?

387
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,610
I'm okay.

388
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,010
I'm okay.

389
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,630
I ran into a tree.

390
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,610
Okay.

391
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,490
Do I get the tactical cooldown or the ultimate cooldown?

392
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,530
That's up to you.

393
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,150
I mean, I would probably say...

394
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,770
say tactical cool down personally but it's up to you all
right i got the tactical cool down yeah just i don't think

395
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:35,050
we're going to use the ulti how much here all right okay i
got my ulti here too we can just keep bumping in i want to i

396
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:39,250
guarantee those two buildings are going to be taken here i
would want to get there but i think both are going to be

397
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:45,050
taken for sure is anyone top barometer no i don't think
anyone alluded they just they just took barometer right now

398
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,990
they missed the top wait you want to put your evac down too
can you come here put your evac down yep oh they just took

399
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,910
it from us from right next to me you're good though there's
no one in this left side building either we can land on the

400
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,950
left side building okay guys all right we're gonna go for
this we're gonna land for this left building okay guys and

401
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,490
we're gonna start immediately lead the way cat yeah yeah got
you got you yeah lead the way there's no one on the height

402
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:11,950
so we should be free let's just make sure that we're free
let's see okay we're good there's no way they hit those

403
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:17,190
right we're good yeah no one in here we're good to go yeah
we live here now i can't but don't put gen down yet because

404
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,430
there's no one across when i scan i'm like we're gonna go
there there's no one one there.

405
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,570
I think we should take the, eh, no, let's just stay here.

406
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:22,770
Stay.

407
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,390
You can start setting up 10, but we're good to go.

408
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,110
Let's go, baby.

409
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:26,830
Look at us.

410
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,790
We just gotta make sure we live.

411
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,590
Jen down here.

412
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,450
Jen down could be like up on stairs, right?

413
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,790
Like here could be over.

414
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,130
I don't know.

415
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,170
You can put it anywhere you want.

416
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,110
Honestly, there's nothing that's really safe.

417
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,550
I'm gonna look west side.

418
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,690
I'm looking at west side.

419
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:41,530
Okay.

420
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,290
Yeah, do your thing.

421
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:44,810
We should be fine.

422
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,890
I don't think a lot of teams are going to rotate.

423
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,150
They're not like a team up top here.

424
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,070
Yeah, they're going to be top barometer.

425
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:57,290
right yeah they're up here oh what the fuck you can see me
from here that's not fair we are we have a lot of Watson Jen

426
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,510
so we should be like we should be fine on the passive
feeling to watch this towards our passive feeling right

427
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,150
tempo I swear it might be to be honest but I feel like there
I feel like they're gonna play more aggressive because they

428
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:14,530
just know they're better than a lot of people here yeah I
mean one team's already gone so I'm pretty sure yeah dragon

429
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:23,230
also said hello coches if we need help so nice that's
actually huge for us yeah i want i want to go to the other

430
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,650
building but i feel like it might just pull to the nut sack
and i feel like i've always been better so they would just

431
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:34,950
stay here all right well we'll know it oh that has to be
davis oh that has to be davis one bloodhound just killed two

432
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:46,630
people two more teams guys let's go guys i need i need to
shoot someone is it three is it three games or four four

433
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:53,850
four four okay it's four rounds or like four wait or four
games per round oh okay games for round three rounds okay

434
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:01,970
four games is not too bad i thought would be like six games
no wait where is uh everyone i want to shoot someone uh no

435
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:09,250
one's rotating this down there is people above us if you
want to shoot them there's people uh on that side you want

436
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:15,990
to shoot that there's just no one here to shoot no one's
gonna rotate this this first round usually pointless to be

437
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,510
honest yeah i mean we can have oh does that mean i can like
fix frames right now?

438
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,290
No, of course.

439
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,190
Yeah, you're so good.

440
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,610
If we die, it's not my fault.

441
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,050
I just said I could fix my.

442
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,030
Okay.

443
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:26,870
Should I look?

444
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,290
Tempo, were you on the roof?

445
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,430
No, you're in the hole.

446
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,490
Never mind.

447
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,070
Tempo, if you go on that goddamn roof, I swear.

448
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,330
You're literally Watson right now.

449
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,330
I forgot I did that with drops.

450
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:37,930
Okay.

451
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,330
How did you forget that?

452
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,690
Can I tap out?

453
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:41,510
Oh, yes.

454
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,110
You're so good.

455
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:42,530
You're so good.

456
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:42,950
Oh, yeah.

457
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,450
Even if he goes, hey, no one's going to send us.

458
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,190
No one's going to send us.

459
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,490
What do you mean?

460
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,610
What if it was Zone Davis?

461
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,510
Even if I get knocked, I don't think we get fought, to be
honest.

462
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,490
Oh, someone's fighting somewhere.

463
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,210
I can't see because...

464
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,350
All right, I'm going to fucking double-check my monitor just
to be sure.

465
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,810
Oh, my God.

466
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,730
How do I tap to my...

467
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,690
You guys, I need to figure out how to get my...

468
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,090
Oh, my God.

469
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:09,950
We've almost dead.

470
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,930
Wait, what?

471
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,250
No, we're good.

472
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,870
Wait, why are you sitting on a roof?

473
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,310
Oh.

474
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,630
I'm not.

475
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,530
I was first floor.

476
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,450
Okay, no, I'm on 280 hertz.

477
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,190
My eyes might...

478
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,610
just be tired.

479
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,050
Are you fucking kidding me?

480
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,030
My eyes are seeing 100 FPS.

481
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,830
There is no fucking way.

482
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,470
I still have eye boogers.

483
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,270
My eyes will just be tired.

484
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:32,870
It's okay.

485
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm on 200 frames.

486
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,210
It's one of the craziest.

487
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,610
Sorry, my 200.

488
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,750
I wonder 80 hertz is so many fucking frames.

489
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,010
You thought you were on a hundred?

490
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,550
My eyes just haven't booted up yet.

491
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,590
It's okay now.

492
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,750
eye bookers are covering everything oh you 98 guys i'm
hungry

493

The hell no.

498
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,370
They would need so much damage to get purple.

499
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,090
It's insane.

500
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,510

Adam.

502
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,350
Well, fuck, I'm using charge rifle because I'm in the lobby.

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,870
No, other people also use this charge rifle.

505
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,330
Yeah, I love you so much, but that's definitely not the
case.

506
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,790
No one uses charge rifle.

507
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,970
It's not just you.

508
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,310
I'm going to use these cells because I want to get this
pack.

509
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,850
Wait, someone's landing.

510
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,350
Yeah, just hold strong.

511
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:52,970
They're going to another building.

512
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,170
We're going to the other building.

513
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:54,670

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,510
I kind of want to get this pack, bro.

515
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:56,970
Am I trolling?

516
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,310
If I do that, I think I probably am trolling.

517
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,730
We're in this building.

518
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,070
Yo, stay still so I can charge my body.

519
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,110
No, should I risk it for this pack?

520
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,010
You maybe die or no?

521
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,710
Um, what pack?

625
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,140
Glad we're not those guys.

626
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,040
Wait, what the fuck?

627
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,940

See if I can shoot anyone.

632
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,100
I'm not gonna fucking risk anything right now.

633
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,100
No, you're good.

634
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,980

any KP for us.

635
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,760
Any points.

645
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,120
They're like running back and forth.

646
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Like, really dumbfights, to be honest.

647

That's right.

737
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,060
Suck a dick, whoever Bangor 2942 is.

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,300
Yeah, whoever you are.

739

Good plays, man.

740
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,100
That's, I mean, that's probably enough for us to call
already.

741
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:51,520
Yeah.

742
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,320
I think we're fine.

743
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,300
We can just chill now.

744
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,280
Yeah, we're good.

745
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,600
I'll play.

746
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,340
I'll play next game, man.

747
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,260
That's a nice point.

748
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,720
We're good.

749
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,740
That was awesome, bro.

750
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,000
Are you doing it?

751
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,080
Good job getting the KP.

752
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,100
We needed that pretty much.

753
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,600
Yeah, we got four KP guys and four plays.

754
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,360
No, we're just no way any team's gonna chase up to us now.

755
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,240
Oh my god, this is the creeper team.

756
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,020
Let's do it.

757
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
That could have been us way good.

758
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,580
That bloodhound holding that creeper.

759
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,440
That could have been...

760
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,220
What a fuck did that team push us just to get...

761
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,260
I mean, I'm gonna lie.

762
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,380
I re-peaked without scanning and there are just three men
sitting in the back.

763
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,220
And they're in a bin.

764
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,560
But they have like purple and reds too.

765
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
So it's like they could fight, obviously.

766
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,800
Oh, they could.

767
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,540
He's like.

768
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,440
I'm hungry.

769
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,640
You are 20 something years old.

770
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,520
You are not hungry.

771
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,480
You're hungry.

772
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,260
I'm hungry.

773
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,820
Oh, man.

774
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,220
I'm not gonna lie.

775
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,820
We were done a better job with the Kramer here for sure.

776
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,420
Yeah, that could have been you.

777
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,180
Yeah, I mean, I would have hit at least at least one more
shot than this guy.

778
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,320
Oh, oh, maybe it was like a blessing because then you
wouldn't whiff in front of everybody, you know?

779
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,320
Oh, my God, that's so true.

780
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,720
I just three men swung a team.

781
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
I just swung a three man into a bin, though, and died for
it.

782
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,760
That's pretty embarrassing as well.

783
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,960
But it's good that you died so you could IGL us better.

784
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,080
You're so right.

785
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,620
Yeah, I feel like my comms really just improved there,
actually, so much.

00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,240
Yeah, yeah.

787
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,920

boiling and now I can run over like a baby monitor your
kitchen's your fucking baby you have a baby monitor minus

832
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:18,560
tempo shit i've ever seen all right the codes in the lobby
we're ready for round two let's go yeah yeah well

833
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:27,580
technically round one but yeah yeah round two round one i
was just doing the right game we're doing it guys we're

834
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:33,760
doing it now if you really want to get crazy here if we
really get like a good game here i'm all i'm saying is we

835
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,580
can just have a fun time for the last two games i'm not
against it it would be pretty if we had a fun time and then

836
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,860
somehow that would be so great even though we thought we
crawled yeah that would definitely okay maybe like we should

837
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:53,180
have our fun times at the last game not the third game as
well because you know jordan we're in fourth place yeah

838
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:58,640
bitch sorry yeah is that really something to flex about when
there's only 15 teams

839
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,980
i'm pretty sure jordan could get top four by himself

840
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:15,880
you wouldn't even need two more players like he's good you
know what i mean uh watching blood bang and then probably

841
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:26,440
plastic blood bang on the other map yeah thanks for the raid
thanks for the ray bro he can can jordan coach us i'm not a

842
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:34,000
beginner streamer can jordan like coach us live yeah testing
in a 15 team lobby is crazy someone definitely could yeah i

843
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,040
saw some contesting yeah you'll visualize easy work

844
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:52,100
i wish they had that like one the new thing they're gonna do
for split two for i think so yeah yeah yeah someone someone

845
00:45:52,100 --> 00:46:00,060
definitely he doesn't make the next round that's a w for
like actual two people that put north pad or something and

846
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,660
then two people that put like

847
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,860
thing and everyone's just landing on each other and i said
okay i will not tell anyone that they are landing on each

848
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:17,420
other wait we shouldn't say what our pois are or they'll
start landing on us we should type it out like all the pros

849
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:22,780
they see that we're already qualified so they're scared if
they land on us we have nothing to lose anyway we gotta we

850
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:29,820
gotta stop saying we haven't we haven't guaranteed what do
you mean we can literally die last every time like hey we

851
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,020
still get one point that doesn't mean that doesn't make 15.

852
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,320
that's that brings us to That brings us to 12.

853
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,760
Yeah, that's three points short from qualifying.

854
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,140
So let's go kill a team.

855
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,760
And then we're solid.

856
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,560
All right, let me...

857
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,660
I mean, I didn't expect a full three man in a bin, bro.

858
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,540
What?

859
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,320
No, this guy said, why did you swing solo?

860
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,060
I had to kill you.

861
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,460
I said, I didn't expect a full three man in a bin.

862
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,620
Wait, we're all three just hiding in a bin.

863
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,480
In a bin.

864
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,880
What the fuck?

865
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,320
I mean, that was hilarious.

866
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:14,780
wait did you did you see that uh did you see that uh i don't
i don't know if it was a glitch or if it was a hack i saw i

867
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:21,680
saw a tick tock or if there's something on twitter where it
was like uh someone opened up a bin and three people

868
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:30,280
actually popped out of the bin they like glitched themselves
in in behind a pill and then someone opened the pill and

869
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:38,120
just three people popped up and then he died that is
actually unreal that is fucked up This is the question I'm

870
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,080
asking everyone in today.

871
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,020
I'm asking everyone and every lover in today, this exact
question.

872
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,460
Like chicken parm or meatball marinara subs more?

873
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,180
Every TFT game I play, that's the first thing I say in the
chat and I don't say anything else.

874
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,140
Wait.

875
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,800
I judge a human based off this answer, to be honest.

876
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,320
Yeah, I do.

877
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,000
What if I don't like either?

878
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,420
It depends on the quality of the sub, man.

879
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,440
What if I don't like either?

880
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,260
If the bread's not good, I need my chicken.

881
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,780
I mean, dude, it's just chicken color.

882
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,700
It's just so much better than me blowing air or something
funny.

883
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,520
I think like chicken and brie is much better.

884
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,660
Chicken and brie with cranberry.

885
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,900
Ooh, that's a very fancy taste from you.

886
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,800
I respect that.

887
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,600
Oh, wait, I see my stream now.

You can't afford this.

890
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,480
You can't afford my brie, my puppy.

891
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,640
You can't afford this sandwich.

892
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:36,740
Oh.

904
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,320
Wait.

905
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,220
One minute.

Oh, do I type no.

907

No, it's crazy.

909
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,500
No is crazy.

910
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,380
I respect it though.

911
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:36,980
But they stopped.

912
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,240
for me, am I important enough that they'll stop for me?

913
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,820
Hell no.

914
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,100
It's like match starting.

915
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,100
Not a fucking chance.

916
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,620
I think we fixed the mic issue.

917
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:52,880
Okay, wait.

918
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,160

It was your Twitch Rivals too.

00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,060

00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,400
That's so fucked up.

948
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,680
They did that to your own headline event.

00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,380
You love that for us though.

951
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,780
It makes my better storyline.

952
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:58,200
You know, when I went outside after we lost, like horribly,
and we got 19th, we got 20th.

953
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,840
I thought he was going to be, like, laughing about it and
stuff like that, but I called him, like, a loser and shit.

954
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,120
I went out there and he was molding.

955
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,380
Because we got Oh, man, he was so...

956
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,180
No, you just had a hard one.

957
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,000
He was like, that was one of the worst events we're playing.

958
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,700
He should have casted.

959
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,640
It was a casted.

960
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,340
I'm not so funny because I was like, ah, you're shugged,
bro.

961
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:20,680
Good shit.

962
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,700
I thought he was like, laughing with me.

963
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,500
And I was just like, nope.

964
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,820
Man, this is just one's dad, man.

965
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,900
To be fair, it's worse because he was first picked, too.

966
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,500
Well, it's worse, but dude, his teammate, which I don't know
how this happened, but his teammate never played the game

967
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:33,800
before.

968
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:34,840
What?

969
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,800
Wait, the his third?

970
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:36,960
Yeah, I don't know.

971
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,680
How did you go?

972
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Why?

973
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,500
I have no idea.

974
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,680
That's why I was like super confused.

975
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,960
I mean, I had to talk like, I don't mind me.

976
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,260
Why did Reptar pick him?

977
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,680
Why?

978
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,980
He was the last pick.

979
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,880
No, he was last pick.

980
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,400
Oh, he was the last pick.

981
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:48,960
I mean, that's the guy.

982
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,520
That's what it is, but I just didn't, I don't know how that
works, to be honest.

983
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:52,920
All right.

984
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,240
Wait, what?

985
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:53,920
Did you hit the circle yet?

986
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,380
I didn't.

987
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,280
His beacons can't what he can.

988
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,600
I'm going to go over now.

989
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,760
Yeah, you're going to do a thing, bro.

990
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,760
Is anyone going to grab the cash?

991
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,720
I'll go grab it, actually.

992
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,980
Yeah, if you can, that'd be great.

993
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:04,840
I'm going to run this.

Probably not, right?

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,180
No, I only have a Rez.

1003
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,360
I've got Rez.

1004
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,000
I have Evag.

1005
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,080
You have one Evag tower?

1006
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,400
Okay, we don't want to definitely use it yet.

1007
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,000
It'll be tough.

1008
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,720
All right, are you guys ready to rotate in?

1009
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,040
Yep.

1010
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,760
Yes.

1011
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,220
I'm ready.

1012
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,560
I'm ready, too.

1013
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,320
I'm ready.

1014
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm ready.

1015
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,140
I think we'd hit this cannon.

1016
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,120
You guys want to risk it for the biscuit?

1017
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah, let's do it.

1018
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,220
Let's just hope Team 11 isn't there.

1019
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,740
Team 11 is a real threat now.

1020
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,780
They're the ones that got like 12 kills.

1021
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,040
Where Team 11 was landing.

1022
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,600
Let me go first, and I want you guys to know what's
happening.

1023
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,020

00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,720
Follow me!

1035
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,080
I'm not going to hit a tree this time.

1036
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,960
Follow me to your imminent death.

1037
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,620
Let's go, guys.

1038
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,140
We're going to land right on this one.

1039
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,140
And we're going to keep on walking in.

1040
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,560
Yay.

1041
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,440
Just keep swimming.

1042
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,600
Just keep swimming.

1043
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,180
I'm going to look at my scans.

1044
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,340
We are.

1045
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,680
We're always doing so good, guys.

1046
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,640
I believe in us.

1047
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,260
If we do so well in this game and get, like, top three, then
we can fuck around.

1048
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,300
Oh, yeah.

1049
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,120
Now we can easily fuck around.

1050
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,340
All right.

1051
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,120
gonna take this building for them.

1052
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,720
We should like contest a team.

1053
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:58,560
I'm sure.

1054
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,140
We should do it for Joan Davis.

1055
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,400
Okay, not Joan Davis.

1056
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,480
We should grief him.

1057
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,240
We should grief him.

1058
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:09,060
I mean, he's gonna qualify anyway, so we might as well grief
him.

1059
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,120
He definitely qualifies in no matter what.

1060
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,100
A whole team across this building.

1061
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,760
Okay, watch out.

1062
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,580
Whole team staring at my door from across.

1063
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,140
Team on this building, too.

1064
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,760
West side.

1065
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:18,720
White armor.

1066
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,460
Get shit on, kid.

1067
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,240
There's a team on the West side, too.

1068
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,020
These scads are.

1069
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,340
Yeah.

1070
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:32,420
We're gonna be just full three men in the airs the whole
time we're gonna get spotting zone actually keep pulling

1071
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:40,080
back that'd be a pretty crazy boba does it peek me peek me
peek me yeah peek her peek her guys peek her man i want to

1072
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:49,860
show my god i'm zero damage it's like as you're eating you
know i can eat actually i'm gonna i don't know you can take

1073
00:56:49,860 --> 00:57:01,220
damage why didn't you push me while i'm eating they're gonna
find out 10 minutes later and i'll be done eating all right

1074
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:07,060
i don't know i feel like you're a very slow eater am i right
okay maybe all right yeah i feel like you definitely are i

1075
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,400
get the vibe from you that you take like 45 bites and you're
like okay it's because like i watch a show while i eat i

1076
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,260
love it i mean it's a healthy thing to do adjusting slow
yeah that's true because like you can it meets you like eat

1077
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:27,680
less i did math we have 12 things 12 what i'm like the
opposite literally destroy food like it's not healthy for

1078
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,820
your stomach if you eat too fast it's really unhealthy
actually i said that yeah that's why you disappeared last

1079
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:40,920
like two days ago no i fell i fucking knocked out for like
eight hours i was dead i didn't know you could shoot to this

1080
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:49,160
this is crazy that's what i'm looking oh okay well i shot
him or anyone he already knows i shot him with 121 let him

1081
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,340
know we're here yeah

1082
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,520
I honestly, guys, this is pretty fun, dude.

1083
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,620
We had a way to spend six more hours with all of you.

1084
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,300
Guys, peeks into crack so I can shoot you.

1085
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,520
Yeah, a lot more to go.

1086
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,080
Once the games get harder, it'll actually be like way less,
way more fun, to be honest.

1087
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,840
It's kind of easy games are a little bit boring, a little
bit more boring.

1088
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,380
I think it says there's not a lot of teams, so you don't see
a lot of fights going.

1089
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,820
Yeah, and also like, you know, you know, you're good,
probably no matter what the fuck you do, unless you're like

1090
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,540
really, really struggling at the game.

1091
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,080
Yeah.

1092
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,640
You can shoot through that crack, by the way.

1093
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,440
You can, yeah.

1094
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,680
I had someone for like 130.

1095
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,260
It was crazy.

1096
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
I wish we could still farm armors for each other.

1097
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,920
Now we actually have to contribute.

1098
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:43,960
And that's another game more boring too, like rotating this
out and you just can't farm shit anymore.

1099
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,420
It takes so much damage to do so.

1100
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,820
Now I can't coast.

1101
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,860
Now I actually have to farm with you guys.

1102
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,660
Yeah, you need to also run a sniper.

1103
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,040
Now we have to run triple sniper.

1104
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,960
No, I don't think we should do that ever.

1105
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,000
I have a purple R9.

1106
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,340
I have an R9's fucking ass.

1107
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,400
I don't even know if it's going to be good for us.

1108
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,460
I have a blue R9.

1109
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,980
I mean, I just have a...

1110
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,220
I rather just use a bolt at that point.

1111
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,920
I see someone's gun.

1112
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:12,840
Should have honestly.

1113
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,140
Nope, I can't shoot a gun.

1114
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,000
Shoot his gun, bro.

1115
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,580
Take the fucking barrel off, kid.

1116
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,160
Mad, Maggie!

1117
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:20,420
Man!

1118
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,060
Okay, I kind of like that, though.

1119
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,740
That's on Davis.

1120
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,720
They're fucking around now.

1121
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,260
Yeah, he might be a...

1122
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,180
Yeah, he's number one, right?

1123
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,720
He's number one.

1124
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,380
Keep a lookout to see where number one dies.

1125
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:32,940
Yeah.

1126
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:34,640
All right.

1127
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,580
I'm done eating.

1128
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,840
I'm not hungry anymore.

1129
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,260
Let's go.

1130
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:37,940
I'm just EP.

1131
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:38,420
Let's go.

1132
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,320
You're still EP though?

1133
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,380
Go take a nap.

1134
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,160
Five minute nap.

1135
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,140
Yeah, I'm going to be right back at it.

1136
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:44,820
I'm going to go sleep.

1137
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,520
Just tell me how we do.

1138
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,540
Take your power naps, bro.

1139
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,460
You put the fucking feet up and then you lay on the floor.

1140
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,840
It's actually so good for you.

1141
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,800
Tembo takes power naps for sure.

1142
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,240
Oh, shit.

1143
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:56,960
Look our door.

1144
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,840
Piece of shit, man.

1145
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,320
So Tembo, I don't really know when Tembo.

1146
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,820
How many hours of sleep do you get daily?

1147
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,980
Oh my god.

1148
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:02,700
He knows.

1149
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,040
He knows.

1150
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,100
I don't know.

1151
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,740
I don't know.

1152
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,920
Sometimes I fall asleep on my desk for 20 minutes at a time.

1153
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,720
Bro, what?

1154
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,300
Do you not take actual sleeps?

1155
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,580
Like...

1156
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,540
I don't think so.

1157
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,000

Okay, this is the zone.

1224
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,230
Bro, what?

1225
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:20,010
We need to take the height of this building, to be honest.

1226
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:21,770
We need to.

1227
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,730
Is there anything, any rocks that we can play out here?

1228
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:25,790
I don't know, bro.

1229
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,210
Do we just, I'm gonna be honest, guys.

1230
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:28,610
I don't think we can survive this in any way.

1231
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:32,750
Do we go to the back of this house and just rip an evac
tower and say, fuck with it, what happens?

1232
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:33,610
Or is that what happened?

1233
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,490
We don't have an evac tower.

1234
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:36,590
Evac tower next year.

1235
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,270
Yeah we don't have it.

1236
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:37,970
We just have Resbeacon.

1237
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,470
We're so dead guys.

1238
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:40,470

1239
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,210
Wait, wait wait.

1240
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,410
Having a Resbeacon is good.

1241
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:45,630
We can go into the water, put two Resbeacon's down and hide
behind it.

1242
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,750
Wait, these Sony's...

All right, we need to get the height of this building.

1245
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,990

1246
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:52,430

1321
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:20,390
We're good.

1322
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,730
We're good.

1323
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,150
Back up.

1324
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,670
Bro, we're just dead.

1325
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,470
There's actually nothing to do with this zone.

1326
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,610
What the fuck is the zone?

1327
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:33,830
I mean, we actually have nothing to do.

1328
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,650
This is crazy.

1329
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:36,690
I'm literally going to try to run this zone and bring it in.

1330
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:38,650
We can just mile run.

1331
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,610
Let's just let them kill each other first.

1332
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,210
Yeah, we just wait for more people to kill each other, and
we make that run at the same time.

1333
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,110
Yeah, I can try to smoke them from here.

1334
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:48,690
Right here, right here.

1335
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,970
Yeah, I'm going to move right to the middle.

1336
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:50,470
You guys stay there.

1337
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:51,330
I'm just going to move right over here.

1338
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:52,130
Wait, wait, wait.

1339
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,470
He portaled back to here.

Oh, he did.

1341
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:55,790
What a fucking moron.

1342
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,430
All right, we're gonna move.

1343
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:57,990
Let's move up.

1344
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,070
Oh, look up front if we can donkey trying to.

1345
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:04,450

1347
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:14,770

1348
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,470
Bro that is so not red.

1349
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,050
What is that?

1350
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,290
Wait, wait, wait, we got we got our three points.

1351
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:31,490
We're at 15 now That is the dumbest fucking shit I've ever
seen in my life.

1352
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,190
I gotta kill for us too.

1353
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,750
Bro, what is the zone?

1354
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,670
Bro, that might be one of the worst.

1355
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:37,890
There's nothing you could do there.

1356
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,870
No matter what, unless we're a Newcastle team, we're
literally dead.

1357
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,250
Bro, that is fucking crazy.

1358
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,070
That was the craziest zone pull ever.

1359
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:47,630
I'm not kidding.

1360
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,010
That might be the worst zone I've seen ever in ALGS.

1361
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,630
I've never seen that zone before in my life.

1362
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:56,070
Put that in the ALGS Discord so we can get them to remove
it.

1363
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:57,350
That guy in our lobby is hacking.

1364
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,710
He literally said, have you ever seen those sounds?

1365
01:08:58,830 --> 01:08:59,370
And it just happened.

1366
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,130
Wow.

Let's ask him.

1373
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,190
Ask him what the next zone is.

1374
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,470
Ask him what the next zone is.

1375
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:17,590

admire how optimistic we were.

1408
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,600
We're going to make it across that water.

1409
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,640
Honestly, if they weren't focusing on us, we're good.

1410
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:32,040
I think it's because someone shot, who shot at them?

1411
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,540
Who the fuck shot at them?

1412
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,000
Definitely not me.

1413
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,040
No, that was me.

1414
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,260
Yeah, I was going to say they didn't know we were shooting
at us first.

1415
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,220
They were shooting at us.

1416
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,820
No, I was literally watching.

1417
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,820
They didn't know we were there until somebody shot at them.

1418
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,580
I was like, what the fuck shot them?

1419
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,160
They were not paying attention.

1420
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,180
100% shot us.

1421
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,380
I was like, oh, you want to play this game?

1422
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:59,600
Okay, to be honest, that rock looked a lot closer than it
actually was, because it looked closer when we were at our

1423
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,940
rock.

1424
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,440
And then as I started running, I was like, it looks like
this rock keeps getting further away.

1425
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,760
That's so true.

1426
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,940
I was like, wait a minute, I'm running, but it's not getting
any closer.

1427
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,160
I was confused.

1428
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,420
And then I was like, I'm going to run back and then it
didn't work.

1429
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:29,000
yeah all right so what come do you want to run mega lore

1519
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:29,830
I guess we run as a deer.

1520
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:31,590
No, we find there's no near.

1521
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,410

1522
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,910
Wait, I can't ping it yet.

1523
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:36,890

01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:37,590
It's okay.

1525
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:38,030
It's okay.

1526
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:38,770

1535
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:47,810
If we landed sky...

1536
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,470

zone is coming in so don't forget that we have we cannot

1555
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:25,470
craft like we can usually do just remember that yeah how
many miss can we stay in zone before we die five five and

three are automatically timed out yeah okay there's no way

Where are we trying to run to?

1559
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,590
Like, we should probably go through a side-by-side, yeah.

1560
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,770
Yeah, we should grab something for...

1561
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:55,950
We should grab the evos.

1562
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,510
Yeah, for sure.

1563
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:59,410
We should definitely pad their way to, like, get evo-cashed.

1564
01:23:59,550 --> 01:23:59,710
That one?

1565
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:00,930
Yeah, 100%.

1566
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:02,590
And they go through, like, the fragment side and do that as
well.

1567
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,410
Like, Monument, right here, for sure.

1568
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:07,050
Would it be funny if I alt it just to run faster?

1569
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:08,750

1570
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,010
I don't know.

1571
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:11,390

say the raven one just make sure you scan your raven to get

1580
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:14,070

or actually nah fuck that we shouldn't go to landslide let's

1583
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:37,970

it's gonna be we can do a ring scan too yeah yeah when you

1584
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:43,010

and there's there any beacons we hit yeah it's gonna top

1585
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:48,430
grandmas after this and hit a beacon as well for you duggy
so we know which way to go if we want a path towards

1586
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:54,970
countdown we want a path towards skylights to which ones
less congested there's only 15 teams though so uh two teams

1587
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:57,030
die too two of them die oh 13.

1588
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:58,070
yeah i realized Too dead.

1589
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:02,170
Contesting when there's only 15 squads is really fucking
dumb.

1590
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:02,850
I can't lie.

1591
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,650
Yeah, I can't wait to do that for the look.

1592
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:06,850
For the last game.

1593
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:08,930

1594
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:09,590
Anyway, you guys.

1595
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,170

They're so cursed, bro.

1613

My mom's in chat laughing about how I said she's a horrible
cook.

01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:00,430
Which is very, it's very true.

1622

1628
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,690
Let me take our time.

1629
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:09,870
I'm running.

1630
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:10,910
I'm running.

1631
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:11,810
I'm running.

1632
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:15,550
All right.

1633
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:19,030
I need, I have, I have a four and eight.

1634
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:21,350

1636
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:24,650
Okay.

1637
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:25,350
Let's see.

1638
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,750
Let's see how congested everything is.

1639
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:27,910
Let's see which way we should go.

1640
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:29,510
Here we go.

1641
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:34,110
If no one's on top of trials, we should just evac tower on
there and then I could just charge our three evac towers.

1642
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:34,810
We might as well.

1643
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:35,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1644
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,040
Yeah.

1645
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:41,220
All right.

1646
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,080
Hope no one three, two, one's me.

1647
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:45,800
Yeah.

1648
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,640
I'm sitting right after you, so if you die, I die.

1649
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:48,920
All right.

1650
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:49,520
We're gonna go do this guy.

1651
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,440
Jesus Christ.

1652
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,480
We're going with his team right behind us.

1653
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:55,280
That's one, two, three.

1654
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:55,960

1655
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,740
That's like four things.

1656
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,760
They're probably gonna immediately just.

1657
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:03,580
they're going to probably immediately do exactly what we did
so we're just going to keep moving forward they're going to

1658
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:08,160
just follow us so wait what do we where are we trying to go
are we going straight to skylock we're going to go through

1659
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,040

for us to really go this zone's pretty ass we'll have to

1660
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:16,120

You know, is it our first floor, I think?

1725

Yeah, go to Doki's side.

1727
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:02,550
We're just up here for now.

1728
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:03,750
We're still in up here, by the way.

1729
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:04,350
Barely.

1730
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,750
They watch them.

1731
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:07,130
They conduit altered us.

1732
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:07,530
All right, all right.

1733
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:07,790
It's fine.

1734
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,750
When the conduit goes down, we're going to ult their first
floor.

1735
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:10,390
We're going to jump down.

1736
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,070
We're going to ult their first floor and take this fight and
just kill them.

1737
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:13,070
We need KP here, bro.

1738
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,450
We're not going to be able to play this zone at all.

1739
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,750
So you have a combo, right?

1740
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:16,270
Demo?

1741
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:16,790
What?

1742
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:17,670
Yeah, I've cost gold.

1743
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:18,350
Okay.

1744
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,190
Yeah, everyone here.

1745
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:19,890
Wait, wait, wait.

1746
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,550
They're shooting like, yeah, down there.

1747
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,070
There's like...

1748
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,770
I might get away.

1749
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:24,050
Wait, I think I have angles here.

1750
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:25,230
Yeah, never mind.

1751
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:26,090
They full died.

1752
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,410
The team that was behind us full died.

1753
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:28,070
Okay.

1754
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:28,770
There's a dude.

1755
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:30,830
They're like literally in this floor right here.

1756
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:32,750
Wait, there's a team down here too.

1757
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:34,870
Look, I can scan them for you guys in five.

1758
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:37,610
Because we're going to kill these guys if they're still
underneath us or not.

1759
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:38,470
They are.

1760
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:38,810
They are.

1761
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:40,470
I literally scanned them.

1762
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:41,190
See?

1763
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:42,470
Right below.

1764
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,330
They're coughing too.

1765
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:44,450
This is so bad.

1766
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:45,450
This zone is awful too.

1767
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:46,450
Like, what is going on?

1768
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:48,230
Wait, do we have room on the roof?

1769
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,310
Yeah, I think we should not die because it's still 12
squads.

1770
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:55,890
I know I want to try to jump down here and play the fence
line and maybe just Falculti from there But I don't know

1771
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:57,510
what to do because we're getting shot from everywhere.

1772
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:03,050
This is so bad I think there's a team right over here or
like a solo.

1773
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:04,210
You're right.

1774
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:04,590
I see them.

1775
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:05,110
I see them Yeah, they are.

1776
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:10,330
Yeah, I want to jump down and take the fence and then maybe
Falculti late game I still don't know how we survive this.

1777
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:12,270
There's like no actual chance we survive this item.

1778
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:14,690
We're blue All right, so we're gonna jump out.

1779
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:15,250
We're gonna go right now.

1780
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:15,610
We're gonna go out.

1781
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:18,770
We're gonna go on top floor We're gonna go on top floor and
we're gonna go to the fence line.

1782
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:23,530
No, yeah, we're gonna go fence line first No, no, no, you're
good.

1783
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:24,110
No, you're healthy.

1784
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,190
John, just come with me.

1785
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:26,710
Just jump down the fence right now.

1786
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,490
Just come here and play the fence side.

1787
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:30,350
We're getting looked at by everybody.

1788
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:30,990
We're going to play from here.

1789
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:32,090
Right.

1790
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:33,810
We're going to, we're going to, oh, we're going to valkalty
late.

1791
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:35,010
I just don't know how late we can do it.

1792
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:35,430
We're going to try.

1793
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:36,370
Yeah.

1794
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:36,750
Tempo.

1795
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:39,450
Can you look at our backside here and cost you go do this
right here on the front door?

1796
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:39,970
Front step.

1797
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,130
Make sure this gets up.

1798
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:41,350
I'm scanning.

1799
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:42,130
There's nobody here.

1800
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:42,550
There's nobody here.

1801
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:43,410
We're going to go.

1802
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:48,030
We're going to hit a really risky valkalty.

1803
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:48,230
Come here.

1804
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,730
Come here.

1805
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:48,870
Can we?

1806
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:49,110
Can we?

1807
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:49,770
Unattached.

1808
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:50,790
We're good.

1809
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:51,690
Okay, ready?

1810
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:52,510
Let's hope we don't die.

1811
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:55,170
We gotta kill.

1812
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:56,410
We're gonna try to land somewhere.

1813
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,590
I don't know where we're landing, but this is a really risky
ulti.

1814
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,150
We somehow get on that penis.

1815
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:02,270
Penis tower?

1816
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:03,190
I don't know if we can.

1817
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:03,770
There's a team up there.

1818
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:04,370
Wait, I'm penis.

1819
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,750
Let up penis.

1820
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:05,110
Let up penis.

1821
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:05,590
There's only one guy.

1822
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:06,090
Only one guy.

1823
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:06,610
Okay.

1824
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:09,230
I'm not landing there, by the way, because I fucked up my
landing.

1825
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:09,690
So good luck.

1826
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:11,290
I landed on him.

1827
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:12,210
Okay, it's fine.

1828
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:12,870
You did a good job, Tebow.

1829
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,390
I'm alive.

1830
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:16,590
I mean, there's nothing to do.

1831
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:21,730
this zone is so fucking dog shit god damn it man all right
don't you play your life try your best there's really

1832
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:27,690
nothing to do yeah you're gonna go to two points you're good
don't you run on this left side rock if you can i don't have

1833
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:38,150
you can this is so chopped no oh no i got slowed why is this
such a hard why are we getting caught on everything all

1834
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:45,490
right wait wait that's that's that's three more points
though oh my god bro i'll tell you right now these early

1835
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:48,170
rounds are gonna be harder because teams just don't know
what's happening.

1836
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:52,130
Like, why is that team running behind us and taking our
first four for 30 minutes?

1837
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:54,410
I just don't understand what's going on.

1838
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:54,830
I'm losing my mind.

1839
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,970
Because they saw us doing it and they're like, and they can
do it.

1840
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,610
They're like, this makes sense.

1841
01:34:58,990 --> 01:34:59,330
Let's do it.

1842
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:00,150
This makes sense.

1843
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:01,070
Yeah, okay, cool.

1844
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:02,010
That makes sense.

1845
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:02,850
God damn it.

1846
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,050
You know what, talk about, too.

1847
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,350
We're gonna play the front side of your zip line.

1848
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:06,930
I'm just, I don't know, bro.

1849
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:09,310
I'm just thinking that teams are gonna be playing in these
spots and no one is.

1850
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,250
So I'm like, oh, okay.

1851
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:12,550
Well, now I look, I'm like, wait, I forget we're round one.

1852
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,110
No one's even doing anything correctly.

1853
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:30,670
you so my fault wait did i shoot my gun i did oh thank god i
shot my gun i was like did i get chest to shoot my gun guys

1854
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:40,640
i shot my gun it's all that you guys i don't feel safe i
don't think i play no we're fine with that was that was that

1855
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:46,600
was that three points were good There's no way we don't get
at least three points every game.

1856
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,960
So, like, let's be honest, we're good to go.

1857
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,400
Yeah, but what do the other five teams get?

1858
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,100
I gotta lower the...

1859
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:52,800
I don't know.

1860
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:54,740
We'll see.

1861
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,380
Wait, what is what?

1862
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,160
What is what?

1863
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,560
The only time I got to...

1864
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:02,480
The only time I got to use my all is when I accidentally
alted.

1865
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,660
No, you're doing great.

1866
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,700
You did a great job, though.

1867
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,480
I'm very proud of you.

1868
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,160
We're valid.

1869
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:11,520
We're valid.

1870
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,300
Don't stress it.

1871
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,320
We're all good, guys.

1872
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:21,800
we're doing it i believe in us we're doing great oh

1873
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:33,770
yeah this is still in if we three hit penis oh we would have
been winning this game baby we would have won three man

1874
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:42,690
landed on that car we just three man jump on the penis three
man got on this dick prize would have been good he couldn't

1875
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:46,190
handle all three of us right yeah i'm a fucking nerd

1876
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:57,390
you land on there oh no i didn't like it it was like land on
that i was like i'm on it i'm on the penis i didn't reach it

1877
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:10,110
i don't know how we didn't reach it that's actually crazy
low-key what do you mean it sped out i don't know i i'm

1878
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:16,910
joking did she just landed somewhere completely yeah but i
lived longer for him well yeah that's what i'm saying

1879
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:20,410
because i just don't know what's free and not free with
these fucking guys in it again.

1880
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:21,210
I don't know what's going on.

1881
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:22,790
Well, there's going to be a 20-man lobby.

1882
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:24,910
It's going to be so much easier to understand what's
happening.

1883
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:25,910
It's just so hard.

1884
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:31,330
I mean, the fact that we even got that Valkalty off is
low-key, impressive.

1885
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:32,950
11 and 1.

1886
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:38,010
That's the two teams that we needed to do really well, and
they farmed everyone, which is good.

1887
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:38,270
Great.

1888
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,310
Good for us, guys.

1889
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:39,790
Let's go.

1890
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:42,270
We're on fire right now, guys, honestly.

1891
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:43,310
All right, last round.

1892
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:44,430
Refresh.

1893
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:44,950
Refresh.

1894
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:46,270
Let's see.

1895
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:46,950
Let's see what happens, man.

1896
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,950
Give me a breakdown here.

1897
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,010
We're just in 20th place.

1898
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:56,970
somehow out of 15 quadrants and 20th somehow don't tell me
why i'm the customer not calling bro that would be the

1899
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:02,430
funniest thing if we don't make it past round one today yeah
that would be so fucking crazy that'd be so funny it'd be so

1900
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:10,070
funny though no but that would mean we improve so much
though the next one we do you know the next one is next week

1901
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:20,370
right oh that's crazy it's just back to back week so it'll
be so funny if we do so well this would be so funny we just

1902
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:26,170
do horrible if we if we make it if we somehow make it to
finals and it's just like oh we're in like top five or

1903
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:34,370
whatever or like i think you're on too much copium right now
tim you're literally in six i'm sure now in first i'm pretty

1904
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:41,090
sure we well that's because we didn't count game three i
don't think we're on six place after game three no way no

1905
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:46,390
way i mean realistically it's just It's just harder to call
this shit because just no one's doing anything correct in

1906
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:47,110
any way possible.

1907
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:51,110
I think if we actually played a bad comp, we probably would
do better.

1908
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:51,930
I'm not even kidding.

1909
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:53,310
I would put money that we do better.

1910
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,470
I have to pee a little beer, but I go pee, bro.

1911
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:57,330
Hey, it's his first pee.

1912
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:01,870
It's his first pee.

1913
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:03,410
Good for him.

1914
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:04,130
Good for him.

1915
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:05,950
He's over in the floodgates, though, bro.

1916
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,270
He's about to pee 47 times.

1917
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:10,190
He's about to pee 49 times, though, now.

1918
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:11,130
He's over in the floodgates.

1919
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:12,050
It's true.

1920
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:13,490
I'm going to go get an energy drink.

1921
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:14,090
All right.

1922
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:16,530
I'll be here to entertain your chat for 10 minutes later.

1923
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:17,350

safe though we're in seventh yeah we should probably play
normal yeah i feel like we should play normal i think we're

1938
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:28,410
like four for fifth i feel safe but seven does not feel safe
well actually we're we're in seventh but five fifth six and

1939
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:34,010
seventh all have the same amount of points oh okay yeah but
what about eighth we'll play how many points does eighth

1940
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:42,350
have like how many behind us there's two yeah i don't feel
safe at all four is 4 is 20, and then 5, 6, 7 are 16.

1941
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:47,070
And then 8 is 14, and 10th is 11.

Yeah, that is no.

1943
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:51,730
And they can easily get, like, a points for this.

1944
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:53,550
Yeah, we should just be careful.

1945
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,490
We just play normal.

1946
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:56,510
Everyone's just...

1947
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:58,810
That means we're just the same rank as...

1948
01:40:58,810 --> 01:40:59,510

2030
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,640
I haven't found a single evac.

2031
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:41,920
Yes, you have.

2032
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,560

2034
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,420

2035
01:47:47,420 --> 01:48:02,880
just not large right back i'm not found a backpack yet i
still don't understand how to loot this oh i found a

2036
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:10,000
repeater but i already have a kidded carbide oh i could have
a kidded action we should probably rotate fast this one to

2037
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:21,120
be honest i'm gonna run run a repeater decide figure out
where to grab the uh the uh harvesters from yeah we could

2038
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,620
definitely do that but i mean i think retaining a sound
might be a little bit more important for us here in this one

2039
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:30,780
just if you want to get points and the zone's like super
easy bricked all right i'm heading to you is there anything

2040
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:38,040
good in the thing uh purple flat lines if you want to that
it's not bad uh i'm good i'm not gonna take the purple flat

2041
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:46,220
lines i guess oh i can take no i'm running repeaters i don't
want to run double heavy yeah i would do that i need a scope

2042
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:51,860
though for my repeater You could just get it two times off
the flat line if you want to.

2043
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:52,780
Oh, I could.

2044

We're gonna Valkalty right when you go.

2104
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:21,320
We'll turn back and make sure we're not getting walked up
bomb by Lava Siphon.

2105
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:23,080
We're good.

2106
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:23,860
I'm good.

2107
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:24,900
All right, ready?

2108
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:25,420

Come here.

2110
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:29,460
Okay, nice.

Nice.

2113
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:32,120
Huge for me.

2114
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:32,520
Huge for me.

2115
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:33,120
Turning Baron.

2116
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,980
Are we trying to just go into like...

2117
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,800
Yeah, we're gonna get like through the Lava Siphon.

2118
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:38,200
Holy shit.

2119
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:38,860
That was good.

2120
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,140
There was team right next to us.

2121
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:42,080
Yep, that was great.

2122
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:42,580
It was a redeploy.

2123
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:43,720
That's fine.

2124
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:47,540
Oh, they're taking it.

2125
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:49,100
Oh, yeah, we can't go there.

2126
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:49,500
Come back.

2127
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,080
We'll go back left.

2128
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:50,640
We're good.

2129
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,820
Go into the tunnel.

2130
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:53,920
Yeah, we're going right side.

2131
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:54,300
Go left side.

2132
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:54,560
We're good.

2133
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:55,200
We're going to be here.

2134
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:55,540
We're showing.

2135
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,640
We're going to walk up here on left side.

2136
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:57,560
Yeah, I'm just going to heal.

2137
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:58,800
Yeah, you're good.

2138
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,080
Heal up first, then we'll go this way.

2139
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,000
I'm going to start walking up to make sure they don't take
space in us.

2140
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:03,500
I do.

2141
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:04,920
I have 70 bullets.

2142
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,160
I need light ammo.

2143
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:08,420
I have none.

2144
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:10,040
Try to see what's free right now.

2145
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:10,660
Just keep moving left of me.

2146
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:11,720
I am hell.

2147
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:12,520
I need light ammo.

2148
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,460
Is there anyone on the Twitch rivals?

2149
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,020
It's fine.

2150
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:17,600
There's no one over here.

2151
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,380
We're going to take this house instead.

2152
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:18,960
Keep coming.

2153
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:20,180
We're good.

2154
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,220
Nice.

2155
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:21,720
Good rotate, guys.

2156
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:22,300
We're in a great spot.

2157
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:22,900
Yay.

2158
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,600
This might be the exact same time I played.

2159
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:29,440
Remember when I told you about the, you heard my Twitch
Prime stuff, right, Wig?

2160
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:30,320
Yeah, yeah, I did.

2161
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:33,220
Ten minutes later, I have a hype train on my channel.

2162
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:34,260
Nice.

2163
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,980
On my Twitch chat.

2164
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:37,500
Nice.

2165
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,160
Where's my hype train, guys?

2166
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:41,280
Guys.

2167
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:44,560
Thanks.

2168
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,180
Thanks, guys.

2169
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,700
Hey, guys, where's my life train, dude?

2170
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:53,680
Guys, switch prime over here.

2171
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,600
Switch prime over here, guys.

2172
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:59,400
They used up all the Twitch prime finishers for my channel.

2173
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,360
I need to...

2174
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,000
Tempo, can you do this a little bit differently down here?

2175
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:03,740
Can you block the doors?

2176
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,760
Holy shit, I fucking cracked him.

2177
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:06,380
Yeah, which ones?

2178
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:07,620
Just block both doors.

2179
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:08,240
Yeah, block both doors.

2180
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,300
Actually, block the front one.

2181
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,840
Block the front one.

2182
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:11,580
Don't block this one.

2183
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2184
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:15,100
I broke their fucking jet.

2185
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:16,660
Yeah, fuck him.

2186
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:17,320
Good shit.

2187
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,440
And I cracked him.

2188
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,460
I'm gonna try to get purple off my sentinel.

2189
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:21,300
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to.

2190
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:21,800
Same.

2191
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:22,760
I also have a sentinel.

2192
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,160
Yeah, I charged it up.

2193
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,240
Might have ripped a little bit.

2194
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,080
We're in a really good spot.

2195
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:27,520
I'm pretty sure that- Can I play on the penis?

2196
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:30,940
Uh, you said do you want to play on the penis?

2197
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,800
Don't repeat what you dropped it to you?

2198
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,620
I wouldn't- I would rather you not play the cock.

2199
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,940
Because if you get- if you get knocked then we can't do
anything about it.

2200
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:47,140
I think for- I think for this- I think for this zone, have a
little bit more locked in because i think teams will start

2201
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:51,420
to rotate in a little bit because it was last game so i
think this game is going to be easier for us to play like

2202
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:55,280
correctly if that makes sense just keep a look down on the
right side here two temples you don't get walked up yeah i'm

2203
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:01,620

01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:45,740

01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,120
No, we're going to go.

2263
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,300
We're going to back go.

2264
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:48,700

01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:49,000

01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,900
Where the fuck was that pool?

2269
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,520
Banana phone.

2270
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,100
We're going right back to fragment.

2271
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,680
Maybe that pole is literally terrible.

2272
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:57,220
All right.

2273
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:58,320
Which fragment we're losing?

2274
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,360
Where do we go?

2275
01:56:59,580 --> 01:56:59,720
Where do we go?

2276
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:00,520
Diner would be best.

2277
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,240
Diner would be best.

2278
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:02,000
What?

2279
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:02,660
I don't know if it's going to be fixed.

2280
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,040
Don't we want to play a building that...

2281
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,160
Oh wait, diner does have doors.

2282
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:07,180
Diner has doors.

2283
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:07,840
Yes, he does.

2284
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:08,360
Good job, buddy.

2285
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:09,940
You can't wait.

2286
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:10,960
How do you get in?

2287
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:11,160
Wait, wait.

2288
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,520
And it didn't have doors.

2289
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:13,100
Come on.

2290
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,520
I think there's people in that building.

2291
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:16,460
We're going to land right here.

2292
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:16,820
Land right here.

2293
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:17,280
That's what I'm saying?

2294
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:21,260
I'll leave the same one in here.

2295
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:21,540
We're good.

2296
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:21,940
We're good.

2297
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:22,860
Oh, that was close.

2298
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:23,420
We're good.

2299
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,180
Diner has doors.

2300
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:27,400
Diner has doors, big.

2301
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:29,040
A lot of these buildings do have doors, correct?

2302
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:29,860
Nice.

2303
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:30,320
Give it a take.

2304
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:35,400
If it now pulls back somehow, I will be very sad and
extremely disappointed, but it's all good to life.

2305
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:37,280
Tim, okay, I have one battery, please, sir.

2306
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,260
Uh, I dropped that here.

2307
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:41,240
Okay, nice.

2308
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,400
Oh, wait, we don't have this floor.

2309
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:42,980
What the fuck?

2310
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:43,820
No, no, no, no.

2311
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,980
Wait, we're going to just play a little bit.

2312
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:46,060
We're playing a little bit spastic right now.

2313
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,020
We're just going to play a little bit of 12.

2314
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:47,560
All right, I mean, I have two shield cells.

2315
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,100
Tim, do you have extra shield cells or no?

2316
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:51,320
Uh...

2317
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,080
Guys, they're going to try to push us here.

2318
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:54,440
Let's just stay focused here.

2319
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:55,780
They're going to try to push us.

2320
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:59,040
So we're going to hold the top side, and we're just going to
play on the second floor.

2321
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:00,060
Second floor is probably up.

2322
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:00,600
All right.

2323
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,160
Let me block off as much of this bottom floor as I can.

2324
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,480
Pebble, do you have extra shield cells or no?

2325
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:07,160
Yeah, I have 10.

2326
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:08,100
Yeah, I have two.

2327
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,020
Can you give me just three?

2328
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:11,960
Or two, just two.

2329
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:13,960
Oh, wait, you're right here.

2330
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:16,020
I'm talking about here.

2331
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,480
I'm dropping an eight.

2332
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:20,300
When you can, can you get more barrels on the second floor?

2333
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,400
Just because we're going to get a push probably.

2334
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:24,080
Just trying to pluck off all of the first floor.

2335
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,080
No, you're good.

2336
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:24,720
You're good.

2337
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:24,960
You're good.

2338
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:25,160
You're good.

2339
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:29,160
This zone might pull towards no name, but I'm pretty
confident it's going to go towards us.

2340
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:29,700
We'll see how it goes.

2341
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:30,760
I do.

2342
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,340
Oh, I don't have all locked off.

2343
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:33,540
I'm going to go top floor now.

2344
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:33,780
Yeah.

2345
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:34,900
Yeah, do your thing.

2346
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:35,160
You're good.

2347
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:37,660
I was like 12.

2348
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:39,380
Why do I have eight nades?

2349
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:41,000
Bro, what the fuck?

2350
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,160
Why do you have eight nades?

2351
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,700
A lot of this pool is pretty fucking crazy.

2352
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,140
All right.

2353
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:45,940
In 10 seconds, we'll find out.

2354
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,620
Well, suit happens.

2355
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,340
I mean, I mean, Jesus Christ.

2356
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,060
All I know is.

2357
01:58:51,940 --> 01:59:01,200
rotate got me a charge rifle so we win okay okay the zone is
getting smaller so i don't know all right well there we go

2358
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:09,060
sound pulls no name it's right we back tower into like one
of the no-name buildings can you no can we can you scan this

2359
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:16,340
uh rv here real quick or no i don't know if i can reach it
i'll try i think we can all right reach this team might look

2360
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:22,120
ridiculous they're leaving or not there's one guy in there
okay i mean i don't want to go there early but i do want to

2361
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:22,980
kind of go there.

2362
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,080
Could we break out left?

2363
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:24,660
A little bit.

2364
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,360
I don't know if there's anyone.

2365
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,700
I want to wait a little bit longer.

2366
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:27,860
If you're next scan and see how it goes.

2367
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:31,600
Because this team and this team behind us on top side,
Diner's going to try to fight us.

2368
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,420
But I want to try to get to this if we can.

2369
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:35,280
I don't know if we can though.

2370
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:37,380
We can play inside.

2371
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,940
Do you want me to scan the RV again?

2372
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:39,700
Yeah, yeah.

2373
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,320
You're going to scan RV just yet again.

2374
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:44,300
There's two people now.

2375
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,180
It's two.

2376
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:48,660
But like if we go up there and cost gold, it should be
fucking free.

2377
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,380
But then the team behind us is going to.

2378
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,360
No, I know.

2379
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:56,760
we lose anyone we're gonna have to fight something there's
no way we get in there for we try to run that side and then

2380
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:00,680
evac from behind this big ass rock no because there's gonna
be a team on cliff that's gonna probably shoot us out

2381
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:06,540
there's definitely a team up there no no no the team the
walton fence over there that team moved down i just saw it

2382
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:21,160
so we should be fine then yeah i think we do drift left side
then a little bit let's He's a bat.

2383
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:21,700
He's a bat.

2384
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,260
Want me to give you the point?

2385
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:25,160
I can put an evac right now.

2386
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:27,000
I don't even know if we can land anywhere.

2387
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:27,580
Try not to evac.

2388
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:27,940
Try to evacuate.

2389
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:28,280
Let's see.

2390
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:28,620
Okay.

2391
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,100
They're double red inside here, too.

2392
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,360
I mean, we might just be able to land on one of the
buildings to be.

2393
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,520
If we're getting shut off, just get off.

2394
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:35,080
Okay.

2395
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:35,660
Just keep coming.

2396
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:36,040
Keep going.

2397
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:37,320
Keep following me.

2398
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:38,800
I'm going out of the world for this.

2399
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:39,720
We're going to land.

2400
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,460
We're going to land for RV.

2401
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:41,520
There's no one in RV right now.

2402
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:42,220
We're going to go RV, okay?

2403
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:43,180
Get in there?

2404
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:43,560
Right here.

2405
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:44,120
Right here.

2406
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:44,820
This RV right around.

2407
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:46,200
Oh, my God.

2408
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:46,960
The door just closed.

2409
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:51,600
No, I don't.

2410
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:52,360
Okay, we're good.

2411
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,060
We're in a great spot.

2412
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:53,920
We are big ass head.

2413
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:56,180
Now we're good to go.

2414
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:56,480
Nice.

2415
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:56,940
Good job, guys.

2416
02:00:57,140 --> 02:00:59,400
Yeah, see, Liv, Tempo and I, we did it.

2417
02:00:59,520 --> 02:00:59,940
We helped.

2418
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:00,820
Nice job, guys.

2419
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:01,420
Big ass head.

2420
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:03,140
It was in my crap way.

2421
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,240
Good shit, dude.

2422
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,120
All right, now we somehow have to...

2423
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:08,860
Yeah, glass side is actually probably better here, so.

2424
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,160
We want to stay alive.

2425
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,800
Do you want me to scan west side or east side?

2426
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,460
What do you want to scan?

2427
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:13,860
No matter.

2428
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:14,380
Let's see.

2429
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:15,300
Right now, I'm probably more.

2430
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,160
You're good to talk, guys.

2431
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:17,060
You're good.

2432
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:17,120
You're good.

2433
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:19,700
I'm so safe.

2434
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:20,840
I'm very safe.

2435
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:21,320
as well, we're good.

2436
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,180
Let's keep putting those barrels down, reviving.

2437
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,020
The grenade, those seats will really help us.

2438
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:28,420
We're in zone to go again, we're good.

2439
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:32,500
We're gonna literally, tempo, we're gonna get more traps on
this side of RV, okay?

2440
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:33,980
cause we're gonna get sent on from this side.

2441
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:37,340
So any, prioritize any traps and also any in the window up
here too.

2442
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:38,800
If you can just put them on top of the windows, as well,
we're good.

2443
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:41,160
And even blocking doorway.

2444
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:41,660
I'm trying to get some light ammo.

2445
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,600
Don't be afraid to block doorway, combo when we're inside
somewhere, we're good.

2446
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,480
There's like 10 million nades down here, by the way.

2447
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:49,480
One, two, three, oh my God, we are all just chinging.

02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:52,220
Keep putting more traps down.

2450
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:53,220
I'm cool down on the side.

2451
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:55,800
Somebody was rezzing.

2452
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:57,380
What the fuck is rezzing?

2453
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:01,420

Let us live.

2458
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:09,720

2459
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:12,440
No, I sounds this way.

Here and here and here and here.

2479
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:58,800
I can't thirst for my own thing, though.

2480
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,920
Yo, we have 10 million nades.

2481
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:02,500

We're gonna not have 10 million nades, dude.

2483
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,220
Yeah, we probably can't get any of this.

2484
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:07,940
Fuck, it didn't work.

2485
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:09,320
Wait, the other team's pushing the way.

2486
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:09,840
I should get it.

2487
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:13,160
Oh, my God, we're just in level 6 hype train.

2488

2489
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,480
I mean, right here, right here.

2490
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:14,960
Right here.

2491
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,420
Focus on my side.

2492
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:16,460
Focus on the side right now.

2493
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:17,540
I'm focusing on the side, too.

2494
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:18,260
I'm focusing on the side.

2495
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:18,940
Okay, okay.

2496
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,020
Because I saw them before running.

2497
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,080
Don't be afraid to throw ulti if we need to jump on the
southwest side.

2498
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:23,500
Yeah, yeah.

2499
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:24,600
There was someone here.

2500
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,160
No, you're right.

2501
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:25,640
They're definitely.

2502
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:26,080
They're getting shot.

2503
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:26,800
They're getting shot up top side.

2504
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:27,460
They're getting shot up.

2505
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:29,720
I'm playing outside a little bit to get some panels.

2506
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:32,300
I'm shooting this team to the northwest.

2507
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:39,400
This kid is still peeking me inside.

2508
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:40,080
Get a job.

2509
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:41,880
This is his job.

2510
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:44,040
Please.

2511
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:46,280
You horny motherfucker.

2512
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,160
Got one.

2513
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:48,500
Got a kill.

2514
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:48,940
Nice.

2515
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:50,780
Full knock.

2516
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:53,700
Wait, that's not even your trap.

2517
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,180
No, it's not.

2518
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:58,700
I was getting fucking gassed by a different trap.

2519
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:01,220
We're good.

2520
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:02,400
Okay, so we're gonna move left side here.

2521
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,420
We're gonna go left side rock, okay?

2522
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:05,180
We're gonna break out of your left and move that side.

2523
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:05,720
Oh my God.

2524
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:06,340
That's your all.

2525
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:07,740
Oh, yeah, we're good, we're good.

2526
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:08,760
Are you pushing us?

2527
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:09,780
Yeah, yeah, they're all there.

2528
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:10,180
Push us.

2529
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:11,300
All this, all this, all this, tempo.

2530
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:11,720
All this tempo.

2531
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:12,840
I all did.

2532
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:13,260
I all did.

2533
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:15,020
I'm on me, on me, on me.

2534
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:15,880
Last guy's two left.

2535
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:16,800
I can't do anything.

2536
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:17,700
You need to go crazy, your tempo.

2537
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:18,180
Nice.

2538
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:19,340
Nice.

2539
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:21,960
You're good, you're good, you're good.

2540
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,160
You're good.

2541
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:23,580
You're dead.

2542
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:24,460
You're so dead.

2543
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:25,120
You're dead.

2544
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:25,720
We got second.

2545
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:26,420
Oh, wait.

2546
02:04:26,620 --> 02:04:26,800
Oh, wait.

2547
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:27,280
We got second.

2548
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,180
What the fuck happened?

2549
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,060
Wait, what the fuck?

2550
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:31,700
How did everybody die?

2551
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:33,460
I was so confused.

2552
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:34,100
Why?

2553
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:34,880
It was just there.

2554
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:35,540
I have no idea.

2555
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:36,180
I have no idea.

2556
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:37,520
Wait.

2557
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:40,460
There were five teams alive and then all of a sudden there
was two.

2558
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:41,940
Well, that's what happens, bro.

2559
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,780
Because there's just no one in the lobby to start.

2560
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:44,560
It's so hard to predict.

2561
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,700
How many kills do we get?

2562
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:49,080
Oh, shit.

2563
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:49,740
I got second place.

2564
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:50,640
I got second place.

2565
02:04:50,880 --> 02:05:07,360

2569
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:22,820
Oh my god.

02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:27,520
Thank you to my Twitch chat for giving me a level 7 hype
train to celebrate.

2571
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:27,820
Oh my god.

2572
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:30,020
Guys, I still have a level 0 here, guys.

2573
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:32,120
We still have a hype train.

2574
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:34,120
Guys, I still have a level 0, guys.

2575
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:38,540
If anyone wants to change that, I'm like, I was...

2576
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:42,540
How do you still have a level 0 hype train after all that?

2577
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,860
That's insane to make fun of you.

2578
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:44,560
Oh shit.

2579
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,420
Wig, even I have a level 5 hype train.

2580
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,060

2585
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:22,580
I'm going to use the bathroom.

2586
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:23,840
Entertain my chat, please.

2587
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:25,400
All right, guys, you know, listen to the chat.

2588
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:26,720
I know you guys have a game.

2589
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:27,740
Our game's not in.

2590
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,340
You guys have a sub-train over at Doki Burr's chat.

2591
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:32,820
But listen, man, nice week's chat's pretty rad, too.

2592
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:33,840
And we don't have a sub-train.

2593
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:38,400
So if you guys want to change that and, you know, change
history, that would be pretty pop.

2594
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:39,380
Oh, you're not gone yet?

2595
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:39,700
My bad.

2596
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,280
I mean, guys, keep going.

2597
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,460
Doki should get a level 100.

2598
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:43,300
She deserves that.

2599
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:49,090
Bro, why can't I, why can't I hear my own stream right now?

2600
02:06:49,130 --> 02:06:49,630
What is going on?

2601
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,370
This is so weird.

2602
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:59,550
Oh, someone like dual sense controller or what?

2603
02:06:59,850 --> 02:07:00,390
A phone.

2604
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:27,010
I think, I think, I think Vals could be really good for us,
bro.

2605
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:40,310
All right.

2606
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,970
We're back.

2607
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:44,570
Let's check the Discord.

2608
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,220
Where's the LDS Discord?

2609
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,340
Let's see.

2610
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:02,000
Okay.

2611
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:02,420
Challenges.

2612
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:03,120
Check it three.

2613
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:05,540
We were lobby 15.

2614
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:13,830
Any announcements?

2615
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:45,600
I've spooked I spilled a whole thing of gamer thigh juice or
anime thigh juice in my fucking counter again I'm not I

2616
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:48,220

2618
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:20,510

happened so fast yeah no when I'm usually so attentive to

2619
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:20,510
that.

2620
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:26,090
Like when I went to the backside of the RV to start shooting
people, there was five teams.

2621
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:28,590
And then when you were like, throw your costicle, then I
threw it.

2622
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:30,530
Then all of a sudden there were two teams.

2623
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:32,030
And I was like, oh, it's already over.

2624
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:38,430
I couldn't believe that, like if I knew that was two teams
alive, I would have swung on the left side and just would

2625
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:39,570
have fought across the tracks.

2626
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:40,870
Because I don't think that was only a duo.

2627
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:42,370
It's insane.

2628
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:43,090
I can't believe that.

2629
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:45,030
I'm usually so attentive to how many teams are alive.

2630
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:46,970
And I did not believe how fast that went down.

2631
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:47,710
Chaos.

2632
02:09:48,770 --> 02:09:50,590
literally little cash

2633
02:09:56,660 --> 02:10:09,640
okay my page is refreshing all right let's see where are we
now tell until our next game probably a little while yeah 10

2634
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:17,180
yeah i'd say like 10 just because the because the other uh
the other lobbies have to finish too oh yo we should warm up

2635
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:26,080
we can't combine unless warm up yeah we should i'm pretty
i'm recently warm to be honest But the fact that you're not

2636
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,500
kind of scares me a little bit.

2637
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,340
I hope we're seeing at least more than 40 frames.

2638
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,600
Guys, we should totally we should play some trios.

2639
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:41,980
Thank God that they didn't this team inside that RV did not
hit any wingman shots on us.

2640
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:42,460
Oh, yeah.

2641
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:43,180
Thank fucking God.

2642
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:43,580
Yeah.

2643
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,120
That would have been so bad for us.

2644
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:46,380
He went like 0 for 7 on us.

2645
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,340
This is when we when we were about to fly into the RV.

2646
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:52,120
And you said RV almost flew into the wrong one.

2647
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:53,960
Oh, wait, which one?

2648
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:54,960
Isn't there one RV?

2649
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:57,720
No, there's one on the other side of the tracks.

2650
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,540
I was like, okay, yeah, I'll fly there.

2651
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:01,360
And then I was like, oh, wait, there's people there.

2652
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:07,480
Imagine you landed across, probably would have been so
fucked.

2653
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:11,220
Who would have died so early if we didn't have a cost to get
that RV with you there?

2654
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:12,200
Oh, yeah, 100%.

2655
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:12,640
Yeah.

2656
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,400
You're literally got knocked around.

2657
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,960
There's been a trio pubs.

2658
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,400
It's like one trio pub.

2659
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:19,780
That's all you guys, I think we can make food, to be honest.

2660
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:20,480
Oh, you're going to make food?

2661
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,580
All right, Temple, get in here.

2662
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:31,180
where are you oh i invited you let's go wait can we leave
trios and not get a penalty thingy yeah yeah we can't oh

2663
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:39,360
yeah it's a pub it's a fucking pub you can't leave gun run
now i know that yeah you can i literally left my pub 10

2664
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:50,840
kills what was our what was our final score like our final
placement fifth yeah we're two point two points away from

2665
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:56,720
two points away from fourth i can't believe we got nine
points and we only went up two placements that's actually

2666
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:03,920
crazy yeah well don't forget we had a pretty fucking shit
third game that's pretty that's true yeah our third game was

2667
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:11,420
pretty rough gustav gustavs are same way same with our
second game we went to track across the fucking river of

2668
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:21,540
death but hey we survived we got top 10 every time really
did good job guys that's fun i actually had to shoot my

2669
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:27,500
weapon a little bit that was a good time I just can't
believe how fast that went to two squads.

2670
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:28,780
I'm kind of sad I didn't recognize that.

2671
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:29,500
I'm watching it.

2672
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:30,860
I'm watching it back right now.

2673
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:32,220
Yeah, I didn't realize.

2674
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:35,040
It's like everybody just died so fast.

2675
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:36,900
Yeah, and there's no reason for that either.

2676
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:38,060
There's a lot of spots that are playable.

2677
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:41,820
I just thought if I knew that was happening, I would have
100% told us to see it out of the trophy.

2678
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:42,840
I saw us die.

2679
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:43,780

I was like, all right, well, six of 4KB.

2682
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:48,500
We should still make it.

2683
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:49,040
But I saw second.

2684
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:50,500

2735
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:48,850

Oh, what?

2746
02:18:05,350 --> 02:18:05,650

02:18:05,890 --> 02:18:06,970
And I turned offline.

2748
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:07,690
Only you do that.

2749
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:08,330
I did.

2750
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:09,690
You're out of work.

2751
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:10,090
You did.

2752
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:10,710
Only you.

2753
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:14,170
There's only one in the world that would.

2754
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:17,590
I can't believe you didn't know that.

2755
02:18:21,610 --> 02:18:23,010
Where are we going for this one?

2756
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:25,810
I'm trying to figure out where people are going.

2757
02:18:26,450 --> 02:18:28,310
I'll make my drink that I need after this game.

2758
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:28,570

unorganized okay yeah so there's like five five six teams

2789
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:53,380
that i recognize maybe they'll fight maybe maybe they'll
fight each other cedo tree all right so tree is taken cedo

2790
02:21:53,380 --> 02:22:02,660
is taken so we can't land there on storm point um honestly
we probably can we can grab pylon our launch pad still

2791
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:12,360
that's that's still open pylon launch pad yeah like okay so
barometer pylon launch pad devastated echo coastal that

for storm point and then for world's edge launch dome stacks

2793
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:31,680
mod it's all open so if if someone decides to late go to
stacks or some then we can veer off to launch okay launch

2794
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:38,680
site if we need to wait so there's someone going mod stacks
potentially no no no i'm just saying someone oh someone is

2795
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:46,860
going launch site okay so yeah we should have no one should
be mod stacks in dome okay what i can see okay but obviously

2796
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:47,440
you never know

2797
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:56,630

ready team two is literally just like absolute fucking early

2803
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:42,810
rounds challenge.

2804
02:23:43,310 --> 02:23:43,310
Yeah.

2805
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:43,650
Yeah.

2806
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:45,710
So we can, we can just have them run everyone over.

2807
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:46,150
Yeah.

2808
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:46,750
That's what I'm going to say.

2809
02:23:46,850 --> 02:23:47,930
They're definitely going to three.

2810
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:51,790
They're, they literally, they fall off after end of every
challenge circuit.

2811
02:23:51,890 --> 02:23:54,950
So they do horrible in files every time, but they are just
early round.

2812
02:23:56,010 --> 02:23:57,410
We're on a, we're on a hype train.

2813
02:23:58,610 --> 02:23:59,450
Oh shit.

2814
02:24:01,690 --> 02:24:02,190
Oh my God.

2815
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:03,870
Wig, you're finally on a hype train.

2816
02:24:04,350 --> 02:24:04,530
Wig.

2817
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:05,490
Let's go.

2818
02:24:05,710 --> 02:24:06,790
You did it.

2819
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:10,250
I knew you It's because my hype train ended.

2820
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:12,530
Yeah, unfortunately.

2821
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:14,810
So they transferred over to you.

2822
02:24:15,030 --> 02:24:15,810
Yeah, transfer to mine.

2823
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:19,290
Oh yeah, I forgot she's not actually doing anything on this
channel.

2824
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:20,190
Let me just go to this one.

2825
02:24:22,130 --> 02:24:24,470
Oh yeah, she's actually has not even said a word yet.

2826
02:24:30,210 --> 02:24:30,510
Alrighty.

2827
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:33,430
Let's fucking do it, bro.

2828
02:24:34,610 --> 02:24:35,590
What are we waiting for?

2829
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:36,870
Start.

2830
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:46,270
are they like ready no all right so literally just watch out
for those two that team two no joke okay where are they

2831
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:52,310
landing um i have no idea we should definitely hopefully not
be near them though they're gonna probably take a really

2832
02:24:52,310 --> 02:25:01,670
good po off okay tempo where are they landing analysis now
see they don't care whenever i say no they don't care i'm

2833
02:25:01,670 --> 02:25:07,110
back if it was imperial how though they would care yeah if
it was wing that said no Do you have the way I said don't

2834
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:10,310
keepers said no and then they listed after I said no.

2835
02:25:11,290 --> 02:25:12,090
Okay, start.

2836
02:25:13,050 --> 02:25:13,710
I'm going to play.

2837
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:14,910
I'm going to play the same comp.

2838
02:25:15,050 --> 02:25:15,210
Okay.

2839
02:25:15,730 --> 02:25:16,190
I'll do blood.

2840
02:25:16,450 --> 02:25:17,630
So we should have.

2841
02:25:18,290 --> 02:25:20,350
Mod stacks and domes should be open.

2842
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,170
Yeah.

2843
02:25:22,450 --> 02:25:23,050
But we'll see.

2844
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:25,550
All right.

2845
02:25:25,610 --> 02:25:26,090
Well, we'll see what happens.

2846
02:25:26,310 --> 02:25:26,650
100%.

2847
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:27,110
Let's go, guys.

2848
02:25:27,810 --> 02:25:28,350
Let's do it.

2849
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:29,690
We have four games, man.

2850
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:31,010
Whatever happens here happens.

2851
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:33,070
Let's do it.

2852
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:34,970
I believe in us.

2853
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:36,170
Hmm.

2854
02:25:36,810 --> 02:25:37,250
I do too.

2855
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:38,910
I think round two will be like really hard.

2856
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:39,610
I mean, don't forget.

2857
02:25:39,830 --> 02:25:44,330
I want to also point out there's been like really good teams
that do not make it past round three.

2858
02:25:44,530 --> 02:25:45,630
So like I'm very proud of them already.

2859
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:47,050
Like I'm very proud of us already.

2860
02:25:47,210 --> 02:25:47,570
No joke.

2861
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:47,990
No troll.

2862
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:48,330
Let's go.

2863
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:50,430
Then why did Tempo say we can make it to finals?

2864
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:51,390
Because he's delusional.

2865
02:25:51,570 --> 02:25:54,670
I think we can.

2866
02:25:54,830 --> 02:25:55,470
It's just going to be hard.

2867
02:25:55,770 --> 02:25:56,030
We can do it.

2868
02:25:56,030 --> 02:25:57,270
What do you mean, delusional?

2869
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:57,930
Yeah.

2870
02:25:58,090 --> 02:25:58,710
What do you mean?

2871
02:25:58,790 --> 02:25:59,070
Delusional.

2872
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:02,890
I mean, there's a team right to our right.

2873
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:05,070
Wait, there is a team there.

2874
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,110
Yeah.

2875
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:11,070
with me here to stay with me are are those guys going stacks
then or i think they're are we getting do you think they're

2876
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:16,630
stretching to launch i don't know just stay on me just stay
on me yeah they're still they're still here one's going to

2877
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:22,750
mod are we getting that one team went mod okay so we go
stacks and i think that team is stretching to dome i think

2878
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:28,650
so as well um yeah they are there that's fine yeah just land
together here we should be okay this team's leaving i'm

2879
02:26:28,650 --> 02:26:35,670
getting uh i'll get the backside then i mean that kind of
sucks bro why are these guys taking over they probably

2880
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:40,050
didn't want to contest i gotta be honest but i respect them
not fighting us instead and just going to mod it's a good

2881
02:26:40,050 --> 02:26:49,530
call i already done the same thing all right one team dead
here we go nice not last guys not last place i'll take that

2882
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:55,770
all day you think i'm kidding i'm so happy about that let's
go baby i'm happy not last yeah you have no idea about that

2883
02:26:55,770 --> 02:27:05,870
let's go baby huge one all right so let's see how this goes
though man um we should realistically here in this Let me

2884
02:27:05,870 --> 02:27:06,690
see real quick, one sec.

2885
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:09,350
We should be able to get to Mirage.

2886
02:27:09,450 --> 02:27:10,810
I think it's going to be Mirage slash staging.

2887
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:11,550
Try to be real.

2888
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:13,690
So we should be able to move quick.

2889
02:27:13,830 --> 02:27:15,450
We definitely want to navigate like...

2890
02:27:15,450 --> 02:27:18,950
Let me scan this beacon while Dome is not looking at me.

2891
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:20,650
We have ring scan too.

2892
02:27:21,150 --> 02:27:22,690
Yeah, that's going to be like really big for us.

2893
02:27:22,770 --> 02:27:24,250
This ring console should help us at time.

2894
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:26,550
It's right there.

2895
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:28,410
Okay, there we go.

2896
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:29,210
It's going to be a lot of Fisher's zone.

2897
02:27:30,210 --> 02:27:32,150
It's not an easy rotate for us, but we can do it for sure.

2898
02:27:32,730 --> 02:27:33,170
Still positive.

2899
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:37,390
I am looting.

2900
02:27:38,010 --> 02:27:39,610
I'm like carbine hemlock.

2901
02:27:39,810 --> 02:27:40,990
I'm the best.

2902
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:41,610
Okay.

2903
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:45,790
Also, let's just watch out for mod to push us or do some
stupid shit.

2904
02:27:45,970 --> 02:27:46,610
Because they do know it.

2905
02:27:46,970 --> 02:27:47,430
No offense.

2906
02:27:47,550 --> 02:27:48,410
They do know it's us.

2907
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:51,310
And respectfully, people probably do want to push us.

2908
02:27:51,530 --> 02:27:51,890
We're being honest.

2909
02:27:51,950 --> 02:27:54,990
Should I do the do the player scan?

2910
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:55,450
Yeah.

2911
02:27:55,930 --> 02:27:56,250
Yeah.

2912
02:27:56,250 --> 02:27:57,610
I mean, if you think you're safe right now for sure.

2913
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:58,670
I'll try it for it now.

2914
02:27:59,010 --> 02:28:01,510
I can come up and body block for you if you need first.

2915
02:28:02,230 --> 02:28:02,650
Let's see.

2916
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:08,220
I'm doing it.

2917
02:28:08,860 --> 02:28:09,300
Yeah, go for it.

2918
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:10,380
Go for it.

2919
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,360
Blue backpack here, by the way.

2920
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:12,600
I need that.

2921
02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:16,760
Oh, they're gone.

2922
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:17,900
Oh, they're gone.

2923
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:19,240
That's a really fast rotation.

2924
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:23,300
Okay, then we can go to, we can go, we can go mod and then
grab their.

2925
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:24,780
Before I hit the XL.

2926
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,480
Yeah, we should, we should definitely get the EVO.

2927
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:27,860
I'm going to grab the EVO right now.

2928
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:29,400
We should start rotating out right now anyway.

2929
02:28:29,740 --> 02:28:31,240
I have four batteries, eight cells.

2930
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:33,480
I'm actually really good on meds, to be honest.

2931
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:34,380
Me too.

2932
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:34,960
Like, really good.

2933
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:36,200
There's also this one here too.

2934
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:40,980
Perfect.

2935
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:42,320
Because my ass is broke.

2936
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:43,460
That's fine.

2937
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:44,660
Do we want to take the replay?

2938
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:46,440
Yeah, we do for sure.

2939
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:47,520
Oh, wait for you.

2940
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,140
Yeah, you're good.

2941
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:53,460
I want to just get anyone have evacs or no.

2942
02:28:53,580 --> 02:28:54,040
Do we not get one?

2943
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:54,840
Nope.

2944
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:56,060
I didn't grab one.

2945
02:28:56,220 --> 02:28:56,780
I didn't see one.

2946
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:57,720
It's all good.

2947
02:28:57,780 --> 02:28:59,220
We can take this balloon, right?

2948
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:00,700
No, yeah, we should take the balloon for sure.

2949
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:01,640
Oh, wait, here.

2950
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:02,900
I dropped that.

2951
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:03,720
Oh, I'm good.

2952
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:03,920
I'm good.

2953
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:05,340
I don't have any energy.

2954
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:08,800
Alrighty.

2955
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:09,840
Where are we heading?

2956
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:11,440
We're going to land over to lava side by side.

2957
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:13,640
Lava side by the speed road down pretty quick.

2958
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,960
Yeah, we can grab that balloon too, to be honest.

2959
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:20,000
Yeah, I think we just go there and hit another balloon.

2960
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,680
Just land on this caterpillar balloon for now.

2961
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:26,820
And just scan inside this building and then we'll just hit
the balloon.

2962
02:29:27,580 --> 02:29:28,900
There's no one looting this whole site.

2963
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:30,160
They probably just left the radio, honestly.

2964
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,400
You want me to scan?

2965
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,440
Yeah, scan this front side building just in this one.

2966
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,240
Just scan it so I can run it on.

2967
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:35,460
Someone res.

2968
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:36,420
We're good.

2969
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:37,100
All right, I was hit this balloon.

2970
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,020
Yeah, someone did res.

2971
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:39,040
All right, let's go.

2972
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:40,540
Yeah, keep on moving.

2973
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:41,220
There's a team right here, though.

2974
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:41,480
We're good.

2975
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:42,700
We're going to go left side.

2976
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:43,460
Just going to keep over here.

2977
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:44,480
Sectional, right?

2978
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:47,140
Keep on moving the left side and we're going to hit it.

2979
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,900
We're going to hit a Valcolty probably and try to get in
somewhere.

2980
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:52,840
Time to be on middle side.

2981
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:54,800
We're going to hit a Valcolty for here.

2982
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:55,220
All right.

2983
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:57,900
Do the player scan or no?

2984
02:29:58,480 --> 02:29:59,480
Oh, actually, yeah.

2985
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:00,420
Yeah, might as well.

2986
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:01,340
100% do it.

2987
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:01,680
All right.

2988
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:02,880
No reason not to.

2989
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:03,220
And it gets away.

2990
02:30:03,220 --> 02:30:03,920

02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:06,220

All right, we're going to keep on walking in.

3063
02:32:50,390 --> 02:32:53,290
We're going to get height on this rock here, and then we're
going to hit the evo cache, and we'll go from there.

3064
02:32:55,210 --> 02:32:56,670
I'm going to take the height.

3065
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:58,150
It's like five seconds behind us.

3066
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:59,150
Yeah, you're good.

3067
02:32:59,230 --> 02:32:59,350
You're good.

3068
02:32:59,510 --> 02:33:02,030
I'm going to take the height of this, and then you guys
just, one of you guys just goes get the evo cache.

3069
02:33:02,210 --> 02:33:03,370
Okay, I'll get it.

Hey, you're valid.

3071
02:33:04,570 --> 02:33:04,970
I'm looking over.

3072
02:33:05,130 --> 02:33:06,370
We're going to scan just in case.

3073
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:08,170
Yeah, why not?

3074
02:33:08,270 --> 02:33:09,370
We're going to go through landslide?

3075
02:33:09,850 --> 02:33:10,170
No, no.

3076
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:11,410
We're going to go through staging for sure.

3077
02:33:11,510 --> 02:33:12,730
I am...

3078
02:33:12,730 --> 02:33:13,190
Oh, behind us.

3079
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:13,530
Flying in!

3080
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:14,090
Flying above us.

3081
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:15,130
We're going tunnelside.

3082
02:33:15,530 --> 02:33:15,870
Yep, yep.

3083
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:16,210
Lending on my height.

3084
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:17,650
Lending on you, yeah.

3085
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:20,230
We're going to fall right down.

3086
02:33:20,330 --> 02:33:20,690
We're going to go down.

3087
02:33:20,890 --> 02:33:21,250
There are.

3088
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:22,330
Teebees are here, too.

3089
02:33:22,590 --> 02:33:22,990
Come down.

3090
02:33:23,010 --> 02:33:23,230
Come down.

3091
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:24,350
Come down to the landslide, you can.

3092
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:25,750
We have no smoke.

3093
02:33:25,870 --> 02:33:26,090
Don't forget.

3094
02:33:26,170 --> 02:33:26,690
Just try to get it.

3095
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:27,570
Just keep going.

3096
02:33:27,570 --> 02:33:27,890
Oh my god.

3097
02:33:32,210 --> 02:33:33,110
They're sending us.

3098
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:33,430
They're sending us.

3099
02:33:34,270 --> 02:33:34,730
Go through tunnel.

3100
02:33:34,730 --> 02:33:34,930
Go through tunnel.

3101
02:33:37,590 --> 02:33:38,370
Go through tunnel.

3102
02:33:40,130 --> 02:33:40,770
I'm batting.

3103
02:33:40,850 --> 02:33:41,210
I'm batting.

3104
02:33:41,350 --> 02:33:42,070
Keep going through tunnel.

3105
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:42,550
Keep going through tunnel.

3106
02:33:42,930 --> 02:33:43,630
Oh, I don't think temple's dead.

3107
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:44,190
I don't think temple's dead.

3108
02:33:44,490 --> 02:33:44,810
Motherfuck.

3109
02:33:44,990 --> 02:33:45,370
I'm dead too.

3110
02:33:45,490 --> 02:33:45,830
Just keep running down.

3111
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:46,170
Okay.

3112
02:33:46,270 --> 02:33:47,050
I'm just going to run down.

3113
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:52,770
Oh, why are they doing that?

3114
02:33:53,590 --> 02:33:57,490
I would just honestly, honestly, Doki, wrap through the
landslide tunnel on the right if you can.

3115
02:33:57,850 --> 02:33:59,890
And then maybe I might go back around if you can.

3116
02:34:00,170 --> 02:34:00,230
Yeah.

3117
02:34:00,350 --> 02:34:01,630
I'm trying to get her banners.

3118
02:34:02,210 --> 02:34:07,530
champion but it's all good dude what are they doing i
guarantee that's feroe and the boys i will put we i right

3119
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:13,870
here and then go back um you could yeah you could just go
all around time to i don't know if you have time to go all

3120
02:34:13,870 --> 02:34:18,890
the way around you don't have an evac right uh no i don't i
would i would wait then here i just literally right here and

3121
02:34:18,890 --> 02:34:26,470
then go like maybe 30 seconds let me know when to go you
have meds i do yeah you should be fun and then you can res

3122
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:34,610
us over in the staging side like the crack house over there
oh okay i have like three I have like three syringes, one

3123
02:34:34,610 --> 02:34:35,110
Phoenix kit.

3124
02:34:35,490 --> 02:34:37,010
Let me know when I should go now, actually.

3125
02:34:37,650 --> 02:34:38,710
I would actually start moving now.

3126
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:40,190
Yeah, yeah, you guys are timed.

3127
02:34:40,990 --> 02:34:42,330
Yeah, only 40 seconds left.

3128
02:34:42,490 --> 02:34:43,310
There's an evac behind you.

3129
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:43,770
You're good, though.

3130
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:46,350
If these kids are routing it, then there's not much to say,
to be honest.

3131
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:47,890
No.

3132
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:50,230
Really unfortunate timing, though, huh?

3133
02:34:50,390 --> 02:34:50,910
Holy fuck.

3134
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:59,970
I think, I mean, if there's not here, you definitely get our
banner, though.

3135
02:35:00,070 --> 02:35:00,310
You're good.

3136
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:02,210
Just really depends if they're routing it or not.

3137
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:04,410
And I think you go res in that shack.

3138
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:05,750
You know the house I'm talking about, right?

3139
02:35:05,990 --> 02:35:06,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3140
02:35:07,230 --> 02:35:07,590
Okay, cool.

3141
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:08,450
Nice.

3142
02:35:08,990 --> 02:35:09,830
We can go to our loot too.

3143
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:11,130
We're going to have a balcony as well.

3144
02:35:11,230 --> 02:35:14,690
I'm going to go see if you have, we'll grab some of the meds
too.

3145
02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:15,570
They took the lead back.

3146
02:35:15,890 --> 02:35:16,730
That gets me need.

3147
02:35:16,850 --> 02:35:17,110
It's all good.

3148
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:17,410
No worries.

3149
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:18,790
All right.

3150
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:20,510
They go hit that res above us if you want.

3151
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:21,870
Not that one.

3152
02:35:21,970 --> 02:35:22,450
The left side one.

3153
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:23,010
Yeah.

3154
02:35:24,130 --> 02:35:25,430
The one that's like that little house.

3155
02:35:25,850 --> 02:35:26,430
The one in the house.

3156
02:35:26,690 --> 02:35:27,390
Oh yeah.

3157
02:35:27,990 --> 02:35:30,030
Just because we don't want to fucking immediately get sent
on.

3158
02:35:31,350 --> 02:35:34,930
And then we can go into staging, probably scan that beacon
to see where to go next.

3159
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:37,070
Do we get a point for being top 15?

3160
02:35:37,610 --> 02:35:41,910
yeah we do get a point which is good that's fine that's
great wow i can't believe they landed on my height in that

3161
02:35:41,910 --> 02:35:48,230
situation man hit a free rotate in the landslide tunnel
right over us probably thought you were solo or at least

3162
02:35:48,230 --> 02:35:53,970
they definitely did not trigger me i think they're like
they're just super confident in team fights i think i think

3163
02:35:53,970 --> 02:35:58,230
that was the really aggressive squad i'm pretty sure i mean
if you want to scope out the scenes doki you can go to the

3164
02:35:58,230 --> 02:36:02,490
front of staging i'm gonna look for you right now no one's
in staging we should probably just get there to be honest

3165
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:07,610
all right just go staging like bottom side yeah we just go
bottom like into the glass you Definitely can get a glass if

3166
02:36:07,610 --> 02:36:08,090
we need to.

3167
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:12,310
I'm going to go bottom side now then, because I don't have
that many meds.

3168
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:13,210
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

3169
02:36:13,350 --> 02:36:13,570
Do your thing.

3170
02:36:13,830 --> 02:36:15,590
I'm not going to go get a loot time, but we probably can't,
sadly.

3171
02:36:15,730 --> 02:36:15,910
Yeah.

3172
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:17,970
I'm right behind you.

3173
02:36:18,610 --> 02:36:20,390
It's definitely up to my two syringes.

3174
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:23,390
Damn, I had good loot, too, bro.

3175
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:23,850
That sucks.

3176
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:26,150
My charge rifle.

3177
02:36:26,770 --> 02:36:27,450
I know, man.

3178
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:29,650
Also, my ulti-xel is not going to have an ulti or an evac.

3179
02:36:29,870 --> 02:36:30,590
I can give you an ulti.

3180
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:34,130
Yeah, we probably should, because I think my ulti is going
to be super important here.

3181
02:36:34,810 --> 02:36:36,070
It's going to get in the zone and see what's good right now.

3182
02:36:36,830 --> 02:36:37,630
Am I gonna die from this?

3183
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:38,910
I think I might die from zone.

3184
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:41,290
All right, don't show too much presence here.

3185
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:42,290
Just play small.

3186
02:36:42,750 --> 02:36:42,950
Yeah.

3187
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:44,810
Yeah, I dropped my ultrasound here.

3188
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:46,610
Yeah, we're gonna take this.

3189
02:36:47,170 --> 02:36:47,730
Yeah, you're good.

3190
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:48,130
Do your thing.

3191
02:36:48,410 --> 02:36:50,950
I'm gonna pop this all the Excel and we're gonna try to fly
in somewhere, guys, all right?

3192
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:51,570
That's gonna be the play.

3193
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:53,330
We're gonna try to get...

3194
02:36:53,330 --> 02:36:54,050
I should scan beacon, right?

3195
02:36:54,810 --> 02:36:55,770
Yeah, if you can.

3196
02:36:55,990 --> 02:36:56,190
Sure.

3197
02:37:00,100 --> 02:37:00,580
Let's see.

3198
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:02,260
I don't give you guys...

3199
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:03,840
Do you guys need syringes because I can give you guys one?

3200
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:05,160
We're gonna play...

3201
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:05,660
No, it's fine.

3202
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:06,300
I'll take one, yeah.

3203
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:08,460
We're gonna drop down and we're gonna...

3204
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,380
Valkyledy from down below.

3205
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:10,360
You should actually do it up here.

3206
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:10,860
We're going to do it up here.

3207
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:11,620
All right.

3208
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,680
We're going to wait 30 seconds though.

3209
02:37:12,740 --> 02:37:13,880
We have to wait for my percentage to get up.

3210
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:14,880
Just play small here for now.

3211
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:17,560
We have 30, oh, but we have 30 seconds left.

3212
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:19,660
I think I'm going to get my ulti by the time now.

3213
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:20,560
By the time the zone closes.

3214
02:37:21,300 --> 02:37:22,100
I hope so.

3215
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:24,600
I mean, I hope so too, because then we definitely don't get
a zone.

3216
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,400
Keep moving towards me, guys.

3217
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:26,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3218
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:28,420
Here's the way I team fighting on that side.

3219
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:31,260
If we can somehow land in that fissure building.

3220
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:33,560
I want to try to get RV, you know what I mean?

3221
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:33,880
Down here.

3222
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:34,340
Oh, okay.

3223
02:37:35,460 --> 02:37:36,480
RV looks free too.

3224
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:37,260
Yeah.

3225
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:44,140
there the team above us is gonna be a real problem all right
we're gonna make a play here guys i don't really know what

3226
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:49,740
to do wait wait you know you can buckle from here right
where there okay yeah yeah yeah i think you can i think you

3227
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:55,820

not we can just play underneath here okay okay yeah it

3228
02:37:55,820 --> 02:38:01,280
should be fine what's that we're gonna figure it out soon

02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:09,520
Okay.

3232
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:09,560
Okay.

3233
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:11,800
Don't you just go.

3234
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:13,320
I can't even see.

3235
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:13,580
All right.

3236
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:14,900
Let's see if RV's free.

3237
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:15,880
If RV's free, we're playing there.

3238
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:16,100
Okay.

3239
02:38:17,820 --> 02:38:21,280
That was a scary shit out.

3240
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:23,200
I would just land on top Mirage.

3241
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:24,480
Wait, wait.

3242
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:25,140
We need to get a better spot.

3243
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:25,640
We're going to play underneath.

3244
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:26,100
We're going to play underneath.

3245
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:26,840
We're going to play underneath here.

3246
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:27,280
Okay.

3247
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:34,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, bro, you're so lucky.

3248
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:35,480
I called that out.

3249
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:35,960
Nice.

3250
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:36,320
Good job.

3251
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:38,360
I have fallen and I cannot get him.

3252
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:39,000
You're good, you're good.

3253
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:40,940
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

3254
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:41,800
I'm okay.

3255
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:42,320
Open the door for you.

3256
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:42,780
You're good now.

3257
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:44,320
Put barrels down, Tembo, put barrels down this side.

3258
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:45,080
This side when we're born.

3259
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:46,580
Yeah, we're gonna open this.

3260
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:50,840
You're scant didn't pick it up, but I saw it with my eyes.

3261
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:52,660
Why did my skin not pick it up?

3262
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:54,440
Yeah, you're scant didn't pick it.

3263
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:55,700
I was like, there's people.

3264
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:58,500
Oh, wait, I can take this back.

3265
02:38:58,560 --> 02:38:59,700
I have a backpack now, guys.

3266
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:00,580
Nice, great.

3267
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:03,460
I'm still broke.

3268
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:04,280
I'm once though.

3269
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:05,440
I'm not broke.

3270
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:05,760
Yeah, I'm busted, bro.

3271
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:07,580
You take some cells.

3272
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:08,460
Yeah.

3273
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,600
I'm surprised that we're even alive right now.

3274
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:11,280
Me too.

3275
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:12,520
Me too.

3276
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:13,640
Okay.

3277
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:14,400
There's a problem though.

3278
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:17,100
We have a Krabber team here with a double red.

3279
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:19,520
So like, bro, that is a problem.

3280
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:22,080
We just need to literally play small tempo.

3281
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:23,340
How long till your ulti gets back up?

3282
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:23,940
It's up.

3283
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:24,260
It's up.

3284
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:24,660
Okay.

3518
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:08,320
playing edge we should want to get one kill what do we mean

3526
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:21,980

though is that i always tell chat how bad rvs are and our
our life has really dependent on rvs yeah we got our pious

But the whole paintball side is looted.

3603
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:08,880
So I would assume they left.

3604
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,840
I could show presence first and see what's good.

3605
02:56:14,620 --> 02:56:15,200
I'll fly up.

3606
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:16,000
And if I die, just run.

3607
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:18,040
That's the chat.

3608
02:56:18,460 --> 02:56:19,400
I can't lie.

3609
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:20,700
They looted this like fucking horribly.

3610
02:56:20,820 --> 02:56:21,620
There's so much shit left.

3611
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:22,320
If you guys need anything.

3612
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:24,220
They like fast looted, I guess.

3613
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:26,860
Yeah, this team wants to just get the hell out of here
immediately.

3614
02:56:27,220 --> 02:56:28,120
Which I kind of respect.

3615
02:56:28,220 --> 02:56:29,000
It's like the right way to play.

3616
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:32,720
Oh, there's Bats here.

3617
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:33,800
Oh, yes.

3618
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:40,020
I need a sniper I'll let people scan it Yeah, you're good
Hit the people scan And then we'll hit the console beacon

3619
02:56:40,020 --> 02:56:46,060
again I think we just wait Till the zone closes To be honest
Okay, you want me to scan that or wait Um I would wait I

3620
02:56:46,060 --> 02:56:49,260
think we just played the top mod And then scan both Then we
just ripped it in Cause we're gonna be late to this No

3621
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:54,540
matter what So I'd rather know the next circle And see if
this is a crazy pull or not I don't think it should Oh Oh my

3622
02:56:54,540 --> 02:57:01,100
god Okay Team over at the drops Uh The fucking Evac tower I
see I see them They're taking the Evac Yeah I just want to

3623
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:04,280
land it Play together What the fuck They're good We're good.

3624
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:06,340
If they land on us, we're pretty close here.

3625
02:57:06,380 --> 02:57:07,300
They almost stuck me with an arc.

3626
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:08,300
Are they pushing us?

3627
02:57:08,760 --> 02:57:09,080
Oh.

3628
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:09,420
They are.

3629
02:57:09,860 --> 02:57:10,300
They're out of there.

3630
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:12,100
You know we have White.

3631
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:14,400
Oh, we're fucked.

3632
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:14,720
We're fucked.

3633
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:15,220
We're so fucked.

3634
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:15,980
Oh, yeah.

3635
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:17,840
Run if you can run.

3636
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:18,140
Run if you can.

3637
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:19,340
I'm trying to run.

3638
02:57:19,740 --> 02:57:20,360
I'm dead though.

3639
02:57:20,400 --> 02:57:21,720
I think it's out of you or me.

3640
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:23,260
Yeah, you guys split.

3641
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:24,240
They can't get all of us.

3642
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:25,320
They're not splitting.

3643
02:57:25,480 --> 02:57:26,140
We're next to each other.

3644
02:57:26,820 --> 02:57:28,000
Yeah, I think they definitely get all up first.

3645
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:29,260
No!

3646
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:31,900
I'm there at great second place.

3647
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:33,260
They know it's us, dude.

3648
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:34,460
They know it's us.

3649
02:57:35,460 --> 02:57:38,420
I think it's they know that we got white armor because we
didn't have evil.

3650
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:39,820
Yeah, we had white armor, yeah.

3651
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:40,900
Yes, them!

3652
02:57:42,560 --> 02:57:44,660
Oh my god, it's so stupid.

3653
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:47,420
They know we had white because we had no evil.

3654
02:57:48,580 --> 02:57:50,020
Just a fucking Ferelli boy kid.

3655
02:57:50,140 --> 02:57:52,240
Just a hard-stuck Challenger Circuit player.

3656
02:57:52,280 --> 02:57:52,680
Whoa!

3657
02:57:54,360 --> 02:57:55,560
I mean, it's true.

3658
02:57:55,640 --> 02:57:58,200
All he does is go to Challenger Circuit and they get shit on
in the finals.

3659
02:57:59,400 --> 02:58:00,900
Everybody in time, man.

3660
02:58:01,900 --> 02:58:08,960
how they play and they go to finals and get shit stomped
it's just annoying oh my god it's so frustrating ggs that's

3661
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:14,920
where that's okay we're still you need you need five points
a game to get into top 10 so we're good we're still we're

3662
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:20,620
still okay we're still don't worry we have two more games
wait wait wait wait wait wait is this is only four yeah this

3663
02:58:20,620 --> 02:58:27,860
is four we have two more games i think like they land dome
right yeah yeah they land dome or no they land uh launch

3664
02:58:27,860 --> 02:58:34,200
site dome yeah so they're they're gonna be they're gonna be
behind us every time now now we know we just got to dip the

3665
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:40,080
out immediately i mean we should be we should be fine uh
next next bracket or because we're storm point on the next

3666
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:45,020
one we're storm point for the next two so we're fine if
these guys in the lobby again they go long side down we know

3667
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:51,760
they're gonna do that again yeah yeah for around three yeah
100 oh one second you're good bro do you think fuck man that

3668
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:58,440
sucks because the right the right play for us there is to
wait to be honest 100 but they they know that that's us too

3669
02:58:58,440 --> 02:59:04,860
so they're like they full sent it it's not a bad play i'm
just salty but overall it's just annoying yeah we just they

3670
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:10,680
know we we had white too because we had no evo yeah it's so
rough the no the no player fan for us is pretty rough in

3671
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:17,360
that situation and also not having evo cash in front big mod
is tough too yeah i wonder if they were the same team that

3672
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:23,120
fucking ran at us last game too yeah yeah were they i think
it was i think it was because the horizon that landed on us

3673
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:28,860
yeah yeah yeah i think that yeah that was the same team that
landed on us so they'll always be like i think they'll

3674
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:41,460
always be like behind uh following us and mirroring us yeah
100 without it now they will pretty sure i think we just

3675
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:47,480
have to fast be faster in our rotation because like they'll
always be behind us so we'll we need it we just got to get

3676
02:59:47,480 --> 02:59:53,200
the the out yeah we got to dip the out the moment we yeah
the only problem is though in the next round like let's say

3677
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:57,400
we do make the next round and we go to world's edge and
these guys are behind us if big maw doesn't rotate we might

3678
02:59:57,400 --> 03:00:04,360
also not have stacks yeah true true true let's just find out
where do we want to go for stormpoint next two games what

3679
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:11,260
are we thinking i don't know i'm trying to i'm trying to see
no station i think these guys land there see those taken

3680
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:15,900
yeah yeah yeah she does i think everything's going to be
taken at stormpoint but we could still make it work yeah

3681
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:23,460
we'll see where everyone right has anyone no one claimed
stuff yet right now they they have uh but not everyone has

3682
03:00:23,460 --> 03:00:32,400
just when we like think of all the spots are free right now
that's what i'm trying to think the fucking map almost bro

3683
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:41,780
what am i watching uh where's my face oh i don't have it i
didn't see w keying everything look at this is what they do

3684
03:00:41,780 --> 03:00:47,640
every time they just literally never make it anywhere
because like you can't double key everything right around

3685
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:48,880
exactly yeah

3686
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:57,960
it's okay they have the they have the sick ass rank mindset
oh he's dead

3687
03:01:01,080 --> 03:01:02,420
What did they die to?

3688
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:04,220
Oh, nice job, guys.

3689
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:05,420
Seriously, great play.

3690
03:01:06,620 --> 03:01:08,020
They died to an actual team.

3691
03:01:09,080 --> 03:01:10,080
Yeah, I'm not salty at all, guys.

3692
03:01:10,260 --> 03:01:10,460
No worries.

3693
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:13,080
Bro, they died to...

3694
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:17,100
These guys just they play like it's ranked every game.

3695
03:01:17,300 --> 03:01:18,280
That's, that's what I just told you.

3696
03:01:19,060 --> 03:01:19,100
Yeah.

3697
03:01:19,100 --> 03:01:19,280
Yeah.

3698
03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:23,040
They would have died to like, no, but I'm sorry.

3699
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:24,640
They, they, they, they're somebody.

3700
03:01:25,820 --> 03:01:26,220
There's somebody.

3701
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:29,320
There's somebody in someone's heart, but like...

3702
03:01:29,320 --> 03:01:30,020
Road life is good.

3703
03:01:30,260 --> 03:01:31,000
Road life is actually pretty good.

3704
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:31,620
I know him.

3705
03:01:31,880 --> 03:01:32,440
Oh, you know him?

3706
03:01:32,880 --> 03:01:33,600
Yeah, he's pretty good.

3707
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:34,300
Oh, okay.

3708
03:01:34,640 --> 03:01:36,080
Wait, am I watching the same team as you?

3709
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:37,140
I think so.

3710
03:01:37,300 --> 03:01:39,120
No, but Bloodhound, Caustic, Bang?

3711
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:40,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3712
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:40,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3713
03:01:40,860 --> 03:01:41,460
Road Life is really good.

3714
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:41,960
Oh, okay.

3715
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:42,740
So there's some buddies.

3716
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:44,180
The dad is some buddies.

3717
03:01:45,260 --> 03:01:47,120
I mean, compare to us, everybody's somebody.

3718
03:01:48,620 --> 03:01:49,720
We're the part of the game plan.

3719
03:01:49,780 --> 03:01:52,100
I think everybody's everybody, and we're nobody's.

3720
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:53,900
Yeah, we're the nobody's here.

3721
03:01:54,080 --> 03:01:54,920
Yeah, 100%.

3722
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:56,520
We're the underdogs.

3723
03:01:58,380 --> 03:01:58,740
100%.

3724
03:01:58,740 --> 03:01:59,780
Without a fucking doubt.

3725
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:00,620
Follow for follow?

3726
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:03,800
All right, revive for revive.

3727
03:02:05,320 --> 03:02:05,760
What do you think?

3728
03:02:07,220 --> 03:02:10,000
Okay, so Tempo, how are you knowing where people are going?

3729
03:02:10,100 --> 03:02:11,240
Are they typing in a Discord or something?

3730
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:13,840
Oh, no, they were typing in game chat.

3731
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:18,180
Yeah, like they were typing the, like, they were doing all
the drops for in-game.

3732
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:18,460
Oh, shit.

3733
03:02:18,700 --> 03:02:20,160
You're calculating that through game chat.

3734
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:29,200
I was just writing down I was just writing down I was just
writing down crossing out all the stuff on the map.

3735
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:37,940
He's analyzing god damn thank you thanks for this is why we
have we have tempo let's just double check when we swap maps

3736
03:02:37,940 --> 03:02:43,900
here well that was a learning game for us now we know we got
to leave quick we don't have anything yeah let's see we just

3737
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:49,140
have to make it to that we have stuff we have to leave quick
because their team that team is like they'll just be right

3738
03:02:49,140 --> 03:02:53,780
behind us and yeah and also no offense to any of us here
they're just going to be distributed yeah no the hundred

3739
03:02:53,780 --> 03:03:00,040
percent you're going to win oh wait wait wait i have a plan
they're going to beat us okay okay next round assuming no

3740
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:08,920
those stacks and we do right we we hide in one of the
buildings and we rat those fucks okay and then we kill and

3741
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:16,960
then we kill one right we kill one we can't lose 3v2 right
we're still we're still gonna lose i think i think i think

3742
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:30,580
we win a 3v2 right same armor assuming there's no armor div
i think we can win 3v2 i think we'll win a 3v1 I don't know.

3743
03:03:30,860 --> 03:03:31,720
No, I think we can do 3v2.

3744
03:03:32,100 --> 03:03:32,780
Because they'll be...

3745
03:03:32,780 --> 03:03:34,200
Because, okay, this is what you do.

3746
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:36,060
When we rat them and we kill one, right?

3747
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:42,440
We gotta use that initial, like, two seconds of confusion
that goes through their brain and then kill the second one.

3748
03:03:42,580 --> 03:03:44,220
And then it's a 3v1, alright?

3749
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:45,720
That's the plan.

3750
03:03:46,100 --> 03:03:47,840
You gotta use psychological battles.

3751
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:49,640
We're gonna use the psychological battles here.

3752
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:53,880
We have two seconds after we rat one to kill the second,
because they will be confused.

3753
03:03:56,420 --> 03:03:57,220
Unless they're...

3754
03:03:57,220 --> 03:03:59,300
Are we really gonna risk your one game for that?

3755
03:04:00,040 --> 03:04:05,680
i think we do i think i think i think we do it and then we
t-bag the shit out of them okay wait do you think that's a

3756
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:13,200
smart thing to do our our two games that we have left no no
no it's next round no it's it's when we it's when we make it

3757
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:18,180
to next round okay okay okay if we make it to the next round
okay yeah if we make it to the next round we take step

3758
03:04:18,180 --> 03:04:22,420
because we're not on world's edge anymore right yeah we make
it to the next round we take stacks we rat them in a

3759
03:04:22,420 --> 03:04:29,160
building then we kill one from getting ratted then we kill
the second in the next like three seconds from confusion and

3760
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:35,400
then it becomes a 3v1 oh come on and yeah yeah because
they'll they'll have like three seconds of brain delay when

3761
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:41,480
they're like what what when they're like what just happened
and who just read it and who's where and what right and then

3762
03:04:41,480 --> 03:04:48,960
we use that delay to kill the second second person yeah and
then and then it's 3v1 and after we kill them we t-bag them

3763
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:56,040
oh wow you think so you're thinking like thinking like so
ahead in the future yeah yeah i was like i think also like

3764
03:04:56,040 --> 03:05:02,540
crazy because that's just if we win yeah if we get to the
third we definitely get one we don't like it's a hundred

3765
03:05:02,540 --> 03:05:09,560
percent we get one if we rat it's like it's like 70 we get
the second one in the matter of like in the in the confusion

3766
03:05:09,560 --> 03:05:17,980
and all the stuff the confusion again yeah that's seven yeah
we use confusion is super effective confusion is super

3767
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:26,600
effective depending on who you're fighting the only problem
is i don't think this works irl sadly controller players

3768
03:05:26,600 --> 03:05:35,860
okay confusion confusion that this is exactly why i don't
think we're gonna win a 2v3 confusion probability for

3769
03:05:35,860 --> 03:05:43,260
controller players is much higher than m and k players and
that's like why i think we won't win a dv2 instead of tempo

3770
03:05:43,260 --> 03:05:49,900
just shooting his gun he's gonna think about how to confuse
the players yeah i was 13 damage but like bro i got them so

3771
03:05:49,900 --> 03:05:57,620
stumped i gave the ptsd now they don't know what's going on
bro i gave them ptsd PTSD, they're gonna be like check every

3772
03:05:57,620 --> 03:05:59,440
fucking building now because of us.

3773
03:05:59,620 --> 03:05:59,920
Yeah, exactly.

3774
03:06:00,380 --> 03:06:03,080
And then you know what happens when they have to check every
little building?

3775
03:06:03,340 --> 03:06:04,040
They get slow.

3776
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:06,700
And then we can get ahead of them next time.

3777
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:08,400
You're so smart, man.

3778
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:10,540
Honestly, you're also so dumb.

3779
03:06:10,720 --> 03:06:11,180
It's unreal.

3780
03:06:11,420 --> 03:06:11,920
I love it, dude.

3781
03:06:12,300 --> 03:06:13,500
I thought I love you so much.

3782
03:06:15,980 --> 03:06:17,460
See I'm just dumb all around.

3783
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:18,060
That's nasty.

3784
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:22,280
But like Temple here, he tries to hide his dumbness.

3785
03:06:22,340 --> 03:06:23,560
What do you mean hide?

3786
03:06:25,680 --> 03:06:27,940
Hey, my brain is still here, okay?

3787
03:06:28,440 --> 03:06:30,600
My brain only disappears when I go to...

3788
03:06:30,600 --> 03:06:31,920
When I go...

3789
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:33,900
We literally play Apex Legends.

3790
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:35,060
We don't have brains.

3791
03:06:36,040 --> 03:06:36,540
Yeah, true.

3792
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:38,360
It's gone.

3793
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:39,460
Before your stones.

3794
03:06:39,820 --> 03:06:43,120
After the first two years of Apex, it's fucking long going.

3795
03:06:43,740 --> 03:06:44,440
You're so wrong.

3796
03:06:45,020 --> 03:06:46,040
You're so correct.

3797
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:49,140
Once you play Apex two years, you just automatically are
dumber.

3798
03:06:49,340 --> 03:06:50,020
That's just how it goes.

3799
03:06:50,900 --> 03:06:52,320
No, that's only controller players.

3800
03:06:52,700 --> 03:06:53,360
Oh, you think so?

3801
03:06:53,620 --> 03:06:55,360
They get affected twice as hard.

3802
03:06:55,720 --> 03:06:57,160
I actually think you might be right, bro.

3803
03:06:57,280 --> 03:06:59,480
I have definitely gotten way done before when I first
started.

3804
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:00,480
Wigs, like, wait a minute.

3805
03:07:00,640 --> 03:07:01,880
I'm a controller player.

3806
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:03,600
I was pretty smart, bro.

3807
03:07:04,960 --> 03:07:06,300
And I'm not smart anymore.

3808
03:07:06,460 --> 03:07:06,840
That's for sure.

3809
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:10,240
I've done some app questions, bro, on stream.

3810
03:07:13,080 --> 03:07:16,060
I said that streaming is like the Bimbo modification.

3811
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:18,740
One of those, are you smarter than a fifth grader things?

3812
03:07:18,940 --> 03:07:19,760
Yeah, have you ever taken one of those?

3813
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:20,640
No.

3814
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:21,800
I don't think I've ever passed it, bro.

3815
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:22,200
I'm not kidding.

3816
03:07:22,420 --> 03:07:23,000
Wait, really?

3817
03:07:24,080 --> 03:07:25,480
Wait, how far did you get?

3818
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:29,320
Yo, if it has like geography and stuff in it, I'm just
confused.

3819
03:07:30,040 --> 03:07:30,700
Geography is fucking stupid.

3820
03:07:30,820 --> 03:07:32,320
Why do we need to know where things are?

3821
03:07:32,820 --> 03:07:33,140
Exactly.

3822
03:07:33,940 --> 03:07:35,500
Honestly, low-key spin a little bit.

3823
03:07:35,580 --> 03:07:36,780
If I'm not traveling, why do I need to know?

3824
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:37,700
Yeah, exactly.

3825
03:07:38,060 --> 03:07:39,780
Even if I am traveling, I have Google.

3826
03:07:41,220 --> 03:07:41,540
Google?

3827
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:43,020
Yeah, we have Google.

3828
03:07:43,320 --> 03:07:45,100
We literally can just Google where to go.

3829
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:45,840
We have GPS.

3830
03:07:46,060 --> 03:07:47,460
Why the fuck do we need geography?

3831
03:07:48,420 --> 03:07:51,920
To be fair, though, when I was in Japan, I just literally
just Google Translate everything with pictures.

3832
03:07:52,140 --> 03:07:52,820
Yeah, exactly.

3833
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:53,900
Yeah.

3834
03:07:55,680 --> 03:08:03,420
to do with geography but yes exactly what i'm trying to
travel i guess i'm sorry yeah i'm learning japanese so we

3835
03:08:03,420 --> 03:08:11,680
can uh when we go again i i can iGL us in japan when you can
just iGL us in english like what do you well no i gotta be

3836
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:20,720

3837
03:08:20,720 --> 03:08:24,600
we're gonna be like in japan playing apex or something i was
like What do you mean?

3838
03:08:24,740 --> 03:08:26,660
We're still going to be talking in English.

3839
03:08:31,340 --> 03:08:32,520
It's too funny, bro.

3840
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:35,980
I just literally take a picture of everything I need to
know.

3841
03:08:36,260 --> 03:08:36,840
You know what's crazy?

3842
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:42,800
I worked out in Japan, like a park, and there's like yellow
tape, but like not really yellow tape on the thing that says

3843
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:43,220
like caution.

3844
03:08:43,860 --> 03:08:46,200
Did you go to the... Did you ever end up going to the One
Punch Man place?

3845
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:47,220
You mean One Piece?

3846
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:48,360
One Piece Man?

3847
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:48,960
Oh, yeah.

3848
03:08:49,220 --> 03:08:49,920
One Piece Man?

3849
03:08:50,220 --> 03:08:50,340
What?

3850
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:52,140
One Piece Man is crazy.

3851
03:08:52,720 --> 03:08:53,520
Or One Piece, dude.

3852
03:08:54,020 --> 03:09:00,460
won't be shimmed uh what sucks okay next time we go we
definitely have to make that a priority because i want it to

3853
03:09:00,460 --> 03:09:06,600

3856
03:09:22,740 --> 03:09:24,640
no clue hey You had a level 10 hype trade.

3857
03:09:24,820 --> 03:09:25,580
You can send us a...

3858
03:09:26,060 --> 03:09:26,520
No, no, wait, wait.

3859
03:09:26,720 --> 03:09:27,600
No, wait, wait, wait.

3860
03:09:27,720 --> 03:09:30,260
Don't you had a level 10 offline hype trade, okay?

3861
03:09:30,940 --> 03:09:34,260
Let's ask if Apex will sponsor a Roli thing for us.

3862
03:09:34,380 --> 03:09:35,000
It'll be content.

3863
03:09:35,260 --> 03:09:36,540
A Roli thing would be content.

3864
03:09:36,780 --> 03:09:37,860
It would be so content.

3865
03:09:37,880 --> 03:09:42,900
Okay, you know how in Japan, you guys were on like that
platform thing for B-stream?

3866
03:09:43,380 --> 03:09:43,640
Yeah.

3867
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:47,580
Imagine just having Doki just zooming around in the
background and then she falls off the stage.

3868
03:09:49,960 --> 03:09:50,960
She's like drifting.

3869
03:09:51,260 --> 03:10:00,320
Imagine her little avatar has abandoned on the forehead yeah
she's drifting too hard she just eats herself off that was

3870
03:10:00,320 --> 03:10:08,980
so funny okay okay okay yeah they sent it while tempo was on
the roof true bro tempo you and roofs are cursed brother

3871
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:16,940
yeah so you weren't you on the roof when they shot you yes
yeah that's right yeah and also you were yeah we ran up we

3872
03:10:16,940 --> 03:10:22,120
should just get where they were going i should i should have
just charged rifle them off the thing honestly i didn't

3873
03:10:22,120 --> 03:10:27,440
charge rifle them because i thought fly away true then I
should have realized it's three controller players no you're

3874
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:35,140
spitting for real yeah okay okay so like who's gonna ask
apex to sponsor sponsor us for the you you have the most

3875
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:42,800
cool just yeah yeah level 10 hype stream you just got a
level 10 hype train you got a level 10 hype yes but that

3876
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:48,380
doesn't mean anything isn't your hype train even higher now
I'm talking like yes I guess it's unlimited now it's

3877
03:10:48,380 --> 03:10:56,860
uncapped oh no I mean like isn't it like higher for your
stream to hype chain compared to like a normal stream you

3878
03:10:56,860 --> 03:11:03,760
probably made more in that level 10 hype train than i do to
get paid to get to the b stream yeah okay hey at least

3879
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:09,900
you're getting paid i'm just going there for free we could
get like apex to sponsor it which means none of us have to

3880
03:11:09,900 --> 03:11:17,460
pay okay yeah yeah you you go ask ea wait why do i we
literally work because you have the most pull we literally

3881
03:11:17,460 --> 03:11:26,760
works for b stream how do i have the most pulled as content
creators more pull wake is also a content creator i think

3882
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:33,640
it's a host and caster yeah i'm a host i'm a co-host you're
not even a host i'm a co-host yeah so then you can like you

3883
03:11:33,640 --> 03:11:41,420

I'm waiting for them to type the thingy where they're going.

3896
03:12:50,860 --> 03:12:54,520
How did you write that much in such a long, in such a short
amount of time?

3897
03:12:54,660 --> 03:12:56,760
That is like so much knowledge.

3898
03:12:57,560 --> 03:12:58,660
We're so smart, little man.

3899
03:12:59,000 --> 03:12:59,540
I'm so proud of you.

3900

Alrighty, let's fucking lock it in.

Ascade, Zeus.

3903
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:11,720
I am a little high and the delay plus wig typing in chat is
absolutely breaking my brain.

3904
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:15,740
Yo, someone fucking typed tree, and we're on storm point.

3905
03:13:16,320 --> 03:13:17,900
I think they've lost it.

3906
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:22,200
Launch pad, cascades, C note, C note, C note.

3907
03:13:27,260 --> 03:13:31,080
Okay, checkpoint, and storm catcher.

03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:41,820
Oh, no, I have no idea.

3912
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:43,020
Let's get the fuck away from them, bro.

3913
03:13:43,380 --> 03:13:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

3914
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:45,160
I'm not trying to go down with the sinking ship.

3915
03:13:45,180 --> 03:13:46,600
They haven't typed yet.

3916
03:13:47,240 --> 03:13:58,600
okay they just got in all right so we got we got pylon wall
and checkpoint still open or or our favorite poi uh i'm on

3917
03:13:58,600 --> 03:14:09,100
still yeah uh maybe because it doesn't around it's scary
doesn't doesn't uh don't the boys do exactly what legacy

3918
03:14:09,100 --> 03:14:16,080
does all the time i'm not sure why would they do exactly
what they do are you just copying they both ape everything

3919
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:19,560
oh They both also land at the same POIs, I feel like.

3920
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:25,520
Yo, guys, chicken palm or meatball marinara?

3921
03:14:28,560 --> 03:14:32,160
Chicken, brie, cranberry.

3922
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:34,700
Quick, quick, quick.

3923
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:36,440
You're fucking bougie.

3924
03:14:38,040 --> 03:14:39,380
Bougie, motherfucker, man.

3925
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:42,960
And the bread has to...

3926
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:53,300
would take from that guy i like that different one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten that maybe that's a crazy

3927
03:14:53,300 --> 03:14:59,660
thing only 12 pois are claimed i feel like there's just no
way pylon's free i gotta be honest here okay well we still

3928
03:14:59,660 --> 03:15:06,560
have check someone i remember someone typing wall like when
we were in world when we were on world's edge so let's just

3929
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:15,620
pretend wall is gone okay we got checkpoint pylon jurassic
right there's no way somebody takes jurassic is such a place

3930
03:15:21,010 --> 03:15:24,130
No one's typing landing spots anymore.

3931
03:15:26,650 --> 03:15:28,050
No one's about it anymore.

3932
03:15:28,530 --> 03:15:29,310
No one's admitting.

3933
03:15:29,430 --> 03:15:31,150
No one's talking about where to land.

3934
03:15:32,450 --> 03:15:32,870
Yeah, I don't know.

3935
03:15:32,950 --> 03:15:35,390
It makes me nervous, though, because I don't know where the
fuck to go.

3936
03:15:38,890 --> 03:15:41,470
It's because your chicken palm distracted everybody.

3937
03:15:41,510 --> 03:15:42,250
True, true, true.

3938
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:43,690
My fault.

3939
03:15:43,950 --> 03:15:45,970
That's in the hard-hitting questions here, making them
think.

3940
03:15:46,110 --> 03:15:48,190
Yeah, they're thinking they're not actually doing.

3941
03:15:49,490 --> 03:15:49,890
Okay.

3942
03:15:50,350 --> 03:15:51,390
Checkpoint, eye line.

3943
03:15:51,470 --> 03:15:58,150
Jurassic coast and the other coast what do I want to go are
you playing?

3944
03:15:58,830 --> 03:16:05,870
Yeah we're saying coast we're going coast you know coastal
and devastated coast are both still open I mean okay so

3945
03:16:05,870 --> 03:16:12,690
let's just we're starting so let's just go put on and if
someone's there let's go checkpoint okay down I mean that's

3946
03:16:12,690 --> 03:16:20,190
a really hard jump though like we just gotta hope it starts
bottom right and goes top left oh fuck me let's try it I

3947
03:16:20,190 --> 03:16:28,450
mean wait am I still caustic um on stormpoint probably not
no watson i would say okay okay and i would are we swapping

3948
03:16:28,450 --> 03:16:35,150
back like you're on blood and i'm on bang no i think we stay
valk to be honest okay i think valk's gonna be like really

3949
03:16:35,150 --> 03:16:40,510
important for us i think are you cool on blood or no yeah
yeah yeah yeah i was just wondering no you're good i want i

3950
03:16:40,510 --> 03:16:41,330
don't want you to be uncomfortable

3951
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:55,400
all righty 6 45 right yeah yeah the thing is that i think
that barbecue place is like 30 minutes 30 minutes away for

3952
03:16:55,400 --> 03:17:04,660
food wouldn't be downtown la yeah 30 minutes okay you guys
just talking man hungry 25 minutes oh that's tough it's a

3953
03:17:04,660 --> 03:17:11,600
long drive for food all right bottom right top left ready
all right the ship did not the opposite of what you just

3954
03:17:11,600 --> 03:17:16,680
said by the way well that's not bad if we see someone going
left we go right that's not bad at all that's not bad at all

3955
03:17:17,800 --> 03:17:24,140
let's just see this is where we want to go i might just jump
early brown see anybody I gotta turn my audio back up.

3956
03:17:24,300 --> 03:17:25,020
How about your jumping, by the way?

3957
03:17:25,220 --> 03:17:27,040
There's one team potentially going there for sure.

3958
03:17:28,780 --> 03:17:31,160
I think checkpoint might be the more free one.

3959
03:17:31,540 --> 03:17:31,860
Checkpoint.

3960
03:17:32,580 --> 03:17:33,340
Oh yeah, there we go.

3961
03:17:33,420 --> 03:17:33,520
Checkpoint.

3962
03:17:33,800 --> 03:17:34,800
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3963
03:17:34,940 --> 03:17:35,880
Bandage ship, go checkpoint.

3964
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:36,480
All right.

3965
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:37,320
Don't come near.

3966
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:38,980
It's just the archon.

3967
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:40,640
I'm still turning around to watch.

3968
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:42,320
I'm looking at the team chart, right?

3969
03:17:42,340 --> 03:17:44,140
I don't think anyone is going pylon though.

3970
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:45,780
So yeah, we know now.

3971
03:17:45,980 --> 03:17:46,880
I think there is one team, bro.

3972
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:47,500
I'm pretty sure.

3973
03:17:48,060 --> 03:17:49,220
There's one team here too, maybe.

3974
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:50,300
All right.

3975
03:17:50,300 --> 03:17:53,320
What we're going to do is you guys are going to both land on
this building back just in case we're gonna contest it okay

3976
03:17:53,320 --> 03:18:01,160
i'm gonna land middle i'm on that middle there is it there's
someone right above us yeah yeah go over here okay yeah yeah

3977
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:06,740
no we have no choice now sadly oh we are getting contested
all right we can make it work we're good we're good we're

3978
03:18:06,740 --> 03:18:12,740
good we're better we're better 100 i'll just hold angle from
here i think so okay i think we are for sure here's a charge

3979
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:18,660
rifle for a fight that's in front of us we're good we can
just leave get your loot and then go back down below we're

3980
03:18:18,660 --> 03:18:23,320
gonna go down below okay i just don't want to fight this
because I just don't know who's near us or what they're

3981
03:18:23,320 --> 03:18:23,980
gonna do.

3982
03:18:25,060 --> 03:18:26,380
Just don't know who it is to be fair.

3983
03:18:26,940 --> 03:18:28,740
Alright, I'm gonna jump off and we're just gonna keep going
mountain right side.

3984
03:18:28,900 --> 03:18:30,200
We're gonna go walk towards Mill's side, okay?

3985
03:18:30,740 --> 03:18:32,600
Okay, I'm handing over now.

3986
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:34,600
Yeah, I'm gonna start walking down Amelia.

3987
03:18:34,660 --> 03:18:35,260
Just steal their loot.

3988
03:18:35,640 --> 03:18:38,100
We might just... Yeah, I think we go pylon next game.

3989
03:18:38,620 --> 03:18:39,140
I think so too.

3990
03:18:39,200 --> 03:18:39,480
Let's do it.

3991
03:18:39,580 --> 03:18:42,080
It's fine, but also teams might take it now because they
might think it's free.

3992
03:18:43,040 --> 03:18:43,700
Just loot all this.

3993
03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:44,340
I'll go to the next building.

3994
03:18:44,400 --> 03:18:45,840
You guys loot this building, go down below.

3995
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:46,260
We're gonna go.

3996
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:47,980
Alright.

3997
03:18:47,980 --> 03:18:48,420
We're fine.

3998
03:18:48,920 --> 03:18:49,480
We're gonna be fine.

3999
03:18:50,740 --> 03:18:58,880
I picked up scope all right and there's a charge rifle here
too let us see what is free here let us see

4000
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:14,120
are they lowball up there i'm good sir nice they're fighting
over in mills right now by the way there's a skull piercer

4001
03:19:14,120 --> 03:19:23,160
here nice i can't use it sadly but it's good all right i'm
gonna walk down here i think we just i think we need to find

4002
03:19:23,160 --> 03:19:25,640
a beacon We should get this Evo cache, though, on the
rotation now.

4003
03:19:25,760 --> 03:19:25,880
Yep.

4004
03:19:26,260 --> 03:19:26,540
Agreed.

4005
03:19:26,580 --> 03:19:27,140
For sure.

4006
03:19:27,720 --> 03:19:28,700
We do not want to be blues anymore.

4007
03:19:28,760 --> 03:19:29,880
We do not want to be whites anymore, man.

4008
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:31,280
Nice.

4009
03:19:31,660 --> 03:19:32,160
So one team dead.

4010
03:19:32,260 --> 03:19:33,320
That's going to be the mills team that just died.

4011
03:19:34,620 --> 03:19:37,260
So we should be able to rotate and get this Evo cache over
near Cito.

4012
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:40,180
I want to destroy these spiders, but I don't know if we want
to do it right now.

4013
03:19:40,920 --> 03:19:43,900
We really, really need like heals.

4014
03:19:44,300 --> 03:19:46,140
Not an Evo somewhere.

4015
03:19:46,880 --> 03:19:47,400
No, for sure.

4016
03:19:47,600 --> 03:19:48,300
One bat, six cells.

4017
03:19:48,400 --> 03:19:49,640
We're going to hit this Evo cache right now.

4018
03:19:49,860 --> 03:19:52,800
We got to watch out, though, Tempo, because this team is
another need.

4019
03:19:53,580 --> 03:19:59,740
fighting in there yeah yeah i think five's down and we're
good where do we want to go i don't know bro i want to go

4020
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:03,880
towards cito but if this team's still here i don't want to
looted yeah i know but i don't know if they're still here

4021
03:20:03,880 --> 03:20:09,720
you know i mean but this would be a they were pretty early
around the rotation and cito takes a long time to loot just

4022
03:20:09,720 --> 03:20:14,180
play slow here and see because the cito station team should
be really good if they're playing cito should be a good

4023
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:21,400
squad yeah they're on top cito right now let's get us back
up here back up here back up here we're to go back.

4024
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:24,680
We're going to go to we're going to go towards Bean, okay?

4025
03:20:24,860 --> 03:20:25,940
We're just going to walk over here and go towards B.

4026
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:26,720
We're going to path into this road.

4027
03:20:27,700 --> 03:20:30,260
I know it's a really shit route there for us, but I don't
really have another play right now.

4028
03:20:30,420 --> 03:20:31,540
We're kind of getting fucked.

4029
03:20:32,880 --> 03:20:33,720
It's good though.

4030
03:20:33,960 --> 03:20:34,240
We're fine.

4031
03:20:34,860 --> 03:20:35,900
We need another Evo.

4032
03:20:36,900 --> 03:20:37,780
Right now, this blows.

4033
03:20:38,540 --> 03:20:40,940
Or we can, yeah, we don't have a scanning thing either.

4034
03:20:41,080 --> 03:20:41,700
No, we don't.

4035
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:43,500
I'm going to shield cell right now, just in case.

4036
03:20:44,080 --> 03:20:44,400
That's fine.

4037
03:20:45,060 --> 03:20:45,420
Do your thing.

4038
03:20:45,540 --> 03:20:47,060
You're still needing back there, yeah.

4039
03:20:47,640 --> 03:20:54,020
I mean, yeah, I would third party if we didn't have fucking
whites you just loot this up we're good we love this take

4040
03:20:54,020 --> 03:20:58,380
our time and we just have to literally just loot up to make
sure we just c-zone you can also hit that prowler if anyone

4041
03:20:58,380 --> 03:21:01,760
wants the damage for the eva do you get enough evo anymore i
don't remember i think you do right

4042
03:21:06,140 --> 03:21:14,420
we really just need we need like a hundred squads already
guys so many teams are early fighting for no fucking reason

4043
03:21:14,420 --> 03:21:22,160
this is great no one wants to take those there's a 2x on
that i have a 3x Yeah, I'm good too.

4044
03:21:22,260 --> 03:21:24,040
Let's just keep looting up.

4045
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:26,760
Yeah, because teams are landing on each other, so...

4046
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:27,220
Yeah, exactly.

4047
03:21:27,400 --> 03:21:28,140
So we should be good here, man.

4048
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:28,540
Because they're not sure.

4049
03:21:29,500 --> 03:21:31,840
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of teams fighting that don't
know what they're fucked to go to.

4050
03:21:32,140 --> 03:21:35,840
Don't forget, we saw like three POIs free and we got landed
on, so like, that sucks ass, but it's what it is.

4051
03:21:36,740 --> 03:21:38,100
We can go get the care pack here too, maybe.

4052
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:39,380
People were here 10 seconds ago.

4053
03:21:40,060 --> 03:21:40,460
Okay, nice.

4054
03:21:40,460 --> 03:21:41,040
Yeah, they got the care pack.

4055
03:21:41,100 --> 03:21:41,320
You're good.

4056
03:21:41,440 --> 03:21:42,240
They're over here now, too.

4057
03:21:42,600 --> 03:21:45,400
They're rotating back towards CETA, but did the barometer
have a beacon?

4058
03:21:45,460 --> 03:21:46,220
No, it didn't have a beacon either.

4059
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:48,260
So these guys, no one near us really had a beacon at all.

4060
03:21:48,680 --> 03:21:49,560
Then we just wait for the zone to close.

4061
03:21:49,660 --> 03:21:50,980
I think we play big building over here near us.

4062
03:21:51,360 --> 03:21:52,800
And we just wait for the zone to close and go from there.

4063
03:21:53,020 --> 03:21:53,600
Let's play in here.

4064
03:21:54,960 --> 03:21:55,980
Put together a fence up.

4065
03:21:56,060 --> 03:21:56,540
And then we just go.

4066
03:21:56,640 --> 03:21:58,360
It's definitely not going to end near here, but it's fine.

4067
03:22:01,450 --> 03:22:02,590
Just stick together and show presence.

4068
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:03,090
And we're good to go.

4069
03:22:03,530 --> 03:22:04,250
We're going to play this late.

4070
03:22:04,450 --> 03:22:06,630
But we have a valve for this exact reason, to be honest.

4071
03:22:07,050 --> 03:22:08,710
Is there any other evos that we can get?

4072
03:22:08,970 --> 03:22:09,630
Any other evo caches?

4073
03:22:09,910 --> 03:22:10,370
There's no one near.

4074
03:22:10,510 --> 03:22:11,790
No, none of them are near us.

4075
03:22:12,370 --> 03:22:13,050
So ass, bro.

4076
03:22:13,110 --> 03:22:15,970
The team that fucked this checkpoint sucks because we could
have got an evo cache up there too.

4077
03:22:16,190 --> 03:22:16,490
It's all good.

4078
03:22:18,450 --> 03:22:19,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4079
03:22:20,930 --> 03:22:22,730
I'm, well, I'm 12, 3, so.

4080
03:22:23,170 --> 03:22:23,350
Okay.

4081
03:22:23,630 --> 03:22:24,470
Yeah, I'm, I'm 06.

4082
03:22:25,210 --> 03:22:25,910
I've, I've no bats.

4083
03:22:26,050 --> 03:22:26,810
I've sells though.

4084
03:22:26,950 --> 03:22:27,230
All right.

4085
03:22:28,830 --> 03:22:29,270
We're good, baby.

4086
03:22:29,470 --> 03:22:30,230
We're vibing the fuck out.

4087
03:22:30,830 --> 03:22:31,430
Just stay calm.

4088
03:22:31,830 --> 03:22:32,310
We got this.

4089
03:22:32,470 --> 03:22:32,750
I'm so calm.

4090
03:22:33,650 --> 03:22:33,970
I'm so calm.

4091
03:22:34,110 --> 03:22:34,290
We got this.

4092
03:22:34,290 --> 03:22:36,870
I have an evac tower, too.

4093
03:22:37,210 --> 03:22:37,950
I want to jump this guy here.

4094
03:22:37,950 --> 03:22:38,970
I have a quest begin.

4095
03:22:40,530 --> 03:22:41,430
Someone take that back.

4096
03:22:41,550 --> 03:22:42,130
I'll get it.

4097
03:22:42,970 --> 03:22:43,710
Oh, I'm a son of, huh?

4098
03:22:44,730 --> 03:22:45,630
They know we're right on or two.

4099
03:22:45,710 --> 03:22:46,190
They're going to fight this fight.

4100
03:22:46,310 --> 03:22:46,770
Here we go.

4101
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:47,110
They're going to go.

4102
03:22:47,590 --> 03:22:48,150
You're ready for a fight.

4103
03:22:48,170 --> 03:22:48,790
You're ready for a fight here.

4104
03:22:49,230 --> 03:22:49,970
So we have 33.

4105
03:22:50,690 --> 03:22:51,450
Keep scanning when you can.

4106
03:22:51,630 --> 03:22:52,470
We're gonna have to get opening damage here.

4107
03:22:52,870 --> 03:22:52,930
I already scanned once.

4108
03:22:53,450 --> 03:22:53,750
Yeah, you're good.

4109
03:22:54,090 --> 03:22:54,830
I might be down.

4110
03:22:55,330 --> 03:22:55,730
It's the window.

4111
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:56,110
People window.

4112
03:22:56,670 --> 03:22:56,770
Yeah.

4113
03:22:57,470 --> 03:22:57,590
Yep.

4114
03:22:57,590 --> 03:22:57,950
Talk to heal.

4115
03:22:58,210 --> 03:22:58,230
I have to heal.

4116
03:22:58,810 --> 03:22:59,130
You're good.

4117
03:22:59,230 --> 03:22:59,250
Good.

4118
03:22:59,950 --> 03:23:02,570
I mean, no audio.

4119
03:23:02,950 --> 03:23:03,330
Super sick.

4120
03:23:03,770 --> 03:23:03,910
Oh, no.

4121
03:23:03,990 --> 03:23:04,170
Oh, no.

4122
03:23:05,650 --> 03:23:05,790
You leave.

4123
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:08,670
You leave.

4124
03:23:08,890 --> 03:23:09,530
They're literally on my door.

4125
03:23:09,670 --> 03:23:10,430
I'm just running.

4126
03:23:10,950 --> 03:23:11,350
Oh, God.

4127
03:23:13,590 --> 03:23:14,250
We're getting fucking.

4128
03:23:14,250 --> 03:23:14,390
Nope.

4129
03:23:14,530 --> 03:23:15,490
They just fucking scan me.

4130
03:23:17,590 --> 03:23:26,250
i have no idea just keep running tempo they're gonna they're
gonna just land on you just keep going whoa that's them

4131
03:23:26,250 --> 03:23:30,710

4132
03:23:31,110 --> 03:23:45,410
i have no idea oh is that them again is it their horizon it
is them they're right behind us these kids are so cringe bro

4133
03:23:45,410 --> 03:23:49,490
how did they get us again It must have been the mill.

4134
03:23:49,650 --> 03:23:52,550
Wait, is this their first, it's their first fight?

4135
03:23:52,690 --> 03:23:53,290
Yeah, it is their first fight.

4136
03:23:53,690 --> 03:23:55,150
They were probably C note, I guess.

4137
03:23:58,540 --> 03:23:58,940
Right?

4138
03:23:59,160 --> 03:23:59,720
I'm trying, bro.

4139
03:23:59,820 --> 03:24:00,780
I look at the zone too, checkpoint.

4140
03:24:02,900 --> 03:24:03,540
Oh my god.

4141
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:05,000
Oh, I'm so sad.

4142
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:06,340
Maybe we should have just fought the checkpoint team.

4143
03:24:06,820 --> 03:24:07,520
I don't know, bro.

4144
03:24:07,580 --> 03:24:08,860
And that situation is just so tough.

4145
03:24:09,460 --> 03:24:12,700
Like, God damn it.

4146
03:24:12,800 --> 03:24:14,380
We can't think it's them again.

4147
03:24:14,580 --> 03:24:15,720
We died to them again.

4148
03:24:16,400 --> 03:24:18,300
Yeah, it's actually just super unfortunate.

4149
03:24:19,240 --> 03:24:20,400
Are they fighting again?

4150
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:23,460
Oh, no, they're...

4151
03:24:23,460 --> 03:24:24,800
I hope you guys get...

4152
03:24:24,800 --> 03:24:27,160
I hope you guys get day two, you motherfuckers.

4153
03:24:27,940 --> 03:24:28,800
Right, right, right.

4154
03:24:29,020 --> 03:24:29,360
We're still...

4155
03:24:29,360 --> 03:24:29,960
We still have one more game.

4156
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:30,660
We still have one more game.

4157
03:24:30,820 --> 03:24:31,140
It's all good.

4158
03:24:31,240 --> 03:24:31,800
Like, don't forget.

4159
03:24:32,220 --> 03:24:33,420
One game, but we can still get us through.

4160
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:34,340
The next game and we're good.

4161
03:24:34,580 --> 03:24:35,760
Yeah, yeah, we just need one...

4162
03:24:35,760 --> 03:24:37,160
We got one point.

4163
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:38,900
Guys.

4164
03:24:41,140 --> 03:24:43,020
We got that one point, guys.

4165
03:24:43,420 --> 03:24:47,800
I mean, to be honest, as long as this team keeps rolling
every other team and the teams with us don't get any points,

4166
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:48,900
we should still be fine.

4167
03:24:49,240 --> 03:24:50,400
100% bro without a doubt.

4168
03:24:50,600 --> 03:24:51,140
I'll be back one second.

4169
03:24:51,340 --> 03:24:54,040
Yeah, but our third, our last game has to be good.

4170
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:54,880
We need a game.

4171
03:24:54,880 --> 03:24:55,920
Yeah, our last game has to be decent here.

4172
03:24:56,020 --> 03:24:57,680
We need to find a spot.

4173
03:24:58,340 --> 03:24:59,940
We need to find a spot to land too.

4174
03:25:00,760 --> 03:25:02,280
I think pylon should be fine.

4175
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:03,000
Pylon?

4176
03:25:03,300 --> 03:25:03,500
Okay.

4177
03:25:03,820 --> 03:25:04,080
Yeah.

4178
03:25:04,860 --> 03:25:05,740
It was open.

4179
03:25:05,800 --> 03:25:10,300
Like it was open, but we only we veered away because we
thought someone was going to be there.

4180
03:25:11,720 --> 03:25:12,820
Well, we should have went on pylon.

4181
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:14,360
Where is it?

4182
03:25:14,400 --> 03:25:15,960
Where is this team landing?

4183
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:18,080
The team that just killed us?

4184
03:25:18,200 --> 03:25:18,460
Yeah.

4185
03:25:19,300 --> 03:25:20,500
Probably C note.

4186
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:21,360
I would say C note.

4187
03:25:21,880 --> 03:25:23,720
Because we knew someone was fighting Mill.

4188
03:25:23,900 --> 03:25:25,640
And they don't have any kills from before us.

4189
03:25:26,420 --> 03:25:28,760
So it's either C note or barometer that they went.

4190
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:34,340
Yeah, because they're like mirroring us in both maps.

4191
03:25:41,360 --> 03:25:41,860
It's okay.

4192
03:25:41,900 --> 03:25:42,660
We don't make it through.

4193
03:25:42,740 --> 03:25:44,180
We still have next week, guys.

4194
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:48,800
We still have next week, guys.

4195
03:25:49,120 --> 03:25:50,100
Yeah, we got this, guys.

4196
03:25:50,240 --> 03:25:50,700
We got this.

4197
03:25:51,340 --> 03:25:52,740
Wait, is it literally next week?

4198
03:25:52,900 --> 03:26:02,920
the saturday yeah yeah the saturday i'm gonna send y'all
something don't don't look at it though on oh okay okay i'm

4199
03:26:02,920 --> 03:26:03,460
gonna be honest

4200
03:26:07,660 --> 03:26:16,040
that's the only thing i'll read that's yeah don't look at it
okay i'm gonna be honest

4201
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:24,560
That's no fucking thought I did.

4202
03:26:26,020 --> 03:26:28,960
Because I know the first sentence you write is not going to
be anything.

4203
03:26:29,320 --> 03:26:30,280
Yeah, no, of course, of course.

4204
03:26:31,520 --> 03:26:35,400
It definitely wasn't her just reading out, not thinking.

4205
03:26:35,500 --> 03:26:36,520
I'd be like, oh, wait a minute.

4206
03:26:42,740 --> 03:26:44,200
Try guys, try, dude.

4207
03:26:45,080 --> 03:26:46,020
Alright, we can get it.

4208
03:26:46,040 --> 03:26:48,040
We can get 10 points in this next game.

4209
03:26:48,580 --> 03:26:49,360
And then we Gucci.

4210
03:26:50,580 --> 03:26:51,960
But if this team...

4211
03:26:52,900 --> 03:27:02,040
us bro one good game yeah this team or the other other two
teams if this one or redeem or relax just kill everyone

4212
03:27:02,040 --> 03:27:10,420
anyway then we actually stay in our ranking anyway so we're
good yeah we just we just now that they killed us we need

4213
03:27:10,420 --> 03:27:17,980
them to kill everyone else okay i mean they are sort of
killing everybody yeah but then like the thing is they're

4214
03:27:17,980 --> 03:27:25,080
not killing people fast enough so like they have 10 kills so
like the people team below us might just overlap us from

4215
03:27:25,080 --> 03:27:32,320
sheer placements maybe yeah we're getting zero points yeah
we got we got one oh we got one like oh we got we got one

4216
03:27:32,320 --> 03:27:38,900
okay good we got one placement point i mean if we can
actually get pylon for free though we're gonna be i think

4217
03:27:38,900 --> 03:27:45,700
we'll be fine yeah yeah yeah we get pylon this is this is
the checkpoint team that this has got to be the checkpoint

4218
03:27:45,700 --> 03:27:51,900
team that we landed with it's really unfortunate brown that
that checkpoint pulled up here Yeah, I mean to be honest, we

4219
03:27:51,900 --> 03:27:53,060
also didn't say checkpoint.

4220
03:27:54,040 --> 03:27:54,440
Yeah, sure.

4221
03:27:55,100 --> 03:27:55,940
To be fair, you're right.

4222
03:27:57,140 --> 03:28:00,300
Yeah We should just type 2 POI so that everyone gets
confused.

4223
03:28:00,740 --> 03:28:02,280
No one no one no one type checkpoint.

4224
03:28:02,760 --> 03:28:04,580
Yeah No one type checkpoint.

4225
03:28:04,900 --> 03:28:12,340
So that's why we thought we should be okay there too if it
looked like someone was going pylon Yeah So technically it's

4226
03:28:12,340 --> 03:28:13,200
also their fault too.

4227
03:28:13,600 --> 03:28:14,560
Definitely it's also our fault.

4228
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:18,240
Yeah, they should be mad at us to be honest Yeah, they'll be
like what the fuck you type pylon.

4229
03:28:18,500 --> 03:28:18,960
Why are you here?

4230
03:28:21,400 --> 03:28:27,460
there's no one type checkpoint and we had someone was going
pylon yeah we hesitated that was team eight who was team

4231
03:28:27,460 --> 03:28:32,340
eight i think i actually don't know

4232
03:28:41,300 --> 03:28:50,160
okay one sec oh my god i got hit by four headshots yeah did

4234
03:28:59,380 --> 03:28:59,780
terrifying.

4235
03:29:03,700 --> 03:29:04,080
That's okay.

4236
03:29:04,260 --> 03:29:05,520

to us probably every time they could probably beat us 3v3 99
of the time i'm i mean i'm pretty sure they could beat us

4282
03:33:42,950 --> 03:33:51,770
2v3 if they wanted i'm sure maybe even one maybe even one
you know i don't want to be surprised there's this one guy

4283

that's literally trying to 1v3 by himself they're both like
all three of them are trying to 1v3 a fucking team listen

one right now.

What are you going to say?

4356
03:38:34,710 --> 03:38:35,450
I'm not curious.

4357
03:38:35,670 --> 03:38:36,470

4363
03:38:51,730 --> 03:38:52,090
Exclusive.

4364
03:38:52,470 --> 03:38:55,390

I'm trying to be better.

4366
03:38:56,090 --> 03:38:56,430
I'm trying to be better.

4367
03:38:56,530 --> 03:38:57,210
Oh, my God.

4368
03:38:57,270 --> 03:38:58,250
I'm not, though.

4369
03:39:01,270 --> 03:39:03,990
VTuber shit talking you, bro, has got to be top three worst
moments.

4370
03:39:04,210 --> 03:39:04,610

03:39:07,910 --> 03:39:10,130
You know, type it type it after we make it to the next
round.

4374
03:39:10,390 --> 03:39:10,910
Okay, okay, okay.

4375
03:39:13,070 --> 03:39:16,690
Yeah, you save the shit talk for when we're on top.

4376
03:39:16,930 --> 03:39:18,830
If we go out sad as fuck, we don't say anything.

4377
03:39:19,610 --> 03:39:20,310
No one will know.

4378
03:39:20,350 --> 03:39:21,190
Okay, how about this, bro?

4379
03:39:21,310 --> 03:39:24,550
If we lose, we don't make it, we don't make it past to next
round.

4380
03:39:24,850 --> 03:39:30,270
We go, we go like literally all black profile pictures,
everything on Twitter, and we go to our grind mode this

4381
03:39:30,270 --> 03:39:30,510
week.

4382
03:39:31,170 --> 03:39:37,570

basketball when he's about time he goes full black robot

this situation we've got to the same team three games it

4386
03:39:56,270 --> 03:40:04,910

03:40:26,290 --> 03:40:27,930
Roblox is this the Apex?

4390
03:40:29,550 --> 03:40:32,750
I was playing a visual novel.

4391
03:40:33,570 --> 03:40:35,670
And then I was playing Halo.

4392
03:40:36,090 --> 03:40:37,710
I was playing a self-park game.

4393
03:40:37,890 --> 03:40:39,710
I was playing...

4394
03:40:40,250 --> 03:40:42,570
Like, I was playing everything but Apex.

4395
03:40:43,490 --> 03:40:48,030
The only time I played Apex was the Nessie Cup and the JP
tournament I did.

4396
03:40:49,270 --> 03:40:49,890
There's a tournament.

4397
03:40:50,070 --> 03:40:50,710
It's back-to-back.

4398
03:40:51,530 --> 03:40:52,070
That's true.

4399
03:40:52,210 --> 03:40:52,670
That's true.

4400
03:40:53,330 --> 03:40:54,030
Yeah, for real.

4401
03:40:59,520 --> 03:40:59,660
So...

4402
03:40:59,680 --> 03:41:01,640
Start the, where the fuck is...

4403
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:02,480
Start without him.

4404
03:41:02,880 --> 03:41:03,360
Start without...

4405
03:41:05,160 --> 03:41:06,960
Start without that team member.

4406
03:41:11,710 --> 03:41:13,430
No, what the fuck, admin?

4407
03:41:15,170 --> 03:41:16,370
No, what the fuck, admin?

4408
03:41:16,870 --> 03:41:17,390
Tilarious, dude.

4409
03:41:18,730 --> 03:41:19,770
We could have had a chance.

4410
03:41:20,210 --> 03:41:20,850
We could have.

4411
03:41:21,070 --> 03:41:22,630
All right, it would have possibly...

4412
03:41:22,630 --> 03:41:27,170
Okay, this really shows me, though, that, like, if we
genuinely just didn't die to team two every game so far,

4413
03:41:27,490 --> 03:41:28,370
that we could actually...

4414
03:41:28,370 --> 03:41:28,450
We would have made it.

4415
03:41:28,670 --> 03:41:29,610
Yeah, without a doubt.

4416
03:41:30,030 --> 03:41:30,470
100%.

4417
03:41:30,470 --> 03:41:31,790
Because we are literally just...

4418
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:38,630
died to what one point in two games and we're still almost
swamp yeah we're good we're good we got the show let's go we

4419
03:41:38,630 --> 03:41:47,290
got the shit i'm ready i'm ready too i'm ready all righty we
go back again i guess too

4420
03:41:54,610 --> 03:41:57,030
this is it

4421
03:42:01,250 --> 03:42:12,710
this is the game a chat said we're hosting a podcast chat
it's not even a game anymore we're just podcasting who is

4422
03:42:12,710 --> 03:42:21,570
this person i'm banning them from a house chat i was just
threatening everyone bro he's all right are we going pylon

4423
03:42:21,570 --> 03:42:26,670
right pylon yeah we don't have a beacon we don't have a
beacon again wait wait wait but we can rotate into Jurassic

4424
03:42:26,670 --> 03:42:37,050
if no one goes there that's fine that's fine honestly if no
one goes in this direction i might just land Jurassic is

4425
03:42:37,050 --> 03:42:43,630
there anyone checkpoint this time there is yeah this team's
going to checkpoint we should definitely drop soon hopefully

4426
03:42:43,630 --> 03:42:50,070
these teams are not going there they might be bro if they
are we just serve Jurassic that right that right team looks

4427
03:42:50,070 --> 03:42:54,630
like they're going far right yeah they're going to see
though I think this team might be honest here this team

4428
03:42:54,630 --> 03:43:00,850
right beside us on the team above us too and the team to our
left I mean Jurassic's free I don't want to contest I

4429
03:43:00,850 --> 03:43:07,290
definitely don't want to leave I think of Jurassic that we
address the seams coming out of this Yeah, they're landing

4430
03:43:07,290 --> 03:43:07,890
on Pylon.

4431
03:43:08,670 --> 03:43:09,650
There's two teams Pylon.

4432
03:43:09,910 --> 03:43:10,850
What the fuck?

4433
03:43:11,550 --> 03:43:15,130
Do you think that checkpoint team just left and was like,
fuck it?

4434
03:43:15,350 --> 03:43:16,330
No, no, I saw them go in there.

4435
03:43:16,470 --> 03:43:16,610
We're good.

4436
03:43:16,930 --> 03:43:17,630
They're 100% on there.

4437
03:43:17,850 --> 03:43:19,170
It would have been nice, though, because they had double
beacon.

4438
03:43:19,310 --> 03:43:19,650
We went there.

4439
03:43:19,950 --> 03:43:20,170
We're good.

4440
03:43:20,230 --> 03:43:20,630
We got the shit.

4441
03:43:20,750 --> 03:43:20,990
Let's do it.

4442
03:43:22,210 --> 03:43:23,170
I can't scan yet.

4443
03:43:23,570 --> 03:43:23,970
No, you can.

4444
03:43:24,030 --> 03:43:24,250
You're good.

4445
03:43:24,330 --> 03:43:24,430
You're good.

4446
03:43:24,510 --> 03:43:27,150
Yeah, we have ring console, which is literally all we need
for getting these points.

4447
03:43:27,550 --> 03:43:27,870
All we need.

4448
03:43:28,370 --> 03:43:28,890
We'll see what happens.

4449
03:43:31,530 --> 03:43:34,730
Well, a team is definitely going to run at us to get beacon
as well.

4450
03:43:35,930 --> 03:43:39,810
We don't have any like things for scan stuff.

4451
03:43:40,610 --> 03:43:40,850
Oh my god.

4452
03:43:40,950 --> 03:43:41,210
I'll give it a sound.

4453
03:43:41,310 --> 03:43:42,270
That's huge for us.

4454
03:43:42,270 --> 03:43:44,130
Yeah, I'm going to loot inside here.

4455
03:43:44,410 --> 03:43:46,210
It's going to end Cito slash Bean for sure.

4456
03:43:46,250 --> 03:43:47,310
I'm going to loot this.

4457
03:43:47,930 --> 03:43:48,130
All right.

4458
03:43:48,210 --> 03:43:48,550
Sounds good.

4459
03:43:49,390 --> 03:43:51,230
We really need an Evo cache.

4460
03:43:51,490 --> 03:43:51,930
We don't.

4461
03:43:51,950 --> 03:43:52,550
No, we don't.

4462
03:43:52,610 --> 03:43:53,610
Yeah, it's so bad.

4463
03:43:54,430 --> 03:43:54,910
It's all good, baby.

4464
03:43:54,910 --> 03:43:55,150
All good.

4465
03:43:55,290 --> 03:43:55,750
We got this.

4466
03:43:57,210 --> 03:43:57,690
Where is there?

4467
03:43:57,730 --> 03:43:58,650
What's the closest Evo?

4468
03:43:58,830 --> 03:44:00,790
Oh my gosh, there's no nothing that's close.

4469
03:44:01,810 --> 03:44:03,910
We're going to need you to scan like.

4470
03:44:05,990 --> 03:44:11,890
yeah in the boxes then yeah it's gonna be tough when i get
the care package i will but still not gonna get us enough

4471
03:44:11,890 --> 03:44:27,020
okay i mean well it's not awful awful i guess just the white
armor is gonna be tough for no evo fine we could rotate

4472
03:44:27,020 --> 03:44:32,120
through um maybe i maybe i go over i don't want to go there
now though this is a pile on team i just come through i was

4473
03:44:32,120 --> 03:44:37,140
gonna say i probably should have went over to nut and just
got the evo cash over there i could still do it to be honest

4474
03:44:37,140 --> 03:44:43,880
should i risk you think or now for what go over here to this
night cash i feel like you should at this point we don't

4475
03:44:43,880 --> 03:44:50,060
have anything yeah i think i do too because regardless of
what the fuck happens we're just we're gonna die yeah like

4476
03:44:50,060 --> 03:44:57,760
if we don't have yeah wait this guy's routing it they're
routing the evo okay i don't don't this guy was just heck

4477
03:44:57,760 --> 03:45:03,200
what's in the evo what the i'm coming back was that person
that had to be a person that's why graphics were fucked up

4478
03:45:03,200 --> 03:45:10,680
no yeah that thing's not there anymore uh yeah i just can't
buy pylon too uh we should just start rotating this i'm just

4479
03:45:10,680 --> 03:45:16,600
gonna see this dot i don't have an all-break cell for for i
don't excel here i have a note i'll give mine to do you want

4480
03:45:16,600 --> 03:45:21,360
me to hold it or you want to use it now um i think we just
do we save it we're fine i think we're gonna walk in a

4481
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:31,300
little bit more we definitely need an evo i mean we can try
and grab this evo it might be hard but yeah i mean but white

4482
03:45:31,300 --> 03:45:36,740
armor so to the map because the team's just going to into
everything and there's cedar there's cedar station you know

4483
03:45:36,740 --> 03:45:44,380
they're right here too they're moving across right the white
armor is just really rough though yeah well let's just slide

4484
03:45:44,380 --> 03:45:48,920
down just play from here maybe try to get some shots for
first before we rotate an actual center sound because you

4485
03:45:48,920 --> 03:45:53,260
have nothing to fucking do wait all right all right i mean
let me come back up come back to you guys backing up backing

4486
03:45:53,260 --> 03:45:58,580
up the white armor is just so rough man we're gonna get
sandwich here too all right we should actually rotate down

4487
03:45:58,580 --> 03:46:04,040
here i think and try to get that evo okay i think you're
right joki just Yeah, you're good.

4488
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:04,440
You guys are fine.

4489
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:04,960
We should be fine.

4490
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:06,400
We have no choice now.

4491
03:46:07,340 --> 03:46:08,420
Can we grab that one, blue?

4492
03:46:09,480 --> 03:46:10,420
Yeah, we should be fine.

4493
03:46:10,720 --> 03:46:13,300
At least we get blue, which is just, at this point, way
better.

4494
03:46:13,500 --> 03:46:15,460
That's just better for us in the long run.

4495
03:46:16,260 --> 03:46:18,320
Yeah, we're getting fucked over right now, but we're doing
good.

4496
03:46:18,480 --> 03:46:18,680
We're fine.

4497
03:46:19,400 --> 03:46:19,900
That's what it is.

4498
03:46:19,980 --> 03:46:20,440
We don't have a choice.

4499
03:46:20,900 --> 03:46:23,800
Let's get this evo cache, and then I think we just literally
play in this building.

4500
03:46:24,040 --> 03:46:24,780
Oh, I see a trooper shotgun.

4501
03:46:25,880 --> 03:46:26,480
They're right in front of you.

4502
03:46:26,480 --> 03:46:27,020
There's a team there.

4503
03:46:27,160 --> 03:46:27,480
There's a team there.

4504
03:46:27,700 --> 03:46:27,860
It's fine.

4505
03:46:29,040 --> 03:46:29,440
It's okay.

4506
03:46:29,580 --> 03:46:30,080
Let them go.

4507
03:46:30,220 --> 03:46:31,280
Maybe we can get the evo when they rotate out.

4508
03:46:31,280 --> 03:46:32,740
I'm just going to play in this building for right now.

4509
03:46:32,760 --> 03:46:33,500
I'm going in.

4510
03:46:33,520 --> 03:46:34,220
I'm going in.

4511
03:46:34,340 --> 03:46:34,900
Yeah, you're inside.

4512
03:46:35,060 --> 03:46:35,300
You're inside, you're out from here.

4513
03:46:35,420 --> 03:46:35,640
We're good.

4514
03:46:35,900 --> 03:46:36,520
We don't really have a choice.

4515
03:46:39,220 --> 03:46:40,780
This team left the evo cache, though.

4516
03:46:41,080 --> 03:46:41,940
But there's still a team on the left side.

4517
03:46:42,020 --> 03:46:42,920
I don't want to go over there yet.

4518
03:46:43,960 --> 03:46:45,020
Barometer team's going far.

4519
03:46:47,160 --> 03:46:49,000
Flying up and seeing if I can actually see what they're
doing.

4520
03:46:49,840 --> 03:46:50,660
I think of the evo cache.

4521
03:46:50,760 --> 03:46:51,340
You guys stay here, right?

4522
03:46:52,080 --> 03:46:54,360
I'm going to charge rifle barometer.

4523
03:46:54,940 --> 03:46:56,380
Yeah, if I die, then fuck it.

4524
03:46:57,060 --> 03:46:57,620
We can...

4525
03:46:58,280 --> 03:47:04,780
I mean, we have evac and your alt, use either to try and get
a better position no we definitely want to try to get in

4526
03:47:04,780 --> 03:47:11,220
somewhere and get a good spot for zone i got the i got the
evo by the way nice oh that's good good start should we go

4527
03:47:11,220 --> 03:47:16,980
to you or yeah there's a top barometer now yeah there's
showing top barometer i don't know so like here's my dilemma

4528
03:47:16,980 --> 03:47:22,960
guys like i want to go over there but they're gonna run down
everything from everyone yeah like even with blue armors i

4529
03:47:22,960 --> 03:47:28,820
still think they're gonna just fight us regardless yeah
probably purple's which is so fucked what we could do though

4530
03:47:28,820 --> 03:47:34,100
is we could hit an ulti side cedar right there over on the
back side i just don't know if it's going to be safe or not

4531
03:47:34,600 --> 03:47:40,460
i think it's not my fault i think it's better than being
here right if you want to just stay here and see more teams

4532
03:47:40,460 --> 03:47:45,720
dying i think you're saying i think it's gonna be better
over there for sure yeah so i think we just go on roof and

4533
03:47:45,720 --> 03:47:52,240
we hear my balcony okay we're here let's try it why not
right okay we gotta make a play for zone here i think we go

4534
03:47:52,240 --> 03:47:58,420
all right we're gonna try to get to that front spot and what
happens if there is a team in there there's a team in there

4535
03:47:58,420 --> 03:47:58,720
we're dead

4536
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:03,520
Not anyone in here, right?

4537
03:48:03,620 --> 03:48:03,860
No one in here.

4538
03:48:03,960 --> 03:48:04,240
You don't see them.

4539
03:48:04,460 --> 03:48:05,140
I can't see right now.

4540
03:48:05,260 --> 03:48:05,620
Nothing's pinging.

4541
03:48:05,920 --> 03:48:06,380
Doors open.

4542
03:48:06,500 --> 03:48:06,740
Doors open.

4543
03:48:06,900 --> 03:48:07,240
We're good.

4544
03:48:09,160 --> 03:48:10,140
It's the right side of the door.

4545
03:48:10,680 --> 03:48:11,480
Oh, I think.

4546
03:48:11,720 --> 03:48:12,000
We're good.

4547
03:48:12,040 --> 03:48:12,180

03:48:13,620 --> 03:48:13,740
Okay.

4551
03:48:13,880 --> 03:48:15,780
We shouldn't get into it.

4552
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,260
I just want this team to run down everybody.

4553
03:48:17,400 --> 03:48:18,100
That's not us.

4554
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:19,140
Okay.

03:48:19,220 --> 03:48:20,580

Jen?

4557
03:48:21,880 --> 03:48:23,140
Jen would probably be like literally right here.

4558
03:48:23,180 --> 03:48:24,280
It's a res in front of us too.

4559
03:48:25,740 --> 03:48:27,260
Or back here at tempo, to be honest, right here too.

4584
03:49:16,600 --> 03:49:16,820
No.

4585
03:49:17,260 --> 03:49:18,520
We should not ape.

4586
03:49:18,940 --> 03:49:19,940
Where did he get shot?

4587
03:49:19,940 --> 03:49:20,800
That got shot from behind?

4588
03:49:20,940 --> 03:49:21,920

I haven't shot one.

4630
03:52:35,380 --> 03:52:36,620
Only 10 shots.

4631
03:52:36,860 --> 03:52:37,080
Don't worry.

4632
03:52:37,260 --> 03:52:38,580
Here, here, here's a syringe.

4633
03:52:38,740 --> 03:52:39,480
I dropped a syringe.

4634
03:52:42,200 --> 03:52:42,380
Nice.

4635
03:52:42,700 --> 03:52:43,560

Get that med kit.

4642
03:52:54,780 --> 03:52:56,160
Yeah, you do that, baby boy.

4643
03:52:57,540 --> 03:52:58,820
This is a podcast.

4644
03:53:01,280 --> 03:53:01,880
Yeah, it is really.

4645
03:53:03,440 --> 03:53:04,080
Oh, wait.

4646
03:53:04,140 --> 03:53:05,300
I saw someone land somewhere.

4647
03:53:05,440 --> 03:53:06,200
I'm going to go kill them.

4648
03:53:06,700 --> 03:53:07,200
Tell them if you.

4649
03:53:07,260 --> 03:53:09,600
If you get an off tempo, I'm never hanging out with you ever
again.

4650
03:53:10,440 --> 03:53:11,760
Wait, you were hanging out with it.

4651
03:53:12,780 --> 03:53:13,880
Yeah, I can get this kill.

4652
03:53:14,460 --> 03:53:15,480
You hang out with him.

4653
03:53:15,500 --> 03:53:16,000
No, it's not.

4654
03:53:17,300 --> 03:53:18,220
I'm going to pull up and pull.

4655
03:53:18,320 --> 03:53:20,100
Once I actually have my building, a recon play here.

4656
03:53:20,500 --> 03:53:21,860
Temple, are you shooting someone over in the building?

4657
03:53:21,960 --> 03:53:22,240
Oh, they are.

4658
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:24,220
I'm shooting like this way.

4659
03:53:24,980 --> 03:53:27,860
So like, I don't want to leave yet, but I can't lie.

4660
03:53:27,920 --> 03:53:30,380
A really good play would be taking underneath over here late
game.

4661
03:53:31,440 --> 03:53:32,160
Like really late.

4662
03:53:32,980 --> 03:53:34,780
There's also a spot in water we can take late game.

4663
03:53:34,780 --> 03:53:35,540
If you, I want to leave yet though.

4664
03:53:35,560 --> 03:53:37,060
If we go there early, I just don't know what's going to
happen.

4665
03:53:37,260 --> 03:53:38,020
13 squads up.

4666
03:53:38,060 --> 03:53:39,380
We get out angles so hard.

4667
03:53:40,860 --> 03:53:43,420
Sorry, I'm just waiting for your thing to charge me up.

4668
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:44,280
Me too.

4669
03:53:44,780 --> 03:53:45,160
Yeah, you're good.

4670
03:53:45,380 --> 03:53:46,680
I'm not going to use any of my meds.

4671
03:53:46,720 --> 03:53:47,900
I don't want to fight throughout over Jurassic.

4672
03:53:48,060 --> 03:53:50,860
If no one comes from Bean's side to fight us, this is
actually really good.

4673
03:53:51,200 --> 03:53:54,580
If anyone does come from Bean, we just need to get
aggressive on the slide down from the hill.

4674
03:53:54,780 --> 03:53:55,400
That's all we need to do.

4675
03:53:55,600 --> 03:53:57,460
September, please just watch your back when you're sling
like that.

4676
03:53:57,520 --> 03:53:58,620
If you get killed from Bean, we're dead.

4677
03:53:58,760 --> 03:53:59,820
Like, we're just going to get sent on.

4678
03:54:02,160 --> 03:54:02,800
I can't really...

4679
03:54:02,800 --> 03:54:03,540
He'll scan us.

4680
03:54:03,640 --> 03:54:04,100
He'll scan us.

4681
03:54:04,320 --> 03:54:05,120
Okay, that's not good.

4682
03:54:05,300 --> 03:54:06,160
This team scans us.

4683
03:54:06,160 --> 03:54:08,980
He's going to see we're a full three men by our So just
watch out for being right now.

4684
03:54:09,000 --> 03:54:09,440
This is going to be a man.

4685
03:54:09,540 --> 03:54:10,120
That's what I'm looking.

4686
03:54:10,340 --> 03:54:10,620
Yeah.

4687
03:54:10,820 --> 03:54:12,640
That's where we all got to look and we just got to shoot on
the cross down.

4688
03:54:12,760 --> 03:54:14,560
And then we just get aggressive on the, oh, they slide down
at all.

4689
03:54:14,700 --> 03:54:16,080
Out of the door open, now I'm looking.

4690
03:54:17,020 --> 03:54:17,580
They're redeploying.

4691
03:54:18,000 --> 03:54:18,160
They're redeploying.

4692
03:54:18,780 --> 03:54:19,040
Okay.

4693
03:54:19,120 --> 03:54:19,800
They might just land on us.

4694
03:54:19,960 --> 03:54:20,080
Let's see.

4695
03:54:20,380 --> 03:54:21,640
I can shoot a lot of ping-a-ma-jig.

4696
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:22,580
I'm going to try to.

4697
03:54:26,500 --> 03:54:26,840
Oh, wait.

4698
03:54:26,900 --> 03:54:27,220
Where is it?

4699
03:54:28,040 --> 03:54:28,840
They're going that way.

4700
03:54:29,360 --> 03:54:30,240
That's so good for us.

4701
03:54:30,260 --> 03:54:31,060
They're going to go towards that team.

4702
03:54:31,120 --> 03:54:32,920
That was, uh, hitting the scan on us.

4703
03:54:32,980 --> 03:54:33,560
Let's go gigantic.

4704
03:54:35,120 --> 03:54:37,860
How was this team playing top of C though and not getting
shot at at all?

4705
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:41,360
Yeah, just gamers.

4706
03:54:41,620 --> 03:54:42,200
They're just gamers.

4707
03:54:42,480 --> 03:54:43,080
What can they say?

4708
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:44,420
Yeah, I don't know what to say anymore.

4709
03:54:44,860 --> 03:54:46,220
They're just those guys, pal.

4710
03:54:46,340 --> 03:54:46,700
I don't know.

4711
03:54:47,640 --> 03:54:48,540
We don't have a word for him.

4712
03:54:48,760 --> 03:54:50,700
Do I want to throw another gen down here or no?

4713
03:54:51,280 --> 03:54:51,760
Yeah, yeah.

4714
03:54:51,860 --> 03:54:52,000
I would.

4715
03:54:52,140 --> 03:54:53,440
We're going to, you can get it back for the time we need.

4716
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:55,200
And we also have all Dexcel too, right?

4717
03:54:55,320 --> 03:54:55,580
Yeah, yeah.

4718
03:54:56,000 --> 03:54:56,880
Yeah, I have eight percent.

4719
03:54:57,960 --> 03:55:00,120
Oh, they're shooting from the, yeah, they're shooting from
that way.

4720
03:55:00,580 --> 03:55:01,080
They are on Bean.

4721
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:02,760
This team's going to fight us, I think for sure.

4722
03:55:03,720 --> 03:55:05,100
Which we have no more charges.

4723
03:55:05,380 --> 03:55:06,480
Oh, yeah, we don't okay.

4724
03:55:07,100 --> 03:55:12,000
No We do we do and you're just throwing it down now.

4725
03:55:12,200 --> 03:55:16,700
I'm gonna I'm gonna control this door and shoot these guys
on top bean All right Watch your back Timber.

4726
03:55:16,700 --> 03:55:19,340
We did nice.

4727
03:55:19,500 --> 03:55:19,700
Okay.

4728
03:55:19,940 --> 03:55:19,940
Good.

4729
03:55:20,120 --> 03:55:20,120
Good.

4730
03:55:20,260 --> 03:55:20,500
That's huge.

4731
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:24,480
That makes me a little bit more confident that the team the
bean team's not gonna fight What the fuck there she has to

4732
03:55:24,480 --> 03:55:24,860
top here.

4733
03:55:24,900 --> 03:55:27,480
Yeah, that one's really good.

4734
03:55:27,680 --> 03:55:28,460
Everyone's very good.

4735
03:55:28,560 --> 03:55:30,760
Everyone's very good at the game Everyone's very good at
this.

4736
03:55:31,060 --> 03:55:32,960
Yeah, everyone's like right now, man.

4737
03:55:34,340 --> 03:55:37,560
I want these guys to leave with their horizon, so I don't
think they're gonna leave.

4738
03:55:38,580 --> 03:55:39,440
Team 17 dead, right?

4739
03:55:39,540 --> 03:55:40,840
We got one point off placement.

4740
03:55:41,200 --> 03:55:43,100
I mean, we've already originally got one point already.

4741
03:55:45,780 --> 03:55:46,740
I'm like, what do you mean?

4742
03:55:47,080 --> 03:55:48,580
They played the top of the hill still, yeah.

4743
03:55:48,940 --> 03:55:49,380
Yeah, they can.

4744
03:55:49,740 --> 03:55:50,400
Just let me know what they're doing.

4745
03:55:50,520 --> 03:55:51,260
So I'm gonna stare at that.

4746
03:55:51,520 --> 03:55:52,380
I'm staring at them.

4747
03:55:52,640 --> 03:55:53,360
Look at the sound, bro.

4748
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:54,260
The sound's fucking out.

4749
03:55:54,740 --> 03:55:55,380
Where'd we go?

4750
03:55:56,100 --> 03:55:57,540
I mean, there's a water spot we could play.

4751
03:55:57,720 --> 03:55:58,580
There's over here under the waterfall.

4752
03:55:58,740 --> 03:55:59,200
Yeah, we could.

4753
03:56:00,080 --> 03:56:02,140
Yeah, I think we might have to go there late, but I don't
know what these guys are gonna do.

4754
03:56:02,460 --> 03:56:03,540
They're gonna shoot our fucking falcon.

4755
03:56:03,560 --> 03:56:12,320
out well they can't go the other way they have to go to us

have a time to fucking shoot anything.

4759
03:56:34,160 --> 03:56:35,560
These zones have not been great to us at all.

4760
03:56:35,760 --> 03:56:36,400
They've not been kind.

4761
03:56:37,220 --> 03:56:38,400
All right, you're going to need a gen though?

4762
03:56:38,680 --> 03:56:39,760
Oh, they smoke us or what?

4763
03:56:40,080 --> 03:56:40,380
Can you see?

4764
03:56:40,900 --> 03:56:41,680
I'm going to scan a little.

4765
03:56:41,980 --> 03:56:42,500
Yeah, scan a little.

4766
03:56:42,700 --> 03:56:42,720
Nice.

4767
03:56:42,820 --> 03:56:43,360
Yeah, that's fine.

4768
03:56:46,520 --> 03:56:47,780
All right, so we have two options.

4769
03:56:47,940 --> 03:56:48,740
I'm just going to keep a lookout.

4770
03:56:48,840 --> 03:56:50,060
We're going to try to figure out which option is good.

4771
03:56:50,160 --> 03:56:51,320
Just stay on me when I'm flying, okay?

4772
03:56:51,400 --> 03:56:51,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4773
03:56:52,680 --> 03:56:53,520
They're not dropping down.

4774
03:56:53,660 --> 03:56:54,260
They're just...

4775
03:56:54,260 --> 03:56:55,460
They have to go soon, though.

4776
03:56:56,060 --> 03:56:56,800
Yeah, they have to leave.

4777
03:56:57,100 --> 03:57:00,540
No, since we see them pop through Evac, we need to take our
Valco at these because they're They're going to shoot us

4778
03:57:00,540 --> 03:57:00,720
out.

4779
03:57:01,740 --> 03:57:02,800
And once we see those switches.

4780
03:57:02,940 --> 03:57:03,860
There's a sign out.

4781
03:57:03,940 --> 03:57:05,700
I hit one for 80.

4782
03:57:05,900 --> 03:57:06,580
I hit purple 80.

4783
03:57:06,800 --> 03:57:07,480
Can I hit the scan when you can?

4784
03:57:07,580 --> 03:57:09,160
Do the scan when you can?

4785
03:57:09,260 --> 03:57:11,280
Why are they crying out again?

4786
03:57:11,760 --> 03:57:12,020
That's fine.

4787
03:57:12,060 --> 03:57:13,380
Oh my god, I'm getting shot from behind.

4788
03:57:13,720 --> 03:57:14,120
It's fine, it's fine.

4789
03:57:14,280 --> 03:57:14,740
I'm over the door.

4790
03:57:14,980 --> 03:57:15,100
Okay.

4791
03:57:17,120 --> 03:57:17,740
I don't scan.

4792
03:57:17,820 --> 03:57:18,100
I don't scan.

4793
03:57:18,340 --> 03:57:18,400
I don't scan.

4794
03:57:18,680 --> 03:57:18,760
I want to scan.

4795
03:57:18,760 --> 03:57:19,520
One kill one.

4796
03:57:19,620 --> 03:57:20,000
I want to kill one.

4797
03:57:20,040 --> 03:57:22,300
Oh, I got— I'm full kill.

4798
03:57:22,480 --> 03:57:22,760
I full killed.

4799
03:57:23,120 --> 03:57:23,400
On my door.

4800
03:57:23,480 --> 03:57:23,680
On my door.

4801
03:57:23,760 --> 03:57:23,920
I'm a door.

4802
03:57:24,180 --> 03:57:24,900
Why are you killing us?

4803
03:57:24,960 --> 03:57:25,660
You're so bad at the game?

4804
03:57:26,180 --> 03:57:26,380
We're good?

4805
03:57:26,500 --> 03:57:26,740
Medding.

4806
03:57:26,740 --> 03:57:27,380
Play slow.

4807
03:57:27,580 --> 03:57:28,160
We're gonna be dead here though.

4808
03:57:28,260 --> 03:57:28,880
We have to kill these guys.

4809
03:57:29,020 --> 03:57:29,340
We have to kill these guys.

4810
03:57:29,600 --> 03:57:31,040
I'm trying to figure out where they are.

4811
03:57:31,240 --> 03:57:32,140
I'm trying to figure out where they are.

4812
03:57:32,360 --> 03:57:33,600
Okay, okay, okay, I'm here, me, me, me, me.

4813
03:57:33,660 --> 03:57:34,280
Slow, play slow.

4814
03:57:34,520 --> 03:57:35,240
Anybody else going down.

4815
03:57:35,260 --> 03:57:35,520
Play slow.

4816
03:57:35,660 --> 03:57:36,140
Don't eat the Bengali.

4817
03:57:36,820 --> 03:57:37,020
We're good.

4818
03:57:37,100 --> 03:57:37,660
They're nading us now too.

4819
03:57:39,480 --> 03:57:41,020
We have to go.

4820
03:57:41,180 --> 03:57:41,540
We have to go.

4821
03:57:41,680 --> 03:57:41,880
We have to go.

4822
03:57:42,500 --> 03:57:43,280
Go, go, go.

4823
03:57:43,340 --> 03:57:43,960
See me out right side.

4824
03:57:44,420 --> 03:57:44,980
Try to get your kills.

4825
03:57:45,160 --> 03:57:46,240
That's a different, that's a different.

4826
03:57:47,140 --> 03:57:48,060
Oh, it's a whole nother squad.

4827
03:57:48,340 --> 03:57:49,760
That's a whole nother squad.

4828
03:57:50,160 --> 03:57:50,340
What?

4829
03:57:51,120 --> 03:57:51,980
We got eight though.

4830
03:57:54,000 --> 03:57:54,720
We got eight though.

4831
03:57:55,260 --> 03:57:56,180
Wait, do we get any kills?

4832
03:57:56,320 --> 03:57:56,720
We got eight though.

4833
03:57:56,720 --> 03:57:57,440
We got one.

4834
03:57:57,780 --> 03:57:58,380
We got three points.

4835
03:57:58,600 --> 03:57:59,480
Where did these come from?

4836
03:57:59,900 --> 03:58:00,620
This might be possible.

4837
03:58:01,320 --> 03:58:02,100
It might be possible.

4838
03:58:02,260 --> 03:58:02,860
Three points.

4839
03:58:03,140 --> 03:58:05,400
I just cannot believe this team's fighting us, bro, instead
of evacking.

4840
03:58:05,680 --> 03:58:06,160
What are you doing?

4841
03:58:06,420 --> 03:58:07,880
I don't think they had an evack.

4842
03:58:08,020 --> 03:58:09,980
I don't know if the challenges are against.

4843
03:58:10,600 --> 03:58:10,940
Yeah.

4844
03:58:11,200 --> 03:58:11,720
Oh my god.

4845
03:58:11,800 --> 03:58:12,880
My brain hurts a little bit today.

4846
03:58:12,880 --> 03:58:13,240
I can't lie.

4847
03:58:13,400 --> 03:58:13,760
We should.

4848
03:58:14,160 --> 03:58:15,360
We definitely should have left.

4849
03:58:16,380 --> 03:58:17,620
We found their evack.

4850
03:58:17,720 --> 03:58:18,920
I don't think they had an evack.

4851
03:58:19,460 --> 03:58:20,660
I don't even know, but we played that.

4852
03:58:20,680 --> 03:58:24,100
We actually played that correctly, because we just need a
valkalty late there, and we just get sent on by a stupid

4853
03:58:24,100 --> 03:58:24,340
team.

4854
03:58:24,560 --> 03:58:27,960
Yeah, I didn't realize there was a second team behind us.

4855
03:58:28,160 --> 03:58:29,420
I mean, that was the top-side Seedos team.

4856
03:58:29,480 --> 03:58:30,860
There's no reason for them to do that either.

4857
03:58:31,140 --> 03:58:31,680
That makes no sense.

4858
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:32,680
They died for it.

4859
03:58:32,980 --> 03:58:34,000
Yeah, they tied the fight.

4860
03:58:36,260 --> 03:58:39,440
I mean, this just proves my theory that CC is just horrible.

4861
03:58:41,300 --> 03:58:42,760
What do you watch, party?

4862
03:58:43,380 --> 03:58:43,560
Yeah.

4863
03:58:44,320 --> 03:58:47,280
I mean, no, final round of CC's gift, but Jesus Christmas.

4864
03:58:49,260 --> 03:58:52,040
Too many teams out here thinking they're Aurora or fucking
TSM.

4865
03:58:53,880 --> 03:58:55,400
Unfortunately, I mean, what, three points?

4866
03:58:55,580 --> 03:59:00,360
There's a chance, like a small chance there's a chance it
really depends it sucks that team two actually died though

4867
03:59:00,360 --> 03:59:06,760
because we needed them to go crazy and kill off the teams it
was because they died that teams were still alive i mean we

4868
03:59:06,760 --> 03:59:24,420
got eight we have a point yeah we'll figure it out here
we'll see damn if we got that valkalty off i think we could

4869
03:59:24,420 --> 03:59:32,000
have played that spot that i wanted to two it sucks so guys
it's okay that meant that means that we per if we don't make

4870
03:59:32,000 --> 03:59:40,480
it the next round we purposely through so that we could play
more to get there and next week we get round three which is

4871
03:59:40,480 --> 03:59:49,140
not that hard we improved yeah yeah yeah yeah we get to like
yeah it just means that we we we just wanted to spend more

4872
03:59:49,140 --> 03:59:58,140
time together as the besties so we could yeah we just love
each love and i just we just wanted sunday we love each

4873
03:59:58,140 --> 04:00:06,520
other so much wow we also did not want to stream on sunday
so that's why we purposely threw today yep exactly we didn't

4874
04:00:06,520 --> 04:00:14,680
want to stream tomorrow we're so smart guys i think it's not
over yet though i think we still could it's gonna be really

4875
04:00:14,680 --> 04:00:22,260
low i think we have to get to one place not ninth i think
like uh if we didn't get run at twice in a row that time.

4876
04:00:24,680 --> 04:00:31,640
If we just did not get sent on two times, very
coincidentally, by the best team in the lobby, it probably

4877
04:00:31,640 --> 04:00:32,320
went great for us.

4878
04:00:32,660 --> 04:00:35,280
The team we died to is relax.

4879
04:00:35,800 --> 04:00:38,200
So they're in four, so this is good.

4880
04:00:38,460 --> 04:00:40,260
We died to a team that was above us.

4881
04:00:41,020 --> 04:00:41,040
Okay.

4882
04:00:41,860 --> 04:00:43,180
What about the team's alive right now?

4883
04:00:43,260 --> 04:00:43,660
