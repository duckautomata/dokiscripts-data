1
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,860
Everybody!

2
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,400
Okay, this is such a weird setup for my Switch.

3
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:01,620
I had to, I had to, I had to like Uber Eats like a travel adapter because my Switch is not like from NA.

4
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,600
So I had, like I, not, I guess I bought the Switch in Asia.

5
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:14,720
So I realized I didn't have any travel adapters so I had to like Uber Eats a travel adapter from fucking London Drugs.

6
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:23,140
So I could actually charge my Switch and I had to try and find my game capture, my game capture thing.

7
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,080
And then I had to find my, my, my fucking Switch controller because it's Mario Party and there's gonna be a lot of button mashing and everything.

8
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,760
And so, and then, and then okay so like what my setup is like right now is that so I don't really, I have another table.

9
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,860
But like I can't really use that other table.

10
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,700
So like what I have is that I got it.

11
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,860
I got my monitor and like I just placed it in front of all my other monitors.

12
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,480
Like it's, it's on my mouse pad.

13
00:02:50,720 --> 00:03:00,680
Like I have to like, I have to like sit back a little bit because the, the monitor is literally like close to the edge of the table.

14
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,680
And then my phone is covering, you know, one sixth of the monitor.

15
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,400
So it's a really scuffed setup.

16
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,700
It's, it's such a fucking scuff.

17
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Scuffed setup and everything.

18
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,300
And then I found out, I don't know, I didn't know but like I was trying to charge my Switch.

19
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,020
And I didn't realize one of the, the ports, the, the ports, it doesn't work.

20
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,460
It's a new, I don't know if you have to like turn it on or something.

21
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,520
But like one of the fucking ports was like for decoration.

22
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,860
It doesn't charge.

23
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,060
I thought it was because the adapter.

24
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,700
Okay.

25
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm so fucking stupid.

26
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,220
I thought it was because the adapter.

27
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,660
I did have one extra adapter.

28
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,240
So like, I thought that like, oh, maybe my adapter was broken.

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Like, I don't know.

30
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,140
It got burnt or some shit.

31
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,720
So then I was like, okay, I'm going to Uber Eats an adapter.

32
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,420
Sorry, the, what was it called?

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,300
You know, where you plug in appliances, like plug in for power.

34
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,620
Like that shit doesn't work.

35
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,200
So like it was not because my travel adapter.

36
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,160
Wasn't working is because there's no, like, there's no power on there.

37
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,080
Cause like, I was like, okay, let me just plug it in my, this other outlet and then see if it works.

38
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,360
And it, it works.

39
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,840
It, I was like, oh my God, I Uber Eats a travel adapter for no reason.

40
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,440
Like, sorry, I meant outlet.

41
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,140
Yeah.

42
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,320
It was a decorative outlet.

43
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,480
So I was like, I can't believe I fucking Uber Eats a travel adapter for no fucking reason.

44
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,440
So, so I wasted money there.

45
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,660
Anyway, it's fine.

46
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,680
It was like $20, 20 Canadian dollars.

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,620
So that's like one American dollars for you guys.

48
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,800
Um, well dog, thank you for the super chat.

49
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,100
Thank you.

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,620
Thank you.

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Hi Doki.

52
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,140
I'm super excited.

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,960
You're streaming Mario Party on my birthday.

54
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,160
Let the chaos begin.

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,380
Happy birthday to you.

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,940
Happy birthday to you.

57
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,380
Happy birthday, dear dog.

58
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,760
Happy birthday to you.

59
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,100
Yeah.

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,100
Happy birthday.

61
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,580
Anyway.

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,380
Um, let me double check if they're there.

63
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,460
Okay.

64
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,980
Are they there yet?

65
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,180
Or if I'm late?

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,980
I am technically not.

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,680
I mean, LM hasn't even added me on the switch.

68
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,280
I told him to add me, but he hasn't yet.

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,920
Unless like I didn't see the friend request.

70
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,020
No, he hasn't added me yet.

71
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,760
Like, what the fuck?

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay.

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,820
I'm not late.

74
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,020
Cause like, I'm not, cause there's only two people there.

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,400
Um, so technically I'm not late.

76
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,900
Did I give him the wrong friend code?

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Did I fuck up my friend code?

78
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,600
Let me double check.

79
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,960
Um, okay.

80
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,440
Okay.

81
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,220
Uh, oh, I should, I was about to read my friend code out loud.

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:44,960
Okay.

83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,500
Uh, no, I didn't.

84
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,700
Okay.

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,140
It's correct.

86
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,640
Okay.

87
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,140
Nice.

88
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,940
All right.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,100
I guess I'll hop on.

90
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,380
Hello?

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,480
Add me on switch.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,300
Oh my God.

93
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,040
I haven't done that.

94
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,220
Wait.

95
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,620
Yes.

96
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:01,740
Can you?

97
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,500
Yes.

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Do you have like psych?

99
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,820
No.

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,060
Oh, okay.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,960
Let me add you now.

102
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,660
Let me add you now.

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,200
Okay.

104
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,220
Okay.

105
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,020
So by the way, if I sound really monotone today, I've been losing my voice a lot.

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,100
So I'm trying to like, Oh shit.

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,220
Wait.

108
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,080
Were you at Twitchcon?

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,620
No, no, no.

110
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,520
It's like, I've lost it like, like a little bit ago, but I've been never, I've been never, I haven't been letting it recover.

111
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,860
So if, oh yeah.

112
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,840
So you haven't taken a break.

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,380
You've just been like screaming at people.

114
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,180
I see.

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,020
I see.

116
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,540
Yeah.

117
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,920
At about an hour through, I'm probably going to mute for five minutes.

118
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,200
So just basically if I seem weird, there's nothing wrong.

119
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,180
I'm just having to do it.

120
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,480
Yeah.

121
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,740
Yeah.

122
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,480
You're just, yeah.

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
Your throat's just really fucked.

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,200
Yeah.

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,680
I get that.

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,300
Yeah.

127
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,640
Yeah.

128
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,380
Um, okay.

129
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,380
Let me, uh, let me argue.

130
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,560
Okay.

131
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,040
Wait, what's your, I won't do on stream, but like, what's your like thing?

132
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeah.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,480
Yeah.

134
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I sent it to you on Twitter.

135
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,620
Oh, you did.

136
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,020
Yeah.

137
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,300
Yeah.

138
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,460
Yeah.

139
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:46,760
Yeah.

140
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,140
Yeah.

141
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,620
Yeah.

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,120
Yeah.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,320
Yeah.

144
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:49,680
Yeah.

145
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,380
Yeah.

146
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,660
Yeah.

147
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,340
Yeah.

148
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh no, not this year.

149
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,440
No, no.

150
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,820
I was just so busy this year.

151
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,580
Oh, I couldn't go.

152
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,880
Dang it.

153
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,860
Where did you go to the, um, did you go, which ones did you go to the Vegas one?

154
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,140
That's the Evo one, right?

155
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,140
Wait, there was a Twitch con at Vegas?

156
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,280
Yeah, dude.

157
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,060
It was like last year's one.

158
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh no.

159
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,440
I didn't go there.

160
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
I was also very busy.

161
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,340
Oh, she doesn't like the cons.

162
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
She hates them.

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,840
Hates them.

164
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,220
I tell you.

165
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
No, that's not it.

166
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:36,860
No, I didn't go there.

167
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,060
I was actually really busy.

168
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,980
Oh, I was really, really busy.

169
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,260
My schedule was too packed.

170
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,280
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,820
No, I totally touch grass all the time.

172
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,620
Like I'm always outside going to places.

173
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,800
It's just, it was just on the wrong day, you know?

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,300
There was just something I had to do on that day.

175
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,740
Yeah.

176
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,260
Yeah.

177
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,480
Yeah.

178
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,960
I mean, you know what?

179
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,760
And I respect that.

180
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,420
I respect that.

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Yeah.

182
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
I had a thing at that place one time, you know?

183
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh, the thing with the thing with the thing and stuff.

184
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,220
Yeah.

185
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,320
Yeah.

186
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,800
With that thing.

187
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,780
I'm not a shut-in person.

188
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:06,840
Yeah.

189
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm not a shut -in person or anything.

190
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,760
I actually socialize with people.

191
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
I swear to God, I'm not terminally online.

192
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,980
I swear to God.

193
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
And I believe you.

194
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,520
Yeah.

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,220
Dude, I'm going to get this code horribly wrong.

196
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,920
I already know I will.

197
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,260
Hang on.

198
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,460
Let me...

199
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,480
I double checked and I gave you the right code.

200
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,020
And you've been added.

201
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:27,860
Okay.

202
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,240
Nice.

203
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,780
There you go.

204
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,240
And I also have successfully not leaked your code as well.

205
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,620
Nice.

206
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,200
Thank God.

207
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,560
Pleased to know that I have not done that this time.

208
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:34,960
Okay.

209
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,020
There we go.

210
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,840
One, two, three.

211
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,740
Okay.

212
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,020
Let me try this one.

213
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,320
Let me do that.

214
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,660
Then, all I need is...

215
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,440
Wait.

216
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,020
Your name is not Ellum?

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Your first and last name wasn't that?

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,860
Oh, my God.

219
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,240
That's so crazy.

220
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,620
My name is Doki.

221
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,220
You know, my...

222
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,600
So, Ellum, do you think that's my last name?

223
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,660
Oh, my God.

224
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,080
Wait.

225
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,840
Your name is...

226
00:08:59,840 --> 00:08:59,980
Wait.

227
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,760
Is that public knowledge?

228
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,420
Do you know my last name?

229
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,420
Wait, why would I try to dox you?

230
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,300
Like, why?

231
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,800
No, because it's public knowledge.

232
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,940
Oh, it's public knowledge.

233
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,540
Okay, I was gonna be like, why wouldn't I know your last name?

234
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm not gonna, like, sock you.

235
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,940
If I tell you it, you have to promise me you don't laugh.

236
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,620
Okay.

237
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,160
You ready?

238
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,220
Yeah.

239
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,500
It's Bingle.

240
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,660
Wait, is it actually?

241
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,600
What do you mean by, is it actually?

242
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,140
Why don't you just call yourself Bingle then?

243
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,540
That's so much better than that.

244
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,600
That's so much...

245
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,340
Oh my god, why don't you just call yourself Bingle?

246
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,440
Holy fu- Because the Bingle lineage ends with me, Dokie.

247
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,740
The Bingle lineage ends with you.

248
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,180
You can legally get your name changed.

249
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,200
You'd rather just fucking die alone than to change your name.

250
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,280
That's so...

251
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,160
Whoever I get married to, I'm not taking...

252
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,880
Like, they're not taking my name.

253
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,100
They're not taking your name.

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,660
The only...

255
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,860
The only way I would let them take my name is if their last name was Josh, so my name would be Josh Josh.

256
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,620
Josh.

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,360
Josh.

258
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,720
Hey, what's up, guys?

259
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,700
Sykuno.

260
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,580
Hello.

261
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,120
Oh my god.

262
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,020
Did you know his last name was Bingle?

263
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,460
Oh, hey.

264
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,220
Oh my god.

265
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,680
Hey, Dokie.

266
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,280
Sykuno has known...

267
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Has known about my last name.

268
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
He knows the tales of the Bingle.

269
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,360
Oh yeah, we used it as an insult.

270
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,840
No fucking way.

271
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,880
Like, if someone plays really bad, we'll be like, you Bingled it, bro.

272
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,440
Oh, so that's what it meant.

273
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,920
I was like wondering what you guys were saying.

274
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
Like, Bingle.

275
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,540
Yeah, I don't know.

276
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,720
I actually searched what the actual term of Bingle is.

277
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,480
It either means a car crash or an abnormally small penis, so both of which aren't great.

278
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,800
Is it?

279
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,480
I mean, yeah.

280
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,720
I agree with that.

281
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,260
I guess I wouldn't like either of those.

282
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,560
By the way, Syk, if I sound, like, more monotone today, I'm just trying not to raise my voice, because I lost it again yesterday.

283
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:56,940
Oh my god.

284
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,320
So I'm just, like, talking more, like, more, like, monotone.

285
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,740
So if I...

286
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,860
If there's nothing wrong, it's just...

287
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,880
No, that's okay.

288
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,200
That's okay.

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,100
One, two...

290
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,860
Do you have, like, the Discord link for Chilled?

291
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,720
Or I can make it just a separate call.

292
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
I can't believe it.

293
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,280
Wait, so, like, are you an only child?

294
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,300
Can you just give me one second?

295
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,700
Oh, okay.

296
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,400
Um...

297
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,620
No, I've got a brother.

298
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,360
Oh, okay.

299
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
So it doesn't end.

300
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Unless he's also gonna...

301
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,200
No, the thing is, he actually likes our last name, which is the worst thing.

302
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm like, look, you've gotta end it somewhere.

303
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,420
Does he know what it means?

304
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
I don't think so.

305
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,620
I think it's actually even, like, searched, um, what, like, my heritage is, like, in terms of what my, like, ancestors did.

306
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,580
And we were...

307
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,780
We were potato farmers.

308
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,880
You guys were potato...

309
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,200
I mean, like...

310
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,300
Are you part Irish?

311
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,540
Like, are you...

312
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,360
Are you...

313
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Were you part of the potato famine?

314
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,360
Like...

315
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Because of...

316
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,040
Because of...

317
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Oh, wait.

318
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,220
Do I need him on Discord?

319
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,260
Make it...

320
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,440
Make it group chat and I can...

321
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah.

322
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,640
Uh, yeah.

323
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,980
Let me...

324
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,660
I don't really want to group chat with this Andrew.

325
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,460
I don't really want to.

326
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,080
Somebody might...

327
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,060
I also need to go get my Switch from downstairs.

328
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,700
Oh, you're fine.

329
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,280
Oh, wait.

330
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,660
Don't need...

331
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,680
I need to add you on Discord.

332
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,840
I'll just make, like, a separate chat.

333
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,320
Okay.

334
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:04,660
Okay.

335
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,260
Oh, my God.

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,860
Something in my chat was, like, if he's got a bingle, it probably will end.

337
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,320
Bro!

338
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,600
That's his brother!

339
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,900
That's fucked!

340
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,100
Yeah.

341
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,540
It's...

342
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,900
It's cooked.

343
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,720
It's actually cooked.

344
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,280
It's bad.

345
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,040
It's bad.

346
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,940
It's bad.

347
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,420
I mean, if you're, like...

348
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,200
Linga...

349
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,220
Like, you're...

350
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,520
You're...

351
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,600
Your family has survived for generations with bingo.

352
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,340
Yeah.

353
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah.

354
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,820
It ends with me.

355
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,480
It ends with me.

356
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
It just ends with me.

357
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,900
It's done.

358
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,500
It's done.

359
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
You're gonna make sure your brother will find no one.

360
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,880
I'll be like, Oli, look.

361
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,040
That's my brother's name.

362
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,700
I'll be like, Oli, look.

363
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:42,760
Wait.

364
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,560
What's your brother's name?

365
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,820
He's called Oli.

366
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,740
Oh, Oli?

367
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,400
Yeah.

368
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,880
Yeah.

369
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,260
Oli Bingle.

370
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,960
Dude, I mean, like, the Eopana, way better last name.

371
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,840
You should definitely take hers.

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,080
Like, definitely just take hers.

373
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,440
It's fine.

374
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,760
Just, like, you know, you don't need...

375
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,400
You don't need it.

376
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,740
It's fine.

377
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,400
Can't imagine Ella being a farmer, dude.

378
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,120
Neither can I.

379
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,540
Truly.

380
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,960
Oh, my God.

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,960
Not just a farmer, but a potato farmer.

382
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
He's part of the potato famine.

383
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,260
And I'm not proud of it.

384
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,740
Let me tell you that.

385
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,620
You're not proud?

386
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,980
I don't think the Irish are really proud of it either.

387
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
Oh, well, we're gonna switch calls.

388
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,720
We're just gonna do it in this other group, okay?

389
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,200
All right.

390
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,420
Yeah.

391
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,200
No problem.

392
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,460
Wait.

393
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,080
Is this not working?

394
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,040
I sent Sheldon an invite.

395
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:23,700
Okay.

396
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,640
I don't think he...

397
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:24,980
All right.

398
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,840
Well, maybe you should message him and be...

399
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,180
Oh, okay.

400
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,420
Hey.

401
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,520
Hey.

402
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,540
It's like, Kudo said, chill the invite, so maybe we should just go back to...

403
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,040
Yeah, I don't know.

404
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,800
I sent him the invite like he should.

405
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,160
Oh.

406
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,660
Yeah.

407
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,660
So, should we just go back?

408
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,760
We can go back all the way.

409
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,440
We can just use this.

410
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,800
It doesn't matter to me, personally.

411
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,540
Like, it does...

412
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:45,720
Yeah.

413
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah.

414
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Okay.

415
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,400
Hey, gamers.

416
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,960
Hey, what's up, man?

417
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,300
Yo.

418
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,340
Any TCG sim enthusiasts out there?

419
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:53,780
Oh.

420
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,060
Oh.

421
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,220
I'm playing that tomorrow.

422
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,380
Yeah.

423
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,240
I just need Level 25, man.

424
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,100
Is it that addicting?

425
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,220
It's pretty funny.

426
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,320
It's pretty fun.

427
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,180
Yeah, I like it.

428
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,220
So is it like better than Supermarket Simulator or it's just like the same thing?

429
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,840
It's like ten times better.

430
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,620
Wait, how is it...

431
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,620
That game was busted.

432
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,380
How is it ten times better?

433
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,520
Like you can just fully automate it and then just be a goblin opening cards.

434
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,700
Wait, really?

435
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,540
Dude, you just get to rip packs the whole day while your employees are busting their asses?

436
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,020
You're just making money and you just...

437
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,380
Yeah, and then you don't have to pay real money for that too.

438
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,940
Wait, they actually have cards?

439
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,720
They have collectibles in it?

440
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,920
Check this out.

441
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,640
I got a Scarf Goris full art epic foil.

442
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,240
It's worth 2.7k.

443
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,840
Is anyone buying it or you just put it on display?

444
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,140
Dude, I ain't selling it.

445
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm keeping it.

446
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,040
You're putting it in your collection?

447
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,900
How's your collection?

448
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,460
I got a Scarf Goris for 2.7k.

449
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,140
Wait, can you actually spend money for actual packs or is it like only in-game stuff?

450
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,200
No, it's only in-game.

451
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,480
You actually got to play the game, dude.

452
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,180
Oh, shit.

453
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,860
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,640
Yeah.

455
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,280
I think if this was multiplayer, it would have been even better with multiplayer.

456
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,180
I think in fifth grade, the kids would have loved me for this Scarf Goris, I tell you.

457
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,080
They would have thought I was the sickest dude around.

458
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,760
Back in the day, there was this like... I don't know what it was called.

459
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,080
It was this other card game that was on like the PlayStation 2.

460
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,220
And it would like bring the monsters to life like in Yu-Gi-Oh!

461
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,780
And I bought like every pack in this box.

462
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,280
I don't know what it was called.

463
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,480
That's not narrowing it down because they had a lot of them.

464
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,620
I thought it was like one of a kind.

465
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,320
Oh, shit.

466
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,960
I didn't even know that.

467
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,940
It was like Monster Rancher.

468
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,840
Well, Monster Rancher wasn't like a show.

469
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,700
Monster Rancher was like technically not cards.

470
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,760
Not cards, but they made a card game for it.

471
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,160
Oh.

472
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,680
They made a card game for that?

473
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,020
Really?

474
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,040
Yeah, I think they did.

475
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,280
I remember he was my guy.

476
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,240
Is it Eye of Judgment, LM?

477
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,200
That's what some people are saying.

478
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,220
Dude, that was it.

479
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,520
Yeah.

480
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,400
That was it.

481
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,920
That was the name of it.

482
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,120
Yeah.

483
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,640
That was it.

484
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,100
That was the name of it.

485
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,640
Judgment what?

486
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,720
Eye of Judgment, apparently.

487
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,460
Yeah, something like that.

488
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,740
And dude, I remember my mom bought us the entire box and just pissed off everyone in the card shop because just everyone was there for it and we just left for the entire thing.

489
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,620
Damn!

490
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,460
Okay.

491
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,880
Wow.

492
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,680
All right, Mr. Rich Man there.

493
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah, I was gonna say, what kind of mom would just buy the entire pack?

494
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:03,940
You know what I did when I was a kid?

495
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,860
I got fake Pokemon cards.

496
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,720
Yo, me too!

497
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah!

498
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:15,380
You know like when your grandparents or parents were like, here are those Pokemon cards that you wanted so much and they were just like stickers.

499
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,100
And they got it from the Chinese market and it was like fake ones.

500
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,840
Do you remember putting like the two quarters into the machine?

501
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah, the two quarters and those like the stickers in.

502
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,780
The two quarters you pushed and pulled out?

503
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,140
Yeah!

504
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,240
Yeah!

505
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,160
There's like ones in Pizza Hut and you can...

506
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,940
Those are such scams.

507
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
What in the name of American cards is this?

508
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,100
I have no idea what you're talking about.

509
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,720
So there's like, you can actually get fake cards, but they're not actually cards.

510
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,180
They're just really sparkly holographic stickers.

511
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,220
Yeah, they're like stickers.

512
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,140
Oh wait, I think I did have one of those.

513
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,980
Wait, wasn't that...

514
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,260
And I'm pretty sure they should have got sued into oblivion for this.

515
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,680
Wait, Doki actually knows exactly what I'm talking about.

516
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,140
Yeah!

517
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,060
Oh my god.

518
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,780
I had the...

519
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,580
I had a lot of them.

520
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,620
You also had the Yu-Gi-Oh!

521
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,440
versions too.

522
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,260
Yes!

523
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,640
Yeah, they had everything.

524
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:55,980
Yeah.

525
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,840
It was great.

526
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,700
Yeah, but you can tell how...

527
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,920
And then the Yu-Gi-Oh!

528
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,640
cards are like super cheap quality.

529
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,380
Like they're like off, like off-colored and everything.

530
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,520
I have to go get my Switch.

531
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,360
Give me like a...

532
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,420
Wait, you still have it?

533
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm gonna go grab it.

534
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
I'll be back in like two minutes, guys.

535
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,580
I'm gonna go grab my Switch really quick.

536
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:12,760
You're fine.

537
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,220
I'm chilled and Doki.

538
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,780
I've invited you both.

539
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,200
Okay.

540
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,540
Great to see you again, Chilled.

541
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,180
I haven't seen you since we played Among Us five years ago.

542
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,920
Wow!

543
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:30,980
You know, I saw on TwitchCon, I saw as like the last day, you had a line that was just going way to the escalator and I'm like, oh, he's never gonna get out of there.

544
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,900
I had a six and a half hour meet and greet on the last day.

545
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,520
Oh my God!

546
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,180
That's awesome.

547
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,680
Six and a half hours?

548
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,160
It was the opposite of awesome, but like now I'm sick and weakened, but I'm glad to be home.

549
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,940
Glad to be home, you know?

550
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,500
That line was not shrinking because I walked by it twice in my life.

551
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,300
Wait, did they like not cap it at all?

552
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,720
Okay, but it was by the pretzel shop.

553
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,460
And when I finished, they gave me a free pretzel and drink.

554
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,520
Did they really?

555
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,180
Oh, that's kind.

556
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,560
Wait, is it just one pretzel?

557
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah, she ordered it.

558
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,340
What brand were they?

559
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,540
Was it Auntie Anne's?

560
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,460
It was Auntie Anne's, yeah.

561
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,140
I forgot.

562
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,680
Yeah, they were, they're the goats.

563
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,960
They gave me some free food.

564
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,280
Oh, that's sweet.

565
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:04,560
That's nice of them.

566
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,580
I'm gonna go grab my Switch.

567
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,240
I'll be right back.

568
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,400
Wait, what's the passcode?

569
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,980
Oh, LM Stefan.

570
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
I think it's gonna be...

571
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,080
Oh, wait, sorry, sorry.

572
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll leave myself unmuted so you can entertain the chatters.

573
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,380
Oh, okay.

574
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,200
Oh, yeah.

575
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
Free entertainment.

576
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay, do you have any other questions?

577
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,140
Do you play ATCG?

578
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,380
ATCG?

579
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,540
Yeah, do you play like a trading card game?

580
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,460
No, I don't really play it.

581
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,180
I like collected cards as younger, but I never like played the game, like the game itself.

582
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,900
I just thought they looked really cool.

583
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,360
I was just like, ooh.

584
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,400
And I get like a binder of all these cards because I was like, oh, the art's so pretty.

585
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,900
Also, LM, we need a passcode for Mario Party.

586
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,160
Oh, it's 1234, the uncrackable code, you could say.

587
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:45,780
Okay.

588
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,440
Oh, you just showed it.

589
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,300
Yeah.

590
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,200
I haven't showed it.

591
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,500
I sound like really monotone today.

592
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,960
I don't want to explain to everyone, but I'm recovering from a lost voice.

593
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,540
So, I might just sound like really uninterested, but I'm not doing it on purpose.

594
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,400
Thank you for letting me know that you're actually engaged and not uninterested in the conversation.

595
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,300
Thank you for actually being engaged.

596
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,500
I'm usually like very energetic.

597
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,040
I don't want him to be like, wow, this guy is a fucking asshole.

598
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,320
Thanks for inviting me, LM.

599
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,180
Appreciate it.

600
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,360
I really appreciate him.

601
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,140
Don't invite me again.

602
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,840
No, I figured you sound, yeah, it sounds like LM.

603
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,920
You sound like your throat might collapse any second.

604
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,940
I'm just, yeah, it's a whole thing.

605
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,840
I've like been drinking.

606
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,280
I've been steaming my voice prior to arriving here.

607
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,220
I've been had my head over a thing of boiling water, just inhaling steam.

608
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,180
Wait, do you have those?

609
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,060
There's like this throat medicine that you can take.

610
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,660
That's like syrup-ish.

611
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,460
I don't know if you've heard of it.

612
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,760
It's like a Chinese medicine that helps with the throat.

613
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,400
And singers take it a lot.

614
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,720
That would be wonderful.

615
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,260
I'm trying to remember the name.

616
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,600
Chad, do you guys know the name?

617
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,360
Chad?

618
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Also, I might have accidentally leaked the room ID.

619
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
So like, we'll see.

620
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,140
No one plays this game.

621
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,620
We'll be fine.

622
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh, it's a friend lobby.

623
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,720
So that's good.

624
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,160
Okay.

625
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,900
If we go through the trouble of stream sniping at Mario Party, they'd have to turn on their switch, load up the game, then probably do an update, then just arrive.

626
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,480
That's true.

627
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,080
That's true.

628
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,120
Hey, honestly, at that point, they can just play.

629
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,360
Oh, yeah.

630
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,860
So Sakuna's out, Random's in.

631
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,360
I'm going to send you a link to this throat medicine.

632
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,140
It helps a lot.

633
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,660
Cause like singers use it too.

634
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,000
That would be awesome.

635
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,000
Is it called Peepagow?

636
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,960
Uh, yeah.

637
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,340
Peepagow.

638
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,960
I don't know how to pronounce it.

639
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,240
Yeah.

640
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,940
This, this one.

641
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,160
Okay.

642
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,160
This one's real.

643
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,700
It's really good.

644
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,140
Like you can literally like take it like before you head to bed and it like helps.

645
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,260
It's like you recover like almost instantly the next day.

646
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,220
Oh, wait, really?

647
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,740
Yeah.

648
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah.

649
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,700
It's really good.

650
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,140
Yeah.

651
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:49,120
I know a lot of like, uh, like VTubers also use it because like we also talk a lot and like sing and karaoke and concerts.

652
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,540
And stuff.

653
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
So it's like a super common thing that people take.

654
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,080
Oh, okay.

655
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,360
Awesome.

656
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,280
Wait.

657
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,580
So chilled.

658
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,300
You're like a Meyer potty professional, right?

659
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,220
Oh shit.

660
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,240
I mean, how long you've been a content creator chilled?

661
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
Oh God.

662
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,980
I can make you feel old right now.

663
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,580
I can.

664
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,760
So, uh, 2008.

665
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,860
Oh, all right.

666
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,060
2008.

667
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,180
Okay.

668
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,620
Chilled.

669
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,060
I can.

670
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,060
Little big planet.

671
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,320
I was still in high school back then.

672
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,900
Yeah.

673
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,100
Yeah.

674
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,380
2008.

675
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,960
Chilled.

676
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,300
I'll just say, I remember watching your content when I was very young.

677
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,660
Put me in a fucking ground.

678
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,420
Put me in a box.

679
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,340
All the way back when you were in The Creatures.

680
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,600
You watched The Creatures?

681
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,120
I watched The Creatures.

682
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah.

683
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,540
Oh my God.

684
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,780
Okay.

685
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,280
He's an OG.

686
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,420
I used to watch The Creatures.

687
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,760
Me and Junk were the first ones kicked out of The Creatures.

688
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,700
Hey, you know what?

689
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,340
You're better off for it, right?

690
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,620
Yeah.

691
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,100
Look at you.

692
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,480
Look at you now.

693
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,860
You're right.

694
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,240
You're right.

695
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,000
Now you're Chilled Chaos.

696
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,680
The legend.

697
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,600
The legend himself.

698
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,460
Now he's a multi-millionaire legend.

699
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,180
Exactly.

700
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,500
He's popular.

701
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,760
He's successful.

702
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,140
He's exposed him.

703
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,280
Dude, after all of my Yu-Gi-Oh card purchases, that number is going way down.

704
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,860
Dude.

705
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,800
No, you can sell those Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

706
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,860
Do you have a Starlight Rare IP Mascarena?

707
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,460
I heard that card's worth a lot.

708
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,940
No, but I did.

709
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,960
So, it's funny enough.

710
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,880
I did a...

711
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,760
They let me cast a World Championship Series a couple of weeks ago in Seattle.

712
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,140
And that was really fun.

713
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
And while I was there, I got a Starlight SP Little Knight.

714
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,480
So I was like, oh shit.

715
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,660
So that was really cool.

716
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,260
But no, Starlight SP Little Knight, unfortunately.

717
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,180
Not the IP Mascarena.

718
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,060
Now, do you have a PSA 10 Beaver Warrior?

719
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,420
No.

720
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,300
No, I don't.

721
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,560
But I have like a PSA...

722
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,040
Okay, so she's not graded.

723
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
But in my mind, she's like a 7.

724
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,780
A Dark Magician Girl.

725
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,540
First edition from Mirror's Force.

726
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,460
First edition?

727
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,340
Way back in 2005.

728
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,300
First edition.

729
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,180
Oh my god.

730
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,380
Wait, how much does it cost to get them graded?

731
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,680
I don't think too much.

732
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,560
Like maybe like $50 or $70.

733
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,520
Yeah, it's more to say that most people just like get worried because you need to like ship them off.

734
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:03,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,000
It's a waste of money.

736
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,660
Because what if they say it's not that good?

737
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,300
And you gotta crack it out of the box.

738
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,080
And you're like, ah, see, it's new mint.

739
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,160
It's not really graded.

740
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,260
And then you gotta try and sell it.

741
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,720
Did I ever send you my collection of like OG Yu-Gi-Oh?

742
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,260
cards I have?

743
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,840
No, you never showed me them.

744
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,660
Dude, I have...

745
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,480
I need to send them to you.

746
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,760
I have like an entire pack, like box of them.

747
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
They're like pretty...

748
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,240
They're pretty...

749
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
Honestly, they're in good condition.

750
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,480
I don't know if I'd ever get them graded, but like all of the OG stuff.

751
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,560
But one time when I had a puppy, she kind of like got...

752
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,180
She got into the pack and then destroyed like half of them.

753
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,540
And it was like the most heartbreaking thing in my...

754
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,100
I was like, no, not anything but my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

755
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,840
Anything but that.

756
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,820
Oh no.

757
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,440
It's a shame you had to put down the dog after that.

758
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,660
Yeah.

759
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,980
Oh my God.

760
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,300
Oh my God.

761
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,360
I was gonna say, you could sell the dog to make up for the damaged Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

762
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,000
But yeah, it's a little fucked.

763
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,080
That was more fucked than what I was gonna say.

764
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,520
Oh Jesus.

765
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:01,980
Oh Jesus.

766
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,700
White dragon.

767
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,800
I had my tortoise...

768
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,180
Did you send the invite?

769
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,760
I'm on my...

770
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,700
Yeah, yeah.

771
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,740
I invite you, brethren.

772
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,540
I invited you.

773
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,380
Toki, my tortoise peed on some of my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

774
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,620
Your tortoise peed...

775
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,020
How did...

776
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,540
How did your tortoise make it?

777
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:13,920
Yeah.

778
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,080
I was gonna say, how did it get there?

779
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,200
It's a fucking tortoise.

780
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,360
Is it like a house tortoise?

781
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,880
Is it like the same brain sometimes?

782
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,380
He's outside now.

783
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,000
But when he was smaller, you know, he was...

784
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,620
He could stay inside.

785
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,600
He was in a little enclosure.

786
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,320
Can I meet your tortoise and feed him a carrot?

787
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,300
You could.

788
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,160
You could feed him strawberries that looks like murder when they just explode.

789
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,280
Wait.

790
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
Tortoises eat strawberries?

791
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,280
I mean, they're vegetarians.

792
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,140
I love when turtles and tortoises eat because they slowly reach their neck out.

793
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
It's so fun.

794
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,600
Yeah.

795
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,760
You know?

796
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,180
Yes.

797
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,020
It's so fun to watch.

798
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,900
You could just watch him eat.

799
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,240
Wait.

800
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,800
Can you bring him to TwitchCon next time?

801
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,320
Oh, my God.

802
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,540
Yeah.

803
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,800
You should do like a TwitchCon meet and greet and see how many people want to meet your tortoise.

804
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,260
Dude, bring him to TwitchCon.

805
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,820
Charge 50 bucks for meet and greet.

806
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah.

807
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,840
And I would pay it to feed him some strawberries.

808
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,580
Holy shit.

809
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,100
Oh, my God.

810
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,540
It's not even a Twitch meet and greet.

811
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,600
It's a Twitch feed and greet.

812
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,120
Oh, my God.

813
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,580
Oh, dang.

814
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,640
That's the meta.

815
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,120
Yeah.

816
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,320
Yeah.

817
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,900
I would feed a tortoise his name.

818
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,480
Streamers bring their pets.

819
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,120
He's Tortolini.

820
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,200
Tortolini.

821
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,160
That's a good one.

822
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,280
Tortolini.

823
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah.

824
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,900
It's like the Italian noodle.

825
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,700
I'm like, all right.

826
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:13,800
All right.

827
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,500
Tortolini it is.

828
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,000
Tortoise.

829
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,980
He's cool.

830
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,380
If you ever find yourself in Austin, you know, I'll let you know.

831
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:19,840
Wait.

832
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:19,960
Wait.

833
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,040
How old is your tortoise or tortolini?

834
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,660
He's about four and a half.

835
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,880
Four and a half.

836
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,260
Wait.

837
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,000
How big is he?

838
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,120
Wait.

839
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,520
Question mark.

840
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,060
Photo.

841
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,560
I want to see how big he is.

842
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,060
Yeah.

843
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,760
Let me get one.

844
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
He is probably 30 pounds now.

845
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,460
He's going to...

846
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,740
30 pounds.

847
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,340
The great part is he's going to outlive me.

848
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,020
This is a great part.

849
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,260
Pass him on to your kids.

850
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:41,940
Yeah.

851
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,460
He's got...

852
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:42,760
I'm...

853
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,680
He legitimately has...

854
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,840
He has to get willed to somebody.

855
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,340
Can you put me as, like, number 10 on the will if everyone above me doesn't want him?

856
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,720
Why number 10, Sarcuna?

857
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,860
Don't you want to be higher?

858
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,380
I'm not trying to fight for the number one spot.

859
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,440
He's probably got people there, but I figured he doesn't have a number 10 spot yet, you know?

860
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,360
I don't.

861
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,140
Number 10 is not filled.

862
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,860
I have...

863
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,720
Look, I got to be honest.

864
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:04,860
Okay.

865
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,580
If he's living to 100, I think we're all dead by this point, right?

866
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,180
I might live.

867
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,840
I would...

868
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,340
I would...

869
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,140
I would get downloaded into a brain.

870
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,880
That's true.

871
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:13,940
Like, the moon.

872
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,660
Robot.

873
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,280
We don't know where we're going to be in 100 years.

874
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,920
That's so true.

875
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,620
Gokey Bird can't die.

876
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,400
She's an animal character.

877
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,520
Yeah.

878
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,000
That's true.

879
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,660
That's true.

880
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,580
I'm already on the internet.

881
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,560
1, 2, 3, 4.

882
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:22,720
Yeah.

883
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,420
1, 2, 3, 4.

884
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:23,920
1, 2, 3, 4.

885
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,740
All right, Chao, show you the picture of the tortoise, of Tortellini.

886
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,040
Tortellini.

887
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,460
Oh, my God, this is so...

888
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,720
I want to play more Animal Crossing.

889
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,740
I miss Animal Crossing.

890
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,560
It makes me think of Tortimer Island.

891
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,400
God, there was that, like, that little peaceful time and, like, that march.

892
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,520
It's like everyone was just playing Animal Crossing and Doom.

893
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,960
Yeah.

894
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,420
Yeah, and then they never updated the game.

895
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,040
That's my trigger word.

896
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,900
That's my trigger word.

897
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,780
Yeah, I still play it once a week.

898
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,100
Wait, really?

899
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,720
Dude, invite me on the next one.

900
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,160
I'll play.

901
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,260
Would you like to join us?

902
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,340
The mods have gotten insane.

903
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,360
I mean, that's better.

904
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,480
The more confused and upset I get, the better content it is.

905
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,740
Wait, what game?

906
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,040
Among Us.

907
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,520
Oh, Among Us!

908
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,740
Yeah, do they have a new map now?

909
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,500
I play Pico Park, bro.

910
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,040
Oh, one or two?

911
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,920
Both.

912
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,300
Okay, now when you went with the group, did you take Elem in?

913
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,240
Oh.

914
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,380
Yeah, but that group never came back.

915
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,260
Like, me and Elem had a group, and that group ain't coming back, man.

916
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,320
Oh, we'll make it happen.

917
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,100
One day.

918
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,740
One day.

919
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
It's not happening, Elem.

920
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,400
That group's dead.

921
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,800
What's dead?

922
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,580
I'll tell you what, me, I would run it with Elem.

923
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,620
But like, some of them...

924
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,140
Do you play Pico Park?

925
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,780
Oh, the two-player Pico... Wait, you ended a session.

926
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,040
Why did you end a session?

927
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm so sorry, I'm not...

928
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,700
Did you want to play Pico Park with this guy?

929
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,880
You know, that's part of the fun.

930
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,920
You're not wrong.

931
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,640
You're not wrong.

932
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:02,000
You know, I think multiple of them banned him from his chats, and also blocked him on Twitter from our Pico Park and other sessions.

933
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,500
Wait, how far did you guys get on Pico Park with Elem?

934
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,440
I feel like, honestly, we did pretty good.

935
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,540
Considering.

936
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,440
I don't remember, actually.

937
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,440
There's like...

938
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,960
I busted out the whiskey after half an hour.

939
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,920
There's like 14 worlds there.

940
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,360
I couldn't handle it.

941
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,020
Did you at least get to world three?

942
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,560
Did you at least...

943
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,240
We got like halfway, I think.

944
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,940
We honestly did pretty good.

945
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,520
Oh, that's pretty good.

946
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,480
Yeah, but how long?

947
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,500
How long did it take?

948
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,280
Oh, well...

949
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
How many sessions?

950
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,800
I feel like he's saying a lot of things, and I'm going to say low key, I don't remember if it's true or not.

951
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,920
We like...

952
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,320
It's hard to say.

953
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,180
Okay, I'm going to invite you all again.

954
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,180
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

955
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, you guys, same password?

956
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,460
Yeah, yeah.

957
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah, same password, same password.

958
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Wait, I'm waiting.

959
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,460
No, I have to ask though, are you guys all dongle dudes?

960
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,960
What the hell is a dongle dude?

961
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,520
Oh, okay, so do you guys, are you hardwired or are you Wi-Fi?

962
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,100
Oh, no, I have delay, and I will mod every single game.

963
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,760
Oh, okay.

964
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,480
It's so hard to play.

965
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,720
Oh, no, I'm not.

966
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
As long as you all have the delay, it's chilling, you know?

967
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,300
I'm also on Wi-Fi, so...

968
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah, I'm on Wi-Fi as well.

969
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,160
Alright, unplug...

970
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,880
If someone doesn't have the lag, then they're just going to dominate.

971
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,580
Chilled, you got to unplug the dongle right now.

972
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,760
You got to use the Wi-Fi.

973
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,560
I can go on Wi-Fi?

974
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,340
Like, let me tell you.

975
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,280
You got to go Wi-Fi.

976
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,040
It's so bad.

977
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,920
Not just in this game.

978
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,780
In other games, too.

979
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,720
Not going to say which one.

980
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,660
You have 10 plus years of Mario Party experience.

981
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,660
You got to unplug right now.

982
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,400
The delay.

983
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,780
Well, the real question is, do you guys play with the game instructions or no?

984
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,960
This is my third time playing Mario Party in my life.

985
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,380
Yeah.

986
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,180
I've never seen Doki Bird be bad at a game before.

987
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,840
Wait, Doki, is this your first time ever playing?

988
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,340
No, this is my third time.

989
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,020
This is my third time.

990
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,340
This is my third time.

991
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,740
I never owned a GameCube growing up until the GameCube was about to die and had two games on it.

992
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,840
Wait, Doki, how old are you, if you say?

993
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,200
I don't know if you say or not.

994
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,940
He's 108.

995
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,140
Yeah, I'm 108.

996
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,000
I tell people I'm 26.

997
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,860
That's been my lore for seven years now.

998
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,960
I'm going to say I feel like my age didn't change much after 20.

999
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,320
I feel like that happens.

1000
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,200
I feel like that happens.

1001
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,900
I feel mentally I'm the same as I've been since I was 25.

1002
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,300
I feel like it's still the same.

1003
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,400
I feel like ever since COVID, like everything just stopped at that time.

1004
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,140
Nothing progressed after COVID.

1005
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,500
We've just been stuck in our homes.

1006
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,060
When are we getting Walmart for 24 hours again?

1007
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,240
Why can't I go buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards at 3 o'clock in the morning?

1008
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,660
You guys had Walmart for 24 hours during COVID?

1009
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,320
Wait, chill.

1010
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,440
Do you still play Yu-Gi-Oh now?

1011
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,700
Because of COVID, we don't have that anymore.

1012
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,800
Wait, wait.

1013
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,420
You can teach me how to play again, man.

1014
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,280
I've been trying.

1015
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,780
I've been trying to learn.

1016
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,020
Do you still only play the current day meta?

1017
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,440
I used to only play the current day meta.

1018
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,620
Because they were cool.

1019
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,640
Oh, you're in luck then.

1020
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,340
There's a new set coming out in December.

1021
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,280
No, January.

1022
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,000
And they're doing the Evil Heroes.

1023
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
Some retrains of Evil Heroes.

1024
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,180
Okay, but I'm like a cringe master duel only player.

1025
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,760
Oh, yeah.

1026
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,160
I know you play a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh online, Sykkuno.

1027
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,280
I used to.

1028
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,660
Oh, yeah.

1029
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,840
But I've been busy.

1030
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,480
We're going to bring it back though, right, Alan?

1031
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh, yeah.

1032
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,680
Yeah.

1033
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
I mean, Chode, if you want to play.

1034
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,720
Oh, hell yeah.

1035
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,540
We do like OG decks a lot of the time.

1036
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,880
They're just like more fun and...

1037
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,500
Goat netizens?

1038
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:11,840
Yeah.

1039
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,040
I was thinking of Rosalina before I get confused again.

1040
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,580
Oh, wait.

1041
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,100
I'm going to be Birdo.

1042
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,760
No.

1043
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,900
I'm going to be Waluigi.

1044
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,500
Yeah, we just do like...

1045
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
We do like a lot of the OG ones because it's just easier to follow.

1046
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,220
We do goat decks, but like not even goat decks.

1047
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,860
We do like anime decks, dude.

1048
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,200
Yeah.

1049
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,860
Okay, cool.

1050
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,660
I'm summoning out like Giant Soldier of Stone and like Beaver Warrior.

1051
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,520
What?

1052
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,080
What?

1053
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,520
And then I'll be the guy in the Dragon Knight or whatever.

1054
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,760
But the reason I asked you about the Beaver Warrior thing, Chode, is because basically Beaver Warrior for me in sight became a meme.

1055
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,240
He ended up buying me a PSA 10 one.

1056
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,320
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,680
Really?

1058
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,920
I got scammed on that.

1059
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,840
I think I paid double so I could get it in time for when you were visiting.

1060
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,880
But like it was worth it though.

1061
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,840
How much was a PSA 10 Beaver Warrior?

1062
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,720
Well, I don't think it's... it's not worth as much as I paid for it.

1063
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,360
But since I was getting it on like short notice, I paid like more than I... it was like a hundred something.

1064
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,520
Which is like...

1065
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,720
Okay.

1066
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,040
All right.

1067
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,640
It's a Beaver Warrior.

1068
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,300
A lot more than it's worth.

1069
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,020
I got scammed.

1070
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,940
But you know, you got to pay for the speed of it because Elem was coming in from the UK.

1071
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,380
Dude.

1072
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,320
Honestly, I've got a gift.

1073
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:07,840
Pause it out.

1074
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,760
I was like, there's no fucking way.

1075
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,420
Or maybe the price went up.

1076
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,920
PSA 10 Beaver Warrior.

1077
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,040
It has to.

1078
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,960
The longer it goes, the more expensive it gets.

1079
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,020
Wait, dude.

1080
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,600
It went up.

1081
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,420
Yes.

1082
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,520
I mean, I hope so.

1083
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,300
It's cost $200 on eBay now.

1084
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,280
Damn.

1085
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Dude, Elem, your thing went up in price.

1086
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:20,680
Oh, my God.

1087
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,580
Elem, you should put the Beaver Warrior in your will.

1088
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,240
What?

1089
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,180
You need to put the Beaver Warrior in your will.

1090
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,160
$30.

1091
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,220
Yeah.

1092
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,240
Probably like by the time you die, it might be $300.

1093
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,640
Oh, shit.

1094
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,800
But don't sell it, Elem, because that's selling like a part of your friendship.

1095
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,500
You can't do that.

1096
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,240
Yeah.

1097
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,480
Exactly.

1098
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,440
I mean, I guess I just give it back to Syke.

1099
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,760
Wait.

1100
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,320
I recently got a really cool new card.

1101
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:39,740
Let me...

1102
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,900
Dude, I can't even take a picture.

1103
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,940
I'm using my phone for my...

1104
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,040
Wait.

1105
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,660
Did I not press A?

1106
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,580
It was me.

1107
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,220
Is it me?

1108
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,320
No, it was me.

1109
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,660
I think it's Elem now.

1110
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,240
We're ready to go.

1111
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,860
We're ready to go.

1112
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,380
Here we go.

1114
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,760
You said you recently got a new card, though?

1115
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,060
Yeah.

1116
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,440
I got that cool Greninja card.

1117
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,300
It's the coolest Greninja of all time.

1118
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,600
Oh, okay.

1119
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,560
Wait a second.

1120
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,440
Was that the chase card?

1121
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,300
From, like, a set ago?

1122
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,380
It's actually a promo card.

1123
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,180
It's the Ash Greninja?

1124
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,720
Which makes it, like, less cool, but let me look for it.

1125
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,900
Let me look for it.

1126
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,180
Wait.

1127
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,900
How much is it?

1128
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,860
I'll show you the picture of the one I have.

1129
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,320
I think it was, like, just under 200 for the PSA 10.

1130
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,880
Oh, look at that thing.

1131
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,880
Oh, that's cool.

1132
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,400
Dude, this one is the coolest Greninja, like, ever, and I got a PSA 10.

1133
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,140
Dude, I love the full art of Pokémon.

1134
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,020
It's so good.

1135
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:31,960
Same.

1136
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,320
Same.

1137
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:40,040
The problem is, though, like, some of the things that are cool, like, I don't know if they're full art cards, like, if you don't know much about them, you open it, and it looks like it's the coolest thing in the existence of history, and it's, like, a dollar.

1138
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,800
Yeah.

1139
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:41,980
Yeah.

1140
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,760
Dude, that happens to me so often.

1141
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,040
Dude, I got a golden card.

1142
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,600
It was, like, solid gold.

1143
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,620
Yeah!

1144
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,020
And it's called, like, Jubilife City, and I was, like, dude, this thing's solid gold.

1145
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,380
It's gotta be worth, like, tons.

1146
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,160
Oh, I heard about those.

1147
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,960
But they had to be...

1148
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,040
I looked it up.

1149
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,280
Yeah.

1150
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
It was worth two bucks.

1151
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,600
Because they made, like, a shitload of them.

1152
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,840
It was so easy to pull.

1153
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:00,780
Yeah.

1154
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,960
Yeah, it was crazy.

1155
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,740
I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

1156
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,860
Oh, wait, that was, like, the one you could just buy from, like...

1157
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,160
Yeah, you just buy it from, like, a collector's thing, and it just...

1158
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,000
it's just there.

1159
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,080
I mean, it's still a cool card, though.

1160
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,480
I mean, it's, like, it looks dope as fuck.

1161
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,780
Nice.

1162
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,860
Oh, you weren't here for it earlier, but Elm said that he doesn't seem disinterested in us.

1163
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,640
He's just nursing a sore throat.

1164
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,180
Yeah.

1165
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,660
But he promises he's having fun.

1166
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,800
I know.

1167
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,520
He's definitely disinterested.

1168
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,600
I mean, he has to.

1169
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,520
He organized this collab, so...

1170
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,980
Oh, shit.

1171
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,660
Okay, I'm first.

1172
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,640
Oh, fuck.

1173
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, shit.

1174
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:32,900
Oh, shit.

1175
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,160
Let's go, Waluigi!

1176
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,180
Let's fucking go!

1177
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,940
Wait, who's Mario?

1178
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,640
You got...

1179
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:37,940
I take a nine.

1180
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,640
I take a nine.

1181
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,120
Yeah, I got...

1182
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,480
I got ransacked, man.

1183
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,120
Oh, my God.

1184
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,620
Yeah, I got third.

1185
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,340
I mean, going first is such a big advantage to me.

1186
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,120
He is the Mario Party Professionello, so it makes sense.

1187
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,520
It makes sense.

1188
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:47,740
It makes sense.

1189
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:47,920
Is he?

1190
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,280
Dude, chill.

1191
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,240
He's the Mario guy.

1192
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,560
Yeah, that's...

1193
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,140
He literally had a dongle on his Switch for the wired connection.

1194
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,940
That's hardcore.

1195
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,540
He's literally got a dongle.

1196
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,340
Not a penis dongle.

1197
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,900
He's in a dongle.

1198
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,460
He's in a dongle.

1199
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,280
He's literally got the Mario...

1200
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,460
Yeah, who the fuck does that for the Switch?

1201
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,680
He's a dongler.

1202
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Who puts a dongler on the Switch?

1203
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,220
I will tell you, when you're playing Mario Kart and some of those people you're playing against are really good, you need every advantage you can get.

1204
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,520
Every advantage.

1205
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,740
My friend, Tom, he'll come in.

1206
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,480
We'll be doing a Mario Kart session.

1207
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,180
He's not even in the session.

1208
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,800
We'll be racing for, like, two hours.

1209
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,600
He joins one game, dominates us, doesn't say anything, and then just leaves.

1210
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,200
Like, that's the competition that we're having.

1211
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,260
That's what Doki Bird does to us.

1212
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,220
That's what Doki Bird does to me in Street Fighter.

1213
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,220
He's jumping and just kicking ass.

1214
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,140
But you kick jerk!

1215
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,900
Look what happened!

1216
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,140
You won in the end!

1217
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,420
Yeah, until the finals when it lagged.

1218
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,840
And then your luck ran out.

1219
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
I didn't see you play in that.

1220
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,380
How bad was it?

1221
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,500
Like, how bad was your lag?

1222
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,160
It was worse than the first.

1223
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,900
Like, I just couldn't push anything.

1224
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,900
Wait, really?

1225
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,560
It was like a 60 frames lag input.

1226
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,820
It was like almost a full second of lag, so I couldn't even block.

1227
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,740
Like, it was...

1228
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,720
Wait, really?

1229
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,580
It was pretty bad.

1230
00:35:59,660 --> 00:35:59,900
Yeah.

1231
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,620
Oh, dude.

1232
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,020
That sucks.

1233
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,740
This was in Street Fighter?

1234
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:01,980
Yeah.

1235
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,100
And then obviously playing a classic against modern when it's like that bad, I have to do like five inputs for one.

1236
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,600
And with the lag, it's just not...

1237
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah.

1238
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:14,340
And like, he was playing as Blanka, who can just set up a ranged attack from like 200 miles away.

1239
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,080
Yeah.

1240
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,580
And the only way to defend is to jump over it or to parry it.

1241
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,460
And obviously, I can't do it because it's just...

1242
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,580
Humiliate.

1243
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,020
Humiliate.

1244
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,200
Come on!

1245
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,640
It almost feels like the Super Smash Brothers Online on the Switch.

1246
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,160
Like, that has like a built-in one second delay.

1247
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,220
And that's so frustrating because the Smash Brothers is so much fun.

1248
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,380
Oh, yeah.

1249
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,560
Yeah, dude.

1250
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:36,900
It's...

1251
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,660
Playing fighting games, it's just not...

1252
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,500
It's just not it.

1253
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,860
I mean, with delay, like...

1254
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,820
I mean, games in general.

1255
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,560
Like, frame input and stuff, too.

1256
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,320
Because like every...

1257
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,780
Every input matters.

1258
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,680
Dude, I was messing up my heavy punch, heavy kick combo.

1259
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,160
It's just two buttons.

1260
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,420
Yeah.

1261
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,260
When I was watching your game, I was like, why the fuck is he like just backing up?

1262
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,260
I was so confused.

1263
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,240
I was like, why he doesn't want...

1264
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,820
It's because I couldn't do anything.

1265
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,780
He was crazy.

1266
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,280
I was like, well, this is...

1267
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,480
I was like, what's going on?

1268
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,760
Okay.

1269
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,400
So, if you guys are fighting game people, then you understand that Dead or Alive is not a booby game.

1270
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,500
That is an intricate fighting game.

1271
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:10,860
Correct?

1272
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,520
Yes.

1273
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,600
I've never played that game, but...

1274
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Oh, it's so good.

1275
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,800
I've never played it, but like, I watch videos just for research.

1276
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,760
Who's your favorite character in Dead or Alive?

1277
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,680
Ryu Hayabusa and...

1278
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,320
Ryu Hayabusa.

1279
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,680
So, he's really cool.

1280
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,100
That was...

1281
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,240
That was...

1282
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,680
That was instant.

1283
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,600
That was such a fast reply.

1284
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,580
I mean, he looks cool.

1285
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:28,840
Yeah.

1286
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,040
This dude looks kind of cool.

1287
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,180
It's cool.

1288
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,760
And then in DOA 4...

1289
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:31,980
Wait.

1290
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,520
Who's Rosalina?

1291
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,480
Master Chief.

1292
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,060
Master Chief is in Dead or Alive?

1293
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,460
Yeah.

1294
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,020
Dead or Alive 4.

1295
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,580
Master Chief is in...

1296
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,160
Does he wear like...

1297
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,780
Wait.

1298
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
Is he in the beach collection?

1299
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,380
I mean, that's...

1300
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,960
No, no, no.

1301
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,960
He's in full armor.

1302
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,700
He's in full armor.

1303
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:44,760
Aww.

1304
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,820
Then what's the point?

1305
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,720
I don't know, man.

1306
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,180
Like, why can't they put him in the beach collection?

1307
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,780
If Master Chief comes out with double Ds, that'd be hilarious.

1308
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,120
No.

1309
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,240
I just want him in like Thawne.

1310
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Start it up, guys.

1311
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,560
Start it up.

1312
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,500
What's Dead or Alive?

1313
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, it's a fighting...

1314
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,940
It's a really good fighting game.

1315
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,620
A real fighting game.

1316
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,180
Legitimate.

1317
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,080
It's not just a boobie game.

1318
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,580
I've only played Street Fighter and Tekken.

1319
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,640
Oh, Tekken's another fun one.

1320
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,600
Who's Rosalina?

1321
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,620
I love Tekken.

1322
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,020
Guys, we have to work together, guys.

1323
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,980
Guys, we have to...

1324
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,400
It should be simple, guys.

1325
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,280
Oh, no.

1326
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,720
No one ever loses this one.

1327
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,220
Guys, please.

1328
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,720
We got him.

1329
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,080
We got him.

1330
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,480
Dude, the delay is terrible.

1331
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:23,840
What?

1332
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,100
Dude, the delay is terrible.

1333
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,200
You're sitting on my face.

1334
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,060
You're sitting on my face.

1335
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,340
Please.

1336
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,360
Guys, I'm...

1337
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,500
Guys, there's no way we lose.

1338
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,080
No one's ever lost this one.

1339
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,080
I can't move.

1340
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,760
The delay.

1341
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,560
I got it.

1342
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:31,840
You're welcome.

1343
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,420
You're welcome.

1344
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
Oh, my God, dude.

1345
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,600
That was close.

1346
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,200
I almost had it.

1347
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,320
I almost had it.

1348
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,520
That was the longest I've seen someone survive on that mode.

1349
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,620
We're too busy talking about Dead or Alive.

1350
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,080
Oh, my God.

1351
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,500
Master Chief and the Banana Hammock coming out like Borat.

1352
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,560
Oh, my God.

1353
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,780
I need to write out who's who because I don't even know who's who.

1354
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,640
Who?

1355
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:52,960
Who?

1356
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,480
What item did you get?

1357
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,320
Oh, dude, you 100% want to use that item.

1358
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,540
You could buy the star right now.

1359
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,980
Wait, what did I get?

1360
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,680
I looked away.

1361
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,480
You just missed the star.

1362
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,560
I looked away.

1363
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,600
I looked away.

1364
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,020
You're one away from the star now.

1365
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
What if someone steals it?

1366
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,220
There's no way.

1367
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,680
Nobody's going to steal it, right?

1368
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,440
Yeah, no.

1369
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,000
Surely.

1370
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Guys, guys.

1371
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,560
No.

1372
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,500
All of you guys are going to steal it.

1373
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh, that's a great item to steal.

1374
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,620
I tell you.

1375
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,560
Guys, I looked away because I was trying to type out, like, who's who.

1376
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,080
Oh, my God.

1377
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:33,240
Guys, Ellum, if you steal that star from Doki, I'll buy you the extra hot para-o-meter from Nando's.

1378
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,560
Oh, say less.

1379
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,900
Say less.

1380
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,080
Say less.

1381
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,280
Say less.

1382
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,600
I'm doing it.

1383
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,160
I'm doing it.

1384
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,460
I'm doing it.

1385
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,440
Do that star, Doki?

1386
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,180
Ellum, if you don't steal that, I will...

1387
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,160
Oh, you said extra hot.

1388
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm going for it.

1389
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,680
Extra hot from on the para meter.

1390
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,460
So, all I got to do is roll a 10, as we were saying.

1391
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,920
Yeah, 10.

1392
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,260
Oh, shit.

1393
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:48,520
What?

1394
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,250
Holy Jesus.

1395
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,140
Ellum, Ellum, if you don't steal...

1396
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,500
He stole it for real.

1397
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,840
What the...

1398
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,880
Ellum, if you don't steal it, I will...

1399
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,080
I will buy you something better than what Sykkuno was buying you.

1400
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,260
No, Sykkuno's buying the para-o-chicken thingy.

1401
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,900
Doki should have had that.

1402
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,180
She should have had that.

1403
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,220
Doki, I'll let you pitch your...

1404
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,040
She literally had that.

1405
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1406
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,840
Okay, Sykkuno was giving you something that doesn't exist.

1407
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,740
I'll give you something that does exist.

1408
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm getting Nando's.

1409
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,200
Do you think you're going to beat Nando's for a British man?

1410
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,000
He's buying me a Nando's.

1411
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,740
I will buy you...

1412
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,880
Do you want me to give you some Spudman?

1413
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,460
I'll get you some Spudman.

1414
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,500
The potato with beans and cheese.

1415
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,160
How are you going to beat that?

1416
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,480
I'll buy you two.

1417
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,760
I'll buy you two.

1418
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,300
Two chickens at Nando's.

1419
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
I bet you Sykkuno...

1420
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,300
Two chickens?

1421
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,180
Oh, I'll buy you a combo.

1422
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,200
A full-on combo at Nando's.

1423
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,400
In this economy?

1424
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,160
A full combo?

1425
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,080
Yeah, in this economy too.

1426
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,160
Okay, Doki, if you can answer this question, what exactly is in a full combo, do you mind answering?

1427
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,620
A full combo?

1428
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,860
It'll have like...

1429
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,700
It'll have the chicken.

1430
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,560
It'll have the fries.

1431
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,000
It'll have the beverage.

1432
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,020
You can choose whatever beverage you want.

1433
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1434
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:46,680
She called them what?

1435
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,100
She called them what?

1436
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,280
You mean the chips?

1437
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,000
Crips.

1438
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,460
You mean the chips?

1439
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,700
Crips.

1440
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,780
Crips.

1441
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,200
No.

1442
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:52,940
Yeah, yeah.

1443
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,960
Oh my god!

1444
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,440
That's a king.

1445
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah.

1446
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,240
Yeah, get her.

1447
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,180
They're chips.

1448
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,540
They're chips.

1449
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,800
She called them fries.

1450
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,040
And they're perry soda chips while you're at it, actually.

1451
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,680
I got a question for you, Elem.

1452
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,660
Dude, I can't believe Doki actually didn't get that star.

1453
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,900
I can't believe you got ten!

1454
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,340
Dude, that's just evil that Elem stole that from you.

1455
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,820
That's crazy.

1456
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,220
I can't believe you got ten!

1457
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,620
I'll do it again.

1458
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,220
I'll do it again.

1459
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,080
I can't believe you got ten!

1460
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,300
That's insane.

1461
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,400
That's insane.

1462
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,100
And it also doesn't stop there.

1463
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,960
You literally had a mushroom.

1464
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,180
You literally had a mushroom.

1465
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,260
I'm going to steal your money as well.

1466
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,900
Thank you so much, Doki.

1467
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,220
You're going to steal my money?

1468
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,880
What did I do to you?

1469
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,480
I literally just insisted.

1470
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,500
I'm going to offer you things!

1471
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,560
I really appreciate the free money, Doki.

1472
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,060
Thank you so much.

1473
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1474
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,360
Wait, did you actually steal?

1475
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:37,820
What makes you think you're going to win?

1476
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,940
What makes you think you're going to win?

1477
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,760
No, you didn't.

1478
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,400
Oh, because guys, I'm the Mario guy.

1479
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
You're the Mario guy?

1480
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,940
I don't see no mustaches, shall I?

1481
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,200
There's ten.

1482
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,800
Oh, I've grown facial hair now, shall we?

1483
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,240
Did he just roll the dice?

1484
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,900
Each of us!

1485
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,260
He robbed each of us!

1486
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,620
You guys didn't even pay in full.

1487
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,540
Look at this.

1488
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,660
It's probably being pulled.

1489
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,580
I put in 100% of my money proportionally.

1490
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,060
We call this London style, guys.

1491
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,780
London style robbery is what we call it.

1492
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,140
That means he's going to stab us.

1493
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,260
Yeah, he's going to stab us.

1494
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,140
He's going to throw acid on our face.

1495
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,820
I can't even do the voice.

1496
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,600
I can't raise my voice.

1497
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,140
Dude, this one's cooked.

1498
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,160
I hate this dude.

1499
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,360
Oh, dude.

1500
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,480
How do you die?

1501
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,160
How do I not get sucked?

1502
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:13,700
Yeah.

1503
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,900
Well...

1504
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,980
How do I die?

1505
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,740
How do I die?

1506
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,780
I need you to die, Rose.

1507
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,440
I need you to die.

1508
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,440
Wait and down.

1509
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,740
Oh, like that.

1510
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,280
Okay.

1511
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,880
You're gaming.

1512
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,380
You're gaming.

1513
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,260
Oh, I'm doing it.

1514
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,840
All right.

1515
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,260
My turn.

1516
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,880
Oh, okay.

1517
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,400
All right.

1518
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,200
Now I'm ready up.

1519
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,220
Yeah, it's easy.

1520
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,640
Dude, this is...

1521
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,620
Yeah, this one's easy.

1522
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,120
Okay, I'm locking it.

1523
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,100
Guys, this is going to be a generational run.

1524
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,360
If I lose this, I'm going to buy a chilled Yu-Gi-Oh box next time I see him.

1525
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,220
Oh my God.

1526
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,260
I don't know what if I win.

1527
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:47,300
I don't know what if I win.

1528
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,060
I'm just not even harder, but I have a messed-up Labrum.

1529
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,880
What the hell is a Labrum?

1530
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,780
Oh my God, you're laggling.

1531
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,680
The Labrum is in your shoulder.

1532
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,520
I'm dead.

1533
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,620
It's laggling.

1534
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,460
At last.

1535
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,840
He's not going to take our ten dollars.

1536
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm mashing so hard, but I'm so slow.

1537
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,040
The delay, guys.

1538
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,220
The delay, guys.

1539
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:00,540
I beat you.

1540
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,720
My Labrum.

1541
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,920
The delay.

1542
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,460
I'm mashing really hard, too.

1543
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,340
Yes!

1544
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,860
Dude, okay.

1545
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,780
Like, but I finished.

1546
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,860
Does that count as a win?

1547
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:08,660
You...

1548
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,160
Yes.

1549
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,360
Thank you.

1550
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:10,940
You're very nice.

1551
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,380
But like I finished, though.

1552
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,860
Thanks, LM, for all that money.

1553
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,260
Hey, Ndoki, I did that for you.

1554
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,920
Yeah, yeah, after stealing the star right in front of me, yeah!

1555
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,240
I did that for you.

1556
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,400
So a labrum is in your shoulder, and I tore mine by doing burpees.

1557
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,820
What the fuck is burpees?

1558
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,300
So burpees are when you jump up and you jump on the ground to a push-up, push yourself back up, jump.

1559
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,480
The funny thing is, I always call it a labia, that I tore my labia, and it always comes out.

1560
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,660
Oh yeah, I thought it was a labia.

1561
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,340
Wait, isn't it a labia for me?

1562
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,860
No, no, I did not tear my labia.

1563
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,080
I feel like you don't want to say that.

1564
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,960
Wait, what's a labia?

1565
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,220
I don't know if you want to say that.

1566
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,160
LM, do you have a labia?

1567
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,100
I don't know, do I?

1568
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,900
What's a labia?

1569
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,260
Yes or no, do you?

1570
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,680
You think you have one.

1571
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,340
You think you have one.

1572
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,180
You tore your labia.

1573
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,500
Yep, so do you have one?

1574
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,280
I do.

1575
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:05,620
I guess so.

1576
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,980
Guys, wait, what is a labia?

1577
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,920
Man, I thought American school was bad.

1578
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,360
No, that's just LM, Chill, that's just LM.

1579
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,180
Oh, it's the vagina.

1580
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,420
That's quite embarrassing, but it's okay, it happens to the best of us.

1581
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,180
Anyway, yeah, I fucked mine up doing burpees.

1582
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,880
Did you do your A levels?

1583
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,760
Did you?

1584
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,980
I did, but we just didn't do much on that part of the A.

1585
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,780
The female anatomy, yeah.

1586
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,200
Yeah, no, that's understandable.

1587
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,700
I don't think it should be in the A levels, but like...

1588
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:55,080
Dude, there's like certain things which I have learned over the last year, which people assume I know.

1589
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,160
So you know in school you learn what vowels are?

1590
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,200
Yeah, yeah, you didn't know what vowels are.

1591
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,900
I didn't know what vowels were, right?

1592
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,560
Because everyone assumes at that point you just know it.

1593
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,360
So then I was like...

1594
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:04,940
What are the vowels, man?

1595
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,880
What are the vowels?

1596
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,020
Yeah, what are vowels?

1597
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,000
I know them now, because A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y is what I've been told.

1598
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,400
But I cannot tell you what in the fuck a prime number is.

1599
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,120
God damn it, no idea.

1600
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,620
There's no way he doesn't know.

1601
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,420
Dude, no idea what a prime number is, and I still can't tell you what it is.

1602
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,340
He's a multi-millionaire streamer, doesn't know what a prime number is.

1603
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,920
So you tell him someone held a gun to your head, and he said, What's a prime number, LM?

1604
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,360
You die.

1605
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,380
Then I accept death.

1606
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,900
Why would you do this to him?

1607
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,120
Augh, bro!

1608
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,800
He just walked off!

1609
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,400
Okay.

1610
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,560
None of this makes any sense.

1611
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,540
I take that.

1612
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,140
I needed that win.

1613
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,140
God damn.

1614
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,820
Prime numbers are numbers that can't be broken into whole numbers.

1615
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,900
So what the hell does that mean?

1616
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,160
Wait, what did you get on math, LM?

1617
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,200
On your As, on your A levels?

1618
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,040
Well, I didn't do it for A levels.

1619
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,500
I did it for, we did like GCSUs and then A levels.

1620
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,500
Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

1621
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,260
Name one prime number, now that you know what it is.

1622
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,160
You got this.

1623
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,160
Two.

1624
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:07,840
Oh my gosh.

1625
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,820
Yeah.

1626
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,220
Wait, why are we laughing?

1627
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,660
Isn't that...

1628
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,360
Wait, two is a prime number, I think.

1629
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,260
I like how you're like, I think.

1630
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,880
Is it not?

1631
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,780
No, it's not a prime number.

1632
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,760
Wait, two isn't a prime number?

1633
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,620
Ain't no way, bro.

1634
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,980
I have a degree in mathematics.

1635
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,120
Wait, you have a degree in mathematics?

1636
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,040
Yeah, I have a master's degree in statistics.

1637
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,420
Wait, you have a master's degree?

1638
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:32,560
Master's degree?

1639
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,920
Yeah, I used to have a regular job before I was streaming.

1640
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,400
Oh my gosh.

1641
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,820
Me too, I used to work at a comic book store.

1642
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,460
And they would pay me off the books when I was 14.

1643
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,860
Which I think is highly unethical and illegal.

1644
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,280
I don't think the comic book store is there anymore.

1645
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,480
But if you can, you could call the IRS on it.

1646
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,680
They wouldn't even pay me cash.

1647
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,900
They would pay me in Yu-Gi-Oh!

1648
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,360
packs.

1649
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,380
Dude, that's better.

1650
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,180
Yeah, that's better though.

1651
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,840
I swear to God, that's exactly what I got paid for.

1652
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,400
Dude, that's better.

1653
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,240
I used to work at a horse store and it was fucking terrible.

1654
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:05,500
You get a BLS Envoy of the End?

1655
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,800
That's money back then.

1656
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:07,900
No, you have to...

1657
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,100
How do you know that?

1658
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,260
Because I literally pulled...

1659
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,240
So I'm not even joking.

1660
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,260
So there was one night we were doing...

1661
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,040
I'm cleaning up, so my job was to host Yu-Gi-Oh!

1662
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,020
card tournaments and clean up the shop on Fridays.

1663
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,380
And I got paid four Yu-Gi-Oh!

1664
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:18,600
packs.

1665
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,780
And one of those nights, I pulled a BLS Envoy of the Beginning and a Chaos Emperor Dragon Envoy of the End.

1666
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,140
In my four packs.

1667
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:25,700
Oh shit!

1668
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,440
Yelling.

1669
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,280
It was incredible.

1670
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,140
I still have those cards.

1671
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,620
Oh my God, this was before, like...

1672
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,140
Why didn't you sell it?

1673
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:31,540
You would have been rich.

1674
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,320
Yeah, you could have sold it.

1675
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,280
You should have sold it.

1676
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,800
They turned it into a promo card after that and it was worthless.

1677
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,140
Oh, is that what happened?

1678
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,980
Wait, so does that mean...

1679
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,080
Yeah, they made a promo version of BLS, which made it worth, like, a lot less after that.

1680
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,960
They do a lot of reprinting and it hurts.

1681
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,580
Does the original lose value after it gets reprinted or not?

1682
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,360
So, I wouldn't say the original loses all of its value.

1683
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,140
It loses a good amount of value, but people want cards that are from, like, certain sets.

1684
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,340
So if it's, like, an old card that gets reprinted, it'll probably still retain its value.

1685
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,520
But if it's a newer card that gets reprinted...

1686
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,980
it is not going to retain its value at all.

1687
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,980
It's just going to die.

1688
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,580
Oh, that sucks.

1689
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,960
Yeah, it does kind of suck.

1690
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,760
So there's no point in buying meta cards if, like, you're trying to collect them.

1691
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,920
At least while they're new.

1692
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,460
Because they will just drop from $100 down to $10 over the course of a year.

1693
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,640
It just happens every single time.

1694
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,420
Fuck that.

1695
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,440
Coney Island.

1696
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,540
Coney Island.

1697
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:21,840
Coney Island.

1698
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,180
Let's go.

1699
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,340
We gotta catch the ice cream.

1700
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,700
Oh, we gotta catch the ice cream.

1701
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,200
With the lag, this is gonna be good.

1702
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,740
With the delay, this is actually impossible.

1703
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,300
I can't do this.

1704
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,060
This is just...

1705
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,180
Like, there's...

1706
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,300
Dude, I can't even...

1707
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,980
We should have been dongled, guys.

1708
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,240
We should have been dongled.

1709
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,100
The lag is really bad on this one.

1710
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,980
I was the only person who didn't get a single scoop then.

1711
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,620
That's insane.

1712
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,460
Come on, give me a scoop.

1713
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:43,880
Give me a scoop.

1714
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,420
Move.

1715
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,320
Get out of the way.

1716
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,400
Thank you, guys.

1717
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,640
Hey, you guys have been crushed.

1718
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,140
Thanks.

1719
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,780
Thanks, Sykuno.

1720
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,160
They're taking everything.

1721
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,520
You guys have been crushed.

1722
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,420
There's not enough spawning.

1723
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,760
Sykuno, you gotta stop competing with me for spots.

1724
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,320
Yes.

1725
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:58,940
Oh, no.

1726
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,860
I wasn't even trying to.

1727
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,640
I was here first.

1728
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,460
You guys were there first.

1729
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,180
You get a little heavier.

1730
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,580
Guys, I...

1731
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,200
It's lagging.

1732
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,280
It's fine.

1733
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,760
I'm okay.

1734
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,180
I was there.

1735
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,460
I was gonna sit here.

1736
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,860
I'm gonna sit here.

1737
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,720
I think I clearly won.

1738
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,940
I would really like to have...

1739
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,360
Dude, I think I had a chance.

1740
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,240
I have a chance.

1741
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,020
So, guys...

1742
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,860
Oh, we tied.

1743
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,400
Let's go.

1744
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,880
I didn't get one.

1745
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,400
I literally didn't get one.

1746
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,200
So, that feels great.

1747
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,880
Dude, I'm not plugged in.

1748
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,440
My delay.

1749
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,040
I got two coins.

1750
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,600
That's something.

1751
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,740
Dude, why am I so broke?

1752
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:30,840
What the...

1753
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,800
Because you spent money on a star.

1754
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,500
You're in first place.

1755
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,300
You're literally first place.

1756
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,640
What are you?

1757
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,160
Undreamed?

1758
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,080
You son of a bitch.

1759
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:38,920
Can't believe.

1760
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,640
We're playing against Guild Chaos, guys.

1761
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,180
You're gonna end up with ten stars by the end of this, okay?

1762
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm 41 spaces away from a star.

1763
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,840
Actually, Doki, what you can do is since you have that card, when you get to a star, you can buy two of them at one time.

1764
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,220
Yeah, yeah.

1765
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,380
That's what I'm hoping for too.

1766
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,540
Which is pretty nice.

1767
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,940
Which means you have to buy the treasures against you.

1768
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,520
When does the shop get super juiced again?

1769
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,280
Is that a British thing?

1770
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,400
Can you say that again?

1771
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,920
I'm gonna get a chomp card.

1772
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,320
When does the shop get super juiced?

1773
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,880
Like with the better items and stuff.

1774
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,480
Oh, okay.

1775
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,460
When do they get new inventory?

1776
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,080
Yeah, yeah.

1777
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,280
Why would you buy a chomp card?

1778
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,560
You have to throw away an item.

1779
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,580
Yeah, I don't need the mushroom.

1780
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,920
I have two mushrooms.

1781
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,820
God dang.

1782
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,280
If you used that mushroom last time, you would have had a star.

1783
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,640
And another item?

1784
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,020
True.

1785
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,180
You throw the mushroom away again.

1786
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:26,980
Oh.

1787
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,120
Honestly, at this point, you don't even need mushrooms.

1788
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,620
What is this?

1789
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,840
Custom dice can pop.

1790
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,920
Yeah, yeah.

1791
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,420
Yeah, yeah.

1792
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,660
I don't think I need the mushroom.

1793
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,560
Yeah, yeah.

1794
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,260
Get rid of that thing.

1795
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,140
Get it out of here, man.

1796
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:36,360
Get it out of here.

1797
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,280
I'm gonna get rid of that.

1798
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,600
I don't think I need it.

1799
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,220
I know what's gonna happen.

1800
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,920
I love that you have five items and then the rest of us are sitting here with one and zero.

1801
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,740
Yeah, or none.

1802
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,260
I'm just...

1803
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:47,740
This is what happens to me, dude.

1804
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,040
I roll well and then I start rolling zero.

1805
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:51,380
Oh, no.

1806
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,160
Yeah, but I don't want...

1807
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,940
Okay, give me coins.

1808
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,480
Give me coins.

1809
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:53,880
Give me coins.

1810
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,260
Give me coins.

1811
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,640
Give me coins.

1812
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,000
Give me coins.

1813
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,800
Give me coins.

1814
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,180
Give me coins.

1815
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:56,520
Give me coins.

1816
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,100
Oh, we got ten coins, though.

1817
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,220
Maybe, Elif, if you start winning games, you get coins.

1818
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,620
Oh, this next game.

1819
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:05,900
Okay.

1820
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,540
This next game.

1821
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,760
If I could just roll an eight here, that would be... that would just really make my day, you know?

1822
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,240
Son of a...

1823
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,320
Ooh.

1824
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,600
All right, just six more.

1825
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,000
Just six more.

1826
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:18,880
Just surely.

1827
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,000
Hey.

1828
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,840
Hey, maybe you'll get an item, too.

1829
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,520
More money.

1830
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,500
Yeah, maybe.

1831
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,540
Can I get an item, more money, or an item back?

1832
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:25,760
Wait.

1833
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:25,780
Wait.

1834
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:25,900
Oh, dude.

1835
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,140
Item bag would be crazy here.

1836
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,000
You know what would be crazy?

1837
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,720
If I use...

1838
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:28,880
Oh!

1839
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,320
Dude, no way.

1840
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,200
Well, that's good for you, though.

1841
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:32,720
Yeah, it's good.

1842
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,400
Don't say it, Doki.

1843
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,480
Don't say it, Doki.

1844
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,680
You're gonna go to hell if you say it.

1845
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,700
Doki, do it.

1846
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,600
Do it, Doki.

1847
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:37,980
Do it.

1848
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,300
You're gonna go to hell, Doki.

1849
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,660
Hit him with a Trump Cool Doki.

1850
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,240
I did this.

1851
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:41,720
Ah.

1852
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,160
There's so many better times to use it.

1853
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,720
Hit him with a Trump Cool Doki.

1854
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,000
Do it.

1855
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,320
Oh, my God.

1856
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,620
Wouldn't it be funny if you get double ones?

1857
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,960
Wouldn't that be...

1858
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,220
Oh, four?

1859
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,340
It would be less than five.

1860
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:52,700
Oh!

1861
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:55,860
Three?

1862
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,300
Oh, my God.

1863
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,600
Hey, maybe you can get a Chomp Call and use it next game.

1864
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,660
Yeah, get another one.

1865
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,340
Get another Chomp Call.

1866
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:01,660
Screw it.

1867
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:01,960
Yeah.

1868
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,400
Get a Chomp Call.

1869
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,720
Why not?

1870
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,080
Yeah, just do it.

1871
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,600
Get one.

1872
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,100
Get another Chomp Call.

1873
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,240
I'm getting a Skeleton Key, okay?

1874
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,480
Because I need this.

1875
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,560
Wait, guys.

1876
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,940
He's one of those players.

1877
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,740
He's a Skeleton Key player.

1878
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,400
Dude, he's trying to steal.

1879
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,260
Who the fuck uses a Skeleton Key?

1880
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:12,780
He's gonna steal from King Boo.

1881
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,180
We all know the plan.

1882
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,480
He's gonna steal everything.

1883
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,560
We all know the plan.

1884
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:15,980
He's trying to trick us.

1885
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,000
No, guys.

1886
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:16,580
I'm a friend.

1887
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,740
We should all gang up and chill.

1888
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,260
Hey, Trey.

1889
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,680
Have I ever told you that you were my favorite creature back then?

1890
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,980
He's stealing from all of us.

1891
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,860
He doesn't even have a choice, I think.

1892
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,600
Now that you've said that, he's probably gonna target you on purpose.

1893
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,420
Those were some good times, man.

1894
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,900
You know, besides getting kicked out and everything.

1895
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,980
It was a real good time.

1896
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,240
Yeah, but I was so mad when you got kicked out when I was in school.

1897
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,460
When I saw that, I was like, how fucking fair.

1898
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,520
Exactly.

1899
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,720
I stopped watching the creatures when they kicked out.

1900
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,600
I said the creatures more like the Cringers.

1901
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,200
Yeah.

1902
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,260
I walked away and I said, never again.

1903
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,200
Oh, that's for money.

1904
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,500
We can all get money.

1905
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,200
Yeah, this doesn't work for me.

1906
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,280
I always suck at this one.

1907
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,360
Oh, sorry.

1908
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,060
I said we.

1909
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,900
You guys always win here, just to be clear.

1910
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,180
Oh.

1911
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,200
Wait.

1912
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,520
We're just...

1913
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,240
Yeah, so...

1914
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,060
Look, he just kills me.

1915
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,780
Like, how do you not die in this?

1916
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,160
You just walk the other way.

1917
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,240
Yeah, me too.

1918
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,600
Just turn the computer off.

1919
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:17,720
Just turn the computer off.

1920
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:20,800
Okay.

1921
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:21,460
Okay.

1922
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,140
Surely.

1923
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,120
Surely.

1924
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,420
Wee.

1925
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,020
Oh, I need that money.

1926
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,680
Get that cash.

1927
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,160
Wait, which way am I walking?

1928
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:27,920
Get the bag.

1929
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,180
Elm, get the bag, bro.

1930
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,300
I can't.

1931
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,080
Grab the money, guys.

1932
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:31,780
Grab the money.

1933
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,040
Elm, why are you getting so close to me, dude?

1934
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,020
Elm, get the bag, dude.

1935
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,460
Elm, you're fumbling the bag.

1936
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,140
Spread out.

1937
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,400
Oh, my God.

1938
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,440
Okay, I got it.

1939
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,740
Get the bag.

1940
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,680
Get the bag, quick.

1941
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,040
Quick, get the bag.

1942
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,360
I got money.

1943
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,960
I got the money.

1944
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,380
Yes.

1945
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:42,740
Okay.

1946
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,800
We got to spread out.

1947
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,440
Elm.

1948
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,180
I'm spreading as much as I can.

1949
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,960
I got literally as spread as I can be.

1950
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,220
Hold strong.

1951
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,540
I have some cash for you guys.

1952
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,020
Hold strong.

1953
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:50,660
Hold strong, guys.

1954
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,280
Hold strong.

1955
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,200
Okay.

1956
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,500
Okay.

1957
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,180
All right.

1958
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:53,720
I got some.

1959
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,180
Wait, you guys did good.

1960
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:55,980
I did shit.

1961
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,360
Okay.

1962
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,280
I think I got like 60% of that.

1963
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:00,720
Oh, no.

1964
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,280
I got more than that.

1965
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,160
I got like one bag.

1966
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,740
I got like one coin.

1967
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,380
I'm going to be so real.

1968
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,280
Oh, wait.

1969
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,680
I got 36 coins.

1970
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,060
No, we all got 36 together.

1971
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,220
It's a team game.

1972
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:11,860
Oh.

1973
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,100
Good job, everybody.

1974
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,000
Good job.

1975
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,620
All right.

1976
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,160
Good job.

1977
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:15,320
Yay.

1978
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,900
I can use my item.

1979
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,520
Oh, yeah.

1980
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,360
Oh, yeah.

1981
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,460
Don't chomp call, please.

1982
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,260
Yay.

1983
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,940
Think of all the good old days.

1984
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,600
Think of the good old days when we used to play games.

1985
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:26,720
Yes.

1986
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:26,920
Very good.

1987
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,240
I'm thinking about the good old days right now where I chomp call over there.

1988
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,600
Think of Elem when he stole your star.

1989
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,460
Oh, I hope.

1990
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,240
Yeah, shouldn't we be talking Elem in first place?

1991
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,620
Shouldn't we be like, oh, guys.

1992
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,620
Guys.

1993
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,180
Guys.

1994
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,540
Guys.

1995
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:37,980
Guys.

1996
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,360
Guys.

1997
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:38,380
Guys.

1998
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,220
Guys.

1999
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:39,620
Guys.

2000
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,280
Guys.

2001
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:40,400
Guys.

2002
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,440
Wait.

2003
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,080
What is this?

2004
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:47,820
It's okay.

2005
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,080
You guys can all chomp call.

2006
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:49,800
Wait.

2007
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,260
Wait.

2008
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,000
Who's second?

2009
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,520
Wait.

2010
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,280
Who's second?

2011
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:54,960
It's right in front of Chilled.

2012
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,860
It's literally in front of Chilled.

2013
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:56,760
Oh.

2014
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,060
Okay.

2015
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,500
Guys.

2016
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:57,920
Guys.

2017
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,280
We can all just chomp call together, guys.

2018
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,140
Oh, I got one.

2019
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,520
Okay.

2020
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:01,900
Let's go.

2021
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,160
Yeah, but seeing as I was kicked out of the creatures, don't you guys feel bad and just let me have it?

2022
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:05,440
No.

2023
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,400
It's right there.

2024
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,060
Yeah, but that was like 10 plus years ago.

2025
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,180
So, like, time moves on.

2026
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,080
We forgot about that now.

2027
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:14,820
Guys.

2028
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,640
Guys, like, the wound that you've just opened in my heart hurts more.

2029
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,380
Dude, why do I keep rolling so freaking low now?

2030
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:22,960
Like, what is this?

2031
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,180
Okay.

2032
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,480
Here we go.

2033
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,120
Come on.

2034
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,660
Give me more coins.

2035
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,060
No.

2036
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,640
No.

2037
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,560
Well, I know exactly where I'm giving this to.

2038
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,460
Dude, you gotta use it on Doki.

2039
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,200
Okay.

2040
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,400
Okay.

2041
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,660
You got it.

2042
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,300
Chomp call.

2043
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:34,900
Chomp call.

2044
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,820
You know you want to.

2045
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,240
You gotta chomp call, man.

2046
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:37,560
You gotta do it.

2047
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,320
Get rid of it quick.

2048
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,100
But you have a heart.

2049
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,680
You're different from these other people.

2050
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,240
I know what it felt like to get chomp called when it was right in front of me.

2051
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,040
Yeah.

2052
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,100
I can't do that to him.

2053
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,160
It just happened to me.

2054
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,100
No, hurt people don't hurt people.

2055
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,520
Yeah, but what if he does that to you?

2056
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,760
But what if I chomp call it and it appears in front of me, though?

2057
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,560
Yeah, exactly.

2058
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,440
Like, what if I chomp call it and it appears in front of me and then the world is right again, you know?

2059
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,360
You're making me unhappy for a chance to make you happy?

2060
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,340
This is guaranteed me unhappiness.

2061
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,660
Remember what Saikuro did to you.

2062
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,860
He got rid of it.

2063
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,640
Well, no.

2064
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,800
I did this because Doki did this.

2065
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,280
Dude, I'm making a list at this point.

2066
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,140
He dialed us the orange.

2067
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:11,660
That's mine.

2068
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,840
This could be mine.

2069
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,020
Doki would cause all this.

2070
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:14,220
That's mine.

2071
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,040
That's true.

2072
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,180
You know what?

2073
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,480
You're right.

2074
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,280
And if you had got that one, it probably would move to my spot and no one even had to use a change shot.

2075
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,300
Yeah, but then, but then, the only reason why I did this was because Ellum took the first star.

2076
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,040
Oh, so now we're blaming Nina.

2077
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,980
Oh, we do hate Ellum again.

2078
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,280
Yeah.

2079
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:26,880
Blame Nina.

2080
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:27,880
Blame the guy who can't speak properly.

2081
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,020
So this is all Ellum's fault.

2082
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,520
Yeah, this is all Ellum's fault.

2083
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,300
Blame the guy who can't speak properly.

2084
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,560
Blame the guy who can't speak properly.

2085
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:32,640
Blame the guy who can't speak properly.

2086
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:32,700
This is all Ellum's fault.

2087
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,880
We're going to do a funny chomp call again.

2088
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,200
It makes sense.

2089
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,740
Wait, Sakuna.

2090
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,780
I agree.

2091
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,880
Do you want this cast, iSports Sakuna?

2092
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,740
Because it's got, it's got your name written all over it.

2093
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,740
It's a psycho.

2094
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,960
Honestly, if you use it, it'll help me, actually.

2095
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,580
Oh, money.

2096
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,040
Didn't need money.

2097
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,240
Yeah, because that'll get me closer to landing on that bank.

2098
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,460
That's true.

2099
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,260
Oh, two times coins.

2100
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:53,720
This is a big one.

2101
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,160
Two eggs.

2102
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,360
Double mini coin game.

2103
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,080
Okay.

2104
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,340
X-ray payday.

2105
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:57,900
X-ray payday.

2106
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,920
It'll be 40 coins for us.

2107
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,340
Boomba spotting.

2108
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,260
Oh, it's counting time.

2109
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,080
I can't count.

2110
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,420
Okay.

2111
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:03,600
Chat time.

2112
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:03,840
Chat time.

2113
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,480
Tell me how to, tell me the right answer, chat.

2114
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,560
How do I?

2115
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,680
You just gotta count?

2116
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,400
Yeah, you just gotta count.

2117
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,380
You click every time.

2118
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,260
Yeah, and the crazy one is, you don't know what you're, and you don't know what you're at or anything.

2119
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,420
This one's a difficult one.

2120
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:17,680
Oh, yeah.

2121
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,120
Okay.

2122
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,580
I've actually got a strap for this.

2123
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,120
I actually have a strap.

2124
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,100
I think you can't go down either.

2125
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:21,980
You can't.

2126
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,640
You can't.

2127
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,380
You can only count.

2128
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,040
Here we go.

2129
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,240
You ready?

2130
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,240
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2131
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:27,520
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2132
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,100
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2133
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2134
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,260
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2135
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,140
I have to click.

2136
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,900
Oh, I haven't been clicking one time.

2137
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,500
I fucked up.

2138
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,180
There's no way.

2139
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,020
Dude, I'm just randomly clicking at this point.

2140
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,840
I don't know what I'm on.

2141
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,420
I just...

2142
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,060
Is it usually like a high number?

2143
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,420
How many times have you clicked?

2144
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:47,560
I don't know.

2145
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,460
I'm not sure.

2146
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,800
Wait, you guys are still spamming?

2147
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,760
Wait.

2148
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,320
I've just been spamming this whole time.

2149
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,580
I'm not even thinking about it.

2150
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,920
Wait.

2151
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,060
Oh.

2152
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,760
What the hell?

2153
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,720
You're at 48.

2154
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,340
How are you at 48?

2155
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,200
Dude, was it 38?

2156
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,020
Dude, it was 38, 100%.

2157
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,240
Oh, no.

2158
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,260
I think we nailed it.

2159
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,020
I think we fucking nailed it.

2160
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,040
Oh, no.

2161
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,900
I did one extra click.

2162
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,420
No.

2163
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,180
No.

2164
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:05,460
No.

2165
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,080
I did an extra click.

2166
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,740
48.

2167
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,500
I don't know how he got 48, but...

2168
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,680
That's so awesome.

2169
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,120
Oh, yeah.

2170
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,960
We call that British math.

2171
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,500
British math, guys.

2172
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:22,120
I mean, to be fair, he was like trying to do random numbers thinking that's how it works in a clicking game.

2173
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,020
Honestly, my thing made no sense because they know, like, how would they know the number?

2174
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,080
Yeah, I don't know why I was doing that.

2175
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:29,420
That was stupid.

2176
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:29,880
Yeah.

2177
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,560
But the good thing is you were definitely naming some prime numbers in the beginning.

2178
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:34,740
Yeah, yeah.

2179
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:34,860
That was good.

2180
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,000
That was nice.

2181
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,560
Yeah, I was.

2182
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,700
Prime numbers is a good thing.

2183
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,700
Maybe prime numbers has come natural to me now, you know?

2184
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,920
Yeah, you're learning.

2185
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,960
Well, thank God for that.

2186
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:43,840
Finally.

2187
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:48,320
Elam, I want to see you in the service industry where it's like the bill's $30 and you're like, I'll take 40.

2188
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:48,900
That's fine.

2189
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,240
I would love to see how it works.

2190
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:50,740
Oh, my God.

2191
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,520
Well, Elam did used to work at Hollister.

2192
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,560
I used to work at Hollister.

2193
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,120
Yeah.

2194
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,580
But how old were you when you worked at Hollister?

2195
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:55,900
You were the model or were you the cashier?

2196
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,660
I would just like...

2197
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,840
I kind of worked in the store.

2198
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,880
So I wasn't like... they had like the term as model, but I wasn't like a model.

2199
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,660
It's just like a cringe thing.

2200
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,300
They would like call you.

2201
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,600
But it wasn't like that.

2202
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,180
Did you have to wear like tight shirts on purpose or like...

2203
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,720
Oh, damn.

2204
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,100
We would have to wear tight shirts.

2205
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,320
Yeah.

2206
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,780
Dude, Elam's kind of a gigachat.

2207
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,920
I'm not a gigachat.

2208
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,260
I'm not.

2209
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,240
Now that you can switch in here too, dude.

2210
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,880
I mean, like, he's not like a gigachat in the video games, but like in real life, though, he's tall.

2211
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,000
He works out.

2212
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:25,540
Oh.

2213
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:26,780
Whoa.

2214
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,660
Why are you acting surprised?

2215
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,620
You're the one working out.

2216
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,600
Oh, no.

2217
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,440
I appreciate you gassing me up.

2218
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,600
This is nice.

2219
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:33,920
Yeah.

2220
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,100
Of course.

2221
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:34,940
That's my guy.

2222
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:35,760
That's my guy right there.

2223
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,400
The D1 of glazing right now.

2224
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:37,820
Keep it up.

2225
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,180
Yeah.

2226
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,240
That's when you know he's a bro.

2227
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,380
Yeah.

2228
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,500
Like, he's gonna still like... he won't let you win in video games, but at least he's gassing you up.

2229
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,440
Yeah.

2230
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:54,880
Dude, when we were on our Tekken phase, man, I think I got like a 30 win streak on him and he was going crazy.

2231
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,500
Oh, dude.

2232
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:55,840
Oh, wait.

2233
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,340
Okay.

2234
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,220
Sorry, people started saying I sound like a lawnmower because I was just like, I was just growling by the end.

2235
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,620
It was just like...

2236
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,260
Ellum, we gotta win.

2237
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,040
Ellum, I believe in you.

2238
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,120
Ellum, I believe in you.

2239
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:07,820
Ellum, we...

2240
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,080
You should not.

2241
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,380
You should not believe in me.

2242
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:08,840
Ellum, please.

2243
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,660
Ellum, please.

2244
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,540
We gotta...

2245
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:11,860
We got this.

2246
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,720
We got...

2247
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,200
Ellum.

2248
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,640
Ellum.

2249
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:15,780
Please.

2250
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,160
No way.

2251
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,020
We're locked in.

2252
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,760
Please, you got locked in.

2253
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,640
I'll go left.

2254
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,360
You go right.

2255
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,020
I'll go left.

2256
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,640
You go right.

2257
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,340
I'll go left.

2258
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,000
Which was...

2259
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,260
Okay.

2260
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,080
Ellum, please.

2261
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:27,860
Ellum.

2262
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,440
Oh, we are crushing them.

2263
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:29,920
They are done.

2264
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:30,460
Please.

2265
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,720
Dude, we are locked.

2266
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,180
Wait.

2267
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,620
We did it.

2268
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:32,960
We did it.

2269
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,320
Okay.

2270
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:33,720
Yes.

2271
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,020
Okay.

2272
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,180
I'll go the other direction that you're going.

2273
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:36,460
Okay.

2274
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,220
We should have been given that one.

2275
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:37,580
That's fine.

2276
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:37,740
Oh, my God.

2277
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,100
Me and Shield.

2278
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,260
I'm going up to the...

2279
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:39,460
Yeah.

2280
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:39,780
Okay.

2281
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,540
And then...

2282
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:41,680
Oh, my God.

2283
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,200
I went too high.

2284
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,320
Oh, my God.

2285
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,000
I need you to...

2286
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,340
Wait.

2287
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,620
I need you to...

2288
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,460
Wait.

2289
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,560
Ellum, I need you to work with me.

2290
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,520
Hey, you know what?

2291
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,260
We should do more team games.

2292
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:55,900
This was too easy.

2293
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,540
Oh, my God.

2294
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:56,740
Dude.

2295
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,360
Me and Shield.

2296
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,220
Destroy.

2297
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,300
I already need you to actually get it together.

2298
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,180
All right, guys.

2299
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,900
Who wants Ellum as a teammate, guys?

2300
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,840
Next game.

2301
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,300
I'm so embarrassed.

2302
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,840
But, Ellum, at least you're first.

2303
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,540
Ellum, at least you're first.

2304
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,200
Everything.

2305
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,420
Everything went wrong.

2306
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,440
Dude, Ellum is the best.

2307
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,360
Ellum is in first place, though.

2308
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:19,680
I feel like...

2309
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,160
Yeah, Ellum.

2310
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:20,440
Ellum.

2311
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,640
Everything went wrong.

2312
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,340
You're still on first place.

2313
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,980
Dude, I want to point out that Doki was just following me the whole time.

2314
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,360
That was...

2315
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,040
Oh, yeah.

2316
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,380
I was walking the opposite direction of you.

2317
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,780
I was literally...

2318
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,720
Every time I try to walk in the opposite direction of you, you keep fucking following me.

2319
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,140
You guys got to start 12 and 6 and just circle around, guys.

2320
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,340
Guys, who's going to do the next chomp call?

2321
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,560
We're getting closer to it.

2322
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,120
I have so much money.

2323
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,200
I just need it.

2324
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,340
Wait.

2325
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,000
What items do I...

2326
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,140
Wait.

2327
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,040
I've got a cursed dice block.

2328
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:51,860
Wait.

2329
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,800
Now, who would like this?

2330
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,100
Which one of my friends would enjoy this?

2331
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,100
Well, Skuno gets a chance at the bank, which is nice.

2332
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:02,680
I didn't get a chance at the bank, but Chilled sounds like he's worried about getting it.

2333
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,560
Yeah, Chilled, you do sound a little concerned.

2334
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,340
Oh, just a tiny bit.

2335
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,960
He sounds a little stressed out.

2336
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:11,080
The thing is, Chilled, with me, I'd always rather go for the more chaotic option, which unfortunately is...

2337
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,420
Which means Doki worth it.

2338
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,020
Which means it's...

2339
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,200
Wait.

2340
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:14,880
I was going to press Doki.

2341
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,460
I'm just sorry.

2342
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,580
Oh, wow.

2343
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,080
What happened?

2344
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,300
You poisoned me at the damn late daughter's wedding?

2345
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,020
What the fuck is this?

2346
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,200
That's crazy.

2347
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,260
Dude, he just got chomp called when he was right in front of the star.

2348
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:26,960
Now you do that.

2349
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,700
He's right in front of the next star, too.

2350
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,200
That's the worst part.

2351
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,120
We're together now, Chilled.

2352
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,620
He's even worse.

2353
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,120
Dude, I thought that was Doki.

2354
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:37,140
I'm so sorry.

2355
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:37,740
That's just evil, man.

2356
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,860
He just got chomp called and lost the star.

2357
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,740
Now you're going to do that?

2358
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,380
That's evil.

2359
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,660
Dude, why did you choose Mario?

2360
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,640
I thought you were freaking...

2361
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,700
I am Mario.

2362
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,840
You lose track of me?

2363
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,060
I am Mario.

2364
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,140
How did you forget he was Mario?

2365
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,800
How the fuck did you get the money anyway?

2366
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:53,800
No, I got the bank anyway.

2367
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,040
No, not bad.

2368
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:55,620
Not bad.

2369
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:00,000
I literally said earlier, I was like, oh, Chilled even has the eye on Mario moustache, and I still fucking forgot.

2370
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,180
I can't believe you got confused between Waluigi and Mario.

2371
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,400
Like, one is tall and the other is short.

2372
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,140
I bet you don't even care that you got kicked out of the creatures.

2373
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,900
I bet you were fucking happy when it happened.

2374
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:12,560
Yeah.

2375
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,920
I don't know what the creatures is.

2376
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,140
I don't know what the creatures is.

2377
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,060
I'm going to say, I don't know.

2378
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,440
He doesn't even know what the creatures are.

2379
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,440
He's not OT.

2380
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,760
Where were you 13 years ago?

2381
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,020
How dare you not remember something 13 years ago?

2382
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,440
I don't even know what I even watched 13 years ago.

2383
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:26,960
I'm going to say it.

2384
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,880
I don't...

2385
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,700
I think I...

2386
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,960
I remember what I watched.

2387
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:30,580
Yeah, I remember.

2388
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,560
I used to watch Minecraft YouTuber Let's Players.

2389
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,580
Oh, like who?

2390
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,220
I used to watch...

2391
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,800
I used to watch Cod Montages back in the day.

2392
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:39,800
Yeah, dude.

2393
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,040
I used to watch like those...

2394
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,360
Dude, I used to watch C9ers back in the day when like he would do his CSGO things and shit.

2395
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,860
Wait, so you remember C9ers?

2396
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,420
But no.

2397
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,020
You're not chilled?

2398
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:49,680
Wow.

2399
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,320
Not the same group.

2400
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:51,880
Dude, that's...

2401
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,460
Me and Shannon played so much together.

2402
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,880
We played for years together.

2403
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,760
Does anyone remember Paperbat though?

2404
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,420
Anyone remember Paperbat VG?

2405
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,680
No, he died.

2406
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,400
That's actually crazy.

2407
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:04,480
He died.

2408
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,640
Wait, my chat said you used to...

2409
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,120
I even saw his cooking video.

2410
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,620
You can use...

2411
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,200
Wait, chilled?

2412
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,680
We used to work on a Disney show.

2413
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,900
No, the golden one ran out.

2414
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,020
I used to work on a Disney show.

2415
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:13,420
Oh, my God.

2416
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:14,180
The delay.

2417
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,300
He used to do stuff with nanners.

2418
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:16,400
He used to do stuff with nanners.

2419
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,020
He used to do stuff with nanners.

2420
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:17,420
He used to do stuff with nanners.

2421
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,080
The fact that you didn't see nanners, that's crazy.

2422
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,980
Bro, I don't even like Alan.

2423
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:22,680
Can I say that?

2424
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,360
Can I say that?

2425
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,920
No, Junkyard was right.

2426
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,140
When Junkyard said that you were a pain in the ass, he was so right.

2427
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,580
I mean, I'm not even going to fight it.

2428
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:35,820
Holy shit.

2429
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,380
Hey, we got tied.

2430
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,220
If they saw a nanners cooking video, you're literally in that video.

2431
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,340
I'm in a nanners cooking video?

2432
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:43,000
Yeah.

2433
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,120
I think you're just like, I am?

2434
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,620
I am?

2435
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:45,900
I don't remember.

2436
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,420
Dude, when you think about like all the nanners, you're literally in that video.

2437
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,740
All the content that we've done over the last 10, 15 years, I don't...

2438
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,200
Someone tells me I could have done something like that.

2439
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:52,700
Sounds about right.

2440
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:52,840
Yeah, probably.

2441
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,700
You've been a con curator since 2008.

2442
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,140
I'd be surprised if you remember everything.

2443
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,440
2008 is crazy.

2444
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,060
Well, some of the great things are like, I'll go back and watch some of my older videos and be like, ah, this guy's pretty funny.

2445
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,480
You know?

2446
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,740
And that's always nice when you go back and can make yourself laugh.

2447
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,200
Put a smile on my face.

2448
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,860
Hey, let's go.

2449
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,140
Yeah, really.

2450
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,520
It's like an old...

2451
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,400
I went through some of my old YouTube videos from like, maybe like five years ago.

2452
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,220
And they're just horrible.

2453
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:21,760
Dude, they're like OG, like old school Fortnite updates and they're the most cringe shit I've ever seen.

2454
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:21,900
Oh my God.

2455
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,120
The Fortnite update.

2456
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,120
That's funny.

2457
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:24,600
They are so bad.

2458
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,880
And then I found out the other day...

2459
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,440
When did I find out?

2460
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:27,640
I...

2461
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,460
Someone...

2462
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,040
I used to...

2463
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:29,160
Okay.

2464
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,220
Back in the day, I used to make like fitness YouTube videos.

2465
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,660
Did you just clap at us?

2466
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,180
Did you literally just clap at us?

2467
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,080
Really?

2468
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,660
Can you send us a link to it?

2469
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:39,740
No, no.

2470
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,180
I got rid of all the videos.

2471
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:41,680
They don't exist.

2472
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,400
They're over the channel.

2473
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,200
What?

2474
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:43,600
Why?

2475
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,080
Why not?

2476
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,640
Because dude, they're cringe as fuck.

2477
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,400
What do you mean?

2478
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,020
It's so funny.

2479
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,800
Hey, it's LM here.

2480
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,600
I'm going to show you how to get ripped in 10 easy steps.

2481
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,240
Wait, how did you do your intro?

2482
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,120
What was your intro like?

2483
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:54,940
What was your intro?

2484
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:55,200
Yeah.

2485
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,160
I can't even do...

2486
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,280
Because I can't raise my voice.

2487
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,060
I can't do it.

2488
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:58,240
No, it's okay.

2489
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,440
Do the Monotone version.

2490
01:05:59,580 --> 01:05:59,940
Let's try it.

2491
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:00,720
Just one extreme shot, dude.

2492
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,200
Just one.

2493
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
Dude, I can't...

2494
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:02,920
No, okay.

2495
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,880
Did Doki just buy two stars in one turn?

2496
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,240
Yeah, just buy two.

2497
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:05,280
Yeah, exactly.

2498
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,180
That's right.

2499
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,220
Dude, the about section...

2500
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:08,360
She's treating.

2501
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,480
The about section said...

2502
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,040
This is the...

2503
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,640
It said, good vibes and live life.

2504
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,400
Dude, you are on everything.

2505
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:18,900
You're on every white girl's wall in the background.

2506
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,580
Good vibes, dude.

2507
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,960
Oh, my God.

2508
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,620
It's insane.

2509
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,480
Dude, the name of it was Project Aesthetics.

2510
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,860
Oh, my God.

2511
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,280
Project Aesthetics.

2512
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,020
Wait, did you default delete it or did you just private it?

2513
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:35,480
Oh, no.

2514
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,400
The channel's there.

2515
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,980
The videos are not on the other hand.

2516
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,200
Wait, but is it a full delete or unlisted?

2517
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,060
Dude, I wish they were.

2518
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:41,900
I would watch it.

2519
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,180
Yeah.

2520
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,900
I didn't know that'd be it.

2521
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,800
Good vibes, man.

2522
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,440
Good vibes, bro.

2523
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,400
Good vibes, bro.

2524
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:48,860
Good vibes.

2525
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
Good vibes and live life, dude.

2526
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,780
I actually want to...

2527
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,580
How old were you when you wrote that?

2528
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,280
How old were you?

2529
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,180
Like 21, 22.

2530
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,420
It wasn't...

2531
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,280
I wasn't even like young.

2532
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,300
You're not even like...

2533
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,780
I've got all of life figured out.

2534
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,600
Oh, God.

2535
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,420
And then I would do this...

2536
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,100
I had this Instagram page where I would...

2537
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,880
Dude, I did an entire post on the benefits of green tea.

2538
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,220
Like, what the fuck am I doing?

2539
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:10,940
The benefits?

2540
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,880
So, what are the benefits of green tea?

2541
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,360
Green tea is good for you.

2542
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,100
Green tea is good for you?

2543
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:15,960
It is good for you.

2544
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,300
But just...

2545
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,220
But it's just the fact like...

2546
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:17,340
Yeah.

2547
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:17,380
I don't know.

2548
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:17,480
I...

2549
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,180
No.

2550
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,000
Because the picture was just a picture of a soggy teabag.

2551
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,600
Oh, fuck.

2552
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,260
So, it wasn't even like authentic green tea.

2553
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:25,840
It wasn't even like a...

2554
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,440
No.

2555
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:26,940
It was just like...

2556
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,560
It was green tea.

2557
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,700
We've got two stars.

2558
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:29,420
Oh.

2559
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,040
Oh, I'm winning.

2560
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:30,680
Oh, we're doing it.

2561
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,160
He doesn't even notice he's winning.

2562
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,800
He's just going with the flow.

2563
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:34,960
What are we doing down here?

2564
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,340
I'm just...

2565
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,060
I'm in with the vibes.

2566
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,480
Dude, me and Chill, they're at the bottom of the barrel fighting for our lives right now.

2567
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,860
Yeah, but Chill has a plan.

2568
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,500
We're cash rich, though.

2569
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,720
We are cash rich.

2570
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,640
Chill has a plan.

2571
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,820
He's going to win with the...

2572
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,620
Like, the bonus stars.

2573
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,360
Can I ask you guys a question?

2574
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:53,960
Yeah.

2575
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:54,460
Sure.

2576
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,740
So, have any of any of you guys ever tried to, like, test out whether you could sing or not?

2577
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,760
I thought you were going to say something else.

2578
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,460
I really thought you were going...

2579
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,480
Did you try to suck your own dick?

2580
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,980
I really thought you were going to go there.

2581
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,800
I'm so sorry.

2582
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,100
What?

2583
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,140
I thought that's where he was going.

2584
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,220
Chill.

2585
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:09,880
I feel like...

2586
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,380
I mean...

2587
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,760
I could see Elm doing that.

2588
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,640
I could try to suck your own dick.

2589
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:14,400
Wait.

2590
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,340
Suck your own dick?

2591
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,000
Wait.

2592
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,600
Wait.

2593
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,260
You need to remove a rib for that.

2594
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:19,620
After the live life thing, dude.

2595
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:19,980
Nah.

2596
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,560
I don't know anymore.

2597
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:20,800
Yeah.

2598
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,940
I say live life.

2599
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:22,840
Good vibes.

2600
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,720
Then I don't proceed to try and suck my own dick.

2601
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,000
Good vibes.

2602
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:28,680
Yeah.

2603
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,460
Good vibes.

2604
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,020
You know?

2605
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:31,640
Oh, God.

2606
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,760
Love yourself.

2607
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:33,780
Oh, God.

2608
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:34,620
Yeah.

2609
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,380
So, have you guys ever, like, tried to see if you could sing or not?

2610
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,560
By, like, recording yourself?

2611
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,640
Well, I have to.

2612
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,020
I had to as a VTuber.

2613
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,540
Oh, I never recorded myself.

2614
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,500
I tried.

2615
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,440
Realized I sucked.

2616
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,020
I, um...

2617
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,140
I, uh...

2618
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,400
I recorded myself.

2619
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:45,800
Right?

2620
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:45,980
Yeah.

2621
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,580
And I didn't realize I sucked.

2622
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,300
I didn't realize until, like, maybe, like, a few weeks ago that I actually still have the recordings.

2623
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,280
Um...

2624
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,800
How old are you?

2625
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,440
Why don't you just sing right now?

2626
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,020
Maybe, like, I was like, I can't.

2627
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,140
I can't.

2628
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,840
But, like, what I can do is play...

2629
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,440
Sing us Maroon 5.

2630
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,000
I can play you guys one of the recordings if you would like.

2631
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:00,460
Oh, yeah.

2632
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:00,840
Play it.

2633
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,180
Well, let me find it.

2634
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:02,320
Okay.

2635
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:02,540
Sure.

2636
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:03,760
Is it gonna hurt?

2637
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,120
Okay.

2638
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:04,180
Okay.

2639
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:04,420
Okay.

2640
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:04,960
Okay.

2641
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,000
Okay.

2642
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,000
Okay.

2643
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,820
Is it good or so bad that I'm shocked he's showing it to us?

2644
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,560
Dude, no, no.

2645
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,080
I'm real...

2646
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,640
But you feel confident about showing this.

2647
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,960
Like, this is something you want to show us.

2648
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,140
Yeah, yeah.

2649
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:13,560
You can hear it.

2650
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,100
Yeah.

2651
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,080
Oh.

2652
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,400
Oh.

2653
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:17,980
Oh, okay.

2654
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,240
Yo, but you're confident showing it to us.

2655
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:20,760
So, like...

2656
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,820
One day we need to talk.

2657
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,880
He walks.

2658
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,880
You said sit down.

2659
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,560
It's just...

2660
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,680
Where's your accent?

2661
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,920
Smiles politely.

2662
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,620
Sorry, Bob.

2663
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:33,560
Wait.

2664
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,460
Your accent disappeared.

2665
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:35,340
Like...

2666
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,980
You were here.

2667
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,540
This depressing song is making me depressed.

2668
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:38,780
Wait.

2669
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:38,920
Listen.

2670
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:39,700
Wait for the drop.

2671
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,040
Wait.

2672
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,300
Oh, please.

2673
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,040
First start.

2674
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,040
What the...

2675
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,180
This song is how to save a life that's having the complete opposite effect.

2676
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,100
I wonder if we'll get DMCA'd for that.

2677
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,360
I don't think so.

2678
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,520
Honestly, if you did, that'd be, like, a big compliment.

2679
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,420
That would be a big compliment.

2680
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,200
Yeah, that would be a big compliment that you were...

2681
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,060
Dude, who's pushing me?

2682
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,540
Why?

2683
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:05,960
I don't think so.

2684
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,320
Why?

2685
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,520
I don't understand.

2686
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,060
I wasn't even moving.

2687
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,880
I wasn't even moving.

2688
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,780
I was so peaceful.

2689
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,540
I was so peaceful chilling there.

2690
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,320
I need my $10.

2691
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,120
I just got pushed to my death.

2692
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,340
Why?

2693
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,740
We did it, guys.

2694
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,580
We did it.

2695
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,880
We all lost.

2696
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,260
Wait.

2697
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:32,940
Everybody loses.

2698
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,320
Now we all have to pay.

2699
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,200
Let's go.

2700
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:35,940
Oh, my God.

2701
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,280
What?

2702
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,760
Dude, I got Ed Sheeran on there.

2703
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,000
There's one of me rapping as well.

2704
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,300
It's like, dude, I try all avenues of my vocal potential.

2705
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,560
It turns out I suck at them all.

2706
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,520
I can't lie.

2707
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,400
I got some cringe videos.

2708
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,920
I got HeyThereDelilah somewhere on my YouTube channel.

2709
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:50,860
Oh, shit.

2710
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:51,920
You do?

2711
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,940
Yeah, I want to hear that one.

2712
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:54,580
That one's fun.

2713
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:54,780
You shouldn't.

2714
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,460
Definitely shouldn't.

2715
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:55,800
Oh.

2716
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:56,720
Wait.

2717
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,600
How many views does it have?

2718
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,120
I don't even know.

2719
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,000
I don't even know, man.

2720
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,020
Don't even look at it.

2721
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,960
It's been years since I've looked at it.

2722
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,180
Is it still public?

2723
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,620
Or is it, like, privated?

2724
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:05,920
I don't even know, man.

2725
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,620
I think somebody might have downloaded it and re-uploaded it.

2726
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:08,960
Wait.

2727
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,020
Why did you private it?

2728
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,180
Because it was horrific.

2729
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:12,740
Why?

2730
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,000
No.

2731
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,400
No.

2732
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:13,980
Let it out.

2733
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,100
Let the cringe free.

2734
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,600
Let the cringe free?

2735
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:17,940
Yeah.

2736
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,580
See, cringe is cool now in 2024.

2737
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,020
Yeah.

2738
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,580
It's cool now.

2739
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,360
But cringe wasn't cool in 2015.

2740
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:29,360
Dude, I remember when I used to make COD montages back in the day, and some of my friends in school found it, and I never felt more embarrassed in my entire life.

2741
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:29,960
It was terrible.

2742
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,940
Dude, we should play Black Ops Zombies 6.

2743
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,080
Oh, my God.

2744
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,920
I miss zombies.

2745
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,040
Oh, my God.

2746
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,440
Yeah, dude.

2747
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,540
Dude, we should play the new zombies.

2748
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:36,820
Yeah.

2749
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,720
I heard the new Black Ops is really good.

2750
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,160
Do you want to play it?

2751
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:41,540
Yeah.

2752
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,240
I'm fucking down.

2753
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:42,820
Wait.

2754
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,580
When's it coming out?

2755
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,100
It's not super long.

2756
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,080
Is it next month?

2757
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:46,460
November, right?

2758
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:46,940
Early November?

2759
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,380
I think it's next month.

2760
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:47,700
Yeah.

2761
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,540
Next two months.

2762
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:48,880
Yeah.

2763
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,200
Next month.

2764
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,620
Yeah, dude.

2765
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,260
I'll play that.

2766
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,100
Fuck yeah.

2767
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:52,400
Let's do it.

2768
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:52,800
Yeah.

2769
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:53,680
I fucking love zombies.

2770
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,980
Dude, I feel like...

2771
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,860
When was the last zombies game they did?

2772
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,120
I feel like it's been a long time, right?

2773
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:03,120
Well, there was the whole hacking situation that they had, too.

2774
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,440
Hacking situation?

2775
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:06,520
Oh.

2776
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,200
Remember?

2777
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:14,460
They had the whole situation where hackers were going in, can hack into people's lobbies and stuff.

2778
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,580
So people stopped doing it.

2779
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,420
Black Ops.

2780
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,080
I don't remember that at all.

2781
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,600
They did that from zombies?

2782
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,100
Okay.

2783
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,060
Can you guys stop being cringe?

2784
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:22,800
Please leave me alone.

2785
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,840
Please leave me alone.

2786
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,320
Thank you so much.

2787
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,100
We're coming over.

2788
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,880
We're coming over.

2789
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,460
We're going to get you.

2790
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,000
You told it.

2791
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,700
You told actually fuck off.

2792
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:33,800
Okay.

2793
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,700
Here we go.

2794
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,340
Here we go.

2795
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:35,420
Okay.

2796
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:35,520
Sorry.

2797
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,600
Maybe I'll fuck off if you tell me a cartoon character you had a crush on.

2798
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,180
Oh, yeah.

2799
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:40,500
Yeah.

2800
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,400
I won't crush you.

2801
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,280
Johnny Bravo.

2802
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:43,760
Johnny Bravo?

2803
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,880
Get the fuck over here.

2804
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,040
Wait.

2805
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:46,800
Are you serious?

2806
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,940
A cartoon character I actually had a crush on?

2807
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:49,420
Yeah.

2808
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:49,680
Oh, shit.

2809
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,400
Oh, so you lied.

2810
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,700
So we're definitely going to crush you now.

2811
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:53,780
Wait.

2812
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:55,840
I'm too quick.

2813
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:56,560
I'm too quick.

2814
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,020
Oh, dude.

2815
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:57,500
He's fast.

2816
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,340
He's good.

2817
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:58,900
He's...

2818
01:12:58,900 --> 01:12:59,600
Oh.

2819
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,740
We're cornering him.

2820
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:01,220
No.

2821
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,400
We almost got him.

2822
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,160
Get him in the corner.

2823
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,280
Get him in the corner.

2824
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:03,980
Let's try.

2825
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:04,620
Oh.

2826
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,800
Oh, my God.

2827
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,360
Dude, he's juking like crazy.

2828
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,380
Holy shit.

2829
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,160
Why did he get so good with the lag?

2830
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,180
He's cracked.

2831
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,980
Dude, how is he doing this with the lag?

2832
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:13,580
Yes.

2833
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,160
Oh, my God.

2834
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,040
Oh, my God.

2835
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:16,360
He won.

2836
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,880
Dude, I just stalled in the middle of this shoot.

2837
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,040
Dude, I was going to win the whole dang game.

2838
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,180
Holy shit, dude.

2839
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,000
This is my game.

2840
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,180
This is actually my game right now.

2841
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:22,640
The delay.

2842
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:22,940
Oh, my God.

2843
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,600
This is the first time he's ever won.

2844
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,080
Holy crap.

2845
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,340
I don't think I've ever won Mario Kart.

2846
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:27,440
Yeah.

2847
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,780
That's literally his first mini game win.

2848
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,680
This is my game right now.

2849
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,000
Oh, dude.

2850
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,060
I broke their ankles, chat.

2851
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,760
I broke their ankles.

2852
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:35,540
All right.

2853
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,080
Let's see.

2854
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,940
Is anybody close to the star?

2855
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,260
I wish he got 16 turns to catch up.

2856
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,200
Let's see.

2857
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,000
Who's the closest?

2858
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,620
Oh, LM is.

2859
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,820
Does he have enough coins?

2860
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:46,900
Oh, he doesn't.

2861
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:47,480
Okay.

2862
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:47,620
Oh, yeah.

2863
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,360
Oh, we got coins.

2864
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:48,860
Wait.

2865
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,400
We got coins.

2866
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:49,740
No, you don't.

2867
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:49,920
Wait.

2868
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:50,160
No.

2869
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:50,840
No, I don't.

2870
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,700
No, you don't.

2871
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,480
You have fucking 16.

2872
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,120
Turns out I'm a liar.

2873
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,520
So, like, I don't have to worry.

2874
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,000
This isn't Among Us.

2875
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:56,520
You can't lie.

2876
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,100
You're not allowed to.

2877
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,020
Yeah, it turns out I'm a liar.

2878
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:58,420
Shit.

2879
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,300
Oh, my God.

2880
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,600
People lie on the internet?

2881
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,180
Just like that?

2882
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,480
You like lying in Among Us?

2883
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,000
Okay.

2884
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:06,920
Go up north.

2885
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,280
It's so much better for you.

2886
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,700
Can you go up that way?

2887
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,300
Oh, wait.

2888
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:10,540
Yeah.

2889
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,360
If you're in the daytime, you can.

2890
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:11,900
Yeah.

2891
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:12,060
Yeah.

2892
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,360
But I don't want to.

2893
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,620
I just want to.

2894
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,660
I just want to walk this way.

2895
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,200
You just want to pay your taxes?

2896
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,160
That's such a good solution.

2897
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:19,660
I just want to pay taxes.

2898
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,160
Guys, I don't want the Canadian IRS to come over.

2899
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,060
All right.

2900
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:25,860
That's what the Mounties say.

2901
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:26,140
Yeah.

2902
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,840
One star could change my life.

2903
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,720
Just one-time star.

2904
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:37,060
Guys, last time me and Syke played this, I've actually never seen Syke crash out, but he crashed the fuck out of this game.

2905
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,700
Dude, it's a 25-turn game, and I got zero stars.

2906
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,880
Which was insane.

2907
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,660
It was actually unbelievable.

2908
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,740
He's never the sort of person just to leave a call, but the game finished, he just insta-left.

2909
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:51,720
Thanks, guys.

2910
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,260
I got to go.

2911
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,520
Well, that was because I had a collab.

2912
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:54,480
Dude.

2913
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:55,480
I really loved it.

2914
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,160
It was so fun.

2915
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:56,880
It was like...

2916
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,620
Zero stars in the entire match.

2917
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,100
Technically, that was just because I had a collab after, but it did work out.

2918
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,640
It did work out that way.

2919
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,820
Did you not have bonus stars?

2920
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,940
Damn, Doki, you're really going all in on them.

2921
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,700
Because, like, usually the game would feel bad if you're like, since this guy has zero stars, we'll give him a bonus star.

2922
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,140
Nah, drag him.

2923
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:17,640
Let's see her more.

2924
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,620
Hey, why don't you just keep attacking him?

2925
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:20,760
Oh, my God.

2926
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,320
It's my turn.

2927
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,140
I wasn't even paying attention.

2928
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,040
It was just...

2929
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,060
I'm just reliving the trauma.

2930
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:26,320
One star?

2931
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,460
Why am I trying to go here?

2932
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:28,960
Where am I?

2933
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:29,740
Yeah.

2934
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,560
I mean...

2935
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,420
Let me view board real quick.

2936
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,260
You do...

2937
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,640
Oh, does no one have a charm card?

2938
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:37,940
Dude, I'm getting that.

2939
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:38,640
I'm getting that, bro.

2940
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,400
You can't.

2941
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,160
No, I think just you.

2942
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,020
I think just you, Doki.

2943
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,060
You can't get it because...

2944
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,520
I'm going to go up and take the eyeball.

2945
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,980
Oh, unless you guys...

2946
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:46,300
Wait.

2947
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:46,580
How far?

2948
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,000
I look like I won't win any games.

2949
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,280
I'll just have no money.

2950
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,440
Are you preying on my downfall?

2951
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,540
And I just get this star.

2952
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,020
No, I'm just saying that you don't have the money yet to buy it.

2953
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,160
She's calling you a broke boy.

2954
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:56,580
Yeah.

2955
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,340
What the hell?

2956
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:57,960
Why are you calling me broke?

2957
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,320
I'm not calling you broke.

2958
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,420
I'm calling you middle class.

2959
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:01,500
Oh.

2960
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,820
And I'll just...

2961
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,460
All right.

2962
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:05,840
I'll take that.

2963
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,460
I'll take that.

2964
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,560
All right.

2965
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,060
Hired the seven this time, game.

2966
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:11,840
We can do it.

2967
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:12,600
I didn't know.

2968
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,720
I was like, thanks, I guess.

2969
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:16,680
Okay.

2970
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,200
Okay.

2971
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:17,940
I'll take it.

2972
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,060
Oh, a humble 11.

2973
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:20,940
Okay.

2974
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,120
Okay.

2975
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,360
Yes.

2976
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,820
Of course, I must pay my taxes for...

2977
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,520
I am a good citizen.

2978
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:25,920
Pay your taxes, everybody.

2979
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,820
Or the IRS is going to come over.

2980
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:29,260
Never.

2981
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:30,620
Never.

2982
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:30,980
Never.

2983
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,100
Never.

2984
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,380
I don't know why they don't say thanks for your cooperation.

2985
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:33,780
What a mistake.

2986
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,560
How do you get the money from that again?

2987
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,420
Are you going to land on it, right?

2988
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,380
Like directly or something?

2989
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,020
Yeah.

2990
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,400
Yeah.

2991
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:40,900
God damn it.

2992
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,920
Well, you're not going to unlock it.

2993
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,620
You have two keys.

2994
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,680
I know, but it's a daytime ghost.

2995
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:47,560
Yeah.

2996
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,160
Oh.

2997
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:49,480
Yeah.

2998
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,600
The bottom left is a daytime ghost.

2999
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:52,320
Oh.

3000
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:53,980
Oh, wait.

3001
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:54,240
It is.

3002
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:54,440
Yeah.

3003
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:54,540
Sorry.

3004
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,000
I forgot about that.

3005
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,020
Oh.

3006
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,020
Custom block?

3007
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,260
Buy a chomp call.

3008
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,700
Nothing short of an expert gamer.

3009
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,160
He knows he is.

3010
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,320
Buy a chomp call so like Elem can't get the other star.

3011
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,200
I'm not going to use my skeleton key.

3012
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:03,660
He knew the whole game.

3013
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,440
Well, guys, guys, we don't need to target me here, guys.

3014
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,240
I'm just an innocent, innocent guy, you know?

3015
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,480
Yeah, but if you get the star, you get first place.

3016
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,160
But Doki's also on two stars, guys.

3017
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,740
But isn't it nice that we should all be having someone to go against?

3018
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,260
It feels like it would fuel us and unite us to become an enemy.

3019
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:17,780
Yeah, that's so true.

3020
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,760
I believe that.

3021
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:19,340
Aren't we all going against Elem?

3022
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,380
Is that how you think?

3023
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,180
Yeah.

3024
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:21,960
Well, I mean...

3025
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,920
We're all going, ganging up on Elem.

3026
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,480
Wasn't that...

3027
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,300
Yeah, that was...

3028
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,320
Wasn't that the original plan?

3029
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,100
But I'm an ally, guys.

3030
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,760
Sounds like a great plan.

3031
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:29,700
But I'm an ally.

3032
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,120
Guys, I'm a big fan.

3033
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:31,880
I'm an ally.

3034
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,940
Dude, I hate this game.

3035
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,180
Wait, how do you...

3036
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,320
Dude, with the delay, this one is...

3037
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,060
Oh, my God.

3038
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,640
The delay for this is crazy.

3039
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,460
The delay is...

3040
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,200
No, and it stumbles, too?

3041
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,120
Dude, I remember the one time I played baseball, I dislocated my thumb.

3042
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,040
How?

3043
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:47,680
Wait, what...

3044
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,420
What position did you play?

3045
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:49,980
Is it the ball?

3046
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,360
Well, I was the...

3047
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:51,940
What do you call it?

3048
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:52,320
The batter?

3049
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,520
Yeah, it would be the batter.

3050
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:54,960
No, that's correct.

3051
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:55,340
That's correct.

3052
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:55,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3053
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,960
The guy pitched the ball and it just hit me straight in the thumb.

3054
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:58,420
This is terrible.

3055
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,100
Oh, did you...

3056
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,440
Was the delay...

3057
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,500
Were you able to walk the plate?

3058
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,320
Were you...

3059
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,320
Wait, because they broke your right finger?

3060
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,620
Did you walk the plank?

3061
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,540
Walk the plank?

3062
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:05,960
Walk the plank?

3063
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:06,300
Yeah, exactly.

3064
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,060
Walk the plank?

3065
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,880
Yeah, were you able to walk, like, the field?

3066
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,800
I never played baseball, by the way.

3067
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,180
Did you guys ever play rounders?

3068
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,040
What the fuck is a rounders?

3069
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,820
Oh, rounders is that shooting game.

3070
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,180
Yeah, right?

3071
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:18,460
Yeah.

3072
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,180
Oh, yeah.

3073
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,280
Yeah, like the shooting game.

3074
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,740
Wait, what is rounders?

3075
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,140
It's so difficult.

3076
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:22,320
Wait, wait, wait.

3077
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,660
Did you guys ever play tiddlywinks?

3078
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3079
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:26,800
Okay, that's a Harry Potter game.

3080
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,280
That's not real.

3081
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,140
I played tiddlywinks.

3082
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:28,940
It's a sport.

3083
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:29,840
You guys ever played tiddlywinks?

3084
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,120
It's like with beanbags.

3085
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:32,740
Yeah, yeah.

3086
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,040
You have to throw beanbags at each other.

3087
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:34,340
Oh.

3088
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:34,920
Guys, I...

3089
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,320
My phone is covering my screen, by the way.

3090
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,280
That's why I can't see.

3091
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,460
I can't see either.

3092
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:41,960
This is...

3093
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,280
Am I winning?

3094
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:42,860
Oh, wow.

3095
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,140
I am.

3096
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:43,840
My game is trash.

3097
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,380
This game is actually...

3098
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:45,740
I hate this game.

3099
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,400
I hate this game.

3100
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,260
This game is thinking...

3101
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:47,960
Like, what...

3102
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,400
How did Chilled get 13?

3103
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:50,380
What is this, man?

3104
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:50,860
What is this?

3105
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,520
Chilled doesn't have the delay, I swear.

3106
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,900
I swear, did you plug your dongle back in, Chilled?

3107
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,060
He has the dongle.

3108
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,160
He has the dongler.

3109
01:18:58,780 --> 01:18:59,520
There's no...

3110
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,260
He's got the dongle on.

3111
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,600
He's got the dongle.

3112
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,120
I want to point out, Chilled was silent during the whole thing.

3113
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,960
Bro was dialed the fuck in.

3114
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:07,580
Yeah, he was.

3115
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,200
He really needed that minigame win.

3116
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,580
He's not lagging at all.

3117
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,200
He's not lagging at all.

3118
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,020
He's not lagging at all.

3119
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:14,480
I know, but I have to...

3120
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:20,120
I got a win via bonus stars, because there's no way with you bastards calling the game the chop calls and everything else at night, we're going to be free.

3121
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,700
Speaking of chop calls...

3122
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,900
I have zero stars too, man.

3123
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,960
I'm dying out here.

3124
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,840
I think I'm going to spend the 150 on the big guy, because you don't even have a star to steal.

3125
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,680
It would be wasteful.

3126
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,020
Bye.

3127
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:33,760
Oh, yeah, but you could just steal everything.

3128
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,120
Oh.

3129
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:35,960
You could steal everything.

3130
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:36,480
Be right in front of me.

3131
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,120
Be right in front of me for once in my sad life.

3132
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,380
Is it right in front of you?

3133
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,400
Down south.

3134
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:40,960
Come down south.

3135
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:41,320
Come down south.

3136
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:41,740
Please be in me.

3137
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,400
Please be in me.

3138
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:42,960
Oh, it's down there.

3139
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,220
I don't want you to be in me.

3140
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,700
For once in my sad life.

3141
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:46,260
God is cruel.

3142
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:48,360
It's right in front of me, right?

3143
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,580
No, it's definitely not.

3144
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:50,320
It's right in front of me.

3145
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,060
Finally.

3146
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:51,880
It's right in front of me.

3147
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,260
Wait, where am I?

3148
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,180
Dude, are you on the map?

3149
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,260
Finally, it's right in front of me.

3150
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:55,960
Ah, depression.

3151
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,220
Where even am I?

3152
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,320
I don't think this is in front of me.

3153
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,840
I think this is actually really far away from me.

3154
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:00,420
It is.

3155
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,280
It is very far away.

3156
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,360
Oh, Doki.

3157
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:01,880
Doki, do your double...

3158
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,320
Oh, the double dice roll, Doki.

3159
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,000
No, I couldn't.

3160
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,840
I already used an item.

3161
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,100
Oh, you're right.

3162
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:06,580
You used chain shot.

3163
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:06,860
My bad.

3164
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,000
My bad.

3165
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3166
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:11,260
Guys, what if we chop call this away from Doki?

3167
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:12,160
How do you feel about that?

3168
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:12,620
Chop call now.

3169
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,300
What if I buy another...

3170
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,140
Oh, I can't.

3171
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:15,680
Do it.

3172
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,740
I can't buy another chop call.

3173
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,340
Do it now.

3174
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,060
But I could buy a mushroom.

3175
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,220
We need a chop call.

3176
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,820
Can I show you guys my sexy voice?

3177
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:23,700
Oh, yeah.

3178
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,140
Oh, yeah.

3179
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:24,420
What is it?

3180
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,160
I've been working on it.

3181
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,040
Okay.

3182
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:27,140
Okay.

3183
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,080
This is my sexy voice.

3184
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,560
This is how I flirt with all the ladies.

3185
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,420
Thoughts?

3186
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:34,920
Out of 10?

3187
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:35,080
Oh, wow.

3188
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:35,760
Does it work?

3189
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,480
Did it work?

3190
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:36,920
No, never.

3191
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,360
It's actually never worked once.

3192
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,620
I don't think...

3193
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,360
That's two of us, man.

3194
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:40,560
I think you mean...

3195
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,340
How long have you been trying to use that voice for?

3196
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,200
How many years?

3197
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,700
Yeah, I've been using this voice since 2008.

3198
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,080
Wait.

3199
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:47,920
Oh, wow.

3200
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:48,520
But it sounds...

3201
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:48,920
I love it.

3202
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,500
It sounds great.

3203
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:50,980
Oh, yeah.

3204
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,680
But I heard you singing.

3205
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,840
So I don't know if I trust you.

3206
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,160
You might lose a star.

3207
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:55,920
Oh, my God.

3208
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,240
That was savage, dude.

3209
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:58,460
It sounds just like...

3210
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:58,920
Oh, my God.

3211
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,440
You could do...

3212
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,660
You could find somebody that really likes Barney.

3213
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:03,860
Wait.

3214
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,660
That does sound like Barney.

3215
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:05,880
Yeah.

3216
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,360
It sounds just like Barney.

3217
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,600
It does sound like Barney.

3218
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,400
Yeah.

3219
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,020
I guess Barney's not really sexy these days.

3220
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,900
Oh, no.

3221
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:15,540
What is that?

3222
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:16,320
What is that?

3223
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:16,820
Oh, wait.

3224
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,240
What did you get?

3225
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,100
You just fucked us, man.

3226
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:19,640
Good.

3227
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,060
Good.

3228
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:20,580
What did you do?

3229
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,260
Dude.

3230
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,960
No way he got the thing.

3231
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,440
Are you serious?

3232
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,280
Welcome in, guys.

3233
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:25,460
Welcome in.

3234
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,420
It's over.

3235
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,320
The game's over.

3236
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,240
Welcome in, guys.

3237
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,300
Very good.

3238
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:30,820
Very good.

3239
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:31,940
Oh, shit.

3240
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,260
Let's show that 85 coins.

3241
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:33,720
Very good.

3242
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,340
Oh, thank God.

3243
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,040
He's spreading the wealth.

3244
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:36,680
He's actually GG.

3245
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,360
Yeah.

3246
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,840
He's actually GG.

3247
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,480
Bro, I don't want to play anymore.

3248
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:43,820
I want to go back to my card simulator.

3249
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:44,540
This is awesome.

3250
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,280
Yay!

3251
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,300
We're just sitting piggyback.

3252
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,720
We've got nothing else going on in our lives.

3253
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,040
Chiw and I, I'm glad I did that to you.

3254
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:51,980
Spread the wealth!

3255
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:52,540
Are we married?

3256
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,300
Because you just took half my shit, man.

3257
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,400
Spread the wealth!

3258
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,980
And now, all of a sudden, your name is now ChillBingle.

3259
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,200
You've taken the Bingle lineage.

3260
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,700
Congratulations.

3261
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,600
I don't want to be Bingle.

3262
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,520
Dude, I lost everything now.

3263
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:05,980
Lost everything.

3264
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,640
Guys, we're now known as the Bingles.

3265
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,160
Welcome in.

3266
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:08,720
Congratulations.

3267
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:09,600
Oh, my God.

3268
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:09,960
Oh, my God.

3269
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:10,480
Conrad.

3270
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,840
What's the point, man?

3271
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,780
What's the point?

3272
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,120
Take my money again.

3273
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,340
I didn't even want it.

3274
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:20,540
There's no way.

3275
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,720
There's actually no way.

3276
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,000
Dude, this is the worst luck I've had in a Mario Party game.

3277
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,420
This is so sad.

3278
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,700
Oh, my God.

3279
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,160
This is actually...

3280
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,040
It's unwinnable.

3281
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,620
It's unwinnable for me.

3282
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:34,720
You got robbed 60 coins.

3283
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,720
Oh, my God.

3284
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,380
It's just...

3285
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,320
It's so bad.

3286
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:38,660
It's so bad.

3287
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:39,580
Sakuno had me coin.

3288
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,460
How many coins did you originally have?

3289
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,740
A hundred something.

3290
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:42,220
He did like a hundred.

3291
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,360
I lost, yeah, around 60 or something.

3292
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:44,980
Oh, he lost even more than 60.

3293
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,120
Something between like 60 to 70 coins.

3294
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:47,320
Guys, I want to...

3295
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:47,960
I want to...

3296
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:48,940
He's in mourning, dude.

3297
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,200
He's in mourning.

3298
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,660
This is the voice he started when...

3299
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,580
Before he crashed out.

3300
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,300
So, there's a world.

3301
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,160
There's a world.

3302
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:53,720
Oh, my God.

3303
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,020
We get it again.

3304
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,060
Dude, this is the worst luck I've ever seen.

3305
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,400
I mean, this is just...

3306
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,520
Guys, I had 20 coins going in.

3307
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,200
It's certified bullshit.

3308
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,480
It's certified.

3309
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:01,900
It is.

3310
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,520
Call it out.

3311
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,220
Call it out.

3312
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,480
Let him know.

3313
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:03,980
Let him know.

3314
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,320
I'm going to let...

3315
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:13,680
Are you going to be totally a copy of Mario Party?

3316
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,940
A Mario Party covered in strawberries disc to teach it a lesson for giving me bad luck.

3317
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,260
Chill, do you ever like take...

3318
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,480
Do you ever take him on walks?

3319
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:22,980
Like out?

3320
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:23,460
Yeah, we do.

3321
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,060
And I'll put him in like a little red...

3322
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,140
Oh, that's so cute.

3323
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:26,500
A red wagon.

3324
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,760
And I'll pull him around in a red wagon.

3325
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:29,600
That's so cute.

3326
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,080
That's so cute.

3327
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,440
Oh, my God.

3328
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,940
I will say, anything that's green, he'll eat.

3329
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,300
So, my wife, she painted her nails green once.

3330
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,020
And he went for the nails.

3331
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:38,720
Oh, my God.

3332
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,420
Wait, does your wife like your Barney voice?

3333
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:40,920
Wait, does your wife like your Barney voice?

3334
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,780
That only rams...

3335
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,220
No, she hates my Barney voice.

3336
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:44,020
Objects.

3337
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:44,920
No, wait.

3338
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,360
I've seen that.

3339
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,180
No, I've also seen that.

3340
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,040
Have you guys seen that?

3341
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:47,580
No.

3342
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,360
Yeah.

3343
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,180
Like this guy will put black tape on his shoe and it rams his shoe.

3344
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:52,620
And it just attacks.

3345
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:52,960
Yeah.

3346
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:54,580
That's so cute.

3347
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,220
It takes the tape off and it doesn't attack.

3348
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:58,720
Oh, okay.

3349
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,020
Wait.

3350
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,300
Oh, that's not cute.

3351
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:00,840
Never mind.

3352
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,240
Never mind.

3353
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,460
Now that you said that, it's not...

3354
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,840
I didn't think of it like that.

3355
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:08,600
The tortoise is a bear.

3356
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:08,700
The tortoise is a bear.

3357
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,380
Yeah, tortoise.

3358
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,060
Oh, my God.

3359
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,100
What do you mean?

3360
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:11,240
Wait.

3361
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,420
Do you mean ram as in like it fucks it?

3362
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,220
Or do you mean it...

3363
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:14,720
What?

3364
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,200
It attacks.

3365
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:15,780
No.

3366
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,200
No.

3367
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,360
It just rams it regularly.

3368
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,480
It just headbutts it.

3369
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,480
Like, you know, headbutts.

3370
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,160
Wait.

3371
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,440
Are you ever gonna get Tortolini a girlfriend?

3372
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,500
Oh, my God.

3373
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:26,760
No.

3374
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3375
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:28,280
Why not?

3376
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,500
I think he's taking the path of like priesthood.

3377
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,000
He's gonna be celibate, you know.

3378
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:33,340
Why?

3379
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,500
Is he gonna be alone forever?

3380
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,160
You're good.

3381
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:35,540
One year.

3382
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,000
Same.

3383
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,560
Same.

3384
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,180
I gotta send you the picture.

3385
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:38,680
I should.

3386
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:44,780
I showed him two turtles humping on my phone and I showed him that and he was just staring at it like, what?

3387
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,020
That is crazy.

3388
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:45,080
What?

3389
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,620
So he's gonna be like a hundred plus year old virgin because you won't give him a girlfriend?

3390
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:51,820
Yeah.

3391
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,160
But he's gonna turn into like Captain America.

3392
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,280
Wasn't Captain America a hundred year old virgin and he got superpowers?

3393
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:56,120
He did.

3394
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,440
And maybe that's...

3395
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,520
He's gonna be the Grand Wizard.

3396
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,020
That's his secret.

3397
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,540
That's Tortolini's origin story, dude.

3398
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,300
That's how he gets juiced up.

3399
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:04,780
Okay, guys.

3400
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:04,840
Dude.

3401
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,940
I'm against chilled.

3402
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:06,880
He has no delay.

3403
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,680
He has no delay.

3404
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,980
He's crazy, bro.

3405
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,980
I'm lagging so bad.

3406
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,280
I can't even play the game.

3407
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:15,680
That's right.

3408
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,840
Dude, they already have ten.

3409
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:18,760
Okay.

3410
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,600
When you guys on the top right, how many...

3411
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,940
Do you have like the blue bars?

3412
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:22,940
I have blue bars.

3413
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,360
I have blue bars, too.

3414
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,060
What do you guys have?

3415
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:25,140
Okay.

3416
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:25,660
You got blue bars.

3417
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:25,860
Okay.

3418
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:26,740
I think I have bars.

3419
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,460
You don't have...

3420
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,340
I'm using Wi-Fi.

3421
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:29,980
How do you not have...

3422
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:30,940
You don't have any bars.

3423
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,160
I have Wi-Fi.

3424
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,700
I have four blue bars up there.

3425
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,660
I have four, too.

3426
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,280
I have blue bars.

3427
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,420
It's next to your name.

3428
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:37,740
I have blue bars.

3429
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,040
It's in the corner.

3430
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,000
Yeah.

3431
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,340
Look bottom left now, next to your name.

3432
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:42,320
But I also...

3433
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,040
But I also...

3434
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,040
I got some blue bars.

3435
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,220
Oh, it's because I'm hoaxed here.

3436
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,580
But the delay for me is because of my capture card, not the...

3437
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:48,420
Oh, wait.

3438
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,980
You're playing via your capture card?

3439
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:50,900
Yeah.

3440
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,160
I'm playing through a capture card.

3441
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,700
So there's like a full second of delay.

3442
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:54,340
Yeah.

3443
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:54,880
I play like...

3444
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,900
I use like a...

3445
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,180
Oh, yeah.

3446
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:56,600
I use like a...

3447
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,200
I mean, that's not even the problem, though.

3448
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,760
The real problem is I just lost like 70 coins almost.

3449
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,720
I don't think like the delay is really what got me.

3450
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,320
I think the game, it just wasn't going to let me win no matter what.

3451
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,620
But you can have multiple problems in life.

3452
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,720
You know, like why just stop at one problem?

3453
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,560
I got like four problems at the moment right now.

3454
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,160
I mean, the delay sucks too.

3455
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,440
But yeah, like those 70 coins, that's going to be hitting me harder, I think.

3456
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3457
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,400
Hey, maybe the star will move closer to you now.

3458
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:23,440
Maybe...

3459
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,160
I didn't want it to.

3460
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,440
I don't want to see how bad my luck is yet.

3461
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,100
Guys, we have a common enemy and it's Doki.

3462
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,520
No, no, no.

3463
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,280
I'm just chilling.

3464
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,460
Gang up on Elm.

3465
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,040
Don't forget what he did to you.

3466
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:33,400
Yeah, yeah.

3467
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,540
Don't forget the common enemy.

3468
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,780
Don't forget he was the one that triggered the Bowser that spread the wealth.

3469
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,100
Guys, he's British.

3470
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,840
So we're targeting the British.

3471
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,060
He's British.

3472
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:40,480
That's true.

3473
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,680
Canadians and Americans got to work together against the British.

3474
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,220
I'm the token British guy of the group.

3475
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:47,900
You can't do that.

3476
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,320
It's because you are the token British guy that we have to.

3477
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,620
We're just you, but you know, like American version.

3478
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,300
So it's the same.

3479
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:58,880
Yeah, like better.

3480
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:03,660
I'm an honorary American.

3481
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:04,980
You know, I can totally...

3482
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,460
If you're an honorary American, burn your British passport right now.

3483
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,280
Okay.

3484
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:09,640
Hang on.

3485
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,380
If she gets a star, we just quit.

3486
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,440
W aura type shit.

3487
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:12,700
Okay.

3488
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,120
I mean...

3489
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,680
Free $10 for first place.

3490
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,280
Yay!

3491
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:18,460
Okay.

3492
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:18,880
Let me...

3493
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,600
Wait.

3494
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,620
How close was the star to whoever that was in front of?

3495
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,440
It's close.

3496
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,360
It's very close to Doki.

3497
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,160
She's going to get it.

3498
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,640
This is upsetting.

3499
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,260
It's pretty wild, man.

3500
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,240
It's pretty wild.

3501
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:33,960
Let me just buy that Chomko.

3502
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,520
Let me just get that Chomko in advance.

3503
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,160
Just in case.

3504
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:36,580
Just in case.

3505
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:36,960
Just in case.

3506
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,040
Just in case.

3507
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,260
Just in case.

3508
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:38,020
Just in case.

3509
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:38,640
Just in case.

3510
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:38,900
I mean, we're still at turn 11, okay?

3511
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,500
You want to peak at turn 24 because you have 14 turns of potential downfall.

3512
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:42,540
Yeah.

3513
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:42,660
Yeah.

3514
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:43,120
Exactly.

3515
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:43,700
Exactly.

3516
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,400
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

3517
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,940
It's all about the end game, guys.

3518
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,340
Guys, it's not about now, it's about the end game.

3519
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:54,040
I'm just edging for 24 turns and then I'm gonna come around and I'm gonna score big at the end.

3520
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,860
I don't know, I didn't mean it.

3521
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,060
Can I show you the turn of the 20?

3522
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,240
We're still on turn 11.

3523
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:01,820
Oh my god!

3524
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,640
I don't know if you can reduce the turns.

3525
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:08,140
It's just funny because 25 doesn't even give you extra bonus stars.

3526
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,040
20 gives you 2, 30 gives you 3.

3527
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,340
So you've picked the middle which does absolutely nothing.

3528
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,140
Wait, so we don't even have bonus stars?

3529
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,220
We're just going straight in?

3530
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:15,560
Can I try?

3531
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:18,520
He's trying to rip the game.

3532
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,100
We don't even add turns.

3533
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,640
Add 30 just so we can have bonus stars.

3534
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,460
We'll still get 2 bonus stars, we just won't get a third one.

3535
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,280
Oh, we don't get a third.

3536
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:28,820
Oh, okay.

3537
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,500
38 to the star.

3538
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,260
I need to go to the bathroom, I'll be right back.

3539
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,460
Which means guys, when he's gone, we can now walk on our strategy.

3540
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,360
Okay, I think he's gone now.

3541
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:45,560
We're gonna keep going.

3542
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,300
We're gonna keep going and then we gotta make it fast so we can get to the minigame.

3543
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:49,580
Then we grief him, guys.

3544
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,320
We grief him.

3545
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,980
Wait, no, but he can't start the minigame.

3546
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:52,480
We have...

3547
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,720
This is free coinage, guys.

3548
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,120
Oh, damn, you're right.

3549
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:54,860
We do have minigame now.

3550
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:55,540
Free coinage.

3551
01:28:56,180 --> 01:29:00,160
Okay, but what if we use the cursed dice on him and he doesn't even know?

3552
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,060
You know, what if we...

3553
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,160
Dude, you can steal stars from him.

3554
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,040
You can steal money from him.

3555
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:03,800
You can steal anything from him right now.

3556
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,520
I can steal a little bit of cash.

3557
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,280
I can steal some cash.

3558
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,020
Just a little bit.

3559
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,100
Just a little bit of cash.

3560
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:07,880
But I need to be nighttime.

3561
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,880
You guys gotta make it nighttime for me because I can't still turn the day.

3562
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,100
Don't worry.

3563
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,100
I'll make it nighttime for you.

3564
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:11,520
Just for you.

3565
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,080
Oh, wait.

3566
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:12,640
Hey, guys.

3567
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:12,880
Lucky Space.

3568
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,140
Oh, that's fine.

3569
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:13,400
That's fine.

3570
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,000
We can make it happen.

3571
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:14,320
We can make it happen.

3572
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,160
Lucky Space.

3573
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:16,260
Lucky Space.

3574
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:17,880
You get chomp call.

3575
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,640
And then like...

3576
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:18,740
Oh, yeah.

3577
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,360
$15, you dudes.

3578
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:21,760
$15 is pretty good.

3579
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,780
This is almost as good luck as Transformers.

3580
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,160
Good luck.

3581
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:25,260
God, I love Transformers.

3582
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,120
Me too.

3583
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:30,620
Dude, I watched the last Transformers film on the plane with the gorilla and I was so confused.

3584
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,340
The gorilla?

3585
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:31,700
Oh, Beast Wars?

3586
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:34,320
I thought that was just dog shit.

3587
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,460
Dude, I was so confused.

3588
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,160
I was like, why is King Kong robotic?

3589
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,240
Because I thought you were talking about the newest one with Transformers 1.

3590
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:43,460
Yeah.

3591
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:43,800
Yeah.

3592
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,360
Transformers 1.

3593
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:44,780
I thought that was pretty good.

3594
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,600
That one was really good.

3595
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,480
Yeah.

3596
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:47,600
How do we do this one?

3597
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,740
Are you a Transformers fan, Doki?

3598
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:49,260
Yeah.

3599
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:49,500
Yeah.

3600
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,020
You even read the comics too.

3601
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,440
Oh, nice.

3602
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,520
But like...

3603
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:53,840
Yeah.

3604
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,260
You're not into...

3605
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:56,940
You're into Transformers.

3606
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,280
You're not into Transformers, right?

3607
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:58,860
What does that...

3608
01:29:58,860 --> 01:29:59,700
What do you mean?

3609
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:00,720
It's like you want to...

3610
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,520
Like I mean, you don't...

3611
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,460
You're trying to...

3612
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:03,860
Wait.

3613
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,720
You're trying to fuck a Transformer?

3614
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:07,480
I would never fuck a Transformer.

3615
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:07,680
Wait.

3616
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,140
Unless, of course, the Transformer wants to fuck me.

3617
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:10,140
But I'm just saying.

3618
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:10,460
I...

3619
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,160
Oh, so you're cool with that.

3620
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,000
You're cool with that.

3621
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,160
Wait.

3622
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:14,400
Wait.

3623
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:14,580
Wait.

3624
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:14,720
Wait.

3625
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,040
Hold on.

3626
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:15,400
I'm just...

3627
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,400
I mean, I'm very...

3628
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,520
Like, if you're cool with that, like, you know, I won't judge you.

3629
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,040
You know?

3630
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,280
I won't judge you for it.

3631
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:21,820
Bro, I love Lola Bunny.

3632
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,320
I'll say it.

3633
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:22,800
I'll say it.

3634
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,100
I'll say it's great to be in my space.

3635
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,120
Yeah, but that's not a robot.

3636
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:30,080
I had a friend called Rain...

3637
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:30,300
Oh, wait.

3638
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:30,900
You know Rain Doki.

3639
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:35,040
She is in a complete obsession with trying to sleep with Garfield the cat.

3640
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,600
I don't think that she should.

3641
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,360
I think that's bestiality.

3642
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,160
I think that's against the rules.

3643
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,740
I think that's...

3644
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,800
Yeah, I think that's against, like, any law.

3645
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,020
She did...

3646
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,480
She did the most fuckable cartoon characters.

3647
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,720
Her number one instinct was Garfield.

3648
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:50,300
Oh, no.

3649
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:51,580
Her instinct was Garfield.

3650
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:51,780
Oh, no.

3651
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,180
Does she own a cat?

3652
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:55,760
Dude, I...

3653
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:55,820
Die...

3654
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:58,840
Dude.

3655
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,840
I invited her to my coffee...

3656
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,040
All right, Doki.

3657
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,940
So, you know, let's judge the people, Doki.

3658
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,700
Which transformers?

3659
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,380
Transformers, Doki.

3660
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:05,400
Oh.

3661
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,920
I think Starscream is my favorite.

3662
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,300
Yeah, okay.

3663
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,240
Wait.

3664
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,000
Can I bring up a list of transformers?

3665
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:12,420
Wait.

3666
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:12,780
Transformers...

3667
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,900
You don't even know the transfor...

3668
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,660
Are you a Decepticon or an Autobot?

3669
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:16,940
I'm a Decepticon.

3670
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:16,960
I'm a Decepticon.

3671
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,000
I'm a Mark Wahlberg, whatever he was.

3672
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,240
Mark...

3673
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,980
Oh, so you're a movies Transformers fan?

3674
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,140
I kind of am.

3675
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:24,160
I'm a...

3676
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:26,680
You're not even a real Transformers fan!

3677
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,740
You're Michael Bayer!

3678
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:30,240
You're Michael Bayer!

3679
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:37,360
I will say there was a toy I had that I really miss.

3680
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,180
I was not going to give you Bumble Deez Nuts.

3681
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,440
I was not going to give it to you.

3682
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:48,980
I was going to take you and ignore and continue on with my Transformers Beast Wars talk where I had a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

3683
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,360
Oh, it's from Burger King or McDonald's?

3684
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,100
I think it's from like KB Toys or something.

3685
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,560
Oh, I thought you meant like the... you know how like there was like those like Transformers...

3686
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,360
Oh, wait, he's back.

3687
01:31:59,500 --> 01:31:59,760
Okay.

3688
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,400
Oh, no, I was not looking.

3689
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,380
No, okay.

3690
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,300
I was definitely...

3691
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,320
Oh, I don't know.

3692
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:05,140
No, I'm fucked.

3693
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:05,680
I don't know.

3694
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,760
I was not looking at the x-rays.

3695
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:12,720
I'm just gonna keep opening.

3696
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,240
Wait, I don't understand.

3697
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:16,780
What do you mean?

3698
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:17,720
It's like Burger King.

3699
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:20,900
I'm not looking at the boxes.

3700
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,440
The TSA griefed me last time I went to America.

3701
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,180
They fucking suck.

3702
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:28,220
Dude, they always give me the extra pat down every single time.

3703
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,180
They pulled me into a separate room.

3704
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,720
I had to... I got like interrogated.

3705
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,220
It was horrible.

3706
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,040
What did you do?

3707
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:35,960
I didn't do anything.

3708
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:36,440
I was just me.

3709
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,160
Oh, yeah, honestly.

3710
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,880
I just said hello.

3711
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:40,560
They're like, get this kid.

3712
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,700
Fucking frisk this guy now.

3713
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,240
Dude, when I went to Comic Con, I brought my Yu-Gi-Oh!

3714
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:45,860
Dex with me.

3715
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,740
And I guess the way they show up on the scanner, they look like just like weird things bunched together.

3716
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,080
So the guy's taking my Yu-Gi-Oh!

3717
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,800
Dex out of my backpack, thumbing through my cards.

3718
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,100
And I got some expensive cards in there.

3719
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,540
And like my ass is clenching.

3720
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:58,980
Oh, dude.

3721
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:05,220
I was gonna mouth off to the TSA, but then you see that sign mouthing off at seven years in prison.

3722
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,100
I'm like, ah, come on!

3723
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:06,420
Wait, what?

3724
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:07,380
Is that true?

3725
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,700
You should have done it.

3726
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,440
You can't say anything to them.

3727
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,880
You say anything to them, you're fucking, you're missing your flight and you're getting in trouble.

3728
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,760
You should have said you had a knife.

3729
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,020
Did you know?

3730
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:18,940
Just say you're going to London.

3731
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:19,720
They'll understand.

3732
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,200
Oh, my God.

3733
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,200
Hey, another chomp call.

3734
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:24,620
Let's go.

3735
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,260
But then like, see, see, they'd be like, oh, my God, you have a knife.

3736
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,680
And they'd forget about your cards.

3737
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,320
They dropped my Yu-Gi-Oh!

3738
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:30,560
cards.

3739
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,900
Yeah, that's true.

3740
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,420
That's true.

3741
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:33,520
They won't damage the Yu-Gi-Oh!

3742
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:33,980
cards.

3743
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:34,880
Yeah, yeah.

3744
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,640
They'll be looking for your knife, not your cards.

3745
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:37,000
Yeah.

3746
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:41,140
And then you'll be like, sorry, I didn't mean to say knife.

3747
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,460
That was just a typo in my brain.

3748
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:45,000
Dude, how does Doki have four stars and I have zero?

3749
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,420
This is wealth inequality.

3750
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,700
It's about turn 20.

3751
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:50,280
What are we, in Los Angeles or something?

3752
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,980
It's about turn 20, Sekuro.

3753
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,580
Turn 20 will be okay.

3754
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:55,820
Jeffrey Bezos.

3755
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,300
This is crazy, I tells ya.

3756
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,400
I'm going to start my Amazon warehouse soon.

3757
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:06,160
Oh, my God.

3758
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,580
I am not pissing in the bottle.

3759
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,780
I am not working for you.

3760
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,140
Hey, look, it's close.

3761
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,060
It's close to LM.

3762
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,500
No, it's close to child.

3763
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,280
Yeah, it's close to child.

3764
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,020
We can finally get one.

3765
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:15,300
I'm back.

3766
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:15,760
I'm back.

3767
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,140
What happened?

3768
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:16,420
What happened?

3769
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:16,860
What I missed?

3770
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:17,440
What did I grab?

3771
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:17,760
What did I grab?

3772
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:18,500
What did I miss?

3773
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,800
I'm going to be on the board soon, don't you worry.

3774
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,860
Wait, I'm the way.

3775
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,320
Wait, Doki.

3776
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,760
Doki, my duo, we can't let this happen, surely.

3777
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:26,680
Surely.

3778
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:29,020
Oh, sorry, but like...

3779
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,040
Okay, let's see.

3780
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:33,980
I'm an ally.

3781
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,380
I pre-game Woman's Month early.

3782
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,200
It's in March.

3783
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,580
I've been pre-gaming since April.

3784
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:41,240
You've been pre-gaming?

3785
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,420
Yeah, I'm pre-gaming.

3786
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:45,440
Always with positive comments like, Doki, you're looking lovely today.

3787
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:46,720
See, I'm pre-gaming Woman's Month.

3788
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,840
I'm doing my part.

3789
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,700
So, like, you wouldn't have just done that normally?

3790
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,960
Oh, wait, yeah, you know what I've done that normally?

3791
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,240
It was ex-opposite.

3792
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,680
Wait a minute, he's only saying that for Woman's Month.

3793
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:58,180
Yeah!

3794
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,620
Oh, my God!

3795
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,360
Wait a minute.

3796
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,500
Is Chill the bad person in general?

3797
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,440
I'm an ally.

3798
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:08,040
Chill hates women confirmed, guys.

3799
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:08,660
You heard it.

3800
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,080
Yeah, Chill hates women.

3801
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,580
Call him The Word.

3802
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,980
There's a sound clip of Chill.

3803
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,060
He's misogynistic.

3804
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,400
He's misogynistic, you sicko.

3805
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,140
Oh, that's a fucking joke.

3806
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,560
Oh, my God!

3807
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:20,640
Oh, my God!

3808
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,340
I guess Chill's not getting that.

3809
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,640
That's for being a woman-hater.

3810
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,360
That's for the women out there, guys.

3811
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,560
That's for the women out there.

3812
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:30,640
I've only pushed a couple of ladies in my life and only kicked one child.

3813
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,740
That's for sounding like Barney every time you try and talk to them.

3814
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,640
I love you.

3815
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,600
That's for having a sexy voice, you sick fuck.

3816
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,580
Dude, who's even near this thing?

3817
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,900
Wait, Ellen's near.

3818
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,500
Yeah, he just needs ten.

3819
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:47,220
I'm doing...

3820
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,960
I'm doing this for women everywhere.

3821
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:50,720
I'm doing this for women everywhere.

3822
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,300
For women?

3823
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:51,440
Shit.

3824
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,560
As a woman,

3825
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:58,980
you shouldn't buy that so I can buy it.

3826
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:00,360
That's why I only got a nine.

3827
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,140
I did that for you, dude.

3828
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,680
Ellen, leave one for me, man.

3829
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,160
Just one star for me.

3830
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:04,500
Oh, yeah.

3831
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,120
Oh, yeah.

3832
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,540
It doesn't matter.

3833
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,480
We just fired you.

3834
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,860
Let me grab this chunk real quick.

3835
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,840
Like, I would just chuck.

3836
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,560
It would.

3837
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:11,880
It would.

3838
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,320
You guys are such gatekeepers.

3839
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,300
You are going to hell.

3840
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,200
You are going to hell.

3841
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,140
I'm going through the gate and they're just pulling up the ladder behind you with these goddamn...

3842
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:20,160
Wait, women?

3843
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:20,480
You're saying women are gatekeepers?

3844
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:21,480
What are you trying to say right now?

3845
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,340
What are you trying to say?

3846
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:22,780
Every single time.

3847
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:24,420
To a woman and a British guy.

3848
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:24,700
You are breaking barriers, woman.

3849
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,580
Pull the ladder up.

3850
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,740
What are you trying to say?

3851
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,200
To a woman and a British guy that we're gatekeepers.

3852
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:30,640
That's crazy.

3853
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:30,680
That's crazy.

3854
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,300
What are you trying to say?

3855
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:32,820
Definitely to the British guy.

3856
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,960
Definitely to the British guy.

3857
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,460
The British guy, yeah.

3858
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,620
Yeah, I was going to say.

3859
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:37,500
Oh, you're right.

3860
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:37,940
Sorry.

3861
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:38,280
Sorry.

3862
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:38,660
You're right.

3863
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,260
No, no.

3864
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,080
You got that there.

3865
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,980
Yeah, we need to gatekeep the British out of here.

3866
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,720
I'm going through this gate.

3867
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:44,740
I'm going through this gate.

3868
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:45,180
I'm in Hala, I remember.

3869
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:45,880
I'm in Hala.

3870
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,200
Oh my god.

3871
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:51,100
Come on in.

3872
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:52,920
Custom item bag.

3873
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:53,420
Item bag.

3874
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:53,880
Item bag.

3875
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:54,000
Item bag.

3876
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,140
Oh, okay.

3877
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:54,460
Nice.

3878
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:54,900
Get chomka.

3879
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:55,940
Get another chomka.

3880
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,720
Here we go.

3881
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,000
Dang it.

3882
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,460
10 coins?

3883
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,540
We're getting that wealth back, man.

3884
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,900
We're getting that wealth back.

3885
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:01,560
Yeah, get that.

3886
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,020
Go get rich.

3887
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,100
I need generational wealth so my pet penguin can survive.

3888
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,660
Are you allowed to get a pet hyrax?

3889
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,080
What the fuck is a hyrax?

3890
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:11,960
Sounds like a hyrax.

3891
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,520
Dude, hyraxes are all the rage.

3892
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,380
They're the coolest new animal on the block.

3893
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,280
What are they?

3894
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:17,860
A hyrax?

3895
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,200
They're crazy looking, dude.

3896
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,080
Let me send you a picture.

3897
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,600
Oh, he showed me this before.

3898
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:23,280
They actually do look good.

3899
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:23,720
Is this a new animal?

3900
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:25,760
They're not new.

3901
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,680
Did you know they're related to elephants?

3902
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:28,720
No.

3903
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,780
A hyrax?

3904
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:30,820
I want to be honest.

3905
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,540
I thought he was going to...

3906
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,840
When he said elephant, I was like, this motherfucker says me.

3907
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,420
I'm going to kill him.

3908
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,460
What the fuck is that?

3909
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,760
Dude, look at how mischievous they look, dude.

3910
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:39,620
These are the greatest.

3911
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:40,840
They're cute as hell.

3912
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,240
Oh my god.

3913
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:41,960
That thing is so cute.

3914
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:42,680
He doesn't pay his taxes.

3915
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,300
Look at that.

3916
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,400
That thing is on the run from the IRS for sure.

3917
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,700
It's on the run from the IRS 100%.

3918
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,480
I'm putting this back in the game, okay?

3919
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,920
I'm going to try and get the full-on swap for us, man.

3920
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,360
I'm pretty sure you can't...

3921
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:57,780
Wait, are they...

3922
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:01,180
If they're not endangered, I'm pretty sure you can technically own it.

3923
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,180
It's just like, you know, morality's sake, you know?

3924
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,520
Morality's sake, you shouldn't own Exile.

3925
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:10,240
You got to be Doki or Elem on life and life.

3926
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:10,900
And chill.

3927
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,480
Remember all the times we played games together?

3928
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:13,320
Were you?

3929
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,380
There's no point trading anything with me.

3930
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,180
Nothing's really going to change, you know?

3931
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:18,880
I got to focus.

3932
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,460
I got to focus.

3933
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,300
That's a 30-point...

3934
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:20,660
This is what it had.

3935
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:21,760
Shields in a choke.

3936
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:22,240
Shields in a choke.

3937
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:22,740
He's in a choke.

3938
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,080
Trust me.

3939
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,200
He's in a choke.

3940
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,340
He's in a choke.

3941
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:26,940
They call him choke chaos.

3942
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:27,500
Choke chaos.

3943
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:27,820
Here we go.

3944
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,260
Darswap 20 double swap.

3945
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,500
Choke chaos.

3946
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,580
Darswap 20 double star.

3947
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:33,480
Choke chaos.

3948
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,160
Yes!

3949
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:35,580
No.

3950
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,160
No.

3951
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,560
No.

3952
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:37,000
No.

3953
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,360
No.

3954
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:37,860
No.

3955
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,180
We're defending.

3956
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:39,420
We're taking one.

3957
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:39,580
Oh no.

3958
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,060
No.

3959
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:41,300
We're two.

3960
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,260
We're two.

3961
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:46,260
Okay, I hope he chooses me.

3962
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:47,200
Because I'm gonna pick...

3963
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:47,600
Oh!

3964
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,100
Oh my.

3965
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,140
Wow.

3966
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:49,820
Wow.

3967
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,340
And that just takes the entire game away from me.

3968
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:53,460
Choke.

3969
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:53,480
Choke.

3970
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,780
This is what happens when you...

3971
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,440
The whole game.

3972
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,880
Oh my gosh.

3973
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:00,580
This changes everything.

3974
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,740
Oh, it feels so good.

3975
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:03,900
It feels so good, Elem.

3976
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,620
It feels so good.

3977
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,780
Everything I grind is full.

3978
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:06,780
Everything I grind is full.

3979
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,840
Everything I grind is full.

3980
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,080
Hey, can we get a Bowser Revolution?

3981
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,360
Can we get a Bowser Revolution?

3982
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,240
Oh my god!

3983
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:23,460
I want you to know, Chilled, I'm gonna go out of my way to get 150 coins and steal everything from you.

3984
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,280
You gotta get to the right area and land right there.

3985
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:30,960
I will do everything in my power to make sure you don't win.

3986
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,560
I just want to lay out a blueprint for you.

3987
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,100
Wait, how do I do this?

3988
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,760
It's your turn, Sykkuno.

3989
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,260
Your turn to steal from someone else.

3990
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,380
This is my shot I've never lost.

3991
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:44,200
Anything you give to Sykkuno, I will also steal from him.

3992
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,320
No!

3993
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,620
Oh shit.

3994
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,240
Oh, you guys are trying so hard!

3995
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:55,020
Look at you guys go!

3996
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:00,160
This is a 10 years of fucking...

3997
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,880
10 years of biopart right there!

3998
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,900
Wait, but if I win, Elm gets money!

3999
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,700
Think about the greater good!

4000
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:07,300
Yes!

4001
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,220
10 years of biopart probably doesn't help you.

4002
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,120
Hey, at least we lived, you know?

4003
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:14,900
They picked us up.

4004
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:19,140
At least you have, like, you know, Elm stars.

4005
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,320
You're almost as bad of a spot as Elm.

4006
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:25,140
You just made me beat the shit out of my chair and now the Elm's hanging off.

4007
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,300
Hey, second place has never felt so good.

4008
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:28,560
Okay?

4009
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,840
Oh my god.

4010
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:32,520
Okay.

4011
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,240
Yeah, it is.

4012
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,420
It's looking real grim out here.

4013
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,220
Oh god.

4014
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:40,980
No way you're chomp calling right now.

4015
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,180
This is...

4016
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:45,220
Diabololica.

4017
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:46,440
What?

4018
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,900
The only one who's closest to it was...

4019
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:53,560
You're not even close to that star, Saikudo!

4020
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:55,160
I don't know.

4021
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,500
I'm tilted and lashing out at anybody.

4022
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:00,920
You're fighting for the people now.

4023
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,520
You're here for the people.

4024
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,720
Saik, me and you, we're the same right now.

4025
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,360
So maybe we should unite as a duo.

4026
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,020
You know?

4027
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:07,480
Hear me out.

4028
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,400
Alright, give me half your money and we'll call it a deal.

4029
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,680
Give me half of your money and then invest in me early.

4030
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,080
You know?

4031
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,040
You should invest... the US stock market's better.

4032
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,020
Yeah.

4033
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:18,720
That's true.

4034
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,100
We're doing pretty good right now, I think.

4035
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:23,440
No, but the British pound is still higher than the US currency.

4036
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,020
Yeah, but that's because it's backed by the monarchy.

4037
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:27,700
It doesn't really count.

4038
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:29,660
That's true.

4039
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,400
That's true.

4040
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,200
Alright, guys.

4041
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,760
Did you crash the game?

4042
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,980
Did you crash?

4043
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,300
I didn't.

4044
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:38,440
No.

4045
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,340
He mauled it and crashed the game.

4046
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,720
He fucking did!

4047
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:42,840
He crashed the game!

4048
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,940
No, Saik disconnected.

4049
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:45,900
Saik disconnected.

4050
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,320
You disconnected!

4051
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:51,220
Yeah, we can get you back in.

4052
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:51,720
We can reset.

4053
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,700
Dude, you crashed us so hard.

4054
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,900
Oh my god!

4055
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:58,640
What's happening?

4056
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,380
Yeah, he could just rejoin.

4057
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:02,740
Yeah, you just have to re-invite him.

4058
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,380
No, I think you just straight up join.

4059
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,300
Oh, okay.

4060
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:09,100
Yeah, it's fine.

4061
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,780
You can do the moves while we wait for him.

4062
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,260
I'm gonna steam my voice real quick while we wait.

4063
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,100
We gotta watch this dice roll while you steam this voice.

4064
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,640
Oh my god.

4065
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,600
We're all getting dizzy staring at this.

4066
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,640
Let me hear you one of those.

4067
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,160
I still can't believe you actually got the swap.

4068
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,320
That's actually fucking crazy.

4069
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,180
You honestly chilled?

4070
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:31,520
Yeah, that was an insane swap.

4071
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:34,980
You think I'm done?

4072
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,840
I'm going up even more.

4073
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:37,620
Whoa!

4074
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,120
He's mad with power!

4075
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:44,320
Can I go this way?

4076
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,580
Can I go this way?

4077
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:46,740
I was your fan.

4078
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,420
I was your fan and I still am.

4079
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,380
Chilled, come on.

4080
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,080
You're such a fan.

4081
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,940
When did the creatures kick me out?

4082
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,020
When was it?

4083
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:00,420
I would not remember that because that was a dark time for all of us.

4084
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,060
So I choose not to remember that.

4085
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:04,380
Yeah, I locked that out.

4086
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:05,800
That's a true fan.

4087
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,480
That's a true fan.

4088
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,300
Okay, but...

4089
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:12,480
I'm rejoining.

4090
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,280
It says rejoining, please wait there.

4091
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,180
Oh, we have some bad news for you.

4092
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,040
Your character just landed on Bowser.

4093
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,680
Yeah, you got a thousand coins, Sykkuno!

4094
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:25,240
Dude, dude, I'm telling you the NPC always gets me, bro.

4095
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:30,000
No, actually this is pretty good because you can actually go and do the stealing.

4096
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:32,020
Yeah, you're close to the swap.

4097
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,260
Yeah.

4098
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,040
Yeah, you're literally at the swap area.

4099
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,380
You need to get a four for swap.

4100
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,700
Maybe we can curse you.

4101
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,860
It should reconnect after the minigame.

4102
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:44,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4103
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,960
It has to play through one, which is stupid.

4104
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:49,020
Nintendo almost got the online right.

4105
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:49,520
They were close.

4106
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,020
I don't think they ever will.

4107
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,100
I'm hoping...

4108
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,260
Maybe the Switch 2?

4109
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:56,120
You know, maybe?

4110
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,420
Elem, in case...

4111
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:02,240
I mean, you were asking for it.

4112
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:04,360
The stores have been, you said, juiced up?

4113
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,300
Is that what the terminology you're using?

4114
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:07,280
Wait, what does that mean?

4115
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,180
I don't know, he said it earlier.

4116
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,680
Like, they got better stuff now.

4117
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:11,460
They got different stuff.

4118
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,840
Oh yeah, because it's like halfway point.

4119
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:14,920
Yeah.

4120
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:20,320
Oh, because we're still doing minigame now.

4121
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,080
You're about to do the minigame.

4122
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,200
You should be good after this.

4123
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,780
You're the 1v3.

4124
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:27,400
You're the one.

4125
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:28,780
You got this.

4126
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,260
Just look away.

4127
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:30,180
There's no way you can lose.

4128
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:32,440
Yeah, there's no way NPC you could lose, Sakuno.

4129
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,240
Wait, am I...

4130
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,140
Do I just have to wait till the next game, I guess?

4131
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,280
Yeah, I think so.

4132
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,800
Okay, okay, that's fine.

4133
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,260
I'll chill here.

4134
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,200
Wait, what if Rosalina never readies up?

4135
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:44,720
Wait...

4136
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,000
No, I think we need...

4137
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,440
No, we need Elem to readies, so then it would...

4138
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:49,240
...

4139
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,540
Yeah, we just need...

4140
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,440
Give Elem a British ping.

4141
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,800
It might take like 2 minutes before he hears our pleas.

4142
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,300
Elem, please.

4143
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:56,860
Elem!

4144
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,240
Elem, he's not even deafened.

4145
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,800
He's just steaming his voice out of the room.

4146
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:02,900
Elem!

4147
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,080
Elem, please.

4148
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,660
Can't believe I got Donalewald by Elem.

4149
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,100
He's not even there to appreciate it, too.

4150
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:14,880
He'll never know.

4151
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,080
So what's he doing?

4152
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,520
He's just huffing vapor right now?

4153
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,800
Like, is that what he's doing?

4154
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:20,760
So, yeah.

4155
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,400
Yeah, that's how you fix your throat.

4156
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:24,540
It's just steam.

4157
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,500
Oh, well good.

4158
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,540
At least he's being healthy.

4159
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:30,040
Wait, if I fuck up, do we all fuck up?

4160
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:32,960
No, no, no, no, no.

4161
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,400
We all get one fuck up.

4162
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,360
We're all entitled to one fuck up.

4163
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:35,840
Oh, okay.

4164
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:37,400
So that's good.

4165
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,400
So I can fuck up for all of a sudden, but it won't matter.

4166
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,100
Does anyone know where Elem lives?

4167
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,940
Can somebody go over there right now?

4168
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:49,140
He's from the UK, I think.

4169
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:51,640
Brethren, sorry, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

4170
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:52,460
Wow.

4171
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,420
You sound worse.

4172
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,220
What happened?

4173
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:57,040
I was just steaming my voice.

4174
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,860
How do you sound worse?

4175
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:01,240
Yeah.

4176
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:04,780
Wait, what did I go?

4177
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,440
Oh, I did it right.

4178
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:07,560
We're all good, we're all good.

4179
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:08,880
We get a point.

4180
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:10,980
I'm going left, I'm going left.

4181
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:12,040
I'm going up.

4182
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:15,380
I got it, I got it.

4183
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:15,600
Oh!

4184
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,040
Yes.

4185
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,360
We're good, we're good, we're good.

4186
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:26,580
We're winning.

4187
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,560
You're also part of our team.

4188
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:31,300
Yeah, you're a part of my team.

4189
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,620
I'm so glad I can see everything that's happening.

4190
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,460
Where are you going?

4191
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:42,900
No, they got me.

4192
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:43,700
How's my bot doing?

4193
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:45,780
He's out of the wire.

4194
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,360
Yeah, yeah, we won!

4195
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,360
We did it!

4196
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,220
We lost or we won?

4197
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:51,800
We won!

4198
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:56,740
Dude, the AI always throws it, I swear.

4199
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,680
It always throws it.

4200
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:02,920
Alright, you should be back now.

4201
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,760
Yay, we're joining.

4202
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,180
Oh, here he comes, here he comes.

4203
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:07,880
Oh, okay, it's joining, it's joining.

4204
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,420
It's time.

4205
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:13,000
Oh my god, we still have...

4206
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,120
We're only halfway there.

4207
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:16,040
Oh, there we go.

4208
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,140
He's just waiting.

4209
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:17,140
He's just connecting.

4210
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,040
Yeah, I like the little drum beat that they got.

4211
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,120
When they said drum roll, I didn't know how long they were gonna go for.

4212
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:28,600
It's like the...

4213
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,920
The Simpsons intro with the couch gag.

4214
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:34,600
They just play the same three notes over and over again until the gag is over.

4215
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:37,460
Why did I do 25 turns, dude?

4216
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:38,260
What's wrong with me?

4217
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,340
I don't know, you went...

4218
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,540
That was a lot of turns.

4219
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,720
It said 75...

4220
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,620
It said 75 minutes.

4221
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:45,960
I was like, oh, that'll be fine.

4222
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:51,120
No, no, the estimate time is always less than what it actually is.

4223
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:52,460
Wait, really?

4224
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:55,060
Oh, hey, they gave me another chop call!

4225
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:55,480
They know!

4226
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,300
They know it's my favorite!

4227
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,440
Why?

4228
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:03,660
Okay, surely, surely...

4229
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:05,140
Big roll, big roll.

4230
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,480
Not a six, dude.

4231
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,780
That's pretty... pretty big.

4232
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,600
What am I gonna buy?

4233
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:11,580
What do they have?

4234
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:14,060
The custom dice block so you can go back to chance time and hurt us.

4235
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,480
Oh, there's a warp block!

4236
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:18,960
The custom dice block would be the best strat.

4237
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:19,280
Why?

4238
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,140
It's open.

4239
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:24,380
When you got zero dollars, yeah, you gotta go and try and swap your money with someone else.

4240
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:26,340
I'm gonna take more than their money.

4241
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,400
I'm coming for everything.

4242
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,400
Everything.

4243
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,480
I'm coming for everything.

4244
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:36,400
You know, I'm gonna stop getting stars now because, like, it's not worth it.

4245
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:36,740
It really is.

4246
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,100
You can buy a hundred and fifty to steal two stars.

4247
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:40,860
It's just not worth it.

4248
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:41,340
Go chance time.

4249
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,420
Oh, you didn't get it.

4250
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:43,760
You had to get four.

4251
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,380
Oh, but you can steal stars.

4252
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:46,880
You can steal cash.

4253
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:49,200
Yeah, for free.

4254
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:50,480
Like, forty-five dollars for free?

4255
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,500
I mean, with ten more turns, like, there's so much time.

4256
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,180
There's actually a glitch.

4257
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,340
The more you press A, the less money you get.

4258
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,560
Even when I spam this, it doesn't do anything.

4259
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:06,320
It doesn't matter.

4260
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:06,960
It doesn't, yeah.

4261
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:10,320
I just wouldn't push it for science.

4262
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:12,260
I'm gonna go halfway.

4263
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,440
I feel like that's accountable.

4264
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,220
Just don't push it and see what happens, you know?

4265
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,460
Dude, I still lose fourteen coins.

4266
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,000
Did you guys go all the way?

4267
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,760
I went halfway.

4268
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,140
I went halfway as well.

4269
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:22,840
Okay.

4270
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,140
I was not reading it.

4271
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,500
I didn't realize I had to mash.

4272
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:28,940
I was like, what are they talking about?

4273
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,980
I was like, oh, I'm supposed to mash.

4274
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,760
Dude, no way I'm on the Bowser spot.

4275
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,160
Wait, are you on the Bowser spot?

4276
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:36,900
Revolution!

4277
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:37,320
Revolution!

4278
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,320
Dude, I needed those coins.

4279
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,280
You got sixty-seven coins back.

4280
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,120
That's what they took from you last time.

4281
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:44,620
Yeah!

4282
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:46,000
You got paid.

4283
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,220
You got your tax returns.

4284
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,580
This is why you should do your taxes.

4285
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,580
You can get your tax returns.

4286
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:54,260
You need double dice.

4287
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:55,040
You might be able to.

4288
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,500
I just need a seventeen.

4289
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:58,740
It's so doable.

4290
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,660
It's so believable!

4291
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,720
Holy dude, it's so doable.

4292
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:07,600
I mean, that ten was good.

4293
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,820
That was brutal.

4294
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:09,880
That would have been...

4295
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,960
What do you mean?

4296
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,340
You're coming in to ruin my life points, man.

4297
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,260
What do you mean?

4298
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,660
I would never do such a thing.

4299
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,920
You should buy that triple dice, though, that maybe you could have caught the star.

4300
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,320
I don't want to hear her anymore.

4301
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,600
Hey, look, you bought the triple dice!

4302
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:31,680
It's huge!

4303
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,160
It's huge!

4304
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,620
Do I just go this way?

4305
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:37,560
Yeah, fuck it.

4306
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,800
You're not even going to get the star?

4307
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,700
No, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.

4308
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,480
Then I don't need to use my chop calls.

4309
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,820
At least I don't have to waste it.

4310
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:49,840
I have a plan.

4311
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:50,760
I don't understand.

4312
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:51,780
I have a plan.

4313
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:54,260
It makes so much sense.

4314
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:54,880
I can see it.

4315
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,540
Oh, shit.

4316
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:59,740
Don't worry, I'm never going to get to a star as long as I can't chop sixes.

4317
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,140
There's like three chop calls out there.

4318
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:02,640
Why is it always against me, dude?

4319
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,040
Why is it against me?

4320
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,240
You know, you should have just went for the star, so I would have used the chop call.

4321
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,260
You got a massive advantage on river raiders.

4322
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,340
It's so good for the one.

4323
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,820
Yeah, but how does it work?

4324
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:14,660
What do I do?

4325
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,700
You gotta take us away from the coins.

4326
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,240
I just gotta drag you away from...

4327
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,200
But I'm so slow.

4328
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,000
Like, how do I speed up?

4329
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:24,400
You don't.

4330
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,940
You bought the more expensive shell.

4331
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:26,600
I don't know.

4332
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,860
You should have just invested on a better boat.

4333
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,960
What model of shell is this, dude?

4334
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,020
This thing is slow as heck.

4335
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,000
I can't even see Rosalina's shell.

4336
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:35,840
It's just hilarious.

4337
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:36,900
I've never realized it before.

4338
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,080
Wait, what if I run you guys into the tree?

4339
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:40,800
Yeah, that's why.

4340
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:42,420
Yeah, that's why.

4341
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:43,880
Oh, thanks, dude.

4342
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,260
Thanks.

4343
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:44,620
Thanks.

4344
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,260
Can you guys stop dragging me, please?

4345
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,020
You're being really cringe.

4346
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,620
Thank you so much.

4347
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,100
We're not even dragging you!

4348
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,540
You're controlling the boat!

4349
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,020
Yeah, the cringe is in now.

4350
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,160
It's mine.

4351
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,140
Oh, that's cringe.

4352
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,000
Yeah, thank you.

4353
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,560
Oh, you did it for us!

4354
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,460
That's so sweet.

4355
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:05,200
Why did I have my friends, you know?

4356
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,600
Yeah, yeah.

4357
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,780
Yeah, because we're the homies, you know?

4358
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:11,520
That's what I'm saying, that's what I'm saying.

4359
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:12,400
Okay, here we go.

4360
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:16,080
You have now officially hit the 155 mark.

4361
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:20,120
If you get the key and the custom dice block, you're in a good position to steal a lot of stars.

4362
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,140
Not that you would ever take from us, because we're friends here.

4363
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:25,420
I would get two stars, because it's not worth it yet.

4364
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:26,400
Yeah.

4365
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,280
You should buy a star.

4366
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,360
You should buy one.

4367
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:30,840
Think about it.

4368
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,540
That would be so funny.

4369
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,900
But I want you to know, Childe, I'm coming back for the stars you stole from me.

4370
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,300
You're gonna take two from me?

4371
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,700
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.

4372
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:42,860
Whoa!

4373
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:42,860
Nothing?

4374
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,520
That's exactly what I started with.

4375
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,720
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.

4376
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,640
He's gonna go back to where he started.

4377
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,100
Oh, hey!

4378
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:52,900
This is what you needed, Childe.

4379
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,140
Oh, come on, world!

4380
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:57,780
16.

4381
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:59,920
Oh, I'm just 16.

4382
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:00,860
Hey!

4383
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,940
Microwave my juice.

4384
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:03,580
I'll be back.

4385
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:07,140
I'm sick.

4386
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,640
I need microwave juice to clear my throat.

4387
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:10,480
Microwave juice?

4388
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,320
Microwave and lemonade mixed with apple juice.

4389
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,520
Custom Dice Block is probably big right here.

4390
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:16,940
That sounds kinda good.

4391
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:17,580
I can't even lie.

4392
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,660
Nah, I'm gonna get a Warp Lock.

4393
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:21,360
I think it's fun here.

4394
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,240
Dude, apple juice and lemonade sounds like it would be kinda crazy.

4395
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,680
Dude, I'll use some microwave apple sauce and eat it by the bowl.

4396
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,300
What?

4397
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,300
By itself?

4398
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:33,580
Yeah, dude, apple sauce by itself goes crazy.

4399
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,040
Yeah, warm apple sauce is real good.

4400
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,420
Why don't you put anything on it?

4401
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:39,320
You don't have to.

4402
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,260
Because I'm British, we don't do seasoning.

4403
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,120
Oh, that's true.

4404
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,060
Yeah, they don't do good flavor.

4405
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:43,820
That's true.

4406
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,200
Dude, when people say seasoning, I'm just adding salt and pepper.

4407
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:48,920
That's all I'm adding.

4408
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:52,800
You should try the Everything Bagel Salt.

4409
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:53,860
It's really good.

4410
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,560
You can put it on anything, like your avocado, your egg.

4411
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,680
Doesn't everything bagel salt?

4412
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:00,100
Yeah, so it's like a seasoning, but it's like everything but the bagel.

4413
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,840
So it's like poppy seeds, sesame seeds, salt.

4414
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,700
That sounds good.

4415
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,560
It does sound good.

4416
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:06,680
It's really good.

4417
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:09,520
You throw it on some avocado or some eggs and you just elevate your sandwich.

4418
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:12,880
Dude, I wish bagels were a thing in the UK.

4419
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:13,500
They're just not.

4420
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:14,500
We just don't have bagels.

4421
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:16,460
Well, we have bagels, but they're just like...

4422
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:18,980
Okay, I will eat bagels just by themselves.

4423
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,320
Oh, that's fair.

4424
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:22,840
Just a raw bagel.

4425
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:23,180
You know?

4426
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,280
A humble, raw bagel.

4427
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,220
Do you mean plain or raw?

4428
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,920
You know, you don't put any like...

4429
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,220
Oh hey, I got another one.

4430
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,720
I can buy a triple dice too.

4431
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:33,560
I shouldn't judge because I call them blank tortillas.

4432
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:34,640
So it's fine.

4433
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:42,400
When I was in LA, whenever I had this thing, I would just eat plain bread in bed.

4434
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,220
So I'm known as a crumb cuddler.

4435
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:44,580
Are you okay?

4436
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:48,180
I feel like the more we learn about your eating habits, the more...

4437
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,780
You're not okay.

4438
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:52,380
I don't think he is.

4439
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:55,160
You're just like really hungry.

4440
01:54:55,400 --> 01:55:00,200
I'll go grab plain pieces of bread, but the bad thing about it is I'll just...

4441
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:03,400
I'll be sat in darkness just eating these slices of bread.

4442
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:04,160
In darkness?

4443
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:05,600
You don't even turn on the light?

4444
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,980
I'll just eat them, but then I'll eat them right...

4445
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,200
I'm like, okay, that's a little snack.

4446
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:09,600
I'll do that.

4447
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:11,240
Then I'll forget that I've eaten them.

4448
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:12,620
So there'll be crumbs on my chest.

4449
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,600
I'll roll over and just roll around in the crumbs.

4450
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:18,320
I've had it where we had a...

4451
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:18,940
Oh my god.

4452
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,200
Okay.

4453
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:26,100
We were in Malibu like seven, eight years ago when I was with Sea Nanners, Vanos, Syndicate, and...

4454
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:28,280
Syndicate and Vanos, I think they went to the Kings game.

4455
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:30,340
So me and Adam, we made dinner.

4456
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,500
We made like a huge pot of pasta for everybody.

4457
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,140
A penne alla vodka for when they come back.

4458
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:36,400
They didn't get back until two o'clock in the morning.

4459
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:42,300
But what happened was two o'clock in the morning, I'm sitting there in the fridge just eating pasta with my hand.

4460
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:43,460
I was caught.

4461
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:46,280
The Syndicate walks in vlogging.

4462
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,320
The Syndicate walks in vlogging.

4463
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:52,740
I don't think it ever made it to the video, but it was just the most embarrassing thing ever.

4464
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:53,460
You're just sitting there.

4465
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,600
Fist in penne alla vodka.

4466
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,980
Just out of the fridge.

4467
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:58,740
Oh my god.

4468
01:55:58,840 --> 01:55:59,820
So I'm with you, Elem.

4469
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:00,520
I'm with you, man.

4470
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,060
Do you have the deleted scene?

4471
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,600
Do we have the clip?

4472
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:06,580
No, no.

4473
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:07,580
I don't think it ever made it to the VOD.

4474
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:08,220
Thank Christ.

4475
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,460
Wait, so who was vlogging it?

4476
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:11,620
Syndicate was.

4477
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:12,860
Okay, alright.

4478
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,800
What's this, Twitter?

4479
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:19,900
This was in 2016.

4480
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,560
My god, I was fist deep in that box.

4481
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:26,900
Oh my god.

4482
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,920
I don't need any more coins.

4483
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:30,200
Oh no.

4484
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:33,820
Oh, you know, we could get a little chance time again.

4485
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:34,520
Oh.

4486
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,200
Why not?

4487
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:38,560
Doki, you're so wealthy.

4488
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:41,620
I should see if we can give something to somebody else.

4489
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,580
No, that's okay.

4490
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,500
We're all pretty rich right now.

4491
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:49,260
We count again because I can't count.

4492
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,620
Yeah, but like, Women's Month is coming up, you know?

4493
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:52,540
I'm free baby.

4494
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,200
Do you forget Chubb hates women?

4495
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:56,800
Oh shit, you're right.

4496
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,220
I forgot.

4497
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:57,920
Never mind.

4498
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,800
Will it for my friend, Shubble?

4499
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,300
Don't push me, Chubb!

4500
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,660
And I never pushed her though.

4501
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:05,580
That's what they all say.

4502
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,580
That's what they all say.

4503
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,560
Don't push me, Chubb.

4504
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,600
Oh god, good times.

4505
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:17,140
Top ranked woman hater since 2008.

4506
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:23,140
Dude, at least I'm on some leaderboards, okay man?

4507
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,520
Oh my god.

4508
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:27,940
Oh my god.

4509
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:28,660
What, you're winning this?

4510
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,860
Oh wait, you're not winning this either.

4511
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,940
Oh, this is a spicy meatball.

4512
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:33,900
Oh.

4513
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:36,600
Dude, just swap me with Doki.

4514
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,300
Do it for the people.

4515
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:41,500
Do it for the people.

4516
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:41,980
Do it for the people.

4517
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:46,180
If you don't do it for Sakuno, then you're not a homie.

4518
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,500
Swap me with Doki.

4519
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,100
Oh man.

4520
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,060
Guys, come on.

4521
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,260
Will you do it to me?

4522
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:52,240
You're gonna do this to me?

4523
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,640
Your biggest fan?

4524
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:55,940
Star 20.

4525
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,960
Big swap, okay?

4526
01:57:58,060 --> 01:57:59,540
Star 20, big swap.

4527
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:00,720
Why don't you gamble?

4528
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,460
Close your eyes and just hit A.

4529
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,020
Just let fate play.

4530
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,420
Dude, what if you...

4531
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:08,520
I'm so relaxed.

4532
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:11,220
Well at that point, it doesn't really matter.

4533
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:13,060
Now I get three coins!

4534
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:17,380
I'm supposed to use an ally, guys.

4535
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:17,780
See?

4536
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:19,260
Oh no.

4537
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,160
She was dropping the rankings right now.

4538
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:23,000
He's dropping in the rankings.

4539
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,740
No, he got kicked out of the leaderboards.

4540
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,680
Is this a double coin bonus mini game?

4541
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:29,460
Oh, yeah.

4542
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:30,980
Here we go.

4543
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,020
Here we go.

4544
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,360
Oh, crazy cutters.

4545
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:36,540
Oh god.

4546
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,400
With latency, this one's just real bad.

4547
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:39,800
Oh, dude.

4548
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:41,160
There's actually no way.

4549
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,880
There's just straight up no way I can do this.

4550
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:44,960
Dude, I'm...

4551
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,120
My hands shake.

4552
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:46,700
It moves while...

4553
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,940
Oh, no, it moves without touching it.

4554
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,020
Dude, this one's so bad with the lag.

4555
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:51,240
I'm gonna try it.

4556
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,960
This is pretty weird with the...

4557
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,340
This is a $20 reduce, man.

4558
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:57,140
Here we go, here we go.

4559
01:58:58,020 --> 01:58:59,520
You're going reverse in them?

4560
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:01,180
Oh, wait, there's a...

4561
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,640
Holy Christ.

4562
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,940
Dude, this is so...

4563
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:06,160
Oh my god.

4564
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:08,680
I'm drilling, I'm drilling.

4565
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:10,880
Dude, I've horribly messed this up.

4566
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:11,300
I've...

4567
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:13,240
Dude, the delay though.

4568
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:15,100
The delay, am I right?

4569
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:19,340
Guys, I've done so bad.

4570
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:21,660
I'm gonna look at the moment it's done.

4571
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:22,140
Oh, dude.

4572
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,900
I can't even... I can't see.

4573
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:25,520
Wait, that looks pretty good.

4574
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,800
Where are you going?

4575
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:29,600
What happened?

4576
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:34,660
My jackhammer was so slow.

4577
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:38,920
Sykkuno gave it a hairline.

4578
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:40,800
Sykkuno gave it a hairline.

4579
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,760
It was so slow, I just tried to close it.

4580
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:45,840
I was like, okay, there's three seconds left.

4581
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,200
I'm gonna try and close it before it's too late.

4582
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,580
He just gave up.

4583
01:59:49,580 --> 01:59:50,480
I gave it a hairline.

4584
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,520
That's crazy.

4585
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,460
Holy shit.

4586
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,220
I got no coins for that, what the fuck?

4587
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,420
Dude, that happens when you suck, dude.

4588
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:00,360
Damn.

4589
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:03,200
Sorry, I'm being so reliant.

4590
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:03,740
I'm so sorry.

4591
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,580
Holy shit.

4592
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:08,260
I'm looking for the lucky you.

4593
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:09,320
Lucky you.

4594
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:11,000
Lucky you.

4595
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:12,760
There it is.

4596
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:14,800
Walk it down.

4597
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:16,560
I'm gonna get some stars eventually.

4598
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,060
Yeah, you can get the swap, you know?

4599
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:20,880
I don't think I can get this.

4600
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,300
Come on, low numbers, low numbers, Jesus, thank you.

4601
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:24,260
No!

4602
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,660
Tell him you know what to call.

4603
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:30,440
Oh, it's time.

4604
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,120
It's time.

4605
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,260
Finally, we get to be the dicks.

4606
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,320
Finally.

4607
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,160
Yes.

4608
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:38,540
Oh, you're gonna call it?

4609
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:38,840
Wait.

4610
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:41,140
Oh.

4611
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:42,200
Let me see.

4612
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:48,080
If you call it, if you call it, Sykkuno would not get that star.

4613
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:49,820
Are you really gonna do that to him?

4614
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,740
Am I in the way?

4615
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,980
You're close, you're like 12.

4616
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:56,320
Are you really gonna do it to him?

4617
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:58,260
Damn.

4618
02:00:59,180 --> 02:00:59,740
Oh.

4619
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:03,920
You're really gonna call it so he can't get it?

4620
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:06,360
You would.

4621
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,040
You would.

4622
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:11,780
I mean, Doki, I mean, you think I would do that to Sykkuno?

4623
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:13,440
There's no way.

4624
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,980
That is so fucked.

4625
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:18,280
That is so fucked.

4626
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:21,340
Alright, let's test your friendship right now.

4627
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:24,340
I'm gonna test your friendship right now.

4628
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:29,600
Damn, are you really?

4629
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,900
Respect, I think, question mark.

4630
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:33,940
I don't know.

4631
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:36,540
Lucky.

4632
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:38,740
Okay, okay.

4633
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,160
What do I get?

4634
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,420
Oh, 12 points!

4635
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:43,020
Let's go!

4636
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:45,940
Yeah, we're on turn 16.

4637
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:47,400
We have a long way to go.

4638
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,020
We have!

4639
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:51,140
How far is this?

4640
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:52,180
Wait, what?

4641
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,140
Another hour?

4642
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,720
Oh, jeez, Rick.

4643
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:59,220
Dude, it's been two hours for 16 turns.

4644
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:02,420
A one.

4645
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:04,740
Big numbers, big numbers.

4646
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:06,120
There's no way.

4647
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:08,620
Hey, look, Ellen didn't call in the warp.

4648
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,060
That's a good friend right there.

4649
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:12,600
Well, you can't even wait.

4650
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:14,120
You can't even reach it anyway.

4651
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:17,940
I'm gonna reach it next turn.

4652
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:19,720
Oh, oh yeah.

4653
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:20,320
Here we go.

4654
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,660
I'm in last place.

4655
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:23,640
Yeah, exactly.

4656
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,320
That would be so fucked if you do that to him.

4657
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:27,620
Exactly.

4658
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:28,780
You wouldn't even get anything.

4659
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:29,920
I never would, I never would.

4660
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,640
You'll gain nothing.

4661
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:34,780
There's zero reason to do it.

4662
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:34,960
Zero.

4663
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:35,820
He's gonna do it.

4664
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:37,200
He's gonna do it next turn.

4665
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,440
He's gonna make you so close to the...

4666
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,960
And it goes near Doki and she gets a sixth star.

4667
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,080
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna do that to him.

4668
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:46,940
But I also wouldn't wanna do that for you, Doki.

4669
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:48,680
I'm getting penalized.

4670
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:50,980
Yeah, but then he's the one that's supposed to...

4671
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:53,480
You want your friend to get the star, don't you?

4672
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,120
I mean, of course.

4673
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:58,240
Okay, we gotta make sure Chill doesn't win every minigame where he's gonna get a star.

4674
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:59,000
A bonus star.

4675
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,540
We gotta spread the wins there.

4676
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:03,320
Guys, I'm doing my best here.

4677
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:07,520
Oh wow, that was a double kill.

4678
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:09,720
How do you win?

4679
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:11,380
You just have to jump over.

4680
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:13,040
You have to jump over, you have to time it.

4681
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,740
You just have to time it.

4682
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,620
Yeah, you'll be fine.

4683
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:18,900
Just wait for me to do my jump and then you jump over my jump.

4684
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:20,260
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

4685
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,300
See, that's the example.

4686
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:23,640
We lock in.

4687
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:24,980
No!

4688
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:29,060
I have the one true gamer left.

4689
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:30,240
It's up to you.

4690
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:31,840
We can't have him win all of it.

4691
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,280
Dude, it's GG, bro.

4692
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,260
What is this?

4693
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:38,420
Why are you making fun of me?

4694
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,480
You died way earlier.

4695
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,840
He's spamming.

4696
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,520
He's literally spamming.

4697
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:47,500
He's spamming.

4698
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:48,580
He's literally spamming.

4699
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:50,460
I bet he's using a Switch Pro controller too.

4700
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:51,260
Why am I gonna change?

4701
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:52,260
You're not blocking, man.

4702
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:53,640
He's a Mario guy, dude.

4703
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:56,660
I bet he has a Switch Pro controller as well.

4704
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:57,420
I bet you.

4705
02:03:59,060 --> 02:03:59,460
100%.

4706
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:02,940
I'm using the Joy-Cons on the Switch.

4707
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:04,440
I'm using the Pro controller.

4708
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:05,920
I knew it!

4709
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,280
I knew he's got the Pro controller.

4710
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:09,860
Exactly.

4711
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:13,840
It had to be the Pro controller.

4712
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,160
He's got the dongle.

4713
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:16,560
He's got the dongle.

4714
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:17,980
He's got the Pro controller.

4715
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,180
He's got everything.

4716
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:23,180
Oh my god.

4717
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:23,900
What happened?

4718
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:25,560
Oh my god.

4719
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:26,500
That's insane.

4720
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:29,440
That's actually OP.

4721
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,360
How does Doki have this kind of luck?

4722
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,040
Take the eyeball.

4723
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,880
Maybe he'll accidentally click yes here.

4724
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,260
You don't wanna do that, do you?

4725
02:04:38,240 --> 02:04:40,380
Guys, this is now Operation Chance Time.

4726
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,820
It's the only way us men can get in.

4727
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,480
Boys, we gotta stay together now.

4728
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:46,700
We've gotta unite.

4729
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:47,780
We've got to unite.

4730
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:51,200
And if there's one thing men do, it's they definitely don't falter.

4731
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:53,720
They definitely unite and don't hurt each other.

4732
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:54,480
Never would.

4733
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,100
Never would.

4734
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,980
Because Boys Night has never come crashing down before.

4735
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:03,260
You guys, I'm having a great time.

4736
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:05,040
Like, with all my friends, guys.

4737
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:07,180
I fucking bet with six stars.

4738
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:08,920
Six stars?

4739
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:09,680
I got zero.

4740
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:13,360
You guys, I'm having a great night on Boys Night, guys.

4741
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,500
You guys, I'm having a great night on Boys Night, guys.

4742
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:17,760
The rest of the entire game only has two.

4743
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:21,120
I am in fourth place with less coins than you, you little shit.

4744
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:25,040
The rest of the entire game only has two.

4745
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,940
Oh no, the Boys Night is ending again.

4746
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:28,800
The boys are fighting.

4747
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,280
See, that was so quick.

4748
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,060
Dropshipping off Alibaba.

4749
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:37,060
We called you a fucking dropshipper.

4750
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:38,480
Oh my god.

4751
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:40,300
You gotta get your money up, man.

4752
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:41,180
Surely.

4753
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:42,700
A humble four, I'll take that.

4754
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:44,320
And then with my skeleton key.

4755
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,420
Let's open the door.

4756
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,940
Oh, he's gonna open the door.

4757
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,000
He's gonna do the shuffle.

4758
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:50,340
It's time.

4759
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:52,080
Get me in there.

4760
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:54,640
I'll miss the way the inside of your pocket feels, Elm.

4761
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:57,040
That's what he actually said.

4762
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:57,880
It's a real quote.

4763
02:05:58,860 --> 02:05:59,900
That's a real quote?

4764
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:02,760
Oh wait, we could have revolution.

4765
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:04,940
Yeah, another revolution.

4766
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:06,940
If we get Bowser revolution, we may as well quit the game now.

4767
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,080
Just don't get Bowser revolution.

4768
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:13,400
This is all he has, Elm.

4769
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:14,300
This is literally all he has.

4770
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:18,440
Literally nothing else matters, but if you get Bowser revolution, we just give up.

4771
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:19,800
I'm not gonna get Bowser revolution.

4772
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:20,200
Watch this.

4773
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:20,480
Watch this.

4774
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:21,880
I'm just not gonna get it.

4775
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:23,240
I'm not gonna get it, guys.

4776
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:25,340
That's good.

4777
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:25,860
That's good.

4778
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:26,660
That's good.

4779
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:27,460
That's good.

4780
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:28,800
You saved us.

4781
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,420
You saved all of us.

4782
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:34,100
You couldn't give half your coins to Bowser.

4783
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:34,860
It could have been worse.

4784
02:06:34,940 --> 02:06:36,840
I'm not gonna save any of you, fuckers.

4785
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:39,060
Don't be an ally.

4786
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:40,360
Yeah!

4787
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:44,000
Dude, voice chat's already done.

4788
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,580
That lasted like...

4789
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:47,280
I just got the key.

4790
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:50,900
Is that the bank?

4791
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:52,460
No, I think it's one past the bank.

4792
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:53,400
Yeah.

4793
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,760
You joined at night.

4794
02:06:54,860 --> 02:06:55,280
This is good.

4795
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,580
If you go at night time, this is amazing.

4796
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,900
I need you to make it night.

4797
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,800
I think I'm right past it.

4798
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:02,520
I mean, we'll see here.

4799
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,160
Yeah, I'm just on the blue.

4800
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,160
You have a key, though.

4801
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:06,840
You can get in there.

4802
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

4803
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:13,600
I mean, to be fair, there's still a lot of turns left, so anything could happen at this point.

4804
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:17,420
Elm still doesn't have a star, so a triple steal just makes no sense.

4805
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:18,340
You're right.

4806
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,780
You're paying 150 for two stars.

4807
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:20,340
That's expensive.

4808
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:23,220
Yeah, I may as well do a double regular steal.

4809
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,600
The worst item on the board?

4810
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:26,200
Okay, game.

4811
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:29,260
Well, that was a gripping turn.

4812
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:30,300
Here we go.

4813
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:30,960
Here we go.

4814
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,160
Let's go!

4815
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:32,780
Here we go!

4816
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:33,420
I mean, hey!

4817
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:39,780
All I'm saying is that Chilled won the last 1v3, so there's a chance.

4818
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:41,760
There's a chance for you, Elm.

4819
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,360
Follow my blueprint.

4820
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:44,180
It definitely depends.

4821
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,680
Oh, this is so winnable.

4822
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:47,600
This one's definitely winnable.

4823
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,640
Guys, guys, let's not follow each other, guys.

4824
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:50,800
What do you mean?

4825
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:51,580
You guys smell nice.

4826
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:52,840
Guys, please.

4827
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:53,960
We all have to be separated.

4828
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:54,540
Guys!

4829
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:57,520
Guys, trust me.

4830
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:58,820
I've already won this.

4831
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,100
Really?

4832
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:04,180
Because I pulled up Sykkuno's stream right now.

4833
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:07,360
I don't even think that helps.

4834
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:09,000
I don't even know where I'm hiding.

4835
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,780
Well, I know Sykkuno is behind the big mushroom.

4836
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:11,160
Watch this.

4837
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,020
I'm going behind the big mushroom.

4838
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:14,920
I'm going behind the big mushroom, too.

4839
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:17,480
I know he likes the big mushroom.

4840
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:18,800
I know he likes the big mushroom.

4841
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:19,340
Done.

4842
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:20,080
Can we go there?

4843
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,680
Did you see me?

4844
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:24,940
There's no way.

4845
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:27,560
You could've gotten two of us behind that bush.

4846
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,180
Guys, let's just stay.

4847
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,000
I'll go A.

4848
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,020
He can't close off.

4849
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:30,420
He'll split up.

4850
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:31,020
I'll go A.

4851
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,140
Are you sure?

4852
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,160
Yeah, I'll go A, too.

4853
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:36,680
I'm just button mashing and I don't even know where I am.

4854
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:38,360
No, you're actually going A.

4855
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:39,900
You're actually going A.

4856
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,840
What the fuck?

4857
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:43,580
That is...

4858
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:45,900
You guys, what?

4859
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,920
What do you mean you guys?

4860
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,780
Sykkuno, you were there with us.

4861
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:50,920
What was that?

4862
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,540
You were there with us.

4863
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:54,880
You can't say you guys.

4864
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:56,680
That was the biggest throw I've ever seen.

4865
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,340
That was actually the biggest throw I've ever seen.

4866
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,780
I didn't think you were going to be A, too.

4867
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:03,680
All the time I've played Mario Party, I've never seen that in my life.

4868
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,800
I think we suck.

4869
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:08,580
Actually, the first time I've ever seen this occur.

4870
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,280
It's triple kill.

4871
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:12,080
I can't believe it.

4872
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:14,660
I can't believe we were all at A.

4873
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,020
What were we doing?

4874
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:18,760
Wait, are you getting another one?

4875
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,420
No, I'm not.

4876
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,720
No, I'm not close to it.

4877
02:09:20,940 --> 02:09:21,980
I'll be honest, though.

4878
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,280
I didn't even, like, know.

4879
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:25,600
I was going A.

4880
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:26,280
I was just mashing.

4881
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:27,300
I was mashing.

4882
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:27,760
And you know what?

4883
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:29,640
I'm glad we all shared that experience together.

4884
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:30,280
Yeah, I didn't know either.

4885
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,460
I was literally mashing, too.

4886
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:34,020
I'm glad we all shared that, too.

4887
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,500
I pressed Y, but I went to A.

4888
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:38,140
I don't know how this game works.

4889
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:41,920
Okay.

4890
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:47,600
You have to call it to stop her in her reign of terror.

4891
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,240
You have to call it to stop her in her reign of terror.

4892
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:49,560
But I'm an ally.

4893
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:52,560
Yeah, but you were an ally for a long time.

4894
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:53,400
So, like, it's fine.

4895
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,680
But I'm an ally.

4896
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:57,640
I want you to know Chill made me do this.

4897
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,580
Chill made me do this.

4898
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:02,060
Chill wants to go back on the leaderboard.

4899
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:03,800
He literally forced my hand.

4900
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,200
He's DMing me horrible slurs right now.

4901
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:07,500
He's horrible.

4902
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:10,580
Just Italian slurs.

4903
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:10,920
It's fine.

4904
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:11,360
It's okay.

4905
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:13,020
Yeah, it's fine.

4906
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:14,940
Here we go.

4907
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,300
Oh, mamma mia!

4908
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:19,020
Wait, it's right in front of him!

4909
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:22,100
Elm, you're such an ally.

4910
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:28,380
And when I get this event space, and then steal everything from Doki, it's gonna be great.

4911
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:29,620
You're past it.

4912
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:30,920
You're past it.

4913
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:31,720
Dang it.

4914
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,240
Hey, you got $4!

4915
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:39,620
If you get Bowser Revolution, man, I'm all of that for you.

4916
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:41,200
But I got all of the money.

4917
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,560
He got 12 coins.

4918
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,940
He didn't get Bowser Revolution.

4919
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:45,740
All of me and your money.

4920
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:46,400
Thank you so much.

4921
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:48,620
The 12 coins will be so good.

4922
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:50,180
Oh, wait!

4923
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,200
Chill can get a star because he has a triple dice.

4924
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:53,720
Finally.

4925
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:55,600
The gods shine upon me.

4926
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:56,240
No!

4927
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:58,340
Roll low, roll low.

4928
02:10:59,100 --> 02:10:59,500
Big!

4929
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,880
Wait, no, that's bad, right?

4930
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,260
Oh, you're gonna risk it?

4931
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,980
Let me look at the board.

4932
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:07,020
Does this land me on...

4933
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:08,020
It lands you on Bowser.

4934
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,900
You need to risk it, man.

4935
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,200
You gotta do it.

4936
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:13,240
You gotta do it.

4937
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:14,280
It's worth it.

4938
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:17,720
You have zero stars at this point.

4939
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:17,760
Why am I risking this?

4940
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:18,660
It makes no sense.

4941
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:20,520
It makes complete sense to do it.

4942
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,360
You get 40 coins from the stealing.

4943
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:23,920
It literally makes zero sense to do it.

4944
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:26,380
As long as you don't get the revolution, you'll be fine.

4945
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:28,900
This is potentially the stupidest decision I could make in this situation.

4946
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:29,020
No!

4947
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:30,800
You're gonna steal 40 coins next turn.

4948
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,460
And you have a chance time attempt.

4949
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:35,540
There's no way you're gonna ever get a revolution.

4950
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:36,640
There's no way.

4951
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,880
This is probably the worst financial decision of my Mario Party.

4952
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:38,440
career.

4953
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,820
There's no way your luck is that bad.

4954
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:42,300
There's no way.

4955
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,060
Lock it in, lock it down.

4956
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,320
Dude, dude, it's insane.

4957
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,280
I'm out there pouring.

4958
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:50,420
This is insane.

4959
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,700
The game doesn't want me to play it.

4960
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:58,360
It just doesn't want me to play the game.

4961
02:11:58,540 --> 02:11:59,260
It doesn't...

4962
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:01,080
It doesn't make sense.

4963
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:05,100
The game doesn't make sense.

4964
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,200
The game doesn't make sense.

4965
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:08,460
The game doesn't make sense.

4966
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:09,160
Spread the wealth!

4967
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:10,360
Spread the wealth!

4968
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:12,300
Doki's going for 20 coins like 100.

4969
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:17,560
How does Doki have 6 stars and 100 coins?

4970
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:18,080
How does Doki have 6 stars and 100 coins?

4971
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:20,580
But we all have 100 coins, guys.

4972
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:21,720
We're all equal.

4973
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:25,500
I want you to notice, like, you didn't only fuck yourself, you fucked me as well.

4974
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:26,260
Thank you so much.

4975
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,160
Dude, she could buy 5 more stars.

4976
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:31,060
It just doesn't...

4977
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:32,200
The game is insane.

4978
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,780
This is actually insane.

4979
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:39,040
I just lost, like, 75 points.

4980
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:40,800
After losing...

4981
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,580
I've lost over 150 coins in this game alone.

4982
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,400
Oh my god.

4983
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:47,700
Like, I've lost more coins than most people make in a game.

4984
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:47,960
That's crazy.

4985
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:50,040
It's not even...

4986
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:51,620
I pay more taxes than you've made.

4987
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:53,280
Oh my god.

4988
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:57,840
I've lost over 150 coins in this game alone, man.

4989
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,140
Oh my god.

4990
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:58,980
What the fuck is this?

4991
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:04,760
I went from first place to lost in, like, the whole time now.

4992
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:06,140
Nothing has been going back.

4993
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,800
Hey, hey, I got you, man.

4994
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:10,220
I'm gonna turn the light on until the next round.

4995
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:10,780
It doesn't matter.

4996
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:12,000
He doesn't have 150 coins!

4997
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:14,260
He doesn't have 150 coins!

4998
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:15,120
I'm trying to be an ally.

4999
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,600
You're rubbing salt on the wound!

5000
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:21,180
Yeah, but you get 40 coins!

5001
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,360
Yeah, but you get 40 coins!

5002
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:24,600
I've only got one option left.

5003
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:25,020
This is crazy.

5004
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:26,520
This is actually crazy.

5005
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:31,500
You can't believe you're rubbing salt on his wound by making it nighttime.

5006
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:35,940
Boys, it's chance time, okay?

5007
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:36,760
It's chance time.

5008
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:40,880
The only thing we can do now is buy custom dice blocks and pray for chance times.

5009
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:41,560
That's all we can do.

5010
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,240
That's all we can do at this point.

5011
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:45,120
This luck is just shockingly bad.

5012
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:46,180
Here we go.

5013
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:47,600
Oh my god.

5014
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:53,680
We have so many turns left.

5015
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:56,340
We have so many turns left.

5016
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:59,120
I could lose the six stars so quickly.

5017
02:14:00,620 --> 02:14:02,460
I don't even need turns.

5018
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:04,520
It's over.

5019
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:05,960
It's over.

5020
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:09,200
Hey, I felt that way when I had zero stars once.

5021
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:11,480
It made me feel better.

5022
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:13,500
Yeah, and I feel like shit still.

5023
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:15,700
So, like, there's a chance.

5024
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:16,600
Oh, man.

5025
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:20,320
Okay, here we go.

5026
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:22,300
Lock it in, lock it down.

5027
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:23,400
Yes.

5028
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:24,440
This is great.

5029
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:24,980
This is great.

5030
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:26,800
Don't be tug of war.

5031
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:28,380
Don't be tug of war.

5032
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:33,460
We did so many 1v... I feel like every minigame has been 1v3.

5033
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:35,860
I think so far, honestly, I think... Oh, wait.

5034
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,440
I love this one, though.

5035
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:37,060
I'm goaded.

5036
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:38,300
Dude, I'm actually goaded this one.

5037
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,400
I'm running right towards it.

5038
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:43,320
Wait, this is hard.

5039
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:44,860
Wait, this is so hard.

5040
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:46,700
I'm too good.

5041
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:48,600
What?

5042
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:50,120
Oh, good work, you two.

5043
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:50,940
Look at that.

5044
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:51,740
Look at that.

5045
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:52,820
This is not fair.

5046
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:54,100
Why do I get this one?

5047
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:55,680
It's a simple dub.

5048
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:57,300
This is not fair.

5049
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:57,960
This is not fair.

5050
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:58,960
They hate the rich.

5051
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:01,880
Oh, went straight for the Italian.

5052
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:02,740
Oh, here we go.

5053
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:07,520
Went straight for the Italian again.

5054
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:08,820
That's fucking right.

5055
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:10,600
Go up.

5056
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:11,560
Go up, Ellum.

5057
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:13,780
Why did you randomly loop?

5058
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:14,200
I don't know.

5059
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,380
We got this, gamers.

5060
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:22,040
He gets here all separatist.

5061
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:23,300
We did it, men.

5062
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:24,520
We did it.

5063
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,820
Let this be the start of her downfall.

5064
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:28,120
That's not fair.

5065
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:30,720
We just need the event space.

5066
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:35,060
Just because I'm rich doesn't mean I'm different from you guys.

5067
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:39,620
The six stars definitely does.

5068
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:39,780
The six stars definitely does.

5069
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:40,060
Here we go.

5070
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,260
I'm just like you guys.

5071
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:48,920
When you are DoorDash and your star box is 100 points, this is insane.

5072
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:52,560
The six stars is actually crazy.

5073
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:55,180
Yeah, but I could lose this.

5074
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:57,960
Those are going to be my six stars in the future.

5075
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:59,040
By the chance.

5076
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:00,740
You guys can chance it.

5077
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:02,940
Yeah, I guess.

5078
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,400
That's actually true.

5079
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,740
That's literally the only way we have this.

5080
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:07,920
We have the custom dice pocket chance.

5081
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:10,820
We have the custom dice chance and try and swap them.

5082
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:13,380
Seven coins.

5083
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:16,760
That's big coinage right there.

5084
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:17,520
It has six stars.

5085
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,080
It almost has max coins.

5086
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:21,980
What do you mean almost has max coins?

5087
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:26,600
You were at 175 and you still didn't max it out.

5088
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:28,380
Guys, we need out.

5089
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:31,140
I mean like compared to everyone else, you got so many coins.

5090
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:35,200
If I get a triple dice and then the next turn I buy a custom dice pocket.

5091
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,540
I get to the other one, we steal everything from her, she cries.

5092
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:43,240
Just remember, if we do this, we aren't allies anymore.

5093
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:45,900
You have to fully commit.

5094
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:47,040
Oh, this is it.

5095
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,820
This is his only chance.

5096
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:50,760
If I need to sell my soul for this win, I'll do it.

5097
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:54,600
This is Macuno's only chance to feel rich.

5098
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:55,160
This is my chance.

5099
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:58,040
I'm gonna steal a small amount of money.

5100
02:16:58,140 --> 02:17:00,500
That was your only chance.

5101
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:02,020
That was...

5102
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:04,580
I was hoping to get on the VS space.

5103
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:05,260
That was it.

5104
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:07,820
Guys, just don't push A.

5105
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:09,120
For the poor.

5106
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,820
This is the steel kitchen.

5107
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:13,480
I had a hard day.

5108
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:15,760
I had a hard day.

5109
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:20,240
Most of the coins you have were mine anyway from the revolution.

5110
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:23,840
This motherfucker keeps saying that I'm not in the same position as him.

5111
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:24,800
Dude, we are both broke.

5112
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:25,420
I'm mashing.

5113
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,180
Okay, thank you so much.

5114
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,640
Okay, so who's been in the worst position?

5115
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:31,800
Elem, who's had two stars and lost it all.

5116
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,320
Or is it Macuno who's never had and never lost?

5117
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:37,120
I've never had any stars.

5118
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:43,000
Elem's worse off because he experienced what it was like to be rich, but now he's lost it all.

5119
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:43,800
Exactly.

5120
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:47,860
I think I'm actually all death flooring.

5121
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:48,540
No, you're good.

5122
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:49,620
You got the Koopa back.

5123
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:52,040
Surely there's no way.

5124
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:52,760
Surely there's no way.

5125
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:57,120
I mean, we're all really far away from the next star.

5126
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:00,320
The star is right next to the chance sign.

5127
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:02,400
So you have a chance to get chance sign and the star.

5128
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:02,820
That's true.

5129
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:05,000
You can get the double whammy.

5130
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:08,040
Hope to get to the star.

5131
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:08,860
Oh god.

5132
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:11,380
Oh, you knocked her off.

5133
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:14,100
She's in my way.

5134
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:17,680
You pushed her just like you pushed that woman.

5135
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:19,100
I'm an ally.

5136
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:19,440
I'm an ally.

5137
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:21,260
Yeah, she wasn't in my way.

5138
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:23,100
She's free to stand there as much as she wants.

5139
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:25,040
How come you guys aren't getting items?

5140
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:26,960
What do you mean?

5141
02:18:27,020 --> 02:18:28,940
I got a skeleton key so I can steal everybody's money.

5142
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:31,060
Oh, it's light.

5143
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:31,380
Oh.

5144
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:32,340
Oh, hey.

5145
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:34,220
Oh god.

5146
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:35,140
Oh god.

5147
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:35,860
Perfect.

5148
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:38,640
All part of the plan.

5149
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:41,480
Oh, it's actually a full player one.

5150
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:42,400
Finally.

5151
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,580
This is the first one.

5152
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:47,720
Not this one, dude.

5153
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:48,640
What is this?

5154
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,640
I don't know this one.

5155
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:50,880
This one sucks.

5156
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,060
I hate this one with the passion.

5157
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:53,200
Oh, this one does suck.

5158
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:54,960
Pure RNGesus, dude.

5159
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:58,080
Wait, how do I...

5160
02:18:58,560 --> 02:18:59,820
They're eating my friends.

5161
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,680
How long do you need to leave it before you get back in the hole?

5162
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:04,340
I don't know.

5163
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:06,520
They're eating the Waluigi.

5164
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:07,760
They're eating the Birdo.

5165
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:10,800
I'm stopping.

5166
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:12,000
Get in.

5167
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:13,500
Dude, I was in.

5168
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:15,860
The delay.

5169
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:18,880
Oh, shit.

5170
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:20,480
We're all dead.

5171
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:22,100
We're done.

5172
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:24,780
Hey, that was a wonderful game, guys.

5173
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:27,880
We're all equal, guys.

5174
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:30,560
I think they should give us 10 coins since it's a tie.

5175
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:31,140
Yeah.

5176
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:32,780
Do you have any coins left?

5177
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,440
No, we all lost.

5178
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:37,260
We're all fourth place.

5179
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:39,580
I don't think we care about money at that point.

5180
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:40,040
Like...

5181
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,480
We all have so much money.

5182
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:45,800
I don't think it matters anymore.

5183
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,080
Speak for yourself, man.

5184
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:48,760
I was supposed to have all the coins.

5185
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:49,500
Those were mine.

5186
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,160
Those were my coins.

5187
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:53,700
Don't worry.

5188
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:56,840
See, I am a responsible citizen in Koopa Land.

5189
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,000
Here to pay my taxes.

5190
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:01,500
Dude, if I somehow land on Bowser Revolution again, that would be the third.

5191
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:02,600
Surely not.

5192
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,660
I mean, at this point, it's going to start to break even.

5193
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:08,260
They're going to give you some money.

5194
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:09,960
You're lucky.

5195
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,060
We need a Bowser Revolution for stars.

5196
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:15,360
Oh my god.

5197
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:16,100
That's good.

5198
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:18,300
Yeah, but what do I...

5199
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:20,300
I guess I'll get rid of my skeleton.

5200
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:23,180
Yeah, I guess so.

5201
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:24,400
That makes sense.

5202
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:25,540
Yeah, I don't need it.

5203
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:29,300
Dude, if you stole though, that would be so sickening.

5204
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:30,740
Stealing from the poor?

5205
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:33,380
We don't even have anything she wants.

5206
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:36,060
Yeah, you guys have nothing I really want right now.

5207
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:36,820
So like...

5208
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:38,260
You could steal stars from Chaos.

5209
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,700
But if we did, then you...

5210
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:43,820
Yeah, but if you guys start stealing from me, I have to take my chance too.

5211
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:45,440
You need an 18.

5212
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:47,100
An 18 will give you the chance.

5213
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:48,400
I mean, Alan's definitely stealing from you.

5214
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:49,000
You got 18!

5215
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:49,560
You got chance time!

5216
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:50,680
Wait, actually?

5217
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,400
You legitimately got chance time.

5218
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:54,520
Wait, which way?

5219
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:57,160
Go to the star.

5220
02:20:58,180 --> 02:20:59,260
You want to go left?

5221
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:03,240
I want to go chance time and steal everything from Doki.

5222
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:03,920
Everything.

5223
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:04,680
Everything.

5224
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:06,200
I thought you were taking everything from me.

5225
02:21:06,820 --> 02:21:07,640
Steal from me?

5226
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,140
What have I done?

5227
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:13,360
You literally DM'ed me saying you hate British people.

5228
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:14,640
You literally DM'ed me saying you hate British people.

5229
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:15,040
That is a lie!

5230
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:17,020
Show me that DM right now!

5231
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:19,960
Show me that DM right now!

5232
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:21,780
You gotta go left, right?

5233
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:22,080
Left?

5234
02:21:22,180 --> 02:21:24,620
Go left towards the star.

5235
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:25,520
Okay, okay.

5236
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:27,260
Focus the star.

5237
02:21:28,540 --> 02:21:29,960
Focus on the star.

5238
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,180
But I need the...

5239
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:33,420
Okay.

5240
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:35,140
You got this.

5241
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:37,000
Towards the star?

5242
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:38,380
Towards the star.

5243
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:39,360
You're literally there.

5244
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,880
Alan, just look at the screen.

5245
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,180
He's making me panic.

5246
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:45,300
Yeah, he's getting a little panicky.

5247
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:46,340
Even though like...

5248
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:48,360
Oh, this is awesome.

5249
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:52,560
This is where his luck literally turns around.

5250
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:55,580
And just when I actually got rid of my skeleton key too.

5251
02:21:56,220 --> 02:21:57,220
Do you know what's gonna happen?

5252
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,960
He's gonna buy the one star and give it away.

5253
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:00,580
No!

5254
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:03,460
There's no way, right?

5255
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:04,820
He hits Sykkuno.

5256
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,640
He gets that one star and he hits Sykkuno's.

5257
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:10,660
He might have the ping advantage though.

5258
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:11,780
He might.

5259
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:12,500
Here we go.

5260
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:14,400
I just need one star guys, surely.

5261
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:17,720
As long as it doesn't end up in front of Doki, then we're...

5262
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,300
Oh, it ends up in front of Alan.

5263
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:20,500
Finally.

5264
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:21,920
Oh yeah.

5265
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:25,460
Are you gonna do the middle one first or are you picking the person first?

5266
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:25,900
It's not even close to me.

5267
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:28,280
Oh, do the people first.

5268
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:30,360
Which is the spicier way of doing it?

5269
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:33,840
You definitely do the people first because if Doki's not involved it's just...

5270
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:36,160
You're right, so try and get Doki in there.

5271
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:36,560
Yeah.

5272
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:37,400
Okay, here we go.

5273
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:39,660
There is some delay when you hit though.

5274
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:40,580
There is some delay.

5275
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:44,740
Why is everybody going against me?

5276
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:45,880
I'm just a little guy.

5277
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:48,220
I'm just a little guy.

5278
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,760
There's no way you fuck this up.

5279
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,800
What did I do wrong?

5280
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:58,100
I'm just trying to hang out.

5281
02:22:59,020 --> 02:22:59,460
Alright.

5282
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:00,820
Choose the other person.

5283
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:01,620
Here we go.

5284
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:02,180
Oh!

5285
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:06,440
And surely...

5286
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:07,520
This could be it.

5287
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:10,720
Oh my god!

5288
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:13,100
Oh my god!

5289
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:15,160
That's insane, dude.

5290
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:16,420
That's insane.

5291
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:18,900
Holy Jesus.

5292
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:21,200
Oh my god.

5293
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:23,560
Oh my god!

5294
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:27,520
He fucking put 25 turns there for a reason.

5295
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,120
Wow.

5296
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,780
I gave you one star.

5297
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:33,740
At least I'm not last.

5298
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:35,920
You know, at least I'm not last.

5299
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:36,860
I could still get a star.

5300
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:42,920
Hey, now everyone has one star so if you get back in there you could steal three stars.

5301
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:44,180
Oh, that's true.

5302
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,640
Yeah, I'll just go ahead and do that real quick.

5303
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:49,120
Revenge is sweet.

5304
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:52,440
The British doing it again.

5305
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:55,680
Well, now we have to work together because Elem's gonna win.

5306
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,440
Do we all really want Elem to win?

5307
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,800
Actually, no, I don't want that at all.

5308
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:00,340
No, wait, but guys, guys.

5309
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:02,680
Guys, do we really want Elem to win?

5310
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:04,860
I did that for the boys everywhere.

5311
02:24:05,020 --> 02:24:05,640
What do you mean?

5312
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:08,080
Elem, how can we beat woman?

5313
02:24:08,300 --> 02:24:09,220
Do you think we can do an interview?

5314
02:24:12,660 --> 02:24:14,400
Not only is this, dude.

5315
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:15,740
But he hates N.A.

5316
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:17,480
He hates the N.A.

5317
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:17,860
people.

5318
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:19,440
I'm an honorary American.

5319
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,880
Bakuna always says that.

5320
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:22,700
He always says I'm an honorary American.

5321
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:24,600
Dude, this is the worst luck I've ever seen.

5322
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,840
What am I even gonna do with these?

5323
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:29,340
What am I even gonna do with these?

5324
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:31,340
I can't even use them all before the game is over.

5325
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:33,080
That's actually crazy.

5326
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:36,660
That's actually the worst luck I've ever seen an item win.

5327
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:37,380
That's actually the worst luck I've ever seen an item win.

5328
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:40,780
Hey, you turned around with chance to steal Elem's six stars.

5329
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:41,620
Hey, you turned around with chance to steal Elem's six stars.

5330
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:43,460
Whoa, Sakuna, you don't need to do that.

5331
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:44,460
Think of what I just did for you.

5332
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,840
You didn't even give him the stars.

5333
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:49,680
But my intentions were there.

5334
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:51,240
He has pure intentions.

5335
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:52,880
He has pure intentions.

5336
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,000
Which is the main thing.

5337
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:56,660
You know what I mean?

5338
02:24:56,720 --> 02:25:00,780
What were your intentions?

5339
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:04,700
You clearly never thought about Sakuna once during the chance game.

5340
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:05,320
You clearly never thought about Sakuna once during the chance game.

5341
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:07,660
I was gonna try and give him the stars there.

5342
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:11,020
But unfortunately, luck be as it is, they all came to me.

5343
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:11,640
But unfortunately, luck be as it is, they all came to me.

5344
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:13,480
How many skeleton keys did they have?

5345
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:16,780
We can all do chance at this point.

5346
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:18,960
Let's all go to chance.

5347
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:20,840
I think that's the only way to go.

5348
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:23,820
You gotta get your money back.

5349
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:24,020
You gotta get your money back.

5350
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:27,200
We're all gonna go chance time.

5351
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:28,340
I'm happy with my six, guys.

5352
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:29,380
I'm happy with my six.

5353
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,040
Everyone gang up.

5354
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:33,840
Everyone do chance, guys.

5355
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:37,500
What is this?

5356
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:38,380
We have to make a snowball.

5357
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:41,140
Wait, chill.

5358
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:42,640
Oh, what a bad maneuver.

5359
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:46,360
Get him!

5360
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:47,320
Destroy him!

5361
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:49,940
Make sure he has nothing left.

5362
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:52,120
He's in first place now, right?

5363
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:52,840
So we gotta...

5364
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:55,420
We can't let him get money.

5365
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:56,820
Maybe you wouldn't do this to me, right?

5366
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,620
I'll break his defense.

5367
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:02,940
Sorry, I pushed it back.

5368
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:03,860
Don't let him get up.

5369
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:06,000
Ellen, why would you do that?

5370
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:07,100
Alright, goodbye.

5371
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:08,740
Go, go, go!

5372
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:10,080
Yeah!

5373
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,760
Alright, I'm pretty mad to himself now.

5374
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,320
We all get ten coins?

5375
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:17,660
Let's do that.

5376
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:20,180
Throw your ball away as a sign of peace.

5377
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:21,400
Yes, a sign of peace.

5378
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:23,440
Alright, everyone group up.

5379
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:26,260
Group photo, guys, group photo!

5380
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:28,340
I'm standing in the back because I'm tall.

5381
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:31,760
Guys, group photo!

5382
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:35,960
We're just doing group photo, right?

5383
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,100
This is what...

5384
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:39,740
Yeah, we're just throwing up some...

5385
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:42,380
Throwing up some snow for the photo, that's all.

5386
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:43,080
Yeah, Chad.

5387
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:46,200
It's gonna look like such a nice photo, guys.

5388
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:48,120
Imagine if you made a snowball right now.

5389
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,920
Imagine if you made one snowball right now.

5390
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:53,360
Oh, we have a snowball in the photo!

5391
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:54,460
Let's have a snowball in the photo!

5392
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:55,120
I'm taking a hit!

5393
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:57,240
Get down, Mr. President!

5394
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:00,560
We did it, guys!

5395
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,060
We're all winners here.

5396
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:04,360
That was BM and I loved it.

5397
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:06,260
And A, and A, and A!

5398
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:07,940
Oh, we got 20?

5399
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:10,420
Guys, I'm an honorary American.

5400
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:11,640
You guys know this.

5401
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:13,940
If you're an honorary American, why did you...

5402
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:17,360
Why did you steal from the Canadians?

5403
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:17,980
Oh!

5404
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:20,500
Can you make it daytime so I can steal from Ellum?

5405
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:21,640
No, no, no, no.

5406
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:22,040
Oh, that's true.

5407
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:22,940
Okay, I can try.

5408
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:24,300
Yeah, if you could try.

5409
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:25,700
Why did you steal from me?

5410
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:29,040
Well, I can go down to the other one and just take one coin from you.

5411
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:29,640
Or one star.

5412
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:30,420
It feels like that's fair.

5413
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:31,240
You don't give me that.

5414
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:32,600
I mean, I like my stars.

5415
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:34,120
It balances things, you know?

5416
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:35,300
It makes things a little more balanced.

5417
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:36,220
No, no, no, no.

5418
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:36,440
It's okay.

5419
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:41,400
If this is a Kudo's gonna win, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

5420
02:27:41,740 --> 02:27:41,920
If this is a Kudo's gonna win, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

5421
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:43,320
Bro, give me a Boo Bell right now.

5422
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,740
Dude, it's gonna say he's gonna win.

5423
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:48,120
Oh, where's my reward?

5424
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:49,440
Where did you get it?

5425
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:50,980
One more Skeleton Key.

5426
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:51,660
One more Skeleton Key.

5427
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:52,180
What are you gonna get?

5428
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,320
Our predicted winner!

5429
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:55,620
Oh, a Golden Point!

5430
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:57,360
Golden Pipe's good.

5431
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:58,540
Oh, you can go to a star!

5432
02:27:58,640 --> 02:27:58,840
That is awesome.

5433
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,320
That's freaking juice, dude.

5434
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:02,300
You should get rid of the Golden Pipe.

5435
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:03,840
What will you get rid of?

5436
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:06,100
Dude, what the?

5437
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:07,700
No way, dude.

5438
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:08,320
No way.

5439
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:09,060
It delayed.

5440
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:13,380
I moved to the right and pushed A and the lag made it go one over.

5441
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:15,560
That's crazy.

5442
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:16,400
That's crazy.

5443
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:18,020
That's insane.

5444
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:20,240
The delay actually made it go one over on accident.

5445
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:21,880
That's what I got right there.

5446
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:23,100
Dude, the lag is insane.

5447
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:27,360
No, no, this makes sense because when you do a swap, that way you're not gonna give him a star.

5448
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,580
You're not gonna give him a star when you swap now.

5449
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:29,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5450
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:30,240
That's right.

5451
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:30,560
That's right.

5452
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:32,200
You didn't want him to have a star anyway, right?

5453
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:33,660
Yeah, when you swap with him.

5454
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:34,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5455
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:35,680
That was the whole plan.

5456
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:36,260
The controls are delayed.

5457
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:39,500
I'm saying, yeah, but you guys are attacking me.

5458
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:39,860
The delay.

5459
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,960
Toki, can you roll a one?

5460
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:44,200
It's actually delayed.

5461
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:47,220
I'm gonna grab a triple so I can go to chance.

5462
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:48,500
I'm gonna try.

5463
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:50,980
Okay, but where's the nearest event space?

5464
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:53,080
Is there a way you can get the event space in two balls at the same time?

5465
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:53,380
No.

5466
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:55,960
Insane.

5467
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:59,300
Unfortunately, this is my only chance to.

5468
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:01,660
It actually was delayed.

5469
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:03,100
It was just actually delayed.

5470
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:09,000
I don't think I've ever seen you this unlucky in life ever in any game.

5471
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:09,960
It's delayed.

5472
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:11,060
It's just delayed.

5473
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:15,740
After you sat there for six hours greeting all the fans, this is how you get treated?

5474
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:16,760
That's fucked up, man.

5475
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:18,160
That is so fucked up.

5476
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:20,640
It's lagged.

5477
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:22,380
How do I even play this game anymore?

5478
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:23,140
Gotta get a dongle.

5479
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:29,340
If we all leave the game before turn 25, LM never wins.

5480
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:31,600
Oh, my God.

5481
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:32,360
We have to.

5482
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:36,800
He'll fight the bots and claim it as a W.

5483
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:37,780
Yeah, but he fought.

5484
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:40,440
But then winning against bots is even more sad.

5485
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:42,020
That's true.

5486
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:42,700
You know what?

5487
02:29:42,700 --> 02:29:43,120
You're not wrong.

5488
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:46,900
You can't really parade that around as a victory too much.

5489
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:49,760
Yeah, he can't brag about winning if it's against bots.

5490
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:53,100
He might though, but you really can't.

5491
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:55,720
LM, we miss you.

5492
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:59,280
I don't think he's heard us.

5493
02:29:59,540 --> 02:29:59,900
Okay.

5494
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:01,560
I'm back.

5495
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:02,140
What did I miss?

5496
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:03,620
We talked so positive about things.

5497
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:05,500
We were making up that.

5498
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,500
Did you scheme against me?

5499
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:08,060
I bet you did.

5500
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:08,340
No.

5501
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:09,060
Of course not.

5502
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,400
We would never do that to you.

5503
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:11,660
I know what you did.

5504
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:12,020
The delay.

5505
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:13,880
No, the delay.

5506
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,460
That's actually insane.

5507
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:18,720
I can't believe that happened.

5508
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:19,680
Okay, I have 14.

5509
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:21,400
I need...

5510
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:22,640
How much do I need?

5511
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:25,640
I thought you were like...

5512
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:28,260
I thought you were like fucking around.

5513
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:29,920
Honestly.

5514
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:31,400
Whose turn is it?

5515
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:32,020
It's mine.

5516
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:34,880
I'm trying to figure out where I want to go.

5517
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:37,500
Oh, you are going to chance time, right?

5518
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:39,160
Oh, you're not going to...

5519
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:41,340
Are you running past chance time?

5520
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:41,880
Did you go too far?

5521
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:43,260
No, I can loop around.

5522
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:45,800
Yeah, I can loop.

5523
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:48,120
I can do a loop-de-loop until I hit it.

5524
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:50,940
Dude, I love that song.

5525
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:52,320
Oh, I can't loop!

5526
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,680
No, because the gate's not open!

5527
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:56,780
Oh...

5528
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:58,300
Oh...

5529
02:30:58,300 --> 02:31:00,700
That was a rollercoaster of emotions.

5530
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:01,640
It's alright.

5531
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:03,560
Oh no, you're one behind.

5532
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:04,940
Yeah, I'm one behind.

5533
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:08,080
It's alright, I can loop around.

5534
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:10,200
It's rigged!

5535
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:14,260
I have five turns of this.

5536
02:31:14,340 --> 02:31:15,200
I can loop around.

5537
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:17,500
It's true.

5538
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:20,620
I will keep looping until I get it.

5539
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:22,700
Everyone has to throw shit out.

5540
02:31:22,820 --> 02:31:23,880
God, my golden pipe.

5541
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:26,620
You know what?

5542
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,060
I don't need it.

5543
02:31:28,220 --> 02:31:29,700
I want the pipe.

5544
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:32,720
Call chain chomps to make you starve.

5545
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:35,200
I don't think I need that.

5546
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:36,480
What?

5547
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:37,220
I want the pipe!

5548
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:40,700
I feel like it's the weakest thing here.

5549
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:42,740
Alright.

5550
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:44,060
This key is nice.

5551
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:44,760
The key is nice.

5552
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,820
The key, I'm gonna use it so I can go to the other one.

5553
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:50,120
Use the key to go to the swap space.

5554
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:52,240
Another chance time in there.

5555
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,220
That's your best shot.

5556
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:54,520
I feel like that's your best shot.

5557
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:57,520
We're not talking to you, Elem.

5558
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:00,020
You're not part of this group anymore, Elem.

5559
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:01,020
You're not...

5560
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,460
You're not part of this discussion.

5561
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:05,580
This is North America.

5562
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:07,440
Let me back in.

5563
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,380
I want back in.

5564
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,900
Let you back in.

5565
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,380
Give your star to the poor.

5566
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:14,040
I can't even buy the star.

5567
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:16,740
Oh, I can buy it.

5568
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:20,020
You're feeding us for chance time.

5569
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:20,420
That's all.

5570
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:23,460
Just giving us more time to do chance.

5571
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:24,300
Wait.

5572
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:27,740
Stars don't matter at this point.

5573
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:28,740
Nobody's catching up.

5574
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:30,920
Everyone needs to do chance.

5575
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:34,080
You gotta take this going down and then you can hook left.

5576
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:35,000
Wait, really?

5577
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:35,960
Yeah.

5578
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:38,320
Wait, really?

5579
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:40,280
You trolled me?

5580
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:42,960
No, you believed me.

5581
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,060
Why did you believe him?

5582
02:32:44,140 --> 02:32:45,800
Why would he want you to win?

5583
02:32:46,860 --> 02:32:48,520
I'm down here too.

5584
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:50,160
I can loop again.

5585
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:51,700
You trolled.

5586
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:55,480
I believed you.

5587
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:56,240
Why?

5588
02:32:56,860 --> 02:32:57,500
Why?

5589
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:01,000
Dude, this is a GG for me.

5590
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:02,060
A one?

5591
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:03,760
Oh my god.

5592
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:06,920
This is actually insane.

5593
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,300
This is...

5594
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,540
I'm not even playing the game.

5595
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:14,160
The game just doesn't want me to play it.

5596
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:15,080
Very good.

5597
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:16,800
Very good.

5598
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:21,880
I don't think I could do this bad if I intentionally tried to lose the game.

5599
02:33:21,880 --> 02:33:23,760
There's still four more turns, Sykkuno.

5600
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:24,840
You can turn it around.

5601
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:32,260
I don't even think I could lose this badly if I intentionally was like, I'm gonna throw this game as hard as I possibly can.

5602
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:34,820
And it wouldn't have gone this badly.

5603
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:36,000
Lock it in, brother.

5604
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:36,700
Lock it in.

5605
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:38,560
You can still get a chance time.

5606
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:42,000
We're all relying on chance now.

5607
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:46,960
And actually what you can do too is if you land on someone, it's battle minigame.

5608
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:48,440
So you can fight them for all their money.

5609
02:33:48,820 --> 02:33:50,220
Yeah, but we don't want money.

5610
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:51,200
We want the stars.

5611
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:54,380
Yeah, money doesn't matter anymore.

5612
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:57,280
Money is just a cosmetic at this point.

5613
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:00,340
Dude, let me tell you.

5614
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:01,800
I've had a lot of money.

5615
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:03,720
And it's done on me.

5616
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:04,340
And then the revolution.

5617
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:05,780
That twice.

5618
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:06,700
That just once.

5619
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:10,700
I've lost over 150 coins this game.

5620
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:12,440
I'd be at 300 coins if I didn't get it.

5621
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:13,320
Wait, that's good for you though, right?

5622
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:14,160
Because now it turns...

5623
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,640
Oh, shit.

5624
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,480
Now you can steal.

5625
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:21,000
So I will be attempting to steal from...

5626
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,660
Oh, you don't need to do that.

5627
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:24,880
Maybe I'll take from Doki since she's got one.

5628
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:27,380
You should do that.

5629
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:29,020
Nah, money belts.

5630
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:30,080
This one's so bad.

5631
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:32,540
Oh, wait.

5632
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:33,100
This one does...

5633
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:34,440
I hate this one.

5634
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:35,820
This one sucks.

5635
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,340
Dude, this one actually sucks.

5636
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:39,520
Why?

5637
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:41,500
Give me the money.

5638
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:43,020
Now I understand why.

5639
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,880
Dude, it's so annoying.

5640
02:34:46,380 --> 02:34:47,060
Okay, here we go.

5641
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,220
Lock it in.

5642
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:49,960
Lock it down.

5643
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:53,480
Remember, money doesn't matter.

5644
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:55,400
Oh, the money matters.

5645
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:57,060
The lag.

5646
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:58,800
The lag.

5647
02:34:59,240 --> 02:34:59,600
There it is.

5648
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:03,020
I don't know if we should let the British guy host.

5649
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:05,620
Yeah, why did we let him host the lobby?

5650
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,200
Why did we let the British guy host?

5651
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:09,700
Wait a minute.

5652
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:11,580
I let the British guy host.

5653
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:13,000
You're right.

5654
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:14,900
That's actually a really good point.

5655
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:17,360
People should restart the lobby right now, guys.

5656
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:18,240
I can't even play the game.

5657
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:20,580
Let the British guy host.

5658
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:23,320
Two hours into it, we're like, wait, why is he hosting?

5659
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:24,440
Why did we let him host?

5660
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:27,260
You know what's crazy?

5661
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,940
I was saying how I had really bad delay.

5662
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:31,900
I realize I actually don't have any delay because I'm the host.

5663
02:35:31,980 --> 02:35:32,240
I realize I actually don't have any delay because I'm the host.

5664
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,800
Yeah, how many of you have delay?

5665
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:37,820
There is absolutely zero lag.

5666
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:38,860
There is absolutely zero lag.

5667
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:40,060
I hope you've been having fun.

5668
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,200
Four turns left.

5669
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:44,180
Zero stars.

5670
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:45,980
I've lost over 150 coins.

5671
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:47,960
Don't worry.

5672
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:49,580
It will be different this time.

5673
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:50,700
It will be different this time.

5674
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:53,980
I got nothing going for me.

5675
02:35:54,060 --> 02:35:55,520
It will be different, I swear.

5676
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:57,060
This is it.

5677
02:35:57,140 --> 02:35:58,480
This is your time to shine.

5678
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:00,780
Triple eights?

5679
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:02,860
If you get three eights, that would clutch it.

5680
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:04,640
Oh, a 20.

5681
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:08,800
We've got to loop around and steal stars from Elem on the daytime steal, I think.

5682
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:10,420
No, no, no, we don't need to do that.

5683
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:11,320
We don't need to do all that.

5684
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:14,140
Guys, we don't need that.

5685
02:36:14,180 --> 02:36:16,600
We just kind of pick and choose.

5686
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:17,920
We just need to do chance.

5687
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:19,140
One more chance.

5688
02:36:19,820 --> 02:36:20,640
But guys, think about it.

5689
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:22,220
What if we stole all of Sykkuno's money?

5690
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:23,060
That could be a better option.

5691
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,860
I thought money was just a concept.

5692
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:27,220
Yeah, money is just a concept for you.

5693
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:29,480
Right now, man.

5694
02:36:29,640 --> 02:36:37,520
Because, well, I'm concerned because Chills is going to steal one star from me and Sykkuno's got 167 coins so that means he can steal three stars from me which means I'm going to be left with like two stars.

5695
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:40,080
You take one from everybody.

5696
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:43,080
Yeah, so you can't lose more than one star.

5697
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:46,620
I'm going to say you're borderline unlosable right now.

5698
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:47,500
Very good, very good.

5699
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:51,340
We'd have to try and lose the game and you wouldn't be able to lose the game.

5700
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:52,780
Very good, very good, very good.

5701
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,540
I like how you're just like crushing my numbers, checking my numbers.

5702
02:36:57,060 --> 02:36:58,500
I'm just crushing those guys and I'm concerned.

5703
02:36:59,440 --> 02:37:00,600
I don't need this.

5704
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,800
I mean, surely I get a star by now.

5705
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:03,980
Get this out of here.

5706
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:07,160
So, like, the pool at the bottom, how much does it cost to steal?

5707
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:08,340
23, 50.

5708
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:09,620
I gotta get something.

5709
02:37:09,640 --> 02:37:10,040
50?

5710
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,820
Downstairs?

5711
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:13,560
Do I have an item?

5712
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:14,500
Oh, I do have an item.

5713
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:15,880
But it's not anything I need.

5714
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:19,060
A six.

5715
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:20,300
A humble six.

5716
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:22,620
Wait, what if I...

5717
02:37:22,620 --> 02:37:23,220
I've got an idea.

5718
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:28,720
If it's available, I've got an idea.

5719
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:30,620
I buy a warp block.

5720
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:36,800
And it means that anyone who gets near the chance thing, I'll remove you from there.

5721
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:37,860
And then put myself there.

5722
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:39,480
And we let him win?

5723
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:42,180
And steal more stars for you.

5724
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:42,680
Wow.

5725
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:49,840
As long as you don't hit the happening spot, we're gonna steal one from him.

5726
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:54,120
If each of us steal a star from him, he won't have six anymore.

5727
02:37:54,820 --> 02:37:55,340
True.

5728
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:56,860
We all have keys, right?

5729
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:58,820
If I roll low here, then it's GG.

5730
02:37:58,820 --> 02:37:59,420
We don't need to do a lot.

5731
02:37:59,820 --> 02:38:01,300
I need to roll like an 11.

5732
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:04,400
Five gets you a triple dice block, right?

5733
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:05,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5734
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,300
Why did you go right?

5735
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:09,620
It's so GG.

5736
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:12,680
If you go left, you have a skeleton key to do the swap.

5737
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:15,120
But he can also go the big one.

5738
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:15,860
He can go the big one with...

5739
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:16,700
Oh, this isn't too bad.

5740
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:19,540
You have a key.

5741
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:21,540
And you're gonna go straight up?

5742
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:22,260
This is potential.

5743
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,520
Get keys for days.

5744
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:25,200
Oh no.

5745
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:27,680
See, this is so bad for me.

5746
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:32,000
If Elim wants to be super evil, he can swap with Sykkuno.

5747
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:34,020
When does the good luck happen?

5748
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:35,080
What the hell is this?

5749
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:36,880
Oh, yes.

5750
02:38:38,020 --> 02:38:38,600
It's time!

5751
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:40,800
When do I feel like I have a chance?

5752
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:41,680
You don't, unfortunately.

5753
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:46,700
If I stole from Doki, that makes me a bad guy, right?

5754
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:47,780
No, if each of us...

5755
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:51,560
I'm gonna steal from Elim too, so we can each distribute the wealth.

5756
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:54,060
So you guys are anti-British.

5757
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:54,360
It's okay.

5758
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:56,060
We can distribute the wealth.

5759
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:58,560
I'm putting the tea in the arbor.

5760
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:02,300
We're getting rid of the tea.

5761
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:03,540
No.

5762
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:05,220
Guys, please.

5763
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:06,260
Not the tea.

5764
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:07,320
Anything but the tea.

5765
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:10,320
You're gonna walk into a sore throat forever.

5766
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:11,380
No.

5767
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:12,700
No.

5768
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:14,880
You'll be fine.

5769
02:39:14,940 --> 02:39:16,480
Just walk it off.

5770
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:21,040
But not for me.

5771
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:22,340
You'll be fine.

5772
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,300
You have the monarchy.

5773
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:26,500
I don't even know what the monarchy is.

5774
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:28,080
Oh, yeah.

5775
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:30,320
Guys, we can just punch Elim in the face.

5776
02:39:30,460 --> 02:39:30,720
That's true.

5777
02:39:30,820 --> 02:39:31,380
Get him out.

5778
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:31,900
Get him out.

5779
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:36,200
Where is he?

5780
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:37,680
It's like Feather Party.

5781
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:39,280
Get him out.

5782
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:40,220
Feather Party?

5783
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:42,800
It's like the jumping game from Feather Party.

5784
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:43,340
Oh, God.

5785
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:46,880
Oh, my God.

5786
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:49,500
Screw you.

5787
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:50,840
You are so annoying.

5788
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:52,880
I can't even walk.

5789
02:39:53,060 --> 02:39:55,240
Do we just want to try and go for the three wins?

5790
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:57,020
I don't think we can, do we?

5791
02:39:58,600 --> 02:39:59,360
Let's all just win here.

5792
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:00,300
No, no, no.

5793
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:02,720
Let's all win here.

5794
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:04,460
No punching, guys.

5795
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:04,980
No punching.

5796
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:07,900
Up one and then we win.

5797
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:09,660
Right side, right side, right side.

5798
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:10,460
Yeah, guys.

5799
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:10,900
Let's go.

5800
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:13,740
What honor among fighters.

5801
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:15,180
Let's go, everybody.

5802
02:40:15,380 --> 02:40:16,320
I feel like we're all winners.

5803
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:18,620
I feel like we're all winners there.

5804
02:40:18,620 --> 02:40:19,720
What's happening here, guys?

5805
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:21,200
We're all winners.

5806
02:40:21,620 --> 02:40:22,460
N-A, N-A, N-A.

5807
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:23,920
Honestly, Elem, I tried to kill him.

5808
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:24,380
It didn't work.

5809
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:25,420
You saw him.

5810
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:26,480
I was punching him everywhere.

5811
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:27,980
You didn't start one punch, you bitch.

5812
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:29,140
No, I punched him off.

5813
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:30,160
I was the one that...

5814
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,760
Me and Doki were fighting to the death.

5815
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,960
It was Zangief all over me.

5816
02:40:34,480 --> 02:40:36,540
We were grappling him nonstop.

5817
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:38,520
We met you with the Stone Cold Steve Austin stunner.

5818
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:39,260
That was amazing.

5819
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:41,120
The Zangief.

5820
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:42,620
You just keep grappling.

5821
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:44,880
You're actually not in a bad position.

5822
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:46,600
Listen, if you take that warp all the way up...

5823
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:48,900
If you can roll like a 10...

5824
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:51,220
If you can roll a 10 this turn...

5825
02:40:51,220 --> 02:40:51,240
GG.

5826
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:53,640
No, no, if you can roll a 10 somehow...

5827
02:40:54,820 --> 02:40:56,880
That 5 was 5 plus question mark.

5828
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:57,820
Without using your custom block.

5829
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:02,460
I definitely have to do at least one roll without using the custom block.

5830
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:05,300
I'll use the custom block for a 10 after.

5831
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:06,600
What is 5 plus question mark?

5832
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:07,880
We gotta hope for a large number.

5833
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:09,580
5 question mark?

5834
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:12,220
I don't know.

5835
02:41:12,260 --> 02:41:13,500
I'd have to be looking at the map.

5836
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:14,860
Oh, you're right.

5837
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:17,240
Can you even custom block to the versus space right now?

5838
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:18,340
I can chance it.

5839
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:18,960
Never mind.

5840
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:20,360
Are you doing it?

5841
02:41:20,380 --> 02:41:21,000
Chance it up, man.

5842
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:21,640
Chance it up.

5843
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:22,620
Alright, let's go.

5844
02:41:23,980 --> 02:41:24,600
Don't chance it up.

5845
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:25,100
Don't chance it up.

5846
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:31,200
Doki, do you want to know a cheat?

5847
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:32,280
Do you want to know a cheat?

5848
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:33,420
Okay.

5849
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:35,900
So, you can go for the full swap.

5850
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:37,920
That 5 for 1, which you'd have to time.

5851
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:38,920
Which could happen.

5852
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:47,500
Or, if you keep spamming A, the minute you get into the chance time, it will automatically put one star to the left.

5853
02:41:48,100 --> 02:41:49,820
As the middle one.

5854
02:41:50,060 --> 02:41:50,280
You cringe.

5855
02:41:50,460 --> 02:41:50,900
Fuck.

5856
02:41:51,900 --> 02:41:52,640
I'm sorry.

5857
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:54,080
Can you explain that again?

5858
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:55,580
Absolutely.

5859
02:41:55,740 --> 02:42:00,220
So, you know how it's the middle one spins, and you can kind of pick it, and just hope for the best?

5860
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:09,640
If you spam A as it's loading in, so as you're going through the menus, if you spam A, it will always put an arrow moving to the left.

5861
02:42:09,720 --> 02:42:10,220
Or moving to the right.

5862
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:11,600
But it will always put an arrow in contact.

5863
02:42:12,100 --> 02:42:13,740
I knew he was the Mario guy.

5864
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:15,380
I knew he was the Mario guy.

5865
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:18,640
Okay, so I just go in, and just spam A.

5866
02:42:19,420 --> 02:42:21,080
Yes, but that would only be for one star.

5867
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,540
It would only be for one star.

5868
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:26,340
I'm gonna risk it.

5869
02:42:26,380 --> 02:42:28,040
I'm gonna risk it for the biscuit.

5870
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:29,140
You want the full swap?

5871
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:32,300
Or do I do it for the people, and steal...

5872
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:34,680
Okay, who is this?

5873
02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:37,740
Make sure you got the right number.

5874
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:39,980
It's time to roll.

5875
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:41,600
It's time to roll.

5876
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:41,800
I'm good.

5877
02:42:43,140 --> 02:42:43,700
Duel.

5878
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:46,200
Oh.

5879
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:48,080
I'm scared.

5880
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:49,680
Guys, I'm scared.

5881
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:52,000
Guys, I'm scared.

5882
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:52,760
It's time.

5883
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:54,560
Wait, is that it?

5884
02:42:54,580 --> 02:42:55,900
That might actually be it.

5885
02:42:55,960 --> 02:42:56,800
Yeah, because I have...

5886
02:42:56,800 --> 02:43:01,820
I'm hiding.

5887
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:02,260
I'm hiding.

5888
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:05,740
Oh my god, that was the craziest roll I've ever seen.

5889
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:09,120
That was insane.

5890
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:09,500
That was insane.

5891
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:15,320
Good luck, man.

5892
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:18,100
Oh boy.

5893
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:20,820
If you take my stuff, we'll never talk again.

5894
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:25,940
If you take my stuff, we'll never talk again.

5895
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:29,680
If you take my stuff, we'll talk again.

5896
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:33,160
I could actually be last place here.

5897
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:37,940
Yeah, you could definitely put yourself in the last for zero stars.

5898
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,240
Okay.

5899
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:42,560
It's like you wouldn't do this.

5900
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:44,080
Oh wait, it's not even Psyche, it's Doki.

5901
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:45,040
Yeah, it's me.

5902
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:47,040
But we all have a chance to do it.

5903
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:48,600
Alright.

5904
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:50,120
Oh yeah.

5905
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:52,740
So it's after yourself.

5906
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:54,220
You don't need a...

5907
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:55,560
Doki, you don't need to do it.

5908
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:56,580
Just get it wrong.

5909
02:43:59,020 --> 02:43:59,420
Perfect.

5910
02:44:00,980 --> 02:44:03,600
I say choose the other person and then spice for the end.

5911
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:05,160
That's true.

5912
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:07,800
Okay, I'll let luck take this.

5913
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:10,820
Whoever gets it, good luck to all of you guys.

5914
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:12,060
Surely...

5915
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:15,020
No, you're gonna give him money from me.

5916
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:16,600
Please, please give me money.

5917
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:18,900
What if he gets one of his stars?

5918
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:19,900
Please.

5919
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:21,720
I will actually lose my money.

5920
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:24,960
He's a woman-hater.

5921
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:26,180
He's a woman-hater, Doki.

5922
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:26,780
No, I'm a woman-lover.

5923
02:44:27,380 --> 02:44:27,960
You're rewarding him.

5924
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:31,920
Doki, I love you so much.

5925
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:32,580
Please reward me.

5926
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:34,400
Doki, don't do it.

5927
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:36,760
I don't know if she even can control this.

5928
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:37,440
Oh, my God.

5929
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:38,460
Oh, my God.

5930
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:43,940
It doesn't change all that much.

5931
02:44:44,060 --> 02:44:45,620
It doesn't change.

5932
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:47,040
Oh, thank God.

5933
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:47,660
We survived.

5934
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:49,200
It was clenching.

5935
02:44:49,320 --> 02:44:50,840
Oh, my God.

5936
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:51,680
Yes.

5937
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:53,240
She's got another custom dice.

5938
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:55,140
We can do this again.

5939
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:56,620
I can keep doing this.

5940
02:44:57,060 --> 02:44:59,340
We can all keep doing this, guys.

5941
02:45:00,660 --> 02:45:02,160
You'll never escape, I tell him.

5942
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:04,320
And then I'm gonna wall-block.

5943
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:06,240
I'm gonna wall-block some people.

5944
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:07,080
Here we go.

5945
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:08,740
Thank you.

5946
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:09,860
Oh, okay.

5947
02:45:10,100 --> 02:45:11,560
You know that's random, right?

5948
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:12,700
You know that's random.

5949
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:14,200
Oh, no.

5950
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:18,480
I literally went back like two squares.

5951
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:19,680
All in.

5952
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,200
All in.

5953
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:21,180
Dude, land on him.

5954
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:21,560
All in.

5955
02:45:21,620 --> 02:45:23,880
Land on him and he can grab stuff.

5956
02:45:24,020 --> 02:45:24,200
Yeah.

5957
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:26,600
Do it if you have the guts.

5958
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:28,840
I got some spice in this game.

5959
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:30,040
Oh, my God.

5960
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:30,900
We're going through history.

5961
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:33,700
Joe, do you remember when I said I'm gonna leave you with nothing?

5962
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:35,760
I'm leaving with you with nothing, bitch.

5963
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:36,600
How about one coin?

5964
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:37,560
Just leave me with one coin.

5965
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:39,000
I'm leaving you all in, bro.

5966
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:39,920
Here we go.

5967
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:40,720
All in.

5968
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:45,080
But how am I gonna pay my alimony to Peach?

5969
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:48,680
Dude, I'm like Weevil Underwood when he takes me and rips up a card right now.

5970
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:49,760
I'm going crazy.

5971
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:51,600
I don't think Weevil rips up a card.

5972
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:52,760
I think he throws it in the ocean.

5973
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:56,540
Yeah, you have Kaiba rips up a card and Weevil's just like...

5974
02:45:57,320 --> 02:45:59,340
Yeah, Weevil's like, yo, can I see your Exodia?

5975
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:00,140
And he's like, sure.

5976
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:03,520
And then he throws it in the ocean and Joey jumps in because Joey's a real one.

5977
02:46:04,180 --> 02:46:04,900
Joey's like, what?

5978
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,740
Oh, this is only a 50-foot drop.

5979
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:07,240
I'll be fine.

5980
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:08,200
I'm good with this.

5981
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:08,780
I can do this one.

5982
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:09,220
I can do this.

5983
02:46:09,320 --> 02:46:09,660
I'm fine.

5984
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:10,100
Okay.

5985
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:12,140
Dude, Elm's got Host Advantage, though.

5986
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:12,840
This is kinda bad.

5987
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:14,320
Guys, so we're all gonna plug, right?

5988
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:16,360
Here in 24, right, guys?

5989
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:18,120
Oh, I'm plugging.

5990
02:46:19,220 --> 02:46:20,200
It's not over yet.

5991
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:22,240
Shields being cringed.

5992
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:22,900
Shields being cringed.

5993
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:26,500
Oh, if anybody falls, it's over.

5994
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:29,400
Oh, it's neck and neck.

5995
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:30,200
Wait, no.

5996
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:31,420
Elm has the Host Advantage.

5997
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:32,100
Right here.

5998
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:34,140
Oh, it is close.

5999
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:36,460
Oh, they both waited.

6000
02:46:36,580 --> 02:46:38,040
Oh, they both waited again.

6001
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,180
Oh, they're both waiting.

6002
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,400
They're so patient.

6003
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:42,120
Dude.

6004
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:46,380
But Elm has literally the Host Advantage.

6005
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:46,780
I know.

6006
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:48,120
I think he's gonna beat me by a drive.

6007
02:46:48,140 --> 02:46:49,740
He's gonna beat you by a ping.

6008
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:51,960
I think I landed first.

6009
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:52,240
Dude.

6010
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:53,380
I landed first.

6011
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:56,920
Dude, Elm lost everything.

6012
02:46:57,460 --> 02:46:58,580
Elm lost everything.

6013
02:46:58,700 --> 02:46:59,280
He lost everything.

6014
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:00,300
I'm gonna take everything.

6015
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:06,260
I've got nothing left.

6016
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:07,340
Oh my god.

6017
02:47:07,420 --> 02:47:07,480
I've got nothing left.

6018
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:08,120
Oh, you don't.

6019
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:11,100
I was gonna say your Skeleton Key, you can go and steal another star.

6020
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:13,900
No we take it to the stars.

6021
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:14,740
No.

6022
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:17,960
Wait, Cyclio, you have a chance too.

6023
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:19,240
Yeah, you have a chance.

6024
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:20,880
You can take more than you can really.

6025
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,900
I can roll at least above an eight.

6026
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:28,620
Son of a- Oh, you still have two turns.

6027
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:29,320
You still have two turns.

6028
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:32,220
He doesn't want me to play the game.

6029
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:34,880
We just have to make it back nighttime.

6030
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:35,720
I don't understand.

6031
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:38,720
It just doesn't let me play the game.

6032
02:47:38,840 --> 02:47:39,040
Lock it in.

6033
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:40,740
Lock it down, brethren.

6034
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:43,000
This luck is insanely terrible.

6035
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:44,340
Don't worry.

6036
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:45,040
The bonus starts.

6037
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:45,700
The bonus starts.

6038
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:47,040
We'll be there to clutch it.

6039
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:47,720
Yeah, surely.

6040
02:47:47,860 --> 02:47:50,900
Does it make more sense to make it daytime now?

6041
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:52,060
Oh, he doesn't even let you.

6042
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:52,300
Okay.

6043
02:47:53,100 --> 02:47:53,580
Oh, wait.

6044
02:47:53,580 --> 02:47:53,760
Why?

6045
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:57,220
Because he's got to go two turns to the other side.

6046
02:47:58,060 --> 02:48:01,140
So on turn 25, if nothing changes, it's gonna be GG.

6047
02:48:01,260 --> 02:48:03,660
Wait, you can look at all these wonderful things.

6048
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:04,360
Get that custom block.

6049
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:06,300
Oh, and then look at that skeleton key.

6050
02:48:06,820 --> 02:48:07,960
Dude, that's impossible.

6051
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:09,200
It's moving so fast.

6052
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:10,400
And the lag is...

6053
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:12,260
Hey, this is not the skeleton key.

6054
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:13,720
I'm gonna say it, bro.

6055
02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:19,120
Alright, so we're all blaming LM for hosting in the UK.

6056
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:20,000
Guys, all I can say...

6057
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,940
Guys, I want to point out.

6058
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:22,540
Shields are four stars.

6059
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:24,240
Can we just acknowledge that right now?

6060
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:25,480
Five stars.

6061
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:26,500
You stole from me.

6062
02:48:27,220 --> 02:48:27,520
You're a thief.

6063
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:29,520
I would never.

6064
02:48:29,620 --> 02:48:30,420
Doki, I would never.

6065
02:48:30,580 --> 02:48:32,060
You literally stole from me.

6066
02:48:32,380 --> 02:48:33,660
Dude, Shield forced my hand.

6067
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:34,700
He forced my hand.

6068
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,540
What was I meant to do?

6069
02:48:36,740 --> 02:48:38,180
I have that much power?

6070
02:48:38,860 --> 02:48:41,240
That's the most insane bad luck I've ever seen.

6071
02:48:42,700 --> 02:48:44,100
Okay, I need two tens now, game.

6072
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:48,640
I thought the last time I played this was the worst luck I'd ever have, and here I am.

6073
02:48:49,480 --> 02:48:50,240
Hey, I mean...

6074
02:48:51,440 --> 02:48:52,420
Wait, that's huge.

6075
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:53,760
16.

6076
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:54,640
That's too much.

6077
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:56,680
He misses it, right?

6078
02:48:57,220 --> 02:48:58,660
Yeah, you're too far.

6079
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:00,260
Oh...

6080
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:02,100
I'm really not happy with this.

6081
02:49:02,300 --> 02:49:02,820
No.

6082
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:06,900
They should say cooperation, but they don't every time.

6083
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:09,300
Yeah, you're way too far.

6084
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:10,600
You're way too far.

6085
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:11,860
You can buy another triple dice.

6086
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:14,400
You could warp block, and maybe come back.

6087
02:49:14,860 --> 02:49:16,000
No, I go custom.

6088
02:49:16,180 --> 02:49:17,280
I pray to the gods.

6089
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:24,760
See, I might even take the warp height or the warp eye down, maybe?

6090
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:28,000
Oh, and then do another loop.

6091
02:49:28,120 --> 02:49:28,340
Oh, and then do another loop.

6092
02:49:28,340 --> 02:49:29,540
Yeah, you can do another loop there.

6093
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:33,180
I gotta just view the board.

6094
02:49:33,460 --> 02:49:36,220
Okay, so you're gonna buy the star next round, right?

6095
02:49:37,820 --> 02:49:39,520
I'm not even caring about the stars.

6096
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:41,540
I don't know if Sykkuno cares about the stars.

6097
02:49:41,820 --> 02:49:43,380
Sykkuno, you're gonna buy the star next round, right?

6098
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:44,240
Sykkuno, you're gonna buy the star next round, right?

6099
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:45,000
Am I?

6100
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:46,360
I don't know.

6101
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:47,520
I don't know where it is.

6102
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:48,440
Am I gonna make it there?

6103
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:50,240
He's just been focusing on chance.

6104
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:51,740
He doesn't care anymore.

6105
02:49:53,060 --> 02:49:54,220
I'll be honest.

6106
02:49:54,340 --> 02:49:56,540
There's almost nothing I can do in this game.

6107
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:57,560
No, you'll be fine.

6108
02:49:57,620 --> 02:49:58,520
You're gonna be fine, man.

6109
02:49:59,240 --> 02:50:02,920
There's literally borderline nothing I can do to change the outcome of the match.

6110
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:07,340
So you save your custom block, and then you try and get into the chance time area.

6111
02:50:07,940 --> 02:50:08,320
Oh.

6112
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:10,800
That's the hope, and that's about it.

6113
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:13,220
Even that, I need to roll higher.

6114
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:15,800
You do need like a 7 or 8 next time.

6115
02:50:16,360 --> 02:50:16,980
Here we go.

6116
02:50:18,820 --> 02:50:19,700
It's just...

6117
02:50:19,700 --> 02:50:21,280
He's lost all hope.

6118
02:50:21,740 --> 02:50:23,560
He's actually lost all hope.

6119
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:25,640
You broke this man!

6120
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:26,840
Look what happened!

6121
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:31,200
Dude, the last time I played this, I went 25 turns without a single star.

6122
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:32,100
That is true.

6123
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:33,100
That is unfortunately true.

6124
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:34,600
It has happened again.

6125
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:38,480
Alright guys, I am willing to sacrifice for NA.

6126
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:41,820
No, do not talk to me.

6127
02:50:41,860 --> 02:50:42,740
You took my stars.

6128
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:44,060
Do not talk to me.

6129
02:50:45,960 --> 02:50:49,520
But then by proximity, Shield has now taken them as well.

6130
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:50,720
So really, who did steal them?

6131
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:51,280
You know?

6132
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:52,320
Ellum.

6133
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:52,980
That's what I'm wondering.

6134
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:57,840
You had your own free will to not do that.

6135
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:01,120
Get it, Doki.

6136
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,460
You just punch these blocks, okay?

6137
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:03,820
Get your anger out on the blocks, man.

6138
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:04,960
Quick, Doki.

6139
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:06,340
That's what you get.

6140
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:09,880
That's what you get, Doki.

6141
02:51:10,340 --> 02:51:13,340
Oh my god, he's the swimming hitter.

6142
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:14,220
That's what you get.

6143
02:51:15,940 --> 02:51:17,220
That's what you get, Doki.

6144
02:51:17,820 --> 02:51:18,720
That's what you get.

6145
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:19,420
That's what you get.

6146
02:51:20,420 --> 02:51:21,580
Dude, he's trolling.

6147
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:23,620
That's what you get, Doki.

6148
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:25,360
That's what you get.

6149
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:27,380
Self-defense.

6150
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:28,520
That's what you get.

6151
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:31,520
Dude, you're gonna traumatize Toad.

6152
02:51:31,880 --> 02:51:32,700
That's what you get.

6153
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:34,860
Watch this.

6154
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,600
What if you beat the shit out of Doki?

6155
02:51:37,720 --> 02:51:38,720
This is what you deserve.

6156
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:41,920
Don't call anybody, Toad.

6157
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:47,460
Remember that one Russian dash cam video where like four people in outfits got out and they just started attacking each other?

6158
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:49,000
And you know what?

6159
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:50,860
Let me beat the shit out of Toad while I'm here as well.

6160
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:53,580
Somebody stop him!

6161
02:51:53,820 --> 02:51:54,560
He's gonna kill him!

6162
02:51:55,420 --> 02:51:57,280
Can I turn around and still beat your ass again?

6163
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:00,340
Wow, what a lovely Sunday drive that was.

6164
02:52:00,780 --> 02:52:02,080
Alright, I needed that win.

6165
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,660
I don't know what I needed it for.

6166
02:52:03,820 --> 02:52:04,840
It's gonna make no difference.

6167
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:07,380
He just wants to feel something.

6168
02:52:07,700 --> 02:52:09,940
I have zero stars after 25 turns.

6169
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:11,420
After two and a...

6170
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:12,800
After three hours!

6171
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:18,200
I straight up feel like I could intend to eventually try to throw a game and I wouldn't have done this bad.

6172
02:52:18,720 --> 02:52:20,700
But you're gonna get a star right now.

6173
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:22,340
Like none of this adds up to me.

6174
02:52:22,560 --> 02:52:24,160
You're like changing right now.

6175
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:29,960
She's gonna triple block and steal your one chance at a fucking star.

6176
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:30,920
No way.

6177
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:33,800
There's no way she takes the one star I have a chance at.

6178
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:34,180
Please.

6179
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:35,980
It's been three hours.

6180
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:38,820
It's been three hours, Doki.

6181
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:40,280
Please, just one star.

6182
02:52:41,700 --> 02:52:44,180
Just one star is three hours.

6183
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:45,480
I don't wanna be last.

6184
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:46,220
I'm sorry.

6185
02:52:47,300 --> 02:52:48,900
It's been three hours.

6186
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:51,080
Just one star.

6187
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:53,980
It's you or me and I don't wanna be last.

6188
02:52:57,060 --> 02:52:58,540
Just one star.

6189
02:52:59,060 --> 02:52:59,860
I'm sorry.

6190
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:03,080
I just want one.

6191
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:05,440
Actually, and you have a chance to get to the chance time area.

6192
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:06,180
You roll a high number.

6193
02:53:09,180 --> 02:53:10,360
It's you or me.

6194
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:10,940
I'm sorry.

6195
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:12,360
There is no way.

6196
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:12,480
Please.

6197
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,300
It's been three hours.

6198
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:17,640
At least you've seen some stars.

6199
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:18,820
You used to have some.

6200
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:19,720
I've never had any.

6201
02:53:19,880 --> 02:53:21,500
Yes, so that's even better.

6202
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:24,120
You never had to experience what I had.

6203
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:27,580
I peaked and I don't wanna fall off, Sykkuno.

6204
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:28,780
I don't wanna.

6205
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:30,880
It's too late for you.

6206
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:31,540
It's too late.

6207
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:32,540
Give me a chance.

6208
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:34,700
Oh, Doki.

6209
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:40,700
Dude, in total, guys, he's played about six hours of this game now and still has not had one star.

6210
02:53:40,700 --> 02:53:41,640
Still hasn't gotten a star yet.

6211
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:43,640
Hey, look, you get another star.

6212
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:44,920
Oh, I had a chance to get a chance.

6213
02:53:45,800 --> 02:53:46,200
Yes.

6214
02:53:47,340 --> 02:53:48,180
This is it.

6215
02:53:49,380 --> 02:53:51,560
It's literally, you get a one.

6216
02:53:52,100 --> 02:53:53,160
He gets a one.

6217
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:54,580
Is that chance time?

6218
02:53:54,900 --> 02:53:56,020
Doki, that might be chance time.

6219
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:56,820
No way.

6220
02:53:57,020 --> 02:54:00,920
Is it exactly a chance?

6221
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:05,280
There's no way I slowly bleed out and don't win, right?

6222
02:54:05,400 --> 02:54:05,660
Sure.

6223
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:07,500
I mean, there's no way that I slowly bleed out.

6224
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:09,600
It is.

6225
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:13,420
Doki, I think you mash the A button.

6226
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:16,260
So you guarantee to take one star in the pot.

6227
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:17,100
Or you random it again.

6228
02:54:17,180 --> 02:54:17,480
Up to you.

6229
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:19,560
I say go for the big gamble.

6230
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:22,160
The big gamble will be so much cooler.

6231
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:23,220
Oh yeah, that's true.

6232
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:27,640
Wait, so you're stealing all my money and then you're gonna steal all my stuff.

6233
02:54:27,700 --> 02:54:29,960
If I end up with this with 0-0, I'm gonna crush it.

6234
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:32,860
There's no way.

6235
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,220
We're gonna go gambling.

6236
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:36,720
Let's go gambling.

6237
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:37,380
Literally.

6238
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:40,180
Oh, that's a lot of money.

6239
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:41,860
I have no coins left.

6240
02:54:41,960 --> 02:54:43,260
0 coins.

6241
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:47,780
If I lose all my stars right now, I'm gonna be left with 0.

6242
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:48,380
There's no way.

6243
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:52,880
It'd be great if it was a star swap between Sykkuno and Elem and you earned 0-0.

6244
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:58,200
Wait, what if I...

6245
02:54:58,200 --> 02:55:01,540
Okay, I'm gonna grab the star swap and then we'll do gambling on the...

6246
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:01,920
Wait, Doki.

6247
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:03,860
I say do the star swap first.

6248
02:55:05,340 --> 02:55:06,280
Hear me out.

6249
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:10,320
If you swap the coins with me and Sykkuno, if he rolls, he can't buy the starry ones.

6250
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:16,420
That would be crazy, but I think the full swapper is the bigger move here.

6251
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:17,880
Yeah, the full swapper.

6252
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:19,660
Hear me out, Doki.

6253
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:21,060
You gotta do the full double swap.

6254
02:55:21,060 --> 02:55:23,040
Yeah, we gotta do the double swap.

6255
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:24,840
You don't need to do that.

6256
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:27,020
Oh, this is hard.

6257
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:28,660
You don't need to do that.

6258
02:55:28,980 --> 02:55:30,800
I wouldn't worry about it.

6259
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:33,760
We have to target Elem first, though.

6260
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:35,700
We could be helping him.

6261
02:55:35,740 --> 02:55:36,980
We could be giving him our money.

6262
02:55:37,240 --> 02:55:38,640
And I'm fine with that.

6263
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:39,960
Wait, what was that lag?

6264
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:40,760
What the fuck?

6265
02:55:44,220 --> 02:55:45,600
He's lag switching it.

6266
02:55:46,180 --> 02:55:46,880
Lag a bit more.

6267
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:48,660
Please.

6268
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:51,400
Oh, shit!

6269
02:55:52,660 --> 02:55:53,520
Okay, let's do it!

6270
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:57,000
Let's see if we can get Elem in here.

6271
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:57,900
Dude, this is good.

6272
02:55:58,040 --> 02:56:02,800
As long as I'm not giving away coins, anything related to stars is good for me.

6273
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:03,040
No way.

6274
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:03,140
Not me.

6275
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:04,180
Give me somebody else.

6276
02:56:04,980 --> 02:56:05,480
Yes!

6277
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:07,360
Yes!

6278
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:09,200
Give me your stars.

6279
02:56:10,980 --> 02:56:12,800
I can't even steal anymore.

6280
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:15,360
I can't even do the triple steal anymore.

6281
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:18,020
I can't even do the triple steal.

6282
02:56:18,020 --> 02:56:19,040
He took my coins.

6283
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:22,700
I don't even get to play the game.

6284
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:25,100
I literally don't get...

6285
02:56:25,100 --> 02:56:27,380
I've lost over 200 coins!

6286
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:29,440
Okay, what else?

6287
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:31,740
I don't think you buy the stars.

6288
02:56:32,240 --> 02:56:33,060
I don't think you buy the stars.

6289
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:34,600
You gotta get 13 coins.

6290
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:36,520
Don't buy the stars!

6291
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:38,660
Don't buy the stars, Sykuno!

6292
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:40,080
You gotta go get...

6293
02:56:40,080 --> 02:56:42,480
You gotta get 13 coins.

6294
02:56:42,480 --> 02:56:43,660
This is psychotic.

6295
02:56:44,780 --> 02:56:46,180
This is psychotic.

6296
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:48,200
You gotta get 13 coins.

6297
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:49,320
It's been three hours.

6298
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:53,380
Don't get the stars you have.

6299
02:56:53,440 --> 02:56:55,400
Get 13 coins, Sykuno.

6300
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:56,340
This is literally it.

6301
02:56:57,860 --> 02:56:59,160
You can land on...

6302
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,460
You can land on the blue and then you gotta win the minigame.

6303
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:02,700
Those are your options.

6304
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:04,040
Don't get the stars!

6305
02:57:04,620 --> 02:57:06,440
Put it all in the triple steal.

6306
02:57:06,700 --> 02:57:08,000
Put it all in the triple steal.

6307
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:08,980
It'll be worth it.

6308
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:10,500
You don't need to do it, Syk.

6309
02:57:10,600 --> 02:57:11,940
How far can you get in the game?

6310
02:57:14,260 --> 02:57:17,400
I can't triple steal because it's gonna be daytime next turn.

6311
02:57:17,620 --> 02:57:18,220
I can't triple steal because it's gonna be daytime next turn.

6312
02:57:18,220 --> 02:57:18,680
I'll do you a favor.

6313
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:19,800
I'll try and aim for the...

6314
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:21,140
Yeah, I have a chance to.

6315
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:23,780
I have a block that changes...

6316
02:57:23,780 --> 02:57:25,780
I can change the day for you.

6317
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:26,680
We can aim for that.

6318
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:29,920
The game has just decided I don't get a play.

6319
02:57:30,060 --> 02:57:30,460
Three!

6320
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:32,060
Of three!

6321
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,340
I think you have so much time.

6322
02:57:34,380 --> 02:57:38,400
This is actually insanity how bad my luck is.

6323
02:57:38,620 --> 02:57:40,140
You got a star, though!

6324
02:57:40,180 --> 02:57:40,780
You got a star!

6325
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:42,240
I'm buying it.

6326
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:45,220
If Bowser takes your star...

6327
02:57:46,760 --> 02:57:48,560
Wait, does he land on the Bowser?

6328
02:57:49,580 --> 02:57:50,820
There's no way he lands on Bowser, right?

6329
02:57:50,820 --> 02:57:51,980
I land on the item, surely.

6330
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:54,080
No, I think you're going to...

6331
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,880
You land on Bowser!

6332
02:57:56,360 --> 02:57:57,920
You land on Bowser!

6333
02:57:58,720 --> 02:57:59,280
Bowser!

6334
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:01,580
Bro, if they take his one star...

6335
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:02,960
He lands on Bowser!

6336
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:05,020
Dude, this is...

6337
02:58:05,020 --> 02:58:07,700
Even the one star is a pity star.

6338
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:09,500
It's a pity star.

6339
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:10,540
Oh my god.

6340
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:13,000
Dude, just my luck.

6341
02:58:13,700 --> 02:58:15,120
Oh my god.

6342
02:58:15,940 --> 02:58:18,720
Bowser revolution, I'm gonna give away another hundred coins.

6343
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:20,120
Oh my god.

6344
02:58:20,720 --> 02:58:22,700
You gotta be worried about the star.

6345
02:58:23,180 --> 02:58:25,320
Yeah, you want a Bowser revolution.

6346
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:26,720
You want a Bowser.

6347
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:29,580
There's a chance you can lose one star.

6348
02:58:29,740 --> 02:58:30,180
Oh!

6349
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:31,780
Bowser shuffle!

6350
02:58:32,020 --> 02:58:32,420
That's good!

6351
02:58:33,460 --> 02:58:34,280
What does that mean?

6352
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:36,320
It just swaps our spots.

6353
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:38,300
Yeah, that's honestly the best case scenario.

6354
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:40,000
At least I didn't lose my star, not that it really matters.

6355
02:58:41,140 --> 02:58:42,540
I mean, let's be honest.

6356
02:58:43,620 --> 02:58:45,540
There's nothing I can do to come back here.

6357
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:50,980
Dude, Elem's in front of the Stealer.

6358
02:58:51,240 --> 02:58:52,080
Yes, yes.

6359
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:53,720
Wait, so where does that put me?

6360
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:55,840
This is crazy.

6361
02:58:56,140 --> 02:58:57,120
Where are you?

6362
02:58:58,100 --> 02:58:59,580
Where even are you?

6363
02:59:00,360 --> 02:59:02,580
Wait, that was great for you.

6364
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:04,380
You might have a 10 for chance time.

6365
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:05,760
You can chance time on your last turn.

6366
02:59:05,780 --> 02:59:06,860
Yeah, you can chance time.

6367
02:59:07,080 --> 02:59:08,380
And you have a special block.

6368
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:14,140
Dude, with the lag, I won't be able to control it though.

6369
02:59:14,300 --> 02:59:15,400
Yeah, that's the best part.

6370
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:16,080
It's gambling.

6371
02:59:16,420 --> 02:59:17,320
It's full on gambling.

6372
02:59:17,920 --> 02:59:21,500
You can full on test your luck.

6373
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:23,180
With my luck, it's GG.

6374
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:24,100
Clap up.

6375
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:26,840
This is the GG clapus.

6376
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:28,200
It's not...

6377
02:59:29,260 --> 02:59:30,140
This is it.

6378
02:59:30,200 --> 02:59:31,020
This is what you want.

6379
02:59:31,240 --> 02:59:34,940
This is worse than the time I spent over a thousand dollars rolling for a Star Wars character.

6380
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:41,160
See, that's why you don't play TCG games.

6381
02:59:41,280 --> 02:59:43,140
Because you can't afford both, man.

6382
02:59:43,180 --> 02:59:43,620
That's rough.

6383
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:46,680
Yikes.

6384
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:48,200
Oh, minigame time.

6385
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:51,520
Okay.

6386
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:52,140
Oh, okay.

6387
02:59:52,220 --> 02:59:53,200
And we're fighting against Sykuno.

6388
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:54,000
Okay.

6389
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:54,600
What did I miss?

6390
02:59:54,620 --> 02:59:54,900
What did I miss?

6391
02:59:54,980 --> 02:59:55,680
Just beat me up, man.

6392
02:59:55,940 --> 02:59:57,000
Oh, you are...

6393
02:59:58,480 --> 02:59:59,520
Do it, Doki.

6394
03:00:00,760 --> 03:00:03,280
Hit the triangle button again, you sicko.

6395
03:00:03,940 --> 03:00:05,480
Hit the dang triangle button, Doki.

6396
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:06,460
How do we do this one again?

6397
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:09,080
We just have to all be on...

6398
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:10,540
Yeah, we just all have to be on...

6399
03:00:11,380 --> 03:00:12,640
This game is so rigged.

6400
03:00:13,280 --> 03:00:13,680
It's okay.

6401
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:14,420
It's just practice.

6402
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:16,700
Now that you got practice, you have to experience now.

6403
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:17,920
Here we go.

6404
03:00:17,980 --> 03:00:18,140
Here we go.

6405
03:00:18,860 --> 03:00:19,420
Lock it in.

6406
03:00:19,540 --> 03:00:19,760
Lock it in.

6407
03:00:19,860 --> 03:00:20,020
Lock it in.

6408
03:00:20,500 --> 03:00:21,040
5-0.

6409
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:21,480
5-0.

6410
03:00:21,820 --> 03:00:23,520
Guys, he's... Sync up.

6411
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:23,860
Sync up.

6412
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:25,680
Oh.

6413
03:00:25,880 --> 03:00:26,560
Where is he going?

6414
03:00:26,820 --> 03:00:27,560
Wait, he's actually good.

6415
03:00:28,140 --> 03:00:28,640
Oh my god.

6416
03:00:29,060 --> 03:00:29,760
Wait, what?

6417
03:00:30,960 --> 03:00:31,440
It's cracked.

6418
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:32,420
He's cracked.

6419
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:32,980
He's cracked.

6420
03:00:34,660 --> 03:00:35,920
He's right here at the top.

6421
03:00:36,220 --> 03:00:36,920
Oh, damn.

6422
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:37,360
Nice dive.

6423
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:38,800
I think he wins.

6424
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:40,720
Oh, we got him.

6425
03:00:40,760 --> 03:00:41,040
Oh, what?

6426
03:00:41,160 --> 03:00:41,800
Oh, no!

6427
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:42,560
Direction.

6428
03:00:42,640 --> 03:00:42,880
It's direction.

6429
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:45,200
He's won.

6430
03:00:45,740 --> 03:00:46,260
No way!

6431
03:00:46,260 --> 03:00:46,400
He's so lucky!

6432
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:46,820
Oh my god.

6433
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:47,640
Incredible display.

6434
03:00:48,140 --> 03:00:49,220
He's not even talking.

6435
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:51,060
He was so locked in.

6436
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:52,660
He was holding his breath, dude.

6437
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:54,420
He's very bright red.

6438
03:00:54,560 --> 03:00:55,800
Oh my god.

6439
03:00:56,280 --> 03:00:56,560
That was good.

6440
03:00:56,700 --> 03:00:57,060
That was impressive.

6441
03:00:57,300 --> 03:00:59,840
He was actually so locked in.

6442
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:01,540
He even stopped talking.

6443
03:01:03,140 --> 03:01:03,720
Okay, now.

6444
03:01:03,900 --> 03:01:08,280
Maybe we don't go for chance time because I'm feeling pretty happy with my position.

6445
03:01:08,540 --> 03:01:08,860
No, no, Sykkuno.

6446
03:01:08,940 --> 03:01:09,360
It's time.

6447
03:01:09,440 --> 03:01:10,060
You gotta do chance.

6448
03:01:10,220 --> 03:01:10,980
It's the last...

6449
03:01:12,140 --> 03:01:14,020
I'm feeling pretty happy in my...

6450
03:01:14,740 --> 03:01:16,000
It's your last chance.

6451
03:01:16,260 --> 03:01:17,480
As IT send us.

6452
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:19,440
Final turn, guys.

6453
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:20,340
Final turn.

6454
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:21,920
Oh, Jesus.

6455
03:01:22,340 --> 03:01:23,160
Anyone wants a card?

6456
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:26,360
There's like nothing for me to...

6457
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:28,160
There's nothing for me to get.

6458
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:30,400
Like, what does this event space give me?

6459
03:01:30,440 --> 03:01:31,380
Dude, I got nothing.

6460
03:01:31,640 --> 03:01:32,300
I got nothing.

6461
03:01:33,380 --> 03:01:35,760
Oh, it just makes it nighttime?

6462
03:01:36,060 --> 03:01:36,360
Okay.

6463
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:36,920
Yeah.

6464
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:41,160
Alright, then I guess I'll just get a lucky space.

6465
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:42,540
If nothing else to get.

6466
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:44,520
Live by the chance, die by the chance, man.

6467
03:01:44,640 --> 03:01:45,120
You got this.

6468
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:46,860
Alright, dice time.

6469
03:01:47,660 --> 03:01:49,220
I have a dice anyway.

6470
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:52,320
Alright.

6471
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:53,440
Ding, ding.

6472
03:01:54,440 --> 03:01:56,700
The most annoying one I could possibly click.

6473
03:01:57,700 --> 03:01:58,260
Ten.

6474
03:01:58,940 --> 03:02:00,660
I don't think I've even heard that one before.

6475
03:02:00,740 --> 03:02:01,280
What the fuck?

6476
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:04,880
Yeah, that one's aggravating.

6477
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:05,760
Alright.

6478
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:07,700
Alright, it's just money time.

6479
03:02:08,420 --> 03:02:08,980
Money!

6480
03:02:09,960 --> 03:02:11,040
Fifteen coins.

6481
03:02:12,040 --> 03:02:12,520
Yay!

6482
03:02:13,540 --> 03:02:14,700
The rich be getting richer, guys.

6483
03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:15,880
The rich be getting richer.

6484
03:02:16,700 --> 03:02:18,840
See, he's the one with five stars.

6485
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:19,800
Boom.

6486
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:20,980
A humble nine.

6487
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:22,020
This guy's got nine.

6488
03:02:22,700 --> 03:02:24,020
A humble nine.

6489
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:26,580
Time to pay your taxes.

6490
03:02:27,340 --> 03:02:28,400
Wait, am I...

6491
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:29,820
One coin.

6492
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:35,300
You know, Sykuno could literally win the game if he gets the chance.

6493
03:02:35,440 --> 03:02:36,380
I don't think it's possible.

6494
03:02:36,380 --> 03:02:37,240
More money, more money.

6495
03:02:37,360 --> 03:02:39,220
You can get the chance, Sykuno.

6496
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:39,980
You have chance.

6497
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:42,160
This is the biggest play of your life.

6498
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:43,780
This is the biggest play of your life.

6499
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:48,360
You can literally make LM be last place in this last turn.

6500
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:49,800
Can he reach it?

6501
03:02:50,240 --> 03:02:52,260
Dude, I think it's exactly ten.

6502
03:02:52,360 --> 03:02:53,040
Oh my god.

6503
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:53,780
It's ten.

6504
03:02:54,660 --> 03:02:56,700
And you have the chance block.

6505
03:02:57,220 --> 03:02:58,860
Syk, you don't need to do this, bro.

6506
03:02:59,040 --> 03:02:59,840
This is it.

6507
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:02,940
The biggest play of your life.

6508
03:03:03,960 --> 03:03:04,740
Dude, I...

6509
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:06,540
It's such a low chance, though.

6510
03:03:07,080 --> 03:03:08,420
It's just pure gamba.

6511
03:03:09,140 --> 03:03:10,320
That's the best part.

6512
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:12,100
It's the best part.

6513
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:14,500
Syk, you don't need to do this, brother.

6514
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:16,380
I mean, the chance is there.

6515
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:17,600
There is a possibility.

6516
03:03:17,960 --> 03:03:19,520
You don't need to do this, brethren.

6517
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,480
Think of America number seven.

6518
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:25,160
Think of all the good times you shared.

6519
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:25,560
Prime numbers?

6520
03:03:25,740 --> 03:03:26,940
Are we talking about prime numbers again?

6521
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:28,460
You don't need to do this.

6522
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:30,160
This could be it.

6523
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:34,140
I could go down and steal one star, but there's no point.

6524
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:34,860
There's no point.

6525
03:03:36,840 --> 03:03:37,700
You don't win.

6526
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:38,820
You're still last place.

6527
03:03:38,820 --> 03:03:39,760
Is this it?

6528
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:42,180
I don't want to be involved in this.

6529
03:03:42,420 --> 03:03:44,140
I don't want to be involved in this.

6530
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:45,600
Syke... Syke...

6531
03:03:45,600 --> 03:03:48,180
Syke, you don't need to do this.

6532
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:49,900
Is it 1 before or 2 before?

6533
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:54,100
Dude, my switch lags a lot so I'm just gonna...

6534
03:03:54,820 --> 03:03:55,280
Sykuno...

6535
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:56,580
This is it!

6536
03:03:57,720 --> 03:03:59,040
Sykuno... Sykuno...

6537
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:00,580
Sykuno, don't.

6538
03:04:02,380 --> 03:04:04,560
Star swap is after...

6539
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:05,080
what?

6540
03:04:05,260 --> 03:04:05,820
30?

6541
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:08,580
Wait, what's it after?

6542
03:04:08,740 --> 03:04:09,340
I can't even see.

6543
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,440
It's after the coin.

6544
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:15,500
Yeah, 30 star swap, then 20, and then it's a full swap.

6545
03:04:16,620 --> 03:04:17,640
I don't know what you just said.

6546
03:04:17,720 --> 03:04:18,300
Dude, it's going too fast.

6547
03:04:18,340 --> 03:04:18,820
I'm lost.

6548
03:04:20,240 --> 03:04:21,040
That's Gamba!

6549
03:04:21,640 --> 03:04:22,780
I can't even tell either.

6550
03:04:23,460 --> 03:04:24,980
Oh, dude, I did it wrong.

6551
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:26,880
Oh, but you get money!

6552
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:27,380
You get money!

6553
03:04:27,440 --> 03:04:27,920
You get money!

6554
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:28,160
You get money!

6555
03:04:28,540 --> 03:04:29,460
You get 30 coins back!

6556
03:04:29,740 --> 03:04:31,620
You get 30 coins back!

6557
03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:33,340
I think I did it once before.

6558
03:04:33,340 --> 03:04:35,440
I did it once before, but it's hard.

6559
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:38,080
I think the next one was a star swapper.

6560
03:04:38,600 --> 03:04:39,280
I think the next one was a star swapper.

6561
03:04:39,280 --> 03:04:41,800
This is good, because if you get one bonus star, you won't take less.

6562
03:04:41,940 --> 03:04:42,560
Yeah, you won't.

6563
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:43,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6564
03:04:43,280 --> 03:04:44,300
I don't care about last.

6565
03:04:45,820 --> 03:04:47,160
It's either first or nothing.

6566
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:49,060
First or nothing, bro.

6567
03:04:49,060 --> 03:04:49,060
What do you mean?

6568
03:04:49,060 --> 03:04:49,920
First or nothing, bro.

6569
03:04:50,060 --> 03:04:50,480
What do you mean?

6570
03:04:50,740 --> 03:04:52,740
Hey, thanks for the 30 coin loan.

6571
03:04:52,880 --> 03:04:54,980
I really appreciate the loan you gave me earlier.

6572
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:57,080
Yeah, dude, if you didn't take that...

6573
03:04:57,080 --> 03:04:58,860
Now he could have stolen it.

6574
03:04:58,880 --> 03:04:59,800
He could have stolen it now.

6575
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:00,760
If he had one more turn.

6576
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:02,040
One more turn, guys.

6577
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:04,340
If he had one more turn.

6578
03:05:04,360 --> 03:05:05,240
He'll give me one.

6579
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:07,060
Just not one.

6580
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:08,540
Zero stars.

6581
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:12,260
Apparently, my chat said you lost 400 coins in total.

6582
03:05:12,660 --> 03:05:13,140
Apparently, my chat said you lost 400 coins in total.

6583
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:13,540
Wait, no, Sean.

6584
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:15,080
200 coins?

6585
03:05:15,100 --> 03:05:16,200
It was a lot of money.

6586
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:17,360
Jesus Christ.

6587
03:05:17,580 --> 03:05:18,940
With all the revolutions?

6588
03:05:20,120 --> 03:05:21,680
Yeah, twice in a row.

6589
03:05:21,940 --> 03:05:22,300
Revolution.

6590
03:05:24,040 --> 03:05:26,120
Alright, we're all in here together, right?

6591
03:05:26,580 --> 03:05:28,160
My labor can't handle this.

6592
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:30,940
Wait, I don't even know.

6593
03:05:30,940 --> 03:05:32,560
Oh, I'm the fastest.

6594
03:05:32,940 --> 03:05:33,300
Yeah.

6595
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:37,920
Well, you're the fastest just because you literally have host advantage.

6596
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:40,800
What in the Turbo controller are you clicking?

6597
03:05:42,320 --> 03:05:44,240
I'm cracked out of my brain, I tell you.

6598
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:44,720
I'm cracked out of my brain, I tell you.

6599
03:05:44,720 --> 03:05:45,160
It's okay.

6600
03:05:45,220 --> 03:05:45,960
He's on his Joy-Con.

6601
03:05:46,140 --> 03:05:46,620
There's no way.

6602
03:05:48,100 --> 03:05:49,120
Oh, I'm winning this.

6603
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:49,480
Watch this.

6604
03:05:49,640 --> 03:05:49,800
Ready?

6605
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:51,240
Yeah, I'm ready.

6606
03:05:51,980 --> 03:05:52,700
Okay, I'm dialing in.

6607
03:05:52,780 --> 03:05:53,040
Dialing in.

6608
03:05:54,880 --> 03:05:55,240
And...

6609
03:05:58,480 --> 03:05:59,720
Whoever's spamming it, you're so cringe.

6610
03:06:01,740 --> 03:06:02,540
Holy shit!

6611
03:06:03,480 --> 03:06:04,500
How the fuck?

6612
03:06:04,500 --> 03:06:04,980
Dude, how?

6613
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:05,900
How?

6614
03:06:06,380 --> 03:06:07,700
You're on a Joy-Con!

6615
03:06:08,880 --> 03:06:09,680
New record!

6616
03:06:10,060 --> 03:06:11,660
Very good, very good, very good.

6617
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:12,620
New record, dude.

6618
03:06:12,820 --> 03:06:13,440
Thank you so much.

6619
03:06:16,640 --> 03:06:18,340
Where's my Turbo button, bro?

6620
03:06:18,720 --> 03:06:19,360
Yeah, right?

6621
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:20,700
Here we go.

6622
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:21,680
Why can't we drift to victory?

6623
03:06:24,160 --> 03:06:25,300
It's just so over.

6624
03:06:25,820 --> 03:06:27,040
Oh, wait, Sykkuno!

6625
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:28,020
Oh, Sykkuno!

6626
03:06:28,020 --> 03:06:28,760
Oh, that's gotta be me.

6627
03:06:29,720 --> 03:06:30,500
Dude, there's no way.

6628
03:06:30,960 --> 03:06:32,680
I've lost so much money.

6629
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:34,700
What?

6630
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:36,960
What a shame.

6631
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:39,080
I mean, who's gonna win?

6632
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:40,340
I've lost so much money.

6633
03:06:40,720 --> 03:06:41,800
What a shame.

6634
03:06:42,160 --> 03:06:44,600
Dude, I've lost so much money.

6635
03:06:44,980 --> 03:06:46,600
This has gotta be me.

6636
03:06:47,620 --> 03:06:49,080
That has to be Sykkuno!

6637
03:06:49,540 --> 03:06:50,640
I think it has to be Sykkuno.

6638
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:52,720
Dude, it has to be me for this.

6639
03:06:52,940 --> 03:06:53,260
What?

6640
03:06:54,760 --> 03:06:55,220
What?

6641
03:06:56,660 --> 03:07:03,820
There's no way he's the last one to win!onte even... There's just no way... There's just no way he... It doesn't make any sense.

6642
03:07:03,900 --> 03:07:06,780
He was that unlucky, but yet still wins the game!

6643
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:11,880
There's just no way he was less lucky than I was.

6644
03:07:11,940 --> 03:07:12,020
And it's not last.

6645
03:07:13,460 --> 03:07:15,540
3 hours with no star?

6646
03:07:15,720 --> 03:07:19,780
Wait, that's not fair, he has a main character bonus!

6647
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:25,200
So can I win the game today?!

6648
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:27,000
I told you he's the Mario guy.

6649
03:07:27,220 --> 03:07:27,460
He's the Mario guy.

6650
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:28,640
No one can tell me all this.

6651
03:07:29,740 --> 03:07:32,920
It's called Mario Party for a reason.

6652
03:07:32,980 --> 03:07:33,720
Mario won.

6653
03:07:34,060 --> 03:07:35,920
Oh my god, that's so good.

6654
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:37,380
I lost like 300-400 points.

6655
03:07:37,580 --> 03:07:39,680
I didn't get a star for three hours.

6656
03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:42,300
It just doesn't even...

6657
03:07:42,300 --> 03:07:43,840
Guys, all the accolades.

6658
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:44,580
This is incredible.

6659
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:48,500
That is the most rigged game I've ever seen.

6660
03:07:49,220 --> 03:07:54,380
Someone in my chat was like so unlucky he lost the award for being most unlucky.

6661
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:57,880
Yeah dude, that's how unlucky I was.

6662
03:07:57,940 --> 03:08:01,360
I was so unlucky that I didn't even get the unlucky award.

6663
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:05,740
I just don't know how you didn't win the most rich when you made so much money.

6664
03:08:05,900 --> 03:08:06,920
I just don't even know how that's possible.

6665
03:08:07,540 --> 03:08:09,600
They called you a passionate player though.

6666
03:08:10,600 --> 03:08:12,120
I definitely lost.

6667
03:08:12,240 --> 03:08:14,520
There's no passion left in these bones though.

6668
03:08:15,560 --> 03:08:17,740
This game just hates me.

6669
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:20,320
We can check out the I've done wrong.

6670
03:08:20,660 --> 03:08:22,440
We get the scoreboard which is nice.

6671
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:24,940
It gives us like a full breakdown of how it all went wrong.

6672
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:30,020
I don't think I went three hours without getting a single star.

6673
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:31,120
I think that's enough.

6674
03:08:31,700 --> 03:08:32,680
There it is.

6675
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:34,260
I think that's enough I needed to see.

6676
03:08:34,420 --> 03:08:36,820
Dude, he made so much waste.

6677
03:08:37,500 --> 03:08:38,280
Didn't he make the most money?

6678
03:08:38,280 --> 03:08:39,860
I made a shitload of coins.

6679
03:08:40,360 --> 03:08:41,760
Oh my god.

6680
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:43,400
You made a lot.

6681
03:08:43,720 --> 03:08:44,440
Holy shit.

6682
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:48,600
When you gambled against me and I took your 70 coins, that helped.

6683
03:08:48,760 --> 03:08:49,320
That counted.

6684
03:08:49,880 --> 03:08:50,980
That was why.

6685
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:56,120
I would have won if Elem didn't give you that 120 coins.

6686
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:57,560
I got 13 lucky spaces.

6687
03:08:58,140 --> 03:08:58,960
Holy shit.

6688
03:08:59,260 --> 03:08:59,740
Damn.

6689
03:09:00,420 --> 03:09:01,800
That's the way it goes, guys.

6690
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:02,520
Oh my god.

6691
03:09:04,820 --> 03:09:08,040
In the future, we should definitely run it back.

6692
03:09:08,180 --> 03:09:08,340
I'm down.

6693
03:09:09,320 --> 03:09:11,100
Elem should not be the host for sure.

6694
03:09:11,320 --> 03:09:13,900
Dude, I'll play Roblox party next time, alright?

6695
03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:16,160
I'll play a Roblox party.

6696
03:09:16,460 --> 03:09:18,260
Yeah, I think Roblox party.

6697
03:09:19,660 --> 03:09:20,760
It's actually voted.

6698
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,380
Good games, guys.

6699
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:22,040
Good games.

6700
03:09:23,460 --> 03:09:24,180
GG's.

6701
03:09:24,260 --> 03:09:25,300
That was really fun.

6702
03:09:25,700 --> 03:09:26,220
It was great hanging out.

6703
03:09:26,240 --> 03:09:28,080
It was good playing with you guys again.

6704
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:29,320
Yeah, it was fun.

6705
03:09:29,480 --> 03:09:30,000
Bye.

6706
03:09:30,060 --> 03:09:31,180
We'll run it back.

6707
03:09:31,780 --> 03:09:32,140
Bye.

6708
03:09:32,260 --> 03:09:32,880
Bye-bye.

6709
03:09:36,260 --> 03:09:37,520
Oh my god.

6710
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,880
That was so fun.

6711
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:40,860
That was so...

6712
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:42,160
I can't believe.

6713
03:09:43,080 --> 03:09:48,180
I can't believe how unlucky Sakuro was in the end.

6714
03:09:48,460 --> 03:09:49,820
Oh my god.

6715
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:52,300
That's crazy.

6716
03:09:53,320 --> 03:09:56,080
As long as I wasn't last, I'm happy.

6717
03:09:56,320 --> 03:10:00,720
I didn't get robbed in the end.

6718
03:10:00,860 --> 03:10:02,300
That's all that matters.

6719
03:10:03,070 --> 03:10:03,620
It's fine.

6720
03:10:03,900 --> 03:10:08,600
It might not happen first, but I'll just say that he got ping advantage.

6721
03:10:08,960 --> 03:10:09,740
That's really it.

6722
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:13,960
Elem had the ping advantage in the end.

6723
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:15,760
Oh my god.

6724
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:16,860
That was fun.

6725
03:10:17,080 --> 03:10:20,340
I hope you guys had a great time.

6726
03:10:20,340 --> 03:10:24,320
If he didn't land on chat, I could have kept having more stars.

6727
03:10:24,640 --> 03:10:26,180
I could have kept going.

6728
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:28,780
I could have kept going.

6729
03:10:29,240 --> 03:10:30,000
It was...

6730
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:31,040
Oh my god.

6731
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:35,060
I can't believe I lost it all because of the fucking chat.

6732
03:10:38,540 --> 03:10:41,260
But I hope you guys had a great time watching chat.

6733
03:10:41,580 --> 03:10:47,380
It was really fun meeting Chill for the first time with this game.

6734
03:10:47,380 --> 03:10:50,460
A huge shout out to Elem for inviting me.

6735
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:53,140
And I had a great time with everybody.

6736
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:54,900
I had a great time with Sakura, Elem, and Chill.

6737
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:56,780
I hope you guys had a great time watching too.

6738
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:59,480
As always, I'm going to head off now.

6739
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:05,580
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flow.

6740
03:11:05,660 --> 03:11:09,500
And if you suffer me, head to bed because you deserve it.

6741
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:10,720
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6742
03:11:11,720 --> 03:11:12,520
Bye guys.

6743
03:11:14,040 --> 03:11:14,440
Bye.
