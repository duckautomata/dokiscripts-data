1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,020
I accidentally... It's fine.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,120
It's fine.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,960
I started my stream.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,040
I started my next stream.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,600
Oh my god, okay.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,820
Alright, I'm not live.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,560
Sorry guys, I accidentally raided this stream.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,360
I accidentally raided this stream.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,220
Oh my god.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,400
Alright, we're doing the... Should we chat our stuff first or should we raid now?

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,260
Should we do the pillaging?

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,440
We probably don't need to do the pillaging.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,040
Hold on, I have so many DMs real quick.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,220
Okay, guys, I accidentally raided Min's stream instead of my mom's stream.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,080
I have so many DMs.

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,400
Hold on.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,320
Okay, okay.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,400
Someone said the pillager is not worth the risk.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,520
Okay, let's just enchant stuff then.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
You work on enchanting.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm just gonna work on...

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,680
Um, do you want the... I'll put the enderpearls in your chest and then I'll put the books in yours.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,220
Do you want me to make bookshelves now?

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,220
I can make it now.

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,060
Um, hold on.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,440
Oh god, wait.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,580
How many bookshelves do we need?

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,400
Um, I don't know.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,880
Guys, how many do we need for the enchanting table?

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,460
Oh yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,280
How many do we need?

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,980
You have more.

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,360
Can you get past the bookshelf books to me and I'll make them?

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Yeah, I have that many.

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,880
Oh my god!

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,960
Okay, we have enough.

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,320
We have enough for bookshelves.

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,600
Yeah, we have so many.

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,300
Fifteen?

40
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,880
Okay, we have...

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,860
But we still need books for the enchanting stuff, so... Oh, I see.

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,820
Oh, so we have nine right now.

43
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,000
Um, I'm gonna go farm some more trees real quick.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,980
Wait, is it night time?

45
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,580
Night time!

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep!

47
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm asleep in my bed.

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm asleep too.

49
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm asleep as well.

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,400
Guys, we have one life.

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,660
If we don't do this, it's over.

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,740
We'll try this again another time.

53
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,800
Try what?

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,560
What are we trying?

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,460
If we fuck it up...

56
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,600
We have one life to make this happen.

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,560
One life to make what happen?

58
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,600
The Ender Dragon.

59
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,920
We have one life.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,900
We have one life to make this work.

61
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,360
Oh, chat is frozen.

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,120
Thank you guys.

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,440
Sorry.

64
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,900
Thank you for letting... Yeah, yeah.

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,780
I forgot to change my chat overlay as well.

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,320
Thank you.

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,060
Me too.

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,640
Alright.

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,880
Guys, we just came right back into it.

70
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,020
We just came right back.

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
One life to make it all work.

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,320
Ender Dragon.

73
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,960
Alright.

74
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,670
Okay, I got the wood.

75
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,790
Okay, I got it.

76
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
I got it.

77
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,930
I got enough for... I think I got enough for bookshelves.

78
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,430
Yeah, I do.

79
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,970
I do.

80
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,730
We got this.

81
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,650
Uh...

82
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,710
Wood.

83
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,850
And then I should have... I should have enough for 15.

84
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,310
Let's see.

85
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,090
Bookshelf.

86
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,040
That's where if we...

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,920
You know what I think might happen?

88
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,220
What?

89
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,960
What?

90
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,820
I won't be surprised if...

91
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,500
Just there.

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,900
Just there.

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,340
What?

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,920
What do you mean by that?

96
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Just there.

97
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,780
You think we're gonna die?

98
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

99
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,080
We're not.

100
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,540
Well, we can do this.

101
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,760
Oh, we need glass, so I need to get...

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,700
Sand.

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,580
Sand is right next to us.

104
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,840
Oh, what's the glass for?

105
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,220
The potion bottles?

106
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,100
Yeah.

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,820
Wait, is that... What else do you need to make potion bottles?

108
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh, I haven't unlocked it, so I don't know yet.

109
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,780
I think that's it.

110
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,580
Oh, you just need to get glass and then...

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,420
Oh, we had so many empty bottles too and we threw it all away.

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,760
It's fine.

113
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,320
I didn't need it.

114
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,640
Okay.

115
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
It's fine.

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
They don't stack, so it sucks.

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,780
That's true, that's true.

118
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,600
13...

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,100
14.

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,760
I have 15.

121
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,200
And we have 38 books too.

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,880
So, yeah, I'll put the bookshelves with you.

123
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay.

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,220
I can help you with glass too.

125
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,140
What else do I need for the bottles?

126
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,640
Wait, give me...

127
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,760
Oh, I need to make the glass.

128
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Give me the shovel.

129
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,440
I'll get glass and then you can work on enchanting table and stuff.

130
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,120
Do you have any coal?

131
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,920
I do.

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
It's in my other box.

133
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,720
It's in my other chest.

134
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:23,000
Give me the glass and I'll dig the sand and then you work on enchanting table.

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,700
Okay.

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Alright.

137
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,820
I mean, sand is literally right here.

138
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,660
Yeah, just get some.

139
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Yeah, just grab some.

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,040
Yeah.

141
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,960
Oh, I need to make...

142
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,200
We're being... We're being... We're so productive right now.

143
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:36,920
We're teamwork.

144
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,420
We're teamwork.

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,720
Teamwork.

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,120
We're teamwork.

147
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,720
Teamwork right here.

148
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,160
Teamwork right here.

149
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,900
Teamwork makes the dream work.

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,300
Right here.

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,760
Okay.

152
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,420
I got...

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,200
46.

154
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,940
I think 46 is enough.

155
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,870
Probably, yeah.

156
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,410
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,310
I'll burn... I'll start burning the glass.

158
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,630
Yeah.

159
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:05,830
Alright.

160
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,790
Burn it up, baby.

161
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,410
Burn it up.

162
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,370
Does the blast furnace work with sand?

163
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,610
Oh, it does.

164
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,710
I don't think so.

165
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,830
Wait, does it not?

166
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,030
No, it does not.

167
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,010
Okay, it's fine.

168
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,450
We have...

169
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,930
Someone said, what if the end portal is 12 blocks... 12k blocks away?

170
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,290
Don't say that.

171
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,850
There's no way.

172
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,190
We don't have Elijah.

173
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,330
Stop saying that, please.

174
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,210
If it's too far, we're calling it.

175
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,510
If it's too far...

176
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,310
We're going in here.

177
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,330
So we just need the 15 bookshelves around, right?

178
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,470
Just surround it.

180
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,430
Okay, I'm making this stuff.

181
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,550
Alright.

182
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,090
It's like that, right guys?

183
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,090
I think so, yeah.

184
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,290
Like that, like that.

185
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,570
Then you put the...

186
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,690
Thing in the middle, yeah.

187
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,730
Is it?

188
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,960
Is it?

189
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,040
Did it work?

190
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,280
Yeah, now we need the lapis.

191
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,940
Okay, I have the lapis block.

192
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,340
On the corners?

193
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,080
Oh.

194
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,420
It's fine.

195
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,420
I have...

196
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,000
Here.

197
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,300
Here, let me see it.

198
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,680
62.

199
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,780
How many levels do you have?

200
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,080
30.

201
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,860
35.

202
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,000
You can get knockback.

203
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,640
Yeah, it goes all the way to 3.

204
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,160
Enchantment, knockback, smite.

205
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,260
Here's...

206
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,380
Do we want...

207
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,360
I can enchant the bow.

208
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,120
Actually.

209
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,500
Power!

210
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,620
I should get that, right?

211
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,140
For the bow?

212
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
That's for the bow, right?

213
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,700
I'll put that for the bow then.

215
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,120
Right?

216
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,320
Right?

217
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:58,900
What?

218
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
Is that right, guys?

219
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,460
Is that...

220
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,060
Do I do it?

221
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,280
Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,540
Infinity on the bow would be so good.

223
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,620
Okay.

224
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,240
I have power.

225
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
I have power for...

226
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
So it goes to unbreaking 3.

227
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,960
So we're good, guys.

228
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,380
We're good.

229
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,900
I have power 4 on my bow.

230
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,860
Nice.

231
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,380
Should I do unbreaking on my sword or...

232
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,720
Alright, and then I can...

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,840
I can't remember what the enchantments are.

234
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,240
I can just...

235
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,960
And then I'm just gonna...

236
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,900
If we have bad luck, where's the rest of the books?

237
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,200
Here, I put the rest of the books here.

238
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,280
Okay, we can just put some...

239
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,180
On your right side.

240
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,520
Yeah, I got them.

241
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,780
We can just reset with this.

242
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,360
I need anvil.

243
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
You have all my iron, right?

244
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,800
Oh, yeah.

245
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,600
Here you go.

246
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,280
Pass it over.

247
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,740
Oh, blast protection.

248
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,500
That would be...

249
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,640
That's good.

250
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,140
That's good.

251
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,940
Yeah.

252
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,540
Hold on.

253
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,700
Here you go.

254
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,120
There you go.

255
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm gonna see if I have...

256
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,220
Oh, 32.

257
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,120
That's enough for an anvil.

258
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,880
Oh, armor enchant.

259
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah, thank you.

260
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

261
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,360
Armor enchant.

262
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,960
Anvil.

263
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,780
Wait, how do I make an anvil?

264
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait, do I need more?

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
Blast protection 4 is good, right?

266
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,040
No, it's not.

267
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,820
Wait, feather falling.

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
We need feather falling.

269
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,880
Yeah.

270
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,160
Oh, let me check my boots.

271
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,740
How do I make anvil again?

272
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,740
Iron blocks?

273
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,080
How many do I need?

274
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,240
Yeah, you need some iron blocks.

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,980
Okay, 3.

276
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,900
Okay, I have enough.

277
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,600
3.

278
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,680
Oh.

279
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,320
Oh.

280
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,180
Oh.

281
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,080
Oh, I do.

282
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,040
I just had enough.

283
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,580
That's good.

284
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Alright.

285
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,240
I just had enough for an anvil.

286
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,360
Flat protection is best.

287
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Okay.

288
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,180
And then we have protection 1.

289
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,860
Okay, let's...

290
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,740
What else can we get?

291
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,950
Let's try our helmet instead.

292
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Sick.

293
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm breaking...

294
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,500
I'm breaking projectile protection.

295
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,660
Fix my bow.

296
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
Gotta fix my bow.

297
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,440
Yeah, let's check the bow.

298
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,320
Let's try the bow.

299
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,700
Power 4...

300
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,240
Power 4 would be good on the bow, right?

301
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,920
Yeah, it would be good.

302
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,740
Okay.

303
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,920
There we go.

304
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,140
Oh, I also got extra unbreaking on it.

305
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,880
Oh, nice!

306
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,460
Okay, I need to take my shoes off.

307
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay.

308
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,800
Okay, cool.

309
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,260
Death Strider.

310
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,960
Okay, oh, projectile protection.

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,100
Just explain how I'm too tired to think.

312
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,200
Projectile...

313
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
I don't know, do we need...

314
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,420
I don't think projectile protection...

315
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,580
No, just say...

316
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,720
They all said normal protection is better than projectile.

317
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,080
Yeah, but my thing doesn't make that.

318
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,120
Well, just do something else and then you can unlock...

319
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,100
Unbreaking 3...

320
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,020
Oh, I got protection 3 on my boots.

321
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,720
Unbreaking 3...

322
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,380
Oh, I don't have...

323
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,980
Protection 3...

324
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,320
Protect 3.

325
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,820
Okay, thanks guys.

326
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Where's my pants?

327
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,900
Unbreaking 3, protection 2.

328
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,760
Oh, I have protection 2!

329
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,560
Maybe I'll get the feather fall.

330
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm gonna get protection 2.

331
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,700
Oh...

332
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,020
Wait...

333
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,760
Oh, I can't do more on my boots.

334
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,940
No, we don't have enough XP!

335
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,460
We should be fine, right?

336
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,460
What XP do you need?

337
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,420
I have level 27.

338
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,060
Oh, I need...

339
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah, sharpness and sweeping edge.

340
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
Let me just...

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,340
Let me see what I have.

342
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,300
How do I combine?

343
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,260
What do I do?

344
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,920
Use books.

345
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,840
You put...

346
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,500
Oh my god.

347
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,940
I didn't realize my glasses were on.

348
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,060
Glasses.

349
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
No, I have protection 3 for my chest.

350
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,560
I need that.

351
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm breaking up sharpness.

352
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,880
Oh, I'm just gonna get sharpness.

353
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,380
Fuck it.

354
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm just gonna...

355
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,980
I'm gonna kill something.

356
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,660
I'm gonna kill something.

357
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Okay...

358
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
It might be me.

359
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,240
I have on my head...

360
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,120
I have protection respiration.

361
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,300
Why are they all such shitty levels?

362
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,140
Okay.

363
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm just gonna commit with these.

364
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,080
I think...

365
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,300
I think this is fine.

366
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,780
How should I get some more levels, guys?

367
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,960
How do you get more levels really fast?

368
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
I have more on my feet.

369
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,700
I'm breaking 3 power protection.

370
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,260
Oh my god, I'm breaking 3.

371
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,200
Oh my god, I'm asleep.

372
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,340
Okay.

373
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm just checking my chest plate real fast.

374
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm breaking 3.

375
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,680
You guys are so funny.

376
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,100
You guys are so funny.

377
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,780
You guys are so funny.

378
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
You guys are so funny.

379
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,720
You guys are so funny.

380
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,340
You guys are so funny.

381
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,320
You guys are so funny.

382
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,560
You guys are so funny.

383
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,520
You guys are so funny.

384
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:55,780
You guys are so funny.

385
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,160
You guys are so funny.

386
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,280
You guys are so funny.

387
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
You guys are so funny.

388
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,460
You guys are so funny.

389
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,760
You guys are so funny.

390
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,060
You guys are so funny.

391
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,100
You guys are so funny.

392
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,180
You guys are so funny.

393
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,860
You guys are so funny.

394
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,880
To the leather.

395
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,460
No, don't do that to us.

396
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,400
Mine's in coal.

397
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,920
Where can I find some coal?

398
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,200
Don't do that.

399
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
Where can I find some coal?

400
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,940
Min and I are two different types of sleepiness.

401
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,220
You're just... you're fatigued.

402
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,460
I'm just delusional.

403
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,740
I'm just delusional.

404
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,900
Oh my god, there's dogs!

405
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,400
I can't get to the home.

406
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,880
Oh my gosh, but the dogs went to home.

407
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,600
Get the dogs.

408
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,820
I can kill a bunch of animals.

409
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,640
Kill.

410
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,360
Kill.

411
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,540
I'm in my kill era.

412
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,100
I also, we have the leather books.

413
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,880
Leather and paper for books.

414
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,280
Oh yeah.

415
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,700
I think we have like 30.

416
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,260
We have a lot of books now.

417
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,180
But just in case we're trying to get feather falling.

418
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,060
Oh, that's true.

419
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,940
To refresh the enchantments, right?

420
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,920
Yeah, or something, you know.

421
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,760
Um...

422
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,200
I don't want to get my bones.

423
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,190
It's 430 and you're dying?

424
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
I'm already dead.

425
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm already dead.

426
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,560
I can't die anymore.

427
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,700
That's why it's just an actual hell for me.

428
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,940
You're just in hell.

429
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,420
I'm just in hell.

430
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,860
Because I'm tired.

431
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,780
I want to die, but I can't die.

432
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,920
What do you do when you can't die again?

433
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,780
What do you...

434
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,060
I wish we didn't die those three times.

435
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,640
Wait, there's two dogs here.

436
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,100
Yeah, I'm trying to get them right now.

437
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm trying to get those two dogs.

438
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,900
I'm trying to get them in my fucking army.

439
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,420
They will be the clutch.

440
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,760
This dog took four of my...

441
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,280
Oh my god.

442
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,380
Okay, this one's not picky.

443
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
Oh, there's coal here.

444
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,740
But there's a zombie too.

445
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,360
They're not picky.

446
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,700
They're not picky.

447
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:57,920
They're not picky.

448
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,900
You're gonna die here.

449
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,900
They're not picky.

450
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,520
I'm so happy.

451
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,520
You know what?

452
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm ready.

453
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm ready to go.

454
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm ready.

455
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,660
I'm ready.

456
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,040
Ready to go where?

457
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,580
I'm ready to...

458
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,260
I'm ready to find the stronghold.

459
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,540
I'm so ready, man.

460
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,440
I'm fucking... I'm ready to...

461
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm ready to go in.

462
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,180
Yes, we will.

463
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm so ready.

464
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,820
I'm so ready.

465
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,620
I'm so ready.

466
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,580
You don't know that.

467
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
I feel like...

468
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,080
I feel like...

469
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,500
I feel so strong.

470
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,140
I feel so strong now.

471
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,760
I feel like...

472
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I don't know.

473
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,060
I just feel something in me.

474
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm locked in.

475
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,840
We're gonna kill those...

476
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,920
I'm gonna kill those fucking...

477
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,040
I'm locking in.

478
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,940
I'm locking in with my aimbot.

479
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,480
I'm gonna lock in.

480
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,780
I'm gonna hit those towers.

481
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,660
And then it's gonna be so easy.

482
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,520
I've done it before.

483
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I can do it again.

484
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,840
I can...

485
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,020
I'm not delusional.

486
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,540
I swear to god.

487
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,580
I'm not...

488
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,740
I'm not delusional.

489
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,920
I can hit those...

490
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,700
I can hit those blocks.

491
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,600
It's gonna be so easy to hit them.

492
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,680
I swear.

493
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,900
It's gonna be so easy.

494
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm not the Lulu.

495
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,740
I'm not the Lulu.

496
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,080
I know I'm not.

497
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm not the Lulu.

498
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,420
I am.

499
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,020
Oh my gosh.

500
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,600
I mined so much.

501
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,260
And I didn't even get anything.

502
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,420
Wait, what dogs are you trying to get?

503
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,440
I already got them.

504
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,600
I got the two dogs.

505
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,540
There's two more dogs over here.

506
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,040
How many fucking dogs are there?

507
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,600
I don't have another bone though.

508
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,860
I already got my bones.

509
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,680
Are we mining the quartz?

510
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,620
No, we're not.

511
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
I'm going in.

512
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,780
We have to get a lot of levels, don't we?

513
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,920
I'm going in.

514
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,320
Don't go in, Mint.

515
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,140
Don't go in.

516
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,900
This is the one I'm going in.

517
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,840
How did you get...

518
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,540
How did you get...

519
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,040
How did you get the obsidian?

520
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,980
We have one more.

521
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,360
Don't come with me, dogs.

522
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,060
Where I'm going, I don't know if I'm coming back.

523
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,080
Where I'm going...

524
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,620
Where I'm going, I don't know.

525
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,400
I need to go back.

526
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,380
I forgot to bring my gold armor.

527
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,480
Get me back in.

528
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,760
Why isn't it getting me back in?

529
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,780
I almost didn't make it back.

530
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,120
There's a gold nugget.

531
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,580
Where's my gold chest?

532
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,580
That's the gold armor I threw away.

533
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,200
I can make a helmet.

534
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,580
I can make a helmet real quick.

535
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,640
There we go.

536
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,100
Alright, here I go.

537
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,680
Get me all your phantom membranes.

538
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,700
I got my one phantom membrane.

539
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,340
Where I'm going, I don't know if I'm coming back, Mint.

540
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,720
If you don't come back, then we're dead.

541
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,340
What do you mean your one phantom membrane?

542
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,520
There's nothing in here.

543
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,840
It's in your other chest.

544
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,660
I put it in your other chest.

545
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,620
No, it's not.

546
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,260
There's only two chests here.

547
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,280
I took it back.

548
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,880
I accidentally took it back.

549
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,400
It's back in my inventory.

550
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,080
I'm coming back.

551
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm coming back.

552
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,740
I'm here.

553
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,440
I'm here.

554
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,760
I'm here.

555
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Here, put it back.

556
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,140
I put it back.

557
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,500
Okay, thanks.

558
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,300
I got it.

559
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,620
I put it back.

560
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,260
I'm going back again.

561
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm going back.

562
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,780
Where's the redstone?

563
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,440
It's in your other chest.

564
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,460
Yeah, I got it.

565
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,180
Okay, guys.

566
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,540
To make this, I...

567
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,620
Oh wait, where's the glass?

568
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,600
The glass is in here.

569
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,420
I can make a bottle.

570
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,660
I'm ending the course.

571
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm at level 26.

572
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,900
They do stack.

573
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,080
They don't stack when there's stuff in it.

574
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,380
Oh, yeah.

575
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,840
That's basically it.

576
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,520
Okay, so I put the...

577
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,780
the excited...

578
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,520
the powder in here.

579
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,620
How much levels should I get?

580
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,760
Where is it in here?

581
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,220
Wait, then the exciting stuff in here.

582
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Oh, we need the water.

583
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,320
Yeah, we need the water.

584
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,300
How many what?

585
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,040
How many levels?

586
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,160
I'm at level 26 now.

587
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,300
Get as many as you can.

588
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,200
Okay, I'll get as many.

589
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,780
Just let me know when to come back.

590
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,260
When you're done with everything else, then I'll come back.

591
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
I'm just gonna keep farming until you're done with everything else.

592
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,420
Okay.

593
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,220
And then you have to know every other prep stuff and then we just...

594
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,080
we just go.

595
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,840
But I also need to get levels.

596
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,380
Oh, yeah.

597
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,020
Okay.

598
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,580
Okay.

599
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,280
When you're done...

600
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,660
When I get to 30, we swap.

601
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,160
I'm gonna leave some...

602
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm gonna leave some quartz for you.

603
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,120
I'm leaving some easy quartz.

604
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,660
I'm gonna go for the harder ones.

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,060
How do I make the eye of the ender?

606
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,780
We need...

607
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,820
The blaze rods thing first?

608
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,860
We have the blaze rods.

609
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,900
Oh my god, I have blaze rods.

610
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,220
I'm coming back down.

611
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm coming back.

612
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,580
You just took everything.

613
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,460
I did.

614
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,340
I did take everything.

615
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,800
I just never... I never had...

616
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,480
I never had it in my inventory.

617
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,480
Oh, cook the quartz for XP?

618
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,740
That's what they're for?

619
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,040
Yeah, the quartz are for XP.

620
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,040
Oh, I thought they meant farming them.

621
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,880
I thought they just meant farming them.

622
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,120
I didn't realize cooking them.

623
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,180
Where's this BGM?

624
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,800
This is my mental state right now.

625
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,860
My BGM.

626
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,940
That's how I feel right now.

627
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,180
I don't know how the others...

628
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,520
Are you listening to the fart competition too?

629
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,200
What?

630
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,860
What?

631
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,220
What?

632
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,200
What?

633
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,540
What are you talking about?

634
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,320
What are you...

635
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,120
What are you talking about?

636
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,860
The song!

637
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,800
You said your BGM!

638
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,740
I could put it on if you guys would listen to it.

639
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,020
Wait, you can cook the quartz?

640
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,660
Oh my god, I got one guy.

641
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,520
I got one guy.

642
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,700
They were like...

643
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,760
Okay, I gave you my blaze rods.

644
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,760
The blaze rods are in.

645
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,500
And I put emerald.

646
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,120
I think that's...

647
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,680
And I put all the lapis stuff.

648
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm going back in.

649
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,660
Oh, we have to pick it up with silk touch.

650
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,760
We don't have that.

651
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,860
We don't have that.

652
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,660
Oh wait, it's here.

653
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,140
I have a song, you guys.

654
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,620
Here you go.

655
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,340
This is the fart competition.

656
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,360
Music.

657
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,560
Alright.

658
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,720
When I hit 30, I'll let you...

659
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,380
I'll let you farm the other quartz.

660
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,080
I think we need...

661
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,700
30 is the minimum.

662
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,520
So we can have one more...

663
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,480
30 would be like one more enchantment that we get to have.

664
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,560
On level 30.

665
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,620
Cool.

666
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,940
There's so many quartz.

667
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,520
Thank god there's so many quartz.

668
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,640
Yes.

669
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,480
Okay.

670
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,440
Up we go.

671
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,240
Up we go.

672
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,640
Oh my god, it's over here.

673
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,620
It's over here.

674
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,330
Huh?

675
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,150
You're alive, okay?

676
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,510
You're alive.

677
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,670
Sorry.

678
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,710
Oh shit, we gotta sleep.

679
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,710
Oh shit.

680
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,150
Oh, I'm coming back.

681
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,710
Wait, can you sleep if I'm in the nether?

682
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,750
No, you have to be sleeping too.

683
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,330
Okay, I'm coming back.

684
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,970
I'm coming back.

685
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,050
I'm heading back right now.

686
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm running.

687
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,030
I'm fucking running over.

688
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,890
I'm running back.

689
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,190
I'm fucking running.

690
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,450
You wanna swap over so you can farm the quartz?

691
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,530
I left a lot of quartz to the right.

692
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,030
Okay, I got it.

693
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,710
I'm sleeping.

694
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,870
I'm here.

695
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,570
I'm sleeping.

696
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,530
I just don't wanna kill the pigs.

697
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,830
I feel like I'm gonna fucking die if I do.

698
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,450
I dropped some gold for you.

699
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,230
Oh, okay.

700
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,810
Guys, I feel like if I try to kill the pigmen, I will die.

701
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,130
Guys, I will 100% die if I try to kill them.

702
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,650
There's no way.

703
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,250
There's no way I will live.

704
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,950
There's no way.

705
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,010
There's no way.

706
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,110
What happened?

707
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,870
Why am I coming back

708
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,000
to my house?

709
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,360
It's not gonna hurt you.

710
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,980
He literally came out swinging his sword.

711
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,500
What?

712
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,220
Why?

713
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,320
And now he's a zombie.

714
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,280
I don't know why.

715
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,180
How did he...

716
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,900
How did we have an invader?

717
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,400
Okay.

718
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,800
Alright, I'm gonna do something really crazy.

719
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,900
He's a zombie now.

720
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,720
I'm gonna do something...

721
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,960
I'm gonna do something very crazy.

722
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,500
I'm gonna...

723
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,900
I'm gonna try and kill these pigs.

724
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,780
For XP.

725
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,140
What pigs?

726
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,420
Oh, the regular pigmen?

727
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

728
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,400
Oh, I can kill this guy.

729
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,640
Yeah, kill him.

730
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,680
Take his stuff.

731
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,340
Oh my god, here's some gold stuff too.

732
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,320
Alright.

733
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,900
Okay, I'm gonna do something very crazy.

734
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm gonna put a spectral arrow.

735
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,940
And then...

736
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,920
Okay, so I first do the nether wart, right?

737
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,200
Okay.

738
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,080
Do the wart.

739
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,260
And then I do...

740
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,860
Okay, I'm...

741
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,860
Yes.

742
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,900
This might be how I die.

743
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,820
Do I put it in here or in here?

744
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,220
This could be it.

745
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,880
Wart, membrane.

746
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,440
This could be how I die.

747
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,260
Wait, there's a lot of pigmen.

748
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,620
Maybe I'm not gonna do this.

749
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,100
Actually, I'm just gonna farm cores.

750
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,560
Wart, membrane, redstone.

751
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,220
Put it...

752
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,580
Of course I saw it here.

753
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,340
Oh, I have to fuel it with the blaze powder.

754
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:44,980
Oh, okay.

755
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,160
Alright.

756
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,680
Yeah, you guys, I realized how bad of an idea that was.

757
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,980
I'm already in too deep.

758
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,940
I'm already in too deep.

759
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,960
Alright.

760
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,380
You're doing it.

761
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,420
I'm level 30.

762
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,440
You can go and farm some cores if you need to.

763
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm gonna make a trail for you to follow.

764
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,960
Follow this trail.

765
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,740
To farm cores for levels.

766
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,020
I made a torch trail.

767
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,140
Follow it and then you'll find lots of cores around you.

768
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,580
Now the membrane.

769
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,340
I got it.

770
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,480
I made a torch trail for you.

771
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,300
Is it working?

772
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,700
Is it working?

773
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,420
Where do I need the blaze powder to?

774
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,220
I'm here.

775
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,900
Oh, next to the redstone.

776
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm gonna check for...

777
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,160
Did it work?

778
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,140
Don't mind the gold.

779
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,960
Just remember not to mind the gold.

780
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,360
But it's not long.

781
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,560
It's not long.

782
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,100
Wait, but it's only a minute and thirty.

783
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,860
Oh, redstone now.

784
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,640
Okay, okay.

785
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,560
Breaking projectiles.

786
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,040
Okay, now redstone.

787
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,680
There we go.

788
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,040
We're doing it.

789
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,740
I need to reset.

790
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,460
How do I reset again?

791
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,760
Do I just put a book in here?

792
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Is that it?

793
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,020
Yeah, you have to reset your gacha with something else.

794
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
Like with my book, right?

795
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,860
Yeah, I think so.

796
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,000
And it resets all three?

797
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,040
Yeah.

798
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,280
You have all the other books.

799
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,500
Oh, I have books.

800
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,680
Yeah, you can pass me.

801
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,060
And the lapis, here you go.

802
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Okay, uh...

803
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
What do I not need?

804
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
Alright, let's reset.

805
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,060
Awkward potions, awkward potions.

806
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Um...

807
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,800
Wait, I need the blaze powder here.

808
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,020
I guess I'll...

809
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,940
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

810
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm scared.

811
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,900
I'll do this then.

812
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,380
I'll reset level one.

813
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,080
It's still powered.

814
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,840
Oh, okay.

815
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,280
Now I go back to...

816
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,440
Wait, what do I get then?

817
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,560
Projectile...

818
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,220
Oh, I see!

819
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,400
Fire protection, blast protection 2.

820
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,840
Oh, blast protection 2!

821
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,480
We're doing it.

822
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,240
The blaze rod should last us a while.

823
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:29,960
Blast protection!

824
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,460
Oh, blast protection 4!

825
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh, nice!

826
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,540
Yeah, there's a blast protection 4 here.

827
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:36,980
Okay.

828
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Alright.

829
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,780
Okay.

830
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,600
Back in there we go.

831
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,510
Almost forgot.

832
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,050
I almost forgot something.

833
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,210
Oh, wait, you don't want the blast protection.

834
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,470
You want regular protection.

835
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,430
Oh.

836
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,950
Oh!

837
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,390
I keep forgetting.

838
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:01,850
Okay.

839
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,530
Okay, so I have to reset again.

840
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,210
Okay.

841
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,900
And then we do a redstone.

842
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,780
You know, I don't want to just hold on to it.

843
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,040
Okay.

844
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,900
How many levels do we need for...

845
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,240
What level are you now?

846
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,120
25.

847
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,260
But I'm about to be at 0.

848
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,960
But how are you about to be 0?

849
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,360
Because I want to put the protection on my chest.

850
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,920
No, it just takes a couple of levels.

851
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,000
It doesn't take the whole thing.

852
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,580
Oh.

853
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,080
Never mind.

854
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,040
It just takes a couple.

855
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Okay, where are the other quartz?

856
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,860
Oh my god.

857
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,340
At the membrane.

858
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,000
Where are the other quartz?

859
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,440
Oh, not the soul sand.

860
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,740
Why is the soul sand right next to us?

861
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,680
I need like one more.

862
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,380
Okay.

863
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,300
Okay.

864
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,240
Okay, I'll leave this for you.

865
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,140
I'll leave this.

866
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,220
I'll leave this for you.

867
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,360
And then I'm gonna...

868
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,720
Yeah, because don't you need them for farm?

869
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,340
I left you...

870
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,940
Quartz.

871
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,460
I left you quartz.

872
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,540
Levels.

873
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,200
Don't you need the levels?

874
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,740
Yeah.

875
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah.

876
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,280
Yeah.

877
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,200
One life.

878
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,480
One life, guys.

879
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,400
If we don't make it here, it's over.

880
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,920
We'll do this next time.

881
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,360
When we're not...

882
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,800
When we're more prepared.

883
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,420
I watched the video.

884
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,100
Who would've thought it would take us...

885
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,880
Four hours.

886
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,840
It wasn't us.

887
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,660
It's not even our fault.

888
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,580
It was the fortress.

889
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,480
It was the fortress.

890
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,980
It wasn't even our fault.

891
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,600
It was the fortress.

892
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:06,920
It was the fortress.

893
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,600
It was the fucking fortress.

894
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,960
We could've fucking finished this so long ago.

895
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,160
With the fucking fortress.

896
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,260
Protection 2.

897
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,040
Blast protection.

898
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,560
What am I putting here?

899
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,460
Where am I at?

900
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,540
Wait, the membrane.

901
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,860
Just protection.

902
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,620
Okay.

903
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,340
Do I reset?

904
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,960
I'll just get this.

905
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,480
I'll just get the radio protection.

906
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,500
Oh, shit.

907
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,260
I feel like if I just...

908
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,200
Yeah, I don't wanna...

909
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Okay, and then...

910
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,920
Okay, and then that should reset the others too, right?

911
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,240
Protection 4!

912
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,240
Let's go!

913
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,980
Okay, helmet's protection 4.

914
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,000
And then...

915
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,560
Feet is also protection 4.

916
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,540
Okay, I'll get the helmet.

917
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay, we got all the slow fallings.

918
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,480
Hopefully that's enough.

919
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,080
Alright, you can go grind some quartz first.

920
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,580
Because I've been hogging the quartz.

921
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,080
Hold on, I gotta make more potions.

922
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,460
Okay.

923
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,480
Alright, I'll go check if I can find other ways to grind.

924
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,140
I'll just go for the harder quartz to find.

925
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,980
Okay, then...

926
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,380
I can do...

927
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,880
I'll just go for the harder places to find quartz.

928
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,980
So I don't take the easy ones.

929
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,220
I made torches.

930
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,220
Pathway for you to get the easy ones.

931
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,500
For quartz.

932
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,580
So...

933
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
This should be fine.

934
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,600
So...

935
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,160
We're not gonna...

936
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,800
We're not gonna...

937
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,660
Guys, we're not...

938
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,240
We're not...

939
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,760
We can't cook quartz.

940
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,500
We got lied to before and it doesn't work.

941
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,080
Cooking quartz doesn't work.

942
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,880
It's all fake news.

943
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,260
What am I cooking quartz?

944
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,980
It said you can cook quartz, but you have to use silk touch the quartz to cook them.

945
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:35,980
What?

946
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,260
I've never heard that.

947
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,520
Copper on furnace can give you good XP.

948
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,700
Oh, put copper in furnace.

949
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,460
We have a lot of copper.

950
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,920
I don't need fire resist, but it breathes fire.

951
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,120
Oh, regen potion.

952
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,380
Oh.

953
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,820
Okay.

954
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,580
Oh, you had a gas tier.

955
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,420
Okay, I got it.

956
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,000
I thought you had some too.

957
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,120
I do.

958
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,780
I have three.

959
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,540
I remember you had some as well.

960
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,300
Okay.

961
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,220
So now I do the gas tier and then I do the brick stone as usual.

962
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,000
I forgot I can...

963
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,760
Wait, so what was the point of the magma?

964
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,540
I think there was no point.

965
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,380
I think they were trying to tell us it was useless.

966
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,580
Breathe weird purple pain gas.

967
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,600
That's weird.

968
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,240
Oh, it's for the fortress.

969
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,160
Wait, we don't have...

970
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,540
Wait, what?

971
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,460
The glowstone?

972
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,140
Wouldn't it be better if it lasted longer than the glowstone?

973
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,560
Okay, I'm mining.

974
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,680
I'm mining.

975
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,380
Alright, I got...

976
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
I got some...

977
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,440
I'll put some coins.

978
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:15,060
If I get two more, I can get protection four on both of my fucking items.

979
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,740
Do you know...

980
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,680
Do you see any glowstone in there?

981
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,840
Yeah, I can get some.

982
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,340
What do you need glowstone for?

983
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,280
For the potions.

984
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,420
Okay, I'll grab them then.

985
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,040
I wish making potions gave you experience.

986
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,560
You can put some stuff in the furnace.

987
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,620
I have nothing though.

988
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,620
Don't we have like copper?

989
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,420
I thought we had copper.

990
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,120
I thought we had a lot of copper.

991
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,480
I don't see it.

992
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,220
I think you got rid of all the copper.

993
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,080
Oh, I might have.

994
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,240
Am I throwing them away?

995
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,500
Honestly, I'm not surprised.

996
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,180
Okay, I got that experience.

997
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,740
Oh, there's a meat.

998
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Thanks, guys.

999
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,680
Oh, I have lots of meat.

1000
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,840
Right here.

1001
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm gonna have to grab some more rocks here.

1002
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,520
So I can make sure not to accidentally mine the gold.

1003
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,080
I'll go grab the glowstone.

1004
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,540
What is happening?

1005
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,860
We're doing the final preparation.

1006
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,500
Can I cook the ancient debris in the blast furnace?

1007
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,920
You can, I'm pretty sure, right?

1008
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,980
It seems like you could.

1009
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,140
Okay.

1010
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,500
I've lost my grip of reality when I thought I had two dogs.

1011
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,300
What am I cooking?

1012
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,120
I'm scared.

1013
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,400
Will it still work?

1014
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,640
Oh wait, it turned into scrap.

1015
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,820
I remember it turning into scrap.

1016
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,360
It'll go away.

1017
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,820
It'll go away.

1018
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,260
It's gonna go away.

1019
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,840
It's gonna...

1020
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,100
It's gonna go away, guys.

1021
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,120
The gas is gonna go away.

1022
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,260
Don't...

1023
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,640
The gas will go away.

1024
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,420
The gas is gonna go away, I believe.

1025
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,860
I believe.

1026
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,960
The blast furnace gives you half XP?

1027
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,440
No way.

1028
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,760
I knew it was gonna go away.

1029
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,720
That's a scam.

1030
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,120
That's a scam.

1031
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,300
I can't believe it.

1032
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,100
How did they do 20 days of this?

1033
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,500
They were barely alive.

1034
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,740
They were...

1035
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,480
Did you watch all of it?

1036
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,960
No, I watched some of it, but they were not alive.

1037
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,400
I think like by day 7, they weren't even like alive anymore.

1038
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,040
They weren't even there anymore.

1039
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,020
It was just...

1040
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,180
It's so sad.

1041
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,760
I remember that day.

1042
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:24,800
Paisenat and Speed, when they did their infamous Minecraft challenge, they were not alive.

1043
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:36,220
They like... Okay, you know what's really... They like streamed their showers and everything too.

1044
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,500
Yeah!

1045
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:48,320
They were in their swimming trunks, but they were like you know, they basically showered on stream and everything.

1046
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,840
I have glowstone.

1047
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,980
I put it in your potion box thing.

1048
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,800
Trying to find more animals to kill.

1049
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,320
I'm hungry for blood.

1050
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,280
Alright, I'm gonna enchant my boots.

1051
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,740
Boots, boots, boots, boots.

1052
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,060
Oh, armadillo, I could never hurt you.

1053
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,260
What the hell is this?

1054
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,040
What the fuck?

1055
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,660
I don't have feather falling on it though, so that's unfortunate, but that's the best I can do.

1056
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,540
What is this thing?

1057
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,620
I got an armadillo scoot.

1058
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,700
Oh, that's to make the armor.

1059
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,320
That's to make the armor.

1060
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,320
You can make armor for your dog.

1061
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,980
Yeah, you're the one that told me that.

1062
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,260
I know, but I didn't know what it was when I grabbed it.

1063
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,540
Oh, I put glow dust in the area.

1064
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,420
Also, we're gonna have to really stock up on food, so we'll have to...

1066
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,180
I have a lot of bread, so...

1067
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,380
But meat gives more...

1068
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,560
Okay, I have

1069
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,780
cows or...

1070
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,140
Any of them.

1071
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
I'm grabbing some of them.

1072
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,860
I can kill some of them right now.

1073
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,580
I'm heading over.

1074
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,360
I'm heading over.

1075
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,300
I'm fucking ready for blood.

1076
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,640
I can go to the courts.

1077
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,720
Yeah, you go farm courts.

1078
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,400
I'll go get some meat for us.

1079
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,480
Okay.

1080
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,020
I was just trying to make these.

1081
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,400
I put glow dust too.

1082
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,280
You wanna put stuff in the glow dust?

1083
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,920
And...

1084
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,640
Wait, does water work in the ender?

1085
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,020
Yeah.

1086
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,520
Oh, okay.

1087
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,380
Oh my god.

1088
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,380
You can have a scoot.

1089
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,380
You can see how ugly it looks.

1090
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,260
Oh no, I'm pretty sure it sounds ugly.

1091
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,020
It's really ugly.

1092
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,480
It sounds very ugly.

1093
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,620
Okay, so now we glow stone it.

1094
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,900
Now we glow stone it.

1095
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,440
Alright.

1096
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,640
Okay, I got us...

1097
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,580
I need lamb chops.

1098
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,320
I'm gonna throw away this meat too.

1099
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,720
And then...

1100
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,480
What did we wanna bring?

1101
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,140
Snowmen.

1102
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,380
No we don't.

1103
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:07,900
No.

1104
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,840
There's no point.

1105
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,840
Snowmen doesn't...

1106
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,000
There was a point.

1107
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,100
Oh my gosh.

1108
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,140
So the endermen don't come near us because the endermen don't like the snow.

1109
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,620
That's important, right?

1110
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,380
I don't think we have snow though.

1111
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,500
We need silk touch.

1112
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,000
We don't have that.

1113
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,460
So this is our one life.

1114
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,320
Water works better than snow.

1115
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:31,700
Oh!

1116
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,040
I have a bucket anyway.

1117
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,140
I almost messed it up.

1118
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,340
I almost messed it up.

1119
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,500
We can just make a water pool in the center.

1120
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,700
We just bring two buckets.

1121
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,380
One would be used as a water pool.

1122
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,380
So we get bait the endermen.

1123
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,060
We can like just put a pool.

1124
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,360
There is a way to shovel.

1125
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,400
We'll use a shovel to pick up snow and then we can turn the snowballs into cubes.

1126
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,700
But...

1127
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,740
If water is fine...

1128
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,420
Yeah, let's just use water.

1129
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,220
It's just easier.

1130
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,840
Water bucket is just easier.

1131
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,460
Make sure I have... Oh my god, there's so much sheep here.

1132
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm getting the sheep.

1133
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,560
Goodbye sheep.

1134
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,240
We need you to die so we can live.

1135
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,940
This is what my power is for.

1136
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,100
I got the glowstone.

1137
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,480
Glow dust.

1138
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,240
Let's see.

1139
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:36,720
Chicken.

1140
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh my gosh, this blaze rod lasted forever.

1141
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,740
That's awesome.

1142
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,000
Yeah, you can make three potions I think.

1143
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,060
That's what they said.

1144
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,320
Yeah, but one...

1145
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,160
I've only used it...

1146
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,920
Okay, so one blaze rod turns into two powders and I've only used one powder this entire time.

1147
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,340
Oh wait, that's...

1148
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,680
That's a lot.

1149
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,740
Wowee, we're learning so much about Minecraft from this challenge.

1150
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,040
We're learning so much.

1151
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,560
Wow.

1152
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,240
Did you like participate in a competition and win?

1153
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,680
How do you not know anything?

1154
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,280
The competition has nothing to do with Minecraft.

1155
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,000
It's just parkour and mini games.

1156
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,620
And I played Valorant.

1157
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,700
I somehow was able to play Valorant in Minecraft.

1158
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,800
I don't know how, but I played Valorant in Minecraft.

1159
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,000
Wow.

1160
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,760
Okay.

1161
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,780
And we have to do that competition again on Monday.

1162
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,800
Not Monday, on Saturday.

1163
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,620
Oh my god.

1164
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,100
Where am I?

1165
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,060
I got so offended, you guys.

1166
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,420
Where am I?

1167
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,960
Oh my god.

1168
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,120
Where am I?

1169
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,420
How did I get lost?

1170
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,820
Okay, okay.

1171
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,620
I'm looking at the coordinates right now.

1172
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,960
I'm like wondering where I went.

1173
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,260
I traveled so far.

1174
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,280
Oh, we put pumpkin heads!

1175
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,100
Pumpkin heads!

1176
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,440
Pumpkin heads makes Enderman neutral.

1177
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,000
So we wear pumpkin heads.

1178
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,060
They won't...

1179
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,940
Oh, that's true.

1180
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,260
That's true.

1181
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,060
Nevermind.

1182
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,480
Oh wait, does this count?

1183
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,340
You guys, I have nothing left.

1184
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,140
I have no dust powder.

1185
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,160
No blaze powder left.

1186
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,200
Heading back.

1187
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,900
I think I'm heading back.

1188
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,520
Guys, I'm lost.

1189
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
Where did I go?

1190
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,680
I don't know where I went.

1191
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,280
I don't want to use a whole blaze powder.

1192
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,180
You think it's fine?

1193
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,100
Just for three potions, guys?

1194
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Is this where I went?

1195
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,230
Is this where I went?

1196
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:56,070
How did I go so far?

1197
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,470
Are you not able to sleep?

1198
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,150
I'm trying.

1199
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,830
Oh my god.

1200
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,370
Am I heading the right way?

1201
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,290
Yes, I am.

1202
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:10,870
Yes, I am.

1203
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:11,550
I'm coming back.

1204
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,510
I don't know.

1205
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,410
I don't know how I got here.

1206
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,950
I'm heading back now.

1207
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,950
I'm heading back.

1208
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,550
I see the tower.

1209
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,790
I know where you are.

1210
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,250
Oh, I see you.

1211
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,790
I see you.

1212
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,210
I'm here.

1213
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:28,930
Alright, let's sleep.

1214
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,370
I got lots of meat for us.

1215
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:32,610
Hello, boy.

1216
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:34,630
Alright.

1217
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,370
There's a creeper right over the way.

1218
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,590
Oh, it's okay.

1219
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,930
It's not like he's going to come over here and kill us.

1220
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:42,910
Nah, he wouldn't do that.

1221
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:43,710
He wouldn't do it.

1222
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,130
That's such a piece of shit.

1223
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:47,070
Yeah.

1224
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,990
Oh my god, I have so much lamb.

1225
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,510
I'm going to put the meat here.

1226
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,630
And then...

1227
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:57,690
Uh...

1228
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,310
I'll put the raw meat here.

1229
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,790
And try to find more meat for us.

1230
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,630
Wait, where did my...

1231
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,650
Guys, where did my...

1232
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,930
Where did my...

1233
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,390
Where did my...

1234
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,110
Where did the thing underneath go?

1235
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,230
What did I press?

1236
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,710
What did I...

1237
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,290
Oh, F1.

1238
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,470
Wait, that's not F1?

1239
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:18,430
It's not F1?

1240
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:20,430
What did I...

1241
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,080
What?

1242
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,560
That's...

1243
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,780
Why is F1...

1244
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,000
Why is F1 that?

1245
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,020
What?

1246
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:32,580
Wait.

1247
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,980
I pressed F1.

1248
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,380
What are you talking about?

1249
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,000
How do I...

1250
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,180
Oh.

1251
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,820
Oh, that's what I did.

1252
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,940
No, I couldn't see my...

1253
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,840
I couldn't see my thing for a while.

1254
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,680
I was going crazy.

1255
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,200
I couldn't see...

1256
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,280
Yeah, I couldn't see my HUD.

1257
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,400
I was trying to figure out how to unhud it.

1258
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,620
Or hud it back.

1259
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,300
Hud it back.

1260
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,260
Okay.

1261
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,560
I got it.

1262
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,880
What else do we need, chat?

1263
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,000
What else do we need, chat?

1264
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,940
I'm going into the nether.

1265
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,060
Get your quartz.

1266
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,220
I'm farming more meat.

1267
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,320
Okay.

1268
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,580
What else do we need?

1269
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,520
Follow my torches.

1270
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,740
You'll find lots of quartz there.

1271
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,720
Okay.

1272
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,640
You got this, Min.

1273
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm getting us meat.

1274
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,560
I'm back here once again.

1275
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,340
We're back in hell.

1276
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,080
We never thought we'd be back.

1277
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,420
But here we are.

1278
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,740
Back in hell.

1279
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,860
Back in hell.

1280
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,040
I hate you.

1281
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,860
We never thought we'd be back.

1282
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,040
But here we are.

1283
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,240
Okay, I'm following your torches.

1284
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,740
Oh, here's some.

1285
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,900
Oh, here's some.

1286
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,280
Okay.

1287
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,360
I'm mining.

1288
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,360
I got to level 30.

1289
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,480
That's all you need.

1290
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,320
Wait, when you reset, does mine also reset?

1291
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,200
I don't think so, right?

1292
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,060
That shouldn't be the case, right, everybody?

1293
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,220
Like, you're...

1294
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,620
Okay, so now I have to...

1295
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,740
Alright, I can get...

1296
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,980
I can reset it here.

1297
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,640
No?

1298
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,240
Okay, so...

1299
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,560
Okay, that's good to know.

1300
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,980
Alright, I have a lot of different types of meat for us, too.

1301
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,580
Farmed a lot.

1302
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,700
So I think...

1303
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,380
I think we should have enough.

1304
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,120
We should have enough for the dragon.

1305
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,840
It's like KBBQ up in here.

1306
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,160
Yeah, we have all different flavors.

1307
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,460
All...

1308
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,200
Different flavors and tastes.

1309
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,540
And variety.

1310
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:46,780
And variety.

1311
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,140
Exciting!

1312
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,980
Alright, here we go.

1313
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,040
I'm coming back.

1314
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,740
I'm coming back with all the meat.

1315
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,400
And I'm just gonna start burning them.

1316
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,720
I'm gonna start burning them and then...

1317
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,880
Oh my God, that's a skelly.

1318
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,580
Oh my God.

1319
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,980
Wait, how did you get to...

1320
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,880
Did you get to...

1321
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,380
I'm gonna die.

1322
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,180
Mint!

1323
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,740
Mint!

1324
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,360
Mint!

1325
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,340
I'm coming back!

1326
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,320
I'm coming back!

1327
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,100
I'm running back!

1328
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
I'm running to the nether!

1329
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,420
I killed him!

1330
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:20,900
I killed him!

1331
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,280
I killed the ghast!

1332
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,400
He was low enough for me to kill him.

1333
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,800
Okay, okay, that's good.

1334
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,760
I'm still running over.

1335
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,040
I'm still running over.

1336
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,460
I'm not gonna die.

1337
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,920
You got this.

1338
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,340
Maybe I will die.

1339
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,300
No, don't say that.

1340
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,240
Don't ruin my portal, please.

1341
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,720
Don't say that.

1342
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,340
I want us to die at the end.

1343
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,060
If we're gonna die, we have to die at least...

1344
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,040
Make it to the end of dragon where we're gonna die.

1345
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,580
That's where we're gonna die.

1346
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,580
I'd rather it be there than anywhere else.

1347
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,380
I can't leave.

1348
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,800
I can't leave.

1349
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,240
I'm stuck in here and I have no food.

1350
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,720
Yeah, because I can't get through the portal.

1351
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,520
Or else he's gonna destroy it.

1352
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:04,660
No!

1353
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,840
Don't destroy the portal, please!

1354
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,620
I can't run!

1355
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,800
I'm heading over!

1356
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,700
I don't think you can do anything...

1357
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,660
Unless you have a...

1358
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,020
Go, go, go!

1359
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
Go through the portal!

1360
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,860
Go through it!

1361
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,380
I'm here!

1362
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,720
Uh-oh.

1363
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,920
Go through the portal.

1364
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,060
You're fine.

1365
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,420
I'm here.

1366
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,540
Did you get through?

1367
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,520
No, no, no.

1368
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,040
I'm farming.

1369
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,020
I'm gonna farm some quartz.

1370
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,660
It's okay.

1371
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,300
I'm here.

1372
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:36,820
I'm here.

1373
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,380
I'm here.

1374
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,100
I'll protect.

1375
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,580
I'll protect the portal.

1376
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,080
I got another gas tier.

1377
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:43,880
Lucky.

1378
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,660
That's not a regen.

1379
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,260
I can make...

1380
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,360
I can make six more regens.

1381
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,700
That's good.

1382
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,980
Should we do?

1383
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,320
Should we do?

1384
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,100
Anymore quartz near us?

1385
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,180
No, I didn't have any bows and arrows.

1386
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,900
I just went in.

1387
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,100
Raw dogging it, baby.

1388
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,200
Go in.

1389
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,760
So many fucking piglings.

1390
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,640
Oh, I didn't get a thing.

1391
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,660
Piglings.

1392
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,060
They're everywhere.

1393
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,880
I'm doing something very...

1394
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,020
Oh, I can't do this.

1395
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,380
I can't do this.

1396
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,340
I can't.

1397
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,380
Oh my god, there he is.

1398
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,380
Nope.

1399
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,200
Nope.

1400
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,700
Nope.

1401
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:51,690
Don't do that.

1402
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,530
Don't do that.

1403
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,070
Don't do that.

1404
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:55,550
Don't do that.

1405
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,350
Oh, thank god.

1406
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,870
Okay, okay.

1407
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,750
Yes, I'm alright.

1408
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:00,330
I'm alright.

1409
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,390
I was fucking bobbing and weaving.

1410
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,910
Bobbing and weaving him.

1411
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,170
Do you need me to cover you?

1412
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:05,930
No, I'm alright.

1413
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:06,510
I'm alright.

1414
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:06,990
I'm safe.

1415
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:07,850
I made it through.

1416
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,110
The gas doesn't know.

1417
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,670
The gas doesn't know.

1418
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,830
Okay, alright.

1419
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,050
Gas is stupid, dumbass.

1420
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,190
Stupid as hell.

1421
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:18,110
Stupid.

1422
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,450
Where's all the books?

1423
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,750
I have them here.

1424
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,030
And I'll put the lapis on the second chest.

1425
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,330
I have lapis.

1426
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,050
There was some more.

1427
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:28,750
Okay.

1428
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,750
Okay, um...

1429
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,550
I'm just gonna kill wildlife.

1430
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,050
Oh, I have infinity!

1431
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:39,430
Wait, that's good!

1432
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,930
I need level 30.

1433
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,550
Wait, aren't you level 30?

1434
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:44,990
I'm 28.

1435
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,150
I used my levels to do another thing.

1436
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,290
Oh, okay.

1437
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,190
That's not good.

1438
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,350
Let me see if I have anything you can cook.

1439
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,070
Wait, if the thing...

1440
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,530
Can you get XP from me?

1441
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,710
Cooking meat?

1442
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:58,730
Yeah, you can.

1443
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:01,530
Okay, I put some stuff in there so you can grab the meat for...

1444
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,590
What the hell is a bundle?

1445
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,530
What do you mean?

1446
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,590
I just looked at my...

1447
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,270
Things I can create.

1448
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,410
And what is a bundle?

1449
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:11,890
I don't know.

1450
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,530
Yeah, just get the stove for XP.

1451
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,670
It can hold a mixed stack of...

1452
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,150
What?

1453
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,370
What is this?

1454
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,370
Oh, extra storage?

1455
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,370
Yeah!

1456
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,950
Break the furnace for XP?

1457
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:29,550
It's full.

1458
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,550
How do I make it empty?

1459
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,930
I'm gonna see if there's any animals I can kill.

1460
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,130
Oh, I can kill the squids.

1461
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,970
Yeah, you're right.

1462
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,550
Wait, you can kill squids for XP?

1463
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,710
Squids and fish...

1464
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,090
You can kill anything for XP.

1465
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,490
I'm gonna swim out.

1466
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,650
I'm gonna swim out.

1467
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,710
I think we got all the quartz too at the...

1468
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,770
We got all the quartz that are close to...

1469
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:00,130
In the near area.

1470
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1471
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,110
I think the others are just way too dangerous for us to farm at that point.

1472
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,850
I'm just gonna kill the animals.

1473
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,390
It's true, because there's like skellies and gas in that area really badly.

1474
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,930
Yeah.

1475
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,190
I would advise not to go any further.

1476
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,690
I farmed all the ones that were far, but like...

1477
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,730
Not dangerous.

1478
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,670
Cook the fish too.

1479
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,710
Cook the fish.

1480
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:24,310
Yeah, just cook any types of meat and stuff.

1481
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,470
I cook the fish.

1482
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,270
You cook the fish?

1483
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,230
You cook the fish?

1484
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,750
I cook the fish.

1485
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,990
I wish I could kill the birds.

1486
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,490
I wish I could just kill the birds that are flying up here.

1487
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:37,550
I wish I could just...

1488
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,330
I don't see any birds.

1489
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,010
No, they exist!

1490
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,150
They're there!

1491
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,770
No, they're not.

1492
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,390
There's no birds.

1493
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,370
They're real!

1494
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,070
They're real to me.

1495
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:49,990
They're real!

1496
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,110
What does that mean?

1497
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,970
It's a shared hallucination.

1498
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,190
It's a shared hallucination.

1499
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,030
Oh, they're real to me.

1500
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,310
They're real to me.

1501
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,130
Yeah.

1502
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,070
So is Santa Claus.

1503
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,610
Oh, Santa Claus is real.

1504
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,970
I know, he's real to me.

1505
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,430
He's real to all of us.

1506
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:15,270
Oh, it would be so sad if I died by drowning if that was the way I go.

1507
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,990
That would just be really sad.

1508
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:22,410
That would be so sad if that was the way I decided to go after everything I've been through.

1509
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,530
I decided to just drown and put myself out of my misery.

1510
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,130
That's a valiant way to go down, probably.

1511
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,410
Oh, die.

1512
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,270
Die, squid, die.

1513
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:39,930
Your life is meaningless.

1514
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:40,830
I'm going so fast.

1515
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,910
We have to go back, it's almost night time.

1516
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:45,450
Okay.

1517
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,750
I'm killing the fish.

1518
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,610
I'm killing the cows.

1519
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,890
I'm gonna kill the cows.

1520
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,530
And I'm gonna kill the chicken.

1521
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,730
Kill the chicken.

1522
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,530
Kill the cow.

1523
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:00,310
Kill the koala.

1524
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:01,970
Oh my god.

1525
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,690
I'm gonna salad fingers these.

1526
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,310
Salad fingers.

1527
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,630
Oh no.

1528
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,510
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

1529
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,630
Oh yeah, check the furnace.

1530
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:17,810
For XP.

1531
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,730
I will, I have been sleep.

1532
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:21,690
Okay.

1533
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,690
Did you get enough XP?

1534
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:25,190
No.

1535
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,090
I have like nothing.

1536
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,030
How much does it give you?

1537
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,470
I'm still...

1538
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,190
I'm not even halfway through 28.

1539
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,890
Do we need all those enchantments?

1540
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:39,750
Do we...

1541
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,550
Do we really need everything?

1542
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:47,910
Everybody.

1543
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,150
Guys, do we really need...

1544
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,530
If we stock up on all the potions...

1545
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:58,890
Remember how I said we gotta farm all the redstone for XP?

1546
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,790
I did.

1547
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:02,330
I did.

1548
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,570
I did.

1549
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,710
I farmed as much as we could.

1550
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,710
I know, I'm just saying.

1551
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,010
I was at level 35.

1552
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,870
Yeah, we have to have infinity at least on one of our bows though.

1553
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,810
Yeah, I have power.

1554
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,470
Do you have arrows?

1555
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:22,690
I can give you some of the arrows I made.

1556
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,770
If I have infinity, I only need one.

1557
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,490
Oh, that's true.

1558
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:28,630
Doesn't it...

1559
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,770
Sometimes it runs out.

1560
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,910
It's literally called infinity.

1561
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,270
Wouldn't it like break?

1562
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,110
Wait, really?

1563
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,570
You're thinking of like the bow will break.

1564
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:41,310
Oh!

1565
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,190
Okay, yeah, I can give you one of the...

1566
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:44,990
I'll give you one of my arrows.

1567
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,350
Yeah, we do need anvil though to make it...

1568
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,150
Yeah, there's an anvil.

1569
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,310
I made an anvil already.

1570
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,450
We have an anvil, everybody.

1571
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,310
We're set.

1572
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,230
Where's more coal that I can mine?

1573
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,870
Just killing the wildlife.

1574
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,550
Do horses give XP?

1575
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,610
Oh, I don't think so.

1576
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:09,690
Do horses...

1577
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:10,670
There's a lot of horses.

1578
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,970
I'm thinking about it.

1579
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,850
Just kill one and test it for science.

1580
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,170
No, because they hit back.

1581
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,610
They fight back.

1582
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,010
The other wildlife don't fight back.

1583
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,610
They do.

1584
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,210
They do give XP.

1585
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:28,470
Yes!

1586
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:30,710
Yes!

1587
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,090
Yes!

1588
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,130
Okay, they do.

1589
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,250
They do.

1590
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:37,950
I found a lot of lappers.

1591
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,410
Oh my God.

1592
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,430
Do armadillos give XP?

1593
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,350
No, don't kill the armadillos.

1594
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,230
Do they give XP?

1595
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:45,510
Probably not.

1596
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,330
Don't listen to me.

1597
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,730
Do they give XP?

1598
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,470
I'm gonna do it.

1599
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,810
I don't need to know.

1600
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:56,890
They do.

1601
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:58,030
They do.

1602
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,230
I'm fucking going in.

1603
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:03,690
I'm going in.

1604
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,670
I'm getting us meat for food.

1605
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,310
I have so much meat right now.

1606
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,310
Oh, there's a pillager right here.

1607
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,210
Uh oh.

1608
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,350
Uh oh.

1609
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,090
I'm gonna not look at him.

1610
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,890
Where did I get that?

1611
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,790
I'm not gonna look at him.

1612
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,730
I'm fucking bloodthirsty right now.

1613
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,890
I'll kill anything and everything except for the pillager.

1614
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,010
Because I don't want to deal with that.

1615
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,750
I'll kill anything.

1616
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,770
Then let's start the raid.

1617
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,170
Remember, you get the potion now.

1618
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,270
Oh, okay.

1619
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,270
I'll just go kill him then.

1620
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,750
Yeah, kill him.

1621
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,970
Who cares about his measly little life?

1622
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,290
He's a pathetic man.

1623
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,450
Woah.

1624
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,350
Pathetic little pillager guy.

1625
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:46,810
Woah.

1626
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:49,650
Alright.

1627
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,050
I guess I'll go kill him now.

1628
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,290
He's a pathetic little guy.

1629
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:55,970
Did he disappear?

1630
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,790
Where did he go?

1631
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:58,650
He heard you.

1632
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,550
He's afraid of me.

1633
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,170
He actually heard you.

1634
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,030
He despawned.

1635
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,290
He actually despawned.

1636
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,170
He actually despawned.

1637
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,530
He's like, nah.

1638
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,170
He's like, nah, F that.

1639
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:12,770
I'm out.

1640
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,190
Oh my god.

1641
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,670
Never mess with me, little pillager man.

1642
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,410
He ran away so fast.

1643
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,110
Oh my god.

1644
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,790
There's lots of dripstone in here.

1645
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:26,770
He actually disappeared.

1646
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:28,650
I was ready.

1647
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,450
That's my power.

1648
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,350
He got scared.

1649
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:34,770
Oh, baby.

1650
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,810
Oh, baby man.

1651
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,250
Do donkeys give...

1652
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,590
It doesn't matter, we can still kill him.

1653
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,430
Kill, kill, kill.

1654
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,230
Kill all of them.

1655
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,870
This was what my power was for.

1656
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:50,970
I'm coming back.

1657
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,310
I'll go back too.

1658
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,420
Oh, more meat.

1659
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,200
Give me all my meat, please.

1660
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,800
Give me all these deaths.

1661
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,360
Death to the wildlife.

1662
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,800
Might as well go extinct in this world.

1663
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,280
Yeah, if we're gonna go extinct, the wildlife too.

1664
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,080
Yeah, if we're gonna suffer, they all suffer.

1665
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,400
They all suffer.

1666
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,440
They all suffer.

1667
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,580
Do my dogs...

1668
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,500
Oh my god.

1669
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,800
Would you really?

1670
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:33,080
If you were so desperate for XP, would you kill your friend?

1671
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,030
Do my dogs give...

1672
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,570
Do my...

1673
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:37,790
Does Doki give XP?

1674
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,170
Does Doki give XP?

1675
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,210
Does he give XP?

1676
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,310
Does Doki give XP?

1677
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:46,390
Does he?

1678
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:58,510
Your laugh is getting more and more maniacal as you...

1679
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,470
No, I don't wanna waste a level.

1680
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,930
I don't wanna waste a level.

1681
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,170
I was gonna name one of them.

1682
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:11,070
I was gonna name one of them dad and then look him in the eye and ask, do you give XP?

1683
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:13,230
Do you give XP?

1684
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,490
That's kinda raw, man.

1685
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,030
Alright, I'm gonna...

1686
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:22,910
I'm gonna check the Lulu laugh.

1687
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,290
Do you give XP?

1688
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,170
Do you give XP?

1689
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,750
Do you?

1690
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:35,490
Okay, um...

1691
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,090
I need...

1692
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,930
I need to...

1693
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:43,310
You can take the burning and the me and stuff for the...

1694
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:45,390
I know, I've been taking it.

1695
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:46,390
Yeah, just take it.

1696
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,350
You can have it.

1697
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:48,870
I'm still...

1698
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,750
I'm not even at level 29 though.

1699
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:52,870
Uh...

1700
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,970
I know, it's painful.

1701
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,350
Can you pass me a book?

1702
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:58,970
Oh wait, no, never mind.

1703
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,270
There's more books here.

1704
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,310
I'm just gonna...

1705
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,270
I'm resetting.

1706
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,850
I need to reset one.

1707
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:04,970
Okay.

1708
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,690
Oh, I forgot to bring a lapis.

1709
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,430
Wait, you have all the lapis?

1710
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,630
Oh no, the lapis is here.

1711
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,490
No, there's lots of lapis in there.

1712
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:18,830
Time to go to the jungle.

1713
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:19,690
Time to go to the jungle.

1714
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,910
The rainy jungle.

1715
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,570
The rainy jungle.

1716
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:22,910
The rainy jungle.

1717
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:23,410
The rainy jungle.

1718
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:33,970
Blast?

1719
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,530
Why does it keep giving me...

1720
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,790
I'm just gonna get protection 2.

1721
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,710
I'm just...

1722
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,430
Guys, I'm just gonna get protection 2.

1723
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,670
Like, I...

1724
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:41,950
There's no...

1725
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,210
There's only blast protection.

1726
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,190
Guys, this is it.

1727
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,030
This is the best I can do.

1728
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:49,150
I can't...

1729
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,510
Protection 2 is 5.

1730
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:52,550
Protection 2...

1731
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,390
Protection 2...

1732
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,740
Don't piss me off.

1733
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,320
You look like you...

1734
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,540
are just enough EXP.

1735
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,280
Okay.

1736
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:14,960
Someone said that this song has gotten more and more sad as the time goes on.

1737
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,780
Okay.

1738
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:20,940
What are you playing?

1739
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,160
No, the lion sleeps at night.

1740
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,480
The more we sing that song, the sadder it becomes.

1741
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,520
I know, I was really excited about it.

1742
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,180
The lion sleeps at night.

1743
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,180
The lion...

1744
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,600
The lion...

1745
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,720
The lion...

1746
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:58,360
Why is there no coal?

1747
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,320
No chicken?

1748
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:02,320
Are you talking about for farming?

1749
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,340
I was gonna say...

1750
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,960
There's a lot of coal in the...

1751
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,060
What else do you need?

1752
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,640
My arm is fully ready.

1753
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,160
I still need my helmet and my pants.

1754
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,400
And then I was gonna get the infinity on the book.

1755
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,140
Oh, wait.

1756
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,000
What did you put on your bow then?

1757
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:23,540
No, I don't need it.

1758
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,360
You can have infinity.

1759
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,780
And then...

1760
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,880
My bow is ready with power.

1761
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,600
I already have power on my bow.

1762
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,780
You can put infinity on it too.

1763
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,540
No, it's fine.

1764
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,520
I don't need it.

1765
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,460
I actually don't need it.

1766
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,440
I have enough arrows.

1767
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,760
I have 45, so it's fine.

1768
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,560
I have 45.

1769
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,340
I have 45 normal arrows and then 20 spectral arrows.

1770
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,360
Uh, 20...

1771
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,780
20 plus...

1772
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,780
Yeah, but it's just arrows.

1773
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,280
That's fine.

1774
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,260
I don't need another infinity.

1775
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,440
I think we should just go with whatever.

1776
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,620
Try to level up all your stuff.

1777
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,980
And then...

1778
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,300
Like, all your armor, because I'm done, I think.

1779
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,260
I'm done.

1780
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,280
Sorry, kid.

1781
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,560
Sorry, you have no mom anymore.

1782
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:17,840
I'm so sorry.

1783
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,620
Guys, it's fine.

1784
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,520
Guys, believe.

1785
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,140
Believe.

1786
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,660
Believe in this.

1787
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,940
Guys, believe.

1788
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:26,480
Believe.

1789
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,500
I've done this before.

1790
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:30,960
Guys, believe.

1791
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,120
I've done this before.

1792
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,760
I think I once soloed the ender dragon.

1793
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,540
Yeah, I think you did, actually.

1794
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,180
I remember.

1795
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,120
I feel like I did that.

1796
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,680
But I had, like, way better stuff.

1797
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:44,920
That's true.

1798
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,920
Didn't you have netherite stuff?

1799
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,660
Oh, I also have to...

1800
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,040
Oh, shit.

1801
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,480
I'm gonna...

1802
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,560
Oh, God.

1803
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,720
I'm not...

1804
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,820
I'm kind of lost.

1805
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:53,760
Oh, no.

1806
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,660
The sun's coming down.

1807
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,120
Okay, coordinates are...

1808
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,960
I can't look at it yet, because I'm in bed.

1809
01:07:59,300 --> 01:07:59,820
Oh, I see it.

1810
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,240
Never mind.

1811
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:00,560
I'm coming.

1812
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:00,860
I'm coming.

1813
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,660
No, you got the infinity, right?

1814
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,800
You already got it on your own.

1815
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,660
No, I haven't put it on yet, but I will...

1816
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,840
Yeah.

1817
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,320
Okay, I'm...

1818
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,640
I'm coming to bed.

1819
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:16,820
I'm almost there.

1820
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,480
I lit up the area a little bit, so it should be, like, not so dangerous.

1821
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,900
I'm on my way.

1822
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,400
I'm sleeping.

1823
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,360
I'm eeping.

1824
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,300
My chat doesn't...

1825
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,740
My chat doesn't believe.

1826
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,360
They're like, yeah, you're cooked, but you might win.

1827
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,980
What the hell?

1828
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,480
This is our one run!

1829
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,780
This is literally our one run!

1830
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:46,880
Why don't you believe?

1831
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,880
Why don't you believe in us?

1832
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,480
We have one run!

1833
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,520
You have to believe in us.

1834
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,140
You have to believe in us.

1835
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,320
Please believe in us.

1836
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,940
We have no faith.

1837
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,740
We really need this win.

1838
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,160
Okay, I'm gonna put, like, trash stuff in my inventory that I don't need.

1839
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,480
Okay, I need the torch.

1840
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,440
I need this.

1841
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,080
I don't need the gold helmet anymore.

1842
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,040
I don't... I'm gonna grab wood just in case.

1843
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,360
I don't need... I'll grab this just in case too.

1844
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,180
And then get the bed.

1845
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,420
Get this out of here.

1846
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,900
Get the wood rid of this.

1847
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:25,660
We need coal.

1848
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,100
We don't need this.

1849
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,360
We don't need this.

1850
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,760
We have this.

1851
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,500
This is fine.

1852
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,600
We don't need this.

1853
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,120
We don't need this.

1854
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,260
Have you guys found the end portal?

1855
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,200
We're gonna do that the moment we finish kidding ourselves up!

1856
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,560
We're gonna get that into that soon.

1857
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,640
I'm gonna make them.

1858
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,340
I'm gonna make the end pearl things into the...

1859
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,600
Okay, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 beds.

1860
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,460
That's enough beds.

1861
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,800
Oh, you should make that.

1862
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,720
Actually, you're right.

1863
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... I have 7 beds.

1864
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:02,920
I have 7 beds.

1865
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,440
I don't think... I think you need, like, 20... Isn't that, like, a ton of beds, you guys?

1866
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,280
Oh my gosh.

1867
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,000
We have these two beds.

1868
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:11,540
8, 9.

1869
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,580
We have 9 beds.

1870
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:13,540
It's okay.

1871
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,340
We'll just do it with our...

1872
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,580
Do I need extra iron or no?

1873
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,240
Wait, I can make iron ingot nuggets.

1874
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:19,980
No, I don't have... Okay.

1875
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,340
I think I have enough for... Do I have enough for...

1876
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,600
Okay, 1.

1877
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:27,700
How many for buckets?

1878
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,440
We're already an hour in.

1879
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:31,900
I need 3.

1880
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,120
Okay, so...

1881
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,440
I need 2 more.

1882
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,980
I need...

1883
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,780
Wait.

1884
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,340
Oh no.

1885
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,880
I don't have enough.

1886
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,040
I only have one bucket.

1887
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,740
Do you have a bucket on you?

1888
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,300
Yeah, I have one bucket.

1889
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,300
Okay, we both have a bucket.

1890
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,060
So it should be fine.

1891
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,020
I think we need more.

1892
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,340
Don't we need to... Well...

1893
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,380
We need to, like, cover the ground with water.

1894
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,900
That's our one bucket for.

1895
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,000
That's not gonna cover the whole ground.

1896
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,040
We don't have enough iron.

1897
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,040
We don't...

1898
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,480
We actually don't have enough iron.

1899
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,460
Unless I swim.

1900
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,840
Time to find iron.

1901
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,360
Yeah, a 2x2 infinite water.

1902
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,240
Will that work?

1903
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,200
Wait, we need 4 buckets of water then, right?

1904
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,720
We need 4 buckets of water to make the 2x2.

1905
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,120
I just need 2?

1906
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:31,820
Oh, we both have 2.

1907
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,840
Yeah, we both have 2.

1908
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,720
We just need to make sure we don't fuck up the infinite water source.

1909
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,700
Alright, that's a fucking... We only have one!

1910
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,060
We only have one!

1911
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,360
One bucket?

1912
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,520
No, we have 2.

1913
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,100
I mean, we only have one chance for this.

1914
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:49,600
Yeah.

1915
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,840
And if we don't succeed, people are gonna see the two VODs and be like, oh, of course they made it.

1916
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,740
They're not gonna watch to the end, right?

1917
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,000
They're not gonna...

1918
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,580
We could just cut it and say that we had a streaming issue.

1919
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,200
But we didn't.

1920
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,820
Take a screenshot on Google.

1921
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,560
Yeah, yeah.

1922
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,020
We could photoshop our characters and that.

1923
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:19,040
We can hire someone on Fiverr to repeat it with our skins.

1924
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:23,440
Alright.

1925
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,840
We just put in the new video.

1926
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,020
Which is like, well, but we managed to record it.

1927
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:35,060
We managed to record the final...

1928
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,680
The final fight.

1929
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,280
Guys, and then we upload it as a video and then nobody will know.

1930
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,220
How would they know?

1931
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,140
How would they know?

1932
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,320
How would they know?

1933
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,400
So we need iron.

1934
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:54,680
I'm gonna go look for some more coal too so I can... I need to just get a little bit more level.

1935
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,380
How much more levels do you need?

1936
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,660
One, but I'm at 29.

1937
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,220
29.

1938
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,160
But like...

1939
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,340
At the lower end, 29?

1940
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,240
Did you grab everything for cooking?

1941
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,360
Yeah.

1942
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,140
Okay, I'm grabbing this copper then so I can cook it for you.

1943
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,600
You can just grab the stuff.

1944
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,580
Okay.

1945
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,000
I'm searching.

1946
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,340
Wait, so do you think I shouldn't get infinity then?

1947
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,700
No, you should get infinity.

1948
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,140
I think infinity is more important.

1949
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,140
Okay, I'll get infinity.

1950
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,120
So then I can give you the arrow and then you do the infinity stuff.

1951
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,820
Okay, I'll do infinity.

1952
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:37,500
And I'll just do like a second level for my...

1953
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,620
for my helmet and my pants.

1954
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,820
And then we can...

1955
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,420
We can head off into the...

1956
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:49,140
You know, if we lose this run and we do it again, I will not be surprised if it's easier.

1957
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:50,780
I wouldn't.

1958
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,140
I feel like...

1959
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,560
If we were in a new seed...

1960
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,940
If we were in the bad end of the stick and all that.

1961
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,140
I think we just got the worst seed possible.

1962
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,020
I think so too.

1963
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,320
Maybe we should just die right now and restart with a new seed.

1964
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,880
We're gonna die.

1965
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,940
At least die at the dragon.

1966
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,460
At that point, let's just go find the stronghold.

1967
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,140
In the little stronghold.

1968
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,380
Let's just find the stronghold at that point.

1969
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,520
Like, fuck getting anything else.

1970
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,180
Why is there nothing around here?

1971
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,220
This area is so...

1972
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:38,780
We bring the enchantment table and the books with us to the stronghold.

1973
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,120
And then we can get XP at the stronghold.

1974
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,440
Oh, true.

1975
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:45,140
Yeah.

1976
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,700
Okay, we can do that.

1977
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,860
Just grab everything that we're gonna bring to the...

1978
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:53,960
So are we picking up shop?

1979
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,580
We're packing up shop.

1980
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,120
This is it.

1981
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,540
This is the final hour.

1982
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:02,860
Wait, don't you need a silk touch to take out the...

1983
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,820
Take out what?

1984
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,220
The enchantment table.

1985
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:06,820
Wait, really?

1986
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,480
You need silk touch?

1987
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,960
Wait, if you break the enchantment table, you reset the enchantments?

1988
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,480
Yeah, lose infinity.

1989
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,440
Okay, let's just make a new enchantment table.

1990
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,160
I have enough diamonds.

1991
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,460
Alright, saying goodbye to...

1992
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,220
Wait, what do we need for enchantment tables?

1993
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,240
We need...

1994
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,920
We also need the bookshelf.

1995
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,620
Three obsidian... Yeah, bookshelves we can remake easily.

1996
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,260
Okay, we just get more book...

1997
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,580
I mean, more wood.

1998
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,440
Okay.

1999
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,280
I remember Kai's be taking...

2000
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,940
Oh, it was not five days.

2001
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,980
It was much longer than five days.

2002
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,000
I remember I remember watching that stream.

2003
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,320
I remember it taking much longer.

2004
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,780
Oh yeah, there's a library in the stronghold.

2005
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,640
Oh, I can mine it?

2006
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,540
People are saying I can break the enchantment table.

2007
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,160
You can?

2008
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,760
People said don't.

2009
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,750
You can mine it, but I don't have silk touch.

2010
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,510
Oh, I guess you can mine it.

2011
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,910
Oh, just maybe people are... Someone says don't.

2012
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,990
Others say don't.

2013
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,090
Some says yes.

2014
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:32,040
Get infinity first before... Wait, she doesn't have the levels.

2015
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,960
They're saying you can mine it, but oh yeah, when you get rid of it, I will get...

2016
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,800
Oh, you don't have your infinity.

2017
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2018
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,120
You're right.

2019
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:40,780
Okay, okay.

2020
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,500
What do we do?

2021
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,640
You need one level, right?

2022
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,040
Okay, I'll put stuff in the...

2023
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,620
How much more from that one level?

2024
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,700
I'm going back into the nether.

2025
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,220
No, don't do it.

2026
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,940
No, it's too... Don't do it.

2027
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,920
It's too risky.

2028
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,080
How much more do you need?

2029
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,520
I need a lot.

2030
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,800
You need a lot?

2031
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,220
A lot, a lot.

2032
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,640
How much is a lot, a lot?

2033
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,280
I think I need to go back and I'm going in.

2034
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:04,760
No!

2035
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,180
Wait, can you come...

2036
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:09,160
Wait, can you come with and build a wall, right?

2037
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,100
So that the gas spawns by the...

2038
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:16,280
I'll build a house around it, but like, in a sec, I need stuff.

2039
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:17,640
I'm gonna get dirt.

2040
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:18,380
I'm gonna get dirt.

2041
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,360
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2042
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,700
You can go in first and then out, like, because you'll be walking away from it, right?

2043
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,560
Did I put the shovel?

2044
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,960
Okay, I'm gonna go grab dirt and then build stuff around it.

2045
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,440
I think I see some quartz.

2046
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:32,760
Oh, shit.

2047
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,680
There's already a gas.

2048
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,320
Oh, there's already a gas.

2049
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,700
I'm grabbing dirt.

2050
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,340
I'm grabbing dirt as fast as I can.

2051
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,920
I'm grabbing dirt as fast as I can.

2052
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,040
I can't use the wood, guys.

2053
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,780
The wood is for something else I'm trying to make.

2054
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:49,020
The wood is for something else I'm trying to make right now.

2055
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,000
Okay.

2056
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:56,020
I'm digging, like, kind of a hole for me, so that...

2057
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,380
How much dirt did I get?

2058
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,460
Oh, my pickaxe just broke.

2059
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,920
Oh, no.

2060
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:04,920
Okay, I'm coming in.

2061
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,640
I'm giving you my pickaxe.

2062
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,340
Okay.

2063
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,100
Um, you can find me in a hole.

2064
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,420
Here, this way.

2065
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:14,380
Do you see me?

2066
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:15,760
Give me a sec.

2067
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,240
I'm building the house first.

2068
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,580
I think maybe he despawned.

2069
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,480
I don't hear him anymore.

2070
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:22,840
I don't hear him either.

2071
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,530
Can I have your pickaxe?

2072
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,410
Yeah, just give me a sec.

2073
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,730
I'm building our little house.

2074
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:38,010
Yep.

2075
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:38,530
Okay.

2076
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,650
That works, yeah.

2077
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:43,170
Thank you.

2078
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,290
Just for a moment.

2079
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,790
Alright, I'm grabbing more dirt.

2080
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,880
I'm just gonna sleep through this night, too.

2081
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,440
Oh, my god.

2082
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,820
I do hear still the gas.

2083
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:00,380
I hear it.

2084
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:00,620
I know.

2085
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,880
I'm grabbing more stuff for the house.

2086
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,260
I'm mining the dirt.

2087
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,540
I ran out of dirt.

2088
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,860
Okay, I'm almost halfway.

2089
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:14,830
Where is he?

2090
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,270
I'm just gonna get 40 and then go back in.

2091
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,950
Cobblestones.

2092
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,650
I can't get cobblestones.

2093
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,010
I don't have cobblestone.

2094
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,870
I don't have my pickaxe anymore.

2095
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:28,050
And we don't have iron.

2096
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,450
Oh, god.

2097
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:31,950
Where is he?

2098
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,370
Oh, there he is.

2099
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,020
Please despawn.

2100
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,400
Please despawn.

2101
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,180
You ugly...

2102
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,780
Please despawn!

2103
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,180
Okay, he might despawn now.

2104
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,320
He might despawn now.

2105
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:54,860
Oh, my god.

2106
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,840
I'm in my little hole.

2107
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,680
I'm in my little hole.

2108
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,780
I'm in my little hole.

2109
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,000
I'm in my hole.

2110
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,280
There was one more quartz area that I can think I can get to.

2111
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,600
Is he gone?

2112
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:11,960
No, he's not gone.

2113
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,160
I don't know.

2114
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,580
Just stay in your little hole.

2115
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,760
Just stay in your little hole.

2116
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:19,360
You know what?

2117
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,260
I'm just gonna mine.

2118
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,100
I'm just gonna strip mine here.

2119
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,820
And then maybe I'll hit quartz safely.

2120
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:29,780
Perhaps.

2121
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,260
I'm gonna mine some more dirt for us.

2122
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,460
Oh, my god.

2123
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:39,390
I just gotta get a few...

2124
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:43,710
I just gotta get a few more experience, guys.

2125
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,930
It's just almost there.

2126
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:47,630
Did you get quartz?

2127
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:48,930
Don't burn!

2128
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,010
I'm trying not to.

2129
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:52,050
Very nice.

2130
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:52,110
Nice.

2131
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:00,970
Alright, I'm going to the portal and see if he's there.

2132
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:02,770
I think he is.

2133
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:04,350
Don't say that.

2134
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,500
I'm being as safe as I possibly can.

2135
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,000
Oh!

2136
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,380
So close to 30?

2137
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,120
So close?

2138
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,130
Oh, my god.

2139
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,430
I'm so close to level 30.

2140
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:24,330
There you go.

2141
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,190
I feel a little bit more safe now.

2142
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:27,990
Oh, more quartz.

2143
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:28,830
Okay.

2144
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:29,870
There we go.

2145
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,290
There we go.

2146
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,830
We're a little safer now.

2147
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,070
I made...

2148
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:36,670
I made a little hut.

2149
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,390
I got to level 30.

2150
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:39,530
I made a little hut.

2151
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,430
I can do infinity now.

2152
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:44,390
Yeah!

2153
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:48,330
I'm gonna put torches for you so you know this is where we live.

2154
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,350
Okay.

2155
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,050
I think I know, but...

2156
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:53,070
Alright, here you go.

2157
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:53,390
Okay.

2158
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,210
There's all the torches.

2159
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:57,670
There's all the torches in the world!

2160
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:00,610
I wish I was farming quartz.

2161
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,050
Rich in quartz.

2162
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,910
I wish we...

2163
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:05,450
I wish we died earlier.

2164
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:06,770
I don't know.

2165
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:08,950
I wish we...

2166
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,150
I wish we didn't stayed in this seed.

2167
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:12,210
I know.

2168
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:12,710
Me too.

2169
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:17,250
I wish we died in the very beginning of the nether.

2170
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:18,110
Me too!

2171
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,780
It would be so long from now.

2172
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:24,800
Okay, I'm back.

2173
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,060
Oh, where's your pickaxe?

2174
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,320
You know what I also wish?

2175
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,120
I wish we got out of the mines earlier.

2176
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,550
I wish we got...

2177
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,680
Do you regret what you did in the mines?

2178
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:40,420
Do you regret what you did in the mines?

2179
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,580
I regret this entire event.

2180
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,840
I regret everything.

2181
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,760
Wait, why can't I do infinity?

2182
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,880
Oh, three lapis.

2183
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,500
Oh, that's why.

2184
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:53,860
Okay.

2185
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,720
Okay, I got infinity.

2186
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,120
Alright, time to break.

2187
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,100
I'll break it now.

2188
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,220
I'm breaking it.

2189
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:03,820
Okay.

2190
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:09,720
I got the enchanting table and then I'm gonna grab the bookcases too.

2191
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:13,840
Okay.

2192
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:17,940
Name it.

2193
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,100
No, my levels are precious.

2194
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,280
I'm not gonna waste a single level on a name.

2195
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,280
His name is Bo.

2196
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,800
I'm gonna remake the bookshelf.

2197
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:29,740
I think...

2198
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:33,960
I really think, Doki, this bow would be better with you since it's a powerful bow.

2199
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,800
Mine has power 4.

2200
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,080
And mine has unbreaking 3 also.

2201
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,640
Only unbreaking 3?

2202
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,680
What's yours unbreaking?

2203
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,100
Mine has power 4.

2204
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,300
Mine has power 4, unbreaking 3 and infinity.

2205
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,300
Oh, okay.

2206
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:56,660
Okay, there you go.

2207
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,200
There you go.

2208
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,540
I didn't realize you have all those.

2209
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,280
One and done?

2210
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,360
Oh my god.

2211
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,780
This is embarrassing.

2212
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,140
I don't want this thing.

2213
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,060
What the hell?

2214
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,800
Why is it embarrassing?

2215
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,420
Here's your fucking arrows.

2216
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,400
Oh, thank you.

2217
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,100
You have arrows?

2218
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,980
Yeah, I have one arrow.

2219
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,340
Do you want spectral arrows too?

2220
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,480
No, no, it's okay.

2221
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,700
Why is it...

2222
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,000
No, we can't combine the bows, guys.

2223
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,680
Because Smit needs the bows too.

2224
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,760
She needs the bows as well.

2225
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,340
She needs...

2226
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,300
I need the bows.

2227
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,960
She's telling us to combine the bows.

2228
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,140
What's the big use?

2229
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,640
They're trying to sabotage us.

2230
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,730
Alright, did you make the eye of ender?

2231
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,010
Yeah.

2232
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:11,220
Don't do the bed strap, because it's not good and only for speedrunners.

2233
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,060
I've done the bed strap before.

2234
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,040
You have?

2235
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,940
Yeah, we've done it together in that room we had.

2236
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,680
I didn't do it.

2237
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,200
I don't think.

2238
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,740
No, I didn't do it.

2239
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,660
Didn't we do it?

2240
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,660
I thought I did.

2241
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,240
No, I don't think so.

2242
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,020
Pretty sure.

2243
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:38,270
It could kill us.

2244
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:39,390
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling.

2245
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,250
Okay, I'll get rid of the beds.

2246
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:41,870
Fine.

2247
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:44,450
I'll get rid of them.

2248
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:47,590
Oh, you guys are scared.

2249
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,970
You guys, I gave away my infinity bow.

2250
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,590
That's why I have all the arrows.

2251
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,390
I gave...

2252
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,450
Oh, man.

2253
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,370
I think some people are more tired than me.

2254
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:59,530
Alright, I'm gonna...

2255
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,450
Alright, let me... I'm just making...

2256
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:05,670
Okay, bookshelf.

2257
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,370
I'm just remaking the shelves for us.

2258
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:12,910
Not enough wood?

2259
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:13,790
Do you have wood or no?

2260
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,250
Not a lot of wood.

2261
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:19,210
Okay, I'll just farm the last trees here.

2262
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,670
And then we'll head over.

2263
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,810
We'll head over.

2264
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:24,890
Mint, please.

2265
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:25,950
It's 440.

2266
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:28,510
It's 540 for me.

2267
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:33,710
Sun's almost up, guys.

2268
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:36,530
Yeah.

2269
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:39,070
Alright.

2270
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:40,870
Let's see.

2271
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,530
Wood.

2272
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,430
I can't do much more.

2273
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:48,550
That's why we have the last row.

2274
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,090
I'm almost done, but I love it.

2275
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,310
Me too.

2276
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,150
Me too.

2277
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,890
I thought we'd be at the dragon by now.

2278
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:58,650
I don't know why we're still here.

2279
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,050
Okay, then let's go.

2280
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,250
I didn't realize...

2281
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,490
I didn't realize how underleveled we were.

2282
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:06,510
I thought we leveled up.

2283
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:09,870
I told you, I told you.

2284
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:11,750
You had the same amount of...

2285
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:15,970
I know, but I told you we needed so so many.

2286
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:19,790
There were so many quartz that we didn't pick up.

2287
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:20,910
We didn't...

2288
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,310
Don't forget the potion.

2289
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,890
Why didn't the chat tell us to pick up the quartz?

2290
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:36,270
Yeah, why didn't the chat tell us?

2291
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:39,130
Why didn't the chat tell us to pick up the quartz?

2292
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:44,570
You guys should have been saying, Hey, you need more levels.

2293
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,230
Get the quartz.

2294
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,090
Yeah, get more of the quartz.

2295
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:49,590
Get more of the quartz.

2296
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:51,190
Get more of them.

2297
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:52,790
You should have said get more of the quartz.

2298
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:55,430
Yeah, you should have said get more of the quartz.

2299
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:58,130
If you said get more of the quartz, I would have got more of the quartz.

2300
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:00,510
Now they're blaming us.

2301
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,150
We need the quartz for the...

2302
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:04,830
We need the quartz for that.

2303
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,670
Chat, why didn't you get those?

2304
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:08,170
I didn't know.

2305
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:08,910
Hey, chat.

2306
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:10,810
Yeah, chat.

2307
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:15,670
Why didn't you tell us about the quartz, chat?

2308
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,350
Do you think my sword will last, you guys?

2309
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:19,770
I think mine will.

2310
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,450
Okay, what potions did I get?

2311
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:25,410
Potion of regeneration.

2312
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,210
You made so many.

2313
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:28,190
Yeah.

2314
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:31,450
You don't get all of them.

2315
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:32,630
Half and half.

2316
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:35,610
You said half.

2317
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,070
That's not half.

2318
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,770
I got 2, 4, 5 for regen.

2319
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:43,050
And 2, 4, 4 for slow falling.

2320
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:45,230
Yeah.

2321
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,030
It's half.

2322
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:46,870
It's literally half.

2323
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:48,150
What the fuck are you talking about?

2324
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,570
You have 5 for both.

2325
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:52,590
And I have 4.

2326
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,330
I have 2, 4, 5 for regen.

2327
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:58,270
And then 2, 4 for slow falling.

2328
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:01,270
Okay, so you're giving me slow...

2329
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:01,790
Okay, I get it.

2330
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,370
Should we just...

2331
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:05,410
Should I make more?

2332
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:07,090
No, I think we're fine.

2333
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,410
It's not gonna take us that long.

2334
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,490
It's 4 minutes each.

2335
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,290
We're not gonna take 30 minutes to kill this dragon.

2336
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:16,470
We either die within 10 minutes...

2337
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:17,930
or we do something in 10 minutes.

2338
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,890
It's one or the other.

2339
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:22,790
We die in 10 minutes.

2340
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:25,530
Okay, we gotta sleep in the bed before we fucking...

2341
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,870
Yeah, we gotta sleep in the bed.

2342
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:29,210
Netherrack, he'll like...

2343
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:30,470
He'll blow it up, right?

2344
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:32,110
What?

2345
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:36,550
Someone just said...

2346
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:38,270
This message got delayed.

2347
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:39,550
Pick up the quartz.

2348
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:47,170
Why didn't we pick up the quartz?

2349
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,850
We were trapped in the nether for 4 hours.

2350
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,890
Imagine how fucked up we would be.

2351
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,690
We would have been like level 7.

2352
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,710
We would have been like level 70.

2353
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:01,870
I can't believe we didn't pick it up.

2354
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,470
I'm gonna grab the lapis.

2355
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:04,490
I got some lapis.

2356
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,690
I'm gonna grab netherrack for like when we...

2357
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,530
When we need to climb.

2358
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:12,770
Did you grab the ender pearl and eye of ender stuff?

2359
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:14,450
Yeah, I have all that.

2360
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:15,990
I'm gonna grab your potions.

2361
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:17,710
Yeah, I know.

2362
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,770
I'm making space.

2363
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:22,790
I'm making space.

2364
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,740
I'm gonna bring the brewing stand just in case.

2365
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:33,860
Oh, pickaxe?

2366
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,460
Yeah, I need that.

2367
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,720
You have a lot of wood, right?

2368
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:36,780
I have 40.

2369
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:41,640
We can grab some while we're fucking heading over to the stronghold wherever it is.

2370
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,400
Okay, that's it.

2371
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,380
We're just gonna be so many trees.

2372
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,680
Okay, I'll get rid of that and that.

2373
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,840
Hold on guys, sorry.

2374
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,840
I'm putting stuff away.

2375
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,160
I'm making stuff.

2376
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:54,720
Let's see.

2377
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,940
Oh wait, I'll take my sticks.

2378
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:59,620
I'll grab blocks while we're on the way, chat.

2379
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,680
There's so many blocks ahead of us.

2380
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:04,280
We can grab blocks while we're going there.

2381
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,700
There we go, I got water.

2382
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,240
Oh, you got all the food?

2383
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,360
We gotta get the food.

2384
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,420
I got 44.

2385
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:15,900
I think you have the chicken, right?

2386
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,500
I got the beefs and the chickens.

2387
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,220
I had pork chop and mutton.

2388
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,680
So we can split that.

2389
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,340
You take those, I take the others.

2390
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:25,300
Take the beds.

2391
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,140
There's so much they can do to prepare.

2392
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,840
There's so little time left in our bodies.

2393
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,220
Our bodies are gonna expire soon.

2394
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,180
We don't have...

2395
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:37,540
We don't have the time to prep more.

2396
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,920
I'm taking the melons until the fight.

2397
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:45,720
This is the two different types of tiredness from Min and I.

2398
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,680
Min is the...

2399
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,240
I'm gonna fucking pass out.

2400
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:52,120
I am hysterical and I'm delusional right now.

2401
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,740
I'm a type of tired.

2402
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,720
I'm the Lulu at the moment.

2403
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,780
Two types of tiredness from us.

2404
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:02,520
We don't need the ender chest.

2405
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,840
We don't need it.

2406
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,900
They're telling us we need an ender chest?

2407
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,140
It's for more room, but we don't.

2408
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,480
We don't need it.

2409
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,080
We're fine.

2410
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:14,400
We do need...

2411
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,940
I have one other shield.

2412
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,520
I actually have two shields.

2413
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,400
Maybe I'll be okay.

2414
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,460
Um, I do...

2415
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:22,520
Can I put something in my little bundle?

2416
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,320
Can I put...

2417
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,660
Oh, what the hell?

2418
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,620
Oh, I can put the food in the bundle.

2419
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,300
Oh, that's smart.

2420
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Oh, it's full.

2421
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,100
This thing sucks.

2422
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,120
Maybe we should have made an ender chest.

2423
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,960
Do we have enough ender pearls for an ender chest, though?

2424
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:39,800
That's the thing.

2425
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,820
No, we need to save all eyes of ender.

2426
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,220
Yeah, okay.

2427
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,700
Okay, I'm ready.

2428
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,800
I'm missing one slow-falling...

2429
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,220
You know what?

2430
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:51,460
Fine.

2431
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:52,120
Go away, stick.

2432
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,700
Actually, I'm gonna make...

2433
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:54,920
Wait.

2434
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,580
Even if I make a pickaxe, I can't take it.

2435
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,240
We need these pearls, you guys.

2436
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,640
We need these for...

2437
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,180
We need them.

2438
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:10,360
We'll make the chest when...

2439
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,200
I mean, it wouldn't matter by then when we're there.

2440
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,920
When we fight.

2441
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,680
How do I take stuff out?

2442
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:19,140
Oh, no.

2443
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:19,860
Only one.

2444
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,140
Nope.

2445
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:33,390
No, I'm taking the...

2446
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:36,810
You guys, we're remaking the enchantment table.

2447
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,730
So when we...

2448
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:38,930
Yeah, I have everything.

2449
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:41,350
I have the enchantment table and I have 15 bookshelves.

2450
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:43,330
And I have lapis lazuli.

2451
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:46,430
Actually, I'll get books there.

2452
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:47,530
Oh, that's true.

2453
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:49,230
I already made 15.

2454
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:49,910
It's fine.

2455
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:52,710
It's in my pocket.

2456
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:53,610
It's fine.

2457
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,870
I feel like we just find...

2458
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:58,910
Straight up find the fucking thing.

2459
01:33:59,030 --> 01:34:00,870
And then put the pearls in there.

2460
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:02,530
And then we call it.

2461
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:03,630
And then we go in there.

2462
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:05,450
We either kill the dragon or we die.

2463
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:08,130
And then we try this again in another day.

2464
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,710
Why do people keep saying the pearls?

2465
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:10,750
I'm so confused.

2466
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:12,210
I have all the pearls.

2467
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,270
This is all the pearls.

2468
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:16,950
How many more pearls do we need?

2469
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:19,610
Oh, wait, there's so many more in here.

2470
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:20,730
I didn't even notice them.

2471
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:21,390
Wait, hold on.

2472
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:22,790
The ones that I gave?

2473
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,030
Yeah, those are the ones I put down there.

2474
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,610
Oh, I didn't even see.

2475
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,230
Okay, hold on.

2476
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:28,750
I need to make way more things.

2477
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:29,230
Hold on.

2478
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:29,630
Okay.

2479
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,170
Oh, my God.

2480
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,490
I didn't even see these.

2481
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:34,810
I put them in the beginning.

2482
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:35,670
I told you.

2483
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,190
I didn't see them.

2484
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:37,570
It's alright.

2485
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,550
We've lost our minds.

2486
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:41,030
And those people who are like, you gotta spend more time.

2487
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:42,130
No, we've...

2488
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,210
We've spent enough.

2489
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:44,710
We've...

2490
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:47,710
We've spent enough, guys.

2491
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:50,370
Oh, I didn't know there was more.

2492
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:51,010
If we...

2493
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:54,510
If we don't make it this run, we'll try again another time.

2494
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:56,690
We'll do the stream earlier.

2495
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:57,730
I'm not gonna bring the brewing.

2496
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,710
We'll do the stream in the morning instead.

2497
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:02,330
I think if we didn't...

2498
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,730
No, I'm not...

2499
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:04,570
No, I'm not...

2500
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:06,450
No, I'm not meant tomorrow.

2501
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:07,410
I'm not meant...

2502
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,150
I meant like another time.

2503
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:10,750
In the future.

2504
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:13,530
We'll try again.

2505
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:16,190
We'll try again in the future.

2506
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:16,990
Alright.

2507
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:22,130
I need to make a pickaxe now.

2508
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:23,210
Oh, I can't.

2509
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,810
I'm gonna make a diamond one.

2510
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,130
You have enough?

2511
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:29,630
Yeah, I think so.

2512
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:30,750
Where'd my sticks go?

2513
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,030
I have my sticks.

2514
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:34,130
No, guys, we cannot...

2515
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:36,190
We're not gonna do it in Atlanta.

2516
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:37,970
Guys, we're...

2517
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,090
We have other things to do.

2518
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:47,390
They're like, hey, how about you, like, do a whole concert and then also stream for 24 hours?

2519
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:49,010
That'd be like super cool.

2520
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,110
It'll be so fun.

2521
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:53,330
Oh my god.

2522
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:59,790
Like, no, but you have experience now with this.

2523
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,370
It won't be that bad.

2524
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,870
Oh my god.

2525
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:05,390
That's the funniest thing ever.

2526
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:09,810
We learned so much from this one playthrough.

2527
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:12,090
Are you not bringing the bed?

2528
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:15,450
No, they keep telling us that we're gonna die.

2529
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:17,330
Then it's fine.

2530
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:17,990
We don't need the bed.

2531
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:20,610
You might need the bed to head over there, maybe.

2532
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:21,970
Yeah, bring a bed to sleep.

2533
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:24,790
Alright, I'm throwing away my one iron.

2534
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:25,870
Alright, I'm ready.

2535
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:31,170
Throw it up into the air and say I don't care.

2536
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:32,730
I don't care.

2537
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:35,310
I'm throwing the eye of ender in the air.

2538
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:37,870
I'm going up in the air, I'm going up, I'm going up high.

2539
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:38,810
I'm throwing it in the air.

2540
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:41,550
Tell the world we don't care.

2541
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:44,070
Are you gonna say bye to your dads or whatever?

2542
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:45,870
What?

2543
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:47,470
Oh, oh shit.

2544
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:48,630
My dogs, get over here.

2545
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,610
I almost forgot you guys existed.

2546
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:53,770
I fucking thought you guys died because I was XP crazy.

2547
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:54,670
Okay.

2548
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:56,410
Throw it in the air.

2549
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:58,290
Wait, do I just throw it or do I...

2550
01:36:58,290 --> 01:36:59,150
How do I do this?

2551
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:01,030
Because sometimes it doesn't break.

2552
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:04,250
You throw it in the air.

2553
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:09,790
Throw it in the air and tell the world you don't care.

2554
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,590
Oh, this way.

2555
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:15,330
Alright, let's go.

2556
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:16,030
Oh, it didn't break.

2557
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:16,670
Grab it.

2558
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:18,010
Well, I don't have space.

2559
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:19,010
You gotta grab it.

2560
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,210
Okay, I'll grab it.

2561
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:24,770
Alright.

2562
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:25,610
Alright.

2563
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:26,550
Let's go.

2564
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:30,290
Let's go.

2565
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,310
Okay, we're going.

2566
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,790
Yup, let's go.

2567
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:34,970
I guess.

2568
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:35,650
Let's go.

2569
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:39,630
I roll to here and then you throw it in the air.

2570
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:41,610
Oh, that's it.

2571
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,250
Oh, okay.

2572
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:45,690
Goodbye, peepee tower.

2573
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:47,410
Goodbye.

2574
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:49,750
Do you really need to be up top while you throw it?

2575
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:50,650
Can you just throw it here?

2576
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:54,890
No, it's better to throw it up in a high place.

2577
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:56,510
Throw it in the air.

2578
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:00,230
And tell the world you don't care.

2579
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:03,010
Where are you?

2580
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:04,350
I'm here.

2581
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:06,930
Someone says go longer.

2582
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:07,590
Oh, I see.

2583
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,010
Okay.

2584
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,550
Alright, we'll go longer after this one.

2585
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:10,850
No!

2586
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:12,810
Oh, it's this way.

2587
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:15,090
Well, thank god I didn't go longer.

2588
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,370
Oh, it's in the tree.

2589
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:20,310
Goddammit.

2590
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:22,710
Is it this way?

2591
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:24,970
Right here?

2592
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:26,570
Gotta get out of the tree.

2593
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:28,330
Yeah, it's like a diagonal.

2594
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,310
It's like this way.

2595
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:31,250
That's a new dog.

2596
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:34,250
I told you there were dogs over here.

2597
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:35,190
Come on, come on.

2598
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,250
Don't get distracted.

2599
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:37,410
I'm going.

2600
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,650
I'm fucking...

2601
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:39,630
I'm heading over.

2602
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:41,970
We're going.

2603
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:48,230
They actually passed over the stronghold on the way back from the long nether trip.

2604
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,410
How would we know that?

2605
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,550
How would we know that?

2606
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,870
How would we know that?

2607
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:55,790
How would we know that?

2608
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:58,330
How do you know that?

2609
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:00,370
Why did no one said anything?

2610
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:04,670
Why did no one super daka super this and be like, that's the stronghold!

2611
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:10,210
I feel like we get $100 if we pass by the stronghold.

2612
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:12,410
I feel...

2613
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:14,270
Seed checker?

2614
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:15,490
They don't know the seed?

2615
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:17,390
Hey, where are you?

2616
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,510
They don't know the seed!

2617
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:20,570
I never showed the seed!

2618
01:39:21,130 --> 01:39:21,770
Where did you go?

2619
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:23,990
I'm walking in the...

2620
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,970
Come on.

2621
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:30,790
I thought I was walking the right direction.

2622
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:31,890
Wait, give me a sec.

2623
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:33,810
Stay where you are.

2624
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:34,830
Give me your coordinates.

2625
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:35,990
Stay where you are.

2626
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,210
I'm making a tower.

2627
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:42,270
I went in the other direction.

2628
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:45,210
We went back towards home!

2629
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:48,030
We already went and said goodbye.

2630
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:48,970
It's so awkward.

2631
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:49,470
I'm sorry.

2632
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:51,290
Give me your coordinates.

2633
01:39:54,730 --> 01:40:01,890
Apparently while I had my coordinates I passed by the stronghold because of the bio.

2634
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:03,210
What's your coordinates?

2635
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,670
They saw the bio!

2636
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,430
Why did you get this?

2637
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:14,250
Negative 421 1899 421 What?

2638
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:16,510
Just sleep.

2639
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,380
You didn't ask!

2640
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:25,120
Oh my god.

2641
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,180
This is the most Metal Gear ass.

2642
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,700
Thank you.

2643
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,860
Thank you, Plissken.

2644
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:34,500
Snake Plissken.

2645
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,540
What's your number again?

2646
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:52,720
422 421 918 97 1897 This is where I fucked up.

2647
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,080
Don't say what a thrill!

2648
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:55,580
That's the wrong game!

2649
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,620
I see you.

2650
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:03,660
Keep going straight.

2651
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,620
I'm here now.

2652
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:06,900
You see me?

2653
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,140
I went the wrong way.

2654
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:14,380
I thought I saw the right way but I didn't see the right way.

2655
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:17,140
I'm watching out for the hole now.

2656
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,300
I'm eating my bread.

2657
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,840
Wait, so then...

2658
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,520
Chat, for people who noticed and just decided not to say anything.

2659
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:27,020
How far away was it?

2660
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,400
This is far.

2661
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,440
At what point was it there?

2662
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,980
We traveled 10,000 plus.

2663
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:37,980
I'm already hungry.

2664
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,000
I have lots of bread.

2665
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,680
I left my...

2666
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,060
Oh no, my watermelons are in the bundle.

2667
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:45,820
Wait, hold on.

2668
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:49,220
How do I get the watermelons out?

2669
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,600
I'm trying to eat the watermelon.

2670
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:59,980
After you're done with the watermelon I have bread, which might be more...

2671
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,380
Someone just said no help.

2672
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,680
This is ridiculous.

2673
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:07,260
We've been through so much.

2674
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:09,880
At this point, don't you feel anything for us?

2675
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:13,040
Don't you feel compassion at that point?

2676
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,460
Or any sense of human decency?

2677
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,660
I can't believe...

2678
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,480
Should I throw one here?

2679
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,340
No help.

2680
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,820
Chat's like...

2681
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:30,980
No help.

2682
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:35,060
It's the most...

2683
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:39,960
It's the one thing I've always wanted to ban from my chat.

2684
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:42,040
It's the fucking no help.

2685
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:44,840
It makes me want to pull out my hair.

2686
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,280
Do you want me to become bald?

2687
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,000
I will become bald.

2688
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,040
They'll enjoy it.

2689
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,720
No, don't encourage it.

2690
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,640
They'll just enjoy it so much.

2691
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,060
I'm bald now.

2692
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,080
I never said no.

2693
01:42:59,180 --> 01:42:59,860
Don't backseat.

2694
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:04,980
I am one of the few VTubers out there that embraces backseating.

2695
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:08,260
I will not progress if I don't get backseated.

2696
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:09,960
You can't say that about me.

2697
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,340
I am all about backseating.

2698
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,160
Someone just super chat me.

2699
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,960
They said every Minecraft world has 128 strongholds.

2700
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:22,260
You might find a closer one.

2701
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:22,820
Okay.

2702
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:23,660
Okay.

2703
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,680
Thank you for the hope.

2704
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,820
That's some real hope.

2705
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,020
That's a helper.

2706
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,400
That's a good helper.

2707
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,060
Santa's little helper.

2708
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,000
Thank you, little helper.

2709
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,000
Thank you, Daven.

2710
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,300
It's the same direction.

2711
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,300
We just gotta keep going.

2712
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:44,740
Okay.

2713
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:47,660
Here we go.

2714
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:49,580
Help.

2715
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:50,960
Help.

2716
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:51,680
Help.

2717
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,600
I'll wait for you.

2718
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,460
I'm right behind you.

2719
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:58,000
I do have to pee though.

2720
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:58,480
Alright.

2721
01:43:59,500 --> 01:43:59,940
Help.

2722
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,960
Let me know when we should do the eye.

2723
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,020
I'm gonna...

2724
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:06,120
Do you have blocks?

2725
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:06,900
I don't have any.

2726
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,220
Oh my god.

2727
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,200
Your dogs are pushing me.

2728
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:09,220
Or you're pushing me.

2729
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,680
I'm behind.

2730
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:11,320
Do you have blocks?

2731
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:12,240
I didn't bring blocks.

2732
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:13,720
I do.

2733
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,100
I'll just use some dirt.

2734
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:19,640
Oh wait.

2735
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,720
I don't have any room.

2736
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:22,760
Um...

2737
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,220
I have to get rid of cobblers.

2738
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,920
You can just re-mine it after.

2739
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,420
Just re-mine it here.

2740
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:32,260
They'll fall.

2741
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:33,700
I don't care.

2742
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,800
Then what's the point of re-mining it?

2743
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,120
They have no names.

2744
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:40,720
Get your blocks.

2745
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,900
No, I'm not talking about the dogs will fall.

2746
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,840
I'm talking about the blocks will fall.

2747
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,000
Get the blocks.

2748
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:48,920
I can't.

2749
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:49,780
Do you have a boat?

2750
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:50,940
Yeah.

2751
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:52,980
Yes, help.

2752
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,380
Oh, wait.

2753
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,060
I didn't mean to.

2754
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,840
Get off the boat and I can get on it.

2755
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,160
And then you can go with the eye of Ender out there.

2756
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:05,000
And then the world will be a beautiful place.

2757
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:07,000
What if I just...

2758
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,020
kept going?

2759
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:09,460
Alright.

2760
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:13,020
Just keep going.

2761
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:16,900
What if I just kept going?

2762
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:20,580
Alright.

2763
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:23,160
I think we can go to that area and then throw the eye, right?

2764
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:23,940
Would that be fine?

2765
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,780
Should we just keep going?

2766
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:28,820
I don't know how many we have to do before we throw the eye in the air.

2767
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:30,660
I don't know either.

2768
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:32,220
You've done this before.

2769
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,000
You've done this so many times.

2770
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,800
I've done this two times.

2771
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,360
That's two more than me.

2772
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:38,760
That's...

2773
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,900
Give me some...

2774
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,920
Give me a little bit of a credit.

2775
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,500
That's only two times.

2776
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,840
That's two more than me.

2777
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:48,540
That doesn't matter.

2778
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,940
That's what I'm saying.

2779
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,900
Okay, are you ready to throw it up?

2780
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,880
In the water?

2781
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:56,840
Just throw it up.

2782
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,360
To our left.

2783
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:00,640
Okay.

2784
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:01,560
To our left.

2785
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,060
I'm going to the left.

2786
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:05,960
To the left.

2787
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:11,640
All my brain cells in a box to the left.

2788
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,400
To the left.

2789
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,340
To the left.

2790
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,640
I think I might know y'all.

2791
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:16,620
Yeah.

2792
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,620
Three steps next time.

2793
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,440
This is not...

2794
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,300
My dog came over.

2795
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,100
I'm sorry.

2796
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:22,980
I'm sorry.

2797
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:23,440
I know.

2798
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,540
I know.

2799
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,860
I know you're like, why are you still here?

2800
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:27,800
I know.

2801
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,000
I know.

2802
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:30,420
Where is he?

2803
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:34,200
He's like underneath my...

2804
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:34,900
Oh my gosh.

2805
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,000
No, not the...

2806
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:36,700
Why did you do that?

2807
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:40,340
Oh, your actual dog.

2808
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:42,340
Yeah, my actual...

2809
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:43,960
Okay.

2810
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,800
Where does the eye of Ender tell you?

2811
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,700
What does the eyes say?

2812
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,020
Where's your Minecraft dogs?

2813
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:49,560
Where are they?

2814
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,380
I don't... It's fine.

2815
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:53,540
It's fine.

2816
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:55,280
Eye of Ender.

2817
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,020
Tell us where you are.

2818
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,280
That way.

2819
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:00,580
Oh, it's alive.

2820
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:01,420
Oh, it hasn't broken.

2821
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,040
Nice.

2822
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,300
Has it been... Has this been the same one?

2823
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,200
Yeah.

2824
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,600
This entire time?

2825
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,180
Wait, where'd it go?

2826
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,640
Where'd it go?

2827
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,560
Why don't these things fucking flow, man?

2828
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,280
Where'd it go?

2829
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:16,920
I see it.

2830
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:17,480
It's on me.

2831
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:17,960
It's on me.

2832
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,880
I got it.

2833
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:19,380
I got it.

2834
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,240
I got it.

2835
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:20,700
Okay.

2836
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,620
It's fine.

2837
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:23,440
I got it.

2838
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:25,520
This way, right?

2839
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:26,900
Yeah.

2840
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,100
Am I going the right way?

2841
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:28,760
I already forgot.

2842
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:32,120
Am I going the right way?

2843
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:33,160
Yeah, you're going the right way.

2844
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,460
Tell if you're joking or not.

2845
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,040
I can't.

2846
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,200
No, I actually don't know.

2847
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,320
I actually... No, no.

2848
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:42,540
I'm talking about someone in chat.

2849
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,120
Okay, okay.

2850
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,440
I'm throwing the Eye of...

2851
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,260
Eye to you.

2852
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:45,920
Right here.

2853
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:46,520
Oh, okay.

2854
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,400
I'll throw it right here.

2855
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:49,100
Oh, oh.

2856
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:49,820
I'm still in the boat.

2857
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:50,580
Yeah, yeah.

2858
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,320
I'm breaking the boat because I only have one...

2859
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:52,640
Oh, I got it.

2860
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:53,240
I got it.

2861
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:54,700
Up we go.

2862
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:55,940
Up we go.

2863
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:57,740
Up we go.

2864
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:01,780
Guys, you should buy the concert tickets, guys.

2865
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,640
It's just the same fun experience.

2866
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:07,560
What if we did this at the concert?

2867
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,800
What if we did this, guys?

2868
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,060
If you buy our tickets, we'll do this at the concert.

2869
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,980
We're just gonna watch...

2870
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,400
You can watch us play Minecraft.

2871
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:16,380
We're just playing Minecraft in 3D.

2872
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:18,680
In 3D.

2873
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:22,040
Buy the tickets and watch us play.

2874
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,060
Watch us play in 3D.

2875
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,740
Watch it, but only if...

2876
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:27,720
If only if the concert sells out.

2877
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:28,820
Where'd you go?

2878
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,480
I'm over here.

2879
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:31,960
Alright.

2880
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:35,040
Only the tickets sold out, then we'll do it.

2881
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:38,160
It'll be the longest concert ever.

2882
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:40,380
And then...

2883
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:40,900
We'll get a world record.

2884
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,360
If the venue kicks us out, we're gonna...

2885
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,140
We're gonna take us to another venue.

2886
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,700
And we're gonna keep doing it.

2887
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:48,940
We're gonna...

2888
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:51,260
We're just gonna keep going.

2889
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,080
Until we...

2890
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,520
Only if the concert sells out, though.

2891
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,300
We won't do it.

2892
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:00,500
Every single ticket has to be gone.

2893
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:04,420
If you want us to play Minecraft in 3D...

2894
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,660
For 24 hours straight.

2895
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,180
No, don't say that.

2896
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,960
Don't say that.

2897
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:12,580
Well, is that not gonna be when we do the challenge?

2898
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,080
We're gonna do the challenge all over again.

2899
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,580
Do you really think this is gonna take us 24 hours?

2900
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:17,560
Do you really?

2901
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:18,500
Where did you go?

2902
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:21,340
Where did you go?

2903
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,560
Oh, you're here.

2904
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:24,240
Should we throw it?

2905
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:28,160
Yeah, I'll throw it at the edge of this.

2906
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,760
I told you to do that.

2907
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:33,600
Alright, fucking buy every ticket.

2908
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,640
Oh my god, that scared me.

2909
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,300
That's fine.

2910
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,680
I have lots of...

2911
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,340
Oh my god.

2912
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:46,300
I need to make sure I stop falling.

2913
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:53,360
Alright.

2914
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,160
Oh, no.

2915
01:49:58,510 --> 01:49:58,910
Okay.

2916
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,010
Oh, what?

2917
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:03,450
What?

2918
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:05,490
We passed it.

2919
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:08,190
Wait, that means it's close.

2920
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:10,550
Oh my god, I'm waking up.

2921
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:11,390
I'm waking up.

2922
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:14,250
Okay, we go to that land and then we throw the eye again.

2923
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:15,470
Because we didn't walk that far.

2924
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,530
We didn't walk that far this time.

2925
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:19,710
Where did you go?

2926
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,030
Okay, then we throw it here.

2927
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:24,730
Because I know we didn't walk that far compared to the other one.

2928
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:28,270
Oh my god, oh my god, everybody.

2929
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:29,730
Oh my god, oh my god.

2930
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:30,390
This hopium.

2931
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:32,810
This hopium is right here.

2932
01:50:33,290 --> 01:50:34,810
Get the guests on it too.

2933
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:36,150
Everybody gets to play.

2934
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:39,890
Alright, let's maybe sleep first.

2935
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:41,670
It'll be a morning surprise.

2936
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:44,090
It'll be a...

2937
01:50:44,090 --> 01:50:44,950
Good morning.

2938
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:47,850
Good morning.

2939
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:49,790
Good morning.

2940
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:50,990
Good morning.

2941
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:53,050
Good morning.

2942
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,730
Come on.

2943
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:56,170
Come on.

2944
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:57,650
Come on.

2945
01:50:57,710 --> 01:51:00,170
Thank god.

2946
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:03,270
Alright.

2947
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:04,610
Throw it.

2948
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:07,130
Throw it in the sky.

2949
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:10,710
I'm gonna get the coal real quick.

2950
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:16,570
I'm obsessed with mining coal.

2951
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:19,070
It says beach.

2952
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:21,470
It says beach.

2953
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:24,390
Don't we have to be...

2954
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:25,450
In the...

2955
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:26,690
Don't we...

2956
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:29,010
Have to be like...

2957
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:31,890
I don't know.

2958
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:33,610
They said we passed it by.

2959
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:35,890
We passed two strongholds because of our coordinates.

2960
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:37,870
I don't know what to believe anymore.

2961
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,470
Well, that's fine.

2962
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,970
Of course, we're maybe gonna pass something.

2963
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:43,450
Alright.

2964
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:44,170
Throw!

2965
01:51:46,650 --> 01:51:47,670
Over there.

2966
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:49,770
Is it in the water?

2967
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:55,150
Uh-oh.

2968
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:57,810
What?

2969
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:00,090
Looking at my biome.

2970
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:04,560
Wait.

2971
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:05,880
Go away.

2972
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,240
It's back here?

2973
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:12,900
Is that what it said?

2974
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,140
Hold on, I'm trying...

2975
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:20,140
Let's do it on the mountain.

2976
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:21,760
On the mountain?

2977
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,560
All the way there?

2978
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:23,700
No.

2979
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:25,940
Because over here...

2980
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,860
It brought us back this way.

2981
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,540
No, because we were all the way down.

2982
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,600
We walked further.

2983
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,280
No, I threw it right there.

2984
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:35,540
In the knot.

2985
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:37,820
Should we throw it one more time then?

2986
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,120
Yeah, I'm gonna try here.

2987
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:53,480
Huh?

2988
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,620
Is it right below us?

2989
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:57,800
Is it in the water?

2990
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,160
Okay, I'm gonna go to the other side.

2991
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:04,400
Right here on this hilltop and try now.

2992
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,140
Okay.

2993
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,380
Please, God, no.

2994
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,660
Please be kind to us.

2995
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:11,860
We've been through so much.

2996
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:12,780
We've been through a lot.

2997
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:17,740
Oh, no!

2998
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,720
It's down there.

2999
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,400
Oh, no, it didn't break.

3000
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,840
Wow, this thing is indestructible.

3001
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:27,320
It's awesome.

3002
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:28,800
This is the worst seed.

3003
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,420
This is the worst seed ever.

3004
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:31,960
This is the worst seed.

3005
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:35,900
This is actually the worst seed.

3006
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:36,400
This is the worst seed ever.

3007
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,560
This is actually...

3008
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,660
It's the worst seed we've ever had.

3009
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:47,800
Okay.

3010
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:51,100
We can probably dig a...

3011
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:51,640
Get doors.

3012
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:52,820
I'm gonna make a door.

3013
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,240
I'm gonna make a door.

3014
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,300
We can probably dig...

3015
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,780
Like a... What's it called?

3016
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,540
A staircase from like...

3017
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,440
From the land.

3018
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:03,760
And it should be okay, maybe.

3019
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,380
Okay, I got a door.

3020
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:12,120
Like, what if we dig down from here and then just...

3021
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,120
I got a door.

3022
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:15,500
Here, right?

3023
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:16,600
It was here, right?

3024
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:18,780
About, yeah, I think.

3025
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:20,940
There we go.

3026
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:22,260
I'm ready to dig down.

3027
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:23,760
Where did you go?

3028
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,520
Oh, okay.

3029
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,540
Alright, dig down.

3030
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:30,160
I'm ready.

3031
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:30,780
Oh my god.

3032
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:31,780
I'll wait for you.

3033
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:35,260
I gave it back to you.

3034
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:36,340
I know.

3035
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:39,040
Where did my door go?

3036
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,500
Okay, there we go.

3037
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:43,320
Just know the water's gonna go inside.

3038
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:44,600
So you gotta keep digging.

3039
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:48,060
You gotta keep digging.

3040
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,160
I fucked up my door.

3041
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:54,920
I fucked it up!

3042
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:56,580
What do you mean you...

3043
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:58,040
What did you do?

3044
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:00,880
Okay.

3045
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:03,060
Alright, come down.

3046
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:04,740
Okay, I'm coming.

3047
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:07,140
Alright.

3048
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:18,300
Alright.

3049
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:21,660
I don't know how to do this.

3050
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:23,740
Just do a staircase down.

3051
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,260
Like a spiral staircase down, I think.

3052
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,120
What are we at?

3053
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:28,440
40?

3054
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,680
Alright, here we go.

3055
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:34,840
Where's my pickaxe?

3056
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:40,210
Alright.

3057
01:55:43,330 --> 01:55:43,890
Alright.

3058
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:46,670
Oopsie, I just...

3059
01:55:46,670 --> 01:55:47,410
Oh, my bad.

3060
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:49,350
That's fine, watch this.

3061
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,550
There we go.

3062
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,570
Okay, perfect.

3063
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:57,310
Oh, I fucked it up too.

3064
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:58,230
Oh my god.

3065
01:55:59,130 --> 01:55:59,570
Hold on.

3066
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:00,970
Do you have the other door?

3067
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:02,530
I have the other door.

3068
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:07,330
Wait, shoot, that's not how that works.

3069
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:09,310
You have to put it down here.

3070
01:56:09,550 --> 01:56:10,750
Give me the door, give me the door.

3071
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:13,190
Okay, hold on, I'm getting it.

3072
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:15,350
I gotta get it with my hands.

3073
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:20,470
Oh, here, I am here.

3074
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:21,890
Alright, pass me the door.

3075
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:25,950
I gave it to you.

3076
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:26,610
Alright.

3077
01:56:28,570 --> 01:56:29,150
Wait, I hear it.

3078
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:30,970
You hear what?

3079
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:32,570
No, that's my music.

3080
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:34,050
Here we go.

3081
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:37,930
I don't know how this works, how do we do this?

3082
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,310
How do we dig?

3083
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:43,590
Are we doing it correctly?

3084
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:45,890
Is this the stronghold area?

3085
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,970
I don't know.

3086
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:49,330
I don't know if I'm...

3087
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,710
Am I heading correctly to the stronghold?

3088
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:53,250
Am I...

3089
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:56,090
I've never done the stronghold before.

3090
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:57,890
I'm just digging.

3091
01:56:58,550 --> 01:57:00,990
I've never done stronghold before.

3092
01:57:01,330 --> 01:57:03,390
Just dig down?

3093
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:04,770
Okay, just dig down.

3094
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:06,890
Yeah, just do what you're doing.

3095
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:10,370
Just a little spiral staircase kind of thing.

3096
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,910
Just keep going.

3097
01:57:14,170 --> 01:57:15,290
Keep going down, I guess.

3098
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:16,770
Yeah, just keep going.

3099
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:17,790
Keep going down.

3100
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:17,850
Keep going down.

3101
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:25,030
We'll get there eventually.

3102
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:27,510
What if we go past it?

3103
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:28,690
I don't know.

3104
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:30,290
I can't tell.

3105
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:35,110
I don't think we will.

3106
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:36,110
I need iron.

3107
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:39,190
We need iron?

3108
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,270
I'll grab some just in case.

3109
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:45,050
Okay.

3110
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:50,410
You'll know when you get to it, though.

3111
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:51,090
Did we miss it?

3112
01:57:51,110 --> 01:57:51,990
What if we missed it?

3113
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:55,390
They're usually pretty deep, right?

3114
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:57,610
It's a cave.

3115
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,770
We're at a cave.

3116
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:00,850
Oh, but it's water.

3117
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:03,210
Yeah, this isn't...

3118
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:06,230
What is it?

3119
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:09,290
This is not it.

3120
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:11,870
I'm exploring a little.

3121
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:12,650
Oh gosh.

3122
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,610
Making another spiral staircase?

3123
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:19,550
Come back, come back, come back.

3124
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:20,550
I'm trying to find...

3125
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:22,810
Come back, come back.

3126
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:24,030
I'm trying to find you.

3127
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:27,610
That's just water.

3128
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:29,490
That's just water.

3129
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:34,090
Maybe we should go make some more doors.

3130
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:37,250
That's still water!

3131
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:44,030
Can you set down a...

3132
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:46,910
cooking table?

3133
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:49,110
Yeah, I can.

3134
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:51,130
I'll make some more doors.

3135
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:55,180
Here.

3136
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,280
Why is there more water under the water?

3137
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,000
Wait, where are you?

3138
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:58,680
Oh, you're over here.

3139
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:58,940
Okay.

3140
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,920
Why is there so much water?

3141
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:03,340
Why is there...

3142
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:04,560
Why is there...

3143
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,180
Why is there so much...

3144
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,260
I don't understand.

3145
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:09,020
Why is it just water?

3146
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:12,740
Why is this the worst seat out there?

3147
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:13,840
I don't...

3148
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,160
I don't understand.

3149
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:21,410
Like, is there anything that's not just water?

3150
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:21,530
Water?

3151
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:30,130
Like, it's water!

3152
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:38,530
Oh my God, it's a cave within water!

3153
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:40,790
Is that it?

3154
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:42,950
What did you see?

3155
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:44,410
I don't know what I just saw.

3156
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:45,950
You would know if you saw it.

3157
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:47,190
It's like a different block.

3158
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:49,130
There's a different block right there.

3159
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:51,390
No...

3160
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:53,550
It's not a...

3161
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:54,670
It's a normal block.

3162
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:55,850
Oh my God.

3163
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:57,670
Oh my God, it's hiding.

3164
01:59:58,890 --> 01:59:59,790
I hear a zombie.

3165
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,030
Oh, shit.

3166
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:07,750
How is it more submerged in water?

3167
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:16,510
It could be...

3168
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:18,230
A zombie.

3169
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:19,190
Oh, hi.

3170
02:00:19,790 --> 02:00:20,150
Hello.

3171
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:23,150
It could be a...

3172
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:27,630
It could be...

3173
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:31,010
A zombie that's in the...

3174
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:35,450
Maybe?

3175
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:36,630
This is...

3176
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:38,470
This is the worst fortress.

3177
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:39,190
Ever.

3178
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:42,250
I'm gonna start building there.

3179
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:44,610
Okay, and then...

3180
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:45,370
There you go.

3181
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:48,050
I'm in the Minecraft river.

3182
02:00:49,970 --> 02:00:52,550
I closed it off a little bit for you.

3183
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:53,950
Throw a pearl?

3184
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:55,870
Would it work if I...

3185
02:00:55,870 --> 02:00:57,010
There's more water?

3186
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:57,950
There's more water.

3187
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:59,230
Oh my...

3188
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:01,430
But there has to be an area.

3189
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:03,570
Use an eye to redirect?

3190
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:04,830
What was that eerie noise?

3191
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:07,990
That's just usually when there's a cave around.

3192
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,230
Okay, I'm gonna throw an eye.

3193
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:13,210
Come here, Doki.

3194
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:15,690
I'm gonna do it right here.

3195
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:16,710
I'm watching.

3196
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:19,150
I'm gonna do it...

3197
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:21,390
So we have some space.

3198
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:22,310
Alright.

3199
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:24,130
Eye!

3200
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:24,910
Go!

3201
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,550
What the fuck?

3202
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:29,230
Where's it going?

3203
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:30,770
I don't know.

3204
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:32,030
Where did it go?

3205
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:33,610
Where did it go?

3206
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:35,410
Where did your fucking eye go?

3207
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:36,410
I don't know.

3208
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:39,210
It's the other way.

3209
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:40,770
Where did it go?

3210
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,590
It went this way.

3211
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:44,790
It went right over here.

3212
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:46,670
We gotta go this way instead.

3213
02:01:47,230 --> 02:01:49,430
We grabbed the crafting table.

3214
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:51,890
Did you grab the crafting table?

3215
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:52,930
I got it, I got it.

3216
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:53,730
Which way did it go?

3217
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:55,490
It went that way?

3218
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:57,230
It went this way.

3219
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:59,630
Okay, I'm gonna mine this way then.

3220
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:04,310
Where are you mining at?

3221
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:06,670
I'm mining this way, the way you told me to go.

3222
02:02:06,910 --> 02:02:07,970
Oh yeah, that's good.

3223
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:11,190
Okay,

3224
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:16,490
nice.

3225
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:18,250
There we go.

3226
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:21,770
Yeah, this pearl is awesome.

3227
02:02:22,330 --> 02:02:23,030
Wait, is this the same?

3228
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:24,250
No, this is the second pearl.

3229
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:25,710
No, it's not.

3230
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:25,930
It's the same pearl.

3231
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:26,430
Yes, it is.

3232
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:27,810
I saw it broke last time.

3233
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:28,890
No, it didn't.

3234
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:30,750
I've had 21 this entire time.

3235
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:32,310
Oh, do I go down?

3236
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:34,410
Oh, are you going forward?

3237
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:35,850
I don't know.

3238
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:36,830
I'm just thinking straight.

3239
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:38,310
Should we do another eye?

3240
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:41,690
Yeah, we can do another one.

3241
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:42,930
Okay.

3242
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:44,890
Okay, hold on.

3243
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:45,950
Because the eye went...

3244
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:48,130
It went kind of upward, so...

3245
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:48,810
Alright, here I go.

3246
02:02:50,610 --> 02:02:51,010
Down!

3247
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:52,510
It went down?

3248
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:54,130
Where did it go?

3249
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:55,950
Where did your eye go?

3250
02:02:56,010 --> 02:02:56,950
I didn't even see your eye.

3251
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:58,010
I don't know.

3252
02:02:58,590 --> 02:02:59,510
Did it break?

3253
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:03,520
I don't know.

3254
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:05,460
We should make more space.

3255
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,180
It's down though.

3256
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:09,040
It's down for sure.

3257
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,660
Oh gosh.

3258
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,200
Alright, I made a spiral down.

3259
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:13,400
Okay.

3260
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:18,630
Did you make a spiral down?

3261
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:19,190
Okay, yeah, yeah.

3262
02:03:19,210 --> 02:03:20,210
From where that was.

3263
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:20,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3264
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:22,490
Just keep going down.

3265
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:25,010
Don't make it too big of a spiral.

3266
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:26,030
Try to keep it tight.

3267
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:27,510
Okay.

3268
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:29,530
I'm letting the biome go.

3269
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:30,990
It's pretty big.

3270
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:32,530
We're in the savanna now.

3271
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:34,730
We're in the savanna.

3272
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:37,510
Now we're in water.

3273
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:40,230
There's water right here.

3274
02:03:40,770 --> 02:03:41,070
Okay.

3275
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:43,970
Oh, hello.

3276
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,610
I guess we can't dig straight down.

3277
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:46,570
There's literally water.

3278
02:03:48,210 --> 02:03:49,450
There's literally water.

3279
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:50,710
What do you want from me?

3280
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:51,310
It's water.

3281
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:53,830
The stronghold sucks.

3282
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:55,990
The seed sucks.

3283
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,830
Everything sucks.

3284
02:03:58,290 --> 02:04:00,690
I knew the seed was going to be an issue.

3285
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:07,050
I knew the seed was going to be the biggest problem in the fucking world.

3286
02:04:07,450 --> 02:04:10,090
I think the first one was the best seed we've had.

3287
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:12,730
Okay, so...

3288
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:14,790
There's a giant cave.

3289
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:17,450
Should we put the eye...

3290
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:20,190
There's a giant cave here.

3291
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:21,610
And I'm worried.

3292
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:24,750
I don't like that.

3293
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:26,930
Where's giant cave?

3294
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:27,810
Oh gosh.

3295
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:29,630
Over there.

3296
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:31,750
You think it's under there?

3297
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:33,110
You think it's in there?

3298
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:35,650
Well, you got your bucket.

3299
02:04:36,070 --> 02:04:37,450
I got my boat too.

3300
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:40,490
You wanna just get a boat and go down or get water?

3301
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:42,410
We'll die.

3302
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:43,890
We'll die.

3303
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:44,550
Get the water.

3304
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:47,910
I'm gonna throw an eye right now.

3305
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:49,270
Can you see with the eye?

3306
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:51,650
We should make more room for this eye.

3307
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:53,950
Okay, let's make some room.

3308
02:05:03,010 --> 02:05:04,370
Is this enough room guys?

3309
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:07,710
We have a lot, yeah.

3310
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:08,570
So I think it's okay.

3311
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:10,190
Alright, here we go.

3312
02:05:11,230 --> 02:05:13,570
But it was like over here that it went down.

3313
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:15,310
So it might just go down.

3314
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:16,650
Like, if it goes...

3315
02:05:17,830 --> 02:05:18,710
Okay, here we go.

3316
02:05:27,230 --> 02:05:27,910
What?

3317
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:29,030
What?

3318
02:05:29,650 --> 02:05:30,550
Where did it go?

3319
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:31,890
Where did your eye go?

3320
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,610
It didn't break.

3321
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:35,490
I don't know.

3322
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:37,990
It didn't break though.

3323
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:38,390
What?

3324
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:42,530
It's down?

3325
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:43,710
It's just that way.

3326
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:45,530
Oh, they always go up.

3327
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:47,250
No, they don't.

3328
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:49,470
One before went down, did it not?

3329
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:51,450
Oh, it doesn't go down.

3330
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:54,710
The fortress is always above Y0?

3331
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:57,750
We are above Y0.

3332
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:02,530
We are.

3333
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:06,630
Where did it go?

3334
02:06:07,410 --> 02:06:08,090
I don't know.

3335
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:10,930
Is this where we came from?

3336
02:06:11,230 --> 02:06:12,630
Are we going the right way?

3337
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:14,310
I don't know where the eye went.

3338
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:15,910
Which direction was the eye?

3339
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:18,250
I did it from here.

3340
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:19,750
And it went this way.

3341
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:21,990
I'm so good.

3342
02:06:22,290 --> 02:06:23,530
Oh, it can go below.

3343
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:25,130
That person is fucking lying.

3344
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:26,170
Remember your name.

3345
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:28,830
I'm gonna fucking remember your name now.

3346
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:30,470
We've been through so much.

3347
02:06:30,530 --> 02:06:31,870
What's your fucking name?

3348
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,210
I need a...

3349
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:36,010
I'm gonna...

3350
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:37,950
Yeah, okay.

3351
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:41,710
That seems like a name that would lie to me.

3352
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:44,390
The thing is...

3353
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:46,170
The problem is that I'm scared now.

3354
02:06:46,270 --> 02:06:48,690
Because we can't find the eyes.

3355
02:06:53,650 --> 02:06:55,070
I don't want to keep using them.

3356
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:56,030
And then wasting them.

3357
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:56,450
Yeah.

3358
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,090
How many do we need to open the portal?

3359
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:00,630
It's 12, I think, right?

3360
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:01,630
How many do we have now?

3361
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:03,090
19.

3362
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:08,110
I don't remember where it went.

3363
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:08,910
My thing is...

3364
02:07:08,910 --> 02:07:11,350
I'm gonna make another pickaxe soon.

3365
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:12,670
Because mine is about to break.

3366
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:13,610
Uh-oh.

3367
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,420
Don't use your pickaxe.

3368
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:22,380
Just use your fist for this.

3369
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:23,700
It's too late.

3370
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:24,660
It's too late.

3371
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:27,100
This is the worst fucking scene.

3372
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:34,140
Okay.

3373
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:37,520
Alright, I'm gonna start doing a...

3374
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,600
A spiral staircase.

3375
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:40,080
From here.

3376
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:42,500
From here, okay.

3377
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:52,200
Sorry, there's no going back.

3378
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,820
Alright, alright.

3379
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:56,160
What?

3380
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:58,440
Oh, this is the giant cave?

3381
02:07:58,620 --> 02:07:59,340
Hold on, I'm looking.

3382
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,040
Oh, diamond.

3383
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:06,100
Okay.

3384
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:09,020
Just ignore it for now.

3385
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:13,120
What if it is in this cave?

3386
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:16,300
Usually it's like...

3387
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,860
Not in a cave cave, right?

3388
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:20,340
What if it is?

3389
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:23,100
What if...

3390
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,500
What if everything we know...

3391
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,080
Is wrong?

3392
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,020
They said throw it in the cave.

3393
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:30,300
Because there's a big space.

3394
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:30,380
There's a big space.

3395
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,220
I don't like that idea.

3396
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:37,680
I don't know what else to do.

3397
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:40,640
I think it's more over this way though.

3398
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:47,130
We're at Y level negative 3.

3399
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:48,450
Yeah, but they said...

3400
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:49,850
Oh, there's water.

3401
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:51,550
Oh my god.

3402
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:53,010
That scared me.

3403
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:54,730
I got pushed out.

3404
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:59,910
Wait, we have to go back down.

3405
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:00,490
Oh, there's...

3406
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:01,410
Oh, that's not a drown.

3407
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,870
Nevermind.

3408
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:02,810
Oh my god.

3409
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:06,250
I don't have the chairs...

3410
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:08,650
The doors, so...

3411
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:09,450
You don't have doors?

3412
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:11,590
I'll go to you.

3413
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,410
Oh, sorry.

3414
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:17,110
Yeah, it's fine.

3415
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:19,450
Okay, so...

3416
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:22,230
Here, I have some doors, so take them.

3417
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:23,650
I don't have space.

3418
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:26,290
Oh, throw away some cobblestone.

3419
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:27,450
Got it.

3420
02:09:30,490 --> 02:09:31,210
Here comes a drown.

3421
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:33,670
No, no, no.

3422
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:37,490
I'm back in the area.

3423
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:37,970
Come back.

3424
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:39,410
I can't come back.

3425
02:09:39,530 --> 02:09:40,790
Where is it?

3426
02:09:41,590 --> 02:09:42,470
Where is it?

3427
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:44,070
I can't get to you.

3428
02:09:44,650 --> 02:09:45,170
I'm here.

3429
02:09:45,590 --> 02:09:47,030
I don't know where.

3430
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:48,350
I'm here.

3431
02:09:49,890 --> 02:09:50,590
Look at me.

3432
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:53,370
Where is my shield?

3433
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:56,590
I don't know where you are.

3434
02:09:56,730 --> 02:09:58,790
I'm literally in front of the door.

3435
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:59,670
I'm in front of the door.

3436
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:00,250
Did you eat?

3437
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:04,030
I can't see anything.

3438
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:04,950
I'm in front of the door.

3439
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:07,150
I see you.

3440
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:09,050
I can't see anything.

3441
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:11,670
This is so bad.

3442
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:12,750
This is it.

3443
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:21,670
Come down!

3444
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:26,010
I see you!

3445
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:28,610
Follow me!

3446
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:50,530
Why did you open the door?

3447
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:52,990
I didn't open the door.

3448
02:10:55,010 --> 02:10:55,690
I was...

3449
02:10:55,690 --> 02:11:00,390
I was trying to get my shield up.

3450
02:11:01,050 --> 02:11:03,190
And then...

3451
02:11:03,190 --> 02:11:04,790
I couldn't see anything.

3452
02:11:06,010 --> 02:11:07,030
I couldn't see...

3453
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:08,830
I literally could not see anything.

3454
02:11:10,290 --> 02:11:11,770
Where did you die?

3455
02:11:12,210 --> 02:11:14,430
I just want to know where the stronghold is.

3456
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:16,270
Ok, I'll spectate.

3457
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:17,110
No!

3458
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:19,790
I can't spectate!

3459
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:20,690
You can?

3460
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:24,850
I can, but I'm back at our spawn point.

3461
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:26,190
Where is your eyes?

3462
02:11:26,190 --> 02:11:27,490
Wait, can I teleport to you?

3463
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,910
Where is your eye?

3464
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:29,870
I just...

3465
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:30,890
I just...

3466
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:35,110
I just want to know where the stronghold is.

3467
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:36,790
Oh my God!

3468
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:39,790
I can't believe it!

3469
02:11:40,110 --> 02:11:42,150
I can't believe it!

3470
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:45,370
I'm trying to find your eyes!

3471
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:46,370
Press 1?

3472
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:48,070
Oh, wait.

3473
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:49,670
How do I do that?

3474
02:11:49,790 --> 02:11:50,630
Wait, what's 1 do?

3475
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:53,170
Oh, teleport the player.

3476
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:53,770
Oh, ok.

3477
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:56,350
Ok, I'm by you.

3478
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,570
Ok, hold on.

3479
02:11:57,870 --> 02:12:00,430
I'm trying to find...

3480
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:02,670
Ok, hold on.

3481
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:04,170
I'm looking for the stronghold!

3482
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:06,190
I'm looking for the...

3483
02:12:06,190 --> 02:12:07,390
I'm in the giant cave!

3484
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:10,010
I'm looking for the stronghold!

3485
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:13,250
I just want to know where the stronghold is.

3486
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:15,470
That's all I want.

3487
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:17,410
That's actually all I...

3488
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,630
Um, where are you?

3489
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:20,270
Hold on, I see it!

3490
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,550
I just...

3491
02:12:21,550 --> 02:12:24,670
I just want to know where it is.

3492
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:26,490
I don't want much.

3493
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:27,930
I just want to know.

3494
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:31,270
I'm freaking throwing away the bed.

3495
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:32,130
I don't need it.

3496
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:35,490
Where is your eyes?

3497
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:37,950
Um...

3498
02:12:38,490 --> 02:12:40,050
We were so close to it.

3499
02:12:43,170 --> 02:12:44,290
We were...

3500
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,830
Like...

3501
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:47,130
Tell me where it is.

3502
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:49,350
Wait, hold on, hold on.

3503
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:52,850
No, this wouldn't have made it, but...

3504
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:57,310
Right over...

3505
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:58,650
Like...

3506
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:01,390
A little...

3507
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:01,950
Am I close?

3508
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,130
Oh my god!

3509
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:05,150
Are you kidding me?

3510
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:08,590
Oh my god, I don't know if we would have survived.

3511
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:09,310
Honestly though.

3512
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:12,690
Because right inside the stronghold...

3513
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:14,370
Is the trials!

3514
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:15,910
What the...

3515
02:13:15,910 --> 02:13:18,890
We would have died from these things in here!

3516
02:13:19,590 --> 02:13:20,710
This is an absolute...

3517
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:22,990
No, this is an absolute cursed...

3518
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:25,030
No, this is a cursed, cursed seed.

3519
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:26,590
This is a cursed...

3520
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:28,490
This seed is absolutely cursed.

3521
02:13:28,910 --> 02:13:30,190
No, no, no, no, no.

3522
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:32,790
Wait, really?

3523
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:35,010
It was next to...

3524
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:36,210
Am I close?

3525
02:13:37,530 --> 02:13:38,510
Where are you?

3526
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:39,930
Where is it?

3527
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:42,690
Hold on, let me teleport to you again.

3528
02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:43,830
Where is it?

3529
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:45,370
This...

3530
02:13:45,370 --> 02:13:47,590
We had trials!

3531
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:49,630
We had trials!

3532
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,950
Within...

3533
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:54,030
We would have had to go through trials to just get to...

3534
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:55,270
That would have been funny though.

3535
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:57,050
If we actually had to do that, that would have been...

3536
02:13:57,050 --> 02:13:57,950
This was the trial...

3537
02:13:57,950 --> 02:14:01,030
How many trials does this...

3538
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:02,990
Do we have to go through?

3539
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:04,530
That would have been funny though.

3540
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:07,230
That would have been really funny if that was how we died.

3541
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:08,970
Instead of the fucking...

3542
02:14:09,490 --> 02:14:12,410
No, instead I died to a fucking drown.

3543
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:14,110
Because I just can't...

3544
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:16,790
I hate the dumbest fucking enemy in the game!

3545
02:14:17,070 --> 02:14:18,150
I hate this!

3546
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:18,190
I hate this!

3547
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:20,810
Tell me where it is!

3548
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:22,310
I want to see it struggle!

3549
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:26,030
Okay, you're kind of far actually.

3550
02:14:26,410 --> 02:14:28,010
Oh, I'm far?!

3551
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:29,870
It's like you're close, but far.

3552
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:31,830
Like, it's a bit of a trek to get there.

3553
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:32,330
Okay, how?

3554
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:33,090
Which way?

3555
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:34,970
Okay, hold on.

3556
02:14:35,670 --> 02:14:36,290
Where are you?

3557
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:36,930
Let me see.

3558
02:14:39,290 --> 02:14:40,930
I have to find you again?

3559
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:41,410
Hold on.

3560
02:14:42,170 --> 02:14:42,550
How...

3561
02:14:43,010 --> 02:14:44,230
How was there...

3562
02:14:44,230 --> 02:14:45,190
How was...

3563
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:49,670
How could a trial be next to the fucking...

3564
02:14:49,670 --> 02:14:52,390
The merge with my stronghold?!

3565
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:53,650
I don't know.

3566
02:14:54,430 --> 02:14:55,310
Okay, hold on.

3567
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:56,530
I'm trying to figure out...

3568
02:14:56,530 --> 02:14:57,070
I'm doing...

3569
02:14:57,070 --> 02:14:59,330
I'm gonna do spectate.

3570
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:00,950
I'm gonna...

3571
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:02,150
Are you gonna die?

3572
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:03,570
No, I'm not.

3573
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:07,870
I was like, how are you gonna spectate?

3574
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:09,950
Where did that drown come from?

3575
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:10,830
He came out of nowhere!

3576
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:12,990
And then, we haven't had a drown...

3577
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:14,870
With a pickaxe or whatever.

3578
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:16,630
I tried it the entire time.

3579
02:15:16,970 --> 02:15:18,410
And then...

3580
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:19,830
And then it happened.

3581
02:15:19,970 --> 02:15:20,630
It just happened.

3582
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:21,990
And then it just happened.

3583
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:26,150
How am I supposed to do...

3584
02:15:26,150 --> 02:15:27,990
I already...

3585
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:30,710
What was it, guys?

3586
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:32,730
How do I...

3587
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:34,860
Slash game mode...

3588
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:38,830
Spectator?

3589
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:41,590
Oh my god.

3590
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:44,170
I'm giving myself admin.

3591
02:15:44,350 --> 02:15:45,050
Give me a sec.

3592
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:47,010
How do I...

3593
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:49,370
How do I admin myself?

3594
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,810
How do I mod myself?

3595
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:54,530
Guys, how do I mod myself right now?

3596
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:55,130
I'm gonna...

3597
02:15:56,350 --> 02:15:58,210
I'm gonna mod myself.

3598
02:15:59,170 --> 02:15:59,790
Slash...

3599
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:00,990
OP...

3600
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:03,310
Unknown.

3601
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:06,470
I'm gonna mod myself in the command.

3602
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:08,310
How do I do it?

3603
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:12,810
It says unknown or incomplete.

3604
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:17,990
Okay, maybe O-P-N.

3605
02:16:20,690 --> 02:16:21,790
Alright, there we go.

3606
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:29,410
Alright.

3607
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:35,950
Where is it?

3608
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:36,670
Where...

3609
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:40,690
Where the fuck is this stronghold?

3610
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:40,790
Where are you?

3611
02:16:42,170 --> 02:16:43,350
Where is it?

3612
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:45,890
Are you in hell?

3613
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:48,090
Yes, where is it?

3614
02:16:48,210 --> 02:16:49,630
Fall on your head.

3615
02:16:50,270 --> 02:16:52,390
So you have to go through here?

3616
02:16:52,930 --> 02:16:54,130
You have to go through here?

3617
02:16:54,210 --> 02:16:55,830
And then go down?

3618
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:56,890
Look at this.

3619
02:16:57,150 --> 02:17:00,330
This is the stronghold?

3620
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:02,450
But then over here?

3621
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:05,990
If we...

3622
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,810
Oh my god.

3623
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,370
The trials are huge.

3624
02:17:08,370 --> 02:17:11,390
Is that the trials right there?

3625
02:17:12,130 --> 02:17:13,330
It's a copper ship!

3626
02:17:14,070 --> 02:17:14,570
Yes!

3627
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:17,290
Oh my god!

3628
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:20,210
What kind of LLC is this?

3629
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:21,150
Oh my god!

3630
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:23,190
Oh my god!

3631
02:17:24,270 --> 02:17:24,890
Oh my god!

3632
02:17:25,430 --> 02:17:25,930
Oh my god!

3633
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:31,210
The portal has no eyes in it?

3634
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:33,670
Would we even be able to fill it up?

3635
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:34,630
Oh my god!

3636
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:37,390
Where's the portal?

3637
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:40,130
There's more over here!

3638
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:41,490
Look at this!

3639
02:17:41,550 --> 02:17:43,290
We'd just be exploring and then...

3640
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:45,310
Run into the trials!

3641
02:17:46,470 --> 02:17:47,450
There's insanity!

3642
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,570
There's no eyes!

3643
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:51,010
There's no eyes!

3644
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:52,270
There's a spawner!

3645
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:54,290
Oh my god!

3646
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:56,990
And there's no eyes!

3647
02:17:58,490 --> 02:18:00,350
6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

3648
02:18:00,350 --> 02:18:01,110
No, we had enough.

3649
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:01,670
It was 12.

3650
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:02,910
Okay, we had enough.

3651
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:04,310
Oh wow!

3652
02:18:05,270 --> 02:18:07,170
This is the worst seed ever!

3653
02:18:07,230 --> 02:18:09,310
There's another spawner right here!

3654
02:18:09,550 --> 02:18:11,550
This is the worst seed ever!

3655
02:18:15,330 --> 02:18:18,270
We fought against this seed!

3656
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:19,750
Every second!

3657
02:18:21,390 --> 02:18:22,830
We fought!

3658
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:24,010
Fought!

3659
02:18:24,550 --> 02:18:24,770
Fought!

3660
02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:26,930
This is rigged from the start!

3661
02:18:27,470 --> 02:18:29,030
It's rigged from the start!

3662
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:33,810
How do I show you guys the seed?

3663
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:36,150
How do I give you guys...

3664
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:36,990
Oh my god!

3665
02:18:37,430 --> 02:18:39,270
God fears the seed!

3666
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:41,710
God fears the seed!

3667
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:47,770
Okay, now I'm gonna see what the seed is.

3668
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:49,370
Look at this!

3669
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:50,170
The trials!

3670
02:18:50,430 --> 02:18:53,230
Literally, we walk up this door and we'd be in the trials!

3671
02:18:53,590 --> 02:18:55,410
So absolutely cursed!

3672
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:56,670
Have the seed!

3673
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:57,810
Where are you?

3674
02:18:58,070 --> 02:18:58,910
That would be...

3675
02:18:58,910 --> 02:19:05,970
We would just be exploring and we would come upon the trials and then these guys would be released and we would just be dead!

3676
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:08,150
We would just be doing the trials!

3677
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:12,350
And actually we wouldn't even make it to the fucking...

3678
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:13,990
We wouldn't even make it.

3679
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:17,110
With our luck, we would not have made it to the fucking...

3680
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:19,650
We had to dig underwater.

3681
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:22,670
We had to dig underwater.

3682
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:26,590
And they made the trials harder too in our core!

3683
02:19:27,310 --> 02:19:28,190
It was...

3684
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,390
Oh my god, no!

3685
02:19:29,530 --> 02:19:30,430
If we dig...

3686
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:32,570
Oh my god, if we had to dig...

3687
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:36,970
We just had to dig in the mountain but it showed us not the mountain!

3688
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:38,850
It showed us not the mountain!

3689
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:40,190
If we dig...

3690
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:43,650
Oh my god, if we dig from the underwater that we did we would have been in the trials.

3691
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:49,970
If we went, if we followed the water if we dug in the water it would have been...

3692
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:53,510
We would have dropped into the trial room.

3693
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:57,070
We would have actually dropped into the trial room!

3694
02:19:57,070 --> 02:19:59,270
From down below, from the water!

3695
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:03,050
It's literally the water area!

3696
02:20:03,430 --> 02:20:05,850
It's literally the water area!

3697
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:06,650
It's literally the water area!

3698
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:13,490
Oh my god, if we dug underwater and it told us to dig underwater too there was the worst part.

3699
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:15,090
It was the worst part.

3700
02:20:15,090 --> 02:20:17,270
It was the worst part.

3701
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:18,710
We would have landed in here.

3702
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:23,970
You should go back into normal in the trials and see what happens.

3703
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:27,310
Alright, I'm gonna go in.

3704
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:29,470
What is this?

3705
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:31,510
How do I get into the...

3706
02:20:33,310 --> 02:20:33,790
survival...

3707
02:20:33,790 --> 02:20:34,830
Wait, where are you?

3708
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:40,930
This is the seed.

3709
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:45,590
Here's the seed by the way so you can post it in your own.

3710
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:46,810
This woke me up.

3711
02:20:47,230 --> 02:20:48,170
What is it?

3712
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:48,470
This woke me up.

3713
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,830
Okay, you ready?

3714
02:20:53,310 --> 02:20:54,770
I'm next to you.

3715
02:20:54,890 --> 02:21:00,010
I'm gonna put in survival and see what happens.

3716
02:21:02,190 --> 02:21:03,890
Alright, here I am.

3717
02:21:04,110 --> 02:21:05,210
How does it work?

3718
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:06,690
Here comes Ace.

3719
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:07,450
Oh my god.

3720
02:21:07,850 --> 02:21:10,230
There's like poison skellies here.

3721
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:13,330
How do I start the trials?

3722
02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:17,030
I think you just exist in here and the trials start.

3723
02:21:17,150 --> 02:21:17,810
Oh, here's the thing.

3724
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:18,830
There you go.

3725
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:21,770
Here's the breeze.

3726
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:27,030
This is what we have to go through if we live this long.

3727
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:29,010
If we live this long.

3728
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:30,570
This is what we have to...

3729
02:21:30,570 --> 02:21:31,970
Oh my god, it's coming.

3730
02:21:32,590 --> 02:21:34,150
It's coming for me.

3731
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:37,350
Oh my god, the poison skellies.

3732
02:21:37,510 --> 02:21:38,690
This is absolutely cursed.

3733
02:21:38,910 --> 02:21:40,250
This is absolutely cursed.

3734
02:21:40,770 --> 02:21:41,950
Oh my god.

3735
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:44,200
This is what I have to go through.

3736
02:21:47,090 --> 02:21:48,750
Oh my god.

3737
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:51,390
This is what I have to live through.

3738
02:21:53,710 --> 02:21:55,110
She's doing it, chat.

3739
02:21:55,430 --> 02:21:56,430
She's doing it.

3740
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:59,990
Oh my god, my entire chat is just sound effects.

3741
02:22:00,530 --> 02:22:01,070
Oh my god.

3742
02:22:07,150 --> 02:22:09,310
So they just don't stop.

3743
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:10,610
They just don't stop.

3744
02:22:10,710 --> 02:22:12,690
I can't even destroy this.

3745
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:23,670
Oh my god.

3746
02:22:25,690 --> 02:22:29,210
I'm not okay.

3747
02:22:29,510 --> 02:22:30,150
I'm actually...

3748
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:32,670
I'm not okay.

3749
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:34,670
I'm not okay.

3750
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:38,910
Oh my god, I'm not okay.

3751
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:40,490
I'm not...

3752
02:22:40,490 --> 02:22:41,530
I'm not...

3753
02:22:41,530 --> 02:22:43,090
I got to the stragglers.

3754
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:45,750
I got to the stragglers.

3755
02:22:46,850 --> 02:22:48,530
I'm in the stragglers.

3756
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:50,150
I'm in the stragglers.

3757
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:51,290
This is the only way...

3758
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:54,310
This is the only way to get out.

3759
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:57,070
They can't open doors.

3760
02:22:57,470 --> 02:22:57,990
They can't...

3761
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:00,610
They can't open doors.

3762
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:01,810
Oh my god.

3763
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:04,070
Oh, you killed him, guys.

3764
02:23:04,450 --> 02:23:05,410
Oh my god.

3765
02:23:05,810 --> 02:23:07,490
You're full of arrows.

3766
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:09,990
I made it to the stronghold.

3767
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:11,270
Let's go.

3768
02:23:11,830 --> 02:23:12,470
Yippee.

3769
02:23:14,910 --> 02:23:17,210
Here's the coordinates, guys.

3770
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:18,210
Here it is.

3771
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:20,590
Oh my god.

3772
02:23:20,890 --> 02:23:21,670
I'm glad we...

3773
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:24,710
I'm glad we ended up committing to see this bullshit.

3774
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:28,430
Oh, now you can go again.

3775
02:23:28,430 --> 02:23:31,010
It opens right up into it.

3776
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:32,470
Round two.

3777
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:37,830
Oh my god.

3778
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:47,310
There's no way.

3779
02:23:47,510 --> 02:23:53,170
I would've... I think if we had lived here, I just would've turned around and been like, go straight to the eye.

3780
02:23:54,130 --> 02:23:56,470
Don't look at anything else.

3781
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:57,110
Don't even...

3782
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:59,450
We can't even find the eye.

3783
02:23:59,450 --> 02:24:02,570
We don't even know where the eye was.

3784
02:24:02,850 --> 02:24:05,270
We don't even know where it was.

3785
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:07,770
But I know we're in round two.

3786
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:10,550
Oh my god.

3787
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:12,310
There's some spawners up here.

3788
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:13,870
It's in the chest.

3789
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:16,650
It's like wooden axes.

3790
02:24:17,550 --> 02:24:18,790
This sucks.

3791
02:24:18,970 --> 02:24:19,370
Oh my god.

3792
02:24:19,570 --> 02:24:22,450
This is the worst edition ever to Minecraft.

3793
02:24:23,050 --> 02:24:25,490
I can break the trial rule.

3794
02:24:25,930 --> 02:24:27,930
I can be like, I'm fucking out.

3795
02:24:37,370 --> 02:24:39,430
They're not supposed to merge, right?

3796
02:24:39,890 --> 02:24:41,410
I don't think so.

3797
02:24:41,450 --> 02:24:42,670
I've never seen this before.

3798
02:24:42,970 --> 02:24:44,610
They're not supposed to merge, right?

3799
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:46,090
I've never seen this before.

3800
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:48,350
Are they supposed to merge?

3801
02:24:49,050 --> 02:24:50,770
Are they supposed to merge?

3802
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:51,030
Are they supposed to merge?

3803
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:53,650
Is this supposed to happen?

3804
02:24:54,470 --> 02:24:56,930
No, someone said...

3805
02:24:56,930 --> 02:24:58,750
It's not supposed to.

3806
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:02,450
Someone literally said it's not supposed to.

3807
02:25:04,690 --> 02:25:06,530
Oh my god.

3808
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:09,090
I'm filing a complaint with Minecraft.

3809
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:10,270
Oh my god.

3810
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:12,410
Oh my god.

3811
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:13,910
Why?

3812
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:16,030
Why is there a sea blade?

3813
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:19,770
What was the scene?

3814
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:20,930
What was the scene?

3815
02:25:20,930 --> 02:25:22,890
I posted it in our chat.

3816
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:24,030
You can post it.

3817
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:25,830
Okay, thank you.

3818
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:28,750
This is the scene for anybody who wants to explore.

3819
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:29,570
Have fun.

3820
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:31,610
Have fun in this hellhole.

3821
02:25:31,770 --> 02:25:32,610
I'm gonna...

3822
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:34,550
Enjoy.

3823
02:25:35,090 --> 02:25:36,110
Have fun.

3824
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:39,370
I'm gonna delete this world.

3825
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:42,430
I'm deleting this world.

3826
02:25:43,470 --> 02:25:43,650
What?

3827
02:25:43,650 --> 02:25:44,650
Is this the outside?

3828
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:47,570
This is the outside of the trial.

3829
02:25:47,690 --> 02:25:49,330
This is the newest version.

3830
02:25:49,570 --> 02:25:52,430
This is the newest version.

3831
02:25:53,010 --> 02:25:53,790
This is actually...

3832
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:55,790
The trials are huge.

3833
02:25:56,030 --> 02:25:57,130
It's humongous.

3834
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:58,470
It never ends.

3835
02:25:58,690 --> 02:26:00,290
I'm gonna sleep through the night.

3836
02:26:05,490 --> 02:26:09,030
Where did you go?

3837
02:26:09,210 --> 02:26:09,750
I don't know.

3838
02:26:09,810 --> 02:26:11,070
I'm going back to spectate.

3839
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:12,210
I need to know where I...

3840
02:26:12,210 --> 02:26:14,710
I need to know where I went to.

3841
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:16,870
Oh my god.

3842
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:18,490
This is actually...

3843
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:19,610
Just a bunch of potatoes.

3844
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:21,290
Why is the loot in here so terrible?

3845
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:24,570
What was the point of being in the trials?

3846
02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:26,330
What was the point?

3847
02:26:26,490 --> 02:26:27,850
What was the point?

3848
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:30,470
What was the point of being in the trials?

3849
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:31,790
Where is the end?

3850
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:34,330
I don't even know.

3851
02:26:34,410 --> 02:26:36,150
I went all the way from here.

3852
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:37,430
I'm going to the ender dragon.

3853
02:26:37,430 --> 02:26:39,310
I'm fucking... I'm going in.

3854
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:40,990
How are you going to the ender dragon?

3855
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:43,010
I'm going to the ender dragon.

3856
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:45,790
How do I go to the end?

3857
02:26:46,030 --> 02:26:46,910
How do I...

3858
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:49,430
How do I teleport to you?

3859
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:53,230
You have to probably...

3860
02:26:53,230 --> 02:26:55,050
Go to the eye and then put in the thing.

3861
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:56,170
Oh my god.

3862
02:26:56,250 --> 02:26:57,130
I'm going in.

3863
02:26:57,290 --> 02:26:58,670
I'm going in.

3864
02:26:59,390 --> 02:27:01,330
Get this shit out of here.

3865
02:27:01,530 --> 02:27:02,450
Get this...

3866
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:04,710
Get this shit out of here.

3867
02:27:04,710 --> 02:27:05,870
You got all my stuff?

3868
02:27:07,370 --> 02:27:09,770
No, I'm fucking in creative mode.

3869
02:27:09,890 --> 02:27:10,690
I'm in creative.

3870
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:12,610
Can you change my mode?

3871
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:13,910
Since you're admin.

3872
02:27:14,810 --> 02:27:15,370
I can.

3873
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:18,250
Game mode, creative.

3874
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:21,550
There we go.

3875
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:22,970
Yeah!

3876
02:27:23,370 --> 02:27:23,710
I'm back!

3877
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:26,170
I'm back, baby!

3878
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:27,630
Get the eye.

3879
02:27:27,690 --> 02:27:29,230
Get the eye and put it in.

3880
02:27:29,570 --> 02:27:31,450
Get the eye and put it in.

3881
02:27:32,450 --> 02:27:34,210
We're doing a survival.

3882
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:35,850
We've suffered enough.

3883
02:27:36,290 --> 02:27:37,530
We've suffered enough.

3884
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:39,930
We've suffered enough.

3885
02:27:40,490 --> 02:27:41,630
Get in here.

3886
02:27:41,970 --> 02:27:43,070
We're going in.

3887
02:27:44,070 --> 02:27:46,450
We're going in.

3888
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:49,830
We're going to finish this scene.

3889
02:27:50,370 --> 02:27:51,370
We're going to...

3890
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:54,910
Oh my god, we're in the worst spot.

3891
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:56,170
This is so...

3892
02:27:57,970 --> 02:28:00,470
We haven't even had enough to get...

3893
02:28:00,470 --> 02:28:01,690
I had to...

3894
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:05,640
Oh my god.

3895
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:08,160
Oh my god.

3896
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,120
I'm fucking...

3897
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:14,270
Come on, let's go beat this fucker.

3898
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:15,870
Let's go.

3899
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:17,250
Get the right sword.

3900
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:18,230
Oh my god.

3901
02:28:19,230 --> 02:28:20,410
Let's go.

3902
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:23,210
Guys, I told you I could...

3903
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:25,290
We're doing it.

3904
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:26,930
We're doing it.

3905
02:28:28,170 --> 02:28:30,170
No, you don't get to have that.

3906
02:28:30,670 --> 02:28:32,550
You don't get to have that either.

3907
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:33,830
For this one.

3908
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:36,070
For this one.

3909
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:38,430
Kill him.

3910
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:39,350
Kill him.

3911
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:42,690
Oh wait, there is one more.

3912
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:46,350
Kill him.

3913
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:46,890
Fly.

3914
02:28:48,310 --> 02:28:48,970
Fly.

3915
02:28:52,990 --> 02:28:55,570
We have the point of everything we did.

3916
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:57,030
What was the point?

3917
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:58,390
What was the point?

3918
02:28:58,810 --> 02:29:00,190
What was the point?

3919
02:29:00,190 --> 02:29:04,990
What was the point?

3920
02:29:05,390 --> 02:29:06,590
What was the point?

3921
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:07,530
Oh my god.

3922
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:14,410
Do your fucking thing now.

3923
02:29:15,430 --> 02:29:16,530
Do it.

3924
02:29:18,310 --> 02:29:19,590
We're so touched.

3925
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:20,430
Oh, you're charging.

3926
02:29:20,910 --> 02:29:22,630
This whole scene.

3927
02:29:22,990 --> 02:29:26,870
This is so cathartic right now.

3928
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:28,850
I've done...

3929
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:29,950
I've done...

3930
02:29:30,990 --> 02:29:33,230
14 hours of this.

3931
02:29:33,490 --> 02:29:35,570
Almost 14 hours.

3932
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:36,750
And then...

3933
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:38,470
They had to put a child.

3934
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:39,950
Die, you gotta die.

3935
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:40,990
The dragon died.

3936
02:29:41,530 --> 02:29:42,790
The honey wasn't in the water.

3937
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,430
Everything, screw you.

3938
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:47,490
Screw this whole world.

3939
02:29:47,830 --> 02:29:49,810
Everybody in this world deserves to die.

3940
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:51,690
This whole...

3941
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:54,290
I'm deleting this world right after we kill this dragon.

3942
02:29:54,290 --> 02:29:56,230
This world will cease to exist.

3943
02:29:57,330 --> 02:30:00,750
This world will cease to exist right after.

3944
02:30:01,170 --> 02:30:02,010
Cease to exist.

3945
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:03,490
Come on, a little bit more.

3946
02:30:04,110 --> 02:30:04,370
Yeah,

3947
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:11,030
I'm talking about you too.

3948
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:17,150
That's fucking right.

3949
02:30:23,750 --> 02:30:25,370
Let's go in there, come on.

3950
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:28,280
Let's go.

3951
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,840
Guys, we did it, we beat the ender dragon.

3952
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:32,140
We beat the ender dragon.

3953
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:34,520
We beat the ender dragon.

3954
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,120
It's over.

3955
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:42,860
Holy fuck.

3956
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,680
It's actually...

3957
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:45,340
It's over.

3958
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:48,280
It's a kill.

3959
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:50,280
Oh my god.

3960
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:53,480
Oh my god.

3961
02:30:55,740 --> 02:30:57,020
I'm crying.

3962
02:30:57,640 --> 02:30:58,960
I'm fucking crying.

3963
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:02,200
I can't believe.

3964
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:03,520
Oh my god.

3965
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:04,560
The seed.

3966
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:09,420
The seed is not meant for men.

3967
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:20,980
Oh my god.

3968
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:21,880
I

3969
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:29,050
can't believe.

3970
02:31:29,050 --> 02:31:32,110
I can't even see the end spot.

3971
02:31:34,910 --> 02:31:39,650
We somehow managed to survive all of that.

3972
02:31:40,670 --> 02:31:45,190
Seriously, I thought our luck was turning around when I just happened to come across the fortress.

3973
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:46,370
I was like, oh my god, wait.

3974
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:48,630
This is actually doable, we can do this.

3975
02:31:49,230 --> 02:31:50,930
And then...

3976
02:31:51,490 --> 02:31:52,010
Everything.

3977
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:54,290
Everything changed.

3978
02:31:54,510 --> 02:31:57,710
The entire cosmos was against us.

3979
02:31:57,710 --> 02:31:58,710
That's right, it's true.

3980
02:32:03,230 --> 02:32:04,710
Oh my god.

3981
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:08,110
How did we get the seed?

3982
02:32:08,950 --> 02:32:13,590
How did we get it?

3983
02:32:14,130 --> 02:32:17,870
If only we didn't throw it in the beginning.

3984
02:32:18,910 --> 02:32:21,030
We would have had the best...

3985
02:32:21,550 --> 02:32:24,270
All the other seeds we had started out so well.

3986
02:32:24,430 --> 02:32:25,530
And then we were like, you know what?

3987
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:27,170
Hopper gets to go to fight with this one.

3988
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:28,150
We got this.

3989
02:32:28,750 --> 02:32:29,910
We got this.

3990
02:32:30,530 --> 02:32:31,950
It can't be.

3991
02:32:32,910 --> 02:32:34,130
We got this.

3992
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:37,650
Oh my god.

3993
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:40,410
We can finally sleep.

3994
02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:43,310
I'm glad we toughened it out.

3995
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:45,850
To just see what it was like at the end.

3996
02:32:45,950 --> 02:32:46,530
Just to see.

3997
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:48,250
Just to see.

3998
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:53,510
I think if we went to bed and we were like, let's do the end and try it tomorrow.

3999
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:55,710
That we would not have survived.

4000
02:32:58,030 --> 02:32:59,870
No, we wouldn't have survived.

4001
02:33:00,230 --> 02:33:03,910
It would have been the fastest second stream.

4002
02:33:05,350 --> 02:33:07,230
Oh my god.

4003
02:33:09,390 --> 02:33:11,530
It was rigged from the start.

4004
02:33:11,950 --> 02:33:13,930
I'm glad that we have all of that on camera.

4005
02:33:13,930 --> 02:33:14,570
I'm glad.

4006
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:25,090
Just me finding the stronghold and them being like, what the...

4007
02:33:25,090 --> 02:33:26,070
What are the trials?

4008
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:27,870
The trials are connection.

4009
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:31,030
And they were like, it's not supposed to merge.

4010
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:33,090
It's not supposed to merge.

4011
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:33,670
It's not supposed to merge.

4012
02:33:34,030 --> 02:33:35,910
But yet, somehow.

4013
02:33:36,430 --> 02:33:38,450
I like how someone was like, you shouldn't have cheated.

4014
02:33:38,910 --> 02:33:39,210
What?

4015
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:43,510
After everything.

4016
02:33:43,690 --> 02:33:46,450
We have this.

4017
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:49,670
We played fair the entire time.

4018
02:33:49,810 --> 02:33:51,010
We played fair.

4019
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:52,630
We didn't even give you the seed.

4020
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:54,330
We tried so hard.

4021
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:59,610
And now you're like, you shouldn't have cheated.

4022
02:34:01,470 --> 02:34:02,830
Seeds get degrees.

4023
02:34:03,070 --> 02:34:05,030
And you know what letter cheater starts with?

4024
02:34:07,890 --> 02:34:09,530
We needed this.

4025
02:34:09,530 --> 02:34:11,430
We were so cathartic.

4026
02:34:11,550 --> 02:34:14,690
Killing the dragon after everything we've been through.

4027
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:16,370
I can't believe the trials.

4028
02:34:16,550 --> 02:34:18,230
The trials would have killed us.

4029
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:19,050
If anything.

4030
02:34:20,310 --> 02:34:22,030
Oh my god.

4031
02:34:23,530 --> 02:34:26,210
Someone just said the seed cheated first.

4032
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:26,970
Yes!

4033
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:29,910
The seed cheated first.

4034
02:34:30,290 --> 02:34:32,790
It was all the seed's fault.

4035
02:34:35,690 --> 02:34:38,210
It was the seed's fault.

4036
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:41,970
Even chat was like, give us the seed.

4037
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:43,390
We'll find the fortress for you.

4038
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:44,970
Give us the seed.

4039
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:46,090
You guys need to sleep.

4040
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:46,790
Go to bed.

4041
02:34:47,990 --> 02:34:49,490
Just do it tomorrow.

4042
02:34:49,710 --> 02:34:50,370
Go to bed.

4043
02:34:50,830 --> 02:34:53,750
If we did this tomorrow, this would have hurt even more.

4044
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:58,470
This would have hurt even more.

4045
02:34:58,650 --> 02:35:01,970
If we went to bed and tried to do this tomorrow.

4046
02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:05,370
Oh my god.

4047
02:35:05,370 --> 02:35:06,730
Someone made a good point too.

4048
02:35:06,810 --> 02:35:08,510
You don't even know what the trials look like.

4049
02:35:08,510 --> 02:35:10,250
So you would have just walked right in.

4050
02:35:10,250 --> 02:35:19,350
And then our armor would be broken before we get to the end.

4051
02:35:20,170 --> 02:35:23,710
If we survived the trials, our armor would be broken.

4052
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:26,810
We would have no resources for the ending.

4053
02:35:27,230 --> 02:35:28,530
Here's the seed, everybody.

4054
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:30,670
Seed of this world.

4055
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:33,550
If you guys want to try and do the seed of this world.

4056
02:35:33,550 --> 02:35:34,310
Here, I'll pin it.

4057
02:35:34,490 --> 02:35:35,910
Here you go, everybody.

4058
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:39,110
Enjoy, have fun.

4059
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:46,290
I think this is the most us ending.

4060
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:53,170
Only we could have conjured this to happen.

4061
02:35:53,730 --> 02:35:56,790
After literally all the bullshit we went through.

4062
02:35:57,130 --> 02:35:57,830
Everything.

4063
02:35:58,750 --> 02:36:00,510
Oh my god.

4064
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:02,090
It's the perfect ending.

4065
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:04,270
It truly was.

4066
02:36:05,010 --> 02:36:05,810
Oh gosh.

4067
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:07,250
Okay, I'll see you next week.

4068
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:09,590
Next time when we do it legit.

4069
02:36:10,290 --> 02:36:11,210
I guess.

4070
02:36:11,390 --> 02:36:13,130
We will try it legitimately again.

4071
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:14,470
We'll try one day.

4072
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:16,670
We just need to recover from this.

4073
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:17,630
We need to recover.

4074
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:21,270
When we wanted to do this.

4075
02:36:21,550 --> 02:36:23,930
We didn't think this was going to happen.

4076
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:25,670
We didn't think we would.

4077
02:36:26,190 --> 02:36:28,650
We would go through such pain.

4078
02:36:28,950 --> 02:36:30,890
For those who wanted the coordinates of the stronghold.

4079
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:32,290
I pressed F3.

4080
02:36:32,510 --> 02:36:35,330
When we were exploring the trial room.

4081
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:39,170
So just find that in the VOD.

4082
02:36:39,350 --> 02:36:40,170
I'm done.

4083
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:43,410
Yeah, I think I'm going to go to sleep now.

4084
02:36:43,710 --> 02:36:44,230
Me too.

4085
02:36:44,450 --> 02:36:46,190
I have this rush of adrenaline.

4086
02:36:46,570 --> 02:36:48,290
I did too.

4087
02:36:48,470 --> 02:36:49,530
When we found the trial rooms.

4088
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:51,150
I woke the fuck up.

4089
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:54,290
I was filled with so much anger.

4090
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:56,710
And disbelief.

4091
02:36:58,050 --> 02:36:59,930
We spent like an hour.

4092
02:37:00,130 --> 02:37:02,550
Prepping for the ender dragon.

4093
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:04,990
While we were sleep deprived.

4094
02:37:05,190 --> 02:37:06,030
We spent an hour.

4095
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:07,230
Just leveling up.

4096
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:09,450
Just not to know.

4097
02:37:09,690 --> 02:37:11,510
That it was just unwinnable in the end.

4098
02:37:11,610 --> 02:37:12,950
It was never winnable.

4099
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:15,230
You know what's probably the case too.

4100
02:37:15,430 --> 02:37:16,950
Is that stronghold.

4101
02:37:17,050 --> 02:37:18,830
That your chat mentioned.

4102
02:37:18,930 --> 02:37:20,250
That you passed over.

4103
02:37:20,390 --> 02:37:22,190
Probably was way easier.

4104
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:26,050
Probably was a proper stronghold.

4105
02:37:26,050 --> 02:37:27,350
Okay, you're right.

4106
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:29,230
It probably was.

4107
02:37:29,850 --> 02:37:32,250
We got sent to the bullshit one.

4108
02:37:32,590 --> 02:37:33,970
We followed the eyes.

4109
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:36,390
We followed the eyes.

4110
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:37,770
Just to be here.

4111
02:37:38,350 --> 02:37:38,850
Oh my god.

4112
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:43,330
Just to be.

4113
02:37:43,890 --> 02:37:45,450
Oh my god.

4114
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:47,550
No, I'm deleting this scene.

4115
02:37:47,670 --> 02:37:48,890
We're starting on a new scene.

4116
02:37:49,010 --> 02:37:50,450
When we're doing this again.

4117
02:37:51,210 --> 02:37:54,390
We're starting on a new scene.

4118
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:56,990
We're not doing this again.

4119
02:37:58,050 --> 02:37:59,650
I'm deleting the world.

4120
02:37:59,770 --> 02:38:01,590
I'm deleting the world.

4121
02:38:04,290 --> 02:38:06,150
They're telling us to wake up.

4122
02:38:06,250 --> 02:38:07,810
We haven't even gone to sleep yet.

4123
02:38:07,810 --> 02:38:08,190
Wake up.

4124
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:11,510
I lost my dogs in this scene.

4125
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:12,330
Twice.

4126
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:17,530
We had that weird glitch.

4127
02:38:18,330 --> 02:38:20,610
I woke up and they were gone.

4128
02:38:20,910 --> 02:38:22,530
It's like they never existed.

4129
02:38:22,530 --> 02:38:24,950
They never existed.

4130
02:38:25,850 --> 02:38:26,650
In my life.

4131
02:38:27,550 --> 02:38:29,690
My first dog just disappeared.

4132
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:30,570
Just disappeared.

4133
02:38:31,550 --> 02:38:34,070
How do I escape from the...

4134
02:38:34,070 --> 02:38:35,350
Oh, there we go.

4135
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:36,930
You press space bar.

4136
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:38,770
I'm back.

4137
02:38:39,710 --> 02:38:41,250
I'm in the fucking...

4138
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:43,330
I'm in the bed.

4139
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:46,570
I'm in the trials.

4140
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:47,450
I'm back.

4141
02:38:48,730 --> 02:38:50,510
I never left.

4142
02:38:50,510 --> 02:38:52,230
I never left town.

4143
02:38:52,930 --> 02:38:54,290
I'm back in our...

4144
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:57,050
In this initial spawn point.

4145
02:39:02,170 --> 02:39:03,610
Are you coming to me?

4146
02:39:03,810 --> 02:39:04,630
I'll come to you.

4147
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:06,670
I'm literally in front of you.

4148
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:08,850
Oh my god.

4149
02:39:10,250 --> 02:39:12,230
Let's see where the Eye of Ender takes us now.

4150
02:39:15,010 --> 02:39:16,350
Come on Eye of Ender.

4151
02:39:16,570 --> 02:39:17,990
Come on Eye of Ender.

4152
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:21,910
Take us to a better...

4153
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:22,950
Are you serious?

4154
02:39:23,730 --> 02:39:24,830
No, it's still going.

4155
02:39:26,250 --> 02:39:27,670
Yeah, it's still going.

4156
02:39:32,590 --> 02:39:34,110
I'm following the eye.

4157
02:39:34,490 --> 02:39:35,930
I'm gonna TP to you again.

4158
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:36,810
Okay.

4159
02:39:39,150 --> 02:39:40,330
I hate this seed.

4160
02:39:40,470 --> 02:39:41,750
I wanna burn everything down.

4161
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:43,910
I hate this seed so much.

4162
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:45,590
I wanna...

4163
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:46,930
I hate this seed.

4164
02:39:46,930 --> 02:39:48,570
Oh, it's right here.

4165
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:50,810
Wait.

4166
02:39:51,250 --> 02:39:52,510
No, it's right here.

4167
02:39:53,030 --> 02:39:53,990
Oh, nevermind.

4168
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:54,190
It's still going.

4169
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:55,050
It's right here.

4170
02:39:56,850 --> 02:39:57,790
It's right here.

4171
02:39:57,830 --> 02:39:58,530
Just keep going.

4172
02:39:58,670 --> 02:40:00,290
I wanna know what a good seed...

4173
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:02,370
What a good stronghold actually looks like.

4174
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:03,830
I wanna know.

4175
02:40:05,630 --> 02:40:06,590
We're going.

4176
02:40:08,830 --> 02:40:09,730
We're going.

4177
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:11,930
We just wanna know.

4178
02:40:12,370 --> 02:40:13,030
What's it called?

4179
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:15,030
What's the...

4180
02:40:15,710 --> 02:40:16,350
What's what called?

4181
02:40:18,670 --> 02:40:19,110
Slash...

4182
02:40:19,550 --> 02:40:20,590
Slash...

4183
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:22,510
Locate...

4184
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:25,110
Structure...

4185
02:40:26,470 --> 02:40:27,350
Minecraft...

4186
02:40:27,350 --> 02:40:28,670
15...

4187
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:31,050
1506 blocks away.

4188
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:34,250
150...

4189
02:40:35,250 --> 02:40:36,130
150...

4190
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:36,810
You can...

4191
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:39,330
You're just gonna burn the forest down.

4192
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:40,490
Yeah, I'm burning everything.

4193
02:40:40,490 --> 02:40:42,310
You're just gonna...

4194
02:40:42,310 --> 02:40:43,750
I'm gonna go in the cave.

4195
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:46,970
I'm just going... I'm going spectator mode.

4196
02:40:47,090 --> 02:40:48,270
I'm fucking...

4197
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:50,770
I can't change my mode, so I'm stuck in creative.

4198
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:51,450
Okay.

4199
02:40:52,110 --> 02:40:52,810
It's fine.

4200
02:40:54,250 --> 02:40:55,530
Where is this hellhole?

4201
02:40:56,170 --> 02:40:57,590
Where is the second hellhole?

4202
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:02,970
Burn.

4203
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:03,650
Burn.

4204
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:06,490
Minna's burning it all down.

4205
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:09,890
She's burning it all down.

4206
02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:13,110
Burninating the piggies.

4207
02:41:14,110 --> 02:41:17,210
Burninating everything in sight.

4208
02:41:18,090 --> 02:41:19,430
And all the cottages.

4209
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:23,010
Little cottages.

4210
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:25,090
It didn't load.

4211
02:41:26,770 --> 02:41:28,190
What didn't load?

4212
02:41:28,430 --> 02:41:29,390
The stronghold.

4213
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:33,190
Oh, look, another trout.

4214
02:41:33,530 --> 02:41:35,070
Oh, we broke it.

4215
02:41:36,130 --> 02:41:37,830
Oh, game mode.

4216
02:41:40,470 --> 02:41:40,830
Creative.

4217
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:44,370
Wait, teleport me to you.

4218
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:45,230
How do I... Wait.

4219
02:41:45,650 --> 02:41:46,930
How do I teleport to you?

4220
02:41:47,230 --> 02:41:48,010
Wait, no, no, not yet.

4221
02:41:48,070 --> 02:41:48,350
Don't yet.

4222
02:41:48,410 --> 02:41:48,870
Don't do it yet.

4223
02:41:48,910 --> 02:41:49,390
Don't do it yet.

4224
02:41:49,450 --> 02:41:50,410
I fucking broke it.

4225
02:41:50,970 --> 02:41:52,050
What do you mean you broke it?

4226
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:52,750
What did you break?

4227
02:41:53,550 --> 02:41:55,550
I teleported somewhere, but it's not working.

4228
02:41:56,290 --> 02:41:56,590
Uh-oh.

4229
02:41:57,490 --> 02:41:58,210
Okay, proceed.

4230
02:41:58,450 --> 02:41:58,850
I'm leaving.

4231
02:41:58,990 --> 02:41:59,310
I'm leaving.

4232
02:41:59,430 --> 02:41:59,730
I'm leaving.

4233
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:00,770
Where am I?

4234
02:42:01,390 --> 02:42:02,170
Where am I?

4235
02:42:02,910 --> 02:42:03,610
Game mode.

4236
02:42:04,190 --> 02:42:04,970
Wait, wait, wait.

4237
02:42:05,090 --> 02:42:06,350
I'm trying to find it.

4238
02:42:06,410 --> 02:42:08,130
I'm trying to find the other stronghold.

4239
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:09,570
Where is it?

4240
02:42:10,590 --> 02:42:11,890
It literally gave you the coordinates.

4241
02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:12,750
Just click it.

4242
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:15,770
It took me to some...

4243
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:17,310
It fucked up.

4244
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:18,910
What?

4245
02:42:19,710 --> 02:42:20,830
Like here?

4246
02:42:21,710 --> 02:42:23,570
Is this the same area?

4247
02:42:24,330 --> 02:42:24,650
No.

4248
02:42:25,310 --> 02:42:26,910
Oh, my God.

4249
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:29,130
It took us to...

4250
02:42:29,130 --> 02:42:29,930
There's the trials.

4251
02:42:30,610 --> 02:42:32,990
This is...

4252
02:42:32,990 --> 02:42:33,790
No way.

4253
02:42:33,790 --> 02:42:35,950
No way.

4254
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:37,810
No way.

4255
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:39,770
There's...

4256
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:41,750
There's...

4257
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:42,810
No way.

4258
02:42:43,010 --> 02:42:46,730
This stronghold had another trial.

4259
02:42:47,690 --> 02:42:47,970
Teleport me.

4260
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:48,850
Teleport me.

4261
02:42:50,450 --> 02:42:51,650
Teleport me.

4262
02:42:51,650 --> 02:42:52,070
Teleport me.

4263
02:42:52,370 --> 02:42:52,790
Okay.

4264
02:42:53,450 --> 02:42:55,490
No fucking way.

4265
02:42:56,370 --> 02:42:57,750
Are you serious?

4266
02:42:58,170 --> 02:42:59,890
Put me in spectator mode.

4267
02:43:00,110 --> 02:43:01,270
Okay, and then...

4268
02:43:01,270 --> 02:43:02,350
Game mode.

4269
02:43:03,350 --> 02:43:03,790
Spectator.

4270
02:43:04,270 --> 02:43:04,910
Look down.

4271
02:43:05,810 --> 02:43:06,610
Oh, wait.

4272
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:07,730
Did you...

4273
02:43:07,730 --> 02:43:08,270
Oh, no.

4274
02:43:08,470 --> 02:43:08,810
I forgot.

4275
02:43:08,990 --> 02:43:10,490
I forgot the server.

4276
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:13,180
We can go back in.

4277
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:13,840
We can go back in.

4278
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:16,460
I'm waiting for the server to come back.

4279
02:43:16,860 --> 02:43:17,640
I'm leaving.

4280
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:20,820
I can't believe it.

4281
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:22,880
This other stronghold.

4282
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:23,320
I'm in.

4283
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:23,740
I'm in.

4284
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:24,160
I'm in.

4285
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:27,120
The other stronghold had...

4286
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,420
Oh, my God.

4287
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:30,920
Wait, where are we?

4288
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:31,820
Okay, okay.

4289
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:33,980
I'm gonna locate.

4290
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:37,100
Locate structure...

4291
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:38,400
Stronghold.

4292
02:43:38,940 --> 02:43:41,380
The other...

4293
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:43,840
The other one...

4294
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,220
Had one, too.

4295
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:48,680
Are you sure it's not the same one?

4296
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:49,220
No.

4297
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:50,240
No, it's not.

4298
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:51,400
I know it's not.

4299
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,060
I know it's not.

4300
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:54,300
Oh, yeah.

4301
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,420
I'm already in spectator.

4302
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:58,840
Okay, wait.

4303
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:00,700
I know it's not.

4304
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:01,740
That's the thing.

4305
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:04,940
I know it's not.

4306
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:05,180
Oh, wait.

4307
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:06,620
I'm not in spectator anymore.

4308
02:44:07,060 --> 02:44:07,780
Teleport me.

4309
02:44:08,060 --> 02:44:08,860
Give me a sec.

4310
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:10,740
I'm trying to head to the...

4311
02:44:10,740 --> 02:44:11,920
Okay, it's like...

4312
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:15,200
Game mode spec.

4313
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:17,600
I need to go as spectator to find this again.

4314
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:20,180
Okay, I found.

4315
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:22,360
Okay, so...

4316
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:23,220
Oh, my God.

4317
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:24,560
There's no way.

4318
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:28,160
It's literally...

4319
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:28,720
It's literally...

4320
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:29,640
It's not there.

4321
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:31,560
Oh, my God.

4322
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:33,100
I am wide awake now.

4323
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:34,780
I don't know how I'm gonna get to sleep.

4324
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:40,640
It's a different stronghold.

4325
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:42,720
It's a different one.

4326
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:44,480
It's a different one.

4327
02:44:44,980 --> 02:44:45,360
Okay.

4328
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:47,900
Game mode...

4329
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:50,120
Creative...

4330
02:44:50,120 --> 02:44:51,380
Okay, wait.

4331
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:51,620
Sorry.

4332
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:52,960
Game mode, not creative.

4333
02:44:54,420 --> 02:44:55,020
Spectator.

4334
02:44:56,300 --> 02:44:57,180
Go down.

4335
02:44:57,340 --> 02:44:57,800
Look down.

4336
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:58,540
Go down?

4337
02:44:58,720 --> 02:44:59,180
Look down.

4338
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:03,140
Oh, my God.

4339
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:05,060
We have to go through...

4340
02:45:05,060 --> 02:45:07,480
We have to go through the trials.

4341
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:09,780
We have to dig through the trials.

4342
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:13,520
To get to the stronghold.

4343
02:45:15,940 --> 02:45:17,800
Oh, my God.

4344
02:45:18,100 --> 02:45:19,320
It is a different one.

4345
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:21,440
This is not the same one.

4346
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:23,100
This is not the same one.

4347
02:45:23,100 --> 02:45:24,480
This is not the same one.

4348
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:27,320
The stronghold is below.

4349
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:29,420
The fucking trials.

4350
02:45:32,480 --> 02:45:35,220
They're like, you will do the trials.

4351
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:37,800
No matter where you go.

4352
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:40,480
You will do these trials.

4353
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:43,080
You won't get away.

4354
02:45:43,900 --> 02:45:45,400
Oh, my God.

4355
02:45:45,900 --> 02:45:47,500
You will never leave.

4356
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:49,380
This is the...

4357
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:50,780
This is the...

4358
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:53,360
Did you find the eye?

4359
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:54,700
Where is it?

4360
02:45:54,780 --> 02:45:56,360
Where even is the eye?

4361
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:57,840
Wait, is it below?

4362
02:45:58,100 --> 02:45:58,460
Oh, yeah.

4363
02:45:58,560 --> 02:45:59,060
It's below.

4364
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:01,060
Where even is it?

4365
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:03,940
The eye is...

4366
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:06,820
Wait, that's just a...

4367
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:08,760
Where even is the eye?

4368
02:46:09,180 --> 02:46:10,900
I can't even tell.

4369
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:12,420
Where is the eye?

4370
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:14,220
I found the bookshelf.

4371
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:16,120
I found...

4372
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:17,940
Where is it?

4373
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:19,240
Where is it?

4374
02:46:20,140 --> 02:46:20,920
Where is it?

4375
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:31,760
There's no portal.

4376
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:34,540
There's no portal room.

4377
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:36,220
There's no way.

4378
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:38,720
I think this is supposed to be the portal room.

4379
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:40,220
And it's just a random...

4380
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:41,920
Wait, what?

4381
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:43,560
It's just a random...

4382
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:45,480
It's just like a random...

4383
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:46,740
It's like a random...

4384
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:49,440
I think this is supposed to be the portal room.

4385
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:01,540
I got eaten by a geode.

4386
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,920
Oh, my God.

4387
02:47:05,100 --> 02:47:05,900
No, there's...

4388
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:06,620
Wait, there has to be...

4389
02:47:06,620 --> 02:47:08,380
Maybe we passed it.

4390
02:47:08,380 --> 02:47:10,740
Oh, I found it!

4391
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:11,600
I found it!

4392
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:12,860
Oh, my God.

4393
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:14,920
It also has no eyes in it though.

4394
02:47:15,060 --> 02:47:15,940
Okay, I found it.

4395
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:17,200
Oh, my God.

4396
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:19,940
Oh, my God.

4397
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:21,940
There's no way.

4398
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:24,060
Oh, my God.

4399
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:26,860
That would have been absolute cinema.

4400
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,300
Right there.

4401
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,280
Oh, my God.

4402
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:36,920
I wish...

4403
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:41,120
I wish the amethyst did eat the fucking portal room.

4404
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:41,940
I wish the amethyst did eat the fucking portal room.

4405
02:47:41,940 --> 02:47:43,040
Why is there no eyes?

4406
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:44,280
Why is there no eyes?

4407
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:45,720
It also has no eyes, yeah.

4408
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:48,620
Oh, my God.

4409
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:49,760
Wait, where did it go?

4410
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:51,840
I found it and I lost it.

4411
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:53,140
It's so easy to lose.

4412
02:47:53,420 --> 02:47:54,660
Oh, my God.

4413
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:57,660
It's so far away.

4414
02:47:58,120 --> 02:47:59,360
It's so far away, right?

4415
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:01,320
It's so far away.

4416
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:02,920
It's like past the trials.

4417
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:06,600
Why is this trial so fucking big?

4418
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:10,080
Lush pile.

4419
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:11,400
This seed.

4420
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:14,920
I hate this seed.

4421
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:16,100
I hate this seed.

4422
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:19,920
This is making the staff so fucking awake.

4423
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:22,420
It feels like someone purposefully made this.

4424
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:24,760
This wasn't randomly generated.

4425
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:29,340
This was the one...

4426
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:30,540
The staff just to make the seed.

4427
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,760
And he's like...

4428
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:35,660
One day, someone is gonna hit that seed.

4429
02:48:36,140 --> 02:48:37,280
One day.

4430
02:48:37,460 --> 02:48:38,360
Oh, my God.

4431
02:48:40,140 --> 02:48:42,800
Wait, what's the nether like for this one too?

4432
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:46,040
No, there's no way it would be that bad, right?

4433
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:48,440
You're going to the nether too?

4434
02:48:48,620 --> 02:48:49,940
No, not nether.

4435
02:48:50,140 --> 02:48:51,460
I meant the eye.

4436
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:54,700
I can't find the eye.

4437
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,160
Hold on, I'm gonna teleport to you.

4438
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:57,360
Okay, yeah.

4439
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,260
Place the eyes in there.

4440
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:01,500
Let's see how bad the spawn is.

4441
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:03,800
Oh, they're the same?

4442
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:04,800
Oh, it doesn't matter.

4443
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:05,640
It was just the seed.

4444
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:08,840
It was just the seed that gave us the fucking terrible...

4445
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:10,100
Alright, it didn't matter.

4446
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:11,740
It didn't fucking matter.

4447
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:15,580
Apparently, it's the same spawn.

4448
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:17,000
It's the same end spawn.

4449
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:19,380
It wouldn't matter.

4450
02:49:19,700 --> 02:49:20,500
It's just the seed.

4451
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:21,940
It's based off of all the seed.

4452
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:22,840
Wow.

4453
02:49:23,240 --> 02:49:23,900
Wow.

4454
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:24,600
Wow.

4455
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:30,700
It was truly...

4456
02:49:30,700 --> 02:49:32,540
Where did the trials disappear to?

4457
02:49:32,740 --> 02:49:34,280
It's the other side.

4458
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:37,800
It's the opposite side of the fucking portal.

4459
02:49:38,740 --> 02:49:39,280
Oh my god.

4460
02:49:39,320 --> 02:49:40,680
They're not even connected.

4461
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:43,040
What is this stronghold?

4462
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,560
What is this?

4463
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:45,980
What?

4464
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,660
You have to go all the way over...

4465
02:49:49,660 --> 02:49:50,900
All the way here?

4466
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:52,780
For the eye?

4467
02:49:53,360 --> 02:49:54,860
How do you get here?

4468
02:49:55,480 --> 02:49:56,640
What do you mean?

4469
02:49:57,660 --> 02:49:58,180
What do you mean?

4470
02:49:58,180 --> 02:50:00,600
It's not connected properly.

4471
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,780
It's bonkers.

4472
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:07,260
Oh my god.

4473
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:11,060
I don't even know how you get to this.

4474
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:11,640
What?

4475
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:14,920
It's not connected with the portal area.

4476
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:15,440
Yep.

4477
02:50:15,440 --> 02:50:15,660
Yeah.

4478
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:19,300
Okay, you go down here.

4479
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:20,800
And then you're in a dead end.

4480
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:22,440
You just got a mine.

4481
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:27,340
You have to know what walls to knock down.

4482
02:50:27,780 --> 02:50:30,820
You got a fucking mine to the portal.

4483
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:37,380
It's amazing we got this far.

4484
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:39,100
It's actually amazing.

4485
02:50:39,100 --> 02:50:41,360
It's actually amazing that we got this far.

4486
02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:43,360
It's amazing we didn't make it.

4487
02:50:43,360 --> 02:50:46,240
We were never meant to make it to the stronghold.

4488
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:47,940
Yeah, we were.

4489
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:49,640
We were never meant to.

4490
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:51,140
GGs, Mint.

4491
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:53,080
GGs, Doki.

4492
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:57,100
I'm glad we stuck it out just to see this hellhole now.

4493
02:50:57,440 --> 02:50:57,960
I know.

4494
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:01,240
You know what?

4495
02:51:01,580 --> 02:51:06,340
Maybe dying right before seeing that atrocity just brought inner peace to me.

4496
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:17,700
I think if we rested and tried this tomorrow, we would have been even more angry.

4497
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:18,840
I know.

4498
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:25,760
We would have realized we were well-rested just to find out it was always against us.

4499
02:51:25,860 --> 02:51:30,200
We were never meant to beat the sea.

4500
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:38,920
With how far away the stronghold was still from where I died, I think it would have taken us another hour or so to find it.

4501
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:39,860
At least.

4502
02:51:40,300 --> 02:51:41,980
Oh my god.

4503
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:47,800
The drown with the trident was just like, I'm saving you.

4504
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:49,320
Don't keep going.

4505
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,160
Don't do it.

4506
02:51:52,620 --> 02:51:54,160
I'm putting you out of your misery.

4507
02:51:54,940 --> 02:51:55,660
It's over.

4508
02:51:55,820 --> 02:51:56,520
Turn back.

4509
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:57,340
Turn back.

4510
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,720
Oh my god.

4511
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:09,880
Thank you everybody for going on this journey with us.

4512
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:10,660
Wild adventure.

4513
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:12,660
I can't wait to do this again.

4514
02:52:13,460 --> 02:52:16,840
The sun is literally up so I'm going to go attempt some sleep for a couple hours.

4515
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:17,780
Me too.

4516
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:20,740
I have dance lessons later.

4517
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:22,320
Oh my god.

4518
02:52:24,740 --> 02:52:25,940
GG everybody.

4519
02:52:26,080 --> 02:52:26,920
GG everyone.

4520
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:28,620
We're both going to head to bed now.

4521
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:30,200
I'll talk to you later.

4522
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:31,700
Go sleep.

4523
02:52:32,180 --> 02:52:34,400
Remember to check out our tickets by the way.

4524
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:36,580
Check out our concert tickets.

4525
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,020
That will be sold out.

4526
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:39,560
We'll play Minecraft in 3D.

4527
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:42,520
We'll do the seed in 3D.

4528
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:46,640
We'll do the seed again in 3D.

4529
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:50,220
We have the seed numbers anyway.

4530
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:57,620
If we sell out the concert we'll do this exact seed in 3D.

4531
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:00,300
GG everybody.

4532
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:01,240
Bye bye.

4533
02:53:02,220 --> 02:53:03,580
Bye bye.

4534
02:53:03,620 --> 02:53:05,440
Can I send you this real quick?

4535
02:53:05,900 --> 02:53:06,540
Hold on.

4536
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:08,040
Look at this tweet.

4537
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:22,120
Oh my god.

4538
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:26,020
I just saw your tweet.

4539
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:37,940
I hate the seed so much.

4540
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:45,140
There were so many struggles.

4541
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:48,260
There were so many things to us.

4542
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:48,980
How?

4543
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:57,070
Oh my god.

4544
02:53:57,070 --> 02:53:58,370
I'm leaving.

4545
02:53:58,650 --> 02:53:59,430
I'm done.

4546
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:02,810
I'm fucking done.

4547
02:54:02,830 --> 02:54:03,430
Bye.

4548
02:54:04,970 --> 02:54:06,290
Goodnight everybody.

4549
02:54:06,890 --> 02:54:07,990
Or good morning.

4550
02:54:09,010 --> 02:54:09,670
Bye.

4551
02:54:10,860 --> 02:54:11,730
Bye bye.

4552
02:54:14,150 --> 02:54:15,330
Oh my god.

4553
02:54:15,570 --> 02:54:17,370
I'll see you guys later everybody.

4554
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:22,270
As always stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and around to get that blood flow.

4555
02:54:22,650 --> 02:54:25,970
If you stayed up for me I'd defend because you deserve it.

4556
02:54:25,970 --> 02:54:26,770
Oh my god.

4557
02:54:26,830 --> 02:54:29,970
For those who wondered what I saw.

4558
02:54:31,050 --> 02:54:33,930
This is what we saw.

4559
02:54:35,630 --> 02:54:37,110
Oh my god.

4560
02:54:37,230 --> 02:54:38,990
I'll show this image again.

4561
02:54:41,130 --> 02:54:43,590
This is our pathway to the stronghold.

4562
02:54:44,070 --> 02:54:45,270
We miss everything.

4563
02:54:48,310 --> 02:54:51,890
I managed to miss every single stronghold.

4564
02:54:52,270 --> 02:54:53,970
I don't know.

4565
02:54:59,150 --> 02:55:00,150
Anyway.

4566
02:55:00,650 --> 02:55:03,090
I'll see you guys later everybody.

4567
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:03,930
Bye.

4568
02:55:04,410 --> 02:55:04,690
Oh my god.

4569
02:55:05,270 --> 02:55:09,110
I'm so tired.
