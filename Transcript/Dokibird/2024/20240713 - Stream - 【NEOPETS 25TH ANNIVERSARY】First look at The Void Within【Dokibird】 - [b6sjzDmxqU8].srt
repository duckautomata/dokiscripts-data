00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Welcome!

3
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous right now because I'm sponsored by Neofence!

4
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,360
Oh my god!

5
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Hello everybody!

6
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm so nervous right now because I'm literally being sponsored by basically one of my childhood websites.

7
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:03,260
And it is an honor that Neopets chose me to do this.

8
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,460
So I'm super nervous.

9
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:20,100
There's not really a script going... you know how like sponsored streams, there's like a script going in where you're like, okay, you gotta read these points.

10
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,680
Make sure you read this.

11
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,680
Make sure you say this.

12
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,580
There's really not much of that.

13
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,300
The...

14
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,240
Basically, like what they told me was that, alright, we want you to showcase this.

15
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,480
The new plot, the void within.

16
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,180
And then you can do whatever you want.

17
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,460
And I was like, sweet, okay.

18
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm just...

19
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,060
Also, you know how like I...

20
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,960
Like I said, huge shoutout, a huge thank you to Neopets for reaching out.

21
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,660
And they reached out to me.

22
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,160
You may have noticed a couple months earlier.

23
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,840
They actually...

24
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:12,280
Actually, they sent me a care package and everything that was like Neopets related to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

25
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,660
And then later on they were like, you know what, we want to sponsor you.

26
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
And I was like, me?

27
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,400
Oh my god!

28
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,320
Also, I'm sorry, Dragoon4938120.

29
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,120
I sort of let you start for two months now.

30
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,700
So I'm really sorry.

31
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,080
But like, I know you don't die.

32
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,320
And if you get sad, you'll just turn into a gray pet.

33
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,460
And then gray pets equals like money up.

34
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,760
So like, the sadder you get, the more value you have as a Neopet.

35
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,440
So like, it's okay if you're starving.

36
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,620
Anyway!

37
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,680
Anyway, they reached out to me to ask if I could check out the Void Within with all of them.

38
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:09,060
And for those of you guys who don't know what the Void Within is, is basically, in the past, they used to do these big plots and everything.

39
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,600
Where it progresses the lore and story of Neopets.

40
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,640
I remember following plot lines all the way from the Miradell line.

41
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,500
So like, back then, when the discovery of Brightvale.

42
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,000
That was like, I think that for me was like the earliest plot line.

43
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,680
That was like, I think that for me was like the earliest plot line.

44
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,320
Like, plot they've done when I was on Neopets.

45
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,980
All the way, I think like, I remember all the way to the Altador Cup.

46
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,120
Or like, not Altador, just like the Altador plot line.

47
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,220
Um, so apparently the Void Within has been...

48
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,740
Has been the newest plot that they've established.

49
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:57,100
And it's a really big thing because it's been a very, very, very long time since they've done a plot for Neopets to progress the lore.

50
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,760
If you guys didn't know, Neopets lore is actually crazy.

51
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,240
It's not just like, like there's romance.

52
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,680
There's, there's actual people, Neopets die.

53
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,360
In, in their stories.

54
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,600
It's, it's crazy.

55
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,480
There's actual, like there's death.

56
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,720
There's romance.

57
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
There's the lost city of Atlantis.

58
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,080
But like in Neopets' term is like murder.

59
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,000
There's like, like you go to, like Morocco or whatever.

60
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,660
And there's Tare Island.

61
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,900
And everything.

62
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,800
There's violence!

63
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,680
It's actually insane!

64
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,100
There's like, but like you don't really see that going.

65
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,180
Yeah they apparently have been teasing this lore, this plot since last year.

66
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,040
Um, so it's like a lot goes into like the Neopets lore for those who don't know.

67
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,100
I used to follow along to it as, as a little bird.

68
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,620
So it's, haha!

69
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,140
I'm really thankful for Neopets for sponsoring me.

70
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,880
And like, I'm gonna... they like, you know, they're like, okay, you can do like 30 minutes max.

71
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,620
I was like, it's okay.

72
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,460
I'm definitely gonna stream over time.

73
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,120
Because not only do I want to explore the plot of Neopets, but I also want to go through like nostalgia.

74
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,120
And then go through, go through like my memories and everything.

75
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,240
And just like re-enjoy Neopets again.

76
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,220
But it's like a little time capsule.

77
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
It's actually crazy.

78
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,660
You might see like this front page might look like very... you know, like this front page might look like...

79
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,600
Oh, this looks new.

80
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,420
When I... when I got it, I was like, what is this?

81
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
And then I like swapped to here.

82
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,880
And I was like, oh my god, that's the page I remember.

83
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
And it's like the news feature.

84
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,820
I saw the news feature.

85
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,900
I was like, oh my god.

86
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,100
It's like 2010 all over.

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,220
Oh my god.

88
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,220
It's like 2010 all over.

89
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,540
Again.

90
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,420
It's...

91
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,500
I was like, oh my god.

92
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,980
You're also dying right now, but it's okay.

93
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,040
It's like fake die.

94
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
You're not actually dying, guys.

95
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,060
It's okay.

96
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,900
Oh my god.

97
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,380
It's like a time capsule.

98
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,040
There's like so many memories just like flooding back in.

99
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,920
Also, it was so funny when we were discussing about this.

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,660
Like when my team was discussing with Neopets, they were like, I talked about this before.

101
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

102
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

103
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

104
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

105
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

106
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

107
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

108
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I just...

109
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,220
I just talked about this in Prechat.

110
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
It was so funny.

111
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,520
They were like, oh yeah, like, what's like...

112
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,640
Like... like...

113
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,820
What're your like... demographics?

114
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,120
And then like we gave them a demographic .

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,840
So like it was like... I think like it was like 80% male fans and then like 20% female fans.

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:46,080
And then they were like, oh we're a little worried, because Neopets is predominantly with female, like female fans.

117
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,640
And then I was like, do not worry.

118
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,580
Whatever.

119
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,440
Whatever I like, my dragoons will like too.

120
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,700
Do not worry.

121
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,030
I was like, no, do not worry.

122
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,870
They will love Neopets.

123
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,690
I love Neopets.

124
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,130
They will love Neopets.

125
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,350
Also, they gave me a link regarding...

126
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:29,790
So if you do have a Neopets account, feel free to join the 150k Neocash giveaway.

That referral link was just for me.

129
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,510
They didn't even give me that referral link.

130
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,550
I made that for myself.

131
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,850
I was like...

132
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,270
They didn't even ask that of me.

133
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,630
I just want you guys to join Neopets.

134
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,410

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,450
So please, check out the description box.

146
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:48,990
The guy bought the Neopets company and it created its own company just for Neopets.

147
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,150
And I thought that was so passionate because they were like...

148
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:00,950
Yes, a fan like reacquired the IP because they were like, I had so many good memories playing Neopets.

149
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:14,130
And they were like, I really want to bring back the same memories, bring back old fans, bring in new fans and enjoy Neopets like I did when I was younger.

150
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,510
And I was like, what the fuck?

151
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:29,290
I was like, oh my god, the passion for that, to do that and creating its own company just to focus on Neopets as well.

152
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:38,950
But yes, for those who don't know, Neopets started off as a website for college students and then later on...

153
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,830
as it got bigger and bigger, obviously, like it geared towards more of like the children demographics.

154
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:51,830
And then... but like, you know, adults... it like taught... taught me so much regarding like...

155
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,110
regarding like, I don't know, like the internet.

156
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,930
Like Neopets taught me a lot about like internet stuff.

157
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,870
I learned how to roleplay from Neopets.

158
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,210
Oh my god!

159
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,970
Oh my god!

160
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,610
I was like looking through my old accounts and I actually...

161
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,630
I'm sorry, I know I should be like progressing like...

162
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,590
But like, I need to go through like nostalgia with you guys.

163
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,190
But like, yes, it taught me like interest rates, it taught...

164
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,250
Also, thank you guys so much for the memberships and the super chats.

165
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,570
It taught me... it taught me like the stock market.

166
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,950
It taught me about interest rates from banks.

167
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:44,030
How many times have I said this?

168
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,190
I was looking through my old accounts.

169
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,390
Because I remember my old account names.

170
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,370
And then I forgot I created the code.

171
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,030
Because it teaches you how to code.

172
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,950
It teaches you how to code.

173
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,850
And everything.

174
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,790
It teaches you how to gamble.

175
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,730
Because there were horse races.

176
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,450
I forgot.

177
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,510
They were called snail races.

178
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:21,170
But like there was like a snail race track where you have to gamble money and talk to you about restocking It's I have but like like um What's it called scalping?

179
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,350
You can become a scalper

180
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:56,770
There's like an auction it posed and everything Um, but like oh my gosh need to show you guys this cuz like I found my old accounts and I forgot I used to create like websites and stuff cuz like on your pets a page You can create your own like website via Neopets and like learn how to code and everything and then like I was looking through and I forgot I used to like I I

181
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:24,580
I I I I found my old fan art of the Altador My old... oh my god I was there for the very first Altador Cup and I found my old fan art I was like how about this?

182
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,060
Um, by the way, I rep... I was there.

183
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,920
I was an OG Haunted Woods I was on the OG Haunted Woods team.

184
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,540
I never left and we won first place We were...

185
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,100
We were the champions at the very first Altador Cup.

186
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:54,960
I was there I don't have my main account anymore because I told you guys the story got hacked, but I was there I was in...

187
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:03,380
For those who don't know what the Altador Cup was It was like basically like the Neopets Olympics and like I was there on ground zero.

188
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:29,060
I was the OG OG Haunted Woods team The very first champions and then so like I found this and I remember I like redrew it for like the second year and I improved it so much like I was like, oh my god This is like a year later for like the second season and I like redrew and everything and I was like,

189
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,820
holy shit I remember as a kid.

190
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,940
I was like, oh my god I improved so much!

191
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,820
I was like...

192
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,420
And then...

193
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:54,800
And then I found like all my old art and everything I was like, there's like the Robot Aisha's and then like the cookie side bunnies and everything I found so much of my old art!

194
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,180
I was like, holy shit!

195
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,900
That was like I told you guys I was obsessed I was obsessed with Neopets and then now I'm gonna...

196
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm gonna be obsessed with Neopets again Um...

197
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,380
Like Neopets made me draw more in...

198
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
In general and like...

199
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,160
I like kickstarted so much like of my like passion for certain things on the internet.

200
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,940
So I'm like really happy I'm just really happy to be able to be sponsored by them and to like do stuff with them.

201
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,920
Um...

202
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,340
As...

203
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,260
Also if you guys didn't notice the reference...

204
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,880
Uh...

205
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,940
The intro...

206
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,480
The intro music if you guys could hear the...

207
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,260
Uh...

208
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,380
The intro music for...

209
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,180
Uh...

210
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,060
The...

211
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,920
Uh...

212
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,020
For the intro...

213
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,340
It was from the Darkest Fairy.

214
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,720
I literally pulled up the Darkest Fairy soundtrack because that...

215
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,860
That game...

216
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,400
Um...

217
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,840
That game was like one of my favorite games on the PS2.

218
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,620
I was...

219
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,660
I was so obsessed with that game.

220
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,780
And I only...

221
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,740
I told this story before.

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,820
But like I only stopped playing the Darkest Fairy because...

223
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,280
Um...

224
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,160
Because it went to a stealth mission.

225
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,700
And I was a very stupid child.

226
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,920
So that I didn't understand it was supposed to be a stealth mission.

227
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Where you're supposed to stealth back into the castle.

228
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,940
So I like spent days trying to figure out how to progress.

229
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,980
And like...

230
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,800
Walk around.

231
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,260
Because I didn't read much.

232
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,600
I just like went with the flow of things.

233
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,920
And I didn't realize they wanted me to stealth inside.

234
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,180
And then like...

235
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,040
Because I couldn't...

236
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,780
Um...

237
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,880
I couldn't stealth inside.

238
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,820
I just gave up.

239
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,200
I never finished the game.

240
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,520
I never...

241
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,240
I never progressed.

242
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,600
And that was like back in the time when like...

243
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,860
Internet forums like didn't really like exist for like the Darkest Fairy.

244
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,980
So like...

245
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,540
Um...

246
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,080
Every...

247
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,720
Like every time I went to like EB Games.

248
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,480
Which is like the American version of GameStop.

249
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,100
Um...

250
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,140
I would be like...

251
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,160
Is there a strategy guide for the Darkest Fairy?

252
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,600
Like I would...

253
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,940
I would ask the...

254
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,480
I would...

255
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,560
I did not use like the Internet to look for like how...

256
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,120
Like tutorials.

257
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,720
I would like go to EB Games.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
And then like up to the shop.

259
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,380
I would be like...

260
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,000
Is there...

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,420
Is there a strategy?

262
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,920
Because like all I knew was like strategy guides.

263
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,580
I was like...

264
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,980
Is there a strategy guide for the Darkest Fairy?

265
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,520
And then the shopkeeper would like go behind.

266
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,680
And would look...

267
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,080
I don't know.

268
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,540
I don't know.

269
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,580
Just stand there behind.

270
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,220
Because they didn't want to tell the child that like...

271
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,240
That didn't exist.

272
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,120
I'm pretty sure...

273
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,080
I'm pretty sure the shopkeepers...

274
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,080
Whenever I asked the shopkeepers...

275
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,380
Um...

276
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,200
Like...

277
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,420
Like...

278
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,180
Whenever I asked the shopkeepers...

279
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,740
If like...

280
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,880
If there was a strategy guide.

281
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,200
They knew in their heart it didn't exist.

282
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,840
But they didn't want to tell me straight on.

283
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,860
So they would go behind into the back rooms.

284
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,000
And then like you know...

285
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,640
Pretend...

286
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,420
I'm pretty sure they would pretend to look for it.

287
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,220
And then they would come back and be like...

288
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,600
Oh sorry.

289
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,420
We don't seem...

290
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,500
We don't seem to have it.

291
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll be like...

292
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,860
Okay.

293
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,180
And I would do that like at least once a month for like a couple of...

294
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,760
I don't even know how long I did it for.

295
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,260
Because I really wanted to get past that stupid fucking level.

296
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,740
Because I didn't realize you had the stealth.

297
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,820
I'm just like...

298
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,240
How do I do this?

299
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,020
Why do I keep getting caught?

300
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,820
But I would just be like...

301
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,820
Do you have the strategy guide for the darkest fairy?

302
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh my god.

303
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,680
Anyway.

304
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm...

305
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,720
I'm super duper very excited.

306
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,180
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,380
This was a long tangent.

308
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,160
But like...

309
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,740
I'm very passionate about...

310
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,260
Um...

311
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:06,200
I'm really really passionate about Neopets because it really really kick-started my like my It's like a curse.

312
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:13,340
I guess it could be a little curse, but like it literally kick-started like my rabbit hole into like the internet

313
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:27,420
So I'm just really happy I'm really happy to be able to like go through this with all of you guys Because uh...

314
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,740
He's not going to die!

315
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
My Neopets doesn't die!

316
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:45,120
The more sad they are, the better for my economy Because it gives me a potential To where it will become a rare pet and after it becomes a rare pet his value will go up.

317
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,940
So So it's all strategic

318
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,480
You will become more beautiful The more you starve

319
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:26,100
The more value you have Pateri, I don't know how to actually pronounce a lot of these like Neopets names I never really learned how to pronounce their names and like in my head I'll just call them like I don't know I call him Pateri because like I assume like cuz like there's a P there So like I call him Pateri and then there's like Lupe and oh my favorite Neopets Someone was like,

320
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,160
I wrote this down.

321
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,600
Lupe, Lutari, Zweetok, Drakes, and Pteris.

322
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,560
That is my... that is my... oh, like the Pterodactyl.

323
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,380
Oh, I see.

324
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,120
They're like... it's a reference to the Pterodactyls.

325
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,340
Chias were fucking ugly.

326
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
Nobody can change my mind!

327
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,040
You know... okay, let me tell you the ugliest.

328
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,140
You know what?

329
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,760
I want Chias.

330
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,520
Chub Chubs.

331
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,340
The Chub Chubs were ugly!

332
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,200
Okay?

333
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,200
The Kikos.

334
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,960
Fight me!

335
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,240
I don't care!

336
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,380
They're ugly!

337
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,160
How dare you!

338
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,880
Um... they're the worst.

339
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:06,340
Because when you have the secret... okay, so like in Neopets, there is like a map where like you can grab like the secret lab map.

340
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:13,420
Where you zap your Neopets and get like... you can transform your Neopets into different species and different colors.

341
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,840
And then every time... every time like you know, there's a chance you get a very ugly Neopet.

342
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,720
And like I would be really... you guys wanna know what the Chub Chubs are?

343
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,660
The Chub Chubs is this little thing.

344
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,420
You see this... oh wait, you guys can't see it yet.

345
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,580
Um... wait, can you guys see it?

346
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:29,820
No!

347
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,500
I can't scroll it further enough!

348
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,280
Okay.

349
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,000
It's basically they have giant ass feet.

350
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,420
Okay.

351
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,570
Please, I don't have Chub Chubs.

352
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,190
Chub Chubs have giant ass feet.

353
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,490
And like no arms.

354
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:54,450
They're just a... they're just a ball of fur with like giant feet.

355
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,230
So...

356
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,410
And then... and then the Kikos.

357
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,810
The Kikos was just a giant head with like no feet.

358
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,930
With just arms.

359
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,530
So like I...

360
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,710
I just wasn't a fan.

361
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,090
I just wasn't... wasn't a fan of them.

362
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,230
Um...

363
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,290
Anyway...

364
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,650
Um... anyway, sorry.

365
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,590
I forgot we were supposed to talk about the Void Within.

366
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,730
I'm so sorry.

367
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,910
This was like the main sponsored part.

368
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:24,910
I'm sorry!

369
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,750
I just got really, really passionate.

370
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,190
Um... I got... but like...

371
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,630
Um... so I'm just gonna go briefly over this.

372
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,110
Because a lot of like the newer Neopets players might not know like...

373
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,250
Uh... might not know anything about this.

374
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,490
Like because the plot line...

375
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,510
For those who don't know, this is like the King of Altador.

376
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,530
I remember them.

377
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,690
The King of Altador.

378
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,890
The King of Brightvale.

379
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,530
Um... he's depressed.

380
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,110
Uh... because the whole thing is that there's a curse right now.

381
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,890
There is a curse right now in the land of Neopia.

382
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,930
Um... oh my god.

383
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,170
I can't believe I remember all this.

384
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,670
I can't...

385
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,650
It's been... it's been so many years since I've been on Neopets.

386
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,870
And I can't believe I like remember all of this.

387
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,050
Anyway...

388
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,390
I'm not making this up!

389
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,850
I'm not making this up!

390
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,870
So like the only like...

391
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,250
Um...

392
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,950
So like...

393
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,550
And then...

394
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:22,830
So...

395
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,470
Okay and then this is like the Queen of the Desert Is...

396
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:25,830
The...

397
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,230
What is it?

398
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,390
The Deserts?

399
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,210
Um...

400
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,570
This is the King of the Marokkwans.

401
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,410
I think that's...

402
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,270
I don't know how to pronounce it.

403
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,950
These two were like the King and Queen of like the desert area.

404
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,630
I don't know who this girl is.

405
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,450
This must be a newer girl because I actually don't know who this is.

406
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,290
Um...

407
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,150
But like...

408
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,430
Oh!

409
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,770
They also have...

410
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,130
They also have a parody of Tomb Raider.

411
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,190
And it was like Hannah something.

412
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,190
Um...

413
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,910
They actually...

414
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,350
They had like a parody of Tomb Raider too at one point as like a plot for it.

415
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:53,950
And like...

416
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,770
And she's a squirrel.

417
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:55,410
Uh...

418
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,260
Yeah, it's Hannah.

419
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,360
Um...

420
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,520
Yeah, anyway...

421
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,040
Um...

422
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,020
Sorry, I got...

423
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,900
I got like distracted.

424
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,920
But...

425
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,580
Um...

426
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm gonna go briefly over the Void of Inn.

427
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,180
Um...

428
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,060
Because like...

429
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,780
A lot of the newer players, they're not gonna really understand what is going on.

430
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,940
But the experienced players, you guys know what's up.

431
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,820
Yes, I'm...

432
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,860
You guys better come back to Neopets because of me.

433
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,540
Okay, if they ask you like, why are you back at Neopets?

434
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,440
Just write Doki Bird brought you back.

435
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,060
Okay?

436
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,160
Because like, you know, I gotta...

437
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,720
You know, I gotta make Neopets know that like...

438
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,160
Um...

439
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,940
Even though like, you know...

440
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,000
Like, let the Neopets know like we have a fan base that loves Neopets.

441
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,900
And Doki introduced me...

442
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,260
Reintroduced slash introduced me to Neopets again.

443
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,580
You know, just like potential for more in the future.

444
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,600
You know, guys?

445
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,580
Oh, wouldn't it be crazy if we did a collaboration merch line with Neopets?

446
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,080
Wouldn't that be crazy, guys?

447
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,260
Um...

448
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,160
But they wouldn't know unless we let them know that we have...

449
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,060
We have...

450
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:13,060
We have the fan base to guarantee that.

451
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,020
Oh my gosh.

452
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,940
Anyway...

453
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,800
Anyway...

454
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,660
No jub jubs though.

455
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,660
If we ever did...

456
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,540
If we ever do a merch collaboration, no jub jubs.

457
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,300
I am a full on jub jub hater.

459
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm willing to do any Neopets.

460
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,780
But no jub jubs.

461
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,820
Um...

462
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,500
Uh...

463
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,820
Anyway, how could you hate...

464
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,660
Okay, guys.

465
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm gonna...

466
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,780
For the person...

467
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,620
For the person that was like, how could you hate jub jubs?

468
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,280
Alright, for those who don't know what a jub jub looks like, I will...

469
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,520
There is a...

470
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,020
Alright, let me...

471
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:04,820
Okay.

00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,920
Um...

473
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,880
Oh my god.

474
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,620
I'm just looking at the jub jub.

475
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,060
I'm like...

476
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,840
I'm just like...

477
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,540
Alright, give me a sec.

478
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm saving the jub jub right now.

479
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,660
This is why...

480
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,080
He's just...

481
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,040
Look at him!

482
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,880

484
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,280
Look at him!

485
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,800
Like...

486
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,270
Like...

487
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,470
Just...

488
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,090
What?

489
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,150
He's just feet!

490
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,050
Cute!

491
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,070
Oh my god.

492
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,210
No, he's just a...

493
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,130
He's just...

494
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:44,490
Okay.

495
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,210
He's...

496
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,510
Look at him!

497
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,670
He's cute.

498
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:50,810
Cute.

499
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,770
Doki is a hater.

500
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,630
I'm not...

501
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:53,950
Yes!

502
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,410
I'm a full on jub jub hater!

503
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:56,910
Yes!

504
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,550
That's what I've been saying!

505
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,090
Told you guys!

506
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,150
Cat changed my mind!

507
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,390
I find him to be the ugliest Neopet out there.

508
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,510
Out of all of them.

509
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,710
Um...

510
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,210
It's a...

511
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,470
It's a Furby without nose.

512
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:18,990
They're...

513
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,650
They're very cute.

514
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,290
They're very kickable.

515
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,090
Anyway...

516
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,930
Um...

517
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,070
But yes, I like every Neopet.

518
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,610
Okay, that's not true.

519
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,670
Um...

520
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,230
I don't like every Neopet.

521
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,670
Because like, Kikos are like a good second.

522
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,530
Uh...

523
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,130
A good second for me.

524
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,830
Like, of hate.

525
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,350
Why does he look...

526
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,130
Why does he look like a bald?

527
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,470
Thank you, the super chat.

528
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:43,870
Thank you.

529
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,470
Thank you.

530
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,030
Anyway.

531
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:45,850
So...

532
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,230
Uh...

533
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,470
Like I said, they...

534
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:47,950
So...

535
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,690
The reason...

536
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,870
He's usually not depressed, guys.

537
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:52,950
Um...

538
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,030
I wanna...

539
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,890
Okay, a Kiko.

540
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,750
Okay, I'll show you guys what a Kiko looks like.

541
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,570
Kiko Neopets.

542
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,070
Uh...

543
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,810
I mean, they're also equally...

544
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,910
Okay, so like...

545
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,070
They're just...

546
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,830
They're just like...

547
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,890
They're like JubJubs.

548
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,470
But like, they have arms instead of feet.

549
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,570
Um...

550
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,070
And they look like...

551
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,770
You could like...

552
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,330
Like a pin from Smiling Friends.

553
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,370
Where you can pull like the hair.

554
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,570
Like, I know like this doesn't make sense like what I'm saying right now.

555
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,390
But when you see the picture, you'll be like...

556
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:22,890
Oh...

557
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,590
That's what she means.

558
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,130
But like, this is what a Kiko looks like.

559
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,070
Uh...

560
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,470
This is a JubJub.

561
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,270
And like, you can combine them together.

562
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,390
I guess.

563
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,190
So you can...

564
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,130
Get...

565
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,470
Arms?

566
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,150
I guess?

567
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:37,690
Like...

568
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:42,990
So...

569
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:43,990
So...

570
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,290
This is a Kiko.

571
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,890
And this is a...

572
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,150
Um...

573
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,350
Um...

574
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,270
This is a...

575
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,250
JubJub.

576
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,070
But like...

577
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,210
Why would you have any of this?

578
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,650
When you can clearly have...

579
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,530
The superior uh...

580
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,490
Neopet.

581
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,330
Known as a drake.

582
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,290
Like why would you want any of these guys?

583
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,210
When you can...

584
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:07,450
Oh sorry.

585
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:07,950
I'm trying to save.

586
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,350
I know...

587
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,090
I'm trying to save the picture of a drake right now.

588
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,490
Like...

589
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:12,810
You...

590
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,110
Give me a sec.

591
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,310
It's a little difficult.

592
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,330
Because I keep getting we-bembe- مبむ ...

593
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,910
Sorry for the delay on this.

594
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,110
I'm trying to get a PNG picture.

595
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,250
But you'll understand when you see it!

596
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:39,190
You'll understand and be like, yeah, why the heck would I choose a JubJub or a Kiko when I could get this guy.

597
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,790
Where's a PNG photo?

598
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,610
I'm just trying to get a PNG, guys.

599
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,250
All right, give me a sec.

600
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:48,910
I'm snipping this.

601
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,550
I have to get my snipping tool out because I'm desperate.

602
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,990
I need to show a Drake.

603
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,750
Why?

604
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:01,870
Why would you pick these two when you can get this guy on your team?

605
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,330
By the way, this guy is like super rare.

606
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:14,470
It's like two million dollars, but You can tell why these guys... these two are free.

607
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,530
This guy is like two million dollars, but...

608
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:33,120
You know these guys are... there's a reason why these two are free, but this one costs like money.

609
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,280
Oh, they're only 200k.

610
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,700
Oh, thank god for inflation.

611
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,060
Oh, thank god.

612
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,780
Okay, back in my day.

613
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,860
Um...

614
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:51,360
These guys were like two million NEO points and they would take forever to farm.

615
00:34:51,660 --> 00:35:08,200
Because the only way... the only way you can get these guys, the... the Drake, is you gotta either find a potion to morph your NEO pets or... or you gotta get like, uh... or you gotta hatch an egg.

616
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,900
And... and like I... I only got it once because, um...

617
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,480
One of my friends... one of my friends quit NEO pets and then I begged her to...

618
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:30,510
I... she got like one of the... The... The Drake morphing potion.

619
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:51,510
She got like the mutant... the potion where you can Morph it and then I begged her to give me her NEO to transfer her NEO pets over to me because... because it was like my goal It was like one of my dream goals to own a Drake.

620
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,690
Like I... it was the shittiest name ever.

621
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:01,250
Oh my gosh, you would not understand in the Neopets system, in the... in the...

622
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,730
We're not friends anymore by the way, but at least I got to know him.

623
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,490
It was like so long ago.

624
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,250
But I still got the Drake.

625
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:18,990
Anyway, um... um... it was like one of my... one of my dream goals to own a Drake.

626
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,610
Because it was so difficult to own one.

627
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,690
It was actually... it had the... it had the like shittiest name ever.

628
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:36,250
Because it... in Neopets, there was a system where like, you know, um... there was like a... there's like a trading...

629
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,190
There's like a trading... uh... um... community.

630
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,410
For Neopets and like... they like tier list your Neopets.

631
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,450
So, like, if you... you need to have... if you have like a shitty name for your Neopets...

632
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,210
As then you add numbers to it.

633
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,430
The value of your Neopets is lower.

634
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:02,570
Like, you can get your Neopets valued because you can't change the names of your Neopets.

635
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:09,410
But then some of them are like more well sought after than others because there's like... it's like well named...

636
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,230
There's like well...

637
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,970
Well named unconverted pets.

638
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,530
And unconverted pets are usually pets in the old art style.

639
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,110
And that shit was so rare.

640
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,550
You can get them back now.

641
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,290
The unconverted pets are back now.

642
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,570
But yeah, if your Neopets had numbers, the value of your Neopets drop.

643
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,090
It was such a wild time.

644
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,710
Oh my god.

645
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,010
It was an incredibly wild time back then.

646
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,290
Anyway, also one of my other favorite Neopets was...

647
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,590
Oh my gosh, I need to show you guys.

648
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,190
This is one of my other favorite Neopets.

649
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:57,590
But now that I look back into it, people will be like...

650
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,090
Alright, so these are the ones that I hated.

651
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,170
But this one was like... this is a fan favorite.

652
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,130
Like everybody...

653
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,410
loves this Neopet.

654
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,130
But it was just a wolf.

655
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,030
But like, it's a classic.

656
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,570
It's a cool looking wolf, okay?

657
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,830
Like, it's just a dog.

658
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,730
The Lupe.

659
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,650
The Lupe is like my number one favorite Neopet.

660
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,610
But like, you can't mess up the classics.

661
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,530
It's simple is good.

662
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,210
He's a dog.

663
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,630
I like dogs.

664
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,710
So...

665
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,410
So like...

666
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,790
And Lupe...

667
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,850
The Lupe's had like the best designs.

668
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,710
Like the best... like the best paint brushes.

669
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,030
The best... okay, the unconverted ones.

670
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,410
I don't like the... okay, Lupe...

671
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,810
Okay, Lupe Royal Brush.

672
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,930
So like you can paint your pets and everything.

673
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,130
And okay, I think it was like... the plush one was like one of my favorite.

674
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,370
It was either the plushy Lupe...

675
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,070
Oh no, the baby!

676
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,110
The baby Lupe was so cute!

677
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,590
Okay, that was like one of my goals.

678
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:11,550
Anyway, it's because they literally had the best designs when it came to like paint brushes.

679
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,810
And you're like, what the... what is... what is Joki talking about?

680
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,130
Like...

681
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:22,050
But you can like... you can pay lots and lots of money and like make it a fucking baby.

682
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,810
And it was so cute.

683
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,790
And I was like, okay, yeah, the royal ones were also really cute too.

684
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,710
So you could make it a... a baby... like a puppy.

685
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,470
And I was like, oh my god, the colors.

686
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,630
Um...

687
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,810
The colors were so cute and everything.

688
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,550
I heard the paintbrush economy finally has... has fallen.

689
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,410
So thank god.

690
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:41,890
Like...

691
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,650
I'm so happy.

692
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,830
I'm so happy inflation existed, yo pets.

693
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,290
Oh, thank god.

694
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,510
Cause... um...

695
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:58,250
Cause like saving up for these things was like... was so hard to save up for.

696
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,910
Especially when you're a child and you didn't...

697
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,250
Cause like it was basically...

698
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,330
It was basically a monopoly for all the adults.

699
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,630
So the adults usually had like... were the richest people in Neopets.

700
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,990
Because they actually knew how to min-max Neopets.

701
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,690
So all the children were always sad and begging for stuff.

702
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,570
Because we were like the peasants in the kingdom of adults.

703
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,850
I remember we would be like...

704
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,130
We would be like...

705
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,050
Please...

706
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,270
Can anyone...

707
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,070
Can anyone please give me a paintbrush?

708
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,890
I'm poor.

709
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,670
Like we...

710
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,290
We were like freeloaders.

711
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,230
Cause we couldn't...

712
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,610
We didn't really understand.

713
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:43,790
Um...

714
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,870
And as I got older, I started to understand the ruthless...

715
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,250
The ruthless business of Neopets.

716
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,010
So I started to get rich.

717
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,210
And then I got so rich that actually...

718
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:54,890
I...

719
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,290
I got hacked one day.

720
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,190
It was like...

721
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,170
I was so sad.

722
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,070
But like...

723
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,650
Um...

724
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,610
But it was just...

725
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:01,990
I was...

726
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,430
I think I was just really stupid.

727
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,050
Because I think I visited a bad website.

728
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,050
And then they took my...

729
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,930
That was just there to like...

730
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,290
Take Neopets accounts.

731
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,650
It was so long ago.

732
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,250
It was like my main account too.

733
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,370
But like...

734
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,050
Um...

735
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,990
I still love Neopets though.

736
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,830
I still had like four other accounts.

737
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,950
I still had...

738
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,550
I still had four other...

739
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,710
I still had like four other...

740
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,910
Side accounts.

741
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,570
That was filled with like secret labs.

742
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,750
And like everything.

743
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,850
But you know...

744
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,910
When you lose your main account.

745
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,650
That's like...

746
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,050
You know...

747
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,770
You lose a lot.

748
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,610
So...

749
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,030
Um...

750
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,790
But it was still...

751
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,970
I still love Neopets.

752
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:42,990
I still...

753
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,710
I still...

754
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,470
It was like...

755
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,770
It is like...

756
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,230
Uh...

757
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,990
Because back then...

758
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,310
Oh my gosh.

759
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,370
I don't know if you guys remember this.

760
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,810
The OG Neopets players will remember this.

761
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,790
But there was always...

762
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,490
People would be like...

763
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,850
Don't get CG'd.

764
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,050
Don't get cookie grabbed.

765
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,130
That was always like...

766
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,590
The...

767
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,290
The big...

768
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,610
The scariest thing...

769
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,530
Back then.

770
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,310
We would be like...

771
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,410
Don't get cookie grabbed.

772
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,250
Don't get...

773
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,170
You'll lose your account if you get cookie grabbed.

774
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,290
And don't visit random websites.

775
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,270
They're gonna be here for your Neopets account.

776
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,890
It's like...

777
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,310
I know some of you guys were like...

778
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,670
What...

779
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,830
What are these...

780
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,430
What are these terminologies?

781
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,290
It's...

782
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:21,470
It's...

783
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,350
It's an OG Neopets terminology.

784
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:24,610
Uh...

785
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,910
Everybody was so paranoid.

786
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:27,690
We'll be like...

787
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,230
Oh my god.

788
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,270
Don't visit these websites.

789
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,950
They have cookie grabs there.

790
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,470
Yeah!

791
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,630
Not my cookies!

792
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:36,870
Um...

793
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,930
It was the...

794
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,270
It was the Neopets Boogeyman.

795
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,810
All the little kids were so scared.

796
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,410
Because they were like...

797
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,050
You can only visit Neopets sites.

798
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,890
Because all these other dangerous websites outside of Neopets...

799
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,610
They're gonna be there for your Neopets account.

800
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,510
They're gonna try and cookie grab you.

801
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,150
Ok!

802
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,210
Okay.

803
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,510
And we were all so scared.

804
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,310
We were like, never visit the bad web.

805
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,710
Neopets is the only good website.

806
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,990
Never visit outside Neopets.

807
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,330
Anyway...

808
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,630
Anyway, sorry.

809
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,270
Sorry.

810
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,030
Off topic.

811
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:20,990
The Void Within.

812
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,750
So the reason why...

813
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,330
The King of Brightvale.

814
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,710
So for those... or sorry, Miradel.

815
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,170
So there's this guy, right?

816
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:31,930
This guy.

817
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,850
He's usually not depressed.

818
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:40,930
But like... so there's currently the curse... the grey curse right now.

819
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,130
And like, for those who don't know, this is... okay.

820
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,230
It's a little messed up.

821
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,510
But like...

822
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,890
Grey pets?

823
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,650
Are highly valued.

824
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,870
I know.

825
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,690
Okay.

826
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,630
Because we're like, oh my god.

827
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,050
The pet's sad.

828
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,410
Money... stocks go up.

829
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:11,750
One of my dream pets was a grey drake.

830
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,690
Because it looked so pretty.

831
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,290
But like, he was sad.

832
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,190
Like...

833
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,850
Because they were cute!

834
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,050
We were like, oh my god.

835
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,410
They were so cute!

836
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,170
I was... okay, here.

837
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,970
I'll show you guys.

838
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:26,950
They were... no!

839
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,030
Trust me!

840
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,190
They were so cute!

841
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,550
They're like... they're like... depressed.

842
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,150
But like, they were so cute.

843
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:33,650
Like...

844
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,530
It was a lot of money to get one, guys.

845
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,550
Like, you don't understand.

846
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,450
They're like, highly valued.

847
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,910
Like... here, I'll show you guys.

848
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,530
So...

849
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,090
This is... look!

850
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,350
It was so... it's so cute!

851
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,110
I...

852
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,490
It's... it's so cute!

853
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,090
Um... that's why you guys are starving.

854
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,470
Oh my... guys, this is why you're starving on my Neopets account.

855
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,050
Because...

856
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,310
Um... there's like a 1% chance.

857
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,410
Um... there's a 1% chance that you'll turn into a grey...

858
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,650
Um... a grey pet for free.

859
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,450
So like, I'm taking that 1% chance.

860
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,970
Like, I'm taking that 1% chance.

861
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,070
Uh...

862
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,170
I don't want that to happen!

863
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,170
Mom, you don't get it.

864
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,390
I'm valuable in Neopets.

865
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,150
No!

866
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,970
And like... they're worth 6 million dollars!

867
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,050
These guys are worth 6 million dollars!

868
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,670
No, you guys don't understand.

869
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,990
Look... look at the Lupe.

870
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,790
The grey Lupe.

871
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,790
Um... okay, never mind.

872
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,930
Grey Lupe's is not as like...

873
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,410
Okay... I will admit...

874
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,490
I will admit...

875
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,050
The grey Lupe...

876
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,190
Might look too depressing.

877
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,030
Like...

878
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,150
Now that...

879
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,830
I would admit that.

880
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,610
Okay, now that like I'm looking back into it...

881
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:13,010
The grey Lupe might look a little bit too much.

882
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,250
But like... the grey Drake... no... he was so cute.

883
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,390
Come on, like...

884
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,870
He... he was incredibly cute.

885
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,290
Okay... I... okay, but look at... okay...

886
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,230
Darigan Lupe.

887
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,790
This is one of my most valuable pets I had.

888
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,650
Um... cause like... I thought that looked badass.

889
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,310
But this is like my most...

890
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,230
I'll show you guys my most valuable pet that I've ever owned.

891
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,930
And he was like unconverted too.

892
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,610
Oh my god, this is a big file.

893
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,950
Holy shit!

894
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,970
How big is this file?

895
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,230
Oh my god!

896
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,990
This is a huge ass file!

897
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:47,710
What the fuck?

898
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,290
All the other files I downloaded were like tiny as hell.

899
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,850
That shows how popular this is.

900
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,030
This is like the biggest file I've ever owned.

901
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:52,410
I don't know what this pet was.

902
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,810
This particular color was.

903
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,510
Um... but like... this was my most valuable pet.

904
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,970
A Darigan Lupe.

905
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,550
Unconverted too, by the way.

906
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,690
Because he was like a badass dog.

907
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:07,950
It was...

908
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,910
It was... um...

909
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,170
Yes, I had an unconverted Darigan Lupe.

910
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,270
And that was why my account got cookie grabbed.

911
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,970
Because he wanted this guy!

912
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,110
He wanted this guy!

913
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,750
That was the main reason it got cookie grabbed.

914
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:35,650
Um...

915
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,750
Um... but this was my most valuable...

916
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,670
Uh... Lupe.

917
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,890
Um... that I've ever owned.

918
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,470
And... anyway... sorry.

919
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,610
Sorry, off topic.

920
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,490
Sorry, we were supposed to talk about...

921
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,070
I can't help it!

922
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,510
I can't help it!

923
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,350
I'm just going through like my memories and everything.

924
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:58,310
Um...

925
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:01,490
Um... I like... I played Neopets for years, guys.

926
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,390
I actually...

927
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:05,090
I played Neopets for years.

928
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,450
I did not have...

929
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:06,870
No!

930
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,670
Okay, the plushy pets were so cute too!

931
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,170
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

932
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,930
You can't say that.

933
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,310
You can't... I did not have an emo phase.

934
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,350
Because the plushy Neopets...

935
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,830
Um... were like...

936
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,890
So cute.

937
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:24,050
Like the Shoru plushy Neopet was like one of the cutest that they've ever had.

938
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,370
Alright, let me show you guys.

939
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,590
Okay, now... now you guys need to see why.

940
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,450
Like this was one of my dream Neopets that I never owned.

941
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,190
Because they were so... I was a child and they were too expensive.

942
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,030
Uh... children were...

943
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,930
Look at it!

944
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,430
He was so cute!

945
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,790
The plushy Shorus.

946
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:45,590
Um...

947
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,350
It's cause like back then...

948
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,230
Um... back then...

949
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,330
Uh... sorry, I meant... whenever I say like...

950
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,090
Dollars, I meant Neopoints by the way.

951
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:58,590
But even then, the Neopoints currency was like so hard to farm.

952
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,150
Um... but like...

953
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,690
Oh my god, I do...

954
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,070
There's so many things.

955
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,950
Like there was like a lot of goals I had within Neopets.

956
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,510
Because you know, I was a child.

957
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,970
And like back as a child, you know, you don't have much other than school.

958
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,370
And so like...

959
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,550
Like you had nothing to really strive for.

960
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,550
And...

961
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,550
Doki, what about good grades?

962
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,450
Anyway, you had nothing to really strive for as a child.

963
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:26,850
So...

964
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,190
So in...

965
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,970
In Neopets, I...

966
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,330
There was like... I like strive for particular goals.

967
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,450
Within...

968
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,310
Within Neopets.

969
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,050
So...

970
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,990
So that's stuff to do.

971
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,130
Um...

972
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,490
That's stuff to do.

973
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,650
And like...

974
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,170
Okay, sorry.

975
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,190
Back to the plot.

976
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,330
The void within.

977
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:48,690
Um...

978
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,490
Anyway...

979
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,910
So that's why he's sad.

980
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:51,690
Because...

981
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,290
He doesn't look like that.

982
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,130
He looks like a lot happier.

983
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,110
But there is a gray curse going on right now.

984
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,070
In...

985
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:00,770
Um...

986
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,730
In Neopets.

987
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,030
To a point that it is turning...

988
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:08,770
It's turning a lot of Neopets around the Neopian world gray.

989
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,970
So they're all trying to figure it out.

990
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,950
And that is basically the plot.

991
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:13,910
Um...

992
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,430
They're always like really well crafted.

993
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,790
Because it's like...

994
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:19,490
Um...

995
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,070
It's like a...

996
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,950
It's like a very elaborate ARG.

997
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,730
Within Neopets.

998
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,050
Neopets.com.

999
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,830
So if you guys enjoyed like ARG and stuff.

1000
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,930
Um...

1001
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:30,910
It's very interesting.

1002
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,590
Because it affects everywhere.

1003
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:33,810
Uh...

1004
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,450
Because it...

1005
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,590
Like everywhere you go.

1006
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,370
Like all different places you visit.

1007
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:38,870
Uh...

1008
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,510
Um...

1009
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,570
Things start changing.

1010
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,470
Um...

1011
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:42,750
And then you have to follow...

1012
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,530
Uh...

1013
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,510
You have to follow along.

1014
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,970
And like uncover like the mysteries and stuff.

1015
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,050
Um...

1016
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,350
I remember being...

1017
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:51,690
Like I said.

1018
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,270
I was around since the...

1019
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,450
Like since they discovered Miradel.

1020
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,310
Um...

1021
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,290
And that was like the very first plot I was there for.

1022
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:00,510
Uh...

1023
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,330
But...

1024
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:01,610
Ah!

1025
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,090
It's so...

1026
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:04,450
Um...

1027
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,190
It's...

1028
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,810
It's actually...

1029
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,150
It's...

1030
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,110
It's so interesting.

1031
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,690
Like I love it when they...

1032
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,970
I'm glad they're bringing it back.

1033
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:15,270
Because this is something they haven't done in a very, very long time.

1034
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,270
And...

1035
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,290
Um...

1036
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:17,570
It's...

1037
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,370
Their stories are always like been...

1038
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:19,730
I don't know.

1039
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,270
As a kid I really enjoyed the stories.

1040
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,410
And I heard that this one...

1041
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:23,930
Like look at that.

1042
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,010
This is like the...

1043
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,730
The timeline of like everything they've done.

1044
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,430
Miradel grayed out as the rift appears.

1045
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,610
So it's been like an ongoing thing for like a year now.

1046
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:35,590
Um...

1047
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,710
Where like things are like slowly changing.

1048
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:38,810
Um...

1049
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,830
Random events are happening every time.

1050
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,790
And...

1051
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:43,790
Um...

1052
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,390
And then there's like the story here.

1053
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,610
So you click this.

1054
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:47,870
Um...

1055
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,970
You get to interact with the story.

1056
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,070
And everything.

1057
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,130
So you can...

1058
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,030
It's like this is a really classic thing that they've done.

1059
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,090
So I've always loved the Neopets style.

1060
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,250
Like it's so iconic.

1061
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,050
And everything.

1062
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,970
So like you can see like they're telling the story and everything.

1063
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:03,830
Click next.

1064
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,330
And you get to...

1065
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:05,930
Uh...

1066
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,790
Enjoy like what's happening.

1067
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,950
Um...

1068
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,890
So it's like basically like Webtoons.

1069
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,510
And...

1070
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,890
Neopets walked so Webtoons can run.

1071
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:17,630
Uh...

1072
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:28,650
And then there's like a board for like to discuss about the plot lines and everything.

1073
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,070
And then you can send your Neopets to battle.

1074
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:31,750
Um...

1075
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,490
Because I believe the void within...

1076
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,070
Uh yeah.

1077
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,070
Webtoon in game.

1078
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:35,770
Yeah.

1079
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,350
So you have to battle these void prowler.

1080
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,150
I'm not gonna send you to battle because you guys might die.

1081
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:47,790
So...

1082
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,450
I don't have the money to heal you guys.

1083
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,530
So um...

1084
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,230
I'm not gonna send you guys to battle because...

1085
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,490
Oh I can volunteer at the Neo hospital.

1086
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:57,730
Oh my god.

1087
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,730
I could help you guys.

1088
00:52:58,770 --> 00:52:59,550
I could help the others.

1089
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:00,570
Um...

1090
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,630
But you're like level one.

1091
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:02,810
And um...

1092
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,210
I don't know if I wanted to send you guys to battle because I don't have the...

1093
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,770
I don't wanna waste my money.

1094
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,230
To heal you guys after.

1095
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,570
Uh so I'm...

1096
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,330
So I'm not gonna do it.

1097
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,290
Oh my god.

1098
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,170
Oh shit.

1099
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,010
Okay that was pretty funny.

1100
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:26,630
Anyway.

1101
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,050
Um...

1102
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:30,910
I would...

1103
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:31,570
Would...

1104
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,510
Oh I would like...

1105
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,770
Go to the boards.

1106
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:34,770
Uh...

1107
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,470
A lot.

1108
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,250
Uh...

1109
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:36,970
Back then.

1110
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:37,750
Um...

1111
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,430
Back then in...

1112
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,410
Uh...

1113
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,270
Neopets.

1114
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,170
And...

1115
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,430
This was the moment where I had to send a permission form.

1116
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,510
Um...

1117
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,450
I had to send a permission form.

1118
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,450
To like...

1119
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,270
Be allowed to talk on the boards.

1120
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,550
Because like I said...

1121
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,570
The boards were mainly for adults.

1122
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,030
Like you have to be over...

1123
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,530
I think like over 13.

1124
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,310
To be on the Neopets board.

1125
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,590
I was definitely not over 13.

1126
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:06,790
Um...

1127
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:07,610
And so like...

1128
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,270
We were restricted to do stuff.

1129
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,850
So we had to fax in a permission sheet.

1130
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,650
That was signed by my parents.

1131
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,490
To the Neopets headquarters.

1132
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,150
To be like...

1133
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:24,130
She is old enough to like talk to random strangers on the internet.

1134
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:31,930
She is...

1135
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:36,710
We give her permission to talk to strangers on the internet.

1136
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,630
And so I was allowed to talk to people on the internet.

1137
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:46,930
Um...

1138
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,470
Because like I didn't realize.

1139
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,670
People can lie about their age.

1140
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,370
Because like back then I was like...

1141
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,630
I don't know about that.

1142
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,070
Lying is wrong.

1143
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:06,830
So I actually told the truth.

1144
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,570
Oh my god.

1145
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,330
This is where I used to go.

1146
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,110
Where is it?

1147
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,230
There's stock!

1148
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,050
Wait!

1149
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,850
I don't remember this!

1150
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,990
There's a stock to import!

1151
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,150
Today I bought... wait what?

1152
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,330
Okay, wait a minute.

1153
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,330
I didn't realize.

1154
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,070
What does this mean?

1155
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:38,890
Oh yeah, by the way, this is like remembering you of like Gaia online.

1156
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:45,270
Where you can customize your... you know, you can talk to other people on your fest and then you can like...

1157
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:52,530
I know the stock market, I knew about it, but I didn't know there was an entire board dedicated to this.

1158
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:01,610
Anyway, so you can like customize your... it's so funny.

1159
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,390
You can like...

1160
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,990
Sold 3 to 4 3k at 119?

1161
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,870
I just have a lot of money.

1162
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:14,490
I have a thousand stocks of... I guess I'll sell them while they're hot at 117!

1163
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,010
Oh my god!

1164
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:20,510
I feel like I'm reading the stock market board right now.

1165
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,250
I told you guys!

1166
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,150
Little Doki did not know what she was doing.

1167
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,510
All I did... I played the games to earn the money!

1168
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,730
I just played the games!

1169
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,190
What the... Oh my god!

1170
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,770
Is this... What the heck is hyperstocking?

1171
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,450
What are these terms?

1172
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:54,930
Anyway, for those who want to not use... spend real money at the stock market, but want to learn how to do the stock market...

1173
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:03,670
I highly suggest... if you're a stock market bro and you want to learn or you want to get into learning, but not invest in the real money...

1174
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:10,350
I highly suggest trying it out on the NEO... on the NEO stock market.

1175
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,410
You guys want to know where it is?

1176
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,950
Okay, I'll take you guys there.

1177
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,910
Explore... where is it?

1178
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:23,330
It's here.

1179
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:24,790
Alright, so this is the map.

1180
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,690
I'll show you guys.

1181
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,890
Post office... should be the stock market here.

1182
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,910
Okay, NEO bank... wait, is the stock market not here?

1183
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:33,650
Okay, NEO bank...

1184
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:33,650
wait, is the stock market not here?

1185
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,530
Or is it in the bazaar?

1186
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,010
It's been a long time.

1187
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:40,070
The chocolate... oh my god, this is so... so many memories here.

1188
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:46,250
I tried to do restocking, but I couldn't do restocking because I... my internet was just not fast enough.

1189
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,870
Also, if you're poor, you go to the soup kitchen here... to feed your pets.

1190
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:01,650
If you're poor and you can't afford anything... you go... you go to the soup kitchen...

1191
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,190
and then she'll feed your pets for free.

1192
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:12,430
So you go here... so you're like... oh my god... um... I don't have money... please ma'am... can you feed me?

1193
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,870
Because you're dying right now.

1194
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,970
So all I do is I click on this guy... and then... mmm... thanks... I needed that.

1195
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,770
And then you're content now.

1196
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:25,610
Now you're just very hungry... and that's like... all you deserve.

1197
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,350
Uh...

1198
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:29,870
That's...

1199
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:31,570
That's...

1200
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,210
Oh my god... where's the stock market?

1201
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:37,110
They had the stock market?

1202
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,670
Where is it?

1203
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:43,010
How else am I gonna teach you guys the stock market?

1204
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,630
Okay, so...

1205
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,530
Guys, where's the stock market, guys?

1206
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:51,570
Also, if you're too rich, they like... won't let you in.

1207
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,310
They know... they also know if you're too rich too.

1208
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:55,930
Uh...

1209
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,440
It's in games?

1210
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,920
You used to be able to go to...

1211
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,920
Wait, they moved the location?

1212
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,120
You used to be able to like... visit the town... and like... um...

1213
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,500
Visit the town... and like... uh... just go...

1214
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,180
Oh yeah, but anyway, here's the... I'll show you guys the bank.

1215
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,220
The main shop.

1216
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,500
Let me take you to the main shop.

1217
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,500
And then... um...

1218
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,900
Let's see, I'm just... okay, I'll take you to the bank.

1219
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,420
Uh... here you go.

1220
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,320
So like... this is where you learn about interest rates.

1221
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,760
So you basically... you... uh... so...

1222
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,740
Right here, they're asking you to create an actual...

1223
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,820
National Neopene Bank.

1224
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,800
So... you have to create your own bank account.

1225
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,060
And it like... teaches you what you need.

1226
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,520
When it... your annual salary, your account type, your initial deposit.

1227
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,800
He's depressed.

1228
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,460
I told you, it's... the gray curse is going on.

1229
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,380
And then... you have to fill in all these information.

1230
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,080
But don't enter your real address.

1231
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,400
Enter your Neopene address.

1232
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,460
Um...

1233
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,360
And uh...

1234
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:01,920
Hahaha!

1235
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,340
Just like... I told you!

1236
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,980
It teaches you everything you need!

1237
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,700
Except for taxes.

1238
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,620
Um... there's no... thank god, there's no taxation here.

1239
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:14,260
Uh...

1240
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,220
And... I learned a lot!

1241
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,200
I learned about coding and everything.

1242
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,640
From... um... from Neopets.

1243
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,660
Oh, it's okay, it's in games.

1244
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,600
Okay, we're gonna find...

1245
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,520
Um...

1246
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,420
I en... it's actually really fun.

1247
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,780
You... it's... it's really fun when you like...

1248
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,280
Um...

1249
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,300
I swear, like...

1250
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,380
I spent so much time.

1251
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:40,540
Um...

1252
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,160
They also have all the classic games are still like around and everything.

1253
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,120
Because like a lot of the games I used to play is still there.

1254
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,240
Um...

1255
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Where's the stock market?

1256
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,900
I need to know where the stock market is.

1257
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:52,760
Like...

1258
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,320
Hahaha!

1259
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,220
That's the most important part.

1260
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,800
Okay, all games.

1261
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,320
All games.

1262
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,720
It's just start with...

1263
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,900
Is it just starts with S?

1264
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,160
Uh...

1265
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,840
Oh my god, they have...

1266
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,700
Okay, which one was my favorite?

1267
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:07,900
Uh...

1268
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,540
Oh god, I hated the buzzer game.

1269
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,280
I was so bad with the buzzer game.

1270
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,040
Um...

1271
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,860
Coconut Shy was like my...

1272
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,160
Oh, the Carnival Terror?

1273
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,220
Good for farming.

1274
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,100
Uh...

1275
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,820
Hahaha!

1276
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,220
Good for farming money.

1277
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,380
Um...

1278
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,180
Normally the best farming...

1279
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:24,820
Uh...

1280
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,100
Neopoints games are the ones that are...

1281
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,440
Uh...

1282
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,060
Are the ones that are...

1283
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:31,500
Uh...

1284
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,120
Are fast and like easy.

1285
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,960
Because it only gives you a thousand...

1286
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,520
It only gives you a thousand Neopoints per play.

1287
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,780
So like...

1288
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,860
All I did...

1289
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,020
Because I didn't really understand the stock market.

1290
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,040
Because I was...

1291
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,660
You know...

1292
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,240
A child.

1293
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,620
Hahaha!

1294
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,180
I...

1295
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,880
I don't know.

1296
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:54,720
But like...

1297
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,740
I feel like as a child...

1298
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,420
You know...

1299
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,500
You don't really...

1300
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,320
I think like...

1301
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,100
I'm trying to understand the stock market.

1302
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,300
Might be like...

1303
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,420
A little bit beyond my knowledge.

1304
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,400
So like...

1305
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,040
When I made money...

1306
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,860
I just played the games.

1307
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,540
Hahaha!

1308
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,240
I was like...

1309
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,120
Hahaha!

1310
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,120
Hahaha!

1311
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,560
Um...

1312
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,800
Oh, there he is!

1313
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,800

1314
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,480

01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,120
Okay...

1316
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,680
This is how you invest in the stock market guys.

1317
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,680
So...

1318
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,520
Um...

1319
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,340
Buy...

1320
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,020
Sell...

1321
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,460
Buy...

1322
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:26,860

I...

1327
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,080
I can't...

1328
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,140
I remember seeing...

1329
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:33,680
Cause I got...

1330
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,920
I once tried...

1331
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,000
I tried once at the stock market.

1332
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:37,960
But like...

1333
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,120
I did not understand.

1334
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,060
So...

1335
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,220

On the stock market.

1343
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,600
And...

1344
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:53,880
Then...

1345
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,440
You can find stocks here.

1346
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:56,840

01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,980
You search up specific or you go to the full list.

01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,060
There's a bread...

1354
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:24,480
Oh my god, the Breadmaster Bakery is still around.

1355
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,080
And then you see the competitors.

Of like how the competitors are doing as well.

So like you see the competitors and then you go to like news and research to read like...

1358
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,940

01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,430
And want to learn...

1363
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,350
How stock marking works.

1364
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,090
This is how you do it.

1365
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,290
This is how you do it.

1366
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:06,630
Anyway, let's go back to exploring.

1367
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:07,910
Oh my god.

1368
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:11,550
Is everybody sad now in Miradell?

1369
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,710
Cause like...

1370
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:13,070
Oh!

1371
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:16,790
Oh my god, it's all grey!

1372
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,490
The grey curse!

1373
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,210
The value...

1374
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:22,630
Their value went up.

1375
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,070
Oh my god!

1376
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,450
Their value went up!

1377
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,290
Anyway, so like...

1378
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,390
I wonder what he looks like.

1379
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:37,850
Is he sad?

1380
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,470
Oh, I don't... He's okay.

1381
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,830
He's just...

1382
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:42,170
Dumb.

1383
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,630
Hey, at least these guys are happy.

1384
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,170
Wait, they're sad too?

1385
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,250
Wait, no.

1386
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:50,830
Okay, yeah.

1387
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,490
Your word of wisdom.

1388
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,530
If you'd make him think you're smart, you'd win stuff.

1389
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,630
Anyway...

1390
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,190
Wait, are they all sad?

1391
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,890
It's just a little... Only some of them are sad.

1392
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,430
Okay, only some of them are sad.

1393
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,310
Alright, that's good to know.

1394
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,970
That's good to... Okay.

1395
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,990
Are you okay, grumpy old king?

1396
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,230
Oh...

1397
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,450
Okay, you guys wanna know what he actually looks like?

1398
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:14,930
Let me...

1399
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:21,550
Alright, this is what he actually...

1400
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:22,830
Um...

1401
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,410
This is what he actually looks like.

1402
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,670
But the grey curse got him.

1403
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,650
Let me grab it for you guys.

1404
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,590
This is like...

1405
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,250
This is his real form.

1406
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,470
Um...

1407
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,710
Before it got him.

1408
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,250
This is what he used to look like.

1409
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,390
But now...

1410
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:43,930
Now his value went up.

1411
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:44,850
Um...

1412
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,830
But...

1413
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:53,830
Um...

1414
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,030
Oh my god, wait.

1415
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,770
Why is he so cute?

1416
01:05:58,670 --> 01:05:59,550
I can...

1417
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,170
I can...

1418
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:00,870
I can fix him!

1419
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:01,910
I can...

1420
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,690
I can fix him!

1421
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,790
Oh my god!

1422
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,370
He's grumpy!

1423
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,810
Now he's sad!

1424
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,330
Um...

1425
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,270
Anyway, so...

1426
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,030
This is what he looked like before...

1427
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,130
Before the grey curse came in.

1428
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:18,210
So now he's sad.

1429
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,310
Now he's a sad little guy.

1430
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,930
Now he...

1431
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:21,630
Can he laugh?

1432
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,250
Cause like, the thing is...

1433
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,390
What you do is that you tell a...

1434
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,070
You try to tell a joke to him.

1435
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,490
And then like...

1436
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:29,450
There's like...

1437
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:30,050
Um...

1438
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:30,890
I wonder...

1439
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:31,910
What does he say?

1440
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,930
What does he say if like...

1441
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,710
I just tell him a random joke?

1442
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,270
Like...

1443
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,610
Will he laugh?

1444
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:40,910
Will he cry?

1445
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:42,690
Usually he'll like...

1446
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,470
Cry or laugh.

1447
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:45,690
But like...

1448
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:46,810
Usually he'll be like...

1449
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,830
He'll laugh or like...

1450
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,350
Send you away if you're not funny.

1451
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,590
Oh, I got food!

1452
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,210
That...

1453
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,950
Guess that wasn't too bad of a joke.

1454
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:55,850
I probably...

1455
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:56,090
Oh!

1456
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,650
600!

1457
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,310
What can you call upon a family at Christmas?

1458
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,770
Are carers...

1459
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,410
Fine and knack at advisor wesl...

1460
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:06,930
At carrying her a bar of the one...

1461
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:07,670
Fire 101?

1462
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:08,890
Dude!

1463
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,170
What are these words?

1464
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:11,650
Hey!

1465
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,070
But he thought it was 647 out of a thousand!

1466
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,430
I did really good!

1467
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:19,170
And he gave me free food!

1468
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,750
You gotta chuckle!

1469
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,370
I think the sadness is affecting his health, guys.

1470
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:25,210
I...

1471
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:26,670
Did he?

1472
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,310
Did he?

1473
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:30,130
I think...

1474
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,250
It's an A!

1475
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:32,470
It's an A-I!

1476
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,870
It looked like a fucking chat GPD!

1477
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:40,790
But guys!

1478
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:41,950
I got...

1479
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:42,530
Guys!

1480
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:43,270
I got...

1481
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,950
I got free food!

1482
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:45,770
I got peas!

1483
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:47,590
Guys, I got peas!

1484
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,470
It's okay!

1485
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,210
Anyway, let's go back to explore.

1486
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,010
Oh my god.

1487
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:52,890
Team Haunted Woods.

1488
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,970
But there used to be like a lot of stuff.

1489
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,130
You can...

1490
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:56,830
Oh my god.

1491
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,910
This is...

1492
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:59,490
There's Altador right here.

1493
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:00,550
There's...

1494
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,410
Oh, there's Shenku!

1495
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,690
I remember Shenku when they...

1496
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:03,390
The world...

1497
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:04,170
Is that...

1498
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:04,990
There's Lutari Island.

1499
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,610
Wait, can you actually go to Lutari Island now?

1500
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:08,610
Are you...

1501
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,310
It's been yours.

1502
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,910
Wait!

1503
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:11,570
What?

1504
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:14,850
Wait, what is this?

1505
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,110
Oh!

1506
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:18,630
Oh my god!

1507
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:20,270
Lutari Island is part of the plot!

1508
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,370
Oh my god!

1509
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:23,970
Finally!

1510
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:27,370
You can do something at Lutari Island!

1511
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,910
Oh my god!

1512
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,150
Oh my god, there's Jelly World.

1513
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,610
I almost forgot about Jelly World.

1514
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:37,830
Oh my god.

1515
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,750
I'm so happy.

1516
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,250
I'm so happy.

1517
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:45,810
Finally you can do something at Lutari Island.

1518
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,690
Yeah guys, Jelly World...

1519
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,930
Oh yeah, and then there's Rue Island.

1520
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:53,530
There's like Rue Island here.

1521
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:54,370
Whoa!

1522
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,030
Rue Island...

1523
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,350
I don't know.

1524
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,230
It's like bigger now.

1525
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,270
It's like better.

1526
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,230
Uh, there's Ru Island.

1527
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,410
Oh yeah, you guys can buy houses too, by the way.

1528
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:12,650
So, if you guys didn't know, in Neopets, you can also do real estate.

1529
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:22,110
You can also own houses in Neopets too.

1530
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:26,010
And like, go into the real estate business.

1531
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:31,190
So, I bought a home in Neopets as well.

1532
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:34,150
So like, at least, you know, I own something.

1533
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:38,410
Only in Neopets do I own a home.

1534
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,970
I'm a real home owner.

1535
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,670
We learned marketing with me.

1536
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,270
Anyway, where was I?

1537
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:52,370
Oh my god, it's actually like, there's so many memories just from...

1538
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,370
Where is Jelly Island?

1539
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,090
Wait, Moltera City?

1540
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,390
Wait, that's new.

1541
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,310
What's Moltera City?

1542
01:09:59,190 --> 01:09:59,990
What the?

1543
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:01,970
What is this?

1544
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,350
Is this like...

1545
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,150
Is this like Steampunk?

1546
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,590
Wait, I've never seen Moltera City before.

1547
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,350
Yeah, it's Steampunk.

1548
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,050
That's so interesting.

1549
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,510
Wait, this is actually so interesting.

1550
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,870
This is new for me.

1551
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,750
Oh!

1552
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:21,980
Something happened!

1553
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,580
Guys!

1554
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,760
So like, this is what I mean by like...

1555
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:27,840
Random events.

1556
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:29,720
Um...

1557
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,200
This is what I mean by random events.

1558
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:41,480
So like, I'm waiting on the 1% chance that like I would get the random events where basically you turn gray.

1559
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:47,960
So like, it's like a 1% chance where you encounter somebody who's gonna zap your pet into a gray pet.

1560
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,340
And like, that's what I'm waiting on right now.

1561
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,920
That's what I'm waiting on.

1562
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,140
Also, there's a...

1563
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,160
The prices change every day because it tells...

1564
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,320
There's an inflation rate.

1565
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,720
So it lets you know what the inflation rate is.

1566
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,320
Oh,

1567
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,810
this quest line is broken.

1568
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,590
Oh no!

1569
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,430
Oh, this is like the Moltera...

1570
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:14,670
The Moltera City.

1571
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:16,130
Alright, explore time!

1572
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,330
Let's see.

1573
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:19,330
Guys!

1574
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:19,910
Oh my gosh!

1575
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:20,970
Oh, she opened a shop!

1576
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,870
Oh my god, I forgot!

1577
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,290
Okay, wait.

1578
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,730
Um, I need to grab an omelet.

1579
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,050
Okay, it's in...

1580
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:26,750
It's not in the desert.

1581
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:27,670
It's in...

1582
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:28,530
Um...

1583
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:29,990
So, we used to have dailies.

1584
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,590
So, you know in Genshin Impact...

1585
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,890
Wait.

1586
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:33,330
What the fuck?

1587
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,730
What the fuck?

1588
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,930
What happened?

1589
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,150
What happened to Terrania?

1590
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:44,130
You guys are supposed to be stuck in a prehistoric age.

1591
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:45,830
Who let you guys upgrade?

1592
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,910
Who let you guys...

1593
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:58,030
You are supposed to be forever stuck in the prehistoric age.

1594
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:03,710
Who let you upgrade?

1595
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:06,130
Who taught you technology?

1596
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:10,270
Who gave you technology?

1597
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,270
Anyway...

1598
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,890
Anyway...

1599
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,130
Um...

1600
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,110
They advanced?

1601
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:19,450
Who let these guys advance?

1602
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:22,110
They are supposed to be stone age forever.

1603
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:23,690
Anyway...

1604
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:24,430
Um...

1605
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:24,710
Um...

1606
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:28,730
They learned how to read.

1607
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:31,850
So...

1608
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,070
Um...

1609
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:36,090
Before Gacha...

1610
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,150
Um...

1611
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,310
In the west...

1612
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:40,210
Before we had Gacha...

1613
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,690
In the west...

1614
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,210
We had Neopets dailies.

1615
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,710
So...

1616
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,070
Every day...

1617
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,290
We do dailies...

1618
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:51,150
In Neopets.

1619
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,090
And one of them...

1620
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:54,690
Is you can get free...

1621
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:55,470
Free food.

1622
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:56,330
But...

1623
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:56,770
Oh my god...

1624
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,950
It's a sad omelette now.

1625
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:58,690
Oh my god...

1626
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,190
The curse.

1627
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:00,310
The curse.

1628
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:01,290
Um...

1629
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:01,610
Anyway...

1630
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,370
Every day...

1631
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,590
What the...

1632
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,770
What the fuck?

1633
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:09,050
You grab some omelette and then you can grab a slice.

1634
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:10,390
But there's like links and stuff.

1635
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,790
So every day there's like dailies to do.

1636
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,150
What the...

1637
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,530
Why do you guys...

1638
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,410
You guys can build bridges now?

1639
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,390
This is crazy.

1640
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:21,450
How...

1641
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:22,450
Who taught you guys?

1642
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,070
Oh yeah...

1643
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,670
And then we can...

1644
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:25,030
We can gamble.

1645
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,390
You can click the wheel.

1646
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:29,070
We spin the wheel to gamble.

1647
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,170
So the...

1648
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,910
So it costs 150 Neopets.

1649
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,150
And then we spin the wheel.

1650
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:35,610
Sorry.

1651
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,090
You can't really see it very well.

1652
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:38,930
But you can spin the wheel.

1653
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,450
You can get a paintbrush too.

1654
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,050
Look at that.

1655
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:45,590
Wait.

1656
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:46,150
Do I have to click it?

1657
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,250
Do I have to click it?

1658
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:51,850
Please do not create multiple counts to use the wheel as it unbounds.

1659
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,610
Your limit is spinning.

1660
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,790
When does it end?

1661
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:54,650
Oh.

1662
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:58,650
I forgot it spins for 4 hours.

1663
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:59,750
Oh.

1664
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,970
I fucked up.

1665
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,730
I forgot.

1666
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,570
Sorry.

1667
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:14,150
This wheel spins for 4 hours.

1668
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,130
So um...

1669
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,170
What?

1670
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:24,630
So I guess I lost a hundred euros.

1671
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,690
150 NEO points.

1672
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:29,270
I guess I'll spin something else.

1673
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:29,650
Okay.

1674
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:30,190
All right.

1675
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,170
So we have... don't worry.

1676
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,090
We have another wheel.

1677
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:37,610
We have... we have another wheel that we can spin.

1678
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:40,010
The wheel of misfortune.

1679
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,350
Spin that wheel.

1680
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,810
That's another 150 points, but that's okay.

1681
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,310
What did I get?

1682
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,850
Oh shit.

1683
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:58,190
Okay.

1684
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,170
You got neopox.

1685
01:14:59,310 --> 01:14:59,970
Don't worry.

1686
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:00,630
It's not fatal.

1687
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:11,530
Okay.

1688
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:13,470
Congratulations, Dragoons!

1689
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:16,690
You got... you got neopox!

1690
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:19,590
Yay!

1691
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:23,670
I could cure you, but that... that costs money.

1692
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,570
So...

1693
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,630
we're just gonna explore.

1694
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,810
We're just gonna explore instead.

1695
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,030
Like, I could heal you.

1696
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,150
Yes, I could.

1697
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,810
But I'm sorry.

1698
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,610
I don't have... I don't have the funds right now.

1699
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:43,310
Guys, I'm...

1700
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,130
I'm poor guys.

1701
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:45,630
Oh yeah.

1702
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:47,750
By the way, Fairyland used to be...

1703
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,370
Is there still the invisible tower?

1704
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,110
Where would the invisible tower be?

1705
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:54,430
Is it still...

1706
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,790
here?

1707
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:57,910
Wait, where would the invisible tower be?

1708
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,290
Guys, where's the invisible...

1709
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:01,070
Oh, is it this?

1710
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:02,830
Is this the invisible tower?

1711
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:03,890
I did it!

1712
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:04,310
Okay.

1713
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,190
I still got it.

1714
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:06,950
All right.

1715
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:11,910
So the invisible tower is the tower... is like a secret hidden...

1716
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:17,210
It was like a secret hidden tower where you can buy like really expensive...

1717
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,670
There's a valentine paintbrush now?

1718
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:20,670
What?

1719
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,630
Oh yeah.

1720
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,250
Anyway, so like there's like...

1721
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,190
Um... really rare brushes.

1722
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:27,670
Really rare items here.

1723
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:30,530
So like this is where you can buy them.

1724
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:35,130
It's not secret anymore because like... Um... because it's been out for like... What?

1725
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,930
Neopets is 25 years old.

1726
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,510
That's actually insane to think about.

1727
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,750
Anyway, I was...

1728
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,570
As I was saying, I wanted to start a shop.

1729
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:42,610
I'm gonna start a shop.

1730
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:43,210
All right.

1731
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,110
You don't have a shop.

1732
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:47,090
It only costs... How do I select create and edit a shop?

1733
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,990
Okay, I want to create a shop.

1734
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:49,910
Alright guys.

1735
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:53,130
Um... I'm gonna put...

01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:58,990
Let's see.

1738
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:00,110
I'm gonna call it...

1739
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:04,250
I need to know if anything pops up if I try typing.

1740
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,190
Let me double check.

1741
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:10,530
Alright, nice.

1742
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:11,530
Okay, it doesn't.

01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,090
Alright, nice.

1744
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,830
Alright.

01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:14,870
Nice.

1746
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:15,970
Alright, we're gonna call it.

1747
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:17,230
What do we call it?

1748
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:17,390
Okay.

1749
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:18,810
Oh, shit.

01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:19,630
Okay, Doki Merch.

1757
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:33,710

Okay.

1768
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:51,910
They can...

1769
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:52,890
run my shop for me.

1770
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,870
Guys, I need to select a new shopkeeper.

1771
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:57,250
New pets.

1772
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,070
I don't want you guys to see who is...

1773
01:17:59,070 --> 01:17:59,910
Okay, I'm gonna put...

01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:05,350
Where are you, Pateri?

1778
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:06,610

1779
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,350
Oh!

Okay, now you guys can see it.

1781
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:10,410
Alright.

1782
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:11,670
Which one?

1783
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:12,610
Which one should be me?

1784
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:13,670
Oh my god.

1785
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,210
I could be a wizard.

1786
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:15,750
I could be a wizard.

1787
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:18,870
Alright, let's see.

1788
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:19,570
Shadow.

1789
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:19,790
Oh!

1790
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,210
That's gonna be me.

1791
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:28,190
Alright.

1792
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,330
We're gonna run that as the shopkeeper.

1793
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,810
Update shop.

1794
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:34,830
And then...

1795
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,630
Create shop stock.

1796
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,890
Okay, I wanna add stuff into my shop.

1797
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,350

01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,630
Alright.

Okay, nice.

I got the peas porridge and the...

1802
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:48,770

1803
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:49,550
Alright, so...

1804
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:50,510
I click this.

1805
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,350
I'm gonna put it in my shop.

1806
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:54,510
Open up.

1807
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:54,970
Alright.

1808
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,270
I could feed you guys.

1809
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,930
But, I'm gonna put it in my shop.

1810
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:01,030
Alright.

1811
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,750
And then I'm gonna put the peas too.

1812
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,750
I'm gonna put my peas in the shop as well.

1813
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,570
Put into your shop.

1814
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:07,750
Alright, nice.

1815
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,550
Okay, and then...

1816
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,370
View stock.

1817
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,440
I think that's good.

1818
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:16,780
It's rare!

1819
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,020
Okay, 999.

1820
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,160
Alright, and then this one.

1821
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:20,860
I'll put it...

1822
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,940
as 99999.

1823
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,260
Oh wait, that's not 9.

1824
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:29,720
999998.

1825
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:30,340
There we go.

1826
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,380
Nice.

1827
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,660
Also, you can add a pin number too if you want.

1828
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,240
Alright.

1829
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,460
You guys don't see it?

1830
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,560
You guys don't see it, guys?

1831
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,100
It said it was rare!

1832
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:40,680
Guys!

1833
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,160
Look!

1834
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,880
Wait, did you guys buy it already?

1835
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,280
Did you?

1836
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,820
Did you guys buy it?

1837
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,720
Did you guys spend money already?

1838
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,980
Wait!

1839
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,420
Wait a minute!

1840
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,600
Wait a minute!

1841
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,140
Where's the omelette?

1842
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,060

1843
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,160

Fucking easy!

1845
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:18,850
I'm rich!

1846
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,840
I'm fucking rich!

1847
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:23,750
I'm fucking rich!

1848
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,630
You're rich!

1849
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:28,750
You're rich!

1850
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,210
Okay, that ends...

1851
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,510
Okay, that ends...

1852
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,350
Let's fucking go!

1853
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,210
Let's fucking go!

1854
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:36,710
Let's fucking go!

1855
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:42,130
What's the maximum that I can withdraw?

1856
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:45,450
One nine nine nine...

1857
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,370
One nine nine nine...

1858
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,250
Nine nine six!

1859
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:51,710
Did I grab all of it?

1860
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,110
Yeah!

1861
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,010
Yeah!

1862
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:55,250
I'm a...

1863
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,760
I'm a... Oh my god, you're grumpy now!

1864
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,080
Because you have Neopox!

1865
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,420
You're so...

1866
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,920
You used to be sad!

1867
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,600
Now you're sick and sad!

1868
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,520
Now you're sick and sad!

1869
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,600
Oh wait...

1870
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,140
I need to look at you.

1871
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,160
Oh my god!

1872
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,080
Alright.

1873
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,660
Let's see.

1874
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,660
I need to check.

1875
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,820
I need to check some stuff.

1876
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,220
Oh yeah, by the way.

1877
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,740
Here's what I made for you guys.

1878
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,340
So you guys are...

1879
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,940
You're strong, but your defense is below happy.

1880
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,060
Below average.

1881
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,780
Because we all know that we are not...

1882
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,120
We are not...

1883
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,760
We are not a defense...

1884
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,600
Person.

1885
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:46,040
No, we're too rich for the soup kitchen!

1886
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,100
Chat!

1887
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,920
We're too rich for the soup kitchen now!

1888
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,220
We're too rich for the soup kitchen now!

1889
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,640
She's not gonna let us into the soup kitchen anymore!

1890
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:57,320
She's not gonna let us into the soup kitchen anymore!

1891
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,880
Wait, what do I do if I go to find a cure?

1892
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:01,940
Um...

1893
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,300
Let's see.

1894
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,060
What do I need to...

1895
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,840
What do I need to do to cure you?

1896
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,040
What is it?

1897
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:09,560
Neopox?

1898
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,640
Uh, watery eyes.

1899
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,940
No, uh...

1900
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,480
No, I'm poor!

1901
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,380
Guys, the inflation!

1902
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,200
Think about...

1903
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,300
Where the fuck is Neopox?

1904
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,040
Neophobia?

1905
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,960
This is us.

1906
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,420
Guys...

1907
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,380
Guys, this is us.

1908
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:30,880
We need this.

1909
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,520
Make them wear a pair of step out shoes.

1910
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:35,960
Um...

1911
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,020
Where the fuck is...

1912
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,500
There's pneumonia?

1913
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,820
There's neo... shit!

1914
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,020
I do not remember...

1915
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:44,800
Pneumonia.

1916
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,540
Hahaha!

1917
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,340
I forgot some of the names.

1918
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,380
Hahaha!

1919
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,340
Oh, there you go.

1920
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,540
You have to feed them...

1921
01:22:55,540 --> 01:23:00,220
It will be covered with very itchy, contagious red blotches.

1922
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,620
Oh, you're just itchy?

1923
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,560
You'll be fine.

1924
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,680
You'll be fine, guys.

1925
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,600
You're just itchy, guys.

1926
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,760
You'll be...

1927
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,800
You just got the cooties.

1928
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,760
Guys, it's okay.

1929
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,600
You're just itchy.

1930
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,500
Don't make me visit the pound.

1931
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,560
Guys, what's the pound?

1932
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,740
Don't worry, I'll show you what the pound is.

1933
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:20,740
Hahaha!

1934
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,340
Hahaha!

1935
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,180
Give me a sec.

1936
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,140
I need to find the pound.

1937
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,680
I need a doki, please.

1938
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:31,140
Hahaha!

1939
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,380
Give me a sec.

1940
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,620
I need to remember where the pound is located.

1941
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:36,480
Hahaha!

1942
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,740
Oh, some of you guys are like, What's the pound?

1943
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,260
Don't worry, guys.

1944
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,300
Let me find...

1945
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,620
I'll find the pound real quick for you guys.

1946
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:46,660
Um...

1947
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,280
I need to find it.

1948
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,360
The pound will treat us...

1949
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,360
Guys, where's the pound?

1950
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,280
Where's the neopound?

1951
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,580
I don't remember where it was located.

1952
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,900
It's in the plaza?

1953
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,100
Oh, somebody's been to the pound before.

1954
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,160
Some...

1955
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,100
Hahaha!

1956
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,060
Somebody has a lot of knowledge about the pound.

1957
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:11,920
Somebody has a lot of knowledge about the pound.

1958
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,060
But they remember it quite well.

1959
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:14,480
But they remember it quite well.

1960
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:14,960
Hahaha!

1961
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,020
Alright.

1962
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,340
So, um...

1963
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:21,860
In Neopets...

1964
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,760
We have...

1965
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,540
Adopt, Transfer...

1966
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:28,300
Or Abandon.

1967
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,560
Hahaha!

1968
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:30,920
Hahaha!

1969
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,740
So, when you...

1970
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,640
When you go there...

1971
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,460
Oh, shit!

1972
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,820
I got the doctor death.

1973
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,860
You can basically...

1974
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,040
Hahaha!

1975
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,060
They'll start, like, make me cry...

1976
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,140
And then I can, like...

1977
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,740
Pay 250...

1978
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,280
Neopoints...

1979
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,180
To throw you in the pound.

1980
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,760
But... yeah!

1981
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,840
But then you can also adopt!

1982
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:56,680
You know?

1983
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,380
You have a... that's currently in...

1984
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:58,720
Transit.

1985
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,820
Oh, wait!

1986
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,520
Did somebody try to send me rare pets?

1987
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,380
Who tried to send me stuff?

1988
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:05,900
Has offered...

1989
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,220
What the fuck?

1990
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:07,540
No!

1991
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:09,940
Reject.

1992
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:11,220
Alright.

1993
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:12,860
What the fuck?

1994
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,480
Why would I pay you for that?

1995
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,300
What?

1996
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:16,260
Anyway...

1997
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,260
Um...

1998
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,400
You can basically go there and, like...

1999
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,200
Adopt...

2000

I'm sorry!

2191
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,740
That requires real money!

2192
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,360
I don't...

2193
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,000

2194
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:52,840
Hahaha!

01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:56,780
Hahaha!

2197
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:57,040
Hahaha!

2198
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:00,520
Okay!

2199
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,400

2200
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:02,860

01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,820
I need to get doki bird in here!

2203
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:08,700

01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,660
I have to reject!

2205
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,900

2207
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,960

2208
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,160

2209
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,020
Hahaha!

2210
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:19,960
Hahaha!

2211
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,200
Hahaha!

2212
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,180
Oh my god!

2213
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,220
Give me a sec!

2214
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,660
Give me a sec!

2215
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:27,980
Okay!

2216
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:28,480
Okay!

2217
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,100
It's your turn!

2218
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,280
Oh my god!

2219
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:30,540
No!

2220
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,560
No!

2221
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,100
Do I want doki bird or do I just want doki drake?

2222
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:35,720
Hahaha!

2223
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:37,640
Hahaha!

2224
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:38,600
Hahaha!

2225
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:38,820
Hahaha!

2226
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,100
Hey!

2227
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,080
Hahaha!

2228
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,140
Guys!

2229
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,140
Okay!

2230
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:51,660
Do I want doki bird or do I want doki drake?

2231
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,760
Hahaha!

2232
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,600

2233
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,860
I'm sorry!

2234
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,240
Hahaha!

2235
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,760
Hahaha!

2236
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:02,780
Hahaha!

2237
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:05,820
What will you do?

2238
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,380
You know exactly what I'm going to do...

2239
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:10,640
...You know exactly what I'm going to do!

2240
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,160
What I'm going to do!

2241
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:13,880
Sorry!

2242
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,300
Hahaha!

2243
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:17,420
I'm so sorry!

2244
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,680
Hahaha!

2245
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,600
Hahaha!

2246
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,380
Oh my god!

2247
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,540
Just...

2248
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:28,080
You literally just bored!

2249
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,120
Hahaha!

2250
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:30,740
Okay!

2251
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,360
I'm so sorry!

2252
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,740
I... it was so hard.

2253
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,300
Wait, you can't send it because I rejected it?

2254
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:40,840
No!

2255
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:41,780
You can't...

2256
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,080
We can't still accept it?

2257
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,520
Or is that... is that it?

2258
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,820
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

2259
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,220
Oh!

2260
01:32:56,220 --> 01:33:00,300
You need 24 hours... in 24 hours... in 24 hours...

2261
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:01,960
We'll do it again.

2262
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,760
We'll do this... I'm sorry!

2263
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,960
I just saw the yellow pen and I was like, I have one already.

2264
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,020
Why would I get... I didn't realize the name was Toki.

2265
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,400
I didn't read!

2266
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:14,740
You guys know I don't read!

2267
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,620
You guys didn't know!

2268
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,460
I didn't know!

2269
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:20,680
I don't read at all!

2270
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:26,520
Oh my god, that's such really crazy.

2271
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,900
I can't believe I rejected myself.

2272
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,000
I can't believe it.

2273
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,880
Oh my god.

2274
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:33,740
That's so...

2275
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,500
Toki not reading again.

2276
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,320
But yeah.

2277
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,260
Oh my god, I just have like...

2278
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,540
Me and my...

2279
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,860
Me and my Neopet, Toki Drake.

2280
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,760
Wait, is plastic really good?

2281
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,740
Is that... is that really rare brush?

2282
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,600
What's wrong with plastic?

2283
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,180
What's...

2284
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:01,780
What...

2285
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,680
What is up with plastic?

2286
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,980
Toki Drake says, sigh.

2287
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,380
Wait!

2288
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:10,880
His name was plastic?

2289
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,240
Oh no!

2290
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,820
That was... that...

2291
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:17,860
That's a really... I didn't realize...

2292
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,560
Guys!

2293
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,650
I didn't realize!

2294
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:28,510
That's a high tier name!

2295
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,240
I don't know if you guys know this, but like real word names are actually so difficult to get.

2296
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,320
I just saw that it was a side button.

2297
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,880
I was like, oh, I don't really like that br...

2298
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,120
I don't really like that color.

2299
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,060
No!

2300
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,220
The tier list!

2301
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:48,260
The tier list!

2302
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Anyway, let's go to the Neobirds.

2303
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,020
I can't believe it.

2304
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,440
Oh my god!

2305
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,300
I don't read!

2306
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:01,880
No!

2307
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,860
I don't premium to chat with the cool people!

2308
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:11,360
Anyway, um, so this was basically where I...

2309
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,080
Where I used to hang out.

2310
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:16,280
I would hang out on the role-playing boards right here.

2311
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,860
This is where I would hang out.

2312
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,800
I would hang out there.

2313
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,700
And then I also would hang out...

2314
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,820
I hang out there and also like the general board.

2315
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:31,260
But like I'm a little worried what the general discussion is.

2316
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:38,220
How do you think Neopets.com has affected your brain?

2317
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:39,280
What?

2318
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,820
There's definitely some neurons that are going to connect just after we're like...

2319
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,040
I learned how to read and type at a lightning speed.

2320
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:51,840
That did not go with me.

2321
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:55,260
Um, Neopets brain rot!

2322
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:00,960
Alright.

2323
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,580
But yes, I used to hang out here.

2324
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,880
My Neopet just got stupider?

2325
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:10,170
What?

2326
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:13,550
Like father like son.

2327
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:17,930
Oh my god.

2328
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:19,170
Yes, this is...

2329
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:20,290
Um...

2330
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:21,910
Uh...

2331
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:24,070
This is where I used to...

2332
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:25,310
Uh...

2333
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:27,030
Used to hang out with.

2334
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,890
Uh, like hang out at.

2335
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:31,110
Here and also the role-playing boards.

2336
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:32,030
Um...

2337
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:32,830
So...

2338
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:33,330
Yeah.

2339
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:34,690
Um...

2340
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:35,510
It was fun.

2341
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:36,290
It was really...

2342
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,850
Oh, I'll show you the pounds.

2343
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:38,990
Neopets pounds.

2344
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:39,770
Where is it?

2345
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:40,710
Um...

2346
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:41,510
And see pet trading.

2347
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:42,030
Here you go.

2348
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,250
This is a tier list.

2349
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:45,530
Untaking name board.

2350
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:47,610
World Drake up for trade.

2351
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:50,130
Like there's like so many like...

2352
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:50,710
Uh...

2353
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:51,810
Up for auction.

2354
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:53,030
I told you!

2355
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:55,630
Drake's were like the rarest shit ever!

2356
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,990
Everybody was like, I want a Drake!

2357
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:58,790
I...

2358
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:05,210
Seeking feminine names starting with A.

2359
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:06,430
Uh...

2361
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:14,130

2362
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:15,790
Seeking.

2363
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:16,710
I don't know what...

2364
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:17,730
What is 4 to 6?

2365
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:18,990

2367
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:20,890
Okay.

01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,610
I don't even know some of these.

2369
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:26,230
I don't even know some of these names right now!

2370
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:27,230
Like...

2371
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,530

Oh, letters!

2375
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:37,270
Oh yeah, some people would like one specific letters as well.

2376
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:44,870
Any 3-5 letter female, real word, real name starting with A out there.

2377
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:46,030
Like, what?

2378
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:48,750
I don't know what that says.

2379
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:49,210
No!

2380
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:50,910
I rejected plastic!

2381
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:54,130
Plastic was worth so much!

2382
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,930
Oh my god!

2383
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,410
I can't believe it!

2384
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,170
I didn't read!

2385
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:05,850
I can't believe I didn't read!

2386
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:08,510
The fucking economy!

2387
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:15,510
This is just one guy...

2388
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:18,510
Whoa, whoa, that was scary.

2389
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,050
Whoa, I'm not moving anymore.

2390
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:22,750
Oh my god, that was so scary.

2391
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:23,910
I stopped moving.

2392
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:26,070
Oh my god!

2393
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:27,550
What happened?

2394
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:29,450
Oh my god!

2395
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,010
I froze!

2396
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,970
Can you guys still hear me?

2397
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:35,470
Oh my god!

2398
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:37,810
Sorry, I...

2399
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:41,110
I broke down just then.

2400
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:41,610
I don't...

2401
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:46,030
Oh my god!

2402
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:46,970
Fear!

2403
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:50,450
Oh my god!

2404
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:51,550
You guys can hear me!

2405
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:52,830
Okay, that's good to know.

2406
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:54,530
What the fuck happened?

2407
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:55,930
What happened?

2408
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:58,310
Oh, everything crashed.

2409
01:38:58,750 --> 01:38:59,730
That's what happened.

2410
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:01,530
That's what happened!

2411
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:02,870
Oh!

2412
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:05,250
Guys, guys...

2413
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:09,330
Wait, I've been doing this for two hours?

2414
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,510
Oh my god, I love Neopets so much, guys.

2415
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,930
Okay, I think...

2416
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:14,390
I think that was a good sign.

2417
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:16,070
I think that was a good sign, guys.

2418
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:16,650
I think...

2419
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,490
Oh my god, my OPS!

2420
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:20,690
Guys!

2421
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:22,610
Guys, my OPS fucked up!

2422
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,790
Guys, I'm gonna restart my OPS, guys.

2423
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:26,210
I can't even swap scenes.

2424
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:28,550
My OPS is fucked up!

2425
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:29,810
Alright, give me a sec!

2426
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:31,730
Give me a sec, we're in the void!

2427
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,190
I can't...

2428
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:36,510
I can't even swap scenes!

2429
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:37,810
Oh my god!

2430
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,870
Oh my god!

2431
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,450
Oh, that was crazy!

2432
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,550
That...

2433
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,970
Oh my god!

2434
01:39:44,110 --> 01:39:44,970
I'm back!

2435
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:45,710
Okay.

2436
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:48,530
Okay, before we...

2437
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:49,890
I forgot.

2438
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:51,710
I really wanted to show you guys this.

2439
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:53,350
The game section.

2440
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:54,810
Okay, some of my favorite games.

2441
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,610
Alright, we're so back, guys.

2442
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:56,970
Sorry!

2443
01:39:57,010 --> 01:39:57,850
I don't know what happened!

2444
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:00,430
My screen, like, flashed.

2445
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:03,430
Like, it was just flashed and then everything just stopped working.

2446
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:10,150
I had to, like, close my OPS and I had to close my, like... I had to close, like, like, a lot of stuff and then...

2447
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:11,450
and I had to reopen them.

2448
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:12,730
It was so weird!

2449
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:13,950
I don't know!

2450
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:15,590
I don't know what happened there.

2451
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:18,230
Alright.

2452
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,050
So, my favorite games.

2453
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,730
I will tell you guys what my favorite... Clicker.

2454
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:24,190
Like, there's a lot of the classic games in here.

2455
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:28,450
So, this is, like, some of my favorite games that I used to love.

2456
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,510
Also, like, you guys are wondering why my Doki Birds?

2457
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:33,030
Because, um...

2458
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:39,390
Um... Somebody took Doki Bird, like, on the day I came back.

2459
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:44,510
I don't...

2460
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:48,630
I don't know how they took...

2461
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:50,250
So then I went...

2462
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:53,510
I went... That's why I'm on Doki Birds.

2463
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:55,870
That's why that's my username.

2464
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:57,190
Um...

2465
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:03,230
They... They grabbed my username on the day I came back.

2466
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:04,870
So...

2467
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:07,030
That's why.

2468
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:09,470
Luckily, they did not take Doki Birds.

2469
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:11,930
So, I... Now I'm Birds.

2470
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:13,150
Now I'm plural form.

2471
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:15,470
But this was my favorite game of all time.

2472
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,130
Right there.

2473
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:16,830
Popular.

2474
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:17,970
This was literally...

2475
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:19,150
This is literally Snake.

2476
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,830
But, like, Mirka's.

2477
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:25,990
But I would play this so much as a... As a child.

2478
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:30,450
Like, this is literally one of my Neopets... Neopoint's farm games.

2479
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:32,470
And, like, oh my god.

2480
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:33,330
This is...

2481
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:35,530
Oh my god.

2482
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:36,570
I'm just looking at this.

2483
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:38,670
This is literally, like...

2484
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:39,690
Oh my god.

2485
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,350
This is actually memories right now.

2486
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:42,130
Like...

2487
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:42,270
Woo!

2488
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:43,570
Okay.

2489
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:44,450
Why?

2490
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:45,410
Why is it at the edge?

2491
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:46,990
Oh my god.

2492
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:49,730
Like, old classic Java games.

2493
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:52,410
And they work too.

2494
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:57,110
The fact that they work is actually... I'm so happy that these guys still work.

2495
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,030
Uh...

2496
01:41:58,030 --> 01:41:58,370
Woo!

2497
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:00,670
Oh my god.

2498
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:02,830
There's a lot of, like, really... No!

2499
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:03,990
Okay.

2500
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:06,190
I'm not as good as I was.

2501
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:07,370
I used to be really good!

2502
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:07,770
Okay?

2503
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:12,110
I used to be really, really really good at this...

2504
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:13,290
this game.

2505
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,030
Trust me.

2506
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:16,710
I used to be super good at this game, guys.

2507
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:19,610
Oh my god.

2508
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:20,590
Bouncy Supreme?

2509
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:22,630
I remember this.

2510
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:25,050
Jelly World's not real, by the way.

2511
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:25,590
Uh...

2512
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:28,370
Oh my god.

2513
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,270
Oh my god.

2514
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:31,490
Jelly World!

2515
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:34,170
Oh my god!

2516
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:36,890
This game!

2517
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:37,530
Oh!

2518
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,270
Oh!

2519
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:44,070
This used to be, like, a classic Flash...

2520
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:44,230
No!

2521
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,570
I used to be really good at this game, too.

2522
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:48,190
See?

2523
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,930
Oh my god.

2524
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:51,330
Okay.

2525
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:52,390
Okay.

2526
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:52,730
Whatever.

2527
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,250
It's like, actually...

2528
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:59,250
Oh my god.

2529
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:00,010
A classic.

2530
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:01,370
That's such a classic.

2531
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:02,170
Oh my god.

2532
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:02,470
I'm sorry.

2533
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:05,530
I'm going through, like, memory nostalgia lane at the moment.

2534
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:06,450
Um...

2535
01:43:06,450 --> 01:43:07,270
Popularity.

2536
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:11,270
A lot of the popular games are, like, people that, like, had so much happy memories.

2537
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:11,970
Like...

2538
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:13,230
Oh my god!

2539
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:13,910
Ice Cream Machine!

2540
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:17,490
I remember Ice Cream Machine!

2541
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,150
Guys, I also used to be really good at this game.

2542
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:23,910
Oh!

2543
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:26,810
So, like, basically, it's just avoid the ice cream.

2544
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:31,010
This was a really fun game to farm, like, meal points and stuff.

2545
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:34,150
So, um... They used to have, like, so many crossovers, too.

2546
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:34,850
Oh, shit.

2547
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:35,090
Sorry.

2548
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:36,090
I was looking at the screen.

2549
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:38,750
I was looking... Guys, I wasn't bad.

2550
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:39,690
I was looking at chat!

2551
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:43,010
You saw my... my eyes dart to the right.

2552
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:44,890
I was literally looking at chat.

2553
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:47,610
Oh my god!

2554
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:47,950
Oh, yeah.

2555
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,090
By the way, there's poker.

2556
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:50,870
So, like, you know...

2557
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:52,330
Wait, is that actual poker?

2558
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:54,690
Wait, does it...

2559
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:56,190
Notorious.

2560
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,890
We all know Pirates of the New World.

2561
01:43:57,970 --> 01:43:59,210
You guys try more... Oh, okay.

2562
01:43:59,290 --> 01:43:59,430
No.

2563
01:43:59,450 --> 01:43:59,790
Never mind.

2564
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:01,090
There's actual card games.

2565
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:01,610
I remember.

2566
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,510
Wasn't there card games?

2567
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:04,930
Yeah!

2568
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:05,390
There you go!

2569
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:05,810
Cheat!

2570
01:44:06,970 --> 01:44:07,590
There you go!

2571
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:10,030
So, here...

2572
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:12,730
You learn how to play cards.

2573
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:14,070
You learn!

2574
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:14,990
You learn!

2575
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,030
You learn!

2576
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:20,450
Um...

2577
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:22,190
I don't remember how to play this game.

2578
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:23,690
Sure.

2579
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:28,910
Uh... And then you have to, like, cheat about, like, what cards you have.

2580
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:31,470
Oh, they have black... Wait, they do have poker?

2581
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,990
Alright, I'm just gonna cheat right now.

2582
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:34,790
I have three.

2583
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:35,710
Yay!

2584
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:37,230
No one accused me of cheating!

2585
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:39,430
Alright.

2586
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:41,150
Play two eights.

2587
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:41,790
Oh, wait.

2588
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:42,510
You guys don't see this.

2589
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:44,510
I'm gonna accuse her of cheating.

2590
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:44,930
Yes!

2591
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:45,690
I caught it!

2592
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:46,050
Cheating!

2593
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:47,010
Oh, yeah!

2594
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:49,130
And then you win Neopets for catching the cheater.

2595
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:51,650
Um... Oh, yeah.

2596
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:53,130
And then it was, like, Solitaire and everything.

2597
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:53,630
Wait.

2598
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:55,910
So, like, if you guys don't know how to play...

2599
01:44:55,910 --> 01:45:00,770
If you guys don't know how to play card games, you can go to Neopets and play it legally.

2600
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:01,950
Um...

2601
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:02,810
Let's see.

2602
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:03,590
Where is poker?

2603
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:04,830
Was there actually poker?

2604
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,150
Oh, my God.

2605
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:08,410
I didn't realize there were actually poker.

2606
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:09,390
I just knew there were card games.

2607
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:10,250
I...

2608
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:13,250
I...

2609
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:19,170
I didn't even realize there was actually... Um... Yeah, it was basically bullshit.

2610
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:19,650
Oh, yeah.

2611
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:20,510
They have slots, too.

2612
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:21,130
Wait.

2613
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:21,850
Isn't that in...

2614
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:23,870
Uh... Isn't that in the Pure Historic?

2615
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,210
Where was the slots machine?

2616
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:29,910
I know, like, some of you guys who've never played Neopets before are, like... You can't be...

2617
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:31,870
Like, are you actually seeing real wor... No, there was!

2618
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,870
There was actual slot machines!

2619
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:36,510
There was, like, slot machines here.

2620
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:39,610
Uh...

2621
01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:40,870
Where was it, anyway?

2622
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:42,970
Where was the slot machines again, guys?

2623
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:45,730
Uh...

2624
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:46,890
Yeah, it was the desert.

2625
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:47,410
Oh, it was.

2626
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:47,970
It was the desert.

2627
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:48,610
I remember now.

2628
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:49,550
Alright.

2629
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:49,930
Anyway.

2630
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,230
There's poker here somewhere.

2631
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,510
I just don't remember where it was.

2632
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,330
I just don't know!

2633
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:59,290
Poker was here somewhere.

2634
01:45:59,550 --> 01:45:59,810
Okay.

2635
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:00,430
Let's see.

2636
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:01,810
Uh...

2637
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:03,790
Where was it?

2638
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:04,270
Okay.

2639
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:04,950
Explore.

2640
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:06,070
We gotta go to the desert.

2641
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:07,890
Lost desert.

2642
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,230
Oh, my chat's frozen.

2643
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:13,110
Okay, I'll fix it.

2644
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:13,730
I'll fix you guys.

2645
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:14,770
Don't worry!

2646
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:16,570
Doki can fix you!

2647
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:17,990
I can fix you.

2648
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:20,850
Give me a sec.

2649
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:23,590
Ba-ba-ba-ba-dum.

2650
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:24,550
Ba-da-da.

2651
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,750
Ba-ba-ba-ba-dum.

2652
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,350
Ba-ba.

2653
01:46:26,430 --> 01:46:27,390
Alright, so...

2654
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:29,630
I think it is here.

2655
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:31,370
The food stall.

2656
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:32,650
There's solitaire.

2657
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:35,370
Uh... There's the fruit machine!

2658
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:36,010
There you go!

2659
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:36,330
Alright.

2660
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:37,370
Oh, and there's a scratch card!

2661
01:46:37,630 --> 01:46:37,890
Yeah!

2662
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:41,790
Okay, so... You go to fruit machine, and then you spin...

2663
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,390
You can spin...

2664
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:46,350
You can spin this, so it's like slots.

2665
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:48,370
Yay!

2666
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,130
Did I win anything?

2667
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:52,610
Okay, no.

2668
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:54,070
Sorry, this is...

2669
01:46:54,070 --> 01:47:00,090
Oh, yeah, but they, like, limit... So, like, you know, they don't... They make sure to limit you, like, uh...

2670
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:01,210
one spin a day.

2671
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:04,930
Because, you know, they don't wanna... Oh, I wanna do scratch cards!

2672
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:05,770
Oh, my God!

2673
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:07,470
And they would have scratch cards, too!

2674
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:09,150
So, uh... Wait!

2675
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:10,950
Oh, wait!

2676
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:11,450
That's a jackpot!

2677
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:11,870
Fuck!

2678
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,090
Okay.

2679
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:13,450
Nooooo!

2680
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:16,310
Okay, we have... We...

2681
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,470
I can't do the scratch cards yet.

2682
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:22,410
Poker's Miradell?

2683
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,790
Okay.

2684
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:23,910
We're going to Miradell.

2685
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:25,250
We're going to Miradell.

2686
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,350
Miradell is...

2687
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:28,110
Oh, that's Brightvale.

2688
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,030
We're gonna go to Miradell.

2689
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:31,390
Where's Poker?

2690
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:34,190
Oh, by the way, this is the turtle racing.

2691
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:36,870
So, this is where the horse...

2692
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:40,490
the betting... the betting pages are.

2693
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:42,070
So...

2694
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:43,010
So...

2695
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:48,870
So, here is, like, we can see, like, um...

2696
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:50,510
Um...

2697
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:58,470
Um... You can make three bets a day, and then we can bet on the turtles, which is, like, the horses.

2698
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:01,330
So, you can be like, who do you wanna...

2699
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:05,890
And you can feed them enhanced items.

2700
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,850
And...

2701
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:07,110
And...

2702
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:10,710
So...

2703
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:13,390
So, technically, there's horse racing too.

2704
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:16,490
Let's go gambling!

2705
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:17,590
Oh, there it is!

2706
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:18,090

You gotta hand... Do I check, bet, or fold, guys?

01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:44,350
Guys, do I check, bet, or fold?

01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:47,510
I've never played poker before.

2717
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:48,550
I don't know how to play poker.

2718
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:50,130
Guys, I don't...

2719
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:51,690

01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:55,810
Okay, we're gonna check.

2722
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:57,430
You checked.

2723
01:48:57,850 --> 01:48:58,330
Um...

2724
01:48:58,330 --> 01:48:59,250
What happened?

2725
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:00,690
What did I check?

2726
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:03,150
I... Okay, continue.

2727
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:05,790
Alright.

Continue.

2730
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:10,890
Alright.

2731
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:11,990
He also checked.

2732
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:12,650
Continue.

2733
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:13,970
Alright.

2734
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,030
We're all checking.

2735
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:17,190
Alright.

2736
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:18,290
Oh!

2737
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,910
Nigel bet 10 NEO points.

2738
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:20,790
It's my turn.

2739
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:24,610
Do I... All in?

2740
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:26,570
Raise.

2741
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:27,650
I can't do all in.

2742
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:28,550
I can only raise.

2743
01:49:28,910 --> 01:49:29,490
I'll raise.

2744
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:31,430
Alright.

2745
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:33,110
I raised it to 20 NEO points.

2746
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,150
That's like 20 cents.

2747
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:35,450
Oh!

2748
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:38,070
They also bet 20.

2749
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:39,330
Everybody's betting 20.

2750
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:41,050
Are we doing good?

2751
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:44,810
First round betting complete.

2752
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:45,750
It's your turn to discard.

2753
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:46,770
Click the card to discard.

2754
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:47,530
Wait, what do I discard?

2755
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:50,690
Guys, what card do I discard?

2756
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,110
I've never played poker before.

2757
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:52,990
What card?

2758
01:49:57,890 --> 01:49:58,510
The two?

2759
01:49:59,050 --> 01:49:59,590
This one?

2760
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:00,310
Alright.

2761
01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:00,990
Discard.

2762
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:02,270
Nice.

2763
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:02,870
I got a 5.

2764
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,130
I got 5D.

2765
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:07,530
Alright.

2766
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:09,870
Discard 3 cards.

2767
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:11,350
Wait, you can discard more than one?

2768
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:14,610
Oh, I'm supposed to discard the other 5?

2769
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:17,250
Oh, a pair.

2770
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,230
Okay, we got a pair.

2771
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:19,090
We're doing it.

2772
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:20,070
Okay.

2773
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:21,290
Alright.

2774
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:23,310
Check, bet, or fold.

2775
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:25,430
Uh...

2776
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:30,650
Check.

2777
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:31,870
Alright.

2778
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:32,630
Checking time.

2779
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:34,050
Alright.

2780
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:34,990
We continue.

2781
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:36,290
Oh my god, guys.

2782
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:38,330
Guys, we're doing so well.

2783
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:40,110
Oh my god, they called 20 nil points.

2784
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:41,750
Oh, they fold it!

2785
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:42,010
Ha!

2786
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:42,990
What a loser.

2787
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:44,110
I can't believe.

2788
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:45,890
Oh, it's your turn to move.

2789
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:46,670
Call or raise?

2790
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:48,170
Call or raise?

2791
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:51,750
Call?

2792
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:54,050
Call.

2793
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:54,570
Okay.

2794
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:56,910
I called it.

2795
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:01,590
Second round is betting complete.

2796
01:51:01,730 --> 01:51:03,590
Show to see who wins the 230 plot.

2797
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:04,630
Do I win?

2798
01:51:06,330 --> 01:51:07,190
Guys, I lost.

2799
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:12,590
Guys, I thought you guys were good at this.

2800
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:22,970
Guys, I had so many people here to help me gamble.

2801
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:24,430
Like, what happened?

2802
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:32,350
What's this music?

2803
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:33,990
That's the music of my defeat.

2804
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:36,250
That's what it is.

2805
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:38,070
Wait, no, I don't want to do this again.

2806
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:40,230
My community sucks at poker.

2807
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:47,110
I don't know what I'm doing and they don't know how to play poker.

2808
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:54,210
Yo, wait.

2809
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:55,850
This hand was fire.

2810
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:57,570
Wait, that hand was good?

2811
01:51:57,690 --> 01:51:58,510
Oh, no!

2812
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:03,750
No!

2813
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:07,500
I need to flush?

2814
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:09,280
Oh my...

2815
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,420
Oh my god!

2816
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:15,640
You only stop when you're just about to hit the jackpot.

2817
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,960
You always desire it.

2818
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,900
I can't believe it.

2819
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,320
No!

2820
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,540
I'm so sad.

2821
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,420
It's time to spin the wheel.

2822
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,440
Yay!

2823
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:38,060
Yay!

2824
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:40,640
I just won back the money I lost.

2825
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,100
I cannot fail.

2826
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,160
I cannot fail.

2827
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:55,380
I literally won more money after leaving the table.

2828
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,240
Let's go!

2829
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,420
Let's go!

2830
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,280
No!

2831
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:04,820
Never punished!

2832
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,060
Never punished!

2833
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:14,100
I heard like Neopets has like a new TGC now too.

2834
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,760
Or TCG.

2835
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:17,560
Sorry, TCG trading card game.

2836
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:21,120
They also just announced a new trading card game which is really interesting too.

2837
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,360
I'm literally unnamed.

2838
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,260
Oh yeah, Kiko Lake.

2839
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:25,360
I'm so sorry.

2840
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:26,900
I'll show you how ugly the Kikos are.

2841
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:27,580
Look at this!

2842
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,700
They live in such an ugly house!

2843
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,920
Look at this!

2844
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,820
They're so like narcissistic!

2845
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:35,260
Their houses are just shaped like them!

2846
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:36,320
They're so...

2847
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:43,000
Look at how ugly this is!

2848
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,140
Who would wanna live here?

2849
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:48,600
Who would...

2850
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:51,100
so mean...

2851
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,100
Rude...

2852
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,180
They're like the only...

2853
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:57,700
They're like the only town...

2854
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,300
The only town...

2855
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,280
that has like houses that's just their faces.

2856
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:04,780
Nobody else has that!

2857
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:06,520
It's only them!

2858
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:11,000
Stop being such an anti!

2859
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:12,200
NEVER!

2860
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:15,640
I...

2861
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:24,500
Even if the Kikos gave everybody 5 billion dollars, I would still be the last hater alive.

2862
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,000
I'll be the last...

2863
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,200
I'll be the last Kiko hater alive!

2864
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,940
And JubJub too.

2865
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:37,520
Don't forget the JubJubs.

2866
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,300
That felt real.

2867
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,420
Leave the Kikos alone.

2868
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:48,960
Yeah, Kiko Lake has the worst Altador team!

2869
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,520
They have the worst Altador team in everything!

2870
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:53,720
Oh yeah, you can visit Santa.

2871
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:55,180
You guys wanna visit Santa?

2872
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:56,040
In Neopets Land?

2873
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,340
Wait, where's Santa?

2874
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:00,500
Santa used to live here.

2875
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,320
Where did he go?

2876
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:05,660
Wait, where did Santa go?

2877
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,540
Santa used to live here!

2878
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,560
Santa used to live here!

2879
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:10,580
What happened to Santa?

2880
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:11,820
What happened?

2881
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:17,720
Santa used to...

2882
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:18,720
Yeah!

2883
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:21,100
There was Santa in Neopets Land!

2884
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:21,900
It's July!

2885
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,500
Santa's eternal!

2886
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,280
Santa's eternal!

2887
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:27,980
Don't say that!

2888
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,580
Santa's eternal!

2889
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,740
He's here forever!

2890
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:42,820
Anyway, this is like the Christmas town in in in in the land of Neopets.

2891
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:44,220
in the land of Neopets.

2892
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,680
He's real in Neopets!

2893
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:46,760
You don't understand!

2894
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:49,240
He's real in Neopets!

2895
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,680
Where did I want to go?

2896
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:56,920
I don't remember where I wanted to go.

2897
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,880
Where I wanted to show you guys.

2898
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,640
Oh yeah, Altador!

2899
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,000
Here we go.

2900
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:02,840
This is Altador.

2901
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,680
This was like the...

2902
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:07,320
So the Altador Cup is gonna show up soon.

2903
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:09,800
Or is it...

2904
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:10,940
Altador...

2905
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:12,140
Oh, the legendary pet pets.

2906
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:13,200
Is there still any pet pets?

2907
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:13,560
No.

2908
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:14,800
God damn it.

2909
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:17,640
Alright, people will buy anything.

2910
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:19,100
Alright, let's see.

2911
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:19,900
The Altador Cup.

2912
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:20,780
Here we go.

2913
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,020
So you can see these are the teams and stuff.

2914
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:25,500
I am a full on...

2915
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:26,560
I'm a full on...

2916
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,200
Oh wait, you can't even see.

2917
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,820
You can't see the teams yet.

2918
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:35,480
Basically, to represent your team, you get free stuff too.

2919
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:35,920
From here.

2920
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,280
The Altador Cup is so fun to play.

2921
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:46,360
I remember grinding Altador Cup so much as a child because points matter.

2922
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:50,560
So like you have to play for your team.

2923
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,480
Look at Kiko.

2924
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:51,980
Like...

2925
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:54,080
Look at this guy.

2926
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,020
Your team is gonna fucking lose.

2927
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,760
Nobody likes you.

2928
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,520
I'll be your auntie forever.

2929
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:05,260
Kiko.

2930
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,900
Nothing will ever change my mind.

2931
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,060
Stop it.

2932
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,500
It's like...

2933
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:21,040
It's like soccer.

2934
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:22,460
There's always...

2935
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:26,180
You know like in soccer, there's always fans that hate a certain team.

2936
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:27,340
I'm that fan.

2937
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:30,780
Hollywood's for life.

2938
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,000
Hollywood's for life.

2939
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:42,040
Team Rural Island.

2940
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,660
I mean Rural Island is fun.

2941
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:45,140
Rural Island is really...

2942
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,920
Rural Island is Australia.

2943
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,780
It's basically Australia.

2944
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,240
So like...

2945
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:55,480
It's like a little island filled with these like bloomeroo's.

2946
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:56,240
That's what they're called.

2947
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:59,260
So they are basically...

2948
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:02,260
And they're ruled by a king called King Roo.

2949
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:03,540
So...

2950
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:05,680
They...

2951
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,000
Oh yeah.

2952
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:08,700
Kiko Lake.

2953
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:11,600
Was Kiko Lake known to always be last place?

2954
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:12,760
Was that it?

2955
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:15,520
Was that it?

2956
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,360
They've always...

2957
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:19,740
Kiko Lake has been last place for years.

2958
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,340
I don't know...

2959
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:22,580
I don't know who...

2960
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:25,220
Who decided to help them.

2961
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,660
Yeah, they never escaped the monarchy.

2962
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:35,460
Well to be fair, a lot of them are the monarchy.

2963
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:36,200
Wait, what's this?

2964
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,140
What team is this?

2965
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:41,380
What the... Who let this team in?

2966
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:49,040
After finally accepting the invitation to compete in the Altador Cup, um... team...

2967
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:50,720
Dacardia?

2968
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,920
Who are you guys?

2969
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,540
They discovered a new place?

2970
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:00,980
Oh, they're new!

2971
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:03,980
Oh!

2972
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,280
I'm like, who are you guys?

2973
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:09,640
I've never seen this map before.

2974
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:11,800
Um...

2975
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,280
It's the app.

2976
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,660
Team that promotes...

2977
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,060
Oh!

2978
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:17,160
It's a mobile game.

2979
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:20,140
Wait, they haven't introduced this yet.

2980
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,960
Like how like... Oh, there's like...

2981
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,160
Wait, they're all just like...

2982
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,160
Striped.

2983
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,660
They're all striped.

2984
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,000
And everything.

2985
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:32,220
Oh, there's some teams that haven't been reintroduced yet.

2986
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:33,300
Um...

2987
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:35,460
I was team Haunted Woods and Darigan.

2988
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,260
Oh my god, you guys are so badass.

2989
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2990
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:42,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2991
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:43,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2992
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:44,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2993
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:47,280
Um...

2994
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:48,860
So it's the JubJubs?

2995
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,720
The JubJubs!

2996
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:50,960
The JubJubs have no representation.

2997
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:53,480
Because they don't...

2998
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:54,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2999
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:56,660
I'm gonna stop.

3000
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,280
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3001
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,240
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3002
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:02,680
I don't know.

3003
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:03,940
They're in somebody's team.

3004
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,440
I don't remember which team they're in.

3005
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,440
I'm gonna...

3006
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:10,160
I actually don't know which team they're in.

3007
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:11,100
They're not captain.

3008
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:12,500
All these show the...

3009
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:16,860
All these show the other teams.

3010
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:19,820
But like... Like keep it... At least keep it like.

3011
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:20,540
Oh,

3012
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:25,580
Miradel has... Yeah.

3013
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:26,340
Miradel.

3014
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:27,740
Oh yeah, you're right.

3015
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,180
Miradel has the JubJubs.

3016
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:31,060
Yeah, I think the JubJub was like...

3017
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:31,540
I don't remember.

3018
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:33,360
Um, but yeah, there they...

3019
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,500
Wait, they kicked him.

3020
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,200
Oh, there he is!

3021
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:35,620
Look at him!

3022
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:36,280
He's so tiny!

3023
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:37,780
What is he gonna do?

3024
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:42,240
The Altar Cup is for people with hands!

3025
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:43,560
What are you gonna do?

3026
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,140
You can't kick a bot!

3027
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:46,280
The BOSS?

3028
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:54,860
You need to run!

3029
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,240
That's the boss.

3030
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:59,340
He is the boss.

3031
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,180
He's best.

3032
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:04,800
Don't disrespect this guy's feet.

3033
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:10,680
He is the boss.

3034
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:12,240
Keep moving.

3035
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:13,760
This is Drake neighborhood.

3036
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,100
Oh my god.

3037
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,860
All I'm saying...

3038
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:29,200
Boss, but he's the goalkeeper.

3039
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,260
You don't even have hands!

3040
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:38,200
I like how he's the goalkeeper.

3041
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:41,480
He's the goalkeeper, but like, you know...

3042
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:43,460
It's about like catching the ball.

3043
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:52,900
Oh my god.

3044
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,960
Oh my god.

3045
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,320
Anyway, I just don't like JubJubs.

3046
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,200
I just...

3047
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,460
I just personally don't like JubJubs.

3048
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,800
I just don't like...

3049
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,020
I just don't think that he's cute.

3050
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:08,840
Alright.

3051
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:12,180
Is it play...

3052
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:12,680
He can...

3053
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,460
JubJub is my Oshi.

3054
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:18,440
Um...

3055
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,380
I'm your Oshi's auntie.

3056
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:28,010
I'm a JubJub auntie.

3057
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:33,620
Anyway.

3058
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:34,760
It's funny.

3059
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:37,000
I think like Kiko Lake is like...

3060
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,860
I don't think...

3061
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,500
I think Kiko Lake is really funny.

3062
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:43,940
Because like, you can see that like...

3063
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:45,320
It's three Kikos.

3064
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,720
And then like... Why is there horses?

3065
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:48,740
Like...

3066
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:51,980
I thought...

3067
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:53,820
I think it's like...

3068
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:54,820
Really funny.

3069
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,160
Because it's like... It's all Kikos.

3070
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:58,180
And then two horses.

3071
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,120
Like the Uni.

3072
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,960
And then the... I forgot the other one.

3073
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:03,000
The other horse.

3074
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:03,880
The fish horse.

3075
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:04,800
And the land horse.

3076
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,740
I don't remember the fish horse's name.

3077
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:09,020
Um...

3078
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:10,280
The sea horses.

3079
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:10,740
Yeah.

3080
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,100
No, but they have a name!

3081
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,860
They have a name!

3082
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:15,540
I don't remember what they're called.

3083
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:16,940
The Piofins?

3084
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:17,380
Oh!

3085
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:18,120
The Piofins!

3086
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:20,240
Sorry, I never gave Piofins much attention.

3087
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,400
Because I...

3088
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:23,000
It wasn't like my favorite Neopet.

3089
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:24,140
Um...

3090
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,840
But yeah.

3091
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:27,180
I just thought it was really funny.

3092
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:29,160
Because it's like Kiko Lake.

3093
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:32,220
But like two of them are like not Kikos.

3094
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,160
Um...

3095
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,120
They do that a lot!

3096
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,260
They apparently did like team transfers too!

3097
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,320
Where like...

3098
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,360
They transferred people.

3099
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:43,840
Because it's like soccer!

3100
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,520
It's like...

3101
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:47,160
It's like soccer!

3102
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:48,740
Where it's like...

3103
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:52,760
They have like teammates transfer to like...

3104
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:53,920
A different...

3105
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,280
A different team and everything.

3106
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,420
So they're not like from that place.

3107
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:02,890
But yeah, this is...

3108
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:03,870
I love the Ultra Dirt Cup.

3125
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,770

Did I not?

3275
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,420
I looked at the Void Within.

02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:07,420
I was!

3277
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,460
No, I did!

3278
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:10,740
I looked at the Void Within.

3279
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:12,500
Did they just update it again?

3280
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:13,720
Like...

3281
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:15,140

02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:16,100
Wait!

3283
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:18,100
What did I miss?

3284
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:20,020
What did I miss?

3285
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,260
What did I miss in the Void Within?

3286
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,940
Okay, we're going back, guys.

3287
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:28,900

02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:31,560
I thought I did.

3290
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,160
What else did I miss?

3291
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,160
There was a surprise update?

3292
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:39,740
What happened?

3293
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:48,040
Guys, round 3 is over.

3294
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:48,160
Apparently...

3295
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:49,500
Apparently something happened.

3296
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,080
Sorry, we're back.

3297
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:53,460
We're back to the Void Within.

3298
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:54,840
Oh, it's just collect...

3299
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:56,060
I didn't collect all the Essence.

3300
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:57,400
You have to collect Essence, by the way.

3301
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,840
So there's like...

3302
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:02,380
You can see like some of the stories.

3303
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:03,220
Like what's happening.

3304
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:04,620
So like you get to explore.

3305
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:05,920
Wait, I did!

3306
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:07,140
I looked at the story.

3307
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:08,680
And everything.

3308
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:11,900
And then there's the boards of people talking about it.

3309
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:13,280
Do you want me to send you guys to battle?

3310
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,460
I'll do it.

3311
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:15,660
Oh...

3312
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:22,580
Do you guys really want me to send you...

3313
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:23,980
Okay, I'm gonna send you guys to battle.

3314
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:25,900
You guys wanted this.

3315
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:27,520
I'm gonna send you guys to battle.

3316
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,320
You guys wanted it!

3317
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,940
I said...

3318
02:12:32,940 --> 02:12:35,180
I said that...

3319
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:38,460
I don't know if you guys can handle the battle.

3320
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:39,240
Alright.

3321
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:41,260
So we're gonna go with...

3322
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:42,200
Advance.

3323
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:44,670
And then we're gonna fight these challengers.

3324
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:46,210
We're gonna fight these guys.

3325
02:12:46,330 --> 02:12:46,870
Right here.

3326
02:12:47,150 --> 02:12:48,130
And then...

3327
02:12:48,130 --> 02:12:48,990
I'm ready.

3328
02:12:49,770 --> 02:12:52,070
We're sending you in.

3329
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:55,570
Because you guys requested it.

3330
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:58,630
So I'm going to send...

3331
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:01,050
Can I plus this?

3332
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:03,490
Oh, my Neopets is...

3333
02:13:03,490 --> 02:13:04,730
You're too sick!

3334
02:13:05,150 --> 02:13:07,390
I can't believe it!

3335
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:13,790
You guys didn't have to fight because you're too sick!

3336
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:15,650
No!

3337
02:13:16,930 --> 02:13:18,190
We'll send the rabbit in.

3338
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:19,730
We're gonna send the rabbit in.

3339
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:20,130
Okay.

3340
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:22,110
Alright.

3341
02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:23,070
Wait, where's the...

3342
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:23,950
Void Within.

3343
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:25,930
Where did it go?

3344
02:13:26,830 --> 02:13:27,490
Oh, shit.

3345
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:28,210
I fucked it up.

3346
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:30,570
I fucked it up.

3347
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:30,950
Void Within.

3348
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:31,710
There it is.

3349
02:13:32,050 --> 02:13:32,530
Alright.

3350
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:36,630
No!

3351
02:13:37,390 --> 02:13:40,110
I wanted to send you guys in!

3352
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:42,850
I'm so sad.

3353
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:43,770
I'm so sad.

3354
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:44,790
I can't believe it.

3355
02:13:45,030 --> 02:13:47,330
They won't let me send you in, guys.

3356
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:48,470
I don't understand.

3357
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:50,690
Or so why not?

3358
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:54,750
Alright.

3359
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:56,110
It's time to fight.

3360
02:13:57,550 --> 02:13:58,070
Alright.

3361
02:13:58,730 --> 02:13:59,930
Find my next move?

3362
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:01,050
Oh, my god.

3363
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:01,830
This is new.

3364
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:04,930
I do this?

3365
02:14:05,290 --> 02:14:07,110
Oh, it's like rock, paper, scissors!

3366
02:14:07,610 --> 02:14:08,230
Oh, wait.

3367
02:14:08,230 --> 02:14:08,350
No.

3368
02:14:08,410 --> 02:14:08,770
I just...

3369
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:09,750
It's just rock.

3370
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:11,070
I can only punch it.

3371
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:13,250
Oh, I'm so dead.

3372
02:14:13,870 --> 02:14:14,430
Where...

3373
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:16,290
I'm so...

3374
02:14:16,290 --> 02:14:18,030
Holy shit!

3375
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:19,730
Oh, guys.

3376
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:20,690
It was one hit.

3377
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:26,550
Oops.

3378
02:14:26,810 --> 02:14:27,450
Alright, guys.

3379
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:29,070
I don't think I should have selected...

3380
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:31,730
I don't think I should have selected advanced, guys.

3381
02:14:32,050 --> 02:14:33,430
I don't...

3382
02:14:35,790 --> 02:14:37,670
I can't believe it.

3383
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:39,490
Why were you guys sick?

3384
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:41,890
Can't be me.

3385
02:14:42,170 --> 02:14:42,690
I don't...

3386
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:43,170
No.

3387
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:43,570
No.

3388
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:44,630
Did I got you guys?

3389
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:44,930
No.

3390
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:46,510
It can't be me, guys.

3391
02:14:46,850 --> 02:14:47,690
It can't...

3392
02:14:47,690 --> 02:14:48,690
Why did you pick advanced?

3393
02:14:48,850 --> 02:14:50,810
Because I thought I was gonna send the dragoons in.

3394
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:52,230
I was gonna teach them a lesson.

3395
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:54,810
They wanted to be on the battlefield.

3396
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:57,450
I was trying to teach them a lesson.

3397
02:14:57,630 --> 02:15:00,030
And then I ended up accidentally sending a...

3398
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:02,030
I had to send in a different neopet in.

3399
02:15:05,650 --> 02:15:07,550
I was just trying to teach you guys a lesson.

3400
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:07,830
Listen...

3401
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:13,650
Fix you guys!

3402
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:14,730
I'm too poor!

3403
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:17,090
I don't have enough money!

3404
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:22,450
Guys!

3405
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:27,310
I don't have enough money to buy medicine!

3406
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:27,930
Listen...

3407
02:15:34,070 --> 02:15:37,230
Guys, I can't even go to the soup kitchen!

3408
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:40,330
She's just gonna kick us out!

3409
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:44,330
I don't know why she thinks I'm too rich to go to the soup kitchen!

3410
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:47,110
It's so unfair!

3411
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:47,630
Look!

3412
02:15:48,070 --> 02:15:49,190
Every time!

3413
02:15:49,550 --> 02:15:54,510
You have only really poor Neopets can get hand...

3414
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:55,270
Wait!

3415
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:56,610
She's...

3416
02:15:57,310 --> 02:16:02,530
Only really poor Neopets can get handouts at the soup kitchen!

3417
02:16:10,090 --> 02:16:10,730
Sorry!

3418
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:11,990
I'm sorry guys!

3419
02:16:12,450 --> 02:16:13,290
I can't...

3420
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:14,170
Guys!

3421
02:16:14,510 --> 02:16:15,750
I can't!

3422
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:17,550
I can't feed you guys!

3423
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:18,090
Oh yeah!

3424
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:19,070
I forgot to show you guys!

3425
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:20,030
There's a hotel too!

3426
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:23,490
Let's see... Neopia Bazaar...

3427
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:25,310
So there's like... Where's the hotel?

3428
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:28,070
There used to be hotels here...

3429
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:30,030
Oh yeah!

3430
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:30,730
It's the Neolodge!

3431
02:16:30,890 --> 02:16:32,210
So you can place your...

3432
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:35,250
So you can place your favorite Neopets...

3433
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:36,370
To like...

3434
02:16:37,330 --> 02:16:38,290
To like...

3435
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:40,790
The hotel...

3436
02:16:40,790 --> 02:16:41,990
And then like...

3437
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:44,610
So they can get pampered and everything...

3438
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:46,770
But like... I can't afford it so...

3439
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:47,030
Oh yeah!

3440
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:48,010
There's like...

3441
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:51,970
One of them is called Cockroach Towers...

3442
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:52,370
And it's...

3443
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:53,350
Do you guys wanna be in a hotel?

3444
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:54,170
Guys?

3445
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:55,590
You guys wanna...

3446
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:03,030
I can take you guys to Cockroach Towers!

3447
02:17:03,350 --> 02:17:03,810
Alright!

3448
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:05,510
There's...

3449
02:17:05,510 --> 02:17:06,330
There's...

3450
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:07,450
There's like...

3451
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:08,470
Astro Villa...

3452
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:10,690
But 500 is a little bit too much...

3453
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:12,490
So we're gonna go with 5 Neopoints...

3454
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:14,290
And we're gonna give you...

3455
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:16,110
A day!

3456
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:17,390
There you go!

3457
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:17,990
Yes!

3458
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:19,490
So there's like 1 to 2 stars...

3459
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:20,410
Oh wait!

3460
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:21,870
Does it show you like...

3461
02:17:21,870 --> 02:17:22,730
Example rooms?

3462
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:24,170
Oh my god!

3463
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:26,970
That's so funny!

3464
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:29,590
It actually shows you guys like...

3465
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:31,810
What the hotel rooms look like!

3466
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:37,770
Alright!

3467
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:38,690
Alright guys!

3468
02:17:38,970 --> 02:17:39,650
You're lucky!

3469
02:17:39,770 --> 02:17:41,530
Guys you're lucky I won the...

3470
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:43,970
I won the spinning wheel thing!

3471
02:17:44,350 --> 02:17:47,210
I got 2500 dollars!

3472
02:17:47,710 --> 02:17:50,710
So I can book you one night in Cockroach Towers!

3473
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:51,350
Fine!

3474
02:17:51,390 --> 02:17:51,670
Fine!

3475
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:53,130
I'll get you the Flea Pit Motel!

3476
02:17:53,630 --> 02:17:55,430
I feel a little generous right now!

3477
02:17:55,490 --> 02:17:56,950
I like how one of them is called Cheap Hotel!

3478
02:17:57,770 --> 02:17:58,290
Guys!

3479
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:01,070
I feel extra generous today!

3480
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:03,330
So I'm gonna put you at the Flea Pit Motel!

3481
02:18:03,810 --> 02:18:05,150
I'll book you guys in!

3482
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:06,130
There you go!

3483
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:08,950
Your hotel bill is as follows...

3484
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:10,250
This will be deducted...

3485
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:11,870
10 cost of extra...

3486
02:18:11,870 --> 02:18:12,630
Cost per night...

3487
02:18:12,630 --> 02:18:13,450
10 Neopoints...

3488
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:14,610
Oh my god!

3489
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:15,710
I broke the bank for you!

3490
02:18:15,810 --> 02:18:16,150
Oh!

3491
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:24,550
Oh my god!

3492
02:18:24,690 --> 02:18:26,050
We're gonna have to like...

3493
02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:27,730
We're gonna have to like...

3494
02:18:27,730 --> 02:18:28,290
Um...

3495
02:18:28,290 --> 02:18:30,350
Cut on some of our expenses...

3496
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:31,070
Dragon...

3497
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:32,770
But I hope you enjoyed the hotel!

3498
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:33,670
I hope you...

3499
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:39,250
I hope you enjoy it!

3500
02:18:39,310 --> 02:18:42,010
We might not be able to have dinner tomorrow...

3501
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:42,550
But...

3502
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:43,250
Um...

3503
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:44,430
But it'll be worth it!

3504
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:48,310
You have 2 million points!

3505
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:54,610
Okay...

3506
02:18:54,610 --> 02:18:55,210
Alright!

3507
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:55,650
Yay!

3508
02:18:55,650 --> 02:18:57,430
We sent you to the hotel!

3509
02:18:57,870 --> 02:18:58,490
Alright...

3510
02:18:58,490 --> 02:18:58,970
Alright...

3511
02:18:58,970 --> 02:18:59,590
I think we're good!

3512
02:19:00,430 --> 02:19:00,770
Yeah!

3513
02:19:01,150 --> 02:19:02,190
That was fun!

3514
02:19:03,450 --> 02:19:04,130
Um...

3515
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:06,430
That was a lot of fun!

3516
02:19:06,710 --> 02:19:07,330
Um...

3517
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:08,010
I really...

3518
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:09,010
Really did...

3519
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:09,830
Um...

3520
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:13,670
I really did enjoy showcasing you guys...

3521
02:19:13,670 --> 02:19:14,430
Um...

3522
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:15,690
All the Neopets stuff!

3523
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:16,970
And...

3524
02:19:16,970 --> 02:19:17,470
Uh...

3525
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:18,650
And I really enjoyed...

3526
02:19:19,170 --> 02:19:19,670
Um...

3527
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:20,250
Just like...

3528
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:20,570
You know...

3529
02:19:20,570 --> 02:19:23,030
Going through like nostalgia and everything...

3530
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:24,490
I hate the Rulicans!

3531
02:19:24,710 --> 02:19:25,550
Oh my god!

3532
02:19:25,550 --> 02:19:25,630
I hate them!

3533
02:19:25,650 --> 02:19:25,810
I...

3534
02:19:26,530 --> 02:19:28,150
The Ruligan...

3535
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,310
I talked about The Void!

3536
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:36,270
What do you mean?

3537
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:39,530
And...

3538
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:40,450
Um...

3539
02:19:40,450 --> 02:19:42,390
The reason why I went more so of like...

3540
02:19:42,390 --> 02:19:44,490
I wanted to be more beginner-friendly too...

3541
02:19:44,490 --> 02:19:45,750
Because I feel like...

3542
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:46,290
Um...

3543
02:19:47,650 --> 02:19:49,210
The Void within...

3544
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:49,910
Um...

3545
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:53,890
You definitely need to know a lot more about like Neopets in general.

3546
02:19:54,590 --> 02:19:55,150
And...

3547
02:19:55,150 --> 02:19:55,630
Um...

3548
02:19:55,630 --> 02:20:03,010
I definitely know more about what's going on in Neopets because a lot of you guys might be looking into Neopets or coming back to Neopets after years and years and years.

3549
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:14,070
So I wanted to make it more beginner-friendly for you guys and just go through the introduction of everything, like introducing bits and parts of Neopets just to build up.

3550
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:20,850
The Voidwave Inn, the plotline, definitely you need to have more... you gotta explore the rest of Neopets.

3551
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:25,110
The rest of Neopets a lot more.

3552
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:31,150
And I really highly, highly suggest checking out the old plots as well, the old comics and everything.

3553
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:38,850
Because there's so much lore into it, there's so much that went into building up to this main plot that they're doing right now.

3554
02:20:39,610 --> 02:20:43,310
And they've worked incredibly... oh, sorry, the double BGM, sorry.

3555
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:48,130
They worked so hard in setting this up.

3556
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:50,670
They haven't done plots.

3557
02:20:50,850 --> 02:20:51,450
They haven't done plots in a long time.

3558
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:57,870
So this is like their... one of their biggest ones in a very, very long time.

3559
02:20:58,130 --> 02:21:01,170
Huge shoutout again for Neopets for the sponsor.

3560
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:02,410
I'm so happy.

3561
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:07,070
I can't believe I got paid to talk about Neopets.

3562
02:21:09,050 --> 02:21:10,490
I'm really, really happy.

3563
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:18,050
But I hope you guys give a lot of support to Neopets and follow them in their socials.

3564
02:21:18,050 --> 02:21:20,670
I gave a link to each of their socials in the description.

3565
02:21:20,850 --> 02:21:24,450
Join their Neocash campaign.

3566
02:21:25,190 --> 02:21:28,210
150k Neocash is a lot of real money.

3567
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:38,350
It's basically real money in Neopets where you can buy more cosmetics and unlock some premium features in Neopets.

3568
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:42,210
So I highly suggest joining the campaign if you want to invest more into it.

3569
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:45,970
And I want to see if you're lucky enough to win the campaign.

02:21:48,810 --> 02:21:50,830

3579
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:14,110
And there is a lot of lore and a lot of like games and like...

3580
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:16,510

And I'm really excited because like they're planning on adding more...

3582
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:22,030

02:22:27,950 --> 02:22:31,070
And wanting to revitalize the community again.

3586
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:33,450
So I hope you guys check it out.

3587
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:34,550
Oh my god it was so fun.

3588
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:35,750
I had so much fun though.

3589
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:36,410
It really was.

3590
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:40,290

Again let's thank Neopets again.

3593
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:48,750
Um...

3594
02:22:49,490 --> 02:22:50,430
Thank Neopets again.

3595
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:53,190
I'll make a tweet after about more of the details.

3596
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:54,810
But please check out the Void Within.

3597
02:22:55,450 --> 02:22:55,810
Um...

3598
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:58,590
If you want to come back to Neopets check out the new plot line.

3599
02:22:58,670 --> 02:23:00,450
For those who are like veteran Neopets players.

Posture check.

3608
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:14,050
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3609
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:15,250
And if you stay up for me.

3610
