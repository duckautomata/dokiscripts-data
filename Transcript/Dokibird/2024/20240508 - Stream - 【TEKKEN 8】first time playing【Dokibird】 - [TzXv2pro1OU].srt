1
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,750
Oh my god, the first challenge, oh sorry, I was late.

2
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,210
The first challenge was getting this game to fucking work on
PC.

3
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:05,650
I was just like, I spent an hour just trying to fucking
figure out how to get this game to run.

4
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,190
And then, thank god you guys, I should have asked you guys
for help in the beginning.

5
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,930
Because I was just like, how?

6
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,970
How do I, how do I make this work?

7
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,250
Oh, so I've never seen this intro.

8
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,650
So I guess we watched this intro.

9
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,690
Look, there's a pretty bird.

10
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,550
That's me.

11
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,570
I'm that bird.

12
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,290
Oh.

13
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,330
Oh, oh, oh.

14
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,650
Oh, my God.

15
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,210
Who are all these characters?

16
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,570
The only guy I know is, like, king.

17
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,090
Because he's, like, half Jaguar or some shit.

18
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,470
Bum.

19
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,510
Oh, my God.

20
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,550
This song is hype.

21
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,690
The sound guy here.

22
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,470
Yeah, I had to do admin mode.

23
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,750
And then compatibility.

24
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,550
That's how we had to do this.

25
00:02:50,850 --> 00:03:05,330
It was the first challenge The first challenge in this game
All right, sound god good you're here I don't know any of

26
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,790
these characters I'm literally going in blind as a

27
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:22,350
I'm going in fucking blind I have overall 10 minutes of
Tekken gameplay over in the series in general fighting game

28
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:29,230

I was like that was a little jockey playing the marvel slash

33
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,650
He has a gun.

34
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,210

35
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,550

Thank you.

38
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,270
The lore about Tekken is about a very dysfunctional family
and daddy issues.

39
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,690
Being played as a panda and a space samurai.

40
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,550

Thank you, thank you.

72
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,430
Correct me if I'm wrong, but 1 equals X, 2 equals Y, A
equals 3, and 4 equals B.

73
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,090
Also, King has a couple of grads that do a ton of damage and
newbies cannot break.

74
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,190
Thank you for the super chat.

75
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,170

For those who also don't know, I also got invited to the
Nokia Apex Tournament.

78
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,730
I knew about this for a while now.

79
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,990
I was just waiting for it to be announced.

80
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,550
They even sent me like a welcome package.

81
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,270
Like they said, everybody who's participating.

82
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,930
A welcome package.

83
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,370
I haven't received it yet.

84
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,990
But I won't spoil who the team is.

85
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,090
Who's in my team.

86
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,710
We have a team going in already.

87
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,710
It's a hide and seek tournament too, by the way.

88
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,430
Yeah, I just retweeted it.

89
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,250
I just quote retweeted it.

90
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,610
But we got invited to a Nokia hide and seek Apex Tournament.

91
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,470
That's happening at the end of the month.

92
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,670
You guys are going to find out who's on my team later on.

93
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,890
Whenever it's revealed, I have no idea when it's going to be
revealed.

94
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,630
I didn't.

95
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,550
I just found out they tweeted it out today.

96
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,310
And then they were like, oh, quote retweet it when you can,
guys.

97
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,830
So I was like, okay, I'll do my part.

98
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,150
I'm going to do my part.

99
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:06,690
But it's okay.

100
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,510
There's a lot of pro players in there.

101
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,830
But like, it's hide and seek.

102
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,290
So it's like, what are you going to do?

103
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,070
Hide better?

104
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,810
Like, if anything, I'll just follow where the pros are
hiding and then grief them if I have to.

105
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,410
Yeah, this is the one that this guy's toast and wig is
hosting.

106
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,430
Yeah.

107
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,030

And as thank you.

117
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,890
The fighting game bell curve means by having zero
experience, you might beat many with limited experience.

118
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,170
Thank you.

119
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:43,670

This boosts your attack power and you'll be able to use your
rage with RT.

209
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,650
Okay.

210
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,850
Maybe I shouldn't be in quick match.

211
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,010
Fight against a CPU opponent to calculate your starting
rank.

212
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,810
This will be dedicated based on your performance in battle.

213

233
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,710

I can't tell if it's crashed or not!

244
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,490
Yeah, guys, I actually can't tell.

245
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,270
I crashed.

246
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,710
Never mind, I can tell.

247
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,550
No.

248
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,010

250
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,970
to like watch it a little bit.

251
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:14,850
I was fun Guys, we got we got into the menu that was pretty
fun guys The game stopped me from going into Quick Match

252
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:26,810
Even the game knew it was a bad idea was like don't keep
please play the tutorial i was like but what if though but

253
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:34,130
when if i go straight in you learn the hard way you know
it's like when those mama birds push their babies off a

254
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:47,170
cliff to be like if you don't fly you die that type of deal
that's me if i don't fly i die look the best thing about

255
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:58,890
having overall 10 minutes of Tekken knowledge is that
there's zero expectations of me so and I'm okay with that

256
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:10,830
I'm okay with zero expectations unlucky thank you for the
super chat thank you thank you who is that Doki's first

257
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:19,650
actual battle in Tekken is with Tekken itself okay we just
need to get past like the we just need to get past the

258
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:31,870
fucking rain menu like all right here we go you turn down
the graphics i feel like i should that sounds very important

259
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:43,290
actually maybe that's why i crashed i i didn't turn down
anything i just went straight in All right, we got to turn

260
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:51,050
down the music and then also I already brought it up overall
Guys, I didn't have time to set up my new PC.

261
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,990
I've been so busy

262
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,910
Great start What do you think of the game so far?

263
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:07,930
I mean with my limited not limited experience with my only
experience being the main menu It seems pretty cool, you

264
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:22,550
know It's only been in the game menu but like other than
that seems pretty fine all right um bgm okay there you go

265
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:37,430
that should be good right where's the graphic settings am i
in ultra mode oh okay okay that that makes a little more

266
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:43,230
sense all right all right here we go Yes.

267
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,310
That's a yes, I am.

268
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,490
All right, what else do I need?

269
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,890
Do I put on medium?

270
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,110
I think medium sounds like the best area to be in.

271
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,710
So, like, that seems right.

272
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,450
That seems a lot better.

273
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:58,970
All right.

274
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,070
All right.

275
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,890
I'll bring it up a little bit more.

276
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,410
Okay, I'll bring up the sound volume a little more.

277
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,150
Let me know if it's better sound, guy.

278
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,670
I brought up the sound a little bit more.

279
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,090
Right, rendering scale, uh, view sync off.

280
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,670
Okay, V-Sync off.

281
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,750
Where's V-Sync?

282
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,570
Okay, there you go.

283
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,830
Anything else that I should do?

284
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,190
Medium is premium.

285
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,630
All right, remove shadows.

286
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,090
Do I not need shadows?

287
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,490
Okay, shadow.

288
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,230
All right, there you go.

289
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,750
That should be fine now, right?

290
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,830
We should be good.

291
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,970
Now we don't have to see the pure sweat from this guy.

292
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,570
I'm dripping out.

293
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,610
Oh, I need a bite.

294
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,590

I need a bite, Eddie.

296
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,370
If all else fails, I have Eddie.

297
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,910
All right, tech and shop.

298
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,310

299
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,990
I'm going to the shop now.

300
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,590

302
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,590
Okay, I just need to buy the DLC, right?

Wait, how do I...

305
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,110

349
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,140

Am I watching?

402
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,760
There are no winners.

403
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,060
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is that I've managed...

404
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,360
Oh my god, this guy's S+.

Oh my god, it's Hitman!

408
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,020
Wait, that's so cool!

409
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,660
The customization is crazy.

410
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,640
Alright, I brought up the volume more now, sound guy.

411
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,880
Alright, here we go.

412
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Oh, shit!

413
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,520
How do I get rid of the chat?

414
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,480
Chat display.

415
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,520
Oh, there we go.

416
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,580
Alright.

417
00:28:53,740 --> 00:29:04,820
If you lose this victory, bad oh my god look oh my god bro
look at him okay look at that look at kaiser fucking look at

418
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,720
that this guy actually plays the game and look at how much
he's losing

419
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:23,840
too costly i took a round off these two oh my god never mind
wait these guys are equal these guys are like equal man

420
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,080
you're fp i feel like Maybe I should go low.

421
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,860
The frames is pretty bad.

422
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,700
Holy shit.

423
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,540
I feel like they know what they're doing.

424
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,240
Because they're actually blocking.

425
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,640
I feel like...

426
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,940
Oh my god.

427
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,100
They actually know what they're doing.

428
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,280
They're like figuring out each other's combos.

429
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,620
How do you...

430
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:06,080
they do that set up the pc but it's so much work and i have
so much other work to do

431
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:17,600
no keep but i was very clear on what i was doing oh my god i
told you guys if i button mash nobody will know what i'm

432
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,960
doing they can't like counter they can't counter me if they
don't know my patterns

433
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,880
So he said it.

434
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,240
All I need to know is how to block.

435
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,060
I feel like if I realize...

436
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:38,100
I feel like if I realize how to block and then I button
mash, things will be okay.

437
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,880
The more you play, the less frame drops you will get.

438
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,680
Oh, okay.

439
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,660
It's still compiling.

440
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,140
Okay.

441
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,840
But did you win the set?

442
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,860
I've got two rounds off of him.

443
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,480
That's all I'm saying.

444
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,780
Hold back to block.

445
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,420
Oh, okay.

446
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,940
Hold back to block.

447
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,500
Oh, shit.

448
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,660
He's getting absolutely destroyed.

449
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,320
Oh my god.

450
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,040
Guys, maybe I'm meant to be purple rank.

451
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,960
Maybe I'm meant to be a flame slash mighty ruler.

452
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,440
Hold on back to block.

453
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Alright.

454
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,860
Alright guys.

455
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,800
Guys, have fun in this custom lobby.

456
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,080
I'm going to do the tutorial for real now.

457
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,720
Guys.

458
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,540
Leave session.

459
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,160
Sorry guys.

460
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,820
I'll see you later.

461
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,120
I apparently have to Whoa!

462
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,180
I got money!

463
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,420
I got million Gs!

464
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,680
Whoa!

465
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,380
Apparently I should actually know how to play this game.

466
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,600
Alright, what is the tutorial?

467
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,920
Is it the story?

468
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,280
Or is it offline?

469
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,320
Is it arcade quest?

470
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,560
Practice through an exciting For apparently I actually have
to learn.

471
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,580
This mode training arc begins.

472
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
Is arcade quest?

473
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,880
Arcade quest?

474
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,280
Okay, arcade quest.

475
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,220
Okay, I got this.

476
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,580
Okay, but for real, like, what do I actually play?

477
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,460
Do I actually go full?

478
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,900
Do I commit to the Eddie?

479
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,700
Or do I play King?

480
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,600
Because apparently King is also, like, good to...

481
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,140
Good at destroying noobs, too.

482
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,300
And I'm a noob as well.

483
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,300
So if I destroy the other noob first, then I win.

484
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,780
Play whoever looks cool.

485
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,700
But I want to play whoever is meta.

486
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,500
I want to play whoever I can use as a crutch.

487
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,600
Whichever character I can use as a fucking crutch.

488
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
That's all I want.

489
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,720
There's always plenty of smiles and sounds of button
clacking.

490
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,160
King, Eddie, okay.

491
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,800
All right, thank you for the gifted shit.

492
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
Thank you, thank you.

493
00:32:59,530 --> 00:32:59,710
see.

494
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,750
There is no meta.

495
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,930
The meta will change on May 9th.

496
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,450
Well, thank God the tournament.

497
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:05,810
Wait.

498
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,210
Isn't it May 9th?

499
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,690
Oh, wait.

500
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,490
It's already.

501
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,130
It's not May 9th.

502
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,210
Uh.

503
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,990
Do not play King.

504
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,250
As long as I can grab.

505
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,650
Is that all that matters?

506
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,390
As long as I can grab somebody.

507
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,890
I might not know what I'm doing, but I can grab someone.

508
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,950
King is hard.

509
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:29,810
late.

510
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,350
Meta this, meta that.

511
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,370
But have you ever met a girl before?

512
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,710
Thank you for the super chat.

513
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,010
Thank you.

514
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,630
Thank you.

515
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,850
Where's your pal at?

516
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,730
They're supposed to be.

517
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,390

550
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,750
Oh, what kind of hairstyle would work?

551
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,430
I guess this.

552
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,070
And then, oh yeah, this works.

553
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,730

And this is a dragon.

559
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,530
It's a dragon.

560
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,710
What are you saying?

561
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,570
Now you guys have to, like, root for me.

562
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,150
Because if you, if I lose, you lose.

563
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,870
All I'm saying, if I lose, you lose, because I'm playing as
you.

564
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,070
Okay.

565
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,450

568
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,890
What is the...

569
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,630
Oh, there's a beauty mark.

570
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,790
Uh...

571
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,950
Okay, wait, wait.

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,430
Do I want...

573
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,150
Let's see.

574
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,070
Actually, we'll do this one.

575
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:54,890
Yeah.

576
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:55,850
And then...

577
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,790
Yeah.

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,370
Perfect.

579
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,150
That's you.

580
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,090
It's you.

581
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,350
It's you.

582
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,690
It's the dragons.

583
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,530
Yeah.

584
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:12,430
All right.

585
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,610
What do we want you to wear?

586
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,530
Cover everything up.

587
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,590
No, I worked so hard for this.

588
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,070
Oh, I can have hats too.

589
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,410
No, we can't cover this.

590
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,710
We can't cover this.

591
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,490
Okay, let's see.

592
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,790

Oh, wait, we should have a different...

595
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,590

596
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,490
Let's see.

597
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,130
Oh, my God.

598
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,950
You guys can be edgy.

599
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,530
Do I have money?

600
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,390

00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,570
What do you want for your pants?

610
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,690
I mean, I have a million dollars.

611
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,450

612
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,970

Okay.

616
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,490
Are you thinking about what pants to wear?

617
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,770
Ooh, short shorts.

00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:11,910

Yeah, it's sitting outside my room.

682
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,020
I haven't even unboxed it yet.

683
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,540
I just didn't have the time to set up.

684
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,940
That was so busy.

685
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,420

Thank you.

696
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,800
All right, we're going to lower the quality a little bit.

697
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,320
Maybe it's the graphics.

698
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,560
Maybe.

699
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,540
Okay, medium.

700
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,880
What else do we lower?

701
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,500

It's just loading.

749
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,860
It's just loading.

750
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,740
Your PC is actually dying.

751
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,580
We're so...

752
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,660

753
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,440
You're not ugly.

754
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,380
It's like the most accurate representation.

755
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,680
Trust the problem.

756
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,500
It's okay.

757
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,760
Just trust.

758
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,660
We didn't crash.

00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,060
It's just loading.

760
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,060

It's not crashed.

763
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,360
Guys, Tekken 8 has baited me so much.

764
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,250
It's just bait.

765
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:43,390
If all else fails, I'll just use the PlayStation version of
Tekken.

766
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,110
I just asked.

767
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,250
No, it can't have crashed.

768
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,790
There's no way.

769
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,450
Please, at least let me...

770
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,650
Alright, we're gonna do a window mode.

771
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,910
Why does it take forever to load?

772
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,270
I don't understand.

773
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,050
Alright, guys.

774
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,870
Alright, guys.

775
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,990
We're gonna read...

776
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,330
Guys, we might have crashed.

777
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,790
Or it might have been...

778
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,810
We might...

779
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,810
I think you guys were right.

780
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,110
We should have done windowed mode.

781
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,730
You know, it's funny that...

782
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,070
You know what's great, guys?

783
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,230
We gotta play...

784
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,390
We gotta play, like, one match.

785
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,850

00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,450

853
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,360
Oh my god.

854
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,420
Did I do it?

855
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:58,940
Yeah!

856
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,960

858
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,760

stick

859
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:26,870
that pc is heading to the like dpad oh okay because i was
using the analog stick okay now i know actually that means

860
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:33,970
losing your own health is bad yeah of course you beating me
up?

861
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,970
I hold you can... Oh, that's how you block!

862
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,470
I figured it out.

863
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,350
Try to block and hack.

864
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:42,890
Boom!

865
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:44,450
Boom!

866
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:45,370
Oh, wait.

867
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:46,970
Boom!

868
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,150
There we go.

869
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,610
I figured out how to block.

870
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:52,890
Look at me go.

871
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,330
Alright, now I know what you're thinking.

872
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,710
You stand there and block everything.

873
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,450
You never lose.

874
00:50:59,570 --> 00:50:59,890
Yeah!

875
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,490
But there's an issue of low attacks and throws that can't be
blocked using.

876
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:09,370
Oh, so I have to block, uh, I have to, like, go down.

877
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:09,870
Okay.

878
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,550
You can use a crouching.

879
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,010
Okay.

880
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,230
To do a crouching block.

881
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,030
Okay.

882
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:14,970
I got it.

883
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,710
Try to block a low attack.

884
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:17,370
Boom.

885
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,490
Boom.

886
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,050
Boom.

887
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,210
Just block everything.

888
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,150
If I block everything, they can never do damage.

889
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:25,470
Yeah!

890
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,230
That's right.

891
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:28,710
Woo!

892
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,690
Perfect.

893
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:30,970
Perfect.

894
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,190
I lay out the base I did it!

895
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,690
Alright, checking the heat system.

896
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:37,310
What's this?

897
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,570
Now I'm going to teach you about the heat.

898
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,450
A super important battle system.

899
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,710
You notice that you have another gauge besides the health
gauge?

900
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,930
That's the heat timer.

901
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,790
When you have a heat timer, it means you're able to activate
heat.

902
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,430
You start every round in this state.

903
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:50,430
How do I do that?

904
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:52,690
RB.

905
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:53,530
Okay.

906
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:55,690
Oh!

907
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,410
Heat activated.

908
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,050
You can see the timer looks different now.

909
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,050
Your character is stronger if heat activated.

910
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:09,930
there is a time limit so you don't stay strong forever so
you can use it once per round so timing is key oh that's

911
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:21,330
easy i'll just use in the beginning y'all swim moves are
only available when he try busting out a heat smash now that

912
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,330
is nice

913
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,470
all right

914
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:35,950
he smashes it ends in the only good thing about heat state
you can only add you can also get the added bonus of chip

915
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:46,850
damage with all your moves your opponent's oh so they can't
block my moves technically i see recommended air combo when

916
00:52:46,850 --> 00:53:00,550
he activation activated what the fuck checking is all about
the air combo and then what is that it no wait Did I do it?

917
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,020
He activated during...

918
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,380
What?

919
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,240
Okay, wait.

920
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,780
And then I do it again?

921
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:12,800
Oh!

922
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,620
Okay, I forgot to press it the second time.

923
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,460
Alright.

924
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,480
I'm learning.

925
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,360
I didn't read the last half.

926
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,480
They got me in the first half.

927
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,140
Not gonna lie.

928
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,580
Master the balances.

929
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,400
Next you have to pick a character and get fighting.

930
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:26,940
Okay.

931
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,500
They got me in the first half.

932
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,320
All right, my game crashed.

933
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,120

I was so ready.

937
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:59,640
I was about to pick everything.

938
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,560

We don't need the good graphics, guys.

948
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,800

We're on the quality sector.

965
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:17,620
Okay.

966
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,020

Oh, wait.

969
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,720

Performance.

975
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,340

There's no king?

981
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,920
How is he not important enough to have his own story?

982
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,760
Oh, well, spicy.

983
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,580

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,560

995
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,120
Is this a spoiler?

996
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,320
I mean, it's Tekken 7.

997
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,680
We've taken your gamer rig for granted.

998
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,500
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

999
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:10,960

Thank you.

1001
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,980
Oh, this guy's dead.

1002
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,160
Whoever this guy is.

1003
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,540
That's it.

1004
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,660
only we can stop Kazuya I'm Kazuya I can stop Kazuya

1005
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,080

1006
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,100
Oh my god.

1007
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,480
He grew tattoos.

1008
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,100
We figured it out, guys.

1009
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,400
We figured out the story.

1010
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,300
Alright.

1011
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,940
I guess that was the story.

1012
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,460
So can we play now?

1013
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,180
Fight money.

1014
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,820
Why do I need a purchase?

1015
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,440
Oh, it's because of the gallery.

1016
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,340
Oh.

1017
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,580
Wait, someone said King's actually in there.

1018
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,320
Where's King?

1019
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,680
A, B, C, D, E, F.

1020
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,360
Oh, King.

1021
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,060
No, let's try it.

1022
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,180
Okay, apparently King grabs are good.

1023
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,420
King, that's me.

1024
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:29,520
undisputed pro wrestling champion ran an orphanage that
rescues children from all over the world wait so why does he

1025
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,080
have a jaguar head however due to the war between g
corporation and the mishima zibatsu the orphanage was

1026
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:43,580
already well beyond capacity the troubled wrestler then
remembered the recently announced the king of iron fist

1027
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,080
tournament and came up with a plan because it's cool

1028
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,540
He's so cool.

1029
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,000
Okay, it can't be a mess.

1030
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,680
He's literally talking in grouse.

1031
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,040
Like, unless he's super immersive.

1032
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,060
Why not?

1033
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,180
That's me!

1034
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,620
He does it for the children.

1035
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,260
That's me!

1036
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,060
Get ready for the next battle.

1037
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,680
I'll be fighting against the law.

1038
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,460
How do I grab?

1039
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,600
I realized I've learned everything but grabbing, and that's
this whole thing.

1040
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,700
Witness the might of the undisputed champion.

1041
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,820
Guys, I realized there was one thing I didn't learn.

1042
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,460
Oh, but did you see the block though?

1043
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,960
Oh, shit.

1044
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,620
Oh, fuck, okay.

1045
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:47,760
All right.

1046
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,080
It's fine.

1047
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:49,980
It's fine.

1048
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,200
We gotta use this heat moment before the round ends.

1049
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,860
Oh, shit.

1050
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:54,940
It's fine.

1051
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,820

1055
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,180
I'll just keep grabbing.

1056
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,840
I figured it out It's over.

1057
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,280
It's over for all the other nooms.

1058
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,560
I don't even know how to break a grab.

1059
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,680
It's over.

1060
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,060
Oh shit.

1061
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:49,840
Wait a minute.

1062
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,440
Oh shit.

1063
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1064
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,340
Let me grab you.

1065
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,560
I got the strat.

1066
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,780
Okay, maybe not.

1067
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,080
Guys, maybe I should stop that.

1068
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,040
Okay.

1069
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1070
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:09,720
Yes!

1071
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,000
No King's Laird knows how to break the grab.

1072
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,740
It sounds accurate.

1073
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,260
If I keep grabbing, if I keep grabbing, this is it!

1074
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,380
It's gotta keep grabbing!

1075
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,620
Let me grab you!

1076
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,020
Okay.

1077
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:32,820
Yes!

1078
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,280
We figured it out.

1079
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,280
Oh shit, I quit.

1080
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,160
That's right.

1081
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:40,940
That's right.

1082
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,160
Can't counter to grab.

1083
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1084
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,100
She's becoming king.

1085
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:50,920
All right.

1086
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,080
Winners play offense.

1087
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,600
All right, here we go.

1088
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,180
We figured it out.

1089
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,040
Go, king.

1090
01:02:59,340 --> 01:02:59,560
Go.

1091
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,080
How is she doing that?

1092
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,480
Okay.

1093
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,340
No one, no, none of the noobs know how to counter grabs
because I don't know how to counter it.

1094
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,340
Oh, shit.

1095
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,580
That's fucking right.

1096
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,400
No, no, no, no, no.

1097
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,800
No, no, no.

1098
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,960
Wait, how are you countering me?

1099
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
You're an NPC.

1100
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,800
That's fucking right.

1101
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,620
That's fucking right.

1102
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,620
How do you counter this?

1103
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:34,880
No.

1104
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:36,700
Oh shit.

1105
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:37,320
Oh shit.

1106
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,260
Oh, don't worry.

1107
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,740
I still can grab you.

1108
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,560
That's fucking right.

1109
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,040
Oh god.

1110
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:43,940
Oh god.

1111
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:44,400
No.

1112
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,000
No.

1113
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,640
He can't hit the grab.

1114
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
No way.

1115
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,300
There's nice.

1116
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:53,660
Nice.

1117
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,120
There you go.

1118
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,440
It's okay.

1119
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,560
It's okay.

1120
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,180
I just keep grabbing.

1121
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I just keep grabbing.

1122
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,100
It's okay.

1123
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,180
There's no way.

1124
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,180
There you go.

1125
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,000
There you go.

1126
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,220
That's fucking right!

1127
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,560
Check the PC.

1128
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,740
The NPC is learning about my grabs!

1129
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,320
How?

1130
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,640
How is he learning?

1131
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:22,560
Oh shit!

1132
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,200
No!

1133
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,880
Fuck, okay!

1134
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,380
He's countering my grabs!

1135
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:28,500
How?

1136
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,080
I don't know how I'm countering!

1137
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,060
Oh god, oh no, oh no, he's juggling me.

1138
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,920
This might be it.

1139
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,660
This might be it.

1140
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,220
This might be it.

1141
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,960
The NPC is learning.

1142
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,600
He cancelled it.

1143
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,180
He cancelled.

1144
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,340
Oh god.

1145
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,940
Oh god, no, no, no.

1146
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:52,480
Nice.

1147
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:01,030
This is a strat!

1148
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,330
Get ready for the next battle.

1149
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,330
This is a strat!

1150
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:08,450
I just know what XA and what was the other grab.

1151
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,390
Try up xy.

1152
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,210
Up xy.

1153
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,490
The AI is self-aware.

1154
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:18,430
Guys.

1155
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,510
Oh, why did I try xy?

1156
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:21,250
No.

1157
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,190
Oh, no.

1158
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:23,430
He's learning.

1159
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,750
He knows my math.

1160
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,570
He knows.

1161
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,990
Oh, my God.

1162
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:29,930
How does he know?

1163
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,770
How does he know?

1164
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,790
How?

1165
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:39,090
Okay, nice.

1166
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:39,890
There we go.

1167
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:41,930
There we go.

1168
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:43,530
Boom!

1169
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,330
That's fucking right.

1170
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:46,810
I'll just keep grabbing.

1171
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:47,490
Oh, shit.

1172
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,470
Okay, never mind.

1173
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:49,210
I'm so sorry.

1174
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:50,270
I'm so sorry.

1175
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:56,230
Nice.

1176
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,950
I'm doing it.

1177
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,150
There we go.

1178
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:01,850
Grab tab.

1179
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:02,910
Okay.

1180
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,670
Oh, my God.

1181
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,490
It would be crazy if he knew.

1182
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,110
Actually, if actually people...

1183
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:08,550
It would be crazy.

1184
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:13,450
crazy if the newbies actually learn how to counter the grab
i will be so sad

1185
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:30,350
i'll be so sad because this is actually my whole strat oh

There's coaching.

1188
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,080
It's okay.

1189
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,140
They're not gonna register.

1190
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,640
They're not gonna register.

1191
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,260
There's no way.

1192
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,420
Try running and then grab.

1193
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,560
Oh my god, I should try that.

1194
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,300
Okay, never mind.

1195
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:02,660
Oh!

01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,500
Oh, God.

1244
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:43,780
Okay.

1245
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,440
Grabbing the...

1246
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:46,820
No!

1247
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,440
No, it's over for you.

1248
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,600
That's fucking right.

1249
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:51,820
Oh, God.

1250
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,840
He blocked it.

1251
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,900
Yeah, you did block shit.

1252
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,680
That's fucking right.

1253
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,340
I figured it out.

1254
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:00,700
I'm learning.

1255
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,240
I blocked and then grabbed.

1256
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,760
Here we go.

1257
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,960
Just you wait and see.

1258
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,740
Wait, I think I do it.

1259
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:16,760
There's no way There's no way the other noobs can learn how
to counter a block Grab

1260
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:26,220
There's no way How would they learn

1261
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:42,720
They will There's no way They'll never figure out They'll
never figure out be a grab main that's the spirit come at me

1262
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:58,060
again after all you've got i need to learn the chain grab oh
my god i'll be unstoppable exactly i don't need to be good i

1263
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:04,780
just need to suck less than everyone else if only they had
coaches to teach them then they could learn they'll never

1264
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:11,740
know they'll never expect me to be the i'll practice king
off stream and i'll play every other i'll play all the other

1265
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,620
Tekken characters, so they'll never know who my main is.

1266
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:18,160
And I'll, like, hard grind King, and all I do is just grab.

1267
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,000
How would they know?

1268
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,980
Surely they won't research my first stream.

1269
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,720
Surely they wouldn't.

1270
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:34,520
Yeah, okay, we need to get the chain grab going, and a lot
of people can't counter it.

1271
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,160
Before this gets done.

1272
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,300
I'll play every other character, but King.

1273
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:48,240
next couple of streams and then a hard grind and then
they'll be like oh my god surely dokey bird is like an eddy

1274
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:54,920
main so all we have to do is learn how to count all you have
to do newbies is to learn how to counter like the okay but

1275
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:05,280

1294
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,450
I unlocked it, but I don't remember.

1295
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,370
Far down below the locked ones.

1296
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:20,770
Oh!

1297
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:21,810
Wait, no.

1298
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,610
These are paid.

1299
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,070
At the bodies.

1300
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,170
Liars?

1301
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:27,810
What is the one that unlocked?

1302
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,350
Oh, there it is.

1303
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,890
How would they know?

1304
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:40,830
Guys, how would they know I'm a king, man?

1305
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,390
There's no way.

1306
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:48,050
There's no fucking way they could find out.

1307
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,030
There's no way.

1308
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:54,730
2D is all I need.

1309
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:55,610
Wait, that's great.

1310
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,890
Where's the one I unlocked for this?

1311
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,270
Is it the play information panel?

1312
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,570
You missed the beast.

1313
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,650
Where is the beast?

1314
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,030
Today's the day.

1315
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,130
Where's the beast?

1316
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:08,810
I can't find it.

1317
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:10,170
I found tea drink here.

1318
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,170
Where the fuck is the beast?

1319
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:13,630
beast.

1320
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,990
Down?

1321
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,010
It's further down?

1322
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,410
Yeah, but these are all locked.

1323
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,510
Where's the unlocked?

1324
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,390
Oh, there it is.

1325
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,610
That beast.

1326
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:25,590
There we go.

1327
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:27,490
They'll never know.

1328
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,310
Guys, they'll never know I'm a king mane.

1329
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,750
They'll never know.

1330
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,690
They'll never know.

1331
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,750
How could they?

1332
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,750
I don't They found out I'm a beat.

1333
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:45,850
I'm the king main.

1334
01:14:46,210 --> 01:15:00,750
They're fucking stream snipers They'll never know Save and
exit there we go I'm sure they're eight minute king guys.

1335
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,170
There's no way.

1336
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:10,530
I refuse to believe they'll find out If they find out
they're hackers Be around how would they know exactly?

1337
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,590
How the fuck with you know what?

There's no way that you won't know.

1342
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,390
Guys, how would they know?

1343
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:57,410
How could they possibly know the mind games?

1344
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:03,650
That should really must not be a king main.

1345
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:04,330
I'm not.

1346
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:05,610
Who said I was?

1347
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:06,550
I told you.

1348
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:10,870
My server, my session says not a king main.

1349
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,210
So how would they know?

1350
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:15,770
Just like...

Wait, how do I counter another king player?

1354

Just... It's so easy!

1355
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:26,250
I'll grab them before they grab me.

Chat.

1357
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:31,210
I'll grab the king player before they grab me, and then
it'll be GG's.

1358
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,290
It'll be GG's from there.

1359
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:36,490
It's hard to get a read on...

1360

They couldn't pass.

1377

I bet they didn't expect it.

1378
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,560
I bet...

1379
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,900
Guys, I bet they didn't expect this.

How?

1396
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,000
What does she know?

That's fucking right.

1400
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,700
You can't count as shit.

1401
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,660
Oh, God.

1402
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:30,940

01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,540
She's countering my everything.

1409
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,880
No way.

1410
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,380
You can counter grabs?

1411
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:50,760
Why?

1412
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,600

Countered this bitch.

01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,140
That's all that matters.

1418
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,880
That's fucking right.

1419
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,400
That's fucking right.

1420
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,680
Get chaotic.

1421
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:13,860
I learned.

1422
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,620
I adapted.

1423
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,660
Oh, you want to grab too.

1424
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:20,820
Yeah?

1425
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:22,960
Oh, my God.

1426
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,040
She grabbed me.

1427
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,260
How is that possible?

1428
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,420
Oh, she countered my grab.

1429
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,880
How is that possible?

1430
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:29,880
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,540
I bet your whole idea is to counter all these grabs.

1432
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,020
Oh, my God.

1433
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:35,300
Okay.

1434
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,540
That's fucking right.

1435
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:36,940
But you did.

1436
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,220
She's countering my grabs.

1437
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,060
Yeah, right.

1438
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:43,840
Counter this.

1439
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,800
Bitch.

1440
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:47,940
That's a key.

1441
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,180
That's a key, right?

1442
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,080
You fucking didn't counter all of these, did you?

1443
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,720
That's a key, right?

1444
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,120
You didn't counter this.

1445
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,420
I got one off you.

1446
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:01,220
I had zero Tekken experience, but I took a round.

1447
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,780
I took a round off her.

1448
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,860
She knows how to tech it.

1449
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,940
What's embarrassing is that she, I took a round off her.

1450
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,340

01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,060
Oh, Jim!

01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,860
I thought you guys said Jim.

1468
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:23,140
I was like, sorry, Jim Tekken.

1469
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,100
Sorry, Jim.

01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,500

I thought you guys, sorry, I can't read.

01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,160

1473
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:36,560
Okay, that's pretty badass.

1474
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,860
I was like, why is his name Jim?

1475
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,840
But his actually name is Jim.

1476
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,060
No, his name is Jim.

1477
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:48,680
Yeah.

1478
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:51,760
Mishima.

1479
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,260
Is that his name?

1480
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:14,260
I wish I was king.

1481
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,060
I miss king, guys.

1482
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,280
I already missed him.

1483
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,440
Oh, that's a dad.

1484
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,360
Oh, shit.

1485
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,820
Can he grab?

1486
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,080
All right, guys.

1487
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,740
Oh, my gosh.

1488
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,060
Okay.

1489
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:39,960
Okay.

1490
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,700
Oh, my God.

1491
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,320
I jumped this other thing, though.

1492
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:44,960
Can you grab?

1493
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,960
Wait, you can grab.

1494
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,560
Wait, how good is your grab, though?

1495
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,820
Okay, it's okay.

1496
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,540
I'm just gonna keep grabbing.

1497
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,220
Wait, he dodged!

1498
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,900
Oh my god, it's not the same.

1499
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,080
It's not the same, guys.

1500
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,220
It's...

1501
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,720
It's not the same.

1502
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:05,120
His grab is not the same.

1503
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,290
It's not the same as King, though.

1504
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:18,550
King was cooler.

1505
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:20,410
Wait, what?

1506
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:21,230
Dodge.

1507
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,910
Oh, okay.

1508
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:25,090
Okay.

1509
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:26,550
Go look down.

1510
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:27,590
Yeah, that's fucking right.

1511
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:29,950
That's fucking right.

1512
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,330
And then I'll do this again.

1513
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,490
Yeah!

1514
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:35,430
Oh, shit.

1515
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:36,790
Okay, this time.

1516
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:37,770
I blocked it, I think.

1517
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:39,370
Yeah, I did.

1518
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:40,730
I did.

1519
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:41,410
I blocked it.

1520
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:41,990
Oh, shit.

1521
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:43,730
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1522
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,070
Oh, shit.

1523
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,710
He shot me in the fucking gut.

1524
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:48,890
Oh, guys.

1525
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:50,210
Nice.

1526
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:50,630
Alright.

1527
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:56,230
Okay, and then, please, grab him, Jin!

1528
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,470
Grab him!

1529
01:24:58,230 --> 01:24:58,730
Yes!

1530
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:00,410
Grab him again!

1531
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,770
We're king!

1532
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,010
Grab him again!

1533
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,390
Guys, I can't grab him.

1534
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:15,050
By the way, Toki, all you need to know about this family is
that they keep throwing each other off really high cliffs.

1535
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:16,750
Glassa, thank you for the super chat.

1536
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:17,890
Thank you.

1537
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:22,430
The worst...

1538
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:22,870
King.

1539
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,890
This one goes out to King.

1540
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:32,730
Oh shit, nice!

1541
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:36,450
Good old-fashioned family drama.

1542
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,980
I love it when my frames go to 18.

1543
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,480
Whoa, I have wings now.

1544
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:58,640
Holy shit.

1545
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,160
How many forms do I have?

1546
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:01,100
All right, watch this.

1547
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,060
I can block this.

1548
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:03,860
Oh.

1549
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:05,380
Guys.

1550
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,220
Guys, I can block one, right?

1551
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,560
There's no way.

1552
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:13,620
Yes.

1553
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:14,700
Okay, I got it.

1554
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,400
That was, I count that as a block.

1555
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:21,680
I count that as a block, guys.

1556
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,320
Okay, here you go.

1557
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,400
Okay, did I block that?

1558
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,720
That, no, I did it.

1559
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,340
Holy shit!

1560
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,200
Guys, it's because I gave him one.

1561
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,300
Holy shit, my laser eyes.

1562
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,620
That's insane.

1563
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,640
Oh, nope.

1564
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,780
How am I doing worse?

1565
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,840
Oh, I think that was a block.

1566
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,660
I think I actually did that.

1567
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,260
Oh, God.

1568
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:51,980
Oh, God.

1569
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:52,260
Okay.

1570
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,660
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1571
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,080
Nice.

1572
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:56,780
That's fine.

1573
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,100
That's fine.

1574
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,240
That's fine.

1575
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:58,600
That's fine.

1576
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,100
Okay.

1577
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:01,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1578
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,420
Yes!

1579
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:03,620
Blocked!

1580
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,900
That's fucking right!

1581
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,160
Oh, no.

1582
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,240
That's not okay.

1583
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,140
That's not okay.

1584
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,940
Oh, I tried to fly!

1585
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,060
Why did I try to fly?

1586
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:14,800
No!

1587
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,600
Oh, wait.

1588
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:17,620
Nice.

1589
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,020
Nice.

1590
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,140
The game protected me.

1591
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,640
I blocked.

1592
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,050
That's right, guys.

1593
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:27,570
I blocked.

1594
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:32,690
Story mode.

1595
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:33,390
Jeez.

1596
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:35,050
Guys, what are you talking about?

1597
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,090
I'm lude.

1598
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,390
I'm lude, guys.

1599
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:40,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

1600
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,470
Is this devil mode?

1601
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:45,930
I guess because he has, like, black wings?

1602
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:48,410
Am I going to kill my dad?

1603
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,430
This is not Clift.

1604
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:52,570
Oh, shit.

1605
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:56,310
Love watching this in, like, 30 FPS.

1606
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:08,840
Guys, I perfected it, because I had full HP when I...

1607
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,820
I had full HP when I ended.

1608
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,720
What the fuck?

1609
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,040
Is he also a devil?

1610
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,400

1611
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,000

1617
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,310
It's because I'm not king.

1618
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:11,630
I can't do this without king.

1619
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,320
He was my crutch

1620
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,230
He was a fucking crutch

1621
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:26,550
What what the fuck?

1622
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:38,650
Oh my gosh Okay, oh my god, he's so good I'm trying!

1623
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,690
I need to stop grabbing because it's all I know!

1624
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:46,270
It's actually all I know!

1625
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:49,050
I'm so used to grabbing!

1626
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,610
It's just pure instinct!

1627
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:56,610
It's actually pure instinct, my grabs!

1628
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,810
I've been doing it so much!

1629
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,370
Okay, nice.

1630
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:03,570
Can't block this.

1631
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:04,050
Oh!

1632
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:06,150
Wait, he did though!

1633
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:08,330
Oh God.

1634
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:10,730
Oh, it's okay.

1635
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,950
Oh God, it's not okay.

1636
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:15,210
Oh God.

1637
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:18,230
It's like blocking all the time.

1638
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:19,030
Oh!

1639
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:22,170
Why is he so good?

1640
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:28,630
How's the AI learning so much from me?

1641
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:34,690
It's actually sane.

1642
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:38,130
I learned so much.

1643
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:42,190
He regents?

1644
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:43,890
This is bullshit.

1645
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,810
There you go.

I need to stop grabbing.

1649
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:50,590
I need to stop grabbing.

1650
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:51,990
It's all I know.

1651
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,730
It's actually all I know.

1652
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:57,590
Don't keep their unblockable as this game.

1653
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,870
Anyway, good luck in learning the game.

Random.

1669
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:59,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1670
01:32:59,580 --> 01:32:59,680
Thank you.

1671
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,340

Thank you.

1673
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:06,280
Whoa.

1674
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:10,880
It's okay.

1675
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,360
We can rebuild it.

1676
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,200
Hey, why are we in New York?

1677
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,420
Should we be in Japan?

1678
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:32,430
Why not?

1679
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:34,950
Oh, and he chose New York?

1680
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:36,370
That's fucked up.

1681
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:50,430
Admiral, a few city blocks have been lost.

1682
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:53,230
Just another day in New York.

1683
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:58,430
...

1684
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,050
Revan, ...

1685
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:04,030
I mean, I'm speaking in like...

1686
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:04,430
Wow!

1687
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:07,930
Hey, they're like universalists.

1688
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:08,830
Do they all have life?

1689
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:11,870
It's French.

1690
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:15,550
Do they all have, like, earpieces that translate each
language or speaking?

1691
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:23,290
Doki, when she realized other players have coaches that can
teach them how to counter grabs.

1692
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:25,150
Surprise, Pikachu face.

1693
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,250
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1694
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,610
Doki, thank you, thank you.

1695
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:28,670
They would never.

1696
01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:32,650
Yes, but they can't counter my grabs.

1697
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:34,830
There's no way.

1698
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:40,010
At best, if they get better, they won't be matchup with me.

1699
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,970
Because as long as I don't improve,

1700
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:51,170
as long as I don't improve, I'll still be matched up with
all the people in my rank.

1701
01:34:59,390 --> 01:34:59,830
Yeah,

1702
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:14,160
but like, the thing is, they have to, we're matched up to,
like, our level.

1703
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:24,180
So I just like Thank you for the super chat Thank you, thank
you No, I don't show my strats on stream That's the key I

1704
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:31,580
figured it out Like I said, I'll play everybody but king So
they won't They won't Think about countering me On king

1705
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:36,920
They'll like try to Figure out how to counter me On every
other Character But king

1706
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:46,280
Oh, apparently all tech characters Under your sand each
other Wait, that's crazy that's that's insane it's amazing

1707
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:15,720
i wish that was real i can just let understand everybody
else's languages.

1708
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:23,840
Yay!

1709
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:27,940
Oh, wait.

1710
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,740
There's me.

1711
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,580
He wishes he was king.

1712
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,850
What's that?

1713
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:49,790
Is that me too?

1714
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:52,050
Oh, yeah.

1715
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:53,010
It's devil me.

1716
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,110
Simple and clean.

1717
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:14,650
Sora wake up Sora wake up

1718
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,320
Oh is that my mom

1719
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:54,810
I think he has mommy and daddy issues Clearly Developed by
Bandai

1720
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:10,120
Whoa What is that?

1721
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:23,560
He's better off as an orphan Not gonna lie with all those
issues I feel like he'd be way more well-adjusted if he was

1722
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,000
an orphan.

1723
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,740
Yeah, he has mommy issues.

1724
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,260
The issue is she's dead.

1725
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,520
Oh my god.

1726
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:42,110
What's this?

1727
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:45,730
Mashima.

1728
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:49,630
Wait, he's rich.

1729
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:52,970
Who's Mashima, right?

1730
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:17,600
I'm a...

1731
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:18,620
Oh my god, he's so rich.

1732
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,040
How does he have so many issues?

1733
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,320
It's because he's this rich that he has so many issues.

1734
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:40,340
His dad is rich, him not so much, but then he gets the money
passed down to him.

1735
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,820
It's called inheritance.

1736
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,480
If rich, why evil?

1737
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:49,340
Okay.

1738
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,580
That counters each other.

1739
01:39:52,060 --> 01:40:08,920
is rich is even no no rich person is innocent that's how
they get rich in the first place it's been one week since

1740

01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:00,660
Oh, my God.

1754
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:00,900
No.

1755
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,180
He counters me.

1756
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,060
No!

1757
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,160
He led my patterns!

Oh, no.

1761
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:12,400
That's not good.

1762
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,480
That's not good.

1763
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:14,960
That's not good at all.

1764
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,220
This is all I know how to do.

1765
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:20,020
Oh, shit.

1766
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:20,700
No.

1767
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,360
I lose.

1768
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,520
I got one round off him.

1769
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:26,500
How do I lose?

1770
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,980
He gets two rounds and I get one?

1771
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,800
This is absolutely bullshit.

1772
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,240
Can't believe it.

1773
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:39,340
This is so messed up.

1774
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,780
I can't believe it.

1775
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,040
It's fine.

1776
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:48,900
It's fine.

1777
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:50,620
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

1778
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,220
Oh, he's not seeing it!

1779
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,960
Ah, I blocked so many!

1780
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,220
Okay, and then he fucks me up.

1781
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,580
There you go.

1782
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,700
Oh, yeah, I see that.

1783
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,080
Whoa!

1784
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,860
Get comboed, dude!

1785
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,290
Okay, they won't expect this.

1786
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:20,790
The AI can't expect that.

1787
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:25,470
I told you, the AI cannot expect that.

1788
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:30,390
Guys, I got a combo going on!

1789
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,050
Oh, shit!

1790
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:35,530
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1791
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:36,050
Grab him!

1792
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,750
Grab him!

1793
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:38,570
Oh, God.

1794
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,070
Come on.

1795
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:40,810
Nice.

1796
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:43,230
Come on.

1797
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:44,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1798
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,090
Yes, grab!

1799
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:48,070
Boop!

1800
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:51,450
Yay, I'm making progress.

1801
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,490
How can you predict chaos?

1802
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:57,590
Exactly.

1803
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:12,550
Yeah, they can't detect my combos if I don't know the
combos.

1804
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:13,750
Exactly.

1805
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:33,960
What's this?

1806
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,320
Oh no, I'm having PTSD.

1807
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,220
No, I'm not a Jin character.

1808
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,420
I'm king.

1809
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:54,260
And if you are one of the participants trying to scope up
the competition, I am not a king player.

1810
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,240
I was just joking.

1811
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,660
I don't know how to play king.

1812
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,320
I'm not a king main, I swear.

1813
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:19,170
I don't know who king is.

1814
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:19,930
Who is king?

1815
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:21,910
Never seen that man in my life.

1816
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:43,660
She's a robot?

1817
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:49,390
Yeah, a robot would dress like that.

1818
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:55,850
It seems like definitely a type of outfit where she can
never take off.

1819
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:10,140
AI generated fashion!

1820
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,880
I'll be able to send you out.

1821
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,260
Wait.

1822
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:34,320
My devil's power was in the battle.

1823
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,040
In the future, he came to fight.

1824
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:42,280
If the power is re-examined, then that will be the battle in
the battle.

1825
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,420
It's Kazuyo-Chair's tournament.

Guys, the particles stop.

1962
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,180
The particles are moving.

1963
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:12,840
Guys, the particles stop moving.

1964
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:14,420

1977
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:34,580
We don't need phrase for the grab.

1978
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:36,420

01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:37,320

02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:07,560
How does he know?

2050
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,660
I don't understand.

2051
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,900
How does he know what I want to do?

2052
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,320

02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,680

That's fucking right.

2066
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:18,040
You didn't expect me to go that way, right?

2067
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:20,780
That's fucking right.

2068
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:21,960
Oh, oh, shit.

2069
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:23,040
Oh, shit.

But can you escape that grab?

2071
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:27,260
No, you can't.

2072
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,540
That's fucking right.

2073
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:30,920
The grab!

2074
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,620

Escape this, nerd!

2078
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:44,920
That's right, you don't expect this!

2079
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,580
He expected it, guys.

2080
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,340
But did he expect this, though?

2081
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:54,460
I'm too powerful.

2082
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:55,780
Oh, no.

2083
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:56,160
Wait.

2084
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:56,720

2086
02:03:58,980 --> 02:03:59,360
No.

2087
02:03:59,440 --> 02:03:59,840
Uh-uh.

2088
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:01,840
CPU?

2089
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:03,220
No, no, no, no, CPU!

2090
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,260
No!

2091
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,160
Oh no.

2092
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:08,300
Easy.

2093
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,540
How does she keep getting away with this?

2094
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:13,320
The dokey grab.

2095
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:15,360
Oh my god, the dokey grab is back!

2096
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:18,540
It's back!

2097
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:20,020
It never left!

2098
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:22,840
The dokey grab never leaves.

2099
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,320
Oh god.

2100
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:27,880
It's actually input reading me now.

2101
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:28,940
Holy shit.

2102
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:30,920
He actually knows now.

2103
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:38,480
How does he know?

2104
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:39,060
Okay.

2105
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,540
Oh my god, how the fuck?

2106
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:45,900
How the fuck does he know this is my strength this entire
time?

2107
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:48,340
Ultra hard goes hard.

2108
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,220
Oh, nice.

2109
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:54,820
It's fine.

2110
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:57,360
No, it's not fine!

2111
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:01,940
He's the counter grabbing me!

2112
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:08,980
Holy shit!

2113
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,500
He figured it out!

2114
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,980
How did he figure... I don't understand.

2115
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:14,980
How does he figure this out?

2116
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,300
No, no, no, no, no.

2117
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:18,560
I can do it too.

2118
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:22,420
I can also do it...

2119
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:22,840

We'll be fine.

2126
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:32,300

2147
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:35,900
need a harder mode for me oh my god

2148
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:51,660

it we got all the way to ultra mode we fucking did it we

2149
02:06:51,660 --> 02:07:02,980
fucking did it guys oh anyway i'm gonna call it here
everyone we had two streams today so today is a good time to

2150
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:10,820
rest now i've lot of work to do today so uh it's a great
time to stream techin for the first time techin 8 for the

2151
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:18,600
first time and playing it for the first time a lot of fun i
had a lot of fun guys especially taking some sets off of uh

2152
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:30,060
fucking quote unquote uh not pro sorry quote unquote the
good players of my dragoons you should be ashamed if i took

2153
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,780
a set off you you should be ashamed

2154
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:43,680
but all right guys so for the reason for those who are new
here the reason why i'm playing um it's because i got

2155
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:51,960
invited to do sea jam slam too so obviously i'm a noob so
i'll be put in the noob category with everybody else so like

2156
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:58,720
noobs will be fighting other noobs and that's why i'm
learning a character that a noob might have difficulty with

2157
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:12,720
so which is not king it's eddie guys i'm talking about eddie
not king um Who's my trainer and coach?

2158
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:13,400
I don't know.

2159
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:13,980
I don't know.

2160
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,120
I'm just waiting for it.

2161
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:20,080
Apparently, this was the stream for them to figure out,
like, how they're going to balance it.

2162
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:22,100
So, like, I hope that I look really bad.

2163
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:25,800
So, I'm a new player.

2164
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:27,280
I'm a new player.

2165
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:29,160
I have no idea what I'm actually doing.

2166
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,800
So, like, we had to do a stream.

2167
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:36,980
We're, like, we had to do, like, at least an hour stream so
they can gauge our, like, skill level.

2168
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:39,840
So, by the way, I'm a new player.

2169
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:40,440
Please.

2170
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,020
Treat me as a new player.

2171
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:46,840
I'm so bad.

2172
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:49,200
I can only go up.

2173
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:51,180
I'm at rock bottom.

2174
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:54,980
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture
check.

2175
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:57,020
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2176
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:58,800
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2177
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:00,100
Because you deserve it.

2178
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,440
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2179
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:02,840
Bye, guys.

2180
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:03,980
Bye.
