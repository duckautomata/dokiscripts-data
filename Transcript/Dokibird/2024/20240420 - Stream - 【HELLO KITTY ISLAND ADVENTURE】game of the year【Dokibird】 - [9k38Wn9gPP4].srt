So, anyway, let me tell you the adventure.

39
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:13,150
I had to have my own little adventure that I had to have
before we were able to get all of this to work.

40
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,770
So, my little adventure is that basically what happened was
that I woke up and I was like,

41
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,590
What happened was that?

42
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,150
I realized, I was like, wait a minute, because I don't know,
this must be an old iPad.

43
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,390
Because I was like, I was like, I don't need to.

44
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:42,670
I was like, oh, man, I don't need to have a, I don't need to
have a new iPad.

45
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,530
You know, I have so much streaming experience.

46
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,150
I can just use, because I don't have an iPad.

47
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,070
I use my dad's iPad.

48
00:04:51,350 --> 00:05:00,350
need an new iPad I'll just borrow my parents iPad because
iPads are so fucking expensive what I didn't realize is that

49
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:09,130
um this is ever is this like a particularly old iPad you
know it's a particularly old iPad because the adapter the

50
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:17,470
iPad adapter is still like um the adapter is still USB-C
it's not a lightning adapter you know it was before when

51
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:27,770
Apple you know it was before when everything using the
lightning adapter like like made everything so you know it's

52
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:38,350
old when the iPad is still using USB-C before the Apple was
like no uh-uh we're gonna make everything um lightning so so

53
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:48,650
I didn't realize I didn't have the adapter for the for to
use for the game capture because I was like oh yeah I can

54
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:58,770
just uh I can just, you know, I'll just use this, this game
capture adapter that I have for my iPhone, that I use to

55
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,710
stream with my iPhone.

56
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,030
And then I was like, wait a minute.

57
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,930
Why doesn't it fit?

58
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,670
Oh, I met the 30 pin.

59
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,070
Sorry.

60
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,090
The 30 pin.

61
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,910
I don't remember.

62
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,930
It's one of them.

63
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,770
Okay, it's one of them.

64
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,750
I don't remember.

65
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:27,730
Okay, so, um, anyway, um, I just know that like the one I
have is not does not work because like it doesn't fit into

66
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:35,870
the one because it I was like okay so I need to I need to
buy I need to go to I need to go to an electronic store and

67
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:44,950
buy an adapter because I was like oh I'll just use my
android adapter you know yeah the one when I had the android

68
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,970
pad I don't know what do they call the i android iPad do
just call it the android tablet sorry i'll just use the

69
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:59,690
android tablet to um because i have the adapter to to stream
my android tablet because this game is an apple exclusive by

70
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,430
the way i hope the sound's okay i turned down the sound on
my end oh there was no sound there's no music at all you

71
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:15,310

anyway so um i was like all right I have an adapter for

72
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:23,350
Android tablets and like my cable for the iPad fits an
Android tablet So I'll use the Android tablet adapter to you

73
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:34,010
to plug into my game capture that would work right So it
didn't um I would kept crashing the the game captured kept

74
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:44,810
crashing because who would have thought uh it didn't work so
uh so I was like okay we gotta go to the electronic store

75
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:53,010
and like we gotta go to the electronics store and buy the
adapter the Apple you know like because you know the Apple

76
00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:01,890
approved adapter that can connect to the game capture so I
bought that and then I came back and I was like alright good

77
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:12,250
we should be able to stream now and then I was like wait a
minute I can't buy any games because this account is you

this payment I was like, okay, I'll just use PayPal and

97
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,350
they're like we can't verify this either and I was like,
okay I fucking

98
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:52,070
So, so yeah, we it was region locked to a specific region So
I was like okay, and then my dad literally was like oh my

99
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:59,090

like they were like look my dad and mom were looking through

100
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:05,990
like various because like okay Um, um, they've been they've
been using apple phones for a long time since apple iPhones

101
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:12,950
were since iPhones were like first introduced when an iPhone
was made of metal Was it metal it was like I remember like

102
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,350
the very first iPhone was like metal and it was like super
heavy and all that so like they were just looking through

103
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:29,290
their collections of iPhones and one of them still had the
yahoo account registered to the iphone to the to the iphone

104
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:39,870
so they're like we got it we got access to the iphone we got
access to the yahoo man because they were looking through

105
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:49,250
like the collection of phones and like one of the phones one
of the phones slash ipads had access like had little access

106
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:57,350
to the to the yahoo account so we were able to change the
password and they're like you change it since you're gonna

107
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,730
use it you use the password for it and then so then i had to
change the password and then now and then i finally i i

112
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:51,170

is hella kitty island adventure it's essentially like it's

113
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:58,530
essentially like uh animal crossing but instead of like
animal crossing characters it's just all samuel characters

114
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:05,730
and it's but it's only on the on the apples like apple apple
devices apparently you play on the mac and everything

115
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:18,770
I think the only people who use Mac, I'm so sorry to all the
Mac users, but I feel like the only people who use like Mac,

116
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:33,310
Mac, Macs anymore are like video editors and video audio
editors or yeah, I guess like normies, I guess, but I don't

117
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,550
know.

118
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,550
Same here.

119
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,670
I don't know who buys a Mac anymore but i know a lot of like
video audio editors still use the mac for like stuff there i

120
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:58,630
guess so uh but yes it's sadly only an apple exclusive and

Okay, this is the guy we're never gonna talk to.

246
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,270
Because, like, we're never gonna need clothes.

247
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,210
Nothing makes me happier than helping my friends look their
best.

248
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,710
If you excuse me, I feel inspiration about to strike.

249
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,630
Alright.

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,350

00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,030

Hey, how are you?

I can't wait to see the island.

262
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,850
Oh, this is like the animal crossing in the beginning where
you're talking to people before you arrive in the town.

263
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,270
The name's Karomi.

264
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,670
Don't believe anything.

265
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,570
Those two jokers, batsmodern, Karopi, say about me.

266
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,610
Yeah, they're all wrong.

267
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,710

much anything I could find from this place sometimes i

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,830
Get out of the way.

282
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,130
I want to talk to Papa Puran.

283
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,150
I don't care about you.

284
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,670
I don't care about you, Puchi, whatever.

285
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:20,830

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,350

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,370
I can't remember how to say your name.

290
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,390
Ritsiko.

291
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,650
I don't know.

292
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,070
I was like thinking about the, like, the show's name.

293
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:41,330
I haven't watched the two seasons of Retsuko yet Agusuko

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:48,750

other guy And then I was so mad That I never watched I never

like Why did you settle for him It's a fucking loser I

298
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:31,790

then I never watched the season after that because I was so

299
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:36,550
sad that like she dumped that other This flight search seems
like it's taking forever.

300
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,390
I grabbed it because my original flight got canceled.

301
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,590
I think we're almost there.

302
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,930
Oh, please, my eyes are up here, Miss Retsuko.

303
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,850
It's nice to meet you.

304
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm Retsuko.

305
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,230
I took some time off from work because I have a really
stressful job.

306
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,570
Oh, yeah.

307
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,230
She said OL, by the way.

308
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,810
I was hoping a break from the office would be good for me.

309
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,890
I keep thinking about my boss and the work that's probably
piling up.

310
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,950
I'm getting even more freaked out.

311
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,390
No!

312
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,990
I don't know anyone I'm playing, but they seem to all know
each other.

313
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,190
Don't worry, Retsuko.

314
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,330
You can know me!

315
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,450
But my eyes are up here, by the way.

316
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,650
They do seem unusually friendly, though.

317
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,770
You already gave me gifts?

318
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,470
Oh my god, where's my gifts?

319
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,070
It was nice meeting you.

320
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,490
It was nice meeting you, too, Retsuko.

321
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,390
Okay, I'm done.

322
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,450
If I can't talk to Pompon Perun, then I don't care anymore.

323
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,250
Alright, I'm ready.

324
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,430

325
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,930
This is such an exciting opportunity for my...

326
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,110
Okay, I don't care about her either.

327
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,150
It's not every day you get invited to open this door on the
Tropical Island Resort.

328
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,010
And theme...

329
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,110
Who told... Who talked to you, my melody?

330
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,130
No one asked for you, melody.

331
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,790
And theme park.

332
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,910
We're here to support you, my melody.

333
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,590
Oh, I can't say no.

334
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:11,810
oh thank you you're both so kind you know my invitation to
big adventures park was mysterious i'm sure it's perfectly

335
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:19,670
ordinary island though i can't wait to land are you still
talking to new friends or do you want to meet them after we

336
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:28,370

village do i keep being rude i didn't ask her to talk to me

337
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,650
She butted into the conversation.

338
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,190
Andy, thank you for the super chat.

339
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,030
Thank you, thank you.

340
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,790
I think Karomi actually has episodes of her show on the
Haukitty and Friends YouTube.

341
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,510
Oh my god.

342
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,010
I love how each Sanrio character actually has their own
YouTube channel in Japanese.

343
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,370
And they actually upload cover music videos too, which is
funny.

344
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,830
I'll go get you a slice.

345
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,370
Just wait for me at your seat, okay?

346
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,350
Look, I want to make new friends.

347
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,090
but not, but not Melody.

348
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,630
Not some of the people here.

349
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,510
I get to pick and choose which Sanrio kicked through.

350
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,790
I want to be friends with.

351
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,950
Is there a fucking oven in the plane?

352
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,790
That should not do well with the air pressure.

353
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,330
So delicious.

354
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,690
As long as I input the settings right, of course.

355
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,930
Okay, let's see.

356
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,810
Why is there an oven on the plane?

357
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,230
Is that safe?

358
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,450
Is that...

359
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:41,030
Beep, beep, boop, beep Error, please break to send an error
Please press bake to send an error report Error Oh no!

360
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,230

361
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,870
What did you do, Kitty?

362
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,670
Who put an oven on the plane?

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,810
Everyone take some balloons.

370
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,370
We're gonna have to jump.

371
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,560

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,260

373
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,500
Single file as we jump off the plane.

374
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,800

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,680
Oh my god.

425
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,660
I already, you need it to be wrapped.

426
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,260
This is why I don't like Melody.

427
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,240
She's so...

428
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,120
She's so high maintenance.

429
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,280
Karomi wouldn't care.

430
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,760
She'd just be happy that I fucking got her a strawberry.

431
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,540
I didn't need to wrap it for her.

432
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,360
So demanding.

433
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,640

448
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,720
Hello, hello, kitty.

449
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,320
I got melody here.

450
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,620
Wait, I don't see Karomi.

451
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,560
Where is she?

452
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,480
Where's Karomi?

453
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,920
By my calculations, Half-party seems to be absent.

454
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:25,780
No!

455
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,080
I just realized all the ones I hate are on this side.

456
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,620
No!

457
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,940
No!

458
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:38,980
No!

459
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,260
I'm missing...

460
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,300
Yeah, wasn't it Retziko?

461
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,490
Yeah, what about Retziko?

462
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,710
They forgot about Retziko?

463
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,050
They're like, isn't there one more person?

464
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,250
so fucked up.

465
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,050
Retsuko is so much more famous than you pochi.

466
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:02,730
Hello?

467
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,490
Can I help?

468
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,890
Oh, oh dear.

469
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,750
She didn't make it.

470
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,710
Who is that?

471
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,470
A ghost?

472
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,350
I believe it was a hologram.

473
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,370
Sophisticated technology but deteriorated.

474
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,770
She's so smart.

475
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,950
The island has only become more mysterious since we arrived.

476
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,930
I'm going to set up camp.

477
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,910
We need a base of operation to discover what's afoot and
find everyone.

478
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,770
Oh my god, he's like Sherlock Holmes.

479
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,470
That's a good idea.

480
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,870
We should split up, gang.

481
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,010
Look for clues.

482
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,590
When does this become Scooby-Doo?

483
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,510
Split up, you should never split the party.

484
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,930
Batzmaru, you watch too many scary movies.

485
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,430
I'm serious!

486
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,210
There's no one here!

487
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,310
There's not even staff!

488
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,550
Don't stop slandering my boy, Pochuk.

489
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,670
Bro, he started it.

490
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,550
He didn't think Retsuko was important enough, but he
would...

491
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,530
But Retsuko is, like, more famous than him because she has a
TV show.

492
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,110
Where's his TV show?

493
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,850
And don't say, like, he was in the Hello Kitty show, because
it literally says Hello Kitty.

494
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,910
He was a guest star.

495
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,990
I was supposed to be stabbed.

496
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,650
And look, there's my new story.

497
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,890
They specifically said I need the furniture and decorations
in my shop.

498
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,390
Maybe we can fix up the cabins for our own visitors.

499
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,530
And that looks like a place where I can make food for all of
us.

500
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,930
All of us even mean?

501
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,050
Fine.

502
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,770
I'll go check by the beach.

503
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,090
Maybe there will be a snack bar or something.

504
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:11,810
Hello kitty and friends He's in the friend section Doki Why
don't you see if my melody needs any help It must suck to be

506
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,650
No, Karomi's not sister Karomi's just a really good friend
Right?

507
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,010
Or was it cousin?

508
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:26,910
I don't know, the lore keeps changing I don't remember if
that Karomi is supposed to be like Cousin, sister or a

509
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:34,950
friend anymore But like, Melody's just jealous because
Karomi ended up being more popular than her.

510
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,770
Alright, help Melody at the gift shop.

511
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,010

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,830

Hell, a kitty, chocolate cat.

That's, oh, it's basically everybody.

540
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,850
This is like the, the frog chair in Animal Crossing.

541
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,090
But now, but now it's like a fucking shelf.

542
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,650
All right, let's go.

543

Is Hello Kitty the pigeon in this game?

548
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,830
Oh my god, can I sit down?

557
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:33,050
He is so beneath her.

558
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,630
How does she even...

559
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,550
Oh, I got tofu!

560
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:38,490
Nice.

561
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,610
New friend.

562
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,550
That's the year and now.

563
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,630
New friends with Hello Kitty.

564
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:44,550
Yay!

565
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,490
Wait, what does Hello Kitty want?

566
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,930
Isn't this the cutest cafe?

567
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:50,870
It's wonderful!

568
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,650
She has standards!

569
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,230
Karomi has standards!

570
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,030
standards.

571
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,910
It's even stocked with fresh supplies.

572
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,390
I think I work.

573
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,210
Look at the fucking Sanrio popularity character contest.

574
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:12,330
Do you know where Basmaru is in the popularity rankings for
Sanrio characters?

575
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,370
It's so low.

576
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,230
Karomi is the top five.

577
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,970
She's a top five gal and she deserves a top five man.

578
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,030
Anyway, so we can feed our friends when we find them.

579
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,030
Since you're here, do you mind me with something?

580
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,230
What do I have to do?

581
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,190
What do you want me to do?

582
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,010
These padded holders are missing some umbrellas.

583
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,870
I found one across the street and I have a feeling they're
scattered around the resort.

584
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,030
Ideally, I like for each table to have an umbrella.

585
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,810
Would you mind seeing?

586
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,790
Oh yeah, that's easy.

587
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,610
Here I come.

588
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,250
Don't worry, I got you, look, kiddies.

589
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,310
This thing...

590
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,950
No!

591
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,590
She does not have a crush on Basmaru!

592
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,190
I refuse to let her have a crush.

593
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,050
Oh, none of this is working.

594
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,210
Kitty, how can you run a cafe if none of these were...

595
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,190
Oh, wait, they work!

596
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,770
Oh, I don't have...

597
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,370
Is that a heart?

598
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,290
No, that's a strawberry.

599
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,790
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

600
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,030
Oh, I can, like...

601
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,110
Wait, I have to make my own dessert?

602
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,290
That's fucked up.

603
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,410
Keep going.

604
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,630
I refuse.

605
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:37,710
Karomi go beneath her standards she deserves the top five
guy for a top five for a top five Karomi I don't know what

606
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:50,370

00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:54,190
oh there's a picnic basket can I steal it No, I can't.

608
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,630
And they can't steal it.

609
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,830
Wait, which place is this?

610
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,970
Okay, so, like, you know how, like, there's, like, Hello
Kitty has a boyfriend, and his name is Dear Daniel.

611
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,770
And she also has a sister.

612
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,090
I forgot her sister's name, because no one really, because,
like, no one really cares about her.

613
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:19,510
But, like, there's, like, this, like, Hello Kitty lie on the
internet, where if you look up Dear Daniel, it's, like, what

614
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,750
was it?

615
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:22,930
They say, like, Dear Daniel, Daniel was, like, oh, my God.

616
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:30,850
what the lie was i remember like googled it her name is me

I got thread.

621
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,190
Don't worry, I'll never come back to the store, Tuxedo Sam.

622
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,870
I don't need clothes.

623
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,410
Yay.

624
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,410
All right, this is the last time you'll ever see this guy.

625
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,110
Greetings and salutations.

626
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,590
By pure chance, I stumble across the perfect location to
open a clothing emporium.

627
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,690
Egg planet.

628
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:17,250
Oh, yes.

629
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,370
Hala Kitty also has a cat called Charming Kitty.

630
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,310
Don't think too hard about it.

631
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:32,510
don't think she she and apparently like the creator was like
she's not a cat like the creator of hello kitty was like

632
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:43,330
hello kitty is not a cat to like justify her owning a cat um
i plan to keep myself very busy until the rest of our party

633
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:51,170
joins us uh in fact i already had my first customer i had an
honor of outfitting chuckle cat in explorer wear that was

634
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:57,050
both stylish and Yeah, it's like a goofy Pluto situation.

635
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,530
I'll be honored to serve as official clear for a merry band.

636
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,670
Let me guess, do you need something?

637
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,830
Well, normally I wouldn't pose, but I'm facing a rather odd
dilemma.

638
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,370
I need assistance in displaying and tailoring my designs.

639
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,770
I'm quite at loss without clothing stands to aid me.

640
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,690
Would you mind searching around for some?

641
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,250
If you guys didn't just jump off the plane, you would have
all your stuff.

642
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,550
I may see some outside.

643
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,610
Okay, I think, I think, like, the villagers here are a
little stupid.

644
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,650
Like, they literally jumped out of the plane and was like,
We don't need our luggage.

645
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,170
All right, we got one clothing stand.

646
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,030
Oh, let's grab some strawberry crate.

647
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:46,810
What's this?

648
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,290
What is that?

649
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,030
What is this?

650
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,470

00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,380
Since the water balloon I got from My Melody, first, I want
to try and get another one.

667
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,760
I bet we could make one with some of that rubber around
here.

668
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,140
What?

669
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,600
Will you collect... What?

670
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,620
Rubber grows on trees.

671
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,980
Usually they grow up on hills, but I also saw one by Choco
Cat's tent.

00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,200
I don't want to talk to these people.

677
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,540
When can I kick them off my village?

678
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,680
Just like Animal Crossing.

679
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,640
When can I force them out of the village?

680
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,980
So I can have my optimal village.

681
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,540
Oh my god, what is that?

682
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,240
Is that B?

683
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,520
Well, I can't catch it yet.

684
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,540

00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,060

00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,480
Okay, let's grab all of this for fucking tuxedo sham.

687
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,220

688
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,740
What?

689
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,100
There's like one more somewhere here.

690
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,500
What the fuck?

691
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,660
Where's the last one?

692
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,800
It says it's like around here.

693
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,300
But like, we're around here.

694
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,000
Is it like here somewhere, like hiding?

695
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,760
No.

696
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,280
I'm so confused.

697
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,700
Oh well.

698
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,180
Let's see.

699
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,620
Who cares about what he wants?

700
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:00,560
Anyway.

701
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,460
What's that?

702
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,480
Is that bug?

703
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,260
Oh, it's right here!

704
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,060

00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,820
Guys, this is not a children's game.

707
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,980
It's actually pretty difficult.

708
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,680
Here you go.

709
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,900
I finished a mission.

710
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,720
This is a very difficult game, guys.

711
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,240
Three cheers.

712
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,040
We're the champions.

713
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,240
yet provided a valuable service.

714
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:28,720
That's me.

715
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,940

No.

723
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,480
We don't need clothes.

724
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,680
What we've learned is that we do not need clothes.

725
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,660
We are perfect, guys.

726
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,280

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,440

738
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,860
No!

739
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,520
The fact that Puchaco's vegetarian, it's ruined!

740
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,180
Hey, have you seen a little egg throughout the...

741
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,500

742
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:53,880
What?

743
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,980

748
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:38,900

bought this little cute Guttama thing where you open the

749
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,300
fridge, Guttama would, like, come out of his egg.

750
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,260
So you put the Guttama thing in the egg carton, like, in the
egg drawer.

751
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,580
And then when you open the fridge, Guttama will come out of
his egg and will be, like, close your door!

752
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,300
Like, in Japanese, and it's so fucking cute.

753
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,320
And it does that, like, every time you open the fridge so it
reminds you to it's like there to remind you to close the

754

fridge and everything it's so fucking cute oh my god there

You fell for the classic plunder.

00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:25,250
I first came across to them in France when I was training to
be a professional baker.

00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,470
Can you handle that?

802
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,710
I was born ready.

803
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,150

And I'm like that's not true because I'll say I love you to
Gutama.

You can always return for the sign just to check how many

824
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:30,230
Are they on the other side of that?

825
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,390
All right, here's your gift, Choco Cat.

826
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:36,390
What's this?

827
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,550
An old photograph?

828
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,230
My melody found while cleaning up the shop.

829
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:41,370
Incredible!

830
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,690
This might have been taken on the island forever and ever
ago.

831
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,690
Where is this location?

832
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,070
Please.

833
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,030
Open the door.

834
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,750
I need a five-star tomorrow.

835
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,390
Open the door!

836
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,590
Yay!

837
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:01,830
Small gift, big smile.

838
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,150
Okay.

839
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,370
I'm setting this gate to see how we might be able to open
it.

840
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,630
I think I'm missing friends.

841
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:18,110
have landed behind this gate to find them you have to oh my
god how do we open it how do we open it give me karomi at

842
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:26,110

is retzuko too no one ever said where retzuko is the door

843
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:33,670
will open or a power source more specifically yellow power
crystal see here it looks like the ancient plans were some

844
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:37,390
kind of power crystal sensor a power crystal sensor

845
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:41,550
is correct.

846
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:45,250
We'll need three sticks and three magnets to create the
pirate.

847
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,510
I have two.

848
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,930
I have two magnets.

849
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,050
I've got what we needed.

850
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:53,330
I don't actually.

851
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,650
Oh, I do.

852
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,130
Do I actually?

853
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,010
Wait, do I actually have it?

854
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,190
I was lying.

855
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,490
Oh my god, I do!

856
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,450
Let's go.

857
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,590
JK, I was not lying.

858
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,170
I got the crystal sensor.

859
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:23,470
The fabled power crystal sensor.

860
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:24,710
Look.

861
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,950
Typical magnets equals magic.

862
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,370
Guys, science is practically magic, chat.

863
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,730
You use the sensor, type the button, and select it.

864
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,450
The closer we are to a yellow power crystal, the faster...

865
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,790
What is this Chaos Emerald?

866
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:51,530
the faster it will pulse oh my god it's like those like
metal detectors okay am i doing it correctly oh it's pulsing

867
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,580

870
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:17,570
No.

871
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:19,530
Where are the crystals?

872
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,290
Oh, it's like a little mini-game.

873
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:24,670
Don't worry.

874
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:25,990
I drown.

875
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,770
Guys, don't worry.

876
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:28,750
I drown.

877
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:34,510
No.

878
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,310
Where is the crystals?

879
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,590
Am I stuck?

880
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,390
Oh, I got stuck and it kicked me out.

881
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,590
I can jump, but like...

882
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:52,190
No, Choco, where is the power crystals?

883
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,970
Please.

884
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,070
I just want to find Kuro-Ming.

885
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:00,330
Oh.

886
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,390
It's beeping.

887
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,850
It's near.

888
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:08,550

This is Minecraft now.

893
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,310
It's Minecraft time.

894
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:53,630

895
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:54,430

Oh, I'm climbing.

898
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,190
What am I gonna do with a stamina apple slice?

899
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,490
Yay!

900
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,250
Yellow power crystals.

901
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,490
Okay, we got... Oh, wait, I can glide!

902
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:09,710

Oh no, there's a...

904
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,770
I got stuck on the pillar.

905
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,670
The game was like, trying to kick me out of the pillar.

906
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,350
Oh my god, we're mobile gaming for real.

907
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,990
How many power crystals do I need?

908
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,490
Did it tell me?

909
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,950
I don't remember if it told me.

910
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,510
Okay.

911
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:35,830
Did it tell me how many?

912
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:37,970

913
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:40,770

What was this?

919
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:15,990
Sand Dollar.

920
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:18,190
Oh my god, it's like Animal Crossing Sand Dollars.

921
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:21,310
Better than World of Warcraft.

922
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,370
100% better than World of Warcraft.

923
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,730
Butters was right.

924
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,230
Oh, that's a sprint.

925
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,350
Okay, we don't need to do that.

926
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,570
We're not going to play that game.

927
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,190
Look, this is important.

928
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,550
We need to find Karomi.

929
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,370
Please start beeping.

930
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,250
Start beeping.

931
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:51,670
is the queen oh my god where is it it's not beeping anymore
oh it's right here it's up here yeah this game is actually

932
01:04:51,670 --> 01:05:00,930
real i think the funniest part for me about this game is the
fact that it's like the same type like the same name as as

933
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:08,790
the cell puck reference they did that on purpose they had to
do that done that on purpose just for the memes the other

934
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:17,930
thing is that i can't believe JP agreed to it because like
this is like NA's idea you know it's obviously like NA's

935
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:28,450
idea to do it so like I'm like more surprised that JP agreed
to it because you know you know it's it's self-park the fact

936
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:41,850
that they agreed to have a reference like to like self-park
in the end is actually crazy where the fuck is it It's so

937
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,530
vibrating.

938
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,630
Sit down here.

939
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:48,890
Oh, it's here.

940
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:49,290
It's here.

941
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,270
Oh, it's here.

942
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,090
I found it.

943
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,250
It has to be this dungeon.

944
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,410
No, please.

945
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,170
Open up.

946
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:00,130
Open up.

947
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,890
I need a sea.

948
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:03,950
I need a rescue Kuromi.

949
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:05,770
Oh, no.

950
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:06,790
What the fuck?

951
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,710
There's a puzzle?

952
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:09,770
Okay.

know i put this here guys guys these puzzles are very

954
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:35,010
difficult children this is why this is not a kid's game chat
this is exactly why this is not a kid's game a normal child

955
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:37,570
would not be able to figure this out unlike me

956
01:06:42,030 --> 01:07:00,530
up yay yay another pile here I got another yellow power
crystal let's go thanks ChocoCat for not helping oh no I

957
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:11,490

960
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:44,690
Okay, this doesn't matter.

961
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,090
This doesn't matter.

962
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,390
It's just a normal chest.

963
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:49,650
Wait, where's Choco Cat?

964
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,710
Where did Choco Cat go?

965
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,070
It left me.

966
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,290
Choco Cat?

967
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,540
Oh, it's this way.

968
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,090
Choco Cat?

969
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:00,730
Just a moment?

970
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:03,490
Where is he?

971
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,930
Take a look at that.

972
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:06,770
What, the tree?

973
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,190
Oh, it's over here!

974
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:15,670
The power crystal sensor indicates a yellow power crystal on
the island over there.

975
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:21,550
But this bridge will not sophisticate carry us across.

976
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,470
My melody is quite handy.

977
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:24,730
Perhaps she would be able to help.

978
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,370
Why don't they get her to help?

979
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:28,950
She's gonna ask...

980
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:29,590
What the fuck?

981
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,390
Where did you come from?

982
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,690
She's gonna ask me to get her something.

983
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,110
Like, she's not gonna do it for free.

984
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:39,690
She's the Tom Nook of Sanrio Halle Kitty Island Adventure.

985
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,110
He doesn't do shit for free, and I don't think she does it
for free either.

986
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:47,510
A broken bridge?

987
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:48,670
I may be able to help.

988
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:52,910
I bought a lot of drilling materials in the strawberry
crates when we came.

989
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:54,770
I haven't found them all yet.

990
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,250
See, I told you.

991
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,670
If you can find two strawberry crates...

992
01:08:58,670 --> 01:08:59,530
Oh, I have those already.

993
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,090
Never mind.

994
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,230
I already have it.

995
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,470
Perfect.

996
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,910
Give me those to me, and we'll look at that bridge.

997
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:07,590

Decorate and customize them to attract visitors like dear
Daniel and Mimi.

1048
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:25,050
I love how like those were the example.

1049
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,450
The better you decorate their taste, the better.

1050
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,950
Oh, I just need to decorate it to look like...

1051
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,670
Look like Sonomoro's house.

1052
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:35,710
Oh, you fucking...

1053
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:36,870
This is how they get you.

1054
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,770
This is how they get you.

1055
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:40,970
Fucking...

1056
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:45,710
Melody was like, come to my store and buy the furniture for
the ones you want.

1057
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,950
Oh, my God.

1058
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,430

1059
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,050
Oh, my God.

1060
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:57,230
I'm so sad.

1061
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,130
This is how they get you.

1062
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,530
This is how they get you.

1063
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,250
What do I get from this, though?

1064
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:09,090
We.

1065
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,590
Oh, shit.

1066
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,490
I went the wrong way.

1067
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:12,590
Wee.

1068
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,430
Oh, shit.

1069
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,950
I went the wrong way again.

1070
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:19,590
Guys, I don't think I'm going to fucking do this challenge
correctly.

1071
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:20,730
Wee.

1072
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:21,830
Unless.

1073
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:22,270
No.

1074
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,710
Oh, hey.

1075
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,730
I got a crate, though.

1076
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,470
You stopped yourself.

1077
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,750
Guys, I was very mad.

1078
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,170
I might.

1079
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,050
I might have got a little toxic.

1080
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,990
I can't believe it.

1081
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:40,570
I can't.

1082
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,350
I can't believe this is how she's getting me.

1083
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:46,350
No.

1084
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:47,410
Oh, no.

1085
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:48,950

1086
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,730
Oh, he's right here.

1087
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:53,410

01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,330
Okay, here you go.

card.

1092
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:06,450
I knew it.

1093
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,930
I knew there was a pay-to-win feature.

1094
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,570

1192
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,270
So, do you live here?

1193
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:28,650
We only just arrived on the island not long ago.

1194
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:31,810
I don't know.

1195
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,450
I can't remember anything.

1196
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:35,910
Nothing at all?

1197
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:37,770
That's odd.

1198
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:43,450
Well, except I was floating way up high.

1199
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,030
I saw that too.

1200
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,450
You're floating over the island.

1201
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,350
Yes, but what were you doing up there?

1202
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,650

1203
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:55,270
Did your plane cake make your malfunction like ours?

1204
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,730

1205
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:00,030
Is that plane gonna crash somewhere?

1206
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,210

1220
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,200
Whoops, I dropped an orange.

1221
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,560

1222
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,380

1223
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:58,540
Decorate the cabin.

1224
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,560
No, we are not decorating anything.

1225
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,140
Who is this?

1226
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,800

1227
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,820

1236
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,160

01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,420

01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,220
Guys, we're gonna find her, guys.

1241
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,640
We just gotta figure out how to get across.

1242
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,760
How to get across.

1243
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,600
Oh my god.

1244
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,640

There's a chest, though.

1255
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,380
There's a chest.

1256
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:32,680
Give me a sec.

1257
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,420
I got distracted.

1258
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,320
Yeah.

1259
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:39,860
I got pants.

1260
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,220
Guys, you think the game is telling me something?

1261
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,240
No.

1262
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,200
No.

1263
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:48,640
No.

1264
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:53,080
Guys, it's so funny, the game gave me pants.

1265
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,720
I wonder why.

1266
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,160
No pants for this dragon.

1267
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,820
This dragon doesn't need pants.

1268
01:26:58,980 --> 01:26:59,380
Oh, coconut.

1269
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,180
Oh, no.

1270
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,780
Did I softlock myself accidentally?

1271
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,260
No way.

1272
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,320
Okay, we'll figure out how to get around this.

1273
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,280
Dude, don't worry.

1274
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:14,900
Don't worry.

1275
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,380
We're gonna figure out how to get around it.

1276
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,620
Oh, it's like...

1277
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,240
Can I climb up this?

1278
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:22,220
Oh, shit.

1279
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:22,900
Okay, we're fine.

1280
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:24,080
We're fine.

1281
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:24,460
We're fine.

1282
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:24,840
We're fine.

1283
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,680
There's no way.

1284
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,040
There's no way.

1285
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,340
There must be a way for me to get across, right?

1286
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,760
Oh, yes, there is.

1287
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:32,800

I didn't realize I was playing for so long, guys.

1344
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:03,850
I didn't realize.

1345

01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:02,730
Alright, yeah, I don't know why it's here, but it clashes
with the spooky vibes it's got going.

1370
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,850
Is that a button on the mailbox?

1371
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:05,850
What does that mean?

1372
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,710
Delivery service.

1373
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:12,370
Let's see.

1374
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:13,930
Activate the mailbox.

1375
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:15,870
Whoa.

1376
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:17,930
Is this fast travel?

1377
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,070
Come on, me.

1378
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:21,530
Why are you telling what's glowing?

1379
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:23,490
I never did that before.

1380
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,250
Then again, I never yeah, I never bought it to touch it.

1381
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,550
I wonder why it's glowing.

1382
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,110
Anyways, you came just in time.

1383
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:38,430
I was hoping to send over this pumpkin to my melon, but I'm
right here.

1384
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:42,630
Come on, She'll never appreciate you like I do, Karomi.

1385
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:44,270
Karomi.

1386

I'll deliver the pumpkin.

1387
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:49,230
You don't do any work.

1388
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,370
Your hands are not meant for work.

1389
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:55,410
Cherry seed pumpkin.

1390
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:56,150
Thanks.

1391
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:57,630
That's a big help.

1392
01:33:58,850 --> 01:33:59,610
It's okay, Karobi.

1393
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:02,590
Don't do any work, Karomi.

1394
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:04,450
I'll do it for you.

1395
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,390
My queen.

1396
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,530
No, no.

1397
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:10,570
They were girlfriends.

1398
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,470
I refuse.

1399
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:13,710
I refuse.

1400
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:14,270
Konobi.

1401
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:17,430
Okay.

1402
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:19,350
An old mailbox.

1403
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,690
Someone must know how to use it.

1404
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:23,190
Wait.

1405
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:24,730
How do I deliver this?

1406
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:26,190

1407
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:26,890
No.

1408
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:28,350
Do we need something?

1409
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:29,570
I have a question.

1410
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:30,690
What's up?

1411
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:32,010
Would you break up with Melody?

1412
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,590
Konobi.

1413
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:38,230
Please.

1414
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:39,070
She doesn't.

1415
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,790
She doesn't deserve it!

1416
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:45,210
She doesn't deserve it!

1417
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:56,990

Everybody, no, none of them matches my standards.

1422
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:46,490
None of them match my standards for Konomi.

1423
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:48,890
No, I can't believe it.

1424
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:52,150
Alright, let's see.

1425
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:53,170

Wait, how the fuck do I use it, though?

1434
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,070
What the fuck?

1435
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:16,070

01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:19,950
Excuse me?

1438
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:23,250
Someone must know?

1439
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:24,910
Who's that someone?

1440
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:26,690
Who?

1441
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:28,570
Sorry, Kuromi.

1442
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:29,930
Oh, hey, there's an apple.

1443
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:31,390
Oh, I can't get there.

1444
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:33,030
Sorry, Kuromi.

1445
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:34,510

Sorry.

1448
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:41,490
The moment I find Sonomoro, I don't need you anymore.

1449
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:45,680
I just...

1450
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,370

1451
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:49,580

1452
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:51,640
He's my first Sanrio love.

1453
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:54,490
Karopi!

1454
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:57,730

I didn't see anyone else land with me.

1460
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:12,630
Um, they landed in the resort.

1461

1738
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:11,280

The map is just gone on the top left corner, guys.

That's how lost I am.

1808

How do I get out of here?

1812
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,860
The map is just white.

1813
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:18,020
There's like no areas anymore.

1814
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:20,640

Maybe this is a sign I should go back to sleep.

2038
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:48,380
This non-functional ice cream boat is a great nap spot.

2067
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:09,900
Macron is a golden retriever who styles herself to look like
a Puro.

2068
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,220
She wears in a...

2069

Oh, my gosh.

2070
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:12,880

2071
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:14,720

02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:16,700
Okay, that's so sad.

02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:53,960
This game seems, but I wish it wasn't region locked.

2105
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:57,440
surprised that it's region locked.

2106
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:02,640
I thought this was like, I thought it would be like outside
of, like people outside of NE can play it.

2107
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:06,800
Maybe people can EU people download Hello Kitty Island
Adventures?

2108
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:10,500
Cause like I know like for Asia, you can't apparently.

2109
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:15,960
Cause my dad's Asia account couldn't download Hello Kitty
Island Adventures.

2110
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,020
That's so weird.

2111

02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,800
I was scared.

2115
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:33,220
