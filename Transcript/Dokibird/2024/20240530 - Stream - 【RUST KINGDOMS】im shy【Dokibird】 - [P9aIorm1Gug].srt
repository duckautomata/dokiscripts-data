1
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,020
Ah, hello!

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,460
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,460
Give me a sec, I'm getting a tour guide.

4
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,580
I'm getting a tour guide because like, I joined the server and I was like, this is overwhelming.

5
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,260
Okay, so, cause like, okay, I'm joining in like, very late, by the way, to the server.

6
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,600
The server is literally gonna be shut down in like, two days.

7
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,080
And I did get invited on launch and then so I was just like, I was like looking at the...

8
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,880
I was looking at the like, other streamers playing it and I was like, holy fuck, people are building mansions!

9
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,220
Mansions are already being built!

10
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,580
And I was just like, bro, what am I doing here?

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,240
I joined in so fucking late.

12
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,780
Um...

13
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,080
Yes, these servers are always like, uh, they're only there for like, cause it's like a content thing.

14
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,620
So for those who don't know, Rust Kingdoms is actually like a tw- Usually, I think it's like, majority Twitch streamers are on the server because of Twitch drops.

15
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,700
Just pretend you're getting drops on my stream.

16
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,760
Uh, just cause like, there's like, exclusive drops right now for everybody that's participating in the server.

17
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,600
But like, I'm not on Twitch, so...

18
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,260
So we'll pretend we're like, guys!

19
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,240
Oh my god!

20
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,400
If you watch five hours of this stream, you might be able to get that exclusive anime drop in Rust, guys!

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,920
Guys, I swear, just link your Steam account to YouTube, guys!

22
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,120
Um...

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,360
Um...

24
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
Uh, so...

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,580
Okay, let me see.

26
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,300
Uh, apparently...

27
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,700
Okay, so Gumi is gonna be my tour guide because I was like, okay, maybe I'll just...

28
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Maybe I'll just like, you know, wing this.

29
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,240
And like...

30
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,720
Maybe I'll like, meet somebody, like, by chance.

31
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,760
But then I...

32
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,340
I was looking at...

33
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,980
Like, just like, researching a little bit how the server's like.

34
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,980
And it is fucking wild.

35
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Like, it's...

36
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,980
It's wild!

37
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,400
Um...

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,620
And, uh...

39
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,880
And like, Gumi was telling me like, by the way, the Kingdom server is fucking wild.

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,860
Because like, it's like a...

41
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,140
It's like when you're at the Wild West and then, uh...

42
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,200
Like, it's anything goes type situation.

43
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,160
Like, that type of deal.

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,480
So...

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,480
So like, I'm worried I'm gonna get like, robbed and...

46
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,820
Because I'm just a baby!

47
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,700
I literally...

48
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm starting today!

49
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,020
So...

50
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,180
That's why I was like...

51
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,740
I was like, fuck, I think I might need like, protection.

52
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,440
I might need a bodyguard.

53
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,280
So I hit up...

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,580
I hit up Gumi like, last second.

55
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,280
Like, literally like, five minutes before...

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,060
Uh...

57
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,560
Before the stream started.

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,200
I was like, oh no, I'm chickening out.

59
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,080
I don't think I can...

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,740
I don't think I can do this by myself.

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,360
Because at first I was like, okay, Doki.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,740
Be fucking brave.

63
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,260
You got this, Doki.

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,280
You can do this by yourself.

65
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,760
You don't need a chaperone.

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,080
And then five minutes before the stream started, I cracked.

67
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,420
I was like, no I do.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,380
I need a chaperone.

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,900
I...

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,180
I need a chaperone.

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,160
Please, somebody.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,100
I am a baby.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,340
Somebody help me.

74
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,500
Oh no, it's night time.

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,380
I talked too long and now it's night time!

76
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,780
No!

77
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,040
Now I definitely need a chaperone.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,520
I need an adult.

79
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,440
I am lost.

80
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,640
I need an adult.

81
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,220
Oh god.

82
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,380
Shots.

83
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,120
Oh my god, there's shots out there too!

84
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,960
People are shooting at each other!

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,940
And I'm just sleeping on the ground naked!

86
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:38,980
Guys.

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,340
That is why...

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,600
Like the last...

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,980
Oh so by the way guys, I don't know if you guys noticed this but I did start...

90
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,880
I did start like 30 minutes later because I literally woke up at 11.30.

91
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,460
I was so fucking tired.

92
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,080
I was really exhausted.

93
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,820
I don't know.

94
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,200
I think like it's just everything like keep crashing down.

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,920
That's...

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,120
I didn't eat dinner last night.

97
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,520
Because all I did was like I just slept after the stream.

98
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
I was so fucking tired.

99
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,600
And then I just kept sleeping.

100
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,320
I would wake up and I was like, oh I think I could sleep a little bit more.

101
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,100
I even set alarms and everything.

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,440
I set alarms and everything.

103
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,860
But I still like went back to sleep.

104
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,160
So I've been like...

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,800
I've been like so tired.

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,380
That's why I have to push back the stream 30 minutes later.

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,460
Because I was like, oh man.

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,040
I can't.

109
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,600
I need more time to like reset my schedule.

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,300
Like I need more time to rebuild my energy.

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,660
Oh, it's daytime again.

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Oh my god.

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,440
Okay, I'm typing Gumi.

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,040
Okay.

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,960

116
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,400
Gumi will take care of me.

117
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,660
She's rich too.

118
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,300
I'm pretty sure she's rich and rest.

119
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,960
She's been playing since launch day.

120
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
I know you can gamble.

121
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,180
I saw a lot of people gambling already.

122
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,580
Do you think she'll like donate to me for me to gamble?

123
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,580
You think so?

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,380
Do you think guys do you think you think she'll give me guys?

I She's rich.

127
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,460
Oh, she has to pee.

Give me a sec guys.

129
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,340
Okay, you know what?

130
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,140
We can wake up.

131
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,020
What the fuck?

132
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
There's a castle behind me.

133
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,260
Holy shit.

134
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,660
Where am I?

135
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,400
Where am I?

136
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,900
Where am I?

137
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,560
Let's let's let's turn down this sensitivity.

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,700
Where is sensitivity?

139
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,520
Oh picks.

140
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Does it really matter?

141
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,460
Where the fuck is?

142
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,640
I'll control the area.

143
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,440
It should be the sense area.

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
Malice sensitivity.

145
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,840
When aiming down.

146
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,220
Oh wait, there's we don't need that.

147
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,680
Okay, 0.6 area.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,980
Oh, I mean lower.

149
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,100
Okay.

150
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Oh my God.

151
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,340
Everybody's fucking rich.

153
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:06,940

Holy shit.

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,580
Bro.

156
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,540
What the fuck?

157
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,100
Bro, the servers only been out for like how many days has served it up?

158
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,420
One to do this.

159
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,440
This is like four days.

160
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,360
What the fuck happened in four days?

161
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,700
It's like a town.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,080
Don't worry.

163
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,060
I had it pixelated.

164
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,480
It's like a fucking town.

165
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,980
The Hussey and Ender.

166
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,180
Holy shit.

167
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,880
That is a fucking town.

169
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh my God.

170
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,760
This is actually crazy.

171
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,680
In four days?

172
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,260
Is it?

173
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,380
Race players.

174
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,980
Oh hey, it's a horse.

175
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
Is it somebody horse?

176
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,740
Hold down use to open.

177
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,700
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,660
How do I steal their horse?

179
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,600
Whose horse is this?

180
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,180
How do I ride it?

181
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,860
Oh, it's locked in.

182
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,580
Wait, can I accidentally kill somebody's horse?

183
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,040
Aww.

184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Anything goes.

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,060
Wait, can I actually?

186
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,140
Wait!

187
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh!

188
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,620
Yoink.

189
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,420
I guess it's my horse now.

190
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,020
Yay!

191
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,900
Okay, I'm gonna message Gumi.

192
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,800
I stole a horse.

193
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Oh my god!

194
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,320
I have a horse!

195
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,980
I think people will be okay.

196
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,940
I think... I mean, they're rich!

197
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,460
There's no law here!

198
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
Oh my god!

199
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
Gumi's gonna pick me up with her car!

200
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,480
Okay, I'm gonna call her.

201
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,820
I'm gonna call her.

202
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,080
Oh my god, pick up the phone.

203
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,320
She's got... she has a car!

204
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,580
And I have a horse.

205
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,080
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

206
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,100
I can't believe it.

207
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,220
Guys, I just joined the game and I already have a horse, guys.

208
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,360
Guys, she already has a horse.

209
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,840
I stole a horse!

210
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,900
I don't know whose horse... whose horse this is!

211
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,760
Was it just out in the open?

212
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,480
It was like next to this castle.

213
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,620
Oh!

214
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,780
Whose castle is that?

215
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,940
Am I gonna make an enemy?

216
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,180
They won't know it's me, right?

217
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,260
No, no, no.

218
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,040
Horses are easy to come by.

219
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,920
Oh, okay.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,780
So they won't care about this missing horse.

221
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah, they just upped the spawn rate.

222
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,940
So it should be okay.

223
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,660
Yay!

224
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
Free castle horse!

225
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,020
Oh my god.

226
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
You might get shot on sight.

227
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,420
Wait, what?

228
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
While I'm on a horse?

229
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,600
But I'm naked!

230
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,020
Motherfuckers don't care.

231
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,760
Oh my god.

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,660
Here, there's some sweats and dessert for you.

233
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,300
Oh my god, I hear the shots.

234
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,460
I hear the shots.

235
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,620
I hear the shots in the distance.

236
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm scared.

237
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,700
Okay, oh my god.

238
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,000
How do I like make it so like the fucking horse doesn't like bounce up?

239
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,140
Oh my god.

240
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
A motion blur?

241
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,060
There's a motion blur.

242
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Hello?

243
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,400
Hello?

244
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,320
Are you an Earper?

245
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,200
What's an Earper?

246
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,920
I just joined.

247
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

248
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,680
I just found this horse like five seconds ago.

249
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,480
Oh, welcome.

250
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh fuck, you logged on at a wild time.

251
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,660
Why?

252
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,140
Everyone's doing wars right now.

253
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,460
Wait!

254
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,880
What?

255
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,760
Hello.

256
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,300
Give me all your money right now.

257
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,600
I just got in.

258
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm homeless.

259
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,000
No, not my horse.

260
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,700
I just... No!

261
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,980
Not my horse.

262
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,360
I just found a horse.

263
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:11,960
Please!

264
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,720
What did she do to you?

265
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,980
That's my dog.

266
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm literally... All I have is my horse, sir.

267
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
That's all I have.

268
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,580
Oh my god.

269
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,280
Oh my god.

270
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,560
Give me all the... They're shooting me in my horse!

271
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,540
They're shooting me in my horse!

272
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:30,880
No!

273
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,580
No!

274
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
Stop talking to him!

275
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,160
It's Espen!

276
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
I'm telling you, there's nachos everywhere.

277
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Bro!

278
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,980
She literally ran up to me and was like, give me all your money.

279
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,300
And I was like, I don't have anything.

280
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
I just have a horse.

281
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm telling you, there's freaks.

282
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,900
There's freaks.

283
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,160
There are freaks!

284
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,040
They just shot my horse!

285
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,000
The horse that I saw!

286
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,260
I'm telling you ahead of time, horses cannot go down rocks or stuff.

287
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,760
They can't climb.

288
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,040
You have to take them to a hill.

289
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,300
Oh my god, bro.

290
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,820
One of them was like, run away!

291
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,340
What do you mean there's war?

292
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,000
I literally just got here and there's a fucking war?

293
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,800
Oh, there's another horse.

294
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,960
How do I get off this horse?

295
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm gonna steal this horse.

296
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,520
Uh, jump the space.

297
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,980
I'm gonna steal this horse.

298
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,880
My other horse has like no health now.

299
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,560
Alright, sound guy, how's the...

300
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
Okay, I'm a ginger.

301
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,320
What?

302
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,980
Also, sound guy, oh shit, sorry.

303
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,260
Sound guy, I hope the sound's okay.

304
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,860
Sound guy, good luck.

305
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,460
Good luck.

306
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,520
The sounds are so hard to balance in this game.

307
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,840
Where are you, Gumi?

308
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm at the castle where the guy that shot me was.

309
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,500
Okay, hold G for me.

310
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,300
Yeah?

311
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,120
Okay.

312
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,660
I'm here.

313
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,420
There's a church.

314
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,680
Uh, Q... Q5.

315
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,260
Next to the... I'm like almost close to Q6.

316
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,620
Okay, so if you're at the church, that's the church of the blood god.

317
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,860
And...

318
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,520
Oh, I...

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,180
Don't these sound cool?

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,540
Yeah, they might ask for you to die a couple times for them.

321
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,320
Wait, why?

322
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,040
For the blood god.

323
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,120
Oh, I mean, that sounds right.

324
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,280
What?

325
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,860
Yo, wait, I wanna check out the blood god.

326
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,580
Sounds pretty cool.

327
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,160
Wait, that's... I was next to the blood god church!

328
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,060
One of the guys shot... One of the guys that tried to mug me was the blood god disciple.

329
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,580
Maybe.

330
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,440
Wait, wait, I'll wait for you at the blood god.

331
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,120
Okay, if you stay inside and... it might be safe.

332
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,860
It might be safe?

333
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,480
It's like a safe place?

334
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,060
I'm running around.

335
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,440
No.

336
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,400
Well...

337
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,500
Oh.

338
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,680
Maybe.

339
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,580
Wait.

340
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,680
There's not really a safe place anymore.

341
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,020
What?

342
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,140
I'm telling you...

343
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,540
At this time of day, there's wars going on where like 40 people go to invade another base and then...

344
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,920
What the fuck?

345
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,180
They're usually fighting in the middle of the map and everything.

346
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,440
What?

347
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,820
Okay, I'm on the server.

348
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,780
I'm in my car.

349
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,860
I'm on my way.

350
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,020
Okay.

351
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,720
I'm just checking out the church.

352
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,340
Yeah, I'll even bring you food too.

353
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,160
Oh, thank god.

354
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,540
I think I'm starving and dying of thirst right now.

355
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,400
Wait.

356
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,000
Is there a casino?

357
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
I know Russ has casino.

358
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,440
There's multiple.

359
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,660
There's multiple?

360
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,240
Can you bring me to the biggest casino?

361
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,040
And can I like... can you like lend me some cash?

362
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,060
What?

363
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,600
You know I'm good for it, Gumi.

364
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,380
You know I can repay you.

365
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,160
I have a horse.

366
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000
Your horse owl will take it.

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,160
Oh, you almost died?

368
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,140
No, I ditched that one and I stole another one.

369
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,620
So like I have two horses now, technically.

370
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,940
Yeah.

371
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,740
You know, I'll loan you the horse.

372
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,800
The horse is my deposit.

373
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,240
Yeah, sure.

374
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,660
I'll give you the horse's collateral.

375
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,680
I don't need horses.

376
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,580
I'll be honest.

377
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,840
I have a car.

378
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,140
Yeah, but like it's not the same as a horse.

379
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,380
The horse is cuter.

380
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,280
No, I actually have two horses too.

381
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,900
Yeah, but my horse is orange.

382
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Orange?

383
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah, just like me because I'm Ginger on the server.

384
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,980
Oh, hey, it's daytime.

385
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,020
Yeah, I'm Ginger.

386
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,680
You'll see me.

387
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,840
Okay.

388
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,500
Do you have your cock and balls out or something?

389
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah, I do.

390
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,140
I don't have clothes.

391
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,320
I look down and it's just pixels.

392
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,780
Oh my god.

393
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm driving over right now.

394
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,620
I hear more gunshots.

395
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,640
I took my fastest car for you.

396
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,180
I hear more gunshots coming.

397
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,180
I'm so scared.

398
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:08,840
Please.

399
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,580
My first experience with strangers was that they tried to mug me.

400
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,120
And I was broke.

401
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,080
I got mugged.

402
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,020
There's gonna be a lot of that.

404
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,520
Wait.

405
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm on my way over right now.

406
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,500
Okay, I'll wait for you.

407
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,980
Guys, don't worry.

408
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,420
I twerk.

409
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:35,920
Is that you?

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,500
I see you!

411
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,580
Wait, no, that is not me.

412
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,580
Okay, I know who he was running away from.

413
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,660
Holy shit.

414
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,280
Oh my god.

415
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,680
I saw...

416
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,620
There's like...

417
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,600
Gumi, I'm a little scared because there's a lot of gunshots around me.

418
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,740
Yeah.

419
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,620
I know where I'm not going.

420
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,640
That's for sure.

421
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,120
Wait, how's... What's your house like?

422
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,560
I live with Abe and them.

423
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,900
Oh shit.

424
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,480
You live with the admin?

425
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

426
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,740
Wait, do you guys get benefits?

427
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,500
Not that I know of.

428
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,040
Wait, but you live with the admin.

429
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,180
Oh my god.

430
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,100
I see people chasing my...

431
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,380
Leave my stuff so help me Jesus.

432
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,520
I'm scared.

433
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,420
Is that what one of them said?

434
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,300
Yeah, that's what Cutie Cinderella said in chat.

435
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,640
Ah.

436
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,360
I can't believe it.

437
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,360
You're with the admin.

438
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,040
Yeah.

439
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,900
Oh my god, there's a huge crowd over there.

440
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,380
Oh my god, they just killed somebody.

441
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,760
I just saw them murder.

442
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,360
Okay, I'm on the road.

443
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm currently... If you held G, I'm at L15.

444
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,500
L15.

445
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,100
I'm on my way.

446
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,780
Is that you?

447
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,160
Girl, I said L15, man.

448
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,180
Oh my god, there's another car heading towards me.

449
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,380
I hope they don't run me over.

450
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,680
No, no, no.

451
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,320
Did you die?

452
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,260
It's been...

453
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,660
Okay,

454
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,700
respond again and let me know where you are.

455
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,360
Where am I?

456
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,700
Okay.

457
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,560
I am... I am... I am at P2.

458
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,900
P2?

459
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
I... Look, I... Okay, I'll start running.

460
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,280
I'll start running.

461
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,560
No, no.

462
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Just go back.

463
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,020
Don't go back to the church.

464
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,600
You can...

465
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Just head to the nearest road and then hide in a tree or something.

466
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,580
Oh, I found another horse!

467
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,780
Okay, like... I... I... I... Okay.

468
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,840
When I noticed it was Espen, I was like, I'm gonna die.

469
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,920
I'm so dead.

470
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,980
I got ran over by Espen.

471
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,820
I can't believe... They didn't even give me a warning.

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
They just ran me over.

473
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,500
They just ran me over.

474
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,300
They just ran me over.

475
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,160
They just... They just fucking ran me over, Goomy.

476
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,360
What is this town?

477
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,220
Yeah...

478
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah...

479
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
What... What are these Neanderthals here?

480
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,640
Yeah... They're very much...

481
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,300
Uka-Buka... Get down.

482
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,360
Get down.

483
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,500
Give me your money.

484
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,200
Yeah...

485
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,700
I just thought... I just thought they would give me a warning.

486
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,920
You know?

487
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,880
Okay, I am at... I am at Q4.

488
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,240
Where are you at?

489
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,080
Q4?

490
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,840
Yeah.

491
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,060
I'm currently at P9 if you wanna run this way.

492
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,200
P9?

493
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,440
Where the fuck is P?

494
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:04,940
P9?

495
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,140
Guys, where is P9?

496
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,900
Chat.

497
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,460
Wait, that's so far!

498
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,060
Wait, no.

499
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,860
That's not so far.

500
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
That's almost there.

501
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,520
Okay.

502
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,560
Oh.

503
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,720
Oh.

504
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,580
Oh.

505
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,260
Oh.

506
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,940
There's gunshots around me, Goomy.

507
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,480
I'm scared.

508
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,740
Yeah...

509
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,900
I'm so scared.

510
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Okay.

511
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,040
I'm slowly walking on the road.

512
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,420
Ooh.

513
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,660
That's a nice bar.

514
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,320
Ooh.

515
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,160
Wow.

516
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,040
This is a nice town.

517
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,220
Oh.

518
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,080
P9.

519
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,800
P9.

520
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Okay.

521
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,700
I'm on the road.

522
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,100
So you might bump into me while I'm walking on the road.

523
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,640
Well, I mean, I'm naked.

524
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,220
Why would they hurt a naked person?

525
00:21:59,660 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh.

526
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,840
Do not go on the road.

527
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,180
Girl, you just got killed.

528
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,480
Okay, but I...

529
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,500
You got hit twice.

530
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,520
Okay, but it was S-Fan.

531
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,900
So like, it was... like, you know, it's... it's...

532
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,560
Maybe the other people are nicer.

533
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,860
Wait, why do I not go on the road?

534
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,940
Um... There might be a lot of people that shoot you on the road.

535
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,660
Huh?

536
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,460
But I'm naked.

537
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:22,840
Okay.

538
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,700
Where... where are you?

539
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm on... R5.

540
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,260
R5?

541
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,840
Okay.

542
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,700
I'm on my way.

543
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,960
Oh, there's a sheriff's office.

544
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,320
Yeah... That's not real.

545
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,100
Oh.

546
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,740
What do you mean?

547
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,140
What do you mean that's not real?

548
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,740
They're not real.

549
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,020
They're not...

550
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,840
They're...

551
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,980
Are you telling me that there's no laws here?

552
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,080
But...

553
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,160
But this is a town.

554
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,900
They have the thrifty cow.

555
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,300
They have the sheriff's office.

556
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,860
There was a bar earlier.

557
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,880
It's a trap.

558
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,780
Wait, is the sheriff's office a trap?

559
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,660
Okay, I'm here.

560
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,020
I'm here.

561
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,340
I'm here.

562
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,220
Where... where are you?

563
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,960
I'm at R... You're at R5, right?

564
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,580
Yes.

565
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm... Oh, is that you?

566
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,820
Is that your car?

567
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,800
Wait, you're the wrong person.

568
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,440
Hello?

569
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,540
No, I'm here.

570
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,560
This is me.

571
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,540
Oh my God, you're naked too.

572
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,920
Shadi, get in.

573
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,820
Okay, wait.

574
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,540
What about my horse?

575
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,740
No, I'm not.

576
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,500
It's because my chicken can't fit.

577
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:31,820
Look.

578
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,560
Oh.

579
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,540
Wait, that's so cool.

580
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,320
Wait, can I bring my horse over?

581
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,620
No, I'll give you a better horse.

582
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,680
Oh, okay.

583
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,620
Wait, how do I... how do I get in?

584
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,480
I have to unlock the door.

585
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,940
Get in, hurry.

586
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,600
Oh, I hear shots.

587
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,180
I hear shots.

588
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,780
Oh my God.

589
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
Logan, move.

590
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,220
Logan, hurry.

591
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,280
Wait, who the fuck is that guy?

592
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,260
Beaten Tekken.

593
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,760
Bro, that's the guy killed in Tekken.

594
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,620
Yeah.

595
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,560
He was in the senior's lab.

596
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,360
I was like, wait a minute.

597
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
I remember Logan.

598
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,000
All right.

599
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,400
Where are we going first?

600
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,960
Yeah, he was the Hwadong player.

601
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,880
Yeah, he was that fucking guy that beat the shit out of me in the first round.

602
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,100
And then he beat the shit out of me in the second round.

603
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,660
All right.

604
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,700
Why are we AFK?

605
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,480
Gumi, what's going on?

606
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,300
Gumi, what?

607
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,780
I'm gonna take you to safer areas in, um, of the server, okay?

608
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,580
Oh, okay.

609
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,220
Yeah.

610
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,540
That's fine.

611
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,120
That sounds nice.

612
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,980
Okay, let me, uh...

613
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,500
I'm gonna talk to you on Discord because I can't hear over the driving.

614
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,380
Wait, not even with your audio stuff?

615
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,820
No.

616
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,080
It's like...

617
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,300
It depends on the car and sometimes if I'm driving in this specific car, it's really loud.

618
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,280
Oh.

619
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,280
Oh, I see.

620
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,360
Oh shit, sorry.

621
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,080
What the fuck?

622
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
You didn't need that window, right?

623
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,600
You didn't need that window, right?

624
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,880
Yeah.

625
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,860
Yeah, I didn't need it.

626
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,180
How do I?

627
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,420
I don't know how to shi- What was that?

628
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,140
Don't look.

629
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:22,620
What?

630
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,020
What was that?

631
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,360
Don't look.

632
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,880
Are we getting chased?

633
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,740
Are we?

634
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:29,920
Are we?

635
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,760
No, no, no.

636
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,660
Just don't look.

637
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,780
No, there's- nobody's chasing us now.

638
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,460
We're okay.

639
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,960
We're safe.

640
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,720
Yeah, because I'm speeding away.

641
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,080
They would just shoot a car like that?

642
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,700
Yeah.

643
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,440
That's fucked up.

644
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,600
We're like innocent bystanders.

645
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,820
You should tell them.

646
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,880
Radiation poisoning?

647
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,360
Oh.

648
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,660
Radiation poisoning?

649
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,700
Hey, are you okay?

650
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,640
You know how- how- how- Yeah?

651
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,380
Why am I getting radiation poisoning?

652
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,180
Is it- is it gone yet?

653
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,380
14 seconds.

654
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,020
Where did you take me?

655
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,940
Here, come here.

656
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,780
Okay.

657
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,440
Yeah?

658
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,600
So you can have this, this.

659
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,220
Oh!

660
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,280
Oh my god.

661
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,820
Water too?

662
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,520
I'm rich.

663
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,560
Eat up and drink up in the car.

664
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,180
Oh wait, I can- wait, you locked it.

665
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,980
Sorry, there you go.

666
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,020
How do I eat?

667
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,740
Uh, you can right click it or no, click in your inventory.

668
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,520
Yeah?

669
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
Oh, okay, eat.

670
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,620
Alright, nice.

671
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,680
Oh, nice!

672
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,580
And I get corn too!

673
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,480
Oh my god, I feel so pampered right now.

674
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,080
That's my sugar daddy, guys.

675
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,600
That's my sugar daddy.

676
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,460
Doctor.

677
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,060
Gumi, can I get- can I get some cash for the casino?

678
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,640
Whoa.

679
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,800
Look out.

680
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,610
Yeah, don't talk about cash on the streets, you know it's what like-

681
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,330
Oh my god.

682
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,890
Are we going to your house right now?

683
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,410
Yeah.

684
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,990
Oh my god, guys.

685
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,410
Let me just make sure we're going the right way.

686
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,130
Oh, okay.

687
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:28,990
Guys!

688
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,650
Guys!

689
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,930
Gumi's gonna take me to her house!

690
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,810
Put clothes on?

691
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,050
But that's what- that's what my sugar daddy looks like.

692
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,390
Yeah, I like her naked.

693
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,290
Oh my god.

694
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,330
Gumi said if I stop wearing clothes, she'll lend me money for the casino.

695
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,790
Hey, don't worry, baby.

696
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,130
I got clothes for you at home.

697
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,990
Oh, yay!

698
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,970
Some from Victoria's Secret, if you know that.

699
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,150
Oh yay!

700
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,050
Oh my god, you have a whole gated community?

701
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,210
Girl, this is not the community.

702
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,050
Oh, okay.

703
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:11,470
Sorry.

704
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,750
But there is one.

705
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,830
I'll take you to it.

706
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,350
Oh my god.

707
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,870
Wait, how many houses do you have?

708
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,050
Yeah, about 20.

709
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:20,630
What?

710
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,130
Oh my god.

711
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,350
Guys, I scored one.

712
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,690
Oh my god, I'm set for life.

713
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,050
I can hear you.

714
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,050
As long as I look pretty for you, it's okay, right?

715
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,690
Yeah.

716
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,170
Oh, you see that?

717
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:38,790
There's a bear.

718
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:39,910
Wait, there's a bear.

719
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,510
Oh my god, where?

720
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,230
Yeah, you don't want to look at it.

721
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,530
Wait, I want to look at the bear.

722
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:45,810
Oh.

723
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:46,850
What?

724
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,230
Okay.

725
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,550
Yeah, I want to see it.

726
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,810
I mean, your car is faster than the bear, right?

727
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,440
It is.

728
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,100
Yay!

729
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,680
Oh, see?

730
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,280
Look!

731
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,140
Oh my god, guys!

732
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,680
It's like a wildlife safari.

733
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,540
Guys, there's a bear.

734
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,260
Guys, look!

735
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,540
Wait, wait, make him chase us.

736
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,700
Yeah, give me one second.

737
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,380
Let me just...

738
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,060
That would be so cool.

739
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
That would be so funny.

740
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,000
Look!

741
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,700
Look at guys!

742
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,540
It's just like wildlife safari!

743
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,400
Oh my god, it's just like those arcade games where the bear follows you.

744
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,100
You know those arcade machines where you had the safari animals run at you?

745
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,060
It's just like that.

746
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,180
Alright, this is my home.

747
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,280
This?

748
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,840
Uh-huh.

749
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,840
Wait.

750
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,380
Wait, it's all that is yours?

751
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,320
Look at the front.

752
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,340
Oh, oh!

753
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,060
Wait, your house is in a cave.

754
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840
Wait, I want to check it out.

755
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,100
What happened?

756
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,960
This is my garage.

757
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,240
You have a garage?

758
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,020
Oh, I want to check it out.

759
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,480
So this is your cave home?

760
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,620
Yeah, I can't let you in there because I don't know what your grubby little hands will grab.

761
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,820
I would not grab anything!

762
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,900
You know that!

763
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,360
You know I wouldn't grab anything, Gumi!

764
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,600
You can trust me!

765
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm your trophy wife!

766
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,880
Look at this!

767
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,520
Ooh, what is that?

768
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,920
Jelly's Taxi Service.

769
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,440
Oh.

770
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,140
Distraction.

771
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,940
Wait, you can call it a taxi?

772
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,600
How do you call it a taxi?

773
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,740
Wait, I wanna... Gumi, wait, where did you go?

774
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm inside.

775
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,480
Oh, you're inside?

776
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,400
Gumi, let me in!

777
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,400
Yeah, I'll give you a gun too, okay?

778
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,220
A gun!

779
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:45,900
Yay!

780
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,320
Ooh, but clothes.

781
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,600
Should I have clothes on?

782
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,600
Yeah, you might get radiation poisoning if you don't.

783
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,020
Okay.

784
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,240
Please, I promise I won't steal your items.

785
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,820
Gumi, I promise.

786
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,180
Gumi, I prom...

787
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,540
Let me in.

788
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,780
Last time, Abe...

789
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,600
Abe said...

790
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,480
Let me in.

791
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,400
Abe said he was gonna beat my ass if I let people in.

792
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,040
I'll be your dirty little secret!

793
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,380
The hell?

794
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,640
Don't worry!

795
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,680
Don't worry!

796
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,160
They won't know!

797
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,500
I'm good at keeping secrets!

798
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
Oh no.

799
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,040
Yeah, but it's a thrill, you know?

800
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,940
We both have our little secret.

801
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,360
The thrill of it.

802
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,180
We'll keep it just between us!

803
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,820
Come on!

804
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,160
I wanna see how cool your house is on the inside!

805
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,410
Come on, Gumi!

806
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,150
Come on!

807
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,510
You can't just leave me shivering and cold on the outside!

808
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,430
Come on!

809
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,430
You can't just leave me shivering and cold on the outside!

810
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:07,470
Come on!

811
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:07,850
You can't just leave me shivering and cold on the outside!

812
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,210
Uh oh.

813
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:08,970
Team mate's here.

814
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,330
Uh oh.

815
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,550
Team mate's here.

816
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,570
Nobody's here.

817
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,350
What are you talking about?

818
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,090
Oh!

819
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,010
Hello!

820
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,370
Hello!

821
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,330
My friend.

822
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,410
She just joined today.

823
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,750
Yeah, I'm new here.

824
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,670
Okay, welcome.

825
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,370
Oh, nice, nice.

826
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,370
Oh my god.

827
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,990
A mace?

828
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,610
And a guitar?

829
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,610
Yeah.

830
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,690
I'm gonna teach you how to get money.

831
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,110
Yeah.

832
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,190
I'm gonna teach you how to get money.

833
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,450
Wait... I'm not gonna make money then.

834
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,290
How do I play it?

835
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,710
How do I play it?

836
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,450
Take it out in your hand.

837
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,390
Put it in your hand.

838
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,170
PUT IT IN YOUR HAND!

839
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,990
I'm a busker!

840
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,990
Hold right click.

841
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,690
Hold right click.

842
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,010
Yeah?

843
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,630
Hold it down, man.

844
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:00,850
Yeah?

845
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,130
I'm doing it!

846
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,830
Now you're playing.

847
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,490
I'm doing it!

848
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,550
How do I play other notes?

849
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,430
Here you go.

850
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,430
Oh, and I also get a gun?

851
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,450
That's a baby gun for babies.

852
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,430
It's okay.

853
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,930
I can defend myself now.

854
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:25,730
Alright.

855
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,630
How...

856
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,470
Have you played Rust before?

857
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,670
N-W-Once.

858
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,070
Do you know how to get money?

859
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,010
No.

860
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,670
Okay, get in.

861
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,090
Don't worry, I'll play for us.

862
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,330
Well, life can be so beautiful sometimes.

863
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,890
Isn't it beautiful?

864
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,350
My services are one note per...

865
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,130
uh...

866
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,190
uh... one scrap per note.

867
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,030
I'll take you out of this goddamn car and take your clothes.

868
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,750
But for you it's free!

869
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,050
Just so you know.

870
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,130
Here you go.

871
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,970
Isn't it beau- Do you think your teammate knew I wanted to...

872
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,050
break in?

873
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,030
Yeah.

874
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,010
Oh.

875
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,690
You think they're friendly?

876
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,490
What if I come out?

877
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,550
We should go there and I'll play them a song.

878
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,770
And I'll tell them I'm here to busk for money.

879
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:23,930
Oh, it's okay.

880
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,970
It's just Leslie and Foolish fighting over there.

881
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,910
I'll take you...

882
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,810
I'll take you to the castle.

883
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,250
The castle?

884
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,370
Is it the one up front?

885
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,450
Is that your house?

886
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,890
Yeah, it's an actual gated community.

887
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,550
Wait, that's a gated community?

888
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,610
How do we get inside?

889
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,050
You have to have the code.

890
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,270
What's the code?

891
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,070
Sorry, my car was too close.

892
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,010
Um, I can't tell you until you join the gated community.

893
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,550
But I can...

894
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,010
I can earn my way up there.

895
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,470
I'm here plus one.

896
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,650
Yeah, you have to be here with me every time I clock in.

897
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,830
Yeah, but like...

898
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,970
I should get the code too because like...

899
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,910
I'm good for it, you know?

900
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,350
Oh my god, that's another horse.

901
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,870
Yeah, how do I know you're not gonna steal that guy's horse?

902
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,950
Look, I looked at the horse.

903
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,350
It doesn't mean I actually was gonna steal it.

904
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

905
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,590
Oh my god.

906
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,750
Oh, there's a bar!

907
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,010
Oh, Tina's here!

908
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,450
Who's here?

909
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,430
Here, let's park here.

910
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:29,970
Okay.

911
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,430
Grandpa!

912
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,230
Wait!

913
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,450
Grandpa!

914
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,910
Hi grandpa!

915
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,780
I brought my friend.

916
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,820
She just joined today.

917
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,800
Yeah, she just joined today.

918
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,280
She gave me clothes and a guitar.

919
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,500
Really?

920
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,500
Cool.

921
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,260
I think Tina's here too.

922
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,640
Oh.

923
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,180
You wanna help me test something?

924
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh yeah, sure.

925
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,960
What is it?

926
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,060
Wait, actually...

927
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,940
Does it involve death?

928
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,000
Can you go inside here?

929
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,700
Oh yeah, sure.

930
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,160
No, no, no.

931
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,980
No killing.

932
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,300
Okay, no killing.

933
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,780
Okay, sure.

934
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,320
I think he's just testing if it works electronically.

935
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,100
Oh!

936
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,940
It's like a prison cell!

937
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,100
Hello.

938
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,400
Me?

939
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,640
Me?

940
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,040
What?

941
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,200
Oh my god, there's like...

942
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,960
Wait, what?

943
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:22,980
What?

944
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,240
Wait, wait, wait!

945
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,000
No!

946
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,600
No!

947
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,860
Nightmare!

948
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,260
Nightmare!

949
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:32,980
Nightmare!

950
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,420
Nightmare!

951
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:33,920
Nightmare!

952
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Nightmare!

953
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,700
Nightmare!

954
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Nightmare!

955
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Nightmare!

956
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,280
Wait, wait, I'm okay.

957
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,660
I'm okay.

958
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:35,980
I'm okay.

959
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,520
Oh my god.

960
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:36,860
I'm okay.

961
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,200
Was it scary?

962
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,300
Yes, it was very scary.

963
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,260
I have trauma now.

964
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,100
Okay, I'm gonna eat.

965
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,920
Oh, perfect.

966
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,100
Perfect?

967
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
What the fuck?

968
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,940
Yeah, I'm telling you, there's freaks everywhere.

969
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,800
Oh my god!

970
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,160
You're friends with him?

971
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,860
That's my grandpa.

972
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,700
Wait, do I get paid for this?

973
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,160
I played a song.

974
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,160
Do I...

975
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,880
Do I get paid for testing it?

976
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,240
What?

977
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
That's no money.

978
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:06,980
What?

979
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
What do you mean no money?

980
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,940
I tested it for you.

981
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
My services aren't cheap.

982
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:11,980
Donkey run inside!

983
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,500
Donkey run!

984
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,320
Thank you!

985
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,140
Thank you, sir.

986
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,160
Here's a free song.

987
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,460
No problem.

988
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,400
Wait, why run inside?

989
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,560
Why run inside?

990
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,820
Did you not hear those gunshots just now?

991
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,680
No, I was too busy begging for money.

992
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,860
Welcome to the castle.

993
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,780
Hahaha!

994
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,300
Wow!

995
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Wait, there are so many other instruments!

996
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,700
Yeah, here.

997
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,000
Wait, play the piano!

998
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,680
Let's start a band!

999
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,680
We should start a band.

1000
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,600
Oh my god.

1001
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,760
We should start a band.

1002
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,660
I think we sound great!

1003
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,780
Oh my god, we sound so good together.

1004
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,700
This barely a song.

1005
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,880
Wait, how much?

1006
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,100
He gave me $33!

1007
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,180
$33!

1008
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,400
Wait, did they build all of this?

1009
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,580
Or was this castle here already?

1010
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,560
Castle is...

1011
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,360
They built a castle for everyone.

1012
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,800
Oh, wait.

1013
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,100
So it was already here.

1014
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,080
Like...

1015
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,360
So then they just took over the castle.

1016
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,280
Oh, because it's a kingdom!

1017
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,100
Yeah, if you look over here...

1018
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,900
So Foolish is the king.

1019
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,400
And Tina is the princess.

1020
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,740
And so is Mi-young.

1021
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,080
Mi-young is the princess.

1022
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,960
Mi-young is also a princess.

1023
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,520
Okay, what are you in the castle hierarchy?

1024
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,940
Oh, I'm the god.

1025
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,020
You're the god?

1026
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,420
Look at me!

1027
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,960
Do I not look like a god?

1028
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,880
I mean, you were like naked for half of it, so...

1029
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,760
Well, that's because my chicken can't fit in the car.

1030
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,480
A god would make it fit.

1031
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,420
Okay.

1032
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,420
Wait, wait, then I'm your...

1033
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,340
Wait, then what am I?

1034
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,860
Because I'm your friend!

1035
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Slash trophy winner!

1036
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,500
Oh, yeah, you're this...

1037
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,440
You're this homeless dude I picked up off the road.

1038
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:02,740
What?

1039
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,600
Wait, what's this button do?

1040
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,460
That makes you join the kingdom, I think.

1041
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,200
Oh, okay.

1042
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,920
Wait, are you part of the rusty bones kingdom?

1043
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,680
For now, but I think I might...

1044
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,100
Wait, why?

1045
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,300
You're not like the rusty bones?

1046
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,340
I think I need to live a nomad life.

1047
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,760
Oh, just like me!

1048
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,440
Well, you don't live it by choice.

1049
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,940
You don't know that!

1050
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,900
You don't fucking know that!

1051
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,500
I just love it!

1052
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,320
I love this life!

1053
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,660
Wait, if you leave, that means the god spot is like left open.

1054
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, it is.

1055
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,140
So there would be like, you know, like a hole to fill.

1056
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,960
And you know, you know, maybe I would take the god spot.

1057
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,340
T-Rex birth.

1058
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,480
So, I'll teach you something about the lore.

1059
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,180
Hold down G.

1060
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,100
Okay.

1061
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,860
See the amount of your map?

1062
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,440
Yeah.

1063
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,220
Right now we're on the bottom left, right?

1064
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:06,940
Yeah.

1065
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,080
This is the rusty bones.

1066
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,640
It's the friendly kingdom that lets you build your own little house outside.

1067
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,580
Uh-huh.

1068
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,680
And you can live as a community.

1069
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,160
All the way on the right, on the bottom right corner, It's T-Rocket!

1070
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,200
Those are the meatheads.

1071
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,160
As they call themselves.

1072
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,200
Wait, isn't that word what Mendo's team is?

1073
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,080
Yeah.

1074
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,340
That's where they don't really build houses.

1075
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,060
They only build gun bases.

1076
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,680
No!

1077
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,040
What the fuck?

1078
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,880
Yeah.

1079
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,460
Um...

1080
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,400
On the top right is the one true kingdom, OTK.

1081
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,200
Yeah.

1082
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,320
And on the top left is the underworld, which is Iron Mouse's domain.

1083
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,140
Uh-huh.

1084
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,180
Um...

1085
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,580
I'll be honest, I've not visited them and I don't want to.

1086
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,280
I'm scared.

1087
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,140
In the underworld?

1088
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,100
Why?

1089
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,940
Well, the underworld is cool.

1090
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,320
But the thing is...

1091
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,360
Um... So, I have three separate houses.

1092
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,440
I took you to one.

1093
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,320
I have one with Kenji.

1094
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,080
Yeah.

1095
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,980
And I have one with Boxbox.

1096
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,400
Uh-huh.

1097
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:09,960
Um...

1098
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,400
Kenji got shot up yesterday.

1099
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,400
In the underworld?

1100
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah.

1101
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,520
I'll play a song for your lore story.

1102
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,680
And apparently they're gonna make you work really hard.

1103
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,800
Oh, I don't like working.

1104
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,260
I just want to play my guitar.

1105
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,160
Yeah, you don't like working?

1106
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,960
This place is the right place for you.

1107
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,520
Everyone will give you stuff for free.

1108
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,260
Really?

1109
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,300
I mean, you did.

1110
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,380
But like, that guy That guy shocked me though.

1111
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,600
Okay, he was just testing it out.

1112
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,960
He gave you money, didn't he?

1113
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,520
Only after I begged!

1114
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,040
Well... He wasn't gonna give me if I didn't ask for it.

1115
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,020
Do you know it's even... Well, you have to consider that he actually gave you money.

1116
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,420
No people would do that in this server.

1117
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:50,960
You don't understand.

1118
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,640
Oh, really?

1119
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,320
Really?

1120
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,460
Not... Yeah.

1121
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,120
That's so fucked up.

1122
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,620
Oh yeah, what's an erper?

1123
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,680
People were asking me if I was an erper.

1124
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,460
What's an erper?

1125
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,560
How do you spell that?

1126
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,260
I don't know.

1127
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,500
They're like, are you an erper?

1128
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,340
And I was like, I just got here.

1129
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,740
Are you talking about ERP-er?

1130
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,020
Wait, did he... Oh, was it cause I was naked?

1131
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,620
Yeah, no.

1132
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,440
Um, there's people who ERP on this server.

1133
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,060
What?

1134
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,900
Yeah.

1135
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,420
Oh my god.

1136
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,320
Wait, really?

1137
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,660
Yeah.

1138
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,540
Oh, it's because I was naked on a horse.

1139
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,860
Oh no.

1140
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,500
I just wanted help.

1141
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,920
I didn't want an erotic roleplay.

1142
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,160
I just wanted help.

1143
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Don't look at him.

1144
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,940
He's... he's...

1145
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,460
He's just passing the torture room.

1146
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,540
Wait, wait.

1147
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:53,860
Oh.

1148
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,120
Don't look at him.

1149
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,820
Don't look over there.

1150
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,940
I thought you said these people are...

1151
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,080
What is wrong?

1152
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,260
Good morning.

1153
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,020
Oh, that scared me.

1154
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,600
Oh, wait.

1155
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,260
Is that a taxi?

1156
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,780
Is that a taxi?

1157
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,540
Yeah.

1158
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,280
What else is there?

1159
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,000
Come here.

1160
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,720
Who me?

1161
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,220
Can you pay for my taxi service?

1162
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,340
I need to show you someone.

1163
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,280
Come here!

1164
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,440
Hi, Noah.

1165
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,200
This is my friend named Doki.

1166
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,240
She just joined today.

1167
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,380
I'm trying to convince her to join this kingdom because it's the safest one.

1168
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,880
Well, yeah.

1169
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,280
It's definitely the safest one.

1170
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,540
Oh, wow.

1171
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,340
Kumi gave me a guitar.

1172
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,620
Now I'm here busking for scraps.

1173
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:33,700
Bye-bye.

1174
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
Oh, scraps.

1175
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1176
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,240
Each note is like one scrap.

1177
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,540
And you're willingly listening to it.

1178
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,120
Oh, thank you, sir!

1179
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,040
Wait.

1180
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm enjoying.

1181
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,320
Oh, you're back!

1182
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,480
Please, I'm so poor.

1183
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:52,760
Kumi, please.

1184
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,920
Do I have to buy it somewhere?

1185
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,700
I'm so poor.

1186
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,180
Pick it up off the floor.

1187
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,460
That's fucked up.

1188
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,180
Do you want another one?

1189
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,900
Yes, yes.

1190
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,760
Pick it up off the floor.

1191
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,240
That's so fucked up.

1192
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,040
You gave me what?

1193
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,260
How much did Foolish give you?

1194
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,500
What the fuck?

1195
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,580
Pick it up off the floor.

1196
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,240
Alright.

1197
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:19,880
You want more?

1198
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,020
Yeah.

1199
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,660
Yes, I do.

1200
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,400
I don't have a gambling problem because I never started it.

1201
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,160
Wait, can you take me to the casino?

1202
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,040
Oh, I gambled.

1203
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,400
Wait.

1204
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,320
Wait, do you know where the casino is?

1205
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,480
That's cool.

1206
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,480
No, I don't.

1207
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,980
Uh, yeah, but...

1208
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,920
Everyone knows where the casino is, Doki.

1209
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,880
Not me.

1210
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,900
Not me.

1211
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,640
I don't know if I can really head there because...

1212
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,340
I have a thing I gotta do.

1213
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,300
Yeah, wait.

1214
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,700
Where is it?

1215
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,200
People are gonna be waiting on me.

1216
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,160
So, the casino is at the very tippy top of the map in the safe zone.

1217
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:55,820
Oh!

1218
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,480
That's where you were earlier.

1219
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,780
Where P2 was?

1220
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,760
Yeah, it was up there.

1221
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,480
The most away it could be.

1222
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,840
Oh my god.

1223
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,840
It's that far?

1224
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,540
I thought there were multiple casinos.

1225
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,640
There's... I know like another one...

1226
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,720
somewhere.

1227
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,540
Where...

1228
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,440
It's also in the north.

1229
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,640
What the fuck?

1230
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,340
Why are they all in one area?

1231
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,860
Uh, I want to see a man named Trousy.

1232
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,180
Oh.

1233
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,260
Alright, where are we going next?

1234
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,720
Where are we going next?

1235
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:28,720
Which way?

1236
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,180
Do you want free stuff?

1237
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,720
Yes.

1238
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,580
Okay.

1239
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,900
There's people on the other side.

1240
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,300
Doki wants to join the kingdom.

1241
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,500
She's already a can.

1242
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,300
You said that if you want to join the kingdom, you surely can.

1243
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,640
Oh, oh, okay.

1244
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,640
Okay, so you're...

1245
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,380
Noah, do you like how I look?

1246
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,780
Um...

1247
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,960
Is that like a...

1248
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,060
Oh, wow, thank you.

1249
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,420
Thank you.

1250
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,320
Oh, you're repairing.

1251
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,440
I was like, why are you shitting his car?

1252
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,260
I feel so unsafe right now.

1253
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,460
Um...

1254
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,300
Actually, I haven't seen that hat yet.

1255
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,960
That's a fun one.

1256
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,080
How did you get it?

1257
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,980
How did you get that?

1258
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,400
You have to be there.

1259
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,160
You have to be there.

1260
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,180
I have to be there.

1261
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,500
It's like an Easter special item.

1262
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:21,980
Oh.

1263
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,380
Bye, Noah.

1264
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,900
I love you.

1265
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,400
Bye.

1266
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,160
Thanks for the scraps.

1267
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,480
Have a good, safe trip.

1268
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,720
Oh, you're very welcome.

1269
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,000
I hope you can get a terrible gambling addiction soon.

1270
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,380
Thank you.

1271
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,120
I hope so, too.

1272
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,440
Oh.

1273
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,060
Have a look at that.

1274
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,320
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1275
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,940
All right.

1276
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,420
Wait, we can gamble here.

1277
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,360
Wait, we can gamble.

1278
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,380
It won't be the same.

1279
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,260
It won't be the same, though.

1280
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,440
Okay, you want me to take you to the casino?

1281
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:53,820
Yes!

1282
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,280
I want...

1283
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,540
Wait, no, what are the other places?

1284
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,880
Casino should be the last place.

1285
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,440
So, I can beg for other people to donate.

1286
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,540
I can teach you how to get more money.

1287
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,560
Okay, yeah.

1288
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,400
I should celebrate by gambling.

1289
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,080
There's people under us, down south, that you can probably beg for money from.

1290
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,980
These are nice people?

1291
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:15,900
Oh my god.

1293
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,820
Okay.

1294
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,320
Oh my god, let's go.

1295
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,060
It's time for the grift, yeah.

1296
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:23,960
Okay.

1297
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,240
Do your thing where you play a song and say, you have to pay up.

1298
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,860
If not, you're going to cry.

1299
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,600
You have to kill them a little.

1300
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,740
You know what?

1301
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
That sounds doable.

1302
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,020
I hear people.

1303
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,920
Alright, introduce me as a new person.

1304
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,700
Hi!

1305
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,680
Look, this is my friend.

1306
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,680
She just joined today.

1307
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,460
It's her first day ever playing Rust.

1308
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,320
Yeah, I've never been here.

1309
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,300
I've never done this before.

1310
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,680
Hello guys!

1311
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,740
Look, I got my friend to start playing today.

1312
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,140
I gave her a guitar.

1313
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1314
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,000
Do you guys like this music?

1315
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,700
I just learned it today.

1316
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,480
Love it.

1317
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,640
Yeah, it's like one note per scratch.

1318
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,260
Oh, it's going up!

1319
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,540
More notes are being played now!

1320
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,860
I hope you guys are rich!

1321
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,440
I don't think they're processing.

1322
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,720
It's too noisy.

1323
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,620
You're going to have to say, okay, that was 50 scraps.

1324
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,440
Okay, alright, that was 50 scraps.

1325
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,000
Can we ask you a question?

1326
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,900
Did you tell your friend?

1327
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,280
I guess you're paying for the group, right?

1328
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,200
Are you going to pay for the group?

1329
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,220
I only have beans.

1330
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,580
Doki, look at the Doki Dog!

1331
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,860
I'll show you what a scrap is.

1332
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,820
I do!

1333
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,720
Oh my god!

1334
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,340
Look!

1335
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,500
Oh my god!

1336
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,360
Wait, you made this?

1337
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,620
I like it!

1338
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,800
Oh, that's so cute!

1339
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,880
Guys, I got a can of beans for my payment.

1340
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,500
Thank you.

1341
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,580
Is that enough?

1342
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,360
Do you think that's enough?

1343
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,280
I might turn into two scraps.

1344
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,400
Come check out more art!

1345
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,560
Come inside!

1346
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,680
Oh!

1347
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,160
Wait, did you all draw this?

1348
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,340
Holy shit!

1349
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,740
Wait, Doki, you don't understand.

1350
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,400
It's so fucking hard to draw in this game.

1351
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,280
I know, I know!

1352
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,860
That's why I'm like, what the fuck?

1353
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,460
Holy shit!

1354
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,380
There is 500 scraps buried in this location on the map.

1355
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,480
There is 500 scraps buried in this location on the map.

1356
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,120
Wait, there is?

1357
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,980
Where is this?

1358
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,460
Oh my god, we have to go!

1359
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,580
We have to go and find it, Gumi!

1360
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,200
You don't recognize this?

1361
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,480
Oh my god!

1362
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,500
Gumi!

1363
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,160
We have to find it!

1364
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,080
That's 500 dollars!

1365
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,860
Oh wait, I'm dehydrated.

1366
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,620
Drink your water bottle, you do.

1367
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,840
You have to hold it in your hand.

1368
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,800
Okay.

1369
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,700
I'm learning.

1370
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,720
Oh my god, dog with gun!

1371
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,220
Dog with gun?

1372
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,120
Hahaha!

1373
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,760
I did this.

1374
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:10,980
Hahaha!

1375
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,800
Okay, but you said dog with gun.

1376
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,560
Hahaha!

1377
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:19,660
Okay.

1378
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,440
You said I need to find out what you did?

1379
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,840
That's really good.

1380
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,780
Wow, fox with gun!

1381
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,060
Fox with gun!

1382
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,240
Wait, how do you play?

1383
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,100
On B, and then you can smoke.

1384
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:32,800
B?

1385
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:33,640
B?

1386
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,680
Oh, okay.

1387
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,320
Oh my god, fox with gun!

1388
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,000
Oh my god, smith!

1389
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,320
What the fuck!

1390
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,160
What the fuck!

1391
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,860
The smith!

1392
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:47,900
Yeah, I like this one.

1393
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,680
This one's my favorite.

1394
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,180
What the fuck, they do actual art?

1395
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,640
Yeah, this is crazy!

1396
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,280
Gumi, that's you!

1397
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,100
That's me!

1398
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,100
That's you!

1399
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,480
Oh my god, Da Vinci!

1400
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,660
Da Vinci was in the Rust server?

1401
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,220
Da Vinci was in the Rust server?

1402
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,060
Who's Da Vinci?

1403
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,300
I knew, I knew.

1404
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,380
I knew he was alive.

1405
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,840
Oh hey, a horse.

1406
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,700
That one's a really good horse too.

1407
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,380
He's pretty much alive, yes.

1408
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,760
And still painting.

1409
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,320
Wait, you're Da Vinci?

1410
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,080
No, no, no.

1411
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,400
Da Vinci is Da Vinci.

1412
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,600
Wait, what did you do?

1413
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,960
Which one's your art?

1414
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,060
I am Monstera.

1415
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,340
These are my works.

1416
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,340
Oh my god, you did that?

1417
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,360
Oh my god, you did that?

1418
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:40,400
Oh my god, you did that?

1419
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,600
Oh my god, you know what?

1420
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,480
You're better than Da Vinci, holy shit.

1421
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,620
That shit...

1422
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,160
Honestly?

1423
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,540
No wonder Da Vinci's dead.

1424
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,480
You're so much better.

1425
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,600
He knew you were about to be born.

1426
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,340
Oh, okay.

1427
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,120
This one's my favorite.

1428
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,560
Oh my god.

1429
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,340
Oh my god, fish!

1430
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,360
Where's the gun?

1431
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,340
No gun, they're on vacation.

1432
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,420
Yeah, where's the gun?

1433
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,540
I think it could've been...

1434
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,740
9 out of 10, missing a gun, not gonna lie.

1435
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,440
The dude's just having fun.

1436
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,100
They're on vacation.

1437
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,580
Don't forget, I found a photo of you!

1438
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,580
Wait, what?

1439
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,920
I'm the rat!

1440
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,540
That's me!

1441
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,380
You're the rat?

1442
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:28,700
That's you!

1443
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,260
That's me!

1444
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,940
I found you too!

1445
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,300
You're over here at the bottom!

1446
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,880
Oh my god, that's me!

1447
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,080
That's you!

1448
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,640
That's me!

1449
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,900
You're very good.

1450
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,280
That's so amazing.

1451
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:46,860
Oh my god, dog!

1452
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,760
What gun?

1453
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,960
Oh my god, there you are, 10 out of 10.

1454
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,820
I put a helmet on the rat, guys.

1455
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,500
10 out of 10.

1456
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:53,720
Look, look.

1457
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,100
I put a helmet on the rat.

1458
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,980
Oh my god!

1459
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:00,580
Oh my god!

1460
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,120
That is ridiculous.

1461
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,720
It's you!

1462
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,920
It's us!

1463
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,820
That's us!

1464
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,480
He's ready for war.

1465
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,920
Can I get a T-Stick?

1466
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,100
I wanna add mine.

1467
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,800
Yes, yes.

1468
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,260
He's trying dogs and guns and do they take commissions?

1469
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,660
Someone in my chat, there you go.

1470
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,020
It's Monstera.

1471
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,080
It's Monstera.

1472
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,460
She keeps drawing dogs with guns.

1473
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,020
It's so good though.

1474
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:32,860
It sucks.

1475
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,420
Just try drawing in Rust as well.

1476
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,600
I can craft you a couple of canvases if you like.

1477
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,280
Oh, that would be great.

1478
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,040
Yeah.

1479
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,520
Oh my god, can I be part of this art gallery?

1480
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,720
Draw a dog with a gun.

1481
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,400
Yeah, I can auth you on this gallery.

1482
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,280
Oh my god!

1483
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,440
I can't believe it!

1484
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,440
Gumi, we can be part of this art gallery!

1485
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,640
We're gonna be famous!

1486
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,580
Just like her!

1487
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,420
My favorite art chart.

1488
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Dog with gun.

1489
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,360
I'll place a couple of canvases around.

1490
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,140
Oh, nice!

1491
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,120
Yay!

1492
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,960
See, Doki, they're so nice.

1493
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,580
They give you free stuff.

1494
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh my god, we're gonna be part of this art gallery!

1495
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,400
I'm done.

1496
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,040
Let's see.

1497
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh my god, we're gonna be part of history!

1498
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,300
It's a sunshine.

1499
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,160
Oh, I see Heavy!

1500
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:35,900
This way!

1501
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,140
I found a new person to scam!

1502
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,360
Wait, wait, wait.

1503
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,900
But they're gonna give us our canvases though!

1504
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,440
Oh, you're right!

1505
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,940
Yeah, we should get our canvases first.

1506
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,160
It's close enough, okay?

1507
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,740
It's actually green.

1508
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,900
It's like greenish yellow.

1509
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,680
No, no, it's good.

1510
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,340
It's fine.

1511
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,440
It's fine.

1512
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,260
Oh, there's a sun!

1513
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,980
Yeah, there's a sun!

1514
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,440
It's perfect.

1515
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,600
Can you put some shine onto it?

1516
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,220
A.K.A.

1517
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,980
Repaint everything I just did.

1518
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,560
We should tell them we're leaving though, right?

1519
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,980
Yeah, no, I was just parking the car closer.

1520
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,440
Oh, okay.

1521
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Parking the car!

1522
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,000
We're so civilized.

1523
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,040
I'm not gonna lie, this is really my favorite half an hour of the entire song.

1524
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,040
Wait, who's that?

1525
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,200
Hello.

1526
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,210
Hi, I'm Valerie.

1527
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:32,750
Oh!

1528
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,310
I got my friend to join.

1529
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,850
This is her first day on.

1530
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,410
Yeah, yeah, this is my first day on.

1531
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,250
That's her right there!

1532
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,610
You like the song?

1533
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,950
Yeah, I'm having a great time!

1534
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,370
She gave me a guitar.

1535
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,310
She's my favorite.

1536
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,210
Yeah?

1537
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,090
Oh, yeah!

1538
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,750
By the way, it's one scrap per note.

1539
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,090
So I hope you have the money.

1540
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,870
Oh, um, yeah.

1541
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,030
I became Beth out of nowhere.

1542
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,410
Bro, I thought you...

1543
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,450
Did he say he was gonna give you a scrap?

1544
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,250
Bro, he ran away!

1545
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,710
You said we can scam him!

1546
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,650
I thought you said he was a chump!

1547
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:10,970
I think...

1548
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,290
I think he ran out of money himself, actually.

1549
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:13,510
No!

1550
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,350
You told me he was a chump!

1551
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,430
He was a chump, Goomy!

1552
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,430
I thought he was a chump, too.

1553
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,130
Yeah.

1554
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,030
Oh my go- What the fuck happened?!

1555
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:29,430
What the- Bro, what?!

1556
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,990
What the hell happened?!

1557
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,630
What the fu- How did that- What?!

1558
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,870
We left for like five seconds!

1559
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:37,750
Oh, okay.

1560
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,090
Oh, it's back to normal.

1561
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:40,890
Oh, yay.

1562
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,450
I was like, oh my god!

1563
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,890
You did that in five seconds?!

1564
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,890
I can grow up so fast!

1565
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,670
I have some art questions.

1566
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,070
Just added a couple of details.

1567
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:01,970
If you make a painting, can you pick it up?

1568
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:02,410
She's getting art advice.

1569
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:02,770
Oh!

1570
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:08,970
Put it somewhere else, or does it- Oh my god, this is truly an artwork.

1571
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,130
RTX is so good.

1572
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:10,530
I'm so happy.

1573
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,550
I was like, bro, what the fuck?!

1574
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:16,450
We got lit for like five seconds!

1575
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:17,190
We gotta go.

1576
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,370
We got magical curses and shit.

1577
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,870
Wait, what?!

1578
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,030
I can give you a couple.

1579
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,990
I actually have them.

1580
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:25,810
Oh, thank you!

1581
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,210
I'm enjoying the art gallery.

1582
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,450
I'll get the cake here.

1583
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,350
I'll bring you to press the button.

1584
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,570
Or you can press the button in the top left once we get in the castle.

1585
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:35,890
Wait, what?

1586
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:37,710
Oh!

1587
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,310
Woah, a bar?!

1588
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,450
Wait, a bar?!

1589
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,530
Oh shit, is there people there?!

1590
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,450
Move!

1591
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,090
Oh my god!

1592
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,490
I'm open.

1593
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:50,570
Oh!

1594
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,410
Oh, they're just photos.

1595
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:55,010
They're just photos!

1596
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:55,890
Yeah.

1597
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,210
Oh my god, there's a furry in the server.

1598
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,590
Look.

1599
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,110
Look at that.

1600
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,010
Who are these guys?

1601
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,830
Oh, I can make you one of those.

1602
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,070
Who are these guys though?

1603
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,710
Wait, who are they?

1604
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,810
I don't know them by name.

1605
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:12,950
Who are they?

1606
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,970
You don't know everybody in the server?

1607
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,050
Dude, you and I look exactly the same once I take this hat off.

1608
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,030
No, but he has a wolf head on.

1609
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:22,930
So they must be special.

1610
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,830
I can make you one of those if you want them.

1611
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,110
I want a wolf head?

1612
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,890
They'll think I'm wild.

1613
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,990
You gotta go home then.

1614
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:30,910
Yeah!

1615
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,810
Okay, nice.

1616
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,010
You like the way I open that door?

1617
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:35,850
Yeah, I like you.

1618
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:36,270
Watch this.

1619
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,430
AHHHHH!

1620
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,450
You're so strong.

1621
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,010
I'm so strong.

1622
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:41,530
I know, right?

1623
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,210
Look at that.

1624
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,350
All those guitar playing has like, buffed me up.

1625
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:45,950
Oh.

1626
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:46,490
Yeah.

1627
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,910
Over to our right is the swimming pool.

1628
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,370
We have pool parties there.

1629
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,170
Oh my god, I wanna check out the swimming pool.

1630
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,830
Oh my god.

1631
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,850
Look, you can...

1632
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,590
Wait.

1633
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,390
You can drive this shit around too.

1634
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,110
Wait, there's a naked guy here.

1635
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:07,550
Who the fuck is this guy?

1636
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:09,610
He's sleeping.

1637
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,990
Can you like, accidentally kill him?

1638
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,010
Yeah, but people don't do that in this kingdom.

1639
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,190
Maybe in the other kingdoms.

1640
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,110
But will they know if you kill them?

1641
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,770
Yeah, it says it on them.

1642
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,850
It says you were killed by blank with blank.

1643
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:25,790
It says you were killed by blank with blank.

1644
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,690
Guess it's just a nice relaxing day.

1645
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:32,630
Oh my god, how do you...

1646
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:33,470
Bump.

1647
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,830
Yay!

1648
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,450
Oh my god, this is the good life.

1649
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,670
Being taken care of by Gumi.

1650
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:45,910
I got a guitar.

1651
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,210
I'm begging for scraps.

1652
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,690
The good life.

1653
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,470
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1654
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,670
I'm running out of food.

1655
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,490
I'm ready.

1656
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,480
While rust is more peaceful than rumber...

1657
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,760
This is the good king...

1658
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,840
Guys, this is the chill kingdom right now.

1659
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,900
We're not in the...

1660
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,780
Literally the first minute of being in the server...

1661
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,700
I got ran over by S-fan.

1662
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,380
Like...

1663
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,580
While I was on a horse, guys.

1664
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,440
And shot at.

1665
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,680
And shot at too.

1666
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,580
We got shot at while we were driving here.

1667
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,680
We're just in a kingdom that's like, peaceful.

1668
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,020
I'm telling you, it's a gated community.

1669
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,840
It is a gated community.

1670
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,800
Guys, we're literally...

1671
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,220
We're literally in a gated community, guys.

1672
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:41,480
Like...

1673
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,240
Okay, right after this, I'm gonna take you...

1674
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah?

1675
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,860
To learn how to get money.

1676
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:51,920
Oh, cool.

1677
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,380
Easily and fast.

1678
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,140
Wait, does acquire work?

1679
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,660
A tiny bit.

1680
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,060
Oh, just a tiny bit?

1681
01:00:59,160 --> 01:00:59,660
I like that.

1682
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,640
I like those odds.

1683
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,500
Hello...

1684
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,340
Hello...

1685
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,660
Oh, I'm gonna be in the house.

1686
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,640
I hope Abe's not around.

1687
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,420
Yay!

1688
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,820
I get to be in the house!

1689
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,600
Here, you can watch that...

1690
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,620
Make sure it doesn't burn.

1691
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,220
Okay.

1692
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,000
How do I know if it's not burning?

1693
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:27,540
I'll make you your wolf head.

1694
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,020
You'll just know.

1695
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,620
How do I know?

1696
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,780
Oh, I might look at it.

1697
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,040
Okay.

1698
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,300
Which one is the...

1699
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,140
Oh, here you go.

1700
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,100
Oh, got some...

1701
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:39,740
Careful, there's gunshots outside.

1702
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,320
It's okay, we're safe inside.

1703
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,420
Alright, I made it for you.

1704
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,400
Yay!

1705
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,560
Oh my god, is there tiger heads too?

1706
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:50,940
No.

1707
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,180
There's no tigers here.

1708
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,620
There's no tigers in Rust?

1709
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,100
Put it on.

1710
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,660
Oh my god.

1711
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,520
How do I put this on?

1712
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,520
Oh!

1713
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,740
Now I definitely look wild.

1714
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,320
Now I look like a hermit.

1715
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:07,980
A hermit for real.

1716
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,300
Busting for scraps.

1717
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,140
Oh hey, that is your art.

1718
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:13,900
Did you draw that?

1719
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,020
No, my friend drew me that.

1720
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,140
That's so cute.

1721
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:18,780
Yup.

1722
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,960
Alright, I got some meat.

1723
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:23,680
Oh, I should eat.

1724
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:26,840
Yeah.

1725
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,080
Oh, there it is.

1726
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,620
I keep forgetting how to press the button.

1727
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,420
There you go.

1728
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,260
I'm full now.

1729
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,720
Oh, I think I need more water.

1730
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,600
I ran out.

1731
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,420
I have a water tank outside.

1732
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,240
Okay.

1733
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,780
Which one of you pickle muncher stole goomy scrap from the hot box?

1734
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,300
Oh yeah.

1735
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,140
Fucking Abe stole my scrap.

1736
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:50,940
What?

1737
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,020
But he's the admin.

1738
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,360
He can literally spawn scrap.

1739
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,900
He just...

1740
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,460
Here, this is the water tank.

1741
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,380
Press E on it.

1742
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,620
Where is it?

1743
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,060
Outside.

1744
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:02,480
Oh.

1745
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,260
Oh.

1746
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,160
Can I fill it up?

1747
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,480
Oh, take.

1748
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,120
Oh, I see.

1749
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,880
How much... what's the maximum I can take?

1750
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,500
250, I think.

1751
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,440
Oh, okay.

1752
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,100
Let's drink some now then.

1753
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,800
Let's fill it up.

1754
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:20,780
You know what?

1755
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,560
I'll make you a sleeping bag or two.

1756
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,580
Yay!

1757
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,840
Can I sleep outside your house?

1758
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:26,980
Yeah.

1759
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,480
Oh my god.

1760
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,180
Guys.

1761
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,840
I'll let you even sleep in my garage.

1762
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,300
Oh my god.

1763
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:32,980
Guys.

1764
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,660
I'm not mooching off of goomy, guys.

1765
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,020
Well...

1766
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,300
Oh my god.

1767
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,200
I get to sleep.

1768
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,640
I'm not squatting, guys.

1769
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,920
She's just helping a friend in need.

1770
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,520
I'm that friend.

1771
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,940
No longer...

1772
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,240
Guys, I'm no longer homeless.

1773
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,900
I gotta sleep in goomy's garage.

1774
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,720
Where the hell is my car?

1775
01:03:59,180 --> 01:03:59,900
Put it on the other side.

1776
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,380
I wanna be careful.

1777
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,580
It gets really darn dark out here.

1778
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:05,300
I wanna be careful.

1779
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:05,300
It gets really darn dark out here.

1780
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,340
What happens when it's dark?

1781
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,360
Oh, it's impossible to see shit.

1782
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,220
Oh, okay.

1783
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,860
I was like, is there anything I should be worried about?

1784
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,720
Guys, I can't believe it.

1785
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,000
Wait, what the fuck is on fire?

1786
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,720
Yeah, that's one of the cars that I could fix up.

1787
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,240
Oh.

1788
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,800
So it's like the spawn rate and stuff.

1789
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:35,050
I'm getting on.

1790
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,300
You really enjoy my music?

1791
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:43,660
Yeah.

1792
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,100
I call this...

1793
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,140
Scraps.

1794
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,680
For hire.

1795
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,040
Alright.

1796
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,560
Yay.

1797
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,700
Can I please...

1798
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,080
I'm gonna put your sleeping bag at the very tippy top.

1799
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:03,540
Okay.

1800
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,780
On top of the house?

1801
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,240
Wait, it's not even gonna be inside?

1802
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,540
Girl, if it's inside and I'm not on to let you out, you might get...

1803
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:12,740
Oh.

1804
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,340
What happened to me?

1805
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,560
I don't know.

1806
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,920
What was that sound?

1807
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,980
If I'm not here to let you out...

1808
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,240
Yeah, but you can just tell me the code.

1809
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,380
I don't think I can do that.

1810
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:26,920
Why not?

1811
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,840
You don't trust me?

1812
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,180
You know, after everything we've been through...

1813
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,640
You just give me...

1814
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,360
But it's...

1815
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,220
It's not like I can trust you.

1816
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,300
It's so cold outside.

1817
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,100
It's so cold and...

1818
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,360
And like, what if...

1819
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,000
What if they get me?

1820
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,060
What if the bandits get me?

1821
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,280
What, you're gonna sleep outside with me?

1822
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,080
What are you doing?

1823
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,720
I'm giving you the bag.

1824
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:56,460
I can...

1825
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,500
I can just spawn you anywhere.

1826
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,100
Oh.

1827
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,260
Yay!

1828
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,340
I'm giving you multiple respawn points.

1829
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:02,720
Oh!

1830
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:04,960
Yay.

1831
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,200
Yay!

1832
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,020
Give to friend...

1833
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:12,820
Don't...

1834
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:14,840
Okay.

1835
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,320
You have multiple respawn points now.

1836
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,360
Yay!

1837
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,080
Is that too bad?

1838
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,580
Yeah.

1839
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,460
I mean, I get to see the stars too.

1840
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,280
Yeah.

1841
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,120
And you live in a...

1842
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,580
Pretty much safer area.

1843
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,020
Yeah!

1844
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,340
I feel so safe.

1845
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,020
We should head to Team Rocket's area.

1846
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,220
I've been told...

1847
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,160
I've been told that there's turns outside.

1848
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:39,680
Oh.

1849
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,040
Like, they shoot you upon rolling up.

1850
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:43,640
What?

1851
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,660
But like, what if I'm naked?

1852
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,320
No, like it doesn't matter if you're not on the list.

1853
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:50,940
Oh.

1854
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,960
If I'm not on the list?

1855
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,240
What's it called?

1856
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,120
You have to be on their TC list.

1857
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,460
Their automatic list.

1858
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,340
Or else they'll automatically shoot anyone who's not on the list.

1859
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,760
What the fuck?

1860
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:03,620
Bro!

1861
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,900
Mendo like DM'd me and was like, If you need help, I can assign a pro player to help you in Rust.

1862
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,560
Like, I'm joking!

1863
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,040
Yeah, they're...

1864
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,900
They got agents and shit.

1865
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,900
They're scary over there.

1866
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,340
Bro, they got like pro players on their team.

1867
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,020
Oh, HotNic and Chelsea are pro players too.

1868
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:24,720
Wait, really?

1869
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,320
Oh, nice.

1870
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,700
The ones we just met in Arching them?

1871
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Oh, the one that built the torture chambers?

1872
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,220
Yeah, they're the pro players.

1873
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:31,700
Oh!

1874
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,420
I played with them in Rust Rivals.

1875
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,180
You should see how crazy they go.

1876
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:37,040
Oh, jeez.

1877
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,820
I mean, they fucking built a torture chamber.

1878
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,120
So like, I already could tell how crazy they go.

1879
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,060
Yeah.

1880
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,540
Oh shit, xQc is their leader?

1881
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,760
Oh, that makes sense.

1882
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,620
He will take your scrap.

1883
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,640
Oh, no.

1884
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,240
I heard he has a gambling problem.

1885
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,760
But like, in game as well.

1886
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,320
Oh, no.

1887
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,100
That's crazy.

1888
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:00,880
That's crazy.

1889
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:00,920
That's crazy.

1890
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:04,990
Oh, man.

1891
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:06,750
Um...

1892
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,090
Yeah.

1893
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,190
I'm scared that you'll take my scrap.

1894
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,030
Alright, what should we do?

1895
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:21,350
Well, it's nighttime now, so it's a bit scary.

1896
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,330
But...

1897
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,030
Yeah?

1898
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,790
I can try.

1899
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,130
Yeah?

1900
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,450
You can try what?

1901
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:35,530
Here, maybe I'll take you in one of my safer cars.

1902
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:36,030
Okay.

1903
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:37,930
Wait, I need to use the bathroom.

1904
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:38,390
I'll be right back.

1905
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,470
Can you protect me for a sec?

1906
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,510
And entertain my chat?

1907
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,730
I'll get inside.

1908
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:41,710
Oh, okay.

1909
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:43,970
Okay.

1910
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,110
How do I get in?

1911
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,850
How do I get in?

1912
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,110
Let me back up a little.

1913
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:48,990
You better get out of the way.

1914
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:50,570
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1915
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:50,870
Okay.

1916
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:09,350
Oh, I can tell you a story again.

1917
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:10,890
Oh...

1918
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,990
You guys love when I tell you stories from my childhood.

1919
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:17,910
Um...

1920
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,190
Oh, man.

1921
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,650
Last time I told you guys to...

1922
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,610
Being on the floor rat story.

1923
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,010
What story?

1924
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,250
What story can I tell you this time?

1925
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,710
You guys know the dick sucking trees story.

1926
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,050
We can get in together.

1927
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:32,730
Um...

1928
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:49,770
Oh, you guys still know about the dick-sucking tree story?

1929
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,990
No, you guys know about it.

1930
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:54,510
Um...

1931
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,330
I can tell you about how there were people...

1932
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,310
So in my high school...

1933
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,970
Since, you know, I went to an art high school and everything...

1934
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:04,470
There were people who would have sex in the bushes.

1935
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,710
Oh, welcome back.

1936
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:09,570
She back?

1937
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:11,510
She just moved.

1938
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,470
Okay, anyways...

1939
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,050
So, because it was an art high school, we had soundproof rooms and everything.

1940
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,390
But we also had people who would like...

1941
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:24,590
Have sex in bushes or under the staircases...

1942
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,950
Or in the soundproof rooms in our high school.

1943
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:33,740
And...

1944
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,340
It was kind of freaky.

1945
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,300
Cause like, sometimes I would take naps in the soundproof rooms.

1946
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,600
Cause I would have an off period.

1947
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,080
But then I realized people would be fucking in there.

1948
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,160
So I got really uncomfortable and I stopped taking naps.

1949
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:45,660
And I was like, I'm not gonna take naps in there.

1950
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:50,480
Um...

1951
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:57,080
Well, you guys know, but there was a glory hole on the third floor girl's bathroom.

1952
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,060
That was pretty cool.

1953
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,680
That was the nicest bathroom too.

1954
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,920
Which makes sense why there would be a glory hole there.

1955
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,540
I have a photo of it.

1956
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,500
If you guys want.

1957
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:13,960
Um...

1958
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:14,920
Hmm...

1959
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:16,120
Honestly...

1960
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,680
I really wanted to go...

1961
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,220
Get breakfast.

1962
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,900
Which is one roasted sweet potato.

1963
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,080
Or one roasted yam.

1964
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,480
But Doki left me in charge of you guys.

1965
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,420
So I have to keep talking.

1966
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,200
What the fuck?

1967
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,620
Why are they saying, Doki please help us?

1968
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,200
What did you do?

1969
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,820
I told them more stories from my childhood.

1970
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,660
What?

1971
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,020
What stories did you tell them?

1972
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,020
About my high school.

1973
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,680
Oh, oh okay.

1974
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,460
I have, okay.

1975
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,660
Yeah, her high school was fucking wild.

1976
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,140
Guys.

1977
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,560
Here, do you know what?

1978
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,120
Eat this.

1979
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:53,340
Is this?

1980
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:53,800
Oh.

1981
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:55,760
Yay!

1982
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,540
Where are we going next?

1983
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,340
I'm gonna go.

1984
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,180
Do you know what?

1985
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,040
It's your turn.

1986
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,000
Except I'm not streaming.

1987
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,540
So you have to entertain your chat while I go get a yam.

1988
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,340
Okay.

1989
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,640
Alright guys.

1990
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,340
Okay guys.

1991
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,500
What did Gumi tell you guys about her high school?

1992
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,480
Because she has a lot of high school stories.

1993
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,860
Some of the stories she might have told you.

1994
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,440
I don't even know about.

1995
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:21,580
Okay.

1996
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,380
Where did I tell, 2 told, what?

1997
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,000
Oh, is it the tree?

1998
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,460
Is it the tree?

1999
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,140
Oh, yeah.

2000
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,400
That's a classic Gumi story.

2001
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,740
The tree is a classic Gumi story.

2002
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,300
Yeah.

2003
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,840
Yeah, her school is fucking wild.

2004
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,800
I went to international school because that was less wild.

2005
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,400
Like, it was so.

2006
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:51,560
Okay, so like my international school, it was like super wild.

2007
01:12:51,560 --> 01:13:03,840
We're like... I didn't learn the word fuck until maybe like eighth grade because people were like, oh my god, she said fuck.

2008
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:18,120
So like in our school, we're like, oh my god, she said... and we would look around like fuck.

2009
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,100
Good heavens!

2010
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,400
Poor Doki!

2011
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:28,700
We were very innocent people there.

2012
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,700
We were so innocent.

2013
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,580
What the fuck?

2014
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,440
She said what?

2015
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,440
Oh my god, a bad word?

2016
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,640
I'm enjoying touring the rest... I definitely don't think I could have done this by myself.

2017
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,640
The Rust server by myself, like walking around.

2018
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,920
I would have definitely died.

2019
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:54,920
Multiple times if I didn't have a tour guide and I was exploring it myself because I feel like I...

2020
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,680
What Kumi told me... people here are definitely not kind.

2021
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:09,620
People here are not nice people.

2022
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,580
So I'm glad I had a tour guide.

2023
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,000
I'm glad I like...

2024
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,900
I love asking them to give me a tour.

2025
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,820
Because I would have like not known what to do.

2026
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,060
It's Rust.

2027
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,140
Oh no!

2028
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,320
I came in late!

2029
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,360
Like that's the worst part.

2030
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,520
I came in here late.

2031
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,240
So I don't like...

2032
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,100
I'm fucking... I was naked.

2033
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:41,980
Someone thought I was an ERP-er because I was naked and on a horse.

2034
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:46,200
Things were not on my side there.

2035
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,980
And I thought like I could be that person.

2036
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,500
I was like, hey guys, I'm new.

2037
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,900
I have no money.

2038
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,820
And I'm new.

2039
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:55,580
Uh...

2040
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:58,420
Can you like, you know, treat me well?

2041
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,620
And then I got ran over by a car.

2042
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:05,520
I was like, hey guys!

2043
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,900
And then I literally got ran over by a car.

2044
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,020
While I was on my horse.

2045
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,800
It truly was insane.

2046
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,880
Oh no, my fucking torch.

2047
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,300
No!

2048
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,860
My source of light!

2049
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,740
It's okay.

2050
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,700
Is there a way to play music that's not just these chords?

2051
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:27,910
How do I play like...

2052
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:28,790
Um...

2053
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,090
Different notes on the guitar?

2054
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,110
Oh yeah, and then I stole two horses too.

2055
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:38,410
One of them died to the car.

2056
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,630
Is there a way to play different notes?

2057
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:43,350
Can you set up MIDI?

2058
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,730
What the fuck is MIDI?

2059
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:46,790
What the fuck?

2060
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:47,670
That's keyboard capture.

2061
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:48,390
What did you...

2062
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,930
What did you make me do?

2063
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:50,950
I pressed R.

2064
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:51,190
What?

2065
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,490
Oh my god!

2066
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,910
What is keyboard capture?

2067
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,070
Oh, never mind.

2068
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:56,090
I don't know.

2069
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,090
I don't know what I did.

2070
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,130
Someone said press R.

2071
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:00,010
Press um...

2072
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,430
Your keyboard...

2073
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:02,650
Number pad.

2074
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,750
Oh!

2075
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:06,350
I see.

2076
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,590
I was like thinking if there's like a way to play other music.

2077
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,090
But I don't have...

2078
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,030
I don't have like a numpad.

2079
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,670
You can rebind it right now.

2080
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:16,710
No, that's fine.

2081
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:17,630
That's way too much work.

2082
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:18,630
What the hell?

2083
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:22,650
It's okay.

2084
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,690
I know this one song is good enough.

2085
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,600
Alright, where are you gonna take me?

2086
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,360
Gumi is processing.

2087
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,860
She's eating her yam right now.

2088
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:48,680
Yeah.

2089
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,200
Um...

2090
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,940
Is it daytime yet?

2091
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:51,860
I think so.

2092
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:52,980
Yeah.

2093
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,220
Hell yeah.

2094
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:55,680
Let's go.

2095
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,540
Oh, is that the other safer car?

2096
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,460
Yeah, this is a safer car.

2097
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,780
How long did it take you to build that?

2098
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,760
Not very long.

2099
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,880
I just had to fix it up.

2100
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,180
And put new parts in.

2101
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,500
Since we're like...

2102
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,120
You know, I'm like the trophy wife.

2103
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,540
Does that mean like it's our car?

2104
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,200
Huh?

2105
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,080
This ain't no one's car but mine.

2106
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:23,960
What?

2107
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,760
I didn't sign a prenup.

2108
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,740
Hey, I'll get you your own car.

2109
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,260
I'll get my own car?

2110
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,100
Mm-hmm.

2111
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,220
Oh my god.

2112
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,700
Oh my god.

2113
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,040
I'm the trophy wife, guys.

2114
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,700
I get my own car.

2115
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,580
I'm gonna get my Gucci bag and my Louis Vuitton.

2116
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,640
With my...

2117
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,260
With my...

2118
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,380
With my sugar daddy's credit card.

2119
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,920
With my...

2120
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,440
It's all on Goomy, guys.

2121
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,960
Even Super Chats, guys.

2122
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,580
All Super Chats are gonna be on Goomy's credit card.

2123
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:02,340
What?

2124
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,720
What the hell is an Octa Super?

2125
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,720
Oh, darling.

2126
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,200
That's just like one dollar.

2127
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,800
You can sit in the back too if you want.

2128
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,720
There's beds in the back.

2129
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,140
How do I sit in the back?

2130
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:17,940
Just lift.

2131
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:18,840
Get out.

2132
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:19,680
And then...

2133
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,500
It says Kiko.

2134
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,340
It says Kiko.

2135
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:24,700
It says Kiko.

2136
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:25,800
Oh.

2137
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:25,820
Here.

2138
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,120
Oh!

2139
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:28,880
Oh my god!

2140
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,220
I feel so safe.

2141
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,200
I feel so safe.

2142
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,580
Yeah, there's actually one of the safer cars.

2143
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,460
Oh my god.

2144
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,380
Wait, I can open stuff?

2145
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,480
Why am I open?

2146
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,220
What is this?

2147
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,360
Oh, like a barbecue.

2148
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,660
Oh my god.

2149
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,560
We can barbecue back here?

2150
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,620
That's so comfy.

2151
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:49,020
Yeah.

2152
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,100
I'm gonna get some car parts real quick.

2153
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:50,440
Okay.

2154
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,120
Oh my god.

2155
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,660
Guys, I'm living it.

2156
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,120
Road trip.

2157
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:55,500
Woo!

2158
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,460
Wait, where are we heading to?

2159
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:01,830
Oh my god!

2160
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,370
Goomy, they're using your credit card right now.

2161
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,530
Man, thank you for using Goomy's credit card.

2162
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:09,630
Free Supas?

2163
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:10,030
Yeah!

2164
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,570
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2165
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:11,930
Thank you.

2166
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:12,250
Thank you.

2167
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,690
Wait, why did I get a text from my bank?

2168
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:15,770
Don't worry about it.

2169
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:16,790
What?

2170
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:19,350
What?

2171
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,210
Nothing.

2172
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,250
I just heard some gunshots.

2173
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:24,370
Oh, that's alright.

2174
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:25,090
We're safe here.

2175
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,230
They wouldn't shoot this car.

2176
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:28,710
I have a gun too.

2177
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:29,510
I can aim.

2178
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,270
Well, Mendo and them might.

2179
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,030
Oh, wait.

2180
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:31,910
No, they won't.

2181
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:32,650
They won't.

2182
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:34,090
I'll be like, don't shoot us.

2183
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,410
It's Doki and Goomy.

2184
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:38,070
You wouldn't shoot us, right?

2185
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,510
We came from Overwatch.

2186
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:42,070
Yeah, they just have to hear you first.

2187
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,750
If I yell loud enough, they'll hear me.

2188
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:51,880
Don't worry.

2189
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,120
Wood can stop gunshots.

2190
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,140
I learned that in science.

2191
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:55,740
Alright.

2192
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,140
So here, I'm going to show you something real quick.

2193
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:58,780
Get out of the car.

2194
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:00,460
Yeah?

2195
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:00,640
Yeah.

2196
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:04,920
So right here, you know that mace I gave you?

2197
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:05,440
Yeah?

2198
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,320
Hit the barrel with the mace.

2199
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,020
Oh, okay.

2200
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:11,560
Whoa!

2201
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,040
Oh my god, that was one whole scrap.

2202
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,760
Yeah, press E in this.

2203
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,200
No, that's not it.

2204
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,400
The box is you have to press E on.

2205
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,020
Okay.

2206
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,320
What about these?

2207
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:22,940
No.

2208
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,100
It's only the barrels.

2209
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:24,900
Like over here too.

2210
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,360
Wait, where are you?

2211
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:28,980
Where did you go?

2212
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:29,620
Across the street.

2213
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,100
Wait, you went across the street?

2214
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:31,460
How?

2215
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,240
Wait, where did you go?

2216
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,460
Across the other street, man.

2217
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,460
I'm very colorful.

2218
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,260
It's hard to miss.

2219
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,100
Oh, shit.

2220
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,060
Scraps.

2221
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:50,940
Mm-hmm.

2222
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,580
Mm-hmm.

2223
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,920
So, if you want to go scrap farming...

2224
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,240
Yeah?

2225
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,440
You can take a car with you and keep driving.

2226
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,160
The scrap thingies only appear on the road.

2227
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:01,800
Uh-huh.

2228
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,920
Sorry, I want to sit in the front now.

2229
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,560
Won't be here.

2230
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,340
Oh my god, thank you for the Akasufa ritual, Gumi!

2231
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,220
Thank you!

2232
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,120
Oh.

2233
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,740
They're all using your credit card!

2234
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,540
It's on her!

2235
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:22,240
Isn't she sweet, guys?

2236
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,480
Oh my god, next she's gonna give me a Louis Vuitton bag.

2237
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:34,180
Guys, this latest Louis Vuitton bag, Gucci shoes, Versace.

2238
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,700
What a pretty!

2239
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,000
Oh.

2240
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,500
Oh.

2241
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:43,820
Yay!

2242
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,240
Wait, is this part of it?

2243
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,560
Yeah, the red ones specifically only have oil in them.

2244
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,160
Oh, okay.

2245
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,280
For the cars, right?

2246
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,840
Mm-hmm.

2247
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,340
Is this a restaurant?

2248
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,800
Oh, is anybody in here?

2249
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,880
No, nobody's in here.

2250
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,540
How's anybody gonna fucking eat in this town?

2251
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,140
The restaurant's not open.

2252
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,660
You have to learn how to cook for yourself, man.

2253
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:10,780
Myself?

2254
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,140
By the way, look at the cars on the road and tell me if you want any of them.

2255
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:16,760
Oh, okay.

2256
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,080
I'll get you any new car you want.

2257
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,480
Oh my god, thanks, Trigger Daddy!

2258
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,260
Anything for you, kitten.

2259
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,840
Thanks, darling!

2260
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,720
Oh my... guys!

2261
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,200
Guys, I'm gonna get a car!

2262
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,040
I'm gonna get Ferrari, guys!

2263
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,780
Oh my god, I'm gonna get a Tesla!

2264
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,700
I want a Tesla!

2265
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,240
Watch it.

2266
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,280
We're in Oklahoma.

2267
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,520
That doesn't exist here.

2268
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,940
But I want a Tesla!

2269
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,620
What are we doing here?

2270
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,840
So, right here...

2271
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,200
Yeah?

2272
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:59,560
There's more boxes and stuff inside this supermarket and there's free food, too.

2273
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:00,060
Oh!

2274
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,420
For free?

2275
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,080
Uh-huh.

2276
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,500
If you look in the green boxes around there...

2277
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,880
The green boxes?

2278
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,320
They should be on the shelves.

2279
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,220
Oh, okay.

2280
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,100
Alright, let's see.

2281
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,560
Green boxes...

2282
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,340
I see pickles!

2283
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,180
Oh yeah, don't eat those.

2284
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:19,700
Oh.

2285
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,360
Well, you could, but there's like a...

2286
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,880
A chance that you might throw up.

2287
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,340
Oh.

2288
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,880
Wait, where are... I don't think there's any boxes here.

2289
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:31,200
Oh, here.

2290
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,720
I don't see anything.

2291
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,840
I just see like, empty...

2292
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,600
Um...

2293
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,060
I think it got looted.

2294
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:41,700
Oh.

2295
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,140
Maybe someone ate it all already.

2296
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,100
Yeah, someone else was hungry.

2297
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,320
So, the stores refresh...

2298
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,500
Every few minutes.

2299
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,240
So...

2300
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,420
Sometimes when you're going up the street and you come back...

2301
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,920
Somebody was here three minutes ago.

2302
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,540
I said every few minutes, man.

2303
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:55,820
Oh.

2304
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,320
Okay, come here.

2305
01:23:58,980 --> 01:23:59,660
Where's here?

2306
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,680
Come to the back, where the cars parked.

2307
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,120
Yeah?

2308
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:06,800
Yeah?

2309
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:08,520
Come in here.

2310
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,680
What did you get in here?

2311
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:10,640
Oh.

2312
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,960
Press E on this?

2313
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:17,420
Yeah.

2314
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,140
And the random useless objects you get, like...

2315
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,580
Stop signs that say scrap or whatever, or like...

2316
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,080
Beans?

2317
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:27,940
Yeah, beans.

2318
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,860
You can right click and put it in there.

2319
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,640
Oh, okay.

2320
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,800
Then turn on...

2321
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,320
Propane metal, tank, sheet metal.

2322
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,360
Yeah.

2323
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,520
Well, you have to put in input.

2324
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,400
Oh.

2325
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,840
Make sure you eat the beans first too.

2326
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,120
Oh, okay.

2327
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,080
And then sheet metal.

2328
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,000
Metal blade.

2329
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,880
Should I put the metal blade there too?

2330
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,340
You can, yeah.

2331
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,380
You'll get plenty of those.

2332
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,440
Turning on.

2333
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,620
How long does it take?

2334
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:00,480
Oh, there it is.

2335
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:01,960
Oh, fragments.

2336
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,160
61 metal fragments?

2337
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,680
What do I do with the fragments?

2338
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,740
So that could be used to fix up your car.

2339
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,620
Oh!

2340
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,800
Or to craft stuff.

2341
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,360
That's a lot.

2342
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,180
What's the rope for?

2343
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,680
I could put the rope too.

2344
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,980
That's also for crafting stuff.

2345
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,620
Yeah, I'm gonna put stuff in there.

2346
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,980
So if it doesn't process with the stuff you put in there, that means it can't be...

2347
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:28,620
Okay.

2348
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,160
I got stuff.

2349
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:32,740
Here you go.

2350
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,280
Here.

2351
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,160
Oh my god, more scraps!

2352
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,060
Rich!

2353
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:39,580
Rich!

2354
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,160
Rich!

2355
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:40,560
Rich!

2356
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:40,660
Rich!

2357
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:41,480
Rich!

2358
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,180
Um...

2359
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,080
Oh, you can throw stuff.

2360
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,360
You can pick whatever is spawning in here.

2361
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,300
Where did my mace go?

2362
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,180
I actually threw it.

2363
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,800
Girl, I don't know where you threw your mace.

2364
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,900
Where did my mace...

2365
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,780
Kumi, I lost my mace!

2366
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,640
Yeah, I don't know where you threw that thing.

2367
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,320
Kumi!

2368
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,120
Oh, it's here.

2369
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:06,800
I got it.

2370
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,220
I got it.

2371
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:08,940
Yeah!

2372
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,400
Yeah!

2373
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,020
14 more scraps.

2374
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,200
Oh my god, I'm rich!

2375
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:16,880
I'm rich!

2376
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,220
There you go, kitten.

2377
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:21,560
Yeah!

2378
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:23,440
Get in.

2379
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:24,980
Of course.

2380
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,720
I feel so pampered, guys.

2381
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,540
I'm learning!

2382
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,640
Now I'm gonna take you to the casino, okay?

2383
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,940
The casino?

2384
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,420
You know the gun I gave you?

2385
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:38,860
Yeah.

2386
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:39,680
Yeah.

2387
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,340
I'm gonna take you to the casino.

2388
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:41,480
Yeah.

2389
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,220
Don't take it out when you're in the casino or in that area.

2390
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,600
Oh, because they'll shoot me?

2391
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:46,820
Uh-huh.

2392
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,040
Okay, I'm gonna put that away.

2393
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:51,060
All right.

2394
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,200
Yay!

2395
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,880
We're gonna gamble, guys!

2396
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,680
We're gonna gamble all of Kumi's money away!

2397
01:26:59,460 --> 01:26:59,940
What?

2398
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,780
And we're gonna win!

2399
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:03,460
Mm-hmm.

2400
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,100
We're gonna win money!

2401
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,920
Oh my gosh, this is a huge map.

2402
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:11,720
Yeah.

2403
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:14,940
Let's see.

2404
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:15,880
Where are we?

2405
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,080
Holy sh- hey, that's where I died.

2406
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,960
So all the way down there is team- what the fuck?

2407
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,080
What's the debris field?

2408
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:27,780
The what?

2409
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,260
The debris field on Team Rocket area.

2410
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,660
Oh, hey, they have a taxi service!

2411
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,180
Oh, yeah.

2412
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,000
A lot of places have taxi service.

2413
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:39,820
There's a lot up here.

2414
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,000
There's a lot up here, too.

2415
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:41,640
Oh my god.

2416
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,860
How much is it?

2417
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,040
Oh my god, I should have made you a telephone before we left.

2418
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,700
Oh, wait, yeah.

2419
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,460
I wanna call- I could make you a cell phone so you can call me anytime in-game.

2420
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,160
Wait!

2421
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,720
There's lots of scraps in these.

2422
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,100
Okay.

2423
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:54,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2424
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,480
Go ahead, go get him.

2425
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,640
Oh, okay.

2426
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,300
No, wait, right here.

2427
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,000
Okay.

2428
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:00,340
Okay.

2429
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,580
I'll grab the scraps.

2430
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:06,960
You're the one that's gram- gambling, man.

2431
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,420
I guess I'll lift a finger.

2432
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,540
I guess.

2433
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,100
Oh, Shay, there's a goggles!

2434
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:18,960
What's this?

2435
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,600
A spinning siren light?

2436
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,540
How do I put that?

2437
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,240
Ooh, I wanna wear- You have to put it on your house or car or whatever.

2438
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,360
Wait!

2439
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,480
Can I put it on your car?

2440
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:31,500
Go in!

2441
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,500
Go in!

2442
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:32,880
Go in!

2443
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:33,460
Go in!

2444
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,080
Get in!

2445
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:34,200
Get in!

2446
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:34,440
Get in!

2447
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:34,920
Get in!

2448
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:35,620
Get in!

2449
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,240
Get in!

2450
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:36,940
Get in!

2451
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,120
I'm scared.

2452
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,600
I'm so scared!

2453
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:48,240
That was Iron Mouser's Kingdom, and notice how we got shot at right away?

2454
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,240
Yeah!

2455
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,180
Yeah!

2456
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,500
That was- That was a little scary.

2457
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,380
No one does that around the rusty bone.

2458
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,080
The rusty- Woah, what's that over there to our left?

2459
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:08,840
You see that?

2460
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,640
Oh, the left?

2461
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:15,820
Yeah, it didn't fully spawn in yet but it was like fire and stuff.

2462
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,120
That might have been Ironmount's castle.

2463
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,900
That's her castle?

2464
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,800
Oh my god, it has fire.

2465
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,640
Wait, are the castles like custom to each land?

2466
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,400
They're all the same castle.

2467
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:34,920
Oh, I see.

2468
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,580
I wonder like...

2469
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,400
Woah.

2470
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,100
I'm surprised we haven't met anybody new.

2471
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,700
Oh hey, there's another bear.

2472
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,280
I'm surprised there's nobody new here.

2473
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,480
So this right here...

2474
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:51,860
Yeah?

2475
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,320
Is the gas station.

2476
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,640
You can also recycle stuff back in the...

2477
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,640
Oh, I see.

2478
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,820
I see.

2479
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,260
I'm getting a little thirsty.

2480
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,920
Stay hydrated everybody.

2481
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,160
Don't worry.

2482
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,660
I'll turn on the radio for us.

2483
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:14,080
If you look on the right hand side, that's the coliseum.

2484
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:15,340
Woah!

2485
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,500
What's going on in the coliseum?

2486
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,780
I don't know.

2487
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,420
Maybe we should check it out.

2488
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,340
It's on the other side.

2489
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,060
We should check it out.

2490
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:24,600
I wanna watch.

2491
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,880
Okay, go ahead.

2492
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:26,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2493
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:26,940
Let's go.

2494
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,560
I'll drop you off here.

2495
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,060
Wait, are you not coming with me?

2496
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:31,400
Gumi?

2497
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:33,440
Gumi?

2498
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:34,740
Go.

2499
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,420
I'll get back in the car if you know what's good for you.

2500
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,160
But it's a coliseum.

2501
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,020
What's the worst that could happen?

2502
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,940
They're not fighting in the coliseum.

2503
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,480
There's no guns allowed in the coliseum.

2504
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,980
So those are wild people fighting.

2505
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:46,900
Oh.

2506
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:49,880
Coliseum leaderboard.

2507
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,860
No, they're fighting in here.

2508
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:54,840
What, are they?

2509
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,400
Yeah.

2510
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,240
Yeah.

2511
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,880
There's like people fighting in here.

2512
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,520
People are dead in here too.

2513
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,520
What the fuck?

2514
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:05,760
Yeah.

2515
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,460
I'll wait for you out here.

2516
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,000
Like, why is there a dead body here?

2517
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,100
How do I like watch?

2518
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,600
Oh, is everybody watching here?

2519
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,620
There's no way you got full HP on that.

2520
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,700
I was 65.

2521
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:25,820
Okay, I'll be honest.

2522
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,100
Is your clothes over there?

2523
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:28,540
Yeah.

2524
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,860
You got clothing and stuff on you?

2525
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,280
They might shoot you.

2526
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:32,200
Oh.

2527
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:33,500
Oh, I'm dead.

2528
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,220
Sorry about that.

2529
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:37,200
Okay, let's try...

2530
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:37,980
You're gonna believe.

2531
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,960
Okay, I'm coming back.

2532
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,280
There's a bear outside!

2533
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,160
Okay.

2534
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:48,720
I'm coming.

2535
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,360
I'm coming back.

2536
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:51,900
Where are you?

2537
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,180
Where are you?

2538
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,040
I'm on the road.

2539
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:54,900
Where's my Goomy taxi?

2540
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:55,920
At the top of M5.

2541
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,400
Where's my Goomy taxi?

2542
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:00,880
You're gonna have to go to M5.

2543
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,280
Hold G now.

2544
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:03,660
M5?

2545
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:04,500
Where am I?

2546
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:05,480
Oh, oh.

2547
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,220
Oh my god, I think I see you.

2548
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,600
You're parked over there.

2549
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:16,580
I saw like, uh, Snuffy, Fluffy, uh...

2550
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,200
Uh...

2551
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,660
Guys, who was over there, guys?

2552
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,100
Chat, who did we see?

2553
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,460
I don't know if they're good players or nice players.

2554
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,560
What's that?

2555
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,920
Someone's chopping trees near us.

2556
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,180
Wait, let's say hi to them.

2557
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,360
They could be nice people.

2558
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,120
Yeah...

2559
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,320
Why can't we say hi to them?

2560
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,640
Oh, Sneezy was there.

2561
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:45,820
Who the fuck is Sneezy?

2562
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,400
I feel like you're naming...

2563
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:49,980
Snow White, no...

2564
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,440
Yeah, so yeah, there you go, Snuffy, Fluffy.

2565
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,640
Yeah, there's... oh wait.

2566
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:54,900
Here we are.

2567
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,840
Oh, is this gambling time?

2568
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:57,780
Is it Gamba?

2569
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,720
Oh my god!

2570
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,140
Which one's the best casino to Gamba?

2571
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,340
Wait, it's the...

2572
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,280
It's over here.

2573
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,120
Where are you?

2574
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,900
That's Chris... or is it over here?

2575
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:12,500
Hi Chris!

2576
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,460
Hello!

2577
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,440
Hi Gumi.

2578
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,260
Hi!

2579
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,220
Okay.

2580
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,700
What's the best place to gamble?

2581
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,520
Right here...

2582
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,680
You can bet on a wheel by sitting on the couch and sitting...

2583
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,760
No, this is the Gamba wheel.

2584
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,060
...and there's a machine on the side.

2585
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:28,560
Oh!

2586
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:29,660
Hello?

2587
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,300
Wait, come over here.

2588
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:31,540
Wait, where are you?

2589
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:31,680
Yeah?

2590
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,640
There's also slots here.

2591
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,260
Oh!

2592
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,160
Okay, what does it hit so far?

2593
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,320
There's also blackjack.

2594
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:38,520
Blackjack?

2595
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,100
Um...

2596
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:39,980
Poker.

2597
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,200
Wait, let's play poker.

2598
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,620
Girl, I gave you all my scraps so you can gamble.

2599
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,840
Wait, I can give you one.

2600
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:46,360
I'm going to Miami.

2601
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,580
I don't want it.

2602
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:47,760
You ready?

2603
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,020
Go.

2604
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,480
Here, sit here.

2605
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:50,340
Okay, okay.

2606
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:50,780
Is it on the couch?

2607
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,200
Okay.

2608
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:52,680
Oh, dude.

2609
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,600
If this hits, we're going to Miami.

2610
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,100
You see that machine on your left?

2611
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:55,220
Yeah.

2612
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:55,720
It's open.

2613
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,380
Virgin margarita.

2614
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:56,680
Strawberry.

2615
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,400
You can put scraps...

2616
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,760
You can split them up, by the way.

2617
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:00,860
How do I split them up?

2618
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,840
Click it in your inventory.

2619
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:07,020
And then on the top, it'll have this little bar you can drag around to split it.

2620
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,080
And then you grab it from the box.

2621
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:08,960
Oh!

2622
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,080
I almost...

2623
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,920
I almost grabbed a lot.

2624
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,500
Wait, how the fuck?

2625
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,060
Wait, how do I split it?

2626
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,340
Oh, I got it!

2627
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,400
Okay.

2628
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:25,560
I put 30...

2629
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,660
I put 3 in yellow.

2630
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:28,920
Nice.

2631
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,980
And then you watch the wheel to see what it lands on.

2632
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,340
Oh, yo.

2633
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,360
All right.

2634
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,100
It better land on...

2635
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,580
It should land on yellow, right?

2636
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,140
It landed on blue.

2637
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:41,760
No!

2638
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:42,900
It's okay.

2639
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:44,060
I only gambled 3.

2640
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,200
I only gambled 3.

2641
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,040
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2642
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:47,720
I got this.

2643
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:48,320
Okay.

2644
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,040
Let's leave with that one.

2645
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:50,720
Okay.

2646
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:51,120
We're winners.

2647
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,280
I'll put 12 here.

2648
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,980
And then I'll put 10 on red.

2649
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,500
I'm ready.

2650
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,520
Wait, we should sit in the center.

2651
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,320
Sit in the center.

2652
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,420
All right.

2653
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,960
Wait, wait, that's my money.

2654
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:05,480
Wait.

2655
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,400
Wait.

2656
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,160
Does the money not come with me?

2657
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,360
No.

2658
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:12,220
Wait!

2659
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:13,880
Okay.

2660
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:17,800
It's okay.

2661
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,380
I only put a little bit.

2662
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:20,980
All right.

2663
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:21,980
Okay.

2664
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,260
Blue and then red.

2665
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:24,960
Okay.

2666
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,700
I can't believe it.

2667
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:30,100
I got robbed before I even gambled.

2668
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,200
You better learn.

2669
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:33,120
You better learn fast.

2670
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,280
I'm learning.

2671
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:38,720
All right.

2672
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:40,140
Big money.

2673
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:40,840
Big money.

2674
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:41,960
Come on.

2675
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:42,840
Big money.

2676
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,520
Big money.

2677
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,400
No!

2678
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:53,340
No!

2679
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:58,070
I won.

2680
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:58,150
I won.

2681
01:35:58,150 --> 01:35:58,230
I won.

2682
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:58,630
I won.

2683
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:00,030
Did you lose all your money?

2684
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:04,250
She stole my money and then I lost all my money.

2685
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,210
I gave her.

2686
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:07,050
I gave you all that money.

2687
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:07,890
No, that's not true.

2688
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:08,190
Let's get this straight.

2689
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:10,290
I've scavenged some of them in the road.

2690
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,550
You scavenged 10, man.

2691
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:14,170
You scavenged 10, you know.

2692
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:15,010
I played music for scrap.

2693
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:17,590
I worked so hard for it.

2694
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,990
I learned how to play the guitar for that scrap.

2695
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:23,670
All right.

2696
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:24,210
Pick it up.

2697
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,010
It's on the floor.

2698
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:26,690
It's on the floor.

2699
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:27,610
It's on the floor.

2700
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:27,810
It's on the floor.

2701
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:28,130
Oh, my God.

2702
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,070
Woah woah woah woah woah!

2703
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:30,610
Yay!

2704
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:33,750
Yay!

2705
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:37,110
Okay, I should win now.

2706
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,690
There's no way.

2707
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:41,730
How could I lose?

2708
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,650
Luck would be on my side.

2709
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:48,700
Come on!

2710
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,040
Come on!

2711
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:53,980
Purple!

2712
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,420
Did I put purple and blue?

2713
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,520
I don't even remember what I put.

2714
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,620
Purple and blue!

2715
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,780
Come on!

2716
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,500
You won?

2717
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:08,620
You won money?

2718
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:11,980
Okay, look.

2719
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:13,520
This is it.

2720
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:14,660
I would hit it big.

2721
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,680
The moment it hits purple or blue...

2722
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:19,600
It's over.

2723
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,460
The moment it hits purple or blue, I win everything back.

2724
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:30,180
I can't hit yellows like three times in a row.

2725
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,860
There's no way.

2726
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,240
Look at the wheel and look at the probability.

2727
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:36,000
Yeah, but like...

2728
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:38,200
It can't always hit yellow.

2729
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:39,660
That's true.

2730
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:41,740
It can't always hit yellow.

2731
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,100
There's no way.

2732
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,780
That's why I didn't bet on yellow this time.

2733
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,640
Wait.

2734
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,200
But you won money.

2735
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,480
Oh, this time.

2736
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:50,960
No.

2737
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:51,840
Come on.

2738
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,500
Purple, blue!

2739
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:54,980
Purple, blue!

2740
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:00,590
Purple, blue!

2741
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:04,830
I got it.

2742
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:04,970
Oh, this.

2743
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:05,910
Oh, yes!

2744
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,430
I did it!

2745
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:08,250
Wow.

2746
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,720
Wait how much did I win?

2747
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,640
I won 54?

2748
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,240
I almost won back everything.

2749
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,100
I almost won back everything.

2750
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,200
Nine.

2751
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,760
Oh my God.

2752
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,840
Oh my God.

2753
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,840
So, this is how gambling edition starts.

2754
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:24,880
Yeah.

2755
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:26,800
I feel just like XQC.

2756
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,780
Let's see.

2757
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,520
Let's see.

2758
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:31,760
Let's see.

2759
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,640
It has to be purple now.

2760
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:36,240
And then I'll put like one...

2761
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,720
I'll put two on red just in case.

2762
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:40,740
Oh my god.

2763
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,860
Wait, why don't you gamble more?

2764
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,140
I am gambling.

2765
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:46,500
I know, but like...

2766
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,260
Why don't you just spend your days here instead?

2767
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:54,870
Yeah, you never lose unless you keep going.

2768
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:55,910
If you always keep going.

2769
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:59,030
You never lose if...

2770
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:02,810
Does Christopher E say here the entire time?

2771
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:04,710
Because he's like rank three in gambling.

2772
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:05,690
Maybe.

2773
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:06,670
Does he live here?

2774
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:08,070
Maybe.

2775
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,430
I feel like he spends majority of his time...

2776
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:12,710
Wait.

2777
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:13,910
Did I blue?

2778
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:14,910
No, you got one again!

2779
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:15,930
Blue!

2780
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:19,230
Oh my god, 54 again.

2781
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,770
Oh my god, I am winning big money right now.

2782
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:23,830
Blue.

2783
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:30,390
Oh my god, I'm actually winning big money.

2784
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,030
I'll put one in red.

2785
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:32,790
Yeah, I'll put...

2786
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:33,730
I'll put two in red as well.

2787
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:34,770
I made money.

2788
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:36,370
I'm doing it.

2789
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:36,870
Yeah, see?

2790
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:38,710
This is great.

2791
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:40,110
I'm gonna cut up my scrap back later.

2792
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:41,090
Wait, what?

2793
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:42,990
What?

2794
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:45,970
But you're already rich.

2795
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:48,130
You're...

2796
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:49,470
You're already...

2797
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:50,350
You're the god.

2798
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:52,090
You saw the sign.

2799
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:54,030
Abe takes my money when I'm asleep.

2800
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:58,570
You're a god though, but he's an admin.

2801
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:01,130
Just ask for more money from him.

2802
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:01,770
Oh.

2803
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:02,410
Oh.

2804
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:09,570
Come on, purple, blue, purple, blue, purple, blue.

2805
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:10,810
Or red!

2806
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:13,350
Come on!

2807
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:14,910
Big money, big money!

2808
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,310
Big money!

2809
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:21,930
Play my...

2810
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:22,210
No!

2811
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:23,070
Blue?

2812
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:23,850
Yeah!

2813
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:25,070
Blue is hot!

2814
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:26,010
Yeah!

2815
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:27,710
Blue is hot now!

2816
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:29,710
Yes!

2817
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:31,290
I think Chris Berge lost all his money.

2818
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:31,870
He's leaving.

2819
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:32,950
Oh my god!

2820
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:34,370
Wait, did he lose all his money?

2821
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:35,490
Maybe.

2822
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:36,250
Maybe.

2823
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,830
Oh my god!

2824
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:38,290
I got...

2825
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:39,190
I'm like...

2826
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:39,870
I have a profit!

2827
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:41,510
I actually have a profit!

2828
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:44,070
I can never lose.

2829
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,560
Guys, I actually can never lose, guys.

2830
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:52,760
Holy shit.

2831
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,580
I put more in.

2832
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:55,480
I think my...

2833
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,760
I think playing music is giving us good luck.

2834
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:00,000
I think so.

2835
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,640
Blue is insane though.

2836
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:02,080
Blue...

2837
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,600
Blue is actually big money town.

2838
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:07,080
I never lose.

2839
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,540
혼 교zi원 Wait, what are we doing after the casino?

2840
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,140
I don't know!

2841
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,380
채석 계단 Up to you.

2842
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:16,180
Ironmouse.

2843
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:16,700
Hang on, my turn to choose the correct translation.

2844
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:31,180
Who's in the OTK kingdom?

2845
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,260
Wait, red?

2846
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:32,680
Oh, no.

2847
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:34,240
No!!

2848
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:34,760
RAMAMOW!

2849
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,020
I REALLY GOT CUT OFF TO ALREADY WILLING TO RUN FOR K traditions!

2850
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:36,500
Okay, I'm done.

2851
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:37,640
I'm done.

2852
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:43,100
I'm done.

2853
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:43,540
I'm done gambling.

2854
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,640
I learned a lesson.

2855
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,020
It's time to stop.

2856
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,600
Quit while you're ahead, guys.

2857
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,180
There's like towns, right?

2858
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:04,420
In between the kingdoms?

2859
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:09,840
Okay, do you want to visit Ironmouse's kingdom?

2860
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,880
Or one of the towns that you passed by earlier?

2861
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,220
Oh, I want to visit one of the towns we passed by earlier.

2862
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,040
I want to see the locals.

2863
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,380
The savages outside the kingdoms.

2864
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:24,180
I don't know if they're on right now.

2865
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,220
Do you want that car?

2866
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,580
Remember, you have to look at cars that you want too.

2867
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:29,620
Which one?

2868
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,300
That car in the middle of the street.

2869
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,780
There's a car in the middle of the street?

2870
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,260
Oh, this one?

2871
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:36,860
It's armored.

2872
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:37,640
It's an armored car.

2873
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,160
Oh, yeah, I like that car.

2874
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:40,180
Yeah, it's armored.

2875
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,660
I want it.

2876
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,640
How do I see it in that car?

2877
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:49,900
Okay.

2878
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,200
Oh my god.

2879
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:54,460
Oh my god, she's fixing it.

2880
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,660
How do I see out of it?

2881
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,040
You remember how you hit that red barrel earlier?

2882
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:04,940
Yeah.

2883
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,360
Oh, I feel it.

2884
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:08,520
Yeah.

2885
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,780
I'll put it in.

2886
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:14,820
Give me one second.

2887
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,180
I'll put this in.

2888
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:18,440
I'll teach you.

2889
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,040
So, come to the back of the car.

2890
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,180
Yeah.

2891
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,000
See this red box?

2892
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:25,940
Yeah.

2893
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,480
Put it in there.

2894
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,060
I did though.

2895
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:31,720
Okay.

2896
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,240
It wouldn't let me.

2897
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,000
Oh, I need a different fuel.

2898
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,580
Mine's like crude oil.

2899
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:39,020
Oh.

2900
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:39,720
I'll put some in.

2901
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,240
Oh, low grade fuel.

2902
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:41,940
That's called low grade.

2903
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,300
Come here.

2904
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,020
Yeah.

2905
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,400
This side.

2906
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:48,440
How do you see?

2907
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,320
How do you see?

2908
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,180
Oh, here.

2909
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:53,460
Wait.

2910
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:53,860
Give me something.

2911
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,100
Oh, shit.

2912
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:56,480
Wait.

2913
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:56,980
What?

2914
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:58,660
Here you go.

2915
01:43:59,140 --> 01:43:59,540
Okay.

2916
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,460
Maybe I chose the wrong car.

2917
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:02,760
Too late.

2918
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,200
I already used my stuff to fix it.

2919
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:04,980
That's your car now.

2920
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,900
Why did you encourage me to get this car?

2921
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:08,700
Okay.

2922
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,700
Let's go driving together.

2923
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,340
I can't even.

2924
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:11,840
Okay.

2925
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:12,860
Okay.

2926
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:13,740
Okay.

2927
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:14,500
It'll be okay.

2928
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:16,560
And those little pixels.

2929
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:19,400
I can see where they're at.

2930
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,480
Okay.

2931
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:22,520
This was a mistake.

2932
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:25,980
And here's the town.

2933
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:27,160
The local town.

2934
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,380
The local town.

2935
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:29,760
Is anybody here in the local town?

2936
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,000
No.

2937
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,080
Most people log on at night.

2938
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:32,820
Oh.

2939
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,620
It's not nighttime.

2940
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,560
It's like 2.44.

2941
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:39,220
I know.

2942
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,960
That's why I said most people log on at night.

2943
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:41,320
I know.

2944
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:41,760
Oh, wait.

2945
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,440
There's somebody here.

2946
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:44,060
Hi.

2947
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:44,860
Hello.

2948
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:46,680
Hi.

2949
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:47,960
Hey there.

2950
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:48,520
Hey, bud.

2951
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:52,000
This is her first day ever playing around.

2952
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,120
Yeah.

2953
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:52,980
It's my first day.

2954
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,460
I've been showing her around.

2955
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:56,600
Do you want to hear some music?

2956
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,800
It's not too late to change your mind.

2957
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,460
I'm busking for scraps.

2958
01:44:59,680 --> 01:44:59,940
All right.

2959
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,080
Yeah.

2960
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:00,860
Because I have a gambling addiction.

2961
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,280
Oh, you too, right?

2962
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:04,380
Yeah.

2963
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,500
Oh, thank you, sir.

2964
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:08,920
Thank you.

2965
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:09,500
That's all I got.

2966
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:09,980
I just moved on.

2967
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:10,520
Thank you, sir.

2968
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:11,300
Thank you, sir.

2969
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,400
I'm going to go get some food.

2970
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:12,660
Oh, yeah.

2971
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,480
Be careful.

2972
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:16,960
Be careful with rust because you'll end up playing like for 14 hours.

2973
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:17,620
Oh, yeah.

2974
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:17,840
No.

2975
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:21,560
Like the first five minutes I got on, I got ran over by a car.

2976
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,420
Yep.

2977
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,060
That's where it begins.

2978
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,380
Everyone gets run over once.

2979
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:28,320
Yeah.

2980
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:28,660
Wait.

2981
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,120
Can we run over somebody, Gumi?

2982
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,320
Do it.

2983
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,700
Well, I gave you your own car.

2984
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,720
You do whatever you want.

2985
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:37,180
Oh, my God.

2986
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:37,620
I can?

2987
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:41,280
Hey, by the way, since your car doesn't have a lock, you can run me over.

2988
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,120
I don't know if you can steal your car.

2989
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:43,060
Oh, shit.

2990
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,020
You got to get it over with, you know?

2991
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:45,520
Wait.

2992
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:45,880
You are...

2993
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,520
Oh, my God.

2994
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,220
A freebie?

2995
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:48,240
Okay.

2996
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,680
I hope I'm backing up correctly.

2997
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:51,280
Gumi, do it.

2998
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:53,300
Am I doing it?

2999
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,000
Where are you?

3000
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:54,640
I can't see.

3001
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,320
Did I do it?

3002
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,500
You ran over my leg.

3003
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:01,320
You ran my leg over.

3004
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:02,520
I mean, that counts.

3005
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,840
That sort of counts, right?

3006
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,160
Wait, Gumi.

3007
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:07,020
You should run him over.

3008
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:07,980
He's doing it for free.

3009
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:09,680
What the...

3010
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,660
I'm going to run him over.

3011
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:10,900
I'm going to run him over.

3012
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:10,920
I'm going to run him over.

3013
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,640
No, no.

3014
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,340
Only the first time running over.

3015
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,180
Oh, the first...

3016
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,820
Wait, but Gumi's never ran over somebody.

3017
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:16,140
Wait, Gumi.

3018
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:16,740
Ask him for...

3019
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:19,420
Ask him for a low grade because you ran out of gas.

3020
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,040
Oh!

3021
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,500
I ran out of gas, apparently.

3022
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,740
That's why I couldn't run you over.

3023
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:26,200
Oh.

3024
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:28,420
Oh.

3025
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:32,020
Do you have any low grade fuel?

3026
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:34,420
Anything.

3027
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:38,590
I left that shock over there that's not completed.

3028
01:46:38,590 --> 01:46:39,370
Wait, you're poor?

3029
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:40,570
Gumi, if you want...

3030
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:42,130
You're poor?

3031
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:42,750
What did you say?

3032
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:43,310
You want this car instead?

3033
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:44,810
Oh, wait.

3034
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:45,490
Yeah, I want that car.

3035
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:46,490
I'm going to the Canadian Embassy.

3036
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:47,390
What?

3037
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,530
How can you be poor and rust?

3038
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,890
It's been four days.

3039
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:54,570
I just got in yesterday.

3040
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:55,890
Wait, you just got in...

3041
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:56,190
Oh, yeah.

3042
01:46:56,230 --> 01:46:56,730
You're poor.

3043
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:58,610
You should have...

3044
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:01,290
I'm sorry, man.

3045
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:01,750
Gumi, you know what?

3046
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,650
I'm going to give you this armored car.

3047
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:04,550
Yeah?

3048
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:05,330
Whoa.

3049
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:06,690
You got gas?

3050
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:09,330
You didn't have this car because she wants this car.

3051
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:10,090
Oh, my God.

3052
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:10,310
Yeah!

3053
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:11,730
Don't keep someone shooting at us.

3054
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:12,750
No, no, no.

3055
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,110
No, they're not.

3056
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,170
Nobody's shooting at us.

3057
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:15,130
Yeah, it's here.

3058
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:16,850
Do you not hear those bullets landing near us?

3059
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:17,790
Is this going to...

3060
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:18,150
Yeah.

3061
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:19,410
Don't worry.

3062
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:20,470
Don't worry, sir.

3063
01:47:20,530 --> 01:47:23,130
Because I saw how nice you were, I'm an influencer.

3064
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:29,050
And I'm going to gift you that car just for how nice you were for letting me run you over.

3065
01:47:29,330 --> 01:47:29,350
Whoa.

3066
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:31,390
Don't keep...

3067
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:32,850
I literally gave you that car.

3068
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:35,270
No, you just get all of that.

3069
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:36,930
That's your whole car for you.

3070
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:37,470
Just there.

3071
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:38,570
We're going to leave now.

3072
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:40,050
I get 100% of it?

3073
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:41,690
Yeah, you get 100% of that.

3074
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:42,430
Oh, my God.

3075
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:47,890
You were so nice because you were like, let me run you over and I'm an influencer.

3076
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:49,830
So I decided to gift you that car.

3077
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,310
She's pretending that she fixed the car.

3078
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:55,070
But it was my gift.

3079
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:56,750
Yeah, you gift it to me.

3080
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,510
So I gift it to him.

3081
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:02,330
I'm like basically like Mr. Beast.

3082
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:12,310
Are you beating his car?

3083
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:12,410
Are you beating his car?

3084
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:18,810
The homeless doesn't give it to the next homeowner.

3085
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:21,330
I just fixed it up for her just now, man.

3086
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:23,170
She's so ungrateful.

3087
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:23,770
Yeah.

3088
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:25,630
Congratulations on your new car, sir.

3089
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:28,710
Thanks so much.

3090
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:29,630
No problem.

3091
01:48:29,950 --> 01:48:32,070
No problem.

3092
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:33,730
Tell them it was Mr. Beast.

3093
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:37,690
What the fuck?

3094
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,930
There's a red barrel.

3095
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:41,090
There's a red barrel right here.

3096
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:41,310
Oh, there's a red barrel.

3097
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:42,190
Wait, that's fueling.

3098
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:42,410
Oh, there's a red barrel.

3099
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:43,090
Okay.

3100
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:44,690
Oh shit.

3101
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:46,590
Why the fuck are you driving off when you...

3102
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,610
I just...

3103
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:51,190
Mr. Beast behind a casino.

3104
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:54,070
Oh hey, look.

3105
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:54,870
There's like fuel.

3106
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:00,370
Alright.

3107
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:01,430
Nice.

3108
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:04,550
Alright.

3109
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:05,990
Wait, there's people talking over there.

3110
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:06,970
Where?

3111
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:08,350
Where is that place?

3112
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:09,390
There's a building to our right.

3113
01:49:09,730 --> 01:49:10,150
What is that?

3114
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:10,810
Is that a tavern?

3115
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:11,650
Is that a bar?

3116
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:12,310
I don't know.

3117
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,390
I don't know.

3118
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:13,290
Oh my God.

3119
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:14,130
It's a role play house.

3120
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,670
Wait, that's a role play house?

3121
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:16,230
What does that mean?

3122
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:18,750
No, tell me about it.

3123
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,430
Tell me about it.

3124
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:21,650
Go on.

3125
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:23,550
Get up.

3126
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:25,250
Hey, how you doing?

3127
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:25,730
Come on.

3128
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:26,310
Take a seat.

3129
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:26,910
Hello.

3130
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:28,210
Hello.

3131
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,770
This is my friend.

3132
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:30,750
She joined...

3133
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:32,190
This is her first time playing at Rust.

3134
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:33,390
Yeah, this is my first day.

3135
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:34,990
Oh, no way.

3136
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:35,530
What's your name?

3137
01:49:36,230 --> 01:49:37,170
Hey, it's Doki.

3138
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:37,870
Tell us.

3139
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:38,250
Tell us.

3140
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:40,950
Tell us two fucks about yourself.

3141
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:41,250
Oh, okay.

3142
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:42,390
My name is Doki.

3143
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,510
My name is Baby Billy.

3144
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:43,870
Uncle Billy.

3145
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:44,510
Oh my God.

3146
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:45,650
Hey, Baby Billy.

3147
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:46,810
You are Baby Billy?

3148
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:48,490
Who's Baby Billy?

3149
01:49:48,930 --> 01:49:48,990
I was calling your phone yesterday.

3150
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:52,890
Oh, you was calling Uncle Baby Billy?

3151
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:58,510
Yeah, I was looking so hard for you, Baby Billy, but then your phone number disappeared.

3152
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,950
Are you off the grid, Baby Billy?

3153
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:01,970
I'm sorry.

3154
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:06,610
When you found me, I left my phone in the back of a car.

3155
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:07,670
I got a new number.

3156
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,510
Oh.

3157
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:12,170
Yeah.

3158
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:12,390
Yeah.

3159
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:12,730
Thank God.

3160
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:14,690
Well, it's nice to meet you, Uncle Baby Billy.

3161
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:17,430
Represent the church with that father down there.

3162
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:19,210
And we're happy to have you.

3163
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:21,790
We're having a little bit of a meeting if you want to sit in.

3164
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:22,770
Oh, shit.

3165
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:24,110
What kind of meeting?

3166
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:27,850
What kind of meeting is this?

3167
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:29,390
We just have a daily church meeting.

3168
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:31,530
Oh, shit.

3169
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:36,630
I love politics.

3170
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,630
I love to sit down in this meeting.

3171
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:41,590
I love politics.

3172
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:42,390
I love politics.

3173
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:45,130
This isn't a cult, right?

3174
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:48,570
No, no, no.

3175
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:49,610
This is not a cult.

3176
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,470
I'm definitely not a guy.

3177
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:51,530
Definitely not.

3178
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:53,810
I'm using a megaphone because I'm down here at the other side of the table.

3179
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:56,270
Hey, so, Billy, so...

3180
01:50:56,270 --> 01:50:57,370
I'll use mine too!

3181
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,430
Oh my god, they're so nice!

3182
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:04,470
Oh my god!

3183
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:34,430
Oh my god!

3184
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:51,550
Woo!

3185
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:58,770
Yeah, I agree.

3186
01:51:58,870 --> 01:51:59,730
Woo!

3187
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:01,530
Money!

3188
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:11,250
Listen, last night we broke even by, I think, 2,000 scrap, but the reason is because we was giving a lot of money away.

3189
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:13,350
You know, we had lines of cards.

3190
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:14,730
Aww, opening night.

3191
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:15,630
Yeah.

3192
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:18,390
Broke even?

3193
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:19,890
What do you mean broke even?

3194
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:21,150
I thought we were going to be millionaires.

3195
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:22,690
See?

3196
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:23,730
You didn't run your game.

3197
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:24,930
The concessions are not even open yet.

3198
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:27,210
The concessions are not open yet.

3199
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:29,190
What kind of meeting is this?

3200
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:30,290
Remember that?

3201
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,870
I don't know.

3202
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:34,390
I had already been in town for 13 hours by the time it came to fruition.

3203
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,570
I'm sorry.

3204
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:38,810
When money is to be made, money is to be made.

3205
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:46,350
You think that in There Will Be Blood that Daniel Day Lewis, when he found the oil, he said, Oh, I'm sorry.

3206
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,590
I'm an oil man.

3207
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:50,290
I've already been working for two hours today.

3208
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:50,950
He sounds white.

3209
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:53,310
This is my son, bastard in a basket.

3210
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,410
Now, he said, let me get that oil.

3211
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:58,150
You left the oil on the ground, son.

3212
01:53:01,410 --> 01:53:02,690
I think we're in a cut.

3213
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:05,070
I'm going to drink your milkshake.

3214
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:05,890
I don't know how to get out.

3215
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:07,370
I think we have to wait for the meetings now.

3216
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:09,130
I'm scared.

3217
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:10,970
I'm scared.

3218
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:12,670
He also fell asleep.

3219
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:14,330
And that guy was taking exploits from him.

3220
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:15,490
I have another piece of coin for you.

3221
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:17,990
He had a bowling alley in his house.

3222
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:21,290
I dare you to be sad with a bowling alley in your house.

3223
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:23,230
All right, let's move on.

3224
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:24,050
We got to get to business.

3225
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:26,730
I don't want to keep you all here too long.

3226
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:27,990
That was the business?

3227
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:33,030
We all have another party where Bobo wake up to kick off the next day to Kasana.

3228
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:33,410
Wow.

3229
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:36,590
We need some new things running.

3230
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:40,090
We got to have those concession supplies ready to go.

3231
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:42,190
This church is funded by a casino?

3232
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,970
And a rack of water in case they are parked.

3233
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:46,150
What kind of religion is this?

3234
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:49,570
We are going to try and have both the Russian roulette up.

3235
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:50,830
That's you, Father Seale.

3236
01:53:51,150 --> 01:53:55,950
And our racetrack fully operational so that people can bet on the ponies.

3237
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:57,250
You know what I'm talking about?

3238
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,450
High rollers.

3239
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:03,390
Stonewall's also been working on Operation Kaiju.

3240
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:16,810
For those of you who don't know, Operation Kaiju is a fully autonomized self-defense system that if anything goes wrong in our town, we launch up droids like it's a Pacific Rim job in this bad boy.

3241
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:21,670
And it kills anything that's moving, anything that's not moving, and anything in between.

3242
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:26,230
So that's the kind of matters of business.

3243
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:26,810
Hallelujah.

3244
01:54:27,210 --> 01:54:28,870
Yeah, from Baby Billy.

3245
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:29,890
Uncle Baby Billy?

3246
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:31,030
Does anybody else have any pressing matters?

3247
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:32,290
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

3248
01:54:32,290 --> 01:54:33,370
I have a question.

3249
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:35,410
What's a Pacific Rim job?

3250
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:45,330
Oh, that's the movie where they had mechanized units fighting Kaiju, but I combined it with a graphic sex act called Analangus.

3251
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:47,390
Where you're looking out the outside of a butthole.

3252
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:48,070
Analangus.

3253
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,670
It was for dramatic effect, you know.

3254
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:53,630
I thought that was the movie about like those mecha sharks.

3255
01:54:54,730 --> 01:54:59,930
Yeah, that's the one, but I just made it nasty so everybody pay attention.

3256
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:00,930
Little Baby Billy.

3257
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:02,070
Oh, okay.

3258
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:03,890
Okay, thank you Uncle Baby Billy.

3259
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:04,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3260
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:07,530
Any other questions or things you want to bring up?

3261
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:09,990
Hey, uh...

3262
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:10,450
No, no, how many...

3263
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:11,930
I've never watched Pacific Rim.

3264
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:12,390
In terms of betting, baby.

3265
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:13,750
Oh, sure.

3266
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:14,570
Yeah, go ahead, Greg.

3267
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,750
In terms of betting, how many horses are we going to get?

3268
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:19,650
Cabus and I are running around town.

3269
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,470
It's so hard to get them because they keep getting stolen.

3270
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:24,350
We've got about four at the moment, but they take so long to find.

3271
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:26,370
Yeah, I think... I think four is fine.

3272
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:27,230
You want at least, what, six maybe?

3273
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:27,790
I don't think...

3274
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,210
No, I think four is fine.

3275
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:30,630
Oh.

3276
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:31,730
I think you don't want to bet on a...

3277
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:36,930
We ain't going to have a show, place, and win like normal horse racing.

3278
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:39,650
I think you're just going to bet on which horse you think you're going to win.

3279
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:41,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3280
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,750
There you go.

3281
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:44,490
Hey, what religion is this, Gumi?

3282
01:55:44,690 --> 01:55:47,490
Hey, our new two people, you got anything you want to talk about?

3283
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:48,730
Hey, I'm just...

3284
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:49,870
Tell us a little something about yourself.

3285
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:52,110
I'm just a little... I'm just a little curious here.

3286
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:54,210
What... What religion is this?

3287
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,070
Religion of blood.

3288
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:58,950
That's a good question.

3289
01:55:59,030 --> 01:56:00,390
The Hall of Sun of Blood.

3290
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:00,710
Ah...

3291
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:01,530
That's not no bad question.

3292
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:04,690
So, we worship the Blood God.

3293
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:12,890
He is known by many names, Yog-Sagoth, Asriel, the Crusher of Elves.

3294
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:16,150
Anyway, he is an Eldrige being that lives in the void of space.

3295
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:16,770
There's Satanist.

3296
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:17,990
Yeah, and...

3297
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:19,470
Out loud.

3298
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,710
is his way to night.

3299
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:29,990
And we appease him by being our most untapped degenerate selves, you know, most faiths, the Buddha, and Jebus.

3300
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:38,450
Oh!

3301
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,910
Oh!

3302
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:46,930
Yeah!

3303
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:49,710
Yeah!

3304
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:50,430
Yeah!

3305
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:50,970
Yeah!

3306
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:52,110
Yeah!

3307
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:01,650
I'm gonna learn from these mistakes.

3308
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:31,490
Try to make sure you have a good time.

3309
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:32,050
Oh!

3310
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:36,090
And you guys make a lot of money?

3311
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:38,870
Yeah!

3312
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:40,890
Baby Billy the richest motherfucker!

3313
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:42,430
Oh shit!

3314
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:45,350
That's right I got friends!

3315
01:57:45,610 --> 01:57:46,050
Damn!

3316
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:49,570
I got a race horse named Baby Baby Billy!

3317
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:50,970
Baby?

3318
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:55,050
You know, I think...

3319
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:55,570
What are you trying to do?

3320
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:59,910
You just find Baby Billy if you're looking for a mission or you're looking for something to do.

3321
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,610
Or you just wanna walk around the castle.

3322
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:05,750
What the hell are you doing in there son?

3323
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:13,290
Now I had to kill that man about 50 times yesterday.

3324
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:15,490
Oh that's uh...

3325
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:16,310
Make a wish kid.

3326
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:18,870
Make a wish kid?

3327
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:21,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3328
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:23,610
His dream is to kill me but uh...

3329
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:26,090
You know some wishes ain't meant to come true.

3330
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:35,830
You know when I was young I was stricken with a little bit of a gap and when I was in Make-A-Wish I wanted to meet Michael Jordan and play him in one on one basketball but they couldn't make that happen.

3331
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:37,210
But you lived though.

3332
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:39,030
We'd give them tickets to like...

3333
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:41,930
Yeah, it wasn't a bad case of gout.

3334
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:43,090
Yes!

3335
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:48,170
I thought Make-A-Wish kids were supposed to be dying.

3336
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:49,330
I thought Make-A-Wish kids were supposed to be dying.

3337
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:51,490
It was.

3338
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:53,770
They didn't know what it was at first.

3339
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:55,410
My feet was all slowed up.

3340
01:58:55,710 --> 01:58:58,370
You know, you're only supposed to have gout that bad.

3341
01:59:01,650 --> 01:59:02,350
I see.

3342
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,150
I see.

3343
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:03,490
I see.

3344
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:08,630
Does anybody else have any other questions?

3345
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:10,930
Anything I can help anybody with?

3346
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:13,590
Any matters of business that BabyBinna should be focusing with?

3347
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:14,050
Hoss?

3348
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:14,750
Come on.

3349
01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:15,810
Stonewall?

3350
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:20,330
So for the racetrack, what else do we need other than horses?

3351
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:21,210
So for the racetrack, what else do we need other than horses?

3352
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:24,510
Oh, I think Chrissy was working on the racetrack.

3353
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:26,590
I don't know if she's gonna be working up, waking up.

3354
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:28,210
But she had a plan for it.

3355
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:29,750
I think we got a lot of resources.

3356
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:34,710
But if she tells you she needs something, you know, you gotta be Johnny on the spot and help her out.

3357
01:59:35,690 --> 01:59:36,050
Yeah.

3358
01:59:36,150 --> 01:59:39,770
For the racehorse and stuff, for the racetrack, we need a bit more stone.

3359
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:42,370
But I think Kameis and I can...

3360
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:43,450
We got it covered.

3361
01:59:43,730 --> 01:59:45,130
We need stone.

3362
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:48,590
Alright, we got jacks though.

3363
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:49,890
We got a few jacks.

3364
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:51,650
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3365
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:52,930
We can jack off.

3366
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:57,050
Alright, we gonna get them jacks a lot.

3367
01:59:57,050 --> 01:59:57,290
We're gonna be jacking off a lot.

3368
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:03,930
Hey, my two new lovely ladies at the table, is there anything that you wanted to do?

3369
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:05,450
Did you want to...

3370
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:07,630
You know, go on a mission?

3371
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:09,230
Or you want some supplies?

3372
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:11,430
Oh, yeah, we can go on a mission.

3373
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:12,750
Yeah.

3374
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:16,450
Well, I mean, did you want to maybe build a business in town?

3375
02:00:16,670 --> 02:00:17,910
We will help you with that too.

3376
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,630
If you wanted to build like a...

3377
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:21,430
I don't know, like a...

3378
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:24,490
A pet shop or...

3379
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:25,710
Can we...

3380
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:27,870
Can we have a pet shop?

3381
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:28,630
Can we?

3382
02:00:28,710 --> 02:00:30,030
Can we have a pet shop?

3383
02:00:30,510 --> 02:00:30,950
I'm...

3384
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:33,570
I'm good at farming.

3385
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:34,770
Yeah, I got a store for you.

3386
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:36,550
Oh my God.

3387
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:38,150
There are a lot of rabid wolves around.

3388
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:40,290
I love a pet shop.

3389
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:42,570
If you need somebody to take it over, you could take it over.

3390
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:44,330
It has vending machines.

3391
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:45,190
I'll show you.

3392
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:45,810
Oh, yeah.

3393
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:50,210
Yeah, we love some of that good nepotism.

3394
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:51,230
Woo.

3395
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:52,690
Oh, nepotism.

3396
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:53,750
Can I draw?

3397
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:54,070
Can you draw?

3398
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,130
Can any of you draw at all?

3399
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:56,810
Oh, yeah.

3400
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:57,650
We can draw, right?

3401
02:00:57,710 --> 02:00:59,570
Yeah, we were just at the art gallery.

3402
02:00:59,870 --> 02:01:00,610
You can draw?

3403
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:01,550
Yeah, let's talk.

3404
02:01:01,830 --> 02:01:02,590
Oh, buddy.

3405
02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:06,390
Okay, let me know if you need me.

3406
02:01:06,490 --> 02:01:07,570
I got to talk to a horse now.

3407
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:08,030
Come on.

3408
02:01:08,810 --> 02:01:10,330
We have a pet store.

3409
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:13,610
I got one more thing to tell you.

3410
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:20,410
If I were here speaking bad tongue, ill will about our God, I'm gonna gut you like a fish.

3411
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:21,510
Oh.

3412
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:23,470
We would never.

3413
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:24,730
Keep that in mind.

3414
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:27,490
Yes, sir.

3415
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:29,070
Mr. Father, sir.

3416
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:30,870
Don't step on my toes.

3417
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,250
Oh, God.

3418
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:35,650
Shredding on the boots.

3419
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:36,310
Oh, no.

3420
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:39,970
We would never do anything bad.

3421
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:42,030
Is this a pet shop?

3422
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:44,270
They're giving you a free house, Dokie.

3423
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:45,450
Oh, my God.

3424
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:46,690
They did a free house?

3425
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:49,150
But I own this building.

3426
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:50,130
Yeah?

3427
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:53,090
Minus that one door.

3428
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:54,910
But we can fix that.

3429
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:57,770
There's a lot of free loot on the floor.

3430
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:58,630
Oh, my God.

3431
02:01:58,710 --> 02:01:59,470
You can have this shop.

3432
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:04,050
It's got all this stuff.

3433
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:05,570
It's got furnaces in here.

3434
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:07,290
Boxes.

3435
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:09,910
Do you want it?

3436
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:10,570
Yeah.

3437
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:12,510
We would love to start a shop here.

3438
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:15,890
Dokie, we could live up here together.

3439
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:17,650
Wait, how did you get here?

3440
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:19,050
Wait, I can't even move here.

3441
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:20,270
Okay.

3442
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:22,150
I can't move.

3443
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:24,330
It's stuck.

3444
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:26,510
I'm gonna unlock everything and you can change the code.

3445
02:02:26,850 --> 02:02:27,630
Hey, step, bro.

3446
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,790
We're stuck, guys.

3447
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:33,190
Oh, my God.

3448
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:34,450
We made it, Gumi.

3449
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:36,610
We joined the cult.

3450
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:37,950
Made up money.

3451
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:43,100
Oh, my God.

3452
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:44,040
We can live here.

3453
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:47,080
We can make this a cute kitchen.

3454
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:50,760
And then we can work downstairs and wake up to our daily lives and work for the Blood God.

3455
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:51,100
Yeah.

3456
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:55,460
And if you need to remove any walls, just let me know and I'll blow them up.

3457
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,240
Oh, shit.

3458
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:57,540
Yeah, no problem, man.

3459
02:02:59,020 --> 02:02:59,560
Oh, my God.

3460
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:00,420
We own all this?

3461
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:02,700
Definitely, we can if you need a window or something.

3462
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,180
We own all this.

3463
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,680
We get free things.

3464
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:09,380
We get free things.

3465
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,220
Did the boxes have codes?

3466
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:11,540
Yeah.

3467
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3468
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:13,900
This one's locked.

3469
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:14,720
The one in the bottom.

3470
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:16,800
Okay, there you go.

3471
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,320
It should be open now.

3472
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:18,780
You have the codes?

3473
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:19,060
Okay.

3474
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:22,260
Yeah, that was the one with the codes.

3475
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,960
What about this door back here?

3476
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:26,440
Oh, my God.

3477
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,020
Guys, I get clothes?

3478
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:31,960
Guys, who said joining a cult is a bad idea?

3479
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:32,400
Guys, who said joining a cult is a bad idea?

3480
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,080
I literally got free water and food.

3481
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:35,460
Should we be able to change it?

3482
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,420
And fucking animal pelts?

3483
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:40,360
Okay, it's 4-3-4-3 if anyone's asking.

3484
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:41,420
3-4-3, okay.

3485
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:43,380
4-3-4-3.

3486
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:44,640
4-3-4-3.

3487
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:46,080
We made you drop everything after you changed the lock.

3488
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:48,800
Oh, my God.

3489
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,040
Gumi, we're set for life.

3490
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,840
We never have to work again.

3491
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:52,920
I'll do this one quick, Gumi.

3492
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:55,320
I'll just make it 4-3-4-3.

3493
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:58,040
Thank you.

3494
02:03:58,720 --> 02:03:59,520
Cults are cool.

3495
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:03,200
This one is already the code.

3496
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,320
Cults are so cool, Gumi.

3497
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,460
We should have joined a cult earlier.

3498
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,620
It's not a cult.

3499
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,040
It's not a cult.

3500
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:11,340
Oh, sorry.

3501
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,560
Your religion is cool.

3502
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:13,220
It's not a cult.

3503
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:14,340
Not a gang.

3504
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:15,060
Not a cult.

3505
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:15,500
Not a gang.

3506
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:16,120
Okay.

3507
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:19,520
Sorry, sorry.

3508
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:21,180
This religion is so cool.

3509
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:22,020
We should have converted earlier.

3510
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:23,460
Have you guys ever been part of a...

3511
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,700
Wait, we're going to get stoned.

3512
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:28,300
If you need any stuff, just tell me and we'll get it.

3513
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:29,380
Do we need to get baptized?

3514
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:30,880
It's dark.

3515
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:31,700
I'm kind of scared.

3516
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3517
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:35,980
Have you heard of our baptisms?

3518
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,140
Wait, baptisms?

3519
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:37,540
No.

3520
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:39,860
What's the baptism?

3521
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:42,640
What if they baptize us in blood, Doki?

3522
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:43,560
We'll get you both baptized later.

3523
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:44,320
It's a secret.

3524
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:44,760
It's a secret.

3525
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,040
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3526
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:48,660
I think they're going to drown us in blood.

3527
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,120
I think they're going to waterboard us in blood.

3528
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,540
We'll have an indoctrination of you two later, okay?

3529
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:52,640
Oh, yeah, sure.

3530
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:54,080
Does it hurt?

3531
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:56,280
But because...

3532
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:57,300
Um...

3533
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,420
Don't ask questions.

3534
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,020
Don't ask questions.

3535
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:00,940
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

3536
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,220
Because this is the type of religion where we don't ask questions.

3537
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:03,660
Unless you know...

3538
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,360
Yeah, exactly.

3539
02:05:06,620 --> 02:05:09,780
You just devote your life to the blood gods with hope and prayers.

3540
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:10,660
Okay.

3541
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,260
Of course.

3542
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:13,080
Of course, of course.

3543
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:13,900
That makes sense.

3544
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:14,440
Okay.

3545
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:18,400
You guys said you converted, though.

3546
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:19,960
Where were you from before?

3547
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:21,980
Did you come from baptism?

3548
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:23,520
Or where?

3549
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,060
There's other religions?

3550
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:27,580
I thought there was only one.

3551
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:30,520
No, I don't think we even said the word convert.

3552
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:31,260
No, I did.

3553
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:32,860
No, you did.

3554
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:33,400
You 100% did.

3555
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:34,100
I just got here.

3556
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:34,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3557
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:38,260
Oh, but maybe...

3558
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,060
Okay.

3559
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:41,120
Yeah, yeah, today's my first day.

3560
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,520
I haven't heard of any other religions.

3561
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:44,620
Well, yeah, I thought there was only one.

3562
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:48,640
Why would there be other religions when the blood god's the one true god?

3563
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:49,660
You...

3564
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:51,560
It's true.

3565
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:53,640
Why would you say there's other religions?

3566
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:54,980
I mean, I mean, God.

3567
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,760
Why did you say there's other religions?

3568
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:57,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3569
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,740
You said you're converting.

3570
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,160
You said you're converting.

3571
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,280
I thought you converted from another religion that we didn't know about.

3572
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:07,300
We were gonna have to go and take out the other cult...

3573
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:08,200
I mean, um, religion.

3574
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:12,520
I see.

3575
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,520
I see the false prophets.

3576
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:15,480
We gotta get rid of the false prophets.

3577
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,040
Yeah.

3578
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:16,720
I see.

3579
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:18,280
Yeah, exactly.

3580
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:18,620
Okay.

3581
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:21,280
Wait, do you guys have the front door as well?

3582
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,180
No, we don't have a door.

3583
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,040
I don't think so.

3584
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:24,780
We only have one door.

3585
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:25,880
Wait, wait, wait.

3586
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,300
Do you have the code for this front door?

3587
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:30,700
Dude,

3588
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:36,800
we just got so much free shit.

3589
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:37,760
I know, right?

3590
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:38,720
I told you.

3591
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:39,040
It works.

3592
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:42,800
It works.

3593
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,040
Bro, he's fucking slipping.

3594
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,840
That guy said there's other religions.

3595
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:48,340
You okay?

3596
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:50,860
I don't doubt.

3597
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:55,040
I can't believe you implied there are other religions.

3598
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:55,560
Do you have the code for the front door?

3599
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:56,560
No.

3600
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,180
Yeah, it's 4343.

3601
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,220
Oh, yeah, okay.

3602
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:01,400
4343.

3603
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:03,460
Oh, sorry, sorry.

3604
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:03,640
Okay.

3605
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,700
We need to get you guys some stuff so you can, um...

3606
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:08,660
maybe, you know, have some privacy.

3607
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:10,360
You guys have some lights here.

3608
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:11,740
You have light.

3609
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:14,260
You have to pray to the Blood God every...

3610
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:18,400
every single morning you need to pray to the Blood God to keep the light on, though.

3611
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:19,620
Oh, that's easy.

3612
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:21,500
I was praying to him just now.

3613
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,400
Oh, that's easy.

3614
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:23,120
I was praying to him just now.

3615
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,980
Yeah, that's why we're so quiet.

3616
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:26,460
I was praying to him.

3617
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:29,340
Well, that's like private.

3618
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:30,880
It's between me and the Blood God.

3619
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:31,160
Everybody knows.

3620
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,480
No, no, no.

3621
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:35,760
The Blood God wants his love public.

3622
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,420
What?

3623
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,640
What happened?

3624
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:42,580
Okay, anyway, I'll let you two get settled in.

3625
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:44,100
We'll be around.

3626
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,900
We need to go get some stone for the...

3627
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,380
for the basina opening.

3628
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:48,360
Oh, yeah, sure.

3629
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:55,420
Don't worry, we're gonna make... we're gonna clean the shop and turn it anew and make so much profit for the cult... I mean, religion.

3630
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:57,440
Oh, my God.

3631
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,840
Yes, for the... for the religion.

3632
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:00,560
Yes.

3633
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:01,700
Okay, be safe.

3634
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:02,680
Let us know if you need help.

3635
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:03,620
Yeah, of course.

3636
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:04,400
No problem.

3637
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:06,240
Bye.

3638
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:08,460
Doki, they were fucking freaks.

3639
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:11,860
But then we got so much free stuff.

3640
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:14,500
Doki, you got a fucking free house.

3641
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:16,360
I got a free house in water.

3642
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:19,460
Look at that.

3643
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:22,160
We're living the life, Gumi.

3644
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:25,080
Remember, Doki, the code is 4343.

3645
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:26,820
4343.

3646
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:27,500
How do I...

3647
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:28,160
4343.

3648
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:29,340
How do I fucking...

3649
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:30,220
enter your code?

3650
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:31,760
4343.

3651
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:32,760
Yay!

3652
02:08:37,610 --> 02:08:38,650
I can't believe it.

3653
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:40,730
We actually met the blood god called.

3654
02:08:41,070 --> 02:08:41,990
I thought they were rumors.

3655
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:45,490
No, they've always been here.

3656
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:48,210
They've been here since the very beginning.

3657
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:50,370
I thought they all died out.

3658
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:54,030
Boy, this is such a nice house.

3659
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:56,850
And we're protected by Uncle Baby Billy.

3660
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:58,030
Yeah, Uncle Baby Billy.

3661
02:08:58,170 --> 02:09:00,850
I wanna rat that guy out to Uncle Baby Billy.

3662
02:09:03,770 --> 02:09:06,350
Because he implied there were other religions.

3663
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:09,990
Yeah, do you remember his name?

3664
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:11,550
It was like Ray something.

3665
02:09:12,410 --> 02:09:13,350
Rain Bird.

3666
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:15,350
Should we rat him out?

3667
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:17,110
He tried to tell us.

3668
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:21,990
What if there was a test and he mentioned other religions on purpose so we could rat him out?

3669
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:25,330
That means the shows were loyal.

3670
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:27,830
Yeah, we should do it.

3671
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:28,670
Yeah, we should.

3672
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:31,390
We should rat him out.

3673
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:36,130
Be like, one of your fathers implied there were other religions.

3674
02:09:36,230 --> 02:09:37,590
I thought it was just one.

3675
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:40,170
Do we actually do it?

3676
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:40,830
Let's do it.

3677
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:44,250
I'm gonna give us this whole house.

3678
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:45,750
I'm gonna give us this whole house.

3679
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:48,830
Oh my god.

3680
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:54,850
Okay, I need to figure out 4, 3, 4, Oh my god, you typed the code so fast.

3681
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:57,830
Well, it's because I pre-typed it while you were busy talking.

3682
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:58,270
Oh.

3683
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:00,430
Where's Uncle Baby?

3684
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:00,830
Where's our car?

3685
02:10:01,190 --> 02:10:02,790
Wait, did they steal your car?

3686
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:03,830
And my car?

3687
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:05,150
No, my car has a lock on it.

3688
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:05,530
Oh, okay.

3689
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:10,150
Wait, this is the Sheriff's office!

3690
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:12,930
This is the fake Sheriff's office that you told me about!

3691
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:17,350
Yeah, look, it's so fake they don't even have an actual door to the cell!

3692
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:20,970
Oh my god, this is the fake!

3693
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:24,470
Oh my god, I literally rode through this fake area.

3694
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:26,230
Oh my god.

3695
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:29,410
I renamed unnamed bag.

3696
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:30,750
Somebody's sleeping bag is here.

3697
02:10:31,690 --> 02:10:32,090
Yeah.

3698
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:33,730
We should put our sleeping bags...

3699
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:35,230
Where's our cars?

3700
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:36,230
Oh, it's over here!

3701
02:10:36,430 --> 02:10:36,810
Yeah, where is it?

3702
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:38,110
Oh, there it is!

3703
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:42,210
Remember, your car is unlocked.

3704
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:43,510
They could steal your car whenever.

3705
02:10:43,690 --> 02:10:43,990
Yeah.

3706
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:46,030
Wait, I think Uncle Baby Billy's in here!

3707
02:10:47,790 --> 02:10:49,510
Is Uncle Baby Billy here?

3708
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:53,170
I love the creaminess all over my tongue.

3709
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:54,470
Oh no, wait, that's him.

3710
02:10:54,630 --> 02:10:56,430
He can't ride about when he's there.

3711
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:57,930
Can I take you to him?

3712
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,050
Can I take you to him?

3713
02:10:59,130 --> 02:10:59,650
Come, come, come.

3714
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:03,410
You were eating something creamy on your tongue.

3715
02:11:03,610 --> 02:11:05,630
We can't ride him out when he's there.

3716
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:06,770
We've seen my ice cream.

3717
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:08,650
It makes me feel bad.

3718
02:11:09,150 --> 02:11:10,650
He said he likes mint chocolate chip.

3719
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:10,950
I like ice cream.

3720
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:13,650
Wait, you...

3721
02:11:15,270 --> 02:11:18,290
Have you had pistachio ice cream?

3722
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:19,770
Pistachio?

3723
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:20,110
I have.

3724
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:21,710
I kind of like that one.

3725
02:11:21,930 --> 02:11:22,890
I don't like sweet stuff.

3726
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:23,810
There we go.

3727
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:27,410
Is that what Blood God likes too?

3728
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,230
Um...

3729
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:30,710
You know what?

3730
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:31,310
I actually don't know.

3731
02:11:31,530 --> 02:11:32,590
I'll bring you to them.

3732
02:11:32,670 --> 02:11:33,150
Come, come, come.

3733
02:11:33,430 --> 02:11:34,290
Wait, to who?

3734
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:35,630
Where is he bringing us to?

3735
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:36,730
I don't know.

3736
02:11:36,730 --> 02:11:37,970
I like strawberry ice cream.

3737
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:40,130
How are you going to snitch on him if he's here?

3738
02:11:40,210 --> 02:11:40,770
I know!

3739
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:41,450
How are we gonna...

3740
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:44,310
Why did he say strawberry like that?

3741
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:44,990
He said starberry.

3742
02:11:47,710 --> 02:11:48,890
I don't know what...

3743
02:11:49,330 --> 02:11:50,510
What accent that is.

3744
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:52,250
I'm just saying, if we get rid of...

3745
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:55,790
If we like, ride him out, we can rise up in the hierarchy.

3746
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:57,350
True.

3747
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:59,530
We can become the higher disciple.

3748
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:00,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3749
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:02,810
Because we're like more devout followers.

3750
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:05,610
I rebuilt your box.

3751
02:12:05,610 --> 02:12:06,010
Hey, Belly.

3752
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:07,270
Hey, Belly.

3753
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:07,570
It's me.

3754
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:07,870
It's me.

3755
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:08,090
It's me.

3756
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:10,850
The newcomers have some questions for you.

3757
02:12:10,890 --> 02:12:12,230
Before we take them to you.

3758
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:14,650
Doki say you have something secret to tell them.

3759
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:16,270
Oh, wait.

3760
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:18,470
Actually...

3761
02:12:20,610 --> 02:12:24,590
Well, well, Guma and I, we actually have something private we want to tell them.

3762
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:27,050
We have something private.

3763
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:29,610
It's a private question.

3764
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:30,890
Oh, you're talking about me?

3765
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:32,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3766
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:32,990
Who's father are you talking about?

3767
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:34,890
You're talking about Father Seer or you're talking about Baby Billy?

3768
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:36,690
Uncle Baby Billy.

3769
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:37,570
Uncle Baby Billy.

3770
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:37,850
Yeah.

3771
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:39,550
You tell him.

3772
02:12:39,610 --> 02:12:40,110
You tell me.

3773
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:40,590
You tell me.

3774
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:41,050
You tell him.

3775
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:42,090
Okay.

3776
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:43,590
We tell both fathers.

3777
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:46,290
We'll tell both fathers, but it's a secret question.

3778
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:47,090
We'll follow you.

3779
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:48,870
Okay, Guma.

3780
02:12:49,230 --> 02:12:49,690
We'll follow you.

3781
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:51,350
You ask us a secret question.

3782
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:55,550
You take us to...

3783
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:56,030
Oh my god.

3784
02:12:56,050 --> 02:12:57,590
What the fuck is this area?

3785
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:58,410
Okay.

3786
02:12:58,470 --> 02:12:58,970
You tell them.

3787
02:12:58,990 --> 02:12:59,470
You tell them.

3788
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:00,070
Father?

3789
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:02,030
Be Uncle Baby Billy?

3790
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:03,210
Yeah, we have a confession.

3791
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:04,450
Are there other religions?

3792
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:08,270
We were told there were other religions by the other followers.

3793
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:10,270
We were told there were other religions by the other followers.

3794
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:12,930
I thought the blood god was the one true religion.

3795
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:13,490
I thought the blood god was the one true religion.

3796
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:18,010
Mr. Rain Bird guy?

3797
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:19,530
He told us about other religions.

3798
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:20,590
Yeah.

3799
02:13:21,110 --> 02:13:26,970
Oh, now I ain't no heard about It made us confused.

3800
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:33,210
I thought he was like... it made us confused and I don't trust his faith in the Blood God.

3801
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:43,580
Really?

3802
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,880
So my faith is rock solid right now.

3803
02:13:58,620 --> 02:13:59,180
Exactly.

3804
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:04,520
And also I think it's important to understand this about Blood God.

3805
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:10,180
You know, everyone's on their own journey and path of discovering and believing in themselves.

3806
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,080
You can't force it.

3807
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:17,680
It's like forcing a baby chicken out of the egg or a baby fetus out of the mom's womb.

3808
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:19,520
Disgusting thought.

3809
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:23,980
But you gotta let people naturally hatch and figure it out themselves.

3810
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:25,020
You just can't run.

3811
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:25,520
You just can't rip the...

3812
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:29,620
You just can't rip it out of the...

3813
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:30,800
You don't know the door of the explorer.

3814
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:31,840
Hey!

3815
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:35,220
That's the thing about the Blood God too.

3816
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:39,740
We exist here to take in the lost members of this island.

3817
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:45,940
So if you feel a strong pull to one of the other kingdoms, we encourage you to go over there and join them.

3818
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:47,020
Have a good time.

3819
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:54,580
We are always here if you need us and we will be unwavering in our faith and our commitment to show you a good time.

3820
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:56,860
See ya.

3821
02:14:57,220 --> 02:14:58,920
And I might actually blow your brains out.

3822
02:14:58,980 --> 02:14:59,340
I know.

3823
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,120
Yeah.

3824
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:03,500
If I see you once you leave.

3825
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:04,440
But he might not do that.

3826
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:05,500
He might do that.

3827
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,320
We crossed that bridge when we see that.

3828
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:08,700
When we get to that bridge.

3829
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,240
You know.

3830
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:11,960
And you go on and explore those other religions.

3831
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:14,380
But as far as I'm concerned, you are an enemy of the state!

3832
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:15,720
So make up your mind!

3833
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:17,040
Oh god!

3834
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:17,640
No!

3835
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:18,920
Wait!

3836
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:19,360
Wait!

3837
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:19,640
Hold on.

3838
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,240
Hold on.

3839
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:20,840
Now.

3840
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:21,820
Now they're just asking questions.

3841
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:25,000
They're asking questions.

3842
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,980
They're just asking questions.

3843
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:31,520
We're only asking questions because...

3844
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:34,560
while your followers, they brought up about the other religion.

3845
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,860
So we got so confused.

3846
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:38,220
We thought there was only one religion here.

3847
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,240
Faith is confusing.

3848
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:45,180
I'll tell you what.

3849
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,420
Faith is confusing.

3850
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:48,340
I used to believe in a tooth fairy.

3851
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:50,300
I had faith in that guy.

3852
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:51,660
And you know what?

3853
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:52,700
I saw that.

3854
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:57,160
Every time I'd lose a tooth, I'd get a nickel underneath my pillow.

3855
02:15:57,460 --> 02:15:59,600
Yeah, but that was from the Blood God, wasn't it?

3856
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,340
And one day I saw my daddy sneaking his hand underneath my head.

3857
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,100
What?

3858
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,100
What?

3859
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,180
Oh yeah.

3860
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,060
So I think anytime...

3861
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:11,560
That's kind of a bitch.

3862
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:14,440
What was yours, man?

3863
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:17,040
I'd wake up and someone was ripping out my tooth.

3864
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:20,120
And then they'd run out the window and they said, I'm about to trade that in for a dollar.

3865
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:22,060
I thought that was Blood God the whole time.

3866
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:22,720
Oh my God.

3867
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:24,540
Where did you grow up?

3868
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,580
Ohio.

3869
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:31,900
Anywho.

3870
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:33,780
Y'all need anything else?

3871
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:35,300
Y'all want to start setting up a business?

3872
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:36,500
We can give you some supplies.

3873
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:37,620
We were wondering.

3874
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,660
They were saying that we're supposed to get baptized?

3875
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:40,720
We were wondering.

3876
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:40,720
They were saying that we're supposed to get baptized?

3877
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,280
Stokie, why would you bring that up?

3878
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:47,680
Y'all wanna commit to the church already, huh?

3879
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:49,540
Y'all wanna commit to the church already, huh?

3880
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,820
Y'all wanna commit to the church already, huh?

3881
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:52,300
I mean, there's only one religion.

3882
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:55,220
It would make sense if we committed to that one true religion.

3883
02:16:56,610 --> 02:16:57,300
Stokie, what?

3884
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:58,480
You're doubling down.

3885
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:00,720
We got the church fan right here.

3886
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,600
Wow!

3887
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:03,220
Pop in.

3888
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:07,160
I can't.

3889
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:10,740
You wanna perform a baptism?

3890
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,340
Yeah.

3891
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:13,480
Hey, Goofy.

3892
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:15,160
What did you do?

3893
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:17,920
We only got four seats.

3894
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:19,540
One second, let me get a bigger church.

3895
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:23,840
We are being devoted to the church.

3896
02:17:24,420 --> 02:17:24,700
And a bigger one?

3897
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:27,220
Stokie, I think my game crashed.

3898
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,020
No, you're in.

3899
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:31,180
Oh yeah, come look at our three cars, hoss.

3900
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:32,880
Ladies, come look with me.

3901
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:33,760
I'll show you our cars.

3902
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:37,180
What, you don't wanna join?

3903
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:38,420
They're so nice though.

3904
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:41,440
I'm using my two-way pager.

3905
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:42,700
Nah, that's fine.

3906
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,940
I'll catch up with you later.

3907
02:17:43,940 --> 02:17:44,820
You have toilet paper?

3908
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:46,060
Okay, okay.

3909
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:51,960
Oh, you're not a true believer?

3910
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,000
Here we go.

3911
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,020
See all these cars?

3912
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:58,620
Wait till they kill your ass at the baptism.

3913
02:17:58,620 --> 02:17:59,520
These are the church's cars right here.

3914
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:00,780
They're not gonna kill us.

3915
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:02,080
They're so nice.

3916
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:04,780
This is our religious fleet right here.

3917
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:05,440
Oh my god.

3918
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,640
Would that be for one of us too?

3919
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:09,500
The blood god has blessed us.

3920
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:12,620
The bang bus.

3921
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:14,600
The bang bus.

3922
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:15,760
The bang bus.

3923
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:16,460
The bang bus.

3924
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,380
I'll bring the parts for us so you can get a boob.

3925
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:20,080
Alright, hold on.

3926
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:22,740
How'd he get in?

3927
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,080
He has some lucky face.

3928
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:26,340
Is this gotta gas?

3929
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:28,180
Nah.

3930
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:30,040
We're putting the parts in right now.

3931
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:32,720
Alright, we're going on a church mission.

3932
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:34,120
A church mission?

3933
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:36,160
How long are you gonna be on, Doki?

3934
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,820
I have another stream in three hours.

3935
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,100
The door code is a boob.

3936
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:44,980
We're going down to the river to do a baptism.

3937
02:18:45,380 --> 02:18:45,780
Wait.

3938
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:46,860
A baptism?

3939
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:49,160
Oh my god, we're gonna get baptized.

3940
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,780
I'm walking in.

3941
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,140
Oh shit.

3942
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:56,180
Oh, you guys almost hit me.

3943
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:56,680
Are you guys okay?

3944
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:58,080
What happened?

3945
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,840
Okay, come here.

3946
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:01,260
Come here.

3947
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:05,220
Put your guitar away.

3948
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:06,360
Okay.

3949
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:08,620
He's a terrible driver.

3950
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:10,800
Oh my god.

3951
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:12,100
Oh, I've done it.

3952
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:14,820
I got praise B.

3953
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:15,920
Jericho!

3954
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,200
I love a good fetus.

3955
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:23,480
I think we're moments away from having this car juiced up right now.

3956
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:24,960
How do I get in?

3957
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:27,460
I don't know.

3958
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:31,380
How do you get in?

3959
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:32,100
Alright, here we go everybody.

3960
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:32,760
Whoa.

3961
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:36,120
I need a passcode.

3962
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:37,640
Boob.

3963
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,120
Oh, it's boob?

3964
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:39,880
Okay.

3965
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,540
Which one?

3966
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:44,300
What's boob again?

3967
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:46,040
Oh, eight.

3968
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:48,460
You son of a bitch.

3969
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:51,180
From 404.

3970
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,040
I went down to the river to pray.

3971
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:57,380
Worrying about that good old day.

3972
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:58,480
Okay, I'm gonna jump to nothing.

3973
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:00,760
It's a little sketchy, I'll be honest.

3974
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:02,540
Come on, we get baptized!

3975
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,140
Scooby, let's go!

3976
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,920
One more, children.

3977
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:07,740
Oh my god.

3978
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:08,340
Hallelujah!

3979
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:11,920
We lost some.

3980
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:14,160
Who did we lose?

3981
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:15,620
We lost K.

3982
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:15,760
Rool.

3983
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:15,940
We lost K.

3984
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:16,160
Rool.

3985
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:17,880
Hey!

3986
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:20,480
Where is he?

3987
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,900
We're being fired!

3988
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:27,640
Let's go down.

3989
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:30,420
Down to the river and pray.

3990
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:31,840
Oh my god.

3991
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:33,300
Look, he sings to the guitar!

3992
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:35,500
I went down to the river to pray.

3993
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:39,660
Worrying about that good old day.

3994
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:40,140
Worrying about that good old day.

3995
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,600
And who should wait?

3996
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:42,160
Yeah!

3997
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,900
I went down to the river to pray.

3998
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,020
Oh my god.

3999
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:46,700
Show me the way.

4000
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:51,640
All sinners, let's go down.

4001
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:53,540
Let's go down.

4002
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:54,940
Don't you wanna go?

4003
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:55,780
Alright, we here.

4004
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:56,220
Get out.

4005
02:20:57,780 --> 02:20:59,240
Oh shit, okay.

4006
02:20:59,300 --> 02:20:59,980
Oh shit, okay.

4007
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:01,980
Alright.

4008
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:04,480
I know, but it lost to the je ne sais quoi.

4009
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:06,580
Alright, Scooby, you first.

4010
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:08,400
We don't need you to baptize these ladies.

4011
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:09,480
Oh god.

4012
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:11,680
Come on, Scooby!

4013
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:13,080
Don't you believe?

4014
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:16,960
Alright, alright.

4015
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,120
I do believe.

4016
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:19,780
Come on and step into the water.

4017
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:20,520
See you gonna baptize you now.

4018
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:21,920
Y'all got beds in this...

4019
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:24,480
Did y'all get a home or bed in this town?

4020
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:25,580
No.

4021
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:28,960
No, our beds are really far.

4022
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:32,500
Hold on, who got cloth?

4023
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:33,620
Don't drown, don't drown.

4024
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:34,420
Oh damn.

4025
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,160
I think we're gonna die.

4026
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,120
They're killing us.

4027
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:39,340
Hang on one second.

4028
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:40,480
Don't baptize them yet.

4029
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:44,180
I think they're killing us.

4030
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,020
I think they're killing us.

4031
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:50,760
So tell us about where you were before you found the church.

4032
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:51,860
Why would we need beds, father?

4033
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:54,160
Where we found the church?

4034
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,720
Yeah, where were you before?

4035
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,400
Well, I had to pick her up.

4036
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:00,760
She was right next to the church.

4037
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:04,120
But she told me this fellow ran her over.

4038
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:04,320
But she told me this fellow ran her over.

4039
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,160
Yeah, someone ran me over next to the church.

4040
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:09,620
Did you catch her name?

4041
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,680
Yeah, Esfren.

4042
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:13,860
Who is he?

4043
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:15,760
Who is he?

4044
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:18,080
You know what?

4045
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:18,760
You know what?

4046
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:20,200
You're not the only person.

4047
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:25,240
You're not the only person to mutter those names that you've been run over by.

4048
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:28,480
Well, is he a bad person to the church?

4049
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:30,160
He wants to kill a lot of people from the church.

4050
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:31,380
Wait.

4051
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:35,320
They seem to only run people over outside the church.

4052
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:36,420
They seem to only run people over outside the church.

4053
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,580
Yeah, they're a bit of troublemakers.

4054
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:38,920
Does he hate the church?

4055
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:39,300
Does he hate the church?

4056
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:39,800
Yeah.

4057
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:41,480
Are they heretics?

4058
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:42,100
I hate the church.

4059
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:43,440
I mean, listen.

4060
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,020
Are they heretics?

4061
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,060
Yeah, but here's the thing.

4062
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:50,540
You just can't restart VODs all the time.

4063
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:54,960
Otherwise, in Blood God, we're gonna run out of resources to give us for all of our VODs.

4064
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:59,000
We just let the bygones be bygones.

4065
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:02,480
And we let those who are still trying to find their faith.

4066
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:03,240
And we let those who are still trying to find their faith.

4067
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:04,360
We let them find their faith.

4068
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:05,600
We let them find their faith.

4069
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:07,740
So it's alright.

4070
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,340
It ain't no big thing.

4071
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:12,020
Let the water wash away the sins.

4072
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:14,180
They just strayed from the path.

4073
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:14,940
They just strayed from the path.

4074
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:18,260
I see.

4075
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:21,460
God, she really dig it in international school with that.

4076
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,540
Hey, so, Hoki, you're a musical artist, right?

4077
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:25,660
Oh, yeah.

4078
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:26,520
Yeah, I can draw.

4079
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:31,560
So, um, No, no, musically, musically, musically.

4080
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:32,640
Oh, yeah, I'm here too.

4081
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:33,860
Yeah, I'm very talented.

4082
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:37,320
So, Caymus can...

4083
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:38,560
Caymus can rap.

4084
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:39,600
Right?

4085
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:46,580
So, whilst we're waiting for this, uh, you know, baptism to get on the way, you two do a little, um, a little duet, huh?

4086
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, Caymus, show us your rap skills.

4087
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:50,520
He'll be here.

4088
02:23:56,180 --> 02:23:57,160
I'll show you then.

4089
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:58,560
But not right now.

4090
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:01,840
Alright, ladies, you're gonna need these.

4091
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:02,480
Hold on.

4092
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:06,320
There's one sleeping bag.

4093
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:10,020
How do I make a s- 10 seconds.

4094
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:11,900
Now you can call this place your home.

4095
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:13,420
Oh!

4096
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:13,820
Hold on now.

4097
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:15,000
Make sure you sign that bag.

4098
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:18,420
Yeah, sign it.

4099
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:19,360
One more second.

4100
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,180
Hold on.

4101
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,340
Just put it out?

4102
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:22,320
There you go.

4103
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:23,600
Yeah, you put it down on the floor.

4104
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:24,120
Right there.

4105
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:25,780
Grab it and put it on the floor.

4106
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:26,760
Okay.

4107
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:28,380
So just drop it?

4108
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:31,920
No, you hold it in your hand and then left click.

4109
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:32,540
Oh, okay.

4110
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:34,120
Yay!

4111
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:35,880
Perfect.

4112
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:38,100
Y'all members of the town, congratulations!

4113
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:39,920
Yay!

4114
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:41,020
Yippee!

4115
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:44,300
Yippee!

4116
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:46,140
You can commence with the baptism.

4117
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:47,360
Let the ritual commence.

4118
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,120
Okay.

4119
02:24:48,380 --> 02:24:49,000
I'm scared.

4120
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:52,460
Yes, Elias, Elias, come out and step into the water.

4121
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:55,980
Should we look into your eyes when it happens?

4122
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:56,600
Not too far.

4123
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,440
You ain't wanna drown.

4124
02:24:58,760 --> 02:24:59,840
No, no, no.

4125
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,260
I just want y'all to just...

4126
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:02,600
understand.

4127
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:06,760
When Blood God came, he rained down a...

4128
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,600
a bloody storm upon this...

4129
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:08,960
store...

4130
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:09,040
of...

4131
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:09,860
soil...

4132
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:11,440
and these lands and that...

4133
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:14,600
that blood is filtered on through into the center of this planet.

4134
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:15,400
Inside of it.

4135
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:16,340
Where is this the name?

4136
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:16,560
The pla...

4137
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,980
The core of the planet is the swishy-swashy blood.

4138
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:22,680
And it all recycles and it runs through everything.

4139
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:24,300
It runs through us as well.

4140
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:27,980
And Blood God, he forgive us for our sins.

4141
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,400
Ever since day one.

4142
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:32,280
The day you're born.

4143
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:35,400
And every sacrifice that's made...

4144
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:37,000
is a cost to everything.

4145
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,500
Every death.

4146
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:39,380
Every life.

4147
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:42,680
And in doing all of that...

4148
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:45,200
There is a cost to everything we figure out.

4149
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:46,480
You must be reborn.

4150
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:48,260
You must be sacrificed.

4151
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:52,120
All three episódio and down the road.

4152
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:53,360
And you see...

4153
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:55,400
And just like that there is a circle of lives.

4154
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:58,180
And thecence Good shot, Cavers!

4155
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:01,600
And sacrifices must be made.

4156
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:05,100
And that's just how that cookie crumbled...

4157
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,020
Amen That's what we say.

4158
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:13,280
Let the water wash away those sins.

4159
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:16,660
Alright, let the water wash away those sins.

4160
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:19,400
Let the water wash away those sins.

4161
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,240
And you shall be reborn to that sin.

4162
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:23,960
You shall be reborn to that sin.

4163
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:38,240
Don't give me 100 wait till our sleeping bag timer's up.

4164
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:39,540
Why?

4165
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:44,700
Wait, I have 670 seconds.

4166
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,960
I can't wonder where we are.

4167
02:26:48,980 --> 02:26:50,420
Oh my god.

4168
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:56,900
Oh my god.

4169
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,820
We're in the Blood God Cult!

4170
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:01,840
We did it!

4171
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,780
We did it, Goobie!

4172
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:11,980
We're part of the one true religion!

4173
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:15,520
We're in the family!

4174
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:18,700
Yeah?

4175
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:22,260
Yeah?

4176
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,540
What's wrong?

4177
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:26,860
Nothing.

4178
02:27:33,930 --> 02:27:38,250
Oh my god.

4179
02:27:40,690 --> 02:27:42,970
I'm gonna be reborn in 100 seconds.

4180
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:47,870
How do you feel joining a cult?

4181
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:50,050
I don't know.

4182
02:27:50,310 --> 02:27:52,730
I feel safe at the same time.

4183
02:27:53,150 --> 02:27:54,110
Yeah, but this...

4184
02:27:54,650 --> 02:27:56,950
This will be the only time we ever get shot.

4185
02:27:57,150 --> 02:27:57,950
They'll protect us.

4186
02:27:58,710 --> 02:27:59,850
I don't know if that's true.

4187
02:28:00,030 --> 02:28:01,270
I don't know if that's true, man.

4188
02:28:01,650 --> 02:28:03,970
I'm pretty sure we'll get shot and they can't protect us everywhere.

4189
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:05,550
No, there's no way.

4190
02:28:05,610 --> 02:28:09,750
We'll just say that the Blood God will punish you.

4191
02:28:11,150 --> 02:28:11,350
Oh.

4192
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:14,170
We're gonna be reborn.

4193
02:28:14,170 --> 02:28:16,470
The way they punished that guy that was running in the river.

4194
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:17,050
Yeah.

4195
02:28:18,610 --> 02:28:21,790
Yeah, Eerov that was just randomly swimming in the river.

4196
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:23,870
Yeah, Eerov that was just randomly swimming in the river.

4197
02:28:29,370 --> 02:28:30,530
Oh my god.

4198
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:30,890
Oh my god.

4199
02:28:30,890 --> 02:28:31,190
Oh my god.

4200
02:28:31,270 --> 02:28:31,830
Oh my god.

4201
02:28:31,830 --> 02:28:32,770
I can't believe it.

4202
02:28:33,290 --> 02:28:35,470
I have 35 seconds on mine.

4203
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:36,490
Wait, how come you...

4204
02:28:36,490 --> 02:28:37,290
Oh, because you had...

4205
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:39,930
You should tell them that there's a cooldown.

4206
02:28:41,070 --> 02:28:43,210
They're gonna be like, where are the girls?

4207
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:45,570
They lied to us.

4208
02:28:48,030 --> 02:28:50,570
They're just like, where did they go?

4209
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:51,290
They're just like, where did they go?

4210
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:55,430
It's okay, don't worry.

4211
02:28:55,630 --> 02:28:58,990
You tell them that we're still just waiting.

4212
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:00,570
I'm waiting for mine.

4213
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:09,710
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2...

4214
02:29:09,710 --> 02:29:13,390
Apparently Eerov has been trying to kill the cult for like 2 days.

4215
02:29:13,650 --> 02:29:15,130
But has not been successful.

4216
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:16,350
That's...

4217
02:29:18,330 --> 02:29:20,570
I mean, look, I would...

4218
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:21,070
I mean, how?

4219
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:22,470
They're like a fucking army.

4220
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:25,490
Guys, it's not a cult.

4221
02:29:25,570 --> 02:29:26,270
They're a real religion.

4222
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:29,510
How dare you would say that to our one true God.

4223
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:34,960
Okay.

4224
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:36,820
Oh.

4225
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:39,420
Alright!

4226
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:41,300
I have been reborn!

4227
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:45,700
We did!

4228
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:46,640
You did.

4229
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:48,740
Alright.

4230
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:50,580
Oh, okay.

4231
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:53,740
How do I do this faster?

4232
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,060
Right click.

4233
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:56,860
You have been reborn!

4234
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,320
Oh my God.

4235
02:29:59,020 --> 02:29:59,540
Yeah!

4236
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,360
Wait, how do I fucking...

4237
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:07,240
And that's bad to teach you that death can be a sweet and fast and quick thing.

4238
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:10,560
Cause we're gonna experience a lot of it out here in these rust kingdoms.

4239
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,920
Wait, why are you hitting your body?

4240
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:15,180
Yep.

4241
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:17,100
That doesn't matter as much as what you'll say on...

4242
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:24,180
You know, some people say that being reborn is kinda like the similar sensation you get when you get your butt kicked.

4243
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:24,740
But as you say it's just gonna be one whole wax.

4244
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,320
At first it hurts.

4245
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:27,840
But then it feels good.

4246
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:29,340
Ohhhhh.

4247
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:32,680
Have you done that before, Uncle Billy?

4248
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:34,540
Yeah, have you done that, Uncle?

4249
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:41,640
Oh, yeah, don't let baby Billy's beard fool you from the neck down baby Billy is smooth like a porpoise.

4250
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:42,360
Damn!

4251
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:44,500
Damn, Uncle Billy-Billy.

4252
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:46,840
Watch how fast I am in the water.

4253
02:30:46,980 --> 02:30:47,840
I'm like Michael Phelps.

4254
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:48,420
Look at that.

4255
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:49,740
Oh my god!

4256
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:51,600
He is like a porpoise.

4257
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:59,500
Oh baby Billy got some of that lake water in his lungs.

4258
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:05,000
We've been reborn Gumi!

4259
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:06,660
We're believers now!

4260
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:13,200
And by the way, let it be said, whenever you need a drink of water, we live right next to this river.

4261
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:16,140
You come up and gulp that river down a little bit and you get refreshed.

4262
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:18,540
Oh my god!

4263
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:22,920
The more we drink, the more we believe!

4264
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:28,100
Back to some water!

4265
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:37,340
Oh I see!

4266
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:41,400
He was getting right from his gun.

4267
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,140
Woah!

4268
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:44,400
He's flavored!

4269
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:46,340
Yep!

4270
02:31:47,740 --> 02:31:48,600
Bang bus!

4271
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,640
Bang bus!

4272
02:31:51,460 --> 02:31:53,720
Oh yeah, he's pretty flavored.

4273
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:55,180
Oh no, baby Billy!

4274
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,120
I'm Billy!

4275
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:57,920
You don't wanna drive?

4276
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,140
Gumi, you should drive!

4277
02:31:59,180 --> 02:31:59,960
You're a great driver!

4278
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:06,640
I lost my guitar, Gumi.

4279
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,560
But he sings every time he drives.

4280
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:08,820
That's true.

4281
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,500
I lost my guitar, Gumi.

4282
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:12,580
You have to ask them nicely for one.

4283
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:13,100
Maybe.

4284
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:15,200
Don't get a little bumpy here.

4285
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:15,820
Oh shit!

4286
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:21,160
We're also, while we are highly religious, we're also highly progressive as well.

4287
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:22,560
Yeah!

4288
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:23,860
As is the society!

4289
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:26,300
Yeah!

4290
02:32:26,300 --> 02:32:30,620
If you choose to go by they them pronouns, we will respect that.

4291
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:32,840
Even if we decide to sacrifice you.

4292
02:32:32,940 --> 02:32:33,420
What?

4293
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:38,300
If you are dumb, I will sacrifice you.

4294
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:39,900
Oh, okay.

4295
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:44,300
All right.

4296
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:47,460
All right, everybody.

4297
02:32:48,140 --> 02:32:49,380
Welcome to the church.

4298
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:51,120
Oh my God.

4299
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:52,840
Who's that, baby Billy?

4300
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:55,660
Hi.

4301
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,360
Who dat?

4302
02:32:56,920 --> 02:32:57,960
Hey, how you doing?

4303
02:32:58,060 --> 02:32:58,900
What's your name?

4304
02:32:59,020 --> 02:32:59,520
I'm Mr. Traveler.

4305
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:01,220
My name is Francis.

4306
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,700
What's the stop?

4307
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:04,940
I'm Mr. All.

4308
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:06,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4309
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:07,640
I'm just here.

4310
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,300
I'm looking for people.

4311
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:10,820
We have a restaurant off the road.

4312
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:13,880
And I'm just looking for customers that we could bring and introduce.

4313
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:15,700
You know, free food too.

4314
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:18,200
But I see you guys might be busy.

4315
02:33:19,540 --> 02:33:19,980
Free food?

4316
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:21,980
Unless you guys are hungry and would like to make a visit.

4317
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:23,840
Wait, what is that?

4318
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:24,540
You got a restaurant?

4319
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:25,240
Sounds like a trap to me.

4320
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:26,660
We have a beautiful restaurant.

4321
02:33:26,660 --> 02:33:27,040
Hey, listen.

4322
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:28,420
We got two new...

4323
02:33:28,420 --> 02:33:32,600
We got two recently reborn members of our church right here.

4324
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:33,720
Why don't you take these two?

4325
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:34,740
Feed them a nice meal.

4326
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:35,680
Oh, yes.

4327
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:36,500
We're hungry.

4328
02:33:36,820 --> 02:33:37,200
Absolutely.

4329
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:38,140
I would be honored.

4330
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:40,420
Let's go.

4331
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:42,200
Hey, you all want to take the church, man?

4332
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:42,200
It's not too far.

4333
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:42,640
Let's go.

4334
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:44,940
Alright, y'all.

4335
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,820
You go with him.

4336
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:47,420
But if you need the van, just let me know.

4337
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:48,360
You know the passcode.

4338
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:49,220
Yeah, yeah.

4339
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:49,680
We know.

4340
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:50,280
Yes, sir.

4341
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:52,840
If anyone else wants to come by, we'll be back.

4342
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:53,840
Oh my God.

4343
02:33:54,340 --> 02:33:54,740
Bye.

4344
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:56,080
I stole their horse.

4345
02:33:56,380 --> 02:33:56,720
Let's go.

4346
02:33:57,380 --> 02:33:58,700
So you should ride off with that shit.

4347
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:00,860
You're a customer of this shop.

4348
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:03,220
I mean, didn't you enjoy the food?

4349
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:03,440
It was pretty good.

4350
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:04,800
Wait, we were?

4351
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:05,920
You come back?

4352
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:06,620
We never ate there before.

4353
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:07,800
We've never been there before.

4354
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:09,120
No one's been there.

4355
02:34:09,380 --> 02:34:10,760
Yeah, this is our first time.

4356
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:11,320
I woke up.

4357
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:12,200
I was less hungry.

4358
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:13,840
I woke up.

4359
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:13,840
I was less hungry.

4360
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:14,620
Let's go, Yoinks.

4361
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:16,920
Let's show them the true greatness of this restaurant.

4362
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:21,060
You gotta be a returning customer from that last experience.

4363
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:22,540
Yeah, yeah.

4364
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:24,420
Being reborn took up a lot.

4365
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:25,300
It's an abandoned supermarket, so it's not too far.

4366
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:28,680
What if I just ride off?

4367
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:32,740
So you guys are a part of that church?

4368
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:35,600
Yeah, we just joined it like five minutes ago.

4369
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:39,540
What's it been like?

4370
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:40,280
They wouldn't let me in.

4371
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:41,920
Wait, why wouldn't they let you in?

4372
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:42,040
I have to go get a car.

4373
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:45,160
I'm Canadian.

4374
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:47,780
Wait, I'm Canadian?

4375
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:48,740
They let me in?

4376
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:49,900
Are you sure?

4377
02:34:50,060 --> 02:34:51,480
What part of Canada are you from?

4378
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:52,920
Are you from the bad parts of Canada?

4379
02:34:54,980 --> 02:34:56,200
No, I'm from Ontario.

4380
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:56,940
Oh!

4381
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:03,780
I don't think it's a Canadian thing, sir.

4382
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:05,420
Yeah.

4383
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:07,620
I think it's just a youth thing.

4384
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:08,920
They don't like you.

4385
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:09,300
Yeah.

4386
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:14,040
I think it's because you were like... you're like half naked.

4387
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:15,960
Poor!

4388
02:35:19,050 --> 02:35:20,830
Did I give you a car?

4389
02:35:21,250 --> 02:35:21,610
Yeah, maybe it's just poor except poor people.

4390
02:35:23,770 --> 02:35:25,030
Yeah, but it didn't have gas.

4391
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:25,690
I don't have gas.

4392
02:35:26,290 --> 02:35:27,750
You could have sold it.

4393
02:35:28,490 --> 02:35:29,450
That's it up ahead.

4394
02:35:29,610 --> 02:35:31,230
That brick building is the restaurant.

4395
02:35:31,370 --> 02:35:31,990
We're almost there.

4396
02:35:32,210 --> 02:35:32,710
Oh my God.

4397
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:33,970
Okay, I'll meet you guys there.

4398
02:35:39,530 --> 02:35:39,970
Yoink.

4399
02:35:40,090 --> 02:35:40,530
Maho.

4400
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:42,830
Oh my God.

4401
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:44,390
They're going to feed us free food, guys.

4402
02:35:46,890 --> 02:35:47,390
Okay.

4403
02:35:48,850 --> 02:35:49,630
Let's see.

4404
02:35:50,930 --> 02:35:51,830
Hello, Doki.

4405
02:35:51,990 --> 02:35:52,350
Hello!

4406
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:52,950
Welcome.

4407
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:54,430
Is this the restaurant?

4408
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:57,470
It is!

4409
02:35:57,810 --> 02:35:58,510
Come on in!

4410
02:35:58,670 --> 02:35:58,830
Yeah!

4411
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:02,030
The guy told me that you're giving out free food!

4412
02:36:04,570 --> 02:36:06,490
Oh yeah, please come have a bite.

4413
02:36:06,730 --> 02:36:07,630
Oh my God.

4414
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:10,090
Let me get you something to eat, Doki.

4415
02:36:10,490 --> 02:36:10,990
Yeah!

4416
02:36:11,330 --> 02:36:12,230
Hey, fancy!

4417
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:16,470
We actually have another visitor on her way.

4418
02:36:16,610 --> 02:36:17,810
She's actually driving right here.

4419
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:21,010
So, I guess we'll start getting the food ready.

4420
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:22,190
Oh my God.

4421
02:36:22,350 --> 02:36:23,190
Yeah, I'll start cooking.

4422
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:24,510
We have Yoinks.

4423
02:36:24,650 --> 02:36:25,830
Yoinks is also outside.

4424
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:28,870
He's stopping by after that last dinner.

4425
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:30,110
Are you guys...

4426
02:36:30,110 --> 02:36:32,270
Are we our first customer?

4427
02:36:32,490 --> 02:36:33,890
Looking for some more food, Yoinks?

4428
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:36,390
Oh no, we've had a few.

4429
02:36:36,470 --> 02:36:37,050
We've had a few.

4430
02:36:37,570 --> 02:36:39,070
How's the restaurant been going?

4431
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:39,910
Hop inside.

4432
02:36:41,210 --> 02:36:41,930
Yum yum yum.

4433
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:43,610
Oh, business is pretty good.

4434
02:36:46,890 --> 02:36:49,250
Pretty good supply of food coming in.

4435
02:36:50,890 --> 02:36:55,450
We do have other tables if you did want to have more of a private dining experience.

4436
02:36:55,610 --> 02:36:58,730
This is more of like a chat with your cook kind of experience.

4437
02:36:58,730 --> 02:36:59,850
Oh, a chat with our cook?

4438
02:36:59,990 --> 02:37:00,270
You know what?

4439
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:01,670
I like a chat with my cook.

4440
02:37:03,870 --> 02:37:04,630
Oh, perfect.

4441
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:05,370
Perfect.

4442
02:37:05,570 --> 02:37:06,430
So, here you go.

4443
02:37:06,490 --> 02:37:08,130
I got this cooked up fresh for you.

4444
02:37:08,210 --> 02:37:09,450
I hope you enjoy.

4445
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:10,250
Oh!

4446
02:37:10,850 --> 02:37:12,670
Where did you get this meat?

4447
02:37:16,350 --> 02:37:19,470
You know, it kind of just walks right in here, Doki.

4448
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:20,630
Oh, really?

4449
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:21,510
Just...

4450
02:37:22,530 --> 02:37:23,510
Oh my god.

4451
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:24,370
Wait, that one's raw.

4452
02:37:25,630 --> 02:37:26,850
Yeah, I got you.

4453
02:37:28,290 --> 02:37:30,030
Doki, I think they're gonna kill us for our meat.

4454
02:37:31,110 --> 02:37:32,990
So, Lola, how's your wife been going?

4455
02:37:33,310 --> 02:37:34,170
So, like...

4456
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:36,930
So, they said this is like free food.

4457
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:39,630
So, how are you making the money to buy the meat?

4458
02:37:41,550 --> 02:37:41,990
Uh...

4459
02:37:42,910 --> 02:37:43,350
Uh hmm.

4460
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:48,350
Uh-huh?

4461
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:51,690
Um, we have our ways of getting the meat.

4462
02:37:52,730 --> 02:37:54,730
That's a very nice gun you have there.

4463
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:55,070
It's fancy.

4464
02:37:55,410 --> 02:37:55,850
It's...

4465
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:57,350
It's...

4466
02:37:57,350 --> 02:38:00,350
We uh... We appear to have some loose products.

4467
02:38:00,350 --> 02:38:00,950
Doki, get out!

4468
02:38:00,990 --> 02:38:01,150
Run!

4469
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:01,490
Hurry!

4470
02:38:01,850 --> 02:38:02,550
Doki, run!

4471
02:38:03,030 --> 02:38:04,850
I...I have to...I have to get out!

4472
02:38:05,470 --> 02:38:05,910
Doki!

4473
02:38:05,950 --> 02:38:05,950
Get out!

4474
02:38:05,950 --> 02:38:06,490
Doki get out!

4475
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:07,030
I have to get out!

4476
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:07,150
I have to...I have to get out!

4477
02:38:07,450 --> 02:38:07,890
I have to go!

4478
02:38:07,890 --> 02:38:07,950
Go!

4479
02:38:08,650 --> 02:38:09,170
Go!

4480
02:38:09,390 --> 02:38:09,830
Go!

4481
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:10,330
Go!

4482
02:38:10,330 --> 02:38:10,910
Get back here!

4483
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:13,230
Get back here!

4484
02:38:13,710 --> 02:38:14,850
Save me!

4485
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:17,110
Don't let them kill me!

4486
02:38:17,330 --> 02:38:18,410
Get back here!

4487
02:38:18,870 --> 02:38:20,150
Get back here!

4488
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:22,150
Get up over here!

4489
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:24,370
Damn it!

4490
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:28,830
Get back here!

4491
02:38:28,830 --> 02:38:29,730
Get back here!

4492
02:38:29,750 --> 02:38:30,210
Get back here!

4493
02:38:30,730 --> 02:38:33,650
We're gonna tell the blood god about you!

4494
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:47,250
I think they were catapults!

4495
02:38:48,130 --> 02:38:50,430
They were catapults!

4496
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:52,390
Oh my god, tell me!

4497
02:38:58,630 --> 02:39:01,890
Okay, they're pretty horrible shots though, not gonna lie.

4498
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:05,950
Oh no!

4499
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,470
They're pretty bad shots!

4500
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:11,830
I wish I should have stole their fucking horse.

4501
02:39:16,950 --> 02:39:18,250
Should we go back to your place?

4502
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:22,110
Wait, is this your... what are you doing?

4503
02:39:22,310 --> 02:39:23,150
Are you fixing the car?

4504
02:39:23,630 --> 02:39:24,950
Wait, get off the car.

4505
02:39:25,170 --> 02:39:25,570
Okay.

4506
02:39:25,730 --> 02:39:27,610
I put a lock in it so no one can steal it.

4507
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:28,290
Ah, I see.

4508
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:28,910
Is this your house?

4509
02:39:31,890 --> 02:39:33,430
Wait, who's car- Oh, public garage!

4510
02:39:36,850 --> 02:39:39,250
Okay, Ducky, the code is 4343.

4511
02:39:40,490 --> 02:39:41,050
4343.

4512
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:42,890
4343.

4513
02:39:43,210 --> 02:39:43,550
Okay.

4514
02:39:44,810 --> 02:39:45,370
Man.

4515
02:39:45,950 --> 02:39:47,370
We almost got murdered.

4516
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:50,150
I know.

4517
02:39:50,330 --> 02:39:51,770
We need to talk to baby Billy.

4518
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:53,510
Bro, I think they killed Yoinks.

4519
02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:58,010
I think they killed the random guy that was with us.

4520
02:39:59,010 --> 02:40:00,730
Yeah, they just came back.

4521
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:01,110
More!

4522
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:03,330
The bank bus is gone.

4523
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:04,050
Oh, wait.

4524
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:04,970
No, it's right here.

4525
02:40:05,150 --> 02:40:05,610
Yeah, yeah.

4526
02:40:08,250 --> 02:40:09,530
We're out of gas, Ducky.

4527
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:10,730
Oh no.

4528
02:40:10,890 --> 02:40:11,670
Did we just park it here?

4529
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:12,390
This is their place.

4530
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:15,110
Right here.

4531
02:40:16,250 --> 02:40:16,990
Oh my god.

4532
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:18,410
I can't believe we lived.

4533
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:21,670
Our house!

4534
02:40:21,810 --> 02:40:23,170
Please come to the little pool!

4535
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:25,390
Does our- Oh my god, it does!

4536
02:40:27,290 --> 02:40:28,370
We're living it!

4537
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:30,410
We survived!

4538
02:40:30,410 --> 02:40:31,970
And we have a pool!

4539
02:40:32,370 --> 02:40:33,570
What's that, Ducky?

4540
02:40:33,910 --> 02:40:34,330
What's that?

4541
02:40:34,550 --> 02:40:35,610
Oh, it's him!

4542
02:40:35,710 --> 02:40:36,870
He almost got killed!

4543
02:40:38,810 --> 02:40:41,850
There's cannibalism- Cannibals living down the street!

4544
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:43,070
Yeah!

4545
02:40:44,030 --> 02:40:46,210
They tried to kill us for our meat.

4546
02:40:46,630 --> 02:40:48,250
They told us there was free food.

4547
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:48,770
What?

4548
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:48,770
Who?

4549
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:50,690
They live down the street!

4550
02:40:51,150 --> 02:40:54,250
They're like- At the abandoned supermarket.

4551
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:55,210
Yeah!

4552
02:40:55,410 --> 02:40:56,350
They're like over there!

4553
02:40:56,830 --> 02:40:57,350
Oh my god.

4554
02:40:59,150 --> 02:41:00,870
Try to eat some of the followers!

4555
02:41:01,310 --> 02:41:02,630
I actually have- Okay, no, no, no.

4556
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:06,190
We'll- We'll- We'll- We'll- One for you and one for you, okay?

4557
02:41:06,250 --> 02:41:06,570
Yay!

4558
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:09,810
They tried to give us human meat to eat.

4559
02:41:10,030 --> 02:41:10,610
And a worm.

4560
02:41:10,670 --> 02:41:11,450
But don't eat that.

4561
02:41:11,530 --> 02:41:12,150
Don't eat that though.

4562
02:41:12,190 --> 02:41:12,590
Don't eat that.

4563
02:41:12,610 --> 02:41:13,390
Unless you want to.

4564
02:41:13,510 --> 02:41:14,590
I'm not- I'm not judging.

4565
02:41:16,830 --> 02:41:17,390
I'm okay.

4566
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:19,610
Uh...

4567
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:22,370
Uh...

4568
02:41:24,430 --> 02:41:27,050
Yeah, what are we gonna do about the cannibals down the street?

4569
02:41:27,050 --> 02:41:27,510
Hold on.

4570
02:41:29,410 --> 02:41:30,830
How far down are they?

4571
02:41:30,890 --> 02:41:32,990
Are they outside of the village or- At the market?

4572
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:34,310
At the supermarket.

4573
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:35,510
The abandoned supermarket.

4574
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:36,870
At the market.

4575
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:40,470
Did they- Did they- Did they- So you see we were talking about ice cream earlier.

4576
02:41:40,670 --> 02:41:46,970
Did they have the kind of, you know, the vibe that you thought they like, you know, were like, Hey kids, I've got ice cream coming to my shop.

4577
02:41:47,050 --> 02:41:49,390
No, Uncle- Uncle told us to go!

4578
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:51,850
Like he trusted them too.

4579
02:41:53,010 --> 02:41:53,410
Hey!

4580
02:41:54,310 --> 02:41:55,050
That's the cannibal!

4581
02:41:55,910 --> 02:41:56,790
That's the cannibal!

4582
02:41:58,370 --> 02:41:59,330
They're cannibals!

4583
02:41:59,910 --> 02:42:00,070
No!

4584
02:42:00,110 --> 02:42:01,190
He shot at us!

4585
02:42:01,190 --> 02:42:02,170
He shot at us earlier!

4586
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:03,430
He's shooting!

4587
02:42:03,430 --> 02:42:03,650
No!

4588
02:42:03,950 --> 02:42:04,430
No!

4589
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:04,790
No!

4590
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:05,150
No!

4591
02:42:05,150 --> 02:42:05,610
No!

4592
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:05,810
No!

4593
02:42:05,890 --> 02:42:06,010
No!

4594
02:42:07,950 --> 02:42:08,910
Listen guys.

4595
02:42:09,110 --> 02:42:12,950
What have you been doing to the new- to the- our new members of our cult of religion?

4596
02:42:14,070 --> 02:42:15,590
I just- hold on.

4597
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:16,170
Listen.

4598
02:42:16,390 --> 02:42:18,550
What happened back there was a mistake.

4599
02:42:18,990 --> 02:42:19,470
Alright.

4600
02:42:19,770 --> 02:42:20,250
Listen.

4601
02:42:20,530 --> 02:42:21,650
What is these?

4602
02:42:21,650 --> 02:42:23,210
What are these that you gave us?

4603
02:42:23,630 --> 02:42:24,550
What are these?

4604
02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:26,130
That's not mine!

4605
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:26,770
That is not mine!

4606
02:42:26,770 --> 02:42:27,590
That is- that is- listen.

4607
02:42:27,790 --> 02:42:28,750
He's the shop owner.

4608
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:30,730
I had no idea he was gonna do that, okay?

4609
02:42:31,030 --> 02:42:31,070
Oh no!

4610
02:42:31,290 --> 02:42:32,870
Hey, I'm not gonna lie.

4611
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:33,770
At least it's cooked, right?

4612
02:42:33,930 --> 02:42:34,670
No, he wasn't shot at us!

4613
02:42:35,890 --> 02:42:37,130
No, I didn't.

4614
02:42:37,150 --> 02:42:39,150
That was- that was so- I didn't do anything.

4615
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:39,550
Listen.

4616
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:42,070
I just wanted to come back and apologize.

4617
02:42:42,290 --> 02:42:45,510
I had no idea he was gonna do that back there.

4618
02:42:45,970 --> 02:42:48,170
And you know, I brought some extra food, you know?

4619
02:42:48,490 --> 02:42:49,190
For the road.

4620
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:51,810
Oh my god.

4621
02:42:51,850 --> 02:42:52,110
More?

4622
02:42:52,370 --> 02:42:53,070
No way.

4623
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:55,330
What?

4624
02:42:55,890 --> 02:42:56,630
Explain yourself.

4625
02:42:56,670 --> 02:42:56,750
I'm sorry.

4626
02:42:57,470 --> 02:42:58,150
Explain yourself.

4627
02:43:02,290 --> 02:43:04,430
Oh my god, I can't believe we survived.

4628
02:43:04,870 --> 02:43:06,690
So, um, that man...

4629
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:07,430
Yeah?

4630
02:43:08,450 --> 02:43:09,590
...isn't working alone.

4631
02:43:10,250 --> 02:43:16,750
So next time you get yourself in a similar situation, it's a different person, be careful, because there's a group of them going around doing that.

4632
02:43:16,890 --> 02:43:17,410
So be careful.

4633
02:43:17,570 --> 02:43:17,590
Oh.

4634
02:43:17,710 --> 02:43:19,470
I like the way this guy talks.

4635
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:22,050
Oh my god.

4636
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:24,830
Thank you for- thank you for looking out for us.

4637
02:43:25,130 --> 02:43:25,570
What?

4638
02:43:28,230 --> 02:43:30,370
That conversation ended abruptly, but okay.

4639
02:43:32,470 --> 02:43:34,950
Okay, Camus, we need to repair our car and get the stone.

4640
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:36,730
We've been trying to get the stone for like an hour now, right?

4641
02:43:37,050 --> 02:43:38,250
Alright, we should...

4642
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:40,010
Alright, I'm gonna call it here.

4643
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:41,210
I'm gonna call it here.

4644
02:43:41,210 --> 02:43:42,550
Yeah, I do like British people.

4645
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:43,550
What?

4646
02:43:44,270 --> 02:43:46,950
Let's go back to your place, so I can like be safe.

4647
02:43:47,270 --> 02:43:48,210
You two haven't seen any kingdoms yet, have you?

4648
02:43:48,310 --> 02:43:50,990
No, we only- we only saw the- the Rusty Kingdom.

4649
02:43:51,950 --> 02:43:53,490
We haven't seen the other ones yet.

4650
02:43:54,170 --> 02:43:54,630
Oh, yeah.

4651
02:43:54,710 --> 02:43:55,550
The- the Rusty Kingdom.

4652
02:43:55,570 --> 02:43:57,390
The Rusty Kingdom, you mean.

4653
02:43:58,770 --> 02:43:59,790
The- the Rusty Kingdom, you mean.

4654
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:01,390
What is that, a card stone?

4655
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:05,820
Maybe.

4656
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:11,940
We need- we need a farm stone, but we can- we can drop you guys like kinda close if you- if you wanna go visit the- What?

4657
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:12,180
Who's that?

4658
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,020
Who's that?

4659
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:16,680
I think this is Stone- this is Stonewall.

4660
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:20,080
Come- come- come- Stone, Stone, Stone, come- come- come- wait, you met him already, no?

4661
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:22,340
Oh, yeah.

4662
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:23,940
I just couldn't see the name.

4663
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:24,680
It was too far.

4664
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:25,480
Oh, okay.

4665
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:27,200
Stonewall's currently getting his load of stone.

4666
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,560
I think we need to go to the car so we can have more bangbusters.

4667
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:29,460
Doki, say no.

4668
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:31,720
Say no when they ask everyone to go.

4669
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:32,400
I don't suppose you have to prepare stuff on this side.

4670
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:32,620
Oh, okay.

4671
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:34,520
Okay, what did it say?

4672
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:35,940
This one's Doki's car.

4673
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:37,280
We found a garage earlier.

4674
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:38,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, this one's mine.

4675
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:40,080
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

4676
02:44:40,220 --> 02:44:40,580
This is my car.

4677
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:41,160
It's a lot of gas.

4678
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:43,960
Okay, okay, nice, nice.

4679
02:44:44,060 --> 02:44:45,500
Um, I never called your name, Arie, actually.

4680
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:46,500
I only called Doki's name.

4681
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,020
I didn't catch yours.

4682
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:49,300
It's Goombie.

4683
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:51,640
Goombie, okay, okay.

4684
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:52,320
What?

4685
02:44:52,460 --> 02:44:54,140
Did the people ever call you Gummy?

4686
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:55,540
Gummy.

4687
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:56,500
Gummy.

4688
02:44:56,860 --> 02:44:57,180
Gummy.

4689
02:44:58,360 --> 02:45:01,640
I can't say you hate it.

4690
02:45:01,960 --> 02:45:02,920
That's okay, I guess.

4691
02:45:08,420 --> 02:45:09,560
Hey, that's all I need.

4692
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:10,800
That is a no.

4693
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:12,460
That is a no.

4694
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:13,380
Oh, no.

4695
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:14,980
Gummy, are you okay?

4696
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:18,160
Gummy!

4697
02:45:18,260 --> 02:45:19,920
Oh, my God, you did not just do that, right?

4698
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:23,040
No, hey, I said no.

4699
02:45:24,340 --> 02:45:25,320
Don't, don't do it, no.

4700
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:27,040
Do a flip.

4701
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:27,160
Do a flip.

4702
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:29,880
Oh, no.

4703
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:30,240
I called you.

4704
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:31,340
I called you.

4705
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:34,920
Hey, hey, hey.

4706
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:35,440
I asked.

4707
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:39,260
Doki, on the other hand, is intentionally saying it.

4708
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:41,800
Personally, personally, I wouldn't have that.

4709
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:44,180
Oh, no.

4710
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:47,840
I was just asking.

4711
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:52,900
No, no, no.

4712
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:53,300
Okay, go.

4713
02:45:53,780 --> 02:45:56,480
I don't think, Arie, I don't think she's okay, guys.

4714
02:45:58,780 --> 02:45:59,560
Come, come, come.

4715
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,220
This will cheer you up.

4716
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:00,900
Have you seen another kingdom?

4717
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:04,720
Let me repair the car and I'll take you to another kingdom.

4718
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:05,000
Yeah.

4719
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:06,840
I'll take you to another kingdom.

4720
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:07,300
I'll be surprised.

4721
02:46:07,860 --> 02:46:08,220
Wait.

4722
02:46:08,240 --> 02:46:08,820
I'll be surprised.

4723
02:46:08,940 --> 02:46:10,000
Let me repair the car.

4724
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:11,880
Can you take us to Team Rocket's kingdom?

4725
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:13,100
Are they gonna kill us?

4726
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:14,400
Are they gonna kill us?

4727
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:15,040
Oh...

4728
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:16,800
Oh, hell nah.

4729
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:18,940
I'm not gonna kill you guys.

4730
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,060
You guys don't trust me right now.

4731
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:22,180
Wait, what's wrong with Team Rocket?

4732
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:22,780
I'll tell you what.

4733
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:24,020
You guys have had a lot...

4734
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:24,540
What's this?

4735
02:46:25,140 --> 02:46:26,560
Nothing is wrong with Team Rocket.

4736
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:28,020
I've never said anything is wrong with them.

4737
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:28,460
But there's gonna be people there.

4738
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:31,620
I'm not trying to go with those hella people.

4739
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:34,860
But they're nice people, right?

4740
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:35,500
With turrets.

4741
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:38,140
Are they not nice people?

4742
02:46:38,460 --> 02:46:38,640
Yeah, but they're turrets.

4743
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:43,200
Wait, do you guys wanna use...

4744
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,440
You've had a long day.

4745
02:46:45,100 --> 02:46:46,040
Oh yeah, we had...

4746
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:47,320
Do you guys wanna use... come here, come here, come here.

4747
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:48,420
You can use the premium...

4748
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:49,640
The premium?

4749
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:52,280
Premium?

4750
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:54,200
I think Team Rocket has nice people.

4751
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:54,420
Mm-hmm.

4752
02:46:55,860 --> 02:46:57,020
Oh my god!

4753
02:46:58,020 --> 02:46:58,820
Who means...

4754
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:00,200
Who?

4755
02:47:01,460 --> 02:47:01,480
Okay.

4756
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:02,660
Let me repair the car.

4757
02:47:03,380 --> 02:47:04,340
Open the door.

4758
02:47:04,340 --> 02:47:04,920
Open the door.

4759
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:05,380
Go ahead.

4760
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:05,900
Open it.

4761
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:10,220
Oh my god.

4762
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:10,880
I'm peeing.

4763
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,600
Do you have enough toilet roll in there?

4764
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:15,560
Or should we get you some more?

4765
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:16,580
Do you have enough toilet rolls?

4766
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:17,980
Oh, I think she didn't need it.

4767
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:20,380
I didn't need it.

4768
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:21,040
Okay.

4769
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:22,560
Wait.

4770
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:26,880
What do you think this chicken's filled with?

4771
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:28,720
Cock.

4772
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:35,560
Wait, can you flush?

4773
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:43,340
Oh, Doki, look!

4774
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:43,500
What?

4775
02:47:44,060 --> 02:47:45,940
Oh my god, there's so many horses!

4776
02:47:46,060 --> 02:47:47,180
Okay, I've got stuff to repair the car.

4777
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:49,000
Do you like all our horses?

4778
02:47:49,460 --> 02:47:49,920
Oh my god!

4779
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:50,920
We're gonna use them later.

4780
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:53,080
Oh, are these the race horses for the casino?

4781
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:53,340
Wait, we have three now?

4782
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:54,200
I wanna poop in.

4783
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:55,360
Yeah, yeah.

4784
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:57,200
Look at how much poop's on the floor.

4785
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:58,560
Oh my god, so much fertilizer.

4786
02:47:58,840 --> 02:47:59,700
You can take some poop if you like.

4787
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:02,420
What are we doing to do with the poop?

4788
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:04,920
I think he wants you to eat it or something.

4789
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:05,800
Okay, go.

4790
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:09,220
Okay, let's...

4791
02:48:09,220 --> 02:48:09,880
Wait, where's the car?

4792
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:10,420
Where's the car?

4793
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:12,000
Okay, Miss, where's the car again?

4794
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:12,740
It's over here, right?

4795
02:48:12,940 --> 02:48:14,300
They're gonna give us premium car!

4796
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:16,040
Rusty Kingdom would never!

4797
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:18,520
You're right.

4798
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:19,280
They would never.

4799
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:21,500
They would never give us free premium stuff.

4800
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:22,340
Yeah.

4801
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:24,400
Well actually they kind of would.

4802
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:25,360
They tried to earlier.

4803
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:26,860
No they did.

4804
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:28,140
They put me in the torture chamber.

4805
02:48:28,840 --> 02:48:30,580
Well that was grandpa.

4806
02:48:36,850 --> 02:48:37,730
Oh my god.

4807
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:39,590
This religion is pretty nice.

4808
02:48:40,410 --> 02:48:40,850
Yeah.

4809
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:42,390
I like this religion.

4810
02:48:54,740 --> 02:48:55,940
Wait what are you doing?

4811
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:03,920
I just landed a balloon right there across the street from the casino like 10 minutes ago.

4812
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:04,540
Oh damn.

4813
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:08,100
Oh my god.

4814
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:08,660
Oh!

4815
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:09,360
Here come here!

4816
02:49:09,700 --> 02:49:10,140
Wait what?

4817
02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:12,420
You see this thing?

4818
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:14,300
What?

4819
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:17,920
I have the codes to this because it's Mr. Bo's thing.

4820
02:49:18,380 --> 02:49:19,200
Mr. Bo?

4821
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:20,820
What is this?

4822
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:23,000
Oh it's like a casino.

4823
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:23,500
It's a casino.

4824
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:27,760
It's a spa too!

4825
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:29,360
Wait did they take over it?

4826
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:30,300
Oh my god.

4827
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:31,560
Did they change the code?

4828
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:32,120
They did.

4829
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:33,800
That's it.

4830
02:49:33,940 --> 02:49:34,660
Where is it?

4831
02:49:35,540 --> 02:49:36,620
What are you gonna do?

4832
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:38,700
What are you gonna do?

4833
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:41,000
Okay.

4834
02:49:44,140 --> 02:49:45,880
You're gonna demand them to give you a code?

4835
02:49:46,860 --> 02:49:48,420
What's the code?

4836
02:49:51,220 --> 02:49:52,480
Is it even online?

4837
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:55,340
I message on Discord.

4838
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:01,680
Oh my god.

4839
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:04,500
Why would he change the code?

4840
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:08,660
I think because someone tried to run in here and steal.

4841
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:11,640
I mean it is next to the cult.

4842
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:13,940
That's true.

4843
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:16,760
It is next to the cult village so it makes sense.

4844
02:50:20,770 --> 02:50:22,690
Wait they're fixing car for us right?

4845
02:50:24,110 --> 02:50:26,210
Yeah you should ask them for gas for your car.

4846
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:28,490
Yeah but they're giving us a better car.

4847
02:50:28,830 --> 02:50:29,390
Yeah are we going?

4848
02:50:30,150 --> 02:50:30,910
Hell yeah.

4849
02:50:31,890 --> 02:50:33,250
I think they're leaving us.

4850
02:50:33,330 --> 02:50:34,410
They're literally leaving us.

4851
02:50:34,590 --> 02:50:35,030
Oh.

4852
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:36,890
Are we taking you to the...

4853
02:50:36,890 --> 02:50:37,110
I think so.

4854
02:50:37,310 --> 02:50:39,970
Okay we'll cheer you up.

4855
02:50:40,530 --> 02:50:41,010
Isn't this a two-seater?

4856
02:50:41,010 --> 02:50:41,590
No no no no.

4857
02:50:41,590 --> 02:50:42,170
Hold on watch this.

4858
02:50:42,590 --> 02:50:43,070
Wait.

4859
02:50:43,090 --> 02:50:43,410
Boom.

4860
02:50:44,110 --> 02:50:45,170
Get in again.

4861
02:50:46,430 --> 02:50:46,910
Whoa!

4862
02:50:48,230 --> 02:50:50,170
I feel so safe in those now.

4863
02:50:50,390 --> 02:50:52,490
I'm gonna get a snack real quick.

4864
02:50:53,650 --> 02:50:54,610
Okay get...

4865
02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:55,590
Okay enjoy your food.

4866
02:50:55,710 --> 02:51:00,650
So you have the option if you flex your E muscle you can open and close your windows.

4867
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:00,890
Oh.

4868
02:51:00,890 --> 02:51:03,530
You might be going through some dangerous places.

4869
02:51:05,050 --> 02:51:05,990
Yeah it's locked.

4870
02:51:06,570 --> 02:51:07,570
Oh wait hold on.

4871
02:51:08,330 --> 02:51:10,770
Oh wait oh get out of the way let me open them for you.

4872
02:51:10,970 --> 02:51:11,190
Alright.

4873
02:51:12,310 --> 02:51:13,530
Okay there you go.

4874
02:51:15,330 --> 02:51:18,090
Sorry the children's lock was on.

4875
02:51:18,530 --> 02:51:18,910
Yay!

4876
02:51:19,530 --> 02:51:20,010
What?

4877
02:51:21,010 --> 02:51:21,890
I'm 25.

4878
02:51:23,290 --> 02:51:24,630
Where did you...

4879
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:26,170
Oh that still makes me feel old.

4880
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:29,730
You said you wanted to go to Team Rocket right?

4881
02:51:30,030 --> 02:51:30,870
Yeah Team Rocket.

4882
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:33,750
I like Pokemon.

4883
02:51:34,370 --> 02:51:35,490
Okay I'm going to Team Rocket.

4884
02:51:35,570 --> 02:51:37,290
Can I close my window please?

4885
02:51:37,550 --> 02:51:39,290
Can I keep my window open?

4886
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:39,770
Sure.

4887
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:43,110
You have to get out after...

4888
02:51:43,110 --> 02:51:43,890
I'll just look out her window.

4889
02:51:44,830 --> 02:51:45,630
Okay okay.

4890
02:51:45,810 --> 02:51:46,670
We'll be fine.

4891
02:51:47,070 --> 02:51:48,590
We'll be fine Gumi.

4892
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:52,090
Yeah you'll be fine.

4893
02:51:52,090 --> 02:51:52,970
I'll look out your window.

4894
02:51:53,210 --> 02:51:54,590
Yeah I feel so safe.

4895
02:51:54,910 --> 02:51:55,770
Yep yep yep yep.

4896
02:51:56,930 --> 02:51:59,790
Okay so since you guys are already excited bye.

4897
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:00,370
Yeah.

4898
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:00,850
Bye.

4899
02:52:00,870 --> 02:52:02,650
We should do something.

4900
02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:05,610
We should sing a car song.

4901
02:52:05,910 --> 02:52:07,110
A car song?

4902
02:52:07,610 --> 02:52:08,730
Like what?

4903
02:52:09,110 --> 02:52:17,290
Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light.

4904
02:52:17,630 --> 02:52:27,490
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.

4905
02:52:27,610 --> 02:52:29,910
The star so bright in the night.

4906
02:52:29,910 --> 02:52:32,270
That it was so bright.

4907
02:52:32,270 --> 02:52:32,610
The moon so bright.

4908
02:52:33,230 --> 02:52:39,530
Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light.

4909
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:44,630
Beautiful!

4910
02:52:45,350 --> 02:52:46,330
That was beautiful!

4911
02:52:46,330 --> 02:52:48,050
Sorry that was a bit bumpy wasn't it?

4912
02:52:49,330 --> 02:52:50,590
Yeah it was.

4913
02:52:51,510 --> 02:52:53,750
That was so good holy...

4914
02:52:53,750 --> 02:52:54,710
Okay Dokie's turn.

4915
02:52:55,010 --> 02:52:55,890
No no no.

4916
02:52:56,410 --> 02:52:58,090
Oh my god what food have you got?

4917
02:52:58,310 --> 02:52:59,050
I feel like...

4918
02:52:59,050 --> 02:53:01,390
I feel like the host should sing for us.

4919
02:53:01,390 --> 02:53:04,610
It's the last last night of your life.

4920
02:53:08,870 --> 02:53:10,310
Baby tonight...

4921
02:53:11,370 --> 02:53:14,910
The creeper's gonna steal all our stuff again.

4922
02:53:20,210 --> 02:53:21,430
Where were you?

4923
02:53:21,630 --> 02:53:23,290
Wait why did we stop?

4924
02:53:24,470 --> 02:53:27,370
I throw my pickup in the air sometimes.

4925
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:30,150
I had to pick something.

4926
02:53:30,150 --> 02:53:32,150
Creeper let's go.

4927
02:53:36,150 --> 02:53:37,790
Okay how about this one.

4928
02:53:37,890 --> 02:53:39,270
I've got a really good car song.

4929
02:53:39,490 --> 02:53:40,030
Yeah yeah.

4930
02:53:42,350 --> 02:53:46,330
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?

4931
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:50,930
That's where you guys come in.

4932
02:53:51,470 --> 02:53:54,490
Wait what's that song?

4933
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:55,310
Who's that by?

4934
02:53:58,370 --> 02:53:59,390
It's by...

4935
02:54:00,150 --> 02:54:02,350

Glee was my childhood.

When I was your age I loved... I watched Glee.

4969
02:55:06,850 --> 02:55:07,990
Oh my god.

4970
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:11,450
I remember seeing Glee on YouTube.

4971
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:13,810
Hi Billy.

4972
02:55:14,550 --> 02:55:15,610
Hey Billy.

4973
02:55:17,130 --> 02:55:18,330
Question for you.

4974
02:55:19,090 --> 02:55:21,490
Do you know what Glee is?

4975
02:55:24,230 --> 02:55:27,350
You talking about the show with the high school kid that sing the song?

4976
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:29,130
Yeah!

4977
02:55:29,670 --> 02:55:30,150
Yeah.

4978
02:55:30,290 --> 02:55:32,650
Can you tell... Can you tell Kameis what it is?

4979
02:55:32,830 --> 02:55:33,930
Kameis doesn't know what it is.

4980
02:55:33,970 --> 02:55:34,650
We're trying to explain it.

4981
02:55:35,530 --> 02:55:38,490
Oh it like a... It like a...

4982
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:42,690
Like a high school club for... for... for...

4983
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:46,970
theater kids and young homosexuals.

4984
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:49,130
And they sing songs together.

4985
02:55:49,250 --> 02:55:50,770
They do like theme songs.

4986
02:55:50,870 --> 02:55:52,050
They call it Glee Club.

4987
02:55:53,810 --> 02:55:54,710
That's pretty accurate.

4988
02:55:58,010 --> 02:55:59,350
No no no no.

4989
02:55:59,370 --> 02:56:02,070
They theater kids and homosexuals.

4990
02:56:02,070 --> 02:56:03,090
They can be both.

4991
02:56:05,830 --> 02:56:08,770
Some of the theater kids will also be homosexuals.

4992
02:56:08,770 --> 02:56:10,610
Yeah and some of them were straight.

4993
02:56:11,430 --> 02:56:13,710
Baby Billy like Glee a lot.

4994
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:15,170

Don't Stop Believin' Hopped on this open-ended ceiling and Oh wow.

It's okay, she's into it.

5120
03:00:12,590 --> 03:00:14,830
She's just getting scraps.

5121
03:00:14,830 --> 03:00:20,190
I need her to swear an oath that she won't tell anyone the secret, that's why.

5122
03:00:22,650 --> 03:00:25,010
But Stonewall just came by and he heard it!

5123
03:00:25,170 --> 03:00:26,350
No, he just heard the secret!

5124
03:00:27,830 --> 03:00:28,830
Okay, what's the secret?

5125
03:00:29,030 --> 03:00:30,010
Quick, blood pack, go!

5126
03:00:30,110 --> 03:00:30,510
Yeah!

5127
03:00:33,390 --> 03:00:37,810
Okay, so... Skibbity Toilet... That's all your blood on the floor, okay?

5128
03:00:38,710 --> 03:00:44,410
Skibbity Toilet is going to release merchandise at Christmas time.

5129
03:00:45,230 --> 03:00:45,710
What?

5130
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:46,270
What?

5131
03:00:47,550 --> 03:00:49,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you didn't... but that's the secret.

5132
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:51,270
Okay, but yeah.

5133
03:00:51,730 --> 03:00:52,470
Then game?

5134
03:00:52,690 --> 03:00:53,630
You're gonna be able to buy it.

5135
03:00:53,950 --> 03:00:54,730
Wait, do you...

5136
03:00:54,730 --> 03:01:03,710
And... and... in... in the church though, you will get early access to get it if you're a member of the cult...

5137
03:01:03,710 --> 03:01:03,850
Really?

5138
03:01:03,850 --> 03:01:04,290
The church.

5139
03:01:04,590 --> 03:01:05,210
The church.

5140
03:01:05,490 --> 03:01:05,830
Yeah.

5141
03:01:05,890 --> 03:01:06,930
You work for Skibbity?

5142
03:01:07,050 --> 03:01:08,630
No, that's the secret.

5143
03:01:09,310 --> 03:01:11,070
Oh my god, we're gonna get...

5144
03:01:11,070 --> 03:01:12,190
Top secret.

5145
03:01:12,430 --> 03:01:13,330
Do we get free merch?

5146
03:01:13,330 --> 03:01:17,650
But... but... why doesn't anyone else know that they're part of the church too?

5147
03:01:19,010 --> 03:01:26,070
Because I... this is... this is... I'm cutting a deal to make it exclusive to the church early at some point.

5148
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:26,810
This is a super busy ass room.

5149
03:01:27,410 --> 03:01:30,410
Yeah, this is the worst place to tell a secret.

5150
03:01:30,410 --> 03:01:33,290
Yeah, I was gonna say this is the worst place to tell a secret.

5151
03:01:33,390 --> 03:01:34,410
We could get run over.

5152
03:01:35,650 --> 03:01:37,030
Okay, but shh... okay.

5153
03:01:37,350 --> 03:01:38,310
Okay, shh... okay.

5154
03:01:38,410 --> 03:01:39,490
Okay, let's go to the...

5155
03:01:39,490 --> 03:01:40,670
Can we meet Mr. Skibbity?

5156
03:01:40,810 --> 03:01:41,810
Let's go... um...

5157
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:42,350
We're going to...

5158
03:01:43,330 --> 03:01:45,350
We're going to the Team Rocket.

5159
03:01:45,670 --> 03:01:45,990
We're going to the Team Rocket.

5160
03:01:47,210 --> 03:01:48,830
Guys, chat, don't leak, guys.

5161
03:01:48,970 --> 03:01:49,950
We made a blood pack.

5162
03:01:50,110 --> 03:01:50,570
Don't leak.

5163
03:01:50,650 --> 03:01:54,370
We can go to Team Rocket, but you're gonna die if you try to go in because they have auto turrets.

5164
03:01:56,170 --> 03:01:57,830
No, Doki said she'll stop them.

5165
03:01:57,830 --> 03:01:58,150
Oh, damn.

5166
03:01:58,870 --> 03:02:01,170
Yeah, yeah, I know one of the people there.

5167
03:02:01,530 --> 03:02:01,630
I'm the people here.

5168
03:02:02,330 --> 03:02:04,010
Doki, contact Mendo immediately.

5169
03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:04,710
Oh, yeah.

5170
03:02:04,710 --> 03:02:04,950
I'm the people here.

5171
03:02:05,510 --> 03:02:06,030
I'm the people here.

5172
03:02:06,330 --> 03:02:07,410
I'm the people here.

5173
03:02:07,650 --> 03:02:09,670
I'm the people here.

5174
03:02:10,410 --> 03:02:10,970
I'm the people here.

5175
03:02:11,350 --> 03:02:11,670
I'm the people here.

5176
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:14,350
Best I'm DMing Mendo right now.

5177
03:02:14,610 --> 03:02:15,850
There's another horsey there.

5178
03:02:15,890 --> 03:02:16,590
There's a horse there.

5179
03:02:20,350 --> 03:02:23,290
Mendo, we are heading to Team Rocket.

5180
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:26,730
Do not kill us, please.

5181
03:02:29,050 --> 03:02:33,450
Okay, I messaged... I messaged Mendo.

5182
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:34,810
Nice.

5183
03:02:35,150 --> 03:02:37,210
I don't know if he saw the DM.

5184
03:02:38,390 --> 03:02:40,410
Am I driving on the right side of the road, guys?

5185
03:02:40,510 --> 03:02:41,030
Yeah.

5186
03:02:41,030 --> 03:02:41,930
I don't have a license.

5187
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:44,350
Oh, wait, you don't have a license?

5188
03:02:47,190 --> 03:02:48,270
But I thought you're old!

5189
03:02:48,730 --> 03:02:49,250
No, not here.

5190
03:02:49,470 --> 03:02:50,250
I only have...

5191
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:54,250
Being old doesn't make you smart.

5192
03:02:55,290 --> 03:02:56,810
Oh, it doesn't?

5193
03:02:57,050 --> 03:02:58,010
We're here, Doki.

5194
03:02:58,350 --> 03:02:59,490
Wait, is this Team Rocket?

5195
03:02:59,830 --> 03:03:00,090
No.

5196
03:03:01,950 --> 03:03:03,630
This is... this...

5197
03:03:05,330 --> 03:03:07,210
Welcome to Team Rocket.

5198
03:03:08,190 --> 03:03:09,150
It was a tour!

5199
03:03:09,730 --> 03:03:10,710
It was a tour!

5200
03:03:10,990 --> 03:03:11,850
I've never been here.

5201
03:03:12,430 --> 03:03:15,190
Well, the turrets are coming up in a second.

5202
03:03:15,870 --> 03:03:16,210
Well, the turrets are coming up in a second.

5203
03:03:16,210 --> 03:03:16,230
Oh.

5204
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:18,590
You don't have to be scared of them.

5205
03:03:18,730 --> 03:03:19,990
This car has windows.

5206
03:03:21,770 --> 03:03:23,710
Windows in the back, but not in the front.

5207
03:03:23,910 --> 03:03:27,350
Oh, why are you walking away?

5208
03:03:27,670 --> 03:03:27,990
Oh, why are you walking away?

5209
03:03:27,990 --> 03:03:29,850
Why are you walking away?

5210
03:03:32,830 --> 03:03:34,610
Why did you both walk away?

5211
03:03:34,870 --> 03:03:36,490
Yeah, I thought we...

5212
03:03:36,490 --> 03:03:36,790
Hello?

5213
03:03:37,210 --> 03:03:37,670
There's a turret.

5214
03:03:40,010 --> 03:03:40,430
Hello?

5215
03:03:43,710 --> 03:03:45,050
We've come to visit.

5216
03:03:45,150 --> 03:03:45,350
Wait.

5217
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:48,090
But we're kind of scared because there's turrets everywhere.

5218
03:03:49,390 --> 03:03:49,990
Yeah, me too.

5219
03:03:49,990 --> 03:03:51,270
The turret is currently off.

5220
03:03:51,290 --> 03:03:51,710
You're chilling.

5221
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:52,530
Wait, really?

5222
03:03:52,990 --> 03:03:53,410
Ready?

5223
03:03:53,830 --> 03:03:55,090
Hi, Gumi!

5224
03:03:57,350 --> 03:03:58,050
Are you sure?

5225
03:03:58,170 --> 03:03:59,930
You would never lie to Gumi, right?

5226
03:03:59,930 --> 03:04:00,670
How do I look?

5227
03:04:03,790 --> 03:04:05,190
Yeah, I would never lie to Gumi.

5228
03:04:05,370 --> 03:04:05,870
Yeah, see?

5229
03:04:06,390 --> 03:04:07,190
We're safe, guys.

5230
03:04:07,210 --> 03:04:08,150
Gumi, I told you.

5231
03:04:09,910 --> 03:04:10,670
Okay, let's...

5232
03:04:10,670 --> 03:04:13,990
Okay, but we do have some crazy people on our island, though.

5233
03:04:14,110 --> 03:04:14,930
So, yeah.

5234
03:04:15,350 --> 03:04:16,970
You gotta be on the lookout for them.

5235
03:04:17,190 --> 03:04:17,590
But...

5236
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:18,690
Oh, no.

5237
03:04:20,830 --> 03:04:21,510
Oh, my God.

5238
03:04:21,630 --> 03:04:22,810
You can escort us, right?

5239
03:04:23,610 --> 03:04:25,730
Yeah, you wouldn't let us get killed, right, Ray?

5240
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:29,050
Yeah, you wouldn't do that.

5241
03:04:29,370 --> 03:04:29,770
Yeah.

5242
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:31,270
Yeah.

5243
03:04:31,790 --> 03:04:32,390
Uh-huh.

5244
03:04:33,290 --> 03:04:34,010
Yeah, see?

5245
03:04:34,150 --> 03:04:34,970
They said yes.

5246
03:04:34,970 --> 03:04:36,510
I'm convinced.

5247
03:04:38,410 --> 03:04:39,170
Yeah, you look...

5248
03:04:39,170 --> 03:04:40,870
You look super cool.

5249
03:04:41,130 --> 03:04:42,030
He hesitated.

5250
03:04:42,170 --> 03:04:43,050
He doesn't think so.

5251
03:04:44,550 --> 03:04:45,370
I know he did.

5252
03:04:45,470 --> 03:04:45,890
I know he did.

5253
03:04:46,310 --> 03:04:46,710
I know he did.

5254
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:52,080
I thought you brought...

5255
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:55,540
I thought you brought Jen in for a second.

5256
03:04:55,600 --> 03:04:55,740
I thought you brought Jen in for a second.

5257
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:57,300
And I was about to have to go get my gun.

5258
03:04:58,460 --> 03:04:59,160
Oh, no.

5259
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:02,460
We're not even gonna kill people here.

5260
03:05:02,480 --> 03:05:02,740
Don't worry.

5261
03:05:03,060 --> 03:05:03,300
We're not even gonna kill people here.

5262
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:03,300
Don't worry.

5263
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:04,000
We're telling a story.

5264
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:06,280
We're giving some visitors.

5265
03:05:07,240 --> 03:05:08,140
I like your...

5266
03:05:08,140 --> 03:05:09,480
Okay, never mind.

5267
03:05:09,500 --> 03:05:10,440
I get what you guys are saying.

5268
03:05:10,480 --> 03:05:11,940
Who are these guys?

5269
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:16,480
Hey, we're visiting.

5270
03:05:16,860 --> 03:05:17,840
It's my first day.

5271
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:18,560
Call me, bro.

5272
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:20,400
I understand.

5273
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:20,900
I understand.

5274
03:05:21,020 --> 03:05:22,480
You guys are just re-saying the story.

5275
03:05:22,780 --> 03:05:26,120
I can't trust anyone right now.

5276
03:05:27,480 --> 03:05:29,140
You've lied to me before.

5277
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:29,920
That's your fault.

5278
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:32,760
You lied to me before.

5279
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:34,280
I'm telling you.

5280
03:05:34,680 --> 03:05:35,120
Whoa.

5281
03:05:36,680 --> 03:05:37,120
Bye.

5282
03:05:39,620 --> 03:05:40,180
Bye, guys.

5283
03:05:40,760 --> 03:05:41,120
Bye.

5284
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,180
I am sick.

5285
03:05:43,320 --> 03:05:44,240
This is gonna be fun.

5286
03:05:44,240 --> 03:05:45,160
We're going shopping.

5287
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:47,360
Whoa, did you guys build this?

5288
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:51,060
No, you find it.

5289
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:52,820
We're going shopping.

5290
03:05:53,880 --> 03:05:54,320
Shopping?

5291
03:05:54,820 --> 03:05:55,780
Oh, my God, Gumi.

5292
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:56,480
We're gonna go shopping.

5293
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:00,160
Don't push this button.

5294
03:06:00,220 --> 03:06:01,000
I'm in charge of this button.

5295
03:06:01,180 --> 03:06:02,700
Yeah, I won't push it.

5296
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:05,200
Wait.

5297
03:06:07,260 --> 03:06:10,040
Are there any, like, safety areas here?

5298
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:13,520
I don't feel so safe up here.

5299
03:06:13,680 --> 03:06:14,480
Yeah, the casino.

5300
03:06:14,780 --> 03:06:15,500
How do you fly this?

5301
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:22,680
I think it's from that button.

5302
03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:24,180
I don't know how to go.

5303
03:06:25,080 --> 03:06:26,760
It's just one button, though.

5304
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:29,400
Sorry, I have to count, so I go quiet.

5305
03:06:30,160 --> 03:06:32,380
Sorry, I have to count, so I go quiet.

5306
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:35,300
Why do you have to count?

5307
03:06:38,020 --> 03:06:39,100
Oh, is it because of the...

5308
03:06:39,100 --> 03:06:40,000
It takes a lot of concentration.

5309
03:06:40,580 --> 03:06:41,960
Oh, it's for the hot air balloon.

5310
03:06:42,100 --> 03:06:43,020
You gotta time it perfectly.

5311
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:43,620
I see.

5312
03:06:45,380 --> 03:06:46,840
So there is...

5313
03:06:46,840 --> 03:06:47,240
Do you actually understand?

5314
03:06:47,980 --> 03:06:51,140
I think we might die if she starts getting distracted.

5315
03:06:53,300 --> 03:06:53,700
I think we might die if she starts getting distracted.

5316
03:06:54,060 --> 03:06:56,360
I think we have to keep our conversation to ourselves.

5317
03:06:56,640 --> 03:06:56,880
Yeah.

5318
03:06:57,300 --> 03:06:58,680
Do you know how to fly this, Ducky?

5319
03:06:58,860 --> 03:06:59,220
No.

5320
03:06:59,500 --> 03:07:01,920
Or were you just saying, I see, as in you understood?

5321
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:04,940
I just said, I see, because I thought I understood.

5322
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:06,460
I just said, I see, because I thought I understood.

5323
03:07:06,820 --> 03:07:10,980
If we steal the fuel storage right now, we could kill her.

5324
03:07:11,140 --> 03:07:11,160
If we steal the fuel storage right now, we could kill her.

5325
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:12,320
And us.

5326
03:07:12,420 --> 03:07:13,340
That would kill all of us.

5327
03:07:18,960 --> 03:07:21,080
But it would be pretty funny.

5328
03:07:22,300 --> 03:07:22,780
Yeah.

5329
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:27,700
It would be.

5330
03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:29,120
Yeah.

5331
03:07:29,540 --> 03:07:31,220
I mean, what happens if I...

5332
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:34,780
Oh, there's like 38 fuel in there.

5333
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:36,960
What if I take like 10?

5334
03:07:37,720 --> 03:07:38,080
Yeah.

5335
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:40,840
And then you bring it back to your car that we left at home.

5336
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:42,060
Yeah.

5337
03:07:42,060 --> 03:07:42,220
Yeah.

5338
03:07:44,640 --> 03:07:46,380
Okay, I'll take 10 and you take 10.

5339
03:07:47,340 --> 03:07:48,200
I don't want it.

5340
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:49,140
I don't even have space.

5341
03:07:51,500 --> 03:07:53,400
Do you think I'll notice if I take some?

5342
03:07:54,300 --> 03:07:56,240
I don't know, but we're about to hit the ground, I think.

5343
03:07:56,340 --> 03:07:56,860
Oh, okay.

5344
03:07:57,280 --> 03:07:58,680
See, we didn't steal anything.

5345
03:07:58,880 --> 03:07:59,660
Wait, we're back here.

5346
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:01,520
This is the spawn, isn't it?

5347
03:08:02,100 --> 03:08:03,820
I think this is where we're supposed to be.

5348
03:08:04,060 --> 03:08:05,120
But I have to go ask.

5349
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:06,400
Oh, wait, just kidding.

5350
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:08,380
I'm in the wrong thing.

5351
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:09,320
I'm supposed to be in J16.

5352
03:08:09,500 --> 03:08:09,820
I lied.

5353
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:10,920
Okay, we're going back up.

5354
03:08:11,320 --> 03:08:12,220
Unless you guys need off.

5355
03:08:12,380 --> 03:08:12,760
Do you need off?

5356
03:08:13,100 --> 03:08:14,420
No, we'll head over.

5357
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:17,680
Okay, let's go.

5358
03:08:18,260 --> 03:08:18,580
Yay!

5359
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:19,120
Wait, J16?

5360
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:20,220
That's near my home.

5361
03:08:20,460 --> 03:08:21,820
Wait, yeah, that is near your place.

5362
03:08:24,560 --> 03:08:25,040
That's good.

5363
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:26,680
We get to go back to your place.

5364
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:27,040
Wait, whose place?

5365
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:27,620
Where are you going?

5366
03:08:27,620 --> 03:08:28,060
Oh!

5367
03:08:29,100 --> 03:08:30,760
J16 is near Gumi's place.

5368
03:08:31,120 --> 03:08:32,000
That's her house.

5369
03:08:34,320 --> 03:08:35,380
Where do you live?

5370
03:08:35,980 --> 03:08:37,040
Yeah, Gumi, where do you live?

5371
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:38,380
I don't have a home.

5372
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:40,000
I live between three places...

5373
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:41,140
Four places now.

5374
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:42,640
Yeah, she's a nomad.

5375
03:08:43,820 --> 03:08:45,460
We just recently joined a cult.

5376
03:08:45,860 --> 03:08:47,660
For a home and food.

5377
03:08:47,920 --> 03:08:49,300
Do you guys have any guns on you?

5378
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:50,820
If you have guns on you, put them away.

5379
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:51,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5380
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:52,880
I put mine away.

5381
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:55,720
Okay, put them away.

5382
03:08:55,720 --> 03:08:56,760
Cause there's this plane coming.

5383
03:08:56,820 --> 03:08:57,380
It'll shoot us.

5384
03:08:57,460 --> 03:08:57,820
Okay.

5385
03:08:58,080 --> 03:08:58,940
Yeah, it's away.

5386
03:09:02,510 --> 03:09:03,010
Oh.

5387
03:09:03,590 --> 03:09:04,610
We can call it.

5388
03:09:05,110 --> 03:09:09,010
After... I like how we went to Team Rocket and just instantly left.

5389
03:09:09,590 --> 03:09:10,090
Yeah.

5390
03:09:15,110 --> 03:09:18,690
After meeting a people, we just instantly left.

5391
03:09:19,150 --> 03:09:21,210
We just got in, man.

5392
03:09:21,290 --> 03:09:23,010
And then we're on a trip now.

5393
03:09:23,050 --> 03:09:24,670
We're like, woo, hot air balloon!

5394
03:09:25,030 --> 03:09:26,930
And then we just left.

5395
03:09:28,050 --> 03:09:29,810
Maybe we should've just gone back.

5396
03:09:29,950 --> 03:09:31,170
We had the chance to.

5397
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:32,050
Yeah.

5398
03:09:33,450 --> 03:09:35,330
I mean, we... they weren't hostile.

5399
03:09:35,930 --> 03:09:38,630
We left... yeah, we left the two guys behind.

5400
03:09:39,750 --> 03:09:41,350
Well, they were kind of freaks.

5401
03:09:41,470 --> 03:09:41,850
They were.

5402
03:09:41,990 --> 03:09:43,390
I mean, we're in the cult.

5403
03:09:43,670 --> 03:09:44,750
Everybody's a freak in there.

5404
03:09:45,030 --> 03:09:46,750
We literally met cannibals.

5405
03:09:47,810 --> 03:09:48,630
What the heck?

5406
03:09:48,650 --> 03:09:50,790
You made us do a blood pack out of nowhere, man.

5407
03:09:50,890 --> 03:09:52,470
Yeah, and talked about skibbity toilet.

5408
03:09:53,110 --> 03:09:55,630
That man must be like in his 50s or something.

5409
03:09:55,750 --> 03:09:56,630
Cause he felt old.

5410
03:09:57,990 --> 03:09:59,310
He tried to be cool.

5411
03:09:59,350 --> 03:10:00,410
He tried to like talk...

5412
03:10:00,410 --> 03:10:03,050
You know like that meme where he's like, howdy fellow kids?

5413
03:10:03,550 --> 03:10:04,550
Hey kids!

5414
03:10:04,770 --> 03:10:05,230
Yeah!

5415
03:10:05,530 --> 03:10:07,390
So how's the skibbity toilet?

5416
03:10:07,730 --> 03:10:09,200
He's like, how's the skibbity toilet?

5417
03:10:10,550 --> 03:10:10,670
Yeah!

5418
03:10:18,130 --> 03:10:19,050
So scary.

5419
03:10:19,530 --> 03:10:21,610
I wonder if you can push somebody out accidentally.

5420
03:10:22,550 --> 03:10:24,010
Yeah, why don't you stand in front?

5421
03:10:26,490 --> 03:10:26,950
Yeah?

5422
03:10:26,950 --> 03:10:29,310
Yeah, yeah, go, go.

5423
03:10:29,390 --> 03:10:29,590
Yeah?

5424
03:10:33,110 --> 03:10:34,670
Why are you backing up?

5425
03:10:34,770 --> 03:10:35,450
Why are you backing up?

5426
03:10:35,450 --> 03:10:36,510
I felt that push!

5427
03:10:37,830 --> 03:10:38,810
I felt it.

5428
03:10:38,870 --> 03:10:40,610
Sorry, I got excited.

5429
03:10:41,110 --> 03:10:42,350
Wait, we're running out of fuel.

5430
03:10:42,630 --> 03:10:44,310
We've run from 32 to 16.

5431
03:10:47,270 --> 03:10:48,770
And I didn't take any fuel.

5432
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:53,580
I'm a little scared.

5433
03:10:54,080 --> 03:10:55,200
Are we gonna make it?

5434
03:10:55,780 --> 03:10:57,040
Yeah, we'll make it.

5435
03:10:57,600 --> 03:10:59,020
Where are we right now?

5436
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:01,020
We're heading to what?

5437
03:11:01,500 --> 03:11:01,980
J16?

5438
03:11:03,260 --> 03:11:03,740
Yeah.

5439
03:11:04,280 --> 03:11:05,180
Holy shit.

5440
03:11:05,540 --> 03:11:06,020
Oh.

5441
03:11:06,820 --> 03:11:07,300
Oh!

5442
03:11:07,380 --> 03:11:07,460
Oh!

5443
03:11:08,040 --> 03:11:09,220
Someone's shooting at us.

5444
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:10,480
Yeah, somebody shot at us.

5445
03:11:11,620 --> 03:11:13,200
I think I know who shot at us.

5446
03:11:13,280 --> 03:11:13,420
Who?

5447
03:11:14,820 --> 03:11:15,560
It's Ryan.

5448
03:11:16,580 --> 03:11:17,060
Oh!

5449
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:19,640
Oh!

5450
03:11:22,060 --> 03:11:23,300
Why are they shooting us?

5451
03:11:23,420 --> 03:11:24,120
I thought we're friendly.

5452
03:11:25,640 --> 03:11:26,300
They're mean.

5453
03:11:26,940 --> 03:11:28,340
Wait, who are they down there?

5454
03:11:28,460 --> 03:11:29,820
Who is the people shooting at us?

5455
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:30,740
Dude, that's Ryan.

5456
03:11:30,860 --> 03:11:31,700
Ryan was shooting.

5457
03:11:31,940 --> 03:11:32,660
I have no clue.

5458
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:34,220
They might be trying to get something.

5459
03:11:35,200 --> 03:11:35,640
Ryan?

5460
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:36,380
Ryan Higa?

5461
03:11:36,620 --> 03:11:39,360
Yeah, that was Mr. Pickles, Ryan Higa.

5462
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:42,340
Why the fuck is Ryan Higa shooting at us?

5463
03:11:42,740 --> 03:11:46,140
Well, it's common to shoot at any air balloon because they could be enemies.

5464
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:46,840
Well, it's common to shoot at any air balloon because they could be enemies.

5465
03:11:46,840 --> 03:11:48,600
Oh, I see.

5466
03:11:50,320 --> 03:11:51,020
Yeah, guys.

5467
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:52,020
It's the Ryan Higa.

5468
03:11:53,200 --> 03:11:54,400
Yeah, he's my teammate.

5469
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:55,360
Yeah.

5470
03:11:55,640 --> 03:11:58,420
Is he a nice person?

5471
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:00,540
He's the one that showed up when you were in front of our house.

5472
03:12:00,940 --> 03:12:01,840
That was him?

5473
03:12:02,300 --> 03:12:08,000
Oh, he was the one that saw me almost breaking in and then he gave me money!

5474
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:13,840
Oh my god, I got scratched from the Ryan Higa.

5475
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:15,480
Okay.

5476
03:12:22,140 --> 03:12:23,600
I didn't even realize that was him.

5477
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:24,780
Yeah.

5478
03:12:31,770 --> 03:12:32,210
Woo!

5479
03:12:32,410 --> 03:12:33,770
Thank you for the ride!

5480
03:12:34,830 --> 03:12:35,630
Thank you!

5481
03:12:38,730 --> 03:12:40,030
Great stuff, everybody.

5482
03:12:40,150 --> 03:12:40,550
Good work.

5483
03:12:42,150 --> 03:12:42,590
Yup.

5484
03:12:42,650 --> 03:12:43,810
Yeah, I was there!

5485
03:12:45,630 --> 03:12:46,550
Wait, where are we going?

5486
03:12:46,770 --> 03:12:47,790
Let's go back to your house.

5487
03:12:50,790 --> 03:12:51,870
Okay, I have to go...

5488
03:12:51,870 --> 03:12:53,590
You have to go pick up my car.

5489
03:12:54,070 --> 03:12:55,050
Where was your car?

5490
03:12:55,670 --> 03:12:57,330
We left it back at the church.

5491
03:12:59,110 --> 03:13:00,570
We need to find a horse.

5492
03:13:00,790 --> 03:13:01,890
Oh, yeah?

5493
03:13:01,930 --> 03:13:03,590
If we see a horse, we fucking steal that shit.

5494
03:13:08,170 --> 03:13:09,350
Who's that over there?

5495
03:13:09,770 --> 03:13:10,490
My bad.

5496
03:13:11,190 --> 03:13:11,630
Whoa.

5497
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:14,370
Did we just come over the door?

5498
03:13:14,550 --> 03:13:14,990
Hello!

5499
03:13:16,670 --> 03:13:17,110
Welcome!

5500
03:13:18,130 --> 03:13:20,210
Hey guys, are you guys also a club?

5501
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:23,310
Can I get a chicken soup?

5502
03:13:23,950 --> 03:13:24,390
Hello!

5503
03:13:25,050 --> 03:13:25,730
Can I get a chicken soup?

5504
03:13:25,970 --> 03:13:27,670
I'm gonna ask for this to be made.

5505
03:13:28,830 --> 03:13:30,570
Look, look, look, look at the hat!

5506
03:13:30,770 --> 03:13:30,950
Oh!

5507
03:13:32,650 --> 03:13:33,730
The boonie hat?

5508
03:13:33,970 --> 03:13:34,570
What is it?

5509
03:13:34,930 --> 03:13:35,450
Take the hat.

5510
03:13:36,270 --> 03:13:37,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5511
03:13:37,970 --> 03:13:38,810
It's beautiful.

5512
03:13:39,350 --> 03:13:41,230
Wait, why are we... where are we getting shot at?

5513
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:43,090
Imagine if you could wear that...

5514
03:13:43,090 --> 03:13:43,670
He's stuck.

5515
03:13:44,650 --> 03:13:47,250
It would... nobody would shoot at you.

5516
03:13:47,330 --> 03:13:48,170
Only that thing.

5517
03:13:49,710 --> 03:13:50,510
No, it's not...

5518
03:13:50,990 --> 03:13:53,270
If you have not shot, you'll be fine.

5519
03:13:53,270 --> 03:13:54,850
I put a box there for you to jump on.

5520
03:13:55,050 --> 03:13:56,250
Here, here, take a hat.

5521
03:13:56,270 --> 03:13:58,070
Please take a souvenir.

5522
03:13:59,130 --> 03:14:00,070
Thank you.

5523
03:14:00,230 --> 03:14:00,750
Nice.

5524
03:14:02,350 --> 03:14:03,430
Oh, that's nice.

5525
03:14:04,950 --> 03:14:06,530
What do I do with this hat?

5526
03:14:09,470 --> 03:14:10,310
Put it on.

5527
03:14:10,610 --> 03:14:11,390
Put it on.

5528
03:14:11,390 --> 03:14:11,670
Hi cutie!

5529
03:14:11,850 --> 03:14:12,650
Where's Spinky?

5530
03:14:14,570 --> 03:14:15,090
Hi.

5531
03:14:15,450 --> 03:14:15,970
Wow.

5532
03:14:18,330 --> 03:14:20,030
I'm supposed to bring him a present.

5533
03:14:20,270 --> 03:14:21,850
I'm supposed to bring him a present.

5534
03:14:23,750 --> 03:14:24,730
Spinky, can you come?

5535
03:14:25,050 --> 03:14:25,530
Goomy?

5536
03:14:25,970 --> 03:14:26,690
Where's Goomy?

5537
03:14:26,790 --> 03:14:27,410
Where did Goomy go?

5538
03:14:27,570 --> 03:14:27,830
Nice.

5539
03:14:29,370 --> 03:14:30,570
Okay, I'm coming.

5540
03:14:30,730 --> 03:14:31,350
Wow, thank you!

5541
03:14:34,690 --> 03:14:35,170
Yeah.

5542
03:14:35,810 --> 03:14:36,290
Perfect.

5543
03:14:36,370 --> 03:14:37,770
You fit perfectly in.

5544
03:14:38,970 --> 03:14:40,410
I love fitting in.

5545
03:14:40,770 --> 03:14:41,450
I'm trying to.

5546
03:14:42,870 --> 03:14:44,810
Okay, I feel like we're entering another cult.

5547
03:14:46,210 --> 03:14:46,910
She's crazy like...

5548
03:14:47,530 --> 03:14:51,250
Are these the other religions they talked about?

5549
03:14:51,430 --> 03:14:51,830
No.

5550
03:14:51,850 --> 03:14:53,790
Okay, I think I'm gonna start running.

5551
03:14:54,790 --> 03:14:56,470
Wait, but it could be a cool cult.

5552
03:14:57,050 --> 03:14:58,430
We could get more free stuff.

5553
03:14:59,630 --> 03:15:00,190
I'm leaving.

5554
03:15:00,450 --> 03:15:00,830
Oh my god, that sight.

5555
03:15:00,930 --> 03:15:01,410
That is so good.

5556
03:15:01,410 --> 03:15:02,110
Oh my god.

5557
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:04,510
Look into the distance.

5558
03:15:04,950 --> 03:15:06,450
Is this a Pepe cult?

5559
03:15:06,630 --> 03:15:07,230
That's amazing.

5560
03:15:07,710 --> 03:15:08,350
Why does he have boobs?

5561
03:15:08,730 --> 03:15:10,530
Is this a cult of Pepe?

5562
03:15:10,630 --> 03:15:11,770
Wait, you guys can see my sign?

5563
03:15:11,810 --> 03:15:11,990
How?

5564
03:15:12,130 --> 03:15:14,990
I think this is a Pepe cult.

5565
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:16,350
Oh no, we are...

5566
03:15:17,630 --> 03:15:18,650
We're watching right now.

5567
03:15:18,890 --> 03:15:20,730
Wait, where are you Goomy?

5568
03:15:21,850 --> 03:15:22,350
I'm going home.

5569
03:15:22,470 --> 03:15:23,010
Wait!

5570
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:25,350
Wait for me!

5571
03:15:27,590 --> 03:15:28,810
Where did you go?

5572
03:15:29,750 --> 03:15:31,870
I'm literally running home right now.

5573
03:15:32,010 --> 03:15:32,930
Where's home?

5574
03:15:33,170 --> 03:15:33,950
Where's home?

5575
03:15:36,050 --> 03:15:36,810
Which way?

5576
03:15:38,010 --> 03:15:39,710
I'm going south to...

5577
03:15:39,710 --> 03:15:40,890
I-20.

5578
03:15:41,170 --> 03:15:42,110
I-20.

5579
03:15:42,210 --> 03:15:43,170
I-20.

5580
03:15:43,270 --> 03:15:44,250
Where's I-20?

5581
03:15:45,270 --> 03:15:46,550
Where's I-20?

5582
03:15:46,790 --> 03:15:47,810
Goomy, wait for me.

5583
03:15:47,990 --> 03:15:48,970
And then I'm going to kill myself.

5584
03:15:49,190 --> 03:15:50,610
And then I'm gonna spawn in my car.

5585
03:15:51,950 --> 03:15:52,570
And then I'm gonna spawn in my car.

5586
03:15:52,570 --> 03:15:53,750
Wait, but like...

5587
03:15:54,750 --> 03:15:55,150
What?

5588
03:15:56,310 --> 03:15:57,130
You're gonna lose your stuff.

5589
03:15:58,170 --> 03:16:00,070
No, not if I put it away at home.

5590
03:16:00,450 --> 03:16:01,750
Oh, wait, can you wait for me?

5591
03:16:01,930 --> 03:16:03,070
So I can live in your...

5592
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:04,750
So I can squat in your garage?

5593
03:16:07,090 --> 03:16:07,830
Listen, fine.

5594
03:16:07,930 --> 03:16:10,250
I'll build you a little room off the side of the garage.

5595
03:16:10,530 --> 03:16:10,870
Yay!

5596
03:16:11,530 --> 03:16:12,230
Oh, I'm bleeding.

5597
03:16:12,370 --> 03:16:13,590
No, I ran into a cactus!

5598
03:16:14,070 --> 03:16:15,850
Because I was so busy looking at the map.

5599
03:16:16,570 --> 03:16:18,030
Alright, I'm running to...

5600
03:16:18,030 --> 03:16:19,050
I-20.

5601
03:16:19,050 --> 03:16:20,330
Where's I-20 again?

5602
03:16:21,270 --> 03:16:22,150
I-20.

5603
03:16:23,710 --> 03:16:25,050
Oh, wait, I ran the wrong way.

5604
03:16:25,690 --> 03:16:26,290
Don't worry.

5605
03:16:26,530 --> 03:16:27,470
Oh, there it is!

5606
03:16:28,330 --> 03:16:29,010
I-20.

5607
03:16:29,190 --> 03:16:30,310
That's your house, right?

5608
03:16:30,990 --> 03:16:31,430
Yup.

5609
03:16:32,510 --> 03:16:33,710
Okay, I'm heading over.

5610
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:36,930
Don't worry.

5611
03:16:38,070 --> 03:16:39,190
I'm coming over.

5612
03:16:39,610 --> 03:16:40,970
Don't stop believing.

5613
03:16:40,970 --> 03:16:41,610
Oh my god, a freak!

5614
03:16:41,710 --> 03:16:42,970
He's on the side of the road!

5615
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:43,950
There's what?

5616
03:16:44,890 --> 03:16:45,850
I found a horse.

5617
03:16:46,690 --> 03:16:48,610
Wait, I'm trying to find my horse too.

5618
03:16:49,430 --> 03:16:50,970
What do you mean, my horse?

5619
03:16:51,190 --> 03:16:51,910
My horse.

5620
03:16:51,930 --> 03:16:52,610
You don't got a horse?

5621
03:16:52,990 --> 03:16:53,410
Yes, I do.

5622
03:16:53,530 --> 03:16:54,570
I always find horses.

5623
03:16:55,550 --> 03:16:57,550
I gotta put back my wolf hat.

5624
03:16:58,170 --> 03:16:59,330
I can't believe it!

5625
03:16:59,330 --> 03:17:00,910
Now we're part of two cults!

5626
03:17:01,710 --> 03:17:02,150
Yeah.

5627
03:17:02,430 --> 03:17:06,170
We should tell Baby Billy about the second cult we found.

5628
03:17:06,570 --> 03:17:07,790
You think that wiped them?

5629
03:17:08,250 --> 03:17:11,710
We should tell Baby Billy about the skippity toilet thing that that guy told us.

5630
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:15,590
And he said he was giving a secret from Baby Billy.

5631
03:17:15,590 --> 03:17:15,830
And he said he was giving a secret from Baby Billy.

5632
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:16,070
Yeah.

5633
03:17:16,150 --> 03:17:17,430
Oh, he's not Baby Billy.

5634
03:17:17,430 --> 03:17:18,130
He's not gonna like that.

5635
03:17:18,610 --> 03:17:20,310
Baby Billy doesn't like secrets.

5636
03:17:20,350 --> 03:17:22,170
Yeah, Baby Billy needs you to tell everything.

5637
03:17:22,690 --> 03:17:23,550
Uh huh.

5638
03:17:27,030 --> 03:17:28,250
I can't believe...

5639
03:17:28,250 --> 03:17:30,110
I can't believe he would keep a secret from Baby Billy.

5640
03:17:30,290 --> 03:17:32,330
After everything he did for that man.

5641
03:17:33,390 --> 03:17:35,250
Yeah, like baptize him.

5642
03:17:35,570 --> 03:17:37,910
Like he gave him a home and everything.

5643
03:17:38,370 --> 03:17:42,450
And then he's willing to like fuck over Baby Billy by keeping a secret?

5644
03:17:43,790 --> 03:17:45,830
And he was the one that told us about the secret?

5645
03:17:45,830 --> 03:17:45,910
Yeah.

5646
03:17:45,910 --> 03:17:46,630
But we didn't know about the other religions.

5647
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:52,590
We didn't know about the other religions until he told us about it.

5648
03:17:53,770 --> 03:17:54,250
Yeah.

5649
03:17:59,010 --> 03:17:59,490
Blasphemous.

5650
03:17:59,930 --> 03:18:02,790
I don't think he's a true believer of the Blood God.

5651
03:18:03,050 --> 03:18:04,230
Well I don't think so either.

5652
03:18:04,770 --> 03:18:05,990
I think he's a liar.

5653
03:18:06,390 --> 03:18:07,710
I think he's a spy.

5654
03:18:10,950 --> 03:18:12,830
I think we should kill him.

5655
03:18:14,490 --> 03:18:15,810
Wait, we gotta strip him.

5656
03:18:40,390 --> 03:18:45,730
I think you also died.

5657
03:18:45,830 --> 03:18:49,010
And then we both respawned at the church.

5658
03:18:49,250 --> 03:18:49,990
Wait, but...

5659
03:18:50,610 --> 03:18:51,730
You just need one driver.

5660
03:18:53,250 --> 03:18:54,210
Yeah, but...

5661
03:18:54,210 --> 03:18:56,190
Don't you wanna go pick stuff from...

5662
03:18:56,190 --> 03:18:58,050
the free church house they gave us?

5663
03:18:58,290 --> 03:18:59,090
Oh, that's true.

5664
03:18:59,150 --> 03:19:00,190
And then move it to your house?

5665
03:19:00,790 --> 03:19:02,330
Yeah, into the house I'm gonna build you.

5666
03:19:02,330 --> 03:19:03,150
Oh, that's so true!

5667
03:19:06,610 --> 03:19:08,170
That is so smart.

5668
03:19:09,170 --> 03:19:11,550
We should join that other cult, the Pepe cult.

5669
03:19:11,790 --> 03:19:13,370
And then get some stuff as well.

5670
03:19:13,490 --> 03:19:13,530
They look poor.

5671
03:19:14,970 --> 03:19:15,450
What?

5672
03:19:16,130 --> 03:19:16,610
What?

5673
03:19:17,310 --> 03:19:18,410
There's the Pepe cult.

5674
03:19:18,530 --> 03:19:18,870
You outside?

5675
03:19:19,130 --> 03:19:19,570
Yeah, that's me.

5676
03:19:19,690 --> 03:19:20,530
I hear someone running outside.

5677
03:19:20,610 --> 03:19:20,910
That's me.

5678
03:19:21,050 --> 03:19:22,190
How... What's the code?

5679
03:19:22,490 --> 03:19:22,970
434?

5680
03:19:24,210 --> 03:19:24,690
No.

5681
03:19:25,170 --> 03:19:25,910
What's the code?

5682
03:19:26,870 --> 03:19:28,530
I don't think I can tell you that one.

5683
03:19:29,070 --> 03:19:29,910
Stop knocking.

5684
03:19:33,510 --> 03:19:34,470
Open up.

5685
03:19:34,650 --> 03:19:35,570
Open up.

5686
03:19:36,190 --> 03:19:37,110
Open up.

5687
03:19:37,370 --> 03:19:38,370
Gumi, open up.

5688
03:19:41,990 --> 03:19:43,730
How am I supposed to, like...

5689
03:19:43,730 --> 03:19:44,750
put my stuff away?

5690
03:19:46,850 --> 03:19:48,770
I'll give you a chest, man.

5691
03:19:49,110 --> 03:19:50,770
Well, I need to be inside.

5692
03:19:51,750 --> 03:19:52,690
No, you don't.

5693
03:19:52,690 --> 03:19:53,210
Yes, I do.

5694
03:19:53,330 --> 03:19:55,630
And my stuff is outside and people are gonna loot it!

5695
03:19:56,670 --> 03:19:57,630
I'm in the garage!

5696
03:19:58,430 --> 03:19:59,530
Wait, you're in the garage?

5697
03:20:00,730 --> 03:20:01,210
Yeah.

5698
03:20:01,650 --> 03:20:02,630
Oh, okay.

5699
03:20:02,970 --> 03:20:05,050
Are you saying that so I'll stop knocking?

5700
03:20:05,690 --> 03:20:07,950
No, I'm literally not in the house.

5701
03:20:09,210 --> 03:20:09,970
Open up.

5702
03:20:12,750 --> 03:20:13,770
I'm in the garage.

5703
03:20:13,770 --> 03:20:13,990
Oh, my gosh.

5704
03:20:14,770 --> 03:20:15,990
No, I see you.

5705
03:20:17,850 --> 03:20:18,990
How do I get in?

5706
03:20:19,370 --> 03:20:20,730
Stop knocking, man.

5707
03:20:20,810 --> 03:20:21,850
How do I get in?

5708
03:20:26,330 --> 03:20:27,110
I'm waiting.

5709
03:20:28,370 --> 03:20:29,490
I'm literally...

5710
03:20:29,490 --> 03:20:30,990
The other side's open.

5711
03:20:31,510 --> 03:20:32,070
Yeah!

5712
03:20:35,070 --> 03:20:35,850
No, it's not.

5713
03:20:37,950 --> 03:20:39,590
You have three doors.

5714
03:20:41,670 --> 03:20:42,470
Wait, what?

5715
03:20:42,570 --> 03:20:43,170
Oh, there it is!

5716
03:20:43,990 --> 03:20:44,550
Yeah!

5717
03:20:48,750 --> 03:20:49,310
What?

5718
03:20:50,290 --> 03:20:50,490
What?

5719
03:20:51,430 --> 03:20:51,990
What?

5720
03:20:56,430 --> 03:20:56,990
Nothing.

5721
03:20:57,270 --> 03:20:59,870
These two boxes on the left and right are yours.

5722
03:21:00,190 --> 03:21:00,750
Okay.

5723
03:21:01,070 --> 03:21:01,630
Yay!

5724
03:21:05,850 --> 03:21:06,490
All right.

5725
03:21:06,610 --> 03:21:08,310
I'm thinking about who to close off to.

5726
03:21:08,530 --> 03:21:09,010
All right.

5727
03:21:09,010 --> 03:21:09,550
How do we...

5728
03:21:09,550 --> 03:21:10,290
How do we...

5729
03:21:11,110 --> 03:21:12,430
Kill ourselves here?

5730
03:21:12,810 --> 03:21:14,910
Press escape and then click suicide.

5731
03:21:15,610 --> 03:21:16,390
Oh, okay.

5732
03:21:16,950 --> 03:21:17,410
Goodbye.

5733
03:21:21,610 --> 03:21:24,570
Oh, and then we spawn at Doki Reborn, right?

5734
03:21:25,490 --> 03:21:26,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5735
03:21:28,930 --> 03:21:29,470
All right.

5736
03:21:30,670 --> 03:21:31,370
I'm back.

5737
03:21:32,210 --> 03:21:33,090
I'm in my car.

5738
03:21:33,690 --> 03:21:34,270
Wait, what?

5739
03:21:35,870 --> 03:21:36,650
How did you...

5740
03:21:36,650 --> 03:21:38,070
My car has...

5741
03:21:38,740 --> 03:21:39,970
Um, a bed in it.

5742
03:21:40,010 --> 03:21:41,230
So I can respawn in my car.

5743
03:21:41,470 --> 03:21:41,910
Wait, what?

5744
03:21:42,170 --> 03:21:43,610
How are you gonna pick me up?

5745
03:21:44,930 --> 03:21:45,370
What?

5746
03:21:45,410 --> 03:21:45,770
With my car?

5747
03:21:46,070 --> 03:21:47,450
Where is your car?

5748
03:21:48,710 --> 03:21:49,590
At the church?

5749
03:21:49,930 --> 03:21:51,370
Oh, wait, where am I?

5750
03:21:55,790 --> 03:21:57,570
Where is the church?

5751
03:21:57,730 --> 03:21:58,910
Oh, the church is in front of me.

5752
03:21:58,950 --> 03:21:59,570
I'm at the church.

5753
03:22:00,070 --> 03:22:01,890
You left your car here?

5754
03:22:02,110 --> 03:22:03,570
Oh wait, I forgot your car ran out of gas.

5755
03:22:04,010 --> 03:22:04,450
Yeah.

5756
03:22:04,890 --> 03:22:09,670
I don't remember where... I actually don't remember where...

5757
03:22:09,670 --> 03:22:10,810
It said R5.

5758
03:22:11,270 --> 03:22:11,710
R5?

5759
03:22:13,070 --> 03:22:13,550
R5...

5760
03:22:13,550 --> 03:22:15,290
Oh, R5 is this way.

5761
03:22:15,390 --> 03:22:15,750
Okay.

5762
03:22:16,090 --> 03:22:17,250
I'm heading over to R5.

5763
03:22:21,190 --> 03:22:21,670
Alright.

5764
03:22:22,150 --> 03:22:22,990
I'm heading over.

5765
03:22:25,950 --> 03:22:26,430
Yay!

5766
03:22:29,930 --> 03:22:33,210
I can't believe we did so much in just...

5767
03:22:33,210 --> 03:22:34,470
No, I'm ready to take a nap.

5768
03:22:34,770 --> 03:22:37,170
Yeah, in just like three hours.

5769
03:22:37,270 --> 03:22:38,550
We did so much today.

5770
03:22:39,010 --> 03:22:40,530
Yeah, we got indoctrinated.

5771
03:22:40,950 --> 03:22:42,490
We made so many new friends.

5772
03:22:43,750 --> 03:22:44,390
We met Uncle Billy...

5773
03:22:44,390 --> 03:22:45,070
Yeah, named them all.

5774
03:22:45,290 --> 03:22:50,250
We met Uncle Baby Billy, Ray-Bans, uh...

5775
03:22:50,250 --> 03:22:51,290
Ray-Bans?

5776
03:22:53,650 --> 03:22:57,750
Canes, Stonewall, the cannibals, uh...

5777
03:22:58,410 --> 03:23:01,570
Bader Sire, uh...

5778
03:23:01,570 --> 03:23:02,450
Alright, I'm there.

5779
03:23:02,710 --> 03:23:03,590
I'm here now.

5780
03:23:05,690 --> 03:23:07,210
Blood God, are you there?

5781
03:23:09,350 --> 03:23:11,890
Okay, where are you?

5782
03:23:12,050 --> 03:23:12,570
Oh, is that you?

5783
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:14,810
No, that's Stonewall.

5784
03:23:15,530 --> 03:23:16,170
Oh, there you are.

5785
03:23:16,490 --> 03:23:17,730
Wait, how do you have clothes?

5786
03:23:19,330 --> 03:23:20,730
Because I went into the house.

5787
03:23:21,050 --> 03:23:22,490
What you s- Oh, wait, wait, yeah.

5788
03:23:22,550 --> 03:23:23,070
Did you get everything?

5789
03:23:23,330 --> 03:23:24,010
Should we get more stuff?

5790
03:23:24,130 --> 03:23:24,190
No.

5791
03:23:25,550 --> 03:23:26,790
Wait, where is our stuff?

5792
03:23:27,570 --> 03:23:27,610
What?

5793
03:23:28,190 --> 03:23:29,050
Did you die?

5794
03:23:29,210 --> 03:23:30,030
Or why are you naked?

5795
03:23:32,290 --> 03:23:32,670
Yeah...

5796
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:34,910
Alright.

5797
03:23:35,510 --> 03:23:36,790
Time to yoink.

5798
03:23:37,310 --> 03:23:37,690
Yoink.

5799
03:23:39,170 --> 03:23:39,550
Yoink.

5800
03:23:40,410 --> 03:23:41,510
No, I have to pee.

5801
03:23:41,690 --> 03:23:42,070
Yoink.

5802
03:23:44,730 --> 03:23:45,370
Let's see.

5803
03:23:45,510 --> 03:23:46,430
Where are the other clothes?

5804
03:23:49,790 --> 03:23:50,210
Uhh...

5805
03:23:50,210 --> 03:23:52,710
Where are the other clothes?

5806
03:23:53,970 --> 03:23:54,810
That's all we had.

5807
03:23:55,090 --> 03:23:55,430
Oh.

5808
03:23:57,250 --> 03:23:58,370
Wait, there's a hat.

5809
03:23:58,470 --> 03:23:59,510
Did you grab the hat in here?

5810
03:23:59,650 --> 03:24:00,090
There's a hat?

5811
03:24:00,290 --> 03:24:01,070
Oh, there's a gun.

5812
03:24:01,450 --> 03:24:02,610
There's ID cards.

5813
03:24:04,990 --> 03:24:05,970
Oh, there's vitamins.

5814
03:24:07,390 --> 03:24:08,410
Wait, is there a hat?

5815
03:24:09,430 --> 03:24:10,170
I have this.

5816
03:24:10,790 --> 03:24:11,430
There you go.

5817
03:24:11,470 --> 03:24:12,230
I'm not naked anymore.

5818
03:24:12,430 --> 03:24:12,990
It's time.

5819
03:24:13,750 --> 03:24:14,930
I'm ready to swim.

5820
03:24:15,630 --> 03:24:16,510
What the hell?

5821
03:24:18,190 --> 03:24:20,810
I'm ready to dive in.

5822
03:24:21,530 --> 03:24:22,610
Wait, give me a sec.

5823
03:24:22,830 --> 03:24:24,490
Give me a sec.

5824
03:24:24,610 --> 03:24:25,150
I can't...

5825
03:24:25,710 --> 03:24:27,170
I can't get out of here.

5826
03:24:27,270 --> 03:24:27,550
Okay.

5827
03:24:28,310 --> 03:24:28,930
I'm ready.

5828
03:24:31,670 --> 03:24:32,110
4343.

5829
03:24:32,850 --> 03:24:33,530
Wait, what?

5830
03:24:35,930 --> 03:24:36,710
Oh, there you go.

5831
03:24:39,090 --> 03:24:40,530
Okay, I'm gonna take off my goggles.

5832
03:24:41,270 --> 03:24:41,790
Alright.

5833
03:24:42,110 --> 03:24:43,290
Back home we go!

5834
03:24:43,530 --> 03:24:44,630
Our second home!

5835
03:24:45,110 --> 03:24:45,630
Yep.

5836
03:24:46,510 --> 03:24:47,030
Yay!

5837
03:24:48,110 --> 03:24:49,970
What an adventure we had.

5838
03:24:50,710 --> 03:24:51,430
I know.

5839
03:24:54,050 --> 03:24:55,850
Thanks for giving me the tour, Agumi.

5840
03:24:56,950 --> 03:24:57,470
Yep.

5841
03:24:57,470 --> 03:24:59,270
I think I would have definitely died.

5842
03:25:00,850 --> 03:25:04,770
There's a maybe that the server might close in two days.

5843
03:25:05,090 --> 03:25:05,890
Oh yeah, no, I heard.

5844
03:25:06,010 --> 03:25:07,930
The server's supposed to be up for like seven days or something.

5845
03:25:08,830 --> 03:25:12,850
But it might last for longer depending on how people feel about it.

5846
03:25:12,930 --> 03:25:13,130
Yeah.

5847
03:25:13,350 --> 03:25:15,690
Depends on if people wanna keep playing type deal, right?

5848
03:25:16,850 --> 03:25:17,690
Yeah, so...

5849
03:25:17,690 --> 03:25:20,430
You better be back on before the server closes.

5850
03:25:21,270 --> 03:25:22,090
I mean...

5851
03:25:22,090 --> 03:25:24,330
I feel like I learned a lot from the first day.

5852
03:25:25,810 --> 03:25:26,790
What an adventure.

5853
03:25:28,810 --> 03:25:29,710
Oh, look, a casino.

5854
03:25:29,970 --> 03:25:31,210
Hi Mr. Puno!

5855
03:25:31,210 --> 03:25:32,890
Oh my god, you almost killed me!

5856
03:25:33,030 --> 03:25:33,450
Hey!

5857
03:25:34,290 --> 03:25:34,950
Hey, it's Dosey Dory.

5858
03:25:34,950 --> 03:25:34,970
I know.

5859
03:25:35,470 --> 03:25:36,030
It's me!

5860
03:25:36,450 --> 03:25:37,150
Alright, what are you guys up to?

5861
03:25:37,170 --> 03:25:37,990
Yeah, I gave her a tour.

5862
03:25:38,010 --> 03:25:39,050
Yeah, we joined a cult.

5863
03:25:39,710 --> 03:25:40,130
Oh.

5864
03:25:40,650 --> 03:25:41,090
Yeah.

5865
03:25:41,750 --> 03:25:43,810
The one and only cult, right?

5866
03:25:46,450 --> 03:25:48,450
Wait, like a Mischief's team.

5867
03:25:48,530 --> 03:25:49,470
It's called the church, man.

5868
03:25:49,690 --> 03:25:50,170
Oh, sorry.

5869
03:25:50,250 --> 03:25:51,250
We joined a religion.

5870
03:25:51,430 --> 03:25:52,290
No, no, we joined a church.

5871
03:25:52,290 --> 03:25:54,290
Oh, you wanna get baptized?

5872
03:25:54,710 --> 03:25:56,610
Wait, wait, have you got baptized yet?

5873
03:25:59,050 --> 03:26:01,070
No, I'm part of Rusty Bones.

5874
03:26:01,270 --> 03:26:03,050
Yeah, you can be part of both.

5875
03:26:03,370 --> 03:26:04,090
It's a religion.

5876
03:26:04,130 --> 03:26:05,370
Rusty Bones is not a religion.

5877
03:26:05,790 --> 03:26:07,990
There's only one religion in this server anyway.

5878
03:26:09,370 --> 03:26:11,010
You're just taking a rusty bone.

5879
03:26:11,050 --> 03:26:11,470
Hey, type 2.

5880
03:26:11,510 --> 03:26:11,950
Oh!

5881
03:26:12,110 --> 03:26:12,910
Uncle Bobby Billy.

5882
03:26:14,430 --> 03:26:16,330
Uncle Bobby Billy.

5883
03:26:16,370 --> 03:26:16,890
Maybe Billy.

5884
03:26:17,010 --> 03:26:21,790
We found another person who wants to get baptized.

5885
03:26:22,750 --> 03:26:22,950
We found another person who wants to get baptized.

5886
03:26:22,950 --> 03:26:25,470
Uh, you know, I mean, the church is not really my...

5887
03:26:25,470 --> 03:26:25,850
You wanted to get baptized, right?

5888
03:26:25,850 --> 03:26:27,270
Yeah, you wanted to get baptized, right?

5889
03:26:27,690 --> 03:26:28,570
You wanna join?

5890
03:26:28,590 --> 03:26:30,730
17,000 profits?

5891
03:26:31,250 --> 03:26:32,410
Who is this guy?

5892
03:26:36,350 --> 03:26:37,430
Where's Bobby Billy?

5893
03:26:40,130 --> 03:26:40,530
Alright.

5894
03:26:40,570 --> 03:26:42,750
Oh, there he is!

5895
03:26:42,870 --> 03:26:43,490
There he is!

5896
03:26:43,750 --> 03:26:45,350
He said, oh, praise the Lord!

5897
03:26:46,730 --> 03:26:48,630
We're here to expand the church!

5898
03:26:55,110 --> 03:26:55,510
Alright.

5899
03:26:55,710 --> 03:26:56,730
Oh, wait a minute.

5900
03:26:56,850 --> 03:26:57,450
Yeah, follow us!

5901
03:26:58,110 --> 03:26:59,110
Follow us, IKUNO!

5902
03:26:59,410 --> 03:27:00,410
This is the village.

5903
03:27:01,450 --> 03:27:01,850
Yeah!

5904
03:27:02,150 --> 03:27:03,730
Yeah, get back in the car!

5905
03:27:04,330 --> 03:27:05,570
Oh, wait, get back in the car?

5906
03:27:05,590 --> 03:27:05,910
Oh, okay.

5907
03:27:06,550 --> 03:27:07,990
Oh, wait, is this not it?

5908
03:27:08,050 --> 03:27:08,570
Okay, sure.

5909
03:27:10,030 --> 03:27:11,390
Keep your hands off my horse!

5910
03:27:11,490 --> 03:27:12,450
Wait, that's the guy that tried...

5911
03:27:12,450 --> 03:27:14,150
No, that's... No, he isn't!

5912
03:27:14,330 --> 03:27:16,990
No, he wasn't him!

5913
03:27:17,130 --> 03:27:18,050
What are you doing here?

5914
03:27:18,070 --> 03:27:18,870
I gave you a car!

5915
03:27:21,190 --> 03:27:22,190
What are you doing here?

5916
03:27:22,330 --> 03:27:22,550
Leave!

5917
03:27:23,090 --> 03:27:24,410
I was the one that gave you the car!

5918
03:27:24,570 --> 03:27:24,770
Leave!

5919
03:27:29,290 --> 03:27:30,350
It's still a car!

5920
03:27:33,450 --> 03:27:33,850
Okay.

5921
03:27:34,730 --> 03:27:35,130
Where's...

5922
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:35,790
Where is he?

5923
03:27:38,310 --> 03:27:39,330
Where's... Where's Uncle?

5924
03:27:39,630 --> 03:27:41,370
He said he's on his way over.

5925
03:27:41,490 --> 03:27:42,650
Oh, he's on his way over?

5926
03:27:45,330 --> 03:27:47,170
Yeah, here, we'll take you to it, IKUNO.

5927
03:27:47,650 --> 03:27:48,130
Yeah, here, we'll take you to it, IKUNO.

5928
03:27:48,130 --> 03:27:48,130
Yeah!

5929
03:27:48,430 --> 03:27:49,790
We'll take you to get baptized.

5930
03:27:50,090 --> 03:27:51,390
You're gonna believe so hard.

5931
03:27:53,970 --> 03:27:55,070
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

5932
03:27:55,150 --> 03:27:55,390
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

5933
03:27:55,390 --> 03:27:56,170
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

5934
03:27:56,370 --> 03:27:56,590
Yeah?

5935
03:27:56,810 --> 03:27:59,990
I was thinking... We found someone who wants to get baptized.

5936
03:27:59,990 --> 03:28:00,790
I was thinking... We found someone who wants to get baptized.

5937
03:28:00,990 --> 03:28:01,790
...until he's here.

5938
03:28:02,250 --> 03:28:03,490
Oh, what is he doing?

5939
03:28:03,710 --> 03:28:05,010
Oh, you're in for a treat.

5940
03:28:05,190 --> 03:28:06,650
Oh, this guy wants to believe!

5941
03:28:06,970 --> 03:28:07,530
He wants to get baptized!

5942
03:28:09,090 --> 03:28:10,870
Oh, well, hey guys, you heard him.

5943
03:28:10,890 --> 03:28:11,410
Ten minutes.

5944
03:28:12,270 --> 03:28:13,150
Ten minutes.

5945
03:28:13,350 --> 03:28:15,550
We had some more human meat.

5946
03:28:15,790 --> 03:28:21,070
Do you remember the guy by the supermarket that offered you guys the pistachio ice cream?

5947
03:28:21,590 --> 03:28:22,030
Yeah?

5948
03:28:22,090 --> 03:28:22,170
The cannibals?

5949
03:28:22,770 --> 03:28:23,770
Yeah, yeah, the cannibals.

5950
03:28:24,170 --> 03:28:29,310
So, we ran into him again and the true blood god might have eaten some.

5951
03:28:29,370 --> 03:28:31,070
So, he's currently actually on the toilet.

5952
03:28:31,630 --> 03:28:32,070
Oh!

5953
03:28:33,730 --> 03:28:34,610
I see.

5954
03:28:34,610 --> 03:28:35,570
Oh, okay.

5955
03:28:35,710 --> 03:28:36,170
Well, hey.

5956
03:28:36,250 --> 03:28:37,990
We'll have to try again later.

5957
03:28:38,230 --> 03:28:39,250
Well, oh darn.

5958
03:28:39,650 --> 03:28:40,550
No, uh, no...

5959
03:28:40,550 --> 03:28:41,590
No, no, we can wait!

5960
03:28:42,910 --> 03:28:43,850
Don't you want to believe?

5961
03:28:44,390 --> 03:28:46,090
You should, uh, whilst you guys wait, you should maybe...

5962
03:28:46,510 --> 03:28:50,590
You should maybe bag them so they don't have the timer thing that happened earlier, remember?

5963
03:28:51,410 --> 03:28:52,430
Ah, I see.

5964
03:28:52,610 --> 03:28:53,430
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5965
03:28:53,450 --> 03:28:54,590
He needs a sleeping bag.

5966
03:28:57,090 --> 03:28:57,610
Wait, we...

5967
03:28:58,030 --> 03:29:00,010
I can get some cloth if you need some.

5968
03:29:00,010 --> 03:29:01,610
Yeah, yeah, we might need some for him.

5969
03:29:01,670 --> 03:29:02,390
For our new believer.

5970
03:29:03,330 --> 03:29:04,570
Okay, come, come, come, come.

5971
03:29:04,610 --> 03:29:04,990
Come, come, come.

5972
03:29:08,030 --> 03:29:09,950
Are you excited, Mr. Kudo?

5973
03:29:10,190 --> 03:29:11,070
Yeah, are you excited?

5974
03:29:11,370 --> 03:29:12,990
I gotta give Elm his stuff back.

5975
03:29:13,070 --> 03:29:14,090
He's at the Coliseum.

5976
03:29:14,230 --> 03:29:15,650
Oh, it's... we gotta...

5977
03:29:15,650 --> 03:29:16,870
He can wait, he can wait.

5978
03:29:16,910 --> 03:29:17,850
Yeah, yeah, he can wait.

5979
03:29:19,030 --> 03:29:20,090
I've got his guns.

5980
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:21,730
He can wait.

5981
03:29:21,730 --> 03:29:22,650
It's 10 minutes!

5982
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:24,050
He has plenty of those.

5983
03:29:25,890 --> 03:29:27,550
Guns aren't allowed in the Coliseum.

5984
03:29:27,610 --> 03:29:29,350
Guns aren't allowed in the Coliseum anyway.

5985
03:29:29,450 --> 03:29:30,430
So, he has to wait anyway.

5986
03:29:30,550 --> 03:29:30,850
Don't worry.

5987
03:29:30,970 --> 03:29:31,470
Yeah, yeah.

5988
03:29:32,030 --> 03:29:34,070
They aren't allowed...

5989
03:29:34,670 --> 03:29:35,150
Okay.

5990
03:29:35,330 --> 03:29:38,370
Have you heard good things about this religion, Saikuno?

5991
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:43,360
Have you?

5992
03:29:43,640 --> 03:29:44,840
No, I haven't heard anything.

5993
03:29:45,080 --> 03:29:48,120
Wait, you've never heard... Kumi, tell him about all the great things!

5994
03:29:49,220 --> 03:29:51,320
Tell him about all the great things they did for us!

5995
03:29:51,640 --> 03:29:56,020
They gave us a free home, free food, free water...

5996
03:29:57,600 --> 03:29:59,080
They gave us a car...

5997
03:29:59,080 --> 03:30:00,260
I have 12 seconds.

5998
03:30:02,120 --> 03:30:03,600
They gave you this car?

5999
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:05,040
Yeah, they gave us this car!

6000
03:30:05,420 --> 03:30:05,760
Like this car.

6001
03:30:07,520 --> 03:30:08,700
Drive to the river.

6002
03:30:08,840 --> 03:30:09,600
I'll meet you guys at the river.

6003
03:30:09,880 --> 03:30:10,460
Oh, yeah.

6004
03:30:10,560 --> 03:30:12,340
We're gonna take you to the river to get baptized.

6005
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:15,280
I think there's actually an extra seat in here.

6006
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:16,020
I'm going to be honest with that.

6007
03:30:16,100 --> 03:30:17,280
I think there's just an extra seat.

6008
03:30:17,460 --> 03:30:20,720
I need to take this car there as well.

6009
03:30:20,760 --> 03:30:20,960
I need to take this car there as well.

6010
03:30:21,460 --> 03:30:22,820
Oh, you're going to love it.

6011
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:23,920
You're going to love this place.

6012
03:30:24,840 --> 03:30:27,600
We were reborn and we believed so hard.

6013
03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:31,120
I'm so sorry.

6014
03:30:31,120 --> 03:30:32,380
I've never been happier.

6015
03:30:32,700 --> 03:30:33,120
I know!

6016
03:30:33,260 --> 03:30:35,700
I've been so happy ever since I got baptized.

6017
03:30:36,220 --> 03:30:37,480
Like I saw the truth.

6018
03:30:38,820 --> 03:30:42,640
I just joined today and now I realize this is the one true religion.

6019
03:30:45,480 --> 03:30:45,960
Wow.

6020
03:30:47,280 --> 03:30:48,920
So you guys are like PVPers?

6021
03:30:49,060 --> 03:30:50,480
Do you kill other players?

6022
03:30:51,980 --> 03:30:54,520
No, we just here to spread peace and love.

6023
03:30:54,540 --> 03:30:54,960
We just people to change.

6024
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:55,480
Yeah.

6025
03:30:56,200 --> 03:30:57,300
And money too.

6026
03:30:58,120 --> 03:30:59,420
You know they own a casino?

6027
03:30:59,860 --> 03:31:03,020
Apparently they made it rain a thousand scraps.

6028
03:31:03,160 --> 03:31:03,700
Like you know.

6029
03:31:04,380 --> 03:31:04,860
Yeah.

6030
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:06,060
No, no.

6031
03:31:06,080 --> 03:31:07,160
They have like their own casino.

6032
03:31:07,780 --> 03:31:11,500
Is this somebody's house here?

6033
03:31:12,440 --> 03:31:14,000
It's completely undefended.

6034
03:31:14,240 --> 03:31:15,680
This could be your house.

6035
03:31:15,780 --> 03:31:19,040
After you get baptized, you can own this house after.

6036
03:31:21,240 --> 03:31:23,280
I mean, I don't think I want this house.

6037
03:31:24,960 --> 03:31:25,900
You get to own what?

6038
03:31:26,180 --> 03:31:27,300
Property is expensive.

6039
03:31:30,940 --> 03:31:33,240
I feel like I got a better house already.

6040
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:34,940
Real estate is hard, man.

6041
03:31:39,460 --> 03:31:41,060
Like look at that free water.

6042
03:31:43,420 --> 03:31:45,280
I do like the free water.

6043
03:31:45,380 --> 03:31:45,920
That is nice.

6044
03:31:46,200 --> 03:31:47,520
Is there any food around here too?

6045
03:31:47,600 --> 03:31:48,820
Like maybe some pumpkins or something?

6046
03:31:49,040 --> 03:31:51,240
Oh wait, Mr. Raybirds have food?

6047
03:31:51,500 --> 03:31:52,500
You have food for us, right?

6048
03:31:54,860 --> 03:31:55,340
Ah...

6049
03:31:55,340 --> 03:31:56,140
I...

6050
03:31:59,940 --> 03:32:01,820
You said the blood god would provide.

6051
03:32:02,060 --> 03:32:04,180
Sounds like a winded version of that.

6052
03:32:05,120 --> 03:32:06,760
Oh, I have some here.

6053
03:32:06,940 --> 03:32:07,520
I have this.

6054
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:08,780
Oh my god, praise be.

6055
03:32:08,840 --> 03:32:10,080
The blood god does provide.

6056
03:32:10,520 --> 03:32:11,040
Thanks, thanks.

6057
03:32:11,580 --> 03:32:12,320
What is this?

6058
03:32:12,340 --> 03:32:12,780
A donut?

6059
03:32:13,660 --> 03:32:14,760
Oh yeah, donuts.

6060
03:32:14,840 --> 03:32:15,780
Yeah, that's great.

6061
03:32:16,320 --> 03:32:17,600
Yeah, you love donuts.

6062
03:32:17,600 --> 03:32:18,420
That barely filled me up.

6063
03:32:18,600 --> 03:32:22,460
I think I'm gonna need like...

6064
03:32:22,460 --> 03:32:23,400
Oh my god.

6065
03:32:23,400 --> 03:32:24,840
A beach towel.

6066
03:32:25,520 --> 03:32:26,240
That's for you.

6067
03:32:27,260 --> 03:32:27,740
Yeah.

6068
03:32:29,900 --> 03:32:32,700
It's sunny over here, so we've got to, you know, stay on track.

6069
03:32:32,960 --> 03:32:34,160
Place that down and...

6070
03:32:34,160 --> 03:32:34,200
Wait, look!

6071
03:32:34,200 --> 03:32:34,720
There's a pumpkin here!

6072
03:32:35,100 --> 03:32:38,860
Let me put it somewhere safe, like by this thing here.

6073
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:43,200
I'm asking he shall provide.

6074
03:32:43,440 --> 03:32:44,000
Oh wait, pumpkins.

6075
03:32:44,200 --> 03:32:45,480
Wait, I need pumpkins actually.

6076
03:32:46,420 --> 03:32:47,500
I'm actually hungry.

6077
03:32:49,640 --> 03:32:51,860
Wait, there's like... Oh, is this mushroom safe?

6078
03:32:52,820 --> 03:32:53,580
Yeah, let's see.

6079
03:32:54,040 --> 03:32:54,460
Yeah?

6080
03:32:58,740 --> 03:33:00,120
Oh hey, a pumpkin.

6081
03:33:00,280 --> 03:33:01,540
Yeah, that'll help a lot actually.

6082
03:33:01,540 --> 03:33:01,800
See?

6083
03:33:02,020 --> 03:33:02,680
He provides.

6084
03:33:04,280 --> 03:33:05,620
I'm gonna eat my mushroom.

6085
03:33:05,940 --> 03:33:06,340
I need this food.

6086
03:33:06,660 --> 03:33:09,000
This actually helped a lot.

6087
03:33:09,260 --> 03:33:09,680
Yay!

6088
03:33:13,420 --> 03:33:17,280
Yeah, so, I mean the guy who does this, he's gone, right?

6089
03:33:17,420 --> 03:33:18,520
So I guess we can't...

6090
03:33:18,520 --> 03:33:20,000
No, he's coming right now.

6091
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:21,740
He's in like one minute maybe.

6092
03:33:21,760 --> 03:33:23,040
I'll have to join later.

6093
03:33:23,140 --> 03:33:24,960
No, no, he's coming over.

6094
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:26,180
He's coming over.

6095
03:33:27,920 --> 03:33:29,360
He's coming right now.

6096
03:33:30,480 --> 03:33:32,920
Yeah, appreciate the food, I guess.

6097
03:33:32,960 --> 03:33:33,560
Look, Elem's here!

6098
03:33:34,420 --> 03:33:35,200
Oh, Elem's here!

6099
03:33:35,700 --> 03:33:36,060
Hello!

6100
03:33:36,860 --> 03:33:37,260
Hello!

6101
03:33:38,660 --> 03:33:40,940
Oh my god, thank you so much for saving it, man.

6102
03:33:41,260 --> 03:33:41,860
Thank you.

6103
03:33:42,220 --> 03:33:43,540
I was for sure...

6104
03:33:43,540 --> 03:33:44,140
Yeah, yeah, of course.

6105
03:33:44,180 --> 03:33:46,020
Hey, you here for the baptizing, Elem?

6106
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:47,280
Oh my god, you wanna get baptized?

6107
03:33:47,900 --> 03:33:48,640
Oh wait.

6108
03:33:48,940 --> 03:33:50,780
Yeah, I'd love to get baptized.

6109
03:33:51,020 --> 03:33:52,100
Oh my god!

6110
03:33:52,180 --> 03:33:53,380
Wow, let us tell Uncle Baby Billy!

6111
03:33:53,380 --> 03:33:54,760
Okay, we'll get the father of the holy ark.

6112
03:33:54,820 --> 03:33:55,860
Yeah, this'll be great.

6113
03:33:55,980 --> 03:33:56,560
This'll be great.

6114
03:33:56,660 --> 03:33:57,780
Oh my god, baptizing!

6115
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:00,380
Yeah, I got baptized.

6116
03:34:00,480 --> 03:34:01,160
It was great.

6117
03:34:01,280 --> 03:34:03,300
Honestly, 10 out of 10 experience.

6118
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:06,360
We need another bag.

6119
03:34:06,440 --> 03:34:07,180
Elem, quick, quick, quick.

6120
03:34:07,220 --> 03:34:08,500
Before the baptism, put this down.

6121
03:34:08,620 --> 03:34:09,320
Put this down, quick, quick.

6122
03:34:09,960 --> 03:34:10,820
Put it down.

6123
03:34:10,820 --> 03:34:11,400
Hurry, Elem!

6124
03:34:12,360 --> 03:34:13,980
Is there any pumpkins around here?

6125
03:34:14,100 --> 03:34:15,700
I'm starving, I'm starving, guys.

6126
03:34:16,360 --> 03:34:17,080
Wait, do we...

6127
03:34:17,080 --> 03:34:18,140
Here, come here, Elem.

6128
03:34:18,200 --> 03:34:18,580
Here.

6129
03:34:19,540 --> 03:34:21,100
Don't worry, we provide food too.

6130
03:34:21,240 --> 03:34:22,100
We're a good religion.

6131
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:23,640
There's food right here, right here.

6132
03:34:23,660 --> 03:34:25,620
Yeah, let's um...

6133
03:34:26,960 --> 03:34:29,460
Maybe you can cook it up a little on this campfire.

6134
03:34:31,400 --> 03:34:32,440
Yeah, I have some coal.

6135
03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:33,080
Oh wait, I don't.

6136
03:34:33,100 --> 03:34:33,460
I died.

6137
03:34:36,660 --> 03:34:37,640
Oh, are you calling?

6138
03:34:38,360 --> 03:34:40,120
Are you calling Uncle?

6139
03:34:40,480 --> 03:34:40,740
Hello?

6140
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:43,580
Tell him we have two new followers.

6141
03:34:43,740 --> 03:34:44,540
We did our job.

6142
03:34:45,440 --> 03:34:46,300
Hello, how's it going?

6143
03:34:48,440 --> 03:34:49,680
Oh, you have to put...

6144
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:51,420
Oh yeah, here you go.

6145
03:34:52,580 --> 03:34:52,940
Wonderful!

6146
03:34:52,940 --> 03:34:54,000
Hey, where did Sakuno go?

6147
03:34:54,660 --> 03:34:55,620
Oh yes, yes, yes.

6148
03:34:56,920 --> 03:34:58,500
He's above, he's above the house.

6149
03:34:58,620 --> 03:34:59,880
I saw you took it off last night.

6150
03:35:00,040 --> 03:35:00,940
Do you not like it anymore?

6151
03:35:01,220 --> 03:35:01,580
Oh, there he is.

6152
03:35:01,860 --> 03:35:02,280
Hello?

6153
03:35:04,220 --> 03:35:04,640
Hello?

6154
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:09,930
Oh, hey.

6155
03:35:10,050 --> 03:35:11,570
I was just chilling up on the house here.

6156
03:35:12,430 --> 03:35:14,290
Ah, I fell in the water.

6157
03:35:16,070 --> 03:35:17,090
Okay, okay, okay.

6158
03:35:17,490 --> 03:35:18,550
What are you up to now?

6159
03:35:21,910 --> 03:35:24,550
Oh, I can't wait to see Uncle.

6160
03:35:26,070 --> 03:35:27,610
He's gonna be so excited.

6161
03:35:27,770 --> 03:35:29,450
You guys are gonna love Uncle Bobby Billy.

6162
03:35:29,550 --> 03:35:30,770
He sings for us.

6163
03:35:30,890 --> 03:35:32,490
Yeah, he's a great singer.

6164
03:35:33,170 --> 03:35:35,250
No, no, it's the one true religion.

6165
03:35:35,510 --> 03:35:35,790
No.

6166
03:35:36,190 --> 03:35:38,330
There's only one religion in this rest server.

6167
03:35:38,970 --> 03:35:40,190
You wanna brush the feathers?

6168
03:35:40,510 --> 03:35:42,330
LM, you didn't know I could see what you're saying.

6169
03:35:42,590 --> 03:35:42,950
I'll meet you.

6170
03:35:46,290 --> 03:35:47,710
Wait, what is he saying?

6171
03:35:47,890 --> 03:35:48,190
I don't say anything.

6172
03:35:48,550 --> 03:35:49,150
Wait, what?

6173
03:35:49,330 --> 03:35:50,510
What is he saying, Goomy?

6174
03:35:50,770 --> 03:35:50,770
Nothing.

6175
03:35:50,870 --> 03:35:51,590
I didn't say anything.

6176
03:35:52,890 --> 03:35:56,030
He said he was gonna kill us as soon as he touches the water.

6177
03:35:56,670 --> 03:35:57,090
I didn't say anything.

6178
03:35:57,090 --> 03:35:58,490
And stay on the main road.

6179
03:35:58,690 --> 03:35:59,050
Okay.

6180
03:35:59,430 --> 03:36:00,370
I'm coming to call him.

6181
03:36:00,370 --> 03:36:01,230
I'm gonna be on the roof.

6182
03:36:02,890 --> 03:36:03,850
See you soon.

6183
03:36:03,950 --> 03:36:06,070
I don't think he wants to make Uncle angry.

6184
03:36:06,370 --> 03:36:09,390
If we have the launcher, we could farm Bradley.

6185
03:36:09,390 --> 03:36:10,570
I have a launcher.

6186
03:36:10,970 --> 03:36:11,370
Oh.

6187
03:36:12,050 --> 03:36:13,050
You have a launcher?

6188
03:36:14,170 --> 03:36:15,290
I have a rocket.

6189
03:36:15,450 --> 03:36:15,590
Yeah, after we get the rocket, we can go home.

6190
03:36:18,550 --> 03:36:20,550
After the baptism, we can provide you the launcher.

6191
03:36:23,210 --> 03:36:24,210
Where is Uncle?

6192
03:36:24,530 --> 03:36:27,330
You're gonna give us weaponry for being baptized?

6193
03:36:27,950 --> 03:36:29,990
Yeah, that's the best part about this religion.

6194
03:36:30,250 --> 03:36:32,110
You can ask for anything you want.

6195
03:36:32,450 --> 03:36:33,750
Okay, what the hell is going on?

6196
03:36:33,950 --> 03:36:35,110
What is this damn religion?

6197
03:36:35,190 --> 03:36:36,090
This sounds too good to be true.

6198
03:36:36,230 --> 03:36:36,830
What's happening?

6199
03:36:37,470 --> 03:36:38,410
I'm telling you, Ellen.

6200
03:36:38,610 --> 03:36:40,850
Mr. Baby Billy gives us stuff.

6201
03:36:41,010 --> 03:36:42,350
Yeah, Mr. Baby Billy.

6202
03:36:42,370 --> 03:36:44,430
When you see Mr. Baby Billy, you'll understand.

6203
03:36:45,270 --> 03:36:46,690
They're definitely killing us.

6204
03:36:46,730 --> 03:36:46,990
No.

6205
03:36:47,090 --> 03:36:48,010
No, no, no.

6206
03:36:48,550 --> 03:36:49,150
No, we're not.

6207
03:36:51,150 --> 03:36:52,930
They're definitely going to kill us.

6208
03:36:52,990 --> 03:36:53,250
How?

6209
03:36:54,230 --> 03:36:56,050
They're gonna take your LR300.

6210
03:36:56,770 --> 03:36:57,910
No, it's not a cult.

6211
03:36:58,270 --> 03:36:59,070
You're gonna lose your gun.

6212
03:36:59,130 --> 03:37:00,650
Your precious gun, gone.

6213
03:37:00,750 --> 03:37:01,770
It's a fucking cult.

6214
03:37:01,830 --> 03:37:02,310
I knew it.

6215
03:37:02,310 --> 03:37:02,830
No, it's not.

6216
03:37:03,010 --> 03:37:04,050
There's only one religion.

6217
03:37:04,390 --> 03:37:05,870
A cult means there's more than one.

6218
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:08,670
They're going to take your LR.

6219
03:37:08,750 --> 03:37:10,590
We're not gonna take anything, we swear.

6220
03:37:11,110 --> 03:37:11,750
We're using this fish as well?

6221
03:37:13,310 --> 03:37:14,750
Give me the launcher now.

6222
03:37:15,030 --> 03:37:16,270
Show me the launcher.

6223
03:37:17,190 --> 03:37:18,010
Show me the launcher.

6224
03:37:18,550 --> 03:37:20,330
They're not believing, Gumi.

6225
03:37:21,050 --> 03:37:21,570
Oh!

6226
03:37:22,350 --> 03:37:24,430
Oh, they shot me!

6227
03:37:29,530 --> 03:37:31,010
Gumi, show him the launcher.

6228
03:37:31,130 --> 03:37:32,350
Gumi, show him the launcher.

6229
03:37:32,490 --> 03:37:32,930
You wanna see it?

6230
03:37:33,570 --> 03:37:34,950
You're gonna have to come over here.

6231
03:37:37,070 --> 03:37:38,850
They might have it over there.

6232
03:37:38,930 --> 03:37:39,510
I would go check.

6233
03:37:41,770 --> 03:37:43,870
They might have it over there.

6234
03:37:44,270 --> 03:37:44,790
I would go check.

6235
03:37:44,790 --> 03:37:45,470
Why don't you believe?

6236
03:37:45,470 --> 03:37:46,470
She actually has it.

6237
03:37:48,750 --> 03:37:49,270
See?

6238
03:37:49,270 --> 03:37:50,670
We would never lie.

6239
03:37:51,510 --> 03:37:52,870
We're just believers.

6240
03:37:54,450 --> 03:37:55,810
I told you.

6241
03:37:56,210 --> 03:37:59,530
I mean, we could kill Bradley with that launcher.

6242
03:38:00,270 --> 03:38:00,790
Yeah.

6243
03:38:01,090 --> 03:38:01,890
We could.

6244
03:38:02,230 --> 03:38:03,230
Who the hell is Bradley?

6245
03:38:03,250 --> 03:38:04,670
Who the fuck is Bradley?

6246
03:38:04,970 --> 03:38:05,930
The tank.

6247
03:38:07,550 --> 03:38:10,450
Are there people in the blood church right now?

6248
03:38:11,650 --> 03:38:12,690
Like Reinhardt?

6249
03:38:12,690 --> 03:38:14,290
I see someone running over.

6250
03:38:14,470 --> 03:38:15,370
He's coming over.

6251
03:38:15,450 --> 03:38:16,010
There he is.

6252
03:38:16,030 --> 03:38:16,630
I see him.

6253
03:38:16,810 --> 03:38:18,010
I didn't know they were running away.

6254
03:38:18,350 --> 03:38:19,030
There he is.

6255
03:38:19,130 --> 03:38:20,050
Straight south of us?

6256
03:38:20,070 --> 03:38:20,650
Let's do this backwards.

6257
03:38:20,670 --> 03:38:21,310
Is that the baptizing thing?

6258
03:38:22,730 --> 03:38:23,290
That's not great.

6259
03:38:24,670 --> 03:38:25,190
Yeah.

6260
03:38:25,730 --> 03:38:26,250
Yeah.

6261
03:38:29,710 --> 03:38:30,770
Where's Uncle Billy?

6262
03:38:31,870 --> 03:38:33,190
Where is Ryan Bird?

6263
03:38:33,590 --> 03:38:34,070
I don't know where he is.

6264
03:38:34,510 --> 03:38:37,210
I think Ryan Bird is picking him up.

6265
03:38:37,530 --> 03:38:37,910
Oh yeah.

6266
03:38:38,410 --> 03:38:40,470
Maybe we should chat.

6267
03:38:40,550 --> 03:38:41,010
Message.

6268
03:38:42,270 --> 03:38:44,510
Because I don't know how long we can keep them here.

6269
03:38:44,750 --> 03:38:46,150
I think they're getting antsy.

6270
03:38:46,430 --> 03:38:49,990
I think they're getting antsy right now.

6271
03:38:50,090 --> 03:38:50,650
I think they're getting antsy right now.

6272
03:38:50,670 --> 03:38:51,850
I'm getting antsy.

6273
03:38:51,850 --> 03:38:52,770
I think we should just leave them.

6274
03:38:55,410 --> 03:38:56,670
They're getting antsy.

6275
03:38:56,690 --> 03:38:58,350
I feel like they might shoot at any moment.

6276
03:38:58,430 --> 03:38:59,310
I'm scared, Gumi.

6277
03:38:59,630 --> 03:39:02,590
Do you think we should just leave?

6278
03:39:02,730 --> 03:39:03,870
Oh no, no, no.

6279
03:39:03,910 --> 03:39:06,210
But we brought these people for Uncle Baby Billy.

6280
03:39:06,750 --> 03:39:07,810
Can't just leave them.

6281
03:39:08,030 --> 03:39:09,650
Uncle Baby Billy's not even showing up.

6282
03:39:10,930 --> 03:39:12,350
Where is Uncle Baby Billy?

6283
03:39:12,630 --> 03:39:14,770
Just type in the chat asking where he is.

6284
03:39:15,330 --> 03:39:16,650
Just type in the chat.

6285
03:39:17,610 --> 03:39:18,050
Okay.

6286
03:39:18,050 --> 03:39:19,110
Uncle...

6287
03:39:21,050 --> 03:39:21,650
Billy...

6288
03:39:21,650 --> 03:39:23,050
Our new followers.

6289
03:39:23,470 --> 03:39:25,050
They're getting antsy.

6290
03:39:37,300 --> 03:39:38,220
Oh my god.

6291
03:39:39,740 --> 03:39:41,220
There's a shack over here.

6292
03:39:41,440 --> 03:39:41,820
There's a shack?

6293
03:39:41,880 --> 03:39:42,460
Is there free food?

6294
03:39:45,820 --> 03:39:47,060
There's a bunch of nothing.

6295
03:39:47,480 --> 03:39:48,200
Their conviction.

6296
03:39:48,760 --> 03:39:49,980
It's wavering.

6297
03:39:51,400 --> 03:39:52,700
They're losing faith.

6298
03:39:53,080 --> 03:39:53,940
They're losing faith.

6299
03:39:54,520 --> 03:39:56,120
How could they lose faith?

6300
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:58,260
Oh no.

6301
03:39:58,420 --> 03:39:58,560
Hallelujah.

6302
03:39:58,840 --> 03:40:00,940
They have to leave.

6303
03:40:02,860 --> 03:40:04,200
Okay, you have to make me a cell phone.

6304
03:40:04,240 --> 03:40:05,400
You forgot to make me a cell phone.

6305
03:40:08,240 --> 03:40:10,160
This cell phone material is hard to get.

6306
03:40:14,900 --> 03:40:16,320
Oh no, I'm actually starving.

6307
03:40:17,780 --> 03:40:19,460
Yeah, I'm actually starving too.

6308
03:40:20,020 --> 03:40:21,720
No, Uncle Baby Billy.

6309
03:40:22,180 --> 03:40:24,140
We can't do another baptism.

6310
03:40:24,140 --> 03:40:27,900
We lost new members from the church.

6311
03:40:30,960 --> 03:40:32,160
Where are you?

6312
03:40:32,300 --> 03:40:33,980
We gotta go to Rusty Bones soon, Gumi.

6313
03:40:34,280 --> 03:40:36,040
Probably someone's been kidnapped.

6314
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:37,660
Who's been kidnapped?

6315
03:40:38,120 --> 03:40:40,740
I think Uncle Baby Billy isn't showing up.

6316
03:40:41,120 --> 03:40:42,500
I can't believe it.

6317
03:40:42,660 --> 03:40:44,640
The guy we believed in.

6318
03:40:44,700 --> 03:40:47,300
Do you think he was a fake all along, Gumi?

6319
03:40:49,900 --> 03:40:51,820
No, we can't say that.

6320
03:40:52,920 --> 03:40:53,560
But...

6321
03:40:53,560 --> 03:40:54,120
We can't say that.

6322
03:40:54,120 --> 03:40:56,360
He didn't show up when we needed him the most.

6323
03:40:58,260 --> 03:40:59,600
Wait, he's walking over.

6324
03:40:59,760 --> 03:41:01,060
Oh, he's coming over!

6325
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:03,680
Wait, he's here!

6326
03:41:03,800 --> 03:41:04,320
He's here!

6327
03:41:04,700 --> 03:41:05,840
He's coming over!

6328
03:41:06,760 --> 03:41:08,220
Wait, he's walking to the church.

6329
03:41:08,320 --> 03:41:09,260
We are not at the church.

6330
03:41:14,520 --> 03:41:15,760
I knew it.

6331
03:41:15,820 --> 03:41:17,920
Hey guys, it looks like it might be...

6332
03:41:19,060 --> 03:41:19,940
He's here!

6333
03:41:19,960 --> 03:41:20,440
He's here!

6334
03:41:21,140 --> 03:41:23,260
Oh my god, I knew it!

6335
03:41:24,120 --> 03:41:24,260
He's here!

6336
03:41:24,840 --> 03:41:27,160
I think I gotta get going.

6337
03:41:27,360 --> 03:41:29,120
My faith did it on Weaver!

6338
03:41:29,160 --> 03:41:30,120
We gotta get to that.

6339
03:41:31,860 --> 03:41:34,340
That train yard crate is looking pretty juicy.

6340
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:37,600
That train yard crate looks really cool actually.

6341
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:39,860
I see him, he's walking!

6342
03:41:40,320 --> 03:41:42,420
Do you actually see him, Gumi?

6343
03:41:42,560 --> 03:41:42,920
You're like...

6344
03:41:42,920 --> 03:41:44,040
Listen!

6345
03:41:45,140 --> 03:41:45,740
If...

6346
03:41:46,900 --> 03:41:51,160
Once Uncle Baby Billy's done with it, I'll drive you guys to the train yard.

6347
03:41:51,200 --> 03:41:52,540
I'll drive you guys there.

6348
03:41:52,940 --> 03:41:53,580
There's nobody there.

6349
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:56,240
Gumi, I don't see anybody walking here.

6350
03:41:56,240 --> 03:41:57,920
I think she's elucidating.

6351
03:41:58,180 --> 03:42:00,580
I don't think I see him.

6352
03:42:00,600 --> 03:42:01,080
I don't think I see him either.

6353
03:42:05,200 --> 03:42:07,140
Gumi, I don't think anyone's coming.

6354
03:42:07,260 --> 03:42:09,440
I'm gonna go to the train yard crate.

6355
03:42:09,520 --> 03:42:11,040
I think she left us.

6356
03:42:11,460 --> 03:42:15,960
Yeah, I think she just...

6357
03:42:15,960 --> 03:42:20,220
She like drove away from us.

6358
03:42:20,400 --> 03:42:21,000
Oh my god!

6359
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:21,440
Oh my god!

6360
03:42:21,800 --> 03:42:22,740
Wait, is that him?

6361
03:42:22,940 --> 03:42:24,020
That could be him actually.

6362
03:42:24,360 --> 03:42:25,580
That could be him.

6363
03:42:27,980 --> 03:42:29,360
I think that's someone else.

6364
03:42:29,600 --> 03:42:30,280
Who is that?

6365
03:42:31,260 --> 03:42:33,800
The crate looking kinda good, don't you think, Gellum?

6366
03:42:33,980 --> 03:42:35,320
Oh my god, look at that bear though.

6367
03:42:37,720 --> 03:42:39,640
Yeah, that's the train yard crate.

6368
03:42:39,740 --> 03:42:40,180
Am I right?

6369
03:42:41,300 --> 03:42:42,140
Oh wait, no.

6370
03:42:42,180 --> 03:42:43,880
Gumi's actually picking somebody up.

6371
03:42:43,980 --> 03:42:44,220
Wait.

6372
03:42:48,090 --> 03:42:48,530
She's...

6373
03:42:48,530 --> 03:42:48,790
She's...

6374
03:42:48,790 --> 03:42:50,870
Gumi, please don't.

6375
03:42:50,970 --> 03:42:52,250
Gellum, I'll be honest.

6376
03:42:52,390 --> 03:42:53,250
That was a death trap.

6377
03:42:53,430 --> 03:42:54,910
Like, a million percent.

6378
03:42:55,050 --> 03:42:56,230
Oh my god.

6379
03:42:59,110 --> 03:43:00,090
They're right!

6380
03:43:00,630 --> 03:43:03,210
They left!

6381
03:43:04,090 --> 03:43:04,710
They left!

6382
03:43:04,710 --> 03:43:06,070
Gumi, they fucking left!

6383
03:43:06,790 --> 03:43:07,390
Gumi, they fucking left!

6384
03:43:07,390 --> 03:43:09,290
They're like, that was a death trap.

6385
03:43:13,850 --> 03:43:14,570
Gumi...

6386
03:43:14,570 --> 03:43:16,230
I fucking...

6387
03:43:16,650 --> 03:43:17,630
Oh my god!

6388
03:43:18,790 --> 03:43:18,970
Oh my god!

6389
03:43:19,490 --> 03:43:21,090
You just missed!

6390
03:43:21,310 --> 03:43:22,290
They ran away!

6391
03:43:22,710 --> 03:43:24,710
They didn't believe enough!

6392
03:43:25,770 --> 03:43:28,210
They literally ran away that way!

6393
03:43:28,670 --> 03:43:29,030
Oh no!

6394
03:43:29,730 --> 03:43:31,290
You just missed them!

6395
03:43:31,650 --> 03:43:33,670
Chase after them and give them some faith!

6396
03:43:34,090 --> 03:43:36,190
They just didn't believe enough!

6397
03:43:36,490 --> 03:43:36,890
Uncle!

6398
03:43:37,410 --> 03:43:39,990
Their faith wavered!

6399
03:43:39,990 --> 03:43:40,370
Oh shit!

6400
03:43:41,510 --> 03:43:43,490
They saw you shot the bear!

6401
03:43:43,850 --> 03:43:46,830
They saw you shot the bear and left because they got scared!

6402
03:43:46,830 --> 03:43:50,310
Oh shit!

6403
03:43:50,370 --> 03:43:52,430
I was bringing my favorite baptizing gun!

6404
03:43:53,270 --> 03:43:54,750
They got scared!

6405
03:43:55,050 --> 03:43:56,970
They saw you shoot that bear and ran off!

6406
03:43:56,990 --> 03:43:57,350
Uncle!

6407
03:43:57,490 --> 03:43:58,190
I don't understand!

6408
03:43:58,890 --> 03:43:58,970
Yeah!

6409
03:44:00,650 --> 03:44:01,090
Yeah!

6410
03:44:01,090 --> 03:44:01,770
Let's get them!

6411
03:44:02,250 --> 03:44:02,330
Yeah!

6412
03:44:02,930 --> 03:44:03,590
Let's get them!

6413
03:44:03,950 --> 03:44:04,290
Oh!

6414
03:44:04,550 --> 03:44:05,310
Let's do it!

6415
03:44:05,330 --> 03:44:08,270
I can do 20 baptisms a minute with this gun!

6416
03:44:11,470 --> 03:44:11,910
Gumi!

6417
03:44:11,990 --> 03:44:13,590
They ran that way across the river!

6418
03:44:14,170 --> 03:44:15,150
They said!

6419
03:44:15,490 --> 03:44:16,290
We gotta go!

6420
03:44:18,770 --> 03:44:20,350
They went that way Gumi!

6421
03:44:20,650 --> 03:44:21,610
To the right!

6422
03:44:22,970 --> 03:44:23,910
Step on it!

6423
03:44:24,830 --> 03:44:25,430
Gumi?

6424
03:44:25,730 --> 03:44:26,190
Oh no!

6425
03:44:32,110 --> 03:44:34,150
We can catch up to them!

6426
03:44:35,130 --> 03:44:37,170
How dare they leave the baptism!

6427
03:44:38,230 --> 03:44:38,830
Yeah!

6428
03:44:39,030 --> 03:44:41,810
They were so ready and they took our food too!

6429
03:44:43,590 --> 03:44:44,190
Yeah!

6430
03:44:44,250 --> 03:44:45,490
We sheltered them!

6431
03:44:45,750 --> 03:44:46,150
We'll get them until Baby Billy!

6432
03:44:46,830 --> 03:44:49,030
We sheltered them and gave them food and everything!

6433
03:44:49,290 --> 03:44:49,370
Oh they took our food?

6434
03:44:49,690 --> 03:44:50,050
Yeah!

6435
03:44:50,250 --> 03:44:51,210
And then they left!

6436
03:44:52,590 --> 03:44:53,470
Oh no!

6437
03:44:53,870 --> 03:44:56,650
Now if you take the sacrament you gotta get baptized!

6438
03:44:57,030 --> 03:44:57,670
Them's the rules!

6439
03:44:58,250 --> 03:44:58,990
Of course!

6440
03:44:59,550 --> 03:45:02,270
We fed them and everything!

6441
03:45:02,470 --> 03:45:03,950
I felt like they were using us!

6442
03:45:03,950 --> 03:45:06,470
I got something that's gonna help you baptize all of them at once!

6443
03:45:06,570 --> 03:45:06,970
Hold on!

6444
03:45:07,550 --> 03:45:07,990
Really?

6445
03:45:11,050 --> 03:45:12,650
Hop out of the car real quick!

6446
03:45:12,690 --> 03:45:13,370
I gotta give it to you!

6447
03:45:13,370 --> 03:45:14,250
Okay!

6448
03:45:14,770 --> 03:45:15,330
Okay!

6449
03:45:18,170 --> 03:45:19,730
Now this is a bomb!

6450
03:45:21,430 --> 03:45:21,990
Okay!

6451
03:45:22,130 --> 03:45:24,990
When you find them, they got a little fuse on it!

6452
03:45:25,030 --> 03:45:26,590
All you gotta do is click!

6453
03:45:26,850 --> 03:45:29,490
And it'll drop right in the middle of them!

6454
03:45:29,630 --> 03:45:32,010
And then you gotta get the fuck out of there!

6455
03:45:32,290 --> 03:45:33,190
Oh my god!

6456
03:45:33,190 --> 03:45:34,230
Before the baptism starts!

6457
03:45:35,010 --> 03:45:39,050
Is she trained enough to do the baptism, Uncle?

6458
03:45:41,110 --> 03:45:41,670
Yeah!

6459
03:45:41,670 --> 03:45:43,610
I believe that she is!

6460
03:45:43,750 --> 03:45:44,770
Uncle Baby, finally I see them!

6461
03:45:47,050 --> 03:45:48,550
I'm gonna baptize them!

6462
03:45:49,650 --> 03:45:55,430
Right before you drop the baptism device, you gotta say, It's baptism time!

6463
03:45:57,110 --> 03:45:57,950
What's in here?

6464
03:45:58,230 --> 03:45:58,890
Oh there they are!

6465
03:45:59,270 --> 03:46:01,050
Are you ready to get baptized?

6466
03:46:01,350 --> 03:46:01,830
Jesus!

6467
03:46:02,170 --> 03:46:03,270
It's the blood god!

6468
03:46:03,390 --> 03:46:04,070
It's the blood god!

6469
03:46:05,190 --> 03:46:06,610
I'm gonna get the baby!

6470
03:46:06,690 --> 03:46:10,650
And you said after you baptize us, you promise us to come home?

6471
03:46:10,650 --> 03:46:10,690
Yeah!

6472
03:46:11,670 --> 03:46:12,350
Oh shit!

6473
03:46:13,190 --> 03:46:14,170
Oh shit!

6474
03:46:14,750 --> 03:46:16,010
Is that an explosive?

6475
03:46:16,550 --> 03:46:17,410
Holy Jesus!

6476
03:46:18,690 --> 03:46:19,850
Who did that?

6477
03:46:20,270 --> 03:46:20,550
Jesus Christ!

6478
03:46:21,570 --> 03:46:22,170
Oh shit!

6479
03:46:22,610 --> 03:46:25,670
Uncle, I don't think you trained her enough!

6480
03:46:25,690 --> 03:46:26,150
Okay, pass them.

6481
03:46:26,270 --> 03:46:27,530
Where did you get those from?

6482
03:46:27,690 --> 03:46:31,150
It was the blood god!

6483
03:46:31,390 --> 03:46:31,730
Oh hell!

6484
03:46:32,030 --> 03:46:32,390
Oh hell!

6485
03:46:33,590 --> 03:46:34,110
Right!

6486
03:46:34,710 --> 03:46:36,070
The blood god is right!

6487
03:46:37,430 --> 03:46:40,270
Uncle, I don't think you trained her enough!

6488
03:46:40,670 --> 03:46:40,950
I knew that...

6489
03:46:41,670 --> 03:46:45,830
Uncle, I don't think you trained her enough!

6490
03:46:46,050 --> 03:46:46,990
Uncle, I don't think you trained her enough!

6491
03:46:48,250 --> 03:46:49,090
Oh shit!

6492
03:46:49,090 --> 03:46:51,170
This is Uncle Baby Billy!

6493
03:46:51,830 --> 03:46:53,550
No, he's a believer!

6494
03:46:54,090 --> 03:46:54,610
Hello!

6495
03:46:56,150 --> 03:46:58,150
My name is Uncle Baby Billy!

6496
03:46:58,350 --> 03:46:59,370
We can hear you a lot better.

6497
03:46:59,470 --> 03:47:00,190
No relation!

6498
03:47:00,710 --> 03:47:03,910
And I'm here to baptize you!

6499
03:47:04,630 --> 03:47:12,170
Now I have a baptism device that baptizes at about 30 shells per second!

6500
03:47:14,190 --> 03:47:15,750
Praise be to God!

6501
03:47:15,910 --> 03:47:16,070
Praise be to God!

6502
03:47:16,170 --> 03:47:16,730
I will baptize all of you!

6503
03:47:19,050 --> 03:47:22,350
I got baptized as a child, it's okay.

6504
03:47:22,450 --> 03:47:22,470
I got baptized as a child, it's okay.

6505
03:47:22,470 --> 03:47:22,970
Where you going?

6506
03:47:23,210 --> 03:47:24,430
Where you going?

6507
03:47:25,670 --> 03:47:28,170
Warful and triumphant...

6508
03:47:28,170 --> 03:47:29,550
Take cover and get out of there.

6509
03:47:29,870 --> 03:47:30,930
Take cover and get out of there.

6510
03:47:31,390 --> 03:47:32,170
Good call!

6511
03:47:32,750 --> 03:47:34,630
He ran down there, Uncle!

6512
03:47:34,810 --> 03:47:37,330
I got the next one.

6513
03:47:37,330 --> 03:47:40,510
I want to say that was a good effort with that baptism device.

6514
03:47:40,770 --> 03:47:41,310
I want to say that was a good effort with that baptism device.

6515
03:47:41,670 --> 03:47:43,490
You had a lot of enthusiasm.

6516
03:47:43,630 --> 03:47:44,790
I appreciate that.

6517
03:47:46,190 --> 03:47:47,770
It was just her first time.

6518
03:47:47,970 --> 03:47:49,070
It was her first time.

6519
03:47:49,950 --> 03:47:51,130
Yeah, we gotta...

6520
03:47:51,130 --> 03:47:53,510
Those baptism devices ain't cheap.

6521
03:47:53,570 --> 03:47:55,390
So we gotta go back and get you another one.

6522
03:47:55,570 --> 03:47:55,950
Okay.

6523
03:47:58,090 --> 03:47:58,730
Let's go!

6524
03:48:00,290 --> 03:48:02,090
I might even run someone over!

6525
03:48:02,490 --> 03:48:03,710
I might even run someone over!

6526
03:48:04,170 --> 03:48:05,330
Well, that's a...

6527
03:48:05,330 --> 03:48:06,950
We call that a road baptism.

6528
03:48:07,010 --> 03:48:08,430
Oh, a road baptism!

6529
03:48:08,850 --> 03:48:09,530
A road baptism?

6530
03:48:10,010 --> 03:48:10,950
That sounds fun!

6531
03:48:12,250 --> 03:48:13,290
Oh, God!

6532
03:48:14,050 --> 03:48:15,890
I can taste my teeth!

6533
03:48:16,230 --> 03:48:18,150
It's okay, we believed that we survived!

6534
03:48:18,430 --> 03:48:19,710
Uncle, we did it!

6535
03:48:23,210 --> 03:48:24,270
Gumi, I'm starving.

6536
03:48:24,630 --> 03:48:25,110
I see them!

6537
03:48:26,670 --> 03:48:27,450
Road baptism!

6538
03:48:27,450 --> 03:48:28,630
I gotta go to the restroom.

6539
03:48:30,830 --> 03:48:32,390
Go to the train yard!

6540
03:48:32,390 --> 03:48:33,310
Go to the train yard!

6541
03:48:33,430 --> 03:48:34,210
Meet at the train yard!

6542
03:48:35,330 --> 03:48:36,970
Go to the train yard, everyone!

6543
03:48:37,950 --> 03:48:38,890
I'll tell you what.

6544
03:48:39,930 --> 03:48:42,790
Drive into the train yard, I will be baptized.

6545
03:48:43,570 --> 03:48:44,050
Yay!

6546
03:48:45,150 --> 03:48:45,330
Really?

6547
03:48:45,690 --> 03:48:46,710
We get this crate.

6548
03:48:46,990 --> 03:48:48,590
I'll also get baptized.

6549
03:48:49,710 --> 03:48:50,970
I'll also get baptized.

6550
03:48:52,970 --> 03:48:53,730
Oh, Rudy!

6551
03:48:54,210 --> 03:48:54,950
Oh, my God!

6552
03:48:55,090 --> 03:48:55,910
New members!

6553
03:48:58,110 --> 03:48:59,310
We're doing our job!

6554
03:49:02,390 --> 03:49:04,350
We just got baptized today, Gumi!

6555
03:49:04,510 --> 03:49:05,670
And now we found new members!

6556
03:49:08,570 --> 03:49:09,730
I'm getting poisoning!

6557
03:49:10,250 --> 03:49:11,610
Wait, how are you getting poisoning?

6558
03:49:12,750 --> 03:49:14,090
I need to put on a shirt.

6559
03:49:14,350 --> 03:49:15,490
Wait, do you have like a...

6560
03:49:15,490 --> 03:49:17,730
Inside, inside the train yard.

6561
03:49:19,410 --> 03:49:19,850
Why?

6562
03:49:20,490 --> 03:49:21,550
Okay, get in.

6563
03:49:21,550 --> 03:49:22,690
Oh, shit!

6564
03:49:22,870 --> 03:49:23,890
You need a passcode.

6565
03:49:24,450 --> 03:49:25,210
Do you have food?

6566
03:49:25,330 --> 03:49:25,990
I'm like starving.

6567
03:49:26,170 --> 03:49:26,970
I'm like starving.

6568
03:49:27,190 --> 03:49:27,570
Do you have food?

6569
03:49:28,450 --> 03:49:30,690
No, I think Uncle Baby Billy ate it all.

6570
03:49:40,280 --> 03:49:41,520
I think my die.

6571
03:49:41,700 --> 03:49:42,380
I think my die.

6572
03:49:42,380 --> 03:49:43,220
I'm literally at one.

6573
03:49:46,800 --> 03:49:47,860
Where are we going?

6574
03:49:49,960 --> 03:49:51,400
Are you okay?

6575
03:49:53,260 --> 03:49:53,900
It's okay.

6576
03:49:54,260 --> 03:49:55,860
It's okay, you can repair the truck.

6577
03:49:57,360 --> 03:49:58,440
Oh, my God!

6578
03:49:58,540 --> 03:50:00,540
I have so many error codes just then.

6579
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:01,020
I have so many error codes just then.

6580
03:50:03,080 --> 03:50:03,860
Oh, my God!

6581
03:50:04,720 --> 03:50:05,160
Um...

6582
03:50:05,900 --> 03:50:07,960
Do you think Uncle Baby Billy is back yet?

6583
03:50:08,540 --> 03:50:10,160
I think he's like in a...

6584
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:11,480
I think he passed out.

6585
03:50:13,040 --> 03:50:13,620
Oh, wait!

6586
03:50:13,700 --> 03:50:15,980
He must be getting those premonitions.

6587
03:50:16,360 --> 03:50:17,860
From the Blood God right now.

6588
03:50:18,120 --> 03:50:19,260
Oh, like an oracle?

6589
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:19,640
Yeah, yeah!

6590
03:50:19,700 --> 03:50:20,900
He's getting an oracle right now.

6591
03:50:21,200 --> 03:50:22,820
He's getting a sign from the Blood God.

6592
03:50:23,100 --> 03:50:25,540
Oh, my God!

6593
03:50:25,600 --> 03:50:26,040
Hallelujah!

6594
03:50:26,940 --> 03:50:27,380
Hallelujah!

6595
03:50:30,680 --> 03:50:32,120
Where are we supposed to...

6596
03:50:32,120 --> 03:50:32,760
Are we supposed to be here?

6597
03:50:32,960 --> 03:50:33,660
I want to shoot someone.

6598
03:50:34,520 --> 03:50:35,940
I think I need to kill someone.

6599
03:50:36,140 --> 03:50:37,740
I think that's what the Blood God is telling me.

6600
03:50:38,060 --> 03:50:39,040
Wait, who are you going to kill?

6601
03:50:39,700 --> 03:50:40,420
A rocket?

6602
03:50:40,600 --> 03:50:40,800
No!

6603
03:50:40,920 --> 03:50:42,040
Why would I have a rocket?

6604
03:50:43,800 --> 03:50:44,480
I don't know.

6605
03:50:44,740 --> 03:50:46,920
I'm like... I'm literally going to die from starvation.

6606
03:50:51,080 --> 03:50:52,640
I'm just going to see if I can find food.

6607
03:50:53,740 --> 03:50:54,920
Oh, there's a balloon here.

6608
03:50:58,350 --> 03:51:00,210
I'm going to see if I can find food, you guys.

6609
03:51:00,430 --> 03:51:01,270
Or I'm going to die.

6610
03:51:02,290 --> 03:51:03,610
I'm literally going to die.

6611
03:51:05,370 --> 03:51:06,590
Where are the pumpkins?

6612
03:51:08,790 --> 03:51:10,090
I'm going to die.

6613
03:51:10,090 --> 03:51:10,130
I'm going to die.

6614
03:51:10,130 --> 03:51:11,890
I'm kind of thinking about coming over to...

6615
03:51:11,890 --> 03:51:13,050
I think...

6616
03:51:14,250 --> 03:51:14,810
Really?

6617
03:51:15,750 --> 03:51:16,770
What the fuck?

6618
03:51:16,770 --> 03:51:18,770
I just had a crew drive next to me.

6619
03:51:19,510 --> 03:51:20,070
What the fuck?

6620
03:51:20,070 --> 03:51:20,070
I just had a crew drive next to me.

6621
03:51:20,070 --> 03:51:20,490
Oh, no.

6622
03:51:20,650 --> 03:51:21,810
Where are the food?

6623
03:51:22,530 --> 03:51:24,010
Kumi, I'm 9 HP!

6624
03:51:24,150 --> 03:51:24,550
Kumi!

6625
03:51:24,970 --> 03:51:26,510
Don't worry, I'm begging for food.

6626
03:51:26,730 --> 03:51:28,410
You're begging for food?

6627
03:51:28,510 --> 03:51:30,330
Where are you begging for food from?

6628
03:51:34,530 --> 03:51:36,070
Just eat something.

6629
03:51:37,270 --> 03:51:37,730
Just eat something.

6630
03:51:42,060 --> 03:51:43,020
Oh my god.

6631
03:51:44,620 --> 03:51:45,740
Where are you, Kumi?

6632
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:47,760
He had no food.

6633
03:51:48,060 --> 03:51:49,160
Oh, Kumi.

6634
03:51:49,480 --> 03:51:50,540
I think it's time.

6635
03:51:51,660 --> 03:51:53,460
Wait, is Uncle Billy... Uncle...

6636
03:51:53,460 --> 03:51:53,860
Oh, no.

6637
03:51:53,900 --> 03:51:54,680
He's still AFK.

6638
03:51:56,620 --> 03:51:57,080
Hello?

6639
03:51:58,140 --> 03:52:00,360
Ray, do you have food, sir?

6640
03:52:02,040 --> 03:52:02,920
I do, yeah.

6641
03:52:03,120 --> 03:52:03,960
Oh, thank god.

6642
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:04,780
Oh, Will's here.

6643
03:52:04,900 --> 03:52:05,260
Hey, Will.

6644
03:52:05,380 --> 03:52:05,620
Yeah.

6645
03:52:06,040 --> 03:52:06,320
Do you have food?

6646
03:52:06,460 --> 03:52:06,780
Really?

6647
03:52:06,780 --> 03:52:07,280
Oh my god.

6648
03:52:07,280 --> 03:52:07,920
I was starving.

6649
03:52:09,800 --> 03:52:10,640
Thank you.

6650
03:52:10,840 --> 03:52:13,520
Thank you.

6651
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:14,800
I was just about to die.

6652
03:52:15,180 --> 03:52:15,700
Eat up.

6653
03:52:16,080 --> 03:52:16,820
Eat up.

6654
03:52:18,720 --> 03:52:19,780
Oh my god.

6655
03:52:19,960 --> 03:52:20,520
We lived.

6656
03:52:21,240 --> 03:52:22,600
We lived for another day.

6657
03:52:22,940 --> 03:52:23,440
Hello.

6658
03:52:25,680 --> 03:52:27,240
You want this, Harrison?

6659
03:52:30,340 --> 03:52:31,220
Oh my god.

6660
03:52:31,460 --> 03:52:31,940
Which one?

6661
03:52:32,360 --> 03:52:35,520
You only get that after you get baptized.

6662
03:52:35,520 --> 03:52:36,000
Oh, a better one.

6663
03:52:38,180 --> 03:52:38,700
Whoa.

6664
03:52:40,060 --> 03:52:42,800
Can I just say I love the block god and then...

6665
03:52:42,800 --> 03:52:42,900
Yeah, I can call Bobby Billy.

6666
03:52:43,180 --> 03:52:43,860
That's it?

6667
03:52:44,900 --> 03:52:46,540
Only after you get baptized.

6668
03:52:46,900 --> 03:52:47,880
You have to commit to a baptism.

6669
03:52:48,720 --> 03:52:49,240
Yeah.

6670
03:52:52,690 --> 03:52:54,430
You said I could do a...

6671
03:52:54,430 --> 03:52:55,310
What's it called?

6672
03:52:55,470 --> 03:52:56,050
A bro...

6673
03:52:56,050 --> 03:52:56,890
A bro baptism?

6674
03:52:57,610 --> 03:52:58,650
A bro baptism?

6675
03:52:58,850 --> 03:53:00,710
There's a... No, the road baptism.

6676
03:53:01,750 --> 03:53:02,890
The road one.

6677
03:53:03,090 --> 03:53:03,650
Yeah, yeah.

6678
03:53:03,710 --> 03:53:04,970
So he just has to stand there.

6679
03:53:04,970 --> 03:53:05,950
Ray.

6680
03:53:06,250 --> 03:53:06,630
Ray.

6681
03:53:07,110 --> 03:53:08,890
Can you make us a rocket launcher?

6682
03:53:09,530 --> 03:53:10,330
Yeah, yeah.

6683
03:53:10,430 --> 03:53:10,670
Come on.

6684
03:53:12,530 --> 03:53:13,370
Follow Ray.

6685
03:53:13,830 --> 03:53:14,390
Okay.

6686
03:53:15,390 --> 03:53:17,050
I guess we gotta bro them.

6687
03:53:17,410 --> 03:53:18,510
I guess we do.

6688
03:53:18,810 --> 03:53:19,370
Alright.

6689
03:53:19,970 --> 03:53:20,530
Goodbye.

6690
03:53:21,150 --> 03:53:22,630
Wait, they're getting chased by bears.

6691
03:53:22,990 --> 03:53:24,030
Or by boar.

6692
03:53:24,490 --> 03:53:26,130
Wait, let's watch Elm die.

6693
03:53:28,070 --> 03:53:28,630
Whoa.

6694
03:53:30,410 --> 03:53:32,810
Well, we can still watch Elm die.

6695
03:53:34,970 --> 03:53:35,830
We need food really bad.

6696
03:53:35,930 --> 03:53:37,730
We need food really bad.

6697
03:53:38,850 --> 03:53:40,050
We can still...

6698
03:53:40,050 --> 03:53:42,530
We can technically still watch Elm die.

6699
03:53:43,010 --> 03:53:46,270
We can still technically watch Elm die.

6700
03:53:46,270 --> 03:53:46,430
We can still technically watch Elm die.

6701
03:53:46,910 --> 03:53:47,770
Run, man.

6702
03:53:47,970 --> 03:53:48,750
Run, Elm.

6703
03:53:48,750 --> 03:53:48,930
Run.

6704
03:53:49,910 --> 03:53:52,350
Oh, God.

6705
03:53:52,550 --> 03:53:53,090
I need food.

6706
03:53:53,290 --> 03:53:54,850
Wait, we can watch him slowly.

6707
03:53:55,330 --> 03:53:55,810
I'm so weak.

6708
03:53:57,210 --> 03:53:58,390
Please don't hit me.

6709
03:53:58,470 --> 03:53:58,950
I'm gonna die.

6710
03:54:01,010 --> 03:54:04,490
I should have hit him again.

6711
03:54:05,230 --> 03:54:06,750
You should have done it, Goomy.

6712
03:54:07,010 --> 03:54:08,490
You should have done it.

6713
03:54:12,910 --> 03:54:15,710
Let me just spin around you, okay?

6714
03:54:16,330 --> 03:54:16,770
Let me just spin around you, okay?

6715
03:54:16,770 --> 03:54:17,670
Wait, are you actually gonna kill them?

6716
03:54:19,710 --> 03:54:21,390
Are you actually gonna do it?

6717
03:54:22,610 --> 03:54:23,230
Are you actually gonna do it?

6718
03:54:23,230 --> 03:54:23,230
Are you?

6719
03:54:23,370 --> 03:54:24,550
Are you actually?

6720
03:54:25,310 --> 03:54:26,930
Are you actually gonna do it?

6721
03:54:27,630 --> 03:54:28,750
Let's get some food.

6722
03:54:29,050 --> 03:54:29,630
Oh, okay.

6723
03:54:30,170 --> 03:54:31,730
Yes, for anyone but Elm, yeah.

6724
03:54:31,730 --> 03:54:31,750
Yes, for anyone but Elm, yeah.

6725
03:54:32,990 --> 03:54:33,950
Please, please.

6726
03:54:35,170 --> 03:54:35,990
Please, right.

6727
03:54:36,230 --> 03:54:37,830
I'm good on food, actually.

6728
03:54:38,850 --> 03:54:41,030
There's like 500 pumpkins down here.

6729
03:54:41,110 --> 03:54:41,490
Can I eat one?

6730
03:54:42,950 --> 03:54:43,430
There's like 500 pumpkins down here.

6731
03:54:43,430 --> 03:54:43,430
Can I eat one?

6732
03:54:43,430 --> 03:54:44,750
Do you even know where the door is?

6733
03:54:53,380 --> 03:54:56,040
Damn, Ray, you're so loaded.

6734
03:54:56,720 --> 03:54:58,240
Damn, Ray, you're so loaded.

6735
03:54:58,240 --> 03:54:59,620
He thought it was food.

6736
03:55:01,020 --> 03:55:01,500
Elm?

6737
03:55:01,500 --> 03:55:01,840
Hello?

6738
03:55:03,760 --> 03:55:04,380
Hello?

6739
03:55:05,700 --> 03:55:06,320
Hello?

6740
03:55:06,340 --> 03:55:07,100
We're coming.

6741
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:09,080
It's really small.

6742
03:55:09,320 --> 03:55:09,780
We're coming.

6743
03:55:10,140 --> 03:55:10,760
I

6744
03:55:14,820 --> 03:55:18,680
don't think they're gonna open the door for us.

6745
03:55:18,920 --> 03:55:19,080
I need pumpkins, too.

6746
03:55:19,540 --> 03:55:21,260
I need pumpkins, too.

6747
03:55:21,260 --> 03:55:23,020
I need pumpkins, too.

6748
03:55:25,780 --> 03:55:27,040
Face me, Billy.

6749
03:55:27,160 --> 03:55:29,460
I need another baptism instrument.

6750
03:55:30,040 --> 03:55:31,720
I need another baptism instrument.

6751
03:55:36,700 --> 03:55:38,900
I don't think they're gonna let you in, Gumi.

6752
03:55:39,040 --> 03:55:40,920
I don't think they're gonna let you in.

6753
03:55:41,200 --> 03:55:41,320
I don't think they're gonna let you in, Gumi.

6754
03:55:41,320 --> 03:55:42,400
No, they'll let me in.

6755
03:55:42,640 --> 03:55:43,260
No, they'll let me in.

6756
03:55:45,860 --> 03:55:47,240
Okay, I actually...

6757
03:55:47,240 --> 03:55:47,420
Okay, I actually...

6758
03:55:47,420 --> 03:55:48,040
How many food, man?

6759
03:55:48,120 --> 03:55:49,300
Because I'm starving.

6760
03:55:50,020 --> 03:55:50,880
Starving, I tell you.

6761
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:51,760
One moment.

6762
03:55:53,760 --> 03:55:55,640
Gumi, I need you to take me home.

6763
03:55:55,760 --> 03:55:58,040
I might have to leave soon.

6764
03:55:59,180 --> 03:56:00,120
We'll be right out.

6765
03:56:00,580 --> 03:56:00,980
Okay.

6766
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:03,820
We'll be right out.

6767
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:05,980
I think they're gonna kill us, Gumi.

6768
03:56:06,140 --> 03:56:06,620
I think...

6769
03:56:07,420 --> 03:56:09,100
Gumi, I think they're gonna kill us.

6770
03:56:09,520 --> 03:56:11,080
I think they're gonna kill us and uncle.

6771
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:12,800
I'm gonna...

6772
03:56:12,800 --> 03:56:13,760
Alright, Gumi.

6773
03:56:14,100 --> 03:56:15,400
You're gonna keep me safe, right?

6774
03:56:15,520 --> 03:56:16,780
Because I'm gonna call it here.

6775
03:56:17,780 --> 03:56:19,680
I think this is where my adventure ends.

6776
03:56:23,260 --> 03:56:24,940
Yeah, about that...

6777
03:56:24,940 --> 03:56:25,640
Wait, what?

6778
03:56:27,200 --> 03:56:27,880
What do you mean?

6779
03:56:27,880 --> 03:56:32,300
I need to drop Bobby, Billy, Baby, Bully, Billy, Bobby, Billy...

6780
03:56:34,360 --> 03:56:36,380
I need to drop him off.

6781
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:37,200
I need to drop him off.

6782
03:56:37,200 --> 03:56:38,120
Like, where did he go?

6783
03:56:38,220 --> 03:56:38,960
I think he's shitting me.

6784
03:56:39,020 --> 03:56:40,200
I think he's shitting.

6785
03:56:40,720 --> 03:56:41,900
Where did he go?

6786
03:56:43,240 --> 03:56:44,880
Where did he go?

6787
03:56:44,980 --> 03:56:46,560
Where did the uncle go?

6788
03:56:50,500 --> 03:56:51,220
I don't know.

6789
03:56:51,260 --> 03:56:52,800
I'm gonna drive us back to...

6790
03:56:52,800 --> 03:56:53,700
The church, right?

6791
03:56:53,940 --> 03:56:54,420
Another town.

6792
03:56:54,420 --> 03:56:54,860
Yeah.

6793
03:56:54,880 --> 03:56:56,520
Yeah, get us back to the church.

6794
03:56:57,200 --> 03:56:59,920
I'm pretty sure they were planning on killing us.

6795
03:57:01,260 --> 03:57:02,960
No, because I'm in the same...

6796
03:57:02,960 --> 03:57:04,660
Rusty Bones kingdom as them.

6797
03:57:04,860 --> 03:57:05,160
Yeah.

6798
03:57:06,120 --> 03:57:08,360
They may be planning on killing you.

6799
03:57:08,640 --> 03:57:08,980
Me?

6800
03:57:09,400 --> 03:57:10,560
What did I do?

6801
03:57:11,880 --> 03:57:13,280
You're not in the Rusty Bones.

6802
03:57:13,940 --> 03:57:15,460
Wait, but why would they kill me?

6803
03:57:16,860 --> 03:57:18,200
I'm literally with you.

6804
03:57:19,920 --> 03:57:20,840
Oh, hey, a horse.

6805
03:57:21,840 --> 03:57:23,020
Wait, they need a horse.

6806
03:57:24,840 --> 03:57:25,380
Hey!

6807
03:57:26,400 --> 03:57:27,140
Wait, what?

6808
03:57:27,260 --> 03:57:29,920
We have uncle.

6809
03:57:30,200 --> 03:57:31,120
We have uncle here.

6810
03:57:31,480 --> 03:57:32,580
Is Biddy in there?

6811
03:57:32,740 --> 03:57:34,380
I think he's shitting.

6812
03:57:34,820 --> 03:57:37,660
He's blowing up the shitter.

6813
03:57:38,380 --> 03:57:39,720
He's blowing that shit up.

6814
03:57:39,740 --> 03:57:40,400
I told you.

6815
03:57:40,920 --> 03:57:42,880
He's baptizing the toilet right now.

6816
03:57:42,880 --> 03:57:44,340
He's mad because of that meat.

6817
03:57:44,740 --> 03:57:47,640
We have to drive him home.

6818
03:57:51,180 --> 03:57:52,860
We can take him home.

6819
03:57:54,420 --> 03:57:56,440
We can take him home if he can get out.

6820
03:57:56,600 --> 03:57:59,500
Yeah, but he's still in the toilet right now.

6821
03:57:59,600 --> 03:58:00,440
He's literally shitting.

6822
03:58:01,360 --> 03:58:03,440
He's like OOC shitting.

6823
03:58:04,060 --> 03:58:05,180
Wait, there's a horse here.

6824
03:58:05,240 --> 03:58:06,380
You guys need more horses, right?

6825
03:58:08,480 --> 03:58:09,380
Yeah, we do.

6826
03:58:09,520 --> 03:58:09,600
We do.

6827
03:58:09,880 --> 03:58:13,020
You can take that horse all the way home and I'll drop Bobby Billy off.

6828
03:58:13,180 --> 03:58:13,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6829
03:58:13,800 --> 03:58:14,440
I'll take this horse.

6830
03:58:14,500 --> 03:58:15,340
Remember I-20.

6831
03:58:15,680 --> 03:58:16,820
I-20, okay.

6832
03:58:17,380 --> 03:58:18,760
Wait, no, that's not the church.

6833
03:58:19,940 --> 03:58:21,680
No, but that's where all your stuff is.

6834
03:58:21,700 --> 03:58:22,040
The garage.

6835
03:58:22,320 --> 03:58:22,680
Oh!

6836
03:58:22,880 --> 03:58:23,240
What?

6837
03:58:24,420 --> 03:58:26,600
I'll just put this at the church first and then...

6838
03:58:28,380 --> 03:58:29,320
Oh, thank you.

6839
03:58:29,480 --> 03:58:30,720
Yeah, yeah, I don't need a horse.

6840
03:58:30,900 --> 03:58:32,040
Have you guys met Chrissy yet?

6841
03:58:33,460 --> 03:58:34,760
Oh, hey Chrissy!

6842
03:58:35,780 --> 03:58:36,220
Hello!

6843
03:58:37,060 --> 03:58:37,080
Hello!

6844
03:58:38,500 --> 03:58:40,480
Gumi almost did her first baptism.

6845
03:58:40,940 --> 03:58:41,260
Chrissy is the one.

6846
03:58:42,700 --> 03:58:44,060
Yeah, I missed.

6847
03:58:44,680 --> 03:58:46,000
I should go pick someone up.

6848
03:58:46,480 --> 03:58:47,560
I'm sad I missed it.

6849
03:58:48,440 --> 03:58:49,700
Yeah, she missed.

6850
03:58:50,100 --> 03:58:52,860
She threw a baptism grenade and missed.

6851
03:58:52,860 --> 03:58:53,620
Can you give me a second baptism?

6852
03:58:54,160 --> 03:58:55,520
No, they left.

6853
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:57,220
Can you give me a baptism grenade, please?

6854
03:58:58,760 --> 03:59:01,300
I have one of these.

6855
03:59:01,780 --> 03:59:03,320
I have a baptism knife.

6856
03:59:03,600 --> 03:59:04,720
Baby Billy!

6857
03:59:06,200 --> 03:59:06,960
That's me.

6858
03:59:07,340 --> 03:59:08,280
Oh my god.

6859
03:59:08,300 --> 03:59:10,780
How is it like baptizing the toilet?

6860
03:59:11,180 --> 03:59:11,500
Oh!

6861
03:59:12,760 --> 03:59:14,440
Did you baptize the toilet?

6862
03:59:14,700 --> 03:59:14,720
No, no, no.

6863
03:59:14,720 --> 03:59:18,860
My little rat had to go outside and make a duty.

6864
03:59:19,060 --> 03:59:21,540
And then he got some duty in his little dog head.

6865
03:59:21,540 --> 03:59:23,580
That's why the wash is behind.

6866
03:59:24,080 --> 03:59:25,700
Oh, I see.

6867
03:59:25,800 --> 03:59:26,140
I see.

6868
03:59:28,060 --> 03:59:28,840
Oh yeah.

6869
03:59:30,380 --> 03:59:32,960
We found a horse for the horse races.

6870
03:59:33,200 --> 03:59:33,980
Good to see you again.

6871
03:59:35,960 --> 03:59:36,920
Oh yeah!

6872
03:59:38,180 --> 03:59:38,200
Oh yeah!

6873
03:59:39,560 --> 03:59:40,260
Oh yeah!

6874
03:59:40,260 --> 03:59:41,980
Can you add me back to the team?

6875
03:59:42,100 --> 03:59:43,380
We came to do that.

6876
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:45,060
And then we're going to go work on the tracks.

6877
03:59:45,240 --> 03:59:46,420
Oh yeah!

6878
03:59:46,460 --> 03:59:48,640
Sorry I took you off because you were sleeping.

6879
03:59:49,700 --> 03:59:50,420
Oh yeah!

6880
03:59:50,440 --> 03:59:51,520
Sorry I took you off because you were sleeping.

6881
03:59:51,540 --> 03:59:54,980
Baby Billy, I'm going to go drop Dokia so she can go sleep.

6882
03:59:55,280 --> 03:59:56,480
Oh yeah, you guys can...

6883
03:59:56,480 --> 03:59:57,340
Alright, y'all.

6884
03:59:59,160 --> 04:00:00,680
You going to bed, Dokia?

6885
04:00:01,280 --> 04:00:02,360
Yeah, I'm heading to bed.

6886
04:00:02,620 --> 04:00:03,860
I hope I see you again soon.

6887
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:06,360
Yeah, thank you for letting us join your religion.

6888
04:00:07,840 --> 04:00:08,280
Alright, y'all.

6889
04:00:08,280 --> 04:00:10,380
I had a great time for my first day.

6890
04:00:11,520 --> 04:00:12,600
I'll see you guys.

6891
04:00:12,720 --> 04:00:13,380
See you tomorrow.

6892
04:00:13,540 --> 04:00:13,820
Bye!

6893
04:00:15,100 --> 04:00:16,060
Goodbye, Gracie.

6894
04:00:16,060 --> 04:00:16,720
Goodbye, Rainbird.

6895
04:00:18,840 --> 04:00:20,060
Oh my god, that was fun.

6896
04:00:21,540 --> 04:00:21,660
I'm back.

6897
04:00:23,020 --> 04:00:23,900
God bless.

6898
04:00:24,160 --> 04:00:25,020
I thought you were gone forever.

6899
04:00:26,860 --> 04:00:27,880
Yeah, I was worried.

6900
04:00:29,080 --> 04:00:30,380
I was worried there.

6901
04:00:31,300 --> 04:00:33,260
Did you have a fun day, Dokia?

6902
04:00:33,360 --> 04:00:34,480
I had a fun day.

6903
04:00:34,700 --> 04:00:36,120
This was a good first day.

6904
04:00:36,640 --> 04:00:37,400
Bye guys!

6905
04:00:38,220 --> 04:00:38,740
Bye!

6906
04:00:40,460 --> 04:00:42,020
They were pretty fun.

6907
04:00:42,460 --> 04:00:44,060
I have another stream in an hour.

6908
04:00:44,120 --> 04:00:45,480
I got so caught up in the RP.

6909
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:46,680
Yeah.

6910
04:00:48,740 --> 04:00:51,120
Baby Billy said he expects you back on tomorrow.

6911
04:00:51,120 --> 04:00:51,520
Baby Billy said he expects you back on tomorrow.

6912
04:00:51,540 --> 04:00:52,200
Oh, shit.

6913
04:00:53,180 --> 04:00:54,520
I don't want to disappoint...

6914
04:00:55,460 --> 04:00:56,420
the uncle.

6915
04:00:57,580 --> 04:01:00,140
Yeah, you would never disappoint Uncle Baby Billy, would you?

6916
04:01:00,300 --> 04:01:00,580
Yeah.

6917
04:01:00,760 --> 04:01:02,700
I feel like he'd shoot me if I don't...

6918
04:01:02,700 --> 04:01:05,560
That was a scientist.

6919
04:01:06,120 --> 04:01:06,660
That was a scientist.

6920
04:01:07,400 --> 04:01:07,880
Okay.

6921
04:01:08,320 --> 04:01:10,100
I don't have a gun now.

6922
04:01:11,440 --> 04:01:13,200
No, they get mad at anyone.

6923
04:01:13,520 --> 04:01:14,020
Oh, okay.

6924
04:01:14,220 --> 04:01:16,640
I was like, where did he come from?

6925
04:01:17,920 --> 04:01:18,400
Yay!

6926
04:01:19,020 --> 04:01:20,980
Now you just gotta be safe in your garage.

6927
04:01:21,920 --> 04:01:22,780
Uh-huh.

6928
04:01:22,920 --> 04:01:25,200
And you made like a whole room for me too.

6929
04:01:27,040 --> 04:01:27,560
Yeah.

6930
04:01:28,200 --> 04:01:28,720
Um...

6931
04:01:28,720 --> 04:01:32,380
If you can wait a total of five more minutes, I can make you a room.

6932
04:01:32,640 --> 04:01:34,960
A whole room just for me?

6933
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:38,600
Yeah, a whole room with a fireplace in it if you want.

6934
04:01:38,860 --> 04:01:40,020
Oh my god!

6935
04:01:41,260 --> 04:01:42,540
I'm so excited!

6936
04:01:44,980 --> 04:01:45,940
I can even...

6937
04:01:45,940 --> 04:01:46,200
Guys!

6938
04:01:46,620 --> 04:01:47,140
See?

6939
04:01:47,360 --> 04:01:49,180
I am not a freeloader.

6940
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:50,820
I'm not squatting.

6941
04:01:51,540 --> 04:01:52,800
I earned my place.

6942
04:01:53,200 --> 04:01:53,600
Well...

6943
04:01:53,600 --> 04:01:57,160
We got baptized together, Gumi!

6944
04:01:58,420 --> 04:01:59,220
Yeah...

6945
04:01:59,220 --> 04:02:00,860
I guess we also...

6946
04:02:00,860 --> 04:02:02,360
E-Rob got baptized too.

6947
04:02:02,400 --> 04:02:04,860
Yeah, we got baptized with E-Rob!

6948
04:02:08,040 --> 04:02:11,680
I think my favorite part is your baptism grenade.

6949
04:02:16,440 --> 04:02:18,040
Oh shit!

6950
04:02:19,800 --> 04:02:20,760
But that...

6951
04:02:20,760 --> 04:02:22,820
You know it was good effort.

6952
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:25,520
The baptism grenade was...

6953
04:02:25,520 --> 04:02:27,220
Was good effort there.

6954
04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:30,220
Dude, I didn't expect it to go flying like that.

6955
04:02:30,260 --> 04:02:31,300
There was so much momentum.

6956
04:02:31,420 --> 04:02:32,060
It rolled down the hill.

6957
04:02:33,520 --> 04:02:36,460
I can't believe it rolled down the hill.

6958
04:02:36,740 --> 04:02:37,540
That was crazy.

6959
04:02:38,460 --> 04:02:39,480
And then...

6960
04:02:39,480 --> 04:02:42,220
I think he was trying to tell me that...

6961
04:02:42,220 --> 04:02:43,980
I had to pull the trigger but I was like...

6962
04:02:43,980 --> 04:02:45,520
Why is this shit blowing up?

6963
04:02:45,540 --> 04:02:46,320
I don't know.

6964
04:02:49,280 --> 04:02:50,680
Oh my god.

6965
04:02:50,900 --> 04:02:51,500
Oh my god.

6966
04:02:52,480 --> 04:02:53,220
Oh my god.

6967
04:02:53,600 --> 04:02:54,560
We're almost there.

6968
04:02:54,740 --> 04:02:55,340
We're almost there.

6969
04:02:58,780 --> 04:02:59,940
We're almost there.

6970
04:03:00,160 --> 04:03:01,900
I'm gonna go drink some water.

6971
04:03:02,200 --> 04:03:03,900
Oh, that's an empty water bottle.

6972
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:07,500
I have so much water bottles from...

6973
04:03:08,500 --> 04:03:09,700
I have so much water bottles from...

6974
04:03:09,700 --> 04:03:10,060
From today.

6975
04:03:10,860 --> 04:03:12,320
Yeah, I want those.

6976
04:03:12,760 --> 04:03:13,000
Yeah, I want those.

6977
04:03:13,880 --> 04:03:15,380
I'm always starving though.

6978
04:03:18,780 --> 04:03:19,220
I'm starving.

6979
04:03:19,420 --> 04:03:21,840
Well, you're only starving because we died multiple times.

6980
04:03:21,860 --> 04:03:23,780
And each time you eat food, it gets cancelled out.

6981
04:03:24,160 --> 04:03:26,400
No, we died like one time.

6982
04:03:26,700 --> 04:03:27,860
Oh, two times.

6983
04:03:27,920 --> 04:03:29,500
The baptism and the...

6984
04:03:30,160 --> 04:03:32,140
And the other one where we had to get...

6985
04:03:32,140 --> 04:03:32,760
Your car.

6986
04:03:33,900 --> 04:03:34,340
Yeah.

6987
04:03:35,080 --> 04:03:36,360
That was a fun day though.

6988
04:03:36,920 --> 04:03:38,380
Is this what it's like every day?

6989
04:03:39,080 --> 04:03:40,840
Yeah, it is like that every day.

6990
04:03:41,060 --> 04:03:42,700
What did you do yesterday on the server?

6991
04:03:43,900 --> 04:03:44,720
Oh, you see?

6992
04:03:44,960 --> 04:03:46,240
I logged on late.

6993
04:03:46,540 --> 04:03:47,040
Yeah?

6994
04:03:47,320 --> 04:03:49,600
I think I was also doing...

6995
04:03:49,600 --> 04:03:50,900
Oh, we're here.

6996
04:03:52,140 --> 04:03:53,180
You're also doing what?

6997
04:03:53,660 --> 04:03:54,740
Pull up in the back.

6998
04:04:00,120 --> 04:04:01,380
Wait, this is the wrong side.

6999
04:04:03,340 --> 04:04:04,100
There we go.

7000
04:04:11,400 --> 04:04:11,900
Alright.

7001
04:04:13,180 --> 04:04:13,680
Woah!

7002
04:04:15,280 --> 04:04:15,780
Woah!

7003
04:04:15,780 --> 04:04:16,280
Woah!

7004
04:04:16,620 --> 04:04:17,080
Woah!

7005
04:04:17,640 --> 04:04:17,900
Woah!

7006
04:04:17,900 --> 04:04:17,900
Woah!

7007
04:04:18,860 --> 04:04:19,480
I'm okay.

7008
04:04:21,820 --> 04:04:22,900
Is there light in here?

7009
04:04:23,100 --> 04:04:25,900
Do you want me to build you a room or do you want to just sit down here?

7010
04:04:26,160 --> 04:04:26,880
I want a room.

7011
04:04:27,700 --> 04:04:29,500
I want my very own room.

7012
04:04:30,040 --> 04:04:31,360
I want to feel like I belong.

7013
04:04:33,440 --> 04:04:34,980
Damn, that map is really...

7014
04:04:35,420 --> 04:04:36,200
really got you.

7015
04:04:38,680 --> 04:04:39,840
Okay, stay right there.

7016
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:42,160
Let me go get the tools to build you a room.

7017
04:04:42,780 --> 04:04:44,520
I'll build it right next to the garage.

7018
04:04:45,600 --> 04:04:46,000
Yay!

7019
04:04:49,640 --> 04:04:50,900
Wait, so what happened yesterday?

7020
04:04:51,100 --> 04:04:52,060
You didn't finish your story.

7021
04:04:52,700 --> 04:04:53,940
I don't even remember, dude.

7022
04:04:54,040 --> 04:04:55,180
There's so much that happens every day.

7023
04:04:56,020 --> 04:04:56,700
Like yesterday?

7024
04:04:56,900 --> 04:04:59,560
You said that you logged on late and then...

7025
04:04:59,980 --> 04:05:00,900
I don't remember.

7026
04:05:01,120 --> 04:05:02,420
I just went on many trips.

7027
04:05:02,500 --> 04:05:03,340
I got a free gun.

7028
04:05:03,420 --> 04:05:04,180
I got a cell phone.

7029
04:05:04,240 --> 04:05:05,020
I got mugged.

7030
04:05:05,040 --> 04:05:05,460
Oh yeah!

7031
04:05:05,620 --> 04:05:06,600
Yeah, a cell phone.

7032
04:05:07,260 --> 04:05:08,460
You think I need a cell phone?

7033
04:05:10,220 --> 04:05:10,600
Yeah.

7034
04:05:14,940 --> 04:05:15,320
Um...

7035
04:05:15,900 --> 04:05:16,940
Where's my blueprint?

7036
04:05:18,760 --> 04:05:19,640
Kazoo, hi!

7037
04:05:19,900 --> 04:05:20,560
Hi, Kazoo!

7038
04:05:21,620 --> 04:05:22,060
Hello.

7039
04:05:22,320 --> 04:05:23,460
Are you knocking on the fucking door?

7040
04:05:23,600 --> 04:05:23,900
Yeah.

7041
04:05:26,180 --> 04:05:27,840
Careful, Mr. Pickles is in here.

7042
04:05:27,920 --> 04:05:28,820
You don't know what he might do.

7043
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:29,560
Oh, shit.

7044
04:05:30,260 --> 04:05:30,960
Oh, shit.

7045
04:05:32,660 --> 04:05:33,500
Don't tell him.

7046
04:05:33,780 --> 04:05:35,040
Don't tell him I'm here.

7047
04:05:37,400 --> 04:05:40,980
I thought you were living alone, so I was just fucking with you.

7048
04:05:41,140 --> 04:05:42,160
Oh, he's here.

7049
04:05:42,540 --> 04:05:43,480
Oh no, wait!

7050
04:05:43,600 --> 04:05:44,880
No, the door is locked!

7051
04:05:45,120 --> 04:05:46,540
No, I can't get back inside!

7052
04:05:48,740 --> 04:05:50,680
Alright, let's make it your little room.

7053
04:05:51,460 --> 04:05:52,020
Yay!

7054
04:05:54,040 --> 04:05:54,920
Hi, Kazoo!

7055
04:05:55,520 --> 04:05:56,660
Is that you?

7056
04:05:57,340 --> 04:05:57,900
Yeah.

7057
04:05:59,660 --> 04:06:00,220
Um...

7058
04:06:02,740 --> 04:06:04,020
My little house!

7059
04:06:13,400 --> 04:06:14,740
You gotta move.

7060
04:06:14,840 --> 04:06:15,580
I can't build it.

7061
04:06:15,640 --> 04:06:15,980
There we go.

7062
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:16,500
Yay!

7063
04:06:16,860 --> 04:06:18,060
Is this gonna be my house?

7064
04:06:18,740 --> 04:06:20,520
This is gonna be your little room.

7065
04:06:20,800 --> 04:06:22,020
My little room?

7066
04:06:22,020 --> 04:06:23,500
I don't have to pay rent, right?

7067
04:06:24,400 --> 04:06:25,380
Oh, you will.

7068
04:06:25,540 --> 04:06:26,160
Wait, what?

7069
04:06:26,380 --> 04:06:27,260
But I'm poor.

7070
04:06:27,920 --> 04:06:29,360
Oh, no matter.

7071
04:06:30,220 --> 04:06:32,560
I can provide for other means.

7072
04:06:33,660 --> 04:06:34,880
I don't want it.

7073
04:06:35,820 --> 04:06:37,880
I didn't even tell you what my offer was!

7074
04:06:38,660 --> 04:06:39,460
I don't want it.

7075
04:06:39,600 --> 04:06:41,480
You don't even know what the offer is!

7076
04:06:42,260 --> 04:06:43,200
I don't want it.

7077
04:06:43,200 --> 04:06:44,980
I could've sang for you!

7078
04:06:45,080 --> 04:06:46,160
I could've done a little jig.

7079
04:06:49,620 --> 04:06:50,020
I could've done a little jig.

7080
04:06:50,140 --> 04:06:51,860
Okay, let's make this...

7081
04:06:54,480 --> 04:06:58,300
Here, I'll put a door on it and make the code 4343 if you wanna log off here.

7082
04:06:59,040 --> 04:06:59,440
43343.

7083
04:07:01,200 --> 04:07:01,600
4343.

7084
04:07:01,620 --> 04:07:02,700
Oh, 4343.

7085
04:07:02,820 --> 04:07:03,460
Okay, guys.

7086
04:07:03,660 --> 04:07:05,340
Chat, remember that code for me.

7087
04:07:05,760 --> 04:07:06,740
Cause I won't.

7088
04:07:12,420 --> 04:07:12,940
Oh, hey.

7089
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:14,740
There's me here.

7090
04:07:16,780 --> 04:07:17,860
Wait, what happened to my meat?

7091
04:07:19,920 --> 04:07:20,760
Did you take the meat?

7092
04:07:21,480 --> 04:07:21,960
What?

7093
04:07:22,060 --> 04:07:22,440
No.

7094
04:07:22,740 --> 04:07:23,960
What happened to the meat?

7095
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:25,720
What meat?

7096
04:07:26,080 --> 04:07:27,440
Did you just take the meat?

7097
04:07:27,920 --> 04:07:29,300
I don't have any meat.

7098
04:07:29,660 --> 04:07:30,260
Wait, what?

7099
04:07:33,440 --> 04:07:34,860
What happened to it?

7100
04:07:39,920 --> 04:07:45,300
Alright, you can go to bed inside that room and I'll fortify and nerf it in.

7101
04:07:45,900 --> 04:07:48,440
Do I just leave the game?

7102
04:07:50,080 --> 04:07:51,820
Yeah, you just quit out and that's all.

7103
04:07:52,060 --> 04:07:53,380
Alright, guys.

7104
04:07:53,700 --> 04:07:55,800
Say goodbye to the server.

7105
04:07:56,380 --> 04:07:57,940
Everybody, quit.

7106
04:07:59,040 --> 04:07:59,620
Alright.

7107
04:08:00,360 --> 04:08:01,260
GG's, Gumi.

7108
04:08:02,760 --> 04:08:03,340
GG's.

7109
04:08:04,520 --> 04:08:05,100
GG's.

7110
04:08:05,100 --> 04:08:05,540
That was fun.

7111
04:08:05,620 --> 04:08:06,300
Are you gonna keep playing?

7112
04:08:07,760 --> 04:08:08,340
Yeah.

7113
04:08:08,520 --> 04:08:10,260
I'm not streaming though.

7114
04:08:10,520 --> 04:08:11,840
Oh, you're just gonna hang out?

7115
04:08:12,800 --> 04:08:13,380
Alright.

7116
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:14,720
GG's, man.

7117
04:08:15,060 --> 04:08:15,800
That was great.

7118
04:08:15,900 --> 04:08:17,080
Thanks for giving me a tour.

7119
04:08:17,280 --> 04:08:18,400
Very last minute.

7120
04:08:21,140 --> 04:08:23,420
I'll see you later, Gumi.

7121
04:08:23,680 --> 04:08:24,500
Hope you have fun.

7122
04:08:24,900 --> 04:08:25,380
Yeah.

7123
04:08:25,620 --> 04:08:26,620
See you later.

7124
04:08:26,620 --> 04:08:28,000
Log on tomorrow for a bit.

7125
04:08:28,180 --> 04:08:28,560
Okay.

7126
04:08:28,760 --> 04:08:29,460
Before your stream.

7127
04:08:30,120 --> 04:08:30,600
Okay.

7128
04:08:31,900 --> 04:08:32,540
Bye-bye.

7129
04:08:32,580 --> 04:08:33,100
Let me know.

7130
04:08:33,340 --> 04:08:34,240
I want you to know.

7131
04:08:34,760 --> 04:08:35,240
Yeah?

7132
04:08:35,520 --> 04:08:39,460
I woke up perfectly, like, right on the dot when you messaged me.

7133
04:08:39,540 --> 04:08:39,960
Oh, wait.

7134
04:08:40,020 --> 04:08:40,440
Really?

7135
04:08:40,640 --> 04:08:41,200
The timing?

7136
04:08:41,340 --> 04:08:42,180
Oh my god.

7137
04:08:44,740 --> 04:08:45,220
Damn.

7138
04:08:46,460 --> 04:08:47,320
It was fate.

7139
04:08:47,480 --> 04:08:49,180
We were supposed to get baptized today.

7140
04:08:49,180 --> 04:08:50,560
Yeah, we were.

7141
04:08:50,660 --> 04:08:52,000
The blood god demanded it.

7142
04:08:53,340 --> 04:08:53,820
Alright.

7143
04:08:54,500 --> 04:08:54,980
GG's.

7144
04:08:55,140 --> 04:08:55,620
GG's.

7145
04:08:55,700 --> 04:08:56,180
Bye-bye.

7146
04:08:56,220 --> 04:08:56,680
GG's.

7147
04:08:56,920 --> 04:08:57,980
Bye, doggy.

7148
04:08:59,700 --> 04:09:00,180
Alright.

7149
04:09:00,180 --> 04:09:02,080
Huge thank you to Gumi.

7150
04:09:02,260 --> 04:09:03,680
Check her out on Twitch.

7151
04:09:03,760 --> 04:09:07,020
She's not streaming right now, but, like, for giving me a tour.

7152
04:09:07,480 --> 04:09:09,760
Super last minute for us and everything.

7153
04:09:10,940 --> 04:09:16,780
So, like, super huge shoutout to her for helping us out.

7154
04:09:16,960 --> 04:09:23,360
And I think, like, you know, I think it made it definitely a lot more fun touring around and meeting a lot of new people on the server.

7155
04:09:24,200 --> 04:09:26,160
We met a lot of new people today.

7156
04:09:27,580 --> 04:09:33,500
And interacted with some people that you know, we never would have had a chance to interact with if it wasn't for the rest server.

7157
04:09:33,740 --> 04:09:34,840
So I had a great time.

7158
04:09:35,180 --> 04:09:38,860
Anyway, guys, thank you for all the super chats and all the donations.

7159
04:09:38,900 --> 04:09:42,040
Guys, I'm sorry that I wasn't able to say thank you while we were streaming.

7160
04:09:42,760 --> 04:09:45,100
But thank you again for all the super chats, for all the new members.

7161
04:09:45,260 --> 04:09:48,880
We do have another stream in, like, in, like, 15 minutes.

7162
04:09:49,180 --> 04:09:49,940
So I'm gonna call it here.

7163
04:09:50,300 --> 04:09:52,800
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check.

7164
04:09:52,880 --> 04:09:54,420
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7165
04:09:54,500 --> 04:09:56,140
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7166
04:09:56,260 --> 04:09:58,200
Or stay up for the Kalao Tenjin.

7167
04:09:58,420 --> 04:09:59,600
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

7168
04:09:59,960 --> 04:10:00,620
Bye, guys!

7169
04:10:01,020 --> 04:10:01,380
Bye!
