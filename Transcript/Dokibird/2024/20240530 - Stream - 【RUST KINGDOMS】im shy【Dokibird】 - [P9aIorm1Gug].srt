I'm getting a tour guide.

5
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,140
I'm getting a tour guide because, like, I joined the server
and I was like, this is overwhelming.

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,540
Okay, so, because, like, okay, I'm joining in, like, very
late, by the way, to the server.

7
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,060
The server's literally going to be shut down in, like, two
days.

8
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,020
And I did get invited on launch.

9
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:29,520

looking at the like other streamers playing it.

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,100
And I was like, holy fuck, people are building mansions.

11
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,400
Mansions are already being built.

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,880

26
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:18,860
when you're at the wild West and then Like it's anything

31
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,060
I don't think I can I don't think I can do this by myself
Because at first I was like, okay, dokey be fucking brave.

32
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,400
You got this dokey.

33
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:58,280
You can do this by yourself You don't need a chaperone and
then five minutes before the stream started I cracked.

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,360
I was like, no, I do I need a chaperone I I need a
chaperone, please somebody.

Now I definitely need a chaperone.

40
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,760
I need an adult.

41
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,700

They might ask for you to die a couple of times for them.

221
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,680
Wait, why?

222
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,340

230
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,520
The Blood God disciple?

231
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Maybe.

232
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,140
Wait, wait.

233
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,640

234
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,380
Okay, if you stay inside and it might be safe.

235
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,100
It might be safe?

236
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,600
It's like a safe place?

237
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm running around.

238
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,740

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,680
Wait.

242
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,960
There's not really a safe place anymore.

243
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,100
You're telling me?

244
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,260
At this time of day, there's wars going on where like 40
people go to invade another base.

245
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,380
And then they're usually fighting in the middle of the map
and everything.

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,580
What?

247
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,920

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,980

250
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,160
Okay.

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,920
I'm just checking out the church.

252
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,220
Oh, thank god.

253
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,860
I think I'm starving and dying of thirst right now.

254
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,520
Wait.

255
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,220

You know I'm good for it, Gumi?

263
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,480
You know I can repay you.

264
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,500
I have a horse.

265
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,520
Your horse almost died?

266
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,340
No, I ditched that one and I stole another one.

267
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,860
So like, I have two horses now, technically.

268
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,060
Yeah?

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,800

Yeah, sure.

273
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll give you the horse as collateral.

274
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,760
I don't need horses, I'll be honest.

275
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,140
I have a car.

276
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,500
Yeah, but like, it's not the same as a horse.

277
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,480
The horse is cuter.

278
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,400
No, I actually have two horses, too.

279
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,240
Yeah, but my horse is orange.

280
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800

Guys Where is P9?

351
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,820
Chat Wait, that's so far!

352
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,020
Wait, no, that's not so far.

353
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,340
That's almost there.

354
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,660
Okay.

355
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,660
Oh.

356
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh, there's gunshots around me, Gumi.

357
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm scared.

358
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,580
Yeah.

359
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,180
I'm so scared.

360
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,060
Okay.

361
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,300
I'm slowly walking on the road.

362
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,960
Ooh, that's a nice bar.

363
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,440
Ooh, wow.

364
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,440
This is a nice town.

365
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,380
P9.

366
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,360
Okay, I'm on the road, so you might bump into me while I'm
walking on the road.

367
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,760
Well, I mean, I'm naked.

368
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,380
Why would they hurt a naked person?

369
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,020
Oh, do not go on the road.

370
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Girl, you just got killed.

371
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,620
Okay, but it was S-Fan.

372
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,720
So, like, it was...

373
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,340
You know, it's...

374
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,840
Maybe the other people are nicer.

375
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,140
Wait, why do I not go on the road?

376
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,840
Um...

377
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,040
There might be a lot of people that shoot you on the road.

378
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:19,880
Huh?

379
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,600
But I'm naked.

380
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,860
Okay, where are you?

381
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm on...

382
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,400
Uh...

383
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,040
R5?

384
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,540
R5?

385
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,980
Okay, I'm on my way.

386
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,240
Oh, there's a sheriff's office!

387
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,440
Yeah, that's not real.

388
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,240
Oh.

389
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,920
What do you mean?

390
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,280
What do you mean that's not real?

391
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,000
They're not real.

392
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,380
They're not...

393
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,300
Are you telling me that there's no laws here?

394
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,160
But...

395
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,480
But this is a town.

396
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,320
They have the thrifty cow.

397
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,460
They have the sheriff's office.

398
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,000
There was a bar earlier.

399
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,200
It's a trap.

400
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,080
Wait, is the sheriff's office a trap?

401
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,740
Okay, I'm here.

402
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm here.

403
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,460
I'm here.

404
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,280
Where are you?

405
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,680
Oh!

406
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,180
You're at R5, right?

407
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,780
Yes.

408
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,800
Oh, is that you?

409
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,080
Is that your car?

410
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,140
Wait, you're the wrong person.

411
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,640
Hello?

412
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,860
No, I'm here!

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,920

No, I'm not.

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,640
It's because my chicken can't fit.

419
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:32,900

Don't look.

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,130
Are we...

444
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,170
Are we getting chased?

445
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:29,810
Are we?

446
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,190

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:30,930
No, no.

448
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,830
Just don't look.

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,270
Oh.

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,950
No, there's nobody chasing us now.

451
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,610
We're okay.

452
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,190
We're safe.

453
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,170
Yeah, because I'm speeding away.

454
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,490
They would just shoot a car like that?

455
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,970
Yeah.

456
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,790
Oh, that's fucked up.

457
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,930
We're like innocent bystanders.

458
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,950
You should tell it.

459
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,670
Radiation poisoning.

460
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,410
Oh.

461
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,110
Re.

462
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,890
Radiation poisoning.

463
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,930
Hey, are you okay?

464
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:09,570
Um, you know how, um, uh, yeah, why am I getting radiation
poisoning?

465
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,430
Is it gone yet?

466
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,790
14 seconds.

467
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,310
Where did you take me?

468
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,130
Here, come here.

469
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:18,970
Okay.

470
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,570
Yeah.

471
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,850
You can have this, this.

472
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,570
Oh, oh my god.

473
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,270
Water, too.

474
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,790
Eat up and drink up in the car.

475
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,070
Oh, wait, I can...

476
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,450
Wait, you locked it.

477
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,110
Sorry, there you go.

478
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,110
How do I eat?

479
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,850
You can right-click it, or no.

480
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,990
Clicking your inventory.

481
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,230
Yeah.

482
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,970
Oh, okay, eat.

483
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,450
All right.

484
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:41,930
Nice.

485
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,030
Oh, nice.

486
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,010
And I get corn, too.

487
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,710
Oh, my God.

488
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,950
I feel so pampered right now.

489
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,270
That's my sugar daddy, guys.

490
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,850
That's my sugar daddy.

491
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,810
Dot, yeah.

492
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,270
Gumi, can I get some cash for the casino?

493
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,010
Oh, look out.

494
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,700
Yeah, don't talk about cash on the streets.

495
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,300
You know, it's what.

496
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh,

497
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,500
my God.

498
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,080
Are we going to your house right now?

499
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:24,720
Yeah.

500
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,860
Oh, my God.

501
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,200
Guys.

502
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,600
Let me just make sure we're going the right way.

503
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,280
Oh, okay.

504
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,180
Guys.

505
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:29,980
Guys.

506
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,140
Goom is going to take me to her house.

507
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,980
Put clothes on.

508
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,100
But that's what my sugar daddy like.

509
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,580
I like her naked.

510
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,940
Kumi said, if I stop wearing clothes, she'll lend me money
for the casino.

511
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,920
Hey, don't worry, baby.

512
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,300
I got clothes for you at home.

513
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,060
Oh, yeah.

514
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,280
Some from Victoria's Secret, if you know that.

515
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,440
Oh, yeah.

516
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,560
Oh, my God.

517
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,420
You have a whole gated community?

518
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,400
Girl, this is not the community.

519
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,220
Oh, okay.

520
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,640
Sorry.

521
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,920
But there is one.

522
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,180
I'll take you to it.

523
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,560
Oh my god.

524
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,200
Wait, how many houses do you have?

525
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,220
Yeah, about 20.

526
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:20,840
What?

527
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,220
Oh my god.

528
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,580
Guys, I scored one.

529
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,980
Oh my god, I'm set for life.

530
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,260
I can hear you.

531
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,220
As long as I look pretty for you, it's okay, right?

532
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,320
Oh, you see that?

533
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,920

719
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,680
Wait, why run inside?

720
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,920
Why run inside?

721
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
Did you not hear those gunshots just now?

722
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,040
No, I was too busy begging for money.

723
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,100
Welcome to the castle.

724
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,580
Whoa.

Wait, play the piano.

Let's start a band.

729
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,920
We should start a band.

730
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,840
Oh, my God.

731
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,000
We should start a band.

732
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,460
I think we sound great.

733
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,060
Oh my god, we sound so good together.

734
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,120
This barely a song.

735
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,060

737
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,760
But wait, did they build all this or was this castle here
already?

738
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,800
Castle is...

739
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,460
They built a castle for everything.

740
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,920
Oh, wait.

741
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,360
So, oh, so it was already here.

742
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,460
And then they just took over the castle.

743
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,500
Oh, because it's a kingdom!

744
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,280
Yeah, if you look over here...

745
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,520
So, Foolish is the king and Tina is the princess.

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,800
And so is Myung.

747
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,160
Myung is also a princess.

748
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,840
Okay, what are you in the castle hierarchy?

749
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,120

I don't have a gambling problem because I never started it.

863
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,280
Wait, can you take me to the casino?

864
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,260

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,440
Wait, do you know where the casino is?

867
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,220
No, I don't know.

868
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,240
Everyone knows where the casino is, Doki.

869
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,120
Not me.

870
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,900
I don't know if I can really head there because I have a
thing I got to do.

871
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,960
Yeah, wait, where's this?

872
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,420
People are going to be waiting on me.

873
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,540
So the casino is at the very tippy top of the map in the
safe zone.

874
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,100
Oh.

875
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,900
Casinos far north.

876
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,160
Where P2 was?

877
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,760

Yeah, it was up there.

879
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,780
The most way it could be.

880
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,040
Oh, my God.

881
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,120
It's that far?

882
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,320
I thought there would be multiple casinos.

883
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,260
There's, I know, like, another one somewhere.

884
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,560
It's also in the north.

885
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,880
What the fuck?

886
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,600
Why are they all in one area?

887
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,940
Uh, anyone see a man named Trousy?

888
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,320

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,680
You're going to have to say, okay, that was 50 scraps.

00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,440
That was 50 scraps.

966
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,420
I guess you're paying for the group, right?

967
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,900
You don't own any scrap?

968
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,320
Are you gonna pay for the group?

969
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,400

00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,920

982
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,720

1125
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,700
She gave me a guitar.

1126
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,540

By the way, it's one scrap per note, so I hope you have the
money.

1130
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,300
Oh, um, yeah.

1136
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,200
You said we can scam him.

1137
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,720
I thought you said he was a chump.

1138
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,520
I think he ran out of money himself, actually.

1139
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,660
You told me he was a chump, Gumi.

1140
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,840
I thought he was a chump, too.

1141

01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,060
You guys know the dick sucking tree story.

1352
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,160
Um...

1353
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,120
Hmm...

1354
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,000
Oh, you guys don't know about the dick sucking tree story?

1355
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,180
Now, you guys know about it.

1356
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,280
Um, I can tell you about how there were people.

1357
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:03,500
So, in my high school, since, you know, I went to an art
high school and everything, there are people who would have

1358
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,660
sex in the bushes.

1359
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,260
Oh, welcome back.

1360
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:09,820
She back?

1361
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,700
She just moved.

1362
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:22,660
Okay, anyways, so, because it was an art high school, we had
soundproof rooms and everything, People who, like, have sex

1363
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:27,300
in bushes or under the staircases or in the soundproof rooms
in our high school.

1364
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,500
And it was kind of freaky.

1365
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,440
Because, like, sometimes I would take naps in the soundproof
rooms.

1366
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,840
Because I would have an off period.

1367
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,180
But then I realized people would be fucking in there.

1368
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,900
So I got really uncomfortable and I stopped taking naps in
there.

1369
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:56,170
Um, well, you guys know, but there was a glory hole on the
third floor.

1370
01:10:56,190 --> 01:11:03,590
girls bathroom that was pretty cool that was the nicest
bathroom too which makes sense why there would be a glory

1371
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:07,410

Don't worry.

1498
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,350
Wood can stop gunshots.

1499
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,410

1500
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:55,930

1546
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:03,150
Uh-huh.

1547
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,550
If you look in the green boxes around there.

1548
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:07,070
The green boxes?

1549
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,450
They should be on the shelves.

1550
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:09,390
Oh, okay.

1551
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:11,330
Alright.

1552
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,310
Let's see.

1553
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:14,310
Green boxes.

1554
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:16,590
I see pickles.

1555
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:18,770
Oh, yeah.

1556
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:19,310
Don't eat those.

1557
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:19,870
Oh.

1558
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:25,130
Well, you could, but there's like a chance that you might
throw up.

1559
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:27,470
Wait, where are...

1560
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:29,070
I don't think there's any boxes here.

1561
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,370
Oh, here.

1562
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,070
I don't see anything.

1563
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:35,790
I just see, like, empty.

1564
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,150
I think it got looted.

1565
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,310
Maybe someone ate it all already.

1566
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,230
Yeah, someone else was hungry.

1567
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:48,710
The stores refresh every few minutes.

1568
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:53,230
So sometimes when you're going up to speed, somebody was
here three minutes ago.

1569
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,650
I said every few minutes, man.

1570
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,450
Okay, come here.

1571
01:23:59,230 --> 01:23:59,830
Where's here?

1572
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,850
Went to the back where the car's parked?

1573
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:06,990
Yeah.

1574
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:08,790
Come in here?

1575
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:09,870
What did you get in here?

1576
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:10,810
Oh.

1577
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,180
Press E on this?

1578
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:17,580
Yeah.

1579
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,760
And the random useless objects you get, like, stop signs
that say scrap or whatever, or, like...

1580
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,440
Beans?

1581
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,260
Yeah, beans.

1582
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,040
You can right-click and put it in there.

1583
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:30,860
Oh, okay.

1584
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,060
Then turn on.

1585
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:34,500
sheet metal?

1586
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:35,600
Yeah.

1587
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,740
Well, you have to put an input.

1588
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:38,520
Oh.

1589
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,060
Make sure you eat the beans first, too.

1590
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,300
Oh, okay.

1591
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,580
And then sheet metal.

1592
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:47,420
Metal blade.

1593
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,180
Should I put the metal blade there, too?

1594
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,180
Uh, you can.

1595
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:52,480
Yeah.

1596
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,600
You'll get plenty of those.

1597
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,080
Turning on.

1598
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,780
How long does it take?

1599
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:00,640
Oh, there it is.

1600
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,500
Ooh, fragments.

1601
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,060
Awesome.

1602
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,600
61 metal fragments?

1603
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:07,040
What do I do with the fragments?

1604
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,040
So that could be used to fix up your car.

1605
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:10,980
Oh!

1606
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:11,900
Or to craft stuff.

1607
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,620
That's a lie.

1608
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,340
What's the rope for?

1609
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,840
I could put the rope too.

1610
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,160
That's also a crafting stuff.

1611
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,980
Yeah, I'm gonna put stuff in there.

1612
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:28,480
So if it doesn't process with the stuff you put in there,
that means it can't be...

1613
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:28,860
Okay.

1614
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,300
I got stuff.

1615
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:32,720
Mm-hmm.

1616
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:33,500
Here.

1617
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:35,720
Oh.

1618
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,520
Oh my god, more scraps!

1619
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,120
Rich!

1620
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,360
Um...

1621
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,360
Oh, you didn't throw stuff.

1622
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,780
You can take whatever's spawning in here.

1623
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,480
Wait, where did my mace go?

1624
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:52,340
I actually threw it.

1625
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,900
Girl, I don't know where you threw your mace.

1626
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,540
Where did my mace...

1627
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,920
Kumi, I lost my mace!

1628
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,800
Yeah, I don't know where you threw that thing.

1629
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:06,320
Oh, it's here.

1630
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,000
I got it.

1631
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,820
I got it.

1632
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:11,720
Yeah.

1633
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,180
14 more scraps.

1634
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,460
Oh my god, I'm rich.

1635
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,140
I'm rich.

1636
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:20,520
There you go, kitten.

1637
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:21,900
Yay.

1638
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:23,660
Get in.

1639
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,220
Of course.

1640
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,060
I feel so pampered, guys.

1641
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,840
I'm learning.

1642
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,720
Now I'm going to take you to the casino, okay?

1643
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,080
The casino?

1644
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,620
You know the gun I gave you?

1645
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:38,980
Yeah.

1646
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:41,640
Yeah?

1647
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,360
Don't take it out when you're in the casino or in that area.

1648
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,740
Oh, because they'll shoot me?

1649
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:46,960
Uh-huh.

1650
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,260
Okay, I'm going to put that away.

1651
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,240
Alright.

1652
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:52,540
Yay.

1653
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,280
We're going to gamble, guys.

1654
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,240
We're going to gamble all of Gumi's money away.

1655
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,140
What?

1656
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,180
And we're going to win.

1657
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,600
Mm-hmm.

1658
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,380
We're going to win money.

1659
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,600
Oh my gosh, this is a huge map.

1660
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,060
Yeah.

1661
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,160
Let's see.

1662
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,280
Where are we?

1663
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,300
Holy shit, that's where I died.

1664
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:23,480
So all the way down there is team...

1665
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,060
What the fuck?

1666
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,280
What's the debris field?

1667
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:27,960
The what?

1668
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,560
The debris field on Team Rocket area.

1669
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:35,720
Oh, hey, they have a taxi service.

1670
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,320
Oh, yeah.

1671
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,100
A lot of places have taxi service.

1672
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,520
There's a lot up here, too.

1673
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,000
Oh, my God.

1674
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,060
How much is it?

1675
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:43,100
Oh, my God.

1676
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,220
I should have made you a telephone before we left.

1677
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,060
Oh, wait, yeah.

1678
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,180
I want to call.

1679
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,640
I can make you a cell phone so you can call me anytime in
game.

1680
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,220
Wait.

1681
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,940
Lots of scraps in these.

1682
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:53,320
Okay.

1683
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1684
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:55,040
Go ahead.

1685
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,700
Go get him.

1686
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:56,720
Oh, okay.

1687
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,520
I'll wait right here.

1688
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,160
Okay.

1689
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:00,560
Okay.

1690
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,040
I'll grab the scraps.

1691
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,240
It's gambling, man.

1692
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,940
I guess I'll lift a finger, I guess.

1693
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,360
Oh, Shay, there's the goggles.

1694
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,220
What's this?

1695
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:20,720
A spinning siren light?

1696
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,760
How do I put that?

1697
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,100
Ooh, I want to work.

1698
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,460
You have to put it on your house or car or whatever.

1699
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,780
Wait, can I put it on your car?

1700
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:34,880
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, get in, get in, get
in, get in, get in!

1701
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:56,560
I'm scared I'm so scared That was Iron Mouch's kingdom And
notice how we got shot at right away Yeah Yeah Yeah That was

1702
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:07,280
That was a little scary No one does that around The rusty
bone The rest What's that over there to our left?

1703
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,220
You see that?

1704
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:10,580
Oh.

1705
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:11,820
The left?

1706
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:12,520
Yeah.

1707
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,460
It didn't fully spawn in yet.

1708
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:16,040
But it was like fire and stuff.

1709
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,640
And I might have been Iron Mountain's castle.

1710
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,180
That's her castle?

1711
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,100
Oh my god.

1712
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,140
It has fire.

1713
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,860
Wait, are the castles like custom to each land?

1714
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,560
They're all the same castle.

1715
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,140
Oh, I see.

1716
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,660
I wonder like...

1717
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,680
Whoa.

1718
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,380
I'm sorry, I haven't met anybody new.

1719
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,960
Oh, hey, there's another bear.

1720
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:49,510
So, I'm sorry, there's nobody new here.

1721
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,490
So, this right here?

1722
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:52,050
Yeah.

1723
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:53,450
Is the gas station.

1724
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,890
You can also recycle stuff back in the...

1725
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,930
Oh, I see.

1726
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,010
I see.

1727
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:01,350
I'm getting a little thirsty.

1728
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:02,130
They're hydrated.

1729
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,330
Stay hydrated, everybody.

1730
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:04,730
Mm-hmm.

1731
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:06,310
Don't worry.

1732
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,810
I'll turn on the radio for us.

1733
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,330
If you look on the right-hand side, that's the Coliseum.

1734
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:15,490
Whoa!

1735
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:17,710
What's going on in the Coliseum?

1736
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,110
I don't know.

1737
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,670
Maybe we should check it out.

1738
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,470
It's on the other side.

1739
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,110
We should check it out.

1740
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:24,930
I want to watch.

1741
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:26,030
Okay, go ahead.

1742
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:26,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1743
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:27,010
Let's go.

1744
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:27,750
I'll drop you off here.

1745
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:29,190
Wait, are you not coming with me?

1746
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:31,570
Goomy?

1747
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,630
Goomy?

1748
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:36,510
Go get back in the car if you know what's good for you.

1749
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:39,330
But it's a Coliseum.

1750
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:41,350
What's the worst that could happen?

1751
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:42,990
They're not fighting in the Coliseum.

1752
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:46,130
There's no guns allowed in the Coliseum, so those are wild
people fighting.

1753
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:47,190
Oh.

1754
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:50,270
Coliseum leaderboard.

1755
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:53,130
No, they're fighting in here.

1756
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:54,970
Oh, aren't they?

1757
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:55,630

Before I even gambled.

1854
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,290
You better learn.

1855
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,510
You better learn fast.

1856
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:34,750
I'm learning.

1857
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:36,770
Mm-hmm.

1858
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:38,930
Alright.

1859
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:40,930

1861
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,800

1865
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:58,750
I want some.

1866
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:00,170
Did you lose all your money?

1867
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:04,410
She stole my money and then I lost all my money.

1868
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:05,850
I gave her...

1869
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:07,130
I gave you all that money.

1870
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:08,130
No, that's not true.

1871
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:10,550
I've scavenged some of them in the road.

1872
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:12,630
You just gave me some of them.

1873
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,250
I played music for a scrap.

1874
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:18,010
I worked so hard for it.

1875
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:21,350
I learned how to play the guitar for that scrap.

1876
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:23,730
Alright.

1877
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:24,670
Pick it up.

1878
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:26,130
It's on the floor.

1879
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:26,990
It's on the floor.

1880
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:27,730
It's on the floor.

1881
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,290
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1882
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:30,970
Yay.

1883
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:34,110
Yay.

1884
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:36,210
Okay.

1885
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:37,330
I should win now.

1886
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:39,910
There's no way.

1887
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:42,050
How could I lose?

1888
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:44,030
Luck would be on my side.

1889
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:49,270
Come on.

1890
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:53,690
Come on.

1891
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:56,570
Did I put purple and blue?

1892
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:57,710
I don't even remember what I bet.

1893
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:58,910
Purple and blue.

1894
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:00,610
Come on.

1895
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:03,730
Wait a minute.

1896
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:04,690
You won?

1897
01:37:07,330 --> 01:37:08,810
You won money?

1898
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:12,190
Okay, look.

1899
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,690
This is it.

1900
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,810
I would hit it big.

1901
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:19,810
The moment it hits purple or blue, it's over.

1902
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:23,790
The moment it hits purple or blue, I win everything back.

1903
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:30,380
It can't hit yellows like three times in a row.

1904
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:32,080
There's no way.

1905
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,600
Look at the wheel and look at the probability.

1906
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:38,420
Yeah, but like, it can't always hit yellow.

1907
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:39,880
That's true.

1908
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,940
It can't always hit yellow.

1909
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,320
There's no way.

1910
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,020
That's why I didn't bet on yellow this time.

1911
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,380
Wait, but you won money.

1912
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,800
Oh, this time.

1913
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:51,080
No.

1914
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:52,120
Come on.

1915
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:53,840
Purple blue.

1916
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,460
Purple blue.

1917
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:05,100
Oh, please.

1918
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,440
Oh, oh, yes!

1919
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,760
I did it!

1920
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:10,280
Ah!

1921
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:11,940
Wait, how much did I win?

1922
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,920
I won 54!

1923
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,460
I almost won back everything.

1924
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,340
I almost won back everything.

1925
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,520
Nine.

1926
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:19,940
Oh, my God.

1927
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:21,060
Oh my god!

1928
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:24,140
So this is how gambling edition starts.

1929
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:25,200
Yeah.

1930
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,120
I feel just like XQC.

1931
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:29,860
Let's see.

1932
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:30,920
There's no way.

1933
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,860
Happy has to be purple now.

1934
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,200
And then I'll put like one.

1935
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,980
I'll put two on red just in case.

1936
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:40,980
Oh my god.

1937
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,040

Okay.

2015
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:33,440
It wouldn't let me.

2016
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,260
Oh, I need a different fuel.

2017
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:38,780
Mine's like crude oil.

2018
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:39,920
I put some in.

2019
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,400
Oh, low-grade fuel.

2020
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:42,020
That's called low-grade.

2021
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:42,480
Come here.

2022
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:43,100

Okay, maybe I chose a wrong car.

Too late, I already used my stuff to fix it.

2031
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,240
Why did you encourage me to get this car?

2032

2139
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:57,960

2140
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:00,520
He gave us corn to give us corn.

2141
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,880
Oh, my God, they're so nice.

2142
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,160

Oh, my God.

2145
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,540
And I said, I thought I spoke to blood God.

2146
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:11,080
I said a prayer to him and it said, Fifth kills Myth.

2147
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,920
And they would say we was already on board with that.

2148
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,300
So Myth is being targeted by Fifth.

2149
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:18,580
And Fifth is already in with the church.

2150
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:21,360
And they hooked up and we, everything's good.

2151
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:24,640
I took care of everything today and Myth is still kill on
you.

2152
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,620
side, enemy number one, numero uno, Ichibon.

2153
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:31,460
Yeah, so listen, the myth problem is this.

2154
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:33,240
Myth, he horny for blood.

2155
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,880
Even hornyer for blood than the blood guy himself.

2156
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:43,160
You know, he a nice guy if you meet him outside the island,
but when he get AK-47 in his hand, he a liability.

2157
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,840
So we're going to let the fifth sort him out.

2158
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:53,940
But again, ladies and gentlemen, as I said last night, the
Kasana was a smash hit.

2159
01:51:54,660 --> 01:52:05,640
church i make a money hand on my face do we know how much
money we made so last night we ended up listen last night we

2168
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:53,380

2169
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,580
Nah, he said, let me get that all.

2170
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,400
You left the all on the ground, son.

2171
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:02,890
I think we're in a car.

2172
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:05,070
I'm going to drink your milk.

2173
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:05,950
I don't know how to get out.

2174
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:07,530
I think we have to wait for the meetings now.

2175
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:09,250
I'm scared.

2176
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:11,130
I'm scared.

2177
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:15,670
He also fell asleep and that guy was taking a coin for you.

2178
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:18,150
He had a bowling alley in his house.

2179
01:53:18,610 --> 01:53:21,450
I dare you to be sad with a bowling alley in your house.

2180
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:23,350
All right, let's move on.

2181
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:24,230
We got to get the business.

2182
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:26,830
I don't want to keep y'all here too long.

2183
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,930
So I'm going to pile through this.

2184
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:33,110
We all have another party where Bobo wake up to kick off the
next day to Kassana.

2185
01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:36,950
But by the time the Kassana open, we need some new things
running.

2186
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:40,330
We got to have those concession supplies ready to go.

2187
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,310
So this church is funded by a casino.

2188
01:53:43,230 --> 01:53:45,010
And a wreck of water in case they are parked.

2189
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:46,270
What kind of religion is this?

2190
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:49,670
We are going to try and have both the Russian roulette up.

2191
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:50,910
That's you, Father Sia.

2192
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:56,090
and our racetrack fully operational so that people can bet
on the ponies.

2193
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,490
You know what I'm talking about?

2194
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:58,790
High rollers.

2195
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:03,510
Now Stonewall's also been working on Operation Kaiju.

2196
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:11,630
For those of you who don't know, Operation Kaiju is a fully
autonomous self-defense system that if anything goes wrong

2197
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:16,990
in our town, we launch up droids like it's a Pacific Rim job
in this bad boy.

2198
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:21,550
And it kill anything that's moving, anything that's not
moving, and anything in between.

2199
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:37,550
between so that's yeah from baby billy pressing matters yeah
yeah go ahead i have a question what's a pacific rim job oh

2200
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:44,650
that's the movie where they had mechanized units fighting
kaiju but i combined it with a graphic sex act called

2201
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:55,670
analangus were you looking out the outside of a i thought
that was the movie about like those mecca sharks yeah that's

2202
01:54:55,670 --> 01:55:03,770
that's the one but i just i just made it nasty so everybody
pay attention little baby oh okay okay thank you uncle baby

2203
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:16,070

watched in terms of betting yeah go ahead rake in terms of

2204
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:22,630
betting how many how many horses are we gonna get them
because they keep getting stolen we've got about four at the

2205
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:30,510
moment but they take so long to find i think i think four at
least what six i don't think no i think four is fine because

2206
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:37,650
you don't want to bet on a we don't we ain't gonna have a uh
a show place and win like normal horse racing i think you're

2207
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:44,510
just gonna bet on which horse you think you're gonna win
yeah yeah yeah there you go hey what village does this go

2208
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:50,050
meet hey our new two people you got anything you want talk
about baby and i'm just tell us a little something i'm just

2209
01:55:50,050 --> 01:56:01,170
a little i'm just a little curious here what what religion
is this religion that's a good question there are no bad

2210
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:13,670
question so we worship the blood god he is known by many
names um yog sagoth asriel the crusher of elves Anyway, he

2211
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:16,330
is an eldritch being that lives in the void of space.

2212
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:17,330
They're Satanists.

2213
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:21,130
Yeah, and this reality is his way to not him.

2214
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:26,810
And we appease him by being our most untapped degenerate
selves.

2215
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:34,930
You know, most faiths, the Buddha, on Jebus, on Muhammad,
and all the other ones, they tell you, you know, you got to

2216
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:38,310
reel it in, you got to be good, you got to listen to these
tenets.

2217
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:42,910
But over here, the Church of the Blood God, I tell you, hey,
go nuts, take your thing.

2218
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:56,150
dong out show around have an orgy steal something yeah it's
all about giving into that temptation on and saying hey i'm

2219
01:56:56,150 --> 01:57:03,170
gonna make yeah and i'm gonna have a lot of time making
these mistakes but i'm gonna learn from these mistakes yeah

2220
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:10,590
also just to more clarify from the perspective of being on
this island there are four factions on this island you'll be

2221
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:18,750
finding them in the polar And you can join one of those, but
basically the church exists as kind of like a home for

2222
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:21,510
people that don't want to align themselves with none of
them.

2223
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:29,230
They can come in here, whether you be poor, starving, or
undressed, and we will welcome you in, and we will cloth

2224
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:31,770
you, and we will try and make sure you have a good time.

2225
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:36,370
Oh, and you guys make a lot of money?

2226
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:42,310

2232

That's all.

2233
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:16,610
Make a wish, kid.

2234
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:19,090
Make a wish, kid.

2235
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:21,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2236
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:26,250
His dream is to kill me, but, uh, you know, some wishes
ain't meant to come true.

2237
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:30,050
You know, when I was young, I was stricken with a little bit
of a gout.

2238
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:31,090
I was in make a wish.

2239
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:36,290
I wanted to meet Michael Jordan and play them in one-on-one
basketball, but they couldn't make that happen out of.

2240
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,250
But you lived, though.

2241
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:42,030
Maybe we give them tickets to, like, yeah, it wasn't a bad
case of gout.

2242
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:48,010
I thought make-a-wish kids were supposed to be dying.

2243
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:53,870
It was, they didn't know what it was at first.

2244
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:55,950
My feet was all slowed up.

2245
01:58:56,130 --> 01:58:58,710
You know, eight-year-old ain't supposed to have gout that
bad.

2246
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:03,810
I see, I see, I see.

2247
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:08,910
Does anybody else have any other question?

2248
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:13,790
Anything I can help anybody with, any matters of business,
that Baby Billion should be focusing with.

2249
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:15,050
Haas, come on.

2250
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:16,550
Stonewall, see ya.

2251
01:59:16,910 --> 01:59:20,570
So for the racetrack, what else do we need other than
horses?

2252
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:24,510
Oh, I think Chrissy was working on the racetrack.

2253
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:28,290
I don't know what she's going to be working up, waking up,
but she had a plan for it.

2254
01:59:28,530 --> 01:59:34,030
I think we got a lot of resources, but if she tell you she
needs something, you know, you got to be Johnny on the spot

2255
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:34,890
and help her out.

2256
01:59:35,950 --> 01:59:40,010
Yeah, for the racehorse and stuff, for the racetrack, we
need a bit more stone.

2257

This one is already the code.

2313
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:04,440
Cults are so cool, Gumi.

2314
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:05,800
We should have joined a cult earlier.

2315
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,600
I hate it.

2316
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,180

Oh, sorry.

2319
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,740

questions yeah exactly you just devote your life to the
blood gods with hope and prayers okay of course of course of

I can't believe it.

2366
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:41,070
We actually met the blood god called.

2367
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:42,270
I thought they were rumors.

2368
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:45,750
No, they've always been here.

2369
02:08:46,490 --> 02:08:48,510
They've been here since the very beginning.

2370
02:08:49,270 --> 02:08:50,810
I thought they all died out.

2371
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:54,190
Boy, this is such a nice house.

2372
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:56,990
And we're by Uncle Baby Billy.

2373
02:08:57,190 --> 02:08:58,270
Yeah, Uncle Baby Billy.

2374
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:01,230
I want to rat that guy out to Uncle Baby Billy.

2375
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:06,570
Because he implied there were other religions.

2376
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:10,170
Yeah, do you remember his name?

2377
02:09:10,370 --> 02:09:11,930
He was like, Ray something.

2378
02:09:13,010 --> 02:09:14,030
Rainbird, Rainbird.

2379
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,530
Should we rat him out?

2380
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:17,810
He tried to tell us there were...

2381
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:17,950
What if there was a test?

2382
02:09:18,190 --> 02:09:22,330
What if there was a test and he mentioned other religions on
purpose so we could rat him out?

2383
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:25,170
But then, like, that means it shows religion.

2384
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:36,370
loyal yeah we should do it yeah we should we should be like
say what are your fathers implied there were other religions

2385
02:09:36,370 --> 02:09:41,610
i thought it was just one do we actually do let's do it

2386
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:56,970
oh my god okay i need to figure out four three four oh my
god you type the code so fast Well, it's because I pre-typed

2387
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:58,090
it while you were busy talking.

2388
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:00,570
Where's Uncle Baby?

2389
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:01,070
Where's our car?

2390
02:10:01,330 --> 02:10:03,050
Wait, did they steal your car?

2391
02:10:03,410 --> 02:10:03,890
In my car?

2392
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:05,170
No, my car has a lock on it.

2393
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:05,670
Oh, okay.

2394
02:10:05,930 --> 02:10:06,730
Let's get that straight.

2395
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:10,310
Wait, this is the sheriff's office.

2396
02:10:10,410 --> 02:10:13,210
This is the fake sheriff's office that you told me about.

2397
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:15,430
Yeah, look, it's so fake.

2398
02:10:15,490 --> 02:10:17,590
They don't even have an actual door to the cell.

2399
02:10:19,410 --> 02:10:20,250
Oh, my God.

2400
02:10:20,330 --> 02:10:21,150
This is the fake.

2401
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:21,950
Oh, my God.

2402
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:24,710
I literally rode through this fake area.

2403
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:27,150
Oh my god.

2404
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:29,510

Oh, there it is.

2411
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:42,330
Remember, your car is unlocked.

2412
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:43,650
They could steal your car whenever.

2413
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:44,150
Yeah.

2414
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:46,350

Father, be uncle, baby, baby.

2439
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:03,490
Yeah, we have a confession.

2440
02:13:04,230 --> 02:13:04,610
Are there other religions?

2441
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:05,230
Are there...

2442
02:13:05,230 --> 02:13:08,570
We were told there were other religions by the other
followers.

2443
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:13,030
I thought the blood god was the one true religion.

2444
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:19,870
Mr. Rainbird guy, he told us about other religions.

2445
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:20,890
Yeah.

2446
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:21,870
Oh.

2447
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:26,030
Now, I ain't no heard by no other religion are here on this
island.

2448
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,010
It made us confused.

2449
02:13:27,010 --> 02:13:28,410
It's kind of a mixing pot, you know.

2450
02:13:28,990 --> 02:13:33,590
I thought he was like, it made us confused and I don't trust
his faith in the blood god.

2451
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:44,770
I tell you, last night we opened the Kasana and the blood
god made himself known to everybody and dropped a thousand

2452
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:45,890
scraps from the sky.

2453
02:13:46,070 --> 02:13:46,670
It was a miracle.

2454
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:47,550
Really?

2455
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:48,330
Really?

2456
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:49,190
Yeah.

2457
02:13:49,190 --> 02:13:53,570
I'll just say that he done miracles on me.

2458
02:13:53,810 --> 02:13:54,930
You know what I mean?

2459
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:57,990
So my fate is rock solid right now.

2460
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:59,590
Also, exactly.

2461
02:13:59,830 --> 02:14:04,810
And also, I think it's important to understand this about
blood gall.

2462
02:14:05,470 --> 02:14:10,930
You know, everyone's on their own journey and path to
discovering and believing in themselves.

2463
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:12,130
You can't force it.

2464
02:14:12,130 --> 02:14:17,970
It's like forcing a baby chicken out of the egg or a baby
fetus out of the mom's womb.

2465
02:14:18,970 --> 02:14:19,710
Disgusting thought.

2466
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:23,550
But you gotta let people naturally hatch and figure it out.

2467
02:14:23,810 --> 02:14:30,590
You just can't rip the, uh, yeah, you know, uh, you just
can't rip it out of the, don't know the door of the

2468
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:30,890
explorer.

2469
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:32,490
Hey.

2470
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:35,510
That's the, that's the thing about the blood guard too.

2471
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:39,830
We exist here to take in the lost members of this island.

2472
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:46,430
So if you feel a strong pull to one of the other kingdom, we
encourage you to go over there and join them, you know, have

2473
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:47,330
a good time.

2474
02:14:48,030 --> 02:15:02,730
We always hear if you need us and we will be unwavering in
our faith and our commitment you a good time i know yeah he

2475
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:10,550
might do that he might do that we cross that bridge when we
see that when we get that to that bridge you know and you go

2476
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:16,310
on and explore those other religions but as far as i'm
concerned you're an enemy of the state so make up your mind

2477
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:24,650
oh no no no no no no no wait wait hold on now hold on now
they just ask a question a leap of faith They're asking

2478
02:15:24,650 --> 02:15:25,210
questions.

2479
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:26,270
They just ask you questions.

2480
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:34,710
We're only asking questions because, well, your followers,
they brought up about the other religion.

2481
02:15:34,930 --> 02:15:36,070
So we got so confused.

2482
02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:38,450
We thought there was only one religion here.

2483
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:43,610
Faith is confusing.

2484
02:15:44,470 --> 02:15:46,490
I tell you what, faith is confusing.

2485
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:48,470
I used to believe in a tooth fairy.

2486
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:50,690
I had faith in that guy.

2487
02:15:51,190 --> 02:15:51,770
And you know what?

2488
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:52,910
I saw that.

2489
02:15:53,810 --> 02:16:01,150
I'd lose a tooth I'd get a nickel underneath my pillar yeah
but that was from the blood god wasn't it sneaking his hand

2490
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:15,870
underneath my head no no no that was my daddy oh yeah so I
think and it's a bit of a bitch I was just I'd wake up and

2491
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:20,310
someone was ripping out my tooth and then they run out the
window and they said I'm about to trade that in for a dollar

2492
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:24,830
I thought that was blood god oh my god yeah where'd Where
did you grow up?

2493
02:16:24,970 --> 02:16:25,630
Where were they on, bro?

2494
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:27,350
Oh, how?

2495
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:31,450
I can't.

2496
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:32,030
Who?

2497
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:33,910
Y'all don't need anything else.

2498
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:35,430
Y'all want to start setting up a business.

2499
02:16:35,630 --> 02:16:36,730
We can give you some supplies.

2500
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:37,770
We were wondering.

2501
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:40,270
They were saying that we're supposed to get baptized.

2502
02:16:42,170 --> 02:16:43,470
Stokey, why would you bring that up?

2503
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:45,430
Y'all want to.

2504
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:47,770
Y'all want to commit to the church already, huh?

2505
02:16:49,890 --> 02:16:52,430
I mean, I mean, there's only one religion.

2506
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:55,430
it would make sense we committed that one true religion.

2507
02:16:56,530 --> 02:16:57,490
Toki, what?

2508
02:16:57,850 --> 02:16:58,830
You doubling down.

Wow!

2511
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:07,390
I can't.

2512
02:17:08,670 --> 02:17:10,990
See, yeah, you want to perform a baptism?

2513
02:17:11,570 --> 02:17:12,050
Yeah.

2514
02:17:13,070 --> 02:17:15,470
Toki, what did you do?

2515
02:17:15,710 --> 02:17:16,750
Yeah, come on, Gumi.

2516
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:18,070

2517
02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:19,690
One second, let me get a bigger church.

2518
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:22,030
We are in a couple of years.

2519
02:17:22,430 --> 02:17:24,230
to be devoted to the church.

2520
02:17:25,970 --> 02:17:27,670
Okay, I think my game crashed.

2521
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:29,330

He wants to kill a lot of people from the church.

2641
02:25:00,770 --> 02:25:11,950
'all to just understand when blood god came he rained down a
bloody storm upon that soil in these lands and that that

2642
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:19,350
blood is filtered on through into the center of this planet
inside of it the plant the core of the planet is a swishy

2643
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:26,750
swashy blood and it all recycles and it runs through
everything it runs through us as well the blood god he will

2644
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:37,370
give us for our sins ever since day one the day you're born
and every sacrifice that's made is a cost to everything

2645
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:45,410
every death every life and in doing all of that There's a
cost to everything we figure out.

2646
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:46,810
You must be reborn.

2647
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:48,590
You must be sacrificed.

2648
02:25:48,710 --> 02:25:49,650
You must be a fish.

2649
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:51,950
Fish must die.

2650
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:55,810
And you see, just like that, they have a circle of life.

2651
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:58,370
Good shot, Caves.

2652
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:01,770
Sacrifices must be made.

2653
02:26:03,030 --> 02:26:04,850
And that's just how that cookie crumpled.

2654
02:26:05,570 --> 02:26:06,130
Amen.

2655
02:26:10,610 --> 02:26:13,270
Let the water wash away those sins.

2656
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:17,270
All right, let the water wash away those sins.

2657
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:19,630
Let the water wash away those sins.

2658
02:26:19,650 --> 02:26:21,510
You shall be born to that sin.

2659
02:26:22,170 --> 02:26:23,570
You shall be blessed.

2660
02:26:34,730 --> 02:26:38,510
Don't give me how to wait till I'm sleeping bag timers up.

2661
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:39,670
Why?

2662
02:26:40,690 --> 02:26:42,430
Wait, how does it sound?

2663
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:44,790
70 seconds.

2664
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:48,350
I can't wonder where we are.

2665
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:50,790
Oh my god.

2666
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:57,220
Oh my god.

2667
02:26:58,060 --> 02:27:00,040
We're in the flood god cult.

2668
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:02,500
We did it.

2669
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:10,000
We did it, Gooby.

2670
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:12,360
We're part of the one true religion.

2671
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:15,820
We're in the Family!

2672
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:18,800
I'm cute.

2673
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:19,460
Yeah?

2674
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:22,480
Yeah?

2675
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:24,940
What's wrong?

2676
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,040
Nothing.

2677
02:27:34,460 --> 02:27:34,580
Oh.

2678
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:38,520
Oh my god.

2679
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,140
I'm gonna be reborn in a hundred seconds.

2680
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:48,080
How do you feel joining a cult?

2681
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:50,320
I don't know.

2682
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:51,180
How do you feel?

2683
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:52,940
I feel safe at the same time.

2684
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:57,140
Yeah, but this will be like the only time we ever get shot.

2685
02:27:57,260 --> 02:27:58,260
They'll protect us.

2686
02:27:58,900 --> 02:28:00,040
Doki, I don't know if that's true.

2687
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:01,500
I don't know if that's true, man.

2688
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:04,240
I'm pretty sure we'll get shot and they can't protect us
everywhere.

2689
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:05,660
No, there's no way.

2690
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:09,980
We'll just say that the blood god will punish you.

2691
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:15,940
We're going to be rep- The way they punish that guy that was
running.

2692
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:21,880
Yeah, E-Rob, that was just randomly swimming in the river?

2693
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:30,780
Oh my god.

2694
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,340
I can't believe it.

2695
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,720
I have 35 seconds on mine.

2696
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:36,520
Wait, how come you...

2697
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:37,640
Oh, because you had...

2698
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:38,600
You were ahead...

2699
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:40,140
You should tell them that there's a cooldown.

2700
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:43,400
They're gonna be like, where are the girls?

2701
02:28:44,380 --> 02:28:45,740
They lied to us.

2702
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:51,000
They're just like, where did they go?

2703
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:55,660
It's okay, don't worry.

2704
02:28:56,300 --> 02:28:59,180
You tell them that we're still just waiting.

2705
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:00,960
I'm waiting for mine.

2706
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:09,460
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.

2707
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:15,360
Apparently EROP has been trying to kill the cult for like
two days, but has not been successful.

2708
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:20,800
I mean, look, I would...

2709
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:21,320
I mean, how?

2710
02:29:21,480 --> 02:29:22,780
They're like a fucking army.

2711
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:25,580
Guys, it's not a cult.

2712
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:26,500
They're a real religion.

2713
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:29,900
How dare you would say that to our one true God?

2714
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:35,080
Okay.

2715
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:37,040
It must have been busy today.

2716
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:37,700
Oh.

2717
02:29:38,480 --> 02:29:39,680
Oh, right.

2718
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:41,620
I have been reborn!

2719
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:46,120
We did!

2720
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:48,800
Collect your superficial belongings from your past selves.

2721
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:49,900
Alright.

2722
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:50,820
Oh, okay.

2723
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:54,040
How do I do this faster?

2724
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:55,800
Right play, right play, right.

2725
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:58,600
Oh my god.

2726
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:02,320
Wait, wait, wait.

2727
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:04,420
Wait, wait.

2728
02:30:07,300 --> 02:30:13,680
Wait, why are you hitting your body?

2729
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:15,280
Yep.

2730
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:17,080
That doesn't want to wash away your sounds.

2731
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:24,920
You know, some people say that being reborn is kind of like
the similar sensation you get when you get your butthole wax

2732
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:33,160
at first it hurts but then it feels good really good and
then he can't stop touching on you done that before yeah

beard fool you from the neck down baby billy is smooth like

water God he is like a porpoise

2735
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:59,540
Oh baby Billy got some of that lake water in it long

2736
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:05,500
We've been reborn goomy

2737
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:14,900
Let it be said whenever you need a drink of water we live
right next to this river you come up and gulp that river

2738
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:23,500
down a little bit Oh Oh my god The more, the more we drink,
the more we believe.

2739
02:31:25,340 --> 02:31:26,480
Yeah, gop it up.

2740
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,260
A baptism water.

2741
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:31,240
You see him floating like a buoy?

2742
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:34,500
We use him like a big old Earl Grey tea bag.

2743
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,220
Yeah, we use him to flavor our water.

2744
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:37,660
Oh, I see.

2745
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,680
Okay, you're standing right from his gun.

2746

2878
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:51,980
Oh my god!

2879
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:02,520
Okay, they're pretty horrible shots, though, not gonna lie.

2880
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:03,980
They're...

2881
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:06,120
Oh, no.

2882
02:39:07,260 --> 02:39:08,720
They're pretty bad shots.

2883
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:12,160
I wish I should have stole their fucking horse.

2884
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:18,680
Should we go back to your place?

2885
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:21,580
Wait, is this your...

2886
02:39:21,580 --> 02:39:22,200
Where are you doing?

2887
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,360
Are you fixing a car?

2888
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:24,480
Wait, get off.

2889
02:39:24,540 --> 02:39:25,200
Get off the car.

2890
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:27,800
I'm going to put a lock in it so no one can steal it.

2891
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:28,380
Oh, I see.

2892
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:29,140
Is this your house?

2893
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:31,360
No, Doki.

2894
02:39:32,060 --> 02:39:33,540
Wait, who's your- Oh, public car?

2895
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:39,500
Okay, Doki, the code is 4343.

2896
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:41,220
4343.

2897
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:43,240
4343.

2898
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:43,780
Alright.

2899
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:45,560
Run.

2900
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:47,640
We almost got murdered.

2901
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:50,340
I know.

2902
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:51,880
We need to uncle Baby Billy.

2903
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:54,120
I think they killed Yoyx.

2904
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:58,260
I think they killed the random guy that was with us.

2905
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:00,960
Yeah, they just came back.

2906
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:03,540
The bank bus is gone.

2907
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:04,180
Oh, wait.

2908
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:05,180

2909
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:05,800
Yeah, yeah.

2910
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:09,780
We're not out of gas, though, me.

2911
02:40:10,280 --> 02:40:10,880
Oh, no.

2912
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:11,760
Do we just park it here?

2913
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:12,720
This is our place.

2914
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:15,440
Yeah, right here.

2915
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:17,160
Oh, my God.

2916
02:40:17,380 --> 02:40:18,600
I can't believe we lived.

2917
02:40:19,580 --> 02:40:19,980
Yes.

2918
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:21,800
Our house!

2919
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:23,800
It comes with a little pool!

2920
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,840

Are they outside of the village or?

2941
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:35,700
At the supermarket, the abandoned supermarket.

So you see Moos talking about ice cream earlier.

religion?

Listen.

2961
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:18,780
What happened back there was a mistake.

Alright.

2963
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:20,420

2966
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,800
What are these that you gave us?

2967
02:42:24,140 --> 02:42:24,840
What are these?

2968
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:26,280
That's not mine.

2969
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:28,820
That is, that is, listen, he's the shop owner.

2970
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,580
I had no idea he was going to do that.

2971
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:32,980
Hey, I'm not going to lie.

2972
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:33,840
At least it's cooked, right?

2973
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,220
No, no, I didn't.

2974
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:39,360
That was, that was, I didn't do anything.

2975
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:42,300
Listen, I just wanted to come back and apologize.

2976
02:42:42,660 --> 02:42:45,700
I had no idea he was going to do that back there.

2977
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:49,480
And you know, I brought some extra food, you know, for the
road.

2978
02:42:50,820 --> 02:42:51,900
Oh my God.

2979
02:42:52,340 --> 02:42:52,520
What?

2980
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:53,480
No way.

2981
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:55,420
What?

2982
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:56,840
Explain yourself.

2983
02:42:57,740 --> 02:42:58,440
Explain yourself.

2984
02:43:02,420 --> 02:43:04,520
Oh my god, I can't believe we survived.

2985
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:09,920
That man isn't working alone.

2986
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:13,660
So next time you get yourself in a similar situation, it's a
different person.

2987
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:16,900
Be careful because there's a group of them going around
doing that.

2988
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:17,460
So be careful.

2989
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:19,620

So much fertilizer.

02:47:58,960 --> 02:47:59,820
You can take some poo if you like.

3055
02:48:01,060 --> 02:48:02,560
What are you doing to do with the poop?

3056
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:04,940
I don't want you to eat it or something.

3057
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:05,920
Okay, go.

3058
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:08,740
Okay.

3059
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:10,020
Wait, where's the car?

3060
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:10,560
Where's the car?

3061
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:12,140
Camus, where's the car again?

3062
02:48:12,220 --> 02:48:12,860
It's over here, right?

3063
02:48:13,060 --> 02:48:14,740
They're going to give us premium car!

3064
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:16,220
Rusty Kingdom would never!

3065
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:19,320
You're right, they would never.

3066
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:21,820
They would never give us free premium stuff.

3067
02:48:23,320 --> 02:48:24,480
Well, actually, they kind of would.

3068
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:25,620
They tried to earlier.

3069
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:26,920
No, they did.

3070
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,420
They put me in the torture chamber.

3071
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:30,840
Well, that was Grandpa.

3072
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:32,820
Oh,

3073
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:37,840
my God.

3074
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:39,920
This religion is pretty nice.

3075
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:41,160
Yeah.

3076
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:42,760
I like this religion.

3077
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:44,320
Yeah, that was myth in the balloon.

3078
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:56,560
Wait, what are you doing?

3079
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:04,060
Someone was about to land a balloon right there across the
street from the casino like 10 minutes ago.

3080
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:04,900
Oh, damn.

3081
02:49:07,500 --> 02:49:08,300
Oh my god.

3082
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:09,600
Oh, here, come here!

3083
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:10,340
Wait, what?

3084
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:12,660
You see this thing?

3085
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:14,420
What?

3086
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:18,300
because it's Mr. Bo's thing.

3087
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:19,440
Mr. Bo.

3088
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:21,040
What is this?

3089
02:49:21,340 --> 02:49:23,120
Oh, it's like a casino.

3090
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:23,680
It's a casino.

3091
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:24,280
Yeah.

3092
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:28,140
It's a spa, too.

3093
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:29,580
Wait, did it take over it?

3094
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:30,460
Oh, my God.

3095
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:31,720
Did they change the code?

3096
02:49:31,940 --> 02:49:32,320
They did.

3097
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:34,000
That's it.

3098
02:49:34,220 --> 02:49:34,820
Where's it?

3099
02:49:35,660 --> 02:49:36,780
What are you gonna do?

3100
02:49:38,140 --> 02:49:38,900
What are you gonna do?

3101
02:49:40,740 --> 02:49:41,740
Okay, I'll do that.

3102
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:46,080
You're gonna demand them to give you a code?

3103
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,580
What's the code?

3104
02:49:51,560 --> 02:49:52,900
Is he even online?

3105
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:55,720
I messaged on Discord.

3106
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:01,920
Oh my god.

3107
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:04,800
Why would he change the code?

3108
02:50:06,080 --> 02:50:08,840
I think because someone tried to run in here and steal.

3109
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:11,820
I mean, it is next to the cult.

3110
02:50:13,400 --> 02:50:14,140
That is true.

3111
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,460
It is next to the cult village, so it makes sense.

And us.

3352
03:07:12,480 --> 03:07:13,520

03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:21,300
But, like, it would be pretty funny.

3354
03:07:22,700 --> 03:07:23,140

Do you think I'll notice if I take some?

3366

Oh, okay.

3368

03:11:04,490 --> 03:11:04,830
Holy shit.

3422
03:11:04,850 --> 03:11:05,310
Shit.

3423
03:11:05,930 --> 03:11:06,170
Oh.

3424
03:11:07,010 --> 03:11:07,310
Oh.

3425
03:11:08,230 --> 03:11:09,330
Someone's shooting at us.

3426
03:11:09,430 --> 03:11:10,650
Yeah, somebody shot at us.

3427
03:11:12,110 --> 03:11:13,290
I think I know who shot at us.

3428
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:14,490
Yeah.

3429
03:11:15,090 --> 03:11:15,850
That's not nice to them.

3430
03:11:15,950 --> 03:11:16,770
I don't know why they do that.

3431
03:11:19,130 --> 03:11:19,430
Oh.

3432
03:11:19,610 --> 03:11:20,010
Oh.

3433
03:11:22,270 --> 03:11:23,430
Why are they shooting us?

3434
03:11:23,510 --> 03:11:24,310
I thought we're friendly.

3435
03:11:25,890 --> 03:11:26,530
They're mean.

3436
03:11:27,330 --> 03:11:28,490
Wait, who are they down there?

3437
03:11:28,570 --> 03:11:29,990
Who is the people shooting at us?

3438
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:30,890
Dude, that's Ryan.

3439
03:11:31,050 --> 03:11:31,890
Ryan was shooting.

3440
03:11:31,970 --> 03:11:32,850
I have no clue.

3441
03:11:33,010 --> 03:11:34,410
They might be trying to get something.

3442
03:11:34,850 --> 03:11:35,350
Ryan?

3443
03:11:35,770 --> 03:11:36,570
Ryan Higa?

3444
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:37,510
We're going to steal it, but we're not.

3445
03:11:37,670 --> 03:11:38,870
Yeah, that was Mr. Pickles.

3446
03:11:39,030 --> 03:11:39,510
Ryan Higa.

3447
03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:42,510
Why the fuck is Ryan Higa shooting at us?

3448
03:11:42,950 --> 03:11:46,430
Well, it's common to shoot at any air balloon because they
could be enemies.

3449
03:11:46,970 --> 03:11:48,790
Oh, I see.

3450
03:11:50,370 --> 03:11:51,130
Yeah, guys.

3451
03:11:51,230 --> 03:11:52,170
It's the Ryan Higa.

3452
03:11:53,510 --> 03:11:54,550
Yeah, he's my teammate.

3453
03:11:54,990 --> 03:11:55,330
Yeah.

3454
03:11:55,930 --> 03:11:57,510
Is he a nice...

3455
03:11:57,510 --> 03:11:58,670
Is he a nice person?

3456
03:11:58,930 --> 03:12:00,730
He's the one that showed up when you were in front of our
house.

3457
03:12:01,050 --> 03:12:02,150
That was him?

3458
03:12:02,570 --> 03:12:04,710
Oh, he was a... Wait, that was...

3459
03:12:04,710 --> 03:12:06,490
He was the one that saw me almost breaking in.

3460
03:12:06,630 --> 03:12:07,210
And then he gave me...

3461
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:08,550
He gave me money!

3462
03:12:10,370 --> 03:12:14,030
Oh my god, I got scratched from the Ryan Higa.

3463
03:12:15,110 --> 03:12:15,650
Okay.

3464
03:12:22,190 --> 03:12:23,770
I didn't even realize that was him.

3465
03:12:25,070 --> 03:12:25,130
Yeah.

3466
03:12:32,230 --> 03:12:34,190
Thank you for the ride.

3467
03:12:35,050 --> 03:12:36,170
Thank you.

3468
03:12:38,650 --> 03:12:40,190
Great stuff, everybody.

3469
03:12:40,310 --> 03:12:40,770
Good work.

3470
03:12:42,250 --> 03:12:42,690
Yep.

3471
03:12:45,750 --> 03:12:46,750
Wait, where are we going?

3472
03:12:47,070 --> 03:12:47,970
Let's go back to your house.

3473
03:12:51,150 --> 03:12:52,430
Okay, I have to go...

3474
03:12:52,430 --> 03:12:53,810
You have to go pick up my car.

3475
03:12:54,470 --> 03:12:55,290
Where was your car?

3476
03:12:56,010 --> 03:12:57,530
We left it back at the church.

3477
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:00,770
We need to find a horse.

3478
03:13:01,370 --> 03:13:01,950
Oh, yeah.

3479
03:13:01,950 --> 03:13:03,910
When you see a horse, we fucking steal that shit.

3480
03:13:08,110 --> 03:13:09,510
Hey, who's that over there?

3481
03:13:12,290 --> 03:13:12,630

3520
03:14:35,870 --> 03:14:36,310
Perfect.

3521
03:14:37,050 --> 03:14:37,910
You fit perfectly in.

3522
03:14:39,610 --> 03:14:40,590
I love fitting in.

3523
03:14:41,030 --> 03:14:41,550
I'm trying to.

3524
03:14:43,010 --> 03:14:44,970
Okay, I feel like we're entering another cult.

3525
03:14:47,570 --> 03:14:51,670
Are these the other religions that they talked about?

3526
03:14:52,270 --> 03:14:54,290
Okay, I think I'm gonna start running.

3527
03:14:54,870 --> 03:14:56,770
Wait, but it could be a cool call.

3528
03:14:57,390 --> 03:14:58,770
We can get more free stuff.

3529
03:14:59,650 --> 03:15:00,610
I'm leaving you.

3530
03:15:01,050 --> 03:15:02,390
Oh my god, what?

3531
03:15:03,610 --> 03:15:04,730
Look into the distance.

3532
03:15:05,350 --> 03:15:06,630
Is this a Pepe call?

3533
03:15:06,850 --> 03:15:07,570
That's amazing.

3534
03:15:07,890 --> 03:15:08,690
Why is he a booze?

3535
03:15:08,990 --> 03:15:10,550
Is this a call a Pepe?

3536
03:15:10,810 --> 03:15:11,270
Wait, don't worry about it.

3537
03:15:11,290 --> 03:15:12,130
I see my sign, how?

3538
03:15:12,630 --> 03:15:14,730

3539
03:15:15,430 --> 03:15:16,630
Oh no, we...

3540
03:15:16,630 --> 03:15:18,930
I'm not...

3541
03:15:18,930 --> 03:15:20,910
Wait, where are you, Gumi?

3542
03:15:21,250 --> 03:15:22,590
I'm going home.

3543
03:15:22,910 --> 03:15:23,010
Wait!

3544
03:15:23,010 --> 03:15:23,950
Wait, wait for me!

3545
03:15:27,310 --> 03:15:29,050
Where did you go?

3546
03:15:29,750 --> 03:15:32,010
I'm literally running home right now.

3547
03:15:32,190 --> 03:15:33,050
Where's home?

3548
03:15:33,370 --> 03:15:34,270
Where's home?

3549
03:15:36,390 --> 03:15:37,070
Which way?

3550
03:15:38,410 --> 03:15:41,070
I'm going south to I-20.

3551
03:15:41,410 --> 03:15:42,210
I-20.

3552
03:15:43,330 --> 03:15:44,450
Where's I-20?

3553
03:15:45,650 --> 03:15:46,750
Where's I-20?

3554
03:15:47,090 --> 03:15:48,090
Goomy, wait for me.

3555
03:15:48,690 --> 03:15:49,150
Kill myself.

3556
03:15:49,390 --> 03:15:50,790
And then I'm going to spawn in my car.

3557
03:15:51,230 --> 03:15:52,190
And then drive it home.

3558
03:15:52,750 --> 03:15:54,810
Wait, but like...

3559
03:15:54,810 --> 03:15:56,070
But like...

3560
03:15:56,070 --> 03:15:56,330
What?

3561
03:15:56,410 --> 03:15:57,410
You're going to lose your stuff.

3562
03:15:58,390 --> 03:15:59,750
No, not if I put it away.

3563
03:16:00,030 --> 03:16:01,050
Oh, wait.

3564
03:16:01,150 --> 03:16:03,190
Can you wait for me so I can live in your...

3565
03:16:03,190 --> 03:16:05,090
So I can squat in your garage?

3566
03:16:07,210 --> 03:16:07,990
Listen, fine.

3567
03:16:08,050 --> 03:16:10,470
I'll build you a little room off the side of the garage.

3568
03:16:10,730 --> 03:16:11,090
Yay!

3569
03:16:11,610 --> 03:16:12,370
Oh, I'm bleeding.

3570
03:16:12,630 --> 03:16:20,850
I ran into a cactus Because I was so busy looking at the map
Alright, I'm running to I-20 Where's I-20 again?

3573
03:16:42,610 --> 03:16:43,150
house the road.

3574
03:16:43,790 --> 03:16:44,250
There's what?

3575
03:16:45,310 --> 03:16:46,090
Find a horse.

3576
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:48,890
Well, I'm trying to find my horse, too.

3577
03:16:49,830 --> 03:16:51,110
What do you mean, my horse?

3578
03:16:51,430 --> 03:16:51,950
My horse.

3579
03:16:51,990 --> 03:16:52,810
You don't got a horse?

3580
03:16:53,050 --> 03:16:53,510
Yes, I do.

3581
03:16:53,730 --> 03:16:54,790
I always find horses.

3582
03:16:55,950 --> 03:16:57,710
I gotta put back my wolf hat.

3583
03:16:58,570 --> 03:16:59,390
I can't believe it.

3584
03:16:59,450 --> 03:17:00,970
Now we're part of two cults.

3585
03:17:01,950 --> 03:17:02,390
Yeah.

3586
03:17:02,550 --> 03:17:06,310
We should tell Baby Billy about the second cult we found.

3587
03:17:06,970 --> 03:17:07,970
You think they wiped them?

3588
03:17:08,550 --> 03:17:11,870
We should tell Baby Billy about the skimpy toilet thing that
that guy told us.

3589
03:17:13,010 --> 03:17:15,690
And he said he was giving a secret from Baby Billy.

3590
03:17:16,530 --> 03:17:18,750
Oh, he's not Baby Billy's not gonna like that.

3591
03:17:18,870 --> 03:17:20,470
Yeah, Baby Billy doesn't like secrets.

3592
03:17:20,710 --> 03:17:22,490
Yeah, Baby Billy needs you to tell everything.

3593
03:17:23,130 --> 03:17:23,650
Uh-huh.

3594
03:17:27,210 --> 03:17:28,250
I can't believe.

3595
03:17:28,290 --> 03:17:30,050
I can't believe he'll keep a secret from Baby Billy.

3596
03:17:30,050 --> 03:17:30,410
Baby Billy.

3597
03:17:30,790 --> 03:17:32,570
After everything he did for that man.

3598
03:17:33,630 --> 03:17:35,470
Yeah, like baptize him.

3599
03:17:35,890 --> 03:17:38,250
Like he like gave him a home and everything.

3600
03:17:38,790 --> 03:17:42,610
And then he's willing to like fuck over Baby Billy by
keeping a secret.

3601
03:17:43,970 --> 03:17:46,890
And he was the one that told us about the other religions.

3602
03:17:49,230 --> 03:17:52,790
We didn't know about the other religions until he told us
about it.

3603
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:54,490
Yeah.

3604
03:17:59,310 --> 03:17:59,750
Blasphemous.

3605
03:18:00,430 --> 03:18:03,010
I don't think he's a true believer of the blood god.

3606
03:18:03,150 --> 03:18:04,390
I don't think so either.

3607
03:18:05,090 --> 03:18:06,170
I think he's a liar.

3608
03:18:06,850 --> 03:18:08,130
I think he's a spy.

3609
03:18:11,430 --> 03:18:12,990
I think we should kill him.

3610
03:18:14,690 --> 03:18:17,670
Wait, we gotta strip him of his armor first and his guns.

3611
03:18:18,670 --> 03:18:21,230
No, if you kill him, you get to take the armor off their
body.

3612
03:18:21,470 --> 03:18:23,230
Yeah, but then what if he shoots us?

3613
03:18:27,350 --> 03:18:29,150
What if he shoots us, Kumi?

3614
03:18:29,590 --> 03:18:31,450
I don't know if I can survive getting shot.

3615
03:18:32,150 --> 03:18:33,490
Oh my god, I have 200 scrap.

3616
03:18:34,210 --> 03:18:35,150
Wait, I'm almost there.

3617
03:18:35,410 --> 03:18:35,890
You're at your home.

3618
03:18:36,690 --> 03:18:37,390
Are you at home now?

3619
03:18:38,170 --> 03:18:39,190
Yeah, I'm at home.

3620
03:18:39,430 --> 03:18:40,830
Have you built me a home, too?

3621
03:18:41,850 --> 03:18:42,190
No.

3622
03:18:42,910 --> 03:18:43,250

How do we...

3665
03:21:11,550 --> 03:21:12,630
Kill ourselves here?

3666
03:21:13,250 --> 03:21:15,110

03:21:32,510 --> 03:21:33,270
I'm in my car.

3674
03:21:34,010 --> 03:21:34,450
Wait, what?

3675
03:21:35,850 --> 03:21:36,950
How did you...

3676
03:21:36,950 --> 03:21:41,410
My car has bed in it, so I can respawn in my car.

3677
03:21:41,610 --> 03:21:42,170
Wait, what?

3678
03:21:42,490 --> 03:21:43,830
How are you going to pick me up?

3679
03:21:45,030 --> 03:21:45,930
With my car?

3680
03:21:46,130 --> 03:21:47,710
Where is your car?

3681
03:21:48,690 --> 03:21:49,850
At the church?

3682
03:21:50,330 --> 03:21:51,810
Oh, wait, where am I?

3683
03:21:53,790 --> 03:21:54,830

3684
03:21:56,010 --> 03:21:57,750
Where is the church?

3685
03:21:57,830 --> 03:21:58,990
Oh, the church is in front of me.

3686
03:21:59,070 --> 03:21:59,750
I'm at the church.

3687
03:22:00,510 --> 03:22:02,030
You left your car here?

3688
03:22:02,270 --> 03:22:03,410
Oh, wait, I forgot your car right now.

3689
03:22:03,530 --> 03:22:03,810
Yeah.

3690
03:22:04,350 --> 03:22:04,710
Yeah.

3691
03:22:05,150 --> 03:22:07,030
I don't remember where...

3692
03:22:07,030 --> 03:22:09,770
I actually don't remember where...

3693
03:22:09,770 --> 03:22:11,150
It said R5.

3694
03:22:11,410 --> 03:22:11,910
R5?

3695
03:22:12,990 --> 03:22:13,510
R5.

3696
03:22:14,310 --> 03:22:15,390
Oh, R5 is this way.

3697
03:22:15,570 --> 03:22:15,910
Okay.

3698
03:22:16,130 --> 03:22:17,890
I'm heading over to our five.

3699
03:22:21,610 --> 03:22:21,910
All right.

3700
03:22:22,730 --> 03:22:23,610
I'm heading over.

3701
03:22:26,210 --> 03:22:26,650
Yay.

3702
03:22:30,270 --> 03:22:33,250
I had to believe we did so much in just...

3703
03:22:33,250 --> 03:22:34,710
No, I managed to take a nap.

3704
03:22:34,910 --> 03:22:37,390
Yeah, in just like three hours.

3705
03:22:37,610 --> 03:22:38,790
We did so much today.

3706
03:22:39,330 --> 03:22:40,710
Yeah, we got indoctrinated.

3707
03:22:41,210 --> 03:22:42,950
We made so many new friends.

3708
03:22:43,930 --> 03:22:44,390
We met Uncle Billy.

3709
03:22:44,390 --> 03:22:45,230
Yeah, I named them all.

3710
03:22:45,430 --> 03:22:47,390
We met Uncle Baby Billy.

3711
03:22:49,710 --> 03:22:50,710
Rebrands, uh...

3712
03:22:50,710 --> 03:22:51,670

3715
03:23:01,190 --> 03:23:01,790
Uh...

03:23:01,790 --> 03:23:02,610
Alright, I'm there.

3717
03:23:03,190 --> 03:23:03,990
I'm here now.

3718
03:23:05,850 --> 03:23:07,510
Blood God, are you there?

3719
03:23:10,490 --> 03:23:11,990
Okay, where are you?

3720
03:23:12,270 --> 03:23:12,710
Oh, is that you?

3721
03:23:13,830 --> 03:23:14,970
Oh, that's stonewall.

3722
03:23:15,790 --> 03:23:16,310
Oh, there you are.

3723
03:23:16,650 --> 03:23:18,030
Wait, how do you have clothes?

3724
03:23:19,310 --> 03:23:20,970

3725
03:23:21,250 --> 03:23:23,290
Oh, wait, wait, yeah, did you get everything?

3726
03:23:23,470 --> 03:23:24,150

03:23:25,770 --> 03:23:26,990
Wait, where's our stuff?

3729
03:23:27,710 --> 03:23:29,190

Back home we go!

3754
03:24:43,910 --> 03:24:44,790
Our second home!

3755
03:24:45,210 --> 03:24:45,750
Yep.

3756
03:24:46,670 --> 03:24:47,210
Yay!

3757
03:24:48,370 --> 03:24:50,710
What an adventure we had.

3758
03:24:51,310 --> 03:24:51,850
I know.

3759
03:24:54,430 --> 03:24:56,050
Thanks for giving me the tour, Agumi.

3760
03:24:57,910 --> 03:24:59,610
I think I would have definitely died.

3761
03:25:01,070 --> 03:25:05,030
There's a maybe that the server might close in two days.

3762
03:25:05,250 --> 03:25:05,990
Oh yeah, no, I heard.

3763
03:25:06,130 --> 03:25:08,130
The server's supposed to be up for like seven days or
something.

3764
03:25:09,210 --> 03:25:12,990
But it might last for longer depending on how people feel
about it.

3765
03:25:13,590 --> 03:25:15,870
It depends on what people want to keep playing type deal,
right?

3766
03:25:16,750 --> 03:25:17,670
Yeah, so.

3767
03:25:18,270 --> 03:25:21,090
You better be back on before the server closes.

3768
03:25:21,230 --> 03:25:24,610
I mean, I feel like I learned a lot from the first day.

3769
03:25:26,010 --> 03:25:27,070
What an adventure.

3770
03:25:29,130 --> 03:25:29,750
What about casino?

3771
03:25:30,130 --> 03:25:30,490
Jesus!

3772
03:25:31,110 --> 03:25:33,030
Oh my god, you almost killed me.

3773
03:25:34,450 --> 03:25:35,290
Hey, it's Donkey Kong.

3774
03:25:35,730 --> 03:25:36,330
It's me.

3775
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:37,350
What are you guys up to?

3776
03:25:38,190 --> 03:25:39,190
Yeah, we joined a cult.

3777
03:25:40,030 --> 03:25:40,330
Oh.

3778
03:25:40,730 --> 03:25:41,190
Yeah.

3779
03:25:41,790 --> 03:25:44,010
The one and only cult, right?

3780
03:25:46,370 --> 03:25:46,930
Googly.

3781
03:25:46,970 --> 03:25:48,250
Like a miskish?

3782
03:25:48,270 --> 03:25:48,510
team.

3783
03:25:48,830 --> 03:25:49,690
It's called the church, man.

3784
03:25:49,930 --> 03:25:50,290
Oh, sorry.

3785
03:25:50,490 --> 03:25:51,390
We joined the religion.

3786
03:25:51,590 --> 03:25:52,390
We joined the church.

3787
03:25:52,550 --> 03:25:53,150
I'm the blood god.

3788
03:25:53,470 --> 03:25:54,510
Oh, you want to get baptized?

3789
03:25:54,930 --> 03:25:56,850
Wait, have you got baptized yet?

3790
03:25:59,170 --> 03:26:01,090
No, I'm part of Rusty Bones.

3791
03:26:01,630 --> 03:26:02,010
You know, Rusty Bones?

3792
03:26:02,010 --> 03:26:03,350
Yeah, you can be part of both.

3793
03:26:03,710 --> 03:26:05,650
It's a Rusty Bones is not a religion.

3794
03:26:06,150 --> 03:26:08,550
There's only one religion in this server anyway.

3795
03:26:09,610 --> 03:26:11,070
Just taking a Rusty Bones.

3796
03:26:11,910 --> 03:26:12,890
Oh, Uncle Bobby.

3797
03:26:13,150 --> 03:26:13,170
Yeah.

3798
03:26:15,030 --> 03:26:16,410
Uncle Bobby, Billy.

3799
03:26:16,410 --> 03:26:17,130
Maybe Billy.

3800
03:26:17,370 --> 03:26:22,230
We found another person who wants to get baptized.

That was fine.

Guns aren't allowed in the Colosseum.

3831
03:29:27,780 --> 03:29:29,460
Guns aren't allowed in the Colosseum anyway.

3832
03:29:29,620 --> 03:29:30,600
So he has to wait anyway.

3833
03:29:30,720 --> 03:29:31,020
Don't worry.

3834
03:29:31,160 --> 03:29:31,800
Yeah, yeah.

3835
03:29:32,400 --> 03:29:34,960
They aren't allowed to wait anyway.

3836
03:29:35,560 --> 03:29:37,640
Have you heard good things about this religion?

3837
03:29:38,080 --> 03:29:38,500
Tsar Kuno?

3838
03:29:43,150 --> 03:29:43,530
Have you?

3839
03:29:43,770 --> 03:29:44,990
No, I haven't heard anything.

3840
03:29:45,210 --> 03:29:46,210
Wait, you've never heard...

3841
03:29:46,210 --> 03:29:48,370
Kumi, tell him about all the great things.

3842
03:29:49,410 --> 03:29:51,550
Tell him about all the great things they did for us.

3843
03:29:51,730 --> 03:29:53,470
They gave us a free home.

3844
03:29:54,550 --> 03:29:55,830
Two, three, water.

3845
03:29:58,070 --> 03:29:58,990
It gave us a car.

3846
03:29:59,410 --> 03:30:00,410
I have 12 seconds.

3847
03:30:02,550 --> 03:30:03,790
They gave you this car?

3848
03:30:04,050 --> 03:30:05,310
Yeah, they gave us this car.

3849
03:30:05,570 --> 03:30:05,930
John, wife.

3850
03:30:07,790 --> 03:30:08,810
Okay, back to the river.

3851
03:30:08,890 --> 03:30:09,670
I'm gonna go to the river.

3852
03:30:10,530 --> 03:30:12,530
We're gonna take you to the river to get baptized.

3853
03:30:13,430 --> 03:30:15,370
I think there's actually an extra seat in here.

3854
03:30:15,530 --> 03:30:15,930
I'm gonna be honest.

3855
03:30:16,150 --> 03:30:17,410
I think there's just an extra seat.

3856
03:30:17,670 --> 03:30:21,290
Oh, I need to take this car there, as well as bring.

3857
03:30:21,630 --> 03:30:24,210
Oh, you're gonna love it, and you're gonna love this place.

3858
03:30:24,750 --> 03:30:27,870
Like, we were reborn, and we believed so hard.

3859
03:30:31,250 --> 03:30:32,530
I've never been happier.

3860
03:30:32,850 --> 03:30:33,250
I know!

3861
03:30:33,550 --> 03:30:35,910
I've been so happy ever since I got baptized.

3862
03:30:36,590 --> 03:30:37,730
Like, I saw the truth.

3863
03:30:38,910 --> 03:30:42,950
I just joined today, and now I realize this is the one true
religion.

3864
03:30:45,590 --> 03:30:46,070
Wow.

3865
03:30:47,410 --> 03:30:49,110
So you guys, like, PvPers?

3866
03:30:49,190 --> 03:30:50,950
Do you kill other players, or?

3867
03:30:51,930 --> 03:30:54,530
No, we just hear this spread peace and love.

3868
03:30:54,550 --> 03:30:55,470
Yeah.

3869
03:30:56,430 --> 03:30:57,570
And money too.

3870
03:30:58,590 --> 03:30:59,570
You know they own a casino?

3871
03:31:00,570 --> 03:31:03,790
Apparently they made it rain a thousand scraps like you
know.

3872
03:31:05,650 --> 03:31:06,110
No, no.

3873
03:31:06,170 --> 03:31:07,590
They have like your own casinos.

3874
03:31:08,090 --> 03:31:11,670
Is this somebody's house here?

3875
03:31:12,650 --> 03:31:14,030
It's completely undefended.

3876
03:31:14,290 --> 03:31:15,750
This can be your house.

3877
03:31:15,910 --> 03:31:16,190
Yeah.

3878
03:31:16,570 --> 03:31:19,350
After you get baptized you can own this house after.

3879
03:31:21,650 --> 03:31:23,410
I mean I don't think I want this house.

3880
03:31:23,410 --> 03:31:23,610
I don't think I want this house.

3881
03:31:24,550 --> 03:31:26,310
But you get to own why?

3882
03:31:26,770 --> 03:31:27,790
Property is expensive.

3883
03:31:31,070 --> 03:31:33,390
I feel like I got a better house already.

3884
03:31:33,550 --> 03:31:35,310
Real estate is hard, man.

3885
03:31:38,930 --> 03:31:39,810
I mean...

3886
03:31:39,810 --> 03:31:41,370
Like, look at that free water?

3887
03:31:43,590 --> 03:31:45,390
I do like the free water.

3888
03:31:45,590 --> 03:31:46,110
That is nice.

3889
03:31:46,310 --> 03:31:47,590
Is there any food around here, too?

3890
03:31:47,690 --> 03:31:48,910
Like, maybe some pumpkins or something?

3891
03:31:49,090 --> 03:31:49,370

There's a bunch of nothing.

4016
03:39:47,800 --> 03:39:48,500
Their conviction.

4017
03:39:49,400 --> 03:39:50,200
It's wavering.

4018
03:39:51,700 --> 03:39:53,060
They're losing faith.

4019
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:54,320
They're losing faith.

4020
03:39:54,920 --> 03:39:56,400
How could they lose faith?

4021
03:39:58,040 --> 03:39:58,380

Oh, my God.

4044
03:42:21,460 --> 03:42:21,940
Someone stole that bear.

4045
03:42:22,180 --> 03:42:22,940
Wait, is that him?

4046
03:42:22,980 --> 03:42:24,180
That could be him, actually.

4047
03:42:24,720 --> 03:42:25,780
That could be him.

4048
03:42:28,060 --> 03:42:29,500
I think that's someone else.

4049
03:42:29,760 --> 03:42:30,740
Who is that?

4050
03:42:31,300 --> 03:42:31,680

Look at that bear, though.

4054
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:39,780
Yeah, that's a 10-yard trade.

4055
03:42:39,920 --> 03:42:40,380
Am I right?

4056
03:42:41,620 --> 03:42:42,220
Oh, wait, no.

4057
03:42:42,360 --> 03:42:44,080
Goobie's actually picking somebody up.

4058
03:42:45,900 --> 03:42:46,100
Wait.

4059
03:42:50,770 --> 03:42:52,330
I'll be honest.

4060
03:42:52,410 --> 03:42:53,450
That was a death trap.

4061
03:42:53,830 --> 03:42:55,130
Like, a million percent.

4062
03:42:55,450 --> 03:42:56,390
Oh, yeah.

4063
03:42:59,330 --> 03:43:00,330
They're right.

4064
03:43:01,250 --> 03:43:03,270
They left.

4065
03:43:04,670 --> 03:43:06,410
Goobie, they fucking left.

4066
03:43:07,370 --> 03:43:09,950
They're like, that was a death trap.

4067

03:43:26,370 --> 03:43:28,650
They literally ran away that way!

4073
03:43:28,850 --> 03:43:29,510
Oh, no!

03:43:30,130 --> 03:43:31,730
You just missed them!

4075
03:43:31,750 --> 03:43:33,850
Should we chase after them and give them some faith?

4076
03:43:34,530 --> 03:43:37,110
They just didn't believe enough, uncle!

4077
03:43:37,650 --> 03:43:47,390
They were their faith wavered They saw you shot the bear
They saw you shot the bear and left because they got scared

4080
03:44:11,990 --> 03:44:14,030
Gumi, they ran that way across the river.

4081
03:44:14,450 --> 03:44:15,570
They went to the rusty bones, they said.

4082
03:44:15,850 --> 03:44:16,850
We gotta go.

4083
03:44:18,750 --> 03:44:20,590
They went that way, Gumi.

4084
03:44:21,150 --> 03:44:21,830
To the right.

4085
03:44:23,190 --> 03:44:24,210
Step on it.

4086
03:44:24,810 --> 03:44:25,450

Oh.

4088
03:44:29,690 --> 03:44:34,370
We can catch up to them.

4089
03:44:35,570 --> 03:44:46,670
How dare they leave the baptism yeah they were so ready and
they took our food too yeah we we sheltered them we

4090
03:44:46,670 --> 03:44:56,050
sheltered them and gave them food and everything yeah and
then they left oh now now if you take the sacrament you got

4091
03:44:56,050 --> 03:45:04,850
to get baptized them's the rules of course we fed them and
everything I felt like they were using us that's gonna help

4092
03:45:04,850 --> 03:45:06,610

Uncle Baby Billy, I see them.

4098
03:45:46,370 --> 03:45:48,510
There's a water port thing you gotta remember.

4099
03:45:49,570 --> 03:45:55,930
Right before you drop the baptism device, you gotta say it's
baptism time.

4100
03:45:57,130 --> 03:45:58,210
Oh, look, they're here!

4101
03:45:58,270 --> 03:45:59,170
Oh, there they are!

4102
03:45:59,570 --> 03:46:01,190
Are you ready to get baptized?

4103
03:46:01,750 --> 03:46:04,250
Jesus, it's the blood god, it's the blood god.

4104
03:46:04,990 --> 03:46:06,650
Hey, now, I'm ready, Billy.

4105
03:46:06,870 --> 03:46:11,170
Yeah, and you said after you baptize us you probably must

03:46:11,610 --> 03:46:12,630
Oh shit!

4107
03:46:13,490 --> 03:46:14,270

03:46:15,210 --> 03:46:16,370
Is that an explosive?

4109
03:46:16,910 --> 03:46:17,610
Holy Jesus!

4110
03:46:19,130 --> 03:46:20,010
Who did that?

4111
03:46:21,290 --> 03:46:23,110
He's gonna do things for me!

4112
03:46:23,590 --> 03:46:26,050
Oh my god, I don't think he cheated him enough!

4113
03:46:26,490 --> 03:46:27,650
Where did you get those from?

4114
03:46:28,170 --> 03:46:29,690
Where did you get those from then?

4115
03:46:29,810 --> 03:46:32,510
It was the blood god, it was the blood god, oh hell!

4116
03:46:33,470 --> 03:46:34,250
Oh my god.

4117
03:46:34,810 --> 03:46:35,650
Right, the blood god.

4118
03:46:36,070 --> 03:46:36,630
Oh my god.

4119
03:46:37,530 --> 03:46:40,670
Uncle, I don't think you trained her in the house.

4120
03:46:40,670 --> 03:46:42,710
I knew that well, uh, Baby Billy Uncle.

4121
03:46:43,010 --> 03:46:43,850
Who's this?

4122
03:46:44,790 --> 03:46:46,910
You're telling me, Uncle Baby Billy.

4123
03:46:47,290 --> 03:46:48,570

Uncle Baby Billy.

My name is Uncle Baby Billy.

4128
03:46:58,510 --> 03:46:59,450
Here we go, we can hear you a lot better.

4129
03:46:59,830 --> 03:47:00,290
No relation.

4130
03:47:01,890 --> 03:47:04,110
And I'm here to baptize you.

4131
03:47:05,190 --> 03:47:06,850
Now I have a baptizer to baptize you.

4132
03:47:06,870 --> 03:47:14,310
I got baptizes at about all 30 shells per second.

4133
03:47:14,310 --> 03:47:15,290
Praise me.

4134
03:47:19,730 --> 03:47:22,430
I got baptized as a child, it's okay.

4135
03:47:22,610 --> 03:47:23,150

4136
03:47:23,650 --> 03:47:24,730
Where you going?

4137
03:47:25,930 --> 03:47:28,170
Warful and triumphant.

4138
03:47:28,790 --> 03:47:29,770
I don't think you can get it there.

4139
03:47:32,950 --> 03:47:34,770
You're right down there, Uncle.

4140
03:47:35,170 --> 03:47:35,310

4143
03:47:37,030 --> 03:47:40,750
I want to say that was a good effort with that baptism
device.

4144
03:47:41,810 --> 03:47:43,630
You had a lot of enthusiasm.

4145
03:47:44,090 --> 03:47:45,250
I appreciate that.

4146
03:47:46,590 --> 03:47:48,050

4185
03:50:21,610 --> 03:50:23,150
He's getting a sign from the blood god.

03:50:25,230 --> 03:50:27,390
Oh my god, he's- Hallelujah.

4187

4190
03:50:38,070 --> 03:50:39,090
Wait, who are you gonna kill?

4191
03:50:39,110 --> 03:50:39,450

I think.

4291
03:56:07,450 --> 03:56:09,290
Gumi, I think they're going to kill us.

4292
03:56:09,770 --> 03:56:11,230
I don't think they're going to kill us and Uncle.

4293
03:56:11,990 --> 03:56:13,330
I'm going to...

4294
03:56:13,330 --> 03:56:13,910
All right, Gumi.

4295
03:56:14,470 --> 03:56:15,590

I earned my place.

4364
04:01:54,370 --> 04:01:55,050
Well...

4365
04:01:55,050 --> 04:01:57,350
We got baptized together, Gumi.

4366
04:01:58,750 --> 04:01:59,210
Yeah.

4367
04:01:59,750 --> 04:02:02,450
I guess we also E-Rob got baptized too.

4368
04:02:02,690 --> 04:02:05,010
Yeah, we got baptized with an E-Rob.

4369
04:02:08,330 --> 04:02:12,530
I think my favorite part is your baptism grenade.

4370
04:02:14,090 --> 04:02:14,770
Oh,

4371
04:02:17,790 --> 04:02:18,130
shit!

4372
04:02:20,030 --> 04:02:23,050
But that one, you know, it was good effort.

4373
04:02:23,490 --> 04:02:27,570
The baptism grenade was good effort there.

4374
04:02:27,950 --> 04:02:30,370
Dude, I didn't expect it to go flying like that.

4375
04:02:30,590 --> 04:02:31,590
There was so much momentum.

4376
04:02:34,050 --> 04:02:36,670
I can't believe it rolled down the hill.

4377
04:02:37,170 --> 04:02:38,010
That was crazy.

4378
04:02:38,770 --> 04:02:44,990
And then, I think he was trying to tell me that I had to
pull the trigger, but I was like, why isn't this shit

4379
04:02:44,990 --> 04:02:45,690
blowing up?

4380
04:02:45,690 --> 04:03:02,950
Oh my god Alright We're almost there We're almost there Yay

today Yeah I'm one Moist starving though

4382
04:03:18,890 --> 04:03:19,290
Yay!

4383
04:03:19,590 --> 04:03:24,070
Well, you're only starving because we died multiple times
and each time you eat food, it gets cancelled out.

4384
04:03:24,670 --> 04:03:26,730
No, we died like one time.

4385
04:03:27,090 --> 04:03:28,070
Oh, two times.

4386
04:03:28,250 --> 04:03:32,950
The baptism and the and the other one where we have to get
your car.

4387
04:03:34,190 --> 04:03:34,530
