00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,600
Music

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,040
Here in the garden, let's play a game I'll show you how it's
done

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,300
And very still, this will be so much fun.

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,280
And then she smiled, that's what I'm after.

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,880
A smile in her eyes, a sound of her laughter.

6
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:56,400
Happy to listen, happy to play, happily watching her drift
away.

7
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,180
Happily waiting, all on my own, under the endless sky.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,740
Counting the seconds, standing alone, as thousands of years
go by.

9
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,080
Happily wondering at night after night, is this how it
works?

10
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,320
Am I doing it right?

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,980
to stay happily watching her drift away.

12
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:52,460
You keep on turning pages for people who don't care, people
who don't care about you.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,340
And still it takes you ages to see that no one's there.

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:18,140
See that no one's there See that no one's there Everyone's
gone on without you Finally something, finally news about

15
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:34,940
the story ends She doesn't exist now, survived by her son
And all of her brand new friends lovely isn't that cool and

16
00:02:34,940 --> 00:03:03,680
isn't that cool and aren't I a pool to have happily listened
happy this day happily watching her drink drink drink away
