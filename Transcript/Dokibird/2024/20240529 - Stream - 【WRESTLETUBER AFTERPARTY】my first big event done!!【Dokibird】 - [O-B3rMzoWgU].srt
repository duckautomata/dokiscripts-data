00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,730
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,850
Oh my- I am tired.

3
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,390
Oh my gosh.

4
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,430
Hello.

5
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:10,730
I just want you guys to know, um, when I, uh, for when this was all over, um, yesterday, I think I slept like 18 hours.

6
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,450
I

7
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,490
was like awake and then I like fell back asleep.

8
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,170
Okay.

9
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,330
Alright.

10
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,390
Okay, guys.

11
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,170
Okay, this is so embarrassing.

12
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,670
Okay.

13
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,050
Today I was still really tired.

14
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,510
I think it's because like everything just came crashing down on me.

15
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,690
Like, I was just like, you know, I was like using reserve energy to do everything until Restituber was over.

16
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,670
And then I actually started acting.

17
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,210
I started hibernating.

18
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,090
Okay, I'm gonna tell you guys a very embarrassing story.

19
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,190
It's not even a story.

20
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,330
It's not even a story, but it's so embarrassing.

21
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,490
It's a little TMI.

22
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,950
I'll just- But we're homies.

23
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,330
But like, guys, I just need you guys to know, this is a very embarrassing thing I'm gonna tell you guys.

24
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,990
But like, I have to let you guys know how tired I was.

25
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,430
So I'm just gonna give you guys a word.

26
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,450
Just so- Please do not laugh at me.

27
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,550
You guys are- No, reg- Nevermind.

28
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,850
You guys will laugh at me regardless.

29
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,630
You know, it's okay.

30
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,850
If you guys are gonna laugh at me, it's fine.

31
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,950
I understand why.

32
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,770
Anyway, this is how tired I was.

33
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,710
I woke up today.

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,010
I woke up.

35
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,470
I was like, alright.

36
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,590
Like, I- Yesterday I didn't even eat dinner.

37
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,230
That's how- Yesterday I- That's not the embarrassing part yet.

38
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,030
I was so tired from everything that I didn't even eat dinner yesterday.

39
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,790
I just like went to sleep.

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,670
I just- I- I just went to sleep before dinner yesterday.

41
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,510
And then I woke up.

42
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,550
And then I was like, okay, oh, I should get something to eat.

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,730
Like, oh my gosh.

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,650
It's- I don't remember what time I woke up.

45
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,230
I just know like, it's morning.

46
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,310
It's the day after.

47
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:55,790
It's today.

48
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,510
It's morning.

49
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,570
And then I was like, oh man.

50
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,610
I'm so- I should get some- I wasn't really hungry at that time.

51
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,810
But I was like, I should get something to eat.

52
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,530
Cause I didn't have dinner.

53
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,370
I might as well eat like brunch or something.

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,690
And so, I went to the bathroom.

55
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,270
And I went back to bed.

56
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,670
Because I used up all my energy.

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,440
And I- and I fell asleep.

58
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,740
I was like, okay, but first I really need to use the bathroom.

59
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,480
And after I finished using the bathroom, I went back to bed.

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,220
I was like, oh my gosh.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,280
I'm so tired from all that energy.

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,740
I used up all my energy.

63
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,600
I was so- I was so- I felt fucking so tired.

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,940
I was like, I'm gonna go to sleep.

65
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,480
And then I woke up at like- I think I woke up at like 2pm.

66
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,420
I-

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,780
That's - that's how tired- that's how tired I was.

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh yeah, I really wore myself there.

69
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,700
Mmm.

70
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,300
Um.

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,380
Um, but I just- that's how- that's when you know I was- I was very tired.

72
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
I still am.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,780
I still am.

74
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,700
I'm pretty sure after this stream I'm gonna go take a nap again just to like recharge my battery.

75
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,200
Thank you for the super chat.

76
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,100
Thank you, thank you.

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,420
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

78
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,340
Thank you, thank you.

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,860
Oh, I'm not gonna read that message Cosmic.

80
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,520
But thank you.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,180
Um.

82
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,120
I think it was a success.

83
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,840
I think WrestleTuber was- was a huge success.

84
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,680
Well, I don't know if I should say huge success.

85
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,760
But I think WrestleTuber did do- did like- do a good job.

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,040
Oh my gosh, sorry, my brain is like processing words.

87
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,260
I can't words right now.

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,840
But I think like WrestleTuber did go as how I wanted and beyond that because it feels like I think you guys all enjoyed it.

89
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,820
I think you guys, every single one of you guys enjoyed WrestleTuber and like all the nice surprises and everything.

90
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,960
And it just felt like and then having like so many different storylines.

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,260
So many different storylines being played out and all the...

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,620
You do know all of it was like AI, right?

93
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,220
Like everything was controlled by AI like the the wrestlers, but holy shit.

94
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,500
I don't know how but like...

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,320
I don't know how we were so lucky with the AI like where it went.

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,740
Because some of you guys were like, oh Joki, you purposely made Yuuzhan's wrestler overpowered as hell.

97
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,420
So like Beto was gonna lose no matter what.

98
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,740
No, actually, I wasn't... I... I...

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,820
It was the same.

100
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,360
I told them to make it the same stat.

101
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,100
I was like it has to be the same as everybody else.

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,740
So I have no idea how the fuck Beto got smacked so hard that he died outside.

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,960
of the ring like It's so fucking fast.

104
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:28,100
Like that surprised me as so much because I was definitely not expecting that.

105
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,200
To the point where he literally...

106
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,680
Like I think his AI actually died.

107
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,680
Like he just stopped moving.

108
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,600
And then I was like there's no way.

109
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,660
There's no way.

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,620
Get up!

111
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,720
Beto, get the fuck up!

112
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,610
That was...

113
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,850
That was fucking crazy.

114
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,310
I couldn't believe that happened.

115
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,650
It was like...

116
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,470
It was so perfect.

117
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,950
Beto was tired.

118
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,670
It was...

119
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,890
It was Beto's turn to be EP.

120
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,210
But yeah, both Yuuzhan and Beto are getting better.

121
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,470
They're getting belts sent over.

122
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,630
It was originally planned because people were like...

123
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:22,790
No!

124
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,830
Beto lost his belt!

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,970
It's not fair!

126
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,210
It's not fair baby.

127
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,910
Welcome to WWE.

128
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,520
It was never fair.

129
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,100
It was never fair.

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,740
Well, listen.

131
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
People were saying like...

132
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Oh my god.

133
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,000
It gave like John Cena versus...

134
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,080
What's his name?

135
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,140
The guy that plays Drax.

136
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,140
Guardians of the Galaxy.

137
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,140
Oh my god.

138
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,260
I'm gonna fucking butcher his name.

139
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,120
Guardians and...

140
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,520
Guardians of the Galaxy.

141
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,340
Batista.

142
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,280
Batista.

144
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,420
People were saying...

145
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,200
No, it's just like the John Cena versus Batista match.

146
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,500
All over again.

147
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,320
All over again.

148
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,880
And like...

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,340
True.

150
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,240
Nope.

151
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,940
I'll show you guys the clip.

152
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,240
It's literally basically what happened.

153
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,700
What I did to...

154
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,400
What I did to Beto...

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,260
Is basically...

156
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,600
What happened in WWE.

157
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,940
It was...

158
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,860
Almost the same thing.

159
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
I'm basically...

160
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,200
The CEO...

161
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,120
Of WrestleTuber.

162
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,740
But like the one that...

163
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,160
The type of CEO that doesn't get arrested.

164
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,240
Not like...

165
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
Not like the WWE.

166
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,300
I would not like to be compared to the CEO...

167
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,540
To the ex-CEO.

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,700
Of WWE.

169
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,440
Because he got arrested for things.

170
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,960
And I am...

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Not that type.

172
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,360
Too soon.

173
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,740
Bro, that happened in January.

174
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,900
That was like fucking sick.

175
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Almost six months ago, guys.

176
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,940
It's not too soon.

177
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,280
Nam, thank you for the super chat.

178
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,600
Thank you.

179
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
The best part for me...

180
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,420
Alongside seeing the Fable, Doki and Mint collab...

181
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,240
Was being introduced to so many new people.

182
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,240
I went from not knowing Nana to joining her membership.

183
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,680
And that's just one example.

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,540
Thank you for the super chat.

185
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:21,960
Thank you.

186
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,780
Yeah, I think that's why I really wanted...

187
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,560
To do these types of...

188
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:27,960
Events.

189
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,560
Because like this is what we're missing.

190
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,520
In the...

191
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,640
In the NA...

192
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,620
Not just NA, but I would say...

193
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,680
We had Europeans joining WrestleTuber.

194
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,940
And also not just Europeans.

195
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,760
But also people from Asia joining...

196
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
People from Asia joining WrestleTuber.

197
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,060
But I feel like this is what we're missing...

198
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,000
In the English side.

199
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,160
In the Western VTuber scene.

200
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,640
With events that unite...

201
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,020
Different companies...

202
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,520
Different fan bases...

203
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Indies, corporate...

204
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,320
Sorry.

205
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,200
I choked on water a little earlier.

206
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,820
But I muted so you guys didn't know.

207
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,620
But indies, corporate and everything...

208
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,300
Just smaller channels...

209
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,480
And big channels...

210
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,920
Working together in a very fun event.

211
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,960
And I felt like that was something we were missing.

212
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,300
We were missing that in the...

213
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,120
Western side of VTubing.

214
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,660
And this was something I've always wanted to do.

215
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,180
It has always been on my roadmap to have something that was open to...

216
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,600
Different companies.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,140
And I was really happy to be able to do it.

218
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,850
And I was really happy I was able to...

219
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,110
Plan something like this.

220
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,430
Um...

221
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,610
And being able to...

222
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,270
Invite so many people...

223
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,430
Joining in as well.

224
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,310
I reached out to a lot of people.

225
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,330
Sending invites out.

226
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,110
And I didn't really...

227
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,330
And I wanted...

228
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,090
Different...

229
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,490
Even though there might be small VTubers...

230
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,850
I always wanted them to have a chance.

231
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,370
Especially with like...

232
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:56,850
Xprism.

233
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,450
I was happy to invite them over.

234
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,550
I think like Xprism was like...

235
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,290
The first group of people I invited.

236
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,990
To WrestleTuber.

237
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,750
They were the first invites I sent out.

238
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,490
I'm pretty sure.

239
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,750
And from there I sent out invites to all the other companies.

240
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,150
And also the indies as well.

241
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,410
Uh...

242
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,370
Uh...

243
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,990
Thank you!

244
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,790
Congratulations!

245
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,550
On your first big event!

246
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,530
Sounds like you're working so hard.

247
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,670
Thank you!

248
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,290
Uh...

249
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,890
Next week I'm definitely gonna...

250
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,870
Chill next week.

251
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,670
Most likely I will have a rest week.

252
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,670
For next week.

253
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,750
So...

254
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,390
Because this week I couldn't really chill yet.

255
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,150
Uh...

256
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,050
Because I did have like prior obligations.

257
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,550
That I had to do.

258
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,390
Especially with the rest stuff.

259
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,030
Because the rest thing is ending on the 31st.

260
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,150
And I felt bad because they invited me.

261
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,310
It's a huge rest streaming server.

262
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,970
Like a lot of the big names are part of it.

263
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,410
And I got like the...

264
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,170
Invite to join.

265
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,610
And like there's not a lot of VTubers in there too.

266
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,810
So I thought it was like...

267
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,430
Oh this is such a rare invite to join the server.

268
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,870
So I was like... Oh fuck.

269
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,310
I should do at least one day.

270
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,550
I should try out...

271
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,750
I should try...

272
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,470
Yeah the rest kingdom.

273
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,210
I was like...

274
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,790
Oh man I should try at least one day.

275
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,810
There's always next week.

276
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,610
There isn't though.

277
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,250
That's the thing.

278
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,910
The rest server is ending like literally in three days.

279
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,650
So...

280
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,990
It's ending on the 31st.

281
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,850
So I was like...

282
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,750
Oh man I need to do at least one day.

283
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:30,930
Okay.

284
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,650
Just check it out.

285
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,950
Just check it out.

286
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,190
Thank you for the Aka Aka soup again.

287
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:38,950
Thank you.

288
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:41,710
Um...

289
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,650
And...

290
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,630
Oh my gosh.

291
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,670
Okay for behind the scenes stuff.

292
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,230
I want to say a huge shout out to the people I contacted.

293
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,650
To make the secret wrestlers.

294
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,830
Because like...

295
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,170
For like Bettle2.

296
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,630
Mint, Matara.

297
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,550
And Yuusan.

298
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,250
Huge shout out to the two...

299
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,970
The two people I contacted.

300
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,250
Let me see.

301
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,630
I didn't put them on the credits.

302
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,530
Because I forgot to ask the graphics people to put them on the...

303
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,290
To put them on the credits page.

304
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,770
But it was...

305
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,610
Sir Wheat...

306
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,330
Sir Wheatbread and...

307
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:19,690
Snakehisshiss.

308
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,370
They both made the secret wrestlers.

309
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,210
For...

310
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,650
For all of them.

311
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,150
So huge shout out to them.

312
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,810
For making the wrestlers.

313
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,110
Um...

314
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,830
What else?

315
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,270
I was like...

316
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,670
Keep it secret.

317
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,450
I was like...

318
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,850
Don't tell anybody.

319
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,090
No one can know.

320
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,310
They are going to appear.

321
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,870
It has to be secret.

322
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,890
To be fair.

323
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,890
The Mint and Matara...

324
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,670
The Mint and Matara wrestlers...

325
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,210
Were super last minute.

326
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,050
Like literally a day...

327
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,690
A day before they debuted.

328
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,250
And so like...

329
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,210
Huge shout out for them to...

330
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,310
To make those...

331
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,630
To make the wrestlers.

332
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,910
Because they are literally like...

333
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,070
I literally asked them the day before...

334
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,310
The day before they like...

335
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,310
Appeared on stream.

336
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,410
Um...

337
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,990
Matara was the day before.

338
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,290
She appeared on stream.

339
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,610
And then Mint was like...

340
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,310
The day before the first day.

341
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,470
The day before the first... like Saturday basically.

342
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,990
They finished it on Friday.

343
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,570
So yeah.

344
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,570
Huge shout out...

345
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,050
To them for making those wrestlers...

346
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,710
At the last minute.

347
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,870
Oh my gosh.

348
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,650
My voice is slowly dying.

349
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,070
And yeah.

350
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,450
NDA is like...

351
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,110
Trust me.

352
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,810
Source me.

353
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,970
That's the NDA.

354
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,990
Don't leak.

355
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,530
Source me.

356
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:56,990
I'm not...

357
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,570
If they leak it, then I would know.

358
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,730
Because I literally told them.

359
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,510
They were the only people I told.

360
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,710
So like...

361
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,510
Because even people in the server didn't know...

362
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,310
Until the day of...

363
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,230
The event.

364
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,430
So like...

365
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,630
I did say there might be...

366
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,410
Surprised guests.

367
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,370
But they didn't know until...

368
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,570
The day of the event started.

369
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,270
So like...

370
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,030
Yousan got invited to the server on Sunday.

371
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,550
Like on Sunday...

372
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,930
Before we started the stream.

373
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,350
And like, Mint also.

374
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,970
Mint got invited to the server on Saturday.

375
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,590
I think like an hour before the stream started.

376
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,670
So like, I kept that secret.

377
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,190
Also, Beto too as well.

378
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,730
Like I kept all the guest appearances a secret until the day of.

379
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,010
So like, if it was leaked, then I would know who leaked it.

380
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,050
I would know exactly who leaked it.

381
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,030
Because I told a very limited amount of people.

382
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,690
Yes, Beto too joined the server like...

383
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,790
Like an hour before Saturday.

384
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,050
So like an hour before the stream for Saturday started.

385
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,450
So like, they were all like a secret.

386
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,870
So a huge shout out to Beto for letting me invite Beto too.

387
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,430
I was like, hey, I didn't realize Beto too was like a real person.

388
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,210
Like, are you okay?

389
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,090
Like, do you want to play?

390
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,450
I was like, are you okay with inviting your twin over?

391
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,210
And he was like, so...

392
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,050
You know, she was like, yo, that's me so funny.

393
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,110
Like, yeah, let's do it.

394
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,810
I was like, don't worry about making a Beto too.

395
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,530
Buy WWE 2K24 because I know it's very expensive.

396
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,130
Don't worry, I'll get somebody to make him.

397
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,390
So yeah, even the videos.

398
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,370
The videos, like the surprise appearances with Mint and Matara.

399
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,790
Those were done like the day of.

400
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,530
Like the day they were going to appear.

401
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,950
The videos were shown.

402
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,350
That my video editor, shout out to my video editor.

403
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,690
They like made it the day of...

404
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,330
The day of their appearance too.

405
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,790
Because I had the idea and I was like, can you make it?

406
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,450
And they're like, oh yeah.

407
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,930
They're like, are you sure?

408
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,390
And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can make it.

409
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,030
We can do it.

410
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,370
So huge, huge shout out to my team.

411
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,170
By the way, for those who don't know.

412
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,510
This whole event was practically almost solely ran by me.

413
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,270
Including me running the OBS and everything.

414
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,650
Because I wanted to see if I could do it.

415
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,170
And then I also wanted to see like, okay, like...

416
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,710
How should this be ran?

417
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,370
Like how should this be done in a way?

418
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,250
So like I think like next year.

419
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,710
When I do WrestleTuber 2025 again.

420
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,370
I'm definitely going to give it to another person to run the OBS.

421
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,110
So that it's less scuffed.

422
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,570
But like now that I know how it should go.

423
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,130
Like at least I can like direct it better.

424
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,030
Like I can direct it better.

425
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,010
I can direct it in a better way.

426
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,970
In terms of like, oh okay.

427
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,950
I've done this before.

428
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,370
Then I know how like this should go.

429
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,430
Like how to do the scenes and everything.

430
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,270
How to do the swaps.

431
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,470
Especially when I'm running like new programs and stuff.

432
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,090
Where like...

433
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,450
With like guest caster and everything.

434
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:33,530
So like I'm just figuring stuff out on how the whole stream was going to be like.

435
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,570
So like now that I know how to do it myself.

436
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,030
Then like me telling someone else to do it.

437
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,450
And like controlling it.

438
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,310
I feel like it would be definitely easier.

439
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,650
Because I have the better...

440
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,370
Like I know how it can be done.

441
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,070
So like you know.

442
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,290
Instead of like putting images on live.

443
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,150
Like...

444
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,150
Like you're like who's next.

445
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,970
And then there's like a fucking giant picture.

446
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,710
That's like...

447
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,190
That's like leaking out to other scenes.

448
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,970
And then have to like resize it live.

449
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,530
That's not going to happen.

450
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,270
For next year.

451
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,730
For next year it's not...

452
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,650
We won't be resizing images live.

453
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,650
And everything.

454
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,870
So...

455
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,810
So at least like I have a better vision.

456
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,390
On how things are going to go.

457
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,510
And another shout out to all the people that created wrestlers.

458
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,090
For everybody.

459
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,330
For like all the other...

460
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,050
All the other participants.

461
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,990
Like I know it's a lot of work.

462
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,910
Because when people were creating it themselves.

463
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,410
Literally streams would be like 3 plus hours sometimes.

464
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,370
So like a huge shout out.

465
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,290
A huge shout out to the people who were creating.

466
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,130
The fans who were creating wrestlers for us as well.

467
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,100
And also like making them so accurate.

468
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,440
To the character.

469
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,000
To like the VTubers.

470
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,340
Because whoever fucking made the Fillion.

471
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,820
The Fillion wrestler.

472
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,640
And made that wrestler flip like 200,000 times.

473
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,320
That was so accurate.

474
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,680
I was just like...

475
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,560
I was just like watch the Fillion.

476
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,680
I feel like Fillion's wrestler.

477
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,620
Was honestly one of the most memorable for me.

478
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,740
Because all she did was flip.

479
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,280
She would flip like 200,000...

480
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,700
Fucking thousand times.

481
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,660
That's all she would do.

482
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,560
It was just...

483
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,380
It was so accurate.

484
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,640
I couldn't believe how accurate this was.

485
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,420
She was so fucking fast.

486
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
She would flip and dance.

487
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,140
Yeah.

488
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,080
So...

489
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,800
Huge shout out to everybody that made a wrestler.

490
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,080
And like made it so accurate to the actual person.

491
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,060
It was actually crazy.

492
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,540
Oh yeah.

493
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,840
Before I talk more about WrestleTuber.

494
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,740
I also really want to talk about Anime North.

495
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
Okay so like...

496
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,360
I'll talk about...

497
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,160
I talked about this during the panel.

498
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,760
So those who were there at Anime North will remember what I said then.

499
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,720
But like...

500
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,020
I almost like had a panic attack before...

501
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,140
Before like it started.

502
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,540
Because...

503
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,300
Because I thought there was only 10 people that had showed up.

504
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,580
So...

505
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,320
Okay.

506
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,840
So like...

507
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,780
So basically...

508
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,640
When it was like 10...

509
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,080
The staff was like...

510
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,880
Oh...

511
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,380
We're gonna let people in now.

512
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,840
And I was like...

513
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,120
Okay.

514
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,280
And then literally only 10 people walked in.

515
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,700
I was like...

516
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,740
Oh...

517
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,080
That was just like...

518
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,160
I was like...

519
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,340
Oh...

520
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,200
I mean...

521
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,380
I guess...

522
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,280
And then...

523
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,040
And then...

524
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,160
And then I waited.

525
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,520
I was like...

526
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,320
Oh maybe...

527
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,140
Maybe like...

528
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,820
You know...

529
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,700
People didn't...

530
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Only 10 people were there early.

531
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,880
And then...

532
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,140
And then I...

533
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,000
And then I was just like...

534
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,940
Okay that's okay Doki.

535
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,760
Yeah.

536
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,500
You're so silly Doki.

537
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,880
When you think there's that many people that are gonna see you.

538
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,100
And then...

539
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,160
And then like...

540
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,740
And then like...

541
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,780
Literally like...

542
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,680
3 minutes later...

543
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,380
More people started showing up.

544
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,840
But then it went from 10...

545
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,660
To like...

546
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,020
30.

547
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,240
So I was like...

548
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,520
Oh that's a lot better.

549
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,940
I was just like...

550
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,060
Oh...

551
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,340
That's...

552
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,460
That's a lot better.

553
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,620
30 people is a lot better.

554
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,160
And then literally on...

555
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,340
At the...

556
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,600
At 8.30...

557
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,460
EST...

558
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,600
Cause it was like EST...

559
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,460
Like Eastern Time.

560
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,180
Like...

561
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,020
When the panel was about to...

562
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,320
Like was supposed to start.

563
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
Suddenly like 600 people started...

564
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,780
Fucking getting into the room.

565
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,560
And I was like...

566
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,360
Holy fuck.

567
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,120
I was just...

568
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,480
I was just like...

569
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,360
Oh my god.

570
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,780
I was like...

571
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,620
What happened?

572
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,700
Were all of you just late?

573
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,480
I was so surprised.

574
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,340
I was like...

575
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,300
600...

576
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,340
Cause like the maximum amount was 600.

577
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,660
Um...

578
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,360
So then I was like...

579
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,500
Were all of you just fucking late?

580
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,260
Like what the fuck happened?

581
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,020
But apparently people...

582
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,080
There was a lot of people outside.

583
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,600
And like...

584
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,120
Um...

585
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,020
Apparently staff had to give like...

586
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,920
Tickets or something.

587
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,580
To like make sure...

588
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,080
You guys don't go above the fire hazard.

589
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,960
Uh...

590
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,400
Like...

591
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,320
Um...

592
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,900
So like there were a lot of people actually lining up.

593
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,120
But then they had to give like wristbands or something.

594
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,560
So that's why people were...

595
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,520
Um...

596
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,260
They couldn't let everybody in right away.

597
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,780
Because they all had to get wristbanded.

598
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,980
So like when...

599
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,000
When...

600
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,440
When everybody like 600 people got wristbanded.

601
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,560
They let them in.

602
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,240
So they let them in at exactly 830.

603
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,620
So I was so...

604
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:51,880
I was...

605
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,980
I was like so sad.

606
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,040
Cause I was like...

607
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,940
Oh man.

608
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,400
I was thinking...

609
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
Maybe...

610
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,620
Maybe I should do less conventions.

611
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,580
Cause I was like...

612
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,100
You know...

613
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,960
30 people.

614
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,560
Like I feel so bad.

615
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,560
Cause they're paying...

616
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,180
They're paying me to be here at these conventions too.

617
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,160
So I was like...

618
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh man.

619
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,080
If I only brought 30 people.

620
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm so...

621
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,660
I'll be...

622
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm so...

623
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,760
I feel bad.

624
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:13,980
I'm so...

625
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,020
I feel...

626
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,360
I made them pay...

627
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,140
I made them pay so much money for me to be here.

628
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,340
And then...

629
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,960
And then 600 dragoons showed up.

630
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,380
And I was like...

631
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,080
Oh thank god.

632
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,220
My price was just...

633
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,740
I'm joking.

634
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,640
I'm joking.

635
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,120
I don't charge that much.

636
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,380
But like...

637
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,460
But also in my mind I was like...

638
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,960
Oh thank god.

639
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,260
Okay.

640
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,200
I did not...

641
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,280
I did not...

642
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,020
Like...

643
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,500
Like...

644
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,240
What's the word?

645
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,140
I was not too expensive.

646
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,980
I was not too expensive.

647
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,640
It was justified.

648
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,680
For how much I charge to be here.

649
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,840
Yeah.

650
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,140
Not a scammer.

651
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,720
Not a scammer because I over...

652
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,140
Like I filled the entire hall.

653
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,480
Apparently a lot of people wanted to still be there.

654
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,880
But of course...

655
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,460
Like I said...

656
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,640
Like...

657
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,780
Because...

658
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,980
We couldn't have that much at the convention.

659
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,440
I have more than 600 people because of fire safety.

660
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,480
So apparently we did have to turn people away.

661
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,520
But do not worry!

662
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,760
There's gonna be a lot of other conventions.

663
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,780
For the Joki World Tour.

664
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,720
So don't worry guys.

665
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,410
I had to sneeze.

666
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,220
Sorry, I'm okay now.

667
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,280
I had to sneeze and blow my nose.

668
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,460
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

669
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:48,720
But yes!

670
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,740
Thank you everybody for showing up to Anime North.

671
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
I really do appreciate it.

672
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,120
The very first convention I did...

673
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,840
I did as Dohia.

674
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,640
And being able to do a Canadian convention was great.

675
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,320
I've never done a Canadian convention before.

676
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,640
So I was really happy to be able to visit people at Anime North and do a panel.

677
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,100
Apparently a lot of people had a lot of fun at the panel.

678
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,020
That's great.

679
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,320
I told some stories that I couldn't tell on stream.

680
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,180
So...

681
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,140
If you were there, you would know exactly why I can't tell that story on stream.

682
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,400
So they got some exclusive stories.

683
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,060
Just for panels.

684
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,360
What exactly?

685
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,940
Should have been in Toronto, bro.

686
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,740
Should have been in Toronto.

687
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,480
Should have been there.

688
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,320
I have exclusive convention stories that I cannot tell on stream.

689
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,300
Because it's a little spicy.

690
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,960
Spicy as in like controversial.

691
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,280
Actual paywall.

692
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,360
Welcome to member goons.

693
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,260
Now you know how the gray name feels.

694
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,360
Like...

695
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,240
Now...

696
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,340
Now you know how they feel.

697
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,260
Okay, it's not that controversial.

698
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,180
Okay, I might have like...

699
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,960
Maybe now...

700
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,200
Okay.

701
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,100
Okay, now I fucking sold...

702
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,380
Over-hyped it too much.

703
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,780
Like oversold that story.

704
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,600
It's not that controversial.

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,660
It's just that like...

706
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,520
It just...

707
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,880
I just...

708
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,360
I just shouldn't be a story I tell on stream.

709
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,420
Don't sit down to their level.

710
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,800
Now you need to tell...

711
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,740
No, I can't tell you guys.

712
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,040
Just like...

713
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,080
Just like ask some of the dragoons that were there.

714
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,600
Like ask the dragoons that were there what the story was on discord or something.

715
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,940
Or on social media.

716
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,380
But like...

717
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,740
I know you guys are gonna be like...

718
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,800
But it's not the same Doki.

719
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,680
It's not the same when...

720
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,760
Like it's not coming out of your mouth.

721
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,460
Well, too bad.

722
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,720
You should have been in Toronto.

723
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,420
What?

724
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,780
Just go to the other community.

725
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,640
I'll tell...

726
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,460
I'll retell the story at the other conventions.

727
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,800
And then you can be special too guys.

728
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,960
Um...

729
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,640
You can...

730
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,060
It's not the same.

731
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,540
We have so many conventions guys.

732
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,460
Just show up at any of the other conventions.

733
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,760
Don't worry.

734
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,740
It's not just gonna be in Canada guys.

735
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,700
It's the world tour.

736
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,560
And the world...

737
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,060
It consists more than just Canada.

738
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,120
So like...

739
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,000
You go to the...

740
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,220
Atua Fae Wall.

741
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,120
What?

742
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,760
They have to get there?

743
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,880
They have to get their money's worth guys.

744
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,940
The conventions have to get their money's worth.

745
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,160
Um...

746
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,300
So I'll retell that story in the other conventions.

747
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,860
You just have to make sure when we're at the panel for Q&A.

748
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,440
And you go there and be like...

749
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,080
Can you tell us your Fae Wall stories?

750
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,380
You have to...

751
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,480
I won't tell the story unless like I'm giving the question.

752
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,480
Regarding like the Fae Wall story.

753
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,080
So like if you've never heard the convention Fae Wall story.

754
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,540
Just make sure.

755
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,680
We go to whatever convention I'm gonna show up.

756
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,280
And then you'll be like...

757
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,800
Doki!

758
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,780
Can you like tell us that story?

759
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,980
That you exclusively Fae Walled for just conventions?

760
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,540
And then I'll tell you the story.

761
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,940
I'll tell you...

762
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
And then...

763
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,840
And then you can be part of the special club.

764
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,180
You can be part of the special exclusive story club.

765
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,520
That you would know.

766
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,360
And you'll be like...

767
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,120
I know the special story.

768
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Damn Collins Fae Walled Satch.

769
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,540
What if she keeps making up the...

770
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,140
Making a new Fae...

771
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,640
Oh yeah.

772
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,200
Each convention I go to.

773
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,600
I tell a very exclusive story.

774
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,100
So like it's like...

775
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,900
You know how like at conventions you collect t-shirts and stuff.

776
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,500
So as like a memorabilia for the convention.

777
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,160
So like for the Doki memorabilia.

778
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,920
It's like each convention.

779
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,720
You collect exclusive convention story.

780
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,920
The fear...

781
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,340
No my fault.

782
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,720
Each convention you change the story a little bit.

783
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,800
Oh don't give me ideas guys.

784
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,700
Don't...

785
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,160
Just like...

786
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,440
Yay.

787
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,460
Oh.

788
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,840
Don't give me some beautiful brilliant ideas chat.

789
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,600
The follow is hitting me hard.

790
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,580

But yeah, anyway.

821
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,020
Had a great time at Anime North.

822
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,920
The hour really passed by so fast.

823
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,460
It just felt like had a really great time just like talking to the dragoons there.

824
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,340
And um...

825
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,840
We had one...

826
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,120
Okay, I can talk about this guy.

827
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,940
Cause like he literally is not even a dragoon.

828
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,840
Like he... There's this one guy that managed to get to the Q&A part because a lot of people wanted to ask me questions, yeah?

829
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,820
And we had an hour.

830
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,020
So like one of the guy... One of the guys that was in the fucking line did not even know who I was.

831
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,360
Like he just went to the...

832
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,980
He literally just went to the panel cause a lot of people were there.

833
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,900
So he was like, I'm gonna go to this panel.

834
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,280
Because so many other people were lining up.

835
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,920
And then he got picked for a question.

836
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,700
And he was like in the Q&A, he was like I don't know who you are.

837
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,240
But like I saw a lot of people lining up so I came along and I was like, wait are you serious?

838
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
And he was like, yeah I don't...

839
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,860
I don't even know what question he asked.

840
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,720
He just was like, I don't know who you are.

841
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,960
And like, but I called him out.

842
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,640
I called him out and I was like Bro, you literally took this spot from...

843
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,040
You literally took this spot from somebody who wanted to ask a question.

844
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,600
And he's like, well I guess so.

845
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,160
Bro, like I don't even...

846
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:07,500
Like when he said that it actually like blew my mind that I don't even remember what he asked of me.

847
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,680
Like I don't even remember what kind of question he asked.

848
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,260
He just...

849
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,520
He actually went up to the line just to be like, I don't know who you are.

850
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,340
Boo.

851
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,560
Like it was actually crazy.

852
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,820
I was like, how do you...

853
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,980
Why did you...

854
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,800
Why did you come up to line?

855
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,320
You were this guy's side mission.

856
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,760
Thank you Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

857
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,820
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,200
Oh my gosh.

866
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,900
It was so much...

867
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,400
It was so much work.

868
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:05,700
It was so much work.

869
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,520
Oh, DarkBlade!

870
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,100
Yeah, I messed up DarkBlade's name cause like he said...

871
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,340
I thought he said Darkwing.

872
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,260
I was like, wait I remember seeing Darkwing on chat.

873
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,780
I was like, yeah I know a Darkwing.

874
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,560
And he's like, no Darkblade.

875
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,660
And I was like, oh I also know a Darkblade.

876
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,000

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,700

Thank you, thank you.

880
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,640
I'm gonna introduce myself to Doki and she got my name wrong.

881
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,280
I didn't get your name wrong the first time.

882
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,940
You just weren't loud enough so I like thought I heard Darkwing and he exists.

883
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay, Darkwing exists.

884
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,440
He also exists, Darkblade.

885
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:56,840
He also exists, Darkblade.

886
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:56,860
He also exists, Darkblade.

887
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,520
You can't just claim all the Dark names, man.

888
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,300
You can't just claim all the Dark names, man.

889
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,640
He's real to me.

890
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,580
They all exist, guys.

891
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,340
Where?

892
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,320

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,480

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,720
And like putting...

that last minute.

916
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,660
Um, because I got all my assets the day before.

917
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,140
And I was so tired.

918
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,740
I was originally gonna take a nap and then like...

919
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,020

920
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,800
before the tournament.

921
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,020
But I ended up sleeping.

922
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,600
I ended up...

923
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,280
I ended up sleeping so late.

924
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,920
I think like three to four hours...

925
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
before the actual...

926
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,000
uh, actual like the Apex tournament.

927
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,820
I was just compiling everything.

928
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,920
As fast as I can.

929
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,860
And then...

930
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,120
an hour before... um...

931
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,800
an hour before the... like you know...

932
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,960
after the Apex tournament was over...

933
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,900
I had to still set up stuff...

934
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,240
for the WrestleTuber things.

935
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,060
And I'm like...

936
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,640
Oh my god!

937
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,100
Why did I...

938
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,760
decided like, you know... I was like...

939
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,080
regretting the choice of...

940
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,120
uh... the choice of...

941
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,080
doing everything myself at that...

942
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,420
moment.

943
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,400
I was like... Why?

944
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,900
Why did I do all this myself?

945
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,100
Why?

946
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,700
I was like...

947
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,200
I was like...

948
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,000
I was like... Oh my god...

949
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,740
Doki, you're so fucking stupid!

950
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,160
Why did you ask for help?

951
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,100
Why are you doing...

952
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,520
this yourself, Doki?

953
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,080
You can literally ask...

954
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,440
people to help you!

955
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,120
And... but then... it was all okay.

956
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,080
It went... it went okay guys.

957
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,680
Everything was okay.

958
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,080
Okay guys!

959
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,500
Oh...

960
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,860
past Doki...

961
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,560
That's something I'm definitely... like I said...

962
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,580
for WrestleTuber 2025...

963
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm definitely gonna like... have...

964
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,960
someone else handle the OPS stuff.

965
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,900
Um... handling the scenes...

966
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,240
and everything.

967
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,540
Making sure like...

968
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,720
all the scene stuff is running...

969
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,340
okay instead of me...

970
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,800
you know... putting everything together.

971
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,340
Yes!

972
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:43,740
Yes!

973
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,540
It was me running the chat!

974
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,320
I ran the chat polls too!

975
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,340
I ran the chat polls!

976
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,300
I handled the OPS!

977
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,960
I told the commentators who's gonna be fighting next.

978
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,800
I was like... the cast...

979
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,520
I was like directing everything.

980
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,960
Um...

981
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,040
I put all the graphics together.

982
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,380
I told... I like... told...

983
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,780
Like guided everything.

984
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,760
Scheduled everything.

985
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,360
It was all me.

986
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,900
Everything.

987
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,200
And also like...

988
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,920
all the other people that helped too.

989
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,600
Uh... we know because of Charlie.

990
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,860
Yeah that... that Charlie thing...

991
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,820
was so fucking funny.

992
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,520
Cause like... but then it was like...

993
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,660
Wait who's next?

994
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,940
And then I literally just wrote...

995
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,820
Charlie vs Octavio.

996
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,400
And like... cause I was like... there's no way...

997
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,380
that she actually doesn't know who Beto is.

998
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,600
There's no...

999
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,380
I was like... there's no way...

1000
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,940
The guest... the list... the participant list...

1001
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,180
and the bracket...

1002
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,100
was all there.

1003
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,220
Like...

1004
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,780
Like...

1005
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,600
I wrote it down.

1006
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,920
Then I just decided to test her.

1007
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
I was... I don't know.

1008
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,340
I just wanted to test her to see...

1009
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,380
to see if like... you know...

1010
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,240
If she really knew who...

1011
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,200
who Beto is.

1012
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,860
It was funny though.

1013
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,640
It was pretty funny that I actually...

1014
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
I got away with that.

1015
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,760
That was...

1016
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,780
hilarious.

1017
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,860
No it was just fucking funny.

1018
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,960
So funny.

1019
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,480
She not pass.

1020
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,280
I mean...

1021
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,560
It's funny to just fuck with people sometimes.

1022
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,140
You know?

1023
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,680
But yeah...

1024
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,680
Things I would do differently...

1025
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,280
for WrestleTuber...

1026
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,120
I think...

1027
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,320
I don't know.

1028
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,940
I don't know honestly.

1029
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:44,840
I don't know...

1030
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,900
Cause like I know...

1031
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,040
Like I was thinking...

1032
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,940
Maybe people should fight...

1033
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,760
You know... Instead of just straight off single elimination...

1034
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,980
There should be a double elimination.

1035
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,740
But I felt like the reason why I don't want to do a double elimination...

1036
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,460
Which means like...

1037
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,240
If you get knocked out the first time...

1038
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,980
You get to fight again in the losers bracket.

1039
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,940
But the reason why I don't want to...

1040
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,400
do a double elimination...

1041
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,040
Was because it's a lot of time.

1042
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,300
Because like single...

1043
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,800
Single elimination is already...

1044
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Like two days.

1045
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,020
You know?

1046
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,040
We already have...

1047
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,820
Like it already was a long time...

1048
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,000
For two days.

1049
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,440
So that's why I don't think I want to...

1050
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,840
Yeah that would just take way too long.

1051
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,180
And...

1052
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,860
I feel like two days is like...

1053
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,300
The perfect amount of days.

1054
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,420
And like because of that...

1055
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,120
I feel like...

1056
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,580
I like the amount of people we got.

1057
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,820
Like 20... What was it?

1058
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,960
Well to be fair we had a lot of surprise wrestlers.

1059
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,440
So I guess it would be like...

1060
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,320
Was it 33 wrestlers?

1061
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,220
I think it was like an okay amount...

1062
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,780
To have for...

1063
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,140
For it.

1064
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,120
Darkwing thank you for the Akasupa!

1065
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:52,800
Thank you!

1066
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,180
See I told you!

1067
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,460
I was not going crazy!

1068
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,780
Darkwing was real!

1069
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,300
You guys did not believe me!

1070
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,300
Darkwing is real!

1071
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,700
They said hi earlier.

1072
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,600
You didn't see it.

1073
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,240
You had to make that man...

1074
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,640
Super chat.

1075
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,300
So like he could exist for you guys.

1076
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
That's so fucked up.

1077
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,480
Like he only exists for you guys when he donates.

1078
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,940
That's so messed up.

1079
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,600
Dragoons.

1080
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,080
He's a real person.

1081
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,660
He's not just money.

1082
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,740
He's a fucking real Dragoon.

1083
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,940
It's messed up that it only took him to super chat for you guys to acknowledge his existence.

1084
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,740
Like I think...

1085
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,340
Darkwing you didn't have to donate.

1086
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,620
You didn't have to donate.

1087
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,400
To make them notice you.

1088
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,880
I already saw you with my eyes.

1089
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,840
Sir Weepred.

1090
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1091
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,680
Thank you.

1092
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,760
Spend a week to use different types of matches.

1093
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,520
Like casting match and steel cage.

1094
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,640
Thank you for the super chat.

1095
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:00,960
Thank you.

1096
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,620
I feel like for that.

1097
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,040
I feel like that's what show matches are for.

1098
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,660
I still want to keep the tournament format.

1099
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,440
I like that someone was trying to do like...

1100
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,500
Tag team.

1101
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,860
I like that idea.

1102
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,220
A tag team tournament.

1103
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,580
I don't know if...

1104
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,320
Can...

1105
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,420
Can like...

1106
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,020
WWE 2K24 do that?

1107
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,300
Is there like tag team tournaments that we could do?

1108
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,100
That's not like...

1109
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,440
Because if we can...

1110
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,600
Then I think a tag team tournament...

1111
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,220
Would be really fun too in the future.

1112
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,780
I don't know if that would be a thing for next year.

1113
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,600
But like I do like that idea.

1114
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,860
I do like that idea.

1115
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,750
And I think it would be fun.

1116
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,010
If it's like mixed as well.

1117
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,030
Like you spin the wheel to random teammates.

1118
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,510
So that like...

1119
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,870
You know people can...

1120
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,710
Form friendships over that.

1121
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,770
Because a really fun thing about it.

1122
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,210
Is just seeing all the friendships being formed as well.

1123
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,510
Like seeing...

1124
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,290
Seeing like people who normally don't interact with each other.

1125
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,430
Suddenly being like...

1126
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,430
Really close friends.

1127
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,830
Just from WrestleTuber.

1128
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:15,810
Like we are like...

1129
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,790
I really saw like so many friendships being formed.

1130
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,370
From other VTubers.

1131
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,770
And just like...

1132
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,570
People are now like close friends.

1133
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,190
And they are like...

1134
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,930
Following each other and hanging out and stuff like that.

1135
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,150
And I thought it was like...

1136
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,910
Really nice to see.

1137
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,930
It was really nice to see from WrestleTuber.

1138
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,470
Ummm...

1139
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,370
And like other VTubers.

1140
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,550
Getting to know other VTubers.

1141
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,490
And like the...

1142
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,510
The integration...

1143
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,070
Between like Twitch viewers.

1144
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,610
And corporate viewers.

1145
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,870
And indie viewers.

1146
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,110
Just coming together.

1147
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,750
For one big event.

1148
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:52,910
Ummm...

1149
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,930
It's been like super fun to see.

1150
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,310
Uhhh...

1151
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,290
I don't know what other changes I'll make.

1152
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,850
To the WrestleTuber format.

1153
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,290
Ummm...

1154
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,450
I think like usually...

1155
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,230
Like as usual.

1156
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,630
I might have like an open call.

1157
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,870
To see like...

1158
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:11,990
Because like...

1159
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,010
All the participants.

1160
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,410
Ummm...

1161
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,330
In WrestleTuber.

1162
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,830
Like I specifically reached out to.

1163
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,270
Ummm...

1164
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:22,230
And asked if they want to join.

1165
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,530
And I think like...

1166
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,570
Obviously I don't know a lot of...

1167
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,930
Some of them were like...

1168
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:29,750
I asked like...

1169
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,930
I wanted to invite some indies.

1170
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,730
I don't really know a lot of the indie community in VTubing.

1171
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,590
Because I was like...

1172
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:37,890
You know...

1173
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,430
I wasn't part of that circle.

1174
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,530
For like...

1175
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,110
I wasn't really part of that circle before.

1176
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,210
So like I didn't really know who were like big indies.

1177
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,890
And who were like well known indies.

1178
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,070
Ummm...

1179
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,010
In the community.

1180
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,970
So I did ask like some people like...

1181
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,070
Oh if you have any recommendations.

1182
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,490
Feel free to recommend me some indie VTubers.

1183
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,970
You would like to bring along as well.

1184
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,870
Like I would send the invite.

1185
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,910
Be like if you have any recommendations.

1186
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,870
Ummm... Like feel free to.

1187
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,270
Send in like...

1188
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,590
People you want to join.

1189
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,270
And I think like in the future.

1190
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,750
I would love to like...

1191
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,210
I guess like be like...

1192
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,970
Hey guys...

1193
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,770
If you make an open call I guess on Twitter.

1194
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,590
And be like...

1195
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,590
If you want to join WrestleTuber 2025.

1196
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,530
Just please like you know...

1197
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,150
Just throw your comment in.

1198
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,290
So I can like...

1199
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,330
Maybe you might get picked.

1200
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,290
It would definitely be a lot easier.

1201
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,210
It definitely would be a lot easier.

1202
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:38,810
It definitely would be a lot easier.

1203
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,110
To do.

1204
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,350
And so me reaching out to people.

1205
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,910
And like aligning schedules and stuff like that.

1206
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,190
Well if it's just like comments.

1207
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,730
I can just like send a DM.

1208
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,850
After like looking through the comments and stuff.

1209
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,650
But like I do want to keep it like...

1210
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,930
Like I guess like my max cutoff.

1211
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,750
Would be 30.

1212
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,490
Would be 30.

1213
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,790
That would be my max cutoff.

1214
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,330
Because like 2 days was...

1215
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,430
I think 2 days is the most optimal.

1216
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,210
You know like...

1217
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,430
I like how...

1218
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,110
I do like that I...

1219
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,410
It be my very first wrestling event.

1220
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,230
That I've ever organized.

1221
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,230
As DokiBraid.

1222
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,470
We didn't keep...

1223
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,390
We kept the...

1224
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,230
The interviews and stuff.

1225
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,430
Not that long.

1226
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,470
We tried to make sure the interviews did not look like...

1227
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,330
Last too long.

1228
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,070
Because I wasn't sure how long the matches were going to be.

1229
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,630
So I tried to make sure like...

1230
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,930
The interview portion didn't last too long.

1231
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:37,190
Um...

1232
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,030
So I did like that.

1233
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,430
As like a thing I did for this...

1234
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,030
This year.

1235
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,710
Um...

1236
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,910
Uh...

1237
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,770
It would be interesting to see what happens for next year.

1238
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:50,910
Uh...

1239
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,190
Perk...

1240
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,350
Thank you for the super chat.

1241
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:54,650
Thank you.

1242
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,030
Thank you.

1243
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,030
What about Hell in a Cell tournament match?

1244
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,010
WrestleTuber was amazing Doki.

1245
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,210
Hope to see more in the future.

1246
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,890
Um... I'm not sure yet.

1247
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:02,950
I don't know if I want to...

1248
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,630
Uh... deviate from the regular...

1249
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:06,290
One on one.

1250
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,750
Um... If anything I think I would love to do like...

1251
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,530
Tag team.

1252
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,750
Um... If I do want to deviate...

1253
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,150
And change something...

1254
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,590
Change something for the format.

1255
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,590
In terms of like the tournament format.

1256
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,210
I think like tag team would be like...

1257
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:21,990
Really fun to do.

1258
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,430
Just cause it's like...

1259
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,470
You know... 2v2 tag team.

1260
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,470
Or like... like you know... like tag each other out.

1261
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,370
And stuff.

1262
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,450
I think that would be like...

1263
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:29,930
Really fun.

1264
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,550
Um... a really fun...

1265
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,090
Tournament idea.

1266
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,330
Because like you know...

1267
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,050
There's more friendships being made from that.

1268
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,190
Hmm...

1269
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,150
Um...

1270
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,330
But we'll see.

1271
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,390
We'll see what the...

1272
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,050
Storyline will be next year.

1273
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,130
Uh...

1274
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,810
We'll see what it's gonna be like.

1275
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:48,970
Um... alright.

1276
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,450
The thing that everybody wants to know...

1277
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,170
Like...

1278
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,150
Always keep... cause like I think...

1279
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,490
Um... this is gonna be a short stream guys.

1280
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,770
I am still...

1281
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,090
Very exhausted.

1282
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,050
Like... I'm still...

1283
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:09,070
I am like...

1284
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:09,790
Really tired.

1285
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,450
So like... I'm really sorry I can't do...

1286
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,010
A super long stream today.

1287
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,810
Uh... for like the after party.

1288
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,230
I really...

1289
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,330
Okay... the reason... I really wanted to do the after party.

1290
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,190
After the...

1291
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,630
Uh... WrestleTuber.

1292
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,410
Uh... the WrestleTuber event was over.

1293
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,030
Cause usually after every event...

1294
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,830
I would do an after party.

1295
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,150
But um...

1296
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,190
I got caught... uh...

1297
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:30,590
What's the word?

1298
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,910
Uh... I think like Mintory told it already.

1299
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,130
But like basically what happened was that...

1300
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,030
Mint and I ended up talking for 4 plus hours.

1301
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,510
Last night... no not last night.

1302
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,110
The night before.

1303
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:40,730
Hahaha...

1304
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,150
Hahaha...

1305
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,570
I lost track of time.

1306
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,550
And we ended up just like...

1307
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,090
Catching up and talking for...

1308
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,170
Uh... 4 hours.

1309
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,070
Um... so I couldn't do... I didn't do the after party.

1310
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,930
And um...

1311
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,410
Like I said... usually...

1312
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,310
I know this is the story...

1313
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,610
That everybody wants to hear.

1314
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,290
Like...

1315
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,510
For all you guys that's tapped out right now...

1316
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,850
This is it guys.

1317
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,310
You can tap back in now to hear the story.

1318
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:13,550
Hahaha...

1319
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,690
Hahaha...

1320
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,130
Hahaha...

1321
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,630
Um...

1322
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:17,930
Anyway...

1323
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:19,690
Anyway...

1324
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,550
So um... a lot of you guys were wondering like...

1325
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,010
Oh... like was Mint a last minute addition?

1326
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:27,470
Yes...

1327
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,870
Uh... she is.

1328
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,290
Um... um... so...

1329
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,430
I think like I sort of like...

1330
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,450
I saw like what Mint said.

1331
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,110
So I wanted to make sure like...

1332
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,630
I said like similar stuff so that like...

1333
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,350
I don't like...

1334
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,370
Like you know...

1335
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,910
I just say like what she said already.

1336
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,990
Um... and add a little bit of info...

1337
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:47,870
Behind the scenes.

1338
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,270
Um...

1339
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,370
Basically...

1340
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,310
Oh my gosh I'm nervous now.

1341
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,090
Hahaha...

1342
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:57,030
Your nervousness is coming to me...

1343
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,090
Even though it's my story.

1344
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:58,990
Hahaha...

1345
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,710
It's like my story...

1346
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,010
And now you guys are making me nervous telling it.

1347
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,470
Hahaha...

1348
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:08,810
Hahaha...

1349
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:10,230
Um...

1350
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:11,790
Anyway...

1351
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,630
So um... like I said...

1352
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,270
Um... we only recently...

1353
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,210
Uh...

1354
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:19,850
Uh...

1355
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,430
Got... were able to...

1356
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,450
Talk again.

1357
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,510
Um... uh... so...

1358
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,530
I saw... like I'm just like remembering what she said.

1359
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,750
So I gotta make sure like...

1360
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,450
It says something.

1361
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,910
Um... and um...

1362
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,790
Um...

1363
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,710
Uh...

1364
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,650
She was the one that...

1365
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,110
Sorry if there's like pauses cause I have to think about what I'm saying.

1366
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,610
Hahaha...

1367
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,110
Hahaha...

1368
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,810
Basically she was the one...

1369
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,250
That initiated first.

1370
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,270
Um... and I really appreciate that.

1371
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,850
Because I think...

1372
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,830
Uh... I told her...

1373
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,530
I was like... I didn't... like...

1374
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,230
If she never initiated...

1375
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,130
I don't think I would have...

1376
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,890
Uh... I don't think like...

1377
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,150
We would have ever talked.

1378
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,030
Um... if she never initiated.

1379
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,250
Cause I would... I was never going to...

1380
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,130
Uh... I was never going to initiate first.

1381
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,090
Um... so...

1382
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,510
She was the one that...

1383
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:16,410
Uh...

1384
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:17,970
Um...

1385
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,110
She was the one that initiated first.

1386
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,010
By following me on Twitter.

1387
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,350
And... uh...

1388
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,370
I saw that she followed me on Twitter.

1389
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,210
And so...

1390
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,270
From there I followed her back.

1391
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,270
And... um...

1392
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,190
From that...

1393
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:37,390
My management team noticed...

1394
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,930
That we were following each other again.

1395
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,410
So...

1396
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,830
One of my staff members...

1397
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,450
In my management team...

1398
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,630
Actually sent an email out...

1399
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,190
To Mint.

1400
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,510
Asking if...

1401
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,310
Uh... she wanted to join WrestleTuber.

1402
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:53,470
Um...

1403
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,190
Cause it was already announced.

1404
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,370
And I guess you guys can get the timeline of everything.

1405
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,430
Cause people who could see...

1406
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,870
Like how...

1407
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,230
When we followed each other.

1408
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,190
And... uh...

1409
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,970
From there... my management team...

1410
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,390
And then Mint responded back.

1411
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,050
And my management team...

1412
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,390
One of my staff members...

1413
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,430
Gave her my Discord.

1414
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:17,230
And then we connected back from there.

1415
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,150
And... like... you know...

1416
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,270
We talked a lot...

1417
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,490
Like in Discord.

1418
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,350
And then from there...

1419
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,190
We had like a 4 hour...

1420
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,470
After WrestleTuber...

1421
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,730
We had a 4 hour...

1422
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,410
Chatting and reconnecting and everything.

1423
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:33,830
Um...

1424
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,390
That was really nice.

1425
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,870
It was very...

1426
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,690
I guess therapeutic to say.

1427
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,890
It was very therapeutic to be able to talk to her again.

1428
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,030
Um...

1429
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,210
Because I know like...

1430
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,790
There was a lot of questions regarding this.

1431
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,490
But... um...

1432
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,590
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

1433
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,650
Um... so like...

1434
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:54,770
That's why I never...

1435
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,650
Reached out to her.

1436
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,290
Um... and...

1437
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,210
Because I didn't know where I was at.

1438
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,610
For a lot of things.

1439
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,330
So like... I didn't want to intrude.

1440
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,230
Or like... I didn't know where I was.

1441
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:09,690
Um...

1442
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,330
For it.

1443
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,030
So that's why... uh...

1444
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:14,750
That's why I told her.

1445
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,350
I was like...

1446
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,270
If you never initiated...

1447
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,270
I would have never like...

1448
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,150
Tried anything.

1449
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:23,910
Because it was more so of like...

1450
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,550
Oh... um...

1451
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,250
Um... I didn't...

1452
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,030
I just didn't... I was scared.

1453
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:30,230
Hahaha...

1454
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,970
Hahaha...

1455
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,510
I was just really...

1456
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,250
I just didn't know where I was at.

1457
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,570
So that's why... uh...

1458
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,310
I really appreciate that she like...

1459
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,610
Uh... took the first step.

1460
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:44,330
You know?

1461
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,050
And... uh...

1462
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,910
And then some people were asking...

1463
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,890
Um... was Matara also...

1464
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,570
Last minute?

1465
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,770
Yes, she was...

1466
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,950
Last minute as well.

1467
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,110
Uh... it was... we... I asked Mint...

1468
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,090
Uh... after the first day was over.

1469
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,010
I asked Mint...

1470
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,910
I was like... hey... like... you know...

1471
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,290
Do you want to fight Matara?

1472
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,850
Like does Matara want to join?

1473
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:05,250
You know?

1474
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,010
Like... because I was like... we do have like... two spots.

1475
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:08,570
Here.

1476
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,150
Like you know... like the...

1477
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,970
Hahaha... like because I like...

1478
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,010
I realized... oh shit wait... we have like...

1479
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:14,010
two spots.

1480
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,570
I did my math wrong.

1481
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,490
With the brackets.

1482
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:20,370
And like... you know...

1483
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,810
I was like... oh shit... I forgot.

1484
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,750
We have like that section.

1485
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,290
You know... missing.

1486
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,030
And then usually... like I was thinking...

1487
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,810
Like oh okay... we'll just like grab somebody.

1488
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,310
We'll just like grab somebody...

1489
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:36,090
Who's like... who got eliminated early on.

1490
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,250
And...

1491
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,850
Who got eliminated early on and then put like...

1492
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:40,630
Put them back in.

1493
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,750
But then I was one...

1494
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,710
I was like thinking... you know... like I think... you know...

1495
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,610
Mint and Matara fighting... like...

1496
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,010
Hahaha... I don't know.

1497
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,170
The Mint and Matara fight... I feel like...

1498
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,630
People would really want to see it.

1499
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,790
So I asked Mint if like Matara was down.

1500
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,910
And Matara said that she was down.

1501
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,130
Even though like... you know... she was on vacation.

1502
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,830
She would love to be part of the...

1503
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:01,870
Mint versus...

1504
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,370
Like Matara fight.

1505
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,310
The hag fight.

1506
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:04,870
Hag fight!

1507
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:05,510
Hag fight!

1508
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:07,350
Hahaha...

1509
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:08,990
Hahaha...

1510
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,150
Sweet thank you for the agenda... super...

1511
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,650
Thank you... thank you... um... and that's how...

1512
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,690
Matara got involved into...

1513
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:16,930
WrestleTuber.

1514
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,210
And I really appreciate...

1515
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,930
Matara for... uh... joining...

1516
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,950
As well since... like I said she was on her vacation.

1517
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,870
And I think she still did...

1518
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,650
Oh no she came back.

1519
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,870
I saw that she recently...

1520
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,090
Was streaming... she's streaming today.

1521
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:27,810
So...

1522
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,150
Uh... she was on her vacation.

1523
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,150
And so I really appreciate Matara sending in...

1524
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,550
Like the voice lines and stuff.

1525
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,010
And uh... shout out to my editor...

1526
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,050
For making the...

1527
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,070
The video 3 hours before the event!

1528
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:40,810
Hahaha...

1529
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,610
My editor...

1530
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,790
Literally made the video...

1531
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,950
3 to 4 hours before it was...

1532
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,010
Like about to start.

1533
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:48,590
So...

1534
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,690
For day 2...

1535
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,270
So like huge shout out to my editor...

1536
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,370
For getting that done.

1537
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,090
Um...

1538
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,310
Cause I was like to my editor...

1539
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:00,250
Can you do it?

1540
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:01,190
I'm really sorry...

1541
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,590
Like this is so last minute...

1542
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,350
I was like I'm so sorry...

1543
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,610
Like this is such a last minute edition...

1544
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,530
And then we just got...

1545
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,530
Like we just got the voice lines and stuff...

1546
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:12,550
Um...

1547
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,850
Like the morning of the day 2...

1548
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,030
So... uh... so yeah like...

1549
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,470
That's basically how Matara got involved.

1550
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,270
Uh... Yuson...

1551
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,570
Has been... has actually been invited...

1552
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,710
For a while...

1553
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,550
Uh... like I think it was like the day after...

1554
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,390
The announcement...

1555
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,710
Um... that Yuson was invited...

1556
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,490
And that was always my plan because I thought it would be really fucking funny...

1557
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,390
Cause I was just thinking about you know like...

1558
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,330
Like Yuson coming in with the seal...

1559
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,870
The fucking seal chair...

1560
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:40,630
Like you know like...

1561
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,570
I thought... I thought it was...

1562
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,950
I thought it would be really funny...

1563
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,050
And it was like... Yuson like messaged me...

1564
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,950
Um... the day...

1565
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,330
Cause like before then I was thinking keeping it...

1566
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,610
Strictly to like...

1567
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,470
Like NA participants...

1568
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,770
Like NA EU participants for WrestleTuber...

1569
00:57:59,290 --> 00:57:59,810
Um...

1570
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,210
But then like we had like you know the last minute editions...

1571
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,470
With Holostars and stuff like that...

1572
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,950
And like also a huge shoutout again to Axel...

1573
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,070
For getting Holostars...

1574
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,250
Um... into the event like...

1575
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,410
Super last minute...

1576
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:13,510
Um... literally...

1577
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,530
Literally like two days before the...

1578
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:18,390
I think two days before the announcement of the event...

1579
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,390
Two or three days before the announcement of the event...

1580
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,270
Axel...

1581
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,970
Uh... got Holostars involved...

1582
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,650
Um... so like there was a lot of things that were happening...

1583
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,610
Last minute...

1584
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,550
But I think like... I don't really...

1585
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,650
I think like...

1586
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,690
Uh...

1587
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,250
I didn't think...

1588
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,750
Uh...

1589
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,250
Um... it was like...

1590
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,110
What's the word?

1591
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:42,290
I don't think that...

1592
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,150
Uh...

1593
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,310
WrestleTuber would be as good as it was...

1594
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,230
Without all of these last minute editions...

1595
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,630
So it all worked out in the end...

1596
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:51,990
Which was fucking insane...

1597
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,850
Because usually when you do stuff last minute...

1598
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,630
It doesn't work out in the end...

1599
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:57,790
So...

1600
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,060
So...

1601
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,340
So like...

1602
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,500
Somehow everything just worked out...

1603
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,780
Like I... like as a one man...

1604
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,360
Army...

1605
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,420
Somehow everything just worked out...

1606
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,060
Um...

1607
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,060
And...

1608
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,820
Oh my gosh...

1609
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,600
Yes like the Jibo and the Taka...

1610
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,360
Guest casting and the guest announcement...

1611
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,700
Oh and cute shout out to Taka...

1612
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,500
For fucking jumping in last minute...

1613
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,860
To do the announcement stuff...

1614
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,380
Because Sayu was like... you know...

1615
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,220
He had like issues on day one...

1616
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,780
With like his own personal schedule...

1617
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,520
Like something unexpectedly came up for day one...

1618
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,480
So Taka coming in clutch...

1619
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,480
And he was like...

1620
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,460
I think like 30 minutes...

1621
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,140
I think like an hour and 30 minutes...

1622
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,300
Before the actual stream was about to start...

1623
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,660
Like huge shout out to him...

1624
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,780
For taking the announcer role there...

1625
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,240
For taking the announcer role there...

1626
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,400
Um...

1627
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,900
Oh yeah...

1628
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,080
I didn't know if like...

1629
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,960
Sayu said anything...

1630
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,820
Regarding why he wasn't there...

1631
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,400
But yes he had a flight cancelled...

1632
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,680
Because I didn't want to say it...

1633
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,000
Because I wasn't sure if he said why he wasn't there...

1634
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,800
Because I didn't know if it was like a personal thing...

1635
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,500
But yes he had a flight cancelled...

1636
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,480
And that's why he couldn't make it for day one...

1637
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,720
So like um...

1638
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,220
It was awesome for Taka...

1639
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,660
For to like do the...

1640
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,500
Do the announcement stuff for us...

1641
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,480
Um I really...

1642
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,100
It was like clutch for everybody...

1643
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,100
Like I said everybody that worked on this...

1644
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,000
It was super clutch...

1645
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,460
And I really appreciate everybody coming together...

1646
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,680
And staying up and working on this...

1647
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,680
Event with me...

1648
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,100
And making all these memorable memories...

1649
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,340
And stuff with everyone...

1650
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,440
Um...

1651
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:39,780
Um...

1652
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,940
But yeah...

1653
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,840
That's really how it all came to be...

1654
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,440
In terms of everything...

1655
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,140
In terms of everything...

1656
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:50,640
Um...

1657
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,880
And like...

1658
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,320
I'm happy...

1659
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,560
I'm really happy...

1660
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,320
That everything just worked out...

1661
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,000
In the end...

1662
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,960
And like I'm happy that Mint reached out...

1663
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,440
Like I said like...

1664
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,180
Uh...

1665
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,560
I said like to people who were like...

1666
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,460
Oh why don't you talk to this person...

1667
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,620
Why don't you talk to that person...

1668
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,660
Like regarding like...

1669
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,640
People I've used to...

1670
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,800
Um might have talked to before...

1671
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,920
Um I'm just letting them do the first step...

1672
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,900
Because like...

1673
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,760
I don't want to intrude on anything...

1674
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,740
And I don't know like where I'm at...

1675
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,100
At certain places...

1676
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:29,880
So that...

1677
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,780
That's why I'm not doing the first step...

1678
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,760
When it comes to these things...

1679
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,260
Um because I don't want to put anybody in like...

1680
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,360
A weird position...

1681
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,880
Uh for anything...

1682
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,620
So like usually I'm just waiting for people to do the first step...

1683
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:44,260
Like I...

1684
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,780
Um if they...

1685
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,120
If they extend their hand...

1686
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,280
To me first...

1687
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,640
Then um...

1688
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,520
Then obviously I'll reciprocate...

1689
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:55,740
Uh...

1690
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,800
Hahaha...

1691
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,500
So yeah...

1692
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,400
That's basically how it is...

1693
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,060
Hahaha...

1694
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:04,960
Hahaha...

1695
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,380
Oh yes...

1696
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,340
Tenjin...

1697
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,320
I'm very excited for the collab tomorrow with Tenjin...

1698
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,880
Um for those who were...

1699
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,240
Uh...

1700
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:15,740
Hahaha...

1701
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,020
I'll tell Tenjin this tomorrow...

1702
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,880
But like...

1703
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,700
For those who were there for the story about Tarkov...

1704
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,020
That was Tenjin...

1705
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:24,840
Hahaha...

1706
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,180
Um...

1707
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:36,700
When I was talking about this fucker that still bought Tarkov after this drama...

1708
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,500
Cause it was on sale...

1709
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,980
That was...

1710
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,660
That was Tenjin...

1711
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,560
Hahaha...

1712
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,100
Cause he was like bro but it's 50% off bro...

1713
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,540
I'm like bro they just literally had a controversy...

1714
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,320
He's like but it was 50% off...

1715
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,780
No it was 80% off...

1716
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,540
No you don't understand...

1717
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,860
It's 80% off...

1718
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:58,480
Hahaha...

1719
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,380
Hahaha...

1720
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,260
Um...

1721
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,760
So...

1722
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,780
Yes he...

1723
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,900
That was him...

1724
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,300
I couldn't say it but now I can...

1725
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,560
That it was Tenjin...

1726
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,120
Bro...

1727
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,520
He called me out on stream...

1728
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,200
Cause like...

1729
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,580
I like sent him a message on...

1730
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,080
I sent him a message on Discord...

1731
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,300
And he was like...

1732
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,420

1733
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,080

01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,620
He was like you fuck...

1736
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,300
He was like you fucking...

1737
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,980
Cause I was lurking...

1738
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,880
I didn't want to derail his stream...

1739
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,700
I was literally lurking on his stream...

1740
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,600
And then he fucking called me out...

1741
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,240
Hahaha...

1742
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,000
Hahaha...

1743
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:48,600
Um...

1744
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,420
Um...

1745
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,540
But yes...

1746
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,580
I'm super excited for tomorrow...

1747
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,360
With the Apex collab...

1748
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,400
Uh...

1749
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,820
With Tenjin...

1750
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,400
He was actually supposed to be in my Nokia...

1751
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,520
Invitational hide and seek...

1752
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,000
But because like...

1753
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,280
It was so last minute...

1754
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,340
Cause I...

1755
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,780
We had some issues with teammates...

1756
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,720
Regarding the hide and seek stuff...

1757
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,920
So like I had...

1758
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,340
Four times I had to find substitute teammates...

1759
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:18,620
Hahaha...

1760
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,980
And...

1761
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,800
Tenjin was originally...

1762
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,220
Well it's not the original...

1763
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,080
But he was one of the first substitutes...

1764
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,700
He was the first substitute...

1765
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,260
Um...

1766
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,060
But like...

1767
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,540
Because of like scheduling wise...

1768
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,320
We had like issues with scheduling wise...

1769
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,520
For like the OG teammates...

1770
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,340
Um...

1771
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:38,900
And...

1772
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,320
Tenjin was the original...

1773
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,200
But then because he lives in...

1774
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,380
He lives in like Indonesia...

1775
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,440
Uh...

1776
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,960
I was like...

1777
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,600
I was like...

1778
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,580
Hey my team...

1779
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,600
This is my first choice sub...

1780
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,000
Can you like send these things to Indonesia?

1781
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:01,960
And they were like...

1782
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:02,600
No...

1783
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,860
Because customs...

1784
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,440
Hahaha...

1785
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,740
We don't know what the customs gonna be like...

1786
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,140
We don't know if we get lucky with the customs...

1787
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,220
Hahaha...

1788
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,480
So he couldn't be...

1789
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,800
He couldn't be a teammate...

1790
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:20,700
Hahaha...

1791
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,200
Hahaha...

1792
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,480
We didn't even know that the stuff wouldn't be there in time.

1793
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,580
Did you guys know Nokia is really fucking good with like...

1794
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,760
Wi-Fi stuff infrastructure?

1795
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:34,000
Like that's the whole point of this Apex Invitational.

1796
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,680
It's the test out there...

1797
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,500
Like Wi-Fi.

1798
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,960
Like their new Wi-Fi thing.

1799
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:43,160
Because apparently Nokia is now instead of phones, they do like Wi-Fi infrastructure.

1800
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,040
Yeah!

1801
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,880
They...

1802
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,060
They like apparently like...

1803
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,580
Known for like Wi-Fi stuff now.

1804
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:50,260
Hahaha...

1805
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,200
I did not know that.

1806
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,160
Um... so they're sending us... yeah, they're sending us like the... like I have one.

1807
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,440
Like I haven't set it up yet.

1808
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,540
Uh, we're supposed to learn how to set it up.

1809
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,580
Okay, Apex over Wi... Yes!

1810
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,980
Okay, I found out when I got invited.

1811
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:15,220
Like... like... guys, I knew when I got invited because I had to research what... why we're receiving like Wi-Fi stuff.

1812
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:16,640
Um...

1813
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,160
But... but yes, anyway.

1814
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,820
Um... they have to send out this pack.

1815
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,940
This like care package which included the Wi-Fi tower... the Wi-Fi kit or whatever.

1816
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,380
Um... and... uh... really?

1817
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,720
So it is an app... Bro, it literally says sponsored by Nokia.

1818
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:44,260
Like... I literally have Nokia on the schedule.

1819
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,620
Damn right, it's sponsored by Nokia.

1820
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,520
Damn right, it's like an advertisement.

1821
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:49,580
Like...

1822
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:57,000
Like the whole tournament is like to advertise their Wi-Fi shit.

1823
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:57,880
Like...

1824
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:03,560
Uh... yeah, he got physically... Tenjin got physically region locked out of the game.

1825
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1826
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Thank you, thank you.

1827
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,060
Uh... Neil.

1828
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:13,960
Um... but yes, uh... so that's why like... uh... Tenjin couldn't be the original substitute.

1829
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,340
And I literally messaged...

1830
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,260
Uh... Fun.

1831
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,480
Um... I literally messaged Fun because I saw like... I know who's like...

1832
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:29,460
Basically almost like all the pro players... not all the pro players but like pro players that are well known are in the hide and seek tournament.

1833
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,560
This like... hide and seek tournament.

1834
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,840
Um... because like...

1835
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:40,500
Jen... I originally messaged Jen as one of the other substitutes but Jen was already taken.

1836
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,740
Jen was like, fuck if you messaged me like an hour earlier I would have been your teammate.

1837
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,440
Uh... Jen Burn by the way.

1838
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:51,620
Um... because I messaged Jen Burn and literally he got swiped an hour before I messaged him.

1839
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,640
So... I couldn't get Jen Burn.

1840
01:07:53,900 --> 01:08:00,980
So then I was looking through like who's in the tournament and it was like the majority of the well known pro players were already like snagged.

1841
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,500
Because so... I was like...

1842
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,200
So I messaged Fun because I didn't see Fun on the list.

1843
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,480
I was like, hey Fun, like do you have...

1844
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,920
Like are you in this tournament and he's like no...

1845
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,780
Like Fun FPS.

1846
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,560
And um... and he's like...

1847
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,060
I was like... yeah...

1848
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,960
He's like, oh no, no, like and I was like, do you want to do it?

1849
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,220
And he's like, oh sure.

1850
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:20,760
Yeah, it's like okay.

1851
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,780
And I was like, can you bring a pro player?

1852
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,800
I didn't want to look anymore.

1853
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,740
I didn't want to fucking look anymore.

1854
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,460
I was tired of looking.

1855
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,260
I was tired of looking for teammates.

1856
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,520
So I was like, do you do you want to bring somebody?

1857
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,560
Like, do you know any pro players that's like not taking it?

1858
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,480
He's like, well, I have my teammate Reptar.

1859
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:53,020
By the way, for those who don't know Reptar, he's been like, he has been multiple Rank 1 in Apex Legends.

1860
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,980
So he's been like, he's been like Rank 1 Apex Predator.

1861
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,480
Yes, I've outsourced.

1862
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,960
Look, my original teammates couldn't do it.

1863
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,780
Tenjin couldn't do it.

1864
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,720
I literally had like one other sub that couldn't do it.

1865
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,180
So I outsourced.

1866
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,300
Okay, I was tired of looking.

1867
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:23,020
I had other things to do like sleeping after WrestleTuber.

1868
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:35,160
So yes, I told I was like, please Fun, do you know anybody?

1869
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,560
And then Fun brought Reptar in.

1870
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:44,780
So I practically have like their entire team, but I'm the new I'm the IGL now.

1871
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,760
I'm the IGL now.

1872
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,600
They're signed to Doki Bird team now.

1873
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,860
It's hide and seek man.

1874
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,700
How bad can it be?

1875
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,140
It's literally hide and seek.

1876
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,320
Like how fucked are they?

1877
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,000
They just need to hide.

1878
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,580
That's all they need to do.

1879
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,040
They know the fucking maps better than me.

1880
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,660
So they're gonna carry me

1881
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,860
Darkblade, thank you the super chat, thank you.

1882
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,420
Thank you.

1883
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:37,300
Sorry mate you mixed me with someone else not the wrong name also you consider Well I mean, like I knew what you guys, like I just knew your icons You should, darkblade You should have brought a paper and printed out your icon and then I would have recognized that you were Dark Blade I didn't hear the last parts,

1884
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,500
are dark but didn't hear the blade parts So I assume you know who they are, okay.

1885
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,240
I think I meant Darkwing.

1886
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,940
Cause like, you know, Darkwing is real.

1887
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,100
In the chat.

1888
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,320
So like, you know, my fucking visuals of you guys is your fucking icons.

1889
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,220
So you should have printed your icon.

1890
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,760
Then I would have not mistaken you.

1891
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,640
Darkwing, come back out!

1892
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,480
Show your presence to everybody so they'll know I'm not crazy.

1893
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,680
We consider it loser bracket next year.

1894
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,240
I know it'll be a longer event, but it'll be fun.

1895
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,420
Like I said, I talked about this earlier.

1896
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,920
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1897
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,200
Thank you.

1898
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:21,040
But like I said, the reason why I don't know if I want to do a loser bracket is because it would take a really long time.

1899
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,960
Especially if we do a loser bracket, we have to cut down on participants.

1900
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,740
So like, there's no reason...

1901
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,180
Not no reason, but that was the reason why I didn't really want to do...

1902
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,060
I was thinking about it for next year.

1903
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,160
But like...

1904
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,120
And I was like worried.

1905
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,220
That...

1906
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,940
Worried that like...

1907
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:48,660
Having a loser bracket will mean we have to have less participants joining in.

1908
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,220
Because it'll be way too long.

1909
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:54,980
Now I'm thinking of the super chat.

1910
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,220
Thank you.

1911
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:55,520
Thank you.

1912
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,380
Off topic, but have you decided whether you're going to go to EVO?

1913
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,060
Thinking of the super chat.

1914
01:11:59,120 --> 01:11:59,400
Thank you.

1915
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,020
Thank you.

1916
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,360
It's a secret.

1917
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,740
Kaz, thinking of the super chat.

1918
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:07,120
Thank you.

1919
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:07,620
Thank you.

1920
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,220
You'll know after EVO.

1921
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:09,720
After EVO is over.

1922
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,160
If I was there or not.

1923
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,820
Because then if after EVO is over maybe there'll be a stream...

1924
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,140
Maybe there's going to be a waiting room.

1925
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,340
That'll be like, whoa, my story is from EVO.

1926
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:26,160
But if there's no waiting room after EVO, then you know I wasn't there.

1927
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,160
Or I could have a waiting room for it.

1928
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,720
And then I just make up stories.

1929
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,020
Oh, I should just do that.

1930
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,200
Or maybe I'll just make up stories.

1931
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,220
You'll never know!

1932
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,040
You'll never know if it's true or not!

1933
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,660
The misdirect... It's not paywad because it'll be a stream!

1934
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1935
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:50,740
Thank you.

1936
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,320
Thank you.

1937
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,660
I'm not the same person I was two icons ago.

1938
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1939
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,460
Thank you.

1940
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,040
Thank you.

1941
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:02,820
I know I wrote down some... How is it gatekeeping?

1942
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,020
Streams are free!

1943
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,720
I'm sorry, my gatekeeping is while you're internet?

1944
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,660
How the fuck is that gatekeeping if it's fucking free?

1945
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,660
Alright, let me... I wrote down stuff.

1946
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,160
Is there anything else that I...

1947
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,320
That I missed out on?

1948
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,140
Let's see.

1949
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,800
No, I think that's really everything I want to talk about.

1950
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,060
For WrestleTuber.

1951
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,920
And like Anime North and everything.

1952
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:33,820
Oh yes!

1953
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,640
Merch!

1954
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,000
Merch is free!

1955
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:35,160
Merch stuff.

1956
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:35,560
Okay.

1957
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,960
Like we can get a lot of emails.

1958
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,200
I talked about this in the member stream.

1959
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,700
I'm gonna make an official post on Twitter soon.

1960
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,180
Um... Official post on Twitter soon.

1961
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,180
But regarding merch stuff, like the debut merch stuff.

1962
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,380
And the Lunar New Year.

1963
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,320
We finally have a distributor.

1964
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,220
We finally got a distributor.

1965
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,020
But!

1966
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,740
The distributor is coming over to pick up the stock.

1967
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,600
Like next week.

1968
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,460
And by then...

1969
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,360
Um...

1970
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,620
Shipment of stuff...

1971
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,400
Would start, I believe, middle of next month?

1972
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,540
Middle of June.

1973
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,720
I know we're a little bit like delayed regarding shipment and merch stuff.

1974
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,500
But now that we have a distributor finally...

1975
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,360
Um...

1976
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,100
I think maybe this time like...

1977
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,500
Like, you know, shipping for stuff would be a lot better now.

1978
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,260
So there won't be like future delays.

1979
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:28,940
I hope.

1980
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,020
So I hope by now, like now that we have finally settled on a distributor...

1981
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:33,820
Um...

1982
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:38,340
Things will not be delayed as much for future merch release.

1983
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,420
I'm still not releasing any new merch yet.

1984
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,780
Only because I am waiting...

1985
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,140
Like I said, I'm not gonna release any new merch...

1986
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,160
Until like the distrib...

1987
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,180
Shipment of old merch is situated.

1988
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,320
That's why nothing has been released.

1989
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,600
No new products have been released.

1990
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,380
I do have like new product plans and stuff.

1991
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,920
But like I haven't put it out just cause I don't wanna...

1992
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,760
You know...

1993
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,460
Prom...

1994
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,460
Like I don't wanna have like so much stuff promised.

1995
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,540
And then like just...

1996
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,360
You know, I don't want you guys to like wait for like 500 orders that never like...

1997
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:14,800
Uh...

1998
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:15,820
Arrived.

1999
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:18,720
Um...

2000
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,140
That's why.

2001
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,920
Like I don't care.

2002
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,060
Like I talked about this before.

2003
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,620
But like if I had like, you know, merch releases every month or so...

2004
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:28,900
That would have been like 60 to 70% of my income.

2005
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,600
Like legitimately...

2006
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,460
I would make so much more money off of merch release...

2007
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,720
Versus like...

2008
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,660
Streaming.

2009
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:42,260
If I had consistent merch release.

2010
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,040
But like I'd rather have everything fucking figured out.

2011
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,320
And have all the stuff situated when it comes to...

2012
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,820
When it comes to...

2013
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,960
Like you know, making sure everybody's getting their stuff.

2014
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:00,520
And everybody is getting their shipping.

2015
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,600
And everything.

2016
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,900
Before I fucking release anything.

2017
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:05,880

2115
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,620

2116
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,220

01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,020
Tiny and bad quality.

2121

Alright this is super tiny.

2122
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,440
Cause I don't...

2123
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,160
I don't have it water marked.

2124
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,320
There we go.

2125
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,560

2126
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,120
You can't steal this now!

2127
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,660
Cause I don't have it water marked cause I'm fucking lazy.

2128
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,060
Maybe I should make it tiny.

2129
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,940
Yeah you can't steal this.

2130
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,920
It's too late.

2131
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,000
So this is the postcard and the...

2132
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,080
Uh...

2133
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,340
Yeah but you can't do anything with it!

2134
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,520
Cause it's so tiny!

2135
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,040
Right clicking it.

2136
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,520
No!

2137
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,400
You can't right click it if I fucking move it around!

2138
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,180
You can't right click this!

2139
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,040
Okay.

2140
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,180
Anyway...

2141
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,140
Um...

2142
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,200
Anyway this is the postcard and the snapshot.

2143
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,200
So...

2144
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:26,740
So...

2145
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,380
Okay I'll make it a little bit bigger.

2146
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,060
What the...

2147
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:31,860
Pause!

2148
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:33,960
Um...

2149
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,150
But this is...

2150
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,300
Um...

2151
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:37,940
Um...

2152
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,180
This is the...

2153
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:44,480
Basically what the postcard slash snapshot looks like.

2154
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,240
Well the snapshot would be like a more zoom in version of this.

2155
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,140
Um...

2156
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:53,240
But the people who bought the limited edition bundle with the postcard.

2157
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,400
That's what it looks like.

2158
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,500
And also like the snapshot in the debut bundle.

2159
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,780
Like it's gonna be like you know cropped into like a little snapshot thing.

2160
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,980
Like you know this is like...

2161
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,500
This is gonna be zoomed in a bit more.

2162
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,380
And it looks like a photo and stuff like that.

2163
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,300
So that's what it looks like.

2164
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:07,820
Uh...

2165
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,840
That's drawn by Poki!

2166
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,380
One of my good artist friends.

2167
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,460
Um...

2168
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,040
Poki is the...

2169
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:13,740
Uh...

2170
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:15,080
Next time I'll have a watermark.

2171
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:15,440
Okay?

2172
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,420
I was really lazy.

2173
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:16,960
So...

2174
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,940
I didn't...

2175
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:18,640
I was...

2176
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,120
Next time it'll be watermarked!

2177
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,300
So do not steal!

2178
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,300
Uh...

2179
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,020
I will have a copyright in wa...

2180
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,640
Well not a copyright cause then I'd be lying.

2181
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,680
Cause I don't...

2182
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,100
I don't have a copyright on it.

2183
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:32,800
So...

2184
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:32,980
I don't have a copyright on it.

2185
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,100
I'd be lying if I put like...

2186
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:35,260
Cop...

2187
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:36,500
Like a copy...

2188
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,900
Like Doki Bird copyrighted or something.

2189
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,380
But next time!

2190
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:44,800
Next time!

2191
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,320
It'll be different!

2192
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,700
Next time I'll have it watermarked!

2193
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,180
So you can't steal it!

2194
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,080
Woo!

2195
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,960
That's future Doki's problem!

2196
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,640
Not current Doki problem!

2197
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,180
Um...

2198
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,020
But yes.

2199
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:03,920
Uh...

2200
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,800
I think that is everything I wanted to update you guys about life.

2201
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,260
I'm sorry this wasn't a longer stream.

2202
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:12,880
Um...

2203
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,980
I'm very tired.

2204
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:15,880
But...

2205
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,680
I hope you guys enjoyed this little life update that we have today.

2206
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,040
And...

2207
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:22,680
Uh...

2208
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,740
And it was a great time talking to you guys.

2209
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:27,160
I had a great time hanging out with all you guys.

2210
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:27,900
And just...

2211
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,600
Let...

2212
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,640
Give you guys like...

2213
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,240
Just like...

2214
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:30,600
You know...

2215
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:35,980
An insight into what the fuck was going on in Doki's brain when it comes to WrestleTuber.

2216
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:36,860
And...

2217
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,140
Oh my god it was so much work.

2218
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,340
It was so...

2219
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,540
It was so...

2220
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,200
It was so much.

2221
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,120
I...

2222
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:44,900
Like...

2223
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,600
Like you know the Discord, the info...

2224
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,560
It was just me typing like thousands of words.

2225
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:53,080
Like trying to make sure everything was organized and everything.

2226
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,020
And making sure like everything was okay.

2227
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,700
And guiding...

2228
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:58,040
Like I...

2229
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,220
After every day I had like a schedule for like a week.

2230
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,080
Like I had a schedule for the casters.

2231
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,940
Like each day I had a schedule for the casters and the wrestlers.

2232
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:05,620
To be like...

2233
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,520
Okay you guys show up.

2234
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,560
Wrestlers you have to show up at this time.

2235
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:09,280
Um...

2236
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,180
You have to show up this time.

2237
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,600
And bracket two you show up this time.

2238
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,180
Bracket three you show up...

2239
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,040
This will be the estimated time to show up.

2240
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:16,700
Casters!

2241
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,980
We are rotating casters and this is how the castering rotation will be going.

2242
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,000
Like these two casters will be here.

2243
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,080
These two casters will be casting these matches.

2244
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,560
These casters will be casting these matches.

2245
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,840
And then it was like we...

2246
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,200
I had to like figure out the plan.

2247
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:30,780
And everything.

2248
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,260
And oh my god.

2249
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:33,060
It was...

2250
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:33,720
I...

2251
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,320
The one thing I forgot to do was show the gamer subcodes for everybody.

2252
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,880
For all...

2253
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
Like some of the participants.

2254
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:39,520
Because I was like...

2255
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,520
Oh you guys have a gamer subcode.

2256
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,280
Because I didn't want to be like...

2257
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,020
Use my...

2258
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:42,960
Only my code.

2259
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,520
You know?

2260
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,440
Or gamer subs.

2261
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,240
Like I know gamer subs sponsored it.

2262
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,680
But like you know we had some wrestlers there that also had gamer subcodes.

2263
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,020
So I was like you guys show me your gamer subcodes.

2264
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,460
And then like I'll show it too.

2265
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,100
I was like...

2266
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,180
Oh I'm gonna put it so other people can use your codes.

2267
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,100
Um...

2268
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,600
And um...

2269
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,840
I didn't want to like you know just be like...

2270
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,780
Oh just use my code.

2271
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,000
Because like you know they gave up their time and everything.

2272
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,340
And I forgot to put it on stream.

2273
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,460
That's why I tweeted it out.

2274
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,080
Because I...

2275
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,700
I forgot to...

2276
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,100
I forgot to put it on stream.

2277
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,400
So...

2278
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,940
So yeah I was like whoops.

2279
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:21,960
But like...

2280
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,280
Because I really appreciate them giving up their time you know.

2281
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,620
Their time to do all of this.

2282
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,660
And their time to um...

2283
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,140
Um...

2284
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,160
Their time to uh...

2285
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,940
To participate in WrestleTuber.

2286
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,540
Because it is a big commitment.

2287
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,400
And like for those who are part of the tournament.

2288
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,140
You wouldn't know like...

2289
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,020
You wouldn't know like you know like when they had to leave.

2290
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,000
So they have to make their entire schedule open.

2291
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,560
You have to make your entire day open.

2292
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,540
Because you don't know when you're supposed to leave.

2293
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,260
Like when you're done.

2294
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,940
Because like you know those who are part of the tournament.

2295
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,340
They don't know if they're gonna make it to day two.

2296
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:02,660
So they have to make sure their entire schedule for day two was uh...

2297
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,700
Was opened you know.

2298
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,760
So there was that.

2299
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,480
And like a huge shout out to everybody for participating.

2300
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,180
And for um...

2301
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,060
Just like leaving their schedule that open.

2302
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,140
I just remember something I forgot to say about the Yuusan thing.

2303
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,240
So like yeah.

2304
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,780
Yuusan like messaged when we announced it.

2305
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,380
Because I didn't tell anybody what the announcement was.

2306
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,260
And those that were invited.

2307
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,360
So like Yuusan found out about WrestleTuber the moment I announced it.

2308
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,860
And then they sent me a message in support too.

2309
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,260
And they're like oh my gosh like...

2310
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,980
Uh Doki like I'm so proud of you for organizing this.

2311
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,120
And then I was like you know what Yuusan.

2312
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,140
You have to be there.

2313
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,340
You have to be a surprise guest Yuusan.

2314
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:34,980
Like...

2315
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,800
You have to be a surprise guest.

2316
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,760
And like to be like the...

2317
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,360
The fucking coming in with the steel chair.

2318
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,160
The classic WWE twist.

2319
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,320
Um because Yuusan at first was like...

2320
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:50,780
Didn't...

2321
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,240
Was like not didn't want to do it.

2322
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:56,320
But like they were worried that they would fuck it up type deal.

2323
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,320
They were worried that they wouldn't be able to...

2324
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,040
Um do it in a way that people would like...

2325
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,000
Would like enjoy it.

2326
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,180
From about...

2327
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,240
I was like no it'll be so good Yuusan.

2328
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:07,660
It'll be so funny.

2329
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,180
Because it's such a classic WWE twist.

2330
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,300
Um yeah.

2331
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,780
Yuusan was my Batista.

2332
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:13,740
So I...

2333
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:15,720
Batista.

2334
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,000
So I was just like no you have to do it.

2335
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,380
It'll be so fucking funny Yuusan.

2336
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,740
Like trust me people are gonna love it.

2337
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,440
And then Yuusan like showed me like...

2338
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,140
Oh I could use like this person.

2339
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:26,860
And like have a video.

2340
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,200
And have this rigged and everything.

2341
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,600
I was like oh my god perfect.

2342
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,780
And they were like the one...

2343
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:36,680
You see I was supposed to only have one surprise guest.

2344
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:38,460
And it was just gonna be Yuusan.

2345
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,700
And then obviously like the last minute stuff came up.

2346
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,900
So we had three surprise guests.

2347
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,800
So like huge shout out to Yuusan for...

2348
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,520
For doing all of that.

2349
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:55,960
For the...

2350
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,140
For the finals.

2351
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,900
And they...

2352
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:58,560
That they...

2353
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,780
You know they fucking did...

2354
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:00,400
It was perfect.

2355
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,100
It was...

2356
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:09,540
Like Yuusan was not supposed to kick Benno's ass that fast.

2357
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,520
Cause like...

2358
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,800
Literally I told the person who made the You Man model.

2359
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:15,020
To like...

2360
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,160
It had to be the same as everybody else.

2361
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,400
So like...

2362
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,180
Benno could have won that.

2363
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,620
Because the stats were the same.

2364
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,080
And...

2365
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,940
I don't know how the fuck he got destroyed so fast.

2366
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,040
And like literally died.

2367
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,060
I don't know how he fucking just died.

2368
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,540
Like outside the ring.

2369
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:44,420
People were like...

2370
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,760
It was a count out.

2371
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:50,860
He's not supposed to lose his championship belt.

2372
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,820
They were gonna...

2373
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,700
Like he was gonna keep his belt anyway guys.

2374
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,980
But for the sake of the storyline.

2375
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:58,000
We like...

2376
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,800
Joked that he lost his belt.

2377
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:00,620
Like...

2378
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:01,580
He did lose the...

2379
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:02,780
The title.

2380
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,100
Like...

2381
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:07,900
He's still a loser.

2382
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,720
Because he lost to Yuusan.

2383
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,680
So...

2384
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,500
Like you can't be like...

2385
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,620
He's not a winner.

2386
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,420
Because he still fucking died.

2387
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,480
Like...

2388
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,560
He still...

2389
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,900
He still...

2390
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,320
He still fucking died.

2391
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,340
You can't call him a winner.

2392
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,300
If he just dies.

2393
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,180
Like...

2394
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,260
But anyway...

2395
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,180
Anyway...

2396
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,820
I like how someone was like...

2397
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,600
He's always been my loser.

2398
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,300
Quote affectionate.

2399
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,400
But...

2400
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,480
But he gets a...

2401
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,420
He still gets a belt.

2402
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:43,860
He...

2403
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,640
He still gets a belt guys.

2404
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:49,540
Oh...

2405
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:52,760
Anyway...

2406
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,620
That was great.

2407
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,440
You can't be a winner if you're dead.

2408
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:58,460
Exactly.

2409
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,520
He's looking like in the hospital right now.

2410
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,300
Fucking...

2411
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,640
We're waiting for him to wake up from his coma.

2412
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:12,100
We're just waiting for him to wake up from the coma guys.

2413
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:13,100
Like...

2414
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,680
Thoughts and prayers for him at the hospital.

2415
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,400
Um...

2416
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,060
Um...

2417
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,360
I was so angry.

2418
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,320
But glad that he got the belt.

2419
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,120
Like...

2420
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,180
Yeah...

2421
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:24,460
Like...

2422
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,020
It was so like...

2423
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,980
It was so like all fun and games.

2424
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,440
Like...

2425
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,220
He is the...

2426
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:29,600
He...

2427
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,440
We can say that he is like...

2428
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,280
The...

2429
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:33,800
The...

2430
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:34,720
The...

2431
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:35,600
Tournament...

2432
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,320
Tournament winner.

2433
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,420
But not the WrestleTuber winner.

2434
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:42,620
I feel like that's the best way to describe it.

2435
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:43,920
He won the tournament.

2436
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:45,940
But Yuusong was the...

2437
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:47,240
The event boss.

2438
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,380
The final boss.

2439
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,500
So he wasn't the...

2440
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,300
The WrestleTuber champion.

2441
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,120
He was the tournament champion.

2442
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,080
But not the WrestleTuber champion.

2443
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,500
Yeah.

2444
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,340
When you win the battle.

2445
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,580
But lost the war.

2446
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,520
The secret final boss.

2447
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:06,300
Yeah.

2448
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,240
The people's champ.

2449
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:08,920
He was the people's champ.

2450
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,400
Um...

2451
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,240
Anyway.

2452
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,100
Adam.

2453
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,260
You met his WrestleTuber guy.

2454
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,480
Um...

2455
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,580
Anyway.

2456
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,500
That was...

2457
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:22,940
It was great.

2458
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:23,860
Uh...

2459
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,360
I had a great time.

2460
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:27,780
Um...

2461
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,280
With everything that happened.

2462
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,920
Next week will definitely be a chill week for me.

2463
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,680
I'm gonna relax and...

2464
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,820
Uh...

2465
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,320
I'm gonna relax next week.

2466
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,480
But this week is still...

2467
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,680
It's still working time.

2468
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,420
It's still Doki Bird workout.

2469
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,560
Um...

2470
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,820
Thank you for all the super chat everybody.

2471
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,040
I really...

2472
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,740
I really appreciate it guys.

2473
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:57,620
Also, I actually had like people in the comments being like the game glitched.

2474
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,460
Billion was supposed to win that.

2475
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:06,600
But like what happened was that apparently Beto made his wrestler incredibly dishonest.

2476
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,940
So like he would purposely rig the matches.

2477
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:15,340
And apparently so when you saw we saw him like took those like things down on the ring.

2478
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:16,580
Um...

2479
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,640
The reason why the referee wasn't there.

2480
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,320
Was because like the game didn't glitch.

2481
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:24,500
The referee turned his back to fix the ring.

2482
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,460
And because he turned his back to fix the ring.

2483
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:31,640
That was the exact moment that Billion pinned Beto.

2484
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,580
So Beto got a free...

2485
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,600
Freebie there.

2486
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,580
That was actually...

2487
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,400
Beto's AI wrestler was fucking insane.

2488
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,500
Like I don't know.

2489
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:41,940
Like I feel like...

2490
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:44,720
Like I felt like the Beto AI was self-aware.

2491
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,540
There's no...

2492
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:47,980
Like...

2493
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,620
Like...

2494
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:49,620
I'm...

2495
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:53,320
I felt like the Beto AI evolved to be self-aware.

2496
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,020
To the point where that's why he fucking died.

2497
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,720
He gained...

2498
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,500
He gained sentience.

2499
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,680
Cause like...

2500
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,820
Like he was...

2501
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:06,720
He did okay.

2502
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,720
For the entire tournament.

2503
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,360
And then...

2504
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,360
And like he did Beto things.

2505
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,340
And then like he continued to do Beto things when he fucking died.

2506
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:16,540
Like...

2507
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,240
Like...

2508
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,520
And he ended up losing the cup.

2509
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:20,640
So...

2510
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,760
So...

2511
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,180
It was actually crazy.

2512
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:23,780
I...

2513
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:27,900
I don't know how the fuck that fucking AI become...

2514
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,760
Become...

2515
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,880
Beto 3.0...

2516
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,100
Basically...

2517
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:35,540
So...

2518
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:39,580
The AI was literally just Beto.

2519
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,540
Perfectly accurate Beto.

2520
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:42,600
Yeah...

2521
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,440
It was actually insane how...

2522
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,700
How well the AI perfectly...

2523
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:47,220
Reply...

2524
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,120
I'm gonna call it here guys.

2525
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,380
Thank you everybody for the super chats.

2526
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:00,820
Thank you all for like hanging out with me today and chilling with me.

2527
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,740
Guys, I really appreciate it.

2528
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,260
I'm tired.

2529
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,020
So I'm gonna take another nap.

2530
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:13,460
But it was great talking to you guys and just giving you guys insight about like what was going on with like everything.

2531
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,880
Like you know how the rest of the tube area was done and all that stuff.

2532
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:26,120
Again, like a huge shout out to everybody that participated, to the staff, to the staff that was there and everything.

2533
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:29,620
I really appreciate all the people that were there for long hours.

2534
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,780
Doing like the announcement, like announcing, casting.

2535
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:38,020
Just you know, fucking improv-ing a lot of stuff.

2536
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,560
Huge shout out to the guest casters too.

2537
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,480
We actually got a real WWE, like an ex-WWE person doing one of the guest casting.

2538
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,360
If you guys didn't know.

2539
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:51,640
We got Mace from WWE guest casting for us.

2540
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,980
And maybe, I hope in WrestleTube 2025.

2541
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:58,460
I hope we can get another WWE person on the show.

2542
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,620
I feel like that would be so cool.

2543
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,760
And honestly, they need the ring.

2544
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:02,880
I mean, they need the ratings.

2545
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,840
Okay, that's fucked up for me to say.

2546
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,000
Anyway...

2547
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:17,200
Wow!

2548
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,800
The Slant!

2549
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:26,500
If they target the Weebs, they'll get more people watching!

2550
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,080
They got to expand their fucking network, guys!

2551
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:31,980
The Slant!

2552
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:33,800
You know the ratings are falling, guys.

2553
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,760
You fucking know.

2554
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,520
You don't fucking lie to me.

2555
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:42,000
I saw people shit-talking about how the ratings are falling.

2556
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,720
So I'm just saying, WWE.

So you want to reach out and like, you know, I don't know, sponsor or send somebody over for next year?

2559
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,440
Bro, this new target demographic.

2560
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,940
You haven't targeted the Weebs yet, guys.

2561
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:04,280
You haven't targeted the VTuber fans.

2562
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,960
Just think!

2563
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,000
You can convert a whole new audience!

2564
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,240
No, stop!

2565
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,960
Doki is at an all-time high!

2566
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,960
All I'm saying...

2567
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,400
All I'm saying...

2568
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,020
Anyway, guys...

2569
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:28,940
Uh...

2570
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,160
Uh...

2571
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,000
I had a great time, everybody.

2572
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,980
As always, everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around.

2573
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,320
To get that blood flowing.

2574
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,360
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2575
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,900
Because you deserve it!

2576
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,140
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2577
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,640
Bye, guys!

2578
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:45,800
Bye!
