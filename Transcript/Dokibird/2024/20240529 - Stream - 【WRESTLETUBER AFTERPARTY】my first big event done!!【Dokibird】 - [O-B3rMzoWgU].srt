Cosmic but thank you um I think it was a success I think

30
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,260
WrestleTuber was uh was a huge success Well, I don't know if
I should say huge success, but I think WrestleTuber did do,

31
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,200
um, did like, uh, oh my gosh, my, sorry, my brain is like
processing words.

32
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,400
I can't words right now.

33
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,220
But I think like WrestleTuber did go as how I wanted and
beyond that because it feels like I think you guys all

34
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,000
enjoyed it.

35
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,560
I think you guys, all, every single one of you guys enjoyed,
uh, WrestleTuber and like all the nice surprises and

36
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,260
everything.

37
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:17,180
Um, and it just, it felt like, and then I'm having like so
many different storylines uh so many different storylines

38
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:27,280
being played out and all the and you do know all of it was
like ai right like everything was controlled by ai like the

39
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:43,520
the wrestlers but holy shit i don't know how but like i
don't know how we were so lucky with the ai like went in the

40
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:53,180
end because some of you guys were like oh joki you purposely
made usans wrestler overpowered as hell so like betto was

41
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:04,080
gonna lose no matter what no actually i wasn't i i it was
the same i told them to make it the same stat i was like it

42
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:14,480
has to be the same as everybody else so i have no idea how
the fuck betto got smacked so hard that he died outside of

43
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:31,560
the ring like it's so fucking fast like that surprised me so
much because i was definitely not expecting to the point

44
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:40,840
where he literally i'm like i think his ai actually died for
like he stopped moving and then i was like there's no way

45
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,520
No, hey, get up, pedo.

46
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
Get the fuck up.

47
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:55,190
That was fucking crazy.

48
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,590
I couldn't believe that happened.

49
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,850
It was like, it was so perfect.

50
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,250
The pedo was tired.

51
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,150
It was a pedo's turn to be eepy.

52
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,090
Hmm.

53
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,990
But yeah, both Yuson and Betta are getting belts sent over.

54
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,110
It was originally planned.

55
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,110
Because people were like, no, Betta lost his belt.

56
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,350
It's not fair.

57
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,490
But Wesley's not fair, baby.

58
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,230
Welcome to WWE.

59
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,700
Flynn was never fair.

60
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,160
Well, listen, people were saying, like, oh my god, it gave,
like, John Cena versus...

61
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
What's his name?

62
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,400
The guy that plays Drax and Guardians of the Galaxy.

63
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:58,040
Batista, oh my god, I'm gonna fucking butcher his name,
Guardians and Guardians of the Cow, Batista, yeah, yeah,

64
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:06,940
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Batista, you were saying, no, it's
just like the John Cena versus Batista match all over again,

65
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:18,920
and like, true, no, I'll show you guys the clip, it's
literally basically what happened, um, with what I did to,

66
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:32,280
what I did to the battle is basically uh what happened in
wwe it was almost the same fitting um i'm basically the ceo

67
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:43,240
of wrestle tuber but like the one that the the type of ceo
that doesn't get arrested not like i would not like to be

68
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:53,860
compared to the ceo to the ex ceo of wwe because he got
arrested for things I am not that type.

69
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,500
Too soon.

70
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Bro, that happened in January.

71
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,020
That was like fucking sick.

72
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Almost six months ago, guys.

73
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,140
Like, it's not too soon.

74
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
Nam, thank you for the super chat.

75
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,680
Thank you.

76
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,200
Thank you.

77
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,320
The best part for me alongside seeing the Fable, Doki, and
Mint collab was being introduced to so many new people.

78
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I went from not knowing Nana to joining her membership.

79
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,840
just one example.

80
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,640
Thank you, the Super Chat.

81
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,580
Thank you, thank you.

82
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,800
Yeah, I think that is why I really wanted to do these types
of events, because like, this is what, like, we're missing

83
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,720
in the, um, in the NA, like, uh, and not just NA, but I
would say, like, because, you know, so we had, like,

84
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,700
Europeans joining, uh, WrestleTuber, and, uh, also not just
Europeans, but also people from Asia joining, uh, people

85
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,140
from Asia joining WrestleTuber.

86
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,360
But, like, I feel like this is what were missing in the
English side in the like Western VTuber scene with like

87
00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:01,540
events that unite like different air different companies
different fan bases in these corporate um sorry I choked on

88
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:08,020
water a little earlier so I but muted so you guys didn't
know but in these corporate and everything just like smaller

89
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,760
smaller channels and big channels working together in like a
very fun event and I felt like that was something we were

90
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,600
missing we were missing that in the western side of e-tubing
and this was something i've always wanted to do it has

91
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,640
always been on my roadmap to have something that was open to
like uh different companies and i was really happy to be

92
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:39,870
able to do it and i was really happy i was able to plan
something like this um and being able to invite so many

93
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:49,810
people joining in as well um i reached out to a lot of
people sending invites out um and i i didn't really uh and i

94
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,750
wanted like you know different like even though there might
be small vtubers i also wanted them to have a chance uh

95
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:03,690
especially with like x prism um i was happy to invite them
over i think i think like x prism was like the first the

96
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:11,910
first group of people i invited to wrestle tuber they were
the first invites i sent out i'm pretty sure um and from

97
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,350
there i sent out invites to all the other companies and also
the Indies as well.

98
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,430
Lita, thank you for the Aka Aka Supa.

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:20,870

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,650

Next week, I'm definitely gonna let's chill next week.

108
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,850
Most likely, I will have, like, a rest week for next week.

109
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:47,450
So it was because this week I couldn't really chill yet, uh,
because I did have, like, prior obligations that I had to

110
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,490
do, uh, especially with the Rust stuff, um, because the Rust
thing is ending on the 31st, and I felt bad because, you

111
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,950
know, they invited me, it's a huge Rust streaming server,
like, a lot of the big names are part of it, and I got,

112
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:06,330
like, the, like, the invite to join, um, and, like, you
know, there's not a lot of YouTubers in there, too, so I

113
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:12,210
thought I was like, oh, this is such a rare invite to join
the server so I was like oh fuck I should do at least one

like there might be surprise guests But like they didn't
know until the day of the event started Like, USON got

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,230
invited to the server on Sunday.

135
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,170

Like, I kept all the guest appearances a secret until the
day of...

142
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,270
So, like, if it was leaked, then I would know who leaked it.

143
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:09,730
I will know exactly who leaked it because I told a very
limited amount of people yes Beto too joined the server like

00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,930
secret um so I A huge shout out to Beto for letting me

person.

147
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,350
Like, are you okay?

148
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,290
Like, do you want to play?

149
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,670
I was like, are you okay with inviting your twin over?

150
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,210
And he was like, so, you know, she was like, yo, that's me
so funny.

151
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,370
Like, yeah, let's do it.

152
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,830
I was like, don't worry about making a Beto T by WDE 2K24
because I know it's very expensive.

153
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:46,650
Don't worry.

154
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,310
I'll get somebody to make him.

155
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,370
So, yeah.

156
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,990
videos the videos like the surprise appearances with mint
and matara those were done like the day of like the day they

157
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:08,530
were gonna appear they they the the videos were shown that
my video editor showed to my video editor they like made it

158
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:17,070
the day of um the day of the of their appearance too because
i had the idea and i was like can you can you make it and

159
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:25,630
they're like oh yeah they're like are you sure and they're
like yeah yeah yeah we can make it we can we can do it So a

160
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,610
huge, huge shout out to my team.

161
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:36,210
By the way, for those who don't know, this whole event was
practically almost solely ran by me, including me running

162
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,670
the OBS and everything.

163
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,890
Because I wanted to see if I could do it.

164
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:48,870
And then I also wanted to see, like, okay, like, how should
this be ran?

165
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,510
Like, how should this be done in a way?

166
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,630
So, like, I think, like, next year, when I do WrestleTuber
2025, again, I'm definitely going to give it to another

167
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,270
person to run the OPS so that it's less scuffed.

168
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:08,310
But now that I know how it should go, at least I can direct
it better.

169
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,070
I can direct it better.

170
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,210
I can direct it in a better way in terms of, oh, okay, I've
done this before.

171
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:22,750
Then I know how this should go, how to do the scenes and
everything, how to do the swaps, especially when I'm running

172
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:30,350
new programs and stuff where, like, um with like guest
caster and everything so like i was just figuring stuff out

173
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:37,550
on how the whole stream was gonna be like so like now that i
know how to do it myself then like me telling someone else

174
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:44,270
to do it and like controlling it i feel like um it'll be
definitely easier because i have the better like i know how

175
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:53,330
it's how it can be done so um so like you know instead of
like you know putting images on live like like like you're

176
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:00,530
like who's next and then there's like a fucking giant
picture that's like over like that's like uh leaking out to

177
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:10,470
other scenes and then have to like resize it live that's not
gonna happen anymore right for next year for next year it's

178
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:21,530
not we won't be resizing images live and everything so so
least like i have a better vision on how things are gonna go

179
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:27,790
um and another shout out to all the people that created
wrestlers uh for everybody for like all the other all the

180
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:34,730
other uh participants like i know it's a lot of work because
when people were creating it themselves uh literally streams

181
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,030
would be like three plus hours sometimes so like a huge
shout out uh a huge shout out to the people who were

182
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:53,080
creating uh the fans were creating wrestlers for us as well
and also like To the character, to like the the vtubers

183
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:01,520
Because whoever fucking made the Phillion the Phillion
wrestler And made that wrestler flip like 200,000 times That

184
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:11,640
was so accurate I was just like watch the phillians wrestler
Was honestly one of the most memorable for me Because all

185
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:20,920
she did was flip She would flip like 200,000 fucking
thousand times That's all she would do It was just It was so

186
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,580
accurate.

187
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I couldn't believe how accurate this was.

188
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,800
She was so fucking fast.

189
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,660
Yeah, she would flip and dance.

190
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah.

191
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,220
So, here's a shout out to everybody that made a wrestler
for, and, like, made it so accurate to the actual person.

192
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,360
It was actually crazy.

193
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,200
Okay.

194
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,640
Oh, yeah.

195
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,840
Before I talk more about WrestleTuber, I also really want to
talk about Anime North.

196
00:21:51,880 --> 00:22:01,540
um okay so like um i'll talk about uh uh i talked about this
during the panel so those who were there at anime north will

197
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:13,800
remember what i said then but like i almost like had a panic
attack before before like it started because because i

198
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,600
thought there was only 10 people that had showed up

199
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:32,800
Okay, so, like, um, so basically, the, when it was like 10
minutes, um, the staff was like, oh, um, we're gonna let

200
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,500
people in now.

201
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,360
And I was like, okay.

202
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,500
And then literally only 10 people walked in.

203
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,500
I was like, oh.

204
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:48,360
That was just like, I was like, oh, I mean, I guess.

205
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,860
And then, and then, and then I.

206
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:01,040
wait i was like oh maybe yeah maybe like you know people
didn't only 10 people were there early and then and then i

207
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:11,160
was just like okay that's okay ducky yeah you're so silly
ducky when you think there's that many people that are gonna

208
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:19,880
see you and then and then like and then like literally like
three minutes later more people started showing up but then

209
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,280
it went from 10 to like 30.

210
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,840
So I was like, oh, that's a lot better.

211
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:33,660
I was just like, oh, that's a lot better.

212
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,880
30 people is a lot better.

213
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:46,260
And then literally on at the at 830 EST, because it was like
EST like Eastern time, like when the panel was about to like

214
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,860
was supposed to start, suddenly like 600 people started
fucking getting into the room.

215
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,140
And I was like, holy fuck, I was just, I was just like, oh
my god, I was like, what happened?

216
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,880
Were all of you just late?

217
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,740
I was so surprised.

218
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,640
I was like, 600, because like the maximum amount was 600.

219
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,660
So I was like, were all of you just fucking late?

220
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,500
Like, what the fuck happened?

221
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,560
But apparently people, there was a lot of people outside.

222
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:24,300
And like, apparently staff had to give like tickets or
something to like, make sure you guys don't go above the

223
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:34,700
fire hazard uh like um so like there were a lot of people
actually lining up but then they had to give like wristbands

224
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:42,060
or something so that's why people were um they couldn't let
everybody in right away because they all had to get

225
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:49,440
wristbanded so like when everybody like 600 people got
wristbanded they let them in so they let them in at exactly

226
00:24:52,020 --> 00:25:01,960
I was like so sad because I was like, oh man, I was thinking
maybe I should do less conventions because I was like, you

227
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,260
know, 30 people.

228
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,400
Like I feel so bad because they're paying me to be here at
these conventions too.

229
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,200
So I was like, oh man, if I only brought 30 people, I'm so,
I'll be, I'm so, I feel bad.

230
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,600
I made the pay, I made the pay so much money for me to be
here.

231
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,020
And then, and then 600 dragoons showed up.

232
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,300
And I was like, oh, thank God.

233
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,140
My price was just so much.

234
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,920
I'm joking.

235
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm joking.

236
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,300
I don't charge that much.

237
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,080
But like, but, but also in my mind, I was like, oh, thank
God.

238
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,360
Okay, I did not, I did not, like, like, what's the word?

239
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,540
I was not too expensive.

240
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,860
It was justified for how much I charged to be here.

241
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:04,620
yeah not a scammer not a scammer because i over like i
filled the entire hall um apparently a lot of people wanted

242
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:15,220
to still be there but of course uh um like i said like uh
because uh uh we we couldn't have more than 600 people

243
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:22,640
because of like fire safety so like we had apparently we did
have to like turn people away but do not worry oh there's

244
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,020
gonna be a lot of other conventions um for the jokey world
tour so don't worry guys

very first convention I did, um, I did, um, uh, Azdoki, and

248
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
being able to do a Canadian convention was great.

249
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,460
Uh, I've never done a Canadian convention before, so I was
really happy to be able to, you know, um, visit people at

250
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,780
Anime North and do a panel.

251
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,240
Uh, I hope you, I apparently a lot of people had a lot of
fun at the panel.

252
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,180
That's great.

253
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,200
I told some stories that I couldn't tell on stream, so.

254
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,360
If you were there, you would know exactly why I can't tell
that story on stream.

255
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,280
So they got some exclusive stories just for panels.

Oh, yeah, each convention I go to, I tell a very exclusive
story.

291
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,140
So, like, it's like, you know how, like, at conventions, you

387
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:30,220

else handle the opus stuff um handling the scenes and
everything making sure like all the scene stuff is running

390
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:56,740
chat polls i handled the obs i told the commentators who's
gonna be fighting next i was like the cast i was like dick

392
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:21,260
it was on me everything and also like all the other people
that helped too uh we know because of charlie yeah that that

393
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,980
charlie thing was so fucking funny because like but then it
was like wait who's next and then i literally just wrote

394
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:34,660
charlie versus octavio and like i was like there's no way
that she actually doesn't know who bettle is there's no

395
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:53,320
i was like there's no way the guest the list the participant
list and the bracket was all there like like i wrote it down

396
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,960
Did I just decide to test her I was I don't know I just was
I just wanted to test her to see To see if like you know if

397
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,960
if she really knew who who who pedal is

398
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:20,460
It was funny though it was pretty it was pretty funny that I
actually I got away with that I was like hilarious we're

399
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,360
just no it was just fucking funny so funny Hmm.

400
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,820
See, not pass.

401
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,320
I mean, it's funny to just fuck with people sometimes, you
know?

402
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,400
Um.

403
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,660
Um, but yeah.

404
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:41,000
Things that would do differently for, uh, WrestleTuber, um,
I think.

405
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,560
I don't know.

406
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,160
I don't know, honestly.

407
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,800
I don't know.

408
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,760
Because, like, I know, like, I was thinking, oh, maybe,
like, people should fight, like, uh, you know, instead of,

409
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,980
like, just straight off single elimination, there should be
a felt like the reason why i don't want to do a double

410
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,920
elimination which means like if you get knocked out the
first time you you get to fight again to in the loser's

411
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:09,880
bracket but the reason why i don't want to do a double
elimination was because it's a lot of time because like

412
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:17,460
single like single elimination is already like two days you
know we already have two days like it already was a long

413
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:28,040
time for two days so that's why like i don't think i want to
yeah that would just take I feel like two days is like the

414
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:36,320
perfect amount of days and like because of that I feel like
I like the amount of people we got like 20 like was it well

415
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:45,340
to be fair we had a lot of surprise wrestlers so so I guess
it would be like 30 was it 33 wrestlers I think was like an

416
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:56,780
okay amount to have for um for it dark wind thank you for
the akasupa thank you thank you hi see I told you i was not

you thank you um i feel like for that i feel like that's

424
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,860
what show matches are for i still want to keep the
tournament format i mean like i like that someone was like

425
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:20,660
trying to do like uh tag team i like that idea a tag team
tournament i don't know if can uh can uh

426
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:32,440
2k 24 do that is there like tag team tournaments that we
could do that's not like uh because like because if we can

427
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,620
then i think a tag team tournament would be really fun too
in the future um i don't know that would be a thing for next

428
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,060
year but like i do like that idea i do like that idea

429
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:55,930
and i think it'll be fun if it's like mixed as well like you
know like um you spin the wheel to uh random teammates so

430
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:02,470
that like um you know people can form friendships over that
a lot really fun thing about it is just seeing all the

431
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:09,210
friendships being formed as well like seeing uh seeing like
people who normally don't interact with each other uh

432
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:16,550
suddenly being our like really close friends just from um
just from like wrestle tuber like we already saw like so

433
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:25,570
many friendships being formed from other vtubers and uh just
like people are now like close friends and they're like uh

434
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:31,090
following each other and hanging out and stuff like that and
uh i thought it was like really nice to see.

435
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,030
It was really, really nice to see from WrestleTuber.

436
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:44,710
And like other VTubers, getting to know, you know, other
VTubers and like the the integration between like Twitch

437
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:52,090
viewers and Twitch viewers, corporate viewers, and indie
viewers just coming together for one big event.

438
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,090
It's been like super fun to see.

439
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,610
Where are you stuffed out?

440
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,430
I don't know.

441
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:06,590
I don't know what else, what other changes i'll make to the
wrestle tuber format um i think like usually like as usual i

442
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:17,150
might have like an open call uh to see like it's a because
like mature all the participants um in wrestle tuber like i

443
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:26,430
specifically reached out to um and asked if they want to
join and i think like um obviously i don't know a lot of uh

444
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:34,030
i like some of them were like i asked like an like some like
you know I wanted to invite some some indies I don't really

445
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:42,770
know a lot of the indie community in vtubing because I was
like you know um I wasn't part of that circle uh for like I

446
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,050
wasn't really part of that circle before so like I didn't
really know who were like big indies and who are like

447
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:55,470
well-known indies um in the community so I did ask like some
people like oh if you have any recommendations like feel

448
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:04,190
free to recommend me some indie vtubers you would like to
bring along Like, if you have any recommendations, um, like,

449
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,750
feel free to send, send in, like, people you want to join.

450
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:16,250
And I think, like, in the future, I would love to, like, I
guess, like, be like, hey, guys, uh, if you, uh, if you make

451
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:24,210
an open call, I guess, on Twitter and be like, if you don't
want to join, uh, WrestleTuber 2025, uh, just please, like,

452
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,870
you know, just throw your comp, throw your comment in so I
can, like, maybe you might get picked, you know?

453
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,530
it'd definitely be a lot easier

454
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:43,530
it definitely would be a lot easier to do instead of me
reaching out to people and like aligning schedules and stuff

455
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:49,970
like that well if it's just like comments I can just like
send a DM after like looking through the comments and stuff

456
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:58,890
but like I do want to keep it like like I guess like my max
cutoff would be 30 would be 30 that would be my max cutoff

457
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:10,630
because like days was is i think two days is the most
optimal you know like the turn um i like how i do like that

458
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:22,050
i uh it be my very first wrestling event that i've ever
organized as dokey braid um we didn't keep we kept the uh

459
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:28,810
the interviews and stuff not that long we tried we tried to
make sure the interviews did not last too long because i

460
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:37,170
wasn't sure the matches were going to be so i i tried to
make sure like the interview portion didn't last too long um

461
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:49,610
so i did like that as like a thing i did for this this year
um uh yeah uh be interesting to see what happens for next

462
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:57,230
year uh perk perk thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you what about hell in the cell tournament match

463
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,970
wrestle tuber was amazing dokey hope to see more Um, I'm not
sure yet.

464
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:09,730
I don't know if I want to Uh, deviate from the regular
one-on-one Um, if anything, I think I would love to do like

465
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:18,130
Tag team Um, if I do want to deviate and change something,
change something For the format in terms of like the

466
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:25,810
tournament format I think like tag team would be like really
fun to do Just because it's like, you know, 2v2 tag team Or

467
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:31,930
like, like, you know, they tag each other out And stuff, I
think that would be like really fun a really fun tournament

468
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,250
idea because, like, you know, there's more friendships being
made from that.

469
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:36,630
Hmm.

470
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,550
Um, but we'll see.

471
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,610
We'll see what the storyline will be next year.

472
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,150
Uh, we'll see what it's going to be like.

473
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,150
Um, alright, the thing that everybody wants to know, like

474
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:59,770
always keep because, like, I think, um, this is going to be
a short stream, guys.

475
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,390
I I'm still very exhausted

476
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:15,230
I am like really tired So like I'm really sorry I can't do a
super long stream today For like the after party I really

477
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:23,770
okay the reason I really wanted to do the after party After
the WrestleTuber The WrestleTuber event was over Because

478
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:32,550
usually after every event I would do an after party But I
got caught uh what's the word uh i think like mentory told

479
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:38,210
it already but like basically what happened was that min and
i ended up talking for four plus hours last night not not

480
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,630
last night the night before

481
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:52,470
i lost track of time and we ended up just like catching up
and talking for uh four hours um so i couldn't do i didn't

482
00:49:52,470 --> 00:50:04,630
do the after party and um like i said usually i save i know
you is the story that everybody wants to hear like for all

483
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:11,550
you guys that's tapped out right now this is it guys you can
tap back in now to hear the story

484
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:25,750
um anyway anyway so um a lot of guys were wondering like uh
oh like was meant a last minute

485
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:37,010
is um um so i i think like i sort of like i saw like what
mint said so like i wanted like make sure like i said like

486
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:45,930
similar stuff so that like i don't like reveal like uh like
you know i just say like what she said already um and add a

487
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:56,890
little bit of info behind the scenes um but basically oh my
gosh i'm nervous now oh my god your nervousness is coming to

488
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:05,190
me even though it's my story like it's like my story and now
you guys are making me nervous telling it

489
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:26,730
um anyway anyway so um like i said um we only recently uh uh
god were able to talk again um uh so i saw like i'm just

490
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:32,210
like remembering what she said so i gotta make sure like It
says something And

491
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:47,790
She was the one That Sorry if there's like pauses Because I
had to think about what I'm saying Basically She was the one

492
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:58,490
that initiated First And I really appreciate that Because I
think I told her I was like I didn't like If she never

493
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:07,370
initiated, I don't think I would have, I don't think like we
would have ever talked if she never initiated, because I was

494
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:11,510
never going to, I was never going to initiate first.

495
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:22,230
So she was the one that reached out first by following me on
Twitter.

496
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,490
And I saw that she followed me on Twitter.

497
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:39,750
and so from there I followed her back and from that my
management team noticed that we were following each other

498
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:51,470
again so one of my staff members in my management team
actually sent an email out to Mint asking if she wanted to

499
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:57,910
join WrestleTuber because it was already announced and I
guess you guys can get the timeline of everything because

500
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:06,450
like people who like could see like how like when we
followed each other and uh from there like my management

501
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:14,210
team and then like mint responded back and my management
team like one of my staff members um like gave her my

502
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:22,290
discord and then like we we connected back from there and
like you know we sent out like we talked a lot like in

503
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:30,490
discord and then from there uh where we had like a four hour
after WrestleTuber, we had a four hour like, you know, just

504
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,710
chatting and reconnecting and everything.

505
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,690
So that was really nice.

506
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,950
It was really, it was very, I guess like therapeutic to say.

507
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,290
It was very therapeutic to be able to talk to her again.

508
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:51,910
Because I know like there was a lot of questions regarding
this, but I never got a chance to say goodbye.

509
00:53:53,110 --> 00:54:03,630
So like, that's why I never reached out to her um and
because i didn't know where i was at for a lot of things so

510
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:14,830
like i didn't want to like intrude or like i didn't know
where i was um for it so that's why uh that's why i told her

511
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:26,990
i was like if you never initiated i would have never like
tried anything because it was more so of like oh um um i

512
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:39,550
didn't like i just didn't i was scared i was just really
like i just didn't know where i was at so that's why uh i

513
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:49,470
really appreciate that she like uh took the first step you
know and uh and then some people are asking um was matara

514
00:54:49,470 --> 00:55:00,010
also last minute yes she was last minute as well uh it would
we i asked mint uh after the first day was over i asked mint

515
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:06,250
i was like hey like you know do you want to fight matara
like does matara want to join you know like and like because

516
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:14,930
i was like we do have like two spots here like you know like
the like because i like i realized oh we have like two i did

517
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:26,710
my math wrong with the brackets and like you know like i was
like oh like that section you know missing and then usually

518
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:35,010
like i was thinking like oh okay we'll just like grab
somebody we'll just like grab somebody who's like who got

519
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:42,090
eliminated early on and who got eliminated early on and then
put like put them back in but then i was one i was like

520
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:49,990
thinking you know like i think you know mint and matara
fighting like i don't know the mint and matara fight i feel

521
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:56,250
like people would really want to see it so i asked mint if
like Matara was down and Matara said that she was down even

522
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:04,190
though like you know she was on vacation she would love to

524
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:23,890
into WrestleTuber and I really appreciate Matara for uh
joining as well since like I said And I think she still did.

525
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,770
Oh, no, she came back.

526
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,370
I saw that she recently was streaming.

527
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,250
She's streaming today.

528
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,530
So she was on her vacation.

529
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,790
And so I really appreciate Matara sending in, like, the
voice lines and stuff.

530
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:40,270
And shout out to my editor for making the video three hours
before the event.

531
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:48,210
My editor literally made the video three to four hours
before it was, like, about to start.

532
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,530
So for day two.

533
00:56:52,830 --> 00:57:00,730
shout out to my editor for getting that done um because i
was like to my editor i was like can you do it i'm really

534
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:09,070
sorry like this is so last minute like i was like i'm so
sorry like it was such a last last minute edition and we

535
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:18,570
just got like we just got the voice lines and stuff um like
the morning of the day two so uh so yeah Like that's

536
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,730
basically how Matara got involved.

537
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,630
Yusun has been, has actually been invited for a while.

538
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:31,590
Like I think it was like the day after the announcement that
Yusun was invited.

539
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:36,030
And that was always my plan because I thought it would be
really fucking funny because I was just thinking about, you

540
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,670
know, like, like Yusun coming in with a seal, with a fucking
seal chair.

541
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,930
Like, you know, like I thought it was, I thought it'd be
really funny.

542
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:52,990
and it was like uh you saw him like message me um the day
because like before then i was thinking keeping it strictly

543
00:57:52,990 --> 00:58:01,550
to like like na participants like na eu participants for
wrestle tuber um but then like we had like you know the last

544
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:08,990
minute editions with holostars and stuff like that and like
also a huge shout out again to axel for getting holostars um

545
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:16,970
into the event like super last minute um literally literally
like two days before the i think two days before the

546
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:24,730
announcement of the event two or three days before the
announcement of the event axel uh got holostars involved um

547
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:34,930
so like there was a lot of things that were happening last
minute but i think like i don't really i think like uh uh i

548
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:46,930
didn't think uh um it was like how the word i don't think
that uh rest tuber would be as good as it was without all of

549
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:54,270
these last minute additions so it all worked out in the end
which was fucking insane because usually when you do stuff

550
00:58:54,270 --> 00:59:07,840
last minute it doesn't work out in the end so so like
somehow everything just worked out like i like as a one man

551
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,360
army somehow everything just worked out

552
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:23,440
um and oh my gosh yes like the gibo and the taka guest
casting and the guest announcement oh a cute shout out to

553
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,200
taka for fucking jumping in last minute to do the
announcement stuff because saiyu was like you know like he

554
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,940
had like issues on day one with like his own personal
schedule like something unexpectedly came up for day one so

555
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:43,180
taka coming in clutch literally like I think like 30 minutes
like I think like an hour 30 minutes before the actual

556
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:51,700
stream stream was about to start like huge shout out to him
for for taking the announcement announcer role there

557
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:03,540
um oh yeah yeah yeah I didn't know if like he said the Sayu
said anything regarding why he wasn't there but yes he had a

558
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,640
flight canceled because I didn't want to say it because I
wasn't sure if he said why he wasn't there because I didn't

559
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,880
know if it was like a personal thing but yes he had a flight
canceled and that's why I couldn't make it for day one so

560
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:23,620
like um it was uh awesome for Taka for to to like do the do
the announcement stuff for us um I really it was like clutch

561
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,700
for everybody like I said everybody that worked on this it
was super clutch and like I really appreciate everybody like

562
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,880
coming together and staying up and working on this event
with me and making all

563
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:55,960
um um uh but yeah uh that's really how it all came to be in
terms of everything um and like uh i'm happy uh i'm really

564
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:07,220
happy that everything just worked out in the end and like
i'm happy that mint reached out like i said like uh i said

565
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:13,180
like to people were like oh why don't you talk to this
person why don't you talk to that person like um regarding

566
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:23,320
like people i've used to um might have talked to before um
i'm just letting them do the first step because like i don't

567
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:32,740
want to intrude on anything and i don't know like where i'm
at at certain places so because of that that's why i'm step

568
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:40,840
when it comes to these things um because i don't want to put
anybody in like a weird position uh for anything so like

569
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:50,920
usually i'm just waiting for people to do the first step
like i um if they if they extend their hand to me first then

570
01:01:50,920 --> 01:02:02,340
um then then obviously i'll reciprocate reciprocate uh so
yeah that's basically how it is

571
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:18,460
Oh yes Tengen I'm very excited for the collab tomorrow With
Tengen For those who are I'll tell Tengen this tomorrow But

572
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:30,940
like For those who are there for the story about Tarkov That
was Tengen You guys remembered my Tarkov story When I was

573
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:38,680
talking about this that still bought Tarkov after this
trauma because it was on sale.

574
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,680
Like, that was, that was Tengen.

575
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,880
Because he was like, bro, but it's 50% off, bro.

576
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,360
I'm like, bro, they just literally had a controversy.

577
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,320
And he's like, but it was a 50% off.

578
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,800
No, no, it was 80% off.

579
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,740
He's like, no, you don't understand.

585
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,280

me out

586
01:03:47,740 --> 01:04:01,420
um um but yes I'm super excited for uh tomorrow with the
apex collab uh with Tengen he was actually supposed to be in

587
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:09,680
my no key a invitation of hide and seek but because like it
was so last minute and like uh because i uh we had some

588
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:17,420
issues with teammates uh regarding the hide and seek stuff
so like i had four times i had to find substitute teammates

589
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:28,320
and tangent was originally it's not the original but he was
one of the first substitutes he he was the first substitute

590
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:38,740
um but like because of like scheduling wise we had like
issues with scheduling wise for like the og teammates um and

591
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:51,660
tangent was the original but then because he lives in um he
lives in like indonesia uh i was like oh shit okay Hey, can

592
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,860
you guys, because they need to send, like, the Nokia stuff.

593
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:57,580
So I was like, hey, my team, my first, this is my first
choice sub.

594
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,180
Can you, like, send, send, like, these things to Indonesia?

595
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,720
And they're like, no, because customs.

596
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,700
I was like, they're like, we don't know what the customs
gonna be like.

597
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,040
Like, we don't know if we get lucky with the customs.

598
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,960
So, so he couldn't be the, he couldn't be a teammate.

599
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,100
because like they were worried that the stuff wouldn't be
there in time did you guys know Nokia's really fucking good

600
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:35,520
with like Wi-Fi stuff infrastructure like that's the whole
point with this like apex invitational it's the tests out

601
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:42,720
there like Wi-Fi like their new Wi-Fi thing because
apparently Nokia is now instead of phones they do like Wi-Fi

602
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:53,420
infrastructure yeah they they they're like apparently like
known for like wi-fi stuff now i mean i did not know that um

603
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:01,020
so they they're sending us yeah they're sending us like the
why like i have one like i haven't set it up yet uh we're

604
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:10,580
supposed to learn how to set it up okay apex over yes okay i
found out when i got invited like like guys i knew when i

605
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:23,920
got invited because i had to research what why we had we're
um but but yes anyway um they have to send out this pack

606
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:36,100
this like care package which included the Wi-Fi tower the
Wi-Fi kit or whatever um and uh really so it is an bro it

607
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:47,800
literally says sponsored by Nokia I literally have Nokia on
the schedule damn right it's sponsored by no damn right is

608
01:06:47,800 --> 01:07:00,920
like an advertisement like the whole tournament is like to
advertise their wi-fi shit like uh yeah he got physically

609
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:09,260
tension got physically region locked out of the game thank
you for the super chat thank you thank you uh neil um but

610
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:18,960
yes uh so that's why like uh tension couldn't be the
original substitute and i literally messaged uh fun um i

611
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:25,860
literally messaged fun because i saw like i know who's like
basically almost like all the pro players not all the pro

612
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:31,900
players but like pro players that are well known are in the
hide and seek tournament this like hide and seek tournament

613
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:41,480
um because like jen i i originally message Jen as one of the
other substitute but Jen was already taken Jen was like fuck

614
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,940
if you messaged me like an hour earlier I would have been
your teammate Jen Burton by the way um because I messaged

615
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:54,780
Jen Burton and literally he got swiped an hour before I
messaged him so I couldn't get Jen Burton so then I was

616
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:00,140
looking through like who's in the tournament and it was like
majority of like the well-known pro players were already

617
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:08,160
like snagged so I was like so I messaged fun because i
didn't see fun on the list i was like hey fun like uh do you

618
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:15,980
have like are you in this tournament and he was like no like
fun fps and um and he's like i was like yeah he's like oh no

619
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:22,380
no like and i was like do you want to do it um and he's like
oh sure yeah i was like okay and i was like can you bring a

620
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:37,680
pro player because i didn't want to look anymore i didn't i
didn't want and i'm looking i'm tired looking for teammates

621
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:44,140
so i was like do you do you want to bring somebody like do
you know any pro players that's like not taking it like well

622
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:52,560
i have my teammate reptar by the way for those who don't
know reptar he's been like he has been multiple rank one in

623
01:08:52,560 --> 01:09:00,320
apex legends so he's been like he's been like rank one apex
predator yes i've outsourced Look, my original teammates

624
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,160
couldn't do it.

625
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:02,920
Tengen couldn't do it.

626
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,020
I literally had, like, one other sub that couldn't do it.

627
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:06,280
Like,

628
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,720
so I outsourced, okay?

629
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,780
I was tired of looking.

630
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:23,120
I had other things to do, like, sleeping after WrestleTuber.

631
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,280
So, um...

632
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:35,500
Um, so yes, I told, I was like, please, fun, do you know
anybody?

633
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:45,360
And then, fun brought Reptar in, so I practically have,
like, their entire team, but I'm the new, I'm the IGL now.

634
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,120
I'm the IGL now.

635
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,920
They're signed to Jokey Bird team now.

636
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,040
It's hide-and-seek, man.

637
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,840
How bad can it be?

638
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,260
It's literally hide-and-seek.

639
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,480
Like, how fucked are they?

640
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,200
They just need to hide.

641
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,680
That's all they need to do.

642
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:10,320
They know the fucking maps better than me.

643
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,860
So they're gonna carry me.

644
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,620
Dark Blade, thank you for the super chat.

645
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,520
Thank you, thank you.

646
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,360
Sorry, I meant you mixed me with someone else.

647
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,840
Not the wrong name.

648
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,080
Also, you considered...

649
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,800
Well, I mean, like, I didn't know what you guys...

650
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,160
Like, I just knew your icons.

651
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:34,420
should you dark blade you should have brought up a paper and
printed out your icon and then i would have recognized that

652
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:40,760
you were dark blade i didn't hear the the last parts are
dark but i didn't hear the blade parts so i assume you meant

653
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:48,060
dark wing because like you know dark wings real in in the
chat so like i you know my fucking visuals of you guys was

654
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:55,160
your is your fucking icons so you should have printed your
icon and then i would have not mistaken you

655
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,860
Darkwing, come back out!

656
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,800
Show your presence, everybody, so people know I'm not crazy.

657
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,720
We consider a loser bracket next year.

658
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,400
I know it'd be a longer event, but it'd be fun.

659
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,620
Like I said, I talked about this earlier.

660
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,040
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

661
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:13,780
Thank you.

662
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,780
But like I said, like the reason why I don't know if I want
to do a loser bracket because it would take a really long

663
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,180
time.

664
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,360
Especially, like, if we do a loser bracket, we have to cut
down on participants.

665
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:34,740
not no reason but that was the reason why i didn't really
want to do i was like thinking about it for next year but

666
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:46,440
like um and i was like worried that uh worried that like
having a loser bracket will have will mean we have to have

667
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:55,840
less participants uh joining in because it'll be way too
long now i'm thinking of a super chat thinking thank you off

668
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,880
topic but have you decide whether you're going to go to evo
thank you the super chat thank you thank you it's a secret

669
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:16,140
kaz thank you the super chat thank you thank you you'll know
after evo's over if i was there or not because then if after

670
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,820
evo is over maybe there'll be a stream maybe there's gonna
be a waiting room that would be like whoa my story's from

671
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:31,960
evo but if there's no waiting room after evo then Or I could
have a waiting room for it, and then I just make up stories.

672
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,240
Oh, I should just do that.

673
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,100
Or maybe I'll just make up stories as if I was that evil.

674
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,440
You'll never know.

675
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,380
You'll never know if it's true or not.

676
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,360
The misdirected.

677
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,120
It's not paywall because it'll be a stream.

678
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:49,980
Kaz, thank you.

679
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,440
Thank you.

680
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,880
I'm not the same person I was two icons ago.

681
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,180
Thank you for the super chat.

682
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:56,520
Thank you.

683
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,260
Thank you.

684
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:08,920
um i know i wrote down some how is it gatekeeping streams

685
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:20,320

me i wrote down stuff is there anything else that i uh that

686
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:32,820
i missed out on uh let's see no i think that's everything I
want to talk about for WrestleTuber and like Anime North and

687
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,260
everything.

688
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,060
Oh yes!

689
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:34,660
Merch!

690
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,320
Merch stuff!

691
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:35,720
Okay.

692
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,080
Like we can get a lot of emails.

693
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,320
I talked about this in the member stream.

694
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,920
I'm going to make an official post on Twitter soon.

695
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,400
Official post on Twitter soon.

696
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:51,620
But regarding merch stuff, like the debut merch stuff and
the Lunar New Year we finally have a distributor.

697
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,440
We finally got a distributor.

698
01:13:54,980 --> 01:14:07,820
But the distributor is coming over to pick up the stock like
next week and by then um shipping of stuff would start i

699
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:14,560
believe middle of next month middle of june like i know
we're a little bit like delayed regarding shipment merch

700
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:25,120
stuff but now that we have a distributor finally um i think
maybe this time like like you know shipping for stuff would

701
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:32,020
be a lot better now so there won't be like future delays i
hope uh so i hope by now like now that we have finally

702
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:40,020
settled on distributor um things will not be delayed as much
for future merch release i'm still not releasing any new

703
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:48,420
merch yet only because i am wayne like i said i'm not i'm
not gonna release any new merch until like the district like

704
01:14:48,420 --> 01:15:00,180
shipment of old merch is situated that's why nothing has
been released products have been released i do have like new

705
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:07,140
product plans and stuff but like i haven't put it out just
because i don't want to you know prompt like i don't want to

706
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:13,540
have like so much stuff promised and then like just you know
i don't want you guys to like wait for like 500 orders that

707
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:23,900
never like uh arrive um and so i like i don't care like i
like i i talked about this before But like if I had like you

708
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:31,980
know merch releases every month or so that would have been
like 60 to 70% of my income like legitimately I would make

709
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:43,600
so much more money off of merch release versus like
streaming if I had consistent merch release but like I'd

710
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:55,260
rather have everything fucking figured out and have all the
stuff situated when it comes to when it comes to like, you

711
01:15:55,260 --> 01:16:02,560
know, making sure everybody's getting their stuff and
everybody is getting their shipment shipped and everything

712
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,260
before I fucking released anything.

713
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,500

out the plans and everything and oh my god it was uh i i the

791
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:39,320
one thing i forgot to do was show the gamer subcodes for

because I forgot to I forgot to put it on stream so yeah I
was like whoops but like because I really appreciate them

798
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:33,500
giving up their time you know the time to do all of this and
their time to um their time to uh to participate in

799
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:39,520
WrestleTuber because it is a big commitment and like for
those who are part of the tournament you wouldn't know that

800
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:49,460
like you wouldn't know like you know like when they had to
leave so they have to make their entire schedule open you

801
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:55,300
have to make your entire day open because you don't know
when you're supposed to leave like when you're done because

802
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:59,160
like you know those who are part of tournament they don't
know if they're gonna make it to day two so they have to

803
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:07,360
make sure their entire schedule for day two was uh was
opened you know so there was that and like a huge shout out

804
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,180
to everybody for just like leaving their schedule that open.

805
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,300
I just remember something I forgot to say about the USAN
thing.

806
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,680
So like, yeah, USAN like message when we announced it,
because I didn't tell anybody what the announcement was and

807
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,480
those that were invited.

808
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,480
So like USAN found out about Restituber the moment I
announced it.

809
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,980
And then they sent me a message in support too.

810
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:30,100
And they're like, oh my gosh, like, Doki, like I'm so proud
of you for organizing this.

811
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,160
And then I was like, you know what, USAN?

812
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,260
You have to be there.

813
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,500
You have to be a surprise guest, USAN.

814
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:46,680
Like, you have to be a surprise guest and like to be like
the the fucking coming in with the steel chair the classic

815
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:54,580
wwe twist um because usad first was like didn't was like not
didn't want to do it but like they were worried that they

816
01:24:54,580 --> 01:25:01,360
would fuck it up type deal they were worried that they
wouldn't be able to um do in a way that people would like it

817
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:09,920
would like enjoy it from about i was like no it'll be so
good usad it'll be so funny because it's such a classic wwe

818
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:20,260
twist um yeah yusang was my batista so i i was just like no
you have to do it'll be so fucking funny yusang like trust

819
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:27,000
me people are gonna love it and then yusang like showed me
like oh i could use like this person and like have a video

820
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,600
and have this rigged and everything i was like oh my god
perfect and they were they they were like the one you see i

821
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:41,220
was supposed to only have one surprise guest and it was just
gonna be usan and then obviously like the last minute stuff

822
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:45,360
came up so we had three surprise guests

823
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:59,280
so like huge shout out to usan for uh for doing all of that
uh for the for the finals and they that they you know they

824
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,980
fucking did it was perfect it was

825
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:13,320
Like, Musa was not supposed to kick Betel's ass that fast,
because, like, literally I told the person who made the You

826
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,380
Man model, to, like, it had to be the same as everybody
else.

827
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:27,620
So, like, Betel could have won that, because the stats were
the same, and I don't know how the fuck he got destroyed so

828
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:30,420
fast, and, like, literally died.

829
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:38,320
Like, I don't know how he fucking just died.

830
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,200
Like, outside the ring.

831
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,280
Now, people are like, it was a count-out.

832
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:51,120
He's not supposed to lose his championship belt.

833
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:54,940
They were gonna- he was gonna keep his belt anyway, guys.

834
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:59,980
But for the sake of the storyline, we, like, joked that he
lost his belt.

835
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,000
titled.

836
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,920
Like, he's still a loser because he lost to Yuson.

837
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:16,180
So like, you can't be like, he's not a winner because he's
still fucking died.

838
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:21,400
Like, he's still he's still, he's still fucking died.

839
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,420
You can't call him a winner if he just dies.

840
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:24,480
Like,

841
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:36,460
but anyway, um, anyway, I like how so was like he's always
been my loser quote affectionate

842
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:46,140
but but he gets to he still gets a belt he he still gets a
belt guy

843
01:27:50,500 --> 01:28:03,480
oh um anyway that was great it can't be a winner if you're
dead exactly he's looking like in the We're waiting for him

844
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,880
to wake up from his coma.

845
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:12,520
We're just waiting for him to wake up from the coma, guys.

846
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,920
Like, thoughts and prayers for him at the hospital.

847
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:22,620
I was so angry, but glad that he got the belt.

848
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,200
Like, yeah, like, it was so, like, it was so, like, all fun
in games.

849
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:32,440
Like, he is the, he, we can say that he is, like, the...

850
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:38,440
The, the tournament winner, but not the WrestleMania winner.

851
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,720
I feel like that's the best way to describe it.

852
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:48,540
He won the tournament, but Usong was the event boss, the
final boss.

853
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,680
So he wasn't the, the Wrestle Tuber champion.

854
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,440
He was a tournament champion, but not the Wrestle Tuber
champion.

855
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:09,780
Yeah, when you win the battle, but lost the war the secret
final boss yeah the people's champ he was the people's champ

856
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:16,460
um anyway adam you maddest wrestle tuber guy

857
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:31,820
um anyway that was it was great uh i had a great time um
with everything that happened Next week will definitely be a

858
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:33,160
chill week for me.

859
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:38,420
I'm going to relax and I'm going to relax next week.

860
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:40,940
But this week is still working time.

861
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,640
It's still Jokey Bird workout.

862
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,140
Thank you for all the super chat, everybody.

863
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,900
I really appreciate it, guys.

864
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:57,820
Also, I actually had people in the comments being like, the
game glitched.

865
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,540
Billion was supposed to win that.

866
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:06,800
But, like, what happened was that apparently Beto made his
wrestler incredibly dishonest.

867
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,100
So, like, he would purposely rig the matches.

868
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:15,600
And apparently, so when you saw, we saw him, like, took
those, like, things down on the ring.

869
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:21,560
The reason why the referee wasn't there was because, like,
the game didn't glitch.

870
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,740
The referee turned his back to fix the ring.

871
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,540
And because he turned his back to fix the ring, that was the
exact moment.

872
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,720
moment that Phelian pinned Betel.

873
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:34,760
So Betel got a free freebie there.

874
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,940
That was actually fuck.

875
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,720
Betel's AI wrestling was fucking insane.

876
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:40,700
Like I don't know.

877
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:44,860
Like I feel like like I felt like the Betel AI was
self-aware.

878
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:56,360
There's no like I'm I felt like the Betel AI evolved to be
self-aware to a point where that's why he fucking died.

879
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:10,740
he gained he gained sentience because like like he was he
did okay for the entire tournament and then and like he did

880
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:24,200
battle things and then like he continued to do battle things
when he fucking died like so so it was actually crazy i i

881
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:40,740
