00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,570
Hello, hello!

2
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,870
Welcome!

3
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,650
Welcome to Rust Kingdoms.

4
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,490
So, I am in the Lurk Lands right now.

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,010
So, if you guys don't know, I have an exclusive Twitch drop.

6
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,370
So, what that means is that... I want to say a huge thank you to Abe and Sykkuno.

7
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,110
Abe went to Sykkuno telling him he had an exclusive Twitch drop and he asked Sykkuno, like, who do you want to be?

8
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,810
Because you're supposed to partner up for the Twitch drop.

9
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,150
And Sykkuno was like, I want to have a Twitch drop... I want to have a Rust drop with Doki.

10
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:30,410
So, a huge shoutout to Sykkuno for just suggesting me and giving me an opportunity to have a gun skin.

11
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,150
We get to pick whatever items we wanted.

12
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,290
And Sykkuno was like, we have to get an AK gun.

13
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,790
We have... because I didn't know anything about Rust, because I was like...

14
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,470
I was like, oh wait, like, what do we... what should we get?

15
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,770
Because we could get a skin for anything we want.

16
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,470
And Sykkuno was like, oh, we should do an... we should get an AK.

17
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,910
And I was like, why?

18
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,250
And he's like, the AK in Rust is the best gun in the game.

19
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,770
So...

20
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,790
Oh, fuck!

21
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,670
Oh, shit!

22
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,850
No, wait, no!

23
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:01,710
No!

24
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,790
No!

25
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,370
No!

26
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,370
I've been fucked!

27
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,510
No!

28
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,930
I had... I had so...

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,180
Where am I?

30
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,400
Where am I?

31
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
Where am I?

32
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,160
Where the fuck... oh my god!

33
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,960
Okay, back, I'm getting my stuff back.

34
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay, give me a second, I'm gonna try...

35
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,100
I just... I just tried to talk!

36
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,140
Anyway... anyway...

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,920
I have to go back to Lurklands!

38
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,660
I had so much wood!

39
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,280
You don't understand!

40
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,520
I had so much...

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,620
I had... I had so...

42
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,740
I had so much wood!

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,140
You don't understand!

44
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,060
I was farming the wood!

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,700
Because I was allowed to be on the server 30 minutes early, because I have a drop.

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,060
So I was like, yippee!

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm gonna farm so much wood!

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh my god, give me a sec, I have like something that keeps like popping in and out.

49
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,200
Like, what the fuck is it?

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,500
Oh...

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,840
So, anyway...

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,980
Anyway...

53
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,700
Let me go back, what was I saying?

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,860
Okay, so...

55
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,620
What the fuck is it?

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,460
Oh, it's my fucking...

57
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,260
Anyway, so...

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,340
So, Sekuro suggested me to be part of the exclusive Twitch drops.

59
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,960
And we wanted some, you know...

60
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,080
A lot of the other people, they made like drops that were more generic.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,580
So like, you know...

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,320
People who might not know the streamer would want the drop.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,620
But because like...

64
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,700
I know like, this is my...

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,340
Uh...

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,880
Uh...

67
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,600
This is my like, very first rust drop.

68
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,080
And uh...

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,880
So, and Sekuro wanted something that was branded towards our fans!

70
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,980
So that's why, uh...

71
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,340
I was in charge of finding the artist for the gun.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,940
And um...

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,260
You know, at first, apparently like...

74
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,700
It was supposed to be like...

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,720
One different item per streamer.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,640
So like, each streamer who has a drop gets a different item.

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,820
But you might have noticed...

78
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,060
Me, Saekun and I...

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,580
And xQc and Trainwrecks...

80
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,020
Both are AK skins.

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Um...

82
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,320
Because we didn't know the other claimed AK as well.

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,100
And it was funny because like...

84
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,500
Apparently, Train's pair claimed it first.

85
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,420
But we didn't know.

86
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,620
But we already commissioned the artist and everything.

87
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,340
So, we were like, begging Abe.

88
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,660
We were like, Abe, please!

89
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,920
Let us have...

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Our fanbases don't even overlap!

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,100
Abe, please!

92
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,640
And then we were sending...

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,320
We were sending him like, sad cat videos.

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,480
We were like, meow, meow, meow, meow!

95
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,480
And like, begging like, please!

96
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,480
We already commissioned the artist!

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,040
We can't go back!

98
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,620
We can't!

99
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,760
We can't just tell the artist to draw something else!

100
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,180
Please!

101
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,660
We worked so hard!

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,580
And...

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,980
We were just sending him sad cat videos.

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,280
Please!

105
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,180
Let us have our AK!

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,840
That is why...

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,000
That's why there's two AK skins.

108
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,440
That's why there's...

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,860
Because we were like, please!

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,660
We already worked so hard!

111
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:24,860
We were like...

112
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,880
We were both sending him sad cat videos.

113
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,780
Wait, what the...

114
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,580
Speaking...

115
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,220
Saekuno!

116
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,280
Goodbye!

117
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,700
Alright, goodbye!

118
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,000
Alright!

119
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
That's the drive-by.

120
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I guess he...

121
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,820
He didn't see me.

122
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,740
I was like, wait!

123
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,860
Speaking of Saekuno...

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,340
Goodbye, Saekuno!

125
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,740
Anyway...

126
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,300
What a drive-by.

127
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Flashbang by a naked...

128
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,200
A naked running man.

129
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,920
It was so...

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,360
No, it was working because I was talking to somebody else.

131
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,840
Woah!

132
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,160
Woah, woah, woah!

133
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,800
I just...

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,260
I just got...

135
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,880
I...

136
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,820
Please, please spare me.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,060
I don't have anything.

138
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
I was born naked and afraid.

139
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,560
Yeah, but I was born especially naked and afraid.

140
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,880
I had no hair on me when I was born.

141
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,800
What?

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,380
What?

143
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,140
They just got kidnapped?

144
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,880
Am I supposed to come along?

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,920
Am I part of it?

146
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,520
Okay, okay!

147
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,840
Wait, but I left my bow back there!

148
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
It was a really good bow.

149
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,820
Woah!

150
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,780
Oh my god!

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,920
I guess I got kidnapped.

152
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,260
I got kidnapped to the mines.

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,300
Woah, woah.

154
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,360
It just stopped moving.

155
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,300
Can I...

156
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,600
Oh!

157
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,820
It didn't save me!

158
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,520
Wait, did everybody get that?

159
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,240
Well...

160
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,820
I'm free now.

161
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,140
Did everyone else got DC'd or was it just me?

162
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,620
Oh, it was just me.

163
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,500
It was just me!

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,720
They'll never...

165
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Sorry, I just realized.

166
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,560
I realized that...

167
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,680
Wait.

168
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,660
Why can't I connect back?

169
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,260
Wait a minute.

170
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
What the f...

171
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,360
Do I have to restart?

172
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh, I think I need to restart my game, right?

173
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,720
Okay, wait.

174
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,780
Wait, do I need to restart?

175
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,100
Oh no, I'm gabbed.

176
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,000
His mic was so fucking crunchy!

177
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,920
What is he saying?

178
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
I don't know.

179
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,460
You have to message me on Discord, Sound Guy.

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,240
Because I can't see you on here.

181
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,520
I can't see.

182
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,340
It was so crunchy.

183
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,660
I had to lock in to figure out what the fuck he was saying.

184
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,960
Oh my god, I'm alive again.

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,920
Okay, I still love how Sykkuno just literally did a drive-by and he just disappeared.

186
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,560
Alright, okay, I'm safe.

187
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,560
Alright, back to...

188
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,120
Back to my bow!

189
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,080
I will get my bow!

190
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,240
They won't know.

191
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,340
They won't know.

192
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,420
Saved by the DC!

193
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,740
Alright.

194
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
What do you do?

195
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
Oh my god.

196
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,640
So yeah.

197
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,240
So I think if you connect your Steam account...

198
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,380
Also, this is one of the newest things.

199
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,700
So it's like a coliseum where you can challenge people.

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,520
So the whole premise of Rice Kingdoms is that there's a couple of leaders around here.

201
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,620
So you can see, it's like Game of Thrones, basically.

202
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,160
So there's House Dragonclaw, House Poggerion, and then there's one more.

203
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,520
I think there's four kingdoms.

204
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Oh my god, I'm almost there.

205
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,060
I hope the pig is not there.

206
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,320
I really want my bow back.

207
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,160
I just want my bow back!

208
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:44,740
And to get the drops, you just need to connect your you just need to connect your Steam to I think like to Twitch or something and then you should be able to get it.

209
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,280
And you just need to watch a little bit.

210
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,300
So, it is a little bit unfortunate timing for me regarding Rice Kingdoms because next week I won't be at home.

211
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,060
So...

212
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,620
So I just gotta I'll try to stream Rust as much as I can before I go, which is like in three days.

213
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,460
I mean, I can try and stream Rust while I'm away.

214
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,680
I can have my laptop.

215
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,020
So the first three days is the most we're gonna get of Rust.

216
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Uh...

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,780
Are you part of the house?

218
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,940
I am part of...

219
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,900
Wait, is this it?

220
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,320
What is this?

221
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,700
Why is it glowing?

222
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,720
Oh, to harvest it faster.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,340
Okay.

224
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,700
Well, that's new.

225
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,780
Oh my god.

226
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,520
Okay.

227
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,200
I can aim.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,400
Alright.

229
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Give me that rock.

230
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,340
I don't know how to play Rust.

231
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,180
I'm just a role player.

232
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,220
I'm just...

233
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,040
Oh, it's not new.

234
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,800
Why is it glowing?

235
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,900
I've never seen a rock glow like that before.

236
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,100
When did they put that in?

237
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,180
Oh my god, please.

238
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm gonna accidentally hit my dick.

239
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:08,840
If you harvest you, I'm gonna accidentally hit my dick if I keep doing this with my rock.

240
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,160
Just a naked man and his rock.

241
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,300
Alright.

242
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Alright.

243
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,140
I don't know.

244
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,920
I think there's a lot of people on this server too.

245
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,420
I know this time around there's a lot more.

246
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,200
There's a lot of big... Where did I die?

247
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh, please tell me my stuff is still here.

248
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,400
Where the fuck did I die?

249
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,940
I got knocked off by a fucking boar.

250
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,520
Alright, there.

251
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,840
Where's my body?

252
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,260
Please, all I want is one thing and it's that giant ass bow.

253
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,340
I just want my bow back.

254
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,900
That's all.

255
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,840
Please.

256
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,740
I had a bow.

257
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,240
It had no arrows, but I like that I had it.

258
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,240
It looked threatening.

259
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,660
That's all I wanted.

260
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,320
Where am I?

261
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,860
Oh, I'm right here.

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,380
Where did I die?

263
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,940
How did I die?

264
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,880
I'm here.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,620
I thought this was me.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,020
This is me, by the way.

267
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,440
This is me.

268
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,160
I don't know why I thought this was me right there.

270
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
I'm gonna take this away.

271
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,300
That actually confused the shit out of me.

272
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm sorry, veteran Rust players.

273
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,540
I'm so sorry.

274
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,620
This is how it's gonna be for the first three days.

275
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,960
Yes, I got that Rust Twitch strap.

276
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,780
Yes, veteran Rust players.

277
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,840
I am the one you have to watch to get your gun.

278
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,960
That's right.

279
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,800
You gotta watch this gameplay now.

280
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,980
Alright.

281
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,500
Oh, there it is.

282
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,120
Nice.

283
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,300
Okay, thank god.

284
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,620
That's good.

285
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,180
I got all I needed.

286
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,260
Oh my gosh, I'm ginger.

287
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,880
The biggest crime.

288
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,800
Oh my god, there he is again.

289
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,240
There he is.

290
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,860
I need a cat.

291
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,900
Get me outta here.

292
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,420
Get me outta here.

293
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,480
Get me outta here.

294
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,700
Oh my god.

295
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm scared.

296
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,880
I usually...

297
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,740
Gumi held my hand last time.

298
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,920
So now I'm like, what do I...

299
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,020
Oh my god, he has a...

300
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,920
This guy has a fucking horse?

301
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,480
How?

302
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,920
I don't even...

303
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,260
I don't have anything.

304
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,240
Wait, there's a bunch of people there.

305
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,220
Wait, I'm starving.

306
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,420
I'm starving.

307
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,200
How do I get food?

308
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,880
Oh no, am I gonna die of hunger now?

309
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,160
How do I get food?

310
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,380
I'm scared.

311
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,860
There's a lot of people there.

312
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,090
Oh my god, what if I die?

313
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,750
There's mushrooms?

314
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,990
Okay, I don't want them to see me.

315
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,530
How do I get food?

316
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,050
I gotta scavenge.

317
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,990
Find mushrooms?

318
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,890
There's mushrooms here?

319
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,390
I'm gonna message Gumi.

320
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,710
She'll hold my hand again.

321
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,410
She actually was gonna hold my hand.

322
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,090
But I got in first.

323
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,090
Okay, wait.

324
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,950
I'll message her.

325
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,230
I am in the lurk lands.

326
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,370
Okay, also...

327
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,670
Okay, wait.

328
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,730
I almost leaked something.

329
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,130
Oh yeah, by the way...

330
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,370
Doobie will be a guest at the Phantom Thief concert.

331
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,630
That was what I almost leaked yesterday.

332
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,670
Not yesterday.

333
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,150
That was what I almost leaked on Minecraft.

334
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,450
During the hardcore plays.

335
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,490
I almost...

336
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,670
That was the one where Mint was like, Woah, woah, woah, Doki!

337
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,070
So yeah, she will be...

338
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,510
She will be a guest at the...

339
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,290
At the Phantom Thief concert in December.

340
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,730
It was a surprise for me too when I found out.

341
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,890
She was like a...

342
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,370
Last minute addition.

343
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,770
And I'm really happy that she was...

344
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,250
So yeah, she's gonna be doing a song with us.

345
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,330
With me and Mint.

346
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,330
So we're gonna have like a...

347
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,070
A song and dance together.

348
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,150
As well at the concert.

349
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,390
But yeah, I'm super excited.

350
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,630
Alright, what do you make first?

351
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,290
What do you...

352
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,750
Make first in Rust?

353
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,830
Oh my god, I still need to find food.

354
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,370
I need to find food.

355
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,090
Alright, guys.

356
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,670
I need to figure out...

357
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,710
Oh, fucking hell.

358
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,510
Oh, hello.

359
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,170
Hello.

360
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,030
I have nothing on me.

361
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,230
I am not a threat.

362
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,240
I don't even have a spear.

363
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,940
All I have is this.

364
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,140
Oh, for me?

365
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,260
Oh, it's empty.

366
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,660
Oh, thanks man.

367
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,060
Oh, you do?

368
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,040
Are you a trash cleaner?

369
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,780
Yeah, sure.

370
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,660
Do you have food on you?

371
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah, I'm a trash cleaner.

372
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,040
Is it like...

373
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,560
Oh my god, thanks man.

374
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
I found this in the trash can.

375
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,840
Oh my god.

376
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,800
It could be very moldy, so be careful.

377
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,560
You know, food's food, you know.

378
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,360
Wait, so how did you get started being a trash cleaner?

379
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,540
Well...

380
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,180
It all started when I first woke up.

381
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,180
Like...

382
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,980
Oh...

383
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,760
Oh...

384
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,780
So you're an orphan.

385
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,540
Were you raised by like the raccoons?

386
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,780
Yeah, like what?

387
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,860
Like what?

388
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Like what?

389
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,680
What did you do?

390
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,940
Hey...

391
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,920
You know what man?

392
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,720
I bet that old lady's dead anyway.

393
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,360
Okay...

394
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,000
What's she gonna do with two million dollars?

395
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
You have more to live.

396
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,720
I got more to live.

397
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,360
Exactly, you have more years.

398
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,100
You knew how to spend that two million dollars well.

399
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,520
I mean, you lost it all, but like...

400
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,960
She would have just not done anything with it.

401
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,620
You know how I lost it all?

402
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,540
You know how I lost all my money?

403
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,420
I gambled two million dollars?

404
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
On voting?

405
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,160
Yeah, no, he's a garbage man.

406
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,920
He's a garbage man.

407
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,340
You're voting what?

408
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,080
He's a gambling garbage man.

409
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,680
He's an addict.

410
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,780
He has a problem.

411
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,580
He's also an orphan.

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,020
I'm a prom dumpster baby, okay?

413
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,220
Don't forget that.

414
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah, he is the prom dumpster baby.

415
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,120
I didn't realize there was prom here in the kingdoms.

416
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,020
There's prom in the kingdoms?

417
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,700
How do you guys, how do you eat?

418
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,460
Oh, there it is.

419
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
Now I'm not hungry again.

420
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,880
Yeah?

421
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,630
Do it.

422
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,490
Wait, no, he gave me tuna.

423
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,370
Wait, he gave me tuna.

424
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,910
He's just a little, he's just a little guy.

425
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,290
Maybe we should keep him as a pet.

426
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,030
I can't wait.

427
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,030
Wait a minute.

428
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,410
If dumpster man can hear this meow right now.

429
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,220
I don't think he hears.

430
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
I don't think he hears.

431
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,160
He's just trying to find his trash.

432
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,500
Wait, how do you have all that stuff?

433
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,860
I don't know how to play.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,300
Wait, there's another person over there.

435
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,900
Who's that?

436
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,740
Hello!

437
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,660
It's lady Dima.

438
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,720
Whoa!

439
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,380
What's that over there?

440
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,300
Do you have trash?

441
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
This is our local trash cleaner.

442
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Do you have trash?

443
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
I need your trash.

444
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,980
I have a rock.

445
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,640
Alright, let's go find food.

446
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,660
I'll find food with you.

447
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,520
I have a bow with zero arrows.

448
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,410
Oh shit, what do you need to make arrows?

449
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,750
I can, I can, I can make you some.

450
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,310
Don't worry, I'm a professional.

452
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,970
I can aim.

453
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,650
I was trained to be an aimer.

454
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,710
Trust me.

455
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,230
Oh, you want me to log out right now and change it?

456
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,210
I can log out right now and change my Steam name.

457
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,290
Oh, wait.

458
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,110
Let me turn up the volume a bit more.

459
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,250
Whoa!

460
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,290
Oh shit, sorry!

461
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,030
Sorry.

462
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,790
No, no, don't.

463
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,510
I'm just looting.

464
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,250
Wait.

465
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,510
What did I do?

466
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,240
No, sorry.

467
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,960
We don't.

468
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,180
We're collecting trash as well right now.

469
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,940
To find food.

470
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,420
Wait.

471
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,840
Okay, over here.

472
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,400
Yeah, I'm gonna...

473
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,260
I just realized I can't break the box.

474
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,820
What's going on?

475
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,300
Oh, don't tell me I DC'd again.

476
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,360
Oh, don't tell me I DC'd again.

477
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,240
Get ready, guys.

478
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,900
Okay.

479
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,860
Alright, don't worry.

480
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,740
I'll get kicked out soon.

481
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,920
What?

482
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,980
It still says I'm connected.

483
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,620
While the server fixes itself...

484
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,600
Oh, I'm gonna fix the volume.

485
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,360
I'll fix myself too.

486
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,020
Oh shit!

487
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,840
Wait, what happened?

488
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,740
Oh, I'm out.

489
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,420
I think there's something up with the server.

490
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,100
I don't think I've had issues...

491
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,180
That many issues before.

492
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,160
I don't think I got that.

493
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,330
Is anyone else DCing too?

494
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,390
Or is it just me?

495
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,310
I don't know.

496
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,310
I don't know what to do.

497
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,290
Oh, Gumi did as well?

498
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,970
Oh, it's not me.

499
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,890
I think it's the server.

500
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,370
I know that.

501
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,670
Yeah, thank God.

502
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,830
I'm not the problem.

503
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,350
Thankfully, I'm not the problem.

504
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,190
Yeah!

505
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,110
Hello?

506
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,810
Hello?

507
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,130
Yeah, did you guys all DC too?

508
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,670
I DCed earlier as well.

510
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,810
I think the server is just weird today.

511
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,510
It's just technical difficulties.

512
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,030
Alright, back to farming.

513
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,320
Alright.

514
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,260
No, we don't.

515
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,540
We're sadly...

516
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,080
We got food from the garbage man.

517
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,520
You might be able to find him.

518
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,160
He's out there.

519
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,260
Yeah.

520
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,580
Go over that way, and then you'll find the garbage man.

521
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,820
He's out there giving people garbage.

522
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,080
What happened to be food?

523
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,940
Yeah, he gave me a tuna can.

524
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,000
It was moldy, but it was pretty good tuna.

525
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, you're gonna die?

526
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,480
Wait, if you're dying, can I get XP?

527
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,380
Can I get XP if you're gonna die?

528
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,700
Can I get XP?

529
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,600
You're gonna die anyway, right?

530
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,500
Nice.

531
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,000
XP.

532
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,970
Yeah, are you gonna die?

533
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,770
Are you gonna...

534
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,970
You're not starving, right?

535
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,930
What's your starve meter?

536
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,670
Do you want to join your friend?

537
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,290
You don't care about her?

538
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,250
You don't care about your friend?

539
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,730
Oh, we're your friends now?

540
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,130
Oh, so you don't care about her.

541
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:45,590
Oh!

542
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,990
So you're...

543
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,770
Oh, you don't even...

544
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,870
You're not a real friend!

545
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,160
You're not a real friend!

546
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,690
You're not real!

547
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,090
You're not real!

548
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,770
You're not loyal!

549
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,970
Alright, nice.

550
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,430
Let's go.

551
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,550
You would never...

552
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,030
Yeah, of course.

553
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,730
I would die fighting for you.

554
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,450
Just for you.

555
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,630
Nice.

556
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,530
Hey, I got XP.

557
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,910
Wait, Gumi, do you get XP from Rust?

558
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,540
Oh yeah, we can eat her!

559
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,480
We can eat her!

560
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,800
Nice.

561
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,840
Oh, we should've fed her to her friend!

562
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,180
We should've fed her...

563
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,000
We could've been like, hey, you're hungry.

564
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,620
We can't...

565
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,500
It was a total waste.

566
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,320
We got food.

567
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,460
Oh!

568
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,400
We can barbecue at the beach!

569
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,600
Oh my god, we can cook right now.

570
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,380
Let's cook her meat.

571
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,900
Wait, I have meat too!

572
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,600
I have fingers!

573
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,090
Alright.

574
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,450
Let me put my finger in here too.

575
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,880
Maybe we'll just be cannibals.

576
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,160
It's not that bad.

577
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,840
Wait, I just realized we weren't supposed to kill people.

578
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,680
Well, I just realized...

579
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,080
Oh no, now I'm a bandit.

580
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,980
I'm a bandit now.

581
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,220
No!

582
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,600
No!

583
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,880
No!

584
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,040
No!

585
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,020
I can't believe it!

586
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,020
Okay, I'm coming back.

587
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,880
I can't believe...

588
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,120
Are you serious?

589
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,820
Alright, where was I?

590
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,640
Where did I die?

591
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,440
Oh my god!

592
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Alright.

593
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,660
Let's go.

594
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,840
Off we go.

595
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,820
It's fine.

596
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,560
No, I'm still a bandit.

597
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,580
No!

598
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,160
My barbecue!

599
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,800
Oh my god.

600
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,460
Oh my god.

601
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,640
I can't believe...

602
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,860
A bear of all things?

603
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,160
Oh my god.

604
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,940
What's that over there?

605
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,580
Wait.

606
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,680
Hello.

607
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,320
Oh no, no, no.

608
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,880
It was a bear.

609
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,300
It was a bear.

610
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,320
I was trying to fight a bear.

611
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,380
And then, like, my partner...

612
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,020
Was beside me and I suddenly hit her.

613
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,860
And so the bear and I lost everything.

614
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
I am nothing now.

615
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,200
I swear, I'm not evil.

616
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,640
I'm not an evil man.

617
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,820
It was all the bear's fault.

618
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,540
Are you sure about that?

619
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Yes, I'm sure.

620
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
This is all I have.

621
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,920
If I was an evil man, why would I be naked?

622
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,600
Actually, no, that makes more sense.

623
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,820
But if I was an evil man...

624
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,820
If I was really evil, would I be ginger?

625
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,200
Okay, no, that's not helping.

626
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,920
Okay, wait.

627
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,500
Yeah, okay.

628
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,120
If I was an evil man...

629
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,780
Why would I let you live?

630
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,460
Exactly.

631
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,280
Oh my god.

632
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,800
Thank you.

633
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,840
I really appreciate it.

634
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,020
I have a very long pilgrimage back to where I died.

635
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
It's like...

636
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,320
Yeah, I'll see...

637
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,760
I died back at like...

638
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,440
K7.

639
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,200
I had to go back.

640
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,220
We were having...

641
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,600
We were having a little barbecue session.

642
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,740
Of like the animals we killed.

643
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,620
And then a bear showed up out of nowhere.

644
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,140
It was like...

645
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,680
Was that the bear cartoon?

646
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,940
Where we were at the picnic?

647
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,800
It's just like that.

648
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,540
Oh, wait.

649
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Were you talking when you had your map open?

650
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,380
Yeah.

651
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,900
Oh!

652
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,800
I died at K7.

653
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,160
I died at K7.

654
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,320
Wait, wait.

655
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,060
That's a while away.

656
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
Yeah, I'll see you later.

657
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,580
Thank you for the ore.

658
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,700
I really appreciate it.

659
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,660
Just remember, I'm not evil.

660
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,080
I might be ginger, but I'm not evil.

661
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,700
I swear.

662
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,400
Good luck with the rest of your travels.

663
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,180
Alright.

664
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,760
Off we go.

665
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,760
Off we go.

666
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Gumi lived?

667
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Of course I didn't see the chat.

668
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,020
I was having a fucking conversation.

669
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,240
Also, I hope the volume is okay.

670
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,460
I got a message.

671
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,000
Is this from Sound Guy?

672
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,720
Um, alright.

673
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,640
It was.

674
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay.

675
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,240
I hope the sound was better.

676
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,140
She killed the bear?!

677
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,680
Alright, off we go.

678
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,460
Off we go.

679
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,410
Look, I...

680
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,410
I got ganked!

681
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,490
Out of...

682
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,070
How was I supposed to live?

683
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:04,990
How the fuck was I supposed to be alive?

684
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,850
I literally got shot first!

685
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,810
I got hit first!

686
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,210
Oh my god, this is so far.

687
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,990
This is the pilgrimage of death.

688
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,110
I got ganked from the jungle.

689
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,470
Oh my god, it's like deadlock all over again.

690
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,150
The fucking Vindicta jumped up in the air and fucking shot me.

691
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,290
There's another bear.

692
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,690
No, please.

693
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,350
Oh my god, oh my god!

694
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:41,970
Got

695
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,680
me!

696
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,140
No!

697
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,140
The bear got the gun!

698
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,420
Please be a closer respawn.

699
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,300
Where am I?

700
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh my god.

701
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,620
Back to the pilgrimage.

702
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh my god.

703
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,040
Back to the pilgrimage.

704
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,020
Oh my god.

705
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,640
Oh my god.

706
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,300
Why is it so far?

707
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,680
Do not...

708
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,820
Oh my god, ever since I killed that one... Oh, it's cause I'm abandoned!

709
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,340
No!

710
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,220
I'm abandoned!

711
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,340
That's why!

712
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,660
I just remember why.

713
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,880
Oh my god.

714
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
It's cause I'm...

715
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,400
I'm marked.

716
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,460
I'm marked for dead.

717
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,520
Oh my god.

718
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,320
I'm re-rolling.

719
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,900
I'm re-rolling.

720
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,340
Off do I go.

721
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,940
I just wanted...

722
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,860
We were hungry.

723
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,400
We were starving.

724
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,660
I just wanted...

725
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,280
I just...

726
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,020
We just needed food.

727
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,640
She was gonna die anyway!

728
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,800
She was gonna die!

729
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,380
What was I supposed to do?

730
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,980
It was literally free food.

731
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,980
It was... Oh my god, it's so dark.

732
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,140
It was literally free food.

733
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,580
Free real estate.

734
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,900
Oh yeah, I should... I don't wanna wait.

735
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,340
I don't wanna... Alright, here we go.

736
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,140
Just so I can at least see it.

737
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,500
The...

738
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,220
Oh my god.

739
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,080
Just so I can see the big, great pilgrimage of 2024.

740
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,200
Maybe I could steal somebody's horse.

741
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,220
Maybe... Maybe there would be a horse nearby.

742
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:41,860
Woah!

743
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,880
Woah!

744
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,820
Watch out, my lord!

745
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,300
Woah!

746
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,040
Okay, there's like...

747
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,280
There's shots over there.

748
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,360
Woah, spawn more at night?

749
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,220
Don't say that.

750
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,500
Don't say that.

751
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,960
I am like...

752
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,340
30 squares away.

753
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,700
I'm 30 squares away.

754
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Don't say that.

755
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,480
Oh my god, there's the church.

756
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Maybe they'll have shelter for me.

757
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,940
Maybe the church people will take me in for the night.

758
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,120
Wait.

759
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,720
Maybe...

760
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,120
Oh my god.

761
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,660
I'm a good person.

762
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,460
It was self-defense.

763
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,060
Oh my god.

764
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,080
No, it's the church.

765
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,140
This is the official Blood God church.

766
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,100
It's very sacred and safe.

767
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,640
Oh my god.

768
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,980
Maybe they'll house me for the night.

769
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,330
Oh my god.

770
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,540
Woah.

771
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,900
Oh my god.

772
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,700
Oh my god.

773
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,780
Okay.

774
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,060
Wait.

775
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,720
Alright.

776
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh.

777
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,780
Alright, let's just...

778
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,980
Guys, I'm poor and I don't want to get scalped.

779
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,300
Guys.

780
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,540
I...

781
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,160
I don't want to get scalped.

782
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,280
I don't want to get scalped.

783
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,040
I don't want to get scalped, guys.

784
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,740
Anyway, moving along.

785
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,820
Moving along.

786
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,540
Let's head back to our pilgrimage.

787
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,820
I am...

788
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,280
I was at the church.

789
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,080
And I got...

790
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:45,280
But now, I'm leaving because I heard they scalp...

791
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,020
scalp the poor.

792
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Woah!

793
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,540
Oh god, oh god.

794
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,240
I'm coming over.

795
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm coming over.

796
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,780
That's Rust Kingdom's one doki.

797
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,380
This is Rust Kingdom's two doki.

798
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,960
Hahaha.

799
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,500
Rust Kingdom two doki is different.

800
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,060
I don't know, guys.

801
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,510
Rust Kingdom one...

802
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,680
Rust... Woah!

803
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,040
Rust Kingdom two doki is very poor right now.

804
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,520
Please, I need to go back.

805
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,540
I need to go back.

806
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,220
I didn't realize back then, the blood god was so much nicer.

807
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,800
I didn't get scalped.

808
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,020
The blood god back then didn't scalp me.

809
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,300
No, no.

810
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,620
I wasn't part of the cult.

811
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,580
That was different.

812
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,640
Different.

813
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,380
That was...

814
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,720
Back then, the...

815
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,220
Back then, the blood god cult was more refined.

816
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,500
They, like...

817
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Their practices were really, like, um, flowed with me.

818
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,480
Like, what they were preaching and everything.

819
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,320
They knew what they were preaching.

820
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,780
Now, it's just so commercialized.

821
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:19,080
Now, the blood god cult just feels so commercialized and, like, they just fell into capitalism and all that.

822
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,500
That just ain't for me.

823
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,520
What happened to the more humble times?

824
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,680
Humble blood god ways?

825
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,940
They ain't chill like that anymore.

826
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,220
It's just different.

827
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,500
It's just not the same.

828
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,420
It's just not the same.

829
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,980
They sold out.

830
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,840
They sold out.

831
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,460
Yeah, the blood gods sold out.

832
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,740
Yeah, the old grass root blood gods.

833
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,140
Where was Rust Kingdom's one blood god?

834
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,880
The humble blood god.

835
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,200
Alright.

836
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,100
Let's see.

837
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,860
Where was...

838
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,900
Okay, I'm almost there.

839
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,540
Oh my god.

840
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,620
I saw... That's the coliseum again.

841
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
There it is.

842
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,800
There it is.

843
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,300
Oh no.

844
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:16,900
No!

845
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,380
No!

846
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,080
I...

847
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,120
I'll never make it back.

848
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,600
I'll actually never...

849
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,300
I'll never make it back.

850
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,180
I'll actually never make it back.

851
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,480
I don't...

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,580
I give up.

853
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,460
She's gotta come to me.

854
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,300
I give up.

855
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,300
I...

856
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,840
I...

857
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,760
I'm encountering all the bears.

858
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,300
I don't

859
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,170
understand.

860
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,170
How is it...

861
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,230
Where is the fucking...

862
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,690
Where am I?

863
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,670
Gumi.

864
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:14,150
I died to a bear three times.

865
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:24,790
Every time I get close to you a bear a bear shows up.

866
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,170
Every time I get close!

867
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,310
I can't.

868
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,450
I can't.

869
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,530
I can't do this again.

870
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,790
I can't.

871
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,790
Come to me.

872
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,710
I can't do this anymore.

873
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,430
I can't.

874
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,390
I can't.

875
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,570
I can't.

876
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,870
I can't keep traveling in that area.

877
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,570
I can't.

878
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,110
Oh no.

879
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,710
Oh my god.

880
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,350
Please.

881
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,650
You got this.

882
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,410
I can't.

883
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,290
How did I...

884
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,230
Do I fucking keep finding bears?

885
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,030
Every time.

886
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,350
I'll never make it.

887
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,650
I'll never make it.

888
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,710
Maybe I should ask for an escort from the blood gods.

889
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,190
Maybe.

890
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,490
Maybe.

891
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,910
Maybe I'll just ask for a fucking escort.

892
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,890
It's a sign to join the blood gods again.

893
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,250
Oh my god.

894
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,910
I'll never be able to make it back home.

895
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:47,990
I'll never.

896
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,650
I'll never make it back.

897
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,120
Oh my god.

898
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:03,930
Please.

899
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,470
Oh my god.

900
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,070
There's the church again.

901
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,930
There it is.

902
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,690
Hello, kind dude.

903
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,470
I heard you guys helped the needy.

904
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,410
Can you please escort me to my friend?

905
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,970
Can you please?

906
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,990
I've been fucking ganked by three different bears.

907
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,010
Three different bears.

908
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,630
How many bears out there?

909
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,770
Oh my god.

910
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:46,990
This is because I would enjoy because I killed that one person accidentally out of self-defense.

911
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,730
It's just because, just because I was just putting her out of her, she was gonna die anyway.

912
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,690
It was a mercy killing.

913
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,490
She was literally gonna die anyway.

914
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,110
Like there was no food.

915
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:05,610
It was terminal.

916
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,710
I just put her out of her misery.

917
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,910
She was gonna starve.

918
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,000
It was a mercy killing.

919
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,720
Oh my god.

920
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,440
Oh my god.

921
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,480
This time.

922
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,300
Oh my god, that's a deer.

923
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,100
Oh my god, I swear to god.

924
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,180
That was another fucking bear.

925
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,780
This entire...

926
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,480
I've just been trying to head to this one area.

927
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,180
What the fuck?

928
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,580
Now there's a sermon?

929
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,900
I don't have any scrap.

930
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,360
Scrap?

931
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,180
The fuck?

932
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,760
What?

933
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,800
Fuck this.

934
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,540
I don't fuck with sacrifices, man.

935
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,140
Alright, anyway.

936
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,960
Let's get back to our journey.

937
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,340
That was a nice detour.

938
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,400
That was...

939
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,240
That was a nice detour that we saw there.

940
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,080
We gotta go.

941
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,440
We gotta go.

942
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,800
We gotta go back on our journey.

943
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,440
Back to...

944
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,160
Okay, there we go.

945
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,200
We have to leave.

946
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,380
It was a nice little...

947
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,520
It was like those in-game cutscenes.

948
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,220
That you just happen to walk into.

949
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,620
Like...

950
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,800
Like those real-time...

951
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,340
Real-time cutscenes.

952
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,580
Gumi, are you still...

953
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,760
Gumi, are you still in the same...

954
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,640
In the...

955
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,400
In the same place?

956
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,700
The Resident Evil...

957
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,220
You know, like when you're in an MMO.

958
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,620
And then you just happen upon, like...

959
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,440
Not just an MMO.

960
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,600
An RPG game.

961
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,700
And you just happen to walk across an event.

962
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,540
You just walked across to an in-game event.

963
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,320
And you just...

964
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,500
Watch it happen.

965
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,280
I can't believe she's still there.

966
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,480
She's actually...

967
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,600
Yeah, the chance encounter.

968
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,880
Okay, we gotta avoid this spot.

969
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,120
That's where the bears are.

970
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,980
No, don't say that!

971
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,880
I can't keep doing this!

972
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,680
I cannot do Groundhog Day!

973
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,260
I cannot!

974
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,440
I cannot keep doing...

975
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,660
I cannot keep dying!

976
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,620
To this fucking bear!

977
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,260
Everywhere I go...

978
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,260
Everywhere I go...

979
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,220
This bear is out to get...

980
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,400
It's like a canon event.

981
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,560
I eventually have to die to this bear.

982
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,600
Please, not the bear.

983
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,920
Anything but the bear.

984
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,860
Oh my god, we're back.

985
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,800
We're almost there.

986
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,280
All the paths will eventually lead you to the bear.

987
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,400
Every path I take.

988
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,280
No matter where I go.

989
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,660
It's a canon event that I have to die to.

990
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,980
To this god forsaken fucking bear.

991
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,820
Oh, there he is!

992
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,180
Oh, there he is!

993
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,180
But I'm going on the mountain now.

994
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,040
That's fucking right!

995
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,620
You can't get me, you fucking bear.

996
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,500
I see you.

997
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,380
I fucking see you.

998
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,840
I got the mountain on my side this time.

999
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,520
I'd rather get cold...

1000
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,120
Than fucking die to a bear.

1001
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,640
The only way to beat this cycle...

1002
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,120
Is to die to a bear.

1003
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,660
Please, I need to get my stuff back.

1004
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,580
I can hold alt to look around.

1005
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,420
Oh, thank god.

1006
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,080
As long as I'm on the mountain...

1007
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,420
I won't get attacked.

1008
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,120
Don't say that!

1009
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,560
Don't say that!

1010
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,000
It's not a bear, so we're safe.

1011
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,160
Also, I hope the sound's been okay so far.

1012
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,560
Oh, someone already built a house.

1013
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,180
I swear, I spent more of my time trying to find my way back home.

1014
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,800
Trying to find my way back to this one area.

1015
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,380
Mountain bears.

1016
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,340
Don't say that.

1017
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,540
I'm done.

1018
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,300
I'm so done with these bears.

1019
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,660
I'm so fucking done.

1020
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,580
Also, can my mods pin messages?

1021
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,020
Maybe we should pin the drop on the top of the chat.

1022
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,260
So it's more convenient.

1023
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,120
For people to see.

1024
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,380
So many...

1025
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,400
So many bears.

1026
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,340
Ever since I killed that one person.

1027
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,000
Ever since I mercy killed that person too.

1028
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,900
It was literally a mercy kill.

1029
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,780
Alright.

1030
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,540
I'm heading over.

1031
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,480
I'm heading over.

1032
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,480
We're almost there.

1033
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,020
We're almost there.

1034
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,000
We're almost here.

1035
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,500
That one person...

1036
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,160
Garnet.

1037
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,560
It's like when you...

1038
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,000
It's like when you...

1039
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,120
You made fun of the witch for being ugly.

1040
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,420
And then the witch puts a curse on you.

1041
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,060
And then my curse...

1042
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,560
Oh my...

1043
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,760
Okay, cool.

1044
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,580
I guess I'll starve as well.

1045
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,620
The witch...

1046
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,580
I'm like the beast.

1047
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,100
The witch puts a curse on me.

1048
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,480
And the curse is that I'll always die to a bear.

1049
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,540
That's my curse.

1050
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,360
No, please.

1051
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,520
No, please.

1052
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,300
I'm almost there.

1053
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,400
I'm literally almost back.

1054
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,880
It's right there.

1055
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,540
Here it is.

1056
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,780
Oh, come on.

1057
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,620
I did.

1058
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,540
I didn't, but like...

1059
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,900
Just for the sake of it.

1060
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,820
Did you get his body?

1061
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,260
Oh my god, wait.

1062
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:39,620
Wait.

1063
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,120
No, please.

1064
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,140
No, I'm not a bandit.

1065
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:48,940
I swear to god, please.

1066
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,160
Please, I'm not.

1067
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,100
I swear to god.

1068
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,220
I swear to god.

1069
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,540
I don't...

1070
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,740
I swear to god.

1071
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,760
No, it wasn't me.

1072
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,640
It wasn't me.

1073
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,640
Oh my god.

1074
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,200
Are we going?

1075
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,300
I hope so.

1076
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,320
I'm trying to find...

1077
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,240
I'm trying to find a particular group.

1078
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,720
No!

1079
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,120
Gobi!

1080
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,740
Oh!

1081
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,320
Oh my god.

1082
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,540
Oh my god.

1083
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,440
Yeah, yeah, we're trying to find our friends.

1084
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,060
No, he's with me.

1085
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,060
He's with me.

1086
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:38,900
He's with me.

1087
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,660
He saved my life before.

1088
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,060
From the bandit hunters.

1089
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,360
He's a good man.

1090
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,400
There was a bandit.

1091
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,460
Yeah.

1092
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,820
Yes.

1093
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,460
I got touched by a bear four times.

1094
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,220
And I lived.

1095
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,960
Well, sort of.

1096
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,100
But I'm okay now.

1097
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,200
Wait.

1098
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,060
Wait,

1099
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,640
I'm a little dehydrated.

1100
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,300
Does anyone have water?

1101
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,640
I went on a long 20 day pilgrimage.

1102
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,060
Oh, okay.

1103
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,920
I got better.

1104
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,100
Kissed by the claws of the bear.

1105
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,640
Okay.

1106
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,060
I gotta go get some water.

1107
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1108
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,260
Oh my god.

1109
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,700
What were the chances?

1110
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,140
If you see any bandits, tell us.

1111
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,100
And I'm like, oh, I'm leaving.

1112
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,280
What were the odds of that?

1113
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,480
What were the odds of that fucking happening to me?

1114
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,200
Oh my god.

1115
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,540
Okay, there we go.

1116
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,620
There we go.

1117
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,160
Oh, thank god.

1118
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,940
I'm okay.

1119
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,700
I'm okay now.

1120
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,620
Alright.

1121
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,520
I gotta go back to the lands.

1122
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:16,620
Oh.

1123
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,120
Does it sound better now?

1124
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,200
I keep asking it because I keep forgetting to check what you guys say.

1125
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,880
Perfect timing.

1126
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,300
Alright.

1127
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,440
Where was the...

1128
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,620
Where were the rest of them?

1129
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,820
Wait, where were they?

1130
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,720
Oh my god, I already got lost.

1131
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,980
Where did they go?

1132
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,740
I don't even remember.

1133
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,120
Oh, there they are.

1134
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,160
Hello.

1135
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,400
Hello.

1136
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,140
I'm back.

1137
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,020
I'm not so sure.

1138
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,820
No, no, no.

1139
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,580
I'm good, I'm good.

1140
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,540
I'm good.

1141
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:55,900
I'm good.

1142
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,560
I had to defend myself from other bandits.

1143
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,560
But I won.

1144
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,240
If boss gives me the green light, I won't do anything.

1145
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,400
Pick these up.

1146
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,860
Aim at this rock over here.

1147
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,160
Aim at this rock, okay.

1148
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:39,330
Alright.

1149
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,590
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,150
Wait, how do I use the bow?

1151
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,570
Guys, how do I use...

1152
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,650
Someone's arrow went into the ground.

1153
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,130
Not me.

1154
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,930
Guys, I don't know how to use the bow, guys.

1155
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,510
Blow, blow, please.

1156
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:06,870
Wait, I heard of a Sturbingo.

1157
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,650
Where is he?

1158
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,790
I have acquired a club.

1159
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:10,770
He has extra arrows.

1160
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:16,690
Guys, I've never ridden a bow before.

1161
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,530
Do you have an extra arrow?

1162
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:21,790
Yeah.

1163
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,330
Oh, shit!

1164
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:26,950
Oh, nice, thanks.

1165
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,910
Thank God you're a bad shot.

1166
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:31,090
Thank God.

1167
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,270
Oh, there we go.

1168
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,350
We did it.

1169
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:48,890
I need food.

1170
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,110
Guys, I don't want to get bad.

1171
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,490
Where's Goomy?

1172
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:57,930
Oh, there she is.

1173
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,310
Do you have extra food, Goomy?

1174
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,110
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1175
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,530
Wait, who are these?

1176
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:19,250
Is that fire?

1177
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,670
I will take the shot.

1178
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,890
I will take the shot.

1179
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,670
Oh, we almost got ran over.

1180
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,490
The no one tribe.

1181
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,850
We just woke up in the middle of the cold.

1182
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,910
And we're trying to find clothing and food and water.

1183
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,850
I was trying to escape my life.

1184
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,610
You know, the cops got me fucked up, okay?

1185
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,390
And this, I just had nothing.

1186
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,570
No skin on my back, nothing.

1187
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,250
The cops?

1188
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,790
Why were the cops after you?

1189
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,410
We will clothe you and feed you, as is the way.

1190
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:05,870
Why were the cops?

1191
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,950
Don't worry about why the cops are after us.

1192
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,310
Rider!

1193
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,570
Rider on the road!

1194
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:17,470
Oh, shit!

1195
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,150
What the fuck?

1196
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,130
Is the server lagging?

1197
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,330
Is the server lagging?

1198
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,090
OOC, sometimes I don't know what other lines to say.

1199
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,510
I have a few that I learned from...

1200
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,370
OOC!

1201
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,630
I guess we follow him.

1202
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,110
Are you guys...

1203
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,110
Are you guys in the same boat I am?

1204
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,250
Yeah, we're teleporting around.

1205
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:58,730
Sometimes we're OOC.

1206
00:57:58,730 --> 00:57:59,770
Are you guys in the same boat I am?

1207
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,770
I don't know what's going on.

1208
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,170
I guess we just follow him.

1209
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,030
I guess we just follow him.

1210
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,530
Are you guys in the same boat I am?

1211
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,550
Break the barrels and farm the resources along the road.

1212
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,190
Break the barrels and farm the resources along the road.

1213
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,450
Then when you have enough, do you see that rock in the distance?

1214
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,330
That is the Cold Stone Fortress.

1215
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,710
Meet us there when you have clothing.

1216
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,530
Rangers with me.

1217
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,050
Oh, well I've been going around naked.

1218
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,550
I'm making you clothing right now.

1219
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,010
I'm making you clothing right now, man.

1220
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,530
Thank you.

1221
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,650
Just like back in Rust Kingdoms 1, I don't have to try.

1222
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,770
He wants to be a seamstress.

1223
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,460
I think?

1224
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,320
Yeah, you think?

1225
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,940
What even is our goal anymore?

1226
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,220
Oh, I saw him.

1227
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,860
I saw a sermon.

1228
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:32,260
Well, I was gonna ask for assistance at the church because I was like, I'm poor.

1229
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,360
I need assistance.

1230
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,920
I need shelter from the cold night.

1231
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,480
And then as I was going to approach the church, they were talking about how they were going to scalp the poor.

1232
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,980
And then I was like, wait, I'm the poor.

1233
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:50,510
So, I walked away.

1234
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:55,990
Join us, we lurklings, for we do not kneel and we bow to no king.

1235
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,310
We bow to no god.

1236
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:00,350
We acknowledge the old gods, but that's about it.

1237
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,970
Who are the old gods?

1238
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,690
Yeah, who are the old gods?

1239
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:15,430
Oh, I thought I already wore shoes.

1240
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,650
Yeah, I'm already wearing shoes.

1241
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,110
Oh, we're just close acquaintances.

1242
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,870
We're just work friends.

1243
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,090
That's not true.

1244
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,070
We're just co-workers.

1245
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,470
Oh, my bad.

1246
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,150
No, it's alright.

1247
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,350
It's okay.

1248
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,410
Oh, okay, yeah.

1249
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,950
Oh, my god!

1250
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,710
It's Sir Adam!

1251
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,570
Sir Adam!

1252
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:54,810
Brave warriors, I come back with loot and many stories and tales.

1253
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,370
What kind of stories?

1254
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,030
Lord Bingle!

1255
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,050
Lord Bingle!

1256
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:01,810
What is this?

1257
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,970
What kind of stories, Lord Bingle?

1258
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,370
Why do you kneel?

1259
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:10,550
We do not kneel!

1260
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,230
Okay, we do not kneel.

1261
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:12,650
I'm sorry.

1262
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,490
I'm showing respect to our fellow queens.

1263
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:14,930
I'm sorry.

1264
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:16,490
I'm an ally.

1265
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,050
I'm like you, misogynistic freaks.

1266
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,670
Oh!

1267
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,270
Oh, my bad!

1268
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:24,010
Oh, my bad!

1269
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,770
What's going on, y'all?

1270
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,310
Why do your name be Red?

1271
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,930
Yeah, why is your name Red?

1272
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,910
I think it's the faulty brakes.

1273
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,210
Faulty brakes.

1274
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,410
Travelers with me!

1275
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:37,610
That's all, y'all.

1276
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:41,830
Very interesting.

1277
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,310
Sir Adam, is it safe to come out?

1278
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:47,970
Wait, who is this guy, Sir Adam?

1279
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,130
Who is he?

1280
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:51,290
Put your hands up!

1281
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,050
I have a gun!

1282
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,550
I have a gun!

1283
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,870
I'll shoot right now!

1284
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,010
Okay, we'll leave!

1285
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,430
Drop your clothes!

1286
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,570
You can't aim for shit!

1287
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,250
Drop your clothes right now!

1288
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,470
Take the shot!

1289
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,130
I dare you!

1290
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,970
Take the shot right now!

1291
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,550
He's gone.

1292
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,030
They're gone.

1293
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,150
They were too scared to take the shot.

1294
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,610
Yeah, they didn't even take the shot!

1295
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,210
Fucking cowards!

1296
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,910
Not even real!

1297
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,010
Where did Sir Elim go?

1298
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:33,630
We do not have a kingdom!

1299
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,670
We do not have a king!

1300
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:36,890
We are free people!

1301
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:37,330
Come!

1302
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,170
Wait, Sir Elim's gone.

1303
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:49,530
A new soul has entered the blood cauldron.

1304
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,650
The Coldstone Fortress?

1305
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:07,550
Oh my god.

1306
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,490
Oh my god.

1307
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,390
Can't wait to see the Coldstone Fortress.

1308
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,970
Will I ever get an AK that uses my own skin?

1309
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,430
We'll find out.

1310
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,350
Imagine we played Rust and we never even get our own...

1311
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,430
We never even get an AK!

1312
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,190
I'll never... I don't think it'll happen.

1313
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:32,810
First...

1314
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,450
If you'll enter our home...

1315
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,670
You must first pledge allegiance...

1316
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,370
to the Old Gods.

1317
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,570
Cast out all other beliefs.

1318
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,850
Who are the Old Gods, Sir?

1319
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,510
Thank you.

1320
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,290
Odin.

1321
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,450
The gates of Valhalla will only open...

1322
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,090
if you worship Odin.

1323
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,550
Have you ever died...

1324
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:57,630
and felt like you could just come back to life?

1325
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,090
Have you ever wondered...

1326
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,630
I've always dreamed of that.

1327
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:03,450
It's not the Old God, but...

1328
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,750
It is not the Blood God.

1329
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,830
It is the Old God that gives you that power.

1330
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,410
Does he really?

1331
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,430
It is the Old God.

1332
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,070
The Old Faith.

1333
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,550
Guys, Valhalla!

1334
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,570
I have done that about seven times.

1335
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,610
I was wondering about that.

1336
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,170
I can be naked in the permafrost...

1337
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,070
and nothing can harm me.

1338
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,670
Let him go.

1339
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,110
The power of the Old Gods...

1340
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:29,890
are protecting him!

1341
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,230
Is this a different cult?

1342
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,270
Did the Old Gods build this?

1343
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,310
Was this built by the Old Gods as well?

1344
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,830
How did they do this?

1345
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,570
This rock has been passed down...

1346
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:56,310
many generations.

1347
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,210
We've lived here for millennia.

1348
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,270
If you have a bow with me...

1349
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,650
I need you to arrange you...

1350
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,030
naked one.

1351
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,010
I have dung.

1352
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,870
No, I have clothes on.

1353
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,530
That's not me.

1354
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:11,250
You will gather wood for me.

1355
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,470
I have a rock.

1356
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:18,890
Am I to invite them...

1357
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:19,810
to our house?

1358
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:25,390
I need to make sure they can provide for us first.

1359
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,410
I need to make sure this group of rangers...

1360
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,570
is willing to kill when necessary.

1361
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,390
I am.

1362
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:35,310
Yes, sir!

1363
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,490
Are we going to kill?

1364
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:55,030
Wait, is that Sir Alan?

1365
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,450
Archers!

1366
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,390
They are procuring the rock!

1367
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,970
They are trying to claim the rock!

1368
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:15,310
They stepped foot on my rock!

1369
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:18,850
Get off my sacred rock!

1370
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,370
Get off the great rock!

1371
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,490
Get off my sacred rock!

1372
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:26,970
Where did they go?

1373
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,870
Where did those savages go?

1374
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,110
We surrender!

1375
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,090
Sir Blau!

1376
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,890
They surrendered!

1377
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,470
Step off my rock!

1378
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,670
Wait, wait, wait!

1379
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,690
I helped you out, man!

1380
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,490
This man...

1381
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,190
defended me from the bandits earlier.

1382
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:48,250
Wait, but they threatened us earlier too!

1383
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,050
That's right!

1384
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,130
Yes, this is true!

1385
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,310
I honor you...

1386
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,870
from the old world.

1387
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,770
You will take this...

1388
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,370
as a sign of our offering in peace.

1389
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:01,750
Hey, I appreciate that.

1390
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:04,170
Where you stand is the Coldstone Fortress.

1391
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,970
We are an ancient and old people.

1392
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,870
How many people are you guys over here?

1393
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:11,570
Help!

1394
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:12,710
There's a polar bear!

1395
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:13,230
Bear!

1396
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:13,690
Bear!

1397
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:15,330
Help!

1398
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,650
There are polar bears!

1399
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,810
Wait, I thought you guys were joking!

1400
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:26,110
Oh my god!

1401
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:26,690
Oh my god!

1402
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:28,490
Do bears exist too?

1403
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,790
The bear got you!

1404
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,210
Oh!

1405
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,290
Betrayers!

1406
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,330
No!

1407
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:39,630
I fucking knew it!

1408
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,910
I should have taken the shot!

1409
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,370
I should have taken the shot!

1410
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,030
I fucking...

1411
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,510
I knew it!

1412
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,690
I knew I should have taken the shot!

1413
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:54,850
I'm fucking going back to the pilgrim.

1414
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,990
I should have killed them.

1415
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,410
The bear curse!

1416
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,830
The bear curse!

1417
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,670
They fucking struck again!

1418
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,970
The bear curse was real!

1419
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:13,270
I knew I should have taken the shot!

1420
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,730
I got Bucky hitting the head in the back!

1421
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,210
That would not protect...

1422
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:22,050
Oh my god!

1423
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,070
The fucking snow bears were real!

1424
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,530
I fucking knew they were real!

1425
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,550
I can't believe it!

1426
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:33,910
I can't believe they were real all along!

1427
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:38,650
I can't believe they were real!

1428
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,490
Not again!

1429
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,090
Oh my god!

1430
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,250
I thought you guys were...

1431
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,530
I was like, there's no way they were polar bears!

1432
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,110
There's no way!

1433
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,710
There were!

1434
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:54,330
There were polar bears!

1435
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,610
It always leads to the bears!

1436
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,910
The polar bear...

1437
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:01,890
It was a sign!

1438
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,670
It was a sign!

1439
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:08,930
Oh my god, you see a bear...

1440
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,650
It's like when you see it in the old times.

1441
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,450
When you see...

1442
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,850
When you see a crow...

1443
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,970
It means you're gonna die soon.

1444
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,510
When I see a bear...

1445
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,710
I'm gonna die!

1446
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,510
Every path...

1447
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,010
Leads to the death...

1448
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,110
From a bear!

1449
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,830
Every single...

1450
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:33,830
I'll never escape!

1451
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,410
I'll never escape this fucking hell!

1452
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,710
This is my...

1453
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,510
Silent hill!

1454
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:42,390
My silent hill...

1455
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,650
Is I'll die to a fucking...

1456
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,750
Anything related to a bear!

1457
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,550
Ever since I accidentally...

1458
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,770
I mercy killed that one guy...

1459
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,390
I'm gonna go to the blood church...

1460
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,190
And ask for help.

1461
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:04,290
I'm gonna...

1462
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,390
Oh my god, I should've fucking...

1463
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:08,310
Got a spawn point!

1464
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,130
Oh!

1465
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:11,430
Oh!

1466
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:12,770
Hello!

1467
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:14,090
Hey!

1468
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,230
I've died to a bear five times.

1469
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,410
It's my way of life.

1470
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,510
Every time I see a bear...

1471
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:23,670
I knew death is coming.

1472
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,750
Oh yeah, corn, that would be great sir.

1473
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,790
Are you the corn man?

1474
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:30,670
Thank you for this...

1475
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,310
Corn, sir.

1476
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,270
How's life doing for you...

1477
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,050
In the wilds?

1478
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:38,970
It's pretty bad.

1479
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:41,090
I passed out.

1480
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,450
And then I woke up dead.

1481
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,690
Now I'm running back to my...

1482
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,150
Dead...

1483
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,090
Where I passed out.

1484
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,070
Dead and...

1485
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,450
Yeah.

1486
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,730
Hopefully my home's not gone.

1487
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,410
Wait, you don't live there?

1488
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,590
Actually I got killed by a boar.

1489
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,910
Oh you got killed by a boar, that sucks man.

1490
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,250
I just met this guy.

1491
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,130
Wait, is he friendly?

1492
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:04,330
Is he friendly?

1493
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,850
This guy's pretty cool.

1494
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,090
Are you still home dude?

1495
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:11,470
Sir?

1496
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,290
Young sire?

1497
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,890
Hermit in the woods?

1498
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,450
Maybe he passed out too.

1499
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:21,470
He might have.

1500
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,210
He's literally just here.

1501
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:25,470
Good luck in your journey to your body.

1502
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,390
Hope you get all your stuff.

1503
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,450
You too.

1504
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,970
Thanks, this would be my fifth bear death.

1505
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,270
But I hope so too.

1506
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:35,430
Oh my god.

1507
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,370
I'm gonna go to the church.

1508
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:40,490
I don't think I want to interact with a guy named Crazy.

1509
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,070
I don't want...

1510
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:48,130
I'm not gonna interact with a guy whose name is literally Crazy.

1511
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,440
Oh my god.

1512
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,820
Please, I need to...

1513
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,960
Maybe the church people would be nice.

1514
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:00,720
Maybe.

1515
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:00,800
Maybe.

1516
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,380
Hey, there's a casino.

1517
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,780
We'll gamble later.

1518
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,780
When we stop dying.

1519
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,120
I got betrayed.

1520
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,580
By those men.

1521
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,300
If I kept typing, I would have been dead.

1522
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,540
Holy fuck.

1523
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,820
If I kept typing, I would have died.

1524
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,360
I can't believe it.

1525
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,000
Here I go.

1526
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,980
Always the bears.

1527
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,360
Thank god I didn't.

1528
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,080
I keep typing.

1529
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,760
I looked to my left and I saw my lifeline.

1530
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,140
The bear woman.

1531
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,460
I lived.

1532
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,940
I lived.

1533
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,740
Oh my god.

1534
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,900
I actually lived.

1535
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,460
I request...

1536
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,340
I request shelter.

1537
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,180
Oh.

1538
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:11,880
What's that?

1539
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:13,980
What's that?

1540
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,100
Okay, no, that's just paranoia.

1541
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,320
You saw the bear and now you're scared.

1542
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:19,980
You're next.

1543
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,820
You saw the bear and now you're freaking out about every single thing you see now.

1544
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,680
You're just freaking out because you saw the bear.

1545
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,780
Oh, now they're not here?

1546
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,210
Is there nobody here?

1547
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,570
Oh my god.

1548
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:40,630
They just disappeared.

1549
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:43,490
There was an entire cult here and now they're gone?

1550
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,690
Oh, that's freaky.

1551
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,670
That's so freaky.

1552
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,450
The entire cult just...

1553
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:52,750
Disappeared.

1554
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,570
Did they...

1555
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,310
Was there a Kool-Aid scenario?

1556
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:56,910
What?

1557
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,270
Was it...

1558
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,770
Was it Kool-Aid?

1559
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:04,330
Don't drop your...

1560
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,710
What happened?

1561
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,450
They ascended.

1562
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,810
Oh my god.

1563
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,590
Oh, I see.

1564
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:31,110
I see.

1565
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:31,810
I agree.

1566
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:32,450
I concur.

1567
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,130
Did they all ascend?

1568
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,090
The rapture happened.

1569
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,010
The gates...

1570
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,730
The gates...

1571
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,070
I missed.

1572
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,150
Oh my god.

1573
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:47,250
The gates welcomed them.

1574
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:49,490
Okay, let's see.

1575
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:51,410
We gotta...

1576
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,750
Okay, we gotta go here.

1577
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,890
Holy shit.

1578
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,510
Can I...

1579
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,650
Can I get...

1580
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,370
I'm...

1581
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,450
I'm slowly...

1582
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:06,030
I'm slowly walking back.

1583
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:08,590
I'm so far.

1584
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,630
Back to the pilgrimage I go.

1585
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,270
I feel like...

1586
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:18,430
Why are they...

1587
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,810
Why did they set up camps so far away?

1588
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,770
What the fuck?

1589
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,350
Why did they set it up so...

1590
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,030
Oh my god.

1591
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:30,450
There's no spawn that's here.

1592
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:36,850
Keep an eye out for bears.

1593
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:38,490
How do I get hemp?

1594
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,990
What does hemp look like?

1595
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,930
What does it even look like?

1596
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,250
Oh, I don't wanna.

1597
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,230
I'm so scared.

1598
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,910
What if another bear comes over?

1599
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:50,690
I can't.

1600
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,490
I can't do this again.

1601
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,570
I can't.

1602
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:56,310
Oh my god.

1603
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:57,790
Oh, okay.

1604
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:58,950
I can't.

1605
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,890
I don't know if I can keep...

1606
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:01,230
I can't.

1607
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:02,670
I don't know, guys.

1608
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,250
What if...

1609
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,670
What if another...

1610
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:06,710
Wait.

1611
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,090
Desperate times...

1612
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,770
calls for desperate measures.

1613
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,330
Desperate times...

1614
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,630
calls for desperate measures.

1615
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:18,090
Oh my goodness.

1616
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:21,490
Oh, thank god.

1617
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:22,850
Okay, that's good.

1618
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:24,950
Guys...

1619
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:26,870
Guys, I need to put... I need...

1620
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:27,870
I need this shirt.

1621
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,050
Okay.

1622
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,070
No bears in sight.

1623
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,710
We're safe for now.

1624
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,130
Food is food!

1625
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,950
Guys, I have one corn left in my name!

1626
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,070
I have one...

1627
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:51,390
I have one corn left!

1628
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:53,910
Food is food!

1629
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:58,210
And corn is not cannibalism.

1630
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:02,010
It's not cannibalism if you don't think about it too hard.

1631
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:05,250
There's no way I'd encounter another bear.

1632
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,050
There's no fucking way.

1633
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,290
I lived the first...

1634
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:13,090
That was the very first bear encounter I ever...

1635
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,430
I ever survived from.

1636
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,210
So, like, I think...

1637
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,090
I think it's over.

1638
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:19,870
I think it's over.

1639
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:21,630
I think the curse is over.

1640
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,250
It's over.

1641
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,550
There's no way.

1642
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,710
There's no way.

1643
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,050
I literally...

1644
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:39,630
I literally survived my very first bear encounter.

1645
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:43,170
There's no way I could...

1646
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:51,270
Now I survived my second bear encounter.

1647
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:58,570
All I'm saying is I literally just survived my second bear encounter, chat.

1648
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,010
Yeah, there's a coliseum.

1649
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,030
Yeah.

1650
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,070
I'm gonna grab this.

1651
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:11,970
And now my third bear encounter.

1652
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:12,090
Third bear encounter.

1653
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,250
Now I survived...

1654
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:20,030
And now I survived my third bear encounter.

1655
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,070
Third time's the charm.

1656
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,310
Third time's the charm.

1657
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,090
It's fine.

1658
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:30,430
See, guys?

1659
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:31,730
The curse is broken.

1660
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:36,550
The curse is now officially broken, chat.

1661
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,230
I think we did it.

1662
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,270
I think we did it.

1663
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,230
There's no...

1664
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:45,950
There's no way.

1665
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:48,850
There's no more suffering.

1666
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:52,390
We broke the...

1667
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,350
We broke the curse.

1668
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:00,090
Can you survive the...

1669
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,530
Okay, yeah.

1670
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,050
You know what?

1671
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,090
I think I can, too.

1672
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,550
I think I can.

1673
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:07,730
I can't believe the church ascended.

1674
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,770
And I laughed at them.

1675
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:10,890
I didn't believe...

1676
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:12,550
Maybe...

1677
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,250
Who are the real gods?

1678
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,570
Is it the blood god?

1679
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,230
Or the old gods?

1680
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:23,190
But...

1681
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,010
The cult raptured.

1682
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,430
They raptured.

1683
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:28,530
I'm kidding.

1684
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,590
The blood god.

1685
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:39,280
Alright.

1686
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,640
I feel like I'm still...

1687
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,360
I feel like I'm like 20...

1688
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,500
20 miles away.

1689
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:54,500
Whoever protects me...

1690
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,340
Whoever protects me from the fucking...

1691
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,020
Whoever protects me from the...

1692
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,440
God forsaken...

1693
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,140
Bears will be my new god.

1694
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,780
They will be my new god.

1695
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,080
The moment I...

1696
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,320
Survive bear encounters.

1697
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,920
I will believe whatever you want me to believe.

1698
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,780
There's loot here.

1699
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:16,680
Oh, nice.

1700
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,220
Let's go!

1701
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,340
Oh my god.

1702
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,240
Let's go.

1703
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,980
I have armor now.

1704
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,120
Oh my god.

1705
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,140
I'm fucking stacked.

1706
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,240
It's over.

1707
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,120
Oh wait.

1708
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,420
You can't run with these.

1709
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,800
Now I can swim.

1710
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,660
I haven't met any wolves yet.

1711
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:41,860
Thank fucking god.

1712
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,300
They got the only thing I've encountered.

1713
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,040
Which is stupid...

1714
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:50,580
Fucking...

1715
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,220
Bears.

1716
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,720
Okay, nice.

1717
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,260
We got scrap.

1718
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,020
Oh, I got shorts.

1719
01:20:59,160 --> 01:20:59,520
Nice.

1720
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,720
What is this?

1721
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,020
Metal blade.

1722
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,080
Oh, I can craft stuff.

1723
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:05,700
Okay.

1724
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,020
Alright.

1725
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,240
We're almost here.

1726
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,440
I almost thought I was gonna die from fall damage.

1727
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,100
Oh, thank you for the...

1728
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,540
Earthy boy.

1729
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,080
Thank you for 10 gifted subs.

1730
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,240
Thank you!

1731
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,220
I really appreciate it.

1732
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,300
Alright.

1733
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,700
I'm heading back.

1734
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,440
Oh my god, I'm almost there.

1735
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,860
I'm almost...

1736
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,720
Back from my second...

1737
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,240
I've lost count.

1738
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,400
How many pilgrimages I've made now.

1739
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,020
I've never any lost count.

1740
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,860
But I'm back!

1741
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,700
I'm back!

1742
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,260
I have made my journey.

1743
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,660
Oh.

1744
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:09,980
Okay.

1745
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,700
Wait, that's shroud.

1746
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,700
I recognize the shroud, boys.

1747
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,320
Yeah, that's...

1748
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,000
That's shroud.

1749
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,560
Oh!

1750
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,080
Okay.

1751
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,560
What's going on?

1752
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,280
I'm eavesdropping.

1753
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,400
Okay.

1754
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,060
I'm back from my pilgrimage.

1755
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:15,840
Let's get out of here.

1756
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,460
Let's leave them to their business.

1757
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,620
Yeah, we...

1758
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,360
Bye!

1759
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:27,880
Bye!

1760
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,920
I'm back.

1761
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,180
I've made the third pilgrimage.

1762
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,940
They got us from behind!

1763
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,620
I got...

1764
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,840
Shaked from behind.

1765
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,180
Do you have a sleeping bag?

1766
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,780
I'm tired of traveling.

1767
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,560
Did you live?

1768
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,560
I made it back.

1769
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,340
I made another pilgrimage.

1770
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,960
I did it.

1771
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,400
I saw four bears on my travel here.

1772
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,860
Four fucking bears.

1773
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,820
And I outran all four of them.

1774
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:12,940
Wait.

1775
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:13,840
Woah!

1776
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,380
Woah!

1777
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,160
Woah!

1778
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:15,840
They shot!

1779
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,240
No, I fucking ran like a bitch.

1780
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,400
Get away from here!

1781
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,020
Get away!

1782
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,760
Just getting the wood.

1783
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,020
Don't mind me.

1784
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,640
Attack of what I have brought!

1785
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,640
Just getting the wood.

1786
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,940
Don't mind me.

1787
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,020
I need a sleeping bag.

1788
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,200
I can't.

1789
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,280
I can't do another pilgrimage.

1790
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:50,220
I can't.

1791
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,060
I cannot.

1792
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,520
I cannot.

1793
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,720
Wait, who's this guy?

1794
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,180
Wait, how did he die?

1795
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,420
That was when he got taken out earlier.

1796
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,000
That's when we all died there.

1797
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:08,920
The great war.

1798
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,040
The great war of 2024.

1799
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:19,700
I think we got ambushed or something.

1800
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,800
Oh shit!

1801
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:21,580
Oh my god.

1802
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,860
Please, I can't.

1803
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,480
I can't do another pilgrimage.

1804
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,240
I can't.

1805
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,080
The great death.

1806
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,220
This is like the emu war all over again.

1807
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,360
I can't.

1808
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,120
It's alright.

1809
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,140
We need this.

1810
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,200
We need...

1811
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,480
Jackie to help us.

1812
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:40,900
Oh.

1813
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,060
Oh.

1814
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,640
I need a sleeping bag.

1815
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,340
I can't make another pilgrimage.

1816
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,180
I don't have it anymore in me.

1817
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,520
If I die one more time and I spawn in 200 miles away.

1818
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,720
Thank you sir.

1819
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,380
Thank you for giving me the cloth.

1820
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,160
Where's the cloth?

1821
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,500
Where did I put the cloth?

1822
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,100
I know.

1823
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,960
This is my second time.

1824
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,960
Can you hear me?

1825
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:09,720
I know.

1826
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,340
I killed four bears along the way.

1827
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,920
I've been touched by the cloth.

1828
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,180
With just a rock in my hand.

1829
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,960
The devil's medal?

1830
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,440
What does that look like?

1831
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,960
Long dragon sticks.

1832
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,120
People hold.

1833
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,840
I don't think I've ever seen...

1834
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,240
I don't think I've ever seen a devil's medal.

1835
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,440
You see them holding lizards in their hands.

1836
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:49,980
Lizards?

1837
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,940
We build with wood and stone only.

1838
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,400
No metal.

1839
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,740
Wood and stone only.

1840
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,240
What?

1841
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,680
We range and should you kill someone.

1842
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,680
You are only allowed to take one thing from them.

1843
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,980
Wait, my gun is a key.

1844
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,420
You take one thing and one thing only.

1845
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,860
Wait, my gun...

1846
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,320
My drop is a key.

1847
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,200
You can't say that.

1848
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:21,880
But what if I...

1849
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,080
I will banish you from the lands of Everwinter.

1850
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,140
Oh.

1851
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,480
Yes.

1852
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,380
I can tell you're a warrior.

1853
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,500
Press tab, Doki.

1854
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,460
Your hair is a beautiful shade of fire.

1855
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,300
Oh, thank you.

1856
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,020
Thank you.

1857
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,100
I was touched by the bear claw.

1858
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,260
And now I survive every bear encounter.

1859
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:46,900
Alright, I'm in.

1860
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,460
Do I have it?

1861
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,280
I don't think I have it.

1862
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,480
Where's my claw?

1863
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,440
Grab the devil's medal.

1864
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,240
Yeah, my AK is wood and stone.

1865
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,780
Oh, there it is.

1866
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,380
Hey, Gumi, Gumi.

1867
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,160
Gumi here.

1868
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,700
Oh my god, guys.

1869
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:11,360
Guys.

1870
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,660
They won't know, guys.

1871
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,440
Guys, they won't know if I eat...

1872
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,760
If I touch...

1873
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,780
If I touch the lizard...

1874
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,440
The gun.

1875
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,120
They won't know.

1876
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,620
They won't know.

1877
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:27,420
My AK is made out of stone and wood.

1878
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,140
They won't know.

1879
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,940
Then why am I still here doing women's work?

1880
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,060
Woah!

1881
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,480
And what exactly is women's work?

1882
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:47,340
What exactly is women's work?

1883
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,720
Lady Gumiho, I assign you HR.

1884
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,380
You will deal with any...

1885
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,620
You will deal with any...

1886
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,580
Acts of...

1887
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,320
Chauvinism.

1888
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:58,940
Sorry, we got HR?

1889
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,080
We're progressive?

1890
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,940
There's no crimes.

1891
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,520
What did you mean by that?

1892
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,580
We are vikings.

1893
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,180
Yes, but there are women vikings.

1894
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,640
And I'll give you a vikings funeral.

1895
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:21,900
You draw your bow in our place of worship.

1896
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,980
No, but we have to be progressive vikings.

1897
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,740
Case in point.

1898
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,140
There are shield maidens in the vikings.

1899
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,660
What do you say of those?

1900
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,220
You dare disrespect a shield maiden?

1901
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,660
Vikings can't take a joke.

1902
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,080
We must be having a sense of humor.

1903
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,160
I thought we were a family.

1904
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,160
Why would we take everything so serious?

1905
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,140
Oh, sorry.

1906
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,860
I forgot your...

1907
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,440
I forgot...

1908
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,120
I forgot the Nords...

1909
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,420
That's the Nordics way of joking.

1910
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,340
It's a little bit difficult to understand.

1911
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,840
If you're under this rock, you are family.

1912
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,040
We're all family here.

1913
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,260
Those who are not building, come.

1914
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,300
We go ranging.

1915
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,880
Wait, I do not have a bow, sir.

1916
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,700
Lady Gumi, with me.

1917
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,320
I do not have a bow, sir.

1918
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,340
Please, I can't make another...

1919
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:29,620
This is my last straw.

1920
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,340
If I die one more time, I'm not coming back.

1921
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,080
I'm not...

1922
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:38,620
I'm not coming back if I die one more time.

1923
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,600
This area is too far.

1924
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,860
This pilgrimage is too far.

1925
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,340
I can't...

1926
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,500
This was my last one in me.

1927
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,320
We're hunting for cloth, guys.

1928
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,300
We're hunting for cloth.

1929
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:01,920
Yes.

1930
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,720
I see it.

1931
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,440
I feel like this is the gate to Valhalla.

1932
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,420
This reminds me of the gates of Valhalla right here.

1933
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,720
Come.

1934
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,980
We're the shield maidens.

1935
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:36,380
The lordship Sykkuno?

1936
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:37,180
He's here?

1937
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,760
Those are lizard guns.

1938
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,740
But the lizard...

1939
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,680
But our AK is made of stone and wood, so it's okay, right?

1940
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,500
I will go up there with my rock.

1941
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,900
I have not learned.

1942
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,700
I've killed four of these.

1943
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,980
I can kill a fifth.

1944
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,300
Who are you?

1945
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:21,960
I keep getting so close, and then I die to people.

1946
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,460
Who killed you?

1947
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,280
Did you kill him?

1948
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:46,340
Just head north and you'll get there to the fortress.

1949
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,020
Hello, brethren.

1950
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,180
I've acquired cloth.

1951
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,220
You have acquired cloth?

1952
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,640
I shall craft us all beds.

1953
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,980
Oh, thank you, Kaiser.

1954
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:11,580
You shall be welcomed in Valhalla, Mason.

1955
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,660
Oh my god, thank god I don't have to hunt.

1956
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,060
I don't have to gather.

1957
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,160
Thank god.

1958
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,040
Thank god.

1959
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,020
I don't have to do anything.

1960
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,520
I'm coming over.

1961
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,200
Oh my god, the sacred river.

1962
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,300
We should do a viking funeral there one day.

1963
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,540
You know women aren't allowed in Valhalla?

1964
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,500
I don't think they know that yet.

1965
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,660
The guardians of Valhalla.

1966
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,560
Go away, pumpkin.

1967
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,420
Oh, they are.

1968
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,400
I thought they weren't.

1969
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,100
Somebody was like, oh, they're not.

1970
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,040
And I was like, what?

1971
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,080
And I got confused.

1972
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,460
Thank god they are.

1973
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,640
Oh, women aren't allowed.

1974
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,640
I got one guide.

1975
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,720
I got one guide.

1976
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,040
Oh my god.

1977
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,620
We're like the Valkyries.

1978
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,620
Is there anyone there?

1979
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:32,440
We can discover the land and claim it as our own.

1980
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:42,700
Which way?

1981
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:43,560
Which way is it?

1982
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:45,680
Who said that?

1983
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,120
I said that.

1984
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:47,920
You're cooking.

1985
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,380
You're cooking.

1986
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:55,300
A resort of sorts.

1987
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:55,940
A resort?

1988
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,780
A little vacation home for the vikings?

1989
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,600
Full of fun.

1990
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:02,540
Full of fun and no metal allowed.

1991
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,280
Oh my god, this stream you have.

1992
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:27,500
I don't know how to explain this, but I was told by an old god we would receive gifts if we don't partake in the dragon fire rods, guns.

1993
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,420
We will receive a blessing.

1994
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,820
What kind of blessing?

1995
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,460
By old gods, I mean the faceless gods.

1996
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,300
And by faceless, I mean face punch.

1997
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,780
Who is he?

1998
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,620
Wait, who's this?

1999
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:44,600
Who goes there?

2000
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:45,680
Norway!

2001
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,560
Let's go, Norway!

2002
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,700
Join us, join the free people.

2003
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:59,080
I like how it's like we're talking in the old English and the chat box is like, yo, sup guys!

2004
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:04,080
We shall create thy paradise.

2005
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:05,300
Yo, guys!

2006
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,680
Drop your clothes, drop your clothes!

2007
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,180
Not the way of the viking.

2008
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:20,320
Time travel, this is a time travel segment.

2009
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:21,840
The bags are sleeping!

2010
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,020
The bags are sleeping!

2011
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,720
Oh my god, where is it?

2012
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,260
Eat this, chatter.

2013
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,100
Eat this.

2014
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,340
Disperse the bags of sleeping.

2015
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,680
Oh my god, I shall be reborn!

2016
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:37,820
Once again!

2017
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,360
How's it hanging, my...

2018
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:48,520
Yes, we must go back to the fortress so we can be reborn.

2019
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,400
How's it hanging, my fellow vikings?

2020
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,580
In Valhalla, we go!

2021
01:36:55,960 --> 01:37:00,540
Anyway, women are allowed in Valhalla, so I don't think they know that yet, so we shall...

2022
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:01,420
We've done it.

2023
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,860
No, they won't know.

2024
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:05,620
They won't know.

2025
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,460
They're progressive.

2026
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:07,720
They're progressive vikings.

2027
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,140
In this Valhalla, we shall be accepted.

2028
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,180
We're not allowed to have guns.

2029
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,960
We're not allowed to have guns in this faction.

2030
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,660
I think we should...

2031
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,000
I don't know now.

2032
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,280
Do you think they'll treat us...

2033
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,600
Maybe we're the exception.

2034
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,020
My gun is sort of made of stone and wood.

2035
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,700
What did he say?

2036
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,520
What did he say?

2037
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,660
Yeah, but he was joking!

2038
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,300
He was joking!

2039
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,500
He said, don't you know about the viking joking?

2040
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,260
Have you never talked to a Nordic?

2041
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,500
That's how they joke!

2042
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,800
That's how the Nords joke!

2043
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:50,840
That's how the Nords joke!

2044
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,600
Those guys...

2045
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:58,700
Yeah, those silly Scandinavians...

2046
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:00,080
As a fellow Scand...

2047
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,400
That's how I call myself.

2048
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:05,880
As a fellow Scand...

2049
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,540
That is how we joke.

2050
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,860
That is how we joke.

2051
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:21,160
This is how they joke all the time.

2052
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,640
As a Scandinavian, I did not know this.

2053
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,900
I must adjust my jokes.

2054
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:39,800
Whoa, I hear things being broken.

2055
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,240
Forgot how to do the sleeping bag.

2056
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:56,860
The box?

2057
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:57,840
Touch the box?

2058
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,560
Oh, I touched the box!

2059
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,440
The secret box!

2060
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:07,100
Where do you put your sleeping bag?

2061
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,440
Put it in team chat.

2062
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,940
Put it in my team chat!

2063
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,160
Can we come inside?

2064
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:19,780
Okay,

2065
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:23,860
what should we...

2066
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:26,760
Bahala...

2067
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,460
Did I spell it right?

2068
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,200
Progressive...

2069
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,120
I have a mouth that wants bed.

2070
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,320
Welcome to the Cold Stone.

2071
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,800
It's the Cold Stone.

2072
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,360
This is the house.

2073
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,280
This is our land.

2074
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,200
Oh my goodness.

2075
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,880
This is our fortress.

2076
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:30,260
What kind of blessing shall the bountiful replenish?

2077
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,840
What kind of blessing Our skin will now be fatter.

2078
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,060
Our legs can become faster.

2079
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,420
Our brains will crease the folds of reality.

2080
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,840
Don't worry child.

2081
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,680
If you stick to our ways.

2082
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:50,400
We will show everyone that we are no one to be screwed with.

2083
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:05,380
We'll never get killed by bears again?

2084
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,500
They will become our friends?

2085
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:10,440
If we believe?

2086
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:11,640
I believe.

2087
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,260
I believe now.

2088
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,460
Guys, did you hear that?

2089
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,380
I don't want...

2090
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,720
You...

2091
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:25,720
...are a place of worship.

2092
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:29,840
Oh my goodness, I'm getting flashbacks.

2093
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,840
What did you just call ColdStone?

2094
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,600
What did you call ColdStone?

2095
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,060
I'm sacred, lads.

2096
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,380
He has an accent.

2097
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:42,660
You are a guest under our roof.

2098
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,660
He's a guy.

2099
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,840
You are a guest here, and you disrespect our house of honor.

2100
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,140
Please don't kill him.

2101
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:49,220
Please, he's a good friend of mine.

2102
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,160
I suffer a disease called rusty bones.

2103
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:51,720
They're fragile.

2104
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,620
If you shoot me once, I might just collapse.

2105
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:57,620
Lord Shaki, I don't know if you're familiar, but he used to...

2106
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:58,480
Don't ever...

2107
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,400
Don't ever disrespect your house if you join.

2108
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,120
Don't ever disrespect our home.

2109
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:07,620
Sorry, this is ColdStone.

2110
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,320
ColdStone, I love ColdStone.

2111
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,380
Woo, ice cream!

2112
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:15,580
Did he just compare Sacred Lance to ice cream?

2113
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,460
I've given you a bed.

2114
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,360
It's right here.

2115
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:20,280
I am wearing an ice cream right now.

2116
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,120
Oh, thank you.

2117
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,360
Thank you, Lord Shaki.

2118
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:28,440
Oh, wait, my sleeping bag's a race car!

2119
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,540
Wait, it's a race car.

2120
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,140
No, no, Sir John.

2121
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,780
We do not kneel.

2122
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,400
Get up on your feet!

2123
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,780
You bow to no one.

2124
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:45,320
Oh, sorry.

2125
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,840
Bow to no one!

2126
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,140
Oh, wait.

2127
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:50,880
Wait a minute.

2128
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,740
You're a clown!

2129
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:53,680
All right, listen.

2130
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:56,200
Look at how Lady Gumiho is dressed.

2131
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,760
This is how we all must dress.

2132
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,500
Billy Liza.

2133
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,620
Yep, yep.

2134
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:11,680
Listen, we cannot be wearing colorful clothing or reds or blues or greens.

2135
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:15,380
No, we wear the old wooden armor.

2136
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,820
But this shirt was passed down by my mother.

2137
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:18,620
Can I request an exception?

2138
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,300
Oh, what?

2139
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,760
Sir Blau, I request an exception.

2140
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,520
Sir Blau, are thou froggy boots okay?

2141
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,760
Look at the drip.

2142
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:34,920
Froggy boots are allowed!

2143
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:36,760
What kind of a snail was that?

2144
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:37,460
Huzzah!

2145
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,160
Huzzah!

2146
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,420
Look at this little fella on my foot.

2147
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,000
Huzzah to the froggy boots!

2148
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,540
Oh my God, look at this little froggy!

2149
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:48,280
How did you get the lizard to shape this way?

2150
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,440
Yeah, how were you able to design that?

2151
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,280
Huzzah!

2152
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,020
How about you keep the lizard's face intact?

2153
01:43:59,220 --> 01:43:59,740
OOC.

2154
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,280
Blau just goes OOC there.

2155
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,820
Not gonna lie, they did look sick.

2156
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:06,560
No, my beautiful blue shirt!

2157
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,420
Does anybody have an extra bed I might be able to partake in?

2158
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:11,260
Not gonna lie to that.

2159
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,580
Maybe it'd be my friend, unfortunately.

2160
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,880
They won't know.

2161
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:21,260
I'm gonna get an AK and then I'll just be like...

2162
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:23,200
I'll be made of stone and rock.

2163
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,720
Sir Blau, I have procured a gift for you, my friend.

2164
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:34,720
What the fuck, no!

2165
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,940
What's going on outside?

2166
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,160
Open the doors, open the gates!

2167
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,760
Oh God, watch out!

2168
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:41,420
Run!

2169
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,820
It's gone!

2170
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,740
Do not worry, you are safe now!

2171
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,540
No tech, they have a lock.

2172
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:53,980
That's not a lock!

2173
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:56,940
It's a sacred...

2174
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:59,740
It's a gift from our old gods.

2175
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:01,480
Odin gave us that.

2176
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,300
It's not a lock.

2177
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,740
It's not technology if Odin gave it to us.

2178
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:09,320
Press tab, open up your inventory.

2179
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,260
It's a rune, exactly.

2180
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,160
That is a sacred rune.

2181
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,740
It's a warding rune, exactly.

2182
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:21,540
What is this technology you speak of?

2183
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,780
You are now one of us.

2184
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:24,940
We are doing invites into the group.

2185
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:27,280
Please go and see Lord Shaki, he'll get you in.

2186
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,680
Lord Shaki!

2187
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:32,800
Lord Shaki!

2188
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:34,240
Yes?

2189
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:37,480
My AK will become a magic stick!

2190
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:45,980
Brothers, Odin touched me and now I have a magic stick.

2191
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,620
Odin came to me in a dream.

2192
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,480
I need builders and raiders.

2193
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:55,820
Builders, I need you to keep working on the Coldstone Fortress.

2194
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,800
We must erect it.

2195
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,300
How hard does the stone need to be?

2196
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,260
What do the rangers do?

2197
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:17,020
If you have a bow and you seek to range, come with me.

2198
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:20,040
I don't have a bow, but I seek to range, sir.

2199
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,360
I think you do have a bow, sir.

2200
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,160
I would like an adventure.

2201
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,600
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!

2202
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,440
Now I have a bow.

2203
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,960
No problem, milady.

2204
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,360
Shaki, my beautiful wife, do you need food?

2205
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:41,240
I have corn, it is okay, but I do need arrows.

2206
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:44,860
I'm starving, I just realized that.

2207
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:45,400
I need arrows.

2208
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:51,300
Sirella, there's a mysterious man.

2209
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,480
I don't know if he...

2210
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,640
Where's the arrows?

2211
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:59,740
I saw him lurking around and I didn't know what he was doing.

2212
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,060
I will have to make you some.

2213
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,220
Oh, thank you, I really appreciate it.

2214
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,680
He smells musky.

2215
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,860
I'm going to put some scrap away here.

2216
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,640
I'm just going to put in the other...

2217
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:19,520
Rope?

2218
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:20,200
Let me check.

2219
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:20,760
Nope.

2220
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,400
I'm going to put all of this away.

2221
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,140
I don't need any of this.

2222
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:36,700
Yeah, I'm here!

2223
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:38,740
Box.

2224
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,680
I like how it's just called box.

2225
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:48,500
On the right side, it should be like a quick craft and it should show an arrow.

2226
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,380
You can just make like five of those or like ten.

2227
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:55,240
Oh, nice!

2228
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,340
Let's go, I can't wait to go hunting.

2229
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:00,560
Hunting for the group.

2230
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:05,660
I sure hope they haven't left us.

2231
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:06,820
I think they left us.

2232
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:08,360
It's okay, we'll explore on our own.

2233
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:11,920
We can explore on our own.

2234
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,700
They may be here.

2235
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:15,320
Alright.

2236
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2237
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:19,100
Oh!

2238
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,540
Did you have the arrows?

2239
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:25,800
Yeah, thank you.

2240
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,500
That's enough arrows for me.

2241
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,860
Eleven arrows is enough.

2242
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:36,020
Oh!

2243
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:36,880
Wait, wait.

2244
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,020
Yes?

2245
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:41,440
Our other brothers and sisters are this way.

2246
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,360
Oh, more arrows.

2247
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,020
Okay, nice.

2248
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:47,020
They're over there.

2249
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:56,400
What is that?

2250
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,360
I've only heard of legends about it.

2251
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,840
We should shoot it down!

2252
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:09,370
Do you think the Old Gods would approve of that?

2253
01:49:09,610 --> 01:49:12,130
Yes, imagine how many families we'll feed.

2254
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:12,930
The Old Gods wouldn't only approve.

2255
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:15,190
They would require it.

2256
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:17,050
It's like Indiana Jones 4.

2257
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:24,650
It's like the newest Indiana Jones movie.

2258
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,630
I'm sorry, I fell.

2259
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:32,770
There was a... yeah, there was.

2260
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:33,410
I think it was over me.

2261
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,210
Oh wait, sorry, it was Indiana Jones 5.

2262
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:40,310
I've lost track of...

2263
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:43,070
It's kind of hard to do.

2264
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:46,090
Here we are.

2265
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:47,470
Rangers here!

2266
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:50,950
Where are we going?

2267
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:58,870
Yes!

2268
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:00,430
Yes!

2269
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:04,650
Line it in!

2270
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:20,900
What is that in Game of Thrones?

2271
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,640
I've got peer pressure in my load.

2272
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,380
They all shot, so I thought I shot.

2273
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:33,220
I shot when I heard them shooting.

2274
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:39,280
Wait, wait, don't do nothing.

2275
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,220
Please, hold on.

2276
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,460
What have you done?

2277
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:48,100
Wait, dragon, we've met in another world, right?

2278
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,140
Do we trust dragons?

2279
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,560
It's the trash man!

2280
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:53,560
The same dragon I know from before.

2281
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,640
No, he's safe.

2282
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:55,700
I know this dragon.

2283
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,720
I know this dragon, guys.

2284
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,640
I've fought with him before in many battles.

2285
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:03,520
We're going to try this again!

2286
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,640
Aiming at the metal rock!

2287
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:06,840
Archers!

2288
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,040
Knock!

2289
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:09,500
Draw!

2290
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:11,700
You son of a bitch!

2291
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:23,260
I thought you were one of the leaders, Elam!

2292
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:27,720
Elam, aren't you one of the leaders?

2293
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:36,300
Hey, don't look at me.

2294
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,580
I don't got a bow here, alright?

2295
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,380
I think Elam...

2296
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:42,840
We're ready.

2297
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,820
We did it!

2298
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:51,520
We did it!

2299
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:52,060
We won!

2300
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:54,220
We learned!

2301
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,940
Wait, who's that behind us?

2302
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,060
Sabla, who's that?

2303
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,600
Welcome, Harrison!

2304
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:14,240
He has a metal lizard.

2305
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:17,240
He has a metal lizard on his hip.

2306
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:19,340
Wait, he does!

2307
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,430
He has a metal lizard on his hip.

2308
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,060
Metal lizard!

2309
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:26,900
Metal lizard, real jerk!

2310
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,340
I don't have any metal on me.

2311
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:32,180
You have a metal lizard?

2312
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:33,380
I can see it.

2313
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,480
Elam, you're lagging hard.

2314
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:46,220
Your mic is lagging.

2315
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,300
You're bald!

2316
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:54,980
Is he cutting in and out?

2317
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,260
Oh, he does not sound normal for me.

2318
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,660
That's true, that's true.

2319
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:17,440
Wait, don't Vikings hate the British?

2320
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,300
How is he a leader?

2321
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:24,860
Oh,

2322
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,640
there is a bear!

2323
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:36,240
Are you okay?

2324
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,520
I got you!

2325
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,620
I took it out!

2326
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,540
Are you okay, Shaki?

2327
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,580
It's but a flesh wound!

2328
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,040
You survived!

2329
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:51,640
I don't even feel it.

2330
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:53,520
I need meat.

2331
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,920
I need some meat.

2332
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:01,740
Do not worry, I removed the arrow in your head.

2333
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,760
I performed a successful surgery.

2334
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:05,620
I'm sorry, Lord Shaki!

2335
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:07,320
Do I sound any different?

2336
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,480
No, you sound great!

2337
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:12,640
You sound just the same, Lord Shaki!

2338
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,480
Just the same!

2339
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,360
Nothing weird!

2340
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:22,860
What's 2 plus 2, Shaki?

2341
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,560
What's 2 plus 2?

2342
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:27,160
I don't like avocados!

2343
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:59,080
I don't like avocados!

2344
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,460
He has the green boots!

2345
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:03,080
He has the green boots, Lord Shaki!

2346
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,680
Take this.

2347
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:10,960
It is the bone from my grandmother.

2348
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:14,420
What is this?

2349
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,240
Keep it close.

2350
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,740
Never lose it.

2351
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:20,260
Thank you so much, Shaki.

2352
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,740
That is the token of our appreciation to you.

2353
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:23,640
And our allegiance.

2354
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:27,000
And here, this as well.

2355
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,560
That is the arrow that slayed the dragon.

2356
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:32,960
The metal dragon?

2357
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:33,560
My grandfather.

2358
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,520
I will cherish it.

2359
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,360
Will you kill me?

2360
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:39,920
I will keep it with my finest eunuch.

2361
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,380
Wait, you're the dragon?

2362
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,620
Don't kill him!

2363
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,060
No, it wasn't me!

2364
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:48,340
It wasn't me!

2365
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,060
It was my great-great-great-great-grandfather!

2366
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:56,820
If you spare one of your ancestors, they'll come back for revenge!

2367
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:59,680
They'll come back for revenge if you don't kill the lion!

2368
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:01,420
Kill him!

2369
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:04,900
Traitor!

2370
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,240
Traitor!

2371
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,740
His name is Red!

2372
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:11,060
His name is Red now!

2373
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,700
I'm peaceful.

2374
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,960
Honestly, I didn't think he would die that quick.

2375
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:15,980
I'm going to be completely honest.

2376
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:17,580
I didn't think he would...

2377
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:19,160
His machete really does pack a punch.

2378
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:20,160
Oh, this is perfect.

2379
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:22,000
We actually need skulls.

2380
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,800
Oh, you need skulls?

2381
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:24,780
You guys seem friendly.

2382
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:26,580
We need skulls.

2383
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:27,500
This is perfect.

2384
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,240
Here is a skull for you.

2385
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,360
Oh, thank you.

2386
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:33,420
Was that his skull?

2387
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,880
No, it was abandoned.

2388
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,020
I've slain long ages ago.

2389
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,640
But I shall give it to you as a peace offering.

2390
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:40,800
I've never heard that before.

2391
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,080
Thank you.

2392
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,080
Thank you for the skull.

2393
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:46,500
The king does have a beautiful voice.

2394
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:49,480
We leave the cursed walls and false king with me!

2395
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:52,960
We will keep this peace with you, sir.

2396
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:53,980
I want to see the blaze.

2397
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:56,100
No, no, no, no, no.

2398
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:04,260
We're not ready.

2399
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,060
We're not ready for a fucking door, man.

2400
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:06,880
Okay, alright.

2401
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,040
A door, let's go!

2402
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:10,680
Yay!

2403
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:11,800
Yes!

2404
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,660
This is exactly what we wanted.

2405
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:16,980
Yeah.

2406
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:19,840
What does that mean?

2407
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:24,540
A big capsule is actually being shipped right now.

2408
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,860
It's not quite here, but...

2409
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:30,140
How many people did it take to make this castle?

2410
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,360
Whoa!

2411
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,900
Oh my god!

2412
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,240
Wait!

2413
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:49,460
A tour!

2414
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:52,760
Welcome to our home!

2415
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,760
Thank you, yes.

2416
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:57,600
Our humble abode.

2417
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,620
Oh my, how many years...

2418
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:03,280
How many years did it take you to build this?

2419
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:07,500
Generations?

2420
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,740
Your great-great-father made this castle?

2421
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:13,560
Yes.

2422
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:18,340
And it's still not complete?

2423
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,500
Listen, I know you guys...

2424
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,920
I know you guys don't kneel to anyone.

2425
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,360
I'm just saying...

2426
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,560
If you consider kneeling, some of this could be yours.

2427
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:29,420
We do not kneel.

2428
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,600
Guys, I sort of want to kneel.

2429
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:33,180
Guys, I sort of...

2430
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,240
Guys, I sort of want to kneel.

2431
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:40,420
Yes!

2432
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,760
Oh, let's go, let's go!

2433
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:48,020
We must feed!

2434
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:58,720
Are you sure you do not wish to join us?

2435
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:11,360
We can be hired by Mercy.

2436
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:19,360
We are brothers.

2437
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:21,340
Nothing more, nothing less.

2438
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:45,480
I brought a skull!

2439
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:51,300
Once.

2440
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:54,960
But I've given you a skull!

2441
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:56,080
Does that not count?

2442
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:04,120
Oh,

2443
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:09,340
a bonus skull.

2444
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:09,840
Okay.

2445
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:18,280
It's the metal dragon!

2446
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,720
It's the metal dragon!

2447
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:22,100
It's the metal dragon!

2448
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:24,420
It's the dragon!

2449
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,680
The dragon's here!

2450
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:28,920
Leave!

2451
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:32,660
Run from the dragon!

2452
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:35,300
Run!

2453
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,940
Run from the dragon!

2454
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:41,140
Quick, back to the fortress!

2455
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:42,460
Do not run!

2456
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,280
Do not run!

2457
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:57,700
Does that mean...

2458
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:00,540
Does that mean we shoot on sight?

2459
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,240
Anybody that we don't know?

2460
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:03,880
No.

2461
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:05,920
No.

2462
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:12,280
Don't talk about my mother like that!

2463
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:35,760
No way...

2464
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:42,220
We'll never know what LM is saying.

2465
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,000
We'll never know!

2466
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:47,000
Guys, how do I emote?

2467
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:05,200
It's Taki!

2468
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,280
A boar!

2469
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:23,140
Nice!

2470
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,620
We shall feed the families with this!

2471
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:40,800
Drink some mead and you shall feel better!

2472
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:47,920
Drink some lead?

2473
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:48,700
Mead!

2474
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:53,900
I said mead!

2475
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:55,060
I said mead!

2476
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,540
I mean, you can drink lead if you want!

2477
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,460
I see someone on the bridge, sir!

2478
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:05,640
Sir, that's a skull!

2479
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:07,720
We must go talk to them!

2480
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:09,620
That could be a skull!

2481
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,520
We must draw them in!

2482
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,300
We must draw them in!

2483
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:14,580
Before...

2484
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:16,000
We must be one of them!

2485
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,840
Wait, that's two!

2486
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:20,840
We don't pretend to be traitors, we are traitors!

2487
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:22,100
Wait, stop!

2488
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,280
Everybody stop!

2489
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:24,940
We will be traitors first!

2490
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:28,960
We will be trading cloth and other objects!

2491
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:32,280
And then, when I say the signal...

2492
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:32,880
We fire!

2493
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:34,460
Hello!

2494
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:35,680
Hello!

2495
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:37,900
We are traitors!

2496
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:39,500
We are traitors!

2497
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,680
We are traitors!

2498
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,260
What's the signal?

2499
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,380
I think...

2500
02:03:58,380 --> 02:03:58,840
I think...

2501
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:02,760
Before they figured it out...

2502
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:03,880
No, stop!

2503
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,120
Holy shit!

2504
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,380
I could tell they were onto us.

2505
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:18,620
They were onto us, I could sense it.

2506
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:22,520
I can't!

2507
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:25,540
Oh my god!

2508
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,320
That was so...

2509
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:28,940
That was so good!

2510
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,340
Oh my god!

2511
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:38,740
I can't!

2512
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:39,880
Oh my god!

2513
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,140
I can't!

2514
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:41,960
I feel bad.

2515
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:42,580
We need it.

2516
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:45,780
We need the skulls to become allegiance with the kingdom.

2517
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:53,280
I can't, guys.

2518
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:55,140
I can't.

2519
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:56,740
That was so good.

2520
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,540
You must answer the riddle.

2521
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:13,400
You must answer the riddle.

2522
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,280
She can't sing.

2523
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:25,020
I'll do it all for the nookie.

2524
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:32,800
Grab the skull!

2525
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:34,160
Another skull!

2526
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,440
Another skull!

2527
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:42,880
I can't!

2528
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:43,760
I can't!

2529
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:44,140
I can't!

2530
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:45,040
Oh my god!

2531
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:45,660
I can't!

2532
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:46,600
I need it!

2533
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:47,560
I can't!

2534
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:49,380
Hi!

2535
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,700
Oh my god!

2536
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:51,260
I can't!

2537
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:52,000
I can't!

2538
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:52,800
Oh my god!

2539
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:53,440
I have tears!

2540
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:55,420
I have tears in my eyes!

2541
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:56,080
I can't!

2542
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:01,240
I can't!

2543
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:02,360
Give me a sec!

2544
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:03,860
I need...

2545
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,620
I need to reset myself!

2546
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:06,600
I can't!

2547
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,500
This is...

2548
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,460
I'm coming over!

2549
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:09,520
I need...

2550
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:14,840
I can't!

2551
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:16,500
Holy fuck!

2552
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:17,560
I'm getting my cough drops!

2553
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:18,140
I can't!

2554
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:19,100
This is...

2555
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:20,470
Oh my god!

2556
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:30,340
I lost my dignity!

2557
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:31,580
I'm naked!

2558
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,920
I joined...

2559
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:43,060
You guys wanted me to join the blood god?

2560
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:50,480
I can't!

2561
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:53,160
I can't!

2562
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:53,920
I fucking can't!

2563
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:56,960
Take this.

2564
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:58,220
This potato.

2565
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:01,920
I love vikings.

2566
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:04,100
I love vikings.

2567
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:09,880
You're rejecting his offering?

2568
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:13,700
You are rejecting his kind offering?

2569
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:14,320
I'm eating the potato.

2570
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:19,780
This is what you must eat to join our brotherhood.

2571
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:20,820
Indeed.

2572
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:23,300
Our diet is only potatoes and corn.

2573
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:24,140
You must eat.

2574
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,840
I'm eating the leaves of the seed.

2575
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:28,160
Yes.

2576
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,980
The gods bless you.

2577
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:36,180
The gods bless you.

2578
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:37,720
I still...

2579
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:38,920
I can't!

2580
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,880
I can't!

2581
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:42,620
I'm still thinking about that first kill.

2582
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:45,620
I'm still thinking about the traitor kill.

2583
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:46,620
I can't.

2584
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:51,060
That is the signal.

2585
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,660
Oh my god.

2586
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,340
Oh my god.

2587
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,100
Oh my god.

2588
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,420
There is no blood god.

2589
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:09,640
We shall not anger him.

2590
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:12,920
It's not even a real god.

2591
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:30,360
Wait, are we still traitors?

2592
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:34,140
Hello!

2593
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,720
We're here to trade.

2594
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:37,560
Do you have anything?

2595
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:42,280
Do you smell the air?

2596
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:44,580
What do you smell?

2597
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:48,020
I have a hat.

2598
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,780
I smell something.

2599
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:51,980
I smell fear.

2600
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:07,820
We shall let him pass for now.

2601
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:16,620
How are you going to say we need horses and then you let the only horseman we've seen thus far leave?

2602
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:22,800
That does not seem logical.

2603
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:25,960
Why must we give him mercy, Blau?

2604
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:35,860
Oh my god.

2605
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:38,880
What is this?

2606
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:39,760
An iron dragon?

2607
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:42,820
Some kind of land serpent?

2608
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:46,880
It's a dead... Oh my... I think it is dead.

2609
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,560
Boy!

2610
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:01,100
Yes.

2611
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:04,300
Yes.

2612
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,820
I know those blue shirts might be important to you, but you must remove them.

2613
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:14,700
We must all look like a bunch of savages.

2614
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:16,900
Yes, good!

2615
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:24,960
Look at how Lady Gumiho is dressed.

2616
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,120
This is how we should look.

2617
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:27,180
I apologize.

2618
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:28,740
It was...

2619
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:33,860
No, my blue shirt!

2620
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,060
My blue shirt!

2621
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:39,920
It was the first clothing I've ever owned.

2622
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:43,480
It was the first clothing I've ever owned.

2623
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:45,040
Goodbye, blue shirt!

2624
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,200
Goodbye!

2625
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:49,400
I accepted the win.

2626
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:51,700
There's no H&M in Valhalla.

2627
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:57,380
There's sadly no H&M.

2628
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,820
Yes, what is it?

2629
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:07,340
What is the word, Gumi?

2630
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:14,960
Are vikings allowed to gamble?

2631
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:21,300
Is gambling a sin in Valhalla?

2632
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:27,140
No gambling?

2633
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:31,060
A hat?

2634
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:35,140
Oh my...

2635
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:39,060
It's okay, I dropped some corn.

2636
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,780
Oh my god, look at me.

2637
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,100
I dropped some corn seeds.

2638
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:46,200
We don't need them.

2639
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,400
We have so much corn.

2640
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:58,520
The bouncer of Valhalla doesn't like that shirt.

2641
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:09,040
Loot on the way!

2642
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:09,860
Loot on the way!

2643
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:17,080
How many skulls do we need to get?

2644
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:26,440
Did we not kill three?

2645
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,180
I thought we killed three.

2646
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:35,120
Someone must have an extra skull.

2647
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:38,200
I remember killing three.

2648
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,100
Get him out!

2649
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:02,020
Harvest him.

2650
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,540
Get the skull!

2651
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:07,820
The bones.

2652
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:11,820
Do we have a skull, Gumi?

2653
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:19,480
They have no brain?

2654
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:22,360
Oh, I have a skull!

2655
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:23,420
I have a skull!

2656
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:26,940
There's a body!

2657
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:28,580
Harvest!

2658
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:29,080
Harvest!

2659
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:32,600
Wait, he has items!

2660
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:38,100
What is that?

2661
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:40,380
What is that?

2662
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:42,420
What is that?

2663
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:42,960
Is that?

2664
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:45,120
He has a steed!

2665
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,100
Sir LM has a steed!

2666
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:52,840
Him and his car!

2667
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:02,760
What do we not need?

2668
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:07,520
What am I meant to do now?

2669
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:12,360
I dropped skull on the floor!

2670
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:16,680
There's a lot of them around us.

2671
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:19,680
Bear!

2672
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:21,060
Bear!

2673
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,840
Oh my god, thank god.

2674
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:27,520
I got it!

2675
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,740
Harvest the bear!

2676
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:34,700
Oh my goodness, ow!

2677
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:37,560
I'm bleeding.

2678
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:45,180
We need one more skull!

2679
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:53,860
Wait, how many skulls do we have now?

2680
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:03,220
Yeah, someone has a skull.

2681
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:04,000
Who has a skull?

2682
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:06,640
That should be five.

2683
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:07,840
Should it not?

2684
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:11,020
Oh, you're out of inventory space.

2685
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:16,600
Oh, a rock.

2686
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:17,260
Just for me?

2687
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,280
One last...

2688
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:24,020
Sir Blau, I have an idea.

2689
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:25,000
We could sacrifice...

2690
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:26,520
Wait!

2691
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:28,560
Shoot him!

2692
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:38,960
All I'm saying is that we could send...

2693
02:15:39,590 --> 02:15:42,120
We could send one person to Valhalla.

2694
02:15:51,610 --> 02:15:54,680
We can send one man to Valhalla.

2695
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:57,920
We could sacrifice one person to Valhalla.

2696
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:59,080
I could not.

2697
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:00,220
It's not stolen.

2698
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:01,780
That's why I want you to ride it.

2699
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,800
I want your name on this horse.

2700
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:09,920
I will name this horse Stormrider.

2701
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,260
It was owned by Mendo.

2702
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:16,100
He won't mind.

2703
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:19,780
I know not who this knight is.

2704
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:24,780
We're on a mission.

2705
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,650
Oh my god.

2706
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:38,250
Fucking Elem's voice just cutting in and out.

2707
02:16:38,650 --> 02:16:41,190
It's just cutting in and out there.

2708
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:47,430
We just need one more.

2709
02:16:49,730 --> 02:16:52,270
Wait, is that a church over there?

2710
02:16:57,590 --> 02:16:59,370
It is a church.

2711
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:03,210
Aren't there people in churches?

2712
02:17:06,010 --> 02:17:08,370
Wouldn't there be people in churches?

2713
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:24,910
Don't we raid churches as Vikings, sir?

2714
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:26,870
No.

2715
02:17:27,810 --> 02:17:29,930
Don't we pillage and raid?

2716
02:17:30,510 --> 02:17:31,990
And take their women?

2717
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:33,390
And children?

2718
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,890
Those are the East Vikings.

2719
02:17:37,070 --> 02:17:37,710
We're the West.

2720
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:52,010
You're having a meeting, sir.

2721
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:54,750
We are the West.

2722
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:55,590
Amen.

2723
02:18:00,470 --> 02:18:00,830
Amen.

2724
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:04,150
Amen.

2725
02:18:04,710 --> 02:18:05,070
Amen.

2726
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:07,350
Amen.

2727
02:18:08,570 --> 02:18:08,850
Amen.

2728
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:08,970
Amen.

2729
02:18:08,970 --> 02:18:08,990
Yeah!

2730
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:11,110
I'm being baptized.

2731
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:12,610
I'm being baptized.

2732
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:13,170
Don't tell anybody.

2733
02:18:13,170 --> 02:18:14,210
I think it's a fucking cult.

2734
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:15,210
I think it's a cult.

2735
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,150
I don't know how to get out.

2736
02:18:16,150 --> 02:18:16,770
Don't tell them.

2737
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:18,290
I think it's a cult and I'm stuck.

2738
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:19,170
It's a cult.

2739
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:21,910
Would you like to join us to speak the cult?

2740
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:23,490
Oh, it's in my eye!

2741
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:24,790
Oh, no!

2742
02:18:25,650 --> 02:18:26,010
Run!

2743
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:30,650
I can't see!

2744
02:18:31,230 --> 02:18:32,830
We got it in my eye!

2745
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:35,310
We got it in my eyes!

2746
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,780
I think that's an orangey right there, Goomy.

2747
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:45,580
I think you're having an orangey.

2748
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:46,940
I know.

2749
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:49,380
I saw some white stuff earlier.

2750
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:50,360
That was crazy.

2751
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:53,220
It's like a lot of skulls to me.

2752
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:58,980
Take the horses.

2753
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,540
Take the horses.

2754
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:03,220
They have a metal horse.

2755
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:04,920
Where is it?

2756
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:05,860
Where is it?

2757
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:11,340
Hello.

2758
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:15,020
Hello, my children.

2759
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:17,340
There's a horse.

2760
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,680
There's a horse.

2761
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:21,000
There's a horse.

2762
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:22,540
I'm going over.

2763
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,660
There's a horse.

2764
02:19:37,380 --> 02:19:39,660
I'm taking their horse.

2765
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:45,140
Wait, that's our horse?

2766
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:45,600
Oh, okay.

2767
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:53,520
We need one more skull and we need to take the skulls and the horses back.

2768
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:55,840
Who will be a sacrifice for a skull?

2769
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:02,400
You will go to Valhalla if you sacrifice yourself.

2770
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:03,900
The gods will recognize you.

2771
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:07,720
I need a brave sacrifice.

2772
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,760
Someone here, stand before me.

2773
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:10,720
We will find somebody.

2774
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:14,040
We should not kill one of our own.

2775
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:16,580
Okay, fine.

2776
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,860
We'll find someone.

2777
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:18,080
You're right.

2778
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:18,760
That's crazy.

2779
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:19,660
Why would we kill one of our own?

2780
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:23,980
I'm just saying Valhalla sounds mighty cool.

2781
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,880
I'm saying Valhalla sounds mighty tempting.

2782
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:38,180
I think a leader would offer himself, no?

2783
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:41,960
We don't actually have a leader.

2784
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,980
We're leaderless.

2785
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:49,440
By the way, guys, we vote on the leader for the day at noon PST tomorrow because we're a democracy.

2786
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:51,140
Whoa, wait!

2787
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,100
Sir Blau, there's so many people up ahead!

2788
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:57,140
They do not wear clothes.

2789
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,200
Hello!

2790
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:08,320
Oh, shit!

2791
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:09,840
Hello!

2792
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:11,280
Hey, Gibby!

2793
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:13,120
Hey!

2794
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:14,880
Hello!

2795
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:17,420
Hello, what's good, bro?

2796
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:19,860
Democratic Vikings!

2797
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:21,720
What's up, bro?

2798
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:24,860
It's the mandem, ain't it, bro?

2799
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:26,580
To the time traveling again.

2800
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:37,800
Thank you, thank you, I love you.

2801
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:40,240
What's going on, boys?

2802
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,280
I'm on my ride right now.

2803
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,060
What is this iron contraption?

2804
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,640
I can't see your name.

2805
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:50,320
Where are you?

2806
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:53,760
It's on my bike!

2807
02:21:56,380 --> 02:21:58,420
Yeah, the time traveling.

2808
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,800
What is this metal contraption?

2809
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:01,940
What's up, yo?

2810
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:06,180
I did it.

2811
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:08,920
I don't want to take those from you.

2812
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:12,960
That's awkward.

2813
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:15,720
Hello!

2814
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:18,220
Hello?

2815
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:20,960
Oh, you're here again!

2816
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:26,780
Long time no talk!

2817
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:32,280
I think I need to take matters to my own hands.

2818
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:37,060
I need to take matters to my own hands.

2819
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:40,280
What if I find a man right now?

2820
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:42,020
We're the Vikings!

2821
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:45,400
Like a person's skull?

2822
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:50,080
Take my skull, Elm.

2823
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:53,340
I have a map for you.

2824
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:58,060
Open up my map.

2825
02:23:02,180 --> 02:23:04,280
We have procured a scar!

2826
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:08,980
What the fuck's wrong with you?

2827
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:12,700
He sacrificed himself for Valhalla!

2828
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:19,340
Don't worry, he shall be welcomed into the gates of Valhalla.

2829
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:29,040
Shall we return home?

2830
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:33,080
Wait, when did I join that?

2831
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:34,100
I don't want to be a peacekeeper.

2832
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:37,640
I think it's if you just don't kill anybody for a while.

2833
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:40,220
Check out this one.

2834
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:42,800
We must return!

2835
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:44,200
We shall return!

2836
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:46,340
My brain does not handle it.

2837
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:50,580
Your technology confused me.

2838
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,940
Elm, Elm, why is your name red, Elm?

2839
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:55,660
My eyes are more crossed.

2840
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:56,960
Hahaha!

2841
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:07,700
We shall return home.

2842
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:09,340
Return home to the fortress.

2843
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,380
I missed the killing, guys.

2844
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:14,040
I miss it.

2845
02:24:14,180 --> 02:24:15,820
We became too weak.

2846
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:19,220
Hikumi, I miss the killings.

2847
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:21,120
We became too weak.

2848
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:24,080
Oh!

2849
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,360
They're on the metal steed!

2850
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,520
How did you get the metal steed?

2851
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:37,200
We have tamed the beast!

2852
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,620
You've tamed the beast?

2853
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:40,140
The beast has been tamed.

2854
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:46,780
Oh my god, the metal serpent!

2855
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,760
We have tamed the beast, my friends.

2856
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:49,100
Oh!

2857
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:50,020
Behind!

2858
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:50,880
Inside!

2859
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:56,800
It's you behind!

2860
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:00,060
It's the apocalypse!

2861
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:08,240
It's the world eater!

2862
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:11,420
It's Ragnarok.

2863
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:15,500
I believe that was Ragnarok that we just saw.

2864
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,280
So that we can become allies.

2865
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:19,760
They're king.

2866
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,920
The great world serpent.

2867
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:25,680
I knew God of War would be handy today.

2868
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:33,720
I don't know if anybody's pointed it out, but every time you take a step, Elim, you squeak.

2869
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:35,460
Yeah.

2870
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:38,500
It's so bad.

2871
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:43,680
He was on the metal steed!

2872
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,620
The metal beast!

2873
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:47,220
He was on Ragnarok!

2874
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:53,440
He was riding Ragnarok!

2875
02:25:57,620 --> 02:26:02,320
If you will deliver the skull, you must take a steed!

2876
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:17,820
I believe the men of my kin is building already.

2877
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:19,680
Sir foolish.

2878
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:29,840
Here is your horse.

2879
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:50,760
Elim, shut your mouth up.

2880
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:52,580
I'm sorry.

2881
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,700
I don't see it through my window.

2882
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:59,020
I'm sad that next week I'll be...

2883
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:01,560
I'm sad next week I'll be...

2884
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:02,620
I have to...

2885
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,120
I have to leave Canada next week.

2886
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:12,720
I wish I could play more.

2887
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:17,100
I wish I could play more.

2888
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:18,220
The first couple of...

2889
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:19,580
Oh... we are we lagging again?

2890
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,660
Oh no, is it the server?

2891
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:23,840
Okay, wait.

2892
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:25,320
No, everybody is moving.

2893
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:26,460
Okay, I need water.

2894
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:28,660
Where's the water?

2895
02:27:28,860 --> 02:27:30,640
Okay, we gotta go to the lake.

2896
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:31,780
I'm dehydrated.

2897
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:36,700
Dehydrated right now.

2898
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:37,940
Is there water nearby?

2899
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:41,080
There are quite slow.

2900
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:42,640
Yeah.

2901
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:46,060
We gotta go to the fortress anyway.

2902
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:47,640
I'm just gonna run straight to the fortress.

2903
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:51,020
Let's see...

2904
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:53,880
I need to head to...

2905
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:56,480
I need to head to the ri... It's okay.

2906
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:57,680
I got food too.

2907
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:00,200
Pumpkin?

2908
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,680
Can pumpkin rehydrate me?

2909
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:02,960
Oh, it can!

2910
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:03,420
Nice!

2911
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:04,760
That's what fruit does.

2912
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:12,780
So much stuff.

2913
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:22,880
Oh my god, I have so much money for gambling.

2914
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:25,420
Cause I've looted so many people.

2915
02:28:25,540 --> 02:28:25,980
Oh wait, no.

2916
02:28:26,100 --> 02:28:27,060
I threw away my scrap.

2917
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:28,060
God damn it!

2918
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:30,060
I threw away all my scrap!

2919
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:31,120
No!

2920
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:36,960
I threw away... I wanna use the bathroom too.

2921
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:38,440
I gotta head back to the fortress.

2922
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,020
I gotta... I need it.

2923
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:41,740
Wait, where am I?

2924
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:44,940
I'm over here.

2925
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:50,440
I need to head to the fortress so I can use the bathroom and be safe.

2926
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:51,380
Yeah!

2927
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,720
Wait, what happened to your cock?

2928
02:28:54,780 --> 02:28:55,700
What happened to your...

2929
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:00,800
Hello!

2930
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:04,000
Hello!

2931
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:05,580
Hello there!

2932
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,140
Hello there!

2933
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:07,140
Squatty Toby!

2934
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:08,320
Hello there!

2935
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:09,140
Hello there!

2936
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:10,820
I'm now going to try hiring...

2937
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:11,980
You know...

2938
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:14,540
We got LM's sicking VC.

2939
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:16,080
I don't know how to fix his VC!

2940
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:17,860
What's your request?

2941
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:18,280
Oh, what are you doing?

2942
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:19,680
Oh, it's...

2943
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:20,480
If you see one of the...

2944
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:22,720
I need to go and collect stuff.

2945
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:24,240
Oh, yeah.

2946
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:25,000
But in where?

2947
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:26,740
Is it...

2948
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:27,400
It is...

2949
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:28,920
There's a big fork.

2950
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,240
There's a lot of us.

2951
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:31,140
I wish...

2952
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:32,300
Come visit...

2953
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:32,780
Really?

2954
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:34,900
Oh, maybe I will.

2955
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:35,920
That's so far.

2956
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,480
I could've done it.

2957
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,040
I could've done it.

2958
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,560
It was very tempting.

2959
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:47,720
How do I fix LM's VC and stuff?

2960
02:29:47,980 --> 02:29:48,280
Wow!

2961
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:50,720
Oh, no.

2962
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:51,720
There's a scientist.

2963
02:29:52,260 --> 02:29:52,960
There's a scientist.

2964
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:54,480
How do I heal?

2965
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:55,600
I don't have heals.

2966
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:57,020
I'm bleeding.

2967
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:57,440
Oh!

2968
02:29:57,440 --> 02:30:03,040
Oh, I might die!

2969
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:06,660
LM, do you have meds?

2970
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:07,760
I'm gonna die!

2971
02:30:08,380 --> 02:30:09,620
LM, do you have bandages?

2972
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:12,540
The floor is down.

2973
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:13,040
The floor.

2974
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:13,940
Do you have bandages?

2975
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:16,600
Here, take this.

2976
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:17,160
Take this.

2977
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:17,800
I need bandages.

2978
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:19,200
Thank you.

2979
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:22,220
Oh, my god.

2980
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:23,880
Okay, I've ended up throwing.

2981
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:24,620
Get your veggies!

2982
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:27,640
I shall eat my veggies.

2983
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:29,860
Thank you.

2984
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:30,340
Thank you.

2985
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:30,540
Thank you.

2986
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:31,980
Thank you for defending me.

2987
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:38,940
Toki's mortal enemy pig.

2988
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:39,860
What the hell?

2989
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:41,160
Did LM not hear me?

2990
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:42,420
I was like, LM!

2991
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,880
Did it fucking heal me?

2992
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:50,200
Okay.

2993
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:52,280
Might as well just eat some pumpkins and heal up.

2994
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:53,240
I gotta eat my veggies.

2995
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:55,180
I was like, LM!

2996
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:55,860
LM!

2997
02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:01,890
Do you think they have...

2998
02:31:01,890 --> 02:31:02,170
Wait.

2999
02:31:02,550 --> 02:31:03,370
They disappeared.

3000
02:31:05,910 --> 02:31:08,390
Gumi and them disappeared from the map.

3001
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:09,310
Where did they go?

3002
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:10,090
Wait.

3003
02:31:10,130 --> 02:31:10,850
They're too far.

3004
02:31:10,930 --> 02:31:12,190
Did they disappear from the...

3005
02:31:12,190 --> 02:31:12,410
Oh, wait.

3006
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:12,550
No.

3007
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:12,990
Did they...

3008
02:31:12,990 --> 02:31:13,230
Oh, no.

3009
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:13,810
They're over there.

3010
02:31:15,930 --> 02:31:17,370
They rode back.

3011
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:25,500
LM is so locked in.

3012
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:27,620
I don't know how I got into this.

3013
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:31,660
I don't know how I suddenly managed to...

3014
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:34,060
From a blood cult to Vikings.

3015
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:35,300
It truly is.

3016
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:36,620
Rust is a beautiful thing.

3017
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:47,340
Just rust things.

3018
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:47,700
Yeah.

3019
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:51,760
Hope you can find...

3020
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:52,960
Hope you can find a bike.

3021
02:31:53,140 --> 02:31:54,920
You mean those metal...

3022
02:31:54,920 --> 02:31:56,420
The metal horses?

3023
02:31:57,020 --> 02:31:57,480
No.

3024
02:31:58,140 --> 02:32:00,180
Technology is...

3025
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:02,600
Valhalla does not welcome metal horses.

3026
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:07,300
Viking is pure honor and fight.

3027
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:14,480
It's all about being welcomed in Valhalla, guys.

3028
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:19,400
Metal steeds are prohibited.

3029
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:23,340
Unless it's Ragnarok.

3030
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:29,080
Thank you for the five gifted subs.

3031
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:29,620
Thank you.

3032
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:30,800
Thank you.

3033
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:32,100
Sir Jett.

3034
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:37,240
There's a gambling leaderboard now, too?

3035
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:39,180
What the fuck?

3036
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:39,480
Wait.

3037
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:40,440
Why are we going this way?

3038
02:32:40,460 --> 02:32:41,260
We're supposed to go this way.

3039
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:42,040
I need to use the bathroom.

3040
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:46,120
I need to head straight to the fortress and fucking deposit all of this.

3041
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:47,620
I need to...

3042
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:52,240
I need to use the bathroom and deposit all of this.

3043
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,100
Yeah.

3044
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:57,000
I'm heading back.

3045
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:00,700
Boomi and Blau are going to donate the skulls.

3046
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:03,460
I will not die to a bear.

3047
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:05,820
To a weak fucking bear.

3048
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:09,220
I have been blessed by the gods.

3049
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:15,280
Is that our home?

3050
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:18,180
Hello?

3051
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:21,180
The bike gang?

3052
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:22,600
They're trying...

3053
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:26,640
They're trying to get human skulls.

3054
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:29,380
They pulled up on me and him while we were here.

3055
02:33:29,380 --> 02:33:31,000
And they asked us for our skulls.

3056
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:32,000
It was Winnie and Coconut.

3057
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:33,200
It's them!

3058
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:34,540
Them!

3059
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:36,980
So they let me go.

3060
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:38,580
So they let me go.

3061
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:41,340
But they are now chasing Lord Blau down the street with Gummi.

3062
02:33:42,820 --> 02:33:43,540
Gummi, yeah.

3063
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:44,940
Wait, you must tell Shaki.

3064
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:47,060
You must tell Shaki what you heard.

3065
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:49,520
He's behind you.

3066
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:50,340
He's behind you.

3067
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,020
Shaki!

3068
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:54,660
There is a gang that's trying to kill us.

3069
02:33:56,620 --> 02:33:57,600
There's a bike gang.

3070
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,520
They're trying to collect human skulls.

3071
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:01,380
Specifically Viking human skulls.

3072
02:34:01,780 --> 02:34:02,760
Oh no.

3073
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:05,660
They are bike gang.

3074
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:07,520
They were circling around here in a mad...

3075
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:08,940
In their metal steeds.

3076
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:10,640
And they...

3077
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:12,780
Yeah, metal steeds.

3078
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:16,940
We must tell Blau about this.

3079
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:19,260
They're chasing him right now.

3080
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:20,580
I'm pretty sure he's chasing...

3081
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:23,160
They're chasing him right now.

3082
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:26,160
Sir Blau perished.

3083
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:27,960
Sir Blau perished.

3084
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:30,080
They got him?

3085
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:31,760
Did they take our skulls?

3086
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:37,520
The...

3087
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:42,140
No!

3088
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:45,300
We must prepare.

3089
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:53,820
Did they get you too?

3090
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:55,220
I'm now naked.

3091
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:56,980
They got him too!

3092
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:58,680
Wait, what was the code?

3093
02:35:01,340 --> 02:35:04,000
I do not know the rune code!

3094
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:09,800
No, I do not.

3095
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:11,700
I didn't bring the cloth with me.

3096
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:13,160
I've been looking for cloth as well.

3097
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:14,360
What is the rune code?

3098
02:35:15,440 --> 02:35:17,140
What is the code to get in?

3099
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:17,900
Oh, here.

3100
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:21,160
It is...

3101
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:22,380
It is...

3102
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:24,820
The old gods.

3103
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:26,780
Oh, okay, yeah.

3104
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:28,860
What is it?

3105
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:30,180
Got it.

3106
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:34,920
Let it be known.

3107
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:37,360
Okay, okay, okay.

3108
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:38,740
We'll put away my materials.

3109
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:42,180
How do I equip arrows?

3110
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:44,560
It is the old gods.

3111
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:45,660
That's the old gods?

3112
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:47,560
That's the old god number?

3113
02:35:48,320 --> 02:35:50,300
That's not a god.

3114
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:52,260
Oh my gosh.

3115
02:35:52,740 --> 02:35:54,160
Look at what I found!

3116
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:55,960
This metal thing.

3117
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,440
What is it?

3118
02:35:58,720 --> 02:35:59,720
That's disgusting.

3119
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:01,580
It's like a picture.

3120
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:03,940
But like, forever.

3121
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:08,080
How do I equip the arrows which I have crafted?

3122
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:21,020
I broke him, I made him OOC.

3123
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:24,180
That picture went forever.

3124
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:29,140
I can't believe you went OOC.

3125
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:35,140
That fucking cracks you.

3126
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:37,680
That fucking breaks your character.

3127
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:48,320
How do I equip arrows?

3128
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:59,700
How do I equip arrows?

3129
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:05,900
Is this bow not what I think it is?

3130
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:12,320
I see.

3131
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:14,740
I see.

3132
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,600
Got it, got it, got it.

3133
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:16,940
It's like throwing a spear, I see.

3134
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:18,600
So shaky.

3135
02:37:18,820 --> 02:37:20,820
I have contraband.

3136
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:23,140
What kind?

3137
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:24,940
I don't know what to do with this.

3138
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:39,190
Well, what you do is you take it and you put it in the box we were just next to.

3139
02:37:39,850 --> 02:37:40,850
That's all you need to do.

3140
02:37:40,950 --> 02:37:42,890
The one down there that's out in the open?

3141
02:37:43,030 --> 02:37:43,930
Yes, exactly.

3142
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:46,410
We're protected by our doors.

3143
02:37:47,970 --> 02:37:48,390
Okay.

3144
02:38:46,990 --> 02:38:48,130
What is that sound?

3145
02:38:50,270 --> 02:38:51,110
It's a beast.

3146
02:38:51,210 --> 02:38:51,870
Sounds like a metal beast.

3147
02:38:54,670 --> 02:38:55,470
Watch out.

3148
02:38:55,610 --> 02:38:56,770
I'm prepared to take it.

3149
02:38:58,110 --> 02:39:01,250
If you have more than two clothing items on, then it will shoot you.

3150
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:03,770
And then it will rocket everything and then we'll all die.

3151
02:39:04,270 --> 02:39:05,150
So make sure...

3152
02:39:05,150 --> 02:39:06,090
Oh, okay.

3153
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:07,970
I will not, I will not, nope.

3154
02:39:08,190 --> 02:39:09,930
I will not be fighting the metal monster.

3155
02:39:10,230 --> 02:39:11,270
I have changed my mind.

3156
02:39:11,410 --> 02:39:11,690
Yep.

3157
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:15,630
Is there a bed by any chance?

3158
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:17,950
Do you have cloth?

3159
02:39:19,650 --> 02:39:21,650
I have 10.

3160
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:24,090
I have 40.

3161
02:39:24,270 --> 02:39:24,890
No, I have leather.

3162
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,890
Shoot.

3163
02:39:29,050 --> 02:39:29,570
Shoot.

3164
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,560
I'm back.

3165
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:47,260
I'm back.

3166
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:48,800
Oh.

3167
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:50,800
Oh my God.

3168
02:40:50,820 --> 02:40:51,120
Sorry.

3169
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:52,620
I needed to get water too.

3170
02:40:52,780 --> 02:40:52,980
Hi.

3171
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:55,740
I didn't realize.

3172
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:59,360
I didn't know what Jackie sounded like outside of role playing.

3173
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:00,560
This is my first time.

3174
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:05,120
This is my first time meeting, like bump, meeting him in rest.

3175
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:13,960
And then like the fact that his voice changed entirely after I fucking broke.

3176
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:16,520
I broke him out of role play.

3177
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:24,280
From like fucking fucking Nordic Viking accent to like fucking gamer bro.

3178
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:29,620
I was not, I was not expecting that.

3179
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:34,520
I didn't realize that they sounded like that.

3180
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:36,220
I was like...

3181
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:45,060
I was just like holy fuck.

3182
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:53,470
Oh my God.

3183
02:41:54,150 --> 02:41:55,330
They'll close the doors.

3184
02:41:55,450 --> 02:41:56,050
They'll be fine.

3185
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:57,490
They'll be fine.

3186
02:41:57,570 --> 02:41:58,150
They'll close the doors.

3187
02:41:58,210 --> 02:41:59,010
There's people there.

3188
02:41:59,990 --> 02:42:00,890
I want to see if they're...

3189
02:42:00,890 --> 02:42:01,570
Oh, wait.

3190
02:42:01,630 --> 02:42:02,350
They're coming back.

3191
02:42:04,750 --> 02:42:05,870
There's people there.

3192
02:42:07,230 --> 02:42:10,210
I did not expect that to be his real voice.

3193
02:42:10,410 --> 02:42:13,130
Like I legitimately was like so surprised.

3194
02:42:16,330 --> 02:42:18,570
Have any of you guys got the drops yet?

3195
02:42:19,310 --> 02:42:20,710
You guys got the AK drop?

3196
02:42:22,850 --> 02:42:27,630
I'll just be like Odin came to me in a dream.

3197
02:42:30,110 --> 02:42:32,590
He gave me this magic stick.

3198
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:34,350
And then maybe they'll let me.

3199
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:35,910
That's like plus one RP right there.

3200
02:42:38,390 --> 02:42:39,270
No, I'm good.

3201
02:42:39,310 --> 02:42:40,730
I have a sleeping bag already inside.

3202
02:42:42,990 --> 02:42:46,390
Oh, did you manage to deliver the skulls?

3203
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:58,230
Where did...

3204
02:42:58,230 --> 02:43:04,510
Where did the metal steed gang go?

3205
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:12,630
They're across the bridge?

3206
02:43:12,730 --> 02:43:14,010
Oh, that's dangerous.

3207
02:43:19,070 --> 02:43:19,670
Alright.

3208
02:43:20,010 --> 02:43:21,350
That's good that you guys got it.

3209
02:43:23,570 --> 02:43:24,250
Wait.

3210
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:26,570
That code doesn't work?

3211
02:43:27,590 --> 02:43:29,110
Must be in the back only then.

3212
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:34,280
The front code doesn't work.

3213
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:35,040
Hey!

3214
02:43:35,780 --> 02:43:36,680
How was it?

3215
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:38,540
How was delivering the skulls?

3216
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:43,380
What was the deal?

3217
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:46,900
Oh, so you guys had to hunt again?

3218
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:51,540
You guys had to hunt again?

3219
02:43:53,480 --> 02:43:54,040
Wait.

3220
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:58,160
We need a stable to house our horses.

3221
02:43:58,340 --> 02:43:59,860
Who shall take this task?

3222
02:44:02,860 --> 02:44:04,180
I can do it, my lord.

3223
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:04,940
I got this, my lord.

3224
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:05,500
I'm happy to.

3225
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:08,000
Sir, Demo.

3226
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:09,600
Yes.

3227
02:44:10,220 --> 02:44:12,660
I now grant you the title of stable master.

3228
02:44:14,980 --> 02:44:15,460
Yes.

3229
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:16,300
Thank you.

3230
02:44:17,140 --> 02:44:17,620
Yes.

3231
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:18,380
Oh, wow.

3232
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:21,800
Build us a stable fit for our ranging horses.

3233
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:23,660
Let's find a spot for this.

3234
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:26,740
Oh, my God.

3235
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:27,620
The stable master.

3236
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,480
He shall take care of the horses, right?

3237
02:44:30,980 --> 02:44:32,460
What shall I do with this?

3238
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:34,560
It should be next to the towers.

3239
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:36,480
Right here, sir.

3240
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:37,460
I love the horses.

3241
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,480
Do you know how to build like a trough?

3242
02:44:39,660 --> 02:44:41,860
And like, you know, all the stuff that...

3243
02:44:41,860 --> 02:44:42,640
Build it right here.

3244
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:43,120
Yeah.

3245
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:44,640
Right here?

3246
02:44:45,220 --> 02:44:45,540
Perfect.

3247
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:47,260
I will get to work right away, my lord.

3248
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:49,080
I won't let you down.

3249
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:49,900
Sir, Demo.

3250
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:51,020
Make it aesthetic.

3251
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:51,600
Yeah.

3252
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:56,340
What happens if he doesn't make it aesthetic?

3253
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:01,740
I'm just wondering.

3254
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:04,340
You gotta have like some motivation.

3255
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:06,740
Some motivation to build a nice stable.

3256
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,980
You don't wanna half-ass it.

3257
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:14,740
Alright.

3258
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:16,260
I wanna...

3259
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:19,180
High five with this title.

3260
02:45:19,380 --> 02:45:20,280
Well, but...

3261
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:22,480
Yeah, but the stable is much more important.

3262
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:24,860
Yes.

3263
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:29,100
A metal frog?

3264
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:33,980
What is that?

3265
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:38,240
I also need some cloth.

3266
02:45:43,060 --> 02:45:45,480
Why is he...

3267
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:50,540
He's a biker gang?

3268
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:51,960
Do we take him out?

3269
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:53,220
He's in our territory.

3270
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:05,060
What do we do with him, Blau?

3271
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:08,420
He's a pargarian.

3272
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:09,580
We need to have a truce with him.

3273
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:12,920
What were the tales of the biker gang?

3274
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:13,680
Where did they go?

3275
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:15,720
They left.

3276
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:16,320
I don't know.

3277
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:18,060
Someone else came and drove them out.

3278
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:20,560
We need revenge on them.

3279
02:46:20,980 --> 02:46:22,440
Where do they live?

3280
02:46:23,480 --> 02:46:24,040
I need...

3281
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:25,120
Wait, you did?

3282
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:25,580
I don't know.

3283
02:46:25,700 --> 02:46:26,440
I'm sorry, you're right.

3284
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:28,260
I need one human skull though.

3285
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:30,380
My kings gave me a mission.

3286
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,580
I need one human skull.

3287
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:34,280
You bet not for the free people.

3288
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:37,740
I've made trades with Dimoke.

3289
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:39,000
He vouches for me.

3290
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:42,860
I might have sold him a skull, guys.

3291
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:44,080
I might have sold him one skull.

3292
02:46:44,340 --> 02:46:44,600
Rangers!

3293
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:48,820
I assign Rangers, Jackie, Dragon, and Elum.

3294
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:50,420
Go out with Sir Wicked.

3295
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:51,600
Get a skull.

3296
02:46:52,420 --> 02:46:53,620
What will you give us in return?

3297
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:55,600
What do you need?

3298
02:46:57,360 --> 02:46:59,240
Oh, Lady Doki, you go with them as well.

3299
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:01,080
We need a skull.

3300
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:02,120
We need 50 pumpkin seeds.

3301
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:05,700
What do you need?

3302
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:06,200
I'm sorry?

3303
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:08,300
We need to get a skull.

3304
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:09,280
We need cloth.

3305
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:10,120
Do you have any cloth?

3306
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:11,800
We need lots of cloth.

3307
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:13,460
I don't have more cloth.

3308
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:14,340
Oh.

3309
02:47:14,980 --> 02:47:16,720
Rangers, go out with Sir Wicked.

3310
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:17,480
I can feed you.

3311
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:18,620
I'll stay here at the cold stone.

3312
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:19,180
I can feed you.

3313
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:22,860
This will feed your family for generations.

3314
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:26,980
You guys don't like pumpkin?

3315
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:27,680
Oh, okay.

3316
02:47:28,140 --> 02:47:29,280
We eat meat.

3317
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:30,760
We know we love pumpkins, right guys?

3318
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:31,600
Wait.

3319
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:32,660
Meat?

3320
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:33,540
I don't really.

3321
02:47:33,540 --> 02:47:35,260
I don't really like pumpkin, to be honest.

3322
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:37,120
We don't eat our veggies.

3323
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:37,660
We're Vikings.

3324
02:47:37,980 --> 02:47:38,580
How about some corn?

3325
02:47:39,080 --> 02:47:39,740
Do you want some corn?

3326
02:47:41,160 --> 02:47:42,420
Oh, you're corn people.

3327
02:47:44,740 --> 02:47:45,780
Corn and meat.

3328
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:46,880
That's all we eat here.

3329
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:48,160
Corn and meat.

3330
02:47:48,320 --> 02:47:49,380
What a lovely diet.

3331
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:50,640
Corn and meat.

3332
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:52,740
We must find a skull.

3333
02:47:53,220 --> 02:47:54,160
Onwards go for you.

3334
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:55,260
This is a quest for you.

3335
02:47:55,360 --> 02:47:56,660
We've hired a hit squad now.

3336
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:57,080
It's time.

3337
02:47:57,640 --> 02:47:59,200
It's time to go and find people.

3338
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:02,360
We are on a new mission.

3339
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:06,680
We're on a new mission now.

3340
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:13,960
We must travel the bridge if we want to find skulls.

3341
02:48:20,660 --> 02:48:23,020
How did I become the leader?

3342
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:25,880
Bro, I feel like we're like mercenaries now.

3343
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,480
How do we lure them in?

3344
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:31,200
What's our way of trying to lure them in before they just run away?

3345
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:33,660
Maybe we put our bows away.

3346
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:35,960
Yeah, we put our bows away and say we're here to trade.

3347
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:37,100
I'll bring a corn out.

3348
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:38,520
We pretend, yes.

3349
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:39,580
We pretend to be traders.

3350
02:48:39,700 --> 02:48:40,360
We pretend to be...

3351
02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:42,660
Shaki, what is our code again?

3352
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:44,160
What is our signal?

3353
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,080
What is our signal, Shaki?

3354
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:48,980
You're gonna die right now!

3355
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:52,060
That's a good one.

3356
02:48:52,420 --> 02:48:53,680
That was a great signal.

3357
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:54,920
They'll never see it coming.

3358
02:48:55,910 --> 02:48:57,360
They'll never know.

3359
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:10,120
How would they know?

3360
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:12,720
How would they fucking know?

3361
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:17,300
Wait, Squire John is already asleep?

3362
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:17,860
No.

3363
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:20,320
Oh, the Lurklings, this is...

3364
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:21,740
Honestly, we've been doing fantastic.

3365
02:49:21,820 --> 02:49:22,840
We've grown by numbers.

3366
02:49:23,500 --> 02:49:24,340
Pretty quickly.

3367
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:26,460
On the third day, we shall be blessed.

3368
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:30,560
I came here with two people and now your tribe is huge.

3369
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:32,340
We have grown.

3370
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:34,660
You did come at a time when everybody had left.

3371
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:37,100
Wait, bear?

3372
02:49:37,700 --> 02:49:38,900
Wait, bear?

3373
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:40,360
I need cloth.

3374
02:49:41,780 --> 02:49:42,500
How many arrows do I have?

3375
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:43,400
Oh, I have 34.

3376
02:49:43,740 --> 02:49:44,920
Yeah, we have...

3377
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:46,720
Wait, he is guarding a package!

3378
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:48,940
A body!

3379
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:50,720
He's guarding a body!

3380
02:49:50,980 --> 02:49:51,280
Skull!

3381
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:53,420
The bear has given!

3382
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:59,080
Get your cloth!

3383
02:50:05,860 --> 02:50:07,820
Oh my, he has a key!

3384
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:10,840
Yes, way to go, guys.

3385
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:11,520
Way to go.

3386
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:15,080
I told you, we cross the bridge and we find the skull.

3387
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:18,240
You're so wise.

3388
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:19,160
You're so wise.

3389
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:20,060
Thank you, Lurklings.

3390
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:22,440
Blessed be the Lurklings.

3391
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:24,180
What?

3392
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:26,880
I'm so sorry.

3393
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:27,800
Sorry?

3394
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:28,720
I tapped out my brain.

3395
02:50:28,900 --> 02:50:29,080
Sorry?

3396
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:30,060
I tapped out my brain.

3397
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:31,420
Elom has neurodegeneration.

3398
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:34,960
We had to perform a surgery on his head.

3399
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:35,560
It's okay.

3400
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:37,620
I'm British.

3401
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:38,340
I'm British.

3402
02:50:38,460 --> 02:50:39,740
I just get crazy with knives.

3403
02:50:39,800 --> 02:50:40,240
I'm sorry.

3404
02:50:41,660 --> 02:50:43,980
Yes, we took him from his home and raised him.

3405
02:50:44,020 --> 02:50:45,620
But he still has the British in him.

3406
02:50:51,060 --> 02:50:51,940
I'm sorry.

3407
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:53,500
It's not fixable.

3408
02:50:59,140 --> 02:51:00,920
Did you guys take my stuff?

3409
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,280
Wait, that was you?

3410
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:03,800
I got killed by the bear.

3411
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:10,560
Yeah, we found your body, but it was already...

3412
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:12,600
It was already, like, dead.

3413
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:15,120
Like, we found your backpack.

3414
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:17,980
That's...

3415
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:20,080
We'll find the murderer.

3416
02:51:20,300 --> 02:51:22,420
We'll find the person who vultured your stuff.

3417
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:27,700
Sorry.

3418
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:29,480
Consolation prize.

3419
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:29,960
That was awkward.

3420
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:30,740
Here, here.

3421
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:31,980
The animal that took your life.

3422
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:35,180
I can't drop anything.

3423
02:51:35,180 --> 02:51:35,720
Here you go.

3424
02:51:35,720 --> 02:51:36,820
I found this.

3425
02:51:36,820 --> 02:51:37,540
I can't drop anything.

3426
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:38,360
You can take this.

3427
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:39,180
Here, have my shorts.

3428
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:40,780
You deserve them.

3429
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:42,380
If I...

3430
02:51:42,380 --> 02:51:42,700
Hold on.

3431
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:44,360
Just any minute now.

3432
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:45,200
We can...

3433
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:46,140
Just any...

3434
02:51:46,140 --> 02:51:46,440
Hold on.

3435
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:46,960
Come up here.

3436
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:47,440
Come up here.

3437
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:49,120
Oh, it's because we're on the bridge.

3438
02:51:49,240 --> 02:51:49,640
Yes.

3439
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:50,620
Here, here.

3440
02:51:50,680 --> 02:51:51,400
I found this.

3441
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:52,840
I found this.

3442
02:51:52,900 --> 02:51:53,800
You can take this.

3443
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:56,160
Wait, why can't I throw stuff?

3444
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:03,340
Oh, and this doesn't fit my style, so you should have this too.

3445
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:05,220
Here, join a band.

3446
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:08,300
Join a band?

3447
02:52:12,590 --> 02:52:16,030
You look better than you probably did before, I'll be honest.

3448
02:52:17,270 --> 02:52:17,870
Yeah, yeah.

3449
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:20,650
I don't know what you had on before, but this is definitely better.

3450
02:52:22,750 --> 02:52:25,370
Do you wish to join the Lurklings?

3451
02:52:26,430 --> 02:52:29,130
You bow to renounce all gods and kings.

3452
02:52:30,510 --> 02:52:31,270
He's always...

3453
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:32,530
Except for the old and new gods.

3454
02:52:33,870 --> 02:52:34,830
I thought...

3455
02:52:34,830 --> 02:52:38,050
Yeah, I thought he was already in the Lurklings.

3456
02:52:38,290 --> 02:52:40,130
He's been building stuff for us, Blau.

3457
02:52:40,970 --> 02:52:42,530
Oh, is he?

3458
02:52:44,070 --> 02:52:44,550
Oh.

3459
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:46,930
That's a little awkward.

3460
02:52:47,410 --> 02:52:49,010
That's a little awkward.

3461
02:52:54,310 --> 02:52:59,530
Bro, this guy Blau already hit me, so I'm running as fast as I can to get away from him.

3462
02:53:01,210 --> 02:53:02,650
What's he doing in...

3463
02:53:03,090 --> 02:53:05,310
What is he doing in Lurkling territory?

3464
02:53:06,330 --> 02:53:10,590
Sir Blau, sir Blau, sir Blau, sorry, sorry, my sire, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3465
02:53:10,770 --> 02:53:11,970
He's kneeling, he's kneeling!

3466
02:53:12,490 --> 02:53:13,570
We do not kneel.

3467
02:53:14,050 --> 02:53:15,170
We do not kneel.

3468
02:53:15,190 --> 02:53:15,610
Oh, no kneeling?

3469
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:16,510
Oh, sorry, no kneeling.

3470
02:53:16,870 --> 02:53:18,670
Sorry, I'll take it back, I'll take it back, I'm so sorry.

3471
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:19,550
They don't kneel.

3472
02:53:19,730 --> 02:53:23,750
We don't do anything but wood and stuff, and they don't kneel to anyone.

3473
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:25,290
They renounce all gods and kings.

3474
02:53:26,610 --> 02:53:27,150
Oh, okay.

3475
02:53:27,150 --> 02:53:30,670
I don't know your preferences, but I do not do wood.

3476
02:53:32,210 --> 02:53:34,130
Blau, I wish to propose something.

3477
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:36,730
No, not food, woods.

3478
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:38,010
Oh my god, they're gonna get married.

3479
02:53:39,750 --> 02:53:40,710
Take this.

3480
02:53:41,950 --> 02:53:42,650
Thank you.

3481
02:53:43,710 --> 02:53:46,970
Hey, what did I miss?

3482
02:53:47,490 --> 02:53:50,090
We got the skull, we did our mission.

3483
02:53:53,190 --> 02:53:54,230
Well, um...

3484
02:53:54,230 --> 02:53:54,590
I know.

3485
02:53:54,590 --> 02:53:57,590
Well, did you guys, uh...

3486
02:53:58,570 --> 02:53:59,430
I'll see if you can...

3487
02:53:59,430 --> 02:54:00,410
I'm going this way.

3488
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:02,950
What's your mission?

3489
02:54:03,090 --> 02:54:04,290
Oh, he ran off into the woods.

3490
02:54:05,330 --> 02:54:06,270
He ran off, yeah.

3491
02:54:06,270 --> 02:54:08,690
I'm going to meet my friends.

3492
02:54:08,830 --> 02:54:09,170
Oh!

3493
02:54:09,770 --> 02:54:11,210
Foxbox and others.

3494
02:54:13,430 --> 02:54:17,050
Do you think, do you think they have metal lizards now?

3495
02:54:20,680 --> 02:54:22,440
They don't do that kind of...

3496
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:23,240
They don't?

3497
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:24,920
What are they, what are they part of?

3498
02:54:27,020 --> 02:54:31,080
I think they're part of the new world.

3499
02:54:31,460 --> 02:54:32,200
The new world?

3500
02:54:32,380 --> 02:54:33,420
What's the new world?

3501
02:54:34,500 --> 02:54:36,300
Are you abandoning us?

3502
02:54:37,340 --> 02:54:37,680
No.

3503
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:39,960
She has friends at the new world.

3504
02:54:40,740 --> 02:54:43,440
I'm making alliances for us.

3505
02:54:43,840 --> 02:54:45,040
We must go with her.

3506
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:46,140
Protection.

3507
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:48,040
We must protect our own.

3508
02:54:50,260 --> 02:54:52,660
They found land across the ocean?

3509
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:54,580
Standing for Rapidash 15.

3510
02:54:55,580 --> 02:54:58,000
What are these magic words you're saying?

3511
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:02,440
She's speaking in tongues.

3512
02:55:04,660 --> 02:55:07,820
Skip to the toilet, riz, riz, ya, w's.

3513
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:12,000
Is this the new world language you're speaking of, Gooby?

3514
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:15,320
Aye, dokey.

3515
02:55:19,440 --> 02:55:20,900
Ragnarok taught me it.

3516
02:55:23,300 --> 02:55:25,380
Ragnarok stands for Rizzler.

3517
02:55:26,040 --> 02:55:28,400
What does the A stand for?

3518
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:34,660
Oh, I know what G stands for.

3519
02:55:34,900 --> 02:55:42,840
I wonder what the G stands for.

3520
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:47,220
Gamer goo.

3521
02:55:53,480 --> 02:55:54,160
That's

3522
02:55:58,600 --> 02:56:00,360
a surname, man.

3523
02:56:01,800 --> 02:56:04,220
Wait, where are they on the map?

3524
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:05,860
You know, like Gyatabayo.

3525
02:56:07,300 --> 02:56:07,980
Gyatabayo?

3526
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:10,720
Did you literally just say Gyatabayo?

3527
02:56:10,720 --> 02:56:10,980
Lily!

3528
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:17,800
I would recommend you should not follow us.

3529
02:56:18,980 --> 02:56:21,240
We're going on a really long run.

3530
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:25,940
Wait, where is it on the map?

3531
02:56:26,620 --> 02:56:27,880
Where is it on the map?

3532
02:56:38,230 --> 02:56:40,570
Oh my, okay, let's go.

3533
02:56:48,510 --> 02:56:50,630
Okay, okay, yeah.

3534
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:52,390
Yeah.

3535
02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:04,750
It's all about Valhalla!

3536
02:57:05,970 --> 02:57:07,790
It's all about Valhalla!

3537
02:57:08,610 --> 02:57:11,130
But on the third day, they say...

3538
02:57:11,130 --> 02:57:17,310
I don't even know what I'm known as anymore.

3539
02:57:19,850 --> 02:57:20,890
Another pilgrimage.

3540
02:57:25,570 --> 02:57:27,670
You became the leader of the rangers?

3541
02:57:31,650 --> 02:57:32,850
Oh my god, I don't know.

3542
02:57:32,990 --> 02:57:35,030
I can't believe I'm doing another pilgrimage.

3543
02:57:35,270 --> 02:57:36,550
I thought this was over.

3544
02:57:36,550 --> 02:57:41,110
I thought... I thought these ways are behind me.

3545
02:57:43,270 --> 02:57:45,350
Maybe we can find a metal seed.

3546
02:57:45,830 --> 02:57:47,150
They'll never know.

3547
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:54,060
They'll never know if we...

3548
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:56,980
They'll never know if we took one of them.

3549
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:58,400
How would they know?

3550
02:57:59,320 --> 02:58:00,460
Odin will never know.

3551
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:06,260
Oh my god, we can say... No, no, no, we'll say that...

3552
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:08,960
Oh bear, oh shit!

3553
02:58:11,440 --> 02:58:12,680
I'm sorry!

3554
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:18,300
I'm panicked, I'm panicked!

3555
02:58:18,860 --> 02:58:20,060
No, I'm sorry!

3556
02:58:29,300 --> 02:58:36,340
No, I forgot to...

3557
02:58:36,340 --> 02:58:37,620
Where am I?

3558
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:40,760
Okay, I forgot to sleep in the sleeping bag.

3559
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:41,540
Did I not?

3560
02:58:42,620 --> 02:58:44,300
Oh, I'll just make you a bag.

3561
02:58:44,400 --> 02:58:45,620
Just wait.

3562
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:47,840
I'm gonna go drown.

3563
02:58:48,340 --> 02:58:50,740
I'm gonna go drown.

3564
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:52,940
Be in the water.

3565
02:58:53,100 --> 02:58:54,240
Let me drown!

3566
02:58:54,980 --> 02:58:57,320
Let me drown in the water.

3567
02:59:00,080 --> 02:59:01,480
First F1 in time.

3568
02:59:01,580 --> 02:59:03,360
Okay, I need to know if it doesn't show my console.

3569
02:59:03,960 --> 02:59:05,660
I need to know if it doesn't...

3570
02:59:06,820 --> 02:59:08,540
Oh my god.

3571
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:13,900
Okay, slash kill.

3572
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:17,620
Oh my god.

3573
02:59:17,700 --> 02:59:18,380
Wait, how do I...

3574
02:59:18,380 --> 02:59:19,380
This is slash kill?

3575
02:59:19,880 --> 02:59:21,160
What was the kill command?

3576
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:22,100
What is it?

3577
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:27,320
There's no kill.

3578
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:27,680
Okay.

3579
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:29,900
Oh my god.

3580
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:33,140
You hurt me!

3581
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:35,520
Odin hurt me!

3582
02:59:37,440 --> 02:59:39,320
You hurt me!

3583
02:59:39,320 --> 02:59:39,480
You hurt me!

3584
02:59:40,060 --> 02:59:41,820
Oh my god!

3585
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:44,960
I can't even have to wait to 100!

3586
02:59:45,100 --> 02:59:46,580
I'm just progressive.

3587
02:59:49,340 --> 02:59:50,040
Alright.

3588
02:59:55,780 --> 02:59:57,200
Oh my god.

3589
02:59:57,680 --> 02:59:59,320
Oh my god.

3590
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:01,380
Oh my god.

3591
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:02,240
Here I go.

3592
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:03,640
Odin hurt me.

3593
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:05,100
Sorry.

3594
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:08,020
I shall never have these thoughts again, Odin.

3595
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:11,400
I shall never have these thoughts again.

3596
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:12,280
Hello.

3597
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:19,760
The all-seeing father, Odin.

3598
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:22,020
He hurt...

3599
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:26,340
I got killed by a bear again!

3600
03:00:28,380 --> 03:00:30,400
He got me!

3601
03:00:31,380 --> 03:00:32,480
He got me!

3602
03:00:32,720 --> 03:00:39,520
It's almost like the bear curse...

3603
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:42,640
The bear curse has hit me yet again!

3604
03:00:44,740 --> 03:00:46,980
Yes, I shall respawn.

3605
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:48,660
I shall die here.

3606
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:51,500
I shall die here.

3607
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:53,000
Alright, I'll wait.

3608
03:00:54,440 --> 03:00:56,080
I'm just gonna wait.

3609
03:00:56,680 --> 03:00:58,220
I don't wanna travel.

3610
03:00:58,800 --> 03:01:00,980
I'll just get a heart attack.

3611
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:06,440
The curse never left!

3612
03:01:06,940 --> 03:01:12,120
I had some impure thoughts.

3613
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:16,880
The impure...

3614
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:17,820
I'm sorry.

3615
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:19,920
I shall never have those thoughts again.

3616
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:23,170
I shall never think of such...

3617
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:25,620
heinous thoughts in my head.

3618
03:01:30,450 --> 03:01:32,480
Oh my god.

3619
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:34,100
Alright.

3620
03:01:36,900 --> 03:01:40,080
Dude, we're fine.

3621
03:01:40,340 --> 03:01:41,140
We're fine.

3622
03:01:41,380 --> 03:01:42,060
We'll just wait.

3623
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:42,900
I can wait.

3624
03:01:44,600 --> 03:01:46,860
That's why you never...

3625
03:01:46,860 --> 03:01:48,520
Never betray Odin.

3626
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:58,940
Oh my god.

3627
03:02:03,020 --> 03:02:04,120
Oh my god.

3628
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:04,680
I'm so...

3629
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:07,000
I'm so tired.

3630
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:09,180
I'm so tired from...

3631
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:12,580
I'm so tired from the fucking bears.

3632
03:02:13,140 --> 03:02:17,360
The fucking bears!

3633
03:02:18,380 --> 03:02:20,540
They'll never leave me alone.

3634
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:24,640
I let my guard down.

3635
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:26,200
I let my...

3636
03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:28,200
Guard down.

3637
03:02:28,540 --> 03:02:30,220
For like 5 seconds.

3638
03:02:30,660 --> 03:02:32,100
Like the one time...

3639
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:35,040
The one time I finally let my guard down.

3640
03:02:35,260 --> 03:02:36,500
They came back.

3641
03:02:39,080 --> 03:02:39,760
No,

3642
03:02:44,840 --> 03:02:45,440
I'm waiting.

3643
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:48,500
I have 95 seconds left.

3644
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:52,420
95 seconds till I can come back.

3645
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:55,560
They were waiting for this very moment.

3646
03:02:55,560 --> 03:02:57,900
They give the 100 minis pass.

3647
03:02:58,060 --> 03:02:58,140
No!

3648
03:03:00,840 --> 03:03:04,580
I was promised that the bears will be friendly.

3649
03:03:05,560 --> 03:03:13,560
I was promised by Valhalla that they would be friendly and they'll be my friend.

3650
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:14,800
What happened?

3651
03:03:15,160 --> 03:03:17,640
Is it because of my impure thoughts?

3652
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:18,220
Chat?

3653
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,880
Is it because of my thoughts?

3654
03:03:21,420 --> 03:03:23,620
It was just one little thought.

3655
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:28,440
What?

3656
03:03:29,900 --> 03:03:31,880
The impure thoughts tainted thee.

3657
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:35,520
Yes, you were punished.

3658
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:38,620
I was punished for the...

3659
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:42,600
I'll never think about the metal horses again.

3660
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:43,520
I swear.

3661
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:46,280
But it's somebody just happened.

3662
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:52,600
It's somebody just happened to like, gave me it.

3663
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:54,520
Like, I wouldn't say no.

3664
03:03:54,920 --> 03:04:00,040
I just won't actively search for it if it just happens to come to me.

3665
03:04:01,140 --> 03:04:02,480
In a dream.

3666
03:04:04,480 --> 03:04:06,860
Then like, is that truly...

3667
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:09,460
Is it truly blasphemy at that point?

3668
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:10,360
Is it...

3669
03:04:10,360 --> 03:04:11,800
Is it?

3670
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:21,080
Is it really blasphemy if it just showed up in my inventory?

3671
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:23,320
A gift shouldn't be a problem.

3672
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:24,760
Yeah!

3673
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:26,080
I am back.

3674
03:04:26,320 --> 03:04:27,340
Okay, where's my stuff?

3675
03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:31,580
Where'd my stuff go?

3676
03:04:32,620 --> 03:04:33,300
Gumi!

3677
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:36,560
Where's my stuff?

3678
03:04:38,460 --> 03:04:39,240
Where is it?

3679
03:04:43,320 --> 03:04:44,280
Thank you.

3680
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:48,980
It's because we talked about the metal steed, Gumi.

3681
03:04:49,640 --> 03:04:52,740
We talked about the metal steed and we got punished.

3682
03:04:54,300 --> 03:04:55,920
We got punished for it.

3683
03:04:59,060 --> 03:05:00,240
No, I heard you.

3684
03:05:00,400 --> 03:05:01,140
You said it too.

3685
03:05:01,240 --> 03:05:02,900
You were thinking about it too.

3686
03:05:03,260 --> 03:05:04,160
Don't lie to me.

3687
03:05:04,660 --> 03:05:05,580
You were thinking about it.

3688
03:05:05,640 --> 03:05:06,520
Odin will punish you.

3689
03:05:06,620 --> 03:05:07,560
You were thinking about it.

3690
03:05:10,960 --> 03:05:12,880
Because I was thinking it loud.

3691
03:05:12,940 --> 03:05:14,520
It's because I was thinking it louder.

3692
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:15,640
I was thinking it louder.

3693
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:17,760
Anyway, as I was saying...

3694
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:19,020
As I was saying...

3695
03:05:19,020 --> 03:05:20,760
If a bear...

3696
03:05:20,760 --> 03:05:21,640
Sorry, not bear.

3697
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:22,700
No more bears, please.

3698
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:25,440
But...

3699
03:05:26,500 --> 03:05:27,960
I was saying...

3700
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:28,980
If...

3701
03:05:28,980 --> 03:05:31,260
We walked over and...

3702
03:05:31,260 --> 03:05:33,340
We happened...

3703
03:05:33,340 --> 03:05:34,540
Oh, it's a scientist.

3704
03:05:34,700 --> 03:05:34,940
Okay.

3705
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:36,560
I was saying like...

3706
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:37,300
Oh!

3707
03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:42,600
Hello?

3708
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:43,720
Hello?

3709
03:05:44,240 --> 03:05:44,940
Hello?

3710
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:48,340
Hello, everybody.

3711
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:49,660
Hey!

3712
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:52,340
I just... I'm a tourist here.

3713
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:54,820
I'm just a little tourist.

3714
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:55,160
See?

3715
03:05:55,300 --> 03:05:56,240
I'm here sightseeing.

3716
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:57,180
Birdwatching.

3717
03:05:58,220 --> 03:06:00,660
I was finding a blue-crested sparrow.

3718
03:06:01,340 --> 03:06:01,860
Friend?

3719
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:03,060
It was no friend.

3720
03:06:03,140 --> 03:06:03,920
It was just me.

3721
03:06:04,920 --> 03:06:06,380
I'm just birdwatching.

3722
03:06:06,420 --> 03:06:08,020
I saw a blue-crested sparrow.

3723
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:14,100
I saw a blue-crested sparrow in the trees and I was just following the path.

3724
03:06:14,460 --> 03:06:15,640
I'm just a...

3725
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:17,640
There was a...

3726
03:06:18,320 --> 03:06:19,080
There was a... No!

3727
03:06:19,220 --> 03:06:21,360
I followed a blue-crested sparrow right here.

3728
03:06:21,440 --> 03:06:22,400
Why would I have binoculars?

3729
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:23,800
I was birdwatching right here.

3730
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:29,200
Okay.

3731
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:33,900
Okay.

3732
03:06:33,900 --> 03:06:34,720
What do we got over here?

3733
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:36,700
What do we got over here?

3734
03:06:39,640 --> 03:06:41,200
Who are you?

3735
03:06:43,960 --> 03:06:44,800
Oh!

3736
03:06:46,520 --> 03:06:47,360
Oh!

3737
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:50,560
Okay, okay.

3738
03:06:53,540 --> 03:06:54,800
I'm here.

3739
03:06:54,980 --> 03:06:55,400
I have...

3740
03:06:55,400 --> 03:06:58,040
I have...

3741
03:06:58,040 --> 03:06:59,740
I have scrapped you.

3742
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:01,200
You can gamble.

3743
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:02,140
That's unnecessary.

3744
03:07:02,300 --> 03:07:03,980
You can gamble at the casino.

3745
03:07:04,460 --> 03:07:04,740
That's unnecessary.

3746
03:07:04,860 --> 03:07:05,660
They gave us a skull.

3747
03:07:06,500 --> 03:07:07,540
They gave us a skull.

3748
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:09,660
Oh, they did it?

3749
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:10,160
Alright.

3750
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:11,800
They gave us a skull.

3751
03:07:15,100 --> 03:07:16,580
There's a hole in the poop though.

3752
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:17,400
I ain't gonna lie to you.

3753
03:07:19,360 --> 03:07:20,020
Oh my god.

3754
03:07:21,740 --> 03:07:23,180
Poop on the poop.

3755
03:07:23,540 --> 03:07:25,160
I'm in school all over again.

3756
03:07:25,400 --> 03:07:26,500
This is way too much.

3757
03:07:27,680 --> 03:07:28,560
I just...

3758
03:07:29,580 --> 03:07:30,720
Oh my god.

3759
03:07:33,820 --> 03:07:34,460
Okay.

3760
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:38,980
Okay.

3761
03:07:40,760 --> 03:07:42,100
My skull saved us.

3762
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:43,440
My skull saved us.

3763
03:07:43,600 --> 03:07:44,720
Oh my god, my skull.

3764
03:07:45,060 --> 03:07:45,300
Thank you.

3765
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:48,840
Oh my god.

3766
03:07:48,940 --> 03:07:50,100
Oh my god.

3767
03:07:50,540 --> 03:07:51,280
Oh shit.

3768
03:07:51,900 --> 03:07:53,420
We ran into the scientist.

3769
03:07:55,300 --> 03:07:56,200
Oh my god.

3770
03:07:56,200 --> 03:08:00,420
All I'm saying is that the bear saved us.

3771
03:08:00,880 --> 03:08:02,980
It was a sign from Odin.

3772
03:08:03,640 --> 03:08:05,240
It was a sign from Odin.

3773
03:08:05,400 --> 03:08:08,120
He needed me to die to save us.

3774
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:09,120
It was a blessing.

3775
03:08:09,540 --> 03:08:11,720
It was a blessing in disguise.

3776
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:19,800
It was a blessing.

3777
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:19,980
It was a blessing.

3778
03:08:24,420 --> 03:08:26,020
We need to harvest the skull.

3779
03:08:26,280 --> 03:08:28,880
We need to harvest the skull in case we bumped into...

3780
03:08:28,880 --> 03:08:31,480
We need to...

3781
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:34,260
Oh fuck!

3782
03:08:34,360 --> 03:08:34,620
Okay.

3783
03:08:36,420 --> 03:08:37,680
How do I do team chat?

3784
03:08:37,780 --> 03:08:38,720
How do I do team chat?

3785
03:08:38,840 --> 03:08:39,460
What do I press?

3786
03:08:44,280 --> 03:08:44,660
Oh.

3787
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:47,020
They...

3788
03:08:47,020 --> 03:08:49,660
They threatened us.

3789
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:53,180
I was...

3790
03:08:53,180 --> 03:08:55,260
I was so scared.

3791
03:08:59,380 --> 03:09:04,060
I was just trying to burn.

3792
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:12,060
Oh my god.

3793
03:09:14,900 --> 03:09:16,680
Where did Goomy go?

3794
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:20,000
Goomy, where did you go?

3795
03:09:21,660 --> 03:09:22,760
Oh, there she is.

3796
03:09:23,360 --> 03:09:24,560
Oh my god.

3797
03:09:24,940 --> 03:09:26,320
She found a horse!

3798
03:09:30,640 --> 03:09:32,860
Oh my god, I got hazed.

3799
03:09:35,540 --> 03:09:37,180
Goomy, why are you just sitting there?

3800
03:09:38,820 --> 03:09:39,760
We should have killed...

3801
03:09:39,760 --> 03:09:42,100
We should have killed them when we had the chance.

3802
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:43,740
Why did we give mercy?

3803
03:09:45,700 --> 03:09:46,800
Wait, is that your friend?

3804
03:09:52,260 --> 03:09:52,960
Is he here?

3805
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:55,940
No, there's nobody here.

3806
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:57,880
Do you live here by yourself?

3807
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:01,780
No, I'm just exploring.

3808
03:10:01,940 --> 03:10:02,780
Oh, you're an explorer!

3809
03:10:02,940 --> 03:10:03,740
You're a tourist!

3810
03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:08,080
Do you not belong?

3811
03:10:08,300 --> 03:10:09,280
You better look out for the metal dragons.

3812
03:10:09,840 --> 03:10:11,400
Yeah, the metal dragon gang.

3813
03:10:11,880 --> 03:10:12,600
They're scared.

3814
03:10:12,700 --> 03:10:13,800
They make you pick up shit.

3815
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:14,860
The metal dragons.

3816
03:10:15,420 --> 03:10:18,720
Yeah, they ride these metal dragons and they surround you.

3817
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:21,800
And then it's like you're in high school all over again.

3818
03:10:21,880 --> 03:10:24,260
They're gonna stuff you in a locker if you're not careful.

3819
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:31,060
When you hear the sound!

3820
03:10:31,220 --> 03:10:32,000
The metal dragon!

3821
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:32,420
Run!

3822
03:10:41,160 --> 03:10:41,640
Wait!

3823
03:10:42,060 --> 03:10:42,260
Goomy!

3824
03:10:42,560 --> 03:10:42,880
Goomy!

3825
03:10:46,170 --> 03:10:47,830
We could have taken his skull.

3826
03:10:49,630 --> 03:10:51,330
We could have taken his skull.

3827
03:10:51,330 --> 03:10:52,370
You think we should kill him?

3828
03:10:56,050 --> 03:10:57,190
You're on a horse.

3829
03:10:58,130 --> 03:11:02,730
I know, but I'm not running on it.

3830
03:11:02,770 --> 03:11:03,470
P.A.C.E.

3831
03:11:06,330 --> 03:11:07,590
It's okay, next time.

3832
03:11:07,710 --> 03:11:08,450
Next time.

3833
03:11:08,650 --> 03:11:10,290
We need a skull!

3834
03:11:10,490 --> 03:11:11,330
For insurance.

3835
03:11:11,810 --> 03:11:12,550
For our safety.

3836
03:11:17,860 --> 03:11:18,820
We can't...

3837
03:11:18,820 --> 03:11:20,120
I'm scouting ahead.

3838
03:11:20,220 --> 03:11:20,920
Wait, who's that?

3839
03:11:20,920 --> 03:11:21,700
Who's that?

3840
03:11:21,820 --> 03:11:23,820
Wait, how did you get here?

3841
03:11:27,060 --> 03:11:28,280
What happened to you?

3842
03:11:28,940 --> 03:11:30,200
What happened to you?

3843
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:32,120
Again?

3844
03:11:33,820 --> 03:11:36,220
You gotta get a skull for insurance.

3845
03:11:42,820 --> 03:11:45,080
But you have nothing on you, right?

3846
03:11:47,960 --> 03:11:51,080
So, like, you dying will be...

3847
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:57,840
Remember Valhalla.

3848
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:01,020
You need to do a sacrifice yourself.

3849
03:12:03,720 --> 03:12:05,300
Do it for Valhalla!

3850
03:12:06,440 --> 03:12:07,280
For Valhalla!

3851
03:12:08,100 --> 03:12:08,740
Okay.

3852
03:12:09,720 --> 03:12:10,980
We gotta get the skull.

3853
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:11,760
You harvest.

3854
03:12:12,140 --> 03:12:13,320
Yeah, you harvest.

3855
03:12:13,540 --> 03:12:15,660
He has nothing on him.

3856
03:12:17,100 --> 03:12:20,380
I'll get the scrap, so if they come back, we can donate the scrap.

3857
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:23,200
Okay, alright, we're fine.

3858
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:26,160
Alright, we have insurance.

3859
03:12:26,400 --> 03:12:27,400
We have insurance now.

3860
03:12:29,320 --> 03:12:29,800
Alright.

3861
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:31,660
If they come back...

3862
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:34,340
Yeah.

3863
03:12:35,480 --> 03:12:36,220
I got it.

3864
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:38,640
Odin will be proud of his sacrifice.

3865
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:46,400
No!

3866
03:12:51,380 --> 03:12:52,900
Are you okay?

3867
03:12:58,690 --> 03:13:00,170
Guys, you don't understand.

3868
03:13:00,590 --> 03:13:02,110
We need the skull.

3869
03:13:02,510 --> 03:13:04,250
We don't wanna get bullied.

3870
03:13:04,670 --> 03:13:07,490
We don't wanna get cyber bullied again.

3871
03:13:08,350 --> 03:13:09,530
It's a sacrifice.

3872
03:13:10,710 --> 03:13:13,230
His sacrifice will ensure our survival.

3873
03:13:20,710 --> 03:13:21,910
His sacrifice...

3874
03:13:21,910 --> 03:13:22,290
His sacrifice...

3875
03:13:22,290 --> 03:13:23,170
That's good, that's good.

3876
03:13:23,350 --> 03:13:24,130
Where's your friend?

3877
03:13:33,750 --> 03:13:35,350
We need the lunch money.

3878
03:13:35,470 --> 03:13:36,230
They took our...

3879
03:13:36,230 --> 03:13:38,290
The thing is, we need to...

3880
03:13:38,290 --> 03:13:50,350
We need to bully somebody else to take their lunch money so the bigger bullies won't kill us and stuff us in lockers by us giving their lunch money.

3881
03:13:50,930 --> 03:13:51,690
It's a cycle.

3882
03:13:56,770 --> 03:13:57,490
Yeah.

3883
03:13:58,990 --> 03:14:01,810
We just need to make sure we have lunch money on us.

3884
03:14:02,330 --> 03:14:04,610
The pyramid scheme of bullying.

3885
03:14:09,310 --> 03:14:11,410
Oh my god!

3886
03:14:11,510 --> 03:14:12,530
It's the other way around?

3887
03:14:15,920 --> 03:14:17,860
Where even are we?

3888
03:14:22,670 --> 03:14:23,630
Yeah?

3889
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:31,680
See what?

3890
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:34,680
See what?

3891
03:14:38,760 --> 03:14:40,380
We're so...

3892
03:14:40,380 --> 03:14:43,480
We're so far away from R15.

3893
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:46,500
Find me another horse, Gumi!

3894
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,320
Gumi, find me a horse!

3895
03:14:55,690 --> 03:14:57,570
Oh, it's you again.

3896
03:14:57,570 --> 03:14:58,330
Hey!

3897
03:14:58,990 --> 03:15:00,530
We don't need your skull anymore.

3898
03:15:00,650 --> 03:15:01,550
We found a skull.

3899
03:15:02,010 --> 03:15:03,130
Oh no, we have a skull.

3900
03:15:03,250 --> 03:15:04,150
Look, show her the skull.

3901
03:15:04,790 --> 03:15:05,950
Yeah, we got a skull.

3902
03:15:08,650 --> 03:15:10,850
Yeah, to sacrifice themselves for us.

3903
03:15:14,930 --> 03:15:17,390
Give them a skull and you'll be fine.

3904
03:15:18,770 --> 03:15:20,090
Yeah, like that one.

3905
03:15:20,330 --> 03:15:22,190
Your horse just pooped by the way when you said that.

3906
03:15:31,190 --> 03:15:31,670
Yeah.

3907
03:15:33,310 --> 03:15:34,850
Is there a horse?

3908
03:15:34,930 --> 03:15:36,750
Is there a horse anywhere for us?

3909
03:15:41,570 --> 03:15:43,170
We need another horse.

3910
03:15:44,150 --> 03:15:46,970
So we can both ride the horse at the same time.

3911
03:15:52,240 --> 03:15:53,380
No, don't say that.

3912
03:15:53,460 --> 03:15:55,900
No, no, that's a different thing you're thinking about.

3913
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:59,520
Gumi, that is an absolutely different thing that could be real.

3914
03:15:59,640 --> 03:15:59,880
Gumi.

3915
03:16:04,300 --> 03:16:05,380
Don't say that.

3916
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:06,300
It could be real.

3917
03:16:06,400 --> 03:16:07,300
Don't say that.

3918
03:16:12,510 --> 03:16:13,750
Oh my god.

3919
03:16:13,870 --> 03:16:15,470
Where is another horse?

3920
03:16:16,250 --> 03:16:17,870
How is there a lack of horses?

3921
03:16:21,530 --> 03:16:24,490
How is there a lack of horses in this world?

3922
03:16:26,950 --> 03:16:28,610
I'll just take that to that room.

3923
03:16:30,850 --> 03:16:32,570
I feel like everybody has like...

3924
03:16:32,570 --> 03:16:34,050
ransacked all the horses.

3925
03:16:35,190 --> 03:16:37,030
It's so...R15 is so far away.

3926
03:16:37,750 --> 03:16:39,710
Everybody has ransacked the horses.

3927
03:16:40,890 --> 03:16:42,250
They've stolen all the horses.

3928
03:16:42,310 --> 03:16:43,870
Do you think like somebody...

3929
03:16:43,870 --> 03:16:46,290
Maybe if we go to a village, we can steal a horse there.

3930
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:54,000
I'm okay.

3931
03:16:54,120 --> 03:16:54,680
Oh, I'm okay.

3932
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:55,500
She's chasing you.

3933
03:16:55,560 --> 03:16:56,340
He's chasing you.

3934
03:16:58,760 --> 03:16:59,860
Just in case.

3935
03:17:00,660 --> 03:17:01,960
Just in case.

3936
03:17:02,960 --> 03:17:03,600
Okay, it's fine.

3937
03:17:03,680 --> 03:17:04,120
It's fine.

3938
03:17:04,180 --> 03:17:05,140
Everything is fine.

3939
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:06,560
We're okay.

3940
03:17:06,860 --> 03:17:07,560
No, no, no.

3941
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:10,560
The bear chased after Gumi and not me.

3942
03:17:13,080 --> 03:17:14,580
The bear chased after her.

3943
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:15,200
I'm safe.

3944
03:17:15,260 --> 03:17:15,740
I'm okay.

3945
03:17:16,620 --> 03:17:17,280
I'm okay.

3946
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:18,500
I'm okay.

3947
03:17:20,820 --> 03:17:21,700
I'm okay.

3948
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:24,120
Yeah, it was chasing after you, but...

3949
03:17:24,120 --> 03:17:25,900
It was chasing you and not me.

3950
03:17:29,860 --> 03:17:30,260
Okay.

3951
03:17:31,900 --> 03:17:32,740
Two squares?

3952
03:17:37,840 --> 03:17:38,520
Oh my god!

3953
03:17:38,560 --> 03:17:39,060
We're almost there!

3954
03:17:39,240 --> 03:17:39,240
We're

3955
03:17:42,340 --> 03:17:44,400
almost there!

3956
03:17:55,450 --> 03:17:55,870
Um...

3957
03:17:55,870 --> 03:17:56,690
No, I don't.

3958
03:17:56,790 --> 03:17:57,630
Now we have scrap.

3959
03:17:58,450 --> 03:17:59,070
And cloth.

3960
03:18:00,910 --> 03:18:02,430
I mean, there's trees ahead of us.

3961
03:18:02,430 --> 03:18:04,650
We can just farm the wood from there.

3962
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:11,040
Use a rock.

3963
03:18:15,370 --> 03:18:16,570
You don't got no rock?

3964
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:26,770
Yeah, but when you're harvesting, you might as well grab a rock in case.

3965
03:18:27,390 --> 03:18:28,350
Like, you know when you're...

3966
03:18:28,350 --> 03:18:29,450
It's like a desperate measure.

3967
03:18:29,850 --> 03:18:31,910
If they're too close to you, just bring up the rock.

3968
03:18:33,230 --> 03:18:34,470
And just like, you know...

3969
03:18:40,730 --> 03:18:41,090
Oh.

3970
03:18:41,750 --> 03:18:42,690
It's a machete!

3971
03:18:43,510 --> 03:18:44,450
I don't think I have...

3972
03:18:44,450 --> 03:18:46,210
I don't have inventory space, so you gotta pick it up.

3973
03:18:48,250 --> 03:18:49,330
You gotta pick it up.

3974
03:18:49,530 --> 03:18:50,890
I don't have inventory space.

3975
03:18:53,290 --> 03:18:54,630
Let me know when you...

3976
03:18:54,630 --> 03:18:55,150
Let me know.

3977
03:18:56,130 --> 03:18:57,150
Do you need more?

3978
03:18:59,530 --> 03:19:00,470
Alright, let's go.

3979
03:19:04,860 --> 03:19:06,800
By the way, I also have an axe, by the way.

3980
03:19:07,860 --> 03:19:09,420
I had an axe, by the way.

3981
03:19:11,700 --> 03:19:16,260
lol Wait, there's houses here.

3982
03:19:16,340 --> 03:19:16,900
Is this a village?

3983
03:19:19,320 --> 03:19:20,820
Wait, there's houses here.

3984
03:19:21,420 --> 03:19:23,000
There's a village here.

3985
03:19:24,840 --> 03:19:26,800
Is this a new world?

3986
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:29,850
This is a new world.

3987
03:19:32,740 --> 03:19:34,080
Do you think they have AKs?

3988
03:19:36,660 --> 03:19:37,680
Is this...

3989
03:19:39,180 --> 03:19:39,660
Oh.

3990
03:19:39,740 --> 03:19:40,040
Oh.

3991
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:43,680
Sorry, I meant...

3992
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:48,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3993
03:19:49,240 --> 03:19:51,680
I'm just thinking...

3994
03:19:52,360 --> 03:19:52,900
I know.

3995
03:19:53,580 --> 03:19:53,920
I know.

3996
03:19:54,100 --> 03:19:57,240
All I'm saying is that they won't know if we never...

3997
03:19:57,240 --> 03:20:00,260
You know, it's not a sin if they don't see us use it.

3998
03:20:04,300 --> 03:20:04,780
Yeah.

3999
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:09,480
lol

4000
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:16,800
I think...

4001
03:20:16,800 --> 03:20:17,640
I think...

4002
03:20:18,540 --> 03:20:20,740
We get a...

4003
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:23,340
We make a separate home in the middle.

4004
03:20:24,080 --> 03:20:25,780
And then we can swap clothes.

4005
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:27,020
And...

4006
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:29,360
Swap clothes and like items.

4007
03:20:29,540 --> 03:20:31,760
So we make a little mini house there.

4008
03:20:32,280 --> 03:20:33,720
That's just for us too.

4009
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:36,020
You know, when we feel like we wanna...

4010
03:20:36,020 --> 03:20:38,140
Know what it's like to be in the new world.

4011
03:20:38,460 --> 03:20:41,760
Yeah, Freya was Hannah Montana.

4012
03:20:46,260 --> 03:20:48,300
Odin came to us in a dream.

4013
03:20:48,760 --> 03:20:49,260
And...

4014
03:20:49,260 --> 03:20:50,620
No, no, we can say that!

4015
03:20:50,980 --> 03:20:51,920
We were spies.

4016
03:20:54,020 --> 03:20:55,900
Odin came to us in a dream.

4017
03:20:56,440 --> 03:20:58,900
And he wanted us to spy on the new world.

4018
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:04,100
And we had to immerse ourselves in the new world.

4019
03:21:05,080 --> 03:21:07,640
And he wanted us to get the best of both worlds.

4020
03:21:08,820 --> 03:21:10,560
Best of both worlds.

4021
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:14,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4022
03:21:16,660 --> 03:21:17,140
Yes!

4023
03:21:18,080 --> 03:21:20,400
We're just trying to live the best of both worlds.

4024
03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:28,320
lol

4025
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:35,140
Horse.

4026
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:37,580
But isn't that somebody else's horse?

4027
03:21:41,860 --> 03:21:43,540
This is literally...

4028
03:21:43,540 --> 03:21:44,880
This is literally you just stole from an artist.

4029
03:21:45,420 --> 03:21:45,580
lol

4030
03:21:49,880 --> 03:22:15,380
lol Okay, well my horse is stuck you were never gonna get that horse back

4031
03:22:23,700 --> 03:22:25,340
Oh my god, they can follow.

4032
03:22:25,440 --> 03:22:26,340
Yeah, you can tap the horse.

4033
03:22:32,440 --> 03:22:33,460
No, wait, get the horse.

4034
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:34,000
Wait.

4035
03:22:34,680 --> 03:22:35,000
Hi.

4036
03:22:36,280 --> 03:22:36,580
Hello.

4037
03:22:38,880 --> 03:22:41,760
Wait, is that not the bike gang?

4038
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:45,620
I don't know, I don't know.

4039
03:22:45,800 --> 03:22:46,800
I'll get inside anyways.

4040
03:22:48,900 --> 03:22:49,980
I thought you said this is safe.

4041
03:22:50,220 --> 03:22:51,280
The bike gang?

4042
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:54,760
The people to your left, are they not the bike gang on the bikes?

4043
03:22:54,780 --> 03:22:56,980
Maybe this is safe, they don't know the bike gang.

4044
03:22:57,640 --> 03:22:59,920
You guys never encountered the bike gang?

4045
03:23:00,040 --> 03:23:00,720
I'm looking at bikes.

4046
03:23:01,960 --> 03:23:04,980
Oh my god, this is a safe place.

4047
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:05,980
Are you guys part of the bike gang?

4048
03:23:05,980 --> 03:23:07,620
No, no, we're trying.

4049
03:23:08,780 --> 03:23:12,220
Beyond this land, there's savages out there.

4050
03:23:12,340 --> 03:23:14,200
They're known as the bike gang.

4051
03:23:16,100 --> 03:23:17,580
It's very scary.

4052
03:23:17,860 --> 03:23:18,680
What do they do to people?

4053
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:21,520
They ride around in bikes.

4054
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:24,780
They make you pick up their shit.

4055
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:27,880
And if they don't kill you, they make you pick up horse poop.

4056
03:23:28,500 --> 03:23:29,780
And then they say eat it.

4057
03:23:30,480 --> 03:23:35,060
And you've never lived beyond this town, right?

4058
03:23:35,060 --> 03:23:39,360
Have you ever ventured out of this town, Mammoth?

4059
03:23:41,960 --> 03:23:43,280
Yes, and I got murdered.

4060
03:23:43,660 --> 03:23:44,660
Yes, exactly.

4061
03:23:44,820 --> 03:23:46,000
Never leave this town.

4062
03:23:46,120 --> 03:23:48,100
This is the only safe place out there.

4063
03:23:49,660 --> 03:23:50,780
I'm not planning.

4064
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:54,320
Are you gonna make me pick it up?

4065
03:23:57,440 --> 03:24:00,500
We're teaching you the horrors of the bike gang.

4066
03:24:00,900 --> 03:24:03,940
So you never have to experience it, just like us.

4067
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:08,300
Oh my god, Da Vinci!

4068
03:24:08,920 --> 03:24:10,400
Did you make this?

4069
03:24:13,240 --> 03:24:13,880
Yeah.

4070
03:24:14,200 --> 03:24:14,920
Oh my god.

4071
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:17,000
What?

4072
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:20,200
It's Leslie and Jon Snow.

4073
03:24:20,540 --> 03:24:20,820
Oh!

4074
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:22,600
Is that like...

4075
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:23,380
Holding hands.

4076
03:24:23,880 --> 03:24:25,160
Is that... Are they like dating?

4077
03:24:27,440 --> 03:24:28,660
Yeah, yeah.

4078
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:29,940
Oh, I can see it.

4079
03:24:30,020 --> 03:24:30,760
I see it.

4080
03:24:30,860 --> 03:24:34,600
And then Jamie Lancaster is sitting in the bush waiting.

4081
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:35,800
Waiting for who?

4082
03:24:38,080 --> 03:24:38,980
For Leslie.

4083
03:24:39,860 --> 03:24:41,360
She's with Jon Snow right now.

4084
03:24:41,380 --> 03:24:43,200
Oh, so it's like a little love triangle.

4085
03:24:44,260 --> 03:24:44,900
I see.

4086
03:24:45,020 --> 03:24:45,720
I can see it.

4087
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:48,060
Oh, that's some drama going on.

4088
03:24:48,720 --> 03:24:50,040
What is this piece called?

4089
03:24:50,140 --> 03:24:50,540
Yeah, yeah.

4090
03:24:50,640 --> 03:24:51,680
What's this artwork called?

4091
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:55,680
Um...

4092
03:24:55,680 --> 03:24:58,560
The Turmoil of Freelanding.

4093
03:24:58,920 --> 03:25:01,240
The Turmoil of Freelanding.

4094
03:25:01,720 --> 03:25:02,740
Of Freehold, sorry.

4095
03:25:02,740 --> 03:25:03,480
Of Freehold.

4096
03:25:04,500 --> 03:25:07,280
It's pretty lewd that they're holding hands, too.

4097
03:25:08,460 --> 03:25:10,180
And Leslie's not even wearing gloves.

4098
03:25:10,420 --> 03:25:11,120
Yeah, you know.

4099
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:12,780
It's really lewd.

4100
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:13,740
True.

4101
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:17,320
Yeah, she's holding hands without protection.

4102
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:20,040
Yeah, yeah.

4103
03:25:20,120 --> 03:25:20,680
What is with that?

4104
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:24,360
That's how much she loves him.

4105
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:26,280
True, true.

4106
03:25:32,940 --> 03:25:34,840
Here, here, here.

4107
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:39,420
All the way from L4.

4108
03:25:39,700 --> 03:25:40,680
All the way over here.

4109
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:43,020
We gotta put you at our house, though.

4110
03:25:48,570 --> 03:25:49,330
Told you.

4111
03:25:49,730 --> 03:25:50,070
What?

4112
03:25:50,270 --> 03:25:51,050
We have safe haven here.

4113
03:25:51,090 --> 03:25:52,090
We have safe haven here?

4114
03:25:52,190 --> 03:25:53,130
This is my brother, Nix.

4115
03:25:54,170 --> 03:25:55,430
He's a man of the clergy.

4116
03:25:55,830 --> 03:25:56,470
The clergy?

4117
03:25:56,930 --> 03:25:57,750
He's a priest?

4118
03:25:57,830 --> 03:25:58,750
He's religious?

4119
03:25:59,170 --> 03:25:59,910
Yeah, the clergy.

4120
03:26:00,470 --> 03:26:02,130
Is he the new gods?

4121
03:26:03,790 --> 03:26:04,370
Whoa, what's wrong?

4122
03:26:04,410 --> 03:26:05,110
What happened to him?

4123
03:26:06,930 --> 03:26:07,650
What happened?

4124
03:26:08,530 --> 03:26:09,250
Wait, wait.

4125
03:26:09,310 --> 03:26:10,210
Skull, skull, skull.

4126
03:26:10,350 --> 03:26:10,970
We need a skull.

4127
03:26:11,110 --> 03:26:11,710
We need a skull.

4128
03:26:16,910 --> 03:26:17,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4129
03:26:17,830 --> 03:26:19,090
Just in case one of us runs into him.

4130
03:26:24,190 --> 03:26:25,930
Okay, we'll put your bag over here.

4131
03:26:27,270 --> 03:26:28,010
Do you need a cloth?

4132
03:26:29,450 --> 03:26:30,470
I have cloth.

4133
03:26:30,610 --> 03:26:31,310
I have four cloth.

4134
03:26:32,130 --> 03:26:32,730
Hey, hey, hey.

4135
03:26:32,770 --> 03:26:33,630
Get out of my TC.

4136
03:26:34,030 --> 03:26:34,990
Get out of my TC.

4137
03:26:36,770 --> 03:26:37,050
What?

4138
03:26:38,770 --> 03:26:40,530
Toki, four cloth is not enough.

4139
03:26:40,570 --> 03:26:42,270
That's the only cloth I have.

4140
03:26:42,470 --> 03:26:43,010
Four cloth?

4141
03:26:43,490 --> 03:26:45,410
That's the only one I have.

4142
03:26:45,810 --> 03:26:50,210
Nix, I'm gonna cook 19 bear meat in your metal frog, if you will.

4143
03:26:50,690 --> 03:26:53,130
I have nine more bear meat, too.

4144
03:26:53,310 --> 03:26:54,370
We have to tell you.

4145
03:26:57,530 --> 03:27:01,390
We've been adopted by a group called the Lurklings.

4146
03:27:04,270 --> 03:27:10,690
But we... but the biker gang lives... the biker gangs live nearby.

4147
03:27:11,270 --> 03:27:14,710
We're not allowed to use the metal?

4148
03:27:16,250 --> 03:27:20,450
They say that on the third day, we'll be granted our special wish.

4149
03:27:22,230 --> 03:27:24,490
We don't know what that special wish is.

4150
03:27:24,490 --> 03:27:27,510
The biker gang, they came up to me like, yo, do you like Dick?

4151
03:27:27,610 --> 03:27:29,390
And I said, yeah, and they just left me alone.

4152
03:27:34,080 --> 03:27:35,760
Did you guys hear that?

4153
03:27:36,240 --> 03:27:38,960
Did you guys... I don't know if you guys heard that.

4154
03:27:48,080 --> 03:27:51,880
The biker gang came up to him and was like, did you like Dick?

4155
03:27:51,940 --> 03:27:54,480
And then the guy said, yes, and then he rode off.

4156
03:27:57,160 --> 03:27:58,620
Speech 100.

4157
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:02,000
Speech 100 right there.

4158
03:28:03,520 --> 03:28:04,620
Is there a sleeping bag?

4159
03:28:06,680 --> 03:28:07,020
Whoa.

4160
03:28:12,470 --> 03:28:13,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4161
03:28:15,110 --> 03:28:16,150
Oh, really?

4162
03:28:16,290 --> 03:28:16,650
Nice.

4163
03:28:17,530 --> 03:28:18,650
Thank you.

4164
03:28:19,130 --> 03:28:19,810
Is this mine?

4165
03:28:21,670 --> 03:28:22,910
Is this mine?

4166
03:28:24,690 --> 03:28:26,190
Oh, this is mine, right?

4167
03:28:29,430 --> 03:28:30,750
Wait, I wanna, wait.

4168
03:28:36,350 --> 03:28:38,870
I, I, I changed the name.

4169
03:28:44,290 --> 03:28:47,130
This is my, my new life.

4170
03:28:59,910 --> 03:29:02,190
My new life.

4171
03:29:06,570 --> 03:29:14,410
I'm just trying to live my life, guys.

4172
03:29:14,510 --> 03:29:19,410
I don't wanna, the biker gang fucked me up and now I don't wanna live through that again.

4173
03:29:19,590 --> 03:29:21,490
I don't wanna go through that experience again.

4174
03:29:21,490 --> 03:29:23,190
Alright, where should we go?

4175
03:29:27,060 --> 03:29:28,860
Should we explore this village?

4176
03:29:29,820 --> 03:29:32,380
I'm gonna explore, I'm gonna explore the village, Umi.

4177
03:29:32,440 --> 03:29:34,420
I wanna see what technology is like.

4178
03:29:45,800 --> 03:29:49,340
I wanna know what it's like to have metal.

4179
03:29:49,980 --> 03:29:51,280
I wanna know.

4180
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:55,600
I wanna know what it's like to have it.

4181
03:29:56,700 --> 03:29:58,480
Umi, Umi, Plow's here.

4182
03:29:58,760 --> 03:30:01,080
Umi, Umi, Plow's here.

4183
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:01,780
Plow's here.

4184
03:30:10,880 --> 03:30:12,180
They're here, they're here.

4185
03:30:31,430 --> 03:30:32,970
Mother of hoes.

4186
03:30:33,230 --> 03:30:34,030
Mother of hoes.

4187
03:30:34,990 --> 03:30:35,630
Hello, it is I.

4188
03:30:35,670 --> 03:30:40,250
It's like the Amish take that one day in normalcy.

4189
03:30:40,790 --> 03:30:41,990
Am I the Amish?

4190
03:30:41,990 --> 03:30:43,510
I feel like the Amish.

4191
03:30:46,470 --> 03:30:49,930
We're the Amish of this land.

4192
03:30:51,270 --> 03:30:58,850
It's like that thing where they, they're, they're like, they're like, they're allowed to go spend a year.

4193
03:30:58,850 --> 03:31:07,170
They're allowed to spend a year outside the civilization and get to choose to live in the Amish land or, or like live in the city.

4194
03:31:07,890 --> 03:31:10,890
It's like a specific thing they do for a year.

4195
03:31:21,410 --> 03:31:24,950
I noticed that you're, you're holding his hand without protection.

4196
03:31:29,350 --> 03:31:30,730
He's hazed.

4197
03:31:31,430 --> 03:31:32,590
Hazed.

4198
03:31:37,150 --> 03:31:48,430
He's been working since, since the, the first kind of five minutes this all started.

4199
03:31:50,790 --> 03:31:51,830
That's crazy.

4200
03:31:51,830 --> 03:31:54,050
I have a ticket.

4201
03:31:56,230 --> 03:31:58,830
Wow, it's a bear doing the city.

4202
03:31:59,910 --> 03:32:01,890
There's bears in the city.

4203
03:32:05,030 --> 03:32:08,750
Oh my God, there's a train.

4204
03:32:09,950 --> 03:32:10,910
How was there?

4205
03:32:11,570 --> 03:32:15,070
My curse, my curse joined, joined.

4206
03:32:15,930 --> 03:32:16,950
Oh, there's a train underground.

4207
03:32:16,970 --> 03:32:18,950
A train comes by, a train, it comes by.

4208
03:32:19,010 --> 03:32:19,930
Underground train.

4209
03:32:20,150 --> 03:32:20,570
Oh, it's over here.

4210
03:32:20,570 --> 03:32:23,770
Oh my God, look at this art gallery.

4211
03:32:24,850 --> 03:32:26,620
Oh my God, it's so beautiful.

4212
03:32:35,230 --> 03:32:37,270
I knew I was here.

4213
03:32:45,210 --> 03:32:47,170
There we go, I stopped it.

4214
03:32:47,190 --> 03:32:48,730
You have to jump off, jump off.

4215
03:32:48,730 --> 03:32:50,630
You have to jump off.

4216
03:32:53,570 --> 03:32:59,690
I wanna explore, I'm gonna explore the village a little bit.

4217
03:33:00,010 --> 03:33:02,510
I wanna know what's going on in this village.

4218
03:33:02,630 --> 03:33:05,010
I like how there's camera on the artwork right here.

4219
03:33:05,410 --> 03:33:11,870
I like how they put camera on the fucking painting.

4220
03:33:13,570 --> 03:33:14,170
Wow!

4221
03:33:14,530 --> 03:33:17,300
Oh my God!

4222
03:33:17,700 --> 03:33:18,300
No.

4223
03:33:19,340 --> 03:33:19,820
No.

4224
03:33:20,060 --> 03:33:21,340
Oh, please save me.

4225
03:33:21,420 --> 03:33:22,140
Thank you.

4226
03:33:26,700 --> 03:33:29,180
Oh, thank you for saving me.

4227
03:33:30,960 --> 03:33:31,920
Oh my God.

4228
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:33,460
Thank you.

4229
03:33:34,140 --> 03:33:35,180
I couldn't see him.

4230
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:37,960
I couldn't see him, I have no light.

4231
03:33:38,780 --> 03:33:40,140
Thank you so much.

4232
03:33:42,300 --> 03:33:43,300
Oh, it's so dark.

4233
03:33:43,300 --> 03:33:45,440
I'm afraid of the dark.

4234
03:33:52,870 --> 03:33:54,750
How is there boys?

4235
03:33:55,690 --> 03:33:56,930
There's a nightclub?

4236
03:33:57,910 --> 03:33:59,390
There's a fucking nightclub?

4237
03:34:00,190 --> 03:34:01,450
Bro, I am the Amish.

4238
03:34:05,010 --> 03:34:06,510
Oh my God, hello.

4239
03:34:07,450 --> 03:34:09,150
Oh my God, you're working on nightclub?

4240
03:34:09,590 --> 03:34:10,590
When will it be opening?

4241
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:11,730
When's the grand opening?

4242
03:34:17,950 --> 03:34:18,590
Oh.

4243
03:34:22,930 --> 03:34:24,170
It's exclusive?

4244
03:34:24,370 --> 03:34:25,570
How do we get on the list?

4245
03:34:30,710 --> 03:34:31,350
Anyone?

4246
03:34:32,890 --> 03:34:35,230
Oh, VIP section.

4247
03:34:36,350 --> 03:34:38,310
It's for those very important people.

4248
03:34:39,830 --> 03:34:42,550
Oh, and you can look down at the peasants too.

4249
03:34:42,810 --> 03:34:44,210
The little commoners.

4250
03:34:44,210 --> 03:34:44,570
Oh.

4251
03:34:48,170 --> 03:34:49,590
Oh, you thought of everything.

4252
03:34:55,230 --> 03:34:59,870
Oh, I can't wait, I can't wait.

4253
03:34:59,910 --> 03:35:01,250
I'm gonna be the first one here.

4254
03:35:02,370 --> 03:35:03,990
Can't wait to go to this nightclub.

4255
03:35:09,210 --> 03:35:09,670
Yeah.

4256
03:35:10,690 --> 03:35:12,490
Thanks for showing me the nightclub.

4257
03:35:14,330 --> 03:35:15,250
Can't wait.

4258
03:35:17,010 --> 03:35:18,090
Oh, Gumi.

4259
03:35:20,030 --> 03:35:20,570
Gumi?

4260
03:35:21,750 --> 03:35:24,410
I was looking at the nightclub, they have a VIP section.

4261
03:35:25,150 --> 03:35:26,490
It's still being worked on.

4262
03:35:28,410 --> 03:35:30,990
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking party.

4263
03:35:31,290 --> 03:35:32,530
I am the Amish.

4264
03:35:32,830 --> 03:35:35,110
The Amish that went here for after a year.

4265
03:35:36,590 --> 03:35:37,930
Oh my God, this is where I go.

4266
03:35:38,370 --> 03:35:39,750
This is where I'm gonna go.

4267
03:35:44,350 --> 03:35:46,230
Oh my God, hey.

4268
03:35:50,710 --> 03:35:51,810
Yeah, we are!

4269
03:35:51,970 --> 03:35:57,090
And they have like a year where they go to the city and spend a year in the city and partying and stuff.

4270
03:35:57,330 --> 03:35:58,330
That's us right now.

4271
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:00,730
We're Rum Springer.

4272
03:36:00,930 --> 03:36:02,230
Yeah, this is Rum Springer.

4273
03:36:09,310 --> 03:36:10,810
What else is in the city?

4274
03:36:11,170 --> 03:36:12,390
You wanna visit the Blood God?

4275
03:36:13,730 --> 03:36:15,310
Are we visiting the Blood God?

4276
03:36:17,550 --> 03:36:18,790
We can go gambling!

4277
03:36:19,090 --> 03:36:21,030
I have scrap on me, I have scrap on me.

4278
03:36:23,550 --> 03:36:24,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4279
03:36:26,770 --> 03:36:29,630
Oh, I don't have scrap with me, I'm poor, I'm so poor.

4280
03:36:31,170 --> 03:36:33,150
I'm so poor.

4281
03:36:36,570 --> 03:36:38,730
Oh, there's a gambling leaderboard?

4282
03:36:38,730 --> 03:36:44,190
There's already a thousand for- Holy shit, people have been gambling, gambling.

4283
03:36:50,790 --> 03:36:52,310
I'm following you!

4284
03:36:55,590 --> 03:36:57,330
Wait, these are free horses?

4285
03:36:58,110 --> 03:36:59,530
No, they're not, they're not, they're not.

4286
03:36:59,590 --> 03:37:00,330
You gotta pay for them.

4287
03:37:00,550 --> 03:37:02,330
You gotta buy them.

4288
03:37:02,450 --> 03:37:04,250
Hey, welcome back!

4289
03:37:05,710 --> 03:37:06,730
Thanks for the skull!

4290
03:37:06,870 --> 03:37:08,430
Your skull saved our lives!

4291
03:37:11,410 --> 03:37:13,810
We almost died!

4292
03:37:14,070 --> 03:37:14,390
Yeah!

4293
03:37:15,350 --> 03:37:16,630
You saved our life!

4294
03:37:19,350 --> 03:37:21,950
I don't think he appreciates it, Umi.

4295
03:37:22,090 --> 03:37:24,050
I think he's a little angry that you killed him.

4296
03:37:27,590 --> 03:37:29,650
Two lives is better than one!

4297
03:37:32,730 --> 03:37:34,010
Let's go gambling!

4298
03:37:36,450 --> 03:37:37,030
Let's go gambling!

4299
03:37:37,030 --> 03:37:38,150
Oh, you guys are gambling too?

4300
03:37:42,410 --> 03:37:43,010
Oh,

4301
03:37:47,700 --> 03:37:49,120
I have to wait till next spin?

4302
03:37:54,360 --> 03:37:55,100
FUUUUUCK!

4303
03:37:56,080 --> 03:37:56,820
Oh,

4304
03:38:05,360 --> 03:38:11,360
I think the bike gang- The biker gang, I think the biker gang hit the church.

4305
03:38:16,860 --> 03:38:17,600
Here,

4306
03:38:21,420 --> 03:38:22,320
here's three scrap.

4307
03:38:23,640 --> 03:38:25,720
I gave three!

4308
03:38:26,180 --> 03:38:27,660
I kept dropping them!

4309
03:38:36,120 --> 03:38:38,520
Who took the horses?

4310
03:38:41,460 --> 03:38:41,740
Who?

4311
03:38:41,920 --> 03:38:42,520
Who's they?

4312
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:50,560
They took your horses too?!

4313
03:38:52,320 --> 03:38:54,460
That's what- that's- gambling's a problem.

4314
03:38:58,420 --> 03:38:59,120
No!

4315
03:39:00,320 --> 03:39:00,740
No way!

4316
03:39:00,780 --> 03:39:01,100
No way!

4317
03:39:02,990 --> 03:39:03,090
Yes!

4318
03:39:04,930 --> 03:39:05,630
Yeah!

4319
03:39:09,370 --> 03:39:10,890
I'm making it rain!

4320
03:39:11,750 --> 03:39:12,710
Like twenty dollars.

4321
03:39:16,350 --> 03:39:18,790
You lost twenty?!

4322
03:39:18,790 --> 03:39:20,430
I'll give you two.

4323
03:39:20,650 --> 03:39:21,010
Desert.

4324
03:39:21,010 --> 03:39:23,370
I didn't put it on twenty, man!

4325
03:39:24,110 --> 03:39:24,830
That's what you get.

4326
03:39:25,850 --> 03:39:26,830
That's an I.O.U.

4327
03:39:26,890 --> 03:39:27,750
of interest rates.

4328
03:39:37,290 --> 03:39:39,050
Oh my god, I knew it.

4329
03:39:39,110 --> 03:39:40,350
I'm so good at gambling.

4330
03:39:41,470 --> 03:39:43,070
I'm so good at gambling.

4331
03:39:44,790 --> 03:39:48,930
Guys, I have another stream in like an hour and a half.

4332
03:39:48,930 --> 03:39:51,170
And I'm gambling right now.

4333
03:39:58,620 --> 03:39:59,420
Come on.

4334
03:40:02,180 --> 03:40:02,980
Come on.

4335
03:40:03,100 --> 03:40:04,000
Give me a purple.

4336
03:40:04,760 --> 03:40:08,000
Purple, purple, purple, purple, purple, purple, purple.

4337
03:40:08,220 --> 03:40:08,780
Blue, blue, blue, blue!

4338
03:40:08,900 --> 03:40:09,520
We're getting down!

4339
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:12,700
Oh my god, did I get anything?

4340
03:40:13,680 --> 03:40:14,440
That- no!

4341
03:40:14,760 --> 03:40:16,180
I didn't win anything!

4342
03:40:16,480 --> 03:40:16,900
I'm done.

4343
03:40:17,080 --> 03:40:18,680
Um, I gotta quit.

4344
03:40:21,260 --> 03:40:27,320
I gotta quit before it- I gotta quit before it- before I fuck up.

4345
03:40:28,600 --> 03:40:29,220
Okay.

4346
03:40:31,060 --> 03:40:32,460
How do I do this?

4347
03:40:34,240 --> 03:40:35,740
How do I spin this?

4348
03:40:40,070 --> 03:40:41,770
How do you spin this, guys?

4349
03:40:45,340 --> 03:40:46,220
Oh, here.

4350
03:40:47,180 --> 03:40:48,580
How do I spin it?

4351
03:40:48,760 --> 03:40:49,620
Scrap or spin?

4352
03:40:49,860 --> 03:40:51,620
A- I need A?!

4353
03:40:55,380 --> 03:40:56,440
Is it A?

4354
03:40:56,660 --> 03:40:57,240
Actually?

4355
03:40:57,240 --> 03:40:59,340
Oh, you get eight spins.

4356
03:40:59,540 --> 03:41:00,100
Oh!

4357
03:41:00,500 --> 03:41:02,480
Wait, but how do you...

4358
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:03,960
How do you click it?

4359
03:41:06,220 --> 03:41:08,060
Wait, is it- Oh, wait.

4360
03:41:08,240 --> 03:41:08,960
Oh, I need eight.

4361
03:41:09,060 --> 03:41:09,280
Okay.

4362
03:41:10,020 --> 03:41:10,380
Okay.

4363
03:41:11,680 --> 03:41:13,740
Three, four, five.

4364
03:41:14,820 --> 03:41:18,580
Five, six, seven, eight.

4365
03:41:19,580 --> 03:41:22,540
Oh my god, that's so many scraps.

4366
03:41:24,880 --> 03:41:27,440
Oh my god, this is how they get you.

4367
03:41:27,760 --> 03:41:28,960
This is...

4368
03:41:30,140 --> 03:41:30,540
Okay.

4369
03:41:31,300 --> 03:41:31,960
There you go.

4370
03:41:32,740 --> 03:41:33,760
This is how they get you.

4371
03:41:34,860 --> 03:41:36,060
This is how they get you.

4372
03:41:36,120 --> 03:41:37,540
This is- Oh, this is...

4373
03:41:38,180 --> 03:41:39,900
This is how they get you hooked.

4374
03:41:40,740 --> 03:41:42,100
This is how they get you hooked.

4375
03:41:42,180 --> 03:41:42,660
This is it.

4376
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:43,680
Let's go gambling!

4377
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:47,540
This is so hard!

4378
03:41:51,080 --> 03:41:52,200
This is how they get you.

4379
03:41:53,660 --> 03:41:54,860
This is how they get you.

4380
03:41:54,960 --> 03:41:55,460
This is it.

4381
03:41:55,540 --> 03:41:56,760
This is how they hook you in.

4382
03:41:57,320 --> 03:41:58,920
The house always wins.

4383
03:42:01,820 --> 03:42:02,660
I give up.

4384
03:42:02,940 --> 03:42:03,380
I give up.

4385
03:42:03,540 --> 03:42:09,040
No, if I give up now, I'll never- Oh my gosh, I'm giving it up before I hit it big.

4386
03:42:09,340 --> 03:42:10,960
Maybe the next spin will be it.

4387
03:42:11,180 --> 03:42:11,940
The next spin.

4388
03:42:12,460 --> 03:42:14,000
This next spin will be it.

4389
03:42:14,660 --> 03:42:15,460
You got it.

4390
03:42:16,240 --> 03:42:17,320
You can't stop.

4391
03:42:17,400 --> 03:42:18,200
You can't stop.

4392
03:42:18,740 --> 03:42:19,020
Yes!

4393
03:42:19,560 --> 03:42:20,040
I knew!

4394
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:28,660
I knew it.

4395
03:42:29,500 --> 03:42:30,640
I lost it all.

4396
03:42:30,680 --> 03:42:31,900
I won it all back.

4397
03:42:32,000 --> 03:42:32,940
I won it all back.

4398
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:33,660
I can't lose.

4399
03:42:33,840 --> 03:42:34,200
I can't lose.

4400
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:35,000
What is this?

4401
03:42:35,280 --> 03:42:36,020
I cannot lose.

4402
03:42:36,080 --> 03:42:37,080
Toki, can I have some?

4403
03:42:37,640 --> 03:42:38,520
Can I have some?

4404
03:42:40,560 --> 03:42:41,060
Uh-oh.

4405
03:42:41,420 --> 03:42:42,680
I don't know why, but I couldn't hit him.

4406
03:42:44,220 --> 03:42:44,940
That's weird.

4407
03:42:45,580 --> 03:42:48,680
It was like I- Haku, I think there's something wrong with your mic.

4408
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:54,060
Oh, whoa, what?

4409
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:58,300
What?

4410
03:42:58,300 --> 03:43:00,900
Okay, I feel like there needs to be more light here.

4411
03:43:03,320 --> 03:43:05,440
I feel like there needs to be more light here.

4412
03:43:05,620 --> 03:43:08,700
I should not have a torch on to see where I am.

4413
03:43:11,620 --> 03:43:13,580
Alright, play for me and I'll give you scrap.

4414
03:43:21,860 --> 03:43:22,780
That was beautiful.

4415
03:43:22,980 --> 03:43:24,180
Here, take one scrap.

4416
03:43:25,620 --> 03:43:26,600
That was beautiful.

4417
03:43:26,800 --> 03:43:28,940
Now, go feed your fucking addiction.

4418
03:43:34,260 --> 03:43:34,780
Yeah.

4419
03:43:41,280 --> 03:43:42,480
Alright, we're leaving.

4420
03:43:46,900 --> 03:43:48,860
You're not coming back.

4421
03:43:51,320 --> 03:43:53,220
Oh, hey, it's daytime.

4422
03:43:54,340 --> 03:43:55,720
You wanna visit the Blood God church?

4423
03:43:57,180 --> 03:43:58,600
Let's see what they're up to.

4424
03:44:02,080 --> 03:44:03,660
Do you think he'll give us a gun?

4425
03:44:05,360 --> 03:44:08,460
I wanna see what my skin looks like.

4426
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:12,480
I just wanna know what my skin looks like.

4427
03:44:12,520 --> 03:44:13,160
That's it.

4428
03:44:17,460 --> 03:44:18,100
Hey,

4429
03:44:21,480 --> 03:44:21,860
what happened?

4430
03:44:21,960 --> 03:44:23,120
Did you encounter the bike gang?

4431
03:44:25,180 --> 03:44:25,980
Was it from the bike gang?

4432
03:44:27,220 --> 03:44:29,340
It's always the bike gang!

4433
03:44:30,280 --> 03:44:31,540
Every time!

4434
03:44:34,200 --> 03:44:35,940
Dina, it's on site.

4435
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:38,500
Lady Dima?

4436
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:40,960
Lady Dima?

4437
03:44:41,040 --> 03:44:41,640
Who's that?

4438
03:44:41,820 --> 03:44:42,920
Lady Dina?

4439
03:44:43,340 --> 03:44:43,700
Dina?

4440
03:44:43,860 --> 03:44:44,080
Dima?

4441
03:44:44,200 --> 03:44:44,640
I don't know.

4442
03:44:44,800 --> 03:44:45,520
And Winnie.

4443
03:44:45,880 --> 03:44:46,620
It's on site.

4444
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:48,840
Oh yeah, no, Winnie for sure.

4445
03:44:49,160 --> 03:44:50,000
Winnie's for sure.

4446
03:44:50,640 --> 03:44:52,640
I know they're in the bike gang.

4447
03:44:52,880 --> 03:44:56,260
If they ever pull up on you, you have to give them a skull.

4448
03:44:56,820 --> 03:44:57,200
Yeah, yeah.

4449
03:44:58,260 --> 03:44:59,880
You see that body up there?

4450
03:45:00,160 --> 03:45:00,880
Harvest the skull.

4451
03:45:00,880 --> 03:45:03,880
Yeah, take their skull and then you'll be fine.

4452
03:45:04,100 --> 03:45:05,800
They just need skulls.

4453
03:45:05,840 --> 03:45:06,600
That's all they want.

4454
03:45:11,920 --> 03:45:13,820
That's the only way to protect yourself.

4455
03:45:13,940 --> 03:45:14,880
You just got to...

4456
03:45:15,740 --> 03:45:17,820
Take this person's skull and you'll be fine.

4457
03:45:24,740 --> 03:45:26,000
Did you get a skull?

4458
03:45:30,980 --> 03:45:33,940
Okay, well, you got to find more people and take their skull.

4459
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:38,340
Alright, I'm gonna go... Let's go to the church.

4460
03:45:39,240 --> 03:45:40,020
Oh my God!

4461
03:45:40,340 --> 03:45:41,360
There's so many...

4462
03:45:42,080 --> 03:45:44,760
They got killed by an arrow!

4463
03:45:45,760 --> 03:45:46,360
Winnie's!

4464
03:45:46,720 --> 03:45:48,220
Wait, this is Winnie's!

4465
03:45:49,120 --> 03:45:50,860
He got one of them!

4466
03:45:53,460 --> 03:45:54,060
Revenge!

4467
03:45:56,680 --> 03:45:57,880
Take this!

4468
03:45:59,280 --> 03:46:00,520
Yeah, and that!

4469
03:46:02,320 --> 03:46:03,220
Here, Jiho.

4470
03:46:03,680 --> 03:46:04,640
Have this skull.

4471
03:46:07,420 --> 03:46:08,420
I have a key.

4472
03:46:08,600 --> 03:46:10,520
Why do I... What do I do with a key?

4473
03:46:12,060 --> 03:46:13,360
It was on their body.

4474
03:46:13,640 --> 03:46:14,160
I picked it up from their body.

4475
03:46:14,160 --> 03:46:14,680
No, no, no.

4476
03:46:14,740 --> 03:46:16,140
I have a key from somebody else.

4477
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:17,180
I don't know what it's for though.

4478
03:46:17,280 --> 03:46:18,240
I just said I picked it up from their body.

4479
03:46:20,000 --> 03:46:21,520
Oh, Jiho, am I seeing you tomorrow?

4480
03:46:22,140 --> 03:46:23,060
You picked me up from the airport.

4481
03:46:25,820 --> 03:46:27,480
There's a random door here.

4482
03:46:28,980 --> 03:46:29,860
Oh wait, yeah.

4483
03:46:30,060 --> 03:46:30,400
Yes, I do.

4484
03:46:30,480 --> 03:46:31,220
What if I starve?

4485
03:46:32,100 --> 03:46:33,840
What if I fucking starve, guys?

4486
03:46:33,940 --> 03:46:36,600
I need... I need all these pumpkins.

4487
03:46:36,880 --> 03:46:37,700
You don't know that!

4488
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:39,760
I can starve right now!

4489
03:46:41,200 --> 03:46:41,680
Hi!

4490
03:46:41,900 --> 03:46:42,180
Whoa!

4491
03:46:42,500 --> 03:46:42,760
Hello.

4492
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:44,780
What do you think about religion?

4493
03:46:44,860 --> 03:46:45,540
What do you think about religion?

4494
03:46:45,640 --> 03:46:46,380
Are you a religious person?

4495
03:46:46,380 --> 03:46:49,500
I think religion is pretty cool and that there's only...

4496
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:53,800
And there's only one God in this world.

4497
03:46:55,440 --> 03:46:56,740
And what God is it?

4498
03:46:57,480 --> 03:47:00,800
And it is a God that everybody believes in.

4499
03:47:03,360 --> 03:47:03,360
Okay.

4500
03:47:04,100 --> 03:47:04,460
Alright.

4501
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:05,600
Okay.

4502
03:47:06,220 --> 03:47:10,000
Are you... Are you interested in being part of something larger than yourself?

4503
03:47:10,540 --> 03:47:11,920
Larger than myself?

4504
03:47:12,400 --> 03:47:13,420
What does that mean?

4505
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:14,660
Yeah.

4506
03:47:15,880 --> 03:47:16,480
It means...

4507
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:17,860
Are we supposed to be...

4508
03:47:17,860 --> 03:47:21,200
Being a part of something that could have great ramifications later on.

4509
03:47:21,900 --> 03:47:23,220
And how... How is that?

4510
03:47:23,220 --> 03:47:23,380
Okay.

4511
03:47:26,520 --> 03:47:28,800
First, you have to play rock, paper, scissors against Kira.

4512
03:47:33,710 --> 03:47:34,270
Congratulations.

4513
03:47:35,310 --> 03:47:36,490
I did it!

4514
03:47:36,690 --> 03:47:37,410
You beat my first loss.

4515
03:47:37,650 --> 03:47:38,230
Come with me.

4516
03:47:38,330 --> 03:47:39,650
Your first loss?

4517
03:47:39,790 --> 03:47:41,030
Am I...

4518
03:47:41,030 --> 03:47:42,170
Is it destiny?

4519
03:47:43,190 --> 03:47:44,190
I was...

4520
03:47:44,190 --> 03:47:45,250
Come on.

4521
03:47:45,670 --> 03:47:46,230
Congratulations.

4522
03:47:47,470 --> 03:47:48,850
Good old rock.

4523
03:47:49,030 --> 03:47:50,570
Nothing beats...

4524
03:47:50,570 --> 03:47:52,210
Guys, I think I fucked up.

4525
03:47:52,510 --> 03:47:53,290
This is our church.

4526
03:47:54,610 --> 03:47:55,510
This is...

4527
03:47:55,810 --> 03:47:57,610
This is where we have regular sermons.

4528
03:47:58,970 --> 03:48:00,170
This is Gimmick.

4529
03:48:00,750 --> 03:48:00,930
Hello.

4530
03:48:01,190 --> 03:48:02,430
Why are your names red?

4531
03:48:03,890 --> 03:48:05,770
I was told that red means bad.

4532
03:48:06,070 --> 03:48:07,070
Gimmick had to defend himself.

4533
03:48:08,690 --> 03:48:12,050
Gimmick was forced to defend himself in a big attack.

4534
03:48:12,410 --> 03:48:13,350
It's not his fault.

4535
03:48:14,390 --> 03:48:15,410
I see.

4536
03:48:17,430 --> 03:48:18,830
But you lived though.

4537
03:48:18,970 --> 03:48:20,910
For what we believe in here.

4538
03:48:22,070 --> 03:48:23,930
Is Gimmick a part of the church?

4539
03:48:25,270 --> 03:48:25,410
Yes.

4540
03:48:25,870 --> 03:48:27,910
I am an acolyte, but...

4541
03:48:28,630 --> 03:48:29,970
Gimmick was baptized.

4542
03:48:31,250 --> 03:48:35,750
I was baptized, but they're still crafting my medallion.

4543
03:48:36,130 --> 03:48:37,570
Were you circumcised?

4544
03:48:38,990 --> 03:48:39,890
Oh, yes.

4545
03:48:40,150 --> 03:48:40,890
I did it myself.

4546
03:48:41,350 --> 03:48:41,930
Oh, yeah?

4547
03:48:42,190 --> 03:48:42,930
Like, now?

4548
03:48:43,330 --> 03:48:43,890
Just then?

4549
03:48:46,310 --> 03:48:47,310
That's a very...

4550
03:48:47,310 --> 03:48:47,810
Would you like some food?

4551
03:48:47,810 --> 03:48:48,750
Are you hungry?

4552
03:48:48,750 --> 03:48:50,810
I was feeding a hungry.

4553
03:48:55,260 --> 03:48:56,680
Feel that slip out.

4554
03:48:58,940 --> 03:49:00,980
So, what do I win for...

4555
03:49:01,580 --> 03:49:03,840
What do I win for winning Rock, Paper, Scissors?

4556
03:49:04,560 --> 03:49:05,380
Thank you.

4557
03:49:06,640 --> 03:49:08,600
You get to join the church.

4558
03:49:08,820 --> 03:49:10,160
I get to join the church?

4559
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:11,520
Isn't that great?

4560
03:49:12,700 --> 03:49:14,580
Yeah, you get to be a part of the church.

4561
03:49:14,940 --> 03:49:19,000
Did everybody else win Rock, Paper, Scissors to join the church too?

4562
03:49:20,980 --> 03:49:25,100
So, you have no idea how big an honor it is to be able to join the church.

4563
03:49:25,980 --> 03:49:27,120
Oh, my God.

4564
03:49:27,440 --> 03:49:28,340
That's a big honor.

4565
03:49:28,660 --> 03:49:30,300
But nobody else defeated him before.

4566
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:31,920
How are you guys part of the church?

4567
03:49:35,380 --> 03:49:35,820
Well...

4568
03:49:37,780 --> 03:49:42,940
Listen, it's very complicated to explain.

4569
03:49:43,560 --> 03:49:44,760
It's a church business.

4570
03:49:44,780 --> 03:49:46,360
You'll just have to take our word for it.

4571
03:49:47,260 --> 03:49:48,800
It's a church business.

4572
03:49:49,440 --> 03:49:53,160
Oh, so recruitment was changed later on, right?

4573
03:49:53,380 --> 03:49:55,980
Recruitment was just changed later on.

4574
03:49:59,600 --> 03:50:07,500
It's a counterclockwise-esque rotation with a semi-MLM system built in.

4575
03:50:07,820 --> 03:50:16,060
If you refer two people to the church, you'll be entitled to 50% of their church donations.

4576
03:50:16,060 --> 03:50:25,200
And if the two people you refer to the church, refer two people to the church, you'll be entitled to 25% of the donations of those two people.

4577
03:50:26,200 --> 03:50:27,840
Wait, I know somebody.

4578
03:50:28,440 --> 03:50:30,940
Gumi, have you heard about this church?

4579
03:50:33,240 --> 03:50:33,980
She's shy.

4580
03:50:35,320 --> 03:50:36,860
She's shy right now.

4581
03:50:42,140 --> 03:50:45,400
We have an exciting opportunity for you.

4582
03:50:47,040 --> 03:50:49,540
Come here, we have an exciting opportunity.

4583
03:50:50,800 --> 03:50:53,260
We have an exciting opportunity for you.

4584
03:50:55,400 --> 03:50:57,520
So how do you join this church?

4585
03:51:00,320 --> 03:51:00,640
Really?

4586
03:51:01,980 --> 03:51:04,140
It's part of your earnings, yeah.

4587
03:51:05,060 --> 03:51:06,380
Oh my god, thank you!

4588
03:51:06,980 --> 03:51:10,780
The more people you refer to the church, the more you stand to earn.

4589
03:51:10,780 --> 03:51:13,080
Oh, that sounds so exciting!

4590
03:51:13,420 --> 03:51:16,020
That sounds like a bargain right there.

4591
03:51:16,080 --> 03:51:19,160
I can become, like, rich by being in this church.

4592
03:51:22,060 --> 03:51:24,880
Yes, and you wake up with a sense of purpose.

4593
03:51:25,160 --> 03:51:30,100
Every morning you wake up knowing today will be a meaningful day.

4594
03:51:32,980 --> 03:51:33,640
How do you taunt?

4595
03:51:33,640 --> 03:51:34,620
I have no idea.

4596
03:51:35,940 --> 03:51:37,340
You just use your mouth.

4597
03:51:38,420 --> 03:51:40,160
You don't join the church, Gumi.

4598
03:51:41,800 --> 03:51:43,080
Simply to get rich.

4599
03:51:43,760 --> 03:51:45,780
The church is so much more than that.

4600
03:51:46,720 --> 03:51:48,820
What else do you have here, then?

4601
03:51:48,960 --> 03:51:50,040
What did you call me?

4602
03:51:50,280 --> 03:51:51,680
That's not my name.

4603
03:51:51,940 --> 03:51:53,220
We have blood!

4604
03:51:54,960 --> 03:51:56,420
Blood is what we have!

4605
03:51:57,200 --> 03:51:58,860
I have blood in my body.

4606
03:51:59,140 --> 03:52:00,800
That's not my name.

4607
03:52:01,080 --> 03:52:01,940
Sometimes we have more.

4608
03:52:05,720 --> 03:52:15,320
Blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood...

4609
03:52:17,560 --> 03:52:21,840
Blood, we've got blood.

4610
03:52:24,760 --> 03:52:26,260
We slip it in.

4611
03:52:27,220 --> 03:52:27,520
What?

4612
03:52:27,520 --> 03:52:30,260
A little taste of blood goes a long way with the blood...

4613
03:52:34,220 --> 03:52:35,540
Yeah, just blood, right?

4614
03:52:35,540 --> 03:52:36,760
Just blood, right?

4615
03:52:38,420 --> 03:52:39,220
Just blood.

4616
03:52:39,300 --> 03:52:39,880
Yes, blood.

4617
03:52:40,200 --> 03:52:41,360
Yeah, of course, blood.

4618
03:52:43,000 --> 03:52:43,240
Yeah.

4619
03:52:45,380 --> 03:52:46,960
The fluid of mankind.

4620
03:52:48,280 --> 03:52:53,380
It will be on the floor when you slip on it.

4621
03:52:53,440 --> 03:52:55,340
That's what he was intending to say with that.

4622
03:52:56,660 --> 03:52:58,580
What color is the fluid?

4623
03:52:58,780 --> 03:53:00,160
What color is the fluid?

4624
03:53:00,700 --> 03:53:01,620
What color is it?

4625
03:53:29,120 --> 03:53:34,200
Oh, praise be, praise be.

4626
03:53:38,440 --> 03:53:39,900
It's now Gummiho.

4627
03:53:46,700 --> 03:53:48,480
How does one join this church?

4628
03:53:48,480 --> 03:53:53,240
It's Gummiho, it's Gummi, Gummiho.

4629
03:53:54,120 --> 03:53:56,160
This is Clayton's erotic roleplay.

4630
03:54:06,570 --> 03:54:10,850
This is beautiful, beautiful voice.

4631
03:54:25,150 --> 03:54:29,250
Oh, the beat, he's dropping a beat right now.

4632
03:54:36,070 --> 03:54:38,550
He's been blessed by the gods.

4633
03:54:38,790 --> 03:54:39,570
Hit it.

4634
03:54:48,330 --> 03:54:49,730
Hallelujah.

4635
03:55:03,950 --> 03:55:05,350
I

4636
03:55:15,840 --> 03:55:17,360
got it.

4637
03:55:24,240 --> 03:55:25,600
Hit it.

4638
03:55:36,840 --> 03:55:37,440
Yeah.

4639
03:55:43,560 --> 03:55:45,800
That is crazy.

4640
03:55:46,220 --> 03:55:48,360
We should get, we should go here more often.

4641
03:55:53,760 --> 03:55:56,400
I got it.

4642
03:55:58,620 --> 03:56:00,860
Metaphorically, of course, metaphorically.

4643
03:56:01,980 --> 03:56:04,100
The slip into your heart spirit.

4644
03:56:05,680 --> 03:56:08,000
Wait, wait, wait.

4645
03:56:08,100 --> 03:56:10,120
Slipping into my, not the back door, right?

4646
03:56:10,520 --> 03:56:11,780
Can you use the front door?

4647
03:56:11,900 --> 03:56:13,100
I don't want to use the back door.

4648
03:56:16,400 --> 03:56:16,880
Bro,

4649
03:56:20,140 --> 03:56:21,780
I think I joined the wrong religion.

4650
03:56:21,940 --> 03:56:22,540
You know what?

4651
03:56:23,100 --> 03:56:28,240
Even the blood god sold out, at least the, at least the tracks on fire.

4652
03:56:29,000 --> 03:56:34,220
At least, at least the tracks on fire.

4653
03:56:59,720 --> 03:57:01,620
How do you emote, guys?

4654
03:57:02,100 --> 03:57:02,880
How do you emote?

4655
03:57:05,120 --> 03:57:08,020
Is that in the, is that in the book of the blood god?

4656
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:13,100
Where can I purchase the book of the blood god?

4657
03:57:22,880 --> 03:57:24,080
Praise be.

4658
03:57:36,020 --> 03:57:37,460
Wait, so who is true?

4659
03:57:39,480 --> 03:57:39,980
Ooh.

4660
03:57:53,780 --> 03:57:55,100
I don't know.

4661
03:57:55,760 --> 03:57:56,660
They don't know.

4662
03:57:56,720 --> 03:57:57,260
They don't know.

4663
03:57:57,360 --> 03:57:58,940
They didn't see anything, guys.

4664
03:57:59,040 --> 03:57:59,680
They don't know.

4665
03:58:00,440 --> 03:58:01,420
Hey, Blau.

4666
03:58:01,500 --> 03:58:02,300
Hey, Blau.

4667
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:03,460
Hey, Sir Blau.

4668
03:58:04,980 --> 03:58:06,540
We got skulls!

4669
03:58:07,900 --> 03:58:08,400
Hey!

4670
03:58:11,660 --> 03:58:12,300
Hey there!

4671
03:58:13,260 --> 03:58:14,320
I'm up here!

4672
03:58:16,100 --> 03:58:17,060
Oh, really?

4673
03:58:19,440 --> 03:58:20,000
Chip!

4674
03:58:21,760 --> 03:58:23,000
Oh my god, dingles!

4675
03:58:23,820 --> 03:58:24,220
I did.

4676
03:58:24,540 --> 03:58:25,860
They never saw me.

4677
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:26,600
How'd you do?

4678
03:58:26,840 --> 03:58:27,340
You look good.

4679
03:58:30,560 --> 03:58:32,780
Every orifice was filled with arrows.

4680
03:58:33,700 --> 03:58:39,480
And they dragged my hooks up to the back of my motorcycle and dragged me through the mountains.

4681
03:58:41,360 --> 03:58:42,780
We didn't get caught, guys.

4682
03:58:42,900 --> 03:58:43,560
We didn't get caught.

4683
03:58:46,460 --> 03:58:47,640
We didn't get caught.

4684
03:58:48,660 --> 03:58:51,440
Hey, how are you?

4685
03:58:52,120 --> 03:58:53,560
Guys, we didn't get caught.

4686
03:58:53,740 --> 03:58:54,600
We didn't get caught.

4687
03:59:01,880 --> 03:59:03,120
What's going on?

4688
03:59:03,120 --> 03:59:04,660
He offered the pumpkin seeds.

4689
03:59:07,380 --> 03:59:13,200
I don't know what you guys are talking about, man.

4690
03:59:13,740 --> 03:59:16,700
Yes, the blood god brings me back so often.

4691
03:59:17,680 --> 03:59:18,660
Wait, was that Charlie?

4692
03:59:19,960 --> 03:59:22,360
Of course, his name is Juice Man.

4693
03:59:22,840 --> 03:59:23,240
Of course.

4694
03:59:23,240 --> 03:59:26,220
Of course.

4695
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:39,280
I was not involved in that.

4696
03:59:39,480 --> 03:59:40,320
I just showed up.

4697
03:59:41,580 --> 03:59:43,120
Quest this, quest that.

4698
03:59:43,220 --> 03:59:43,580
You know what?

4699
03:59:43,620 --> 03:59:45,940
You got an itchy trigger finger.

4700
03:59:47,100 --> 03:59:51,040
Those are some accusations right there.

4701
03:59:51,460 --> 03:59:52,360
Is that true?

4702
03:59:54,520 --> 03:59:58,240
Do not shed blood in front of a holy site.

4703
04:00:00,360 --> 04:00:02,420
Rangers, this is the blood god's territory.

4704
04:00:02,740 --> 04:00:03,700
Ride back to the ice fort.

4705
04:00:04,860 --> 04:00:07,960
I'm shitting out stone hatchets, oh my lord.

4706
04:00:09,740 --> 04:00:11,260
It's time, it's time.

4707
04:00:13,360 --> 04:00:14,340
Onwards, brethren.

4708
04:00:14,800 --> 04:00:16,220
Are we going back to the fortress?

4709
04:00:16,740 --> 04:00:18,480
I need you to acquire horses.

4710
04:00:18,980 --> 04:00:22,160
Watch your six, you Australian fuck.

4711
04:00:26,460 --> 04:00:28,060
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

4712
04:00:32,680 --> 04:00:34,220
Where the fuck do we get horses?

4713
04:00:34,440 --> 04:00:35,680
Wow, shit, okay.

4714
04:00:36,060 --> 04:00:37,520
Where the fuck do we get horses?

4715
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:41,740
Oh,

4716
04:00:49,460 --> 04:00:52,000
there's a boar in front of us, by the way.

4717
04:00:52,060 --> 04:00:53,320
There's a boar in front of us.

4718
04:00:53,320 --> 04:00:54,440
Oh, there's a metal horse.

4719
04:00:55,540 --> 04:00:56,980
Oh, there's a metal horse.

4720
04:00:58,380 --> 04:00:59,000
Harvest!

4721
04:00:59,000 --> 04:01:01,240
We do this London style, brothers.

4722
04:01:01,300 --> 04:01:01,900
Harvesting!

4723
04:01:02,960 --> 04:01:04,240
Harvest the boar again.

4724
04:01:06,500 --> 04:01:07,740
We are the lurkers.

4725
04:01:08,360 --> 04:01:09,420
We are the lurkers.

4726
04:01:09,420 --> 04:01:09,940
We are the ice fortress.

4727
04:01:10,220 --> 04:01:11,060
We bow to no kings.

4728
04:01:11,840 --> 04:01:12,900
Ice fortress.

4729
04:01:14,160 --> 04:01:17,820
I've dropped off 80 scrap at your abode, Mr. Bo.

4730
04:01:17,940 --> 04:01:19,600
I left it with brother Neeks.

4731
04:01:19,660 --> 04:01:20,400
80 scrap?

4732
04:01:20,820 --> 04:01:21,640
Hell yeah.

4733
04:01:21,640 --> 04:01:24,040
You should come by later to gamble.

4734
04:01:24,340 --> 04:01:26,800
You have needs of the devil's metal?

4735
04:01:27,200 --> 04:01:28,500
Here, Mr. Bo.

4736
04:01:29,120 --> 04:01:29,920
Eat up.

4737
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:31,540
We do actually have need of the devil's metal.

4738
04:01:32,060 --> 04:01:33,680
Under your bike.

4739
04:01:34,900 --> 04:01:36,460
Oh, his inventory is full.

4740
04:01:44,180 --> 04:01:45,800
It's okay, you don't need shoes.

4741
04:01:45,980 --> 04:01:47,080
You don't need shoes.

4742
04:01:48,840 --> 04:01:50,360
Shoes is just aesthetic.

4743
04:01:50,700 --> 04:01:51,780
Let those toes free.

4744
04:01:51,780 --> 04:01:53,400
Who's this?

4745
04:01:54,040 --> 04:01:54,880
Who goes there?

4746
04:01:55,340 --> 04:01:56,020
Oh, Neutron!

4747
04:01:56,240 --> 04:01:56,920
What's up, dude?

4748
04:01:57,960 --> 04:01:59,240
Hey, baby, what's up?

4749
04:01:59,440 --> 04:02:04,000
I can't get over the fucking change of talking.

4750
04:02:04,240 --> 04:02:05,080
Who goes there?

4751
04:02:05,180 --> 04:02:06,420
Yo, what's up, bro?

4752
04:02:14,100 --> 04:02:15,300
I can't.

4753
04:02:15,520 --> 04:02:17,060
I fucking can't.

4754
04:02:17,660 --> 04:02:18,260
Yeah?

4755
04:02:22,420 --> 04:02:23,180
Yeah?

4756
04:02:26,320 --> 04:02:32,040
Maybe he's not going to be...

4757
04:02:33,360 --> 04:02:34,120
Alright.

4758
04:02:36,960 --> 04:02:38,720
We gotta get the rock?

4759
04:02:38,900 --> 04:02:40,520
Alright, let's go to the rock.

4760
04:02:41,300 --> 04:02:42,300
We shall walk.

4761
04:02:44,300 --> 04:02:44,760
Yeah?

4762
04:02:48,780 --> 04:02:50,240
I like the idea.

4763
04:02:50,320 --> 04:02:52,120
I like the idea very much.

4764
04:02:57,340 --> 04:02:59,480
Oh, you saw horses this way?

4765
04:03:10,100 --> 04:03:12,220
Is there horses there?

4766
04:03:15,220 --> 04:03:15,980
That is...

4767
04:03:15,980 --> 04:03:16,980
No, that's not a horse.

4768
04:03:17,080 --> 04:03:18,920
That's just wood.

4769
04:03:20,520 --> 04:03:22,260
There has to be horses near...

4770
04:03:22,260 --> 04:03:24,320
Somebody has to ride a horse near us.

4771
04:03:29,140 --> 04:03:30,880
Yeah, but I think they just kept going, Goomy.

4772
04:03:31,040 --> 04:03:33,340
I think they just kept running.

4773
04:03:35,460 --> 04:03:38,420
Let's just keep going until we find somebody and take the horse.

4774
04:03:43,300 --> 04:03:45,360
Guys, I can't work on an AK.

4775
04:03:45,560 --> 04:03:47,180
I might be banished from Bahala.

4776
04:03:47,180 --> 04:03:49,660
I have to mooch off somebody else's AK.

4777
04:03:50,600 --> 04:03:53,520
If somebody else makes an AK...

4778
04:03:53,520 --> 04:03:56,060
and then gives it to me...

4779
04:03:56,060 --> 04:03:56,940
then that's different.

4780
04:03:57,100 --> 04:03:57,900
Oh, shit.

4781
04:04:04,910 --> 04:04:05,590
He's dead.

4782
04:04:05,650 --> 04:04:06,050
He's dead.

4783
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:16,200
We gotta...

4784
04:04:16,740 --> 04:04:18,740
Yeah, we gotta...

4785
04:04:19,580 --> 04:04:20,420
Wait, is that a horse?

4786
04:04:23,100 --> 04:04:24,140
Is that a horse?

4787
04:04:26,740 --> 04:04:27,440
Is that a horse?

4788
04:04:29,660 --> 04:04:31,420
He's looking at me.

4789
04:04:33,820 --> 04:04:34,960
That's fine.

4790
04:04:38,680 --> 04:04:39,960
Oh, shit.

4791
04:04:43,320 --> 04:04:44,740
What the fuck?

4792
04:04:44,860 --> 04:04:46,200
His gun is insane.

4793
04:04:50,440 --> 04:04:51,520
Oh, my God.

4794
04:04:51,640 --> 04:04:53,300
His gun is fucking insane.

4795
04:05:03,440 --> 04:05:06,400
Oh, my God.

4796
04:05:16,060 --> 04:05:17,240
Wait, there's another horse.

4797
04:05:17,340 --> 04:05:17,660
There's another.

4798
04:05:18,000 --> 04:05:18,900
Two horses.

4799
04:05:22,220 --> 04:05:22,700
No.

4800
04:05:26,260 --> 04:05:27,380
Hey, we're here to trade.

4801
04:05:27,500 --> 04:05:28,380
We're here to trade.

4802
04:05:34,080 --> 04:05:35,520
We're just here to trade.

4803
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:42,460
We need him a bit closer, guys.

4804
04:05:47,720 --> 04:05:49,340
We need him.

4805
04:05:54,680 --> 04:05:55,320
Whoa.

4806
04:05:57,700 --> 04:05:59,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4807
04:06:07,360 --> 04:06:08,860
How did he know?

4808
04:06:09,080 --> 04:06:11,240
How did he know?

4809
04:06:16,200 --> 04:06:16,680
Wait.

4810
04:06:18,480 --> 04:06:20,220
Oh, he's shooting behind us.

4811
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:22,420
He's trying to snipe.

4812
04:06:23,140 --> 04:06:24,080
And he's going back.

4813
04:06:24,160 --> 04:06:24,720
He's a coward.

4814
04:06:24,920 --> 04:06:26,400
He went back to the safe zone.

4815
04:06:29,400 --> 04:06:30,560
He's a coward.

4816
04:06:31,580 --> 04:06:32,820
He's not a real fight.

4817
04:06:32,880 --> 04:06:33,740
He's not a real man.

4818
04:06:34,540 --> 04:06:36,000
He's not a real man.

4819
04:06:36,020 --> 04:06:37,500
He doesn't fight fair.

4820
04:06:38,520 --> 04:06:40,420
As I say, we're traitors.

4821
04:06:44,550 --> 04:06:47,920
We don't use cheesy tactics like that.

4822
04:06:48,240 --> 04:06:49,460
He lacks honor.

4823
04:06:53,510 --> 04:06:55,440
Oh, that was my bet, isn't that?

4824
04:06:59,360 --> 04:07:03,380
I think we should have our bows like sheathed so they don't know.

4825
04:07:05,360 --> 04:07:06,240
Behind us?

4826
04:07:10,400 --> 04:07:10,960
Where?

4827
04:07:14,980 --> 04:07:16,600
Oh, he's like hiding.

4828
04:07:21,000 --> 04:07:23,220
I mean, his name was Red.

4829
04:07:23,280 --> 04:07:24,060
I don't think we...

4830
04:07:24,060 --> 04:07:25,420
I think he's killed us.

4831
04:07:27,140 --> 04:07:28,780
I'm pretty sure.

4832
04:07:31,700 --> 04:07:32,340
Alright,

4833
04:07:38,280 --> 04:07:39,620
we got to...

4834
04:07:39,620 --> 04:07:40,640
We're almost there.

4835
04:07:41,420 --> 04:07:42,080
Where is everybody?

4836
04:07:42,480 --> 04:07:43,380
Everybody's back.

4837
04:07:46,200 --> 04:07:48,980
He lurks in the bushes ready for an ambush.

4838
04:07:49,380 --> 04:07:51,580
Alright, as soon as we finish the last meeting.

4839
04:07:51,960 --> 04:07:54,220
Whatever the meeting is at the rocks.

4840
04:07:54,220 --> 04:07:55,700
We're going to call it.

4841
04:07:56,060 --> 04:07:58,520
Because I want to rest a little bit before my...

4842
04:07:58,520 --> 04:08:01,360
Before Silent Hill.

4843
04:08:02,380 --> 04:08:03,300
That's a scientist.

4844
04:08:03,520 --> 04:08:04,320
That's a scientist.

4845
04:08:10,440 --> 04:08:11,260
It's okay.

4846
04:08:11,340 --> 04:08:11,960
He'll live.

4847
04:08:12,040 --> 04:08:12,660
He'll survive.

4848
04:08:12,920 --> 04:08:13,540
He is strong.

4849
04:08:20,490 --> 04:08:21,610
Wait, he's here.

4850
04:08:21,670 --> 04:08:22,310
He's back.

4851
04:08:28,130 --> 04:08:30,130
Okay, I need to know the drop off for this.

4852
04:08:30,210 --> 04:08:31,850
I need to know.

4853
04:08:32,650 --> 04:08:35,570
I can't believe he's trying to do a hit and run.

4854
04:08:42,190 --> 04:08:43,110
Where is he?

4855
04:08:45,350 --> 04:08:46,510
I don't see him.

4856
04:08:50,000 --> 04:08:51,280
Wait, did Gumi die?

4857
04:08:51,360 --> 04:08:52,340
Or did she road forward?

4858
04:08:59,910 --> 04:09:00,370
Oh.

4859
04:09:05,410 --> 04:09:06,470
Where was she?

4860
04:09:06,470 --> 04:09:06,510
Where was she?

4861
04:09:08,350 --> 04:09:09,750
Did she die?

4862
04:09:14,010 --> 04:09:17,130
Maybe we shouldn't have shot him, guys.

4863
04:09:17,470 --> 04:09:18,230
Maybe...

4864
04:09:20,410 --> 04:09:23,110
Maybe we shouldn't have shot him.

4865
04:09:25,640 --> 04:09:27,590
Maybe that was a mistake.

4866
04:09:31,870 --> 04:09:33,750
Did she die?

4867
04:09:33,870 --> 04:09:34,970
I think she did.

4868
04:09:34,970 --> 04:09:36,290
I don't see her.

4869
04:09:39,690 --> 04:09:42,710
Yeah, we definitely should not have tried to shoot that guy.

4870
04:09:42,950 --> 04:09:44,610
That guy was...

4871
04:09:44,610 --> 04:09:45,610
He was...

4872
04:09:45,610 --> 04:09:47,270
A little scary.

4873
04:09:52,430 --> 04:09:55,270
He seemed like he knew what he was doing, chat.

4874
04:09:58,210 --> 04:10:01,590
One day I'll know what an AK is like.

4875
04:10:01,890 --> 04:10:06,050
One day I'll know what it's like to hold my gun.

4876
04:10:09,850 --> 04:10:10,290
One day I'll know what it's like to hold my gun.

4877
04:10:10,290 --> 04:10:11,370
Yeah, I'm heading back right now.

4878
04:10:11,450 --> 04:10:12,370
I think she bled out.

4879
04:10:13,810 --> 04:10:15,430
Wait, whose bed is this?

4880
04:10:17,590 --> 04:10:18,670
It's not my bed.

4881
04:10:18,970 --> 04:10:20,090
This is a cute bed.

4882
04:10:21,850 --> 04:10:22,990
It's pretty cute.

4883
04:10:23,290 --> 04:10:23,930
Not gonna lie.

4884
04:10:24,030 --> 04:10:25,750
Oh my god, look at our house!

4885
04:10:26,750 --> 04:10:28,470
Now it has a pee pee tower!

4886
04:10:30,630 --> 04:10:32,870
It has a pee pee tower now!

4887
04:10:46,970 --> 04:10:48,030
Let's go!

4888
04:10:48,510 --> 04:10:49,470
Alright, let's go in.

4889
04:10:50,370 --> 04:10:51,730
We're at our place.

4890
04:10:52,170 --> 04:10:53,970
My old body is still there.

4891
04:11:11,220 --> 04:11:13,280
Let me put some stuff away.

4892
04:11:13,940 --> 04:11:16,360
I have too much stuff that I don't need.

4893
04:11:17,900 --> 04:11:18,760
Oh wait.

4894
04:11:18,960 --> 04:11:20,020
I need my arrows.

4895
04:11:23,000 --> 04:11:24,580
And then I'll put this away.

4896
04:11:24,580 --> 04:11:26,060
And then...

4897
04:11:27,140 --> 04:11:28,480
The what bucket?

4898
04:11:32,120 --> 04:11:34,320
Oh yeah, I wanna keep all of my scrap.

4899
04:11:38,500 --> 04:11:39,900
Did you live?

4900
04:11:40,160 --> 04:11:40,800
You lived!

4901
04:11:42,720 --> 04:11:43,560
You survived!

4902
04:11:48,940 --> 04:11:49,980
Oh shit!

4903
04:11:50,040 --> 04:11:51,360
I don't think we should have shot that guy.

4904
04:11:57,480 --> 04:11:58,280
No!

4905
04:11:59,420 --> 04:12:00,220
No!

4906
04:12:00,580 --> 04:12:00,640
No medal!

4907
04:12:04,140 --> 04:12:05,500
No medal!

4908
04:12:08,280 --> 04:12:09,780
Is this a stable?

4909
04:12:13,100 --> 04:12:15,780
Oh my god!

4910
04:12:15,840 --> 04:12:16,740
Look at all our horses!

4911
04:12:17,420 --> 04:12:18,740
All three of them!

4912
04:12:21,100 --> 04:12:22,060
They don't know.

4913
04:12:22,060 --> 04:12:23,420
They don't know.

4914
04:12:26,420 --> 04:12:28,000
Wait, he's over here!

4915
04:12:30,140 --> 04:12:31,660
He's looking at us!

4916
04:12:52,060 --> 04:12:54,320
I'm not, I'm just uh...

4917
04:12:54,780 --> 04:12:55,980
I am, I'm not shooting!

4918
04:12:55,980 --> 04:12:56,840
We're not shooting!

4919
04:12:57,580 --> 04:12:58,320
We're here in your house.

4920
04:12:59,360 --> 04:13:01,880
I'm nice, I'm actually nice.

4921
04:13:04,240 --> 04:13:06,220
Do you remember the last time this happened?

4922
04:13:06,420 --> 04:13:07,100
It's a peaceful offering.

4923
04:13:07,200 --> 04:13:08,900
He brings metal material!

4924
04:13:09,500 --> 04:13:10,920
He's trying to take the shot!

4925
04:13:11,580 --> 04:13:13,360
He's trying to take the shot!

4926
04:13:13,720 --> 04:13:15,500
Oh my god, it's all metal!

4927
04:13:16,720 --> 04:13:17,920
It's so disgusting!

4928
04:13:18,700 --> 04:13:19,860
Take a shot, take the shot.

4929
04:13:19,860 --> 04:13:21,360
It's so disgusting!

4930
04:13:22,380 --> 04:13:23,060
Take the shot.

4931
04:13:23,400 --> 04:13:24,120
He shot you.

4932
04:13:24,700 --> 04:13:25,820
He shot you.

4933
04:13:26,300 --> 04:13:27,340
He shot you.

4934
04:13:28,700 --> 04:13:32,120
He shot you though.

4935
04:13:33,180 --> 04:13:33,940
Oh my god!

4936
04:13:34,220 --> 04:13:34,360
Wow.

4937
04:13:34,740 --> 04:13:35,880
Oh my!

4938
04:13:38,420 --> 04:13:38,560
Wow.

4939
04:13:39,600 --> 04:13:40,460
Thank you so much, sir.

4940
04:13:41,160 --> 04:13:42,840
Welcome to the land of the free people.

4941
04:13:43,960 --> 04:13:47,520
Welcome to the land of the free people.

4942
04:13:48,380 --> 04:13:49,840
Welcome to the land of the free people.

4943
04:13:49,840 --> 04:13:50,700
Welcome.

4944
04:13:55,540 --> 04:13:57,400
I almost took the shot.

4945
04:13:57,760 --> 04:13:59,580
I almost took the shot.

4946
04:13:59,780 --> 04:14:01,360
I wanted to do it.

4947
04:14:01,880 --> 04:14:06,480
I- I wanted to assassinate him.

4948
04:14:07,440 --> 04:14:08,780
I almost did it.

4949
04:14:12,780 --> 04:14:14,580
You're getting louder!

4950
04:14:15,240 --> 04:14:17,120
The voices are getting louder!

4951
04:14:20,040 --> 04:14:20,480
Oh.

4952
04:14:23,980 --> 04:14:25,820
Sorry, I may have- Hold on.

4953
04:14:26,360 --> 04:14:27,380
This is very awkward.

4954
04:14:27,600 --> 04:14:28,260
Sorry about that.

4955
04:14:35,380 --> 04:14:35,960
What's up?

4956
04:14:36,700 --> 04:14:39,760
20 minutes ago, y'all were in front of our kingdom, okay?

4957
04:14:39,780 --> 04:14:41,080
I don't want to hear this.

4958
04:14:41,120 --> 04:14:42,340
I don't want to hear this nonsense.

4959
04:14:42,560 --> 04:14:43,420
We just came back.

4960
04:14:43,660 --> 04:14:44,640
That's a good point.

4961
04:14:45,200 --> 04:14:47,720
Both of y'all were right in front of our kingdom.

4962
04:14:48,960 --> 04:14:51,200
Everything was fine and dandy.

4963
04:14:52,460 --> 04:14:53,880
Now all of a sudden, you're upset.

4964
04:14:54,420 --> 04:14:54,940
Calm down, guys.

4965
04:14:55,940 --> 04:14:56,560
Calm down.

4966
04:14:57,220 --> 04:14:58,360
What's the evidence?

4967
04:14:58,700 --> 04:14:59,800
Oh my goodness.

4968
04:15:01,120 --> 04:15:02,840
But it's made out of metal, sir.

4969
04:15:02,940 --> 04:15:03,480
You broke one.

4970
04:15:03,660 --> 04:15:04,340
Oh my god.

4971
04:15:05,140 --> 04:15:06,820
I don't know if we can move all of that.

4972
04:15:08,140 --> 04:15:09,260
Does it not burn your hand?

4973
04:15:09,260 --> 04:15:09,760
We need to build magic.

4974
04:15:11,100 --> 04:15:12,420
It does not.

4975
04:15:12,920 --> 04:15:14,480
Oh, you're gonna go just do that?

4976
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:15,880
No, man.

4977
04:15:19,440 --> 04:15:21,820
Oh yes, that's correct for now.

4978
04:15:21,820 --> 04:15:23,640
I saw a king.

4979
04:15:24,900 --> 04:15:26,280
I think you have to come up with the horse.

4980
04:15:27,040 --> 04:15:28,320
I'm simply head of the kingdom.

4981
04:15:29,060 --> 04:15:31,020
I'm an acting king at the moment.

4982
04:15:31,760 --> 04:15:39,820
Your clan is beefing because they walked up to us and now they're upset we walked up to them.

4983
04:15:40,740 --> 04:15:41,920
This is our home.

4984
04:15:43,040 --> 04:15:46,300
Why are you guys building all the way out here?

4985
04:15:47,640 --> 04:15:48,760
It's the frost.

4986
04:15:48,920 --> 04:15:49,820
It's the frost.

4987
04:15:49,820 --> 04:15:51,380
This is where we live.

4988
04:15:55,520 --> 04:15:58,100
Did you not hear how he talked to our king?

4989
04:15:59,920 --> 04:16:02,080
Did you not hear how he talked to the king?

4990
04:16:20,780 --> 04:16:22,340
Where did he go?

4991
04:16:34,680 --> 04:16:36,460
We get a horse!

4992
04:16:36,680 --> 04:16:37,740
We get his horse!

4993
04:16:38,600 --> 04:16:39,640
That's right!

4994
04:16:41,500 --> 04:16:42,100
Yes!

4995
04:16:43,180 --> 04:16:44,660
I took the shot!

4996
04:16:49,680 --> 04:16:50,920
Harvest him!

4997
04:16:51,720 --> 04:16:54,500
I have the bone!

4998
04:16:57,660 --> 04:16:59,940
Did you get it?

4999
04:17:04,820 --> 04:17:06,680
The skull of blueprint.

5000
04:17:07,700 --> 04:17:08,600
It's time.

5001
04:17:08,760 --> 04:17:09,800
We got the king.

5002
04:17:10,260 --> 04:17:12,120
The battle is won.

5003
04:17:12,720 --> 04:17:13,840
How do I get off?

5004
04:17:13,860 --> 04:17:15,940
I got another horse in the collection!

5005
04:17:19,280 --> 04:17:21,100
I got one stuck.

5006
04:17:22,360 --> 04:17:23,920
You can lead them out.

5007
04:17:24,060 --> 04:17:26,480
You can make them follow you and they'll walk back.

5008
04:17:26,860 --> 04:17:27,760
I tried.

5009
04:17:28,300 --> 04:17:29,280
I tried.

5010
04:17:30,520 --> 04:17:31,780
He's not one of us.

5011
04:17:31,780 --> 04:17:32,720
There.

5012
04:17:33,080 --> 04:17:34,140
I'm trying.

5013
04:17:36,300 --> 04:17:37,820
How do I get him in?

5014
04:17:39,700 --> 04:17:40,820
Oh no!

5015
04:17:43,360 --> 04:17:45,280
You can bring this other horse in.

5016
04:17:45,840 --> 04:17:48,400
Let me take the arrows off his ass too.

5017
04:17:48,740 --> 04:17:50,160
He wants to be there actually.

5018
04:17:50,900 --> 04:17:52,040
I'm taking the arrows.

5019
04:17:52,540 --> 04:17:53,300
He wants to be here.

5020
04:17:57,180 --> 04:17:58,840
Don't worry, I can fix it.

5021
04:17:58,840 --> 04:18:01,360
Bring all the horse to the stables!

5022
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:03,600
All horses to the stables!

5023
04:18:10,520 --> 04:18:11,920
What is happening?

5024
04:18:11,920 --> 04:18:14,220
We just received a bunch of new ones.

5025
04:18:14,600 --> 04:18:16,100
Listen, this horse...

5026
04:18:16,820 --> 04:18:18,480
We're gonna have to break the ramps.

5027
04:18:18,520 --> 04:18:20,040
What if they try to...

5028
04:18:20,720 --> 04:18:22,680
Why did they try to steal our horses?

5029
04:18:22,920 --> 04:18:25,020
Can they not break our stables and steal our horses?

5030
04:18:25,300 --> 04:18:27,000
They're going to come back stronger.

5031
04:18:28,180 --> 04:18:30,120
These guys are going to come back for revenge.

5032
04:18:47,120 --> 04:18:48,880
We'll just keep him there.

5033
04:18:49,060 --> 04:18:50,220
I'll fix this.

5034
04:18:50,840 --> 04:18:52,380
We can just keep him there.

5035
04:18:53,160 --> 04:18:54,660
Here you go, I repaired the horse.

5036
04:19:04,340 --> 04:19:09,240
Yeah, but they don't have anything anymore.

5037
04:19:10,860 --> 04:19:12,460
Don't worry, I'll scout out.

5038
04:19:13,400 --> 04:19:17,340
Alright, listen.

5039
04:19:20,740 --> 04:19:24,620
Ladies and sirs, listen.

5040
04:19:25,300 --> 04:19:28,640
Who needs this contraption metal that I have on my hand?

5041
04:19:29,300 --> 04:19:29,820
Who needs it?

5042
04:19:30,440 --> 04:19:31,220
What is that?

5043
04:19:31,940 --> 04:19:34,380
We do not use metal here, dragon.

5044
04:19:35,480 --> 04:19:37,320
We will have to in this war.

5045
04:19:38,300 --> 04:19:42,300
If the devil comes to attack Valhalla, we'll fight him with devil magic.

5046
04:19:43,980 --> 04:19:45,140
No, no, no, sir.

5047
04:19:45,520 --> 04:19:45,820
No.

5048
04:19:46,260 --> 04:19:47,280
Oh my goodness.

5049
04:19:47,840 --> 04:19:49,680
Who needs this contraption in my hand?

5050
04:19:50,240 --> 04:19:51,500
Who wants this for battle?

5051
04:19:53,180 --> 04:19:53,980
Drop it.

5052
04:19:54,020 --> 04:19:55,020
Because I have two of them.

5053
04:19:55,100 --> 04:19:56,140
It is not our way.

5054
04:19:59,580 --> 04:20:00,400
Drop them all.

5055
04:20:03,600 --> 04:20:04,840
This is not our way.

5056
04:20:05,260 --> 04:20:05,760
You know what?

5057
04:20:05,800 --> 04:20:07,880
At least they can't take the horse because it's stuck.

5058
04:20:09,660 --> 04:20:12,300
Didn't Blau said he had an announcement to make at the rock?

5059
04:20:12,380 --> 04:20:13,080
What was it?

5060
04:20:15,240 --> 04:20:17,700
Do you have an arrow in your butt cheek, Elam?

5061
04:20:18,740 --> 04:20:19,420
Stand still.

5062
04:20:19,420 --> 04:20:20,440
Can you take it out?

5063
04:20:20,860 --> 04:20:22,700
I got it.

5064
04:20:32,320 --> 04:20:34,720
I want to know before I go.

5065
04:20:34,880 --> 04:20:36,720
I need to know before I go.

5066
04:20:36,900 --> 04:20:39,740
I literally was like...

5067
04:20:39,740 --> 04:20:40,680
I was like, alright.

5068
04:20:40,760 --> 04:20:42,640
I'm going to wait until this announcement.

5069
04:20:42,800 --> 04:20:43,700
And then I go home.

5070
04:20:43,960 --> 04:20:44,800
And then I rest.

5071
04:20:45,700 --> 04:20:46,260
Can

5072
04:20:49,640 --> 04:20:50,880
you let me in?

5073
04:20:51,280 --> 04:20:51,560
Oh, yeah.

5074
04:20:53,620 --> 04:20:54,180
Please.

5075
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:55,920
Thank you.

5076
04:20:59,380 --> 04:21:03,840
Oh, I think it was...

5077
04:21:03,840 --> 04:21:05,020
Is this metal?

5078
04:21:05,220 --> 04:21:06,700
Oh, I actually took metal here.

5079
04:21:06,960 --> 04:21:08,420
I actually took metal.

5080
04:21:11,420 --> 04:21:12,720
I actually took it, yeah.

5081
04:21:14,720 --> 04:21:16,680
We were harvesting the body.

5082
04:21:16,680 --> 04:21:16,760
Oh, wait.

5083
04:21:17,840 --> 04:21:19,280
There's a stack.

5084
04:21:20,320 --> 04:21:22,680
You missed the stack.

5085
04:21:32,770 --> 04:21:34,410
Oh, yeah.

5086
04:21:34,490 --> 04:21:35,630
I can't.

5087
04:21:39,470 --> 04:21:40,410
I'm sorry.

5088
04:21:40,570 --> 04:21:40,910
Thank you.

5089
04:21:49,650 --> 04:21:51,170
He had more metal.

5090
04:21:51,170 --> 04:21:52,290
Who has the metal?

5091
04:21:53,530 --> 04:21:54,510
We need the metal.

5092
04:21:54,730 --> 04:21:55,170
Please.

5093
04:21:55,270 --> 04:21:56,090
Give it back to him.

5094
04:21:57,110 --> 04:21:58,450
Whoever looted the body.

5095
04:21:58,890 --> 04:22:00,110
Give him the metal back.

5096
04:22:00,770 --> 04:22:02,230
I got an idea, guys.

5097
04:22:02,830 --> 04:22:04,050
I got an idea.

5098
04:22:05,010 --> 04:22:06,350
I got an idea.

5099
04:22:06,610 --> 04:22:09,810
To be fair, I didn't think he'd keep track of how many metals he had.

5100
04:22:25,700 --> 04:22:26,180
Hahaha.

5101
04:22:27,700 --> 04:22:29,580
Now, no one will know it was me.

5102
04:22:33,520 --> 04:22:34,000
Here.

5103
04:22:34,280 --> 04:22:35,220
You can take this one.

5104
04:22:36,240 --> 04:22:36,460
Come here.

5105
04:22:38,220 --> 04:22:39,140
Take this one.

5106
04:22:43,880 --> 04:22:45,220
But they can ride.

5107
04:22:56,960 --> 04:22:57,360
Hahaha.

5108
04:22:59,840 --> 04:23:00,320
Wait, guys.

5109
04:23:00,380 --> 04:23:01,780
How do we unstick this horse?

5110
04:23:02,020 --> 04:23:02,800
We can't.

5111
04:23:02,800 --> 04:23:04,140
We have to break the ramp.

5112
04:23:04,600 --> 04:23:05,420
We need to break the ramp.

5113
04:23:06,040 --> 04:23:07,400
Yeah, we got to get rid of the ramp.

5114
04:23:09,000 --> 04:23:10,420
Yeah, we can't even get rid of the ramp.

5115
04:23:12,440 --> 04:23:13,200
Too late.

5116
04:23:13,940 --> 04:23:14,800
Yeah, it's real.

5117
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:17,560
Well, we'll give him a different horse.

5118
04:23:17,760 --> 04:23:19,400
And then Stable Master Demo can...

5119
04:23:20,120 --> 04:23:20,520
Hahaha.

5120
04:23:23,040 --> 04:23:24,600
Yeah, let's get the horses out.

5121
04:23:24,600 --> 04:23:25,340
Get them out.

5122
04:23:25,460 --> 04:23:27,680
Get the horses out.

5123
04:23:31,220 --> 04:23:32,260
Let's go, Lito.

5124
04:23:34,500 --> 04:23:35,060
So...

5125
04:23:35,060 --> 04:23:35,640
Alright.

5126
04:23:37,080 --> 04:23:38,600
Why did we give them back a horse?

5127
04:23:40,180 --> 04:23:40,740
Hahaha.

5128
04:23:40,740 --> 04:23:40,980
Hahaha.

5129
04:23:54,440 --> 04:23:55,940
They did it.

5130
04:23:56,000 --> 04:23:57,160
They left without the medal.

5131
04:23:57,800 --> 04:23:59,800
They left without the medal.

5132
04:24:00,260 --> 04:24:03,000
See, they didn't care about the medal.

5133
04:24:06,500 --> 04:24:08,520
I gotta keep my medal.

5134
04:24:08,520 --> 04:24:08,860
Hahaha.

5135
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:15,180
Wait.

5136
04:24:15,560 --> 04:24:16,800
What did H-June said?

5137
04:24:18,520 --> 04:24:20,280
I thought we were their allies.

5138
04:24:34,020 --> 04:24:35,860
Who killed the horse?

5139
04:24:38,520 --> 04:24:39,220
It was for the gods.

5140
04:24:39,420 --> 04:24:41,480
It has been fixed.

5141
04:24:43,100 --> 04:24:44,660
Who took my chimpkin?

5142
04:24:45,020 --> 04:24:45,440
Who did it?

5143
04:24:46,360 --> 04:24:47,860
Who took my chimpkin?

5144
04:24:48,420 --> 04:24:49,220
Guess what?

5145
04:24:50,320 --> 04:24:50,960
Your what?

5146
04:24:51,940 --> 04:24:53,180
I have no chimpkin.

5147
04:24:53,260 --> 04:24:56,120
Liza, you took Kevin...

5148
04:24:56,120 --> 04:24:58,360
I did not, I did not, I did not.

5149
04:24:58,720 --> 04:25:00,160
Give him a bag right now.

5150
04:25:00,660 --> 04:25:01,960
Give Kevin a bag.

5151
04:25:02,940 --> 04:25:05,500
I have no idea what you're talking about.

5152
04:25:05,780 --> 04:25:07,420
I've never heard of a...

5153
04:25:07,420 --> 04:25:10,660
Alright, I gotta go now.

5154
04:25:10,940 --> 04:25:11,860
I gotta rest.

5155
04:25:12,360 --> 04:25:13,420
I have another...

5156
04:25:14,000 --> 04:25:15,620
I have to go.

5157
04:25:15,700 --> 04:25:17,240
I have to go.

5158
04:25:17,340 --> 04:25:18,520
I have another stream.

5159
04:25:19,940 --> 04:25:22,540
I shall go rest for another day.

5160
04:25:22,740 --> 04:25:24,020
I'll see you all later.

5161
04:25:25,080 --> 04:25:27,300
I shall rest and dream of another life.

5162
04:25:29,840 --> 04:25:33,120
I shall dream another life when I hit the bed.

5163
04:25:36,220 --> 04:25:37,000
Where's my bed?

5164
04:25:38,240 --> 04:25:39,560
Where's my bed?

5165
04:25:40,500 --> 04:25:40,600
Yeah?

5166
04:25:42,860 --> 04:25:46,360
I have Silent Hill in 30 minutes.

5167
04:25:49,620 --> 04:25:50,400
Yes?

5168
04:25:55,140 --> 04:25:56,700
Thank you.

5169
04:25:56,820 --> 04:25:58,220
Thank you, Sir Blau.

5170
04:25:58,220 --> 04:25:59,440
I shall dream.

5171
04:25:59,440 --> 04:26:03,480
I shall dream of a city that never sleeps.

5172
04:26:06,720 --> 04:26:07,440
Yes.

5173
04:26:08,940 --> 04:26:11,080
It's like a picture that's forever.

5174
04:26:25,320 --> 04:26:31,640
I shall see you all the next day and dream of many things in another world.

5175
04:26:33,180 --> 04:26:35,240
Good night, everybody.

5176
04:26:35,620 --> 04:26:36,200
Good night.

5177
04:26:41,340 --> 04:26:42,940
Thank you.

5178
04:26:46,180 --> 04:26:46,980
Bye.

5179
04:26:51,280 --> 04:26:52,860
What do you mean?

5180
04:26:53,580 --> 04:26:54,840
What do you mean?

5181
04:26:54,840 --> 04:26:56,180
It's a...

5182
04:26:56,180 --> 04:26:57,320
It's PDA.

5183
04:26:57,760 --> 04:27:00,060
You know me and PDA.

5184
04:27:00,320 --> 04:27:01,680
You know me and PDA.

5185
04:27:02,140 --> 04:27:03,020
People are watching.

5186
04:27:04,500 --> 04:27:06,220
Alright, bye-bye.

5187
04:27:11,960 --> 04:27:13,700
That was fun.

5188
04:27:14,140 --> 04:27:15,320
I had a lot of fun.

5189
04:27:19,380 --> 04:27:21,180
That was really fun.

5190
04:27:21,180 --> 04:27:23,320
I hope all you guys were able to get drops while playing.

5191
04:27:23,580 --> 04:27:24,380
I'll try to do more.

5192
04:27:24,460 --> 04:27:30,260
I'll try to do some gorilla rush streams while we're here since I do have drops.

5193
04:27:31,620 --> 04:27:32,520
So, we'll see.

5194
04:27:32,600 --> 04:27:35,480
We'll see whenever I do have time so people can get my drop.

5195
04:27:35,820 --> 04:27:37,300
Anyway, guys, thank you all for coming.

5196
04:27:37,460 --> 04:27:40,440
I do have Silent Hill 2 in 30 minutes on YouTube.

5197
04:27:40,840 --> 04:27:42,920
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

5198
04:27:43,240 --> 04:27:46,760
I usually stream on the YouTube so you can check me out there.

5199
04:27:47,000 --> 04:27:50,600
I usually tweet out whenever I'm live on Twitch and whenever I'm doing gorilla streams on Twitch.

5200
04:27:50,920 --> 04:27:51,960
So, you can check me out.

5201
04:27:52,560 --> 04:27:57,620
You should follow me on Twitter to find out when I'm live especially if it's a gorilla stream for Rust.

5202
04:27:58,640 --> 04:27:59,700
Also, I have merch!

5203
04:27:59,920 --> 04:28:00,400
I have merch!

5204
04:28:00,500 --> 04:28:04,560
If you guys didn't know, I have my very own PC case from Hyatt as well as keycaps.

5205
04:28:05,060 --> 04:28:06,680
Apparently, the shipping...

5206
04:28:06,680 --> 04:28:08,000
Have you pre-ordered them before?

5207
04:28:08,460 --> 04:28:09,500
You already pre-ordered it?

5208
04:28:09,580 --> 04:28:13,760
You should be receiving them now or this upcoming week or next week.

5209
04:28:14,780 --> 04:28:17,140
I hope you guys got your gun.

5210
04:28:17,140 --> 04:28:19,460
I hope you guys got the gun if you have.

5211
04:28:19,820 --> 04:28:20,940
I hope you guys got it.

5212
04:28:21,300 --> 04:28:23,000
But yes, check out my merch.

5213
04:28:23,120 --> 04:28:25,060
I have a gamer subs code as well.

5214
04:28:25,620 --> 04:28:28,760
Subscribe to me on YouTube because that's where I usually stream.

5215
04:28:29,140 --> 04:28:31,520
Hey guys, I am gonna...

5216
04:28:31,520 --> 04:28:32,720
Yes, you can still order it.

5217
04:28:32,780 --> 04:28:34,440
You can still order the PC.

5218
04:28:34,980 --> 04:28:37,380
I don't know what... I think it's like exclamation point Hyatt.

5219
04:28:37,660 --> 04:28:38,520
Also, I have a concert!

5220
04:28:38,840 --> 04:28:40,180
I have a concert coming up!

5221
04:28:40,980 --> 04:28:42,440
It's our next surprise guest.

5222
04:28:42,520 --> 04:28:44,680
We do have one more final surprise guest.

5223
04:28:45,420 --> 04:28:46,360
So, yeah!

5224
04:28:46,920 --> 04:28:48,160
Check all those out!

5225
04:28:48,380 --> 04:28:49,440
Everything all there.

5226
04:28:49,980 --> 04:28:51,980
As always, everybody, say hi, join the posh check.

5227
04:28:52,080 --> 04:28:53,360
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5228
04:28:53,480 --> 04:28:55,980
If you stay up for me, head to bed or watch Silent Hill 2.

5229
04:28:56,260 --> 04:28:57,640
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5230
04:28:57,940 --> 04:28:58,600
Bye, guys!

5231
04:28:59,200 --> 04:28:59,600
Bye!
