1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Alright, alright, alright.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,960
Uh, take up the whole screen- okay.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,180
Okay, like this, right?

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,220
Uh, there you go.

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:05,640
Perfect.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,680
That's perfect, right?

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, yeah, this is very, very spooky, baby.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,620
I'm scared.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
There you go, perfect.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
I can fix it up!

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,580
Oh!

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,000
Look at that!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,620
Push, pull, push, pull!

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,920
Okay, maybe I need to get my cat out of the way.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,060
Can I jump off?

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,700
Oh, oh, wait, you can.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,340
You can.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,200
Oh, you can.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,680
I thought that would be an invisible wall.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,360
Wow.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,760
I thought that would be an invisible wall.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:00:59,980
Wow.

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,700
Can I become a shoe?

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,860
I can become a shoe!

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,640
Can I become a shoe?

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,180
What

27
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,130
the fuck?

28
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,250
There's a fall damage here!

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,170
There's a fall damage!

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,210
Why the fuck is there fall damage?

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,090
Oh!

32
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,430
It was at this moment that he knew.

33
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,830
He fucked up.

34
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,270
Wait!

35
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:36,690
Stop!

36
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,450
Nice run.

37
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,150
Oh wait, you can sprint!

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,150
Why did no one tell me to sprint here?

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,110
I've been fucking walking this entire time.

40
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,970
You can sprint in this game.

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,610
Why is it here so tiny?

42
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,710
Look around by using, wow, by using arrow keys.

43
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,370
Oh shit.

44
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,670
I was like, oh shit.

45
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,110
Don't check under the bed.

46
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,350
Don't check under the bed.

47
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,490
Don't check under the bed.

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,550
Don't drink other pain!

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,560
Crying!

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,780
Yeah, little bitch.

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,960
Yeah, you little bitch.

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
I thought that hit me.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,200
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,560
No!

55
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,300
No!

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,680
I'm not spooked at all.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,140
This is

58
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,660
ridiculous.

59
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,380
You're so smart!

60
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,320
Holy shit!

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,160
Look at...
