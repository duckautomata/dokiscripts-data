Let's go.

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,170
Oh, today was a very long day today.

12
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,130
We're so close to 700k!

13
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,350
I don't know if we're getting it at the end of the stream,
but I just thought it'd be nice to have it there.

14
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:31,150
you know it'll just be nice to have the counter there nice
yeah but what a long exhausting day we had today we yeah we

15
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:40,730
we sort of we sort of low key overdid it today in terms of
streaming I don't know what it is about Overwatch something

16
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:48,730
about Overwatch just makes me go like crazy oh Yeah, I
didn't realize you guys know like the alpha test for Marvel

17
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:57,490
rivals For for Marvel rivals is actually like Um, it's it
it's coming out next week.

18
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,150
I think I think it's next week right.

19
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,650
Yeah, it's coming on Friday the alpha test I actually didn't
realize that That's crazy.

20
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,630
I noticed I just saw I saw like because I was like I made
the joke about like oh This is gonna be like Marvel rivals

21
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,930
waiting room by the way fucking shitty name

22
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,610
It's a really bad name.

23
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,590
I'll admit.

24
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,830
Marvel Rivals.

25
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,110
It just doesn't...

26
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,990
I think it's because, like, it just doesn't roll off the
tongue very well.

27
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,870
Marvel Rivals.

28
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,490
It feels like a tongue twister, you know?

29
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,270
Marvel Rivals, Marvel Rivals.

30
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,350
It just feels like...

31
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,070
It feels like a fucking tongue twister.

32
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,690
Not like, you know, Apex Legends, Overwatch, Fortnite.

33
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,350
Like, these are things that roll off your tongue very
easily.

34
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:55,910
a terrible name for for it's such a terrible name for for a

there was a reaper one trick on the enemy team and he was

46
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:33,570

teammates called him out and was like because like the the

47
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:40,930
mercy player on the enemy team was like this was off stream
the mercy play on the enemy team was like report our reaper

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:49,770
he's trolling and then the reaper was like no report our
mercy she's like pistiling from spawn and one of our one of

in chat once but twice because usually it would be censored

63
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:58,000
in asterix but this guy knew exactly how to type it so that
it would show up and we could see exactly what that word was

77
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,520
Overwatch streams?

78
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,080
I noticed, like, am I too big on the screen, guys?

79
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,340
Do you think I should be smaller?

80
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
I was worried that I'd cover up too much of the gameplay.

81
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,580
So if I ever do another Overwatch stream, Zeku, thank you
for the 50 gifted chips.

82
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,720
Thank you, thank you.

83
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,900
I like big, dokey.

84
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,380
No, bigger.

85
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

86
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,840
Hmm.

87
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,640
Full body left side.

88
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,220
You won't be able to see the HP on the left side.

89
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,760
Yeah, that head is huge.

90
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,500
That's where my brain goes.

91
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
Yeah, I'll make it a little.

92
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,220
I'll make it a little bit smaller.

93
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,580
I don't know if I do ever do an Overwatch stream.

94
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,280
Again, maybe I'll just do like a stream or just play and
just get top 500.

95
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,060
And that's it.

96
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,740
I don't have no plans on ending top 500.

97
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,000
Because the reward system for Overwatch.

98
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,000
For Overwatch.

99
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,620
It's just not, it's just not, like, something I care.

100
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,960
The rankings were really fun.

101
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,620
Don't get lost.

102
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,240
Thank you, guys, for the Magenta Supa.

103
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,420
Thank you, thank you.

104
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,900
Yeah, I just played to have fun.

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,100
I don't really care about rank anymore.

106
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,020
I just think, like, I just think, like, the reward.

107
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,220
If the rewards were worth it, I'd definitely play more.

108
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,840
But the rewards was 100% not worth it at all.

109
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,120
It was just, it just was like, it's not.

110
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,740
It's like it's like some fucking What was it?

111
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,260
It was it's like the tagline that lasts for one season Like
I don't care.

112
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:30,380
I don't care about that I don't care about if it was forever
like the icon is praised Then I care a little bit more But

113
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,120
the fact that it's just like a tagline that only lasts for
one season is just not worth it Not so Deadpool.

114
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Thank you for the super chat.

115
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,140
Thank you.

116
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,740
Thank you.

117
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,700
I want Doki so big We can see the tomato inside.

118
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Thank you for the super chat.

119
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,280
Thank you.

120
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:57,180
Thank you let's see um one yeah it's only the tagline so
when you get top 500 in Overwatch 2 uh you get like this

121
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:06,120
tagline that just says top 500 challenger or something that
like shows people that you ended in top 500 but it you lose

122
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,760
it after one season so they go away and that's it that's it
I was like I don't care I don't care if it goes away like

123
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:19,540
what's the what the fuck's the point you know um so like i
don't mind just touching top 500 on stream because usually

124
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:26,040
in the past i never stream my rank sessions because when i
get like super serious or like barely when i get super

125
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:35,720
serious in rank i don't stream my rank sessions because i
cannot like you know i i talk to you guys and play at the

126
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,680
same time so you know damn well i am not focused at all when
am i playing on

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,540
but um when i play off stream i play off stream of course
i'm like super focused and i actually like pay attention to

128
00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:00,760
my surroundings and everything and he plans on more apex
algs got me i haven't watched algs uh this season i honestly

129
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,300
i think if i asked for like drops on my twitch account they
would give me to me but like i i honestly like i usually

130
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:15,660
watch during uh i i watch for like the finals like the
finals finalists this is like what is it called it's uh

131
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:27,020
split one so i'm not like as like um also i haven't done a
watch along of it so uh and like i'm honestly like uh i'm

132
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:36,200
just waiting for i'm just waiting for like the new update
because for the new uh legend and everything um only thing

133
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,680
in dokey's head is a white Yeah, no thought head empty.

134
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,580
I came here.

135
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,340
Thank you for the super chat.

136
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you, thank you.

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,080
So if you're a tomato and thief, doesn't that make you a
kleptomato?

138
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
Grats on Masters, thank you.

139
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Thank you for the super chat.

140
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,600
Thank you.

141
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:51,880
Thank you.

142
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,880
I really appreciate it.

143
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,240
Thank you so much.

144
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,120
Splatoon 3.

145
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,980
No, Splatoon has made me the most toxic person ever.

146
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,220
Because in Splatoon, in Splatoon, you can't talk to anybody.

147
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,420
So you can't verbalize your hatred for your teammates.

148
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:21,100
so Splatoon has been like the game that made me like the
most toxic I can ever be in rank because and it's also like

149
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:30,700
really tilting because it's on Nintendo it's on Nintendo
servers and Nintendo is not great with you know with latency

150
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:40,340
and stuff and because of that like connections are fucking
terrible as well and like so when DCs it's just loseable and

151
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:47,620
you don't even get like rank protection or anything and I I
just fucking hate Nintendo servers like I just don't

152
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,360
understand why why the latency can be so bad I don't
understand like you have so much money what do you do with

153
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:01,040
your money like thank you for the magenta soup thank you
thank you I was watching your Overwatch stream on my for my

154
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,860
TV at work today something I got stuck doing paperwork so
you can cover as much of the

155
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,300
Thank you.

156
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
I was very toxic.

157
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,560
I would actually, like, slam, slam things if I lose.

158
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,160
And, like, I would, oh, my God.

159
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,840
I was, it was so bad.

160
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,340
It was so bad for Splatoon.

161
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,400
And the player base for, like, Splatoon is also, like, not
that high.

162
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,300
Like, you would think, like, Overwatch player base is pretty
bad.

163
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,040
But Splatoon player base is absolutely terrible.

164
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,620
His majority of the players are in Japan.

165
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,240
The NA players aren't like Yeah

166
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:56,260
Never It's all in Asia So like the connection is like Even
more terrible But like they'll never Nintendo It's just too

167
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:10,080
big to fail I don't know why we always Go back to Nintendo
But It doesn't matter what they do The moment they release

168
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,260
something remotely, nostalgia bait, people just forget
everything.

169
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:26,860
If Nintendo one day does something so terrible that, like,
people actually start boycotting, all they have to do is

170
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,640
just release the new Smash Bros.

171
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,760
or a new Zelda game.

172
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,340
That's really it.

173
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,620
Well, it's Nintendo.

174
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
They don't need to do anything.

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:56,080
everything is freaking i okay someone says everything is
forgiving by the next direct i i'm so sad i miss e3 i miss i

176
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:04,720
miss e3 e3 was so fucking hyped i love all the i love i wish
we could just why i wish i i wish e3 was still going on so

177
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,900
we can do like watchalongs of e3 i miss Those were so
fucking hyped.

178
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,700
And even if like, some of them were like, yeah, but the
recent shows were so cringe.

179
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,260
That's the best part when it's cringe and you can make fun
of it.

180
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,000
Like Summer Game Fest, it's not the same.

181
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,740
It's not the same.

182
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,380
Even the booths were so good too.

183
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,940
The booths on E3 presentations were so good as well.

184
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,900
It's just not the same.

185
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:46,740
cringe was amazing exactly even with the but then they were
like what about the gamer awards the gamer words oh my god

186
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:56,840
bro the gamer awards is not it's just it's just not it's
just trailers it's just game trailers there's no like

187
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,480
performances or anything other than the music performances
and stuff not every game company is doing their own fucking

188
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:13,500
direct because nintendo did it first I'm gonna say the
Nintendo direct is so boring

189
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:28,020
it's not it's not hype anymore it's so boring it's remember
when like wait it was a robot chicken oh my god remember

190
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:39,360
when like Nintendo did the robot chicken thing was that e3
or was that like a different one that what shit was so funny

191
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:53,420
it was so good too and and now like it directs your soul
yeah e3 2013 bro for those who never didn't realize um e3

192
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:03,660
did uh like nintendo back when nintendo still participated
in e3 uh they did like a robot chicken parody i felt like

193
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:10,720
honestly not gonna lie i feel like nintendo was much more
chill back then compared to now I think compared to now

194
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:19,800
they're definitely more harsh and strict with things oh yeah
the Muppets too the Muppets one they're really good at they

195
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:29,900
were so good at publicity back then um I don't know what
happened I feel like now they're like much more strict red

196
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:40,460
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you not just
reggie but like other stuff too salute i mean it makes sense

197
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:52,600
because the guy is run it's run by the nintendo america is
run by the guy named bowser right yeah yuata son too i feel

198
00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:03,620
like they were much more chill back then compared to now um
i'm trying to like remember like Yeah, I don't, I'm not like

199
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:13,480
a huge fan of, I'm not a huge fan of like game companies
doing, of game companies doing like, uh, presentation, like

200
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,300
their own presentations because it feels less hype and
boring.

201
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm not hype about game releases these days, especially like
when like everybody just like leaks what they're going to

202
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,760
release and stuff.

203
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:33,660
and usually like like you don't because everything gets
leaked now that like you don't get hyped over a game release

204
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:41,300
when it just shows up out of nowhere you know like world
premieres and stuff like when like you like it's just not

205
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:47,880
nothing was ever said about the certain game and it's
something you find out on e3 alone and everyone's like wow

206
00:20:51,930 --> 00:21:04,790
now now now you know everything that's gonna uh nicola think
of a super chat thank you thank you uh came here i think you

207
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:12,030
was super chat thank you thank you nothing will ever top
giant enemy crap my body is ready and ridge racer i think it

208
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:21,030
was super chat thank you thank you um times were simpler
yeah everything was so much more simpler back then now i

209
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:28,190
feel like now games are game releases are not as hyped
anymore i don't know i mean we do have like a lot of indie

210
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:36,910
games and stuff um Indie games are now more popular than
like AAA games and everything because like they get to make

211
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:44,410
whatever they want to make and they're not governed by the
corporate executive board that was like, no, you should

212
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,670
change that and this.

213
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:53,970
So a lot of indie game devs are just doing whatever the fuck
they want and not having to worry about trying to fit into

214
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,210
whatever the exec wants.

215
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,830
Indie games don't really make multiplayer FPS games

216
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:23,710
Where are the developers making games for me For me I don't
wanna wanna play single player games I wanna play

217
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:37,110
multiplayer FPS games that I can solo queue so I don't have
to look for collab partners right thank you for the super

218
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:44,490
chat thank you thank you it's just all we have is just apex
and overwatch

219
00:22:50,710 --> 00:23:02,450
I was like I was gonna say oh yeah do you guys hear about
hell divers too fucking rest in peace that game died it's

220
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:13,410
too late they can't do anything to save they can't they
can't do anything to to save the game now lucky for them

221
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:24,530
lucky for them EDF is coming out too so yeah it's already
over the moment oh what happened basically they made you

222
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:35,170
required to have a PlayStation account to link your
PlayStation account to Hell Divers 2 even though it's on

223
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,610
Steam.

224
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,810
People don't like that because there's extra steps.

225
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,950
Wait, Steam is actually getting refunds to people?

226
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,530
Oh, thank God, Valve.

227
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,130
Thank God, Gabe.

228
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:55,570
Gabe always knows what's... Gabe has to have like the
fucking best like publicity PR team in the fucking world,

229
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,230
because he's a true gamer.

230
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:05,050
Gabe is a real fucking gamer, and I'll be so sad if Valve
ever goes, gets on the stock market, and gets an executive

231
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,170
board, because that's when everything will go downhill.

232
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,470
Deadfoot, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank
you.

233
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,910
Don't shoot my baby like this.

234
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,090
They can still walk it back.

235
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,530
Oh, somebody's coping.

236
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:29,970
Look at that poor fool coping that they can return from this
you know okay gamers do forget but like the thing about

237
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:37,510
gamers is that you have to have a big enough reputation you
have to have something that would make gamers want to come

238
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:44,430
back to you but like i'm gonna say hell damage too i don't
like you gotta be like big enough like nintendo to be able

239
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:58,610
to recover from this like and and hell damage too does not
Does not have that reputation, unfortunately.

240
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,230
I don't think Helldivish 2 is...

241
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:19,630
The thing is, the thing is, the only way, the only way I
see, like, Helldivish 2 coming back from this is, is if, um,

242
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,030
is if Sony makes an apology.

243
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,510
And I don't think Sony is going to make an apology.

244
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,990
Call me.

245
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,370
Thank you for the super chat.

246
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:30,890
Thank you.

247
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,690
Thank you.

248
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,530
Truly the best PR strategy.

249
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,110
Do nothing and watch other companies make mistakes.

250
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,830
Thank you for the super chat.

251
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:38,390
Thank you.

252
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,410
Thank you.

253
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,990
I don't think they're gonna apologize.

254
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,410
Let's see, Razi, thank you for the super chat.

255

Thank you.

257
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,330
Um, I think it's a way a lot because they actually have
redeeming features.

258
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,570
Someone didn't look at the news recently.

259
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,870
I still love Nintendo, though.

260
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,370
Like, it's, it's a, because I still I'm just a consumer.

261
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:32,050
I'm just a consumer that's stuck in the that's stuck because
the properties they own are just too good to leave

262
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:47,050
um uh yeah i do miss like miss e3 i think it's just like i
think like watching doing watchalongs of like uh like you

263
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:54,450
know like game announcements and game news just isn't the
same just isn't the same the memes are not as good too I

264
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:03,650
think it's the memes the memes that come out of game
announcement are just not good They're just so boring that

265
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:12,830
people can't make memes out of it The only memes we got out
of like game announcements were Were the fucking um, what

266
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,430
was it?

267
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,310
Um, the one with a kid fucking Uh, what's the word?

268
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:25,890
The kid just showed a random kid just showed out of nowhere
just And I see crashes, the game awards.

269
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,850
That was, like, the only meme that came out of the game
awards.

270
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,790

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,340
For Dragon Ball Z?

307
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,240
Because that's basically the majority of Dragon Ball Z
games.

308
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,320
Oh, it is.

309
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,700
Okay.

310
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,760
Okay.

311
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,940
I almost hit.

312
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,720
I wish...

313
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,760
I said it before.

314
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:33,580
in the sandland playthrough but i wish i really do wish they
make other types of adaptations of anime games that's not

315
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:43,240
just fighting games there's so much lore to it you know why
you know why it's because they need to get this shit out

316
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,580
fast before like animate the anime series dies like that's
the thing they're so scared it's the easiest yeah it's one

317
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,880
of the easiest you're so scared that the hype is gonna die
out um that hype is gonna die out that they always make like

318
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,540
fucking fighting i'm not talking about dragon ball z because
it makes sense dragon ball z uh fighting games makes sense

319
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:13,540
but there's like games that just doesn't fucking make sense
it just it just doesn't make sense and it's then they're

320
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:25,980
like sometimes they're fucking terrible too i don't i don't
i get And it's like, it's because it's easy to make and it's

321
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,400
like, it's cheaper.

322
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,040
And it's also like, you don't want to get in on the hype
before it's over.

323
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,480
And, uh, and like there's so many, it's crazy.

324
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:46,860
The thing I hate about like how anime series, anime series
goes is that they're so scared about losing hype that like

325
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,980
some of the anime shows don't even have time to like sink
in.

326
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,960
for people that by the next season like the next like it was
like oh winter spring fall summer rose out like it's

327
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,800
forgetting like people forget about it there's so many
animas that are releasing almost every season that like it's

328
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:18,040
so hard for any show to even like build an audience and i
hate it like every season like 40 plus animas get released

329
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:30,160
it's so competitive it's all hype based yeah the moment the
season of it ends people forget about it it's over like like

330
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:38,280
i hate it because it doesn't even build up the the fan base
of like it doesn't build up the fan base of people yeah the

331
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,760
market saturations and stuff like that there's so many types
of animas like that unless you're probably like the big

you um I just think like uh I just feel like I feel like I

342
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:04,500
feel like people really should slow down with the anime
releases like just space them out more because there's

343
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:11,440
apparently I like I don't watch a lot of anime um because I
don't have time to read subtitles while uh I don't have time

344
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,700
to read subtitles while playing um while doing work or
playing something so I don't watch a lot of anime but I've

345
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:26,380
always heard how how like people would be like oh man this
anime show was so underrated and people already forgot about

346
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:34,080
it and someone was like bro when that was this ad when X
insert X anime got released um it was like that one of the

347
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:41,820
most hype anime is out there but people already forgot about
it because there's so many anime is that's being released

348
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:50,960
almost every season that like um even really good ones get
like like forgotten and stuff like i feel like a lot of

349
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,360
people already forgot about what was it the the one with all
the animals as like students students or something god

350
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,720
what's that anime called i already forgot

351
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,800
remember when like um i got reincarnated as a slime that
shit was like one of the biggest show anime yeah beast stars

352
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,900
i feel like beast stars is already people already forgot
about beast stars but when that anime came out so many

353
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:26,800
people were like so hyped about it and like like talked
about it all everywhere and then like it died out and then

354
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,980
there was what was it and then there was that fucking other
anime we've reincarnated as a slime no one really talks

355
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:40,400
about that anymore slime is literally airing right now yeah
but no one talks about it like the time when it first came

356
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:50,320
out and there was that other one with the spider remember
that's little that reincarnated as a spider that one no one

357
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:59,640
talks about it anymore because after the first season unless
you're like big big

358
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,080
so it's like i did not even know there was a new season

359
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:19,120
and then but we don't talk about one punch man one punch man
like fucking like shot itself in the foot like that's on

360
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:30,080
them and then did you guys know i don't even know if it came
up blue exorcist oh my god all i'm saying that when blue

361
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:40,560
exorcist first came up that was not gonna lie i feel like
blue exorcist was like one of the fujo bait animas out there

362
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:50,720
like every bro everybody loved that shit like i remember

363
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:06,780
and that was the show and then when it ended nobody cared
that was and now everybody nobody cared after after it ended

364
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:15,920
and stuff and and then apparently apparently it's getting a
new season it's getting isn't it getting it's getting a new

365
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:31,320
season right or did it aired or did it did it already aired
did it already aired like yeah they made it i saw making up

366
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:41,180
fake shows yeah no it is airing nobody cares now no one
talks about blue exorcist even though like it was one of the

367
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:51,500
fucking shows of of like um the show of the season and now
it has a new season it got a revival and people were like we

368
00:37:51,500 --> 00:38:01,900
are like oh my god nobody cares oh yeah and then there's
free holy no if i say blue exorcist was fujo bait fucking

369
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:11,980
free was fujo bait as hell because like at least yuri on ice
like it's implied that they got together free they're just

370
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,840
all really really good friends like

371
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,960
Like, Yuri and I, at least it's implied, but free was just,
we're just homies.

372
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,160
But, like, people can dream.

373
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,160
Yeah, friends.

374
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,940
They were dating in my heart.

375
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,020
They're just best buds.

376
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,640
Free is, and they were roommates.

377
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,700
The anime.

378
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,740
They're just really, really good friends and roommates.

379
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,420
I don't know what you're implying.

380
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:58,360
and get married in yuri on ice yeah and apparently they oh
my gosh i don't know if you guys heard about the controversy

381
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:06,680
of uh yuri on ice but like they recently canceled the movie
like officially canceled the movie and like some fucking i

382
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:15,600
saw like people were like you know reacting very negatively
about it because like yuri on ice is like um is like was has

383
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:22,940
a very like deep now it's like has a cult following at that
point because it's been like forever since they made new

384
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:28,340
content for it and like apparently like remember i was
reading on twitter because it was trending on twitter and

385
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:38,220
people were saying like people were like oh um there's some
behind the scenes shenanigans i saw why yuri on ice was

386
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:50,360
cancelled and i was like what the fuck is going on people
were like the director of some behind the scenes shenanigans

387
00:39:50,360 --> 00:40:06,280
as to why we never got Yuri on ice the movie the
conspiracies yeah the conspiracies um um there were black

388
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,140
butter air oh yeah they fucking remade black butter or the
new season I don't know Can you think of the super chat?

389
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,720
Thinking they ain't care.

390
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
No one cares.

391
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,440
It's actually crazy.

392
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,720
And no one really, like, talked about the Black Butler shit
too.

393
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,760
There's just so many things that, like, like, like, there's
so many animas and stuff that comes out.

394
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,200
Wait, Beastars was the anime?

395
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,060
I thought it was an empty shark.

396
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,100
I'll think of the super chat.

397
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,400
Thank you.

398
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,040
Thank you.

399
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,480
Yeah, they did.

400
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,280
They aired a, they aired a new anime for Black Butler.

401
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:40,940
Um...

402
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,140
But people just glossed over it.

403
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,280
It's just, every season, only one or two animas are like the
biggest things ever.

404
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,300
And if you're not, and they fit the two anime, like the
biggest seat for like, oh, like summer anime.

405
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,220
The summer anime is insert anime here.

406
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,920
And there can only be two, I feel like.

407
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,300
I feel like there can only be two.

408
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,960
And then even though there's like other animas that might be
really, really fucking good.

409
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,720
of two then it's over

410
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,600
it's people don't care

411
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,940
it's just it's just forgotten it could be like really really
fucking good too but it doesn't matter they already met

412
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,420
their quota of two good atomies oh

413
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:49,340
there's only a yeah there's only a limited amount of
attention that goes around and oh my gosh i tried i tried to

414
00:41:49,340 --> 00:42:02,480
watch oshinoko i couldn't i watched like two episodes and i
got depressed because i was like this is too real i couldn't

415
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,100
keep watching i had so sad

416
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,700
Oh yeah, they did a reboot of Shaman King too They did a
reboot of Shaman.

417
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,880
There's so many fucking reboots.

418
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,620
Oh my gosh, I hate it.

419
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,460
Anime is nostalgia baiting now.

420
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,480
It's nostalgia baiting.

421
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,040
I thought we could get away.

422
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,200
It was nostalgia bait.

423
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,680
Express, thank you for the super chat.

424
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,460

427
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,920

troopers but i want to be a sift lord because at least sift

428
00:42:51,920 --> 00:43:00,780

star wars game you guys were like uh uh when if you are a

429
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:07,120
jedi you have to be pure and then when you guys told me like
pure i didn't i i was like oh okay that makes sense because

430
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:15,920
yeah i'd be like you know a good person and you guys like no
you can't even have a family i was like oh my god and it

431
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:31,520

like yeah they can't not even like a little they can't even

432
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:41,280
feel love it's crazy they're actual wizards they can't even
feel love i was like Holy shit, bro.

433
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,820
It literally, like, not my Christian-friendly channel.

434
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,320
Except for that one guy who's, like, whose race that needed
to be repopulated.

435
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,160
So they gave him the one exception.

436
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,260
And even then, he has to, like, not love his family.

437
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,720
Which is so fucked up to think about.

438
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,780
Like, voluntarily sell a bit.

439
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,760
Yeah, you can't have any attachment.

440
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,040
Why the fuck would you be a Jedi?

441
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,160
Simplers are cooler.

442
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:16,440
this voice sounds so much cooler because of that uh fate
thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you i mean they

443
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,440
can continue the bloodline jedi's can't i hope spice and
wolf does the opposite since no one cared when they

444
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,240
originally aired and then people love this so maybe the
remake people will care from the start maybe i'm just gonna

445
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:46,100
sit and cope now thank you for the akasupa thank you thank
you but they're evil joki so but they're rich though and

446
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,960
they can bang

447
00:44:53,020 --> 00:45:09,340
how can they continue the bloodline how can they get the
ladies they get the ladies um yeah if evil while hard

448
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,020
exactly.

449
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,660
I just think, but yeah, that's my rant about anime.

450
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,240
Even though I don't watch a lot of anime in general, I just
think it's dumb that a lot of really, really well-animated

451
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,440
anime shows are forgotten because there's always, there's
just too many being released and there's always a quota.

452
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,340
It's like, if there's more than two good animas being
released, the third plus, third, four, fifth, sixth good

453
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,900
anime will not be noticed because people don't care enough.

for like shows because our because like we forget about them

00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:32,800
after it's over like I think like binging shows is such a
bad concept because uh uh because like you know you consume

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:40,320
everything in one go that there's no hype going yeah it
kills the hype i honestly think it kills um it kills the

460
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:48,900
hype instantly for like shows and i really hate that culture
in general now because like some really really good shows

461
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:58,520
get forgotten so easily that's so hard to build any fan base
in general um if it's like really good um and i think that's

462

like one of the worst things right now with the binging con
culture uh by size thank you for the super chat thank you

fortnight creator and like they can literally oh when

474
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,920
fortnight was like when they were like at the peak of
fortnight content creation like as a fortnight streamer they

475
00:48:46,920 --> 00:49:07,080
literally made like i think like $500,000 per month of the
fortnight creator code at its peak i was like half a million

476
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:15,560
a fortnite creator code back when fortnite was at its
fucking peak i don't remember who the streamer was it was

00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:29,340
not ninja just so you guys know it was not ninja it was not
ninjas i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure if it was ninja it'll

478
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:38,440
be a million dollars a million a million per month if it was
ninja but like it was some fucking fortnite creator like a

479
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:46,060
fortnight streamer years ago years ago they could like
passively make 500 g's per month and i was like that is

480
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:58,760

fortnight every day bro that shit that shit makes bank holy

ninja of that game and then pray to god they have a creator

487
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:11,860

Marvel I swear if Marvel rivals becomes the next I please

491
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:56,780

Marvel rivals will um I honestly I don't know I mean it has

492
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,980
potential but like I've stopped I've stopped like hoping and
I've

493
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,320
I'm sorry, but I've stopped believing

494
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:23,120
It seems like a quick cash grab Our only hope is if, like,
what's the company?

495
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,640
What's the game company that makes Valorant and League
again?

496
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,860
What are they called again?

497
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:38,520
Riot, my only hope is if Riot makes a Battle Royale Or a
team-based shooter because they'll do everything they can to

498
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:50,200
pump millions of dollars into the game to make it work we
all thought csgo 2 would save us but csgo 2 practically

499
00:52:50,200 --> 00:53:06,200
killed csgo we all thought the finals would be the next hype
but then it died so fast toky no please riot games make

500
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:18,400
battle royale or a multiplayer or a fucking team-based
shooter please riot is doing major no they're making a

501
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:30,320
fighting game their next step is a team-based shooter or
battle royale no i missed the battle royale genre i missed

502
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:35,740
it so much i remember we used to rule the world Now we're
just like Starcraft.

503
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,560
Now we're just like...

504
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,000
Now we're just like strategic games.

505
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,140
Finding games are trending now.

506
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,100
I miss when PUBG was the way it is now.

507
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,360
There's just too many hackers in PUBG.

508
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,660
Peter, thank you for this super chat.

509
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,540
Thank you, thank you.

510
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:11,840
uh guess the files met its finale thank you for the super
chat thank you thank you it's the fighting game era no i

511
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,540
only mean fighting games are always super popular i used to
i mean i watch evo quite often i watch it on and off i used

512
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:26,160
to i don't i don't know actually i haven't watched evo in
like three years two years in two years because i never had

513
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:33,680
the time but like you know two to three years but they're
like when i had the time i would watch evo but usually the

514
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:44,160
finals because like that was like the most hype um the evil
finals um but uh evil like fighting games have always been

515
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:50,280
popular because they have such a diehard fan base and like
the thing about like fighting games is i mean it's similar

516
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:57,520
with like shooters where like aim can translate to any type
of game and like usually fighting game fighting game players

517
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:04,340
like esports players they can like they can transfer their
skills to like different types of fighting games so because

518
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:11,560
like the combos are usually like not like that not similar
in a way but you can transfer like how like different types

519
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:17,960
of like you can transfer it easily to different types of
fighting games and that's why like uh i know like esport

520
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:25,480
pros in fighting game genres would be like specialist they
won't be like specialists in one game they would like they

521
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:36,540
would be they would like know how to play and also win uh
win uh competitions and tournaments in different types of

522
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:44,800
games within fighting games um so they don't have to be like
just like oh they're only specialized in this one game they

523
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:55,600
can like literally enter so many different games um as a
player uh and yeah the it transfers from game to it easily

524
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:08,420
transfers from game to games yeah like justin wand and sonic
fox yeah yeah that's what i was like thinking about too so i

525
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:13,540
don't see like fighting games as like i feel like they've
always been popular i don't think they're like oh they're

526
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:22,540
like it's a new rise it's a new trend now i think they've
always been pretty popular um because of evo uh sleepy ash

527
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:22,760
thank you

528
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,900
I always wish there was like I was I wish I can adapt

529
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,920
I wish I can adapt

530
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:55,540
my genre is dying what do I do adapt or die but what if I'm
too slow to adapt

531
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,040
Um, um, yeah.

532
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,040
Oh my gosh.

533
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,700
It's been an hour already?

534
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,980
Holy shit.

535
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,480
I can talk for so long.

536
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,280
I really am a yapper.

537
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,360
The learning curve is too steep.

538
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,860
I think it's because, like, I mean, oh my gosh, there's so
much stuff to do.

539
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,140
There's just so much stuff to do.

540
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:37,420
It's hard to make time these days to, like, do stuff so um
so like that's like one of my biggest issues it's just hard

541
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:45,300
to make time to learn new video games and stuff and um
there's a lot to learn like i had like friends that are like

542
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:55,600
you should learn league that's like bro by the time i get
good at league like league people have been playing league

543
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,620
for fucking 10 plus years like that's just impossible

544
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:17,220
you should not like i also like i don't like mobas i really
i really don't like mobas and there's too many characters in

545
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:25,500
league too and then they'd be like but like oh you should
learn league you might like it i'm like bro by the time i

546
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:33,900
even like figure out how to fucking play league the game
would have moved on the game people would be like people who

547
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:43,080
were like at my level when I started would be like 50 times
better than me do not learn league it's a not successful you

548
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:51,000
can see we're chatting like thank you also like it's such a
money pit same with Riot same with Valorant people always

549
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:02,200
complain about skins and like currency prices for like other
games apex and overwatch but league and valorant is the

550
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:09,760
biggest money pit ever when it comes to skins because they
already set the grounds on like the default of how expensive

551
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,540
they are that like people don't complain these were all
sheep because we're like oh that was the default anyway so

552
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:21,220
it's fine like knife skins being fucking 40 dollars like
what the fuck is that bullshit like

553
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:40,920
like i'm just being like oh my god but like an overwatch
skin would be like maybe like five to ten dollars like a

554
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:50,560
fucking knife in valorant it would be so goddamn expensive
and people will buy multiple skins of that too like multiple

555
00:59:50,560 --> 01:00:00,040
cosmetics from that and it's actually i feel like i like i
don't want to say that But like, Fortnite skins are funny.

556
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,020
The thing of...

557
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,700
The thing is, I buy Fortnite skins for the crossovers.

558
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,080
But Valorant is like purely like cosmetics.

559
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,720
Like, like the design from the store itself.

560
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,200
Like, I buy Fortnite skins because I don't want to be
fucking Vegeta in Fortnite.

561
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,340
Like, I want to be Peter Griffin in Fortnite.

562
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,240
Like, it's funny.

563
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,920
It's just...

564
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,220
It's just funny.

565
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:39,580
And still cheaper than the fucking valorant knife it's still
cheaper um but oh my god i just think like they're so smart

566
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:52,240
they're so smart make the default so fucking expensive that
the consumers don't care it's it's so smart oh my god it

567
01:00:52,240 --> 01:01:01,180
really is because people complain about the cost Every other
game except for Valorant and League.

568
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,060
And then, like, well, the characters are locked as well in
League, right?

569
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,920
So, like, there's, like, locked characters in League.

570
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:14,120
And then if meta changes, you might as well, like, purchase
the characters and stuff.

571
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,580
So they're so smart.

572
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,140
It's just business.

573
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,700
They know how to do business.

574
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,120
Yeah, yeah, you need to unlock them.

575
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,860

They will be silent.

605
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,560
It just never fails.

606
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:37,120
and never fucking fails they don't even need to do
crossovers that's how lucrative they are they don't need to

607
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:42,540
do crossovers to actually like i mean they do like k-pop and
stuff but those aren't like actual crossover crossover

608
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:49,180
because they're original music they're like um they're like
original stuff but like other games have to do real fucking

609
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:56,420
crossovers to make people play their game that's how
powerful riot is riot marketing is so good like like

610
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:04,480
overwatch has to do like collabs with different celebrities
and different like animated stuff and like but like but like

611
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,700
right doesn't have to care they just make original content
and they don't have to revenue share they're like we don't

612
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:18,060
need a collab of a k-pop uh we're like we don't need a
collab with k-pop people we won't make our own k-pop and

613
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:25,740
then they did i remember there was a sienna with kda where
they replaced i think they replaced like one or the one of

614
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:32,780
the members one or two members in the KDA squad of the
original KDA squad to somebody else because they didn't want

615
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:40,900
to, I don't know what the controversy was, but they replaced
like one or two of the original singers for the original KDA

616
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:46,140
squad because of something, like it was a controversy, and
then no one cared that they got replaced.

617
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,620
They were just like, they were like, whoa, it's not a little
different.

618
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,240
You guys see Rumpur?

619
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:05,480

remember the controversy they just had they replaced one of

620
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,540
the KDA members because of something and then because
they're like I don't know what happened but they replaced

621
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:23,100
one of them and then people were like she sounds a little
different oh well I still love KDA um mama thank you for the

But yeah, they're so smart.

637
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,760
Riot marketing is just...

638
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,180
Riot marketing is just... Riot marketing and PR, they're
just too good.

639
01:06:50,020 --> 01:07:00,000
can't believe they made a game to promote their k-pop group

654
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:14,220
Yeah.

655
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,040
21.

656
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,020
That's supposed to be, like, how it's pronounced.

657
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,660
Yeah, I was a K-pop boomer.

658
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,380
I don't follow K-pop anymore, though.

659
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:32,040
But, yeah, there's, like, apparently, like, K-pop V-tubers
are becoming, like, super popular.

660
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,920
I was reading about how, like, there's a new V-tuber boom in
Korea now.

661
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:42,860
And that's why, like, a lot of people are doing, like,
V-tuber groups based off of K-pop.

662
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:52,400
because like um there's there is a huge vtuber boom now um
in korea so that's why like people are starting like kpop

663
01:09:52,400 --> 01:10:01,720
stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah play is that how you pronounce it
uh it's going like crazy now over there um so that's why you

664
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:08,860
might be seeing like why a lot of like a lot of like people
are focusing on kpop now for vtubers or like a lot of people

665
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:18,100
are doing like kpop stuff or like focusing on marketing in
korea um just because like uh i think like was it play or

666
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:22,940
plav i can't i don't i've never i've only heard like one or
another song because i was curious about it um yeah it's

667
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:29,560
like you know how like the vtuber boom in na because of
covid so it's like there's like a and like there's a vtuber

668
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:38,440
boom in na like that was started because like covid and
stuff and it was like a vtuber boom um in like certain

669
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:45,880
countries and stuff like that because like certain so now
the vtuber boom is start is picking up now and starting in

670
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:56,520
korea at the moment uh because of because of the vtuber kpop
groups um and and am i pronouncing the name right play or is

671
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:08,920
it plav i can't believe doki is gonna be a kpop and also it
also helps a lot with the fact that like twitch they can't

672
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:16,260
stream on twitch anywhere so they have to stream on youtube
uh so like making music is like one of the easiest way uh

673
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:24,940
it's play v is that right play play v play v is that how you
pronounce it

674
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:40,820
um so yeah they're kpop vtubers now because it's the new
thing it's well not new thing but it's the vtuber boom now

675
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:46,400
um it also like doesn't help Oh, that BTS is still in the
army.

676
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,760
Um, it's still in the army.

677
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,920
They're still in the army.

678
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:56,660
So, like, people are looking at, like, new, I guess, like,
new substitutes for it.

679
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,660
And that's why, like, people have migrated to, like,
VTubers.

680
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,420
Um, yeah, because they're, like, the BTS VTuber now.

681
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,040
Yeah.

682
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:12,020
It's, um, so they're, like, the VTuber.

683
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,500
I guess you could call them like BTS vtubers

684
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,740
BTS is in the army yes that's why they're yes

685
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:35,340
wait guys were you under the rock they've been in the army
for a while now that's why a lot of kpop fans have migrated

686
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:41,680
to vtubers because they were trying to find substitute to
BTS I was like they're like BTS is in the army

687
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,940
Are you guys living under a fucking rock?

688
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,140
Yes, that's why.

689
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,860
I think it's like two years.

690
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,780
I'm pretty sure.

691
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,640
I think it's like around two years.

692
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,420
And then they're back.

693
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,900
This has been a minute.

694
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,880
It's like two to three years.

695
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,260
Yeah, two to three years.

696
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,020
So I thought I thought I was like super super interesting.

697
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:28,100
But yeah, if you guys don't know, Twitch like what I think
it was like I don't remember the whole thing.

698
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:32,480
Oh yeah, I think it was like Korea wanted to it was weird.

699
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:32,860
It's weird.

700
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,880
It's so complicated.

701
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,260
Because like Twitch didn't want to pay the extra fees or
something.

702
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,160
So then so they're like now we out.

703
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,780
Because they're like, we're losing money anyway.

704
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:44,440
So we're out.

705
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,420
To be fair, Twitch is always losing money.

706
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,660
If you guys didn't know, Twitch has not made back their
money yet.

707
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,000
They're still in the negatives.

708
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:56,700
So because like bandwidth and like servers, server hosting
is like crazy fucking expensive.

709
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,900
And Twitch is already like losing money.

710
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:08,000
And then like they, I think like the ISP wanted to charge
more to Twitch.

711
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,000
But then they were like, bro, we're already fucking losing
money.

712
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,500
Like, no.

713
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:16,600
And then they're like, and then, and then I guess like, I
guess like the ISP was like, you won't leave.

714
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,500
There's no way.

715
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,260
You need us.

716
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,660
And then Twitch was, Twitch like, was like, bet.

717
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:21,880
And then they left.

718
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,140
And then like, there was this whole thing.

719
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:33,020
There was this whole thing where like, I think like the ISP
tried to try to pursue a lawsuit against Twitch.

720
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:33,900
Yeah, what would you do?

721
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,280
Leave?

722
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,340
And then Twitch was like, okay.

723
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:36,620
Okay.

724
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:40,200
Okay.

725
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:46,900
And then I think like they try to pursue a lawsuit against
Twitch But something is like, wait, you can't leave.

726
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,600
Here's another.

727
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,760
We're gonna find you if you leave and Twitch was like bye

728
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:08,660
It made a lot of it was it really sucked because it meant
like a lot of twitch streamers even like chatters to they

729
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:18,240
can't sub to their favorite streamers like a lot of like
korean uh stream like chatters or like korean um accounts on

730
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:25,420
twitch they can't even like sub or do anything i think they
can chat they can chat but they can't like uh donate

731
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,800
anything they can't buy anything or anything on twitch to
support their streamers so it like really sucks for like the

732
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:39,240
chatters and also like the the content creators too um so
like I know like a lot of them moved to like Africa is that

733
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:52,320
it I know like Africa YouTube cake um the like I think it's
um pretty interesting that it basically like rejuvenized um

734
01:15:52,320 --> 01:16:00,800
Africa because like yeah Africa TV for those who don't know
Africa TV is it's the it's like the Korean like a Korean

735
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:09,700
equivalent to Twitch and um and like when Twitch started
more popular nobody really used africa anymore but because

736
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:20,180
of the twitch band everyone went back to africa i remember
because um because overwatch used to be like super popular

737
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:28,220
in korea and a lot of like korean streamers will use africa
um it was like completely dead and now it's like back now uh

738
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:32,020
because of twitch being kicked out of korea uh

739
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,740
I thought it was, like, really interesting.

740
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,520
It always goes back to Overwatch.

741
