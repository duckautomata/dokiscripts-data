For content!

123
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,940
Okay, but you need to die while the camera's rolling!

124
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,600
You can't die without the camera.

125
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,540
That's the point.

126
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,660
Your life will be worthless.

127
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,340

We all know.

137
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,200
The person with the camera can never die.

138
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,820
I think we're gonna die.

139
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,420

We'll be fine.

143
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,960
What I've learned is that if you go down, it'll eventually
go up.

144
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,800
Oh, shit.

145
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,460

I got the spider.

162
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay, yeah, I can't be that.

163
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,260
Oh, my God.

164
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,960
I can't be that dangerous.

165
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,960
He missed.

166
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,340
He missed.

167
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, we go this way.

168
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,540
We go this way.

169
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,220
It's okay.

170
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,500
He's not chasing us, huh?

171
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,080
And we're okay.

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,100
We're so fine.

173
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,440
It's alright.

174
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,680
The beginning level is never that bad.

175
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,780
There's only, like, one really scary monster, and everything
else is fine.

176
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,420
Oh, look at you, Min-Max, and everything.

Okay.

00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,960
Look at that.

194
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,720
What we learned...

195
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh.

196
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,580
It's okay.

I have 20%.

198
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,240
What we learned is that you're indestructible.

199
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,460
Just like that M.

200
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,600
Night Shama Lama movie.

201
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,080
You're right.

202
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,820
I should get to that one.

203
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

204
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,820
Maybe not again.

205
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,480
Maybe not even.

206
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,420
Maybe I should test it out.

207
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,400
Maybe I'm invisible just like you.

208
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,840
What do you mean you don't trust me?

209
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,720
I have the flashlight.

Okay, maybe.

00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,210
You wish.

215
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:58,770
You wish.

216
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,510
It's gone.

217
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,990
Sorry, are you dead?

218
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,290
Oh, hey.

219
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,290

220
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,630

225
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,680
She said she had arachnophobia, so I was just like, Oh, my
God.

226
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,140
Han and I were testing out a theory.

227
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,000
And like, oh, yeah.

228
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,240
I was wrong in my theory.

229
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,580
What was the theory?

230
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,120
Well, we're testing out.

231
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,220
We're both invincible.

232
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,600
And like, well, as you found out, how one of us was it.

233
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,760
What kind of fucking Royce?

234
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,880
You guys sniffing and you're just loading the whole world
and you're like, I think it might be fucking invincible

235
00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:01,460
Look it was like myth busters, you know, like Like we gotta
bust that myth The myth is am I fucking god right now?

236
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Oh, but I'm running I just wanted to know And we just look

237
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,060

238
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,780
How is I supposed to know?

239
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,200
I wouldn't survive.

240
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,320

241
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,140

One of us wasn't invincible.

248
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:49,260
I was not supposed to know i wasn't the main character like
everyone thinks they're the main character of this story

249
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:58,440
that might be the most horrific realization is that you're
not the main yeah not even not even on my own stream i'm not

250
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:10,080
the main character it's so up i am so happy for you oh thank

cool kid dude show up for like one episode.

Oh my god!

479
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,580
I gotta charge my flashlight.

480
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,760
What?

481
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,500
Flashlight fully charged.

482
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,940
Can we afford anything?

483
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Anybody want to videotape?

484
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,060
Alright, who hasn't?

485
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,800
Okay, I have it.

00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,720
Don't worry, guys.

488
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,900
I'm a great camera person.

489
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,260
I think you should learn how to backflip snuffy.

490
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:47,860
Backflip?

491
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,180
Do we have enough for it?

492
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,180
I see yoga.

493
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,260
How do you backflip?

494
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
It's in the second.

495
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,180
It's in the first one.

496
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,500
It's $300.

497
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,960
We don't have enough money.

498
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,720
Carrying looks more like confused.

499
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,400
What is thumbnail one?

500
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,560
That's very intriguing.

501
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,500
Is he, like, reverse planking?

502
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,020
There's gymnastics.

503
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,780
We don't have enough money for a backflip.

504
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,180
Yeah, you gotta save up.

505
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,200
Oh, it sounds like it would be good.

506
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,640
You can add, like, a laugh track like...

507

863
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,860
I got so little oxygen!

864
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,920
Yeah, we're kind of running out.

865
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,920
Go to the ship!

866
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,360
Go to the ship line!

867
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,660
I figured it out!

868
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,500
Run to the ship!

869
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,740

870
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,520

871
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,860
I'm sorry, Han.

872
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,160
We don't have time anymore.

873
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,380
Oh!

874
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:36,960
It's the door!

875
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,520
It's the door!

876
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,840
Oh, Doki!

877
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,340

No!

881
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,700
I was just there!

882
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,000
I was just there!

883
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,320
You didn't have to go on the second flight of stairs!

884
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,440
You were so close!

885
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,600
I saw the ship in front of me!

886
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,140
I literally saw the ship!

887
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,040
Oh my god!

888
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,440
Oh my god, I was so close!

889
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,720
That guy killed me like 20 minutes ago!

890
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,800
I told you!

891
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,720
I literally saw...

892
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,560
That was good footage!

893
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,900
Oh my god, that...

894
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,340
I can't How did you die, Snuffy?

895
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:22,780
I got it.

896
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,560
I got killed by the same thing I can do.

897
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,760
How did you die, Han?

898
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,880
Snuffy, please.

899
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:30,860
Please stop.

900
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,140
Snuffy.

901
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,920
How did you die?

902
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,180
You died from the lack of air?

903
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:38,900
All right, bye.

904
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,660
I'm trying to focus right now, but for some reason, the
body's glitching and breathing in the loud man ears.

905
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,400
Oh, shit.

906
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,000
Do I still have to go to the hospital if I'm technically on
the ship?

907
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,480
Yeah, you do because you're fucking dead.

908
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,280
I kept on getting kidnapped by a cartagrade.

909
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,560
It was weird.

910
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,540
Oh my god.

911
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,240
I worked so hard too.

912
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,160
I figured I got out of the maze.

913
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,740
It was like floating up and down.

914
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,460
It was like I was leaning against the wall.

915
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,480
It was vibrating.

916
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,400
I got like a second of it before the camera ran.

917
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:12,840
Oh my god.

918
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,740

Oh my god, what?

962
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,020

997
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,840
The performance anxiety.

998
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,100
Oh, it's a cliff.

999
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:21,340

1000
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:22,400

Hey, Sophie, welcome back.

1003
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:24,580
We're happy.

1004
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,600
I just sat down.

1005
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:26,880
What the fuck?

1006
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,120
You woke up.

1007
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,040
Looking on the voyeur.

1008
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:33,660
Whoa.

1009
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,960
What are you like, Chris?

1010
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,160
We're making content.

1011
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,480
Which side are we uploading to?

1012
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:44,820
Oh.

1013
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,300
Don't worry.

1014
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,280
You're fine.

1015
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,360
I don't sue.

1016
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,360
76% film right off.

1017
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,780
He is a professional.

1018
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:58,480
All right.

1019
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,100
I hope it's that map that I died on so we can get back the
other camera.

1020
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,700
We need our other camera.

1021
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,340
It's a merge.

1022
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,720
It's called submerging.

1023
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,860
It's just submerged.

1024
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:10,680
What'd you call it?

1025
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:12,480
Whoa.

1026
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,900
Oh no, it's another map.

1027
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:14,560
No.

1028
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,640
We're never...

1029
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:16,680
No.

1030
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,680
Is it the lower floor on the same map, I think?

1031
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,700
Oh, on the same map?

1032
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:21,740
Yeah.

1033
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,660
Oh.

1034
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,640
Oh, this flashlight's weird.

1035
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,120
It illuminates really far away and not so much up close.

1036
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:27,720
That's weird.

1037
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,240
Oh, yeah.

1038
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,420
You've got, like, a very nice cone shape.

1039
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:30,960
Oh.

1040
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,980
It's like I turned up the field of view really fucking high.

1041
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:35,940
Don't worry.

1042
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,580
I got my hug ready.

1043
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,540
Is that your hole?

1044
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:38,760
Is that our hole?

1045
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,360
Oh, yeah, this is our hole.

1046
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:40,980
We died.

1047
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,980
We found your hole.

1048
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,280
It was made for us.

1049
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:44,940
Durn, durn, durn.

1050
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:45,980
This was the hole.

1051
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,860
Okay, how I figure out to go upstairs is we have to go down
and then...

1052
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1053
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:52,860
What's that?

1054
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,760
What's that over there?

1055
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,480
Do you see that?

1056
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,220
It's the ship.

1057
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:56,560
Oh.

1058
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,440
You mean the ship?

1059
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,920
Oh, it looks like you had 20 eyes!

1060
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,340
I...

1061
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,360
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

1062
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:10,960
A ship!

1063
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,640
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1064
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,220
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1065
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,820
It's lagged out here.

1066
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, if you go down, you can go up.

1067
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,780
Oh, this is where I threw myself down when I was being
chased by a spider.

1068
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,500
Oh, wait, this was not the same down I found.

1069
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:28,900
There should be monsters down here.

1070
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,820
You can get up from here.

1071
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:31,980
What's that?

1072
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,420
It's a hole.

1073
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,780
You should put your face on the pounder, Snuffy.

1074
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,460
Yeah, you want to get pounded.

1075
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,080
Touch the pounder.

1076
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,040
There you go.

1077
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,640
Are you getting healed?

1078
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:48,720
Oh, thank you.

1079
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,220
Thank you.

1080
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,200
Yeah, that was good.

1081
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,100
Don't worry.

1082
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:51,900
Oh, nice.

1083
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,200
Are you full HP?

1084
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:53,900
I was working.

1085
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:54,560
What about this?

1086
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,100
Will this grind my bones too?

1087
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:56,720
No?

1088
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,500
No, it won't.

1089
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,420
You should touch it.

1090
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:00,720
Okay.

1091
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,540
Are you not going to test the theory?

1092
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,220
I got to do it for the- You're not going to get myth busted?

1093
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,480
What's the myth?

1094
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,920
The myth is that will it grind your bones?

1095
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:12,980
Will it?

1096
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,500

I'm hugging me!

1135
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,600
That's what?

1136
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:05,860
What's up?

1137
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,880
Oh, are they dead?

1138
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:08,540

One's dead.

01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,120
Let's get out and hug me.

1148
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,700
I'm never gonna be the hugger again.

1149
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,780
The hugger never gets hugged.

1150
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,660
The hugger never gets hugged!

1151
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,680
What's the point?

1152
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,040
Did you die?

1153
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:43,860
I died.

1154
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,660
I died for the content.

1155
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:50,440
I'm tied for the content for the extra views.

1156
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,140
The hugging arc is over.

1157
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:59,360
No longer will I provide comfort for people with trauma.

1158
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,820
I'll never give...

1159
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:06,500
I'll never have physical touch ever again.

1160
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,160
I'll be a bubble child.

1161
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,140
I'll be in my little bubble.

1162
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,640
No touchy.

1163
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,660
I am the sole survivor.

Dude, she fell.

1176
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,720
She fucking slipped and fell.

1177
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,740
Oh my god.

1178
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,320
That was really humbling.

1179
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,540
We got the content.

1180
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,720
We got it.

1181
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,320
Yeah.

1182
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,440
We also don't...

1183
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,260
I am not the hugger anymore.

1184
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:59,200
refuse to hug anymore no one ever hugs the hugger emotional
damage

1185
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,140
what the hell is this

1186
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:29,320
we're practicing for a big debut was made for me that apple
looks tasty

1187
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:49,420
founder there's uh the the the scary guy that disappears and
reappears he's here oh oh that oh no that's a shaker world

1188
01:10:53,770 --> 01:11:10,470
star oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Wait,
where did he come from?

1189
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,750
It's a monster mash.

1190
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,510
That was another one.

1191
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:16,750
That was so, you had like three monsters on you.

1192
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,630
I didn't realize the other guy was there.

1193
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:23,750
This expedition, if you see this footage, make sure to like
and subscribe.

1194
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,030
Who knows what will happen.

1195
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,670
I like that.

1196
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:35,290
Just cut off before Snuffy died.

1197
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:36,510
No.

1198
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,730
I think I ran out of footage there.

1199
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:41,750
The moment she slipped, it was never caught on tape.

1200
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:46,110
I think the beginning was worth it.

1201
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:54,490
That means we can like use our third tape for the next one.

1202
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,370
Because we hit our quota.

1203
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,610
We can save the next footage.

1204
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:00,610
Min max.

1205
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:01,630
Min maxing time.

1206
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:02,810
So we need to like take a day off?

1207
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:07,510
No, like we can like film it and then for we get the footage
for the next day.

1208
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:15,190
I hope this game gets updated and not left to die like pal

I didn't know what happened there.

I think I'm doing it.

1224
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,240
I've never seen a backflip.

1225
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,320

Those are the two people that didn't like and subscribe.

1255
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,900
That's what happens when you don't click the bell button.

Yeah, this is what happens when you don't click it.

1258
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,440
Wait, where are we going?

1259
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,360

Oh wait, this is how I got lost.

1263
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,020
Yeah, this goes back to where we were.

1264
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,640
Wait, no, we went down, didn't we?

1265
01:15:58,660 --> 01:15:59,900
We went up, didn't we?

1266
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah, there's no ship.

1267
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,660
We went up, but if we go down, we go back to the shadow.

1268
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:04,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1269
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,320
We went to go this way.

01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:05,720
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,680
I forgot which way I went.

Things are blurring together.

1273
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,600

Oh, it's here.

01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:21,560
Okay, don't worry.

Let me know when you feel okay now.

1333
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:27,760
Let me know.

1334
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,380
I got 28% film.

1335
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:29,840
Okay, that's good.

1336
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,360
That's enough.

1337
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,900
Let me know when you feel okay.

1338
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,200
Let me know.

1339
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,480
Let me know.

1340
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,540
Let me know.

1341
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,380
Don't worry, I'm here for you.

1342
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:44,110
Okay.

1343
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:49,310
We got, I feel like let's start slowly head back to our ship
because you have 28, right?

1344
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,770
Okay.

1345
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:50,270
Yeah.

1346
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,570
You can maybe get something on the way.

1347
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,350
Yeah, we might as well just head back.

1348
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:55,370
The turtle guy went back.

1349
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:56,590
He went up the stairs.

1350
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:57,790
Yeah, don't worry.

1351
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:58,970
He realized there's no more.

1352
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,290
No, they both went to the ramp, I think.

1353
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,770
There's no more screen time for that guy.

1354
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:09,670
Guys, I feel like not having a flashlight was not a great
idea.

1355
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,210
I have one, but I also have the camera.

1356
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:13,010
Does someone want the camera?

1357
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:13,530
Oh, wait.

1358
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:14,630
I can hold the flashlight.

1359
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:17,690
This is our expensive one.

1360
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:18,450
It's a skidadler.

1361
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:20,130
Skidadler.

1362
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:20,950
Around the corner.

1363
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,090
Oh, check this out.

1364
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:22,650
Wait, check this out.

1365
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:23,370
He's slow enough.

1366
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:24,130
All right, get this in frame.

1367
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,770
Okay, okay, KK.

1368
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:25,770
Wait, back up, back up.

1369
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:31,580
It's so sick, though.

1370
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,600
It's so sick.

1371
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,480
It's so sick.

1372
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,800
Oh my God, you're going off.

1373
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:45,220
Okay, we have to get out before she hits the bottom because
if she hits the bottom, she crashes the game.

1374
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,560
I had a friend fall off.

1375
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,200
She was, like, getting faster and faster and further away
because I was watching her progress on the ship.

1376
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,480
And then when she got a certain distance away, the game just
crashed.

1377
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,260
Oh, shit!

1378
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,440
That's a flabber!

1379
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,300
I'm okay!

1380
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:09,800
I'm running, I'm running!

1381
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,520
Are you still okay?

1382
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:21,890
Guys, I don't think she's so okay anymore.

1383
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:37,290
Guys, I don't think she's still okay.

1384
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:43,590

Are we good?

1417
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:21,730
One of those kids that just learned how to like flip in
school and they just keep doing it.

01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:27,890
Yeah, but I don't think I don't think you've learned get

01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:44,450
I landed it that time.

1426
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:48,410
I don't know, it might despawn at the end of it, like, a
section.

1427
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:53,250
Is it, oh, does it, oh, it despawns after the end of the,
the, the quota?

1428
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,430
I would think so, but it would be nice to be wrong.

I don't know where he went.

1443
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,190
Oh, he fell over.

1444
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:57,850
He fell over.

01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:58,410
Oh, he's over there!

1446
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:58,890
He's over there!

01:24:58,970 --> 01:24:59,550
I see him!

1448
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:00,870
He's running!

1449
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:02,910
Watch me do a back clip.

1450
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,170
All right, nice.

1451
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:09,930
I think we're okay.

1452
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:12,890
All right, where do we go now?

1453
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:15,790
We don't have any hugs.

1454
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:17,550
We're broke right now.

1455
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:18,110
Nope.

1456
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:19,090
He's coming back.

1457
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:22,250
And we're like one of those channels that's wasted all their
money.

1458
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:22,830
Fight me.

1459
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,650
For one thing.

1460
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:26,250
That's right, buddy.

1461
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:27,210
Moto, Moto.

1462
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:28,350
Fist to fist.

1463
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,770
Oh my god, guys, there's a fight that's about to happen.

1464
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,400
Guys, I'm 1 HP!

1465
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,200
Guys, I'm 1 HP.

1466
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,760
I'm 1 HP.

1467
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:47,900
I got hit.

1468
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,360
I got hit.

1469
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,000
Wait, there's a spider, I think.

1470
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,980
There's a spider, too!

1471
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,960
Oh my god, today's not a good day, guys.

1472
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:59,040
Today's not a good day!

1473
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,080
Oh!

1474
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,960
Hey guys, hey guys, there's a spider by the way.

1475
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,620
Yeah, I could see you.

1476
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:11,760
Yeah.

1477
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,260
Did Hot have anything back?

1478
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,740
Did Hot die again?

1479
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,680
Did Hot, wait, someone else stick there?

1480
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:17,320
Pretty sure.

1481
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,380
I kind of do want that though.

1482
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:23,980
We could check the, we could check the ship to see if...

1483
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:24,380
There's something up there!

1484
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,040
There's something up there!

1485
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:25,860
There's something in the exit!

1486
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:28,020
Guys, wouldn't it be funny if there's something in front?

1487
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,380
Holy crap!

1488
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:32,720

01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,580

01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:53,040

It's okay, we can grab the camera back, we can grab it back.

1505
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,460

That was so scary.

We broke this step.

Don't worry, this one's best thing.

1521
01:28:57,850 --> 01:28:58,070
Goodbye.

1522
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:00,750
Quick, quick, press the button.

1523
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:01,770
Press the button.

1524
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,490
Alright, I knew...

1525
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,150
Don't worry, I'll find the camera.

1526
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:12,910
Alright.

1527
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:14,490
Don't worry, guys.

1528
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,450
I'll find the camera.

1529
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,930
Wait, is this new?

1530
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,190
No, it's the same place.

1531
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:20,890
No, okay.

1532
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,190
The camera should be somewhere around here.

1533
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:23,790
There it is.

1534
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:25,150
Should I just take it back to the ship?

1535
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:26,310
Yeah, yeah, I think you should...

1536
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,450
How much film do you have left?

1537
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:29,850
51%.

1538
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,170
Oh, shit, we have so much film.

1539
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,630
The camera's broken, though.

1540
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,130
Oh, no, it's broken.

1541
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:36,190
I'll take it back.

1542
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,070
Yeah, just throw in the...

1543
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,990
Throw in the thing.

1544
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:41,630
Do we still get the CD, though?

1545
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,030
Yeah, yeah, we can get the CD.

1546
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:44,490
We just can't film with it.

1547
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:48,450
Because we got slapped so fucking hard.

1548
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:53,310
I heard the slapper gives like a lot of content.

1549
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,730
I heard that every single time it slaps, it hits the light
button.

1550
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:00,070
Goodbye.

1551
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:10,070
I'm here.

1552
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,510
Wait, where's...

1553
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:12,090
Where's Snuffy?

1554
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,010
Snuffy might have ordered off.

1555
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:18,470
Oh, whoa, whoa!

1556
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,850
Like, where the fuck did she go?

1557
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,870
We gotta find the slapper.

1558
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,970
He gives, like, a lot of views.

1559
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,290
What's that word call when you use somebody for content?

1560
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,230
What about their consent?

1561
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,650
Oh, no!

1562
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,230
What's that?

1563
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:39,730
What happened?

1564
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:41,130
What is that?

1565
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:44,090
Oh, it's a...

1566
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:46,150
It's okay.

1567
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:46,510
It's okay.

1568
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:47,010
Just walk.

1569
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:47,850
Run the round.

1570
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:50,130
Oh, yeah.

1571
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,710
We're gonna exploit these monsters.

1572
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:54,710
Did you exploit the monster?

1573
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,590
It's so dark.

1574
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:58,470
I don't know if my camera can see him.

1575
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:59,770
Oh, no.

1576
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,230
What about the content?

1577
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:03,350
Oh, she dead?

1578
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:05,030
Oh, she's dead.

1579
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:05,610
Oh, wait.

1580
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,110
Did you film?

1581
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,750
Wait.

1582
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:07,730
What's that?

1583
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,710
Yeah, I got it.

1584
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:11,570
You got it?

1585
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:12,490
Okay, go back to the ship.

1586
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,450
Go back to the ship.

1587
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:14,730
Oh, shit.

1588
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:15,070
Okay.

1589
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:16,930
Where's the ship?

1590
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:18,630
Are you good?

1591
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:19,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1592
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:19,750
I'm good.

1593
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:20,410
I'm walking up.

1594
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:21,050
I'm walking up.

1595
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:22,370
I don't know if...

1596
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:23,090
alive.

1597
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,010
We only have 80% recorded.

1598
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:28,430
Okay, but if you just keep recording that one monster, I
think we can...

1599
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:30,370
I don't want to be able to get a lot of views, right?

1600
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,530
Maybe there's something up here?

1601
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:35,030
Oh, that's true.

1602
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,230
Wait, where is the... Oh, that ship is over there.

1603
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:39,710
Is Han dead?

1604
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:40,870
I'm gonna check the ship.

1605
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:42,130
Okay.

1606
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,650
Alright, let me check if he's dead, dead.

1607
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:47,550
I can't believe we saw that.

1608
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,690
The first thing we saw.

1609
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:52,010
Alright, let's see if he's moving.

1610
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:53,810
Oh, he's moving!

1611
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:54,550
He's alive!

1612
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:57,250
He's alive!

1613
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:00,470
Okay, I'm gonna bait a monster near you.

1614
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,550
Alright.

1615
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:04,790
Han!

1616
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:07,590
Han!

1617
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:09,650
Oh hey, you're alive!

1618
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:10,570
Okay, nice.

1619
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:11,490
Only Lyme died.

1620
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:14,130
I feel like...

1621
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:16,010
We might be able to...

1622
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,270
We might be able to find monsters outside.

1623
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,010
I feel like we could...

1624
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:20,990
Sounds scary outside.

1625
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:21,970
We can't like juke them.

1626
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,330
Oh, we'll be fine.

1627
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:25,170
We'll be fine.

1628
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:30,390
Yeah, apparently they like hear our voices too.

1629
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:36,050
The fitness grand pacer test is a multi-stage aerobic
capacity test.

1630
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:38,690
Black and yellow, black and yellow.

1631
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:41,310
Oh, there's another door here.

1632
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:44,150
Maybe I'll find another monster from here.

1633
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:47,310
I need my stamina though.

1634
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:48,290
Monster!

1635
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:52,090
We're here to exploit you for views, for content.

1636
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:59,750
Monster Monster Oh What's that?

1637
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:01,150
Do you hear that?

1638
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,730
What the

1639
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,160
fuck?

1640
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,700
Okay, welcome Welcome to death.

1641
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:18,080
I really hope they remember to pick up the camera when we
leave because I'm not sure if it will come with us if it

1642
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,280
just sits in the thing.

1643
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:19,980
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,220
I was like, I was gonna say, did you get that?

1645
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,000
And then I died.

1646
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:34,640
I Don't know how to deal with that monster once it gets you
it just chain throws you and you fucking die It's a like

1647
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:44,720
make another person aggro it before it picks you up again I
guess the aggro it Got you Oh god, they have to go home.

1648
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,580
Just go home.

1649
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:50,820
We got the content Yeah, how do you not have more content?

1650
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,220
How about we going stay over here?

1651
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,780
Oh, he's going to be a bait.

1652
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:57,640
I die for the content.

1653
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:58,760
He's going to do it.

1654
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,800
Take the film back.

1655
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,120
Okay.

1656
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:00,500
No.

1657
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,260
Snuffy, what are you doing?

1658
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,580
Why are you still walking following him?

1659
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,020
She good.

1660
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:08,760
Talented.

1661
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:09,340
Lucky.

1662
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,680
I think they're going to die, Lai-mu.

1663
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,320
I think...

1664
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:15,860
They're so fun.

1665
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:16,520
How much...

1666
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:17,620
Yeah.

1667
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:18,400
There's so...

1668
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,220
Everything...

1669
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,300
I have come to bring Kusil.

1670
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,120
Just becomes really fucking lethal.

1671
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,040
So nice.

1672
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,180
That nice stuff?

1673
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,380
Themself?

1674
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:26,720
Yeah.

1675
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,060
Thyself!

1676
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,660
I trust the vision.

1677
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,360
I trust it.

1678
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,580
It's too dark and I can't find you.

1679
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,360
We can do it.

1680
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:35,680
There's no way...

1681
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,940
I just realized there...

1682
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:37,960
Oh, it's a little snail.

1683
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:38,740
That's okay.

1684
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,860
The spookiest of monsters.

1685
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,080
A snail.

1686
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,680
What is this, Mr. Snail?

1687
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,020
Oh, ha ha ha ha!

1688
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,660
So spooky.

1689
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,800
We still have 30%, but maybe we'll catch something on the
way out.

1690
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,500
He's a natural content creator.

1691
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,000
Very much, sir.

1692
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:04,760
We're pretty...

1693
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,040
I feel like we have good odds to re-encounter something.

1694
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:08,460
I don't know.

1695
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:09,800
They're so dead.

1696
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:10,640
There's no way.

1697
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,960
I don't think they're going to make it to the ship.

1698
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:17,240
We've always got, like, fucked up the last possible second.

1699
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:18,180
Hello.

1700
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,560
Go up.

1701
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:21,880
What are you guys doing?

1702
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,260
Your oxygen.

1703
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,120
Mr. Conter?

1704
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:28,840
Oh.

1705
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,500
How much oxygen do they have left?

1706
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:33,500
Look at their back in the canister.

1707
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,240
Oh, shit.

1708
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,800
That's not a lot.

1709
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,120
Yeah.

1710
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,480
That's why I was like, why are they still exploring?

1711
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:41,300
Oh!

1712
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:42,820
Oh!

1713
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,800
Yes, Han?

1714
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:45,500
Uh.

1715
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:46,440
Han?

1716
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,840
That only happens if you don't die.

1717
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,500
What was that?

1718
01:35:53,440 --> 01:36:05,680
Our entire life relies on snuffy now she doesn't know where
to go oh she does okay i thought it couldn't smother her

1719
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:20,280
bones we literally myth busted that oh no no not the
monster's gonna grab her at the very end oh no we needed you

1720
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:25,760
at the bait Oh, she's so close to the ship, though.

1721
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,000
Oh, there it is!

1722
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,600
Oh, fucking...

1723
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,340
I can't...

1724
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:39,980
Oh, my God!

1725
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:41,000
Oh, my God!

1726
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,400
He's fucking kidding me!

1727
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:47,400
Wow!

1728
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,480
Now that's two cameras!

1729
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,120
Do we not get that bad?

1730
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:54,640
We put the camera in the spaceship maybe it came back.

1731
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:55,520
Is it still there?

1732
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,180
Oh, we put the first okay We just got back.

1733
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:00,100
Oh my god Holy shit.

1734
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,740
It's back.

1735
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,120
Okay, we got the listed camera.

1736

You don't know that.

1868
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:38,660
There could be a...

1869
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:39,980

We could have done some limbo.

1878
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:59,680

01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:22,660
We finally lived!

1922
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:22,900
Okay.

1923
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:32,760
We have to figure out if the first camera or the second, the
first camera would give us the views or not.

1924
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,920
Or should we just commit to the last one?

1925
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,700
The first one might have giant footage.

1926
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:39,460
We could do that.

1927
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:40,140
Alright.

1928
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,920

We save the other.

1939
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:24,770
If we don't make enough views, we can use it.

1940
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:26,110
But for now, we'll do this one first.

1941
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:27,850
Okay.

1942
01:49:27,850 --> 01:49:31,220

01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:02,960
Oh, here we go, here we go.

2016

01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:14,900
World tour.

2019
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,020
Okay.

2020
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:20,540
Make them wait till the very end.

2021
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:23,720
That's like our channel intro.

2022
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:30,400
That's a big font on top of that.

2023
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:34,560
Oh my gosh, thank you.

2024
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:35,540
Don't mind what the heck.

2025
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:37,820
All right, here, I'm ready.

2026
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,160
Oh, this flashlight's great.

2027
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:41,380
Look how much light I get here.

2028
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:42,580
I got the defib.

2029
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:44,440
Nice.

2030
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:46,900
So like, if we die, I have the defib reader.

2031
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:49,760
This is the best flashlight.

2032
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:50,900
Nice.

2033
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:52,640
Oh wait, is this a hole that we can jump down here?

2034
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,000
Okay.

2035
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,380
Who has the camera?

2036
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:56,240
I do.

2037
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:57,360
Okay, watch this.

2038
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:00,260
Oh wait, no, not yet.

2039
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:00,520
Not yet.

2040
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:01,140
I fucked it up.

2041
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:01,900
Okay, watch this.

2042
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,200
Watch this.

2043
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:04,880
God damn it.

2044
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:05,240
Okay.

2045
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,080
Give me a sec.

2046
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:06,820
I can do this.

2047
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:12,800
One more time.

2048
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:13,740
One more time.

2049
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:14,900
What the fuck?

2050
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:15,560
I'm floating.

2051
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,400
It was worth it.

2052
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:21,920
It was worth it.

2053
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:22,500
It was worth it, guys.

2054
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:23,840
It was worth it, guys.

2055
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,340
I used like 20,000.

2056
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:26,380
5% of film there.

2057
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,620
It was worth it.

2058
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:30,380
We could get so much content.

2059
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,320
Whoa, did you guys hear that?

2060
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,080
Oh, no, it was the door.

2061
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,100
We gotta find what down is up.

2062
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,220
See, look, down is up.

2063
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:42,840
I told you.

2064
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:45,660
Look, there's a thing here.

2065
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:46,900
It's up here this way.

2066
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,380
Can we not go up here?

2067
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:51,860
Where did this go?

2068
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,020
Wait, I feel like, let's split up, gang.

2069
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,860
Wait, who has the camera?

2070
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,880
What's the point of splitting up and making it?

2071
01:54:58,920 --> 01:54:59,800
He's recorded.

2072
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,440
You don't know that?

2073
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,440
We could like find him in another area.

2074
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,340
Wait, where did you guys go?

2075
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:11,840
Hello?

2076
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,600

2078
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:27,430

2120
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:02,080
It doesn't look like there's anything.

2121
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,500
It's gonna be the first guy I want to see.

You killed me.

2186
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:34,310
I didn't know.

2187
02:02:34,330 --> 02:02:35,190
I opened the door.

2188
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:38,270
I opened the door.

2189
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,870
That's different.

2190
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:40,570
I'm back.

2191
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:40,970
I opened the door.

2192
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:42,010
Thank you.

2193
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:44,750
I didn't want to hear Han yell at me.

2194
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,010
Here's your defense.

2195
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:49,890
Oh, it's not me still with the camera.

2196
02:02:49,950 --> 02:02:51,250
Oh, no.

2197
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:53,410
Oh, wait, she found the camera?

2198
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:54,710
No.

2199
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,460
Okay, we have, we have, I don't remember how far they've
been called.

2200
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:03,120
It's not that far.

2201
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:06,160
Okay, what, okay, let's just try and find the other camera.

2202
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,220
We just need the other camera.

2203
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:10,200
Does anyone, oh.

2204
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,980
Do you, do you, I don't know.

2205
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:12,620
What the fuck is that?

2206
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:14,220
It's like, it's a mouse.

2207
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:17,600
We gotta figure out how to find it, where the other camera
is.

2208
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:19,480
Where could it be?

2209
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:20,400
Was it above us?

2210
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:21,300
Okay, I think, yeah.

2211
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,520
No, it would have fallen.

2212
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:25,360
No, I meant like the second camera.

2213
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,860
The camera we died with.

2214
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,660
We gotta figure out how to...

2215
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,240
It should be above us, right?

2216
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:37,560
There's something in here.

2217
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,200
Oh no, we don't have a camera to catch it, too.

2218
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:41,580
Nope.

2219
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:43,020
Oh no.

2220
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:44,560
It's making plopping noises.

2221
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,920
I'm kind of uncomfortable, actually.

2222
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:46,560
Me too.

2223
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:48,780
It's getting closer.

2224
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,720
Oh god.

2225
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:54,220
Limeo?

2226
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:56,300
Limeo?

2227
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,160
I think they hit terminal velocity.

2228
02:03:59,220 --> 02:03:59,500
Oh.

2229
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:02,680
Wait, what happened?

2230
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:03,620
What happened?

2231
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:06,260
When you fall for a certain amount of time, it crashes the
game.

2232
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:07,200
Did you crash too?

2233
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:08,440
What the fuck?

2234
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:09,720
Yeah, yeah.

2235
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:10,740
If someone falls.

2236
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:12,820
Wait, I'm still in the game.

2237
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,260
I'm still in the game.

2238
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:17,140
It just works.

2239
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:18,500
Well, I think we were...

2240
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,300
Well, actually, I don't know.

2241
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:20,320
I don't think we were screwed.

2242
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:21,240
That super sucks.

2243
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,980
We haven't come back yet, though.

2244
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,000
Wait.

2245
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:26,200
No, I think I gotta restart the game.

2246
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,240
Oh, shit.

2247
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:29,100
I'm still in the game.

2248
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:32,580
I'm still in.

2249
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:36,860
Guys, I was still in the game.

2250
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,140
Oh, you were?

2251
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:40,660
Yeah, I'm still.

2252
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:41,960
We crashed.

2253
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:44,200
I wasn't even the server owner.

2254
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:49,180
Wait, how was the server owner?

2255
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:51,040
Han, you gotta remake the server.

2256
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:54,100
Huh?

2257
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:54,520
Huh?

2258
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:55,860
I would make the server.

2259
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:59,860
We had terminal velocities, so everything was crashed.

2260
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:03,460
Okay.

2261
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,460
All right, let me...

2262
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:06,320
I've been disconnected.

2263
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,640
I'm going to wait for the invite.

2264
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,140
I got you.

2265
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:10,560
Oh, my God.

2266
02:05:11,860 --> 02:05:13,640
I can't believe I opened the door.

2267
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,420
You put me four all the way down there.

2268
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,380
How is I supposed to...

2269
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,180
I just opened the door.

2270
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:24,320
Oh, I wonder what's keeping them anchored down inside the
ship.

2271
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:25,520
You know, maybe he's glitched or something.

2272
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:26,640
Like, just open the door.

2273
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:28,720
Okay, you walked into him.

2274
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:32,380
That was your fault for walking into the guy.

2275
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:33,920
And you kicked me off the cliff.

2276
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,440
We had a defib and everything.

2277
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,580
We were planned for this.

2278
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:38,360
It was for the content.

2279
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:40,480

There you go.

2358

There you go.

2359
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:17,630
There's a bone.

Hey guys.

shovel-type moment.

02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:22,190
Yeah.

2364

2368
02:11:26,610 --> 02:11:27,350
Look at the sick bone.

2369
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:28,290
Oh, it's right behind you, I think?

2370
02:11:29,050 --> 02:11:29,450

02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:33,730
Tombery!

2378
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:35,250
What the fuck is that?

2379
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:36,190
Oh, shit!

2380
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:39,330

2382
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:41,310
Oh, no!

2383
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:41,830
Oh, no!

2384
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:42,430

2385
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,690

2387
02:11:43,970 --> 02:11:44,370
Okay.

2388
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:46,790
Wait, did he die?

2389
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:47,910
Did he got shot?

2390
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:51,250
He got shaped to death!

2391
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:55,690
Don't worry, I'm the defense!

2392
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:56,510
Where is he?

2393
02:11:56,730 --> 02:11:57,550
Oh, look, there's goop.

2394
02:11:57,650 --> 02:11:58,250
There's goop right here.

2395
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:58,970
Where's his body?

2396
02:11:59,230 --> 02:12:00,290
He's still in my thing.

2397
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:01,210
He's still in my thing.

2398
02:12:01,410 --> 02:12:01,850
There's go.

2399
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:03,110
There you go.

2400
02:12:03,930 --> 02:12:04,590
Don't worry.

2401
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:06,750
You're alive!

2402
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:08,670
Han, you're alive!

2403
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:10,430
Get down from here!

2404
02:12:11,530 --> 02:12:11,950
Han!

2405
02:12:16,030 --> 02:12:17,570
Get chucked him down!

2406
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:19,330
Oh my gosh.

2407
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:20,430
He's done it again!

2408
02:12:20,530 --> 02:12:21,670
You've done it, Han!

2409
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:22,070
Han!

2410
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:23,290
You should have bought an Emo.

2411
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:24,790
Wait, there's a slime!

2412
02:12:25,230 --> 02:12:25,590
Oh god.

2413
02:12:26,050 --> 02:12:27,290
No, it's his slime!

2414
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:29,550
He spent our money on that slime!

2415
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:33,990
Guys, we have to get him down because there's a cool down
for him.

2416
02:12:35,290 --> 02:12:36,170
The shooting robot!

2417
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:37,750
The shooting robot on the grabby hook!

2418
02:12:42,090 --> 02:12:42,390
Ah!

2419
02:12:45,810 --> 02:12:46,390
Oh!

2420
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:48,090
Oh!

2421
02:12:48,690 --> 02:12:49,590
Oh my god.

2422
02:12:50,490 --> 02:12:51,830
He was so doomed.

2423
02:12:52,610 --> 02:12:53,190
Oh my god.

2424
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:54,670
No, we're fine.

2425
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:56,250
No, indeed.

2426
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:59,210
Did I revive you and you were just still stunned?

2427
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:01,210
Were you still alive when you were trapped?

2428
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:04,110
It's very time again.

2429
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:08,910
Oh my god, did she get the content, no?

2430
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:12,550
Did she get the content?

2431
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:14,590
I think she has to go.

2432
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:16,470
I think she has to leave.

2433
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:19,190
I need to go get everybody's...

2434
02:13:19,190 --> 02:13:19,430
What?

2435
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:21,450
No, just leave.

2436
02:13:21,690 --> 02:13:22,330
Just leave.

2437
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:23,330
It's not worth it.

2438
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:26,070
It's not worth it.

2439
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:30,630
At least if she dies, she could just leave the camera here,
maybe.

2440
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:32,190
Oh, that's true.

2441
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:33,370
That's true.

2442
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:36,630
Oh, see.

2443
02:13:36,890 --> 02:13:37,310
Gigabrain.

2444
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:40,450
Yeah, yeah, but the thing is, there's like three monsters
outside.

2445
02:13:40,610 --> 02:13:41,890
I can literally hear it.

2446
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:44,310
We can literally hear, like, them pulsating.

2447
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:47,710
Yeah, they're pulsating against the door right now.

2448
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:50,410
Oh, oh, oh.

2449
02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:52,010
Nobody's there.

2450
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:53,330
Nobody's there.

2451
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:54,470
What's the worst that could happen?

2452
02:13:56,170 --> 02:13:56,890
She dies?

2453
02:13:57,370 --> 02:13:58,750
That would be so funny, though.

2454
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:02,370
I like how she's looking at the ground.

2455
02:14:03,670 --> 02:14:04,710
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2456
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:05,530
It's right there.

2457
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:06,210
It's right there.

2458
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:06,630
No, no, no.

2459
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:07,430
Oh, yeah, I don't see it.

2460
02:14:07,510 --> 02:14:08,310
Oh, I see it now.

2461
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:11,590
He brought like a...

2462
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:13,290
I feel like we just got, like, ganged up.

2463
02:14:14,730 --> 02:14:16,370
I hope she remembers the ceiling guy.

2464
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:19,830
Oh, that would be so funny if she doesn't remember.

2465
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:22,670
Wait, there's two of them there.

2466

I haven't seen him.

2487
02:16:01,370 --> 02:16:03,110
There was, like, something behind her.

2488
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:07,470
All right.

2489
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:08,810
We're back.

2490
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:09,750
We're back.

2491
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:10,670
We're back.

2492
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:11,210
Look at that.

2493
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:12,750
Two dollars of hospital bills.

2494
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:14,190
We didn't hurt too hard.

2495
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:16,150
I tried to fall through the world again.

2496
02:16:17,370 --> 02:16:19,810
I defibbed you and you immediately started falling.

2497
02:16:20,190 --> 02:16:20,990
Wait, that's what happened?

2498
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,830
Yeah, yeah, no.

2499
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:23,290
Your body started falling.

2500
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:25,550
I was like, well, I was like, I'm back.

2501
02:16:25,670 --> 02:16:28,290
I was like, JK, I'm still dead.

2502
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:31,310
I got baited.

2503
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:36,010
Yeah, no, I, like, I went back to the ship and your body was
like...

2504
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:37,150
I was just not here.

2505
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:39,210
All right, we got...

2506
02:16:39,210 --> 02:16:41,230
We have really good content for this.

2507
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:43,430
I did save this, so here you go.

2508
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:43,890
Here's your defense.

2509
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:45,210
Oh my god, I'll charge it.

2510
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:46,410
Oh, wait, it's fully charged already.

2511
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:46,830
Nice.

2512
02:16:47,870 --> 02:16:49,610
That's good, because Zifa was like $300.

2513
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:51,450
I couldn't find a flashlight, unfortunately.

2514
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:52,270
It's alright.

2515
02:16:53,510 --> 02:17:04,390
Flashlight's so replaceable Don't walk into it Don't walk
into it We're gonna do it who has the least important items?

2516
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:05,710

2530

The Doki collision.

I don't know where the camera is.

2566
02:20:30,350 --> 02:20:31,490
No, I saw her.

2567
02:20:31,590 --> 02:20:34,230
She was behind us and she was behind.

2568
02:20:34,230 --> 02:20:35,070
I might be dead.

2569
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:36,170
Oh my god.

2570
02:20:36,310 --> 02:20:38,170
It was either Snuffy or Mermaid either.

2571
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:39,570
We need to go get the camera.

2572
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:41,370
He's camping the room.

2573
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:42,070
I can see him.

2574
02:20:42,190 --> 02:20:42,830
Okay, okay.

2575
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:44,090
I'll stay here.

2576
02:20:44,830 --> 02:20:45,270
Okay, no, no.

2577
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:46,050
Use me as bait.

2578
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,490
Wait, wait, wait.

2579
02:20:46,690 --> 02:20:47,990
I can't hear you anymore.

2580
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:48,670
No!

2581
02:20:51,450 --> 02:20:52,030
It's okay.

2582
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:52,730
We can do this.

2583
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:53,530
I remind you.

2584
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:54,670
They took your voice.

2585
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:55,070
Okay.

2586
02:20:55,290 --> 02:20:57,290
We don't need to know.

2587
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:59,770
We can do this by spirit.

2588
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:02,730
Oh, there you go.

2589
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:04,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2590
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:08,870
They don't need, doesn't need my voice.

2591
02:21:10,430 --> 02:21:10,730
Okay.

2592
02:21:11,310 --> 02:21:12,510
We can figure this out.

2593
02:21:14,890 --> 02:21:16,130
Okay, here's the plan.

2594
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:18,490
That's not the plan.

2595
02:21:19,250 --> 02:21:21,130
If you can, I can't hear you.

2596
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:23,310
If you can hear me, you keep the items.

2597
02:21:23,410 --> 02:21:24,150
You stay here.

2598
02:21:24,290 --> 02:21:25,570
I'm gonna make a hero run.

2599
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:25,970
Okay.

2600
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,030
When he fucks off.

2601
02:21:27,710 --> 02:21:27,970
Okay.

2602
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:28,530
Okay.

2603
02:21:28,650 --> 02:21:28,850
Okay.

2604
02:21:29,370 --> 02:21:30,290
Yeah, fantastic.

2605
02:21:30,570 --> 02:21:30,750
Yeah.

2606
02:21:31,310 --> 02:21:31,850
Here we go.

2607
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:33,890
When he leaves.

2608
02:21:34,510 --> 02:21:34,990
Jesus Christ.

2609
02:21:35,230 --> 02:21:36,930
I don't think he's gonna leave.

2610
02:21:36,970 --> 02:21:39,970
And you know, if I die, I'll stop moving and then you can
come out and rest me.

2611
02:21:40,050 --> 02:21:40,550
It'll be great.

2612
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:41,030
Yeah.

2613
02:21:42,130 --> 02:21:43,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2614
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:45,390
Okay.

2615
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:47,010
Bro.

2616
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:48,690
Stop camping.

2617
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:49,330
Oh no.

2618
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:51,610
He's camping us.

2619
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:53,210
Why was he here?

2620
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:53,890
Wait, can you hear someone die?

2621
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:57,590
Wait, it's the shaker.

2622
02:21:58,030 --> 02:21:58,470
What the fuck is that?

2623
02:21:58,470 --> 02:21:59,350
It's the shaker.

2624
02:21:59,370 --> 02:22:00,310
It's London!

2625
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:03,450
It's London again!

2626
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:07,670
Oh no!

2627
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:10,010
This is our last day, too!

2628
02:22:13,070 --> 02:22:14,370
It's not leaving!

2629
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:17,610
I kind of want to open it.

2630
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:27,440
I wish I could hear you.

2631
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:31,140
Sometimes I can still hear your voice.

2632
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:32,140
Don't talk.

2633
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:34,480
Don't talk.

2634
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:37,940
Stop laughing!

2635
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:40,140
Stop laughing!

2636
02:22:45,490 --> 02:22:47,930
I don't think they're going to leave.

2637
02:22:48,370 --> 02:22:49,310
Stop talking!

2638
02:22:49,510 --> 02:22:49,690
Wait.

2639
02:22:51,130 --> 02:22:51,390
Wait.

2640
02:22:51,890 --> 02:22:52,810
It's going quiet.

2641
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:56,330
Why does it sound like one of them is flying?

2642
02:22:58,590 --> 02:23:01,290
Shut the fuck up, I move!

2643
02:23:04,410 --> 02:23:04,830
Okay.

2644
02:23:05,330 --> 02:23:05,670
Okay.

2645
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:07,370
I'm going to go for it.

2646
02:23:07,450 --> 02:23:07,950
Where do...

2647
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:08,470
Let's see.

2648
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:11,370
Neither of them are further than 50 meters away.

2649
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:13,470
There's, okay, the camera must be close.

2650
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:14,530
Here we go.

2651
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,890
Here we go.

2652
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,610
Here we go.

2653
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:20,430
I see the fucking Tomberry.

2654
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:22,150
Okay, wish me luck.

2655
02:23:22,490 --> 02:23:23,130
Bye, Doki.

2656
02:23:23,690 --> 02:23:24,090
Bye.

2657
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:24,610
Bye.

2658
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:34,030
Do you think she's alive still?

2659
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:36,590
Yeah.

2660
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:47,170
Stop moving.

2661
02:23:48,310 --> 02:23:49,310
She's still moving.

2662
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:53,530
She's still moving.

2663
02:23:54,490 --> 02:23:55,310
I think it's okay.

2664
02:23:56,330 --> 02:23:57,510
No, she's still alive.

2665
02:23:59,270 --> 02:23:59,810
41.

2666
02:24:02,470 --> 02:24:03,730
She is still running.

2667
02:24:03,970 --> 02:24:05,870
She's running really fast right now.

2668
02:24:06,430 --> 02:24:08,030
I think she's getting chased.

2669
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:14,490
She's...

2670
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:15,990
Oh, she stopped.

2671
02:24:16,310 --> 02:24:16,970
Wait, no?

2672
02:24:17,710 --> 02:24:18,290
Oh, she's...

2673
02:24:18,310 --> 02:24:19,110
She stopped.

2674
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:23,150
Ah.

2675
02:24:24,670 --> 02:24:26,810
No, she stopped.

2676
02:24:33,310 --> 02:24:35,890
Yeah, she stopped.

2677
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:54,760
She's dead.

2678
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:56,420
She's dead.

2679
02:24:56,980 --> 02:24:59,140
No, she's 100% dead, guys.

2680
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:00,840
She's so dead.

2681
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,780
No!

2682
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:08,120
Okay.

2683
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:13,950
Okay.

2684
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:15,290
Gotta be quiet.

2685
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:32,030
Oh no, it's a shaker.

2686
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:34,110
Oh no.

2687
02:25:34,470 --> 02:25:35,950
Oh no, it's a shaker.

2688
02:25:36,650 --> 02:25:37,050
No.

2689
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:40,170
No, please.

2690
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:42,310
Let me get to them.

2691
02:25:42,730 --> 02:25:45,050
I'm trying to find the camera.

2692
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:48,430
I don't even have hugs.

2693
02:25:50,310 --> 02:25:51,070
Oh.

2694
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:52,850
Oh my god.

2695
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:55,230
I don't even have hugs!

2696
02:25:55,390 --> 02:25:56,870
This is the last day!

2697
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:14,430
No!

2698
02:26:22,670 --> 02:26:23,990
Oh my god!

2699
02:26:24,890 --> 02:26:25,090
Oh!

2700
02:26:25,970 --> 02:26:27,990
It's right there!

2701
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:29,710
Yeah!

2702
02:26:30,930 --> 02:26:31,430
No!

2703
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:34,830
We failed!

2704
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:36,930
We failed to gain popularity!

2705
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:37,830
No!

2706
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:58,070
I got chased by two of them two of them are running circles
shanking me oh my god you think this was a good time to call

2707
02:26:58,070 --> 02:27:05,830
it I got the camera but then they shanked me twice it was
awful guys it was a great time having you guys as my content

2708
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:21,330
team good job but i think every channel deserves to die at
some point we gotta do our own solo careers guys we have to

2709
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:32,230
break up and to be our own let's plays but they didn't want
to listen we all gotta separate and make our own channels

2710
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:35,670
and get our own play button i'll die out there

2711
02:27:38,690 --> 02:27:48,950
the group hunt you have a personality i don't know how to
transition out of this i'm gonna die no my content dried up

2712
02:27:48,950 --> 02:27:58,730
you do not need to be restricted as a group collaborator you
can do solo content too i have views on youtube i'm gonna

2713
02:27:58,730 --> 02:28:09,550
start streaming don't make me start streaming no that was
fun i had a great time Thank you.

2714
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:10,930
I got a great time.

2715
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:13,810
It was so nice to meet you, Daimu.

2716
02:28:14,890 --> 02:28:16,350
It was wonderful meeting you.

2717
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:16,830
Thank you.

2718
02:28:16,890 --> 02:28:18,190
Thank you for coming and hanging out.

2719
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:18,590
Yeah.

2720
02:28:19,070 --> 02:28:21,610
I will never hit a million views.

2721
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:24,490
This was like the same area where I died too in my last
collab.

2722
02:28:24,990 --> 02:28:26,070
I didn't get past 300.

2723
02:28:27,010 --> 02:28:28,270
I didn't get past 300.

2724
02:28:28,410 --> 02:28:30,610
It's because our flapper keeps showing up and wiping us.

2725
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:36,050
Bro, like, how could, how the fucking, we just got there too
and he just showed up.

2726
02:28:36,730 --> 02:28:37,150
Yeah.

2727
02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:38,670
He was just like, hey.

2728
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:40,510
I'm gonna ruin your whole career.

2729
02:28:40,510 --> 02:28:44,510
Yeah, we never got chance to afford a stun gun because we
kept dying.

2730
02:28:44,910 --> 02:28:47,370
We kept wiping out.

2731
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:48,290
That's so fucked up.

2732
02:28:48,370 --> 02:28:51,070
We got stream sniped to the point we had to get a stun gun.

2733
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:56,290
Guys, we should have.

2734
02:28:56,290 --> 02:29:00,410
Guys, we should have hired a bodyguard instead of somebody
that fucking hugs.

2735
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:03,950
The content is even raw.

2736
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:05,970
The raw content.

2737
02:29:06,210 --> 02:29:06,950
People want the emotional.

2738
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:07,990
They want those hugs.

2739
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:13,450
Ruralness Okay, thank you guys for playing.

2740
02:29:13,450 --> 02:29:14,230

Oh my god I can't believe it.

2749
02:29:35,950 --> 02:29:38,090
We died in the same place.

2750

This is the same same view count we're never gonna hit a
million we'll never hit a million but it was great i had a
