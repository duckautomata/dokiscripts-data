1
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,410
Oh!

2
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,230
Wait, you're not...

3
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,350
Wait, Sunny's live, right?

4
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,830
Okay, I'm live.

5
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,530
I'm live now.

6
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,890
I'm live.

7
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,370
Okay.

8
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,590
Just so you know, I'm also live now.

9
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,130
Just so you know, I'm also live now.

10
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,930
Damn, I can't tell you guys about my address and where I live anymore.

11
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,390
That's not...

12
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,690
Oh yeah, don't worry.

13
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,090
I can still say it out loud.

14
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,470
Don't worry, I'll just repeat it so everybody knows for sure.

15
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,550
So it was like...

16
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,110
Can you remind me Are you guys talking?

17
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,130
You guys are talking and I can't hear nobody.

18
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,490
Oh yeah, they're talking in game.

19
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,410
Damn it.

20
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,010
I'm putting it up as fast as I can.

21
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,490
Any settings that you would recommend or anything in this game?

22
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,270
No.

23
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,510
Tell her to get in the lobby and we'll tell her.

24
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,810
Yuki says to get in the fucking lobby and we'll tell her.

25
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,690
I'm calling it true, true.

26
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,050

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,890
Alright, we're just waiting for Snow.

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,130

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,710
I love how...

32
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:53,030
I love how we were like nobody's live and then Snuffy came in and was like oh shit and then left.

33
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,710
She just immediately assumed the absolute worst.

34
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,170
She was like oh no they must be discussing trade secrets.

35
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,990
Oh no.

36
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,830

44
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,890

Tier 3?

86
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,110
I'm so fucking low.

87
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,970
I subbed.

88
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,670
You gotta make sure you turn the audio to like really low.

89
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,910
Because this game's audio is fucking terrible.

90
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,310
It's a funny...

91
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:06,670
I just like to watch.

92
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,050
I think I just like...

93
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,190
I think I just like maxed it on my stream.

94
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,930
Oh you maxed it?

95
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,150
Bro you're fucking crazy.

96
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,930
Like what you hear in this room is not as bad as...

97
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,450
Hello chat.

98
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,250
Hello.

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,710
Can you hear us?

100
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,750
Nothing.

101
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,930
Is this loud enough?

102
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,800
Han is just standing there like...

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,180
Hey.

104
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,680
Somehow he's the loudest.

105
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh my god.

106
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
He didn't even say anything.

107
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,300
You can actually turn us up and down individually if you hit escape top right.

108
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,980
I had to turn push to talk on because my dog is playing with a squeaky toy.

109
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm just gonna test.

110
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,480
You can't hear me.

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,200
Nothing bad will happen.

112
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,500
I was just wondering how the fuck are you the loudest Han?

113
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,480
You literally barely said anything.

114
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
You got the HD though.

115
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
Oh yeah true.

116
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,060
You can hear his voice even smoother.

117
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
I need the DLC to get HD.

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,300
Yeah.

119
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,320
Holy shit you are loud.

120
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,220
What the fuck?

121
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,300
Hello.

122
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,900
Wait how do you guys get funny... oh.

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,160
Yeah you can change your face.

124
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,360
You can draw a penis.

125
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,860
What's that?

126
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,480
You can rotate it as well.

127
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,260
What the fuck is that?

128
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,260
I think I fucked it up.

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,740
How do I get rid of this?

130
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,220
There you go.

131
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,400
You have deleted your face.

132
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,000
You just have to clear it up.

133
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,060
Oh what are you trying to do?

134
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,740
Oh are those balls?

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,880
Oh okay.

136
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,520
I was like what the fuck?

137
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,740
Do you see the balls?

138
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,340
Like what the fuck are you doing?

139
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,540
It's Peter Griffin.

140
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,480
Guys this is like Christian...

141
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh yeah it does look like Peter Griffin.

142
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,560
The ball chin.

143
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,660
This one is kind of swag actually.

144
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,460
I dig that.

145
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,980
What color are you guys?

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,700
I want to be blue.

147
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,420
I'm red.

148
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,060
I have no idea what color I am.

149
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,440
I think I should be blue.

150
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,040
Yellow.

151
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,240
Wait let me look at your faces.

152
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
Let me take a quick look for reference.

153
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,220
Alright.

154
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,240
That's me.

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,080
You got a bunch of tits.

156
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,200
You're just very happy.

157
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,760
Very content.

158
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,100
And you're quite the opposite.

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,340
Alright some good faces.

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,880
Wait Han.

161
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,800
Han you're fucking icon Sonic?

162
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,880
Stop.

163
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,160
I was like what the fuck is this guy on my screen?

164
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,700
Oh my god it is.

165
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,280
It's like Sonic 1 Sonic.

166
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,360
Yeah the OG Sonic.

167
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
I love the wagging finger Sonic.

168
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,380
That's like the most iconic.

169
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,000
You're gonna change it Steve?

170
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,640
Oh the guys here?

171
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,620
Keanu Reeves is gonna be Shadow.

172
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm so excited.

173
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,540
I am so excited for it.

174
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,260
It's gonna be amazing.

175
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
Oh my god for the casting for them.

176
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,400
I feel like all the budgets went to casting for that movie.

177
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,260
Is Sonic even like somebody cool?

178
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,680
Yeah.

179
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,660
He's just like a guy right?

180
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,940
No he's not just a guy.

181
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,060
He was in like...

182
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,840
He was in DuckTales.

183
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
For real?

184
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,420
Yeah.

185
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,020
He was one of...

186
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,620
He was like Louie Dewey and the other guy.

187
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,520
I don't remember who he was.

188
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,140
No fucking way he was Huey bro.

189
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,680
That's my favorite one.

190
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,420
I can't believe you just called him some guy.

191
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,480
I know but he was actually Huey the duck.

192
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,660
He was Dewey.

193
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,960
That's almost as big as Sonic.

194
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,300
I know he was just as famous.

195
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
But there was like what Idris Elba.

196
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,500
I think Sonic is cool.

197
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,940
As Knuckles and then...

198
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,080
Oh yeah Idris Elba is cool.

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,740
Okay so I think...

200
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,680
That's the guy with the list.

201
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,340
Snuffy is like the only one who hasn't played content warning yet.

202
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I am...

203
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,540
She's like the intern that we hired for our YouTube channel.

204
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
So we sent her first right?

205
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,460
Yeah we sent her first.

206
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,540
Wait we should let Snuffy hold the camera then.

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,040
Like let her...

208
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,060
experience recording for the channel.

209
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,680
Oh god yeah okay.

210
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,960
I just got hired as an editor.

211
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,440
Oh my god you just...

212
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,640
Oh my god and she's doing it for the experience.

213
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,580
Oh my god yes!

214
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,540
One of the biggest YouTubers ever.

215
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,780
I can't wait to do it for the...

216
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,480
exposure.

217
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,720
The exposure you can put that on your resume.

218
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,080
You don't need to get paid you just need views.

219
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,400
Okay so how do I do this?

220
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,960
What do I do?

221
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,100
Okay so who wants to explain to...

222
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,080
Snuffy the instructions on being...

223
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,420
cameraman?

224
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,960
You gotta point it at stuff...

225
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
and capture scary things.

226
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,540
And also you have a limited amount of tape.

227
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
So good luck.

228
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,200
Does it show you?

229
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah it shows you on your top right.

230
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,700
You can also change it to selfie mode.

231
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,480
If you want to.

232
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,200
I have an apple.

233
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,180
Oh cute.

234
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,700
You can get the apple.

235
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
Oh my god.

236
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,080
How did you get the apple?

237
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Howdy folks.

238
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,540
How did you do that?

239
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,840
Oh my god there's apples.

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,740
Very good.

241
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,140
Okay.

242
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,580
Also...

243
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,980
Snuffy just so you know.

244
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,880
My game tends to bug out and every time I come back from a mission...

245
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,380
I lose all microphone audio.

246
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,940
So if I stop talking to you it's not because I hate you.

247
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,020
It's just because...

248
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,080
Okay if I stop talking to you it's because I hate you.

249
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:45,940
Why is that?

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,400
Yeah.

251
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,080
Film us with the apple.

252
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,080
That's content.

253
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,140
Snuffy.

254
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,780
I don't have an apple.

255
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,940
I didn't touch apples.

256
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,340
Film us.

257
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,740
Film us.

258
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,260
Yeah yeah yeah.

259
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,840
Can you drop it like those Burger King commercials?

260
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,500
Oh my god.

261
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,060
What was it called?

262
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,040
Like those thirst traps of an apple?

263
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,660
You're gonna make a thirst trap of an apple.

264
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,620
For the content.

265
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,460
I just wasted so much footage on these apples.

266
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,660
Okay okay let's go fucking...

267
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,500
How much do we have left?

268
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,960
Okay we gotta go.

269
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,840
75.

270
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,920
Nice fantastic let's go.

271
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,740
Let's go.

272
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,200
I like how we didn't...

273
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
We don't need any... we don't need introduction.

274
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,400
We all know who's who.

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,240
Oh yeah true.

276
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,240
I can't even see your name.

277
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll just...

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
We'll call you by your... your... your...

279
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,580
Your color.

280
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,460
Avery red.

281
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,680
Happy happy yellow and upset green.

282
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,440
Yellow where are you?

283
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:49,820
Yellow!

284
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,540
Okay this is where you truly test the audio Snuffy.

285
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,340
Okay this is actually much scarier.

286
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,280
Do you still have the camera Snuffy?

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Snuffy?

288
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,640
Snuffy?

289
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Snuffy?

290
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Snuffy?

291
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:02,940
Snuffy?

292
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,780
She dropped...

293
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,760
She dropped the camera.

294
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Oh.

295
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,360
It's okay I trust in Han.

296
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Han I know you're so good at making content.

297
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,520
I got it stuck in my pocket.

298
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,080
I'm gonna go die.

299
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,460
Yeah go die for content Han.

300
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,740
We have to go viral.

301
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
For content.

302
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,580
Okay but you need to die while the camera's rolling.

303
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,440
You can't die without the camera.

304
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,420
That's the point.

305
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,440
Your life will be worthless.

306
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,240
You would've seen it so that would've been fine.

307
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,260
Yeah but...

308
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,560
Yeah but my eyes don't have film.

309
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,420
Your life is only worth something if it's filmed.

310
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,460
Okay okay record him jumping down Snuffy.

311
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:45,780
Record you?

312
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,900
You want the camera on you right now?

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah yeah yeah.

314
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,480
Welcome to Ghostbusters.

315
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,700
Hey what?

316
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,160
What?

317
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I thought you said Mythbusters.

318
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,640
I was like oh my god what myth are we busting today?

319
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,240
Okay Snuffy.

320
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,880
Just make sure you film all the content.

321
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,060
We gotta go viral.

322
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm in the back here.

323
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,620
I've got the backpack on.

324
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,140
It's okay we all know.

325
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,880
We all know.

326
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,840
The person with the camera can never die.

327
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,620
I think we're gonna die.

328
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:26,680
I think we're gonna die.

329
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,800
No we're not we'll be fine.

330
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,320
We'll be fine.

331
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,720
What I've learned is that if you go down it'll eventually go up.

332
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,140
Oh shit look see.

333
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,220
I already got to the exit.

334
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,960
Look at that.

335
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
I found the exit.

336
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,520
What?

337
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,560
Please film us for the content.

338
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,800
Before we die.

339
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,240
Oh guys.

340
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,540
Okay I'm trying.

341
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,840
Film it film it film it.

342
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
Film it film it film it.

343
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,560
You guys are slow as hell.

344
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,140
Film.

345
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,180
Did you get the spider?

346
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,920
It can't be that dangerous right?

347
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,800
Okay yeah it can't be that.

348
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,160
Oh my god.

349
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
He missed he missed.

350
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,380
We go this way we go this way.

351
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,140
It's okay he's not chasing us.

352
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,820
We're okay.

353
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,780
We're so fine.

354
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,220
It's alright.

355
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,520
The beginning level is never that bad.

356
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,820
There's only like one really scary monster.

357
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,460
And everything else is fine.

358
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,220
Oh look at you min maxing everything.

359
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Yeah that's right.

360
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,880
That's why I'm a gamer.

361
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,260
Try hard.

362
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,300
Look you gotta try hard.

363
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,320
And you wanna go viral.

364
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,560
It's all about studying the algorithm.

365
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
Oh my god what hit me?

366
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,120
What hit me?

367
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,280
What hit me?

368
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,980
What did I got hit by?

369
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm so scared.

370
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,460
Where the fuck are the others?

371
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,780
But.

372
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,260
Whatever happens to me.

373
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,740
Yeah?

374
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm gonna go to the ground and meet...

375
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,740
Hello?

376
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,300
Oh you're okay you're okay.

377
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,440
What's up?

378
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Oh I might be okay.

379
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,260
Okay.

380
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,440
I'd only be bad if I did this.

381
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,900
Do you think he's okay?

382
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,420
You're in zone!

383
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,040
Are you still okay?

384
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,160
You're still okay!

385
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,120
You did it!

386
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,500
Yay!

387
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,980
We're fine we're fine.

388
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,160
Yay!

389
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,620
My flashlight's on.

390
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,560
It's okay I have 20%.

391
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,060
What we learned is that you're indestructible.

392
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
Just like that M.

393
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Night Shyamalama movie.

394
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,660
You're right I should test it out.

395
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,640
Wait wait wait wait.

396
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,620
Maybe not again.

397
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,240
Maybe I should test it out.

398
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,060
Maybe I'm invisible just like you.

399
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,320
I don't trust you.

400
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,800
What do you mean you don't trust me?

401
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,480
I have the flashlight.

402
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,280
Watch this.

403
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,140
Watch this.

404
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,200
Okay.

405
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,790
Okay movie.

406
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,150
You wish.

407
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,650
You wish.

408
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,390
It's gone.

409
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,650
Are you dead?

410
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,090
Oh hey!

411
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,990
I had to stop.

412
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,540
I had to take it from Milo.

413
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,320
She said she had arachnophobia so I was just like.

414
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,220
Jamie.

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
Oh my god.

416
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,460
I...

417
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,860
Han and I were testing out a theory.

418
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,280
And like.

419
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Oh yeah?

420
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,040
I was wrong in my theory.

421
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,400
What was the theory?

422
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,640
Well.

423
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,940
We're testing out.

424
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,760
We're both invincible.

425
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,680
And like.

426
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,340
Well as you found out.

427
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,580
One of us wasn't.

428
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,430
What kind of fucking roids are you guys sniffing?

429
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,260
And you just loaded the whole world.

430
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,780
And you're like.

431
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,380
I think it might be fucking invincible.

432
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,200
Look it was like Mythbusters.

433
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,800
You know?

434
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Like.

435
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,440
We got to bust that myth.

436
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,400
But if he's.

437
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Am I fucking God right now?

438
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,480
Are we busted?

439
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,060
Oh but I'm running.

440
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,540
I just wanted to know.

441
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,640
And we just.

442
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,820
Look he survived.

443
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,360
Look Han survived.

444
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,560
How I suppose to know.

445
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,720
I wouldn't survive.

446
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,620
How do I switch?

447
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,180
Can you like switch who you're spectating?

448
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah.

449
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,980
You can't.

450
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,520
W-A-W-A-D.

451
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,860
Oh...

452
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,320
You must be invincible!

453
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,260
See?

454
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,460
Like, okay!

455
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,420
I was...

456
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,980
I half busted the myth.

457
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,260
One of us wasn't invincible.

458
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,980
How was I supposed to know I wasn't the main character?

459
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,460
Everyone thinks they're the main character of the story.

460
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,260
That might be the most horrific realization.

461
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,000
Is that you're not the main character.

462
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,440
Not even on my own stream.

463
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,320
I'm not the main character.

464
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,880
It's so fucked up.

465
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,340
I am so happy for you.

466
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
Aw, thank you.

467
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,980
I can't believe it.

468
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,220
That means either of us were not the main character, Snuffy.

469
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,460
We're NPCs.

470
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,840
Hell yeah.

471
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,160
We're fucking NPCs.

472
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,000
We're like the cool characters.

473
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,780
Show up for like one episode...

474
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,360
Yeah, and then everybody loves us.

475
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,060
Even though we showed up for one episode.

476
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,480
Yeah.

477
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,520
But everybody loves us.

478
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,020
Wait, where are we?

479
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,000
We have to go here.

480
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,400
We have to go back to the main lobby.

481
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,480
Guys.

482
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,060
I was...

483
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,920
Han and I were trying to do a myth buster thing and we busted a myth.

484
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,540
I was not invincible.

485
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,920
Snuffy, did you call the spider a dumb bitch as you died?

486
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,160
Yes, she did.

487
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,480
We might have used some language.

488
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,540
We might have to cut that for YouTube.

489
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,860
I'm so excited to see our first video.

490
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,700
This is my first ever content.

491
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,520
Oh my god, your first ever YouTube upload.

492
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,220
You get to hear how fucking awful the audio is once it actually gets uploaded.

493
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,700
It's great.

494
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Oh my god.

495
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,140
Our first video.

496
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,420
Guys, we gotta get monetized.

497
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,300
The first video?

498
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,160
You're dreaming.

499
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,200
Guys, we gotta get 3,000 watch hours so we can get monetized.

500
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,680
Don't forget to put a bunch of red circles on the thumbnail.

501
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,120
I'll be on my TV all day.

502
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,280
Howdy folks.

503
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,700
First day on the job.

504
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,600
Let's see how it goes.

505
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,380
Can you drop it in the Everking commercials where they drop food in really HD splashes?

506
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,440
What was it called?

507
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,540
Like those like thirst traps?

508
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,860
Why is this 50% of the video?

509
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
How do you make a thirst trap?

510
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,960
Yeah, you left me so little video to actually film the spider.

511
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm sorry.

512
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,580
I'm sorry.

513
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,340
Oh my god, Snuffy.

514
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,100
I found a spy.

515
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,260
Knee destruction tutorial by Snuffy.

516
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,320
Get

517
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,520
out of my way.

518
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,880
Get out of my way?

519
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,840
You awful...

520
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,260
Alright chat.

521
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,280
Today we're about to find out if this spider web is sticky.

522
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,760
All my friends went missing.

523
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,180
Now let's see if this bitch sticks.

524
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,060
This is pretty sticky.

525
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,980
What the fuck?

526
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,720
I don't think I can move...

527
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,400
I don't think I can move my limbs.

528
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,120
Am I moving?

529
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,440
Am I breaking free?

530
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,680
This is so embarrassing.

531
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,590
I liked it.

532
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,010
That's the last shot of mine.

533
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,450
That was really good.

534
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,170
That was really good.

535
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,030
What a story.

536
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,450
How many views did we get?

537
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,670
Oh we are 1.5.

538
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,510
We're halfway there.

539
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,870
Yeah, we're halfway there one day.

540
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,990
We're halfway there.

541
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,510
Look at that.

542
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,270
We're gonna get monetized soon guys.

543
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,290
That's freaking good.

544
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,710
That's so good.

545
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:15,630
1k?

546
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,290
I don't even know that many people.

547
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,310
Oh my god.

548
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,230
I can't believe that's our debut stream.

549
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,130
1.5k.

550
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,130
Dang.

551
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,390
Oh my god.

552
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,190
We got to title it something good like entangled by sticky web.

553
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,450
Oh no.

554
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,650
We're like what is this?

555
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:46,390
It's a sticky mess and then we're gonna make clickbait thumbnail where Snuffy is covered in white sticky web.

556
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,030
Oh god.

557
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,130
It's not even subtle.

558
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,190
Wait where's the camera?

559
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,570
How do we get there?

560
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,850
Where's the camera?

561
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,390
Wait where the fuck did the camera go?

562
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,590
Wait.

563
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,150
Gotta get asleep.

564
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:03,910
Gotta get asleep.

565
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,590
Oh yeah.

566
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,210
Oh yeah.

567
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,550
Oh yeah.

568
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:05,630
Oh yeah.

569
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,570
I forgot.

570
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:06,870
I forgot.

571
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,430
This is unrealistic because it implies content creator sleep.

572
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,470
Yeah let's go.

573
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,050
It will not let me sleep.

574
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,570
Okay there we go.

575
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:21,790
Alright.

576
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,910
Are we gonna wake.

577
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,950
When are we gonna wake up?

578
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,870
Oh shit sleep streams.

579
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,110
Always gives us views.

580
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:31,490
Yeah.

581
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,910
Oh boy I can't wait to make content.

582
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:33,950
Oh my god.

583
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,190
Yippee.

584
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,230
Another great day to make content.

585
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,470
Another great day to make content.

586
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,730
We need to risk our last reviews.

587
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,450
Alright, who wants to do the camera next?

588
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,250
Yeah, now that we have $200...

589
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,310
We should get the...

590
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:57,470
Wait.

591
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,430
Oh, we...

592
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,790
We gotta get the heal item.

593
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,750
I'm gonna order the heal item.

594
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,610
I'm gonna order the hug.

595
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,190
Does anybody wanna...

596
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,790
Do we get unlimited hugs?

597
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,890
We just can't die.

598
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,730
Also, we might need two more flashlights.

599
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,710
Jesus Christ.

600
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,690
Oh, hey, there's the camera!

601
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,990
I'll grab this flashlight.

602
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,290
Don't worry, I'm gonna charge it.

603
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,890
Oh, it's charged.

604
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,510
So basically, I have a thing...

605
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,010
Snuffy, where...

606
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,950
I hug you and then you're gonna be full HP.

607
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,990
That would be like...

608
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,530
Hug.

609
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,970
Do you have to hold this?

610
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,790
I have to hold to hug you.

611
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,990
And then if you have 0 HP...

612
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,370
Just ask for hugs and I'll be like...

613
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,230
Oh my God!

614
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,750
Oh my God!

615
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,510
What the...

616
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,870
What do you get?

617
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,250
What do you get?

618
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:58,770
What do you get?

619
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,670
We had 100,000...

620
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,250
It's really useful, see?

621
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,970
What is that gonna do?

622
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,090
Worth it, worth it, worth it.

623
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,690
What is that gonna do for us?

624
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,870
It's gonna give me so many views.

625
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,070
The peace side we come in, please.

626
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,610
I'm gonna go viral with this shit, don't worry.

627
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,170
You're gonna go viral with the peace side.

628
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,710
Look, look, look, look, Snuffy.

629
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,950
That's good, that's really good.

630
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,710
Alright, let's go.

631
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,030
Content time.

632
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,470
I'm gonna get like a signature too.

633
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,210
We all have to have like a fun quirk.

634
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,690
A fun quirk?

635
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,070
I'm a Homestuck troll.

636
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,390
We're such a quirky squad.

637
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,290
We're gonna be like the Logang.

638
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,910
What's that?

639
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,170
The Logang?

640
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,150
You know, like that...

641
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,470
That gang from Logang... was it Logan Paul?

642
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,690
He had like a whole gang and stuff.

643
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,470
Oh, the Logang?

644
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,730
What's that Logang?

645
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,650
What was it called?

646
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,250
Team 10?

647
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,190
We're gonna be Team 10!

648
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,050
What's Logan Paul's Oshimark?

649
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,170
What's Logan Paul?

650
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,510
Is it like a Maverick or whatever?

651
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,790
Like some fucking bird?

652
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,730
I don't know why I know so much about that.

653
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,530
I don't know why I know so much about that.

654
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:05,570
What?

655
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,510
I feel like Laura has never even heard.

656
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,230
Yeah, that's not what he called his fans!

657
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,370
The Mavericks or whatever the fuck.

658
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:12,850
The Mavericks?

659
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,650
Because it was like based off of like his fucking bird.

660
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,350
I don't even know if he has a bird.

661
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,070
I think that's a helicopter.

662
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,770
A Maverick?

663
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,230
Nice.

664
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:25,450
Woo!

665
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,730
Holy shit!

666
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,570
That's alright.

667
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,530
Just a scratch.

668
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,850
My god.

669
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,070
It is seeing the fucking flop.

670
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:36,450
Who's the leader?

671
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,630
Who's the team leader?

672
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,810
I think the person with the peace sign.

673
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,910
Oh, you're true.

674
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,350
That's me.

675
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,770
She has the most money apparently.

676
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,150
Sacrifice for the content.

677
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,390
Don't you wanna be just like your Oshi Logan Paul?

678
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,470
Don't

679
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,280
you wanna be just like your Oshi Logan Paul?

680
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,060
Don't let him touch you!

681
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,380
Don't let him touch you!

682
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,340
He got... she got touched!

683
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,480
Where the fuck did he come from?

684
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,100
I think she went this way.

685
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,080
What was that?

686
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,720
Did Hana get like abducted?

687
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,720
Yeah, Hana got abducted!

688
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,920
That's a camera!

689
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,500
She got touched!

690
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,480
That's a camera!

691
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,360
That's the camera!

692
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,820
Wait, no, but you don't insta-die though.

693
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,460
You just get kidnapped, abducted.

694
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,440
We gotta put him on milk cartons soon.

695
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,660
Oh, I gotta go find him?

696
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,320
Oh, there he is!

697
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,340
What's your HP?

698
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,020
Do you need hugs?

699
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,360
Wonderful time, thank you.

700
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,920
Here you go.

701
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,920
Are you fully healed?

702
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
You need a friendship hug?

703
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,340
Yeah, thank you!

704
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,320
There you go.

705
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,700
I got traumatized.

706
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,160
Don't worry, the easiest fix for trauma.

707
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,580
He's coming back!

708
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:44,980
He's coming back!

709
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh my god!

710
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,760
I just see it like...

711
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,580
Wait, does he still have my camera?

712
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,020
No, no, it's okay.

713
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,300
Okay, thank god.

714
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,160
Nothing was lost then.

715
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,920
I only have 31% battery.

716
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,620
Hon!

717
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,740
I think he went up here.

718
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,880
Hon, where are you?

719
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,140
I hear some googly noises, so maybe it's over here?

720
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,860
Did you hear that?

721
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,540
Woo!

722
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,560
Woo!

723
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,900
Guys!

724
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,840
I'm scared!

725
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,820
I'm gonna get abducted!

726
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,420
No!

727
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,880
No!

728
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,180
Oh no, let me go!

729
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,100
Oh no, let me go!

730
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Let me go!

731
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,540
Please!

732
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,640
Oh, okay.

733
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,080
Okay, okay.

734
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,420
I see their faces.

735
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
I see it.

736
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,360
It was a setup.

737
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,220
I see their faces.

738
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,520
Ah!

739
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,740
Guys!

740
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,420
Guys!

741
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,860
Oh, god.

742
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,600
Oh, I hear you guys!

743
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,980
I'm at the spaceship!

744
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm at the safe...

745
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,960
Oh, wait, I got taxied back to my spaceship.

746
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,520
So convenient.

747
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,540
That's so convenient, guys.

748
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,360
I'm just gonna go back to the ship real fast.

749
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,360
I don't feel safe outside anymore.

750
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't feel safe outside.

751
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,680
For content.

752
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,420
Alright.

753
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,580
Just gotta make sure.

754
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,320
Are they alive?

755
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,100
Is Han alive?

756
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,160
Oh, Han's alive.

757
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,200
Okay.

758
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,960
Guys!

759
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,300
Guys!

760
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,980
Woo!

761
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,140
Guys!

762
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,180
Guys!

763
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,940
Fill me!

764
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,940
Fill me!

765
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,400
There's a ghost!

766
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,480
Fill me!

767
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:51,800
Fill me!

768
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,160
Fill me!

769
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,580
Oh my god!

770
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,940
It's not the E-1 Recon!

771
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,400
Please!

772
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,060
Please!

773
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,520
Oh, god.

774
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,360
Someone hug me!

775
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,820
Someone hug me right now!

776
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,280
Oh my god, hug me!

777
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,520
Oh, thank you!

778
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,580
Do you feel better?

779
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,460
Can I get more hugs?

780
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

781
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,140
I need more.

782
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,720
My trauma is alive.

783
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,180
I have a lot of trauma.

784
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,440
Alright.

785
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,380
We're good.

786
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:22,800
We're good.

787
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,260
Yeah, yeah, I can hug.

788
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,700
Do you need hugs too, Han?

789
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,600
Are you traumatized?

790
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,300
Nah, there's no way I need hugs.

791
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,160
Alright.

792
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,620
Guys, I think Han died.

793
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,540
Wait!

794
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,490
Hey, can you hug him back to life?

795
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,950
Guys, he's a strong man.

796
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,610
He's hugging a corpse.

797
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,190
I don't think I can hug him back.

798
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,450
Okay, I ran out of battery.

799
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,530
Let's wrap this bitch right here.

800
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,650
Wait, wait, did you film the dead body?

801
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,750
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,690
Okay, thank god.

803
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,870
At least he didn't die for nothing.

804
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,490
Guys, I had a feeling that maybe Han needed that hug.

805
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,770
Just a maybe.

806
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,210
He died for ads, Reverend.

807
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,510
That's true.

808
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,370
For the ads.

809
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,910
Guys, I think we're gonna get 3000 watch hours.

810
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,690
This one's good.

811
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,870
I think it's really good.

812
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,890
This one has got real good potential.

813
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,050
Oh my god.

814
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,070
I can't believe it.

815
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,610
Han was like Vincent Van Gogh.

816
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,270
After he dies, he becomes famous.

817
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,670
Oh, true.

818
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,030
Here's your flashlight.

819
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,030
I'm gonna hospital bill only $3.

820
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,490
So unrealistic.

821
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,570
I was gonna say it's kinda cheap.

822
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,630
Yeah, I was gonna say.

823
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,070
Let me charge up my flashlight.

824
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,230
Han, I think you needed that hug, Han.

825
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,730
Just a maybe.

826
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,750
And then it will give you a CD.

827
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,890
Just a maybe.

828
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,770
These are pretty retro.

829
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,050
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

830
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,590
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

831
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,670
This is old world technology.

832
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,190
Oh my god.

833
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,550
We're so retro.

834
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,450
I heard CDs can now hold a terabyte of space.

835
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,730
A terabyte?

836
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,970
Is that a lot?

837
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,330
Yeah.

838
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,570
Is that a lot?

839
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,810
I have to hold the hug you and then...

840
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,570
No, you skipped the best part!

841
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,370
Nice.

842
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:23,650
Woo!

843
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,290
Oh, what the...

844
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,090
I'm gonna get it!

845
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:29,590
I'm gonna get it!

846
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:29,950
Dude, help!

847
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,320
I'm running for my life.

848
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,740
Yo, it's hot!

849
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,940
My love!

850
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,640
I'm getting hit by the fucking thing!

851
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,160
Oh god!

852
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,040
What keeps happening?

853
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:00,960
Is this how you lead him away?

854
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,960
Oh yeah, do you wanna check the ship?

855
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,380
Look at you go!

856
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,580
This is really uncomfortable walk cycle.

857
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,480
What's that fucking chat comment?

858
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,560
I didn't know three.

859
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,460
Three's are alive?

860
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,360
Question mark?

861
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,360
Yo, yo, snail guy, snail guy, where did you get your outfit?

862
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,500
Where did you get your outfit?

863
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,360
I got it from Spencer's.

864
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,460
What?

865
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,340
Do you want your hug?

866
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,940
No, you died!

867
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,360
You died!

868
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,180
What the fuck are you filming here?

869
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,460
Oh, there he is.

870
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,440
There's a little snot creature.

871
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,540
What a handsome lad.

872
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,620
Oh my god, I think we did it!

873
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,380
We made the quota!

874
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,300
Hell yeah, we made it easy.

875
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,940
We did it and we can stack the next CD.

876
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,040
The ad revenue was huge!

877
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,840
I know!

878
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,480
Oh my god!

879
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,740
Guys, I think we can...

880
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,560
I think we're close to taking a Raid Shadow Legends sponsor.

881
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,180
I think we're gonna be in an overnight sensation.

882
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh my god, they pay so well.

883
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,260
Like 500,000 Ys.

884
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,780
Oh my god.

885
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,300
We're gonna be so famous that Raid Shadow Legends is gonna notice us.

886
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,460
Raid Shadow Legends!

887
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,640
Brought to you by Raid Shadow Legends.

888
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,620
Sponsored by a meal kit plan.

889
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,100
Or like ExpressVPN.

890
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,080
.

891
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,240
.

892
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,540
Okay.

893
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,340
I gotta charge my flashlight.

894
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,680
What?

895
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,100
Flashlight fully charged.

896
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,600
Can we afford anything?

897
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,000
Anybody want a videotape?

898
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,560
Okay, who hasn't... Okay, I'll videotape.

899
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,480
Don't worry guys.

900
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,180
I'm a great character.

901
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,680
I'm a great camera person.

902
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,120
I think you should learn how to backflip, Snuffy.

903
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,900
Backflip?

904
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,080
Do we have enough for it?

905
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,960
I see yoga.

906
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,280
How do you backflip?

907
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,980
It's in the second... It's in the first one.

908
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,560
It's $300.

909
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,800
We don't have enough money.

910
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,300
Caring looks more like Confine.

911
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,220
What is Thumbnail 1?

912
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,240
That's very intriguing.

913
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,460
Is he like reverse planking?

914
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,780
There's gymnastics.

915
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,660
We don't have enough money for a backflip.

916
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,940
You have to save up.

917
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,380
What about Sound Player?

918
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,000
It sounds like it would be good.

919
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,260
You can add a laugh track.

920
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,380
You're cooler than me.

921
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,720
I get it.

922
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,700
Guys, we can make the next Big Bang Theory.

923
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,220
Bazinga.

924
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah, yeah.

925
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,840
Oh my god.

926
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,940
Oh my god, every time.

927
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,500
Just put a laugh track so people know it's funny.

928
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,320
Oh my god, nice zoom.

929
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,140
This is going to be great.

930
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,380
This is going to be great.

931
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,180
This is going to be great.

932
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,100
Breaking news.

933
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,180
Are we ready for more content?

934
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,720
Let's go.

935
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,040
Let's go.

936
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,260
There's so many sound effects that you can make.

937
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,560
Yeah.

938
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,240
Yeah.

939
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,980
Don't worry.

940
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,960
I think we can get to a million views, guys.

941
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
I think it's possible.

942
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,120
One million?

943
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,300
Yeah!

944
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,460
We're going to get one million play button.

945
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,800
Oh yeah, because I'm not getting like really meta sounds.

946
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,020
You gotta be like super meta.

948
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,000
Like game show intro.

949
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Did no one press the button?

950
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,900
I think none of us pressed the button.

951
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,200
We were just like having a little conversation.

952
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,060
Hello and welcome back to our channel.

953
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,360
Today, this is day 25 of...

954
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,840
This is just...

955
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,460
Day 25 exploring the caverns.

956
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,400
Alright, here we go.

957
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,240
Wait, where is the cavern?

958
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,080
Where are we?

959
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,880
Where the fuck?

960
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,740
Where are we?

961
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,280
Oh shit, what?

962
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,960
Alright,

963
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,890
you gotta put a sound effect while we fall down.

964
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:05,730
Woooo!

965
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,770
Oh, my god!

966
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:08,970
I'm okay.

967
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,270
I'm okay.

968
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,530
Okay.

969
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,450
Alright, here we go.

970
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,750
Where should we go?

971
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,210
What kind of story are we trying to tell with this next video?

972
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:23,810
Yeah, yeah.

973
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,490
What's their story?

974
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:24,910
We gotta...

975
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,510
We gotta make it scripted, guys.

976
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,610
We all know the best content is scripted.

977
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,090
Oh, oh, that's...

978
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,550
That's just Lime over there.

979
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,650
I thought that was a monster.

980
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,170
Okay, so we gotta pay for an actor.

981
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,070
To scare us.

982
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,830
And then make it seem natural.

983
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,070
Oh, no!

984
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,370
Oh, my god!

985
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,950
You guys wouldn't believe what I just saw!

986
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,930
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

987
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,430
I got you.

988
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,210
Boom.

989
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,210
We gotta...

990
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,130
Throw this at her!

991
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,650
Okay, wait, wait.

992
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,270
Don't worry.

993
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,290
Don't worry, I learned this...

994
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,770
I learned this from a friend.

995
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,050
Wait, where did my camera...

996
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,590
Just fall down.

997
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,210
I cannot fall down.

998
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,490
I cannot fall down.

999
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,190
Wait, I can't...

1000
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,170
You gotta hit me.

1001
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,930
We gotta throw something and hit her.

1002
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,830
Wait, somebody like climb on my head or something.

1003
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,470
Somebody climb on her head.

1004
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,070
I'm going to die.

1005
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,110
I'll miss you guys.

1006
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,350
I can't hit her!

1007
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,470
No!

1008
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,130
Did I hit her?

1009
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,430
Oh, she did.

1010
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,650
She's still hanging in there.

1011
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,870
Oh, no.

1012
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,690
Okay, someone's trying to flash light on her.

1013
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,490
Okay.

1014
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,490
So fucking stupid.

1015
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,650
Okay.

1016
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,350
Oh, yeah, dude.

1017
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,750
Wait, wait, put a lap track on there again.

1018
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,590
Put a lap track.

1019
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,210
Okay, nice.

1020
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,650
Where the fuck did I put my flashlight?

1021
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,530
I threw my flashlight on the floor.

1022
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,350
Did you guys take it?

1023
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,530
Oh, I took it.

1024
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,190
Okay, okay.

1025
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:12,970
Alright,

1026
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,330
nice.

1027
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,910
Okay, one of you guys should have the flashlight.

1028
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,930
Because I have the camera out.

1029
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,770
I got the sound effects.

1030
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:24,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,690
Okay, okay.

1032
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,230
Han's our flashlight person.

1033
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,050
I'm the flashlight person.

1034
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,170
Alright, lead us, Han.

1035
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,630
I just realized that maybe we're not good at throwing flashlights.

1036
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:37,870
I'm gonna try to do some things.

1037
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,230
Because all three of us unsuccessfully hit the target.

1038
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,610
Who's that?

1039
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:44,810
Where is he?

1040
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,770
Whoa, what the fuck is that?

1041
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,910
What the fuck is that?

1042
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,770
Oh my god, if only you guys could see what I'm looking at right now.

1043
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,570
Oh my god.

1044
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,530
Oh, shit.

1045
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,830
Okay, he doesn't like that.

1046
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,190
Why me?

1047
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,970
I'm the cameraman.

1048
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,970
I'm the cameraman.

1049
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,950
Oh my god.

1050
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,970
Oh, fuck.

1051
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,030
Oh my god.

1052
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,290
Oh, things are happening right now.

1053
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,110
Oh my god.

1054
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,610
She's dead.

1055
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:15,910
Wait, she's dead?

1056
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,850
Okay, Han, I think we got...

1057
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,870
Han, Han, hug me.

1058
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,850
Hug me, I have trauma.

1059
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,910
Han, you need to hug me.

1060
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,330
I have trauma.

1061
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,550
Yay.

1062
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,590
It'll be all better.

1063
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:31,650
Yay.

1064
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,670
Can I trauma dump on you?

1065
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,430
Hahaha.

1066
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:37,850
Hahaha.

1067
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,210
And that's all, folks.

1068
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,530
Alright, do you need hugs too?

1069
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,330
Alright, nice.

1070
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:44,750
Alright.

1071
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,610
I still... I think we got...

1072
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,930
Do you think we're gonna survive?

1073
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,230
Because I still have 49% of my footage.

1074
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,730
Do we know how to go back though?

1075
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,370
I already got lost.

1076
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,670
Ah, we can survive.

1077
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:56,950
Let's go.

1078
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,390
Alright, alright.

1079
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,310
I believe in you.

1080
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,530
I believe...

1081
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:00,750
What's that?

1082
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,250
What's that?

1083
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,750
What's that?

1084
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,150
Oh, is that this guy again?

1085
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,230
AHHHHHH!

1086
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,710
Go back, go back, go back, go back!

1087
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,310
Why did you split up, Han?

1088
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,330
Oh no.

1089
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,990
Down is up, down is up, down is up, guys.

1090
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,870
Down is up.

1091
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,710
Down is up.

1092
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,390
Okay.

1093
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,810
Oh shit, look at the sick bone.

1094
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,690
Right here.

1095
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,090
Guys, look.

1096
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,830
I found a bone.

1097
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,470
Right here.

1098
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,170
Can you guys see it?

1099
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,810
Okay, wait.

1100
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,450
Wait.

1101
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,590
Look at the sick bone.

1102
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,690
Right here.

1103
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,310
Okay.

1104
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,790
I think you guys saw it.

1105
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,710
Down is up.

1106
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,470
Down is up.

1107
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,910
Down is up.

1108
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,330
Just gotta go...

1109
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:40,470
OH!

1110
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,250
DOWN IS UP!

1111
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,910
I did it!

1112
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,590
Yay!

1113
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,550
I knew I can find my way home.

1114
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:52,590
I knew I can find my way home.

1115
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,350
Spaceship though.

1116
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,630
Alright.

1117
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,690
But where is...

1118
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,710
Oh no.

1119
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,630
No flashlight.

1120
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,490
Oh!

1121
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,690
Where the fuck is that spaceship?

1122
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,890
Where is the spaceship?

1123
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,350
Where is the spaceship though?

1124
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,310
Where is the spaceship though?

1125
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:12,970
That is...

1126
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,930
a little concerning.

1127
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,190
Hello?

1128
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,610
I think I hear sound effects.

1129
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,270
I think I hear sound effects.

1130
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:21,650
From Han.

1131
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,130
Oh, what the...

1132
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,230
It saw me.

1133
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,730
It saw me!

1134
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:33,730
No!

1135
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,490
The camera!

1136
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,370
Oh!

1137
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:38,610
The camera!

1138
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,990
Oh my god!

1139
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,250
It's the camera!

1140
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,240
The camera!

1141
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,240
I can't believe!

1142
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:48,920
Oh!

1143
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,680
No!

1144
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,500
No!

1145
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,280
We all died!

1146
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,580
Her ass was too big a snack.

1147
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,120
Oh shit!

1148
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,720
We had you die, Han!

1149
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,120
We had you...

1150
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,240
We had you...

1151
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,440
We had you die!

1152
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,700
That was great.

1153
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,260
Good job everybody.

1154
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,480
My content!

1155
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,860
Where is my freaking content?

1156
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,060
We gotta find the camera!

1157
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,700
You can actually go back and get the camera.

1158
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,040
We have to get the camera.

1159
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,900
What the fuck did you die, Han?

1160
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,060
Oh god!

1161
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:23,720
Oh, what?

1162
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,860
I got stabbed by that guy.

1163
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,520
That pupil guy.

1164
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,860
Oh shit!

1165
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,020
No, we lost our hugs.

1166
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,400
I can't believe.

1167
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,820
I can't believe I couldn't find the spaceship.

1168
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:36,840
It's okay.

1169
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,080
I still have the peace sign.

1170
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,180
It's alright guys.

1171
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,380
We didn't lose everything.

1172
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,280
You guys lay down on the beds like you're making snow angels.

1173
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,540
Oh my god.

1174
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,920
At least we made Koda.

1175
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,920
We did it!

1176
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,960
Do we need another camera to take to find the camera?

1177
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,580
Yeah, they gave us two cameras so we can like find the camera and then like make more content.

1178
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,300
And wake up.

1179
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,020
We got a lot of money for jumpscares.

1180
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,380
Lime.

1181
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,180
Lime, you gotta wake up.

1182
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,120
Yeah, wake up.

1183
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,240
You gotta wake up, Lime.

1184
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,440
I've been doing content for like 8 hours already.

1185
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,340
Okay, we gotta buy the hug again.

1186
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,580
We gotta get the hug.

1187
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,880
Nice.

1188
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,320
Alright.

1189
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,740
That's all our money.

1190
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,940
I can't believe they monetized hugs.

1191
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,900
Is the soundboard gonna still be there too?

1192
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,920
No.

1193
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,440
We gotta save up for the soundboard again.

1194
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,100
What did you buy?

1195
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,420
What's that?

1196
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,560
Party popper?

1197
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,180
Oh my god, the party popper!

1198
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,880
Alright, we use it for like very important situations cause it's one use only.

1199
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,840
Like when you use it over someone's body.

1200
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,580
Yeah, yeah.

1201
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,180
So like when somebody dies, you pop the party popper.

1202
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,840
Oh, we don't have flashlights, guys.

1203
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,200
I just realized we spend money on party poppers and not flashlights.

1204
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,320
Oh.

1205
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,060
Maybe the explosion will like light us on a brief.

1206
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,080
That's okay, we don't need to fucking see it.

1207
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,280
Yeah, we don't need to see it.

1208
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,080
Our camera can see for us.

1209
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,240
I've got like, I've got magnets in my head.

1210
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,520
You got the 5 G's in your head?

1211
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,060
The fuck do you mean you have magnets in your head?

1212
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,000
What the fuck does that mean?

1213
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,160
I need other things.

1214
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,780
Oh my god, she's got the 5 G's.

1215
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,980
It's okay guys, I've got magnets in my head.

1216
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,700
Oh, okay.

1217
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,380
Guys, we gotta find the camera first.

1218
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,900
No, it's a different map.

1219
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,360
We can't find anything anymore.

1220
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,060
Oh wait, it's the second map.

1221
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,100
Wait, we cannot find it even if it's like...

1222
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,880
Would it be...

1223
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,400
If we get that same map again, will we be able to find it?

1224
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,220
I don't know.

1225
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,160
The first three?

1226
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,580
Oh, okay.

1227
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,080
So we still have the second map.

1228
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,140
The second day.

1229
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,680
To find it.

1230
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,240
Oh, this is a little spooky.

1231
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,400
Guys, I wish we had something that can let us see the world better.

1232
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh, it's this tabby dude again.

1233
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,420
Oh, it's him!

1234
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,040
He's so lit.

1235
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,640
Hold on, let me flash a peace sign with this.

1236
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,420
He doesn't know yet.

1237
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:19,740
Yeah.

1238
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,160
We're like tourists.

1239
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,240
You know like those like...

1240
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,500
Those guys that wear those long hats in the queen's palace?

1241
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,380
Sorry, the king's palace.

1242
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,200
Oh!

1243
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,660
He's asleep.

1244
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,160
He's asleep.

1245
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:33,600
He's asleep.

1246
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:33,900
He's asleep.

1247
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,480
Who woke him up?

1248
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh no.

1249
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,600
Oh no.

1250
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:37,960
Am I okay?

1251
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:38,420
I'm fine.

1252
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,140
Okay, okay.

1253
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,400
Here.

1254
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,060
Okay.

1255
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,780
Hug.

1256
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,100
Oh my god.

1257
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,960
Where am I?

1258
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,500
Where am I?

1259
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,080
Oh, don't go!

1260
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,600
No, you fell!

1261
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,400
Oh!

1262
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,780
Todd, you need to come down here for hugs!

1263
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,280
Long live the king.

1264
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,060
Oh no!

1265
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,380
Long live the king.

1266
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,080
I swear, I hope somebody stabs you.

1267
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,240
Oh shit!

1268
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1269
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1270
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Hey Ricky, how's it going?

1271
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,280
I need hugs, I need hugs.

1272
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,320
Here, here, here.

1273
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,040
Did you grab it?

1274
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,040
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1275
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,860
We gotta go around.

1276
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,740
Oh shit, okay.

1277
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,120
Oh, you didn't get me, you didn't grab it.

1278
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,100
Oh, hon, no!

1279
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,520
Hon, drop the hugs!

1280
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,500
This way, this way, this way.

1281
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:30,760
Okay.

1282
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,820
Wait, wait, wait.

1283
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,640
Give me the thing.

1284
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:34,720
No!

1285
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,040
No!

1286
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,640
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1287
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,940
Just keep hugging me through the pain.

1288
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,120
Just keep hugging me through the pain.

1289
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,140
Hug me!

1290
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,200
No!

1291
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,400
Hon,

1292
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,320
you gotta drop the thing so I can hug you too!

1293
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,860
I dropped it, I dropped it.

1294
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,620
Where did you drop it?

1295
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,260
Where did you drop it?

1296
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,420
I dropped it back there.

1297
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:00,740
Okay.

1298
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,900
Point it to me, point it to me.

1299
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,260
Oh no.

1300
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:02,980
Oh no.

1301
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,980
Oh, where did you drop it?

1302
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,480
We don't have the thing that can let us see the ground!

1303
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,120
Oh no.

1304
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,860
I got it, I got it, I got it!

1305
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,540
Drop it, Junkie, drop it next to me.

1306
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,800
Okay.

1307
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,760
Oh, shit!

1308
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,200
Oh, shit!

1309
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,340
Oh, shit!

1310
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh, shit!

1311
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,340
Hon, you're live!

1312
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,700
Hon, you're live!

1313
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,240
Okay.

1314
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,060
Okay.

1315
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,140
Keep going, keep going.

1316
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,240
Gotta get out of here.

1317
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,170
I don't like your chances.

1318
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,790
Where did you go?

1319
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:40,570
Where did you go, Hon?

1320
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,250
Where did you go?

1321
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,950
I'm over here, I'm over here, I'm over here!

1322
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,230
I'm lost!

1323
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,670
I'm so lost!

1324
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,650
Hon!

1325
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,850
Follow my voice, follow my voice.

1326
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,350
Hon!

1327
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:54,670
Hon!

1328
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,350
You follow my...

1329
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,050
Hon, Hon, Hon, get over here, get over here!

1330
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:01,330
Okay, okay.

1331
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:01,830
Okay.

1332
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,010
You gotta make sure.

1333
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,130
Okay, okay, okay.

1334
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:05,990
Your turn, your turn.

1335
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,570
This is our only way to live.

1336
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,210
This is our only way to live.

1337
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1338
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,250
What's that?

1339
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,730
I heard... Did you hear that?

1340
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,650
Did you hear that?

1341
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:16,930
That's the monster sound.

1342
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,850
Hon, I don't think...

1343
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,490
Hon, I think we should have...

1344
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,070
Hon, I think we should have bought flashlights.

1345
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,010
We should have bought flashlights.

1346
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,310
Can we?

1347
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,250
Don't worry!

1348
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,610
Don't worry, it's just a snail!

1349
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,650
It's just a snail!

1350
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,710
You can't die from him!

1351
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,610
Don't weep!

1352
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,330
Oh, you should hear about that!

1353
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,130
Okay, hug!

1354
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:37,690
Drop the hug!

1355
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,310
Drop the hug!

1356
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:38,990
I'll hug you!

1357
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,130
Okay.

1358
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:40,810
I dropped the hug.

1359
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:41,690
Okay, here you go.

1360
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:41,970
It's luck.

1361
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,510
Here you go.

1362
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,570
Are you okay now?

1363
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:45,750
Behind us, behind us, behind us.

1364
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:46,530
Hon!

1365
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:48,950
Wait, I hear them!

1366
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:49,650
Guys!

1367
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:50,870
We're lost!

1368
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:52,530
Guys!

1369
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:53,650
Help us!

1370
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:55,650
Help me!

1371
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:57,290
Oh my god!

1372
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:57,850
I'm okay, I'm okay!

1373
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,990
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1374
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,490
You're fine, you're fine.

1375
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,530
I'm being attacked by a straw!

1376
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,890
No, no, no, we're okay!

1377
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,050
I dropped the hug, it's your turn.

1378
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,950
I dropped the hug, it's your turn.

1379
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,030
He can't climb.

1380
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:11,890
I have to go hug him.

1381
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:13,770
Okay, he can't...

1382
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,710
Is that you guys?

1383
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,650
Hey, what's up?

1384
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:18,970
We're gonna die.

1385
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:24,110
We are stuck guys.

1386
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,070
We're sort of stuck.

1387
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:29,490
So if anything happens, remember us for the content.

1388
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,270
I will.

1389
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,770
I think you can get up.

1390
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,090
No, we try.

1391
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,790
We don't know where the exit is.

1392
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:38,430
I'm scared.

1393
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,830
Alright, okay, okay, hon.

1394
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:41,510
Follow me.

1395
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,670
Follow me, hon!

1396
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,490
Okay, we go this way.

1397
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,950
We go this way.

1398
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,330
And then...

1399
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:52,490
This way, this way, this way.

1400
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,890
This way seems like the right way.

1401
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:55,990
Right?

1402
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,170
I'm not a stamina.

1403
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,190
Oh, this seems like the right way.

1404
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:00,970
Maybe...

1405
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,150
Where is...

1406
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,450
I can't see anything.

1407
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,310
I don't know what's following us.

1408
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:06,670
People.

1409
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,110
People is following us.

1410
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:09,970
Where are you?

1411
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,170
What is this thing?

1412
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:12,770
What is it?

1413
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,370
What is it?

1414
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:15,290
I can't tell!

1415
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:16,470
Are you okay?

1416
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,550
I think you're okay.

1417
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,470
I'm gonna go the other way.

1418
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,770
Oh, I hear the bubble.

1419
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,110
I hear the blob.

1420
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,030
Hon, I hear the blob.

1421
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,270
I can't see anything!

1422
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,930
Follow my voice, hon!

1423
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:31,570
Follow my voice!

1424
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,710
I'm right behind you.

1425
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,010
Okay, okay, okay.

1426
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,310
There has to be a way out.

1427
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,810
What the fuck is that?

1428
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,050
Oh, no, that's just a...

1429
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:41,630
Okay.

1430
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,810
Oh, oh, oh.

1431
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,850
I think we're gonna die from the lack of oxygen!

1432
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,250
Jump on my head.

1433
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:52,630
You can do it.

1434
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,550
Okay.

1435
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,670
Oh, no.

1436
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,330
We're never getting out!

1437
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,610
Wait!

1438
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:01,730
Hon, did you...

1439
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,390
Down is up!

1440
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,310
Down is up!

1441
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,250
Hon, I went down!

1442
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,250
Down is up!

1443
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,550
Oh, no.

1444
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,870
Down is always up.

1445
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,090
Oh, one of us will live.

1446
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,350
One of us will live.

1447
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:20,930
Please, God.

1448
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,410
One of us will live.

1449
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:25,970
One of us will live.

1450
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,430
That's all that matters.

1451
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,090
Oh, we're gonna die from the lack of oxygen!

1452
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:33,210
Okay.

1453
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1454
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,630
Down, down is up.

1455
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:38,950
Down is up.

1456
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,310
It's always worked.

1457
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,950
Oh, my God, my philosophy has always been right.

1458
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,690
Oh, my God, am I fucking gonna get out of here?

1459
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,890
Oh, my God, am I fucking gonna get out of here?

1460
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,650
Oh, my God, am I fucking gonna get out of here?

1461
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:51,710
Oh, no.

1462
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,850
I have so little oxygen right now.

1463
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:54,890
Oh, no.

1464
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,890
Oh, no.

1465
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:58,990
Oh, no.

1466
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,970
This relies on time now.

1467
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,710
Oh, no, I'm not gonna make it, guys.

1468
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,790
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1469
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,450
There's so little oxygen.

1470
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,790
Okay.

1471
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:12,590
Okay.

1472
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,570
Oh!

1473
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,360
I have so little oxygen!

1474
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,780
Yeah, we're kinda running out.

1475
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Go to the ship!

1476
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,960
Go to the ship line!

1477
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,560
I figured it out!

1478
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,200
Run to the ship!

1479
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,500
I'm here!

1480
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,260
Help me!

1481
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,700
I'm sorry, Han.

1482
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,920
We don't have time anymore.

1483
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,220
Woo!

1484
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,600
The door!

1485
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,300
It's the door!

1486
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:38,860
I'm gonna find you.

1487
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,520
Oh, no!

1488
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,580
No!

1489
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,420
No!

1490
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,140
I was just there!

1491
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,840
I was just there!

1492
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,140
I thought you didn't have to go up the second flight of stairs.

1493
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,260
You were stuck on the ground.

1494
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,000
I saw the ship in front of me!

1495
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,480
I literally saw the ship!

1496
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,940
Oh, my God!

1497
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,480
Oh, my God!

1498
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:03,560
Oh, my God!

1499
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,440
I was so close!

1500
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,260
That guy killed me like 20 minutes ago!

1501
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,740
Don't kill me!

1502
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,560
Oh, food!

1503
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,380
That was good footage!

1504
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,160
Oh, my God!

1505
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,840
I thought...

1506
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,540
I can't believe it!

1507
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,060
How did you die, Stuffy?

1508
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,500
I got killed by the same thing that killed me!

1509
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:24,960
Oh!

1510
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,540
Oh!

1511
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,460
Han, how did you die, Han?

1512
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,800
Snuffy, please!

1513
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,620
Please stop!

1514
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,000
Snuffy!

1515
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,760
How did you die?

1516
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,980
You died from the lack of air?

1517
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:38,780
Alright, alright.

1518
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,520
I'm trying to focus right now, but for some reason, my body is glitching and breathing in the loudest of my ears.

1519
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,260
Oh, shit!

1520
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,840
Do I still have to go to the hospital if I'm technically on the ship?

1521
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,140
Yeah, you do, because you're fucking dead.

1522
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:51,680
I'm dead.

1523
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,080
I kept on getting kidnapped by a tardigrade.

1524
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,000
It was weird.

1525
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,300
Oh, my God.

1526
00:55:59,540 --> 00:55:59,980
Oh, my God.

1527
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,800
I worked so hard, too!

1528
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,220
I figured...

1529
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,540
I got out of the maze!

1530
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,820
I was floating up and down, right?

1531
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,980
It was vibrating.

1532
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,480
I got like a second of it before the camera ran out of range.

1533
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:12,640
Oh, my God.

1534
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,740
I actually figured out how to get back, and then I got fucking gunned down.

1535
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,820
It was so...

1536
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,200
How did you get back?

1537
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,160
Down is up!

1538
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,360
Down is up!

1539
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,120
You go down and go up!

1540
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,120
Was it...

1541
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,320
Did you get stuck in that place where there's like just a...

1542
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,580
like four corridors?

1543
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,680
We could barely see what was going on.

1544
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,700
We could barely see...

1545
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,420
There was a hole in the floor underneath that stairs.

1546
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,020
Yeah.

1547
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,960
Yeah, I got chased by a spider back there once.

1548
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,540
It was awful.

1549
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,360
There were so many corridors.

1550
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,480
We kept getting lost.

1551
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,740
It's okay.

1552
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,900
We got content, though.

1553
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,220
It's very exciting footage.

1554
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,680
It has to be very good content.

1555
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,560
We use it for like very important situations.

1556
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,020
Yo, is that Doki Bori?

1557
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,240
Let us see the world.

1558
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,080
Look at it again.

1559
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,420
Oh, it's him!

1560
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,240
Let me flash a peace sign with this.

1561
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,480
He doesn't know yet.

1562
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:09,740
Yeah.

1563
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,300
Like those guys that were...

1564
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,120
I think he's asleep.

1565
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,260
Totally asleep.

1566
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,060
He's coming.

1567
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,160
Oh, my God.

1568
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,380
We got 4.5k.

1569
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,660
Fuck.

1570
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,540
We got 4.5k views for that.

1571
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,800
Oh, my God.

1572
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,020
Yeah.

1573
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,180
The views are skyrocketing.

1574
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,240
Bro, it's going up.

1575
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,640
It's only our third...

1576
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,360
fourth day as a content creator.

1577
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,740
Not sure about the phones.

1578
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:41,760
Hey, guys.

1579
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,760
Hey, what's up?

1580
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,040
I'm gonna throw this up to you.

1581
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,800
Oh, snap.

1582
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,520
If anything happens, remember us for the content.

1583
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,060
I think you can get up.

1584
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:53,660
I think you can get up.

1585
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,640
We have to go around the world.

1586
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,280
We tried.

1587
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:58,980
I'm scared.

1588
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,380
15k.

1589
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,640
I think I'm gonna get attacked by bubbles.

1590
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:03,900
16.

1591
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:04,600
Hello?

1592
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,160
Hey, you still having a good time down there?

1593
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,480
Just joking, dad.

1594
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,580
I like your dogs.

1595
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,300
Oh, my God.

1596
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,920
There's like three guys down there.

1597
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,100
There's skedaddling.

1598
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,680
No!

1599
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,400
What the fuck was that?

1600
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:34,280
I don't listen to you.

1601
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,640
I don't listen to you at all.

1602
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,060
Oh, shit.

1603
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,160
The fucking vibrating body.

1604
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:44,640
You were doing that for like the last minute, which is why I was just stood there staring at you.

1605
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,300
Because it was fucking mesmerizing.

1606
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,500
I couldn't hear anything because it was so loud.

1607
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,980
Were you just listening to that?

1608
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:52,620
Yeah.

1609
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,700
It was like, chat was like, one moment he was there and then the next he was gone.

1610
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,300
Like a magic trick.

1611
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,940
Oh my god.

1612
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,140
I hope we can find the camera in the next one.

1613
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm gonna go buy a... wait, you have the hug now, right Lime?

1614
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,100
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we don't need it.

1615
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,140
Oh, okay, I'll hold it.

1616
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,320
We might need a flashlight.

1617
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:23,800
I'm gonna buy us...

1618
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,760
We should get some flashlights though.

1619
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,040
Should we get the long... should we invest on a long flashlight?

1620
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,100
If we stick together, we only need like one good one.

1621
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,860
Yeah, alright, I'll invest on the long flashlight.

1622
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,880
Okay, who has died the least?

1623
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,280
I think Lime has died the least out of all of us.

1624
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,300
That's because I'm a coward.

1625
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,360
I think you should hold the flashlight.

1626
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,280
Sure.

1627
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,920
That's like $200 worth of...

1628
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,160
Oh my god.

1629
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,740
Hey, it's not about... It's so big.

1630
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,280
It's not about the size, it's how you use it.

1631
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,680
It's about the ocean of the motion... It's about the motion of the ocean.

1632
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:05,660
What?

1633
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,400
Is that how it goes?

1634
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,940
About flashlights?

1635
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,880
I've never heard that in my life.

1636
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,680
What is Snuffy getting?

1637
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,140
Is she getting water or food?

1638
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,320
Or bathroom?

1639
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,960
She said beverage, so I'm assuming maybe water, but maybe alcohol.

1640
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,340
Oh my god, what?

1641
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,480
Maybe alcohol... She needs to cope right now.

1642
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,220
Oh shit, wait, we should film this.

1643
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:35,940
We should...

1644
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,120
Who has the camera?

1645
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,100
Like, knock you down?

1646
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1647
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,840
Oh my god.

1648
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,880
Wrong person.

1649
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,060
Oh my god.

1650
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:51,840
Down with Snuffy.

1651
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,440
Oh my god, I can't even hit her.

1652
01:00:59,020 --> 01:00:59,500
Holy!

1653
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,020
You took her out!

1654
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:03,840
Oh my gosh.

1655
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,400
I'm practicing right now.

1656
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,440
I'm practicing my karate.

1657
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,360
Watch this.

1658
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,520
It's like Karate Kid.

1659
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,400
You're joking from the top rope.

1660
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,420
Alright, ready?

1661
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,220
I'm gonna stand up here.

1662
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,060
Do it.

1663
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,900
Alright, 3, 2, 1.

1664
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:20,100
Did I miss?

1665
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,880
You kinda like, clipped the top of her head.

1666
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,320
Okay, wait, wait.

1667
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,920
I'm practicing.

1668
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,680
I'm practicing for the real deal.

1669
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,160
Oh!

1670
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,620
I almost pinned her down!

1671
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,180
You try.

1672
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,340
Alright, alright.

1673
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,280
Alright, let me...

1674
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,640
Push her closer to the rock.

1675
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,940
Oh, here you go.

1676
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,220
Oh!

1677
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,440
Oh my god!

1678
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,200
It's like you're used to this.

1679
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,760
You have...

1680
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,300
Clearly have so much practice.

1681
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,360
It's our synergy.

1682
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,560
We just love knocking each other to the floor.

1683
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,380
Oh, shit.

1684
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:57,720
I'm like, sure.

1685
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,580
What happened to the synergy?

1686
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,400
What happened?

1687
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,780
It's fine.

1688
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,380
Don't worry about it.

1689
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:01,820
Don't worry about it.

1690
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,100
Just practice.

1691
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,200
It's foreplay.

1692
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,840
It's foreplay?

1693
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,200
Oh no!

1694
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:06,440
I keep stopping!

1695
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,320
Wait, what's going on?

1696
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,740
What's going on?

1697
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,040
Your synergy is going away!

1698
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,280
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

1699
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,020
Sometimes when lots of people are watching, it's harder, okay?

1700
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:17,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1701
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,520
The performance anxiety.

1702
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,000
Oh!

1703
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,700
It's a clip!

1704
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,220
What?

1705
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,460
Nothing.

1706
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,780
Hey, Sophie, welcome back.

1707
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,360
I just sat down.

1708
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,720
What the fuck?

1709
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,980
You woke up.

1710
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,840
We're making Honda Voyeur.

1711
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,600
Whoa!

1712
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,740
We're like friends!

1713
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,900
We're making content!

1714
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,360
Which site are we uploading to?

1715
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:44,980
Don't...

1716
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,280
Don't worry.

1717
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,920
You'll find out soon.

1718
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,120
We have 76% film left.

1719
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,380
He is a professional.

1720
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,780
Hey, I hope it's that map that I died on so we can get back the other camera.

1721
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,480
We need our other camera.

1722
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,020
It's a merge.

1723
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,560
It's called Submerging.

1724
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,280
It's just Submerging.

1725
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,540
What'd you call it?

1726
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,360
Whoa!

1727
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,540
Oh no, it's another map!

1728
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,300
No!

1729
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:18,520
No, this is the lower floor on the same map, I think.

1730
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,580
Oh, on the same map.

1731
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,020
Last map?

1732
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:21,740
Yeah.

1733
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:22,340
Oh.

1734
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:23,800
This is where we got stuck.

1735
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,460
This flashlight's weird.

1736
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,900
It illuminates really far away and not so much up close.

1737
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:27,640
That's weird.

1738
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,160
Oh yeah, you've got like a very nice cone shape.

1739
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,700
It's like I turned up the field of view really fucking high.

1740
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,820
Don't worry.

1741
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,640
I got my hug ready.

1742
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,360
Is that your hole?

1743
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:38,720
Is that our hole?

1744
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,260
Oh yeah, this is your hole!

1745
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:40,720
That's where we died!

1746
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,860
We found your hole.

1747
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:43,440
It was made for me.

1748
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,160
It was made for us.

1749
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,840
This was the hole.

1750
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:50,500
Okay, how I figured out to go upstairs is we have to go down.

1751
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,640
And then...

1752
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,720
What's that?

1753
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,580
What's that over there?

1754
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,280
Do you see that?

1755
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,060
It's the ship.

1756
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:56,420
Oh.

1757
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,300
It looks like it has 20 eyes!

1758
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,740
Oh my god!

1759
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,240
I can't believe it!

1760
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:10,840
A ship!

1761
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,540
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1762
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,140
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1763
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,680
I lagged out here.

1764
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,060
Oh yeah, if you go down you can go up.

1765
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,560
Oh, this is where I threw myself down when I was being chased by a spider.

1766
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,420
Oh wait, this was not the same down I found.

1767
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,660
There should be monsters down here.

1768
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,600
You can get up from here.

1769
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:31,660
What's that?

1770
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:32,940
That's a monster.

1771
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,220
It's a hole.

1772
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,320
That's like the...

1773
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,700
You should put your face on the pounder, Snuffy.

1774
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,340
Yeah, you won't get pounded.

1775
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,980
Touch the pounder.

1776
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:44,900
There you go.

1777
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,360
Are you getting healed?

1778
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,640
Oh, thank you!

1779
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:48,860
Thank you!

1780
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,000
That was good.

1781
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:50,760
Don't worry.

1782
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:51,800
Oh, nice.

1783
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,440
Thank you.

1784
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,060
Are you full HP?

1785
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:53,780
I was working.

1786
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,520
What about this?

1787
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,900
Will this grind my bones too?

1788
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:56,620
No?

1789
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,460
No, it won't.

1790
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,180
You should touch it.

1791
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,580
Okay.

1792
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,280
Are you not going to test the theory?

1793
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,620
I got to do it for the...

1794
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,020
You're not going to get myth busted?

1795
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,400
What's the myth?

1796
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,620
The myth is that will it grind your bones?

1797
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:12,900
Will it?

1798
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,280
I tried!

1799
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:13,840
I tried!

1800
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:14,340
I'm alone!

1801
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,660
What the... Are you losing HP for that?

1802
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:20,480
Wait, what about this thing?

1803
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,020
Did you...

1804
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:21,160
No!

1805
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,060
I'm like immune to it!

1806
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,660
Wait, you are?

1807
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,420
Oh my god, you are!

1808
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:27,860
Wait!

1809
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,980
Oh my god, myth busted!

1810
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,480
Yeah, I'm okay!

1811
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:34,840
Myth busted!

1812
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,060
You're getting like, faintly!

1813
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,320
Are you guys just getting pounded or something?

1814
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,080
No, no, we're busting myths right now.

1815
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:43,800
We're trying to fight that.

1816
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,320
We're busting myths!

1817
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,340
We're both thinking grind it up.

1818
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,800
Yeah, yeah, we want to know if we can survive it, if we're invincible.

1819
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,920
There's a monster back here, by the way.

1820
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:51,940
Oh yeah, did you film it?

1821
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:52,800
Where is it?

1822
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,480
Uh, it disappeared because I shined light on it.

1823
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,960
Oh, is it what...

1824
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,560
It's just the dick pistons again.

1825
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,540
It's this way.

1826
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,240
What?

1827
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,120
What?

1828
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:02,880
All right.

1829
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,820
Did any of us get touched by that monster for content?

1830
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,560
No, it's the one that ate your ass on the first map.

1831
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,800
Oh, that guy!

1832
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,840
Oh, that him!

1833
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1834
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,040
All right, I'm going to get shanked by him.

1835
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,680
Oh no, it's the tommy!

1836
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,700
Hello, today I'm going to show...

1837
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:18,940
It's the tommy!

1838
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,040
Welcome to London!

1839
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,580
Welcome to London!

1840
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:26,520
It's the tommy!

1841
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:26,840
World star!

1842
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,880
World star!

1843
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,240
No, no, no, stop it!

1844
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,480
No, no, stop it!

1845
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:31,820
No!

1846
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,780
We gotta get out of here.

1847
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,680
Okay, so, yeah.

1848
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,620
Oh my god, it's...

1849
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,500
Oh my god, I'm here.

1850
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,060
I'll hug you!

1851
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:37,520
I'll hug you.

1852
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,380
Here you go.

1853
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:38,720
Are you...

1854
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,240
Oh shit!

1855
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,540
Who's gonna hug me?

1856
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:41,820
World star!

1857
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,960
Oh my god, he's right behind us.

1858
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,740
Ay ay ay ay.

1859
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:50,320
I'm gonna hug you for a co- I'm gonna hug you- don't worry, I'm hugging you through the- through the pain!

1860
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,740
Are you still getting sad?

1861
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,220
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.

1862
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,400
Don't worry, I can hug you through the sad things!

1863
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:55,600
Oh!

1864
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,520
Who's gonna hug me?!

1865
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,180
Oh!

1866
01:06:58,700 --> 01:06:59,020
Fuck!

1867
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,100
Hug!

1868
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:01,700
Hug me!

1869
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,500
I'm one inch me!

1870
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,160
I'M ONE INCH ME!

1871
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,560
What's up?

1872
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,700
Um, are they dead?

1873
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:08,420
Should we leave?

1874
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,220
No!

1875
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,120
Grab the hugs!

1876
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,300
Grab the hugs!

1877
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:18,900
No!

1878
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:18,900
Are they dead?

1879
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:18,900
Should we leave?

1880
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,140
No!

1881
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:20,860
No!

1882
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,520
No!

1883
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,360
One's dead.

1884
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,120
Who's gonna hug me?

1885
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,500
I'm never gonna be the hugger again.

1886
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,580
The hugger never gets hugged.

1887
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,140
Hello?

1888
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,620
The hugger never gets hugged!

1889
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:38,780
Hello?

1890
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,260
What's the point?

1891
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,760
Did you die?

1892
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,600
I died.

1893
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,580
I died for the content.

1894
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,940
I died for the content.

1895
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,020
Hello?

1896
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,100
I died for the content, for the extra views.

1897
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,780
The hugging arc is over.

1898
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:59,080
No longer will I provide comfort for people with trauma.

1899
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,540
I'll never give- I'll never have physical touch for people with trauma.

1900
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,240
I'll never touch ever again.

1901
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,540
I'll be a bubble child.

1902
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,000
I'll be in my little bubble.

1903
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:14,740
I'll be in my little bubble.

1904
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,440
No touchy.

1905
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,780
I am the sole survivor.

1906
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,800
This expedition.

1907
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,960
If you see this footage, make sure to like and subscribe.

1908
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,200
There has to be more people still alive!

1909
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,280
No one else is in that voice!

1910
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,620
Where are the others?

1911
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,560
I don't know where the camera is.

1912
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,360
I think he died.

1913
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,340
We might have to go back there.

1914
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,680
Do they know Han lived?

1915
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,160
He lived.

1916
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,300
Wait they're here!

1917
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:39,620
They're here!

1918
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,020
They're alive!

1919
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,560
They're alive?

1920
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,140
You're in the ship already.

1921
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,840
How the fuck does she know?

1922
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,180
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1923
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,060
Just get to the ship.

1924
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,300
I saw the guy here.

1925
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:49,100
The stabby guy though.

1926
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:49,920
He was around the corner.

1927
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,360
How did you know?

1928
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,680
Hey what's up?

1929
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,500
Hey never mind.

1930
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,000
Ahhhh!

1931
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,040
Ahhhh!

1932
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:00,420
Ahhhh!

1933
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,120
We need to leave this.

1934
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,040
We need to leave this.

1935
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:03,440
We need to leave this.

1936
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,600
I can't stop!

1937
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,880
Okay I'm taking over this.

1938
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,540
This is the game.

1939
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,160
Guys!

1940
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:15,780
Guys!

1941
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:18,960
Bro!

1942
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,800
Bro!

1943
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,260
Snuffy!

1944
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:21,900
Bro!

1945
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,520
I

1946
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,600
didn't think they got it on the video!

1947
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,660
I was spectating you!

1948
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,800
Dude she fell!

1949
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,480
She fucking slipped and fell.

1950
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,360
She fucking slipped and fell.

1951
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,720
Oh my god.

1952
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,200
That was really humbling.

1953
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,360
We got the content.

1954
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,580
We got it.

1955
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,340
We also don't...

1956
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,060
I am not the hugger anymore.

1957
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,880
I refuse to hug anymore.

1958
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,560
No one ever hugs the hugger.

1959
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:57,740
No one ever hugs the hugger.

1960
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,940
Emotional damage.

1961
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:03,880
What the hell is this?

1962
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,820
What the hell is this?

1963
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,200
We are practicing for a big debut.

1964
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,940
We are practicing for a big debut.

1965
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,080
That apple looks tasty.

1966
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,100
Touch the smell...

1967
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:30,840
Touch the pounder.

1968
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,880
There is the scary guy that disappears and reappears.

1969
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,680
There is the scary guy that disappears and reappears.

1970
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,740
Oh, that... oh no!

1971
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,300
That's the shaker!

1972
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,740
It's the top, Eric!

1973
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,250
World star!

1974
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,670
World star!

1975
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,650
World star!

1976
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,150
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1977
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:06,990
This guy's a freak.

1978
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,410
Wait, where did he come from?

1979
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:11,390
It's a monster mash.

1980
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,270
That was another one.

1981
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,510
That was so... you had like three monsters on you.

1982
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,310
I didn't realize the other guy was there.

1983
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:19,990
This is the survivor.

1984
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:20,610
This is Expedition.

1985
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:23,490
If you see this footage, make sure to like and subscribe.

1986
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,230
Who knows what will happen.

1987
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,050
Just cut off before Snuffy died.

1988
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,310
No.

1989
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,770
I think I ran out of footage there.

1990
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:41,510
The moment she slipped, it was never caught on tape.

1991
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,730
I think the beginning was worth it.

1992
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,910
The beginning...

1993
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:49,730
That's okay.

1994
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:54,290
That means we can like use our third tape for the next one.

1995
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,190
Because we hit our quota.

1996
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,330
We can save the next footage.

1997
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,350
Min-max.

1998
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,330
Min-maxing time.

1999
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:02,590
So we need to like take a day off?

2000
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:07,330
No, we can like film it and then we get the footage for the next day.

2001
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,010
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

2002
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:15,010
I hope this game gets updated and not left to die like Palworld.

2003
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,710
That's all I want.

2004
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,730
I hope this game gets freaking content.

2005
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,910
Alright.

2006
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,350
Someone buy the hug.

2007
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:28,770
Because like I'm not the hugger anymore.

2008
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,010
I wish for it.

2009
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,850
Or we could go for water.

2010
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,150
We can either hug or I can do a backflip.

2011
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:37,130
It's up to you.

2012
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:38,490
You know what?

2013
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:39,350
I think the...

2014
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,510
I think the backflip would be so fucking cool though.

2015
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,890
Imagine the content.

2016
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,470
Especially if it's for content.

2017
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,570
This is like a free game.

2018
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,550
This is dedicated for content.

2019
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:50,870
So we should definitely just buy that thing.

2020
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:51,630
I'm sure you'll do it perfectly.

2021
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2022
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,070
Me too.

2023
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:53,790
I'm sure it'll be...

2024
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:56,450
I'm sure that $400 would be worth it.

2025
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,110
Alright, I'm gonna...

2026
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,470
We still afford the hug.

2027
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:00,450
What?

2028
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,370
We still afford it.

2029
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:02,590
Alright.

2030
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,550
Show us the backflip.

2031
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,390
How do I do it?

2032
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:07,670
It's T.

2033
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:14,230
Press T.

2034
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:14,910
Wait.

2035
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:15,890
Oh.

2036
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,220
I landed really close to the ground.

2037
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,240
I didn't know what happened there.

2038
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,540
You know, for a first try, that's pretty good, you know?

2039
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,380
The first try.

2040
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:32,940
I think I'm good.

2041
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:33,360
I'll figure...

2042
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,500
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2043
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,220
I think I'm doing it.

2044
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,180
I've never seen a backflip.

2045
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,200
I just read it in a book.

2046
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,860
Anybody wanna be the hugger?

2047
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:40,480
No.

2048
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,460
That was...

2049
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:41,560
That was not me.

2050
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,460
I can do both.

2051
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:43,060
No.

2052
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,200
I'm gonna be the in-flip.

2053
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,020
Oh my god.

2054
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,580
You try it.

2055
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:45,880
Try it.

2056
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,380
Oh my god.

2057
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,580
The perfect hug.

2058
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:50,460
Alright.

2059
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,700
I'm getting submerging now.

2060
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,860
We're submerging.

2061
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,060
Alright.

2062
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,720
Here we go.

2063
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,140
Oh, we're back here.

2064
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:05,360
I knew I would.

2065
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,700
This was worth the money.

2066
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,260
Yeah.

2067
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,080
The $300.

2068
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,400
Oh, yeah.

2069
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:21,640
Dude.

2070
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,660
Did you guys know you can lead the monster to fall to its death?

2071
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,940
Just try and do that and get a clip.

2072
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,080
You find a monster and then lead him to the ship and then watch him...

2073
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,240
Oh!

2074
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:34,840
And then...

2075
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,040
Sorry.

2076
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,240
Watch him die.

2077
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:39,660
Monster.

2078
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:41,580
Monster.

2079
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:42,720
Monster.

2080
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:43,340
Monster.

2081
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,400
Monster.

2082
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:44,740
Monster.

2083
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,160
Monster.

2084
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:47,920
Monster.

2085
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,260
Monster.

2086
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:49,340
Monster.

2087
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,620
Monster.

2088
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:52,760
Alright.

2089
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,340
I'm heading up.

2090
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,480
I'm going up.

2091
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:00,680
One small step for mankind.

2092
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,100
Alright.

2093
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,040
Hello monster.

2094
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:06,760
Monster.

2095
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,160
Monster, I have no flashlight.

2096
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,820
I have no idea where I'm going.

2097
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:12,480
Oh, monster.

2098
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:15,500
Monster.

2099
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,460
Oh, I found a rib cage.

2100
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,580
Rib cage.

2101
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,700
Look at this.

2102
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,620
This is what's gonna happen to you if you don't like this.

2103
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,720
If you don't like this, then like and subscribe to our channel.

2104
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:24,600
Nice.

2105
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:24,900
Okay.

2106
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:26,580
Where is Lyman?

2107
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,040
Oh my god!

2108
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,260
There's another rib cage!

2109
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,040
Double rib cage.

2110
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,360
Those are the two people that didn't like and subscribe.

2111
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,740
That's what happens when you don't click the bell button.

2112
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,160
Yeah.

2113
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,640
This is what happens when you don't click it.

2114
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,840
Just remember...

2115
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,060
Wait.

2116
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,280
Where are we going?

2117
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,360
Are you guys parkouring?

2118
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:49,540
I don't know.

2119
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:50,300
I think we should split around in a circle.

2120
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,600
Why don't you guys just...

2121
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:52,900
I don't know.

2122
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,240
Oh, wait.

2123
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,300
This is how I got lost.

2124
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:54,620
Yeah.

2125
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,820
Let's go back to where we were.

2126
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:57,340
Wait.

2127
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:57,540
No.

2128
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,480
We went down, didn't we?

2129
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,780
We went up, didn't we?

2130
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,160
Yeah.

2131
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,020
There's no ship on the way.

2132
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,160
We went up and if we go down, we go back to the ship.

2133
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:03,180
Oh, yeah.

2134
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:03,640
This is where we...

2135
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:03,760
Yeah.

2136
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,100
Yeah.

2137
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:04,240
Yeah.

2138
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,240
We have to go this way.

2139
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:05,460
Yeah.

2140
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:05,640
Yeah.

2141
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,540
I forgot which way I went.

2142
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,520
Things are blurring together.

2143
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,440
I'm surprised we haven't seen a creature.

2144
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,300
Me too.

2145
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:14,620
A creature!

2146
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,620
Hopefully we don't jinx ourselves.

2147
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:17,760
A creature!

2148
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,240
We wanna...

2149
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,580
We wanna use you for comfort.

2150
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,260
A content creature.

2151
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,760
I miss my sound more already.

2152
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,160
Content creature.

2153
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:26,900
Come here.

2154
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,660
What are you doing?

2155
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,420
Let us...

2156
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,660
Oh, you mean the one that we had in game?

2157
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,300
Yeah.

2158
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,360
Let us manipulate you into being a content slave.

2159
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:35,800
Oh.

2160
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:35,820
Wait.

2161
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:36,120
Wait.

2162
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:36,600
I hear...

2163
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,420
I hear London!

2164
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,900
There's something behind us.

2165
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,740
I hear London!

2166
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:40,880
It's giggling.

2167
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,380
It's the London kid!

2168
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,280
London?

2169
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,500
Oh my god.

2170
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:45,920
Where is he?

2171
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:46,860
Where is the audio coming from?

2172
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:47,800
Where is he?

2173
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,740
He might be in our videos.

2174
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,500
He's a fan.

2175
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,580
I think he is above us.

2176
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:51,900
Yeah.

2177
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,460
He's stream sniping.

2178
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,920
He's stream sniping.

2179
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,600
We're doing IRL and he's trying to stream snipe us.

2180
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,960
Let's go investigate.

2181
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,520
I think you guys will be seeing him very soon.

2182
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,760
Oh my god.

2183
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,920
Guys, he just wants to be on our stream.

2184
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,360
He watches our channel.

2185
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,680
Oh, here he is!

2186
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:10,680
Oh, is that him?

2187
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,040
Oh!

2188
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:11,820
Shit!

2189
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Who did he shake?

2190
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,940
Oh my god!

2191
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:15,560
He's shaking!

2192
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,940
In the corner!

2193
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,600
He knows where the cameraman is!

2194
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,580
Oh, he's shaking!

2195
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,160
He wants all the screen time.

2196
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,560
Oh my god.

2197
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,500
Who has the hug?

2198
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,380
Backflip and hug him!

2199
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:29,800
Who's the hug him?

2200
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,420
Yeah, he's supposed to hug him!

2201
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,440
Oh my god.

2202
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,260
Where?

2203
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:33,960
You got it?

2204
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:34,260
Oh!

2205
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:34,880
There's two!

2206
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,420
There's two stream snipers!

2207
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,920
Oh my god.

2208
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,720
They can jump up.

2209
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,460
They can jump up.

2210
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:43,800
They can?

2211
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:44,640
No, they can't.

2212
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,140
Yes, they can!

2213
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:45,960
I've seen it!

2214
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:46,740
No, no, no, no!

2215
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,200
Come on, we're gonna hug you!

2216
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,160
Help!

2217
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,380
Wait, where's our cameraman?

2218
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:53,120
Oh, he's in the corner.

2219
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:54,140
Guys?

2220
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,540
Jesus Christ!

2221
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,540
I've got the camera!

2222
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,160
I've got the camera!

2223
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:57,840
Wait, is he dead?

2224
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,560
Yeah, he did.

2225
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,240
Oh, he's dead.

2226
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:00,560
He definitely died.

2227
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:02,540
He...he...he hella dead!

2228
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,380
Thank you for the cuddling.

2229
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:03,880
Yeah, ...dead.

2230
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:04,640
Oh fuck!

2231
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,260
He got...he got stream sniped man!

2232
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:07,940
Well, I'm loaded.

2233
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:08,440
Oh God!

2234
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,480
What are you guys doing?

2235
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,920
Here, um...somebody hold me.

2236
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,220
Okay, don't worry.

2237
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,080
Somebody hug you?

2238
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:16,920
Okay, where is it?

2239
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,240
Where is it?

2240
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,780
It's right here.

2241
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,540
Where is it?

2242
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,200
Oh, it's here, okay.

2243
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:21,880
It's right where I got you.

2244
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:22,820
Okay.

2245
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,940
Let me know when you feel okay now.

2246
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,680
Let me know.

2247
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,460
I got 28% film loss.

2248
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:30,120
That's enough.

2249
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,760
Let me know when you feel okay.

2250
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,420
Let me know.

2251
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,280
Let me know.

2252
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:37,980
Don't worry, I'm here for you.

2253
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:43,850
Okay.

2254
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:49,170
We got... I feel like let's start slowly head back to our ship because you have 28, right?

2255
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,610
Okay.

2256
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:50,190
Yeah.

2257
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:50,610
Yeah.

2258
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:50,730
Yeah.

2259
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,350
You can maybe get something on the way.

2260
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:54,190
Yeah, might as well just head back.

2261
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,270
Turtle guy went back.

2262
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,330
He went up the stairs.

2263
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,630
Yeah, don't worry.

2264
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,930
He realized there's no more... Oh, no.

2265
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,150
They both went to the ramp, I think.

2266
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:00,450
Yeah.

2267
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:02,590
There's no more screen time for that guy.

2268
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:09,390
Guys, I feel like not having a flashlight was not a great idea.

2269
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:12,150
I have one, but I also have the camera.

2270
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:12,950
Does someone want the camera?

2271
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,470
Oh, wait.

2272
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:14,370
I can hold the flashlight.

2273
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,610
Is this our expensive one?

2274
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:18,370
It's a skedaddler!

2275
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:20,070
Skedaddler?

2276
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:20,870
Around the corner.

2277
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,370
Oh, my God.

2278
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:24,610
Okay, okay, okay.

2279
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:25,830
Wait, back up, back up!

2280
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,420
Sick, though?

2281
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,500
It's so sick!

2282
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,360
It's so sick!

2283
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,140
Oh, my God, you're going off!

2284
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,660
Sophie, no!

2285
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,880
Okay, we have to get out before she hits the bottom because if she hits the bottom, she crashes the game.

2286
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:46,740
What?

2287
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:57,000
I had a friend fall off, and she was, like, running faster and faster and further away because I was watching her progress on the ship.

2288
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,380
And then when she got a certain distance away, the game just crashed.

2289
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,040
Oh, shit!

2290
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:02,100
That's a flammable!

2291
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,180
I'm okay!

2292
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,020
I'm running!

2293
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:09,600
I'm running!

2294
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,340
Are you still okay?

2295
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,490
Guys, I don't think she's so okay anymore.

2296
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,070
Guys, I don't think she's still okay.

2297
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:39,130
Guys?

2298
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,430
Where the fuck is the camera?

2299
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,370
Oh, my God, the camera's right there!

2300
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:56,170
No!

2301
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,600
Guys, if I get picked up, I die!

2302
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,000
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2303
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:14,860
No!

2304
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:23,630
No!

2305
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,170
No!

2306
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:31,770
We're so close!

2307
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,010
We're so close!

2308
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:37,710
I got... he picked me up!

2309
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:39,890
No!

2310
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,370
The captain!

2311
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:44,630
It was a really good try.

2312
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:46,390
Do you think we can find that?

2313
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,090
It should be like right there, right?

2314
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:51,010
No, this is the last... I like how...

2315
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:51,930
No!

2316
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:55,470
We keep losing our camera on the last day.

2317
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:57,970
I was like, are you okay?

2318
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:59,170
And you're like, I think I'm okay.

2319
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,170
And then I'm like, where did she go?

2320
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:05,030
Yeah, he just immediately grabbed me again and tossed me around.

2321
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,310
It was like impossible to get away.

2322
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:09,670
Oh my god.

2323
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,110
Did I fall off the cliff with the turtle?

2324
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:13,510
Yeah, you did!

2325
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:14,130
We did!

2326
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,890
Did we watch you fall off?

2327
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:21,310
Oh my god.

2328
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,610
You're like, I'm okay!

2329
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,170
I'm okay!

2330
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:26,690
And then we watch you slowly fall off the cliff.

2331
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:26,930
It's on the building!

2332
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:32,210
Oh my god, it's okay.

2333
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:35,650
We can get a hundred and... we don't need those extra... oh my god, are you okay?

2334
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,250
We don't need those extra 128!

2335
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:38,770
I flipped!

2336
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:39,390
Wait a sec!

2337
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,810
This was so worth it.

2338
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,690
Another day of content.

2339
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,530
The grind never stops guys.

2340
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,630
I'm feeling good about today.

2341
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,050
We lost a couple days, but I'm excited.

2342
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,830
I think I feel so good too.

2343
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,090
Don't worry guys.

2344
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:54,890
I have the camera.

2345
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,690
We don't even need flashlights.

2346
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:56,070
Whatever.

2347
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:04,430
We're doing our backflip, it's good content.

2348
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:05,770
It's extra content.

2349
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,790
Yeah.

2350
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,910
That was fucking sick, man.

2351
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:13,030
I wish you guys saw it.

2352
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,430
I like your popper.

2353
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:17,810
Are we good?

2354
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:21,550
I feel like one of those kids that just learned how to flip in school and they just keep doing it.

2355
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:28,230
Yeah, but I don't think you learned it yet after 20 years of backflip.

2356
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,150
Alright, we're ready.

2357
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,470
Are you ready guys?

2358
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,310
I'm so freaking ready.

2359
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:41,090
Oh hey, it's the first map.

2360
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,230
Wait, can we find our other camera?

2361
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,230
I landed it that time.

2362
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,070
No, it might despawn at the end of a section.

2363
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:51,150
Oh, it despawns after the end of the...

2364
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:55,310
I would think so, but it would be nice to be wrong.

2365
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:58,950
Chat, it's time for you guys to backseat.

2366
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:00,170
Does it despawn after?

2367
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:07,230
For all the content creators out there who are trying to make content.

2368
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,890
Does it despawn?

2369
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:17,870
Guys, any backseaters in Snuffy's channel, you're welcome here.

2370
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,090
Come back to my channel.

2371
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:20,450
Backseaters are allowed.

2372
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:26,430
Backseaters come to my channel, Doki Bird!

2373
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:32,010
Alright.

2374
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,530
Let's see.

2375
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:40,000
Wait, what?

2376
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,180
What is that sound?

2377
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,460
Oh my god!

2378
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,690
Oh my god, right now!

2379
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:53,370
Hey, where did he go?

2380
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:53,930
I'm scared.

2381
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:55,190
I don't know where he went.

2382
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:55,550
He flipped off.

2383
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,030
Oh, he fell over.

2384
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:57,750
He fell over.

2385
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:58,350
Oh, he's over there!

2386
01:24:58,370 --> 01:24:58,810
He's over there!

2387
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,330
I see him!

2388
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:00,690
He's running.

2389
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,770
Watch me do a backflip.

2390
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,090
Yay!

2391
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:09,010
Alright, nice.

2392
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:09,750
I think we're okay.

2393
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:12,770
Alright, where do we go now?

2394
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:13,310
He's coming back.

2395
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:13,430
He's leaving.

2396
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:14,330
He's leaving.

2397
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:15,630
We don't have any hugs.

2398
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,370
We're broke right now.

2399
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:18,070
Nope.

2400
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:18,950
He's coming back.

2401
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:22,050
We're like one of those channels that's wasted all their money.

2402
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:22,630
Fight me.

2403
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:24,450
For one thing.

2404
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:26,130
That's right, buddy.

2405
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:26,990
Motto, motto.

2406
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:28,310
Fist to fist.

2407
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,030
Oh my god, guys.

2408
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,650
There's a fight that's about to happen.

2409
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,100
Guys, I'm 1 HP!

2410
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,800
Guys, I'm 1 HP!

2411
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,560
I'm 1 HP.

2412
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,400
I got hit.

2413
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:48,760
I got hit.

2414
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,880
Wait, there's a spider right there.

2415
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,700
There's a spider too?

2416
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,180
Oh my god.

2417
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,740
Today's not a good day, guys.

2418
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,620
Today's not a good day!

2419
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,700
Hey guys.

2420
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,780
There's a spider by the way.

2421
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:07,960
Yeah, I can see.

2422
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:14,440
Did Han die again?

2423
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,780
Did Han wait someone else to get him?

2424
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:17,000
I'm pretty sure.

2425
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,240
I kinda do want that though.

2426
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,160
We could check the ship.

2427
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,360
There's something up there.

2428
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,000
There's something up there.

2429
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,740
There's something at the exit.

2430
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,880
Guys, wouldn't it be funny if there's something in front?

2431
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,160
Holy crap.

2432
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,680
Holy shit!

2433
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,620
Oh shit!

2434
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,060
You should have destroyed it.

2435
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,400
I got fucking slapped.

2436
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,020
What the fuck is that?

2437
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,900
Did you guys get the camera?

2438
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,200
Did she get the camera?

2439
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,480
No, it's right there on the stairs.

2440
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:45,460
Oh no.

2441
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:45,780
Oh no!

2442
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,620
Oh my god!

2443
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,340
Holy moly.

2444
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,760
That hurts so fucking bad.

2445
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:53,380
Oh my god.

2446
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,160
It's fucking...

2447
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,400
James, stop it.

2448
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:55,720
Oh my god.

2449
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,740
I ran out of sprints so I couldn't get away.

2450
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,280
Holy shit.

2451
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:04,780
I like how Snuffy ran backwards instead of forward.

2452
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,080
You guys could have split up and one of you made it to the ship.

2453
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:12,820
Oh, it's right in front of her.

2454
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,520
It's right in front of her.

2455
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,940
I don't know if she can outrun it.

2456
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,200
There's a spider too.

2457
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,000
Can she outrun it?

2458
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,360
Holy shit.

2459
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,180
He's so fast.

2460
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,620
He's so fucking smart.

2461
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:24,880
You smart asses.

2462
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,120
You smart asses.

2463
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:25,660
You smart asses.

2464
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:26,100
The gamers!

2465
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,360
What the fuck is this?

2466
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:31,380
No!

2467
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,000
No!

2468
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:35,540
No!

2469
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:36,020
No!

2470
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,360
It's okay.

2471
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,660
We can grab the camera back.

2472
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,080
We can grab it back.

2473
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:44,840
I don't know what to do.

2474
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,780
Oh my god.

2475
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,320
What's going on?

2476
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,840
Why are they all trying to...

2477
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,440
The giant was so fucking fast.

2478
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,300
I ran out of stamina and couldn't get away.

2479
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,640
Oh my god.

2480
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,920
Yeah, I didn't know what to do.

2481
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,640
I didn't think I could outrun either of them.

2482
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,580
That was so scary.

2483
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,320
That was so fucked up.

2484
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:02,780
It was so...

2485
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,300
Don't tell me, but that was like way different.

2486
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:07,400
The other ones are like silly and that thing like...

2487
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,540
Yeah, that thing was...

2488
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:10,480
That thing two shot me.

2489
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,020
Bro...

2490
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:12,180
It fell after I...

2491
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,340
I was already 1 HP.

2492
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:19,440
And killed her instantly and it almost fell down the stairs and then it just stared at me.

2493
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:20,720
Bro,

2494
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,640
there was no way I was gonna survive.

2495
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:26,220
I didn't know how to live through that.

2496
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,660
I knew I was fucked.

2497
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,960
I knew.

2498
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,740
You guys were like, there's somebody in front of you.

2499
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,340
I was like, I knew it was over.

2500
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,300
It was so over.

2501
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,420
It's okay.

2502
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,560
We're on day one so we can grab our stuff back.

2503
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,360
Oh, I hope so.

2504
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,200
I really hope so.

2505
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:43,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2506
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,440
I'm gonna go find the other camera.

2507
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:46,940
All right.

2508
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,060
We have nothing to buy because we're broke as fuck.

2509
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,500
Let's go.

2510
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:53,940
I just look at all.

2511
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,440
We're broke this time.

2512
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:55,820
Don't worry.

2513
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,860
This is the best thing.

2514
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:57,900
Goodbye.

2515
01:28:59,180 --> 01:28:59,680
Click quick.

2516
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,560
Press the button.

2517
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:01,480
Press the button.

2518
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:05,540
All right.

2519
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:05,920
I knew.

2520
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,220
Don't worry.

2521
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:08,980
I'll find the camera.

2522
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:12,860
All right.

2523
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,320
Don't worry, guys.

2524
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:16,300
I'll find the camera.

2525
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:17,680
Wait, is this new?

2526
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,320
No.

2527
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:20,560
No.

2528
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:20,780
Okay.

2529
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,940
The camera should be somewhere around here.

2530
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:23,540
There it is.

2531
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,200
What is it?

2532
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,000
Should I just take it back to the ship?

2533
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:25,580
Yeah, yeah.

2534
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:25,640
Yeah.

2535
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:26,180
I think you should...

2536
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:27,240
How much film do you have left?

2537
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:29,480
51%.

2538
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,280
Oh, shit.

2539
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,060
We have so much film.

2540
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,420
The camera's broken though.

2541
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:34,220
Oh.

2542
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:34,900
No, it's broken.

2543
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,080
I'll take it back.

2544
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:36,900
Yeah, yeah.

2545
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,320
Just throw it in the thing.

2546
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,540
Can we still get the CD though?

2547
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,320
Yeah, yeah.

2548
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:42,960
We can get the CD.

2549
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:48,280
We just can't film with it because we got slapped so fucking hard.

2550
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,200
I heard the slapper gives like a lot of content.

2551
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,640
I heard that every single time it slaps, it hits the like button.

2552
01:29:59,360 --> 01:29:59,760
Goodbye.

2553
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,680
Welcome back.

2554
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:09,820
I'm here.

2555
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,960
Wait, where's Snuffy?

2556
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,940
Snuffy might have ordered on us.

2557
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,060
Oh, whoa, whoa!

2558
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:22,280
Like, where the fuck did she go?

2559
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,500
That was just perusing.

2560
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,740
We gotta find the slapper.

2561
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,740
He gives like a lot of views.

2562
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:35,960
What's that word called when you use somebody for content without their consent?

2563
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,080
Oh no, what's that?

2564
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:39,560
What happened?

2565
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:40,860
What is that?

2566
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,920
Oh, it's a...

2567
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,760
I'm dead.

2568
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,420
It's okay, it's okay.

2569
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,200
Just run around.

2570
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,480
Oh yeah, we're gonna exploit these monsters.

2571
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,100
Did you exploit these monsters?

2572
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:54,540
You exploit the monster?

2573
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,080
It's so dark, I don't know if my camera can see him.

2574
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,360
Oh no.

2575
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,020
What about the content?

2576
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,020
Oh, she dead?

2577
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,520
Oh, she's dead.

2578
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,000
Oh wait, did you film?

2579
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,480
Wait, what's that?

2580
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:10,480
Yeah, I got it.

2581
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,500
You got it?

2582
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,400
Okay, go back to the ship!

2583
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,180
Go back to the ship!

2584
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,580
Oh shit!

2585
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:14,960
Okay.

2586
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,760
Where's the ship?

2587
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,480
Are you good?

2588
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

2589
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,960
I'm walking up, I'm walking up.

2590
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,760
I don't know if Han is alive.

2591
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,660
We only have 80% recorded.

2592
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,140
Okay, but if you just keep recording that one monster, I think we can...

2593
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,200
I don't want to be able to get a lot of views, right?

2594
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,380
Maybe there's something up here?

2595
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:34,880
Oh, that's true.

2596
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,060
Wait, where is the... Oh, the ship is over there.

2597
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,480
Is Han dead?

2598
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,680
I'm gonna check the ship.

2599
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:41,980
Okay.

2600
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,480
All right, let me check if he's dead dead.

2601
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,420
I can't believe we saw that.

2602
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,440
The first thing we saw.

2603
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,800
All right, let's see if he's moving.

2604
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,680
Oh, he's moving!

2605
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,140
He's alive!

2606
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:56,820
He's alive!

2607
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,380
Okay, I'm gonna bait a monster near you.

2608
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:01,480
All right.

2609
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,040
Han!

2610
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:04,440
Han!

2611
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:07,480
Han!

2612
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:08,600
Oh, hey!

2613
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,440
You're alive!

2614
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:10,440
Okay, nice.

2615
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,220
Only Lime died.

2616
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,780
I feel like we might be able to...

2617
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,980
We might be able to find monsters outside.

2618
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I feel like we could...

2619
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,860
It sounds scary outside.

2620
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,860
We can't like, juke them.

2621
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,000
Oh, we'll be fine.

2622
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,140
We'll be fine.

2623
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,840
Still, they want to call like, Ha-caw!

2624
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:30,320
Yeah, apparently they like, hear our voices too.

2625
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,360
Monster?

2626
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:35,920
The fitness gram pacer test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test.

2627
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,400
Black and yellow, black and yellow.

2628
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:40,900
Oh, there's another door here.

2629
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,840
Maybe I'll find another monster from here.

2630
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,100
I need my stamina though.

2631
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,100
Monster!

2632
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,840
We're here to exploit you for views.

2633
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:51,860
For content.

2634
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:54,700
Monster.

2635
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:55,440
Monster?

2636
01:32:59,060 --> 01:32:59,520
What's that?

2637
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:00,280
Did you hear that?

2638
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:07,410
Okay.

2639
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:09,310
Okay, welcome!

2640
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,490
Welcome to death.

2641
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:15,450
I really hope they remember to pick up the camera when we leave...

2642
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:16,630
...because I'm not sure if it will...

2643
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,850
...if it'll come with us...

2644
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:19,070
...if it just sits in the thing.

2645
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:19,850
Oh, yeah.

2646
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,850
I was like...

2647
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,070
I was going to say, did you get that?

2648
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:22,730
And then I done.

2649
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:30,130
I don't know how to deal with that monster.

2650
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:33,350
Once it gets you, it just chain throws you and you fucking die.

2651
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:38,370
It's like make another person aggro it before it picks you up again.

2652
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:40,250
I guess the aggro it.

2653
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:41,830
Gotcha.

2654
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:44,530
Oh god, they have to go home.

2655
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:45,430
Just go home.

2656
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:46,430
We got the content.

2657
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:50,270
How do you not have more content?

2658
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:53,630
How about we go in?

2659
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,030
Stay over here?

2660
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,690
Oh, he's gonna be a bait.

2661
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,650
He's gonna do it.

2662
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:00,670
No!

2663
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,030
Snuffy, what are you doing?

2664
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:05,370
Why are you still walking following him?

2665
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,810
You good?

2666
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,190
Talented, lucky.

2667
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:13,470
I think they're gonna die, Lymu.

2668
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:15,750
They're so fucked.

2669
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:16,470
How much...

2670
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:18,650
Hello, monsters!

2671
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:19,530
I'm here.

2672
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:21,210
I have come to vanquish you!

2673
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,590
Everything in this game just becomes really fucking lethal, so I...

2674
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,250
Show thyself.

2675
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:25,070
Thyself?

2676
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,190
Themself?

2677
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:26,590
Thyself, yeah.

2678
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:27,830
Thyself!

2679
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:28,990
I trust the vision.

2680
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,170
It's too dark and we can't find you.

2681
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:32,430
I trust it.

2682
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:33,110
We can do it.

2683
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:35,510
There's no way...

2684
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:37,730
I just realized there's... Oh, it's a little snail.

2685
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,550
Oh, the spookiest of monsters!

2686
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:41,850
A snail!

2687
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,550
What are you doing, Mr. Snail?

2688
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:45,830
Oh!

2689
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:53,470
So spooky.

2690
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:59,690
We still have 30%, but maybe we'll catch something on the way out.

2691
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,230
He's a natural content creator.

2692
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:03,890
Very much so.

2693
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,550
We're pretty...

2694
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:05,310
Big guys there.

2695
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:07,850
I feel like we have good odds to re-encounter something.

2696
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:08,370
I don't know.

2697
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,630
They're so dead.

2698
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:10,470
There's no way.

2699
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,730
I don't think they're gonna make it to the ship.

2700
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:16,870
We've always got, like, fucked at the last possible second.

2701
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:17,990
Hello.

2702
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:20,250
Go up!

2703
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,650
What are you guys doing?

2704
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,990
You're monsters.

2705
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:24,150
You're oxygen!

2706
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:25,690
Mr. Conta?

2707
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:26,970
Mr. Conta?

2708
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:28,650
Oh.

2709
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:31,210
How much oxygen do they have left?

2710
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:33,350
Look at their back in the canister.

2711
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,010
It's on the right.

2712
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:34,310
Oh, shit!

2713
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:34,750
Yeah.

2714
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:35,510
That's not a lot.

2715
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:36,050
Yeah.

2716
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:39,810
That's why I was like, why are they... why are they still exploring?

2717
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:40,590
That only happens if you don't die.

2718
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:40,910
Oh!

2719
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:42,670
Oh!

2720
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:44,550
Yes, Han?

2721
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,510
Uh...

2722
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:46,170
Han?

2723
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:46,810
What was that?

2724
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:48,590
That only happens if you don't die.

2725
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:50,110
What was that?

2726
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:58,050
All our entire life relies on Snuffy now.

2727
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:00,430
She doesn't know where to go!

2728
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:01,850
Oh, she does.

2729
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:02,210
Okay.

2730
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,950
I thought it couldn't smother her bones.

2731
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:07,410
We literally myth busted that.

2732
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:09,630
Oh, no.

2733
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:10,650
No!

2734
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:13,170
Not the end.

2735
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:16,150
The monster's gonna grab her at the very end.

2736
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:19,110
Oh, no.

2737
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:20,230
We needed you, Han.

2738
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:20,870
You have to bait.

2739
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,510
Oh, she's so close to the ship, though.

2740
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,610
Oh, there it is!

2741
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:29,290
Don't...

2742
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:32,170
Fucking...

2743
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:33,650
I can't even...

2744
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:35,790
Oh,

2745
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:39,910
my God.

2746
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:40,770
My God.

2747
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,970
Are you fucking kidding me?

2748
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:47,130
Wow.

2749
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:49,810
Now that's two cameras.

2750
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:50,210
Do we have to...

2751
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,090
We did not get that back.

2752
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:51,350
Wait.

2753
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:53,150
We put the camera in the spaceship.

2754
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,750
Maybe it came back with it.

2755
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:55,270
Is it still there?

2756
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:56,710
Oh, we put the first...

2757
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:57,030
We did it again.

2758
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,210
We just got to find the...

2759
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:58,550
Oh, my God.

2760
01:36:58,870 --> 01:36:59,230
Oh, my God.

2761
01:36:59,330 --> 01:36:59,650
Holy shit.

2762
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:01,410
It's back.

2763
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:02,010
Okay.

2764
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:02,850
We got the sword.

2765
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:03,670
Blessed camera.

2766
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:04,890
Oh, my God.

2767
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:06,970
At least we can afford flashlights now.

2768
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:07,590
We still have content.

2769
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,130
We have.

2770
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:10,310
That means we can go back.

2771
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:11,410
That one was good content.

2772
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:12,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2773
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,610
We gotta go back for it.

2774
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:14,910
We gotta find the camera.

2775
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:19,030
All right.

2776
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:20,210
I have the sword.

2777
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:20,910
CD, let's go.

2778
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:22,270
Yeah.

2779
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:22,670
Oh, my God.

2780
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:24,110
Is this the one where I recorded it?

2781
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:24,730
Oh, my God.

2782
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:25,450
It's gonna be so good.

2783
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:27,610
I don't even remember what happened.

2784
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:29,450
This feels like a week ago.

2785
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:30,910
That was fucking sick, man.

2786
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:31,930
I wish you guys saw it.

2787
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:33,410
Backseat is coming to my channel.

2788
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:33,950
This is great.

2789
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:35,590
Oh, my God.

2790
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:37,850
What is that?

2791
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:38,430
It's the...

2792
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:39,130
Oh, it's the...

2793
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,370
Oh, my God.

2794
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:41,350
I'm seeing right now.

2795
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,430
Oh, my God.

2796
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:43,030
Guys, you're such a...

2797
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,810
That's a lot of...

2798
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,450
Oh,

2799
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:47,640
my God.

2800
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:47,760
Guys, you're such a...

2801
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:47,880
Oh, my God.

2802
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:49,980
Guys, you're such a...

2803
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:50,820
Oh, my

2804
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:58,680
God.

2805
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,020
Guys, you're such a...

2806
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:00,120
Actually too many people came in the story.

2807
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:00,940
What can we say?

2808
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:01,980
Haha!

2809
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:03,620
Haha!

2810
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:11,070
Hahaha!

2811
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:13,960
Oh, my God!

2812
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,260
How did you get 65k from that?

2813
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,640
Because I got body slashed?

2814
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,380
It was like a selfie.

2815
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,320
The entire time.

2816
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,600
They were like, we love this.

2817
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,140
Like how did this come to it!

2818
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:25,880
Haha.

2819
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:28,920
That was fucking good.

2820
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:29,960
I want to see that one again.

2821
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:30,960
Haha.

2822
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,300
That was so good.

2823
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:32,680
Ha!

2824
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:33,340
Ha!

2825
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:35,920
Alright.

2826
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,760
Here you go.

2827
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,920
Time to sleep.

2828
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,560
I'm gonna stay up all night watching this.

2829
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:43,820
I can't believe...

2830
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:44,900
I can't believe this.

2831
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,320
That was like the most views we've ever had.

2832
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:47,840
Too.

2833
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,220
I forgot about the whisk guy.

2834
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,520
That feels like so long ago.

2835
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:56,840
Alright.

2836
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:57,640
Sleep time.

2837
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,700
Sleep time.

2838
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:02,220
Yay!

2839
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,000
Oh my god.

2840
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,940
Apparently YouTube is broken right now.

2841
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,900
I'm literally streaming this content.

2842
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,200
It's like already on my platform.

2843
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,900
We're doing so well guys.

2844
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,220
I believe in us.

2845
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,580
I mean we can...

2846
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:17,460
I think we can...

2847
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,200
I think if we get our second camera, we'll be fine.

2848
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,820
Apparently YouTube is broken right now.

2849
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,360
And cause I went from like...

2850
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,500
Apparently I have like 300 people watching me cause YouTube broke.

2851
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,540
They said less spider.

2852
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,400
We didn't listen.

2853
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:35,920
Yeah.

2854
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,440
They're like too much spiders.

2855
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,200
They're like too much spiders.

2856
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:42,920
Okay.

2857
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,040
What do we need?

2858
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:48,520
What do we need to survive guys?

2859
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,680
We need... we definitely need the hugs.

2860
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:51,900
Wait, wait, wait.

2861
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:52,660
We need the defib.

2862
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:53,520
We need a defib.

2863
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,080
We can afford a defib and the hugs.

2864
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,240
Oh that'll be great.

2865
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:57,900
Yeah.

2866
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:58,600
Okay.

2867
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,480
Infinite life hack.

2868
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,000
Okay.

2869
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:05,060
Did we order it?

2870
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,800
What is in our fucking bin right now?

2871
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,200
I'm scared.

2872
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,780
We can... oh we can afford flashlights.

2873
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,620
I'm gonna order a flashlight for us.

2874
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,600
We have so much money.

2875
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,180
Is it good to just like buy a ton of shit now?

2876
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:25,020
Yeah.

2877
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,220
I mean we need it.

2878
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,540
We really need it.

2879
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,600
There's no reason not to I guess.

2880
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,320
The fuck is this?

2881
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:32,340
Yeah.

2882
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,340
Infinite life hack.

2883
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:36,700
Oh yeah.

2884
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:37,380
I'll be the healer.

2885
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:38,800
Oh you want it?

2886
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,000
Okay.

2887
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:39,640
Here you go.

2888
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,160
Guys.

2889
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:41,380
Chat.

2890
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:42,140
You're all here.

2891
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,660
Even if I have one fat...

2892
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:45,460
There you go.

2893
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:48,260
If Doki Bird has one fat, I'm one of them.

2894
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:51,320
If Doki Bird has zero fat, it's because I'm dead.

2895
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,060
That's you.

2896
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,520
You guys are the chosen...

2897
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,080
all 200 of you.

2898
01:40:59,080 --> 01:40:59,880
I thought I did.

2899
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,700
Check out.

2900
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:03,860
The boom mic is so weird.

2901
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,140
It blows out the audio even more.

2902
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:05,620
It's really funny.

2903
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,280
Oh shit.

2904
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:11,200
Did you guys got the flashlight, defib, and the...

2905
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,680
I got the flashlight.

2906
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:13,260
Alright.

2907
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:14,660
Nice.

2908
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,140
Oh we don't have any money.

2909
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:21,500
That's real.

2910
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:21,720
Yeah.

2911
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:22,180
That's real.

2912
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,160
Nice.

2913
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:23,540
Alright.

2914
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:23,960
Here we go.

2915
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,040
Let's go.

2916
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:26,740
We're broke now.

2917
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,560
We gotta find the camera.

2918
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,080
Alright.

2919
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:36,980
Does anyone...

2920
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,200
The camera has to be like...

2921
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,780
almost close to us.

2922
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,540
I'm gonna go find the camera.

2923
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:47,620
It should be.

2924
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,020
It's near the other entrance.

2925
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,560
I'll try to find the camera.

2926
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,000
Don't worry.

2927
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,600
Let's split up, gang.

2928
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,680
That's why I learned how Scooby Doo.

2929
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,420
Split up and find more clues.

2930
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,160
Yeah.

2931
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,780
What we learn in Scooby Doo is Scooby Doo can do...

2932
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:09,280
Oh I found it!

2933
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:09,440
Oh wait.

2934
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:09,540
No.

2935
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:09,940
That's...

2936
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:10,760
Wait.

2937
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:11,760
Is that you?

2938
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,580
Do you find the camera?

2939
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,230
It's gotta be around there.

2940
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:17,670
Yeah.

2941
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:18,490
It should be around here.

2942
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:19,630
That's where she got slapped.

2943
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:21,910
Right?

2944
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:24,590
Where the fuck is her camera?

2945
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:26,390
It's right here.

2946
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:26,830
Oh.

2947
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:27,130
Okay.

2948
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:27,670
I grab it.

2949
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:28,670
There it is.

2950
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:29,650
It's underneath the bones here.

2951
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:30,370
Alright.

2952
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:31,130
I'll grab it.

2953
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:31,450
I can take it back.

2954
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:31,810
Okay.

2955
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:32,370
You're gonna take it?

2956
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,690
Okay.

2957
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,230
Yeah.

2958
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:34,030
I'll take it back.

2959
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,090
Alright.

2960
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:36,950
Oh.

2961
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:37,870
Does someone want the flashlight?

2962
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:38,610
Oh.

2963
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:38,770
Yeah.

2964
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,230
I can take it.

2965
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:39,710
Yeah.

2966
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,930
Yeah.

2967
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:40,050
Yeah.

2968
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:41,110
We have 85%.

2969
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:42,710
Alright.

2970
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,590
Let's put the camera.

2971
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:43,950
Let's...

2972
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,750
Make sure she... Let's escort her.

2973
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:46,790
Give a buddy system.

2974
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:49,430
And make sure she makes it to the ship.

2975
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:50,950
Make sure she makes it to the ship.

2976
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:57,110
Let's make sure she doesn't die while we walk back.

2977
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,470
Let's make sure she doesn't die while we walk back.

2978
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:58,210
And get slapped.

2979
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:58,430
And get slapped.

2980
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:03,030
It doesn't look like there's anything.

2981
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:03,850
That's nice.

2982
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:04,870
It doesn't look like there's anything.

2983
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,870
That's nice.

2984
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,870
Wait.

2985
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:05,110
Snuffy.

2986
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:06,830
Did you... Did you get footage of the slapper?

2987
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:07,170
Wait.

2988
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:07,170
Snuffy.

2989
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:07,170
Did you...

2990
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:07,170
Did you get footage of the slapper?

2991
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:09,890
I think I did.

2992
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:10,230
I did.

2993
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:10,730
Okay.

2994
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,990
Good.

2995
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:12,690
I hear he's like a lot of views.

2996
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:13,510
Okay.

2997
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,510
Good.

2998
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,510
I hear he's like a lot of views.

2999
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:14,010
Yeah.

3000
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:14,270
Oh.

3001
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:14,650
Really?

3002
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:15,070
Yeah.

3003
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:15,330
Yeah.

3004
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:15,510
Yeah.

3005
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:15,930
Yeah.

3006
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:16,390
Yeah.

3007
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:16,510
Yeah.

3008
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:20,010
That's like a combination of like the... Both the times we died.

3009
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:21,050
Okay.

3010
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:21,590
There we go.

3011
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:22,070
Alright.

3012
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:22,510
Nice.

3013
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:23,070
Alright.

3014
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:24,970
I was like if I'm dying, it's for the content.

3015
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:25,270
You know?

3016
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,830
Exactly.

3017
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:27,290
It's all about going vital.

3018
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:29,890
For the content.

3019
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:30,830
For the content.

3020
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:35,010
If you don't die for your content, then what's the point?

3021
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:36,550
If you don't die for your content, then what's the point?

3022
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,250
Do not follow...

3023
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,590
Do not listen to me.

3024
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:42,650
That's not really good advice.

3025
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,310
Where?

3026
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,810
It's a fucking Tonberry again.

3027
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:48,750
Oh my god.

3028
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:51,090
He's a fucking stream sniper.

3029
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:52,270
Alright.

3030
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:53,170
We'll give it to Milken.

3031
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:53,670
Yeah.

3032
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:55,830
Give him some of that content.

3033
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:56,070
Oh, they're shy.

3034
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:57,310
Yeah.

3035
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,710
He wants to be a famous stream sniper.

3036
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:01,810
You can become famous that way, guys.

3037
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,550
Then like...

3038
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:04,230
Oh my gosh.

3039
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:07,850
There's like so many big streamers that became famous just for stream sniping.

3040
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:11,550
But also don't stream snipe us, guys.

3041
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:13,530
You won't get famous from stream sniping VTubers.

3042
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:17,710
It only works for IRL content.

3043
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:22,820
Here we go.

3044
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,500
Here we go.

3045
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:26,940
Here we go.

3046
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:28,980
Content time.

3047
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,840
Where are you?

3048
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:33,960
Where are you?

3049
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:36,980
You don't know that.

3050
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,640
It could be...

3051
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:38,880
Oh.

3052
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:39,840
It is a dead end.

3053
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:41,540
Guys, it is a dead end.

3054
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:43,700
Oh, it's a dead end.

3055
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:43,960
Wow.

3056
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:44,500
Look at that.

3057
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:44,940
Wow.

3058
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:45,780
Who would have thought?

3059
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,560
Guys, why didn't you tell me it was a dead end?

3060
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:49,280
Guys.

3061
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,080
I'm sorry we haven't found the lasers yet.

3062
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,260
We could have done some limbo.

3063
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:58,400
We could have done some limbo.

3064
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,460
I think we go this way.

3065
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:04,670
Oh my god.

3066
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:07,550
Apparently YouTube is broken that people can't chat right now.

3067
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:08,930
But they can super chat.

3068
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:14,150
Oh my god.

3069
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:15,210
You gotta pay to chat.

3070
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:16,050
It's pay to win.

3071
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:16,970
Pay to chat.

3072
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:23,750
If you want to communicate with a streamer you gotta have the money.

3073
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,630
That's so fucked up.

3074
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:27,590
Wait, there's a spine.

3075
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:29,910
The big ribbon?

3076
01:45:30,210 --> 01:45:31,570
Did you guys hear me?

3077
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:33,530
Did you film the spine?

3078
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:35,970
Oh shit.

3079
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:38,010
Someone quick hug him.

3080
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,390
Someone quick hug him.

3081
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,510
He's got the hugs.

3082
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:45,090
Wait, you have the hugs?

3083
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:47,050
I've got you.

3084
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:48,410
Thanks.

3085
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:50,190
Alright, film the hugs.

3086
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,080
Light him up!

3087
01:45:59,140 --> 01:45:59,620
Light him up!

3088
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,660
Put the light on him!

3089
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:02,240
Thank you.

3090
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,560
Jesus Christ.

3091
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,500
Guys, I'm stuck.

3092
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,180
Can I have a hug?

3093
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,540
Guys.

3094
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:11,540
Guys.

3095
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:12,760
Okay, I'm okay.

3096
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,100
I'm okay.

3097
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,080
Who has the hugs?

3098
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:15,920
He's back!

3099
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:16,380
He's back!

3100
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,380
I flashed him.

3101
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:19,980
I don't think he likes it.

3102
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:20,200
Who has that?

3103
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,200
He doesn't like the light.

3104
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,040
I would like a hug.

3105
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:24,580
Thank you.

3106
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:26,800
There we go.

3107
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,520
He doesn't like light.

3108
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,260
He doesn't like light.

3109
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:33,460
Don't worry.

3110
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,540
Get the light!

3111
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:34,940
Get the light!

3112
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,020
I got it!

3113
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:36,940
I got it!

3114
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,280
Wait, we have the camera.

3115
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,620
Yeah, we don't have the flashlight.

3116
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,020
Alright, I have the defib too.

3117
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,140
How much more film do we have left?

3118
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,280
We only have 20%.

3119
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,460
I think that's enough.

3120
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,400
We should head back.

3121
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,140
There's gonna be a fucking time.

3122
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,940
There's a giant up there anyway.

3123
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,860
Yeah, I feel like we're gonna get fucked over again.

3124
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,240
Wait, where's this way?

3125
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,820
Oh, they ran off the road.

3126
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,180
Oh, wait.

3127
01:46:59,240 --> 01:46:59,380
We're good.

3128
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:00,200
Yeah, don't worry.

3129
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:01,740
I'm never lost.

3130
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:03,840
No, of course not.

3131
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:04,500
Don't worry.

3132
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,220
I got this.

3133
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,980
Guys, don't worry.

3134
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:10,900
I will go further.

3135
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:11,840
I am very brave.

3136
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,400
I'm almost out of oxygen.

3137
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,480
Did he squeeze the oxygen out of my ass or something?

3138
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,000
I think he did.

3139
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,620
No, we're the same.

3140
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:19,240
Did he squeeze the...

3141
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,860
He was trying to fucking perform CPR but fucked up.

3142
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:27,420
There's something over there on the right hand side.

3143
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,180
I don't know what it is.

3144
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:28,840
Where is that?

3145
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,160
It's underneath all that crap over there.

3146
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:30,680

We don't need it.

3161
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,040
It was a cheap one.

3162
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,240
It was a cheap one.

3163
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,720

3173
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:34,780
Okay We have to figure out if the this first camera Or the second the first camera would give us the views or not, or should we just commit to the last one?

3174
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,280
Um, the first one might have giant footage we could do that.

3175
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:40,040
All right.

3176
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:40,600

Okay, and then we'll save the other one.

3179

3181
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:52,350

01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,880
You have the magnets in your head.

3325
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:06,620
What the hell?

3326
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,860
Did he just teleport onto me?

3327
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:10,240
He literally like...

3328
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,360
He ran straight at you!

3329
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:13,440
Bro!

3330
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,520
Bro, did you like AFK?

3331
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:19,940
Did you AFK when I revived you?

3332
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:20,660
Did you AFK when I revived you?

3333
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:22,940
I had to...

3334
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:28,800
I was like, okay, I'm dead So I tabbed and went to go deal with my dog And then suddenly like, I was alive!

3335
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,900
I was like, run, run, run, Emo!

3336
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:37,140
And then I died and I just see you standing there AFK!

3337
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:37,620
I was so sorry!

3338
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:41,460
I was like, okay, I'm dead, perfect time to go take care of some chores!

3339
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:42,080
Nope!

3340
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:44,020
And then I came back and was like, wait, how am I alive?

3341
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:46,800
I'm so sorry!

3342
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:49,120
Oh my god!

3343
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:51,660
About to revisit my grave...

3344
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,320
The other guy found me.

3345
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,660
He fucking teleports, I swear to god.

3346
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,660
He got back and gets slapped.

3347
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,900
It doesn't look like there's anything.

3348
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:04,140
It's gonna be the first guy we see.

3349
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,240
It's not rare.

3350
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,140
It's the fucking Tonbury again!

3351
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,620
Oh my god!

3352
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,060
He's a fucking stream sniper.

3353
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,520
Alright, well get to milking.

3354
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,960
Get to milking?

3355
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,040
For the content.

3356
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,420
Milking him for the content.

3357
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:20,880
Yes!

3358
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,140
Oh, there he is!

3359
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,560
Oh, there he is!

3360
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:31,060
Oh, there he is!

3361
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:31,900
Oh, there he is!

3362
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:38,900
He doesn't know where to go.

3363
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:39,140
He doesn't know where to go.

3364
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:39,780
He's so angry.

3365
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:42,480
Light him up!

3366
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:43,000
Light him up!

3367
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:45,040
Put the light on him!

3368
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:45,680
Thank you!

3369
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,080
Oh, he's back!

3370
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:51,680
Okay.

3371
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,240
Get the light!

3372
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:55,620
Get the light!

3373
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:00,330
Look at our views though.

3374
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:01,470
Look at it go up.

3375
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:02,270
Oh my god!

3376
01:59:03,090 --> 01:59:03,450
165?

3377
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:04,950
Did we find a slapper here?

3378
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:07,070
No we didn't.

3379
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:08,250
We found like the regular guys.

3380
01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:09,350
Yay!

3381
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:10,610
Yay!

3382
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:13,670
As long as we find our other camera, we can get a lot of views.

3383
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:14,730
Because we filmed the slapper.

3384
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:16,970
Is this the first one?

3385
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,820
Holy shit!

3386
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:26,420
Holy shit!

3387
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:27,280
Oh my god, thank god!

3388
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,060
We have money!

3389
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:28,620
We're broke!

3390
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,640
We don't have anything again!

3391
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,340
Oh my god!

3392
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:34,540
We're always broke!

3393
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:35,940
That's our secret!

3394
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:39,960
We live to survive.

3395
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:42,540
Good morning!

3396
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:43,540
Good morning!

3397
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,120
Mr. Beast, I locked my friends into a 1000 deep tunnel.

3398
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,220
For seven days.

3399
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,040
You forgot to add for seven days.

3400
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,020
For seven days!

3401
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:58,600
I'm being stranded on ancient technology planet.

3402
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:03,320
We need a flashlight, a hug, and a deep pip.

3403
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:06,080
Do we have enough?

3404
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,980
I'll put the hug.

3405
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,700
Holy shit, that's a $500 flashlight?

3406
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:11,300
Imagine how bright it could be.

3407
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:13,060
Okay, we have $400 left.

3408
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,740
Should we spend it on the long flashlight?

3409
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:17,800
I like the modern flashlight better.

3410
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:18,340
Okay.

3411
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:21,000
We'll buy two then.

3412
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,120
Hell yeah.

3413
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:24,980
Wait, I don't think we have enough.

3414
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:27,900
Yeah, we don't.

3415
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:29,380
We don't have enough.

3416
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:30,100
I couldn't math.

3417
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,900
I couldn't math!

3418
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,420
Why would you rely on me on mathematics, Han?

3419
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,380
You know I can't do math!

3420
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:41,560
You know I can't do math!

3421
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:41,840
Alright.

3422
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,840
I got the modern flashlight.

3423
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:49,640
I should...

3424
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:50,940
Wait, I'll be a deep fib.

3425
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,060
I'll be a deep fib.

3426
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,660
Let me know if anybody wants the camera.

3427
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,660
Alright, I'm ready.

3428
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:58,620
No, I don't like the flashlight.

3429
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:01,060
Yeah, the pressure is way too much.

3430
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,380
Are you guys ready?

3431
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:05,260
We gotta find the camera.

3432
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:07,800
Does anyone remember where it was?

3433
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:09,680
Does anyone remember?

3434
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:12,380
Wait, what?

3435
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:12,780
We died?

3436
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,460
I don't remember much of anything.

3437
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:15,140
Oh.

3438
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:18,480
Wait, I don't know how to do this.

3439
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,220
I don't know...

3440
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:22,320
What do you mean goop?

3441
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:24,900
Oh, the goop's here already?

3442
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:26,160
Oh, wait, wait.

3443
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:27,440
Oh, we baited to its death.

3444
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,820
He's gonna fall off.

3445
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:31,820
Cause he doesn't know what to do.

3446
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,640
He's gonna fall off, right?

3447
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:36,640
He doesn't look like he's falling off.

3448
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:37,480
He doesn't look like he's falling off.

3449
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:37,820
Film him!

3450
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:38,180
Film him!

3451
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:38,920
Film him!

3452
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,320
Free content!

3453
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,580
What happens if I...

3454
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,300
Oh, no!

3455
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:03,360
This is funny!

3456
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:05,020
Guys, we have to hurry!

3457
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:05,600
Get caught!

3458
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:07,120
Get the camera before he...

3459
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:11,690
Oh, there's a monster!

3460
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:12,570
There's a monster!

3461
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:13,230
Oh, shit!

3462
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:14,210
Oh, shit!

3463
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:20,470
Fight the dead!

3464
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:22,690
Defend me, defense!

3465
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:23,490
No!

3466
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:26,210
You deserve that.

3467
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:28,810
What did I do?

3468
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:30,850
What did I do?

3469
02:02:31,390 --> 02:02:31,690
I didn't yell at him.

3470
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:32,190
Thank you.

3471
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,470
You killed me.

3472
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:35,390
I opened the door.

3473
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:36,250
Harmony always bites back.

3474
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:38,070
I opened the door.

3475
02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:39,530
That's different.

3476
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:40,770
I'm back alive.

3477
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:41,810
Thank you.

3478
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:44,330
I didn't want to hear Han yell at me.

3479
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:47,890
Here's your defense.

3480
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:48,730
Oh, no.

3481
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:51,550
Oh, wait!

3482
02:02:51,710 --> 02:02:53,270
She fell off the camera?

3483
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:54,410
No!

3484
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:58,860
Okay, we have...

3485
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:01,240
I don't remember how hard they can call.

3486
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:02,740
It's not that hard.

3487
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:05,960
Okay, let's just try to find the other camera.

3488
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,880
We just need the other camera.

3489
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:09,940
Does anyone...

3490
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:11,880
I don't know.

3491
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:14,000
It's like a mouse.

3492
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:15,960
We have to figure out how to find it.

3493
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:17,260
Where the other camera is.

3494
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:19,340
Where could it be?

3495
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:20,380
Was it above us?

3496
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:23,740
No, it would have fallen...

3497
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,080
No, I meant like the second camera.

3498
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:27,080
Oh, god.

3499
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,500
The camera we died with.

3500
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:30,300
We have to figure out how to...

3501
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:32,660
It should be above us.

3502
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:33,020
Right?

3503
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:34,800
Oh, god.

3504
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:35,100
No.

3505
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,360
There's something in here.

3506
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:38,160
Oh, no.

3507
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:39,780
We don't have a camera to catch it to.

3508
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:41,480
Nope.

3509
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,860
Oh, no.

3510
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,460
It's making flapping noises.

3511
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:45,800
I'm kind of uncomfortable actually.

3512
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:46,220
Me too.

3513
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,500
It's getting closer.

3514
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,380
Oh, god.

3515
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:53,920
Limo?

3516
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:56,180
Limo?

3517
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:57,780
I think they hit terminal velocity.

3518
02:03:58,760 --> 02:03:59,200
Oh.

3519
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:02,540
Wait, what happened?

3520
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:03,480
What happened?

3521
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:06,120
When you fall for a certain amount of time, it crashes the game.

3522
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:07,000
Did you crash too?

3523
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,080
What the fuck?

3524
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:08,560
Yeah, I did.

3525
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:11,020
Yeah, if someone falls...

3526
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,620
Wait, I'm still in the game.

3527
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,040
I'm still in the game.

3528
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:16,940
It just works.

3529
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,320
Well, I think we were...

3530
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:19,260
Well, actually, I don't know.

3531
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,200
I don't think we were screwed.

3532
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:21,100
That super sucks.

3533
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:22,560
They haven't come back yet though.

3534
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:24,380
Wait, no.

3535
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:26,000
I think I gotta restart the game.

3536
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,040
Oh, shit.

3537
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:28,800
I'm still in the game.

3538
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,240
I'm still in.

3539
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:36,620
Guys, I was still in the game.

3540
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:38,880
Oh, you were?

3541
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,600
Yeah, I'm still in.

3542
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,620
We crashed.

3543
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:43,860
I wasn't even the server owner.

3544
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:48,900
Wait, how was the server owner?

3545
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:50,820
Han, you gotta remake the server.

3546
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,000
Huh?

3547
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:54,340
Huh?

3548
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:59,480
We had terminal velocity, so everything crashed.

3549
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:02,360
Okay.

3550
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:04,420
I'm gonna...

3551
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:05,840
I'm disconnected.

3552
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,400
I'm gonna wait for the invite.

3553
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:08,860
I got you.

3554
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:10,360
Oh my god.

3555
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:13,540
I can't believe I opened the door.

3556
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:17,100
You let me fall all the way down there.

3557
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:18,260
I was...

3558
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:19,320
I was supposed to...

3559
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,140
I just opened the door.

3560
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,220
Oh, I wonder what's keeping them anchored down inside the ship.

3561
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:25,480
You know, maybe glitches or something.

3562
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:26,440
Open the door!

3563
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:28,600
Okay, you walked into him.

3564
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,100
That was your fault for walking into the guy.

3565
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:33,740
And you kicked me off the cliff.

3566
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,320
We had a defib and everything.

3567
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:37,500
We were planned for this.

3568
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:38,280
It was for the content.

3569
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:40,180
Yeah, we were so planned.

3570
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,260
The defib made me...

3571
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:44,920
Frickin' 100,000 meters below the surface.

3572
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:47,800
You were so fast.

3573
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:49,660
Wait, wait, wait!

3574
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:50,820
It didn't count the day!

3575
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:53,880
Ooh, result!

3576
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,420
Wait, what does that mean?

3577
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:57,160
It meant...

3578
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:57,600
Okay, wait.

3579
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:58,740
Snuffy's not here yet.

3580
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,200
I was like, we left her.

3581
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:09,020
Yeah, so I guess we get like a read-in.

3582
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:09,740
Oh my god.

3583
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:13,540
Bro, but that was such good content when Han fell down the ship.

3584
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:17,100
That was such good content.

3585
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,120
We missed out.

3586
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:22,800
Alright, let's wait for Snuffy.

3587
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:23,380
Snuffy, you're so fast.

3588
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:23,860
You're so fast.

3589
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,080
Where is she?

3590
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
What color am I?

3591
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:29,000
Am I still red?

3592
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,600
I am.

3593
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:30,560
Nice.

3594
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:36,850
Oh, it resets the volume of everybody too.

3595
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:39,250
I just noticed.

3596
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:41,750
It resets everybody's volume.

3597
02:06:44,070 --> 02:06:46,630
Uh, I can't invite Snuffy for some reason.

3598
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:47,390
Oh, I can invite her.

3599
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:48,490
Alright.

3600
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:49,730
Or Lime can.

3601
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:52,490
Uh, yeah, I'll invite her.

3602
02:06:52,670 --> 02:06:54,170
Yeah, yeah, one of us can invite her.

3603
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:55,690
How do I join?

3604
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:56,170
You can join the game.

3605
02:06:58,330 --> 02:06:59,710
I just invited you.

3606
02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:05,070
It's just like, how do I get in here?

3607
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:06,270
Hi Snuffy!

3608
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:09,250
It reset the day so we get another chance.

3609
02:07:09,610 --> 02:07:10,610
We have another chance.

3610
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:11,970
We don't need a backflip anymore.

3611
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:13,370
Oh my god, you're right.

3612
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:14,810
We lose our emotes.

3613
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:16,750
Oooh.

3614
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:19,110
Oh, and it wipes...

3615
02:07:19,110 --> 02:07:20,830
I remember it wipes the camera too.

3616
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:22,810
Oh.

3617
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:23,950
All my settings are different.

3618
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:26,790
It wipes the camera as well.

3619
02:07:26,950 --> 02:07:28,110
So like, uh...

3620
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:31,230
We won't be able to grab the camera from the last day.

3621
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:33,050
Because we have to reset it.

3622
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,030
We don't even think about it.

3623
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:38,750
Bro, but it has to slap her though.

3624
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:41,370
Bro, but it has to slap her though.

3625
02:07:41,370 --> 02:07:41,770
Wait, do we buy the defib?

3626
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:42,970
You think he won't be slapping us again?

3627
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:44,230
Oh yeah, that's true.

3628
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:45,230
He might slap us again.

3629
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:48,110
Grab the defib and the hug.

3630
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:48,710
Grab the defib and the hug.

3631
02:07:50,590 --> 02:07:51,030
Alright.

3632
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:53,310
We're so back.

3633
02:07:54,030 --> 02:07:55,130
Guys, I have...

3634
02:07:55,130 --> 02:07:56,410
Oh my god, guys, I'm blowing up.

3635
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:57,570
I don't have 200 viewers anymore.

3636
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:57,910
Guys.

3637
02:07:58,370 --> 02:08:01,130
Oh my god, I'm going viral live at this moment.

3638
02:08:01,610 --> 02:08:02,050
Dude.

3639
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:03,090
Oh my god.

3640
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:03,850
The slapper.

3641
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:04,870
Did you get slapper content?

3642
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:06,050
Yeah, I got the slapper.

3643
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:07,250
They heard about the slapper content.

3644
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:08,390
They can't...

3645
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:09,530
Oh my god.

3646
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:11,790
I'm going viral as we speak.

3647
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:14,550
Going from a 200 Andy to a...

3648
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:16,750
to a 4k Andy.

3649
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:19,070
Someone grab the hug?

3650
02:08:19,310 --> 02:08:19,570
Someone grab the hug?

3651
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:20,090
Come here, come here.

3652
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:21,050
It's a freaking miracle.

3653
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:22,570
Come here, back seating works.

3654
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:23,570
Back seating works.

3655
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:23,890
What?

3656
02:08:24,650 --> 02:08:25,170
Look.

3657
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:26,810
It's our...

3658
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:27,790
It's our items.

3659
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:31,550
Oh, it's our ancient gestures.

3660
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:34,610
I don't remember which one's mine.

3661
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:35,590
Oh my god.

3662
02:08:35,790 --> 02:08:36,910
Yours is the peace sign.

3663
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:37,970
What is this?

3664
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:39,030
Nice, nice, nice.

3665
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:40,830
Yeah, Han never bought an emote.

3666
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:44,050
Guys, and you said you were gonna ban all back seaters.

3667
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:46,510
You gotta learn to appreciate.

3668
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:48,350
I've been chained.

3669
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:50,430
They got me back my back flip.

3670
02:08:51,050 --> 02:08:52,990
You gotta unban the back seaters now.

3671
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:54,430
You gotta do those streams where it's like...

3672
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:56,170
We've been on our crew three times that size.

3673
02:08:57,490 --> 02:08:58,790
Alright, are you ready to go?

3674
02:08:59,150 --> 02:09:00,090
Ready for content?

3675
02:09:00,410 --> 02:09:00,770
Yes, dude.

3676
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:02,150
Yes, content, content.

3677
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:02,910
Content time.

3678
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:04,590
We're so back.

3679
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:10,370
What are you...

3680
02:09:10,370 --> 02:09:11,170
What did you order?

3681
02:09:12,090 --> 02:09:13,270
Did you order the goo?

3682
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:14,750
I saw that.

3683
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:16,110
You ordered the goo, didn't you?

3684
02:09:16,530 --> 02:09:18,470
You're gonna goo them, aren't you?

3685
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:20,690
You can't, you can't.

3686
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:21,070
You can't.

3687
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:25,970
I saw it.

3688
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:26,930
I saw what it was.

3689
02:09:29,330 --> 02:09:30,150
We're so back.

3690
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:32,090
We can do this.

3691
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:32,910
We can get 300.

3692
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:36,730
Oh, there's no way we can die this time too.

3693
02:09:36,850 --> 02:09:38,210
Because there's no hole.

3694
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:40,930
Yeah, there's no holes.

3695
02:09:40,990 --> 02:09:41,630
There's no holes.

3696
02:09:41,650 --> 02:09:43,930
Yeah, there's definitely no way we'll die in another way.

3697
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:45,230
Wait, but then the content.

3698
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:45,650
Okay.

3699
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:46,830
For content though?

3700
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:47,710
Yeah, for content.

3701
02:09:47,790 --> 02:09:48,270
I have a defense.

3702
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:49,610
Guys, I have a defib.

3703
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:50,110
So we die.

3704
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:51,310
You're gonna be stuck up there, aren't you?

3705
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:53,250
No, no, we can just chuck it.

3706
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:54,390
Who wants to do it?

3707
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:55,170
I'll defib.

3708
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,330
3, 2, 1.

3709
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:58,910
Who's gonna do it?

3710
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:00,690
Who has the least important items?

3711
02:10:01,730 --> 02:10:02,650
I have a flashlight.

3712
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:03,410
I'm going.

3713
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:05,010
I'm going.

3714
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:07,910
I start screaming.

3715
02:10:09,710 --> 02:10:10,990
Oh, god, no!

3716
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:12,070
What a world!

3717
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:13,790
Oh, my life!

3718
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:17,910
Hey, thank you.

3719
02:10:17,990 --> 02:10:18,570
I did it.

3720
02:10:18,690 --> 02:10:19,970
You have to chuck it at them.

3721
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:21,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3722
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,770
I'm gonna try again.

3723
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:22,750
I'll show you a demonstration.

3724
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:23,710
I'll do it again.

3725
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:25,390
It'll be so funny.

3726
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:26,590
Okay, but can someone hug me first?

3727
02:10:26,730 --> 02:10:27,630
I feel very vulnerable.

3728
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:31,130
I got you.

3729
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:32,270
Thank you.

3730
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:33,230
Thank you.

3731
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:33,610
Don't worry.

3732
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:34,510
Trauma isn't real.

3733
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:35,290
Let's do this.

3734
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:35,910
Let's do this.

3735
02:10:36,250 --> 02:10:37,450
Trauma isn't real.

3736
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:40,770
Oh, god, no!

3737
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:42,850
I'm so vulnerable!

3738
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:43,530
I'm scared!

3739
02:10:45,670 --> 02:10:47,090
This is gonna take forever.

3740
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:47,830
Don't worry.

3741
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:48,650
I can do it.

3742
02:10:48,690 --> 02:10:49,510
I can replicate this.

3743
02:10:52,050 --> 02:10:52,690
There you go.

3744
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:52,870
See?

3745
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:53,750
That's how you do it.

3746
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:54,690
Thank you.

3747
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:55,670
That's how you do it.

3748
02:10:56,970 --> 02:10:57,690
A hug.

3749
02:10:58,530 --> 02:10:59,950
Can I have another hug, please?

3750
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:02,090
I still feel like Billy, you're emotional.

3751
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:03,470
Oh, yeah.

3752
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:03,830
I forgot.

3753
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:05,170
Let me give this back to you as well.

3754
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:05,810
Thank you.

3755
02:11:06,330 --> 02:11:06,690
Holy!

3756
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:10,810
Guys, it's my turn!

3757
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:11,830
I taught you this!

3758
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:13,730
I taught you, guys!

3759
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:15,550
I hit you with it!

3760
02:11:15,930 --> 02:11:16,650
There you go.

3761
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:17,350
There you go.

3762
02:11:17,350 --> 02:11:17,510
There's a bone.

3763
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:18,370
I got a bone, though.

3764
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:18,790
Hey, guys.

3765
02:11:19,510 --> 02:11:21,750
This character steps on a shovel type moment.

3766
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:23,870
If anyone grabs...

3767
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:24,930
You have the defib, right?

3768
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,810
I got bone, though.

3769
02:11:25,850 --> 02:11:26,390
Look at this.

3770
02:11:26,450 --> 02:11:27,250
Look at this sick bone.

3771
02:11:27,330 --> 02:11:28,190
That's right behind you, I think.

3772
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:29,990
This.

3773
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,990
Yeah, I dropped the defib.

3774
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:32,250
Tomberry!

3775
02:11:32,370 --> 02:11:32,630
Tomberry!

3776
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:32,970
Tomberry!

3777
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:35,110
What the fuck is that?

3778
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:36,030
Oh, shit!

3779
02:11:38,530 --> 02:11:39,270
Oh, god.

3780
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:40,390
Help me!

3781
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:43,010
Help me!

3782
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:44,290
Okay.

3783
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:46,590
Wait, did he die?

3784
02:11:46,930 --> 02:11:47,490
Did he die?

3785
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:50,990
He got shaked to death!

3786
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:54,350
Don't worry.

3787
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:55,750
I have the defib.

3788
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:56,250
Where is he?

3789
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:56,970
Oh, look.

3790
02:11:57,010 --> 02:11:57,510
There's goop.

3791
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:58,250
There's goop right here.

3792
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:58,890
Where is his body?

3793
02:11:59,010 --> 02:12:00,150
He's still in the thing.

3794
02:12:00,210 --> 02:12:00,990
He's still in the thing.

3795
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:01,030
Don't worry.

3796
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:01,790
There's goop.

3797
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:02,450
There's goop.

3798
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:03,010
There's goop.

3799
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:04,370
Don't worry.

3800
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:06,110
You're alive!

3801
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:08,310
Tom, you're alive!

3802
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:10,050
Get down from here!

3803
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:11,690
Hi!

3804
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:17,230
I can't chuck him down!

3805
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:19,310
Oh, my god.

3806
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:20,110
He's dead again!

3807
02:12:20,330 --> 02:12:21,830
You died again, Ron!

3808
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:23,450
You should have bought an emote!

3809
02:12:23,530 --> 02:12:24,630
Wait, there's a slime!

3810
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:25,430
Oh, god.

3811
02:12:25,770 --> 02:12:27,170
No, it's his slime!

3812
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:28,850
He spent our money on that slime!

3813
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:33,730
Guys, we have to get him down because there's a cool down for him.

3814
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:33,950
Oh, shit.

3815
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:35,970
The shooty robot!

3816
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:37,590
The shooty robot on the grabby hook!

3817
02:12:37,690 --> 02:12:38,050
Do it!

3818
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:38,650
Ah!

3819
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:39,950
Ah!

3820
02:12:42,210 --> 02:12:42,690
Ah!

3821
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:49,190
Oh, my god.

3822
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:51,670
He's so doomed.

3823
02:12:52,150 --> 02:12:54,230
Oh, you're so fine!

3824
02:12:54,990 --> 02:12:55,510
No!

3825
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:59,030
Did I revive you and you were just still stuck?

3826
02:12:59,190 --> 02:13:00,790
Were you still alive when you were dead?

3827
02:13:01,230 --> 02:13:01,490
Yeah.

3828
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:03,810
Did I die again?

3829
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:06,710
Oh, my god.

3830
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:08,110
Did she get the content?

3831
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:08,590
No!

3832
02:13:09,630 --> 02:13:10,830
Did she get the content?

3833
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:12,190
Did she get the content?

3834
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:14,470
I think she has to go.

3835
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:16,170
I think she has to leave.

3836
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:19,310
I need to go get everybody's... what?

3837
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:21,010
No, just leave!

3838
02:13:21,330 --> 02:13:22,190
Just leave!

3839
02:13:22,270 --> 02:13:23,170
It's not worth it!

3840
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,830
It's not worth it!

3841
02:13:27,770 --> 02:13:30,510
At least if she dies, she can just leave the camera here, maybe.

3842
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:31,930
Oh, that's true!

3843
02:13:32,330 --> 02:13:33,030
That's true!

3844
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:35,850
Oh!

3845
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:36,450
See?

3846
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:37,250
Giga brain.

3847
02:13:37,390 --> 02:13:40,250
Yeah, but the thing is, there's like three monsters outside.

3848
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:41,550
I can literally hear it.

3849
02:13:41,870 --> 02:13:44,190
Yeah, we can literally hear them pulsating.

3850
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:46,090
Yeah, they're pulsating again.

3851
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:47,490
I can literally hear them going against the door right now.

3852
02:13:49,070 --> 02:13:49,430
Oh!

3853
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:51,890
Nobody's there.

3854
02:13:52,730 --> 02:13:53,210
Nobody's there.

3855
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:54,190
What's the worst that could happen?

3856
02:13:55,870 --> 02:13:56,590
She dies?

3857
02:13:57,010 --> 02:13:58,470
That would be so funny, though.

3858
02:14:00,590 --> 02:14:02,130
I like how she's looking at the ground.

3859
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:03,670
I like how she's looking at the ground.

3860
02:14:03,670 --> 02:14:04,490
Oh, no, no, no, no!

3861
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:05,430
It's right there!

3862
02:14:05,490 --> 02:14:06,050
It's right there!

3863
02:14:06,130 --> 02:14:07,270
Oh, yeah, I don't see it.

3864
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:08,110
Oh, I see it now.

3865
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:13,130
I feel like we just got like ganged up.

3866
02:14:14,450 --> 02:14:16,150
I hope she remembers the ceiling down there.

3867
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:19,730
Oh, that would be so funny if she doesn't remember.

3868
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:22,630
Wait, there's two of them there.

3869
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:25,730
Wait, there's two of them there.

3870
02:14:25,730 --> 02:14:29,210
I liked how Han inked with the goo when he got like...

3871
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:29,310
I liked how Han inked with the goo when he got like...

3872
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:29,810
Where the fuck did everybody die?

3873
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:31,530
He instantly threw the fucking goo.

3874
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:34,930
Oh, oh.

3875
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:36,610
What is she trying to do?

3876
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:40,090
I don't think she sees our bodies over there.

3877
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:41,030
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3878
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:45,750
Her face pops out.

3879
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:46,490
I'm gonna try to cover your item.

3880
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:51,950
Her face properly represents what's...

3881
02:14:56,510 --> 02:14:58,030
Just leave.

3882
02:14:58,410 --> 02:15:00,450
We can buy new items.

3883
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:01,650
Just leave.

3884
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:03,770
Where did you go?

3885
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:06,310
Just leave.

3886
02:15:08,530 --> 02:15:10,050
Guys, apparently...

3887
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:13,370
Apparently, you can charge your items if you hold Q.

3888
02:15:13,370 --> 02:15:14,690
I just figured it out.

3889
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:16,630
All on my own.

3890
02:15:16,990 --> 02:15:17,990
What do you mean charge them?

3891
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:22,210
If you hold your Q, you can throw them higher.

3892
02:15:22,490 --> 02:15:22,570
Oh.

3893
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:25,030
I just figured it out myself.

3894
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:28,330
That explains why the apple was not like at all a satisfying food.

3895
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,170
Oh.

3896
02:15:29,470 --> 02:15:31,730
Can she still use it?

3897
02:15:31,810 --> 02:15:32,230
Will you die?

3898
02:15:32,630 --> 02:15:35,010
No, I'm still dead.

3899
02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:36,530
I got baited.

3900
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:37,550
I'm still dead.

3901
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:41,510
I got baited.

3902
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:43,050
I was dead for too long.

3903
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:44,470
Where the fuck did you go?

3904
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:44,870
Okay.

3905
02:15:44,990 --> 02:15:45,350
Whatever.

3906
02:15:46,650 --> 02:15:47,390
My defense.

3907
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:48,110
I'm leaving.

3908
02:15:51,290 --> 02:15:52,190
Oh no, no.

3909
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:53,150
Are you fucking kidding me?

3910
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:53,690
I'm out.

3911
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:54,490
Bye.

3912
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:55,730
What the fuck was that?

3913
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:57,830
What the fuck was that?

3914
02:15:57,850 --> 02:15:58,390
Did you see that?

3915
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:00,050
Wait.

3916
02:16:00,070 --> 02:16:01,050
I didn't see that.

3917
02:16:01,130 --> 02:16:02,930
There was something behind her.

3918
02:16:05,890 --> 02:16:06,330
Alright.

3919
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:08,650
We're back.

3920
02:16:09,530 --> 02:16:10,270
We're back.

3921
02:16:10,450 --> 02:16:12,590
Look at that, two dollars of hospital bills.

3922
02:16:12,730 --> 02:16:13,990
We didn't hurt too hard.

3923
02:16:14,210 --> 02:16:15,790
I tried to fall through the world again!

3924
02:16:17,110 --> 02:16:19,610
I defibbed you and you immediately started falling.

3925
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:20,830
Wait, that's what happened?

3926
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:23,310
Your body started falling.

3927
02:16:23,630 --> 02:16:25,330
I was like, I'm back!

3928
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:27,930
And I was like, JK, I'm still dead.

3929
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:30,950
I got baited.

3930
02:16:32,010 --> 02:16:35,970
Yeah, no, I went back to the ship and your body was like...

3931
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:36,870
I was just not here.

3932
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:41,050
Alright, we have really good content for this.

3933
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:43,330
I did save this, so here you go.

3934
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:43,890
Here's your defib.

3935
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:45,150
Oh my god, I'll charge it.

3936
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:46,230
Oh wait, it's fully charged already.

3937
02:16:46,410 --> 02:16:46,690
Nice.

3938
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:49,530
That's good, because defib was like $300.

3939
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:50,910
I couldn't find a flashlight, unfortunately.

3940
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:52,070
It's alright.

3941
02:16:53,390 --> 02:16:54,570
Flashlights are replaceable.

3942
02:16:56,410 --> 02:16:57,350
Don't walk into that.

3943
02:16:58,410 --> 02:16:59,190
Don't walk into that?

3944
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:06,550
I'm going...

3945
02:17:07,490 --> 02:17:09,950
The way you slowly walked there.

3946
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:10,530
I started screaming.

3947
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:15,090
What a world!

3948
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:18,670
My life is flashing before my eyes!

3949
02:17:19,770 --> 02:17:20,810
Thank you.

3950
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,810
I'm feeling brave enough now.

3951
02:17:21,930 --> 02:17:22,830
Alright, let's do this.

3952
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:23,450
Let's do this.

3953
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:25,250
Oh god, help!

3954
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:27,050
I'm so vulnerable!

3955
02:17:29,490 --> 02:17:31,230
This is going to take forever.

3956
02:17:31,330 --> 02:17:31,990
Holy shit.

3957
02:17:32,190 --> 02:17:33,250
I'm so sorry.

3958
02:17:34,590 --> 02:17:35,150
I'm not.

3959
02:17:35,150 --> 02:17:37,130
Looks like you're shooting hoops.

3960
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:38,710
I'm doing basketball.

3961
02:17:39,630 --> 02:17:40,750
There's Goop right here.

3962
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:42,150
He's still in the thing.

3963
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:42,890
There's Goop.

3964
02:17:44,450 --> 02:17:46,110
I was really impressed by that.

3965
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,530
I can't get down from here!

3966
02:17:49,730 --> 02:17:51,350
Guys, we have to get...

3967
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:52,090
Robot!

3968
02:17:52,130 --> 02:17:53,390
The shooting robot on the ground!

3969
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:53,890
He has boots!

3970
02:17:56,510 --> 02:18:00,010
She wanted to get involved in basketball.

3971
02:18:00,490 --> 02:18:00,530
No!

3972
02:18:00,530 --> 02:18:04,070
You missed the part where he threw Doki directly at me and we both died.

3973
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:08,230
Doki collision.

3974
02:18:10,610 --> 02:18:11,050
Doki collision!

3975
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:12,930
They're right behind me, aren't they?

3976
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:16,050
I think someone's playing sick beats.

3977
02:18:16,390 --> 02:18:17,310
You were right.

3978
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:19,070
Holy shit.

3979
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:20,610
Oh my god.

3980
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:21,050
We're so close.

3981
02:18:21,050 --> 02:18:23,350
We got to 30000 meters before I left.

3982
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:24,910
That was close.

3983
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:27,930
You almost crashed the server again.

3984
02:18:28,970 --> 02:18:29,490
Oh, my.

3985
02:18:29,490 --> 02:18:30,170
I forgot about...

3986
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:32,050
That was so scary because you didn't fall for me.

3987
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:33,450
I was so glad you fell.

3988
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:34,370
Yeah.

3989
02:18:34,370 --> 02:18:35,470
I wouldn't even know.

3990
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:37,850
I like the vibrating Han there.

3991
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:40,130
On the fucking monster.

3992
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:41,490
He starts vibrating.

3993
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:46,770
Okay, last day for content.

3994
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:47,870
We gotta make...

3995
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:49,330
We can't die for this one.

3996
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:51,230
Okay, we can't die.

3997
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:51,710
We can't die.

3998
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:52,970
Okay, I got defib.

3999
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:54,810
We need the hugs and the flashlight.

4000
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:56,990
I don't have anything.

4001
02:18:58,230 --> 02:18:59,090
What did we buy?

4002
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:00,030
Blink.

4003
02:19:01,330 --> 02:19:02,090
Flashlight and hugs.

4004
02:19:05,090 --> 02:19:06,010
The jokilision.

4005
02:19:09,670 --> 02:19:10,130
Alright.

4006
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:12,530
We got the hugs.

4007
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:13,510
Are you guys ready?

4008
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:14,590
Last day for content.

4009
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:16,250
Last day.

4010
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:17,730
We can do this.

4011
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:21,610
We can get 325k viewers so easily.

4012
02:19:22,530 --> 02:19:23,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4013
02:19:24,690 --> 02:19:27,710
If our Oshii Logan Paul can do it, so can we.

4014
02:19:31,690 --> 02:19:33,830
What's our Oshii Logan Paul?

4015
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:34,290
Oshii Logan Paul.

4016
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:35,810
Yeah, our Oshii Logan Paul.

4017
02:19:36,150 --> 02:19:38,210
Bro, he's like a millionaire now.

4018
02:19:38,410 --> 02:19:39,290
He owns Prime.

4019
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:43,290
Prime, Prime, Prime, Prime.

4020
02:19:43,690 --> 02:19:44,210
The Amazon?

4021
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:45,490
What?

4022
02:19:47,730 --> 02:19:49,970
Did you just say the Amazon?

4023
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:55,630
Oh my god.

4024
02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:57,250
Oh my god.

4025
02:19:57,770 --> 02:19:58,570
It's the...

4026
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:04,330
Yeah, it is.

4027
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:07,490
Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.

4028
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:09,250
Oh my god.

4029
02:20:09,790 --> 02:20:10,950
Did it hit me?

4030
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:11,830
No!

4031
02:20:12,910 --> 02:20:14,230
Just found the contour.

4032
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:17,340
Uh.

4033
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:23,240
Hey, what's up?

4034
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:24,680
Oh my god, hug me.

4035
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:26,440
Oh my god, do you have the hug?

4036
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,880
I don't know where the camera is.

4037
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,380
No, I saw her.

4038
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:32,740
She was behind us.

4039
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,180
And she was behind us.

4040
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:34,960
Oh my god.

4041
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:38,280
Oh my god, it was either Snuffy or...

4042
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:39,400
We need to go get the camera.

4043
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:41,960
He's camping the room, I can see him.

4044
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:43,740
Okay, okay, I'll stay here.

4045
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:45,960
Okay, no, no, use me as bait.

4046
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:46,380
Wait, wait, wait.

4047
02:20:46,980 --> 02:20:47,380
No!

4048
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,660
It's okay, we can do this.

4049
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,500
I remind you, they took your voice.

4050
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:55,560
Your beautiful voice.

4051
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:57,220
We don't need to know.

4052
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:58,800
We can do this by spirit.

4053
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:00,060
Okay.

4054
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:07,030
Okay.

4055
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:07,550
They don't need...

4056
02:21:07,550 --> 02:21:08,650
She doesn't need my voice.

4057
02:21:10,170 --> 02:21:10,610
Okay.

4058
02:21:10,930 --> 02:21:12,390
We can figure this out.

4059
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:13,350
Okay.

4060
02:21:14,330 --> 02:21:15,390
Okay, here's the plan.

4061
02:21:17,430 --> 02:21:18,350
That's not the plan.

4062
02:21:19,750 --> 02:21:21,030
I can't hear you.

4063
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:23,970
If you can hear me, you keep the items, you stay here.

4064
02:21:24,090 --> 02:21:25,390
I'm gonna make a hero run.

4065
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:25,930
Okay?

4066
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:26,350
Okay.

4067
02:21:26,350 --> 02:21:26,790
Okay, he fucks off.

4068
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:29,190
Okay, okay, okay.

4069
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:29,970
Yeah, fantastic.

4070
02:21:30,370 --> 02:21:31,630
Here we go.

4071
02:21:32,810 --> 02:21:34,850
When he leaves, Jesus Christ.

4072
02:21:34,890 --> 02:21:36,870
I don't think he's gonna leave.

4073
02:21:36,890 --> 02:21:39,830
And you know, if I die, I'll stop moving and then you can come out and res me.

4074
02:21:39,970 --> 02:21:40,430
It'll be great.

4075
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:43,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4076
02:21:44,830 --> 02:21:45,230
Okay.

4077
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:45,650
Bro.

4078
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:48,910
Oh no.

4079
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:50,950
He's camping us.

4080
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:52,990
Why was I here?

4081
02:21:52,990 --> 02:21:53,770
Wait, can you hear someone die?

4082
02:21:56,350 --> 02:21:57,570
Wait, it's the shaker.

4083
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:58,330
What the fuck is that?

4084
02:21:58,450 --> 02:22:00,050
It's the shaker, it's London.

4085
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:02,910
It's London again.

4086
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:07,460
Oh no.

4087
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:09,480
This is our last day too.

4088
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:14,000
It's not leaving.

4089
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:15,860
I kinda wanna open it.

4090
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,240
I wish we could hear you.

4091
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:27,960
Shh.

4092
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:30,920
Sometimes I can still hear your voice.

4093
02:22:31,060 --> 02:22:31,720
Don't talk.

4094
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:33,540
No.

4095
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:35,020
Shh.

4096
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,760
Stop laughing.

4097
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:39,000
Stop laughing.

4098
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:47,660
I don't think they're going to leave.

4099
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:49,140
Stop talking.

4100
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:49,560
Wait.

4101
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:52,700
It's going quiet.

4102
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,240
Why does it sound like one of them is just lying?

4103
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:00,440
Shut the fuck up.

4104
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:00,900
I moved.

4105
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:04,660
Okay.

4106
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:05,440
Okay.

4107
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:07,220
I'm going to go for it.

4108
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:08,320
Let's see.

4109
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:11,140
Neither of them are further than 50 meters away.

4110
02:23:11,420 --> 02:23:13,060
Okay, the camera must be close.

4111
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:14,320
Here we go.

4112
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,700
Here we go.

4113
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,380
Here we go.

4114
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:20,260
I see the fucking Tom Berry.

4115
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:21,280
Okay, wish me luck.

4116
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:22,900
Bye, Doki.

4117
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:23,840
Bye.

4118
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:29,570
Fuck off, you bitch.

4119
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:33,890
Do you think she's alive still?

4120
02:23:35,810 --> 02:23:36,530
Yeah.

4121
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:46,830
Still moving.

4122
02:23:47,610 --> 02:23:49,010
She's still moving.

4123
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:53,330
She's still moving.

4124
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:55,030
I think it's okay.

4125
02:23:55,770 --> 02:23:57,230
No, she's still alive.

4126
02:23:58,830 --> 02:23:59,550
41.

4127
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:03,090
She is still alive.

4128
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:03,390
She's still running.

4129
02:24:03,710 --> 02:24:05,610
She's running really fast right now.

4130
02:24:05,870 --> 02:24:07,670
I think she's getting chased.

4131
02:24:13,190 --> 02:24:13,830
She's...

4132
02:24:14,510 --> 02:24:15,790
Oh, she stopped.

4133
02:24:16,030 --> 02:24:16,750
Wait, no.

4134
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:18,730
Oh, she stopped.

4135
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:23,120
Oh.

4136
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:26,580
No, she stopped.

4137
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:27,120
Stop.

4138
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:28,240
No, she stopped.

4139
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:29,020
Stop.

4140
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:35,740
Yeah, she stopped.

4141
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:36,100
Stop.

4142
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:54,620
She's dead.

4143
02:24:55,420 --> 02:24:56,200
She's dead.

4144
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:58,860
No, she's 100% dead, guys.

4145
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:00,380
She's so dead.

4146
02:25:03,980 --> 02:25:04,500
No!

4147
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:05,240
No!

4148
02:25:13,150 --> 02:25:14,670
Okay, gotta be quiet.

4149
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:31,890
Oh, no, it's the shaker.

4150
02:25:33,070 --> 02:25:33,830
Oh, no.

4151
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:35,850
Oh, no, it's the shaker.

4152
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:38,270
No.

4153
02:25:38,390 --> 02:25:41,850
No, please let me get to them!

4154
02:25:42,390 --> 02:25:44,870
I'm trying to find the camera!

4155
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:45,990
I'm trying to find the camera!

4156
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:48,050
I don't even have hugs!

4157
02:25:50,230 --> 02:25:50,990
I don't even have hugs!

4158
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:52,770
Oh my god.

4159
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:55,090
I don't even have hugs!

4160
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:56,110
This is the last day!

4161
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:14,070
No!

4162
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:18,630
No!

4163
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:26,500
This is the last day!

4164
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:27,120
She's right there!

4165
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:29,940
Yeah...

4166
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:31,300
No!

4167
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:34,600
We failed!

4168
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,700
We failed to gain popularity!

4169
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,600
No!

4170
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:39,860
All my dreams were growing!

4171
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:40,760
My dreams!

4172
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:43,820
My life was made.

4173
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:47,280
I got... What happened to you, LaVuHu?

4174
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,780
Did you get chased by the shaker?

4175
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:52,580
I got chased by two of them.

4176
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:55,240
Two of them were running around in circles shanking me.

4177
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:56,200
Oh my god.

4178
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:58,160
You think this was a good time to call it?

4179
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:01,460
I got the camera but then they shanked me twice.

4180
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:02,400
It was awful.

4181
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:06,060
Guys, it was a great time having you guys as my content team.

4182
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,100
Hell yeah.

4183
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:08,420
I had a great time.

4184
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:13,020
But I think every channel deserves to die at some point.

4185
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,100
We gotta do that at some point.

4186
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:18,680
We gotta do our own solo careers, guys.

4187
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:23,020
We have to break up and do be our own.

4188
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,080
I wanted to do Let's Plays but they didn't want to listen.

4189
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:28,320
We wanted to do solo reviews.

4190
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:32,120
We all gotta separate and make our own channels.

4191
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:34,160
And get our own play button.

4192
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:35,280
Yo, I'll die out there.

4193
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:35,940
No!

4194
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:39,520
You are more than just a group, Hun.

4195
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:41,140
You have a personality.

4196
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:44,240
I don't know how to transition out of this.

4197
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:44,760
I'm gonna die.

4198
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:45,400
No!

4199
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:48,420
My content dried up.

4200
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:53,940
You do not need to be restricted as a group collaborator.

4201
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,020
You can do solo content too.

4202
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:00,060
I'm gonna start streaming.

4203
02:28:00,340 --> 02:28:01,280
Don't make me start streaming.

4204
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:01,620
No!

4205
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:05,520
That was fun.

4206
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:06,520
I had a great time.

4207
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:09,340
Thank you.

4208
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:10,600
You had a great time.

4209
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,120
I'm tired.

4210
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:13,700
It was so nice to meet you, Daimu.

4211
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:16,180
It was wonderful meeting you.

4212
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:17,960
Thank you for coming and hanging out.

4213
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:18,380
Yeah.

4214
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:21,460
I will never hit a million views.

4215
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:24,320
This was like the same area where I died too in my last collab.

4216
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,900
I didn't get past 300.

4217
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:28,220
I didn't get past 300.

4218
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:30,480
It's because that rapper keeps showing up and wiping us.

4219
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,080
Bro, like, how could...

4220
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:35,720
We just got there too and he just showed up.

4221
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:36,820
Oh, my goodness.

4222
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:40,240
He was just like, hey, I'm gonna ruin your whole career.

4223
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:44,300
Yeah, we never got chance to afford a stun gun because we kept dying.

4224
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:47,200
We kept wiping out.

4225
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:48,200
We got so fucked up.

4226
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,800
We got stream sniped to the point we had to get a stun gun.

4227
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,900
We needed protection.

4228
02:28:54,880 --> 02:29:00,180
Guys, we should have hired a bodyguard instead of somebody that fucking hugs.

4229
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:01,020
Guys.

4230
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:03,660
The content is even raw.

4231
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:05,520
The raw content.

4232
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:06,800
People want the emotional.

4233
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:07,640
They want the hugs.

4234
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:08,200
They want the realness.

4235
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:09,680
The realness.

4236
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:13,240
Thank you guys for playing.

4237
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:13,960
Yeah, thank you guys.

4238
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:15,260
GG's everyone.

4239
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,540
Thank you all for joining us too.

4240
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:20,180
I'm going to sleep after this.

4241
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:20,760
Oh, yeah.

4242
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:22,720
You're fucking jet lagged as hell.

4243
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:23,580
Nice meeting you guys.

4244
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:23,960
Nice meeting you guys.

4245
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:26,280
I'll see you guys.

4246
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:26,640
Have a good night.

4247
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:27,200
Bye.

4248
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:27,780
Bye.

4249
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:29,140
Bye.

4250
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:32,840
Oh, my God.

4251
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:35,420
I can't believe it.

4252
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:37,760
We died in the same place.

4253
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:39,820
The same view count.

4254
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:42,340
We're never going to hit a million.

4255
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:44,840
We'll never hit a million.

4256
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:46,340
But it was great.

4257
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:48,620
I had a great time with all of them.

4258
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:51,120
It was really nice to meet Limu for the first time.

4259
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:55,180
Han was extremely jet lagged.

4260
02:29:55,220 --> 02:30:05,060
He was telling us before we started the stream that he was still suffering from jet lag because he hasn't been in NA time zones for a couple of months now.

4261
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:07,920
So he was like, yeah, I should be sleeping right now.

4262
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:09,340
I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

4263
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:10,040
Fine.

4264
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:14,080
But I had a great time.

4265
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:20,960
It was really great meeting Limu and doing a collab with her for the first time.

4266
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:22,120
And it was really fun.

4267
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:23,980
But hey, I was snuffy again too.

4268
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:26,140
Really great chemistry with snuffy.

4269
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:29,300
Oh, my gosh.

4270
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:32,800
That was so funny when YouTube died.

4271
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:34,680
I was like, holy shit.

4272
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:36,800
I was like, oh, my God, I fell off.

4273
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:40,700
I knew eventually I'd fall off.

4274
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:45,720
I was like, what the fuck?

4275
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:46,560
Oh, my God.

4276
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:50,800
I was like, bro, how did I drop from 6K to fucking 200?

4277
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:52,680
And I'm like, I knew it.

4278
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:56,940
It was only a matter of time when I was about to fall off.

4279
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:58,560
I fucking knew it.

4280
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:04,300
I fucking knew it.

4281
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:14,000
Even if I fall off, at least I have you dragoons.

4282
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:15,660
The super dedicated ones.

4283
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:20,960
But it was a great time.

4284
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:24,900
I love how, like, that's so fucked up when, like, you have to pay the chat.

4285
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:26,840
That was so fucked up.

4286
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:30,580
I was like, people were like, we can only chat by super chatting.

4287
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,160
I'm like, oh, my God.

4288
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:33,580
That's so fucked up, bro.

4289
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:34,580
That's so...

4290
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:35,260
YouTube.

4291
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:36,620
YouTube.

4292
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:38,940
Darkblade, thank you for listening to the chat.

4293
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:39,300
Thank you.

4294
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:39,960
Thank you.

4295
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:42,120
That was really funny.

4296
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:43,700
I hope you guys had a great time.

4297
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:46,160
I'm going to call it here, everybody.

4298
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:47,720
My voice is dying.

4299
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:48,900
So I'm going to rest up.

4300
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:50,280
Tomorrow is also a rest day.

4301
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:51,520
So I get to rest a double.

4302
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:55,140
But, yes, I hope you guys enjoyed the collab, everybody.

4303
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:58,580
As always, everyone, stay hydrated.

4304
02:31:58,960 --> 02:31:59,660
Pause to check.

4305
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:02,000
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4306
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:03,560
And if you stay up for me, I'll see you guys later.

4307
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:03,700
Okay.

4308
02:32:04,060 --> 02:32:05,820
Head to bed, because you deserve it.

4309
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:07,000
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4310
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:08,660
Bye, guys.

4311
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:09,700
Bye.

4312
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:10,460
Bye.

4313
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:11,340
Bye.
