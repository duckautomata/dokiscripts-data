1
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,340
Hello everybody.

2
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,660
Hello.

3
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,820
I am alive.

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
Oh my god.

5
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,060
Okay.

6
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,900
I fucked up.

7
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,940
I fucked up.

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,440
Okay.

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,200
So...

10
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,380
So...

11
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,700
Let me tell you about today's schedule.

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,020
So...

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,920
So you guys know...

14
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,920
After this stream, we are going to go straight to another stream.

15
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,600
Because...

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,720
I saw that Tempo...

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,740
He has...

18
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,060
Tempo is literally the main Apex Legends tournament organizer.

19
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,180
For every tournament in Apex.

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,840
So I saw Tempo...

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,540
On Monday.

22
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,020
I was like, oh hey, quiet up.

23
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,140
I was like, hey Tempo, can I join?

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,040
He was like, yeah.

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,100
I thought it says July 20th.

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,560
Because the sign up showed up on Monday.

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,620
So I was like, alright.

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,420
I was like, alright.

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,780
I'm thinking...

30
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm thinking...

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,520
Oh yeah, that Apex Legends tournament...

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,620
That got announced on Monday...

33
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,500
Will be next month.

34
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,700
I thought it says July 29th.

35
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,940
Because usually...

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,560
I thought...

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
Usually it's organized way ahead of time.

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,480
So like...

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,320
Every time...usually in the past when there's sign ups...

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,400
They're not right off this week.

41
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,140
By the way.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,320
So...

43
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:18,900
Because...

44
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
You know how I found out it was today?

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,800
Like...

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,520
I think like 2-3 days...

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
I think like 2 days ago?

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,940
Yeah, it was 2 days ago.

49
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,220
I was like messaging my staff members.

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,160
I was like, hey, do I have anything on July 29th?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,700
I was like, hey, I want to make sure...

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,940
I don't overlap with anything on July 29th.

53
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,000
Because I feel like I have something on July 29th.

54
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
And then they're like...

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
Doki, this says June.

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,540
This is tomorrow.

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,020
I was like...

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,180
Wait, what?

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,400
They're like...

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,320
Because one of my staff members is like...

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,040
Asia.

62
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,600
And then I have another that's like EU.

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,600
And they're like, Doki, this says tomorrow.

64
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,940
Because for them it's tomorrow.

65
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,020
So they're like, that's tomorrow.

66
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,060
I was like, no, it's not.

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,400
It's July.

68
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,840
They're like, no, it's June.

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,160
And I'm like, it's June?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,600
So I was like, oh fuck, okay.

71
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,180
It's June.

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,580
It's literally today.

73
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,940
So I was just like...

74
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,800
Oh fuck.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
It's June 29th.

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,440
It's not July 29th.

77
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,240
So...

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,460
Anyway, this is...

79
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,100
Oh no!

80
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,120
Temple usually when he puts up a sign up sheet...

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,520
The tournament isn't...

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,380
This week.

83
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,860
It's usually like...

84
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,740
Like in two to three weeks.

85
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,100
So in my head I was like...

86
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,280
I didn't even know...

87
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
That hide and seek Nokia shit...

88
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,920
We were signed up like...

89
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
Two months ago for that.

90
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,420
The Nokia hide and seek thing.

91
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,360
I was signed up to that thing...

92
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,400
Two months ago before it happened.

93
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,580
So like...

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,460
In my head...

95
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,340
I was like, there's no way it's this late.

96
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,840
There's no way.

97
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,280
Anyway, I appreciate Temple for inviting me.

98
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,240
Anyway...

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,220
Not so Deadpool.

100
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,100
Thank you for the super chat.

101
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,380
Thank you.

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
New model.

103
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,100
New skin suit.

104
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,920
Still illiterate.

105
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,520
Still the goat.

106
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Never change.

107
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,400
Thank you for the super chat.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,740
Thank you.

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,820
Darkblade.

110
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,740
Thank you for the super chat.

111
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,080
Thank you.

112
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,560
Thank you.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,260
Just like the dragoons.

114
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,700
Thank you for the super chat.

115
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,440
Thank you.

116
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,020
Thank you.

117
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,900
Um...

118
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,340
Anyway...

119
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
Anyway...

120
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,600
So I was just like...

121
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh shit.

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,480
It's...

123
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,100
Today technically.

124
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,820
It's today.

125
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,720
So this is my schedule.

126
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,200
I need you guys to know...

127
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,420
This is what my schedule is like today.

128
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,100
So this...

129
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,860
Whenever it's time for that other thing.

130
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,020
The apex thing.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,380
We go straight to that.

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,500
By the way, I haven't touched apex since the last invitational that I was part of.

133
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Which I mean I did try to warm up like today.

134
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,460
I did two warm up games.

135
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,720
I was like that's good enough.

136
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,400
Um...

137
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,200
And Temple's...

138
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,820
In the sign up sheet for the tournament.

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,880
They're like what rank are you?

140
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,180
Like what's your highest rank?

141
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,120
I put diamond.

142
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,600
Because at that point I was like... I don't...

143
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,780
I haven't touched a game in long ass time.

144
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,300
At least just consider me diamond level at that point.

145
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,060
Anyway...

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,680
Um...

147
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,840
Anyway as I was saying.

148
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,060
After that I have like a little intermission.

149
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,640
Until I have to go to Avcon.

150
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
I have to do Avcon.

151
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,960
Which is the Adelaide convention.

152
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,520
But that is like...

153
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,260
We go around artist alley at Avcon.

154
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,700
And then after going around artist alley at Avcon.

155
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,600
Uh...

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,560
We're going to the paddle.

157
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,280
And after doing the paddle.

158
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,960
We're going to be doing meet and greets.

159
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,040
And after meet and greets I sleep.

160
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,020
And after I sleep we do the Dokomi paddle.

161
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,600
Which is at 7.30 am my time.

162
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,620
Hehehehe.

163
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,560
Poro thank you for the 10k subs.

164
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,540
Thank you.

165
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,080
So my Dokomi paddle is tomorrow.

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
At 7.30 am.

167
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,740
And then after the Dokomi paddle.

168
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,340
We're going to go around the Dokomi artist alley.

169
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,120
And then after that I die.

170
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,300
I pass out.

171
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,780
Hehehehe.

172
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,440
Hehehehe.

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,000
So...

174
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,800
That is my schedule.

175
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
For today.

176
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,860
That is my schedule.

177
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,160
Hehehehe.

178
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,560
It leads all the way.

179
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,660
Till the next day.

180
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,120
Um...

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,340
Yes I...

182
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,720
Did not schedule myself quite well today.

183
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,280
Hehehehe.

184
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,680
I did not.

185
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,540
Because I forgot how to read today.

186
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,040
Hehehehe.

187
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,240
I literally signed up for Tempo's thing.

188
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,640
Because I thought it was next month.

189
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,180
I didn't know it was this week.

190
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,700
I believe I would have said yes.

191
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,820
I would have reached out to Tempo.

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
Anyway but it's going to be a blast.

196
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,500
Like yesterday I did Avcon.

197
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,060
I was at Adelaide.

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,760
Well I wasn't at Adelaide.

199
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,840
I was virtually at Adelaide.

200
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,420
So I did...

201
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,080
I was at Adelaide.

202
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,060
Avcon yesterday.

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,660
So yesterday... Today is going to be day 2 of it.

204
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,140
Yesterday...

205
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,800
Um...

206
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,680
Yesterday we did a...

207
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,140
We couldn't do the gaming session.

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,520
Because apparently the internet died or some shit.

209
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,840
Or like got fucked up during the gaming session.

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,480
So...

211
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,300
We couldn't do the gaming with the...

212
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Dragoons yesterday.

213
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,700
But we did karaoke.

214
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,580
And meet and greets.

215
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Oh my god karaoke.

216
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
There was no feedback.

217
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,560
There was no like audio feedback or anything.

218
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,200
So I had no...

219
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,580
So I was like...

220
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,800
For those who were like no FOMO.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,860
Anyway I'll talk to you guys a bit about the Avcon.

222
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,520
It was so funny.

223
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,040
So I had no audio feedback.

224
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,000
It was literally my very first karaoke slash concert.

225
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,400
For it.

226
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Because I...

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
Because since I had no audio feedback.

228
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,060
I was like...

229
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,220
Thumbs up if it's okay.

230
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,080
Because I can't hear what's going on.

231
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,840
So I was like...

232
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,420
Give me a thumbs up.

233
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,060
If everything is okay.

234
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,280
So all the trackers are giving me thumbs up.

235
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,140
I was like...

236
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,320
Alright cool sweet.

237
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,800
Okay.

238
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,380
There was no...

239
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,300
Yeah so I had no audio feedback.

240
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,200
At first I had no visual feedback.

241
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,580
And then one of the technician guys like got their phone.

242
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,560
Because we are all in this like discord channel.

243
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,440
They got their phone.

244
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,400
And then turned their camera on on their phone.

245
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,400
So I could like...

246
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,120
I was like watching like what's going on.

247
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,640
On like somebody's phone.

248
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,540
Because there is no camera on the stage.

249
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,840
So I was just like...

250
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,540
Alright let's see what's going on.

251
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,360

And walking around with their phone.

253
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,180

254
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,300

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,800
I flew from America.

380
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,220
I was like oh my god.

381
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,860
What the fuck?

382
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,900
I was like wait a minute.

383
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,700
It's for Australian.

384
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,160
Australian dragoons.

385
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,360
How did you get here?

386
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,940
Um.

387
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,120
Um.

388
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,340
It was actually crazy.

389
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,840
I was so happy to meet all the dragoons.

390
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:32,920
Like I said, I went like... I think like when the first guy came over for the meet and greet, they were like, there's a lot of people because it's free.

391
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,020
The meet and greet was free.

392
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,580
Like I don't earn anything from it.

393
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,180
At best I earn from the... there's like exclusive merch at the convention.

394
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,780
Some collector's card or something.

395
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,200
That's like the only thing.

396
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,100
And even then I don't...

397
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,200
I think like I make like $200, I think.

398
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,000
Or $400?

399
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,560
I don't remember.

400
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,620
Because it's like limited amounts.

401
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,480
So like if we sold everything, I would make like around $200 or $400, I think.

402
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:03,160
But like the... I just wanted like just something a little bit like a little momentum of like conventions.

403
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,420
And something from the conventions and stuff.

404
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,140
But like... what was I gonna say?

405
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,600
But yes, anyway.

406
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,980
The meet and greet was free.

407
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,660
And it was just like you just line up.

408
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,960
That's really it.

409
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,760
For Avcon.

410
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,780
And basically when the first Dragoon was there for the meet and greet.

411
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,820
I was like, how many people are there?

412
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,680
And he was like, oh like 50.

413
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,760
I was like, what the fuck?

414
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,100
And this was day one.

415
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,460
There's gonna be a day two for a meet and greet.

416
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,300
And then they're like, there's like around like 50.

417
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,240
And then they like took the webcam and like showed me the line.

418
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,760
I was like, oh my god.

419
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,280
How is there so...

420
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,260
It's Adelaide.

421
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm sorry for people who live in Adelaide.

422
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,340
But like we were all...

423
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,620
Okay.

424
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,220
You were joking with me.

425
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,900
You guys said it to me first.

426
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,640
A lot of the Adelaide Australian Dragoons were like, why are you here?

427
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,640
It's Adelaide.

428
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,950
A lot of the Australian Dragoons were like, why are you here?

429
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,810
Like we were so...

430
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,950
They're like, I'm surprised you're here.

431
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,830
It was apparently Adelaide.

432
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,050
It was like, why are you here?

433
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,030
It's like a small city compared to...

434
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,910
Um...

435
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,590
Compared to like Sydney or Melbourne.

436
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,250
And I was just like, well, they invited me so I'm here.

437
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,670
Oh my god.

438
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,770
It was more than 50.

439
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,350
I don't know.

440
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,570
I don't know how many Dragoons I met, but I went an hour overtime.

441
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,790
Cause like, uh, when it was like supposed to end, one of the staff members was like, are you able to go overtime?

442
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,550
Because there's like 20 plus more Dragoons in line.

443
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,110
They're like, we cut it off now.

444
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,370
But like, there's still 20.

445
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,130
And I was just like, you know what you guys, there's 20 plus Dragoons like lined up for an hour.

446
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,730
I feel so bad turning them away after an hour.

447
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,610
So, uh, so I went on for longer than I think I went out for two hours and a half.

448
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,650
I don't, I don't remember.

449
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,490
I was so tired by the end.

450
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:17,530
After, after the meet and greet, I like, I don't, I just, I just went to bed.

451
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,690
I didn't do it.

452
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,530
No, I made my bed.

453
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,030
I made my waiting room after the meet and greet.

454
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,790
And then I went to bed.

455
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,250
Um, but it was very fun.

456
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,530
I had like an amazing time.

457
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,810
I felt bad because sometimes I'm the reason why like people, okay.

458
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,050
Cause like, I think it was like three minutes.

459
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,410
They changed it a bit because they didn't realize how many Australian Dragoons were going to be there.

460
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,270
I was so surprised too, because like, um, I know like VTubers don't come to Australia a lot.

461
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,470
Um, especially for like meeting.

462
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,230
And greets and stuff.

463
00:17:51,450 --> 00:18:01,890
Uh, so like, uh, had a lot of Australian Dragoons that were like, oh my God, you were like the first VTuber we've I've ever met because like nobody comes here, especially Adelaide.

464
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,810
I'm like, yeah, that's why it's a world tour.

465
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,330
It's a world tour.

466
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,950
I wanted to be everywhere.

467
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:25,810
And, um, um, um, it was really fun though being, and then being able to meet so many Dragoons.

468
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,910
And like, like I said, like, uh, one person flew from like, they're like Australian.

469
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,930
One person flew out from outside of Adelaide.

470
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,690
And they, they're like, they like to me, they were like, I'm so tired.

471
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,410
I just got here today.

472
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,390
And then after this meet and greet, I'm flying back.

473
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,990
And I'm like, what?

474
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,050
Oh my God.

475
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,870
For me?

476
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,550
I was like, put on a pack.

477
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,020
Anyway, like one of the Australian dragons literally like flew in on the day.

478
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,600
Like they arrived in the morning.

479
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:11,960
Um, they arrived in the morning and then they like did all the, you know, the karaoke, the, uh, the karaoke and then the meet and greet.

480
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,940
And they're like, yeah, I'm flying back after this meet and greet.

481
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm like, oh my God.

482
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,900
Oh my God.

483
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,600
Thank you.

484
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,060
I felt bad because.

485
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,340
Like, like majority of the, the, the meet and greet, it was just like me yapping.

486
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,980
And then, and then the staff members like, time's up.

487
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,300
I was like, oh, oh no, I didn't let you talk.

488
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
Like, I'm sorry.

489
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,580
I'll just be like, hey, and stuff.

490
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
Hey, you're almost done.

491
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,700
And I'm like, oh my God.

492
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,140
What do you want to say?

493
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,760
I'm sorry.

494
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,360
What do you want to say?

495
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:52,840
Hey, you're almost done.

496
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,700
Hey, you're almost done.

497
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,140
Hey, you're almost done.

498
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,040
Hey, you're almost done.

499
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,100
Hey, you're almost done.

500
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,380
Hey, you're almost done.

501
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,040
But yeah, that was, that was basically, uh, AvCon so far for me.

502
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,240
Um, but yes, it's been, it's been great so far.

503
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,780
Uh, definitely having a lot.

504
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,760
I love doing conventions.

505
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,040
Cause you know, I get to see you guys.

506
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,060
Like I could touch you, like put faces to your names.

507
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,480
And even though like, I'm going to forget your, I'm, I'm not a face person.

508
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,220
I just need you guys to know that like, uh, sometimes I forget faces because I'm, you know, I mean, I'm illiterate as fuck.

509
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,800
But like in the moment I'll get to see, put a face to your name.

510
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,400
No, I've actually like, I've, I've actually forgotten like classmates faces at points too.

511
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,620
Um, because like, uh, I don't know.

512
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,900
I'm just not a face person.

513
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,440
I'm a name person, not a face person.

514
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Like I've, they'll be like, I'll be like, who's that.

515
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,920
And then out.

516
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,420
And I see them as like, I still don't know.

517
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,000
Who it is.

518
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,600
And then they'll say the name and I was like, oh, that guy, I remember him.

519
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,980
So I, I literally can't remember.

520
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,020
I like, I don't know.

521
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm very forgetful when it comes to faces.

522
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,380
Okay.

523
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,560
I realized like, we're sort of like very off topic for the first 22 minutes.

524
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:20,120
Uh, because we're sort of on a tight, a little bit of a tight schedule right now, since we're after this, we had to go straight to the apex shit.

525
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,780
Uh, so behind the scenes of the skin suit reveal.

526
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:35,480
Um, it was, uh, for the, uh, artists and, um, team, uh, my team that's working on this.

527
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
We're wondering, oh, what can I, and cannot post.

528
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,520
Uh, I'll write this in the server.

529
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,320
I know that some of you guys are watching this right now.

530
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:50,260
Um, basically you guys, even if I don't show the work that you guys gave me, um, also I didn't really, I didn't like save everything.

531
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah.

532
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,380
So I saved everything that are behind the scenes.

533
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,260
Channel, but I didn't say like look back.

534
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,280
I was so busy guys.

We are gonna have a I'm gonna make a whitelist in the membership post.

546
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,980
And like I'm gonna have a mod start whitelisting people.

547
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:00,440
But yes, the Minecraft server is finally finally gonna be up next week after so long.

548
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,440
There was a they actually I think they gave me did they give me a refund?

549
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,080
I was so surprised.

550
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,300
I need to look at that.

551
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,320

I need to look this up.

553
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,360
Cuz I think they actually they were like they felt really bad and they're like we're gonna give you a refund.

554
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,060
I was like, oh my god what?

This is like oh, yeah, they're gonna give me a partial refund for The server because they felt they never they had a they were like we're so sorry like we never had to delay a project For this long, so then they gave me a partial refund.

556
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,820

557
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,500

Alright, anyway.

607
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,280
So you guys can see the left side where I'm gonna put some behind the scenes stuff.

608
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,860
Um...

609
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,140
Oh, I'm really... I'm tired.

610
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,880
Today is a long day.

611
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,020
Alright.

612
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,220
Okay, so I wanna show you guys.

613
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,780
This debut...

614
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,980
I'm not gonna tell you guys like the price of everything in the public stream.

615
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,600
I finally calculated everything.

616
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,040
Well, I didn't calculate everything.

617
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,800
So like, when you... I do everything via PayPal.

618
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,620
So, the thing is there's like money out in the PayPal.

619
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,320
And even then there's like some stuff that doesn't show up.

620
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:14,760
Cause you know like...

621
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,200
The...

622
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:15,880
The...

623
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,860
The skin suit, the rigging and everything.

624
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
That was like done...

625
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,960
Like maybe like a couple of months ago.

626
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,460
And uh...

627
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,820
Because of that it doesn't show up.

628
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,200
But then you can see money out.

629
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,100
And then I saw money out.

630
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,420
And I was like...

631
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,720
Oh my god.

632
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,820
And then there's some people that haven't even sent me invoices yet.

633
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,780
I have some people and there's some I haven't paid invoices yet.

634
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,040
And I was like...

635
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
Oh my god.

636
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,360
LOL

637
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,180
So...

638
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,940
So...

639
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,540
So...

640
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:55,620
So...

641
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,300
Don't worry, people.

642
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,920
In that member's stream you'll see how many...

643
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,840
How much it was.

644
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,300
Cause like I'll have a stream and I'll be like trigger warning financial...

645
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,420
Poor financial decisions.

646
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,400
LOL

647
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,320
Because like I said, there was no budget going in.

648
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,620
I was just like, whatever, you guys.

649
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
Like, here's a blank check.

650
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,220
Here's a fucking blank check.

651
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,400
Go wild.

652
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:37,660
And then I realized maybe telling people here's a blank check, go wild, is not the best idea.

653
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,040
Anyway, um...

654
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,980
Okay, so...

655
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:57,880
This debut has been planned for like two and a half months, I believe.

656
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:07,820
The reason... It wasn't sooner because like, I had to like, I guess like, figure out some stuff.

657
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,400
And also like, you know, my skin suit wasn't really done done by then.

658
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,440
Um, so there was like a lot of stuff I had to figure out myself.

659
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,300
Like, what I exactly want.

660
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,260
By two and a half months, I sort of finalized like, exactly the idea.

661
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,160
So I'm gonna show you guys like, uh...

662
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,600
My initial prompt.

663
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,260
This is basically like, what I wrote.

664
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,120
Like, the very first thing I, uh...

665
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,840
I wrote to people.

666
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,400
So I was like...

667
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,380
So the whole debut...

668
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,880
Is based off of...

669
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,580
So this is my...

670
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,300
My pitch, basically.

671
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,040
Where...

672
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,860
Uh, the...

673
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,300
What the entire team saw.

674
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,100
And like, what we're building off on.

675
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,260
Um...

676
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,940
So like I said, it's like, basically my...

677
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,180
Yeah.

678
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,080
TLDR.

679
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,280
This is my pitch.

680
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,760
There's more, by the way.

681
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,000
If you guys were like, TLDR...

682
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,060
There's more.

683
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,680
This is basically the...

684
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,740
The pitch I gave to the team.

685
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,100
And to like, the animators and everything.

686
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,920
Of, um...

687
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,660
By the way!

688
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,820
In this pitch, I didn't even include the animation pitch too.

689
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,580
Because I made a separate pitch for the animator.

690
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,500
Because this doesn't include the animation.

691
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,800
This is like, the gaming area.

692
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,000
Of...

693
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,280
Of everything.

694
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,140
So, um...

695
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,500
So like, in this...

696
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,760
This is just a gaming pitch.

697
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,380
Of the like, overlay.

698
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,420
Of the gaming overlay.

699
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,660
Like, Dokiverse and everything.

700
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,540
Um...

701
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,760
And the animation had its own...

702
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,000
Very own...

703
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,880
Uh...

704
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,300
Very own like...

705
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,000
Pitch itself.

706
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,820
That was even...

707
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,300
That was like, also pretty long.

708
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,340
That was like, several paragraphs as well.

709
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,800
So basically, this is how it all started.

710
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,340
Like, I'm not even gonna read this.

711
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,940
Because it is definitely TLDR.

712
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,620
But...

713
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,160
Uh...

714
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,200
I had this idea...

715
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,000
For...

716
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,100
A year.

717
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,400
I've had this idea.

718
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,860
I've always...

719
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,940
I wanted to do this...

720
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,280
For a year.

721
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,160
Um...

722
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,220
So this was like...

723
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,380
Because this was a super duper...

724
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,380
Ambitious...

725
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,060
Project.

726
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,440
Um...

727
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
I think the reason why...

728
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
I also didn't do this...

729
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,200
I didn't...

730
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,080
I had it on the back burner.

731
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,620
Because I've had like...

732
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,340
Um...

733
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,600
I had like, several ideas...

734
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,940
That I put on back burners.

735
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,080
And then I'll be like...

736
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,140
Do I have the money for this type deal?

737
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:43,960
Uh...

738
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,260
Hahahaha...

739
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,900
And I...

740
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,760
I was like...

741
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,440
I don't really think I have the funding for this yet.

742
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,860
So I would just put it...

743
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,480
I have like, several ideas that...

744
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,340
That's in my brain.

745
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,720
That's like...

746
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,760
Been in the back burner.

747
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,700
And...

748
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,180
Uh...

749
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,680
And everything.

750
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,660
Um...

751
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,420
So now...

752
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,940
When I finally decided to do this idea...

753
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,440
I was like...

754
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,740
I have enough money...

755
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,460
To like...

756
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,900
Be like...

757
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,540
No budget.

758
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Go wild.

759
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,300
Hahahaha...

760
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,660
Cause like...

761
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,320
I felt like...

762
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,360
This idea...

763
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
This...

764
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,020
Um...

765
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,060
This idea that I had...

766
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,880
Um...

767
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,680
For it...

768
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,920
Was incredibly ambitious.

769
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,360
And I knew that this would require...

770
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,260
A lot...

771
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,800
A lot...

772
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,780
A lot of money.

773
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,900
Um...

774
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,300
So...

775
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,760
I never really did it.

776
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,140
I always kept it...

777
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,120
I had like...

778
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,300
I actually had...

779
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,220
A...

780
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,080
Um...

781
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,720
What's the word?

782
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,000
I had a...

783
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,580
Low budget...

784
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
Lower budget...

785
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,000
Like an actual budget plan.

786
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,600
To...

787
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,240
For a...

788
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,160
Lower...

789
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,580
I guess like a lower tier version of this.

790
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,740
Like not as...

791
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,260
Not as ambitious.

792
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,560
But like more budget friendly.

793
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,020
Um...

794
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
But...

795
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,320
Uh...

796
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,940
It was never actually implemented.

797
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,420
Um...

798
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,640
So I'm happy that...

799
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,440
Now...

800
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,800
I have the money...

801
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,880
And the funding...

802
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,260
To do like the actual full plan.

803
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,520
Of this project.

804
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,500
Um...

805
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,700
Because like I said...

806
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,300
It definitely had...

807
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,580
Uh...

808
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,220
It had a lot of elements playing into it.

809
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:14,680
Uh...

810
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
It was...

811
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,920
Yeah...

812
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,980
Oh my gosh...

813
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,300
There's so many...

814
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,120
By the way...

815
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,500
This is not related to behind the scenes.

816
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,660
But I wanted to show you guys...

817
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,080
New emotes by the way.

818
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,240
New emotes!

819
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,720
Uh...

820
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,120
I won't be getting these until...

821
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,800
Uh...

822
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,740
Dokomi is over.

823
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,400
Because the artist is at Dokomi.

824
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,020
At the moment.

825
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,780
So...

826
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,900
So...

827
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,400
New emotes guys!

828
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,120
It's gonna...

829
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,580
Uh...

830
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,500
We're gonna have the emotes...

831
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,620
Like maybe like next week I think.

832
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,000
When the artist...

833
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,560
Um...

834
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,620
Is back from Dokomi.

835
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,940
And uh...

836
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,900
And sends these files to me.

837
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Uh...

838
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,620
My favorite is...

839
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,140
The...

840
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,000
The fifth one.

841
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,940
Uh...

842
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,600
The fifth one is...

843
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,200
Is my favorite so far.

844
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,800
Because we never had the fifth one before.

845
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,380
But...

846
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,000
I was like...

847
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,460
I want to get this.

848
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,660
I want this type of emote.

849
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,380
I want despair.

850
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,620
I want...

851
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:12,960
Yes.

852
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,100
We're gonna have map again guys.

853
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,100
Um...

854
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,820
Classic map emote.

855
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,560
Where I'm like...

856
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,580
Where the fuck are we guys?

857
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,420
Where...

858
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,360
Where are we?

859
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,780
I don't know where...

860
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,080
I don't know how to read the map.

861
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,220
Where are we?

862
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,380
Also I need to remember to remove the screenshots guys.

863
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,720
Because uh...

864
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,500
I'm so worried my OPS might crash.

865
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,260
Hahaha.

866
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,660
I need to remember to remove...

867
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,700
I need to remember to remove the screenshots.

868
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,260
Instead of dragging it in.

869
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:43,980
Alright.

870
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,360
Anyway.

871
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,360
Sorry.

872
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,420
I really had to...

873
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,340
I really wanted to show that to you guys.

874
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,280
Because...

875
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,840
Um...

876
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,740
Before...

877
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,820
Before...

878
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,580
Before...

879
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,280
Uh...

880
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,260
We go to real behind the scenes.

881
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,020
Oh my god.

882
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,380
30 minutes has already passed.

883
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,180
And we haven't really went to behind the scenes.

884
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,360
I'm so sorry.

885
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,940
I'm so sorry.

886
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,080
I just...

887
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,700
I just...

888
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,340
I just want to talk to you guys.

889
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,260
Chat.

890
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,460
Chat.

891
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
I just wanted to talk to you guys.

892
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,560
Hahaha.

893
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,600
I can't help yapping.

894
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,340
Um...

895
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,680
What else did I want to say?

896
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:15,900
Shit.

897
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,160
Okay.

898
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,520
Sorry.

899
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,440
There was like something else I really want to talk about.

900
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,300
Before we actually get into the...

901
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,900
Uh...

902
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,840
The meat of things.

903
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,500
Fuck.

904
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,040
What was it?

905
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,700
Hahaha.

906
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm trying to...

907
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,840
I'm trying to remember right now.

908
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,320
Fuck.

909
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,480
What was it?

910
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,480
Oh shit.

911
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:29,960
Sorry guys.

912
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,700

913
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,240

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,620
Okay.

916
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,480
Alright.

917
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,420

918
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,860

919
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:35,940
Sorry.

920
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,540
I had to check in with the quads thing.

921
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,960
Um...

922
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,060
Oh my gosh.

923
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,540
Sorry.

924
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,120
I need to remember.

925
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,040
I need to remember what it is I wanted to talk about regarding emotes.

926
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,220
What the fuck was it?

927
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,580
What?

928
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:49,800
What?

929
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,360
Hahaha.

930
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,620
Hahaha.

931
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,320
I actually did write some notes down.

932
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,120
Oh my god.

933
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,860
Oh yeah.

934
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,180
Yeah.

935
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,400
Yeah.

936
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,200
Oh yes.

937
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,560
Yes.

938
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,880
Yes.

939
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,540
Intro will be done soon.

940
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,380
Intro.

941
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,440
New intro.

942
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,760
I'm going to give you guys a sneak peek to the new intro.

943
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,720
Okay.

944
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,360
I didn't save it but don't worry.

945
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,220
I am a bug.

946
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,660
Oh!

947
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,580
Anime emotes!

948
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,340
I'm so happy because I'm going to be working with the person who did my old animated emotes.

949
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,800
So if you guys remember the classic anime emotes that we had.

950
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,200
It's going to be animated by the same person.

951
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:28,960
I was really happy because I found the Twitter and it was last known activity a year ago.

952
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,500
I was like, where did he go?

953
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,220
Hahaha.

954
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,800
Wait.

955
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,780
Hahaha.

956
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,680
Hahaha.

957
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,100
Hahaha.

958
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,100
I was just like, where did he go?

959
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,560
So I had like backup.

960
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,860
I was like researching backup animators for emotes.

961
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
And I had like five tabs.

962
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
I had five tabs open of their Twitter.

963
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,100
Twitter and stuff.

964
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,020
And then I think like two days ago they were like, oh yeah.

965
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,640
Oh yeah.

966
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,260
Because like I like DM them and I had their Discord.

967
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,060
Like I remember their Discord username.

968
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,180
So then I like added them on Discord.

969
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,080
I was like, oh yeah.

970
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,440
I was like, are you, are you alive?

971
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,560
Hahaha.

972
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,400
And they were like, yeah.

973
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,040
Like I could still add, I can animate your, I would love to animate your emotes again.

974
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,280
Like, but like, are you okay with, we can't do it.

975
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,900
We still have some people we have to animate for and like, I'm not doing it full time anymore.

976
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,880
But like, are you okay with waiting?

977
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,480
I'm like, yeah, I'm okay with waiting.

978
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,300
Because I really liked how they...

979
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,300
Hahaha.

980
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,180
Hahaha.

981
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,600
Hahaha.

982
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,900
I really loved their, their animation.

983
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,060
I really loved their animation.

984
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:41,100
If you guys remember how the monkey looked like before, like it's honestly one of my favorite animated emotes.

985
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,540
So, and also, oh, the cheer too.

986
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,800
The cheer was really pretty.

987
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,120
So I was really happy that, you know, they're still alive on the internet.

988
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:56,060
And it might be a while before we're going to get animated emotes back again.

989
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,340
But like, I'm just happy that, you know, they're still around.

990
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm just happy they're still, they're still around.

991
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,320
I don't know.

992
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,060
Cause it's like...

993
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:13,720
You know, it's like, oh man, when you find the person you like working with and you just, you don't want to work with someone different because you're so used to working with them.

994
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,200
Um, boy, thank you for the super chat.

995
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,520
Thank you.

996
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,020
Thank you.

997
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,680
If I make a cardboard cutout of Doki, should I call her Doki board?

998
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,380
Honestly, it looks pretty swaad.

999
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,540
But yes, it'll be really cool though.

1000
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,920
If you make a Doki cutout.

1001
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1002
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,240
Thank you.

1003
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,820
Thank you.

1004
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:39,260
Um, but yes, anyway, as I was saying, okay, let me grab the, uh, let me, uh, grab the, uh, the, uh, okay, I need to download.

1005
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,240
Download time.

1006
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,220
All right.

1007
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,080
I don't know if there's audio.

1008
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,380
If there's audio, that'd be awkward.

1009
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,320
But yes, here's, here you go.

1010
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,400
Here's a sneak peek of the new intro.

1011
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,660
Um, they'll be done, I think like by the end of the month.

1012
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,100
Uh, yeah.

1013
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,620
Oh shit.

1014
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,760
I'm sorry if it's loud.

1015
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,820
Uh, I think it's this.

1016
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,120
Yeah.

1017
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,440
We'll loop it.

1018
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,160
Yeah.

1019
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Dad is here.

1020
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,040
Dad is here.

1021
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,720
Yeah.

1022
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,000
Dad's gonna be here.

1023
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,760
Um, but yes, uh, this is a sneak peek of the new intro.

1024
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,760
I decided to have both dad and you guys there with me.

1025
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,400
Cause they were at first, they were just, they removed the Dragoon.

1026
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,960
And I was like, no, the Dragoon will be with us.

1027
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,720
So whenever that's done, we'll be, uh, whenever.

1028
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,100
The reason why it took so long was that we were trying to figure out the background.

1029
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:47,060
Um, like there was a lot of like background possibilities, but honestly I did not like any of the newer backgrounds.

1030
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:57,360
And, um, I feel really bad cause I made the animator go through like lots and lots of variations for the background.

1031
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,540
So like here was some of them, by the way, this is not just the only, uh, the only background.

1032
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,780
That they sent me.

1033
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:19,640
And I honestly, I honestly thought out of all of them, the original background color, uh, with the old skin suit, uh, looked the best overall.

1034
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:26,540
Because, um, because like, um, I wanted to make sure like everybody popped out.

1035
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,920
So like, I know some of you are like, oh, but I looked six, like six though.

1036
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,380
But like dad blends into six way too much.

1037
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:49,140
So, um, and also like we try to play around with three and four and, um, it was just not, it did not look as appealing as I would have liked.

1038
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,060
Um, that's why, that's why I went with, uh, went with seven.

1039
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,220
I went, I kept the classic because like I understand like six, I and the Dragoon pop up a lot.

1040
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,360
But dad blended in way too much.

1041
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,080
So I was like, uh, gotta go.

1042
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,560
So and seven and the classic one, everybody, um, everybody looked good.

1043
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,740
Ha-hahaha.

1044
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,760
I want to make sure that everybody is good.

1045
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,580
Um, that's why that's why I was like, uh, that's why, uh, it took a while.

1046
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,600
It took, they were, this could have been ready, like the day after debut.

1047
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,380
But then I was like, background color.

1048
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,420
Heheheh.

1049
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,340
Lalala.

1050
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,320
LOL.

1051
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,640
Alright, background colors!

1052
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,640
And then we played around with background colors for so long.

1053
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,100
And then I was like, I'm sorry.

1054
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,240
I just like the original.

1055
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,120
I'm sorry.

1056
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,740
I'm sorry for making you do so many background colors.

1057
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm sorry.

1058
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,880
Richu, thank you for the Akasupa.

1059
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,220
Thank you, thank you.

1060
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,160
All for bad financial decisions.

1061
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,000
Love new skin suit.

1062
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,640
The flesh bang is my favorite.

1063
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,960
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1064
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,380
Thank you, thank you.

1065
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,480
I think my favorite is just how fluid everything... I'm just so not used to it.

1066
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:22,260
I'm so not used to how fluid the rigging is, honestly.

1067
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,600
It's actually crazy.

1068
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,320
It's so...

1069
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,020
Oh my gosh.

1070
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,180
It's insane.

1071
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,540
I'm so used to barely moving.

1072
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,360
It is...

1073
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,240
It's actually...

1074
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,720
Like I can't...

1075
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,600
Sometimes I just can't stop looking at myself because I was like, damn.

1076
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,500
Fuck, I'm hot.

1077
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,940
Alright, anyway.

1078
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,660
Actual!

1079
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,160
Sorry.

1080
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,020
Now we're at the real...

1081
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,080
I'm so sorry.

1082
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,200
We're at the real...

1083
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,360
Behind the scenes.

1084
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,580
So there was one thing that I really wanted to show you guys.

1085
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,100
I'm gonna see if I can find...

1086
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,440
Where I saved it.

1087
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,300
Okay, it's a mess.

1088
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,780
A lot of this stuff is like super messy right now because I just...

1089
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,620
Just like right-click saved everything.

1090
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:20,380
So I'm gonna see if I can find this concept art that I really, really wanted to show you guys.

1091
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,120
Because this concept art...

1092
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,700
I...

1093
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,480
I don't know if you guys remember it.

1094
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,520
But...

1095
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,240
Uh...

1096
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,000
There was a concept art where...

1097
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,920
Uh...

1098
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,300
Where I showed you guys a tomato.

1099
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,220
Uh...

1100
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,000
Do you guys...

1101
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,440
Do you guys remember that?

1102
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,460
Yes,

1103
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,600
do you guys remember the...

1104
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,460
Uh...

1105
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,320
The tomato from...

1106
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,980
That I showed?

1107
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,540
And I was like, I love this.

1108
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,620
This tomato shit is like my favorite thing so far.

1109
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:00,500
Um...

1110
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,280
That tomato was actually concept art for...

1111
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,120
Uh...

1112
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,400
One of the sketches that it was supposed to be.

1113
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,500
We had a lot of concept sketches regarding like the splash art.

1114
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:20,000
And it sucked because honestly it was like one of the hardest decisions to make.

1115
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,200
And because the splash...

1116
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,100
We had so many splash screen alternatives.

1117
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,500
It was actually...

1118
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,200
Um...

1119
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh my gosh.

1120
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,500
I'm gonna try to find it right now.

1121
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,180
I'm trying to find...

1122
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,900
Okay, here it is.

1123
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,020
Oh yeah, this is from Kleia.

1124
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,020
So...

1125
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,780
Okay.

1126
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:38,840
So...

1127
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,700
Okay, so...

1128
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,500
I'm sorry.

1129
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,580
I'm looking at it.

1130
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,440
Do you guys see a familiar face right here?

1131
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,500
Okay.

1132
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,380
Anyway.

1133
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,580
So the tomato actually came from...

1134
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,660
From that splash art.

1135
00:46:59,500 --> 00:46:59,660
Um...

1136
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,580
And that's why I was like, guys, I love this.

1137
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,520
I wish there was so many choices.

1138
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,320
There was one where we ride a dragon.

1139
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,820
It was so good.

1140
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,520
It was so difficult.

1141
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,300
Guys, this has to be like one of the most difficult...

1142
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,080
Uh...

1143
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,580
Choice.

1144
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,860
Like I went with three.

1145
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,780
Because the reason why...

1146
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,280
Like...

1147
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:19,560
Okay.

1148
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,300
So...

1149
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,320
Um...

1150
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,600
So...

1151
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,140
Uh...

1152
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,440
For this concept art...

1153
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,300
Um...

1154
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,920
I had to make sure that...

1155
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,480
For this concept art...

1156
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,420
For this thing is...

1157
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,000
The concept art has a lot of varieties going in.

1158
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,560
And so...

1159
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,000
I wanted to make sure like each cons...

1160
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,280
Each splash art...

1161
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,960
Each splash art is a different theme.

1162
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,260
So we were...

1163
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,480
Had already had like a splash art dedicated to...

1164
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,000
Uh...

1165
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,660
The new look.

1166
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,720
Which was like the fire.

1167
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,420
The fire in the background.

1168
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,300
And then we had one that was dedicated to the tomato.

1169
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,520
Like the one where like you were holding the tomato.

1170
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,560
And then we had one of the...

1171
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,640
We had a shooting one scene.

1172
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,620
And then we had like another like relaxing scene.

1173
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,560
So I thought...

1174
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,420
So in the end we picked three.

1175
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,080
Because it was like something we didn't have.

1176
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,880
We didn't have like a...

1177
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,780
Alt Doki scene yet.

1178
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,640
And we didn't have like a concert.

1179
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,360
Like you know like maybe like a concert.

1180
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,340
Uh...

1181
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:15,900
Patch.

1182
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,600
The cosmetic.

1183
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,720
So...

1184
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,360
Um...

1185
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,700
And there wasn't all...

1186
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,320
Yeah there was one with all the dragoons and everything.

1187
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,700
So it was really difficult because...

1188
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,800
We had so many different...

1189
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,120
We had...

1190
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,640
I needed to make sure...

1191
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,580
Um...

1192
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,120
There was a lot of variations...

1193
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,040
Of the splash art.

1194
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,060
Because like...

1195
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,420
Oh my gosh.

1196
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,680
All of these look amazing.

1197
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,100
But we already had a lot of concepts with the other four.

1198
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,860
And I was like...

1199
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,660
Okay we didn't have a concert scene yet.

1200
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,740
So that's why I picked three.

1201
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,340
But oh my god.

1202
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:46,680
Okay.

1203
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,320
But yes.

1204
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,240
That is where the tomato comes from.

1205
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,820
Like the...

1206
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,380
The...

1207
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,120
The tomato right?

1208
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:52,780
Yeah.

1209
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,440
So...

1210
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,940
I wish we went with one just for the tomato.

1211
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,100
But...

1212
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,420
I think one was my favorite when it came to like...

1213
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,220
Um...

1214
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,320
Just for that face.

1215
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,880
That was my favorite.

1216
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,060
Alright so...

1217
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,020
This is another concept we had.

1218
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,300
Um...

1219
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,220
So this one.

1220
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:16,940
Um...

1221
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,600
This one was also...

1222
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:19,940
Um...

1223
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,260
Um...

1224
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,720
Another for the splash art.

1225
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,100
As you see we got B2.

1226
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,720
B2 was the one we ended up with in the end.

1227
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,080
Um...

1228
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,640
So that was like B1.

1229
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,380
B...

1230
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,740
I thought it would be B2.

1231
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,740
I picked...

1232
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,780
A2 and B2.

1233
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,160
I didn't pick A1.

1234
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,440
Like I said we already had the concept art with...

1235
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:39,800
Uh...

1236
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,040
We already had the splash art with like...

1237
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,440
Alt.

1238
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:42,820
Girl.

1239
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,400
Doki.

1240
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,520
With...

1241
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:44,800
Uh...

1242
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,340
The concert.

1243
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,340
And then we had A3.

1244
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,400
I didn't choose A3 because we already had one where like there's a shooting scene for A3.

1245
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,940
So that was like either A2 or B2.

1246
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,700
And then...

1247
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:04,460
We went with B2 in the end because like I said, we wanted a little teaser for when the patch goes live.

1248
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,480
And then the teaser in the background and stuff like that.

1249
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,420
There were so... I told you guys, there were so many concepts that we ended up not doing.

1250
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,100
Because all the artists, they would draw a bunch of concepts all together.

1251
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,620
And then we had to pick one because there was just enough time for one or two if we're lucky.

1252
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,500
One or two for the splash art.

1253
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,260
And it's one of the hardest decisions to make, honestly.

1254
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,560
I think this was like... the splash art was like the hardest decision to make.

1255
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,840
Because I had to make sure everything was like balanced well.

1256
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,540
And like there's like enough... like there's enough variations to stuff.

1257
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,860
Alright, here's another one that I'll show you guys.

1258
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,260
Like I think we had like so many artists in splash art.

1259
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,580
So I have so many to show.

1260
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,160
So here's another... here's some other concepts that we have.

1261
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,800
Oh my gosh.

1262
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,140
One was so good.

1263
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,700
So we had all of these.

1264
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,640
They were all really, really...

1265
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,200
Like I said, they were all so good.

1266
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,460
It was so difficult to pick.

1267
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:15,620
We went with five in the end because we didn't have anything related with the tomato yet.

1268
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,740
So we went with five because...

1269
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,180
Because we were like, okay, we should...

1270
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,920
We should get something related to tomato.

1271
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,680
Because it makes sense.

1272
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,500
And then I didn't want to do six because I was like, okay, so the anime trailer...

1273
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,180
The anime trailer had already had like something to do with cowboy tomato.

1274
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,380
So and then... and obviously a lot of them were pretty funny.

1275
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,860
But what is something more peaceful?

1276
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,420
Because we had a lot of funny... we had some funny ones going in.

1277
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,480
So I was like, okay, we're going to go with five because it's like a peaceful...

1278
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,900
Like it's different.

1279
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,000
It's peaceful.

1280
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,100
And...

1281
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,140
And everything.

1282
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,800
I didn't want to do anything that really revealed what I...

1283
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,360
What I was going to look like.

1284
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,660
So that's why we scrapped...

1285
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,080
Despite seven and eight looking really fucking cool.

1286
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,440
It's going to spoil like parts of the outfit.

1287
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,460
Or like parts of the skin suit.

1288
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,400
So we didn't do seven or eight.

1289
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,360
It was... I think I chose like one, six.

1290
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,900
Yeah, I remember it was like one, six or five.

1291
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,020
And then we settled with five.

1292
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,980
But yes.

1293
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,920
The decisions I had to make was very, very difficult.

1294
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,340
Let's see.

1295
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,080
Sorry, Heaven.

1296
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1297
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,320
Thank you.

1298
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,520
Real talk.

1299
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,780
Could we like crowdfund a full version of A2 or something?

1300
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1301
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,120
Thank you.

1302
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:39,600
Thank you.

1303
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,500
Maybe in the future.

1304
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,040
I won't mind like making a community post on maybe like members or...

1305
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,120
Maybe like members because it's going to be a members wallpaper.

1306
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,500
I mean, well, if you guys want these as wallpapers.

1307
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,960
Because wallpapers are going to be like members.

1308
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,660
Like the ones that in this, in this, they're not members.

1309
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,820
They're all going to be free.

1310
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:06,680
The splash art, the ones that got made into actual splash art will be available for free for everybody.

1311
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:14,180
But if you do guys want some of these concept arts turned into actual wallpapers, I might ask in the members.

1312
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:20,620
Like in like post all these concepts and ask you guys which one you guys want to like make into like members wallpapers in the future.

1313
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,440
Because that's actually a good idea.

1314
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,980
Because that's actually a really good idea.

1315
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,600
But yes, this is another one.

1316
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,160
Let me see.

1317
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,480
There was like a couple or so many guys.

1318
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:35,080
I had to make a lot of decisions.

1319
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,000
Let's see.

1320
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,940
All right.

1321
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,600
There's this one.

1322
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,700
And then did I show this one?

1323
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,860
No, I didn't show this one yet.

1324
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,340
And then I got to make sure I close my tabs.

1325
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,420
Because while I was saving.

1326
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,900
I just need you guys to know.

1327
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,380
While I was saving behind the scenes images.

1328
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,300
I blue screen because I didn't close any of my tabs.

1329
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:07,920
So I need to remind myself to close tabs.

1330
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,360
So I do not blue screen.

1331
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,740
Because that would be very awkward.

1332
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,760
Um.

1333
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,780
I'm trying to remember.

1334
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay.

1335
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,520
I know.

1336
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,400
All right.

1337
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,440
I know there was a lot of concepts from this artist.

1338
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,060
Because we did not pick the other concept.

1339
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,600
We did not pick some of the other ones that they first sent.

1340
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:39,060
So I'm trying to make sure I find the right one.

1341
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,860
I'm trying to make sure.

1342
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,620
Oh, there were these.

1343
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,140
Okay.

1344
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,920
All right.

1345
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,480
All right.

1346
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,200
So I need you guys to know.

1347
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:54,560
The first name that we came up with was...

1348
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,020
Oh, this one.

1349
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,380
Okay.

1350
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,140
As you guys can see.

1351
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,040
Oh, there were so many good concepts.

1352
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,080
This was like one of the first concept arts we received.

1353
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,020
Oh, but there were so many.

1354
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,180
There were...

1355
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,280
We had a lot of really, really good ideas here.

1356
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,020
So I think you guys can see that we went with one.

1357
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,340
Because we wanted an action scene.

1358
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,400
You see two.

1359
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,200
Two was the inspiration behind.

1360
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,160
I really...

1361
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,280
I loved...

1362
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,980
I loved two a lot.

1363
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,060
Two was actually also one of my favorites.

1364
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,420
That was given to Nico to do in the end.

1365
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,820
Because we had so many concepts that were really, really, really good.

1366
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,360
That like another artist took two to draw.

1367
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,380
For their own splash art.

1368
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,620
And that's where the, you know, the bar scene was inspired by.

1369
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,720
Because I thought it was like, oh my god, that's actually so clever.

1370
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,340
That was really, really clever.

1371
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,620
So that's...

1372
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,720
So huge shout out to Xtrident for coming with all these concepts.

1373
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,540
Because that's where I got my inspiration for the background itself as well.

1374
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,200
But yes.

1375
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,980
The original game title was going to be Flock Champs.

1376
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,360
That came...

1377
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,600
That was came up by the team.

1378
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,220
I was like, no.

1379
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,040
I just thought it didn't roll off the tongue well.

1380
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,100
Like, you know, Flock Champs.

1381
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,520
It just...

1382
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,680
It felt awkward like saying it.

1383
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,220
So then that's why I stole your ideas, Dragones.

1384
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,080
So I really appreciate you guys.

1385
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:40,380
I stole Dokiiverse and Battlebirds from you guys in the memberships.

1386
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,900
Because I was like, hey guys.

1387
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,480
I'm gonna...

1388
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,580
I need an idea for a game title.

1389
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,080
Because like...

1390
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,500
I'm gonna be making a wallpaper themed around...

1391
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,700
I mean, technically I wasn't wrong.

1392
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,200
There are wallpapers.

1393
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,200
So...

1394
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,540
So I was like, hey guys.

1395
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,760
I need some game ideas.

1396
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,980
And then I think like there was one.

1397
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:03,960
Someone said Dokiiverse.

1398
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,880
And then another one was Flock Champs.

1399
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,400
Not Flock Champs.

1400
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:07,560
Sorry.

1401
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,840
Flock Champs was the one we rejected.

1402
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,320
And then one said Battlebirds.

1403
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,380
And Battlebirds was like the most upvoted...

1404
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,960
Updudes going in.

1405
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,120
So I was like, alright.

1406
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,140
We're gonna...

1407
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,200
I'm gonna steal that.

1408
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,820
And then be like, hey guys.

1409
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,660
I came up with...

1410
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,400
No.

1411
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,980
Okay.

1412
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,240
I didn't say that to the others.

1413
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,260
Like, hey guys.

1414
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,420
So I asked the members.

1415
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,260
I think we're gonna go with these.

1416
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,700
These names.

1417
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,200
Anyway.

1418
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,620
So these are the concept art.

1419
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,740
Four looked really good.

1420
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,340
Four looked like in Apex Legends.

1421
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,200
Like opening.

1422
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,500
Cause like originally for the devs.

1423
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,600
It was gonna be just like normal Doki Bird productions.

1424
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,180
But then we saw Doki Verse.

1425
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,880
And then we're like, oh Doki Verse will work so well.

1426
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,040
It's gonna work so well as like a...

1427
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,340
Like a, you know, a game publishing company.

1428
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,120
A publisher name.

1429
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,140
So then that's why we stole...

1430
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,920
We borrowed.

1431
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,720
It was...

1432
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,260
You guys posted on my channel.

1433
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,320
So it's my idea.

1434
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,660
You know that's like...

1435
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,400
You know like that's TOS shit.

1436
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,540
Like if you post it on our website.

1437
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,180
It's ours now.

1438
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,300
Because you willingly posted on the website.

1439
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,240
You know that rule that some companies have.

1440
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,420
To like legally.

1441
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,140
They're like it's not yours.

1442
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,380
It's ours now.

1443
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,740
It's like how...

1444
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,520
Oh my god.

1445
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,220
I think I remember.

1446
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,020
That's why like Deviantart lowkey died.

1447
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,160
Because Deviantart released a new TOS.

1448
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,720
Being like.

1449
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,760
If you post this on our website.

1450
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,840
On Deviantart.

1451
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,340
It's now legally.

1452
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,720
We can use it for anything we want.

1453
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,060
Because you posted it on our website.

1454
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,520
So like technically.

1455
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,020
If you post...

1456
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:06,300
Because you commented willingly on my community post.

1457
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,660
It's mine now.

1458
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,660
I'm gonna kill you.

1459
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,280
No I'm joking.

1460
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,260
Guys I'm joking.

1461
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,080
I'm joking.

1462
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,460
It's our idea.

1463
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,040
Okay.

1464
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,120
It's our idea.

1465
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:20,820
It's not mine.

1466
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,920
It's ours.

1467
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,640
But yes.

1468
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,340
Here were all the concepts.

1469
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,820
For...

1470
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,820
From X Trident.

1471
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,860
Like it's so difficult.

1472
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,060
There were so many.

1473
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,600
Really.

1474
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,020
Really good ideas.

1475
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:39,680
That.

1476
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,700
Is very difficult to be like.

1477
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,280
Which one is the.

1478
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,300
Because they could only do.

1479
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:44,880
Like every.

1480
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,240
I think almost all the artists.

1481
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:46,960
I think every artist.

1482
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,160
Yeah.

1483
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,100
Every artist could only do one.

1484
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,080
And because they can only do one.

1485
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,780
It was a very difficult decision.

1486
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,320
That.

1487
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,440
Yeah.

1488
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,000
Pick one.

1489
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,300
They are all so good.

1490
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,400
They are all so good.

1491
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,620
I had to make one decision.

1492
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:12,450
Let's see.

1493
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:13,910
So we have.

1494
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,150
I gotta check this out.

1495
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,470
It's aLED?

1496
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,690
super chat.

1497
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:14,970
Thank you.

1498
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,630
Thank you.

1499
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,590
Finally got my two Doki keychains.

1500
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,430
I hung one on the mirror of my car.

1501
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:21,410
I was surprised by the amount of import taxes it so.

1502
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:21,590
What?

1503
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,550
20 Euros?

1504
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,970
God damn taxes.

1505
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,710
Where are they fun?

1506
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,310
What are they making anyway?

1507
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:32,430
If I can still fucking live on Mars.

1508
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,730
What's the point of paying taxes?!

1509
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:36,210
Don't.

1510
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,470
Please don't audit me.

1511
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,470
I pay my taxes.

1512
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,630
Please don't.

1513
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,410
It was a joke Canadian government.

1514
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:43,750
Please don't audit me.

1515
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,270
I do pay my taxes!

1516
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1517
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,430
Thank you, thank you.

1518
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:54,850
Thank you for the super chat.

1519
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:55,630
Thank you, thank you.

1520
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,750
So you're saying that we reply with sussy things?

1521
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:00,030
No, I can pick and choose.

1522
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:03,730
I can pick and choose what is ours.

1523
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,650
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz.

1524
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,730
Thank you, thank you.

1525
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,730
For legal reasons, that was a joke Canadian government.

1526
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:14,370
And if the American government is watching...

1527
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:21,770
I'm happy I'm not in America or part of a country that's part of the European Union.

1528
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:29,730
Is that too much of a low blow?

1529
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,390
You'll understand if you're part of the European Union.

1530
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,770
She knows!

1531
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:41,630
Let's see.

1532
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,590
You know, Canadian taxes fucking suck as well.

1533
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,670
Canadian fucking post to serve.

1534
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,550
It's okay, you know what's fucked up?

1535
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:55,310
So it's like, I live in a country that's part of the European Union.

1536
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,830
Sad face.

1537
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,070
Okay, you know what fucking sucks?

1538
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:04,130
Canadian business owners will understand.

1539
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:11,710
It is more expensive to ship within Canada than it is to ship in Canada.

1540
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,310
Like, ship out to America.

1541
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,810
Like what kind of bull...

1542
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,990
We live in the same country!

1543
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,910
What bullshit is that?

1544
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,830
It is!

1545
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,130
It's actually...

1546
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:29,210
Yes, if you're shipping parcels in Canada...

1547
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,650
Letters don't count, by the way.

1548
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,110
And we're not talking about letters.

1549
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,710
But like if you're using like...

1550
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,030
If you're shipping like parcels and stuff...

1551
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,250
It's more expensive.

1552
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,270
To ship within the country.

1553
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,570
It's bullshit!

1554
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:46,410
Like why?

1555
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,580
Like, what do you mean?

1556
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,660
I don't...

1557
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,800
I don't understand.

1558
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,540
I actually don't understand the Canadian...

1559
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,460
Like support post offices.

1560
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,980
But please make it make sense.

1561
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,220
Like...

1562
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,260
Oh my God.

1563
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,000
I don't understand.

1564
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,420
Like Canada, please.

1565
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,840
I don't...

1566
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:20,700
How...

1567
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,120
Why do we do this?

1568
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:23,920
Okay.

1569
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:24,920
Um...

1570
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,060
Andy, thank you for the super chat.

1571
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:27,500
Thank you.

1572
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,680
It's not like we're fucking traveling mountains all the time.

1573
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,220
It's not like we're like fucking...

1574
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,440
It's not like...

1575
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,120
We don't have cars.

1576
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:37,920
Like...

1577
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,160
Yeah.

1578
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,160
Oh my God.

1579
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:42,460
Oh my God.

1580
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,460
And then...

1581
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,140
Oh...

1582
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,440
And then...

1583
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,260
The user post office!

1584
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,340
Guys...

1585
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,360
Dokie Merch is helping...

1586
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,580
Dokie Merch is funding the Canadian healthcare system right now.

1587
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,380
If you are a Canadian Dragoon and you're like...

1588
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,180
Why the fuck is it so expensive to ship within Canada?

1589
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,240
I...

1590
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,720
I want you to know that I'm helping funding...

1591
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,920
I'm helping to fund...

1592
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:11,900
We're funding the healthcare system!

1593
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,020
...together.

1594
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,480
You're buying stuff from my store?

1595
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,660
I have to pay... you're paying the shipping and I have to pay the taxes too?

1596
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,300
We're funding the Canadian healthcare system together.

1597
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,740
Oh my god.

1598
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,520
It's actually crazy.

1599
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,080
I don't understand.

1600
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:46,800
Every time I see the shipping to America versus shipping in Canada.

1601
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:51,420
And then the thing is... I don't understand.

1602
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,260
You United States dragoons, when you're shipping in the United States, it's cheaper.

1603
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,580
But when you're shipping to Canada, they add $20.

1604
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:09,980
Like a small fucking item you buy in America as a Canadian dragoon.

1605
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:16,700
And you guys, you compared to shipping in the United States versus shipping to Canada.

1606
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,880
It's like $20 extra.

1607
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,220
But we live next door!

1608
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,580
We live next door!

1609
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,240
And it's cheaper for us to ship to you!

1610
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,060
So should it be the same?

1611
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,800
I'm sorry, I'm just really mad.

1612
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,170
That shit pisses me off.

1613
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:47,260
If it's gonna be expensive in Canada, why can't it be expensive in America?

1614
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,340
Considering a trade-off for the healthcare.

1615
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,620
No name.

1616
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1617
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:55,840
Thank you.

1618
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,660
Thank you.

1619
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,140
I don't understand.

1620
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,540
I'll never understand.

1621
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,200
Lord Crow says thank you for the super chat.

1622
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:08,680
Thank you.

1623
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,240
Thank you.

1624
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,600
That's a freedom tax.

1625
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,480
Every American knows about it.

1626
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1627
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,260
Thank you.

1628
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,040
Thank you.

1629
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,940
I got somebody who was like, it's often cheaper to ship to the US and drive down to Canada.

1630
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:31,380
Yeah, you fucking ship it to the closest city in America that's closest to you.

1631
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:38,880
And then you drive down to the border to pick it up because you don't want to pay $20 in Canadian shipping.

1632
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,460
I'm sorry.

1633
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,440
I got sidetracked there.

1634
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:48,900
I got really, really passionate about this topic because I...

1635
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:55,180
Guys, I know like being Canadian, maybe it looks great, but it's...

1636
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:01,520
There's a little thing that just make it not so much fun.

1637
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:15,200
It's just... I just feel like it's a highway robbery because the Canadian dollar sucks compared to the American dollar.

1638
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,180
But yet you guys get cheaper shipping.

1639
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,660
Like what's the point?

1640
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,400
Our Canadian dollar sucks shit compared to the American dollar.

1641
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:38,580
But yet somehow we have to pay more to ship within our own country?

1642
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,360
Make it make sense.

1643
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,780
Alright, I'm done.

1644
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,200
I'm sorry.

1645
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,600
I'm really... I'm...

1646
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,280
I'm really passionate about this topic because...

1647
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:56,580
Because when I first found out about it, when we were like dealing with the store and then...

1648
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,880
And then like I was like looking at the shipping prices.

1649
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,360
Because we were fixing the shipping stuff.

1650
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:05,620
And...

1651
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,820
I was like adding my staff team was like, why is it like this?

1652
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,780
And then they're like, it's supposed to be like this.

1653
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,480
I was like, that doesn't make sense.

1654
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:21,160
Because like at first, okay, the thing is like at first we had like American staff member that's handling the store stuff.

1655
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,500
And then they were even they were like, I don't understand.

1656
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,520
I don't understand.

1657
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:26,580
I don't understand.

1658
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,780
I don't understand.

1659
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,180
I don't understand.

1660
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,880
Why is the Canadian shipping more expensive than the American shipping?

1661
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,300
And then I was like, that's what I was thinking.

1662
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,680
And then...

1663
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,580
Because like we were printing out the labels and stuff.

1664
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,620
And we had like a scale of it.

1665
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,480
We had all the products.

1666
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,700
So we're starting to print out the labels.

1667
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:54,960
And then we're like, wait, we fucked up the shipping prices because apparently we priced Canadian shipping lower than American shipping at first.

1668
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,780
But we think everything's fixed now, by the way, all the shipping prices.

1669
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,160
And then so now we had we later on, we had to go back to the shipping.

1670
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,040
Later on, we had a Canadian.

1671
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,140
Our distributor is from Canada.

1672
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,140
And they took over the shop.

1673
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:11,460
So the distributor was going through it and was like, no, that's that's how it works.

1674
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,240
Like in Canada, it's just more expensive to ship within your own country.

1675
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,360
That's like, why?

1676
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,440
And then the American staff member was like, that doesn't make sense.

1677
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,760
And then and then and then our Canadian distributor was like, no, no, it's just like that.

1678
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,020
And then the American staff member was like, that doesn't make sense.

1679
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,860
And I was like, that's what I was saying.

1680
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,020
It doesn't make sense.

1681
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,060
And she was like, no, it's just like that.

1682
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,680
That's that's how it is.

1683
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,680
Oh, my God.

1684
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,800
OK, sorry.

1685
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,440
Back to the concept.

1686
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:49,940
All right.

1687
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,400
I'm sorry.

1688
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,460
I went like 20 minutes on this.

1689
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,580
This is something I'm very passionate about.

1690
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:02,090
It's just it's just something I'm incredibly passionate about.

1691
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,450
I'm sorry.

1692
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:06,330
I'm sorry.

1693
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:07,450
I'm sorry to the team.

1694
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:08,090
I'm sorry.

1695
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,410
Anyway, here's some more concept art.

1696
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,290
This artist actually did the...

1697
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:23,090
I think it was the one with the fire behind.

1698
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,730
But they sent us extra concept art.

1699
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:29,450
I decided not to do this because it overlapped with...

1700
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:32,090
It overlapped with like, tried to do this.

1701
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:37,530
Trident's initial idea regarding the shooting guns thing.

1702
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:42,050
So that's why we decided not to go with any of these concept art.

1703
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:47,490
Because it overlapped already with Trident's pitch.

1704
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:52,730
Um, so we went with the one with the dragoons and the fire in the back.

1705
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:54,970
Oh, my God.

1706
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,770
It's so weird to just jump back into talking about this.

1707
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:05,090
After being like incredibly passionate.

1708
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,110
Alright, billboard concept art.

1709
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,610
Billboard concept art.

1710
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:15,570
This one was fun because the billboard stuff was decided sort of like at the last minute type deal.

1711
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,810
Not like last last minute.

1712
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,230
But like after when we were building up the 3D set.

1713
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,010
We realized we wanted to add billboards.

1714
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,390
So this was like the original.

1715
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,910
Please don't demonetize me, YouTube.

1716
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:29,230
But this was like one of the original.

1717
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:30,450
Hahaha.

1718
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,110
Hahaha.

1719
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,610
One of the original...

1720
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,450
We have more concept art for splash art.

1721
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,450
But like I didn't...

1722
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,810
I have to scroll to find it by the way.

1723
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,830
So I'm just going by with like what I have so far.

1724
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:45,810
Um...

1725
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,290
This was like the one of the original concepts.

1726
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,630
So we're like...

1727
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,930
We want to do something as a parody of gamer subs.

1728
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,950
So like we had dad subs.

1729
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,430
And then later on...

1730
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:56,250
Here are the...

1731
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:56,730
Oh, my God.

1732
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:57,830
This is a big file.

1733
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,070
We had like the other...

1734
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:01,210
Uh...

1735
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:01,790
Hahaha.

1736
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,950
Okay.

1737
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:03,750
Okay.

1738
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,250
I love the...

1739
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,990
We almost went with 2B by the way.

1740
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,070
We almost...

1741
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,090
We almost went with 2B.

1742
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,490
Because I thought 2B and 2C was really good.

1743
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,250
Um...

1744
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,190
But these were some of the concepts.

1745
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:17,410
Uh...

1746
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,490
Regarding...

1747
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:19,210
Uh...

1748
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,070
Regarding the billboards and stuff.

1749
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,210
So we had like stuff with...

1750
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:26,650
At first it wasn't going to be dad subs.

1751
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:28,790
It was going to be some fucking energy drink.

1752
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:29,690
Uh...

1753
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,530
We almost went with 2B and 2C.

1754
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:32,190
And then we were like...

1755
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:32,310
Wait.

1756
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,730
We should do a parody of gamer subs.

1757
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:34,990
It's going to make more sense.

1758
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:35,790
You know?

1759
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:36,890
With gamer subs instead.

1760
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:37,810
Um...

1761
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,610
So here are some of our billboard concepts.

1762
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,750
I think this was also billboard...

1763
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:41,990
Yes.

1764
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:42,510
This was...

1765
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,030
Hahaha.

1766
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,670
Hahaha.

1767
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:46,030
Okay.

1768
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:47,210
Okay.

1769
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,630
Some of them are...

1770
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:49,370
Hahaha.

1771
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,550
I forgot about what some of them looked like.

1772
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:55,110
So looking at it again is pretty funny.

1773
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:55,830
Uh...

1774
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,430
Alright.

1775
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,270
Thank you for the super chat.

1776
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:57,570
Thank you.

1777
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:57,990
Thank you.

1778
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,790
At least this tip is more for you than it.

1779
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:00,050
Comment below.

1780
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:04,070
Also desktop, YouTube, not liking PayPal for some fucking reason.

1781
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:05,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1782
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:05,890
Thank you.

1783
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,590
Thank you.

1784
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,090
Um...

1785
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,510
I was slurping my slushy.

1786
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,330
My mango slushy.

1787
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,230
Uh...

1788
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:15,070
But yes.

1789
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,310
This was...

1790
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:16,970
Uh...

1791
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:25,850
This was more concept art regarding dad subs and some of the billboard designs for it.

1792
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:26,990
And then we had...

1793
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,190
We had...

1794
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:28,530
They had...

1795
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,030
They made concept art for the billboard.

1796
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:30,670
Concept art.

1797
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:31,530
Uh...

1798
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:32,330
The flavors.

1799
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:33,150
Uh...

1800
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,150
The branding of dad subs.

1801
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,370
Oh, you guys look so fucking stupid.

1802
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:39,050
Hahaha.

1803
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:44,530
Um...

1804
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,150
Um...

1805
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,710
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

1806
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:47,070
Thank you.

1807
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:47,570
Thank you.

1808
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,630
God, this country shipping cost sucks.

1809
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,410
Anyway, here's the next concept.

1810
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,950
Alright.

1811
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1812
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:54,030
Thank you.

1813
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,730
Thank you.

1814
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:55,730
Um...

1815
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:57,550
What else do I have?

1816
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,190
What else?

1817
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,450
Uh...

1818
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:00,010
Uh...

1819
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,170
I'm trying to find the other...

1820
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:02,570
Oh yes.

1821
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,890
Here are some...

1822
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:04,130
Oh yeah.

1823
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:04,650
Here you go.

1824
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,290
Here's like the billboard by the way.

1825
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:07,190
Uh...

1826
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:07,810
We're...

1827
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:12,150
You guys are wondering when is the VR chat gonna be out, um, in public?

1828
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:14,330
Um...

1829
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,090
The...

1830
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:15,450
We...

1831
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,370
We are currently post...

1832
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,230
Not postponing.

1833
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:23,610
But I am letting the 3D team have a little break at the moment.

1834
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,990
I'm letting my entire team have a little break before we go back into work mode.

1835
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:29,870
Because it was two and a half months of like...

1836
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,870
Work almost every day for everybody.

1837
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:32,810
Like they had meetings.

1838
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,030
They actually had like...

1839
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:39,110
Staff meetings and stuff to like talk, discuss and build off of everything.

1840
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:39,950
And like...

1841
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:43,170
Like set design and design the entire concept.

1842
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:44,570
So like I'm...

1843
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:45,710
Cause like I...

1844
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:49,130
I actually had one of the team members be like, so when are we doing the VR chat world?

1845
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,370
Like when are we joining the server?

1846
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:54,990
And I was like, oh I'm making the server now but everybody's gonna have a little break at the moment before...

1847
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:56,010
Um...

1848
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:59,730
Before we go back into actually doing stuff for this.

1849
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:01,390
Because there's obviously like...

1850
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,850
I want to add more to just the world.

1851
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:05,530
I want to have like little fun games in there if possible.

1852
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,330
And maybe flesh out the place a little bit more.

1853
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:09,630
Like build off like...

1854
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,770
How did we get here?

1855
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,630
Like could we do something where we...

1856
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:13,170
Um...

1857
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,770
When we spawn in there's a little area to spawn in.

1858
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:16,790
Like a respawn point.

1859
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,290
You know like in Team Fortress 2?

1860
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,230
There's like a respawn locker.

1861
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:23,730
Or like in Overwatch there's like a place for you to respawn at.

1862
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,090
So I want to like...

1863
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:28,190
Add more lore and lore building to...

1864
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,210
This is...

1865
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:32,270
I know like in the game you drop down and stuff.

1866
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,830
But like obviously in VRChat you can't do that.

1867
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,990
Or maybe like...

1868
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,750
Actually another idea I have is just...

1869
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,950
You spawn in like a room and you can click something there.

1870
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:43,930
And then you drop down.

1871
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:45,090
I wonder if you can do that.

1872
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:45,710
That would be cool.

1873
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:46,950
Like um...

1874
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,510
You spawn in like a lobby-esque area.

1875
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,370
And then like you click a button.

1876
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,690
And then you like click a Q or something.

1877
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,310
And then you like...

1878
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:58,310
You drop down into the world.

1879
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:59,190
That would be... I think that's it.

1880
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,630
I think that would be really fun to do.

1881
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,830
Like there's like character selection in the respawn.

1882
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:04,470
Like the spot.

1883
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,510
Like the selection room and stuff.

1884
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:07,010
It's like...

1885
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:10,130
I don't know if you guys ever know this classic VRChat world.

1886
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,470
That was based off of Sword Art Online.

1887
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:15,230
I remember being like incredibly stupid because...

1888
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:16,110
Um...

1889
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:16,330
Um...

1890
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:16,790
It was like...

1891
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:17,130
Oh!

1892
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:19,850
A VRChat world that is like...

1893
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:20,430
Um...

1894
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,630
That is basically a replica of Sword Art Online.

1895
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,570
And then you drop into this room.

1896
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:25,550
This like...

1897
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:26,470
Somebody's room.

1898
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,430
And then I remember I was so stupid.

1899
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,170
Because I was like...

1900
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:29,850
What the fuck?

1901
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:31,270
Where's the Sword Art Online room?

1902
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:32,250
Like...

1903
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,250
The background looks like a forest.

1904
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,470
And there's a castle and everything.

1905
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,410
And then...

1906
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:41,790
Apparently you're supposed to click on a PC in that world.

1907
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,750
And then you get dropped into the Sword Art Online world.

1908
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,730
But I didn't know that.

1909
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,210
I was so confused.

1910
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,250
I was just like...

1911
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:50,650
Um...

1912
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:51,430
I was like...

1913
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:52,290
What do you mean?

1914
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:52,870
Like...

1915
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:55,650
Why is it just this person's room?

1916
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,570
This random guy's room?

1917
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:58,410
Where is it?

1918
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,590
What is the world?

1919
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:03,790
By the way, I've never watched Sword Art Online.

1920
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:04,690
So like...

1921
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:06,690
All I know about it are the memes.

1922
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:08,150
I just thought it was cool.

1923
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:09,670
I wanted to look at it.

1924
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:11,990
Anyway, I figured that out like...

1925
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,350
Two years later.

1926
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:15,410
When another friend of mine was like...

1927
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:17,050
Yo, let's go to that Sword Art Online world.

1928
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:17,870
They updated it.

1929
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:18,650
I was like...

1930
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:19,030
What?

1931
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,470
Wait, that world?

1932
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:21,530
Wait...

1933
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,610
There's more to it than the room?

1934
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,730
There's more to it than the room?

1935
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:28,390
There's more to it than the room?

1936
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,890
There's more to it than the fucking room?

1937
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:35,210
Um...

1938
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:38,730
Anyway...

1939
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:39,870
So I was like...

1940
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:41,370
I think that would be a really cool idea.

1941
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,910
To be able to like...

1942
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,390
You spawn into something outside of that.

1943
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:51,330
But then you can click a button to be dropped down into the gaming world of the area.

1944
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,190
So yeah.

1945
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,110
Like I said...

1946
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,590
It's not gonna be something that's gonna be done right away.

1947
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,550
Like even though we have majority of this stuff.

1948
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:58,210
Like...

1949
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,170
It's technically finished.

1950
01:17:59,490 --> 01:17:59,930
Uh...

1951
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:00,490
We still...

1952
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:01,310
There's a lot of like...

1953
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,750
Stuff I want to do to like...

1954
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,930
Just build off of the world.

1955
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:05,310
Alright.

1956
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,390
So here are some concept arts by the way.

1957
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:08,130
Um...

1958
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:08,770
Like I said...

1959
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,550
We had to figure out a lot.

1960
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,850
I don't remember what this is.

1961
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,070
I think it was just set dressing.

1962
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:13,830
Like...

1963
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:18,790
We had so many cons...

1964
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,230
Like some of the things I'm like...

1965
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,210
Wait, what is this?

1966
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:22,270
But...

1967
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:22,890
Oh, I remember this.

1968
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,670
So we had like...

1969
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,710
Loop boxes too.

1970
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:25,470
Like what the...

1971
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,370
How the loop box is gonna...

1972
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,250
Like the loop box system was gonna work and stuff.

1973
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:31,510
So there's the...

1974
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:32,250
Um...

1975
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,450
What was the loop box?

1976
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,030
And then one is like...

1977
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:36,390
Uh...

1978
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:37,130
What is like...

1979
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:37,610
Uh...

1980
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,770
Loot crates in the game itself.

1981
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,810
So like you know when you're opening the loop box.

1982
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,450
Like these were the concept art.

1983
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:45,250
Uh...

1984
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,850
So it's like a carton and stuff.

1985
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:47,390
Uh...

1986
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,490
But yeah, we went with the blue.

1987
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,930
Because obviously that looks the best.

1988
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,470
So...

1989
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:54,290
Some of the concept art for this.

1990
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:55,250
Oh my god.

1991
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:57,350
There were some 3D models that we weren't able to get.

1992
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,370
So this is one.

1993
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:00,790
This was...

1994
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,490
Uh...

1995
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:02,310
Nice wigs.

1996
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,030
Uh...

1997
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:03,850
Dragoon.

1998
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,370
So there were so many.

1999
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:05,870
There was...

2000
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,190
I don't know if we used this one.

2001
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,110
Because there were so many.

2002
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,450
We had some deleted scenes and stuff.

2003
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,390
So...

2004
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:12,010
And we had like...

2005
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,150
We couldn't add everything.

2006
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,190
But this was...

2007
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,350
I love the mustache.

2008
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:16,870
The mustache was so good.

2009
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,130
Um...

2010
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,030
And then we have...

2011
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:26,770
Uh...

2012
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:27,350
Here...

2013
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,590
Here's...

2014
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:28,990
Here's Axa's...

2015
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:29,250
Uh...

2016
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:29,890
Dragoon...

2017
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:30,630
Dragoonify.

2018
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,330
Dragoon's your Oshi.

2019
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:33,050
No!

2020
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,920
My Oshi!

2021
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,220
My Oshi's a gooner!

2022
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:46,880
Um...

2023
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,660
Um...

2024
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:48,080
Oh yeah.

2025
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:48,840
I showed...

2026
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,620
Um...

2027
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:52,760
Tempo apparently was asking me for the files.

2028
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,980
Because he wants to make it into a plushie.

2029
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:56,260
Like...

2030
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:56,440
Uh...

2031
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:56,880
For himself.

2032
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:57,740
Like...

2033
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,180
He wants...

2034
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:58,500
He was like...

2035
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:58,800
Oh my god.

2036
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:59,080
It's so cute.

2037
01:19:59,100 --> 01:19:59,260
It's so cool.

2038
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,120
Can I have the files so I can make it into a plushie?

2039
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:01,380
He was like...

2040
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,180
No problem, man.

2041
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,640
Bro, fucking do whatever the fuck you want.

2042
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,160
These are...

2043
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:05,700
Because like...

2044
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:09,040
I'm not using it for anything else other than like...

2045
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,460
Just for the sake of the reveal.

2046
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,920
So it's like...

2047
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,020
It was just gonna rot.

2048
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,340
Like...

2049
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,240
Like...

2050
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,340
It was like...

2051
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,320
Nothing that was gonna be like...

2052
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,480
Done with these models.

2053
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,780
Other than the fact...

2054
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,500
Because I'm not gonna...

2055
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:22,900
You know...

2056
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,120
It's...

2057
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,300
It's their identity.

2058
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,480
It's their property.

2059
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:25,960
Like...

2060
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,060
It's their likeness.

2061
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:29,760
It's like their identity.

2062
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,140
It's gonna be the same thing that it's gonna be, you know...

2063
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,100
Like the sake of like the debut reveal.

2064
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,120
Like the debut reveal.

2065
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,280
So I was like...

2066
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,200
If you guys...

2067
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,700
Like I know like Fillion actually reached out to me and asked for like the sticker.

2068
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,280
Because she wanted to make it into like her own discord emu.

2069
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,280
Because I wasn't gonna sell the sticker.

2070
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,320
It was like just made for the sake of the reveal.

2071
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,900
Like all this stuff that was based off of like my friends and people I collabed with and everything.

2072
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,060
It was just for the sake of the reveal and like...

2073
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:55,300
Like...

2074
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:55,640
Like...

2075
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,180
Oh my god.

2076
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,000
I recognized him!

2077
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:08,280
I'm not gonna make money off of it.

2078
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,780
I'm not gonna give it away because it's your likeness.

2079
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:14,780
But if you guys want it, just ask me and I'll hand it over to you guys.

2080
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,760
But yes, there's stuff like that.

2081
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:18,900
What else?

2082
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:25,180
Here's some concept art of the logos and stuff.

2083
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,320
So this is what it could have...

2084
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,540
As you see, I settled with...

2085
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:32,300
Oh my god, making decisions on the look of and aesthetic of things.

2086
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,460
So difficult.

2087
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,620
Honestly, it's actually such a difficult decision.

2088
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,440
Yes, so here's some concept art of the logo and stuff.

2089
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,520
And then I think I asked for like parody logos.

2090
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,540
I don't remember.

2091
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,580
I think like me and someone else in the team were asking for like...

2092
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,860
Oh yeah, we should have like parody logos and stuff.

2093
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:54,840
So there's like some...

2094
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,180
We were like basing off like some...

2095
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:03,140
Like making parodies off of other games and stuff to make it look real.

2096
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,880
To make Dokiverse like a real Battle.net slash Steam.

2097
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,160
Like I was like, I needed to...

2098
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,400
I need the lore.

2099
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,960
I need the lore building.

2100
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:21,580
Everything must feel like it could possibly be an actual game client.

2101
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,360
With games on it.

2102
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,140
Yes, there's...

2103
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,080
Someone's like, oh, what about Duck by Daylight?

2104
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,580
I do have that right here.

2105
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,840
There was like other...

2106
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:30,840
Oh my god, I need to find it.

2107
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,300
But there's like concept art for like...

2108
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,240
Like scrapped game logos.

2109
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:35,420
Let's see.

2110
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,220
Where is it?

2111
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:36,620
Did I see?

2112
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:37,380
Oh, there it is.

2113
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,000
Here's...

2114
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,860
Here's...

2115
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,740
This is a horror game.

2116
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,880
Oh, there's...

2117
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,060
Yeah, there's...

2118
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,180
There's basically a Dead by Daylight...

2119
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,920
Dead by Daylight...

2120
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,980
Dead by Daylight...

2121
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,580
Was it parody?

2122
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,180
And then we had...

2123
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:01,860
Oh my gosh.

2124
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,240
Yes, there's so many.

2125
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,560
There's so many.

2126
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,240
And then...

2127
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,380
Oh, so here's a full res of the poster, by the way.

2128
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,400
This poster that was there.

2129
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,480
We had so many little art stuff that was there.

2130
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,900
That's like if you blink, you'll miss it.

2131
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,280
So this poster was on the animation.

2132
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,760
That was the animation in the beginning.

2133
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,240
With the little dragoon.

2134
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,400
Like in the backboard.

2135
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,320
There's like little stuff in the backboard and everything.

2136
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,240
So it was like little small art stuff.

2137
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,380
Like little small moments and Easter eggs.

2138
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,120
And we're like, if you blink, you would not see this.

2139
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,660
So we had this poster made.

2140
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,000
Oh my, this other thing.

2141
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,980
I specifically requested it.

2142
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,500
This other thing.

2143
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,920
Let me see if I can find where I saved.

2144
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:48,780
Where did I save it?

2145
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,280
I did not save any of this.

2146
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:50,620
This one.

2147
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:51,760
I specifically...

2148
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:53,740
This was right after...

2149
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,780
Right after the rest stream.

2150
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,120
I was like, I need a book dedicated to the Blood God.

2151
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,650
Right after the rest stream.

2152
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:10,870
I was like, at the team.

2153
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:11,890
I need...

2154
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,330
I need somebody...

2155
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,430
Because they're like, what kind of Easter eggs do you want?

2156
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:18,790
And I was like, add a book about the Blood God.

2157
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:28,150
So this is like something that we added in like, retroactively.

2158
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:31,210
Because we were like, what kind of reference do we need?

2159
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,610
Also, here's a goon with gun.

2160
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:42,630
Here's a goon with guns.

2161
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:43,670
Also, we had...

2162
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,070
Oh my gosh.

2163
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:46,350
I wish you guys could have seen the details of the death box.

2164
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:47,830
This is the death box.

2165
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:48,810
I love the little details.

2166
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:49,410
I wish...

2167
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:52,470
I think like, you guys will be able to see it in the VR chat world.

2168
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:53,370
If you guys...

2169
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:54,590
Whenever it's out.

2170
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:57,690
But there's like, so many little details with the 3D modeling and everything.

2171
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:58,730
It's like, you know...

2172
01:24:58,730 --> 01:24:59,070
Oh my gosh.

2173
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:01,210
The little like, little ghost goon there.

2174
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,570
Little wisp goon right there.

2175
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:09,130
And then we had like, gun concepts too.

2176
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,130
Of everything.

2177
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:15,010
Because we didn't want to like, replicate exactly the wingman.

2178
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,970
But like, we had, you know...

2179
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,670
It's like a parody.

2180
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:22,210
A parody of the gun.

2181
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:23,570
And stuff like that.

2182
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,290
And then like...

2183
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,750
We built all the models.

2184
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,370
By the way.

2185
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:30,390
All the models in the...

2186
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:32,630
In Dadwood Canyon.

2187
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:33,810
Made from scratch.

2188
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:36,510
Nothing was...

2189
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:39,050
We didn't buy anything from the Unity store.

2190
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:41,270
We didn't like, you know...

2191
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:44,190
Take any of the models that were already pre-made.

2192
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:47,770
All of these models were 100% made from scratch.

2193
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:51,130
So we own the models.

2194
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,390
And everything.

2195
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:54,790
And so like...

2196
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,310
Because you know...

2197
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:55,830
It's ours.

2198
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,690
We didn't buy anything from the Unity store.

2199
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,690
It was literally made from scratch.

2200
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,070
I think this one...

2201
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:05,690
Okay, what I'm going to show you has to be one of my favorite models.

2202
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:07,470
Because it's so cute.

2203
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:08,550
Look at these cactuses.

2204
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,010
I'm sorry, but look at these cactuses.

2205
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:19,010
They're so cute.

2206
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,910
It's one of my favorite.

2207
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:24,970
I don't know.

2208
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:25,630
It's just...

2209
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,070
Look, it's just so cute.

2210
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,170
I don't know.

2211
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:29,450
I just can't help it.

2212
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:35,410
I need you guys to see the cactuses.

2213
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:37,310
They're so fucking cute.

2214
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:38,630
I can't help it.

2215
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,030
Sorry.

2216
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,170
It's just so cute.

2217
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:44,850
So adorable!

2218
01:26:45,630 --> 01:27:01,210
Also some concepts, some 3D model concepts of like our version of the Nessie, the the legally distinct Nessie plushie with Longoon.

2219
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:06,250
So they're like the Longoon model plushie.

2220
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:08,550
And then we will have like it rendered.

2221
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:11,150
I don't know if I saved the rendered version.

2222
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:11,450
No!

2223
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:12,270
Wait, I did.

2224
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:16,690
So it ended up looking like this and then it came into... So a Goonie.

2225
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:17,130
Yeah.

2226
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:21,610
A little Goonie.

2227
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,590
What other stuff do I have?

2228
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,250
Oh yeah, here's like a map too.

2229
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:37,450
I'll give you guys like 3D shots of the map because it's actually... it's actually crazy like that all of this was made from scratch.

2230
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,410
Like oh my god!

2231
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,510
Like seeing it all together.

2232
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:51,630
Like all of this being made... like an entire actual world being made in scratch by our 3D team...like holy shit!

2233
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:56,370
Like look at... it looks like an actual map!

2234
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:12,110
Because it happens so fast so you don't like take in the fact that a lot of this there's like stuff on the in the water and everything and in 2.5 months too.

2235
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,910
Like, Like in 2.5 months, so...

2236
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:15,750
There's so many things everywhere.

2237
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,750
That was just like...

2238
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,130
This is like the zoom out.

2239
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:23,550
When you zoom out, you realize, okay, that's not a lot.

2240
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,390
But when you zoom in, you're like, whoa!

2241
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:27,410
Holy shit!

2242
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,210
That is a lot of stuff going on.

2243
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:33,910
Oh, and then one of my...

2244
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,770
staff member was like, where are they dropping?

2245
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,640
Staff member...

2246
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,880
One of the teams, sorry, not staff member.

2247
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:50,180
One of the debut team, project team, made this and was like, alright guys, where are they...

2248
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,040
What POI are they landing?

2249
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,000
I thought...

2250
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,860
That's so funny.

2251
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,960
Where is TSM gonna land?

2252
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,480
I thought that was so fucking clever.

2253
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:07,880
I thought that was so silly.

2254
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,600
If BattleBirds was an esport, what is their POI?

2255
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,080
I don't know.

2256
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,260
I don't know.

2257
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:18,720
Oh yeah, here.

2258
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,080
And then we had...

2259
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,980
Did I show this one already?

2260
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,000
Oh yeah, I didn't show this one.

2261
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:26,980
But here's a better picture of DadSubs.

2262
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,460
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

2263
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,500
I'll be right back.

2264
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,720
You guys can talk amongst yourselves for a little bit.

2265
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:32,340
Give me a sec.

2266
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:33,040
I'll be right back.

2267
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,520
Alright, I'm back.

2268
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,180
Back from the bathroom break.

2269
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:05,580
Okay.

2270
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:06,560
Let me see.

2271
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,200
Let me go in order now of... Oh wait, let's see.

2272
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,000
What team am I on?

2273
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,720
Alright, QuadShack.

2274
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:14,000
First set of teams for King's Cat.

2275
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,340
Okay, what team am I on?

2276
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,540
Alright guys, where am I?

2277
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,260
I am with...

2278
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,180
Poor... What?

2279
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:21,840
Sorry.

2280
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:22,440
Okay.

2281
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,460
It's okay.

2282
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,800
They won't be watching this so they won't know I hooed them.

2283
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,480
Alright.

2284
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:29,720
Okay.

2285
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,440
So each game is going...

2286
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,380
Each game is going to be randomized.

2287
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,360
Each game is gonna be randomized.

2288
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,440
So we're gonna be with different people each time.

2289
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:46,220
Anyways, so...

2290
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:49,540
Um...

2291
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,040
Okay.

2292
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,820
I recognize... Okay, so I recognize the first one.

2293
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,460
The first one is dropped.

2294
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:56,580
I recognize him.

2295
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,300
I did not hooed dropped.

2296
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,740
I hooed the two other players cause I don't know.

2297
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,080
I'm not familiar with them.

2298
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,440
Oh my god, they did put me as the lowest rank.

2299
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:06,980
Yes!

2300
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:13,480
It's like P1, P2, P3, and P4.

2301
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:18,520
It's marked by like um... how good these people are.

2302
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:22,660
How good these people are at Apex.

2303
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,500
And I wrote in the sign up form.

2304
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,960
I was like I am... They were like, what's the highest rank you got?

2305
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,100
And I was like, diamond.

2306
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:37,170
Cause I was like...

2307
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:44,730
So they put me at P4 which is like the people who are the lowest ranked.

2308
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:52,770
Guys, look.

2309
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:53,550
All the other...

2310
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:57,410
Guys, all the other D... the P4s they play this game regularly.

2311
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:58,170
Okay?

2312
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,350
Um...

2313
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:02,930
Anyway.

2314
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:06,390
Anyway, so uh... it's not lying.

2315
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:07,530
It's omitting information.

2316
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:11,970
I'm currently... last two seasons ago, I was diamond.

2317
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:13,990
Two seasons ago, I was diamond.

2318
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:14,850
It's omitting...

2319
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:17,470
It's omitting information.

2320
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:19,550
Um... Anyway.

2321
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:27,010
It's like dropped Melanie par-ray-dol-ly-avoid.

2322
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,190
par-ray-dol-ly-avoid.

2323
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:27,750
Yes, I know.

2324
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,590
I... Even I'm like...

2325
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:30,910
I'm sorry.

2326
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:32,290
It's okay.

2327
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:33,150
They won't watch this VOD.

2328
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:35,290
Cause it's like they think it's behind the scenes.

2329
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:37,590
Um...

2330
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,730
I know dropped!

2331
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:40,110
I know dropped!

2332
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:41,430
Dropped's on my team!

2333
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:42,390
This is game one.

2334
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,130
Um... And then...

2335
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:44,450
And then there's me.

2336
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:46,250
And then there's me after that.

2337
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:49,370
Um... Team 15 has three players.

2338
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:50,810
Like how are they gonna play?

2339
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:51,870
Like the other...

2340
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:55,610
Okay, you can't say like you're smurfing because like...

2341
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:57,970
Isn't Deridium...

2342
01:34:57,970 --> 01:35:00,330
Deridium's literally like Pred.

2343
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:01,970
Like why...

2344
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,270
I recognize one person in P4.

2345
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:11,170
And that guy's Pred, isn't he?

2346
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:12,930
He lied even more.

2347
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:13,670
Right?

2348
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:14,050
I mean...

2349
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:14,290
He...

2350
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,810
He lied even more!

2351
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:20,130
He's a recent Pred.

2352
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,510
Um... Raspberry, thank you.

2353
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:29,430
Welcome to the tomato farm.

2354
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:30,710
Welcome, welcome.

2355
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:33,530
Um...

2356
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:36,030
I remember I recognized Deridium.

2357
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:39,690
I recognized Deridium being like an actual good player.

2358
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,810
I don't recognize anybody else.

2359
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:43,890
But I recognized Deridium.

2360
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:48,430
Um...

2361
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:48,830
Um...

2362
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:50,010
Anyway...

2363
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:51,970
Anyway...

2364
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,150
Thank god they put me at P4.

2365
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:55,630
Yeah!

2366
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:59,650
P1 is where all the good players are.

2367
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:02,130
Like the actual professional players.

2368
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:03,770
And then like...

2369
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:05,130
And then it goes down from there.

2370
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:05,710
Okay, sorry.

2371
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:10,430
We gotta go back to the... I had to figure out like who... How many games is this?

2372
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:12,330
How many did I accidentally sign up for?

2373
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:13,430
Um...

2374
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:14,970
Six games?

2375
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,010
Oh my...

2376
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:22,450
Oh my god, it's six games!

2377
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:25,290
Six!

2378
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:27,530
Okay, we can do this guys.

2379
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:30,350
We can... We can do this!

2380
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:32,870
Okay!

2381
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:33,930
Okay!

2382
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:36,730
Guys, I figured out I don't read.

2383
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,470
I... Guys!

2384
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:40,850
Oh my god!

2385
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,950
I don't read, guys!

2386
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:48,350
Okay...

2387
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:49,110
Okay...

2388
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:49,430
Um...

2389
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,710
Wait, is it like... Okay...

2390
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:54,230
First set of teams for... Oh, so like...

2391
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:55,970
Post the next troop during...

2392
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:56,130
Oh!

2393
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:59,090
So like we're gonna be with this team for two games.

2394
01:36:59,290 --> 01:36:59,570
Okay.

2395
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:01,730
Sorry, every map is a new team.

2396
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:02,350
JK.

2397
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,750
It's not every game is a new team.

2398
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:06,570
Every map is a new team.

2399
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:08,590
Um...

2400
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:09,310
Alright, anyway.

2401
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,010
Let's... Let's go through... Sorry, let me actually...

2402
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:13,950
Let me go through it for...

2403
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:15,670
I keep getting distracted.

2404
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:17,350
Oh my god!

2405
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:19,550
When I have a time limit, it's so bad.

2406
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:25,030
I don't... I don't do well with time limits.

2407
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:28,310
I feel like I waste more time when I have a time limit.

2408
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:33,770
This has to be the slowest behind the scenes feature I've ever done because...

2409
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:37,330
Because I keep getting distracted by things.

2410
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:38,670
Alright, anyway.

2411
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:42,210
So here was like a concept of... Um...

2412
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:44,470
A concept of Flockchamps.

2413
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:53,570
Um... We were like thinking of making more parodies off of Apex in general, but the thing is, I said I wanted like Overwatch and Apex.

2414
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:56,130
Um... So that's why we scrapped this.

2415
01:37:56,390 --> 01:38:02,270
Uh... Because I wanted to be more so focused on the fact that I don't want to make it just an Apex parody.

2416
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:06,950
Parody, I want it to be like... Apex and Overwatch.

2417
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:11,350
Because you know, they're both games that um... Are very dear to my heart.

2418
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:22,890
And like basically like I started off like... My career sort of started off because of Overwatch and that's why I wanted to uh... Make it more so like a cumulation of two.

2419
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:24,830
Not like just one game.

2420
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:29,090
Anyway, here's like a concept of what the... Um...

2421
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:32,390
The... The starting screen was gonna look like as well.

2422
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:35,450
So you can see like we're figuring out the GUIs and everything.

2423
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:44,370
And this was what the original idea of the character selection Obviously we went in different direction with the character selection like a lot better.

2424
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:44,830
Okay?

2425
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:46,970
Um...

2426
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:56,410
You know when you load into the game the character selection looked a lot different uh... From before.

2427
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:58,890
So this was what it was originally gonna look like.

2428
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:00,370
And then we also have...

2429
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,730
By the way, um...

2430
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,370
It's more so like blink and you'll see it.

2431
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:10,550
But like remember when like we saw a dead tomato in the animation?

2432
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:14,410
Uh... That was actually its own model.

2433
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,190
Um...

2434
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:19,370
So that... The tomato model.

2435
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:21,030
The tomato model.

2436
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:22,310
The 3D model.

2437
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,930
Was actually its own thing.

2438
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:27,010
Like you saw a dead tomato on the floor?

2439
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:28,450
That was a tomato model.

2440
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:30,010
That was a tomato 3D model.

2441
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,270
So...

2442
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:36,710
The tomato has its own 3D model.

2443
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:42,820
So...

2444
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,100
Um... It's... Yeah.

2445
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:48,760
So it's not like...

2446
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,340
You know...

2447
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,620
It was actually its own thing.

2448
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:55,640
Um...

2449
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:56,260
Yeah.

2450
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:56,800
It was...

2451
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,860
I'm glad we had it.

2452
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:02,500
Like I didn't know... We didn't know what to really do with it until later on.

2453
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,020
Cause we were like... Anyway here's the...

2454
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,580
I just like... I want a tomato model.

2455
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:07,800
We don't know what to do with it.

2456
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:08,520
But we're just like...

2457
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,320
We want it.

2458
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:09,740
You know?

2459
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,400
We want it.

2460
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,640
So originally we had an idea.

2461
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,180
I scrapped this... I scrapped this idea cause I... I... I...

2462
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:20,680
Um... It was good on...

2463
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:24,660
Um... Like... It was a good idea but I scrapped it.

2464
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:26,860
Because I thought that... Um...

2465
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:29,300
I...

2466
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,240
I...

2467
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:32,260
We were... It was originally...

2468
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,080
The character select...

2469
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,120
Was gonna include...

2470
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,880
Other dragoons of my friends.

2471
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:40,800
So you can like select...

2472
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,860
We could select my friends as a playable character.

2473
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,700
But I scrapped the idea because I was like...

2474
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,800
I want them to be skins.

2475
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:48,860
I don't want them...

2476
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:50,400
I want the dragoons themselves...

2477
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,120
To be the playable character.

2478
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,480
But I want... So like these were icons for like character select.

2479
01:40:56,780 --> 01:41:00,840
But I was like... I want the dragoons to be the playable characters.

2480
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,460
And then my friends...

2481
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:03,460
To be the skins.

2482
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,340
Cause I thought it would make more sense.

2483
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:05,760
Like...

2484
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,320
...

2485
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:06,900
...

2486
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,220
...

2487
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,720
Cause I don't know.

2488
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,920
I just feel like...

2489
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,700
To be more immersive, it would make more sense to...

2490
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:17,960
To make the dragoons themselves be...

2491
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,660
The model... Like the actual...

2492
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,320
Characters you can pick.

2493
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,880
And then you can change the model skins...

2494
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,340
With these guys.

2495
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,380
So we scrapped that idea.

2496
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,240
And that's why we didn't use it.

2497
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,720
I'm slowly going through like...

2498
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,140
I'm slowly... Oh my gosh.

2499
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,300
Here's some background shots by the way.

2500
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,540
Like not full background shots.

2501
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,080
But like... Here's some...

2502
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,020
I need to remember to delete my tabs.

2503
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,060
I'm so scared.

2504
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:42,780
I'm gonna get blue screen.

2505
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:43,580
I'm...

2506
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,680
I need to remind myself.

2507
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,900
Toki delete your tabs or you're gonna get blue screen.

2508
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,360
I need to remind myself.

2509
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:50,360
Toki delete your tabs or you're gonna get blue screen.

2510
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:52,020
Um...

2511
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,760
Here I love background work.

2512
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:55,720
But here's some like...

2513
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,580
Uh... Background work.

2514
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,420
Uh... Of the...

2515
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,940
The tomato reveal trailer.

2516
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,180
And... Let's see.

2517
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,300
I'm trying to like think... See if there's like...

2518
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,840
Stuff... So...

2519
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,660
Oh my god.

2520
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,080
There's 45 pages.

2521
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,580
What were we doing?

2522
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,500
We were doing so much.

2523
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,700
Oh my god.

2524
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,280
My team worked so hard.

2525
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,580
It's 45.

2526
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,320
There's 45 pages of just...

2527
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,180
There's 45 pages of just... Files.

2528
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,580
Of just...

2529
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:27,960
Of just like...

2530
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,360
Files that were put into this.

2531
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,340
This was a lot.

2532
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:33,160
This is the initial...

2533
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,120
The initial...

2534
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:34,840
We were starting...

2535
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,700
We were starting the 3D modeling.

2536
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:39,400
Uh... Right here.

2537
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,660
This is where we were starting the 3D modeling.

2538
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,040
Putting stuff in place and everything.

2539
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:45,640
Um...

2540
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:47,700
Guys give me a sec.

2541
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,760
I'm scrolling right now.

2542
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,640
Give me a sec.

2543
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:57,340
I'm scrolling through everything.

2544
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,700
At the moment.

2545
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,800
It's not a very like...

2546
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,540
What's the word?

2547
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,840
It's not a very like...

2548
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:03,680
...teamless...

2549
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,040
...showcase.

2550
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,060
There's just so many things.

2551
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:10,720
Um...

2552
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,300
Oh yeah.

2553
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,500
Here's some concept.

2554
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,220
Oh yeah.

2555
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:14,920
So... I love...

2556
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,880
I.

2557
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,800
I is like...

2558
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,840
I wish we did go with I for the fact that...

2559
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,820
I or C.

2560
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,720
I wish we did go with I or C.

2561
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,460
For the fact that the fucking giant floating...

2562
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:26,580
...dragoon baby.

2563
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:31,540
But...

2564
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,400
These were uh...

2565
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,560
...map concepts that we had.

2566
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:39,940
For how the map was going to look like.

2567
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,280
For how the map was going to look like.

2568
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,780
So I think we had...

2569
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,060
It was like...

2570
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,080
It was like the set dressing of everything.

2571
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,080
I think we went with D in the end.

2572
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:49,360
I think D was the one that looks most familiar to me.

2573
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,200
Um... But...

2574
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,980
I mean... an art book.

2575
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,400
I mean...

2576
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:57,420
Are people actually interested in an art book of this?

2577
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:01,480
Because an art book is a lot.

2578
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:06,020
I spent a lot of money to actually...

2579
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:14,400
I mean, if you guys are actually interested, I can talk to the project team to potentially make an art book of this if they're interested.

2580
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,380
Because I definitely will not be able to go through everything.

2581
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,860
What about digital PDF?

2582
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:28,860
I mean, I feel like people would definitely enjoy an art book more than a digital PDF because it's a...

2583
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:30,240
I could do both, actually.

2584
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:36,400
I could do both an art book for a collector's edition and just make it limited.

2585
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,920
Because art book is a lot of money.

2586
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:42,860
There's a reason why a lot of art books are Kickstarter projects.

2587
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:51,680
Because it is a lot to get a publisher... not publisher, but to get a manufacturer to make art books and stuff.

2588
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:55,900
But I'm down to do it if the project team is open to it as well.

2589
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,060
Anyway, here are some concepts as well.

2590
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:00,220
Okay.

2591
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:00,460
And I see here okay, so there's a lot more spaces.

2592
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,780
Like, stuff like the map would look like and...

2593
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,960
what we had for the map and everything.

2594
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,580
Oh my gosh!

2595
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,660
Oh my gosh.

2596
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:09,020
There's just...

2597
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:13,060
I did not realize how Many files we have.

2598
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:19,540
Okay, look.

2599
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,460
Okay, this was funny.

2600
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:29,360
Because originally, the dragons looked way too complicated.

2601
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:34,400
The initial preliminary sketch of the dragons.

2602
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:38,480
So like, here was like... this is what Axel originally looked like.

2603
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:44,180
And then we simplified it because it would be a bitch to 3D model.

2604
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,040
And we felt like it's just too much.

2605
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,920
So in the end, it turned into this.

2606
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,120
So this is what it turned out into in the end.

2607
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,420
So originally, it was like, yeah, super complicated.

2608
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:00,940
And we felt like it didn't really represent some of my friends really well.

2609
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:08,240
So that's why we like mega simplified a lot of the designs when it came to it.

2610
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,120
At one point, like... oh wait, let me see.

2611
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,220
It was like...

2612
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,080
Okay, this is...

2613
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,240
This is Altair's...

2614
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,180
One of Altair's initial concept.

2615
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,860
Which was like...

2616
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:26,980
Like kaleidoscope.

2617
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,100
The kaleidoscope ink.

2618
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,780
So this was like the initial...

2619
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,300
The initial concept of Altair.

2620
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,300
Like I said, like everybody went through.

2621
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,460
If we do make an art book, I don't think I'm gonna...

2622
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,120
I'm not gonna include like...

2623
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:48,860
I guess like...

2624
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:49,800
I'm definitely not gonna include...

2625
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,720
I might include like these sketches.

2626
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,660
Like the left side.

2627
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:55,980
But not like, you know, screenshots of fucking company old images.

2628
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:01,440
Anyway, here's the concept model of...

2629
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,500
Well, like not concept model.

2630
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:05,380
But like it being finished of the...

2631
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:09,260
Of the egg itself.

2632
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,780
The loot box itself.

2633
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:12,140
Oh, and also here.

2634
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:15,620
Since we had egg with gun.

2635
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:16,780
Here are...

2636
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:17,940
Um...

2637
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:18,820
Um...

2638
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:19,460
Here are...

2639
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:19,900
Um...

2640
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:20,380
Dragoons with guns.

2641
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,180
The sequel to egg with gun.

2642
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,020
We have dragoons with gun.

2643
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:32,380
Um...

2644
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:33,580
Let's see.

2645
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:36,020
I'm trying to look through some more stuff.

2646
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,960
I'm scrolling.

2647
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,720
I'm scrolling guys.

2648
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,480
Uh...

2649
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,440
Oh yeah.

2650
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,960
And here's some concept art of...

2651
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,180
The sprays itself.

2652
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,680
So we went through...

2653
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,700
Obviously we made parody.

2654
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,040
We made a lot of...

2655
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:51,060
Of...

2656
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:51,600
Um...

2657
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,760
Apex sprays.

2658
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,560
And here's like some of them.

2659
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,740
So the...

2660
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:56,280
Okay.

2661
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:58,420
And I had to pick between the dragoon or tomato.

2662
01:47:58,780 --> 01:47:59,920
And I thought the...

2663
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:00,580
Obviously...

2664
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:01,220
I mean not that.

2665
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:02,280
That's not an apex parody.

2666
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,800
That's like fucking Saitama.

2667
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,000
Saitama parody.

2668
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:05,980
One punch man parody.

2669
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,440
But uh...

2670
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,780
I had to pick between the dragoon or the tomato.

2671
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,960
And clearly I went with the better choice.

2672
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:13,880
Not gonna lie.

2673
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:15,760
Let's see.

2674
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:16,460
All right.

2675
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,900
I'm at page 11 guys.

2676
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,880
Give it up for page 11.

2677
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:20,020
11!

2678
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,200
Woo!

2679
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:22,760
I can't.

2680
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,100
I can't.

2681
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:24,620
God.

2682
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:26,640
I kept them only at page 11.

2683
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:27,740
Like what the fuck.

2684
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:28,580
Uh...

2685
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,060
Hahaha.

2686
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,880
There's 45 pages.

2687
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,500
Oh my god.

2688
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,600
This could be like...

2689
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:36,100
Oh my god.

2690
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:39,840
If I didn't have another stream, this stream would have gone on for a very long time.

2691
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,780
Page 11.

2692
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,220
You're almost there.

2693
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,780
We're almost there.

2694
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,180
Oh yeah.

2695
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,440
Here are like sticker concepts too.

2696
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,300
Like other...

2697
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:51,700
Um...

2698
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:52,640
Um...

2699
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:55,580
Other sticker concepts that we had.

2700
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:56,700
Uh...

2701
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:59,160
So we had other...

2702
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:05,840
Other stickers of everybody else as well as like different types of ideas that we were drafting up.

2703
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,040
Um...

2704
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:07,660
And everything.

2705
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,200
So these were like some of the sketches and ideas that some of the artists...

2706
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,500
The artist that was in charge of stickers and sprays that were...

2707
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,160
Um...

2708
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:18,480
Um...

2709
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,620
That gave us...

2710
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,240
Um...

2711
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:20,460
And stuff.

2712
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,520
Sorry.

2713
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,040
I'm not very good with words right now.

2714
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:23,760
Hahaha.

2715
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:34,820
Also, I don't know if you guys know this, but if you look closely at the 3D animation...

2716
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:35,760
Um...

2717
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:40,600
Of the 3D animation, you will notice that the guns have stickers on them.

2718
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:41,880
So these were like concept stickers.

2719
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:42,780
They're not the...

2720
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:46,020
I don't think these were everything, but we actually put like...

2721
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:46,440
We tried...

2722
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:47,500
You know, we made it...

2723
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:48,880
Make it incredibly immersive.

2724
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:49,740
Um...

2725
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:51,880
By the way, the full on credits is in my description.

2726
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:53,260
So, um...

2727
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,480
I posted like a credit list of every...

2728
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,300
Like, uh...

2729
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,520
They made a credits...

2730
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:58,240
Uh...

2731
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:01,020
Sheet of everybody and click on my description.

2732
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:01,560
You'll...

2733
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:02,800
You'll see like cred...

2734
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,220
Like a link to everybody.

2735
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:05,800
Hmm.

2736
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:10,200
So, it's more so like if you blink you miss it type deal.

2737
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,420
But the guns do actually have like stickers on them.

2738
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:15,420
Um...

2739
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:18,820
To like, you know, make it more immersive as of like, you know, the cost.

2740
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,900
Like, you know, the cosmetics of everything.

2741
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:22,020
Uh...

2742
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:24,380
So that it has like cosmetics and stuff.

2743
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:26,000
Um...

2744
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:26,460
Alright.

2745
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:27,380
I'm scrolling.

2746
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,060
Guys, I'm on page 12 now.

2747
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:30,320
Page 12!

2748
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,160
Give it up for page 12!

2749
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:38,340
We're...

2750
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,080
We're getting there!

2751
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:46,080
We're making it guys!

2752
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:47,840
Oh my god!

2753
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,860
Sorry, I'm still scrolling through.

2754
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:52,280
Because I want to look at things that I do want to actually show.

2755
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:57,360
There's a lot of like stuff in there that's like, oh we don't have to show that.

2756
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:58,720
We don't.

2757
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,120
Oh, here we go.

2758
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,520
Here's another concept we had.

2759
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:05,420
So, this one we only were shown two sketches.

2760
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:06,940
Um...

2761
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:08,140
Right here.

2762
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:09,080
Uh...

2763
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:12,120
Obviously, you can tell which one I ended up with.

2764
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:16,920
Because I felt like, you know, A was such a cool action pose and everything.

2765
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:17,820
And I felt like...

2766
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,040
You know, I wanted something more like badass.

2767
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,680
So, that's why I went with A instead of B.

2768
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:25,540
Because, you know, it looks fucking badass.

2769
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,220
Like...

2770
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,920
Like, what more do I have to...

2771
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,280
Remember to close your tabs, Doki.

2772
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,880
You don't want another blue screen.

2773
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:31,980
Remember to close your tabs!

2774
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:35,480
It's just something I tell myself.

2775
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,440
Doki, you have to close tabs.

2776
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,980
You can't keep everything open.

2777
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:43,920
Um...

2778
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:47,760
But yeah, that is why we went with A.

2779
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,920
In general.

2780
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,080
Because, like I said, we wanted something that looked like...

2781
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:53,600
Uh...

2782
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,420
That we wanted something that looked like, you know...

2783
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,140
Uh...

2784
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:59,240
Something that would look good on...

2785
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:00,740
On...

2786
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,040
Um...

2787
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,560
On, like...

2788
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,000
Uh...

2789
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,980
On the splash screen.

2790
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:08,140
And we wanted something more dynamic and more action-y.

2791
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,220
Also, here is the initial...

2792
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:13,220
One of the initial concepts for the...

2793
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,040
My fake battle net.

2794
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:17,740
Legally designed.

2795
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:18,800
Distinct battle net.

2796
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:19,480
Hahaha.

2797
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:26,540
If I was a game publishing company...

2798
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:27,160
Um...

2799
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,140
This is what my...

2800
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:28,840
Uh...

2801
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,260
This is what my client will look like.

2802
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:32,020
Um...

2803
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:33,520
So, like I said...

2804
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,080
Um...

2805
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,960
I said I wanted something like Steam or like Battle Net.

2806
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:38,120
Um...

2807
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,900
So...

2808
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:39,340
Uh...

2809
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:40,440
Yeah, Battle Bird.

2810
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:41,500
Battlebird.net.

2811
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:42,360
Hahaha.

2812
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,740
So, you can see that at first...

2813
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:47,780
It was just like names.

2814
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:48,580
But I requested.

2815
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:49,360
I was like...

2816
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:49,820
Okay.

2817
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,600
I want like actual fake game.

2818
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,900
I think this was the point where I was like...

2819
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,100
I want to include fake games.

2820
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:58,620
Because I don't want Battle Bird to be like the only game on my fake game client.

2821
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,480
And I said like to make it more immersive.

2822
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,020
The friends we're adding...

2823
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,120
They have to have usernames.

2824
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,000
Like, I wanted to make it...

2825
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,500
Because like we don't put our actual names.

2826
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,220
I say as I put Doki Bird as my Steam name.

2827
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:11,500
But like you know what I mean?

2828
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,960
Like if we're like, you know...

2829
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,520
If we're not just like content creators.

2830
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:15,960
Like we would have like...

2831
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,660
We wouldn't put...

2832
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,360
Our like...

2833
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,940
Our like, you know streamer name as our...

2834
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,260
Like on our friends list.

2835
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,500
We would have like some fucking dumbass name.

2836
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:24,020
Like...

2837
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:27,080
So that's the point where I was like...

2838
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,780
We have to change the...

2839
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:30,900
We have to change some of the names.

2840
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:35,740
Some of the names on some of the friends list.

2841
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:37,320
Because I want to be like, you know...

2842
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:38,460
It's the goon.

2843
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,240
So because it's the goon.

2844
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,300
I wanted to...

2845
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,640
I wanted to make sure that like...

2846
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,680
You know, it feels...

2847
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,740
Feels more...

2848
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,840
I keep saying immersive.

2849
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:53,500
But like that's literally my notes to them.

2850
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,600
Every time they're like, what do you think?

2851
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:58,180
I was like change this because I want to be immersive.

2852
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:01,160
Like I want to make it feel like you're...

2853
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,380
It could be real.

2854
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:08,260
Like this is something that you can actually see in the future.

2855
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,660
But not really because I don't...

2856
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,540
I'm not fucking like Gabe.

2857
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,060
Like...

2858
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,580
I'm not Gabe.

2859
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,640
I don't think I can make that...

2860
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:17,160
I don't think I can make this a reality.

2861
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,260
But like in an alternate universe, this could be real.

2862
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,540
So that's like a lot of my notes.

2863
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,560
Even like when we're doing sound design.

2864
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,740
Originally there was no...

2865
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,000
There was for sound design.

2866
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:36,420
What the very first video I was sent of everything put together.

2867
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:40,340
There was no game sound.

2868
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,640
Like game menu sound.

2869
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:43,440
So like, you know, when you're clicking on the game.

2870
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:45,480
It was like click, click beep beep.

2871
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:46,060
Bop bop.

2872
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,200
Like, you know, when you're clicking stuff.

2873
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:53,300
Like even like buying something on the game menu or like, you know, scrolling through and like queuing up.

2874
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:54,520
That was not there.

2875
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,480
I was like, this is not an immersive.

2876
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:02,160
We need to have like sounds of you clicking stuff.

2877
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,980
Of you like when you queue up, it goes click.

2878
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:06,600
When you queue get into a game.

2879
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:10,140
And then when you look at the character select and going through the characters.

2880
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:14,360
There's always a sound there when you pass by to another character.

2881
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,040
So like I was very...

2882
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:21,680
Very detailed with like very stickler with the attention to detail.

2883
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:26,540
Because it's the details that makes it like the sound design.

2884
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:27,520
It's literally...

2885
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,840
Yeah, the menu sound effects and everything.

2886
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:30,640
That wasn't there.

2887
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:32,040
The menu sound effects weren't there.

2888
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:35,960
So like I specifically was like super anal about that thing.

2889
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:36,580
Those things.

2890
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:40,780
Because like without it, it just seemed like a regular video.

2891
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:45,240
So like the sound design with things like that.

2892
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:45,980
Pushes.

2893
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,040
It's just a regular video.

2894
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:49,620
The something that was like, wait, is this real?

2895
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,120
Like...

2896
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:58,880
So it makes you be like, oh my God, wait, wait, is this like it makes you doubt yourself.

2897
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:02,260
And it makes you doubt yourself being like, wait, is this real?

2898
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,880
Which I saw in chat.

2899
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:09,060
It really did.

2900
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:12,760
Like people were like doubting themselves and be like, oh my God, wait a minute.

2901
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:14,460
Like am I looking at a...

2902
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:18,060
Like, is this going to be released to all of us?

2903
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:18,820
Like...

2904
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,900
Anyway, here's another one.

2905
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:25,360
Okay.

2906
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:28,160
I'm going to show this because you might notice something is very different.

2907
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:33,380
This was the original concept for the splash art.

2908
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:36,040
You can see that we changed some of the characters there.

2909
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:42,660
The reason why I changed some of the characters there was because I thought that a lot...

2910
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,880
Some of these people were around...

2911
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,960
Were already having a lot of fun.

2912
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,760
They had their own Easter egg.

2913
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,920
So I said like, okay, we're going to have to remove this.

2914
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,740
We have to remove that.

2915
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:58,540
Like I removed some people in there only because they already had their own appearances in a different area.

2916
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:06,100
And because of that, we swapped out some of the dragoons there because we want to be fair to...

2917
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:11,000
Because I know there's like other dragons that didn't show up that was in like the stickers and stuff like that.

2918
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,960
But we try to make it because I was like, okay, these guys showed up a lot.

2919
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:15,800
They already had...

2920
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,400
An appearance in that area.

2921
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:18,880
So I want to swap this...

2922
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:26,020
With somebody else because they didn't have as much screen time as the others.

2923
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:29,520
So that's why like, yeah, this was the original and that's like, remove me.

2924
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,320
Because I felt like I just wanted this to be like a dragon splash art.

2925
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,620
So I was like, remove me.

2926
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:39,160
I don't want to...

2927
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:43,500
I don't want to be in the saloon right now.

2928
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:45,780
Remove me.

2929
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,340
Now.

2930
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:49,880
Now I'm scrolling.

2931
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,100
I'm scrolling again, guys.

2932
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:51,500
I'm...

2933
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,060
Oh, okay.

2934
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:53,740
These, these, I really want to show you guys.

2935
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,300
Cause like, let's see.

2936
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:58,920
I know like, I'm trying to remember which one.

2937
01:57:59,000 --> 01:57:59,200
Okay.

2938
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:00,500
Oh, it's the egg.

2939
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:00,840
Okay.

2940
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,660
So I'm gonna show you guys a video.

2941
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:14,180
Because during the character select screen, there were some videos that were not shown because it got cut for time.

2942
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,780
So this was one of them.

2943
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,200
Which I thought was really cute.

2944
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:18,220
I thought...

2945
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:25,320
Like, you guys didn't see this, but he flipped over.

2946
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,580
Which I wanted you guys to see.

2947
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,560
I just wanted you guys to see him flip over.

2948
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:31,680
You guys weren't able to see that because it got cut.

2949
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,820
It got like cut in half.

2950
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,460
This is the character select screen.

2951
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:38,740
So that we had...

2952
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:42,100
I think the others didn't get cut in half as badly as the egg.

2953
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,740
So I'm just gonna have that play for a little bit in the background.

2954
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:48,840
While I look for more stuff to show you guys.

2955
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:51,900
Oh my gosh.

2956
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:57,680
I want to show you guys the concepts for some of the game icons.

2957
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,740
Because I thought they were really funny.

2958
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:03,900
Oh, here's another one.

2959
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,400
Here's another one.

2960
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:07,720
This one.

2961
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:12,400
This is another concept GUI that we had.

2962
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,720
Obviously, it got scrapped because the actual one looks a lot better.

2963
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:24,980
But this was some of the other concept art we had going into this.

2964
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:26,700
And oh, here we go.

2965
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,040
Okay, I found it.

2966
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:30,280
I found some of the logos and stuff.

2967
01:59:33,740 --> 01:59:36,580
There's another logo that we went in.

2968
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:42,120
So here's more like logo concepts and everything.

2969
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:45,720
Let's see.

2970
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:48,140
I'm trying to... I'm scrolling guys.

2971
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,520
Guys, I know I'm scrolling.

2972
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,320
We're at 22.

2973
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,720
Guys, we're getting there.

2974
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,820
Oh my god, we're at 22.

2975
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,740
Halfway there.

2976
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,420
We're halfway there.

2977
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,740
Holy shit.

2978
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:05,320
Oh yeah.

2979
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:06,880
You guys might not have seen this.

2980
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:09,820
This is also a blink and you miss it moment type deal.

2981
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:11,120
But here.

2982
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:13,940
So this was the cork board.

2983
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:14,700
Haha.

2984
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:15,380
Uh.

2985
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:15,800
Um.

2986
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:16,360
Uh.

2987
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,140
Behind us during the...

2988
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:18,700
Uh.

2989
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,180
During the...

2990
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:20,800
Uh.

2991
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:21,800
Buh buh buh buh.

2992
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:22,460
What's the word?

2993
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:23,060
Um.

2994
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,440
During the animation.

2995
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,500
So this was like the dragoons like board in the background.

2996
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:33,280
So like uh you see like you know their vacation photos.

2997
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,000
And then you guys trying to draw...

2998
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,880
Draw anime.

2999
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:37,840
Hahaha.

3000
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:41,720
Yes.

3001
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:42,800
Uh.

3002
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,160
Hahaha.

3003
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:45,360
Oh my god.

3004
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:45,720
Oh my god.

3005
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:46,480
Oh my god.

3006
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:47,020
Okay.

3007
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:47,760
Okay.

3008
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,340
There was...

3009
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:50,180
I was looking through chat messages.

3010
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:55,260
I was looking through the chat messages and I was like I need Thomas Edison on my friends list.

3011
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,680
Cause he's my oh she.

3012
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:59,900
And then someone in the chat was like are we talking...

3013
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:01,620
We're talking about this Thomas Edison right?

3014
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:02,200
Hahaha.

3015
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:05,860
And then...

3016
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:10,260
And then they're like are we talking about this Thomas Edison?

3017
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:11,140
Hahaha.

3018
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:12,760
And then like...

3019
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:15,340
And then they link the picture of Thomas Edison.

3020
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:17,240
Like there's...

3021
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:17,580
There's...

3022
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:19,620
We're not talking about something else right?

3023
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,180
This Thomas Edison right?

3024
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,020
Hahaha.

3025
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:28,200
They linked the picture of Thomas Edison.

3026
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:32,480
Like I know it's confusing for those who didn't watch the climbing stream.

3027
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,800
And you're gonna be like okay like...

3028
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,820
Like she's not fucking with us right?

3029
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:37,420
Like that.

3030
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:41,240
Is there like something I should know regarding Thomas Edison?

3031
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,180
Like is there somebody else?

3032
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:43,980
Hahaha.

3033
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:44,220
Hahaha.

3034
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:46,620
Look okay.

3035
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,700
When I say like...

3036
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:53,580
Okay if you heard this with no contest and I'd be like Thomas Edison is my oh she.

3037
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:54,340
Like oh qu...

3038
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:54,660
I...

3039
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:55,800
You'd be confused.

3040
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,560
Like it's understandable.

3041
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,260
I...

3042
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:01,340
It's understandable why they were...

3043
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:06,840
They were so confused as to like what the fuck is she talking about?

3044
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:10,340
Why does she want Thomas Edison in her game?

3045
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:11,680
Um...

3046
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,300
Anyway.

3047
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:14,560
So we also had...

3048
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:15,440
Oh yeah Retro Doki.

3049
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:17,360
This was a Retro Doki's original...

3050
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,980
Retro Retro Retro Doki.

3051
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:21,680
Original like uh polygon model.

3052
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:22,740
Um...

3053
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:23,740
I didn't like the hat.

3054
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:25,480
Being like...

3055
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:25,940
Pshhh...

3056
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:27,540
So we changed that.

3057
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:30,840
So this was the original hat of it.

3058
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:31,620
And then we...

3059
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:35,380
We changed it to something like uh...

3060
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:36,120
Uh...

3061
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:37,200
I didn't explain...

3062
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,400
Okay look I was like...

3063
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,440
He's my oh she.

3064
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:42,020
That's all I need to explain.

3065
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:42,740
Hahaha.

3066
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,180
Right?

3067
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:43,280
Hahaha.

3068
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:45,100
That's all I need to say.

3069
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,600
He's my oh she.

3070
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,280
You don't explain your oh she's.

3071
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:51,340
Like it's just your oh she.

3072
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,240
Hahaha.

3073
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:55,020
Anyway.

3074
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,460
And then this is what it um...

3075
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,560
Um...

3076
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:02,240
This is what it ended up look liking...

3077
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:07,820
Uh look like because like I said like I didn't like how the hat protrude a lot.

3078
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:10,740
So I requested that to be changed.

3079
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:11,620
I was like no.

3080
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,100
Haha.

3081
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:12,880
No.

3082
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:15,260
I want the hat to look like that.

3083
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:16,960
Hahahahaha.

3084
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:17,960
Alright.

3085
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:19,660
I'm scrolling.

3086
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:23,620
We are at page 26 now.

3087
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:24,960
Guys we're almost there.

3088
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:26,520
We're so close.

3089
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,020
Hahahahaha.

3090
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:30,020
Hahahahaha.

3091
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:33,300
I'm looking through if there's like anything like um...

3092
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:37,340
And we do make an oh look oh my god this is so cute though but uh...

3093
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,080
This is so cute but look at this.

3094
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:41,280
Look at retro polygon.

3095
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:42,840
Um...

3096
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,120
Look at this.

3097
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,280
Oh my god.

3098
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:47,380
This is so cute.

3099
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,560
I actually really like Retro Polygon Doki.

3100
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,620
What the fuck?

3101
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:52,340
This is so cute.

3102
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,880
I didn't even see this.

3103
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:57,440
I was so busy I didn't even see this.

3104
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,080
Oh my god.

3105
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:04,620
Oh sorry, the staff team really wanted me to show you guys this, but they unintentionally made a dick.

3106
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:06,960
You guys might be like, what does that mean?

3107
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:10,720
Okay, so if YouTube takes this down, you know why.

3108
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:12,340
I'm gonna risk it.

3109
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:21,620
So, this is what the map looked like.

3110
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:22,900
And they accidentally...

3111
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:29,140
They zoomed out and they realized they accidentally made this.

3112
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:37,060
They're like, oh my god, I zoomed out.

3113
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,140
Like, what the fuck?

3114
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:42,780
Wait, when did this happen?

3115
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:44,960
When did this happen?

3116
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:50,000
But this is in the map somehow.

3117
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:53,800
I don't know if it's still in it, but this was what... it was there.

3118
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:56,200
Also, here's a scrapped horror.

3119
02:04:56,580 --> 02:05:01,140
At first, before we had Duck by Daylight, we had this.

3120
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:09,080
I don't know what the parody was, honestly, but this was like a horror game icon parody of like the rabbits sewn together.

3121
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:12,460
So this was like one of the parodies that we had.

3122
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:15,640
Um... let's see.

3123
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:19,100
I wonder if I sent you my big please respond.

3124
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:21,280
Thank you for the super chat.

3125
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:22,280
No, thank you.

3126
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:23,000
Thank you.

3127
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:27,900
Did I say there's anything else that I want to show you guys?

3128
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,840
If there's anything.

3129
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:31,300
Oh yeah, I wonder if we guys saw...

3130
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:34,260
I feel like... no, I've shown some of these before.

3131
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:36,220
Um...

3132
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:38,620
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

3133
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,380
Oh, we're at 33.

3134
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:40,080
Oh!

3135
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:41,980
Okay, here's another thing I wanted to show you guys.

3136
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:44,220
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

3137
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,260
Okay, it's a video.

3138
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,380
Um... but it is basically the concept.

3139
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:53,160
I think it was a concept video of...

3140
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:56,300
Oh wait, before I show you guys this, but look at this though.

3141
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:58,940
Look at this.

3142
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:05,590
I'm sorry, this was very important for me to show you.

3143
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:10,890
I'm sorry, this was important!

3144
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:13,850
It was so important!

3145
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:15,910
You don't understand!

3146
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:18,970
This is very important.

3147
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:21,530
Anyway, what I actually wanted to show you guys.

3148
02:06:21,730 --> 02:06:25,850
This was the original, um...

3149
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:30,970
Anime... uh... the storyboard for, um... how...

3150
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:34,730
It was gonna be the storyboard of like everything.

3151
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:38,410
So like how this was all gonna be done and everything.

3152
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:42,370
So you can see game, company name, Lamal, game name.

3153
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:49,710
Original game theme plays.

3154
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:51,370
But yeah, this was like blocked out.

3155
02:06:51,610 --> 02:06:52,590
Or everything.

3156
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:53,490
So...

3157
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,170
Maybe... yeah, like finding lobby.

3158
02:06:57,630 --> 02:07:00,330
So I'll show you guys this while I look through more concepts.

3159
02:07:05,610 --> 02:07:08,070
I've already seen it, so like I don't have to...

3160
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:08,390
I don't have to...

3161
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:10,870
I can multitask and look through this real fast.

3162
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:12,310
Okay.

3163
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:13,650
Um...

3164
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:16,930
But yeah, that was the original concept video of like...

3165
02:07:16,930 --> 02:07:19,610
Blocking everything out for everybody.

3166
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:23,170
So they know exactly like, okay, what we sort of need to do.

3167
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:24,970
And like, um...

3168
02:07:26,350 --> 02:07:28,310
What... what must be done.

3169
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:30,430
Like what kind of GUI we have to do.

3170
02:07:30,630 --> 02:07:32,370
What kind of... uh...

3171
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:34,410
What kind of... um...

3172
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:37,430
Uh...

3173
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:38,830
I guess like...

3174
02:07:39,570 --> 02:07:41,330
What assets we need.

3175
02:07:41,490 --> 02:07:43,210
We need... what materials.

3176
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:45,710
Uh... Raggy did the animation.

3177
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:49,650
Uh... I believe Boldy did the storyboard.

3178
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:51,410
Like the animation storyboard.

3179
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:53,710
Um... video storyboard.

3180
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:54,990
But I have to double check.

3181
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:55,910
I might be wrong.

3182
02:07:56,070 --> 02:07:57,570
Because I can be wrong.

3183
02:07:57,710 --> 02:07:58,730
I can be wrong.

3184
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:01,310
I can be wrong.

3185
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:02,730
I won't...

3186
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:06,530
I won't be surprised if I'm wrong.

3187
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:07,430
I... I...

3188
02:08:08,450 --> 02:08:09,170
I'm tired.

3189
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:14,110
There's... there's a lot going on.

3190
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:17,750
That I may or may not remember.

3191
02:08:19,290 --> 02:08:20,210
Oh, here we go.

3192
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:21,310
I wanted to show you guys this.

3193
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:22,910
But this was like the original...

3194
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:24,490
Um...

3195
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:26,230
Let's see.

3196
02:08:26,350 --> 02:08:29,070
I think this was the original Dokiverse video.

3197
02:08:29,390 --> 02:08:30,410
I'm gonna double check.

3198
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:31,830
Because... yeah.

3199
02:08:32,190 --> 02:08:32,590
Okay.

3200
02:08:33,050 --> 02:08:35,970
Yeah, this was the original Dokiverse logo by the way.

3201
02:08:36,530 --> 02:08:38,290
Um... that I'm gonna show you guys soon.

3202
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:39,570
But yes.

3203
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:41,230
Here's the storyboard.

3204
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:42,030
Woo!

3205
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:43,690
It looks so good.

3206
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:46,310
I can't believe Raggy did all...

3207
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:47,490
Like she didn't do the background.

3208
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:49,590
Um...

3209
02:08:49,590 --> 02:08:51,010
Um... she wanted to.

3210
02:08:51,090 --> 02:08:52,270
But we were like...

3211
02:08:52,270 --> 02:08:53,070
No.

3212
02:08:55,570 --> 02:09:00,410
Originally she almost decided to do the background.

3213
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:04,730
Anyway, this is what the Dokiverse logo was originally gonna be.

3214
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:05,790
But we changed it.

3215
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:06,770
Because we thought that...

3216
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:07,810
Um...

3217
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:08,510
I don't know.

3218
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:10,270
It looked really plain originally.

3219
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:12,450
So that's why we changed the...

3220
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:13,810
Um... which...

3221
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:15,730
The other one was where it flew in.

3222
02:09:15,930 --> 02:09:16,690
I thought like the...

3223
02:09:16,690 --> 02:09:18,710
It sliding in just looked way too plain.

3224
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:19,990
So that's why we removed it.

3225
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:22,530
To make it so that it actually like...

3226
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:23,190
Uh...

3227
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:25,310
Flew in and stuff.

3228
02:09:25,670 --> 02:09:26,190
Um...

3229
02:09:26,190 --> 02:09:27,230
Yeah, like...

3230
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:29,670
The fact that she wanted to do all that herself.

3231
02:09:29,850 --> 02:09:30,370
Like...

3232
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:32,210
Originally everything...

3233
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:33,530
A little crazy.

3234
02:09:34,010 --> 02:09:34,530
Hahaha!

3235
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:34,930
Hahaha!

3236
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:36,790
Hahaha!

3237
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:37,270
Hahaha!

3238
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:38,770
Like...

3239
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:39,050
Yes.

3240
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:40,670
We're all workaholics here.

3241
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:42,730
But there is like a stopping point.

3242
02:09:42,930 --> 02:09:45,010
Of where you have to just stop.

3243
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:45,810
Hahaha!

3244
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:46,990
Hahaha!

3245
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:47,670
Hahaha!

3246
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:48,890
So...

3247
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:49,170
Yeah.

3248
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:50,590
We did stop her.

3249
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:51,210
Hahaha!

3250
02:09:51,210 --> 02:09:51,730
We...

3251
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:53,430
We stopped her.

3252
02:09:54,270 --> 02:09:54,570
Um...

3253
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:56,630
Because we were like...

3254
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:56,810
Yeah.

3255
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:57,430
That's...

3256
02:09:58,610 --> 02:09:59,650
That's not...

3257
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:00,750
That's not ideal.

3258
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:02,430
That's not ideal at all.

3259
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:03,570
Uh...

3260
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:04,510
Let me say this again.

3261
02:10:04,510 --> 02:10:06,710
I don't know if there's anything else that I really want to showcase to you guys.

3262
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:07,330
Oh here.

3263
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:08,030
Look at him.

3264
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:09,350
Look at this big boy.

3265
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:10,270
Alright.

3266
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:11,170
We're gonna call it...

3267
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:11,870
End it here guys.

3268
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:12,790
Look at this big boy.

3269
02:10:12,910 --> 02:10:13,150
Woah!

3270
02:10:13,850 --> 02:10:14,170
Hahaha!

3271
02:10:15,690 --> 02:10:16,010
Hahaha!

3272
02:10:16,010 --> 02:10:16,270
Hahaha!

3273
02:10:17,730 --> 02:10:18,370
Next scene.

3274
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:19,030
Thank you for the super chat.

3275
02:10:19,070 --> 02:10:19,310
Thank you.

3276
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:19,610
Thank you.

3277
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,810
Imagine wanting to do everything yourself.

3278
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:21,530
Couldn be Doki.

3279
02:10:21,630 --> 02:10:22,330
Thank you for the super chat.

3280
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:22,630
Thank you.

3281
02:10:22,650 --> 02:10:22,970
Thank you.

3282
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:24,970
I'm slowly learning how to delegate though.

3283
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:25,590
For real.

3284
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:27,170
I'm slowly learning how to...

3285
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:27,930
Uh...

3286
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:29,670
Delegate to my staff members.

3287
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:30,590
To help me on stuff.

3288
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:31,550
Because like...

3289
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:35,090
I am definitely stretching myself in on a lot of things.

3290
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:36,510
And um...

3291
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:38,210
I've been noticing that.

3292
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:38,730
And...

3293
02:10:38,730 --> 02:10:41,150
Because I want to do so many things.

3294
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:43,930
But then I realized that's too many things.

3295
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:49,950
So I'm slowly learning how to delegate and getting my staff members more involved in some of my work.

3296
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:52,130
Um...

3297
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:54,690
And it's been a huge journey.

3298
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:55,590
Um...

3299
02:10:55,590 --> 02:10:56,590
Oh yes!

3300
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:57,670
The orchestra.

3301
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,750
So like I...

3302
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,490
Um...

3303
02:11:00,490 --> 02:11:00,570
I...

3304
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:01,050
Yes!

3305
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:01,730
Okay.

3306
02:11:01,810 --> 02:11:02,230
So...

3307
02:11:02,230 --> 02:11:04,950
The reason why I hired this person...

3308
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:06,550
I had four different composers.

3309
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:10,330
Because I wanted to like work with a lot of different composers just to...

3310
02:11:10,330 --> 02:11:11,730
Because um...

3311
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:12,950
I think music...

3312
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:14,190
I feel like I wanted...

3313
02:11:14,190 --> 02:11:16,830
I wanted more connections within the music um...

3314
02:11:17,850 --> 02:11:18,450
Industry...

3315
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:18,690
Okay.

3316
02:11:18,810 --> 02:11:19,350
I don't know.

3317
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:19,930
Industry.

3318
02:11:20,070 --> 02:11:23,070
I guess like within the music areas in Vtubing.

3319
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:26,770
Because I feel like that's something I heavily lacked in terms of connections.

3320
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:30,550
And like I don't really know like much about music.

3321
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:31,450
In general.

3322
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:32,510
Um...

3323
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:34,670
So that's why like I hired four different composers.

3324
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:38,070
Because I wanted to see like how these four different composers um...

3325
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:39,350
Handle my...

3326
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:40,130
What I want.

3327
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:41,250
Like my music requests.

3328
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:42,030
Um...

3329
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:44,550
Just so like I realize like um...

3330
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:46,870
What it...

3331
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:48,670
And you know I can always have uh...

3332
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:51,910
I can use the music for anything in the future and everything.

3333
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:53,590
So um...

3334
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:57,610
One of them was a composer that specializes in orchestra arrangements.

3335
02:11:57,950 --> 02:12:00,530
I didn't think he was gonna actually hire a real orchestra.

3336
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:01,650
Um...

3337
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:02,050
In the beginning.

3338
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:04,290
Because I just wanted like you know I thought he was just...

3339
02:12:04,290 --> 02:12:04,730
I...

3340
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:08,210
Originally I was like oh maybe I didn't realize it was like an actual orchestra.

3341
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:10,370
I thought he did it all in his program.

3342
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:13,150
And later he was like do you want me to hire an orchestra?

3343
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:15,010
I was like that's a lot of money.

3344
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:19,830
I was just like I don't know man.

3345
02:12:19,950 --> 02:12:21,010
That's a lot of money.

3346
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:22,170
And...

3347
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:23,790
And then he was like no it's okay.

3348
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:25,770
I have actually have a second booking.

3349
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:26,930
Like um...

3350
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:29,530
Actually was gonna use this orchestra for another client.

3351
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:30,410
Um...

3352
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:31,690
And like um...

3353
02:12:31,690 --> 02:12:36,110
We can use that booking to also do the songs to the song.

3354
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:37,050
And I was like...

3355
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:38,470
And he'll be like it'll be cheaper.

3356
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:39,130
And I was like...

3357
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:40,290
And then I heard it'll be cheaper.

3358
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:41,630
So then I was like...

3359
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:42,250
Okay.

3360
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:48,210
I did not realize what orchestra he hired by the...

3361
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:48,550
Okay.

3362
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:49,690
I don't know.

3363
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:51,550
When I saw the invoice...

3364
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:53,570
By the way I need to pay the invoice by the way.

3365
02:12:53,610 --> 02:12:54,290
I need to pay the invoice.

3366
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:57,170
But like when I saw the invoice for it.

3367
02:12:57,290 --> 02:12:59,370
He also did like three tracks.

3368
02:12:59,370 --> 02:13:01,470
But like when I saw the invoice.

3369
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:03,770
I was like this is cheaper.

3370
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:12,950
I did...

3371
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:15,370
I saw it.

3372
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:16,270
I saw it.

3373
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:18,070
I was like this is cheaper.

3374
02:13:18,610 --> 02:13:20,730
I didn't know.

3375
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:22,190
Oh my god.

3376
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:23,390
I didn't know.

3377
02:13:25,610 --> 02:13:26,210
I didn't know.

3378
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:29,550
I didn't know.

3379
02:13:30,370 --> 02:13:30,810
Oh my god.

3380
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:33,050
The price for the orchestra.

3381
02:13:33,070 --> 02:13:51,190
Apparently I got the cheaper version because I was mooching off somebody else's like booking I was mooching off someone else's like his another clients booking up the orchestra So we technically split the cost for the orchestra.

3382
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:54,490
So I was like holy that was cheaper

3383
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:15,130
Oh my god I was equally as shocked because I didn't realize also I didn't realize this orchestra played for like Famous movies and video games.

3384
02:14:15,310 --> 02:14:22,610
I thought he was gonna hire some fucking random orchestra Not some fucking Oscar winning fucking orchestra

3385
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:30,670
I Didn't know but it was worth it.

3386
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:42,070
It was so cool It was it was really cool though in the end I saw the video I was like Jesus Christ, okay

3387
02:14:48,610 --> 02:14:59,110
It's the orchestra I was like I was also like no way You guys all saw the video?

3388
02:14:59,290 --> 02:15:02,030
I saw the video for the first time too

3389
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:15,290
Even I was like no fucking way It was insane, I was like I'm insane

3390
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:27,190
Oh my god I used I didn't use the back Battle theme, because that was the battle theme that he gave me.

3391
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:30,790
I used the... he made a happy theme that wasn't shown in the video.

3392
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:34,330
There was a happy theme, there was a chill theme, and there was a battle theme.

3393
02:15:34,450 --> 02:15:36,490
I used the happy theme in the debut.

3394
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:39,890
Um... but yeah, that shit was insane.

3395
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:41,190
That shit was intense.

3396
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:44,210
Oh my god, it was crazy amazing.

3397
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:46,090
I was so surprised.

3398
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:51,890
Like, it was so cool watching an actual orchestra play, like, something I commissioned.

3399
02:15:52,730 --> 02:15:56,030
Um... but yeah, huge shoutout to that guy for making that possible.

3400
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:59,650
Like I said, I commissioned him because I saw that he does, like, orchestra arrangements.

3401
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:04,350
And I didn't realize they were actual, real orchestra arrangements until he, like, told me in the DM.

3402
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:05,350
I was like, you know what?

3403
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:09,050
And then he was like, oh, but it'll be cheaper because we're gonna split the cost of another client.

3404
02:16:09,170 --> 02:16:10,150
And I was like, oh, it'll be cheaper?

3405
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:11,930
Okay then, I'll take it.

3406
02:16:11,970 --> 02:16:12,310
I'll do it.

3407
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:12,530
You know what?

3408
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:13,250
Fuck it, I'll do it.

3409
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:16,170
And I didn't realize, and I looked at the invoice, and I was like, that was cheaper.

3410
02:16:21,070 --> 02:16:21,870
I didn't realize.

3411
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:23,470
It still blows my mind.

3412
02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:26,670
I'm like, I like, look at the invoice, like, that's cheaper?

3413
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:31,010
Many, thank you for the super chat.

3414
02:16:31,070 --> 02:16:31,390
Thank you.

3415
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:35,530
We need as a BGN to get as much mileage as you can.

3416
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:41,000
Oh my god.

3417
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:42,460
But yeah, oh my god.

02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:45,340
That, that, that, that shit was insane.

02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:47,160
It was so cool.

3420
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:49,640
It was actually so fucking cool.

3421
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:56,040
Um... I, oh my, I, I, you know, words can actually describe how I feel about the orchestra.

3422
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:59,300
Because when I watched the video, I was like, oh my god, this is beautiful.

3423
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:05,360
I was like, a real orchestra, an orchestra that has played, okay, alright.

3424
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,180
Like, it actually played for, like, Genshin Impact 2.

3425
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,520
I was like, what the fuck?

3426
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:18,380
It, it's done, like, okay, it's, okay, I need to look at, like, guys, what has it done?

3427
02:17:18,380 --> 02:17:20,360
Haha, Wikipedia.

3428
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:21,720
Alright.

3429
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:23,640
It's done so much shit.

3430
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:25,260
I, I don't even know, man.

3431
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:27,300
I don't even know.

3432
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:31,420
I just know it's done, like, a lot of movies and games.

3433
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:36,980
I, I know it, it did, like, orchestra, like, songs for Genshin Impact 2.

3434
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,120
It did Skyrim.

3435
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:41,480
It did fucking Skyrim!

3436
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:42,740
Oh my god.

3437
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:45,400
It played music for Skyrim.

3438
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:46,280
Oh my god.

3439
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:47,680
Um, and everything.

3440
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:48,360
Um...

3441
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:49,140
But yeah.

3442
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,500
Alright, that's all I want to say.

3443
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:56,960
Uh, uh, the entire Faren South... Bro, oh my god.

3444
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,320
Put my name in that Wikipedia for the resume.

3445
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:08,720
It, it also did a song for Doki Bird, a random VTube, indie VTuber.

3446
02:18:14,210 --> 02:18:19,550
It did a song for a random indie VTuber too, by the way.

3447
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:22,870
Anyway.

3448
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:24,750
Off to my next stream, guys.

3449
02:18:24,950 --> 02:18:25,710
I'm gonna call it here.

3450
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:28,690
I need at least, like, 10 minutes of rest before I get into my next stream.

3451
02:18:29,170 --> 02:18:30,830
Um, I hope you guys enjoyed the behind the scenes.

3452
02:18:30,990 --> 02:18:35,490
I'll talk to the project team if they're open, willing to make an art book out of this.

3453
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:36,190
Um...

3454
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:37,650
Anyway.

3455
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:41,110
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

3456
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:42,870
Get up and run around to get that blood flowing.

3457
02:18:42,970 --> 02:18:46,950
And if you stay up for me, uh, maybe stay up for a little bit longer, because we're playing Apex next.

3458
02:18:47,090 --> 02:18:47,510
Anyway, guys.

3459
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:48,630
See you guys next time.

3460
02:18:48,630 --> 02:18:49,730
Or, next stream.

3461
02:18:50,910 --> 02:18:51,850
Bye, everybody!

3462
02:18:52,350 --> 02:18:52,910
Bye!
