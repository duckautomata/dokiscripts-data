00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,060
Hey guys, Kumi here wants to say something for all of us.

2
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,180
You still don't believe me?

3
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,160
We're actually live, you bitch!

4
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,800
You can't pull the same shit on me three times.

5
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,940
We're actually live!

6
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,040
Finally, I tried to pretend to be going live two times
before.

7
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,100
Hold on.

8
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,440
And she didn't believe me.

9
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,880
And now that we're actually live, She's nasty.

10
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,020
Please!

11
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,160
Give me my baby, please!

12
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,580
Holy shit.

13
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,740
I fucking muted you instantly.

14
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Hey, you told me to bake.

15
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,680
You told me.

16
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,440
You told me to bake.

17
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,380

18
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,660

19
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,120

20
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,780
Hey!

21
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,520
Hey!

22
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,480
I told you to warn your sound guy.

23
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,440
Hey!

24
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,620

25
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,680
That was...

26
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,060
Sorry.

27
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,500
I did not realize I had to turn that way down.

28
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,600
No, you told me to beg, and I said I was gonna put my
begging pants on.

29
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,480
You were like, okay, I'm like, okay, tell your sound guy.

30
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,940
And you're like, why?

31
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,580
Oh my God.

33
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,180
I'm so sorry, everybody.

34
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,440
I did not realize how loud that loud was going to be.

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,040
And it was, it was like, this guy really, Gumi really wants
to be mod.

36
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,520
So I was like, just beg for it.

37
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,360
I was like, but I was like, not right now, though.

38
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
Do it while we're streaming.

39
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,600
Do it.

40
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,180
It's for the whole world to see.

41
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,420

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,620
I don't know how I went the wrong way.

159
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,960
Guys, there is a possibility that I went the wrong way.

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,820
I don't know how.

161
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,580

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,240
Okay.

Oh my god, you're so smart.

191
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,200
This is why we got married in the first place.

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,140
You just...

193
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,080
You knew the answers that I don't.

194
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,420
Alright, water this plant.

195
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,600
Yay!

196
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,920
Where do I go?

197
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,120
I need to reconnect the fish.

198
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,000
You gotta reconnect the what?

199
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,960
The fish.

200
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,040
The fish?

201
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,400
What the fuck is the fish?

202
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
We just have to chop it all up, right?

203
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,180
Oh, I hope it's that simple.

204
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,540
Okay.

205
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm growing the leaves.

206
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm growing the leaves.

207
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,540
Here you go.

208
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,240
Is that much better, my queen?

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,240
Is that a better leaf grow for you, queen?

210
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,960
Yeah, that's good enough.

211
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,000
You're so demanding.

212
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,680
Oh, guys, I'm...

213
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,740
Volume check.

214
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,740
Fuck off.

215
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,240
Oh, wow.

216
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,700
What's this?

217
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,220
Okay, here you go.

218
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,200
How do I do I do this again?

219
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,780
I don't remember.

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,640
I'll pull it.

221
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,000
Pull.

222
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,140
And then...

223
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,800
Open up.

224
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,820
Oh my god!

225
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,340
In front of me?

226
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,340
You're gonna do that in front of me?

227
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,980
I knew it.

228
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,040
Dude, you want me to let him fucking die?

229
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,920
Wait, am I a cuck?

230
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,480
Did you hear that?

231
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,320
Yes.

232
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,520
What the fuck?

233
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,140
Yes, what was it?

234
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,820
What the fuck is that?

235
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,220
What the fuck?

236
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,520
Oh, that's not a ball.

237
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,940
Oh, that is not a... Yeah.

238
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,220
Oh, wait.

239
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,820
How do I fucking contribute?

240
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,440
Fucking...

241
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,460
Oh, oh, like this!

242
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm holding on!

243
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,420
Water it, water it!

244
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,720
Oh, okay, never mind.

245
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,400
I guess you have to beat him up.

246
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,540
Do something!

247
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,660
I can't attack!

248
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh, my god!

249
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,560
There's a

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,900
creeps on me!

251
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,580
What can I do?

252
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,500
I literally can't.

253
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,300
I can't do anything!

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,080
Oh, I can attack.

255
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,840
By the way, I can also attack.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
If you also want to know.

257
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,880
I held it!

258
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,400
I held it with my fucking life.

259
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,320
Mine grows up.

260
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:43,860
Ow!

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,460
Oh, okay.

262
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,260
That's on you.

263
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,600
I held it.

264
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,220
Oh, okay.

265
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,400
Um, um, um, um, um, just dodge.

266
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Why can't you jump?

267
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,200
I just dodged.

268
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,820
I'm melee, man.

269
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,080
There you go.

270
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,280
Look, I held him.

271
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,460
I'm holding him by the neck.

272
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,340
I'm watching all happen in front of me.

273
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,060
See, look at that.

274
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,760
I dodged.

275
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,000
It's just that easy.

276
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,600
Just move to the left and the right.

277
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
Damn, we barked things.

278
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
We did it!

279
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,860
We whipped them into shape, didn't we?

280
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
Where'd we go now?

281
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,560
Oh, okay.

282
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,220
Good one.

283
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,680
Bro, I don't know how to tend a garden, apparently.

284
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,180
Yeah.

285
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,760
Skirt and fucking sucks.

286
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,180
I don't know.

287
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,760
Raising our daughter because somebody else wouldn't.

288
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,100
She's at school.

289
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,780
She's literally 10 years old.

290
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,500
She's literally at home right now.

291
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,820
It's the weekend.

292
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,800
It's the weekend.

293
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,200
Oh, now you fucking realize what day it is.

294
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:42,980
Wow.

295
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,400
I can't believe it.

296
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,320
You don't even care.

297
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,140
You come home late at night at like 9 p.m.

298
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,960
Every fucking day.

299
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,380
Well, I have to raise our daughter.

300
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:19,020
raise what jeremy who's jeremy jeremy um your boss no no i
didn't know i have to get a raise somehow is this is this

301
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:31,060
why you came home with a new car that night i thought you
got a promotion i did get a promotion and a new car what did

302
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:52,080
you do for that promotion you know I I just wanted to oh boy
oh boy oh boy everything's infected there's still time I

303
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:59,420
need to run kill the infection and make your garden bloom
again Sometimes, okay, I feel like this game is giving the

304
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:07,020
wrong message because it's teaching people that like you can
like you can fix a marriage Even if they want to get a

305
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,500
divorce, but just let people get a divorce like what the
fuck?

306
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,940
It should be normalized.

307
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,780
I kind of understand it because there is a kid involved in
everything But like if the marriage is already sort of like

308
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,420
that bad like I feel like if you're to the point where
you're like this close to getting divorced I don't think you

309
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:42,620
should force yourself to like make it work oh hey here it is
jump further than me that's easy all right here we go how do

310
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:53,860
i wee wee dude i used to be so scared of this shit

311
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:09,820
what the fuck oh yes what the hell i was more patient than
you for once in my life you a champion wait is that how

312
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:16,500
momentum works because i thought if you go all the way up
yeah but i didn't go all the way like around so like i had

313
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,500
more momentum going off because i i got off it looked like
it was all the way at the top yeah i had like i didn't do it

314
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,200
when i was like all the way up to the top

315
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,130
Like someone super chatted like that's what you get for
marrying A woman with the name ho at the end

316
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,420
Wait, what are you doing?

317
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,040
Is that racially motivated?

318
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,620
What do you what do you want to know?

319
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm a goofy ho Is that racially motivated?

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,500
It's a Korean word.

321
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,480
Is that racially motivated?

322
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
Who's saying that?

323
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,880
Who's disrespecting it?

324
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,240

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,480
That's like a tree!

365
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,760
Okay, I've got- they go me.

366
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,800
Ignore him!

367
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,940
Think about the big guy!

368
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Just run past him!

369
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:49,980
I can't!

370
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,660
It makes me auto-lock him!

371
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,180
Just fucking look past him!

372
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,140
There you go, I did it.

373
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,120
Okay, it's fine.

374
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,120
I'll help you.

375
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,560
See, don't forget who helped you.

376
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,760
Watch out, babe.

377
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,360
More creatures.

378
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,420
Oh, shit.

379
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,160
There you go.

380
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,840
I did it.

381
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,660
I pulled him.

382
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,920
Ignore the others.

383
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,800
They don't matter.

384
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,840
They're just babies.

385
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,400
Okay.

386
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm holding on him.

387
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,320
I'm holding on him.

388
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,080
Ignore the others.

389
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,820
What are you going to do?

390
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,360
Kill you?

391
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,460
I like how I don't know.

392
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,240
Look at my health pool.

393
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,680
You're literally full HP.

394
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,540
You're literally full HP.

399
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:24,440
accidentally step on them it's not like i did it on purpose
and then because like the whole walkway because i have to go

400
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,840

a path for me.

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
Oh, he's such a cute spider.

402
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,440
A ride to the other side.

403
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,960
I hope it eats.

404
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
All right.

No, that somebody was my dad.

407
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,680
He would, like, make a pathway for me to walk through
because the whole pathway was filled with snails.

408
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,160
But then you can hear the audible crunch, too.

409
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,680
No!

410
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,020
No!

411
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
What about you?

412
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,960
We'll find another one.

413
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,460
Come on.

414
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,790
You need a win.

415
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,130
Yay!

416
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,330
Wait, what do I do?

417
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:23,870
What do I do?

418
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,290
What do I do?

419
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,110
Why do you left?

420
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,090
What?

421
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,230
That's what the web was for!

422
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,710
Hello?

423
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,790
Hello?

424
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,970
Are you going to do anything?

425
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,710
Hello?

426
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,730
I don't know how to use it.

427
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,930
I mean, you don't know how to use it.

428
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,910
Okay, figure out how to use it before I do anything.

429
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,690
Okay, what are you doing?

430
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,650
What is that?

431
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,970
What are you doing?

432
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,290
I don't know!

433
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,970
Okay, I'm flying!

434
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,670
Oh, are you...

435
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,550
Oh, okay.

436
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:54,950
Okay.

437
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,470
Do you know what to do now?

438
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,390
Why the fuck does he go hypers?

439
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,390
What the fuck?

440
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,250
Wait, what's going on?

441
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,390
Okay.

442
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,190
Oh!

443
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,550
Nice.

444
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,310
Just keep filling it.

445
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,630
Just keep filling it.

446
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,430
Just keep filling it.

447
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,330
Alright, we're good.

448
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,830
I'm out.

449
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,530
I'm on the other side.

450
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,670
You can come back now.

451
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,730
I miss going hiking in the forest.

452
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,170
Where do we go?

453
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,990
This way.

454
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,490
Why don't you go?

455
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,090
Hypers!

456
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,030
No?

457
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,530
Hypers!

458
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,590
I found more.

459
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,210
Oh, it's another spider for me?

460
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,550
It's for me!

461
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,390
Oh yeah!

462
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,470
We get to ride our spiders together.

463
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,810
Come on, spider, you're free to go.

464
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,990
Oh my god, they're a couple!

465
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,570
Get divorced now before she takes everything.

466
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,910
Oh, back that thing up.

467
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,730
Nice!

468
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,870
Do spiders, I thought spiders like, don't have, like,
husband and wives.

469
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,570
The female spider just eats the fucking male spider.

470
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:17,290
I thought like most insects just like eat the other one
after they after they bang i like how somebody was like

471
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:32,530
their siblings i mean they're bugs they don't care if

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,350

473
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,270
Oh, I forgot how.

474
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,330
Okay, I figured it out.

475
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,650
I forgot the controls all of a sudden.

476
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,330
Where are we going?

477
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,230
Oh.

478
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,510
Wait for me!

479
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,790
I've never had a pet spider.

480
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,130
Wait for me, I'm so fucking far!

481
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,550
Wait, where are you?

482
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,090
Oh my god, you're so ahead.

483
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,690
Hey, Spidey.

484
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,610
You doing alright down there?

485
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,630
Mommy, please.

486
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,610
I'm so behind.

487
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,450
Do me, please.

488
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,670
I was a little slow.

489
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,630
Just for today.

490
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,310
I'll wait for you right here.

491
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,310
Oh, just because you have to.

492
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,530
You're forced to.

493
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,430
Hi, first.

494
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,730
Very strong spider.

495
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,130
How do I get off this?

496
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,130
Oh, I can do it while I'm on the spider.

497
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,510
Oops.

498
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,230
Fill that up.

499
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,110
Glup, glup, glup.

500
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,030
I wish that were me.

501
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,690
Fill that up.

502
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,170
Glup, glup.

503
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,550
What?

504
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,770
What?

505
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,230
Fill that up.

506
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,930
I wish Rose was here to see this.

507
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,470
I don't think Rose would want to.

508
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,830
Let's just give her more trauma, you know?

509
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,070
That's what a kid would want.

510
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,850
More trauma.

511
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,390
Yay!

512
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,770
Where the fuck is the end for this?

513
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,330
Is there an end?

514
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,930
I don't think so.

515
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,450
I think we were supposed to go up top.

516
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:04,930
Right?

517
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:05,910
Yeah.

518
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,370
Yeah.

519
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,070
Yeah, we were.

520
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:25,190
I'm surprised, like, do we even have any friends outside of
just us two?

521
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,530
You asked this last time too.

522
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,090
I don't know.

523
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:37,590
I'm just assuming, like, wouldn't somebody visit us and be
like, hey guys?

524
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:46,890
plants are you growing look i need somebody to give me
attention on the left hey i'm giving you context clues you

527
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,560
This is our brain on spiders.

528
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,600
Wait, where do we...

529
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,280
Oh, this way.

530
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,560
Yeah, I need you to do something.

531
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,660
You can wash this off.

532
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,700
Oh, my spider disintegrated!

533
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,220
What?

534
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,880
What kind of fucking gunk is this?

535
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
got fucking Thanos snapped.

536
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,700
It's pesticides.

537
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,400
Are these pesticides?

538
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,700
There's no way.

539
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,980
Why would I just spray it on a fucking tree?

540
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,460
Like, of all things.

541
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,480
Oh, the gamer...

542
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,200
What the fuck is the gamer gung?

543
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,080
Oh, you're stuck?

544
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,340
Oh, you're stuck?

545
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,840
How do I save you?

546
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,100
How the fuck...

547
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,680
Oh, here.

548
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,460
Okay.

549
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,760
Please!

550
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,120
Okay, I've got it.

551
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,740
I think you have to jump.

552
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:21,860
Right?

553
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,380
I can't jump.

554
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,660
Wait, then what do you do?

555
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,680
You jump on this?

556
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,780
Can you jump on that?

557
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:29,900
Yeah.

558
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,140
And then you...

559
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,100
And then you head over this way.

560
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,580
It's that easy.

561
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,900
Thank you for the ride again, Spider.

562
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,560
Thank you, Spider.

563
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,340
I'm gonna to make sure we don't squish you when we're back
to normal-sized people.

564
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,260
This was me when I was, like, nine.

565
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,540
I used to be, like, I don't know why, but I woke up in the
middle of the night so thirsty for water.

566
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,580
You know how, like, most Asian households have those kettles
full of water?

567
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,760
Oh, yeah, yeah.

568
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,260
I, like, used four, three to four cups.

569
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,080
Oh, that's the mama!

570
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Oh, my God!

571
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,040
So they weren't boyfriend-girlfriend.

572
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,640
They were...

573
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,720
chat tell you that?

574
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,960
Yeah, but like, do you really believe 100% what chat tells
you?

575
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,640
If they played the game before, I would hope so.

576
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,380
I told you!

577
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,660
See?

578
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,400
They have no fucking husband!

579
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,080
The spider killed the husband!

580
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,700
Yeah.

581
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,380
I told you!

582
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,360
I didn't get the foreshadowing about what's about to happen.

583
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,700
Well, technically I'm like the house husband, so wouldn't it
be the other?

There you go.

593
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,540
It was that easy.

594
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Oh, man.

595
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,280
Oh, my God.

596
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,860
Who are these?

597
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,200
Why are they doing here?

598
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,460
I'm pretty sure, like, the book grew these, too.

599
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
The plants are way out.

600
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,140
Hold them up, Koji.

601
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,800
Got it.

602
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,710
Oh, God.

603
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,450
Bro.

604
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,390
You know what?

605
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:15,730
You're wrong.

606
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,150
right for asking a divorce.

607
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,250
You're...

608
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,730
Maybe like a divorce was a good idea.

609
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,510
I have to reload?

610
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,430
I'm a plant!

611
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,130
What am I reloading?

612
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,470
It's part of my body.

613
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,790
It's literally part of my body.

614
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,570
Oh my god, please.

615
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,130
Fucking spray faster.

616
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,310
Are we done?

617
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,870
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

618
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,310
What do you mean?

619
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,370
I couldn't go.

620
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,750
I had to watch the plant roll.

621
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,570
Look, my life is clear.

622
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,170
Me first.

623
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,610
What the fuck?

624
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,590
Where do you go from?

625
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,070
Oh, here.

626
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,630
Here.

627
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,350
We have to beat the shit up.

628
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,370
Yeah, beat that plant up.

629
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:11,850
God.

630
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,990
What?

631
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,130
Whoa!

632
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,360
Yeah, I was gonna say, is this my garden?

633
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:27,980
Yeah.

634
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
What am I doing in this garden?

635
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:41,160
Anyways, I used like three to four cups, and then I was just
so thirsty that I drank straight from the kettle.

636
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,120
Wait, wouldn't that be, like, extra hot?

637
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,840
Or, like, did you guys keep it?

638
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,020
No, no, no.

639
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,000
We have a lot, a cold one and a hot one.

640
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,740
waste.

641
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,160
You don't have to do Yeah.

642
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,940
Yeah, you don't have to do more dishwashing.

643
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,740
Is that better?

644
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,860
Yeah.

645
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,820
My grandma used to boil water in the morning and put it in a
cold pot.

646
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,640
Yeah, that's smart.

647
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,240
Yeah, why would that be gross if you're all sharing in the
family?

648
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Ew!

649
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Oh, that's a corpse!

650
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,000
No, it's a skin.

651
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,140
You know, like bug shed.

652
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,700
I think it's dead, Cody.

653
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,120
Oh, no, it's dead.

654
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,560
Okay.

655
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,540
It's a corpse.

656
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:35,720
so noisy no it's like shedding it's shedding its skin it's a
mold but yeah um i got pneumonia you got pneumonia who gave

water went down the wrong hole or something i don't think

659
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,980
that's how there's no way you can get pneumonia from just
drinking water.

660
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,500
I think I also just got pneumonia somehow.

661
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,020
There's no way.

662
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,760
Oh, this is like, okay, but what's the worst shit can happen
when we wake him up?

663
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,420
Watch this.

664
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,580
What the fuck is wrong with you?

665
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,840
What is wrong?

666
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,200
Did you watch it?

667
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,140
Yeah, but But did you watch it, though?

668
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,380
I need to know if you saw what I did.

669
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,960
Do you want me to show it to you again?

670
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,620
Yeah.

671
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,420
Oh, my God.

672
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,100
They are kind of cute.

673
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

674
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,560
Who did you wake up?

675
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,080
What did you fucking?

676
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,360
Why did you do that?

677
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,020
I didn't do nothing.

678
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,640
You know, you could have went up.

679
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,460
Why did you go down?

680
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,340
I didn't want to go to sit with you.

681
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:57,660
There's up!

682
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,580
I feel like we're invading that privacy.

683
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,460
Agreed.

684
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,140
Let's get out of here, ASAP.

685
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,380
Oh my god.

686
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
Down, isn't like, down harder?

687
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,980
I don't know, I'm already through.

688
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,980
Yeah, because of all the noise you were making, I had to
fucking wait until...

689
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,920
Okay, yeah, you didn't make any noise.

690
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah.

691
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,500
Oh, hey, look at all these...

692
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,680
Oh my god, these ants are so small.

693
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,440
Why do you have so much like motor oil over here?

694
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,220
I've seen like 50 jugs already.

695
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,300
Motor oil, where's the motor oil?

696
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,060
Oh my god, what am I doing well this?

697
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,860
No, that's a wood sealer.

698
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,840
No, to the left.

699
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,520
That's one bucket of motor oil.

700
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,120
One bucket of motor oil is not that many.

701
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,420
You don't see more.

702
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,620
It's okay, Gumi.

703
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,580
I know you don't know much about cars, but...

704
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
But that...

705
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,560
Am I fucking weed now?

706
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,840
Look at you.

707
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,080
You look so soft.

708
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,700
Oh, you go.

709
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,560
Are you going?

710
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,600
Where are you going?

711
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,500
Why are you not following me?

712
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,760
I am.

713
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,020
You're just going too fast.

714
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,780
I hear you.

715
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,240
You ready?

716
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,080
Come on.

717
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm going.

718
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,780
Oh my god.

719
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,660
I am going as slow as I possibly.

720
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,480
Why are you crouching?

721
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,280
Just fucking run.

722
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,800
That makes me crouch!

723
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,860
It's automatically making me crouch!

724
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,620
That sounds like a skill issue right there.

725
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,640
No one's forcing you to crouch.

726
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Keep moving and deal with it.

727
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,300
Yeah, deal with it.

728
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,060

Wait, that one, look at that one.

753
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,600
Oh my God, it's an albino.

754

That's another.

755
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,980
What the fuck?

756
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,240
Why would you move?

757
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,460
Why would you move?

758
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,180
It's albino.

759
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,380
Where is it gonna do breathe on you?

760
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,100
Why are you so paranoid?

761
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,060
Why are you so many?

762
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,920
Because they like to bang!

763
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,100
Oh, yeah, just feel...

764
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,380
Yeah, sorry for this one guy that just likes to fucking do
his shit.

765
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
They're rodents!

766
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Have you heard about that?

767
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,520
Have you ever... Do you know about this mouse?

768
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:52,000
That, like, there's a type of mouse species for the guy
whose whole purpose is to just, like, fuck until it dies

769
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,520
from a heart attack.

770
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,520
Wait, you never...

771
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,260
Okay, there's a... I saw this on National Geographic.

772
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,240
I...

773
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:07,920
But they're talking about this rat, this rat species that
was literally just banged until it gets a heart attack.

774
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,740
It dies.

775
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,640
It's educational.

776
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,280
No, that's not all mice.

777
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,160
Some mice have her strength and know when to stop.

778
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,860
There's this particular species.

779
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,820
There's a particular species that doesn't know how to stop
for the guys.

780
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,240
And they just do it until they...

781
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:42,560
get a heart attack i think i think we have to run oh it's
crash baton time it's educational i'm how did you die no i

here to let you do everything oh no no i actually have to

783
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,840

784
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,000
Ow.

785
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,080
See?

786
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,680
What?

787
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,380
Why do you keep jumping?

788
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,720
No!

789
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,400
It forces you to play!

790
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,680
I'm not even pressing anything and it forces you to play!

791
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,660
That's so fucked up.

792
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,560
I can't believe it.

793
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,800
It's not a choice.

794
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,600
It's okay.

795
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,440
Why is your way faster?

796
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,180
It's not fair.

797
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,500
Oh!

798
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,920
Don't worry.

799
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,720
We're gaming.

800
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,340
I'm ahead.

801
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,060
What have we ever done to these moles?

802
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,200
Why are these...

803
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,780
Why do they want us to kill us off?

804
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,360
I literally provide them food.

805
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,380
I literally provide them free food with my garden.

806
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,160
It's Roddy!

807
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,200
Did you see him?

808
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,480
No, no, no, that's not my fault.

809
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,180
It's the book's fault.

810
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,060
That's not my fault.

811
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,080
The book caused this.

812
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,780
Oh, man.

813
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,040

There's no way.

You have to do this.

885

887
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,840

Okay.

901
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,080
I timed it perfectly to your rhythm.

902
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,100
And then suddenly your rhythm stopped.

903
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,300
How is I supposed to know the rhythm will just disappear?

904
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,020
Huh?

905
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,240
I was like, like right now.

906
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,460
Like right now.

907
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,780
I'm shooting it.

908
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,640
Wait, what?

909
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,480
What was I supposed to jump that one?

910
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,120
Okay, here you go.

911
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:23,720
All right.

912
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,460
See, look at this rhythm that you have established and then
suddenly it's just gone.

913
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:44,720
Yeah, and then I'm just making sure and then look look I
have to wait an extra like five seconds You can get off now.

914
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,400
That's it?

915
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,720
Okay.

916
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,180
I got you.

917
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,580
How did you get up here?

918
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,980
Nice job.

919
00:48:59,340 --> 00:48:59,700

920
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,100
Alright, here you go.

921
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,860
Go beat that shit up.

922
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,120
Like, Peter here.

923
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,840
Oh, maybe they are French-Canadian.

924
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,740
We actually need to use the bathroom.

925
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,820
I'll be right back real quick.

926
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,500
Oh, my God.

927
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,300
Don't say anything weird to my chat.

928
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,820
I'm going to say anything weird.

929
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,900
Anyways, um, chat.

930
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
The garden's looking vibrant.

931
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,360
I can tell you guys a story.

932
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,640
We've still got some infection left, though.

933
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,680
Oh, dude.

934
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,040
I love this story.

935
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,760
But I was playing Truth or Dare with another kid back in
elementary school.

936
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,240
Actually, it was a group of four.

937
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,660
I'm not going to say their names.

938
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,900
But there was a kid.

939
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,480
Who, um, they...

940
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,260
I don't know why they decided to tell us this, but we were
like, Okay, truth, what is the, like, grossest thing you've

941
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:57,600
done?

942
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,980
And then, they were like, oh, I would pee.

943
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,280
So, like, I would...

944
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,540
We had mice in our house, and they were like...

945
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,440
They would, like, pee on their floor.

946
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:24,700
leap crackers on their floor because you're like oh the mice
are thirsty and they're probably hungry

947
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:46,270
and then we were like dude that is not normal that's not
normal and they're like oh yeah my my dad yelled at me for

948
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:58,010

949
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,510
ever again.

950
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,070
That's a story that I love telling.

951
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,170
It's like pee-pee for the mice.

952
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:15,930
Wow.

953
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,030
The flowers are growing again.

954
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:19,390
Hmm.

955
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,270
My rat's thirsty.

956
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,610
Let me pee on carpet.

957
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,990
Your garden is beautiful, Cody.

958
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,250
Right, Dokey?

959
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,690
Why aren't you talking?

960
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,110
Did you say to my chat?

961
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,610
What?

962
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,590
Did you say something weird to my chat?

963
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,590
No, the plot twist is that funny.

964
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:43,570
Why are people in my chat being like, Doki, please never
leave us alone with Gumi again?

965
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,410
What did you say to them?

966
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,350
I didn't say anything.

967
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,810
I told them a story from my past.

968
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,630
Bro, okay.

969
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,270
Okay, that explains everything.

970
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:02,870
Some of the shit that happened to you when you were younger,
I understand why you're like this.

971
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,610
That wasn't me!

972
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,150
Oh my god, no, there was another...

973
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,430
So, do you know what, that same truth or dare?

974
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,310
Hold on, that same truth or dare?

975
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:12,990
Oh, there's a game, there's a game!

976
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:13,930
There's a snail race!

977
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:14,990
Get over here.

978
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:15,450
There's a truth or dare?

979
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:17,470
Um...

980
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,870
We're playing truth or dare and then...

981
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:23,290
You know how like kids back then were like, I see London, I
see France, I can see your underpants?

982
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:24,230
Yes.

983
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,010
Um...

984
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:29,830
Basically...

985
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,370
We were like, we dare you to show your underpants.

986
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,230
And then the kids...

987
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:33,430
What?

988
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:34,770
Yeah!

989
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,110
What does that even mean?

990
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:41,810
What do you mean?

991
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,950
Like, as a what?

992
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,270
Get away from me.

993
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:47,670
No.

994
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,030
Wait, which one's me?

995
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,390
Oh, that's me.

996
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,650
Okay, I lost track of who I am.

997
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:55,110
I don't know.

998
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,210
I think you're like, show your underpants.

999
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:57,850
What?

1000
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,250
And then this kid not only...

1001
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,010
How old were you guys?

1002
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:02,790
We're like eight!

1003
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:05,710
And you thought that was over.

1004
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,410
Okay?

1005
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:07,670
No!

1006
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,490
We thought it was embarrassing.

1007
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,230
We're like, show you how to pants.

1008
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,930
Like, pants yourself.

1009
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:28,990
And then, no, this kid decided to like take off his pants
and his underpants and be on the, like, playground floor in

1010
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:29,670
front of us.

1011
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,070
And then we got him.

1012
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,150
The Dean, like, a teacher saw it.

1013
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,970
And then the Dean got mad.

1014
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,090
Of course people, what do you- No, of course!

1015
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:39,510
I know!

1016
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,990
We didn't ask him to fucking pee on the floor!

1017
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,510
He just did it!

1018
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,710
And then the teacher got mad.

1019
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,850
Like, I mean, anybody would be mad!

1020
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,170
Like, they'd be like, Oh my god!

1021
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,550
What is going on?

1022
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,030
Anyways!

1023
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:58,490
And- I'll never forgive this bitch.

1024
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,190
The other kid who was playing with this, she said it was my
fault.

1025
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,590
But I didn't dare him to do that.

1026
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,590
Oh

1027
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:23,070

00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,060
Oh, God.

1081
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,740
I'm getting shot at.

1082
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,440
I'm getting shot at.

1083
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,220
I am one HP.

1084
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,180
I'm holding.

1085
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,000
He's literally one hit.

1086
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,300
He's literally one hit.

1087
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,020
It's okay.

1088
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,780
I need to get rid of the flyers first.

1089
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,720
Okay, don't worry, I got you.

1090
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,580
Anyways, maybe that's why I'm not normal.

1091
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,820
And that's how you do it.

1092
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,040
Wait, how do we hold...

1093
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,800
Oh, okay, there you go.

1094
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,200
Can I help out with this?

1095
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,700
It looks like you are.

1096
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,220
I'm the cool ant.

1097
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,100
Dude, I feel like I told you so much...

1098
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,080
Well, not you, but I feel like I told you chat so much about
my childhood and past, like, you takes two streams.

1099
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,800
Like, me talking to Clay when I was younger.

1100
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,200
Anyways.

1101
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,980
Oh yeah, the clay story.

1102
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,800
Yeah, the clay story.

1103
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,200
Yeah, when I was locked up- You made like clay- Yeah, now we
sort of know why you're like this.

1104
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:24,000
No, my family was so tough on me when I was younger for like
when they were grounding me.

1105
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,480
There was one time they made me copy the entire To Kill a
Mockingbird book by him.

1106
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:27,900
What?

1107
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:28,660
In one week.

1108
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,060
And I couldn't do it.

1109
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,740
What did you do?

1110
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,060
But like, why?

1111
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,280
I got a C.

1112
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,880
Oh, you got a C from- for your book report?

1113
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:37,880
No.

1114
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,720
They just decided to do that as a punishment Like, but why
did it kill?

1115
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,520
It was this like first book they found?

1116
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:46,840
Yeah.

1117
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:48,640
Yeah.

1118
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,660
So how did you...

1119
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,580
So how was the book?

1120
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:52,920
I didn't...

1121
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,980
Well, I read the book.

1122
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,760
I read it.

1123
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,080
The thing is...

1124
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,320
So like, how was the book, though?

1125
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,080
I didn't finish the assignment.

1126
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,300
Wait, did I even finish it?

1127
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:02,980
You guys...

1128
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,660
And because I didn't finish it, I had to get locked in my
room for a whole week.

1129
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,400
Also, we were supposed to go to the other side and water
this area.

1130
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,040
Oh, my God.

1131
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,280
So how did you...

1132
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,280
So no one...

1133
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,880
So that's why you don't like reading.

1134
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,620
No, I love reading.

1135
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,080
Wait, then why don't you finish to kill a mockingbird?

1136
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,040
I did.

1137
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,700
I finished it, like, four times.

1138
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,040
You just said you didn't.

1139
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,360
I didn't finish writing it by hand, man.

1140
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,700
Oh, then when I asked you, how was the book?

1141
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,440
You were like, oh, I didn't finish it.

1142
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,660
Oh, and I asked me how was, like, finished writing it?

1143
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,400
I said, how was the book?

1144
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,920
Do you like it?

1145
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,280
That's pretty good.

1146
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:42,780
I liked it.

1147
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:47,640
Okay, but did you like it because of the punishment that you
got Stockholm syndrome for it?

1148
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,820
Or did you actually like it?

1149
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,380
Maybe.

1150
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,260
It could have been Stockholm.

1151
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,160
Yeah, I was going to say, it could have been Stockholm
syndrome because of...

1152
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,780
Because you wrote so much of it, you just had to like it at
that point.

1153
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,480
How the fuck do we fix this...

1154
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,400
Fix this plan?

1155
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,980
How do we fix this?

1156
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:07,880
What?

1157
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,820
She had to read it to be able to argue her way out the
gulag.

1158
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,340
No.

1159
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,620
I got the gulag.

1160
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,620
Holy shit.

1161
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,500
How the fuck do we?

1162
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,100
I had to plant more.

1163
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,580
But I planted so much.

1164
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,020
Oh, you want the blue.

1165
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,340
It was like this tiny patch!

1166
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,020
That's so stupid.

1167
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,140

thing so i would like pretend i'd be fishing and stuff um i

1172
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:28,220

a little dumbass was like oh my god i caught a big fish and

1174
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:45,360

I could have been dead.

1178
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,900
I could have actually died.

1179
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,640

childhood furniture and stuff was being stored somewhere.

We're not alone.

01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,170
Oh, that's cool, actually.

1462
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:39,430
Okay.

1463
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,030
How do we do this?

1464
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:43,990
Oh!

1465
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,430
Yeah, it is like one hand clapping.

1466
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,170
Ow!

1467
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:47,870
What?

1468
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:49,330
Does it get too hot?

1469
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,710
Oh!

1470
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:54,010
You have to keep singing, because it gets hotter.

1471
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:58,110
When it's, like, up, it cools down.

1472
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:02,230
Yeah, see?

1473
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,510
You have to keep singing!

1474
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,090
You have to keep singing!

1475
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:04,770
You have to keep singing!

1476
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:06,550
Do I have to make you get all the way over there?

1477
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:07,170
I think so.

1478
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:08,410
Right?

1479
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,060
Yeah, you have to keep singing for now.

1480
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,300
Oh, I think it...

1481
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:17,800
What?

1482
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,920
Is there a pathway?

1483
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,920
I feel like it...

1484
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,940
keep singing until...

1485
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,520
Because there's a there's a thingy on my thingy, too.

1486
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,520
There's a thing?

1487
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,100
Oh!

1488
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,440
Wait, what?

1489
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,320
Wait, I can jump and sing at the same time.

1490
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,860
Oh, okay.

1491
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,560
You know what?

1492
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,080
I thought it was one of those that I had to stand still for.

1493
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,180
Yeah, yeah, but you can actually move when you're singing.

1494
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,100
I... How did I miss?

1495
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,140
It's okay.

1496
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:51,860

1497
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,620
Oh, hey, hey, you have to come back.

01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,360
Oh my god.

Ooh, look at that funky beat.

1539
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,060
I wish my grandpa could see us now.

1540
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,520
He'd love it.

1541
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:41,880
Or hate it.

1542
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,360
Okay, we have to go this way.

1543
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,120
I love my grandpa.

1544
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,640
The love of his life.

1545
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,800
I'm pretty sure if we sell this, we can get a lot of money.

1546
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,820
What the fuck?

1547
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:05,060
I'm just saying, if somehow, you know, somehow I go broke, I
have to thank Grandpa for this.

1548
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,360

Keep shouting.

1562
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,060
Keep destroying my hopes and dreams because it doesn't
matter anymore.

1563
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:41,120
These are my hopes and dreams.

1564
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,800
This is my grandpa's jukebox.

1565
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,020
What do you mean?

1566
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,360
Oh, now you left me.

01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,300

1618
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,460
I'm not on it!

1619
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,820

01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,360

1629
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,820

Purple.

1631
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:21,860
Uh, green.

01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:25,100
Green.

1634
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,540
Uh, purple.

1635
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:31,660

1636
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,040
We did it!

1637
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,400
Look at this teamwork!

1638
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,120
Oh god.

1639
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:38,860
We got it.

1640
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,900
You mean, oh god.

1641
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,000
I was the one that had to dodge the fucking fuse.

1642
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,680
And bam!

1643
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:47,480

Now you're...

1647
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:52,000
Don't wonder my hopes and dreams are over.

1648
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,380
That's fucking right.

1649
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,980
When you get married, you can never have any more hopes and
dreams.

1650
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,700
Our child is our hopes and dreams now.

1651
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,880
That's why we live like usually through the child.

1652
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:07,520
Oh my god!

1653
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,320
Time to tell another story.

1654
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,940
Yeah, time to give the child unrealistic expectations.

1655
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:22,420
expectations now because my hopes and dreams are dead

1656
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,860

I can picture it now.

1661
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,010
A young man.

1662
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:06,050
Rebellious.

1663
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:06,930
Whoa!

01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,150

Up we go.

1666
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:11,570
Uh-oh.

1667
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:15,250
This is not a hobby at that point.

1668
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:17,990
You've- how much money have you invested in this?

1669
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:21,530
Is this where- What'd you like to know?

1670
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:25,590
There's way too many things here for a hobby.

1671
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:33,800
Oh, how do we do this?

1672
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:34,920

I know how to turn out.

1674
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,000
Yeah, trust me.

1675
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,780

I'm coming down.

1679
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,760
Are you ready for the drop?

1680
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:05,820
Have you seen that TikTok video of like 19, like the 1920s,
uh, dance club remix?

1681
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,600

1682
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,660

01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:33,100
Oh!

1692
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:34,640
Okay, okay, okay.

1693
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,800
And then you jump right here.

1694
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:36,400
Right there.

1695
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,860

01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,920
Oh, I went the wrong way, but it's okay.

1699
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:42,820
I went the right way now.

1700
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:43,520
The right way.

1701
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:44,960
Okay.

What the hell is happening?

01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,180
That shit is trippy.

1705
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:52,540
I like that mechanic.

1706
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,920
You've seen osmosis jumps?

1707
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,600
All right.

1708
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:02,200
I need you to...

1709
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,860
No, I'm not high enough.

1710
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,120
I'm good, I'm good.

1711
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,250
All right, turn on.

1712
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:13,430

Can you sing?

1716
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:21,890
I don't know.

1717
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:22,830
Nope, there.

1718
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:23,790
Goodbye, your hopes and dreams.

1719
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,070
Me lied.

1720
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:26,870
No more singing for you.

1892
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,620
This light can only go left.

1893
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,440
The red one can only go right.

1894
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:51,520

Turn on.

1907
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:17,900
No.

1908
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:24,260
Dude, I think there's actual decent because I was on you the
entire time and you still kept getting hurt.

1909
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,540
Yeah, yeah, because you were not on me on my screen.

1910
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:30,480
On my screen, I was directly on you.

1911
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,180
Yeah, but I'm host.

1912
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,540
I guess that's what happened with the grass too.

1913
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,340
Oh, that's true.

1914
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,400
Yeah, that should make sense.

1915
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:42,900
What the hell?

1916
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:44,920
Oh, my God.

1917
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46,520
Oh, you're gonna sing!

1918
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,760
You know how my piece of music is like metal?

01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:52,900

1921
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,480
Um, dude, I fucking love being at the barricades, but I also
hate it at the same time.

1922
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,080
Won't you get like pushed against it?

1923
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:01,720

in early to get towards the barricades, or else I'm not

01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,200
The horsey!

1952
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:27,880
Ney!

1953
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:30,200
Ney!

1954
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,800
You want my horsey, then your horsey be friends?

1955
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,160
Yeah.

1956
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,240
No.

1957
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,760
That's not so friendly, of course.

1958
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:49,040
What if I don't want your horsey to be friends with my
horsey?

1959
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,540
Well, can I get in this one?

1960
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,430
Here she goes!

1961
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:07,910
I want to move this horse.

1962
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:10,050
This way.

1963
01:45:10,230 --> 01:45:13,830
I want to move my horse seat this way.

1964
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:16,230
Oh my god they can kiss you.

1965
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:16,930
They're so close?

1966
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:17,690
What the fuck?

1967
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:19,490
You don't even move your horse.

1968
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:20,550
You don't even move your horse.

1969
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:23,210
I'm like, what if they don't move like that?

1970
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:23,470
You lied to me.

1971
01:45:23,470 --> 01:45:23,890
You lied to me?

1972
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:25,110
You lied to me?

1973
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:28,730
I'm gonna let the king attack you.

1974
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:30,550
The hell?

1975
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:33,370
The king is coming head over.

1976
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:42,170
But what if the king just walks up to you and just...

1977
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:44,510
Wouldn't it be funny if I just lose my queen right here?

1978
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:49,810
That would be so fucking hilarious.

1979
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:53,470
If I just lose my queen right there.

1980
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:56,050
That would be so funny.

1981
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:58,010
I'd be like, hee hee ha ha.

1982
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:01,430
I want my horse to go here.

1983
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:04,550
Yeah, and I want my...

1984
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:11,170
I want my king to stay right here and just look at you.

1985
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:12,870
Okay.

1986
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:13,850
Okay.

1987
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:15,490
Just look at you like that.

1988
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:16,710
Okay.

1989
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,310
You know, just look at you.

1990
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,470
Okay.

1991
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:22,990
This one, give you a little look.

1992
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:24,350
A little look.

1993
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,030
You see?

1994
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:27,730
I know I'm just gonna stare at you.

1995
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:28,850
Okay.

1996
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:37,210
He's just looking at you like that And I was like, hello

1997
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:41,450
Is that cute?

1998
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:42,490
Is that funny?

1999
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,710
I heard you the first time

2000
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:49,650
Wouldn't that be so funny?

2001
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,970
Why aren't you in the chess club or something?

2002
01:46:53,310 --> 01:47:00,530
Yeah, but I don't care anymore I don't think when I play
chess anymore Because I don't play chess anymore I've never

2003
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:00,890
played...

2004
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:02,690
I learned how to play chess from the computer.

2005
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:05,370
I don't play chess anymore, so I don't really care.

2006
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:06,210
You know what?

2007
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:07,270
I'm just gonna eat your horse.

2008
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:10,390
You can eat my pawn, but, like, I got your horse.

2009
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:15,090
I left my horse there, because you said our horses were
friend.

2010
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:17,550
Well, is this a horse?

2011
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,170
Is this a horse?

2012
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:21,970
What the hell?

2013
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,390
I mean, you're just gonna eat a pawn, so who cares?

2014
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:25,890
I'm coming for your king soon!

2015
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:26,790
Whoa!

2016
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:27,830
Whoa!

2017
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,150
Whoa!

2018
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:31,230
That's fucked up!

2019
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:32,870
What would you do that?

2020
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:34,510
It's just a little funny horse.

2021
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,510
I won't tell you.

2022
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:37,890
Where is my king?

2023
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:41,750
Literally looking at it.

2024
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:43,110
Where's my king?

2025
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:47,130
I'm literally looking at it.

2026
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,810
Where is my king?

2027
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:50,570
You were like, I'm gonna put my king here.

2028
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:52,890
I'm gonna put my king here so it looks at you.

2029
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:55,030
Because I want my king to look at you.

2030
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:56,630
Where is it?

2031
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:00,410
That's all you come saying.

2032
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:01,890
I want my king to look at you.

2033
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:04,270
Yeah, because I want to look at you.

2034
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:08,550
I want to be like, see look, I exchanged my horse for your
horse because I was being nice.

2035
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:13,970
I was like, yeah, I gave you my horse because I wanted to be
nice.

2036
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:16,130
You mean it too?

2037
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:16,790
Yeah.

2038
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,430
What are you doing?

2039
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:18,930
Don't ya.

2040
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:19,690
I mean, what the fuck?

2041
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:20,970
Why did you move your castle there?

2042
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:21,910
That's fucked up.

2043
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:23,990
Why did you do that?

2044
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:27,250
Why should you move your castle over there?

2045
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:27,890
That's mean.

2046
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:29,190
Because I want to.

2047
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:29,870
Why?

2048
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:31,090
Why would you want that?

2049
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:32,750
Because I want to...

2050
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:33,190
Why?

2051
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:36,710
Why would you want that, though?

2052
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:38,530
Because I want to.

2053
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:39,050
Why?

2054
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,750
Um...

2055
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,030
I forgot how to tie me.

2056
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:43,250
I forgot.

2057
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:47,150
Yeah, no, I was like, why the fuck is she just talking about
her?

2058
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:50,070
Can't go into sand and like, why are you saying?

2059
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:52,370
I forgot I had a tie me.

2060
01:48:52,430 --> 01:48:53,770
I was just fucking around.

2061
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:57,630
This is supposed to be a quick game that I'm messing about.

2062
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:01,590
Oh, there's your queen over there.

2063
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,870

01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:04,770
There she is.

01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:09,970

Whoops.

01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:37,850

01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:38,230
Just keep thinking.

2132
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:40,210
I wanted to.

2133
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:43,030
I'll go here then.

2134
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:46,290
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2135
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:48,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2136
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:50,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2137
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:52,410
Hello.

2138
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:56,430

2139
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,010
Why are you sending your horse home?

2140
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:59,370
Your horse just wants to have fun.

01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,010

That's fine.

Bye God.

2149
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,360
What?

2150
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,060
Just because you have more time?

2151
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:42,620
We thought it was like more pieces.

2152
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:46,160
But I ate more pieces didn't I?

2153
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,080
Yeah, I have more pieces.

2154
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:49,660
I thought...

2155
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:54,360
Wait, it's... Oh, it's like whoever runs out of time.

2156
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,460
Oh, you need to lose.

2157
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,000
Oh my God, it's Heaven's gate.

2158
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:00,620
Oh shit.

2159
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,640
Your thing is off.

2160
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:02,760
Not that good.

2161
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,140
What the fuck?

2162
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:11,360
Oh, it's time we checked me.

2163
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,200
More instruments.

2164
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:20,540
Yeah, you just got beat by a person who learned how to play
from a computer.

2165
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,660
From running out of time.

2166
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:25,560
That is...

2167
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,140
Wait, we're out of heaven?

2168
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,080
Bro, that was fast.

2169
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,620
We're not in heaven.

01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:23,750
Oh, it's actually the same tune.

2174
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:25,510
Mary Had a...

2175
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:26,150
Isn't it?

2176
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:26,510
Twinkle.

2177
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:27,710
No, there's like...

2178
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:29,150
Row, row, row your boat.

2179
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:30,650
Gently down the stream.

2180
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,010
Twinkle.

2181
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:32,190
There's like...

2182
01:54:32,190 --> 01:54:35,090
There's like tunes that are like basically the same tune.

2183
01:54:35,610 --> 01:54:36,870
And then it's like...

2184
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:39,090
What are you doing?

2185
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:40,810
I'm waiting for you.

2186
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:48,590
How do I get there?

2187
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:50,170
Go down.

2188
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:51,310
Go down?

2189
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:52,290
Oh!

2190
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:53,790
Oh, you're downstairs!

2191
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:55,990
I thought you were above me.

2192
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:58,650
No.

2193
01:54:59,050 --> 01:54:59,950
There's something here.

2194
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:00,950
No.

2195
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:03,150
But I'm over here.

2196
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:05,590
And now I'm over here.

2197
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:08,290
Now I'm back.

2198
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:11,110
Alright, I'm ready.

2199
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,990
Yippee!

2200
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:19,330
We're so smart together.

2201
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:21,270
What did that do?

2202
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:21,870
I don't know.

2203
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:24,810
Oh, oh, I see.

2204
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:25,810
I sent you the vines.

2205
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:30,450
Oh, buh buh, black sheep.

2206
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:32,010
Have you any wool?

2207
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:33,270
Yes, sir.

2208
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:34,390
Yes, sir.

2209
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:36,730
Three bags full.

2210
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:37,930
What the fuck?

2211
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:38,870
Whoa, what's this?

2212
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,970
You have an accordion?

2213
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:42,270
Oh, it kills you.

2214
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:44,510
Oh, what's that machine?

2215
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:46,450
It looks like some kind of accordion.

2216
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:47,690
How do we fucking...

2217
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:49,530
Do you think he's against it?

2218
01:55:49,730 --> 01:55:51,090
Oh, I can shield!

2219
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:53,510
Guys, remember when I have a shield?

2220
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:54,150
I got it.

2221
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:54,810
I got it.

2222
01:55:55,810 --> 01:55:56,290
Malady?

2223
01:55:58,350 --> 01:55:58,730
Malady?

2224
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,830
You have to stand behind my shield, I'm worth something now.

2225
01:56:04,810 --> 01:56:06,070
Oh my god!

2226
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:06,930
That's sick!

2227
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:07,690
I'm black!

2228
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:09,410
Right side.

2229
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:10,710
Right side.

2230
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:12,010
To the right, to the right.

2231
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:13,030
Here we go, we're good.

2232
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:16,190
We just run past it.

2233
01:56:17,210 --> 01:56:19,450
Trivary is not dead, exactly.

2234
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:22,930
But some- I don't even need her to say thank you.

2235
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:26,950
I mean, it would be nice, you know?

2236
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:28,610
Oh, you say so?

2237
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:31,130
Oh, yeah, to the left side.

2238
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:35,630
Left!

2239
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:37,530
Right!

2240
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:39,630
Right!

2241
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:42,270
Okay, I got it.

2242
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:47,170
It should stay open now.

2243
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:48,230
Yeah.

2244
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,310
Here I go.

2245
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:52,990
Wee!

2246
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:55,670
Oh, I have to wait for you.

2247
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:58,170
Wee!

2248
01:56:58,290 --> 01:56:58,870
No, I don't.

2249
01:56:59,030 --> 01:57:00,030
I can just be here.

2250
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:02,210
Oh, I need to go on the other side.

2251
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:03,350
Me!

2252
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,830
You need to, like, jump off my head.

2253
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:09,750
It's a fun little song.

2254
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,600
I don't need the little notes come off the paper.

2255
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,400
Oh, yeah, that's so cute.

2256
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,100
I like that.

2257
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:19,920
Yay!

2258
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,980
Where the fuck are we?

2259
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:25,120
Are we in a cello or something?

2260
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,020
How much music do you play?

2261
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:31,140
How do we have all these instruments?

2262
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:35,340
We'll be back in music heaven?

2263
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:38,380
Dude, why the fuck are we in heaven?

2264
01:57:39,820 --> 01:57:41,160
Because we're good people.

2265
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,320
Well, obviously, I think I'm a good person.

2266
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:44,460
I gave you my pass.

2267
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,760
I gave you my plus one.

2268
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:49,660
Okay, sure.

2269
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,560
Lying is a sin, you know.

2270
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:56,180
Yeah, that's why I gave you my pass.

2271
01:57:56,420 --> 01:57:57,820
And why you're not in heaven.

2272
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:04,740
They must have gone home for the day.

2273
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:06,440
Let's just cancel the whole thing.

2274
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:07,540
No, no, no, me.

2275
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,120
You have to bring the orchestra to your concert.

2276
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:11,120
What?

2277
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,220
What kind of concert is this?

2278
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:14,420
I thought this was a pop concert.

2279
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:15,900
They've been kidnapped?

2280
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,340
Kidnapped by the devil.

2281
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:19,120
They're the devil?

2282
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:21,120
Um, in heaven?

2283
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,080
Oh, yeah.

2284
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:23,020
Makes total sense.

2285
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,140
Right, huh?

2286
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:24,620
Huh?

2287
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:25,260
Exactly.

2288
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:28,440
But now you have to go and save the orchestra.

2289
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:29,620
Go.

2290
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:30,260
How?

2291
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,180
Aren't we technically walking on?

2292
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,060
Oh, okay.

2293
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,300
I thought we were already on clouds.

2294
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:38,780
Jump.

2295
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,080
Alright.

2296
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:44,360
Time to kill the devils.

2297
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:46,020
Wait, but where do we go?

2298
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:48,860
Go here?

2299
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:50,800
Oh my god, there's flying pigs.

2300
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:53,080
Oh my god, when pigs fly!

2301
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,580
But where are the music notes for?

2302
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,660
Oh, we have to get all the music notes.

2303
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:03,040
I get the cutscene and you don't want.

2304
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,840
I got the cutscene before you.

2305
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:07,540
Wait, then why do I have to watch it again?

2306
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,580
Alright, just a few more bubbles to pop.

2307
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:12,480
Once you pop, you can't stop.

2308
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:14,600
We get all the ones here?

2309
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:15,640
No, we're missing one.

2310
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:18,500
Oh, it's up here.

2311
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:20,880
I got one of the doors up.

2312
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:23,840
Oh my god, I see the devils!

2313
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:25,200
Come on!

2314
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:26,760
Come on!

2315
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:29,360
Wait, can I kill the pigs?

2316
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:33,620
Oh, my god, stop!

2317
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:35,260
Wait, there's tennis!

2318
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:35,940
There's tennis!

2319
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:39,940
Oh, volleyball!

2320
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,580
I love volleyball.

2321
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,000
Okay, jump is nice.

2322
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:45,200
Why?

2323
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,040
I scared you?

2324
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:49,180
Oh, my god, look.

2325
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:50,180
It's a devil bat!

2326
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:52,520
Yeah, it's a devil and a pig.

2327
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:54,600
The angels are pigs?

2328
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,720
That's funny, the angels are pigs.

2329
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,260
Wait, this is not real volleyball.

2330
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,100
This is not regular volleyball.

2331
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:07,360
How dare they tarnish volleyball?

2332
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:10,580
I can't believe.

2333
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,620
Not my volleyball.

2334
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:15,720
Okay.

2335
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:17,480
Not my volleyball.

2336
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:21,340
Oh, God.

2337
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:22,780
Dude.

2338
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,220
I know, it gets confusing when there's two.

2339
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:31,540
Nice.

2340
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:31,980
Nice.

2341
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:33,380
Alright.

2342
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:35,020
Woo!

2343
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:35,620
Woo!

2344
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:36,680
Yeah!

2345
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:39,740
I wish we made it more clear that you were under it.

2346
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:46,980
It's like, it's so weird, like, because it's, like, hard to
see where the ball's gonna land too.

2347
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,720
I think that's, like, the more frustrating part.

2348
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:50,600
Yeah.

2349
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:54,000
It's...

2350
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:55,140
What?!

2351
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:56,380
I was clear!

2352
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:07,100
I hate this game!

2353
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:07,500
I hate this game.

2354
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,960
It ruined volleyball for me.

2355
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:15,000
Not my body.

2356
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,140
I told you!

2357
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,660
This sucks!

2358
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,120
What?

2359
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:21,280
You got two!

2360
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:23,840
You get the hit, both!

2361
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,740
Nice kill!

2362
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:29,820
Oh god.

2363
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:32,520
Bro, it's getting harder.

2364
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:34,020
It's going harder.

2365
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:35,040
It's getting...

2366
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:41,820
Okay.

2367
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:43,760
Oh,

2368
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:49,670
out of here.

2369
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:51,030
Oh, God.

2370
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:54,130
Bro!

2371
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:58,230
The devil is reaching the game!

2372
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:00,030
This is it.

2373
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:02,230
Dude, fuck these pigs.

2374
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:10,130
Down with all the angel pigs.

2375
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:14,730
Where are they?

2376
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:17,610
I'm coming over!

2377
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:20,470
I'm coming over!

2378
02:02:21,330 --> 02:02:23,470
No, I can't kill him!

2379
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:27,170
No,

2380
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:32,350
I can't get rid of them.

2381
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:34,010
I'll pet you.

2382
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:36,450
I guess I'll pet you.

2383
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:37,710
But they're not pigs.

2384
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:39,530
They're like little hamsters.

2385
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:41,210
Yeah, what the heck?

2386
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:41,670
Yeah.

2387
02:02:44,010 --> 02:02:47,370
Oh my god, his face is so cute.

2388
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:49,610
Look at his little paws.

2389
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:52,310
Yeah, he has little paw pads too.

2390
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:56,450
He's not gonna stop me from eliminating him.

2391
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:57,050
Stop!

2392
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:02,530
They ruined volleyball!

2393
02:03:03,870 --> 02:03:05,130
They didn't do shit!

2394
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,790
They ruined volleyball!

2395
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:08,510
We're like the devils!

2396
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:12,230
I'm waiting for you on the other side.

2397
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:16,730
Well, I'm clearing out the music net so we can just get out
of the way.

2398
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:19,530
We're going to head there eventually anyway.

I got one?

2439
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:52,520
Where's the last guy?

2440
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:53,060
I got two.

2441
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,460
Where's the last one?

2442
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:56,880
Was there three?

2443
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:00,500
I thought there was three.

2444
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:02,580
No, there was only two, because they had two keys.

2445
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:03,120
Oh!

2446
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,600
But where's the key then?

2447
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:06,920
I didn't want to get the cloud thing up.

2448
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:10,620
I didn't want to make sure the fog is still clear.

2449
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:16,220
Because I don't see any keys.

2450
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,620
Where the fuck?

2451
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:23,900
Don't worry, I got you.

2452
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:27,940
Oh my god, he looks so miserable.

2453
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:29,040
He looks so happy.

2454
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:29,800
Oh, there it is!

2455
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:31,160
I knew there was one more.

2456
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,560
Yeah, there's the other one.

2457
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,520
I got it.

2458
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:44,030
Wait, where's the other one?

2459
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:44,890
other key then.

2460
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:49,850
Wait, do you have...

2461
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:50,710
Is there someone in the floor somewhere?

2462
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:52,770
Yeah, you must have dropped it on the floor.

2463
02:06:56,410 --> 02:06:57,470
Because where is it?

2464
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:00,050
Where's the last key?

2465
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:04,690
I think it has to be, like, in the fog somewhere.

2466
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:05,890
Oh, wait!

2467
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:06,570

02:07:07,610 --> 02:07:08,530
Oh, there he is!

2469
02:07:10,790 --> 02:07:11,950
I didn't even see him.

2470
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:16,470
Do I have it?

2471
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:22,730

02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:14,560
I got the key one.

2491
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,280
I got the key.

2492
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,440
I've just been killing all of them.

2493
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:17,760
Yeah, me too.

2494
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,560
too, honestly.

2495
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:22,260
Okay, I'll grab this one, though.

2496
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:25,200
Whoa, wait, they can steal from you?

2497
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,440
Bro, that's fucked up.

2498
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:27,880
Don't worry, I got another one.

2499
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,160
That's fucked up as we're killing all of them.

2500
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:34,560
Yeah, we're killing all your friends and family, and you're
just gonna focus on the key.

2501
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:36,400
We're missing one more.

2502
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:37,840
Oh, wait, you already killed him.

2503
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:42,440
I like how we killed all of them instead of the actual
person with the key.

2504
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,320
Well, they were gonna steal it anyways.

2505
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:50,040
We did it!

2506
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:53,380
Oh.

2507
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,060
Why don't you say anything?

2508
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,880
We're supposed to be a team.

2509
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,960
It looked like you were having fun.

2510
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:08,100
Yay!

2511
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,100
Now we say chopping!

2512
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:12,880
Oh my god.

2513
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:14,340
Reminds me of a sound of music.

2514
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:17,760
Is that it?

2515
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:19,180
Now we need to get the maestro.

2516
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,720
You're the maestro.

2517
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,080
That's the whole thing.

2518
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:26,420
I wonder if I can die.

2519
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:29,160
Wait.

2520
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:30,700
I'm going to test Ethereal.

2521
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:34,180
I'm going to test Ethereal.

2522
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:37,680
You can die.

2523
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:38,560
Okay.

2524
02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:42,760
Look, it's all about experimentation.

2525
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:44,880
Leave it alone!

2526
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:51,240
Wait, what?

2527
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:52,520
What did I do?

2528
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:55,280
Dude, I'm so glad I saw one more on your screen, too.

2529
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:56,920
Pretty impressive, right?

2530
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:59,620
I just didn't want to tell you.

2531
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:01,240
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

2532
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:02,560
No, no, no, no.

2533
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:04,260
It will not be fine.

2534
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:06,000
He gets to go to double heaven.

2535
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,300
It will be fantastical.

2536
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:11,080
Whoa.

2537
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:13,480
Oh.

2538
02:11:16,890 --> 02:11:17,690
Rematch time.

2539
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:19,830
I see.

2540
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:20,910
the chessboard.

2541
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:23,990
What the fuck?

2542
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:26,150
Good job.

2543
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:27,610
We're almost ready.

2544
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:31,610
The only thing missing is the audience.

2545
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:32,810
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2546
02:11:33,150 --> 02:11:34,050
Not an audience.

2547
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:37,610
Do you want the last letter piece or not?

2548
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:38,790
Hey, that's blackmail.

2549
02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:39,570
No.

2550
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:40,810
That's manipulation.

2551
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:43,900
Now go and get it.

2552
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:48,500
Blackmail and our relationship is a healthy relationship.

2553
02:11:49,420 --> 02:11:51,660
I didn't get to reply earlier, but you We're right.

2554
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:55,400
Like, there are some marriages that are, like, that need to
be ended.

2555
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:58,580
Like, you can't fix all marriages.

2556
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:00,140
This is one of them.

2557
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:03,380
Edge.

02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:36,300
Yeah, anything can be a job if there's a demand.

2629
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:36,980

You're a lovely husband.

I need to press that.

2633
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:47,980
You don't know about me.

2634
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,960
You don't know about me.

2635
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:52,400
Are you fucking...

2636
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:52,720

2642
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:14,720
What is this?

2643
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:20,020
Where in the area that they like...

2644
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:21,820
Wait, make the...

2645
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,020
Oh.

2646
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,000
Like the disco buff.

2647
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:26,780
Yeah, we have to do this together.

2648
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:27,780
Boom.

2649
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:30,900
Oh.

2650
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:31,640
Oh my god.

2651
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:32,840
No, my symbol!

2652
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:34,660
No!

2653
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:36,100
You lost your symbol!

2654
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,180
Move it, Cody!

2655
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:38,480
Move it!

2656
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:40,780
Down, stance, Cody!

2657
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:42,600
Do I have to move anywhere?

2658
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:43,420
Oh, wait.

2659
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:44,700
Wait, I don't.

2660
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:45,800
No, I do!

2661
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:49,120
I thought you'd just stand there.

2662
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:52,200
I thought you learned from the first time, but you just
didn't.

2663
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:54,660
I couldn't tell.

2664
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:56,260
I couldn't tell.

2665
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:57,200
My perception.

2666
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:59,280
My death perception was off.

2667
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,060
Because he's moving still.

2668
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:04,700
So I assume he's moving for me.

2669
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:08,020
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

2670
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:10,160
Woo.

2671
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:11,940
Holy shit.

2672
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,560
How long is this road?

2673
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:15,960
I thought we just had to do...

2674
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:16,240
Oh.

2675
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:16,820
I just...

2676
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:18,140
Oh.

2677
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:19,440
Oh, shit.

2678
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:21,460
I thought we just had to do an orchestra.

2679
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:22,820
Why is she...

2680
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:26,580
Your hobby and passion, so long and complicated.

2681
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:29,300
Oh my god.

2682
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:30,900
Oh, it's okay.

2683
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:31,580
You're still alive.

2684
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:32,120
Oh, it's okay.

2685
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:32,980
I'll just wait.

2686
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,160
You can do this.

2687
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:37,000
I believe in you.

2688
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:45,400
When you don't press anything, it auto-presses for you.

2689
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:46,480
So you are forced to.

2690
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:49,400
I've heard that one time you kept dying on purpose.

2691
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:52,340
Not even on purpose.

2692
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:52,820
He's just...

2693
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:53,720
I kept dying!

2694
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:01,520
Whoa.

2695
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:04,120
Wait, this is that punk!

2696
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:06,680
Oh, look at our lime trails!

2697
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:08,880
There's colors behind us.

2698
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:12,000
What's that one movie?

2699
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:13,240
I'm glad I didn't have to do it alone.

2700
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:14,060
What, Tron?

2701
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:15,120
Yeah, Tron!

2702
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:15,860
I love Tron.

2703
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:16,840
They're making a sequel.

2704
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:18,620
I never watched it.

2705
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,060
Fun.

2706
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:21,060
Why not?

2707
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:21,720
A jellyfish!

2708
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:26,040
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is trippy.

2709
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:27,240
Wait, where's the jellyfish?

2710
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:28,240
I don't see it.

2711
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:29,020
No!

2712
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:32,940
I was looking at the fucking glow.

2713
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,280
Oh my god.

2714
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:43,370
That's me when I go to my concert.

2715
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:46,890
Oh.

2716
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:52,160
Hey, we didn't see anything.

2717
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:53,680
What do we do?

2718
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:54,520
Stop the music.

2719
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:56,000

Dance as Revolution.

2734
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,820
I used to have those dance pads as I did.

2735
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:42,020

2736

Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:31,500

2752
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,120
What the fuck is he doing?

2753
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:38,280
That's fucked up!

2754
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:47,300
You spinny ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.

2755
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:51,920
Oh, he plays

2756
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:56,980
music and stuff.

2757
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:03,540
Oh, I missed the fucking...

2758
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:03,820
Ow!

2759
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:06,700
How do you hit all of them?

2760
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:08,260
Okay.

2761
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:10,520
I'm hitting the music.

2762
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:13,380
I'm riding the music.

2763
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:17,680
Oh my god, how are you so fucking fast?

2764
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:20,900
I don't know.

2765
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:22,540
How are you doing that?

2766
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:23,740
Are you cheating?

2767
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:26,540
What do you mean am I cheating?

2768
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:33,600
There's no way it can't be because I keep hitting every
obstacle.

2769
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:34,620
There's no...

2770
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:39,220
There's no way.

2771
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:44,860
Oh my god, I'm being the jump.

2772
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:48,360
Can't wait to see what that looks like.

2773
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:49,820
Whoa.

2774
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,840
Absolutely incredible.

2775
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:59,340
I can't believe it made you skip ahead to the cutscene that
I'm at.

2776
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:01,760
No, I just made it.

2777
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:05,920
Whoa!

2778
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,320
I was right beside you this entire time.

2779
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:09,700
Aha!

2780
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:20,820
We're...

2781
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,420
Oh, that's so bright.

2782
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:25,020
Holy shit!

2783
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:26,060
That's so bright.

2784
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:36,600
Look at them!

2785
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:37,260
Yeah!

2786
02:23:38,060 --> 02:23:38,800
Look at that audience!

2787
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:39,680
They're excited!

2788
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:41,000
Yeah!

2789
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:44,800
They're just heading to the after party!

2790
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:48,980
Are we still missing something?

2791
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:51,800
No, we got everything we need.

2792
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:54,320
Showtime, baby.

2793
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:54,920
Woo!

2794
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:07,750
You hear that, May?

2795
02:24:08,330 --> 02:24:09,930
You hear the anticipation?

2796
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:13,310
I haven't performed in front of an audience for ages.

2797
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,390
May, it'll be fine.

2798
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:16,610
Just think of them all in their underwear.

2799
02:24:17,070 --> 02:24:18,690
Yes, that would make you relax.

2800
02:24:19,630 --> 02:24:19,850
Got it.

2801
02:24:20,170 --> 02:24:21,370
Let's go prep the stage.

2802
02:24:21,630 --> 02:24:22,110
Okay, Buck.

2803
02:24:22,870 --> 02:24:23,070
Hey, May.

2804
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:35,030

2807
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:13,060
What the fuck?

2808
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:14,740
I don't get to play the game now?

2809
02:25:18,260 --> 02:25:19,860
What about me?

2810
02:25:22,660 --> 02:25:23,620
What are you doing?

2811
02:25:27,890 --> 02:25:29,170
Flight of the Barnes.

2812
02:25:29,370 --> 02:25:32,110
Oh, it would be so funny if that was to kill the Mockingjay.

2813
02:25:34,310 --> 02:25:34,830
Mockingjay!

2814
02:25:35,890 --> 02:25:36,410
Mockingbird!

2815
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:41,210
Can you only walk?

2816
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:44,090
Yeah, I can only walk.

2817
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:46,130
It doesn't even let me crouch or anything.

2818
02:25:47,330 --> 02:25:48,210
Lily Fields.

2819
02:25:48,650 --> 02:25:51,010
Sing from the heart.

2820
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:52,430
Sing from the heart, Gumi.

2821
02:25:53,390 --> 02:25:54,030
That's so nice.

2822
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:55,370
I don't have to play the video game.

2823
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:58,430
I get to do a watch along.

2824
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:59,930
It's React content time.

2825
02:26:00,590 --> 02:26:02,750
Doki reacts to Gumi's gameplay.

2826
02:26:03,590 --> 02:26:03,930
Oh my god.

2827
02:26:03,950 --> 02:26:05,270
What is Gumi gonna do now?

2828
02:26:06,510 --> 02:26:07,810
What the fuck is that?

2829
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:08,910
What the fuck is that?

2830
02:26:08,910 --> 02:26:09,450
Is that me?

2831
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:10,290
Oh shit!

2832
02:26:10,830 --> 02:26:12,010
Gumi react time.

2833
02:26:12,470 --> 02:26:13,570
What do I have to say?

2834
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:14,910
This isn't my dream and hope.

2835
02:26:14,930 --> 02:26:15,270
Oops.

2836
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:17,730
This is...

2837
02:26:17,730 --> 02:26:19,230
Am I just walking too?

2838
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:20,490
Whoa.

2839
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:25,170
Look at all these people here for you.

2840
02:26:25,310 --> 02:26:27,870
There has to be at least 5,000 people there.

2841
02:26:28,830 --> 02:26:29,890
That does not look like 5,000.

2842
02:26:32,310 --> 02:26:34,090
That looks like maybe 130.

2843
02:26:34,890 --> 02:26:38,510
That looks at least like 10,000 people in the audience.

2844
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:40,090
No pressure.

2845
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:43,150
Oh shit!

2846
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:44,450
Joki reacts.

2847
02:26:44,930 --> 02:26:47,050
Alright, so Gumi is gonna walk straight in the line.

2848
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:48,550
I wonder what's gonna happen, Chad.

2849
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:50,090
I'm actually turning.

2850
02:26:50,850 --> 02:26:51,890
She's gonna start turning?

2851
02:26:52,530 --> 02:26:56,190
Oh, I think that, Chad, I think she's heading to the stage
that we just saw earlier.

2852
02:27:01,530 --> 02:27:02,330
Vehicle maintenance.

2853
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:04,770
Oh, those are my books!

2854
02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:05,850
That's my shit!

2855
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:11,290
Classic children's stories.

2856
02:27:11,430 --> 02:27:12,530
Oh, you're gonna start playing!

2857
02:27:12,850 --> 02:27:14,170
Are you even gonna sing?

2858
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:15,990
Or is it maestro time?

2859
02:27:16,970 --> 02:27:18,890
Oh my god, it's the concert getting ready.

2860
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:26,900
Oh my god!

2861
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:27,960
They're all here for...

2862
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:31,000
They don't have eyes, so they can't see if it's a bad
performance.

2863
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:32,000
Dude, they were kidnapped.

2864
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:34,380
They were literally kidnapped to be here.

2865
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:35,460
You can do this.

2866
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:36,680
I believe in you.

2867
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:38,180
They have to clap.

2868
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:40,000
If they don't clap, they stay here forever.

2869
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:43,200
They can't go home to their families.

2870
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,380
Oh yeah, the daughter.

2871
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:48,580
I almost forgot about her.

2872
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:49,180
She's like...

2873
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:51,360
What's going on?

2874
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:55,260
It's been like eight hours now.

2875
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:58,460
Dinner was supposed to be ready an hour ago.

2876
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:03,020
Mom, Dad, are you guys just...

2877
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:03,860
I'm not an attic.

2878
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:14,240
Mom, Dad, the music just started playing the attic above us.

2879
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:18,320
Are there people that like, you know...

2880
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:20,720
Do we have ghosts?

2881
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:21,880
Do we have ghosts?

2882
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:25,200
I thought...

2883
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:26,500
I thought it was just us three.

2884
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:27,740
Who's that?

2885
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:28,700
Mom, wake up!

2886
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:29,600
Mom, look!

2887
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:31,900
Look what I found, Mom!

2888
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:34,220
The sun is setting now!

2889
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,980
Shut up, I'm sleeping.

2890
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:58,920
Oh shit!

2891
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:02,180
Oh my god.

2892
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:04,660
This is so sad for the child.

2893
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:06,220
There's so many things.

2894
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:08,260
She has so many issues right now.

2895
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:13,040
Like both their parents are unresponsive.

2896
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,840
And like, I'm giving you my heart, mom.

2897
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,020
I love you.

2898
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,480
And then mom's just like, don't know, Wald.

2899
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:35,900
Sing anaconda.

2900
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:39,440
My anaconda, don't.

2901
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,260
My anaconda, don't.

2902
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:43,020
My anaconda, don't.

2903
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:44,240
What done?

2904
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:49,080
Okay, to be fair, like this audience is not there for
classic music.

2905
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:53,880
Like, this is a rave audience.

2906
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:57,080
We have the wrong fucking fans here.

2907
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:05,980
Bro, they're so fucking bored.

2908
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:16,680
Where are the words?

2909
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:18,300
Where are the beats?

2910
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:32,920
Where are flying?

2911
02:30:41,690 --> 02:30:42,950
Are we gonna kiss?

2912
02:30:43,090 --> 02:30:44,030
Oh my god.

2913
02:30:44,650 --> 02:30:45,570
With the power of music?

2914
02:30:45,990 --> 02:30:48,690
Are our kids running away from home right now?

2915
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:55,140
Marriage saved.

2916
02:30:56,180 --> 02:30:57,140
That was beautiful, Mae.

2917
02:30:57,780 --> 02:30:59,400
Thank you.

2918
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:02,840
I assume?

2919
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:04,940
What?

2920
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:05,580
Hold?

2921
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:07,120
We're actually gonna...

2922
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:07,320
No.

2923
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:08,300
Fly away.

2924
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:09,120
Fly away.

2925
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:13,720
No!

2926
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:14,380
Don't!

2927
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:15,200
Everything!

2928
02:31:22,060 --> 02:31:23,060
Let go!

2929
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:24,880
Oh, I can back away from you.

2930
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,880
I can...

2931
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:33,320
We stare deeply into each other's eyes.

2932
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:35,140
Clink, clink, clink, clink.

2933
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:39,180
Oh, but what if I don't?

2934
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:41,880
Oh, that's right.

2935
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:42,600
Getting the ick.

2936
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:43,940
I'm getting the ick right now.

2937
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:45,320
Unless I haven't finished the scene.

2938
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:46,120
I'm getting the ick.

2939
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:48,720
So, okay.

2940
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:54,860
slow and steady and I go straight in but what if I stop?

2941
02:31:55,180 --> 02:31:56,060
Oh, it won't let me.

2942
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:59,000
Please, I'm getting the egg!

2943
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:03,100
And then I go...

2944
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:03,540
Oh!

2945
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:12,040
I'm actually like...

2946
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:12,540
Oh!

2947
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:14,560
Oh!

2948
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:16,720
And then I stop.

2949
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:24,780
Just close your fucking eyes Come on, just the two of us.

2950
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:30,560
Just, I'm going to stare deep into your eyes.

2951
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:34,880
My controller's vibing like crazy people.

2952
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:38,880
Here, guys, here, this is the sound of the controller.

2953
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:46,460
Wow, oh my god, it's right there.

2954
02:32:47,020 --> 02:32:48,700
See, first year, he loves.

2955
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:50,280
He's like, get closer.

2956
02:32:50,820 --> 02:32:51,360
Get closer.

2957
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:52,380
Almost there.

2958
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:05,740
Almost there.

2959
02:33:14,140 --> 02:33:15,720
There you go.

2960
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:17,500
Wait, is that even a kiss yet?

2961
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:19,340
Cause I didn't close my eyes.

2962
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:31,820
I like saw two different X's in the time frame.

2963
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:38,340
Wait.

2964
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:41,320
It's the slow burn.

2965
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,060
Don't you like slow burn?

2966
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:44,240
Oh, God.

2967
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:47,600
That was like 130 chapters in.

2968
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:50,040
This is it.

2969
02:33:54,170 --> 02:33:55,370
Oh no.

2970
02:33:55,890 --> 02:33:58,870
No, this is Stockholm syndrome taking effect right now.

2971
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:04,890
Singing a song, this is just miraculously fucking fixing
marriage.

2972
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:06,870
There are underlying issues.

2973
02:34:12,970 --> 02:34:15,290
Ew, he's like nutting over it.

2974
02:34:16,450 --> 02:34:25,150
He's like, oh my god, this guy watched this, uh, five-minute
kiss that we had.

2975
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:34,100
There's like underlying issues that we have in this
marriage.

2976
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:37,000
A fucking singing wouldn't fix this.

2977
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:38,880
Oh my god, we're normal.

2978
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:41,160
We're normal people now.

2979
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:43,560
World's greatest dad.

2980
02:34:44,540 --> 02:34:45,000
As me.

2981
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:47,300

02:38:22,010 --> 02:38:22,950
It's fucking cursed.

3021
02:38:23,610 --> 02:38:24,330
It's a cursed book.

3022
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:26,670
How is our kid digging through the trash can in the first
place?

3023
02:38:28,570 --> 02:38:29,310
I bet it was you.

3024
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:30,910
I bet you taught her that.

3025
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:31,670
What the fuck?

3026
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:37,930
If your mom had to fight an aggressive squirrel double her
size, what do you think would win?

3027
02:38:38,310 --> 02:38:39,270
Mom, of course.

3028
02:38:39,470 --> 02:38:41,330
Do we literally fix our marriage?

3029
02:38:42,390 --> 02:38:45,490
I think it teaches kids that like, that's unrealistic.

3030
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:46,950
We did it!

3031
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:48,630
I used to think you were completely irrational.

3032
02:38:49,650 --> 02:38:52,530
But I have to say, you make more sense now.

3033
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:56,880
We did it!

3034
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:59,000
Oh my god, there's...

3035
02:38:59,000 --> 02:38:59,780
The sucker.

3036
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:03,960
Oh my god, and the hammered a weird toolbox.

3037
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:04,400
Yeah.

3038
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:11,280
Oh, there's whoever's fucking binoculars that is.

3039
02:39:11,300 --> 02:39:12,120
That was moved at the...

3040
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,540
Whoever we're looking...

3041
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:16,640
That's directed at the... our house.

3042
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:27,910
we did it we beat the game look he's she's fixed now see
we're not fucked up parents we fixed her

3043
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,260

3044
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:51,920
oh my god we fucking did it go we did it oh my god there's a
fat b yeah remember that's the one that ditched us yeah that

3045
02:39:51,920 --> 02:40:04,880
somehow never got shot why did she put it so high up that's
her god now thank you for fixing the marriage they're

3046
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:12,710
friends again yeah very good friends the book of love

3047
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:24,100
yeah i still can't believe like We got like rave slash what
the fuck did you pause for?

3048
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:26,480
Dude, this is so fucking loud.

3049
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:34,760
I just can't believe we got like the rave club people to be
your audience for a fucking classical music.

3050
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:37,360
That's like the most unrealistic part of this game.

3051
02:40:37,360 --> 02:40:40,760
They literally came from a club that was like, go be back in
the club.

3052
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:42,080
God, I'm going to get to you.

3053
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:43,820
Drop the beat.

3054
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:46,560
And now I'm going, ah.

3055
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:56,060
Like, I'm just like, I don't think they were here for this.

3056
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:58,060
They waited in line, dude.

3057
02:40:58,420 --> 02:41:01,400
Those people waited in line to get into that club.

3058
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:06,660
And then they fucking got dragged to your fucking classical
music concert.

3059
02:41:08,660 --> 02:41:09,260
Like...

3060
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:11,980
Dude, that person's name is Uno Bight.

3061
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:13,980
Uno Bight?

3062
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:16,700
What did I just read?

3063
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:17,260
What?

3064
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:19,400
Uno Bight.

3065
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:20,920
Is there an after-credit scene?

3066
02:41:20,940 --> 02:41:33,500
chat yeah they got scammed in the club is there an after
wait this this game was made in europe which country who

3067
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:34,060

3068
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:38,800
frozen two

3069
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:52,560
unreal engine i think it was really creative though this
game was very creative with the mechanics and everything i

3070
02:41:52,560 --> 02:42:01,760
love the the I think the level design was really pretty In
general Like I definitely I came into this game really blind

3071
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:11,880
The only thing I remember was like the math And the
beginning Like what they look like Sweden Oh it was made by

3072
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:14,620
the Swedes Oh Oh

3073
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:29,460
I'm surprised like it was You know how like Sweden is like
super fucking was like very cloudy and stuff.

3074
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:35,360
I'm surprised that it was like so sunny out there.

3075
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,020
I've never like even looked over yonder.

3076
02:42:44,320 --> 02:42:46,080
Is there an after credit scene?

3077
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,320
I don't remember.

3078
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:49,420
I didn't check chat.

3079
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,140
I don't know.

3080
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:51,220
I was surprised.

3081
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:53,080
I was like, I can see the sun in this game.

3082
02:42:54,180 --> 02:42:54,520
What?

3083
02:42:56,620 --> 02:42:57,060

Do we skip it?

3089
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:04,980
No, we can't.

3090
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:05,960

Isn't this a Twitch interactive?

3158
02:47:14,950 --> 02:47:15,970

02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:17,710
Oh, my God, I got Twitch partnered!

Yeah, I got Twitch partnered today.

3162
02:47:21,950 --> 02:47:25,990
They sent me an email today, being like, congratulations,
you got Twitch partnered!

3163
02:47:26,850 --> 02:47:33,030
And like, I sent it an app, but I didn't think I would get
in because, like, I literally only streamed it twice.

3164
02:47:33,270 --> 02:47:39,470
And Since I got back and then I got the you'll be like
congratulations You're a twitch partner and I literally

3165
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:44,290
wrote the application because you know, I don't know you
remember but when you write Like why you want to be a twitch

3166
02:47:44,290 --> 02:47:44,690
partner.

3167
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:55,210
You have to write like something and all I wrote was please
I just oh my god, please and I submitted it and you say

3168
02:47:55,210 --> 02:47:57,910
please No, I don't know.

3169
02:47:58,010 --> 02:47:59,310
I think I'm special case here.

3170
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:04,110
I'm pretty sure due to my circumstances They're like, you
know what we know she is

3171
02:48:07,390 --> 02:48:13,350
Um, but yeah, I got it today I was so surprised I honestly
didn't think they would give it to me Because usually

3172
02:48:13,350 --> 02:48:15,970
they're like You have to be active on Twitch

3173
02:48:20,510 --> 02:48:30,630
But yeah The pity part of me That's me Alright, you go You
go Way out Uh, two weeks What?

3174
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:33,330
See you for a way out in two weeks.

3175
02:48:33,530 --> 02:48:33,530
What?

3176
02:48:38,230 --> 02:48:40,090
We're gonna go from married to brothers.

3177
02:48:43,030 --> 02:48:44,730
I mean, it could have been brothers to married.

3178
02:48:45,610 --> 02:48:47,010
Yeah, we should have done it the other way around.

3179
02:48:47,070 --> 02:48:48,850
Yeah, we should have gotten it the other way around.

3180
02:48:48,970 --> 02:48:49,930
That would make more sense.

3181
02:48:50,610 --> 02:48:52,210
I mean, we can make up a...

3182
02:48:52,210 --> 02:48:52,790
Not make up.

3183
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:53,570
It could be a prequel.

3184
02:48:53,870 --> 02:48:54,530
It's our prequel.

3185
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:56,750
Before we were married.

3186
02:48:56,930 --> 02:48:59,530
We could be married and then find out we're brothers.

3187
02:48:59,810 --> 02:49:00,810
Oh, that's true.

3188
02:49:01,410 --> 02:49:10,570
all together yeah we're not telling our kids as long as we
don't tell our child no my friend actually asked me that

3189
02:49:10,570 --> 02:49:18,270
story they were like okay let's say you had a boyfriend and
or a husband and then you had a kid together and like

3190
02:49:18,270 --> 02:49:25,230
they're the most like perfect person in your entire life
like they're exactly what you want you're so happy with them

3191
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:35,270
they're whatever but then you find out you're and divorce
them and also tell your kids or like, what?

3192
02:49:35,830 --> 02:49:37,150
I mean, that's what denial is for.

3193
02:49:38,830 --> 02:49:39,330
That's okay.

3194
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:41,070
Okay.

3195
02:49:43,030 --> 02:49:51,050
Like, like, that, all right, what will you do?

3196
02:49:51,190 --> 02:49:51,870
What will you do?

3197
02:49:53,710 --> 02:49:54,750
I have to think about it.

3198
02:49:55,430 --> 02:49:57,210
Like, like, it doesn't hurt anybody.

3199
02:49:57,210 --> 02:49:57,490
Like, it doesn't hurt anybody.

3200
02:49:58,910 --> 02:50:05,810
Well, Maybe the kid, like, genetically-wise, is because of
inbreeding.

3201
02:50:06,610 --> 02:50:13,070
But as long as a child doesn't go forth and accidentally,
you know, keep it in the family.

3202
02:50:18,370 --> 02:50:20,820
I think...

3203
02:50:20,820 --> 02:50:21,580
Yeah, no.

3204
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:22,780
I think at that point...

3205
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:27,180
As long as only...

3206
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:32,760
As long as only, like, two people know, and it's the
parents, I don't think...

3207
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:45,000
like like it's already done like everything's already done
so it's like there's really nothing you you can't take that

3208
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:55,880
away like it's already there the child's there the product
of the inbreeding's there so like if you suddenly split up

3209
02:50:55,880 --> 02:51:02,120
you have to explain to the child why that happened i mean i
guess you won't explain it to them until you're at your desk

3210
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:10,720
bed and like the child the reason why the reason why you
have so many problems with your health is because your

3211
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:13,760
father and i are actually related

3212
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:24,220
okay but like and then you die and then you die so you don't
have to live with the guilt because you're already dead as

3213
02:51:24,220 --> 02:51:29,900
long you tell them before you they'll have to live with the
trauma after that but you're free you're dead already you

3214
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:38,340
don't have to worry okay wait hold on I I don't quite know
the rules of like Inbreeding and everything so let's say

3215
02:51:38,340 --> 02:51:46,740
we're not siblings like what if we're like second cousin
Does it make it's so yeah the genetic trees still yeah as

3216
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:47,120
bad.

3217
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:48,940
It's not as bad.

3218
02:51:49,220 --> 02:51:59,780
It's not as bad, but it's still bad No, I'm trying to see
how many like health problems the kid would have you're

3219
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:05,960
trying to find a degree of separation here Like, which is
the right amount of separation?

3220
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:07,300
That would be...

3221
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:07,940
It's okay.

3222
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:17,200
It's bad because you can't have, like, if a population goes
at a certain amount of people, if a population, like, dies

3223
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:23,720
off to a certain amount, there's no way for a population to
continue because at some point, inbreeding is going to

3224
02:52:23,720 --> 02:52:24,000
start.

3225
02:52:24,460 --> 02:52:30,460
I don't remember what was the minimum, but, like, every,
like, species needs a minimum requirement to prevent

3226
02:52:30,460 --> 02:52:31,120
inbreeding.

3227
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:32,660
So it doesn't matter.

3228
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:40,780
It has to be incredibly split off So you don't fuck up the
genetics It's 50, right?

3229
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:41,400
Is it 5?

3230
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:50,780
Because I just want to know how fucked up this kid would be
I mean, eventually, okay, if like, okay, I don't even Why

3231
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:53,880
are we, like, thinking about the degrees here?

3232
02:52:54,120 --> 02:52:55,320
Why are we?

3233
02:52:55,420 --> 02:52:56,580
I'm thinking scientific.

3234
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:59,660
For what science?

3235
02:52:59,900 --> 02:53:01,800
Why would you need this as a science?

3236
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:14,300
curvy I think like I think I was just curious okay, I was
just I was just curious like is it the same like amount of

3237
02:53:14,300 --> 02:53:21,340
fucked up genetics if it's like your third like second
cousin Compared to your like brother?

3238
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:25,960
Oh, yeah, because there's less similarities to the genetics.

3239
02:53:25,980 --> 02:53:34,480
Yeah, that's what I'm saying the closer the genes are the
more fucked up the byproducts are Because you can have the

3240
02:53:34,480 --> 02:53:43,200
genetics to be similar because then there's like like issues
health issues So as long as like so if it's like second

3241
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:52,180
cousin removed or something It's less fucked up than your
fucking brother or sister Okay, because i was just wondering

3242
02:53:52,180 --> 02:53:56,940
if it's like Even if it was your second cousin would it be
as fucked up?

3243
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:58,340
Like the kid, it's still fucked.

3244
02:53:58,560 --> 02:53:59,080
Okay, the kid.

3245
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:01,180
No, no like the kid is what i'm talking about.

3246
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:05,200
It's so fucked up Morality, like, morality-wise, it's fucked
up no matter what.

3247
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:06,720
By wondering about the kid.

3248
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:10,300
Well, the kid will be less fucked up than the other kids.

3249
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:14,280
Okay, so they're not going to be the same amount of fucked
up.

3250
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:16,860
No, no, because it's all about genetic similarities.

3251
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:20,160
It's about the genes.

3252
02:54:21,320 --> 02:54:23,020
But, okay, but yes.

3253
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:29,780
Anyway, I think we've established how fucked up it will be
genetically and morally.

3254
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:31,340
So I guess we can...

3255
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:32,760
So we can move...

3256
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:35,200
You were the one that asked me about this.

3257
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:35,500
Oh, no!

3258
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:36,260
A way out!

3259
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:38,420
It wasn't because I was talking about...

3260
02:54:38,420 --> 02:54:40,480
The way out in the brothers' day.

3261
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:43,180
Anyway, guys, I hope you guys had a...

3262
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:44,080
This after...

3263
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:46,820
After game chat got a little bit cursed.

3264
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:47,800
Just a little bit.

3265
02:54:48,080 --> 02:54:50,980
But I hope you guys had a great time.

3266
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:54,940
Gumi, you should go play your TFT so you don't get knocked
out.

3267
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:57,880
I felt like I just learned a lot.

3268
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:02,760
Because I actually watched a Tiki Talk recently about...

3269
02:55:02,780 --> 02:55:04,740
That one family in America.

3270
02:55:07,250 --> 02:55:07,780
What?

3271
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:11,520
The one family in America.

3272
02:55:11,980 --> 02:55:13,420
The Inbred family.

3273
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:13,920
What?

3274
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:17,980
The Lanny Kester?

3275
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:19,790
Lanny?

3276
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:22,960
Lanny?

3277
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:23,780
Lanny?

3278
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:26,680
Lanny?

3279
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:29,580
Well, you don't know about the family?

3280
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:32,160
Oh, what?

3281
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:35,680
There was a documentary on them.

3282
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:36,960
The wood takers.

3283
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:40,140
Of odd West Virginia.

3284
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:43,820
Okay, Goomy.

3285
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:44,420
Stop cooking.

3286
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:44,840
Goomy.

3287
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:45,500
Stop cooking.

3288
02:55:45,580 --> 02:55:48,400
I think we gotta move on from the inbreeding.

3289
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:50,580
I think we have to move on.

3290
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:53,380
Anyways, that's why I was so interested in the science
behind it.

3291
02:55:53,740 --> 02:55:56,500
Because I watched a documentary about it recently.

3292
02:55:58,340 --> 02:56:00,900
Well, by documentary, I meant I watched a TikTok about it.

3293
02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:05,380
the tick tocks of movies and videos now.

3294
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:11,760
No, I watched a tick tock about another person who made a
video on them.

3295
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:12,500
I was like, oh!

3296
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:14,020
So this person...

3297
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:17,000
Anyways.

3298
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:19,260
Anyways, GG's goomies.

3299
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:21,320
I can't believe we finished it.

3300
02:56:21,380 --> 02:56:23,080
We finally did it.

3301
02:56:23,780 --> 02:56:26,760
It took us a while but we fucking did it.

3302
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:27,820
GG's goomies.

3303
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:29,720
Don't get knocked out in TFT.

3304
02:56:30,300 --> 02:56:31,720
We're gonna see you two weeks from now.

3305
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:32,600
Bye goomy.

3306
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:50,280
bye bye bye love you all right that was like the most cursed
topic that we've had for a while so uh but we did it guys we

3307
02:56:50,280 --> 02:57:00,620
beat it takes two finally the stream one of us the most
streamed games for co-op ever and we fucking finally did it

3308
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:11,180
i hope you guys had a great time watching us um i'm gonna
call it here um how to go to therapy in like three hours we

3309
02:57:11,180 --> 02:57:23,100
just finished relation we just finished marriage counseling
and now i have to go to actual therapy later so i'm gonna go

3310
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:30,920
head out now i hope you guys had a great time everybody as
always everyone stay hydrated posture check get up and move

3311
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:36,720
around to get that blood flowing and if you stay up for us,
head to bed, because you deserve it.

3312
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:38,360
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3313
02:57:38,980 --> 02:57:39,720
Bye guys.

3314
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:40,680
Bye.
