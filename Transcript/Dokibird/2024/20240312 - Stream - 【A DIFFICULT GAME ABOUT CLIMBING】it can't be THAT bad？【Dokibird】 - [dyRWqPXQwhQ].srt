I sure did.

9
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,320
I slept so much.

10
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,420
Oh my gosh, I slept a lot.

11
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,100
Oh my god, look at all of you guys.

12
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,760
believe it's been one month of memberships already that's
actually crazy that's a really i've been like streaming for

13
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:41,340
a month now oh my god congratulations um i have no other
badges other than tomatoes so and we won't be having other

14
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:52,140
badges yet okay the reason why is that um i'm trying to like
finalize some stuff right now regarding like my new skin

15
00:03:52,140 --> 00:04:00,420
suit so like is why we don't have a badge after the tomato
because I'm trying to like figure out what I want to do uh

16
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,960
what I want to do for my badges at the moment most likely
will be dragoon themed as always but then like I'm like

17
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:15,560
trying to figure out for uh like after because like you know
we you know after the dragoon badges like what's after that

18
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:28,000
so so that's why that's why um there's no there's in a
tomato badge for now like we're trying to do everything i'm

19
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,180
wondering so many things i have to do anyway um i love how
like this game has like a rage quit option too that that

20
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,780
makes sense that makes sense for the type of game that we're
playing today for those who are wondering wow dokey what

21
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,020
game are you playing today it's called a difficult game
about climbing it's not by the creators of getting over it

22
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:00,660
um it is like a spiritual success to getting over it by some
different person instead of you know a pot and a

23
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,800
sledgehammer we're gonna be rock climbing and like okay I
usually never touch these types of games but I also had a

24
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,520
perfectly good excuse to not touch these types of games one
of them was that like I could be like oh I don't know guys

25
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:25,300
perm issue but now I don't really have that anymore FOMO,
the fear of missing out.

26
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,880
You know, because, like, it just came out, and everybody is
playing it now.

27
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
All the streamers are playing it.

28
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,660
So, like, no!

29
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,900
Now I have FOMO!

30
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,840
I can't use the excuse anymore!

31
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,820
Because then I could be like, well, guys, the game came out
a long time ago.

32
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,800
And, like, I don't want to put myself through that.

33
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,340
I don't want to put myself through that, because I know it's
a really, it's a rage game.

34
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,280
It's a game that's making you're supposed to be raging the
game just came out

35
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,600
This game this game is just came out.

36
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,660
So now I don't have any excuse because it's the streamer
game now And now I'm feeling the FOMO.

37
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm feeling it guys.

38
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm feeling the fear of missing out I don't have any excuses
anymore.

39
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,020
I'm weak to FOMO

40
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,320
It's the meta stream game I need to follow the meta.

41
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,700
I'm always following the meta No I'm really feeling the FOMO
at the moment.

42
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,220
I'm feeling it.

43
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,820
Okay, also like we're gonna have some background music
because like this this game is like it's like water You you

44
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,100
hear you hear water.

45
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:54,660
So let me just let me put like a BGM just to be a little
sane I don't know if you guys can hear that.

46
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,180
That might be a bit too quiet.

47
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,060
Alright, here we go.

48
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,240
Alright, so the goal is to climb.

49
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,580
Okay, I don't know if the game is too loud.

50
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,540
Let me check.

51
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,960
Alright, okay, and then we do this.

52
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,780
And then, how do I?

53
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,340
And then I grab, like, oh, wait, this is so easy!

54
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,740
What's so difficult about climbing?

55
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,840
I don't understand.

56
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,320
What can be so difficult about this?

57
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,380

63
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,660
Okay, wait.

difficult game about climbing.

70
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,000

71
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,220

Is it?

73
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,400
Oh, it's because this water is... This is a shaky rock.

74
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,320
Because it's like water.

What do I do from here?

176
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,450
Down?

177
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,270
What?

178
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,230
I don't want to go down.

179
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,510
I worked so hard to get here!

180
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,930
What do I...

181
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,670
No!

182
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,370
Don't make me go down!

183
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,650
The leap of faith.

184
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,910
Okay, here we go.

185
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:18,730
Oh!

186
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,630
No!

187
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,430
No!

188
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,660
Why did I listen?

189
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Why did I listen to you guys?

190
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,720
Oh, so it's a BGM too loud or is it good?

191
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,900
No.

192
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,960
Why did I go down?

193
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,860
It was too much pain.

194
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,040
Too, not that down.

195
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,180
The other down.

196
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,120
Oh, shit.

197
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,000
It's too quiet?

198
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,560
Okay.

199
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,860
I didn't realize it was too quiet.

200
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,260
I've been listening to the sound.

201
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,400
This BGM, like, blasted up to my ears.

202
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,140
Do you guys hear that?

203
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,820
Okay, I'll turn it up a little.

204
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,860
Oh, now.

205
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,680
Alright.

206
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,820

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,160
We're fine.

211
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,680

Okay.

248
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,800
There we go.

249
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,400
Alright.

250
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,880
Then...

251
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:27,940
Okay.

252
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:28,740

Wait.

255
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,540
What the fuck?

256
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,260
How did you lose your grip?

257
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,800
How did you lose your grip?

258
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,120
There we go.

259
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,680
Nice.

260
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,700
I figured it out.

261
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,740
I figured out the system.

262
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,660
And then we grab this.

263
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,040
Oh, God.

264
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,880
This is scary.

265
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:50,860
No.

266
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,220
No.

267
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,540
No.

268
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:51,880
No.

269
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,180
No.

270
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,480
No.

271
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:52,720
No.

272
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:52,780
No.

273
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:52,780
No.

274
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,020
No.

275
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,120
No.

276
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,600
No, no, no, no!

277
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,500
Ah!

278
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,220
Why?

279
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm gonna need to get out of a controller.

280
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,520
I need...

281
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,940
Okay, up, higher.

282
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,100
The sensitivity must be higher!

283
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,320
Okay.

284
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,280
Honestly, I think it's like you max out the senses the way
to go, honestly, at this point.

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,220
Alright.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,320
Okay.

287
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,060
Nice.

288
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,380
Nice.

289
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,760
We got this one down.

290
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Alright.

291
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,280
And then...

292
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,560
I don't understand why my grip will sometimes get fucked.

293
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,220
I don't understand.

294
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,420
Okay.

295
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,940
Alright.

296
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
And then we just keep...

297
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,660
Boost!

298
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,420
Alright.

299
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,800
And then we grab this.

300
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,620
And then... Okay.

301
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,400
Okay.

302
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,280
Boost!

303
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,100
Nice.

304
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,280
Okay, okay.

305
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,660
Here you go.

306
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,300
This is the way.

307
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,120
Boost!

308
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,440

Okay.

314
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,720
I didn't grab the tree branch there.

315
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,000
Alright, here we go.

316
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,660

No, no, no.

322
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,900
That's not a bush.

323
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,720
Okay, we need to grab.

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
We need to grab the grass.

325
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,660
Grab the grass, sir.

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,320
Okay.

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,960
Here we go.

329
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,040
And we need to grab a higher upper of the grass.

330
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,220
Okay, one, two, three!

331
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,100

Alright!

334
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,280
This part, I don't know.

335
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,300
I don't know.

336
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,740
Do I just swing?

337
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,160

Okay, that was scary.

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,280
That was a little scary.

342
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,200
There's bones now, too.

343
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,080

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,500
That's a bad idea.

352
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,580

Damn you, FOMO.

363
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,260
Why are ranged game streamer games?

364
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,360
God damn it.

365
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,020
I wish I was a game programmer.

412
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,920
The scariest part is the dropping down.

413
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,100

Do I swing?

435
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,220
There's no way.

436
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,380
There's no way I can make it.

437
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,240

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,120

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:10,220
When you enter the town, when you enter the lobby, the
pre-made town, you get to pick your faction.

549
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,880
So, like, obviously the faction is going to be divided by,
like, Long Goon, Chonky Goon, Egg Goon, and, like, regular

550
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,400
Goon.

551
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,640
And, like, and then, like, there's going to be, like, power
levels.

552
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,020
And, like, the stronger your faction is, the more land you
can claim.

553
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:41,480
be like you can like wage wars against other dragon for more
land and and like and like there's gonna be like a communal

554
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:52,460
bank system or something and so like the more the more
dragon types you kill like the more enemy dragoons you kill

555
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:02,080
the more lad you can claim so i was like talking to like the
minecraft team about that

556
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:12,440
so all right here you go let's see i'm gonna figure out how
to swing which which is the best area to swing from like do

571
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:08,020
I swear to God, I will pull up the fucking speedrun of this
just to figure out which is the optimal swing.

572
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,040
Okay.

573
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:13,940
Okay.

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,300
No!

576
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,180
No!

577
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,880
No!

578
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,160
I'm fucking pulling up the vote.

579
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,900
Give me a second

580
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,940
Difficult game about climbing speed run.

581
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,060
I'm pulling up.

582
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,980
I'm fucking all right 7.55.

583
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,940
What the fuck it goes to us?

584
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,240

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,880
Okay What the fuck guys?

586
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,820
Okay, I blame you guys This could have been so much easier

587
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,320
Like, guys, I can't believe you made this harder than I
expected.

588
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,140
I can't believe it.

589
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,600
Alright, I should have just...

590
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,840
I should have just fucking watched a professional.

591
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,080
I see.

592
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,720
Yeah, why is he...

593
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,080
Phanab?

594
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,920
Alright, here you go.

595
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,480
I can't believe it, guys.

596
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,940
My Oshim MatPat graduated, like...

597
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,740
Was it yesterday?

598
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,660
I don't even remember.

599
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,440
Guys, he's my Oshim, but I don't even remember.

600
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
I can't believe it.

601
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,460
The biggest graduation stream I've ever seen.

602
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,040
All right, here you go.

603
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,060
Sad.

604
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,580
I can't believe it.

605
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:45,840
I like how he made, I watched a little bit because I was
curious, like, what his last video was going to be.

606
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,660
And then, like, I love how, like, he, like, announced a
website and it literally crashed in one second.

607
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,800
Like, I thought I was like, I was like, is this a virus?

608
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,400
Because I was like, What is this website?

609
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,560
And then, like, what the fuck?

610
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,400
It literally crashed the moment it was posted.

611
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,580
Okay.

612
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

613
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,040
Okay.

614
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,060
There we go.

615
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,460
Nice.

616
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,500
Alright, we're good.

617
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,720
We're good.

618
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,040
This is fine.

619
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,180
This part I got, hands down.

620
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,540
Oh.

621
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,240
Except for that part.

622
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,020
This part I got, like, easily.

623
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:17,840
Alright.

624
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,200
07 to our Oshi map, Pat.

625
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,780
Now, who am I going to go to?

626
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,320
all the wacky FNAF theories.

627
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,140
It's funny, though, to see him, like, call out Scott for,
like, stealing his theories.

628
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,340
But Scott literally made him.

629
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,740
The creator of FNAF.

630
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,860
Like, his... Like, yeah, his videos were popular, but, like,
FNAF made him for who he is.

631
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,220
Okay.

632
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,120
Let's see.

633
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,820
Here we go.

634
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,920
Woo!

635
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,640
What the fuck?

636
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Okay.

637
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,520
That is, like, so scary, though.

638
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,500
Every time.

639
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,280
Every time I'm doing that leap of fate.

640
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
Okay, it's, like, here.

641
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,900
This is the spot, the optimal swing spot.

642
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,220
And then you go like this.

643
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,560
Who?

644
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,240
Okay, wait.

645
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,720
Wait, and then...

646
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,140
Oh, my God.

647
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,940
This is so scary.

648
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Okay.

649
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,380
Give me a sec.

650
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,540
I need to add the last...

651
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,840
He is.

652
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
Give me a sec.

653
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,440
How does he do it?

654
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,220
How does this man do it?

655
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,960
Okay, he grabs...

656
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
Oh my god, that's so scary!

657
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,800
How does he do that?

658
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,200
Okay, am I at that right spot?

659
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,860
Is it higher?

660
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,880
It's higher, okay.

661
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:35,940
Okay.

662
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,920
Okay, it's like here.

663
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,280
This is how he does it.

664
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,220
This is so scary.

665
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,200
I have to believe.

666
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,320
What?

667
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,840
It doesn't matter if I'm cheating!

668
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,700
I can't even get it right!

669
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,140
Okay, wait, wait, but I can't even get that shit right!

670
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,620
What does it matter?

671
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,660
But what I did learn.

672
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,500
What I did learn.

673
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,700
What I did learn.

674
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,100
How does he do it?

675
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,240
How does he do it?

676
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,180
Please.

677
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,120
This would save so much time.

678
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,660
Please.

679
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,040
Please, purple guy.

680
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,160
No.

681
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,480
Okay, this would save so much time, though.

682
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,360
Just think about it.

683
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,940
Just think about it.

684
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,600
Please.

685
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,040
This would save so much time.

686
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,520
I know you can do this.

687
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,560
Oh, no, you can do it.

688
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:39,920
I...

689
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,860
Fuck, I give up.

690
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,460
Well, we're fucking...

691
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,520
We're not meant to speedrun.

692
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,180
We were never meant to speedrun, guys.

693
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
We were...

694
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,860
We were not meant to speedrun.

695
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,580
We were just a streamer.

696
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:53,960
Okay.

697
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,820
Look, I speedrun real games.

698
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,860
Like, Peppa Pig.

699
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,100
Not fucking difficult game about climbing.

700
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,300
You won't see this in SDGT, cutie.

701
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,300
Okay.

702
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:07,860
Ugh.

703
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,960
Please.

704
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,220
No, I'm losing it.

705
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,340
I'm losing it.

706
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm losing my touch.

707
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,260
No, no, no.

708
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,240
You're not losing it, Doki.

709
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,620
You gotta believe.

710
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,320
Come on.

711
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,740
Come on.

712
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,220
This is so easy for you.

713
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,240
Okay.

714
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,420
Okay.

715
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,340
Oh, no.

716
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,220
This is not the right angle.

717
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,840
This is not the right angle.

718
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,940
Okay, one, two, three!

719
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,000
There you go.

720
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,640
Oh, I mean, the controls aren't bad.

721
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
The controls aren't bad.

722
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,080
It's a fun game.

723
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,340
Oh, no, please, please, please, please.

724
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,360
Grab some sand.

725
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,460
Okay.

726
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,940
Okay.

727
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,380
Come on, up you go.

728
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,100
All right.

729
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Oh, God.

730
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,740
Oh, God.

731
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,280
Okay.

732
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,120
We're good, we're good, we're good.

733
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,720
And we have to swing from here.

734
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,480
Okay.

735
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,840
I got the swing for this down.

736
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,360
Ah!

737
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,640
Yeah.

738
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,220
Okay.

739
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,960
Like, I got the leap of faith for this down.

740
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,540
But how do you do this?

741
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,500
Like...

742
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:23,860
Oh!

743
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,260
What arm is this?

744
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,040
What arm is this?

745
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,160
What arm is this?

746
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,520
Okay, that's this arm.

747
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:29,960
Okay.

748
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,520
Can I climb this?

749
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,020
Why can't I climb this?

750
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,310
Give me.

751
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,080

Give me...

754
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,880
Why can't I climb this?

755
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,800
I don't...

756
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,980
Oh, God.

757
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,440
Oh, God.

758
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,340
Oh, God.

759
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,640
Oh, oh, please.

00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:39,420
it was there, it was in my grass, I can't fail, didn't I, I

That's fucking right.

790
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,720

791
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,880
Go purple guy, go.

792
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,800
Okay, I figured it out.

00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,000
I figured it out.

794
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,120
Okay, give me a sec.

795
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,840
I still need to figure this out, though.

796
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,860
I figured it out, guys.

797
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,960
Purple guy taught me.

798
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,660
Watch this.

799
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,120
Do you guys want to see something cool?

800
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,260
Okay, not yet.

801
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,380
Do you guys want to see something cool?

802
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,120
I cut my time!

803
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,820
So, guys, I pioneered that.

804
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,660
I just made up that trick today.

805
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,240
Guys, isn't that cool?

806
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,860
Guys, I made up that trick, guys.

807
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,900
Oh, my God.

808
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,800
Please.

809
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,480
It's not plagiarized.

810
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,240
It's called the Doki Grasp.

811
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,820
Trademarked by Doki.

812
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,500
I discovered it today.

813
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:48,480
Guys.

814
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:49,900
Damn.

815
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,100
Not a trade.

816
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,520
I trademarked it.

817
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,980
Guys, call me...

818
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,580
Who is it?

819
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,840
Who's the guy who steals all?

820
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,860
I mean, who, like, invents everything.

821
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,660
Thomas Edison.

822
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,620
Wait, no.

823
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,820
What is it?

824
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,700
Guys, Tesla, who?

825
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,020
Okay, here you go.

826
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,640

All right.

829
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,560
He was a genius, Thomas Edison, inventing all these
inventions.

830
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,460
That's right.

831
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:38,560
role model right there guys what a fuck is Tesla all I know
about Tesla is that it's a car that's his only contribution

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:48,300
to society he tried to fucking frame my Oshi Thomas Edison
for stealing ideas I'm fucking he's the loser who didn't

833
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,560
trademark Let's see.

834
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,340

838
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,620
Well, I don't want to grow up.

839
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,720
I want me just like Mr. Edison inventing all those cool
ideas.

840
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,660
Just like, I'm getting there.

841
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,280
I invented the dokey grasp.

842
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,440
Oh my god, speedrunners are going to use.

843
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:26,200
Okay, anytime you see a speedrunner that used my passionate
dokey grasp, just remember I did that.

844
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,860
I...

845
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,400
I pioneered the dokey grass.

846
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Watch this.

847
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,100

I don't drop.

884
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,560
Every time I fall, it's like strategic, guys.

885
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,500
I just felt like I reset my timer, guys.

886
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,860
I reset my timer every time I drop.

887
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,120
Because I feel like it's just not...

888
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,200
It's just not an optimal time.

889
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,920
As a fellow speedrunner, you would understand, but you're
not.

890
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,140
You don't understand because you're not part of the group.

891
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,580
Look at that.

892
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,500
Look at that.

893
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,100
Fuck, okay.

894
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,200
Guys, I just wanted to do it again, guys.

895
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:43,280
I was like, I was like, that was way too easy that I knew,
like, people didn't see it, so I had to do it again.

896
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,680
Guys, I was like, oh my God, that was way too fucking easy
how I grasped that.

897
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,300
everybody that missed out.

898
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,520
Okay.

899
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,500
Please.

900
00:45:59,780 --> 00:45:59,880
Please.

901
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,100
Please.

902
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,720
Okay, wait.

903
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,640
There you go.

904
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,140
All right, there you go.

905
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,340
Yeah, you guys saw that?

906
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,180
All right, good, because I'm not doing it again.

907
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,320
I felt like I was giving you guys too many examples on how

I don't understand.

922
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,330
How the fuck did I do it?

923
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,490
Needs work, but the donkey drop is on point.

I don't understand.

928
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,610

929
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,210
How?

930
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,390
Okay.

931
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,990
It was just so perfect that I can't perfect it.

932
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:13,750
Okay.

933
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,850

00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:17,670
All right.

We're good.

939
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,370
All right.

940
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:23,750
We're just gonna keep climbing.

941
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:35,130
keep climbing keep climbing you will get the jokie swing
give me a second you look at a professional time out time

942
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:39,070
out it's like basketball where you get your coach in guys
don't worry i have a coach

943
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:49,870
don't worry i have a coach how the fuck does he do that is
it because he has a top hat

944
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,330
Is it the top hat?

945
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:57,990
Is it the fucking top hat?

946
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:59,510
How do I get the top hat?

947
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,110
Okay, I need to make sure I don't fall.

948
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:04,490
What arm is this?

949
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:05,430
Oh, God.

950
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:05,730
Okay.

951
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,330
Okay, here you go.

952
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,070
Okay.

953
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,110
It must be the hat.

954
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,290
I think it's the hat.

955
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,510
I think it's the fucking hat.

956
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,010
There's...

957
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,550
Oh, oh, God.

958
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:18,650
I do that timeout.

959
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,050
That timeout worked, guys.

960
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,490
The timeout!

961
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,810
Oh, God.

962
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:26,950
Oh!

963
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,180
No!

964
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,120
Use a foot.

965
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:44,920
Guys!

966
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,880
If I could use a foot, I would use a foot!

967
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,340
Okay.

968
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,580
Here you go.

969
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,860
Oh, yeah, it's okay.

970
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,280
It's okay.

971
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,740
It gives me more chance to perfect all my techniques.

972
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,480
Guys, it's like that...

973
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,460
It's like that...

974
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,980
That Kung Fu movie where, like, Like, you do, like,
meaningless task.

975
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,860
You think, like, they're meaningless tasks.

976
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,360
But, like, all these techniques that we're learning now.

977
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,540
Like, the...

978
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,020
Like, the...

979
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,000
Like, the Doki...

980
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,220
The Doki...

981
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,920
Grasp.

982
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,560
It's gonna help us in the long run, guys.

983
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,340
Guys, like, that shit?

984
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,180
Look at that.

985
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,640
Look at that.

986
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,040
I figured out the shortcut, too.

987
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,480
Okay.

988
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,660
Yeah, yeah, Karate Kid.

989
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,120
We're just Karate Kidding it right now.

990
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,400
The Doki Grasp.

991
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,740
It's gonna save lives.

992
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,700
You don't understand.

993
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,100
We're just slowly perfecting the dokey grasp.

994
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,940
And then it'll be like baby mode.

995
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,940
I'm just gonna put them...

996
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,580
You'll see.

997
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,320
You'll see, you guys.

998
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,460
The moment I let go of my training weights.

999
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,040
You'll see.

1000
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,520
Okay, here you go.

1001
00:50:59,240 --> 00:50:59,680
Please.

1002
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:00,840

1003
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,420
Okay, okay, here you go.

1004
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,260
Oh, God, please, please, please.

1005

Please.

1006
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:06,720
Please.

1007
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,140
Please.

1008
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,200
Just firmly grasp it.

1009
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Please.

1010
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,160
We perfected you.

1011
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,360

1012
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,800

1013
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,060
Okay.

1014
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,840
I told you we perfected it.

1015
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,880
I knew we perfected this.

1016
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,960
Look at that.

1017
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,280
Look at how fast we cut time!

1018
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,240
Okay.

1019
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,440
Okay.

1020
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:27,860
Okay.

1021
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,320
Oh.

1022
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,600
Oh my god.

1023
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,740
The dokey swing.

1025
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,800

00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,460
Okay, okay, time out.

1034
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,840
How do you do that swing?

1035
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,600
Okay, he was like, whoa!

00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,620

Each atom that stone.

1062
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,230
Each mineral flake of that night filled mountain.

1063
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,670
An item forms a world.

1064
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,710
The struggle itself to towards the height is enough to fill
a bird's heart.

1065
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,750
One must imagine Tokyo is happy.

1066

00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,270
The coach saw a city!

1071
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,170
It exists.

1072
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,530
It's like the fountain of youth.

1073
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,550
It exists, guys.

1074
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,390
I'll be the Spaniards who discovered the city.

1075
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:13,410

Thank you, Doki, for showing me how to master the Doki dive.

1078
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,950
Now I feel like a true speedrun.

1079
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,830
No!

1080
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,210
This won't be my legacy!

1081
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,410
Oh my god, the Doki swing.

1082
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,110
The Doki swing is getting better and better.

1083
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:53,870
I refuse to let that be my legacy Oh god Please Please Come

1084
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,480
There's the civilization Shit.

00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,400
I just want to see the city.

1090
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,640
Please.

1091
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,640
I just want to know what the city looks like.

1092
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,540
They must have fiber over there.

1093
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,700
Oh god.

1094
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,480
At least like that part is getting easier.

1095
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,160
Of course it's easy.

1096
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,700
I fucking trademarked that.

1097
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,300
Of course.

1098
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,080
Joki, what are you trying to say?

1099
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,020
Of course it'll be easy.

1100
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,160
You literally trademarked this...

1101
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,660
God damn it, swing.

1102
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,760
Nice and thank you for the super chat.

1103
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,760
Thank you, thank you.

1104
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,120
Hey, Doki, I'll be like the back roll banner.

1105
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:50,680
Oh!

1106
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,040
I'll go check it out later.

1107
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:52,920
You're right.

1108
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,000
Don't worry.

1109
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,580
But first, Doki must grasp.

1110
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,380
And Doki must swing.

1111
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,780
Don't worry.

1112
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:02,960
Oh my god.

1113
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,140
Please, please stop worrying.

1114
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,940
Guys, please stop worrying.

1115
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:07,940
Doki's got this.

1116
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,220
God, please.

1117
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,540
Guys, why are you worried?

1118
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,140
Why are you worried, guys?

1119
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,880
Doki's got this!

1120
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,660
Doki, what happened?

1121
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,440
You were a master?

1122
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,880
There you go.

1123
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,060
There you go.

1124
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,060
Good job.

1125
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,980
God, why are you so fucking good at video games?

1126
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,140
Okay.

1127
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,820
No!

1128
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:35,880
Stop!

1129
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:36,420

Thank you, thank you.

1134
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,240
It's really cool that they break up this swimming game with
a bit of rock climbing.

1135
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1136
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,900
Thank you, thank you.

1137
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:02,100
I swear, I'm pretty sure more than 50% of a game is me
climbing.

1138
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,080
You can't say that.

1139
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,980
You can't say that.

1140
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:14,980
How dare you this is the stream where the where I've
discovered the speed run the speed run technique How dare

Oh, God.

1143
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,520
Okay.

1144
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,560
All right.

This is a master at work right now This is literally a
master at work.

1148
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,260
Oh God, please, please.

00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,800

Oh, God.

1152
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,160
I almost fell off.

1153
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,880
I let go.

1154
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,200
I was so excited.

1155
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,840
I actually let go.

1156
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,780
I knew it.

1157
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,540
I knew the Doki Swing was right!

1158
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:50,860
Okay.

1159
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:52,960
Okay.

1160
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:54,580

00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,380
The Doki Swing.

1162
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,220
The Doki Swing will always prevail.

1163
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,320
There were so many doubters.

1164
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,240
So many people that didn't believe in me.

1165
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:08,880
That's right.

1166
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,320
You're all Teslas.

1167
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,040

I can't tell.

1221
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,880
I can't tell what I can grab and what I can't grab.

1222
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,480
No, that's just rock.

1223
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:55,380
Wait, what?

1224
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,620

01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,680
That was a little too close.

1233
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:49,900
I didn't like that.

1234
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,700
I didn't like that.

1235
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,340
Guys, I might have to call a timeout.

1236
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,520
My coach might want me to call a timeout, guys.

1237
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:56,500
I...

1238
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,720
Okay, here we go.

1239
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:02,780

01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,440
Up, Baco.

1242
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,400
No, no, no.

1243
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,440
Oh, sanctuary!

1244
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:09,580
Sanctuary!

1245
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:15,200
It started thinking with a super chat.

1246
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:15,720
Thank you.

1247
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,560
Thank you.

1248
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,840
Guys, I might have to call it basketball timeout, guys.

1249
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,120
Okay, thank you.

1250
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,220
No coach only club.

1251
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:30,300
Do you think Michael Phelps didn't do it all by himself?

1252
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,340
Michael Phelps.

1253
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:38,200
I don't know if you guys know other than his fucking
proportionally abnormal fucking body.

1254
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,600
Because his fucking arms are longer than, like, the fucking
rest of his body.

1255
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,480
He needed a coach, too, guys.

1256
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,360
It's not just genetics.

1257
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1258
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:54,880
Okay.

1259
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:55,960
All right.

1260
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,440
Okay, here we go.

1261
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:58,680
Okay.

1262
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,760
All right, this is it.

1263
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,300
This is it.

1264
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,760
All right, we grass the bush.

1265

Guys, it's not just genetics.

We have to remember the coaches we have all alive!

1274
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,640
You think Thomas Edison did this all by himself?

1275
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,320
He did.

1276
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,580
He's a fucking genius, and that's why he's my O-Sheet.

1277
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,740
Don't believe the lies, Tesla says.

1311
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,550
Guys, I'm calling in my coach, Thomas Edison.

1312
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,710
Yes, I'm calling in my coach.

1313
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:56,910
How does he do it?

1314
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:58,630
Coach, coach, I'm struggling.

1315
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,230
How do you do that, coach?

1316
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,210

1317
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,730

Okay.

1321
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:13,970
Coach is there.

01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,110
Coach, Coach Edison!

1323
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,770
Thank you, Coach Edison.

happen okay all right i figured out though i figured out how
to get through that coach said that was supposed to happen

1333
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:58,510

01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,470
Okay.

1356
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,670
Alright, we gotta get up from here.

1364
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:04,490
We're fine.

1365
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:06,950

01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:47,190
I remember when I first saw Maoshi, Mr. Thomas Edison.

1388
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,290
He promised me a tale.

1389
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,790
He promised me a golden city.

1390
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,310

1391
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,550

I can't even, okay, here we go.

1399
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:45,730
It says DC electricity has been reduced to batteries.

1400
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:51,110
Tesla's AC electricity is used to power up homes and
appliances today.

1401
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:51,970
Checkmate.

1402
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,610
That's a lie.

1403
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:57,150
That's a lie that Tesla wants you to believe.

1404
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:04,810
Those were paid for by Tesla shares.

1405
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,170
Open your mind.

1406
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,610
Open your mind.

1407
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,490
Tesla paid for all that.

1408
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:21,190
You're getting shielded by the Tesla core.

1409
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,710
Nice try, Tesla propagandist.

1410
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,630
You can't fool me.

1411
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:32,410
Edison already told me to be careful with people like you.

1412
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:37,600
Okay.

1413
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:38,860
Here we go.

1414
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:39,960
Here we go.

1415
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,960
Please, I cannot grab that rocket.

1416
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,720
Don't be a sheep.

1417
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,020
Open your eyes.

1418
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,400
Oh, thank God.

1419
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,860
It just hit my head on the rocket.

1420
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:53,240
It's okay.

1421
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,160
I'm still here.

1422
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,300
Get off Twitter.

1423
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:03,020
Get off Twitter and read a book.

1424
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,000
Tesla share.

1425
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,360
Read the history books.

1426
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,620
No one talks about Tesla there.

1427
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,460
They say history books are written by winners.

1428
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,500
That means it's true.

1429
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,520
That means Thomas Edison won.

1430
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,760
So it's true.

1431
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,100
Here you go.

1432
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,680
Edison lives in Doki's head.

1433
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,060
That's so true.

1434
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:40,880
That's right!

1435
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,740
That means Tesla's a loser!

1436
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,760
If he's not in that history, books!

1437
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,700
Alright, let's go.

1438
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:52,200
I didn't expect myself to start my day ranting about this.

1439
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,440
It is an impenetra- Exactly!

1440
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,780
Taurus, thank you for listening to the chat, thank you,
thank you.

1441
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:02,400
Okay.

1442
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:03,560
Alright.

1443
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,140
Here we go.

1444
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,170
That's- here we go.

1445
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:12,270
Make a bullet!

1446
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:14,410
Vincent versus Tesla.

1447
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,370
I don't need to make a poll.

1448
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,110
I know who's a real winner.

1449
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,270
Okay.

1450
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:25,790
Here we go.

1451
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,210
Oh my god.

1452
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,870
You know, now that I think about it, eventually somebody's
gonna draw like Bishiman.

1453
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,250
Is that how you pronounce it?

1454
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:37,070
Bishiman, Tesla, and Edison.

1455
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:45,450
Unless somebody were gonna draw like, someone's gonna draw
like a manga but like Tesla and Edison or something like

1456
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:53,310
reincarnated Tesla and Edison in like modern world and then
people are going to ship this to I swear if it hasn't been

1457
01:15:53,310 --> 01:16:06,290
done already I know it's going to happen manga manga anime
has no balance it will always happen eventually it already

1458
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:17,050
exists yeah it came then tesla and edison i can feel it to
edison is the jock and then

1459
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:26,550
and tesla's the art kid the worlds collide

1460
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:41,190
don't you stop here you go if it hasn't happened yet it's
going to you guys know it don't stop it available.

1461
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,330
You can't stop it.

1462
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,030
Okay.

1463
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:46,250
Here you go.

1464
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,450
Please, let me grasp the rock.

1465
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:55,090
Here you go.

1466
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:57,150
Oh, God.

1467
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:58,670
Oh, right.

1468
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,090
And then, okay, here you go.

1469
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:04,410
And then, like, Edison and Tesla got a sign on a science
project together.

1470
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:15,490
And then Tesla thought that, like, Edison and him were
getting closer but then like he felt betrayed because thomas

1471
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:21,970
edison took all the credit for his work and then never
talked to him again after the science project and then he

1472
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,950
was heartbroken stop

1473
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:42,270

1479
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:25,830
Please for Edison!

1480
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:28,710
Ah, please.

1481
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,850
Please, I'm just...

1482
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,670

He's filming this, please.

1484
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:41,330
Please, I don't want to be kicked out of the Edison Club.

1485
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,270
I worked so hard!

1486
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:44,510
There you go.

1487
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:45,390
Oh, thank God.

1488
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:45,910
No!

1489
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:48,490
No!

1490
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:50,630
No!

1491
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,490
No!

1492
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:52,570
No!

1493
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,110
You're right, thank you for the super chat.

1494
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,030
Thank you, thank you.

1495
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,770
And it's a new telegram.

1496
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,830
Who's this Tesla fiercely typing?

1497
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:01,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1498
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:02,550
Thank you, thank you.

1499
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,390
Oh, Dira, thank you for the super chat.

1500
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:07,410
Thank you, thank you.

1501
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,330
Okay, wait, wait.

1502
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:09,350
Wait, before I...

1503
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,670
No!

1504
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:10,270
No!

1505
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:10,310
No!

1506
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,050
because of the Hamilton musical.

1507
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:21,370
I've ironically seen people shift historical figures of
those guys are based off.

1508
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:24,670
So Tesla X Edison is definitely a thing that probably
exists.

1509
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,210
Anything is shippable.

1510
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,670
You can't avoid it.

1511
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:38,810
Kitchen appliances can't be shippable.

1512
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:40,390
Are you thinking hard enough?

1513
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,010
But please don't think hard enough.

1514
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:55,730
guys we don't need all right okay here go all right dokey
please stop cooking i'm not reckoning for nicola to ship

1515
01:19:55,730 --> 01:20:02,830
this sale thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
it's too late it's too late i'm pretty sure it already

1516
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:07,610
exists i'm pretty sure we just need to make them anime boys

1517
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:18,370
We need to make them anime boys or girls, you know, because
that also works, too.

1518
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:28,250
If we can do it with countries, we can do it with Tesla and
Addison.

1519
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:35,570
Not just once, but three times.

1520
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:39,250
Do you think it only happened in Italia?

1521
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:48,830
Notification of countries three fucking times and they are
always getting shipped

1522
01:20:53,110 --> 01:21:00,230
Stop cooking Three fucking times when will we stop?

1523
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:12,010
Okay, anyway, here we go And one time they were just balls,
but yet people still shipped them they were just balls

1524
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,600
What do we learn?

1525
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,880
We will never learn.

1526
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:20,340
Weird.

1527
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,680
You're so right now.

1528
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,000
What the hell is she yapping about?

1529
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:31,660
No!

1530
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:33,220
No!

1531
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,500
I got kicked out of my sanctuary!

1532
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,080
No!

1533
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,700
No!

1534
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:47,630
No!

1535
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,130
I talked too much!

1536
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,410
No!

1537
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:57,290
Tesla!

1538
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:58,860
This is your fault!

1539
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,930
America's only ship is to oil.

1540
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,810
I should thank you for the same for Jen.

1541
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:06,910
Thank you.

1542
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:09,270
I got kicked out for talking too.

1543
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:13,110
We're talking too much about shipping.

1544
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:16,310
No!

1545
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:18,710
Just saying too much.

1546
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:20,710
No!

1547
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:27,010
I don't even remember I did this!

1548
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:28,010
Okay.

1549
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,010
Okay, here we go.

1550
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:31,630
The dokey grass.

1551
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,170
No, the dokey grass.

1552
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:36,350
Oh my god.

1553
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,650
It's not muscle memory anymore.

1554
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:41,870
It's been too long since I've grasped here.

1555
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:42,850
Okay.

1556
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:44,950
Alright.

1557
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:47,190
We just gotta...

1558
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,390

1563
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:27,050
Okay.

1564
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,630

It's fine.

1567
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,730
That doesn't count as a fall.

1568
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:35,870
I grasped the mountain in time.

1569
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:37,790
Okay, here you go.

1570
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:39,130

01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,790
Edison for life.

1574
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:46,830
Mahoshi.

1575
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:48,610
He can do no wrong!

1576
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,470
Okay.

1577

Grasp.

01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:00,490
I don't remember how to do the swing.

1583
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:04,050
The Doki swing eludes me.

1584
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:05,050
I spin.

1585
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,910
My muscle memory is gone.

1586
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:09,770
Okay.

1587
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,370

No, you did not!

1600
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,150
That's a Tesla!

Yeah, that's what the fucking testicles say.

That's right, what are you gonna do about it, huh?

1609
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,830
You don't have cool names like us, the Eddies.

1610
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:28,790
That's looking right.

1611
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:31,110
Trying to steal our Oshimark 2?

1612
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:34,430
We all know Edison invented the light bulb.

1613
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,390
Get your own Oshimark.

1614
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:43,290
