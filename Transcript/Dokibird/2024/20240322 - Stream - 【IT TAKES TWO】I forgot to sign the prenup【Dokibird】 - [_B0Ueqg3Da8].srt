And now her stomach hurts because she ate too many
artichokes.

9
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,950
She ate too many artichokes.

10
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,410
Two artichokes.

11
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:35,610

12
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:48,610

16
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:24,570

about whether or not vegetables are considered food and

17
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:38,990
sorry for all the vegetarians and vegans out there I'm
telling you artichoke is do you know what a garnish or a

18
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:46,510
dressing is yes I know what it is but like artichoke is like
it's just artichoke you know it's just an artichoke.

19
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:53,390
You tell me, you tell me what your definition of a garnish
and or a dressing is.

20
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,870
It's like a side thing.

21
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,370
Like, you know, you put it on top of real food.

22
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,090
You're pissing me off.

23
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,050
What do you mean?

24
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,090
A side thing.

25
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,750
You don't just eat artichoke.

26
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,630
You don't just order.

27
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,270
Okay, do you go to a restaurant and just order one
artichoke?

28
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,730
Like, yes, you can get...

29
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:09,730
Sometimes?

30
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,930
You really?

31
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,390
Yeah, is it a main dish or a side dish?

32
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,670
But hold on, I got my artichokes from Costco and they're
really big.

33
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,110
That's not a restaurant!

34
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,070
What are you saying?

35
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,450
That's not a restaurant!

36
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,070
You're like, I was like, do you go to a restaurant and
like...

37
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,650
I said yes!

38
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,970
I said yes!

39
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,410
I said yes!

40
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,450
Then you went, I go to Costco.

41
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,250
I was telling you that I went to Costco and got these Really
big artichokes.

42
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,070
That's why it's not just a side dish to me.

43
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,010
Yeah, but you chop off the big artichoke and then make it
into small things.

44
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,930
So you can just have... You don't just eat an artichoke as a
main dish.

45
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,150
We just don't.

46
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,870
What do you mean chop up the artichoke?

47
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,310
Do you know how to eat an artichoke?

48
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,270
Yeah, you chop... I literally saw you.

49
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,810
You were like live streaming yourself chopping artichokes
for me.

50
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,290
What the fuck do you mean?

51
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,850
You have to cut the top of the leaf.

52
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:29,930
off it's it's an artichoke you can't just eat an artichoke
you can't it's it's impossible what do you mean it's

53
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:40,190
impossible by the way I never got your what do you mean are
you just too busy chopping I hate chopping artichokes okay

54
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:47,590
let me invite you again I invited you I'm I'm still not
getting it.

55
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,390
Wait, what?

56
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,450
Is it because I didn't click play on mine phrase?

57
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,130
Yeah, thank you.

58
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,550

60
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,910
Wait, no, that's not right.

61
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,950
Okay.

62
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,530
You got it?

63
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,790
Nope.

64
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,530
My sound guy was like, Gumi's volume is good despite her
passion for art.

65
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,510
I need to talk to your sound guy.

66
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,910
Adam did a great chat.

67
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,810
All right, I'm gonna make a poll.

68
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,310
I'm gonna make a poll.

69
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,490
I'm gonna make a poll

70
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,470
Is artichokes are artichokes a mini dish?

71
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:38,250
Guys, I need you guys to actually vote with your heart and
don't vote because you you want to fuck with me What do you

72
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,850

73
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:47,770
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I need
to vote with their heart like like would you eat with my

74
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:47,870
heart?

75
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:56,790
Would you eat a artichoke as your main dish like okay
Vegetarians don't just eat artichokes they eat salads.

76
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,890
They can have salads and like other shit They don't just be
like halo stare.

77
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,730
I would just want an artichoke.

78
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:12,810
They don't say that They don't say I might not be a
vegetarian, but I won't be like hello Can I just have an

79
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,250
artichoke for dinner?

80
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:25,130
Like I would not say that it is like a side and an appetizer
exactly look 70% people agree with me that it's not a me I

81
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:35,830
never said it was a main dish this was our entire argument
this was our entire argument I was like do you see the art

82
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:43,590
show and you know what's that you called it a dressing or
garnish no you're dressing dressing garnish side I said it

83
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,290
can't be all three it cannot be all three no I said dressing
garnish or side and And you were like, you were like, no,

84
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,790
it's I ate, I just eat the artichoke.

85
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,810
It's like, that is not that.

86
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,570
You can't do that.

87
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,630
You can't just eat an artichoke as a main dish.

88
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,170
Also, I sent you another invite.

89
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,770
I can do that.

90
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,350
I can do that.

91
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,950
I just, I just sent you another invite.

92
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,410
I'm not getting it.

93
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,710
Then you are what's wrong with this.

94
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,260
I said it was my main dish.

95
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,860
Not everyone's main dish.

96
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,280
But my main dish.

97
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,600
So you're a freak then.

98
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,980
But do you know what?

99
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,400
I'll even send you a photo of my artichoke from last night.

100
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,820
I was...

101
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,800
I was...

102
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,000
I was...

103
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,680
I was eating that shit.

104
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,480
I was eating that shit.

105
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,680
You're like, oh, I think I got my tummy hurt because it was
from the artichoke.

106
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,240
Yeah?

107
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,920
Yeah, I said that.

108
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,580
Who else?

109
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:35,780
What?

110
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,980
No, it's because I ate two artichokes yesterday.

111
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,940
Oh my god, I hold two.

112
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,960
I wonder...

113
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,780
You can't just get a stomach ache because you...

114
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,820
Oh my god.

115
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,680
It's like, yeah, I had two eggs today.

116
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,220
That's why my tummy hurt.

117
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,160
Like, what?

118
00:12:51,680 --> 00:13:03,220
logic what is that logic no I'm saying this because of the
fiber the fiber it's gonna make me need a

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,290
Go ahead, I don't care.

122
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,730
And I was like, what the fuck is this?

123
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,270
What the fuck is this giant ass artichoke?

124
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,330
What kind of, what the fuck, were they grown in a lab or
some shit?

125
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,170
What is this fucking artichoke that I'm looking at?

126
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,490
Alright guys, I'm gonna try not to show Gumi's thighs as
well.

127
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:58,410
Dude, I had to take the photo like that because my kids
keeper was messed up whoops accidentally i accidentally okay

128
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:06,930
i sized myself bigger just for comparison with the artichoke
which it was sort of an accident but what do you mean by

129
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:14,750
comparison like look oh my god that's a john ass artichoke
no wonder your tummy hurt

130
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:28,670
holy fuck also give me a sec guys i need to resize myself

131
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:46,610

fuck is that look if people in my chat are like what the

132
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,790
fuck is that

133
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,570
saying those are giant artichokes this is true and that's
why it was a main dish to me because it was so huge.

134
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,830
But don't why don't you just cut it up?

135
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,390
Cut it up.

136
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,310
It doesn't change the way you eat it.

137
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,010
Someone was like that thing belongs to the wilderness, not
the table.

138
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:23,490
That looks like a dead space baby genetically modified
artichoke.

139
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,950
No, do you know what?

140
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,350
You're right?

141
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,950
Because they are fucking huge.

142
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,610
And my mom bought me them because she's like, look how big
these artichokes are.

143
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,950
And I know you love artichokes.

144
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,250
I was like, you're supposed to take it apart.

145
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,510
What the fuck?

146
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,130
Well, you're not even eating artichokes, right?

147
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,530
No, you haven't.

148
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,610
That's what I've been saying.

149
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,690
Because you called it...

150
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,590
Garnish, dude.

151
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,230
Garnish is like putting like tiny parsley on top.

152
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,330
Well, like, yeah, I mean, you can still put that on top.

153
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,810
It's just gonna be the whole thing.

154
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,610
Bro, accept my fucking input.

155
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,930
I said you were like three.

156
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,650
I'm telling you, it's not working.

157
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,950
We start your game.

158
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:12,890
I did.

159
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,150
Oh, wait, no, I didn't.

160
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,810
I know you did it because you were too busy talking about my
artichoke.

161
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,170
Look, it's not.

162
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,290
Look that.

163
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,130
It was important.

164
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,410
It was a very important conversation.

165
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,590
You wouldn't understand.

166
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,430
You're out here fucking stuffing yourself in artichokes.

167
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,910
Can we talk about our wording?

168
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,850

No, that's just an achievement.

292
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,760
Now we can't get over.

293
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,060

00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,420

308
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,980

328
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,040
What do we do?

329
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,180

338
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,540
That's not a mouse.

339
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,580
That's a dog.

340
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,180

355
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,820
Oh, my god, you're pro- Wait, wait, I said you- Why did you
do that?

356
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,240
I am against screen peeking.

357
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,280
Oh, yeah, now you're against screen peeking.

358
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,520
Yeah, now you are.

359
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,240
What happened?

360
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,500
I need you to tell me what next.

361
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,080
Dog.

362
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:41,060
Lion, lion, lion, lion, lion Lion, lion Sheep Sheep Ba Frog

363
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,680

364
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,080
It's a cute egg

365
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah, my beautiful wife.

366
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,480
Hello.

367
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,460
What took you so long?

368
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
My beautiful wife.

369
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,680
Who I love very much.

370
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,320
I fucking hate my husband.

371
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,260
Whoa!

372
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,880
I worked so hard to put food on the table.

373
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,460
And that's what you say?

374
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,580
I'm the engineer, so...

375
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,580
Yeah, and I'm a farmer.

376
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,960
It looks like we have to solve it.

377
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,980
What's the other night?

378
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,720
This will be easy.

379
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,660
Wait, 6 plus 5?

380
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,460
6.

381
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
Oh, 6 plus 3.

382
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,240
Yeah.

383
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,300
See?

384
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,200
Simple.

385
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,060
Quick maths.

386
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,240
Yay.

387
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,640
Get off of 6, you wish.

388
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,440
6 plus 1 makes 16.

389
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,700
You need to move on 8!

390
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,600
6 plus 1 is to make 16.

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,240
6 plus 1!

392
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,580
Get on 8!

393
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,120
Well, this is embarrassing.

394
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,260
You suck at math.

395
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,660
6 and 1.

396
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:58,920
What?

397
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,600

398
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,680

That's my drink.

401
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,660
It's two.

402
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,600
Okay, I'll go here now.

403
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,360
We can be six together.

404
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,120
You said this would be easy, man.

405
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
You're pissing me.

406
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,980
Get on three right now.

407
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,900
Okay.

408
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,680
Where do I go?

409
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,800
Oh, I got six!

410
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,440
Yeah!

411
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,460
Oh, what's this?

412
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,960
A memory.

413
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,760
Remember!

414
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,100
Okay, there's two cherries here.

415
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,780
Okay, now they're not there anymore.

416
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,040
They're not there.

417
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,460
Orange.

418
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,980
Oh, strawberry.

419
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,220
I already forgot half of these.

420
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,600
Oh, strawberry!

421
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,280
Here!

422
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,120
And then... Banana!

423
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,700
Cherry's a...

424
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,280
Oh, here, here, here!

425
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,000
No!

426
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,480
I actually... No!

427
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,780
Okay, that wasn't a cherry.

428
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
Where is the egg plant?

429
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,560
Cherry!

430
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,960
Okay, we had two.

431
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,960
No, that's the egg plant.

432
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,740
Oh, thank God I was actually wearing the orange one.

433
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,540
Oh, more math.

434
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,160
That's not math.

435
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,020
It's numbers.

436
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,460
Oh, I can do that.

437
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,020
Wait, do you have...

438
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,360
Can it just be you moving?

439
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,160
Push it!

440
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,900
Push it!

441
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,880
Oh, I go up.

442
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,780
I go up.

443
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,160
And then you go...

444
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,840
It's this way.

445
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,220
It's right.

446
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,700
It's right.

447
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,060
And then 7 is up.

448
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,680
What do you mean it's right?

449
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
I'm literally going right.

450
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,560
It's up.

451
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,320
It's down.

452
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,080
Okay.

453
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,180
Whoa.

454
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,580
Why are you going to 11?

455
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,140
What do you mean?

456
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,940
I'm trying to...

457
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm trying to.

458
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,980
to navigate, woman.

459
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,700
Try to do what, woman?

460
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,260
Alright, 60.

461
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,900
Hey, it's right inside.

462
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,660
What are you doing?

463
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm literally going right.

464
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,540
No, you're not.

465
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,980
No, you're not.

466
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,320
I feel the resistance.

467
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,920
Wait, where's the 20?

468
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,920
Is it above me?

469
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,020
Oh, where the fuck did the 20 go?

470
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,880
Where was the 20?

471
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,760
Right here.

472
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh, that's how that was the 26.

473
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,100
26.

474
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,320
That looked like a 26.

475
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,340
I couldn't tell.

476
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,620
Okay, you can move.

477
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,220
All right.

478
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,040
I thought that was a 26.

479
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,480
The zero was like, was like scratched off.

480
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Okay.

481
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,020
10, 11, 12.

482
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,340
This is like, this does not look great.

483
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,340
weekend ugly.

484
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,240
That's your fault.

485
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,880
Why is it my fault?

486
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,740
It takes two to tangle.

487
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,680
Wow, how did we fuck that up?

488
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,380
You're taking too long.

489
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
You're taking too long.

490
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,180
How?

491
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,200
It took too long.

492
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,260
I am really moving so fucking fast.

493
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,920
Alright, alright.

494
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,500
I am going so fast.

495
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm pushing the crosshair.

496
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,700
Okay, here we go.

Why?

See!

540
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,890
That's not even us!

541
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,690
That's not even us!

542
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,560
That's not!

543
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,540
That's not even me!

544
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,540
That is not even me!

545
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,000
Xbox, Google How to do?

546
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh!

547
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:23,880
Oh!

548
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,100
It's not even me.

549
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,100
I swear I swear to God.

550
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,180
It's not even me.

551
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Help.

552
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Help.

553
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:41,580
Help.

554
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm all the way on the side now.

555
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Help.

556
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,660
How we stuck on this one of all fucking problems.

557
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,040
Change your mouse DPI.

558
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,360
What do you mean?

559
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,320
My fucking DPI is high enough!

560
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,660
Okay, let's see.

561
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,440
Change into options.

562
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,540
Change into the options.

563
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,460
Okay, which one?

564
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,260
Which one?

565
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,180
Which one?

566
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,140
Am I Cody?

567
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm Cody, right?

568
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,560
You're Cody.

569
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah, okay.

570
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,300
Horizontal.

571
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,100
Wait, which one?

572
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,500
Do I change it to... Okay, I'm changing this to...

573
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,080
It's not me!

574
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,640
I swear to God!

575
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,200
Oh, wait.

576
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,640
Back.

577
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,740
Okay.

578
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,580
Okay, I'm ready.

579
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,620
Okay, we should restart this, though.

580
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,520
We should restart it because I was drawing a line.

581
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,220
Look, see?

582
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,280
Look at us.

583
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,860
Look at us go.

584
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,120
Look at us go.

585
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,160
Alright, here we go.

586
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Oh, it's very smooth.

587
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:49,680
Uh-huh.

588
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,340
How the fuck did we progress to 6 out of 16?

589
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,660
I don't understand how we did that Maybe we go left Maybe we
go left instead of up

590
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:19,060
Okay And then Oh my god we do we have to go left Oh my god

591
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:30,840

What the fuck is this stupid drawing?

592
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,160
It's a cat?

593
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,420
How the fuck did it make a cat?

594
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,500
That's one ugly ass cat.

595
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,200
What the fuck?

596
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:37,780
Yeah.

597
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,880
How the fuck did we make a cat?

598
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,420
Look

599
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,230
at the mouse.

600
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,910
Oh, that's us.

601
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,850
Oh, these games.

602
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,230
I had one of these as a kid.

603
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,210
Mousetrap?

604
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,950
No, like the, the, oh my god, it's way too high now.

605
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,290
The sensitivity, give me a sec.

606
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,110
I'm going back down next time.

607
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:12,350
like back down this is way too high okay nice all right i'm
good tell me we have to play with every toy how do we do

mouse out wait we do like here How?

610
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,150
I don't think we let it out now.

611
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,810
I think we have to do these first.

612
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,110
Like the ones in front of us first.

613
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,990
We have to do this because there's an objective point here.

614
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,110
Am I green or blue?

615
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:46,950
You're green.

616
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,150
Oh, I'm green.

617
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:49,590
Alright.

618
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,770
How do we do this?

619
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,470
Oh, we had to stand on there.

620
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,070
We had to stand.

621
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,930
Yeah, and then we go up.

622
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,210
Oh my god, we're doing it.

623
00:35:59,310 --> 00:35:59,790
We're doing it.

624
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,070
We're working together as a couple.

625
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,730
Our divorce is not a mess.

626
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,630
Our marriage is salvageable.

627
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,170
Barely.

628
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,170
Hey, hey, that's...

629
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,930
There's still hope.

630
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,850
That means there's still hope.

631
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:20,790
Yay!

632
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,330
See?

633
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,990
We can fix our marriage.

634
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,390
Look at us go.

635
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,510
Even if it's not fixable, it wasn't my fault that this
marriage died.

636
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,270
What?

637
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:56,380
I'm just saying I think I was the better parent Yeah, okay
No That could have been a child What What if that ball right

638
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:06,760

care of it I'm not doing it already out there.

639
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,480
I know it's all about control, man.

640
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,240
I did it.

641
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,300
Yay.

642
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,500
Where is the ball?

643
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,600
Where the fuck is the ball?

644
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,760
Oh, there it is.

645
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,480
Okay, now we push the thing.

646
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,310
Here, go, go, get the cheese.

647
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,050
There's the cheese, mousy.

648
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,370
There it is.

649
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,830
Are you happy now?

650
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,270
Oh, that's torture.

651
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,690
You see?

652
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,290
Told you the mice are friendly.

653
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,910
That's actually torture.

654
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,030
What's this?

655
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:46,590
Oh!

656
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,830
What the heck?

657
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,150
Just move up.

658
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,970
And then, we have to make sure we jump fast enough.

659
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,710
But that's okay, because we're gamers.

660
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,730
Ow.

661
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,110
Wait up!

662
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,950
Wait up!

663
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,290
It's okay, we did it.

664
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,810
We're gamers.

665
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,310
All right, I'm holding it.

666
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,270
What do we do here?

667
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,590
Can we just jump on it?

668
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,130
Where do we go?

669
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,750
There's a rope thingy up there.

670
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:28,390
There is?

671
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,250
How do we get up there?

672
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,850
Wait, am I not supposed to wall jump?

673
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,490
I don't know.

674
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,370
Are we?

675
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,590
Oh!

676
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,390
Wait, what happened?

677
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,570
How do... How?

678
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,490
I'm so confused.

679
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,730
Okay, I'm coming back.

680
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,870
Let's...

681
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:52,770
You're...

682
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,510
Oh, like, how do we, like...

683
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,890
Because, like, I can't do that, though.

684
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,550
Oh!

685
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,790
It's the side!

686
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:04,710
It's the side!

687
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,430
Yeah.

688
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,210
It's the side!

689
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,230
Yeah.

690
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,850
That's why I'm the gamer.

691
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,310
Yeah.

692
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,150
I figured it out.

693
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,530
I literally did that earlier.

694
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,150
I figured it out.

695
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,410
I did it.

696
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:24,550
Okay.

697
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,470
I did it.

698
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,950
Oh my god.

699
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,810
I'm a genius husband.

700
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,970
Any women would be lucky to have me.

701
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,550
What?

702
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,090
What?

703
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,550
Really?

704
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,710
What is this?

705
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,570
Oh, it's the whoopee cushion.

706
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,630
Other one, other one, other one, other one.

707
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:53,590
Alright.

708
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,490
Yay!

709
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,310
And then...

710
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,870
I pumped it.

711
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:58,830
Wait, then what?

712
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,210
What are you doing?

713
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,030
Oh, okay.

714
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,130
I pumped it.

715
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,930
I pumped it.

716
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,010
I think you're supposed to land the other one.

717
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,350
Yeah.

718
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,230
I think you're supposed to...

719
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,390
Here, and then...

720
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,770
There, and then- Oh, what?

721
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,410
Upies!

722
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:16,490
Upies!

723
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,050
Didn't you land on there?

724
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:20,950
Okay.

725
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,310
Wait, what?

726
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,270
Can you not get there?

727
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,830
Wait, do you have to launch that one?

728
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,910
I don't know.

729
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,870
What was that for?

730
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:33,890
What?

731
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,090
Oh!

732
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,430
Do we both have to?

733
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,250
Huh?

734
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,830
I don't think it's possible.

735
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,370
It says pull my finger, though.

736
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,330
Oh, like, what does that mean?

737
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,610
I'm letting you go up?

738
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,830
Oh, we both need to be on it.

739
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:49,930
And what?

740
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,650
How did you...

741
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:51,870
What?

742
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,970
How do I get there?

743
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,830
I can't get there.

744
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,170
Smash in and run over?

745
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,810
No, because there's a timer.

746
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,250
Oh, maybe?

747
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,110
Oh, maybe.

748
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:04,950
No?

749
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:05,890
Let's see.

750
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,910
Yeah, no, there's no...

751
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,630
There's, like, a delay.

752
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,210
Oh.

753
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,390
Yeah, there's a delay.

You'll see it And then you hang in there and then there's a
hook that shows up.

759
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:55,170
I see it now Wait, see that hook?

760
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,450
There's a hook right there.

761
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,190
No, I knew about the hook.

762
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,590
I tried to go for it earlier Yeah, but I think you're
supposed to drop down.

763
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,130
Wait, why do you keep- why do you- I didn't drop down?

764
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,240
We figured it out together I

765
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,800
Yay!

766
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,190
We did it together!

767
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,500
Because we are a lovely couple who's going through a rough
path.

768
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,800
Get on the dog.

769
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,280
Yeah, I'm where?

770
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,280
Oh!

771
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,720
There you go.

772
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,940
I'm on it.

773
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,100
Yay!

774
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,700
I pulled the thing.

775
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,680
Okay, I'm gonna head over.

776
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,800
Jumping in.

777
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,360
Alright, I'm on it.

778
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,140
We're a lovely couple.

779
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,040
I know.

780
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,240
I know.

781
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,540
Everybody thinks so.

782
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,840
We think we're made for each other.

783
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,020
God, I hope they never say that again.

784
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,620
We just have some little differences.

785
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,420
Look, that's why...

786
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,460
We should go to, like, therapy instead.

787
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,800
You know, instead of that.

788
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,740
We should go to couples counseling.

789
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,520
Reddit.

790
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,600
Am I the asshole?

791
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,520
I hate my wife.

792
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,600
But it's her fault.

793
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

794
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,120
What's that?

795
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,140
Air dash.

796
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,840
What the fuck does that mean?

797
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,500
We just...

798
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Where's the prize?

799
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,140
Give me something useful.

800
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,100
Just keep doing it?

801
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,320
Maybe we have to keep doing it.

802
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,580
What's this?

803
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,580
Air dash again.

804
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,320
That's it?

805
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,980
It has to be more, right?

806
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,900
Is that really it?

807
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,060
That's crotch.

808
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,580
That's crotch.

809
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,520
Oh my god, Dwan!

810
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,120
Is that crotch?

811
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,260
Oh, crotch!

812
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,040
I thought this is crotch.

813
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,220
I was like, what the fuck is crotch?

814
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:04,860
Yay!

815
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,380
Wait, we can swim?

816
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,740
What does this do?

817
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,520
Oh, we can swim!

818
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,380
Yay!

819
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,280
Oh!

820
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,600
swim.

821
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,660
Don't swim.

822
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:19,840
Don't swim.

823
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,260
I drank this pipe all the way.

824
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,640
I don't know what it did, though.

825
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,240
Don't swim.

826
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,880
Swimming was always a mistake.

827
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,640
Why did those balls fall?

828
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,080
No, the balls were always there.

829
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,560
Oh, wait to do this other one.

830
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,900
There's one over here.

831
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,640
I got it.

832
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,060
I'm pulling the lever.

833
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,340
Am I pulling it the right way?

834
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,100
It's spinning so it should be the right way.

835
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,800
Oh, there it is.

836
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:46,760
Okay.

837
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,760
Teamwork.

838
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,380
Yay.

839
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,440
All right.

840
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,580
So we're going to go to couples counseling to fix our
issues.

841
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,820
Oh my god, look.

842
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,960
Oh, it's an Etch-a-Sketch.

843
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
I used to own one of these.

844
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:03,640
Me too.

845
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,320
What are we trying to draw?

846
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,620
Yeah, but what about creativity being stifled and all that?

847
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,680
Just can't do much with two knives.

848
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,240
I don't know, but I think we just made like a Marvel logo.

849
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,080
Now we just made Texas or something.

850
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,320
It's beautiful.

851
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,680
What the fuck are you making?

852
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,380
It looks like Stonehenge.

853
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,180
I stopped touching the thing.

854
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,800
Wait, was that it?

855
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,560
It wasn't like an actual game?

856
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,700
Wait, we can make...

857
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,200
Shut up!

858
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,700
I was gonna say!

859
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,720
What was I gonna say?

860
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,600
I don't know.

861
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,040
I just wanted to...

862
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,320
What was I gonna say?

863
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,660
I couldn't even think I was gonna say something.

864
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,460
What was it?

865
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,320
Oh, I'm gonna put the last coin in.

866
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,600
Wait, I'm doing the teeth.

867
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,920
Oh my god!

868
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,520
Yay!

869
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,680
Oh, it's so cute!

870
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,000
Oh, come over here.

871
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,460
You're so hot.

872
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,580
But I smashed this.

873
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,220
I did five and I was okay.

874
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,120
It's your turn.

875
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,660
Okay.

876
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,360
Your turn.

877
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,220
Nice.

878
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,900
What is this?

879
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,700
I was like a little bar kid is like 10 or some shit.

880
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,380
She should not be reading this.

881
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,280
Dude, I think these were her old toys.

882
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,380
Oh my god, game, game, game, game.

883
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,740
Oh, what's this?

884
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,500
It's a bat time?

885
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,160
Swing a bat.

886
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,260
This will be a piece of cake.

887
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Let me do this.

888
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:58,170
Oh.

889
00:46:59,930 --> 00:46:59,990
Oh.

890
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,850
It took my ball forever to get back.

891
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,370
You just didn't hit it hard enough.

892
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,610
Oh god.

893
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,870
I'm missing now.

894
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,370
Please.

895
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,470
Look at that.

896
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,690
I'm going so fast.

897
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,750
Oh.

898
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,610
It's because like if you...

899
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:13,830
No!

900
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,470
Fuck!

901
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,390
No, no, no, no, no.

902
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,050
It's because if you miss, if you miss, it goes slower.

903
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,010
So you have to like have it.

904
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,350
a heavy rhythm.

905
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,830
Because the more you go, the faster you are.

906
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,310
I keep sending it backwards.

907
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,550
You hit it at the right angle.

908
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,590
It's alright.

909
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,130
That's why I'm mansplaining.

910
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,170
Oh, thank you, husband.

911
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,950
Oh, husband, we can't afford rent.

912
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,790
You keep buying too many battle pass.

913
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,230
I did it, wife.

914
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,990
Are you proud of me?

915
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,270
Husband, please stop buying battle pass.

916
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,690
We can't afford Didn't know.

917
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,610
But I gotta get my John Cena.

918
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,850
You wouldn't understand.

919
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,410
You wouldn't understand.

920
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,770
You wouldn't understand me.

921
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:04,450
Husband, please.

922
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:06,430
Okay.

923
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,550
But what about...

924
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,690
Who the fuck we bought fidget spinners?

925
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,850
Your baby ain't hurt too much.

926
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,430
I only spin, you know.

927
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,110
In the real world, yes.

928
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:19,530
Oh.

929
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:20,570
Whoa.

930
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,510
You're not a- Yeah, that's right.

931
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,730
Gumi's not a gamer if she's trying to restrict my Fortnite
passes.

932
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,330
I spent- we need to eat.

933
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:32,430
Whoa!

934
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,030
We could eat or...

935
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:37,650
Or...

936
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,170
Or we could have the John Cena skin.

937
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:43,670
Ooh!

938
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,170
Wait, what?

939
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,850
I landed on the...

940
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,710
Where do I have to go?

941
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,470
Oh, over there.

942
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:53,810
Okay.

943
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,370
Where else would we go?

944
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,490
I don't know!

945
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:58,970
Oh!

946
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,670
What?!

947
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,910
Okay.

948
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,210
That was weird.

949
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,530
Alright, I got it.

950
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,210
Woohoo!

951
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:07,790
I'm twisting the knob.

952
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,010
That's my special move.

953
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:12,310
What?

954
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:13,910
What?

955
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,210
Spin it away, baby!

956
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,570
Why did you use that?

957
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,250
What are they twisting us to?

958
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,210
Why did you ewe that?

959
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,370
I don't know, actually.

960
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,290
What did it do?

961
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,730
Where does that open up?

962
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,570
Oh, it's over to the- Oh, isn't it here?

963
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,890
There's a- it's over here.

964
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,150
Oh yeah, do that one.

965
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,470
Yeah, there's one here.

966
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,590
All right, twisting the knob.

967
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:40,910
Your favorite move.

968
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,650
I'm gonna need you to stop talking once and for all.

969
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,610
I don't understand!

970
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,970
What did I say?

971
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,510
What the fuck did I say?

972
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,150
Testing these knobs should turn this pipe off.

973
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,870
Well, we have to find a yellow pipe.

974
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,430
Oh, I found it.

975
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,230
It's over behind us.

976
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,530
We already did the yellow pipe.

977
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:07,790
No, it didn't.

978
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,890
We did the purple pipe.

979
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,510
There's a yellow pipe right here.

980
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:11,990
There, I got you.

981
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,990
What was the purple pipe for then?

982
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:14,850
I don't know.

983
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,250
I mean, free up the one...

984
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,190
It's free up the red.

985
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,570
Oh, I see.

986
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,750
Nice, okay.

987
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,030
Then we head over there.

988
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,090
Oh my god, Doki Carry!

989
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:29,750
I know!

990
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,150
I'm carrying!

991
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,690
I need a break from last week.

992
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:35,090
What?

993
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:35,770
What?

994
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,690
Let's go to the beach, beach!

995
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:40,810
Yay!

996
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,170
Jaja!

997
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,530
We bought our daughter a bouncy castle?

998
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:47,890
You didn't get one?

999
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,330
We bought her a bouncy... Is this why we're having money
issues?

1000
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:58,690
Hey, I make the money, you're the one that's in charge of
home and you've been spending it.

1001
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,710
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1002
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,730
There's no way I bought this for her.

1003
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,590
I'm too busy fucking farming.

1004
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,070
How the fuck?

1005
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,710
It can't be, I think it has to be you.

1006
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,730
You're trying to compensate for your lack of...

1007
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,070
Like what?

1008
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,350
Lack of presents in our daughter's life.

1009
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:22,310
You're trying to, so, you're trying way too hard to
compensate for this.

1010
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,110
Yeah, okay, bud.

1011
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:33,790
You're like, you're like the one where you're like at work
like 20 hours over the 24 hours, and then you come home with

1012
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,090
like a bouncy castle.

1013
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,850
Wait, I had a bouncy castle when I was a kid.

1014
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,170
Okay, don't think too hard about that.

1015
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,830
Don't think too hard about that.

1016
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,630
You mean it?

1017
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,610
I'm just talking about this game.

1018
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,950
It's not related to anything in real life.

1019
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,210
It's just...

1020
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,870
It's just about...

1021
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:59,750
It's just this game.

1022
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,670
I'm just talking about a hypothetical in this game.

1023
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,490
You mean it, really?

1024
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1025
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,110
Wait, how do I...

1026
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:09,290
Hello?

1027
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,690
Oh, I have to smash it.

1028
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,400
Yay!

1029
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,480
I hate this guy.

1030
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,000
Me too.

1031
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,320
Oh, no!

1032
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,980
Oh, here we go again.

1033
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,540
My plan is working!

1034
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,660
You like each other.

1035
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,060
This guy fucking sucks.

1036
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,280
There are more things to learn and new challenges to
overcome.

1037
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,940
Let's keep on going.

1038
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,080
We got a relationship to fix.

1039
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,940
Woohoo!

1040
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,580
What the hell?

1041
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,740
Oh god, that's trippy.

1042
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh, I don't like this.

1043
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,360
I don't like that.

1044
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:49,680
Oh.

1045
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,440
Hello, kaleidoscopes.

1046
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,240
Oh, this is... Oh!

1047
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,660
I don't like this!

1048
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,620
Oh my god!

1049
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,860
This is way too fucking trippy.

1050
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,640
This is actually way too uncomfortable.

1051
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,260
That would suck actually.

1052
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,910
Dude, how the fuck...

1053
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,980
How long does this go for?

1054
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:20,920
Alright.

1055
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,180
Here we go.

1056
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,280
Is it like... Oh, does it... Maybe if I... Okay, no, don't
jump off.

1057
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,580
Don't jump off.

1058
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,200
Oh, no.

1059
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600
What?

1060
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,040
Not that.

1061
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,880
We have to...

1062
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,440
What do I have to do?

1063
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,740
Oh wait, stand over there.

1064
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:46,680
Where?

1065
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:47,660
Here?

1066
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,800
Try and connect it.

1067
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,800
Yeah, no, one more.

1068
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:50,960
Oh!

1069
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:51,780
Oh!

1070
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,360
Oh god, this is why you're the engineer.

1071
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,860
Stand here, where I'm standing.

1072
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:00,780
Okay.

1073
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:14,340
Oh my god, double rainbow.

1074
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:18,840
What the fuck is that?

1075
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,360
That's us.

1076
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,340
Oh my god, double.

1077
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,680
Is that good?

1078
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,640
that there's two of us?

1079
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,440
No.

1080
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,100
Wait?

1081
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,680
I thought tower.

1082
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,140
Where are you supposed to make?

1083
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,600
Go up top right.

1084
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:38,890
I did it.

1085
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,370
We did it!

1086
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,070
Yeah.

1087
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,190
And then...

1088
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,770
Whoa.

1089
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,750
Does that mean there's gonna be four of us?

1090
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,230
I don't know.

1091
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,610
My stomach hurt.

1092
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:52,470
Why?

1093
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,010
Is it because of the artichokes?

1094
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:54,970
Too much fiber.

1095

So I'm just happy I don't have to think about it anymore.

1178
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,460
Oh yeah, Gumi tried to get me to play TFT.

01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:09,340
Gumi, I can't even, I only played one game of TFT And like,
there's no way I'm gonna play TFT because the whole thing

1187
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,600
about TFT is reading

1188
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:18,820
I was like, there's no way you're gonna get me to play TFT.

1189
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,860
I'm not gonna fucking read

1190
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:33,320
almost a team fortress tactics team fight tactics right is
that what it means i don't have the brain capacity for that

1191
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:47,400
all i do is just i i exist i hate it by one weakness reading
i don't have the brain power i bet there's more what is

1192
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,000
she's kissing is she kissing the mailman

1193
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,580
We're trying to kiss.

1194
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,300
We're trying to kiss the mailman?

1195
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1196
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:03,580
Chew.

1197
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,440
Oh my god.

1198
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,580
We can't get going with this barrier in the way.

1199
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,620
She's gonna kiss the mailman.

1200
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,640
How could she?

1201
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,500
In front of him?

1202
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,660
Right in front of him?

1203
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,160
Just like that?

1204
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,260
All right.

1205
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,240
Now we just need someone to work the gate.

1206
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,160
There you go.

1207
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,880
Doki, I went to go get Tom.

1208
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,660
I did it!

1209
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,860
Gumi!

1210
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,700
Yeah, I've glistened the entire time.

1211
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,200
I solved the puzzle!

1212
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,100
Really?

1213
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:35,820
Yeah!

1214
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,620
Now give me a kiss for a good job.

1215
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,480
Well done.

1216
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,140
Wow, that was so hot.

1217
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,300
Oh my god, you're gonna get me excited.

1218
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,560
Why am I pee-pee hard?

1219
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,620
I want to go get some tombs because I hit them for myself.

1220
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,280
Why did you hide it?

1221
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,960
Because I have a tombs addiction.

1222
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,060
I think they're really yummy.

1223
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,620
What is he, tombs?

1224
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:06,640
It...

1225
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,880
You don't know what...

1226
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,220
Why?

1227
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,440
I don't know what tombs is.

1228
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,880
It's an antacid.

1229
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:11,420
Oh!

1230
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:13,500
Wait.

1231
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:19,780
We're not, like, fuck your stomach up because you're eating
it out of pure enjoyment and not for...

1232
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,720
Yeah, no, you're only supposed to have seven maximum per
day.

1233
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:33,140
and how much how many do you have well you should eat seven
per day oh that is whoa that is not good oh look the

1234
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:44,460
dinosaurs i've never had times for myself because out of
sight out of mind oh what happened to you straight to the

1235
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:52,880
castle root i didn't put the dinosaur there whatever let's
just find a way to clear the track what how i think i've

1236
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,840
ever had tums i just like, if I tell me you hurt, I just
suffer.

1237
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,700
It only makes you stronger.

1238
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:05,100
When I drink because it helps with the acid from drinking.

1239
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,780
Oh, yeah, I don't drink a lot of me, that's why.

1240
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,840
What do we do here?

1241
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:10,700
What?

1242
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,860
I remember the last time we drank together.

1243
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,520
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

1244
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,860
I don't know if you remember, but that was a long time ago.

1245
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,780
Wait, what's this?

1246
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,000
You take the red one on the platform.

1247
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,000
Oh, there's a red one.

1248
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,360
Where?

1249
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:29,960
They were there.

1250
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,180
I just let him go.

1251
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,240
Oh.

1252
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,140
There you go.

1253
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:33,880
There's the stegosaurus.

1254
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,900
Did you know that brontosaurus is not a real dinosaur?

1255
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,060
What is it then?

1256
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:48,260
Like, apparently back then when they made the stegosaurus,
they, like, they, like, just pieced together random dinosaur

1257
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:48,740
bones.

1258
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,200
And then they're like, this is a brontosaurus.

1259
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:53,380
Hey.

1260
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,120
Oh, that's not Stagastores.

1261
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,000
That's a...

1262
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,920
That's a...

1263
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,660
That's a...

1264
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,540
I don't know what the fuck that is.

1265
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:01,700
What?

1266
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,660
I don't know what it's called.

1267
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,540

1310
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,620

01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:33,560
All right.

01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,160

1329
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:37,460

01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,900
I'm grabbing onto it.

1331
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:42,640
Okay.

1332
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,740
I already did it.

1333
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,060

1334
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,100

1335
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,580
Don't worry.

1336
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,280
I'm here.

1337
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,600
Look how cute this one is.

1338
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,900
The hero is here.

1339
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:57,300
Yeah, but do you have my size?

1340
01:07:58,860 --> 01:07:59,960
Size isn't what matters, man.

1341
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,120
You taught me that.

1342
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,200
It's the blood.

1343
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,000
Wait, wait a minute.

1344
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,780
What do you mean I taught you that?

1345
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,000
Look at him.

1346
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,700
Oh, he helped me!

1347
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,640
Oh, that's not my fault.

1348
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,420
Right over there.

1349
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,260
They totally saw that coming.

1350
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,520
Okay, don't worry.

1351
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,040
I got you.

1352
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,160
Look at that.

1353
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,040
My guy is still alive.

1354
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,670
If your guy wasn't so small, he'd be alive.

1355
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,390
What the fuck?

1356
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,290
How did you miss?

1357
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,730
Because I didn't think you would bring it that far.

1358
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,350
I thought you would wait for me to land on it.

1359
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,230
I didn't mean that you would bring it to the side.

1360
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:45,410
I don't know.

1361
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,410
You should know by...

1362
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:47,210
You're married to me.

1363
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,210
You should know by now how I play this game.

1364
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,670
Oh, now you don't trust me.

1365
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,950
Okay, I got you.

1366
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,230
Wait, what am I pulling up?

1367
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:06,550
Why am I pulling up, though?

1368
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,740
What is this?

1369
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,920
Making a second, watch him.

1370
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:13,900
Oh!

1371
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,500
Okay.

1372
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:18,720
Oh!

1373
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,060
Okay, I got it.

1374
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,080
I figured it out.

1375
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:24,440
Yay!

1376
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,040
Thank you.

1377
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,360
Thank you.

1378
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,440
Do not worry.

1379
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,320
I was afraid to call you a hero.

1380
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,260
Your hero is here.

1381
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,360
Oh my god, we gave him a concussion!

1382
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,280
We're monsters!

1383
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,300
No, that was fucked up.

1384
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,500
We're monsters!

1385
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,180
Ew.

1386
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:47,700
Oh.

1387
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,620
Where the fuck did the gas come from?

1388
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,180
Boy.

1389
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,900
Up we go.

1390
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:56,880

You can't be friends with him anymore.

1396
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,100
If you have any guys on your friends list, you're gonna
cheat on me.

1397
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,340
Can you delete all of them?

1398
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,640
I have a guy who actually did that.

1399
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,160

Ow.

1408
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,480
Don't sink our boat.

1409
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,820
Yeah, don't sink it.

1410
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah!

1411
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:18,880
No!

1412
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,300
It's a group ember!

1413
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:24,320
Shoot the fucking octopus!

1414
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:25,660
Where are you?

1415
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:25,900
Where are you?

1416
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:26,020
No!

1417
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:26,120
It's a group ember!

1418
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,540
I'm not the one for shooting!

1419
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,800
We both can shoot!

1420
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,280
Wait, we can?

1421
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,180
How do I shoot?

1422
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:34,200
Oh!

Oh my god, I'm doing it.

1425
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,820
I didn't realize that's how you shoot.

1426
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,080
We have to shoot this thing!

1427
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,860
We have to shoot this thing!

1428
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,980
The fireworks, the fireworks, the fireworks.

1429
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,580
Someone was like, don't divorce!

1430
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:52,760
Don't!

1431
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,960
Mom, Dad, don't do it!

1432
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,000
It's too late.

1433
01:11:59,020 --> 01:11:59,820
It's your fault.

1434
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,260
All right, we gotta kill this guy.

1435
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,060
I'm doing my part.

1436
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,620
I'm doing my part.

01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,900
All right, here we go.

01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,660
We're doing it.

Die, octopus.

1440
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,600
You don't even need to kill them, to be fair, I feel like.

1441
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,040
I think so.

1442
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,100
Our ship has health.

1443
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,220

1448
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,340
What do you mean, Doki?

1449
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:05,960
Doki.

1450
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,620
What do you mean?

1451
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:08,720
Doki.

1452
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,100
This is, what happened to, this is a group effort.

1453
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,020
What happened to that?

1454
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,160
What happened to that?

1455
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,100
Now it's my fault.

1456
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,740
I literally have never said that line.

1457
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,180
Now it's my fault.

1458
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,660
You're the one that kept saying it.

1459
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,380
Now it's my fault just because we took a little damage.

1460
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,520
It's now my fault.

1461
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,400
I see you.

1462
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,480
I see you.

1463
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,620
I remember all the times you ran into the...

1464
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,380
Fucking...

1465
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,600
It's a wall!

1466
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,200
I'm a better person now!

1467
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:38,880
Really?

1468
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,300
Yeah, I've changed.

1469
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,260
Yeah, you don't have to leave.

1470
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,200
I've changed.

1471
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,320
You fixed me.

1472
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,000
I promise I'll treat you better.

1473
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,200
You fixed me.

1474
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,460
Oh, thank goodness!

1475
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,520
Maybe we shoot that one penguin over there.

1476
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,260
Straight into the icebox now.

1477
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,180
Oh, we can't shoot them.

1478
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,520
Don't worry.

1479
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,360
Don't worry.

1480
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,240
I...

1481
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,260
What?

1482
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,040
If I didn't sign the prenup!

1483
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,740
You know, that's more beneficial.

1484
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:13,280
Oh!

1485
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,000
Oh my god, you see it?

1486
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:16,300
What?

1487
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,540
Oh, the giant octopus.

1488
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,420
I see it.

1489
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,520
Wait, how do we... How do we dodge that?

1490
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,980
How do we do?

1491
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,000
Do we shoot it?

1492
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,180
Yeah!

1493
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,620
Oh, you didn't tell me!

1494
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:35,060
What happened to context clues?

1495
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,920
I felt like it was obvious.

1496
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,920
I know it was not.

1497
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,620
No, it was not.

1498
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,160
You know I need to be told what to do.

1499
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,100
You know, I...

1500
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:48,500
You know, damn well, I'm a little special, and that's why
you fell in love with me.

1501
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,580
This was arranged by your parents.

1502
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,140
They lost the bet.

1503
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,880
I lost.

1504
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,220
Hey, Mr. Octopus.

1505
01:14:58,920 --> 01:14:59,840
Don't listen to her.

1506
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,440
You are super cute.

1507
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,800
Ah, you're so cocky.

1508
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,640
Nick Rider!

1509
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,060
Ship!

1510
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:10,560
Oh!

1511
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,960
Oh, so you're an engineer.

1512
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:16,960
You're so good at engineer.

1513
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:17,740
Fix our ship.

1514
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,140
Stop talking, Cody.

1515
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,360
And start shooting.

1516
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,820
It's the point of having that degree if you can't even fix
our boat.

1517
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,620
It's a whirlpool!

1518
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,840
Oh, we're gonna shoot the... There we go!

1519
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,150
Okay, there we go.

1520
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:36,870
We're good.

1521
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,310
We're okay.

1522
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,250
Nothing to worry about.

1523
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,850
We're not panicking.

1524
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,830
Nothing to panic about.

1525
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:47,630
Oh, God.

1526
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:48,030
Oh, God.

1527
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:48,370
All right.

1528
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:48,790
Nice.

1529
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:50,310
We got turn around now.

1530
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,990
I mean, it's pretty easy so far.

1531
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,170
Because he has a giant head.

1532
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,450
Why do you say things?

1533
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,050
Why do you say things?

1534
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,050
What do you mean?

1535
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,770
We got full HP now.

1536
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:04,830
Keep them away.

1537
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:05,250
See?

1538
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:07,330
Oh, God.

1539
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,470
It's a duck with dynamite.

1540
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,530
Who the fuck gave the kid a dynamite?

1541
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:15,210
What the fuck gave this kid a dynamite?

1542
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:17,090
How does she know how to make a bomb?

1543
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:18,070
Why is it?

1544
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,130
No, I got her the castle.

1545
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:20,390
You're the engineer.

1546
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:21,910
This is engineer stuff.

1547
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,290
Why would a farmer know how to make a bomb?

1548
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:27,830
Oh god.

1549
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:30,950
Oh wait, how do a fuck do we... Oh, it's okay.

1550
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,190
It was just special effects.

1551
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,790
It was just a cutscene.

1552
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:35,930
Wait, there's more.

1553
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:37,090
There's... Oh, there's a tentacle!

01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:37,330

I care about my childhood.

1566
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:51,940

1568
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,060
Monkey flip.

1569
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
Okay, what the fuck?

Whoa!

Whoa!

1574
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,850
This is what she said.

1575
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:27,210
Okay, okay, I didn't realize that you were actually singing
the song to monkey flip

1576
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:34,850
I just realized my fucking chrome tap was on

1577
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:54,640
No, I swear I swear by a DMCA I swear I can't DJ it because
of I'm fucking sway That's not my fault what do you think

1578
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:04,540
you sent me the link you had the chrome tab open I didn't
realize I had my chrome audio shit was oh my Sound dive fix

1579
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:17,040
it The worst part is like I replayed it I thought it was
guaranteed.

1580
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:21,180
Monkey flip, monkey flip.

1581
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,500
Every time we flipped into octopus, that's where my brain
went.

1582
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1583
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:31,060
I just hope we survive this ride too.

1584
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,680
How are we still not finished with this chapter?

1585
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,500
What the fuck is this level?

1586
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,700
The bridge isn't supposed to be up.

1587
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,580
Gosh, it's winched by a balloon.

1588
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,160
Hey, the fuck uses the word winch.

1589
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,540
Yeah, I hate that creepy balloon.

1590
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,980
Why'd you have to buy her that?

1591
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:48,420
Yeah.

1592
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:49,520
We can't get to the elephant.

1593
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,100
Why?

1594
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,600
See, not everything's my fault.

1595
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,160
Oh, God.

1596
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,300
Oh, what the fuck?

1597
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,280
What parent will buy this for the child?

1598
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,960
What millennial parent would buy this for the child?

1599
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,900
Dude, don't we look like millennials here?

1600
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,800
I'm saying, why would millennials buy this?

1601
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,500
Millennials won't buy this.

1602
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,460
They'll just buy an iPad.

1603
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:23,220
I'm pretty sure this was before iPads existed man There's no
way Rose gave the elephant a crown You know, a queen's crown

1604
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:30,860
Dude, we live in a fucking farm Yeah, I guess so it's her
favorite toy Perfect, so now we're killing a queen Pardon me

1605
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,640
Killing who?

1606
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:39,320
No, no, no, no She said chilling Yeah, this was made before
Queen Elizabeth We are really looking forward to Okay, that

1607
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:50,800
does not mean much see well all visitors must prove
themselves worthy of an audience with the queen get a ball

1608
01:20:50,800 --> 01:21:01,180
over there and use it to pop the balloon and then you will
this is messed up why is she helping us kill the queen yeah

1609
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:09,680
it's the queen that bad no we're killing the queen man but
it could be implied we literally the storyline talked about

1610
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:16,000
that they said we're chilling with the queen Yeah, but like,
she really believed that.

1611
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,960
Oh, I don't have to be there.

1612
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:20,100
Wait.

1613
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,140
Oh, and then we do this.

1614
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,380
And then it goes over to the other side.

1615
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:27,420
Oh, we did it!

1616
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,860
Look at all those blocks and wheels.

1617
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,400
I guess it's time for some fast direction again.

1618
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,980
Oh, we have to run.

1619
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:37,620
Let's find out.

01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,600
Okay, let's get this ball going.

I'm ready?

1622
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,100
Not that way.

1623
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,440
Wait, did you not do it?

01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:49,460

1627
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:21,560
Cirque du Soleil.

1628
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:22,480
The circus.

1629
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,080
You know what's fucked up?

1630
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,960
I went and saw Cirque du Soleil.

1631
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:30,920
Okay, I saw Cirque du Soleil two times in my life.

1632
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,600
And the fucked up thing.

1633
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,200
Okay, you know how Cirque du Soleil...

1634
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,340
Okay, I have to look this up.

1635
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,680
But Cirque du Soleil has lots and lots and lots of shows.

1636
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,540
Did I fuck up?

1637
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,640
Wait, you missed.

1638
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:45,840
Okay.

1639
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,660
Okay, let me...

1640
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,220
Try that again.

1641
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,080
Did you get the other balloon?

1642
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,280
Yeah, you have to aim at the one between the bars.

1643
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,280
Or you can aim at that one.

1644
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:00,040
Oh.

1645
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:01,560
Oh, okay.

1646
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,900
Maybe you should.

1647
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,900
Maybe you're better at this than me.

1648
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:13,970
Oh, are you sure?

1649
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:19,190
I literally did not say a word and you're just talking to
yourself.

1650
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:21,370
You're literally just talking to yourself.

1651
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:22,710
I don't know what to tell you.

1652
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:26,450
You're like, oh, maybe you're better than it than me.

1653
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:27,310
Are you sure?

1654
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,530
Like, I didn't see a single line.

1655
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,830
Are you sure this is how you're supposed to do it?

1656
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,130
Yeah.

1657
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,610
I don't think you can go through that.

1658
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:41,730
Oh, maybe we have to curve it through the side.

1659
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:42,710
I don't think you can.

1660
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:48,830
I think we're supposed to do that one to that one first, and
then that's going to open the gate.

1661
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:49,750
Why would you shoot me now?

1662
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:50,790
Because I'm timing it.

1663
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:51,130
There.

1664
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:52,150
See, look at that.

1665
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,090
I timed that fucking perfectly!

1666
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,130
You know timings?

1667
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:58,990
Oh my god!

1668
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,890
I actually timed that perfectly!

1669
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,010
What are you doing?

1670
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,030
I didn't know you knew timings, man.

1671
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:11,190
That's gonna close the moment you get there.

1672
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:12,830
Wait, what?

1673
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,150
What?

1674
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:15,910
No way to get the center.

1675
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,070
There's the center right there.

1676
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,050
Why did you not see me hit the other balloon?

1677
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:34,930
did i did but i'm saying there's also this one that we have
to get okay anyway so i saw circus delay has like like like

iphone and then and then i was luckily enough i was able to

1683
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:27,870
watch a new search to slay um uh new realized like what show

1684
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:41,150

watched 15 plus years ago like i somehow was able to go back

1685
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:54,670
and watch that same show 15 years ago when there is that's
not new that's not I didn't even move my entire thing.

1686
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,230
I did not move nothing.

1687
01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:00,850
There's 60 plus Circus Salatios.

1688
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:04,690
And I somehow was able to watch the same one.

1689
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:06,070
Like, how?

1690
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,690
How is that possible?

1691
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:11,630
I'm sorry, I had to talk about it.

1692
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,650
It actually pissed me off that I found out.

1693
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,230
Honestly, I can't even remember Circus Salat.

1694
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:18,570
I feel like my mom, like, fall asleep during it.

1695
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:22,070
I only remembered because I was, like, the first act.

1696
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,090
I was like, wait a minute.

1697
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:24,390
I know this song.

1698
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:28,790
I was like, why would I know this song if I haven't fucking
watched it?

1699
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:33,450
If I haven't had that song, those songs in repeat for so
long.

1700
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:34,690
Where do we go?

1701
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:37,470
Oh, I have to pass it to you.

1702
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,130
Are you ready?

1703
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:39,250
Catch.

1704
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,130
Oh my god, we're so good.

1705
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,710
It's like we're gamers.

1706
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,590
That's nice, honey.

1707
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:52,970
Is that an American?

1708
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:54,390
I have no idea the cut.

1709
01:26:54,510 --> 01:27:03,150
No, it's a it's a circus thing The circus in a is like the
one of the bet not one of the biggest circuses in the world

1710
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:09,450
And I somehow was able to watch the same show twice with a
15 plus year gap in between

1711
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:18,970
Like I don't know how it was possible, but like I somehow
was able to do it

1712
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,160
Honestly, I didn't know Oh, what the fuck?

1713
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:26,740
We did it.

1714
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,500
We wouldn't even coordinate that.

1715
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,660
Oh, my god.

1716
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:33,000
It looked at us before it died.

1717
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:35,620
We will.

1718
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:36,980
Thanks for your help.

1719
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,280
Yeah, thanks a lot.

1720
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:39,900
Let's get to the castle.

1721
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,360
Yay, we committed murder.

1722
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,680
I feel like he would know we're committing murder now after
we killed that balloon.

1723
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,840
Still can't believe I watched the same show.

1724
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,700
Honestly, why did that person let us do that?

1725
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,620
I really hated that clown.

1726
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,880
Maybe that clown was a fucking asshole.

1727
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:05,460
I mean, look at him.

1728
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,960
He looks like an asshole.

1729
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,440
Why do I have to kill the queen?

1730
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:12,340
Too many taxes.

1731
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:14,340
Okay.

1732
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,160
Viva la France.

1733
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,000
What?

1734
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,200
What?

1735
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,540
You don't know French history?

1736
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:23,900
Hold on.

1737
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,440
You said you never finished building the chat.

1738
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,160
No, it's more like...

1739
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,480
I just did not expect you to see that.

1740
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,100
It's time for the revolution!

1741
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,080
The elephant!

1742
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,900
The gate must be nearby!

1743
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:38,840
Come on!

1744
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:40,780
It's time!

1745
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,140
Get the guillotine!

1746
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:43,500
Oh my god!

1747
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:43,880
Oh my god!

1748
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,040
They must have guillotines!

1749
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,440
This is medieval times now!

1750
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:46,900
Oh my god!

1751
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,140
No!

1752
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,740
Honestly, hold on.

1753
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,860
If I had to die...

1754
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,200
Yeah.

1755
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,400
If you...

1756
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:54,920
If...

1757
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,680
If I got to choose how I would die...

1758
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,120
Yeah.

1759
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,740
I would want to go buy a guillotine.

1760
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:03,680
What the fuck?

1761
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,060
Why?

1762
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:08,900
Do you know, like, you can, like, the head start, like, you
know, you still process, like, 10 seconds?

1763
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:10,620
Hey.

1764
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:11,820
Why?

1765
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:12,860
Why?

1766
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:13,620
Why a guillotine?

1767
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,340
Hold on.

1768
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:14,800
Hear me out.

1769
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,140
It would be so cool.

1770
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,640
Like, I'm not going to die from old age.

1771
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:22,020
I would go buy guillotine and I would D-Y-I it.

1772
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,020
I would make my own.

1773
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:27,180
You know, like, if you'll make your own, it doesn't
guarantee that you're going to get the slice right.

1774
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,400
And, hold on.

1775
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,440
And I would...

1776
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:33,200
trademark that shit and name it the Gumi Teen.

1777
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,320
What the fuck would you already exist?

1778
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,080
You can't trademark something that already exists.

1779
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,100
What is the Gumi Teen gonna look?

1780
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,580
How is the Gumi Teen gonna look different?

1781
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,360
Hold on.

1782
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:47,980
Hold on.

1783
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,300
I'll show you.

1784
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:51,800
The Gumi Teen has something different to it.

1785
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,180
Are you ready?

1786
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:52,880
Yeah, okay.

1787
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,340
I'm gonna drive for you real quick.

1788
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:57,420
You're gonna drive for me real quick.

1789
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:03,140
The average guillotine here, I'll even square it.

1790
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:04,120
Okay.

1791
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,300
Okay.

1792
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,000
Let me see.

1793
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:09,980
See what this is.

1794
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:12,620
All right.

1795
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:19,080
So the guillotine, it's usually like this, and then it's
like this.

1796
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,760
And then it's like this.

1797
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:26,500
And then it has, like, this blade here.

1798
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,220
And then you put your little head here.

1799
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:30,840
Right?

1800
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,940
And then they usually have a bucket to keep the head.

1801
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:35,300
A bucket?

1802
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:35,840
What?

1803
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,720
Oh, you mean like a bucket to catch the to catch the head?

1804
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,220
The head.

1805
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:39,760
Yeah.

1806
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,860
But that's what the normal guillotine has.

1807
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,640
Yeah, that's the normal guillotine.

1808
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:44,900
But this is the guillotine.

1809
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,680
First of all, it would have little ears.

1810
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,220
Okay?

1811
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,280
Let's get that straight.

1812
01:30:54,680 --> 01:31:08,280
And then instead of a normal blade, the little blade would
have little teeth and it would look like this and then um it

1813
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:17,280
would be right here and that would be me that would be dry
yourself

1814
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:33,540
that would be me and then hold on i don't even see it yet
what do you mean the string would be a little dog tree the

1815
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:41,500
what would be a little dog tree you know the like pulley
thing how you pull it to make those oh okay oh so the dog

1816
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:54,100
you won't know exactly when it's whenever the dog decides to
pull that's so fucked up that is actually so funny so so the

1817
01:31:54,100 --> 01:32:00,720
only thing different about it is that it's controlled by a
dog so you try to say it'll make people feel less bad

1818
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:11,400
because the dog did it is that why no no i'm not gonna make
a dog do it and what's the dog shape for it's just bone

1819
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:19,460
shaped it's just like branding you're not trademarking the
guillotine because you're just no it has freaking teeth and

1820
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:26,300
everything it's just it's like you put on a fortnite skin on
it it's still fortnite you put on a gooby skin on it it's

1821
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:36,480
still a guillotine it's still who trademarked trademarked
we'll be fucked up if somebody trademarked the guillotine so

1822
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:44,580
every time you use the guillotine you have to pay you have
to pay the trademark rights to it that's why we don't even

1823
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:54,840
have wait the guillotine is trademarked as a game wizards of
the coast wait dungeons and dragons trademarked the

1824
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:04,460
guillotine what the fuck okay but they can't trademark the
goomy teen oh my god magic the gathering and dungeon and

1825
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:16,160

1832
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,640
And pause the game.

1833
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,920
I think you've cooked long enough.

1834
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:17,220
I think you've cooked long enough.

1835
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,240

It's okay.

1877
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,720
It's okay.

1878
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,120

Oh, it's so beautiful.

1908
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:52,180
Beautiful is not the word I would use for that.

1909
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,520
You're not even looking.

1910
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:54,980
You're on your fucking train.

1911
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,080
It's like you love the train more than me.

1912
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,220
Maybe I do!

1913
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:00,600

01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,260
That's fucked up.

1915
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,120
How would you ever say that?

1916
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,200
What can the train do that I can't?

1917

What can the train do that I can't?

1919
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,160
I don't understand.

1920
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:18,240
What are you supposed to do here?

1921
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,380
The gate's locked.

1922
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,060
There's got to be a way in.

1923
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:24,540
Is there?

1924
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,140
I think I found what we're supposed to do.

1925
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,720
But like, what if I just want to live here?

1926
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,840

Wait, what's the point of that?

1934
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:18,910
There was no point.

1935
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:20,010
We had to do this anyway.

1936
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:20,970
No, I couldn't go the other way.

1937
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:21,610

01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:26,850
How do we push it?

1941
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:28,630
Did you hear him?

1942
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:30,430
No, I don't...

1943
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:32,270
He said you're crazy, but I like him.

1944
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:32,330
Yeah.

1945
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:33,090

Jump in.

1949
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:43,970
What did it move it together?

1950
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,950
Oh, so you're the crazy one, and I'm trying to fix you.

1951
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:50,990
Okay.

1952
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:51,930
Okay.

1953
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:54,190
I knew I was the norm.

1954
01:39:54,430 --> 01:40:00,050
Any man that said my ex, dude, I dated a guy who said all my
exes were crazy.

1955
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:00,930
He was the problem.

1956
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:02,650
That's full of God.

1957
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:03,950
Are you trying to say I'm the problem?

1958
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:07,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1959
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:09,090
We're not here to cause trouble.

1960
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:10,910
I am.

1961
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:12,290

01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:14,670
Wait.

1963
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:17,970
That sounds a lot like...

1964
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:22,050
Queen of the Magic Castle.

1965
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:24,490
In short, Her Majesty.

1966
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:26,790
Yes, you mean Her Majesty.

1967
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:28,770
Can you take us to her?

1968
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:30,290
It's kind of urgent.

1969
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:33,330
The Queen does not grant audience with peasants.

1970
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:41,630
peasants we made them okay I built yeah all right I even
came up with the name magic castle so if it wasn't for me

This book is a fucking asshole.

01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,070
Yeah, a snitch.

1977
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:18,810

Yeah, Dick Rider.

1980
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:26,630
He's lying.

1981
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:31,610
Then why don't you show the letter to Her Majesty?

1982
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:33,710
Well, maybe I will.

1983
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:43,570
okay so the thing with the letter is it's kind of complex
it's a speech letter exactly because i can't write

1984
01:41:49,800 --> 01:42:02,460
hold on i received a screenshot is this like off-brand lego

toilet.

1986
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,940
There's different toys that look just like that.

1987
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:12,880
I don't remember what.

1988
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,380
It was like, it wasn't Legos.

1989
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:14,980
They were bigger.

1990
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,100
No, it's Play Mobile.

1991
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:22,140
It's in Play Mobile, like, it's Play Mobile, like, like
Lego.

1992
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,720
Anyone hear us?

1993
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,460

1994
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,860
I know Lego has, like, baby Lego.

1995
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:29,980
Duplo.

1996
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,120
Oh, Duplo.

1997
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,260
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1998
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,560
Do you mind?

1999
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,200
What are you doing?

2000
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,040
I built that.

2001
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,220
Yeah, I can see that.

2002
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:40,780
The toilet has no pipes.

2003
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,600
Yeah, it's a toy castle.

2004
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,880
Toys don't go to the bathroom.

2005
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:46,920
Yeah.

2006
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:48,520
Toys don't need to eat.

2007
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,140
That's why did they have a pie?

2008
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:52,020
That's right.

2009
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,260
It was a waste of food.

2010
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,960
Those toys don't need to eat anyway.

2011
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:57,760
Ew.

2012
01:42:58,820 --> 01:42:59,960
It's like paper.

2013
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,940
How am I like weaker than paper?

2014
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:09,730
Oh, no.

2015
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:12,590
Bro, am I getting too flabby?

2016
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:18,330
Did you shard yourself or something?

2017
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,490
Why are you pulling your pants?

2018
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:20,210
What the fuck?

2019
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:23,390
I think you sharded.

2020
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:24,410
Stop!

2021
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:27,650

01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:31,470
Why?

2023
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,210
This is a kids game.

2024
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:36,670
This is a children's game.

2025
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,150
This is PG.

2026
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:42,850

01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:55,790
We killed him.

01:43:56,870 --> 01:43:58,470
Oh Oh, I get a cool fire sword.

2030
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:00,830

I'm trying to look at my abilities.

2038
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:15,810
It's like a roguelike.

2039
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:17,970

2056
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,350

01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:35,890
I can't dash through that.

2065
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:37,990
Is there some way to open that up for me?

2066
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:40,370
Oh, you stay right there.

2067
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:42,790
Oh, I have to go back.

2068
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:43,170
Okay.

2069
01:45:44,230 --> 01:45:45,130
I'm too chunky.

2070
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:47,170
Wait, watch this.

2071
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:48,550

Wait, that's you.

2076
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:02,250
I don't have to do anything now.

2077
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:04,990
I don't have to do...

2078
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:06,030
Oh, I might be dying.

2079
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:06,670
Don't die.

2080
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:07,130
Don't die.

2081
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:07,710
Don't die.

2082
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,550
Okay, I'm back, I'm back.

2083
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:10,390
You can die now.

2084
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:11,590
Don't worry.

2085
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:12,990
I got you.

2086
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:17,170
I'll chill here.

2087
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:19,530
Oh, I have to do this.

2088
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:25,910
I think she's dead?

2089
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:26,990
No, there's still one more.

2090
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:30,070
All right, I gotta kill this one guy.

2091
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:33,370
I believe in your wife!

2092
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:36,330
A fire tornado him.

2093
01:46:40,890 --> 01:46:41,830
Oh, chest.

2094
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:45,030
I feel like the chest is, like, useless, to be fair.

2095
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:46,250
Yeah, you have to get them.

2096
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:47,250
Don't worry.

2097
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:49,750
I'm pretty sure your sword can make it over.

2098
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:52,330
There's, like, range.

2099
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:54,430
This is you.

2100
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:55,030
This is you.

2101
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:56,490
Yeah, this is you.

2102
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:58,550
This is 100% you.

2103
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:00,310
I'm too far.

2104
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,050
Yay!

2105
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:05,350
Whoop!

2106
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:07,630
Where am I?

2107
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:09,010
Where am I?

2108
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:11,830
Oh, I keep looking at you thinking that's me.

2109
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:14,670
It's okay.

2110
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:16,270
Oh, pio.

2111
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:19,790
Oh, pio.

2112
01:47:20,590 --> 01:47:21,030
Oh, yes.

2113
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:22,670
Traps are the prisoners.

2114
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:23,770
Oh!

2115
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:26,110
Oh, I accidentally ulted.

2116
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:29,290
Okay, freeze.

2117
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:34,190
Don't worry, the hero is here.

2118
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:36,750
Okay.

2119
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:38,290
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2120
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:44,190
It's crazy how many different like genres this game has

2121
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:52,190
I'm coming over I'm helping

2122
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:59,410
You're just mad that you have to rely on me.

2123
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:00,170
Oh stop

2124
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:09,310
That's what you get for not believing in my ice powers No, I
did.

2125
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:10,790
It's just you took too long.

2126
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:13,110
Are you blaming me?

2127
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:15,970
A person that has control here?

2128
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:17,310
With the ices?

2129
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:21,090
I made you a bridge.

2130
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:24,090
I made you a bridge and this is the things I get.

2131
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:26,170
Okay, bud.

2132
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:29,750
You could have built one before we got tiny, huh?

2133
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,870
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2134
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:32,970
Oh, shit!

2135
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:33,650
What?

2136
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:36,090
What the fuck is that?

2137
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:37,950
It looks like a baking cone.

2138
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:39,250
Okay, go, go, go.

2139
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:39,950
Okay, we gotta go.

2140
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:40,730
We gotta go fast.

2141
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:43,590
We gotta go fast.

2142
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:48,370
Wait, which way is this way?

2143
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:50,350
Oh, I went the wrong way!

2144
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:50,810
Wow!

2145
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:54,510
I keep going the wrong way, Gumi!

2146
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:57,770
Oh, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

2147
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:00,810
I got it, I got it, I got it!

2148
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:03,170
I got it, I got it, I got it!

2149
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:09,890
Okay.

2150
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:11,810
Alright, we're fine.

2151
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:12,290
We're fine.

2152
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:16,170
See, we're okay.

2153
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:18,130
What the fuck gave this fucking...

2154
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:23,650
A baby a thing.

2155
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:29,910
Goodbye.

2156
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:32,130
It's like Toy Story.

2157
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:36,780
Doom.

2158
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,800
There's so many references, sis.

2159
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,160
We made it.

2160
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:45,120
We did it.

2161
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:48,980
Now it's time to kill the queen.

2162
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:52,280
Bowser?

2163
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,100
Bowser?

2164
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,340
Oh, crap.

2165
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:56,380
I forgot about the immortal troll.

2166
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,800
The immortal troll?

2167
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:02,760
Wait, he's taking zero damage.

2168
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,420
Because we have to do the chains!

2169
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:06,600
Oh!

2170
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:09,560
Oh!

2171
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,680
Okay, I'm going to the chains.

2172
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:13,680
I'm going to the chains.

2173
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:15,960
Oh, fuck.

2174
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,740
Oh my gosh, okay, I'm going to the chains.

2175
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,000
I'm going to the chains.

2176
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,120
Bait him here.

2177
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:20,860
Bait him here.

2178
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,340
Get over here, little man.

2179
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:25,320
Nice.

2180
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,020
And then we bait him into the thingy.

2181
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,380
He has to charge it, right?

2182
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:32,940
Come on, go into the little hole.

2183
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,540
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2184
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,480
I'm doing it.

2185
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,000
Goodbye.

2186
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,180
Toy story.

2187
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:42,340
No way to get a mug ever again.

2188
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,560
Yeah, what she said.

2189
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:45,340
Oh, oh, May, come on.

01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:45,760

used to be in the chess club.

2196
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:51,500
Because I don't have the time.

2197
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:53,280
Plus, it's not a toy.

2198
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,000
You know, it was my grandmother's.

2199
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:55,500
Oh!

2200
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:58,400
She would appreciate that it's actually being used.

2201
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:00,100
Oh, no, no.

2202
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:01,820
I don't think we're actually playing chess.

2203
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,680
Chess boards alive.

2204
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:05,420
There's no way.

2205
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:06,920
What if we don't know how to play chess?

2206
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:10,800
Yeah, it's still a...

2207
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,060
We have to kill the king and the queen.

2208
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,340
Kill the queen first!

2209
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,680
The queen knows the most literally...

2210
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,520
We gotta kill...

2211
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:23,820
Wait, if we kill the king, that means the game ends
instantly, right?

2212
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:25,680
Because that's how it should work.

2213
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,020
Okay, I go for the king.

2214
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:29,780
I see you.

2215
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:32,200
I'm going for the king.

2216
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:34,260
Wait, is it healing?

2217
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:36,180
No, I'm actually hurting him.

2218
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:36,940
Okay, that's good.

2219
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,420
Okay, I was worried.

2220
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,480
Don't worry, I got this!

2221
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:43,560
We're tag team!

2222
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,180
Okay, wait, how did you die?

2223
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,020
No, no, no, no.

2224
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,620
You died, though.

2225
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,280
It's okay.

2226
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:52,000
The castle can only go in the cross.

2227
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:54,560
I'm teaching you chess.

2228
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:00,480
Do you like this little lesson?

2229
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:02,340
Unit...

2230
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:03,820
Wait, actually, do you know how to play chess?

2231
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:03,840
What the hell?

2232
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,400
I got it over!

2233
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:10,480
Okay, they explained why the fucking horses and knights
aren't going diagonal.

2234
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:11,740
And in L shape.

2235
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,420
Horses don't go diagonal.

2236
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,240
They go in an L shape.

2237
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,060
I said it in L shape!

2238
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,760
It's why I'm here to teach you about chess.

2239
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:27,900
Mansplainer.

2240
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:29,700
Mansplainer.

2241
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,460
I don't know.

2242
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:36,660
I didn't get hit once.

2243
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:39,440
Because I don't know how to play chess.

2244
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,400
Why does it have no handle?

2245
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:43,560
I think it's because the queen gets summoned and shit.

2246
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:44,580
Oh, yeah.

2247
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:45,040
You're right.

2248
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:45,900
Ugh.

2249
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,780
Oh, oh yeah, I remember.

2250
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,440
What the fuck?

2251
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,900
What the fuck?

2252
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,540
Did I make this door?

2253
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,280
Like...

2254
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,040
How?

2255
01:53:58,180 --> 01:53:58,400
Yeah.

2256
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:02,320
Oh, that was not how you opened the door.

2257
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:03,960
No!

2258
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,920
We lost our wizard powers!

2259
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,180
How are we gonna kill the elephant now?

2260
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:08,980
I don't know.

2261
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:10,400
Wait a minute.

2262
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:12,060
That's right, I forgot.

2263
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:16,480
I color coded them the opposite way around to fool
intruders.

2264
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,160
What?

2265
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:18,020
What?

2266
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,220
It's actually very smart if you think about it.

2267
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,540
Who the fuck's an intruder?

2268
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:23,800
Why would you do that?

2269
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:25,140
Who's gonna intrude the castle?

2270
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:28,960
Still gonna miss my outfit.

2271
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:35,290
Why do we put electricity there?

2272
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:37,630
Like, for a kid's toy?

2273
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:41,030
What if my daughter forgot?

2274
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:44,230
Yo, she's gonna shock her finger.

2275
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:47,670

Okay.

2311
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,160
You put it over here.

2312
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:38,680
Okay, okay, and I'll time it.

2313
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:40,080
Watch this.

2314
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,860
Maybe we go up here because I'm impatient.

2315
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,060
Watch this.

2316
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:45,380
Maybe here.

2317
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,100
I'm impatient.

2318
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,160
Boom!

2319
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,840
There you go.

2320
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:51,800
Perfect timing.

2321
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,580
Oh, my God.

2322
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:55,240
Okay.

2323
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,720
That is so fucked up.

2324
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:00,640
How are we gonna kill this thing?

2325
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:03,200
You know how you said it looks like a cookie monster?

2326
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:03,780
Yeah?

2327
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,220
It kind of reminds me of those old YouTube videos.

2328
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,260
Oh, like, let me fire my laser.

2329
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:09,720
Yeah!

2330
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:13,240
Let me fire my laser.

2331
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,080
I don't wanna do this.

2332
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,440
I think her head's gonna pop off.

2333
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:21,200
I'm pretty sure.

2334
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:23,320
Yeah, this head's definitely gonna pop off.

2335
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:25,400
I think we're popping off her head.

2336
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:49,200
oh at least it's not the head we gotta get her to the edge
of the bookshelf edge of the bookshelf bro this is bro

the edge come on goomy we already made it this far we can't

2338
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:02,080
back up now we made it this far

2339
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,020
It's all right.

2340
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:10,220
Oh, God.

2341
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,360
They're begging to not die.

2342
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:15,240
Oh, my God.

2343
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:15,960
She's struggling.

2344
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:16,600
Get her.

2345
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:19,040
She can't get away.

2346
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:20,720
My God.

2347
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:22,980
Who did I marry?

2348
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:24,340
I married a boy.

2349
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:27,100
It's too late.

2350
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:28,380
We're running this far.

2351
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:31,120
If we let her live, she's going to tell the cops.

2352
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:35,880
Stop resisting.

2353
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:36,720
Oh!

2354
01:59:39,730 --> 01:59:40,110
Pump!

2355
01:59:40,610 --> 01:59:41,970
She doesn't need the ear!

2356
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:45,870
She doesn't feel no...

2357
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:47,290
She doesn't feel pain.

2358
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:48,410
Don't worry.

2359
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:50,330
She feels zero pain.

2360
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:51,630
She's a dog.

2361
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:58,410
Down she goes.

2362
02:00:00,510 --> 02:00:01,050
Goodbye.

2363
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:06,650
See?

2364
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:08,810
She was lying about feeling pain.

2365
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:15,740
Humi, come on.

2366
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:17,820
No, you can buttermash faster than this, Humi.

2367
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:18,780
Come on.

2368
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:21,760
This is a group effort.

2369
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:24,960
We agreed to this when we got married.

2370
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:27,740
I did agree to committing murder.

2371
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:29,580
Lord, lift the king.

2372
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:33,420
Did he?

2373
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:33,880
Kitty.

2374
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,720
Did we just kid?

2375
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,840
Imagine being a kid.

2376
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:40,200
Imagine being a kid.

2377
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,200
You're dancing your doll ripped up out of nowhere.

2378
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,120
Yeah, come on, darling.

2379
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:47,520
I love how, like, we threw her leg and ears, too.

2380
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,260
Are you okay?

2381
02:00:57,620 --> 02:00:58,040
Cry.

2382
02:00:58,620 --> 02:00:58,680
Cry.

2383
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,560
Oh, no, cutie.

2384
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,640
Poor cutie.

2385
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,020
I'm sorry.

2386
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,760
I'm so sorry you hurt yourself.

2387
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:06,940
What?

2388
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:10,860
Success.

2389
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:12,540
We made it look like an accident.

2390
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:13,720
May, I think it's working.

2391
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:18,240
Don't we need her tears?

2392
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,400
Yes, come on.

2393
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,080
All right, we gotta get down there.

2394
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,820
Quick, before she stops.

2395
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:25,380
This way.

2396
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:27,160
This is so fucked up.

2397
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:29,580
Like, this is the part where it's fucked up.

2398
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:30,900
We were happy about her crying.

2399
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,960
Yeah, like, our kids cried.

2400
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,080
Fuck yeah!

2401
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:39,980
Time to dance in the rain.

2402
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:41,560
Let's go dance.

2403
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,100
Sweet, sweet tears.

2404
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:47,700
Yeah!

2405
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,500
It's shower time!

2406
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,820
Why is the spell not breaking?

2407
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,540
We don't know.

2408
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,120
The tears should be the cure.

2409
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:01,900
Oh, no.

2410
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,720
So we killed the elephant for no reason.

2411
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:07,820
We're stuck like this.

2412
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,580
The tears should be the-

2413
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:23,630
What's this?

2414
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:26,630
Oh my god, it's her runaway letter.

2415
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:27,930
Is it actually?

2416
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:37,850

Please, your relationship!

2421
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:00,670
No!

2422
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:05,270
Maybe we just like never have kids, don't we?

2423
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:06,870
Take it out of here!

2424
02:03:07,090 --> 02:03:08,470
Yes, I did!

2425
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:09,930
Into four pieces!

2426
02:03:10,210 --> 02:03:10,730
What?

2427
02:03:11,070 --> 02:03:12,850
That did not look like four pieces, man.

2428
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:15,270
Yeah, that's a big ass letter.

2429
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:23,510
It's time to dive deeper into your souls and collect the
four letter pieces!

2430
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:24,330
What?

2431
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:27,090
Bro, fuck his book!

2432
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:31,590
Are we just going to ignore the fact we kid cry?

2433
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:33,990
Yeah, we're going to ignore the fact that she's crying?

2434
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:35,010
Like...

2435
02:03:36,610 --> 02:03:37,970
This is abduction!

2436
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:38,970
Yeah, we're...

2437
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:39,470
Oh yeah, you're right.

2438
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:40,570
We don't need the top two.

2439
02:03:40,730 --> 02:03:41,810
We already read the top two.

2440
02:03:42,370 --> 02:03:43,130
Oh, we're in therapy.

2441
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:45,610
I told you we need a couple's counseling.

2442
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:48,570
Give us the ride of your life.

2443
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:50,150
Give us...

2444
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:51,630
Bravo!

2445
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:55,230
You refer to us instead of me.

2446
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:56,850
You're a team now.

2447
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:57,950
I know we're not a team.

2448
02:03:58,050 --> 02:04:11,430
we don't have time for this time good man that will be our
first topic now do you give each other enough time do you

2452
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:32,570
That's ridiculous.

2453
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,490
It is.

2454
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:34,870
No sense of time.

2455
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:36,590
No, it's not.

2456
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:38,210
No, it's not.

2457
02:04:39,970 --> 02:04:40,770
Insights.

2458
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:42,370
We're making progress already.

2459
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:43,270
Great.

2460
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:44,370
Get ready.

2461
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:45,010
Hey.

2462
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:46,530
Woo.

2463
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:48,910
Look, we made progress.

2464
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:53,830
Look at that.

2465
02:04:53,950 --> 02:04:54,950
We made progress.

2466
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:57,470
I think that couples therapy is working.

2467
02:04:58,050 --> 02:04:59,490
I don't want to go to therapy anymore.

2468
02:04:59,710 --> 02:05:00,550
I think it's over.

2469
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:01,610
I checked out.

2470
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:05,590
My chat was like, I sacrificed my bow pass for you.

2471
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:07,530
Like, that's how deep my love is.

2472
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:08,630
That I paid for!

2473
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:09,930
That I paid for!

2474
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:10,730
That we pay for!

2475
02:05:10,730 --> 02:05:11,910
We share a bank account.

2476
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:12,890
It's our money.

2477
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:15,050
Is that because I'm the only one working?

2478
02:05:17,450 --> 02:05:17,970
Whoa!

2479
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:19,930
And got it.

2480
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:25,230
With no sense of time, you will now be able to control that.

2481
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:26,810
I got the power!

2482

02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:25,050
Let's just do it We need Rose's letter to break the spell
Chat I'm going to tell you guys a story Oh my story should I

2490
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:29,950
tell What?

2491
02:06:30,050 --> 02:06:32,510
What story have I not talked about in a while?

2492
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:36,350
That Doki's chat probably hasn't heard.

2493
02:06:37,110 --> 02:06:38,190
Maybe the OGs.

2494
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:45,590
I don't know.

2495
02:06:45,670 --> 02:06:46,610
What do I have?

2496
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:57,520
I didn't know they made the plush of it.

2497
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:04,900
I think, um, when I was younger, I had a nightmare.

2498
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:07,460
This is completely unrelated.

2499
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:13,660
I just thought about the paste eating kid from Powerpuff
Girls, but when I was younger, I used to have a lot of

2500
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:17,260
nightmares about this one specific episode that had a mime
in it.

2501
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:22,640
And like, I think... No!

2502
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:23,660
Actually, no!

2503
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:24,580
This reminded me!

2504
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:26,140
I actually have a good story.

2505
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:32,140
So when I was in third grade, second third grade, I kept
having nightmares.

2506
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:42,100
They were recurring nightmares of my mom driving and
abandoning me at a trailer with the Kanker sisters from Ed,

2507
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:42,780
Ed, and Eddie.

2508
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:46,420
And it would be different each time.

2509
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:48,480
Like, the first time I had it, she just abandoned me there.

2510
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:54,560
The second time, they abandoned me there, but my, like,
step-sister removed was in the car.

2511
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,380
And then in the third one, she abandoned me there.

2512
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:04,120
But they started shooting fucking ARs.

2513
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:08,820
They had ARs and everything, and I had to take cover behind
the couch.

2514
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:11,200
hiding me on a couch like this.

2515
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:12,620
So scared.

2516
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:15,680
And like, you can see the bullet holes through the couch.

2517
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:22,300
Anyways, um, my teacher gave us an assignment that was like,
oh.

2518
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:29,300
Write down your dreams of late.

2519
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:31,820
Like, your dreams of lately.

2520
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:34,560
And I wrote that down, and then they pulled me aside.

2521
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:36,520
Like, is everything okay, Crystal?

2522
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:37,620
I'm like, yeah.

2523
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:39,620
I mean, I don't know what it is.

2524
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:47,640
I'm gonna have that dream again, but it's okay Anyways What
the fuck kind of dream was that?

2525
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,060
What the fuck?

2526
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:54,340
It was a recurring dream Our recurring dream?

2527
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,280
What are you okay?

2528
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:57,820
I don't know.

2529
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:01,220
I was second grade me that was second grade dog second
grade?

2530
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:11,000

02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:12,840
It's a fortnight skin.

2533
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:20,920
You put a fucking DLC skin on top of a guillotine That's
Okay, don't you see those people who trademark their own

2534
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,700

2535
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,520
No, it's still what?

2536
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:27,940
It's still a knife and then they name it something else.

2537
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,320
It's still a knife.

2538
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:30,380
What do you mean?

2539
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:32,420
Yeah, but they name it something else.

2540
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:32,960
Okay.

2541
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,080
I fixed it There you go.

2542
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:40,720
I fixed it It's your turn to fix this.

2543
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:43,220
Wait, what happened?

2544
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:45,060
Oh, did you not make it through?

2545
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:47,440
You have to time it.

2546
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,800
Oh, I thought you made it through.

2547
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:50,640
I made it through.

2548
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:52,700
There you go.

2549
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:55,720
I got the cool powers.

2550
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:56,760
Wait, what's your power?

2551
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,040
I can make clones of myself.

2552
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:00,820
Oh, I think you can make a clone of yourself here.

2553
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:02,180
But hi.

2554
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:04,420
You have to make clones to do the lever.

2555
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:05,200
Oh.

2556
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:07,600
No, no, no.

2557
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:09,380
I go back in time.

2558
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:10,220
What?

2559
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:11,140
What?

2560
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:16,240
Hey, maybe you can reach the door before it closes with your
clone.

2561
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:17,060
Yeah, see?

2562
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,480
Oh, I thought you meant you want me to leave it to the
lever.

2563
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,320
No, no, I want you to have your clone to go over there.

2564
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,560
Bing.

2565
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:29,420
Yay!

2566
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:31,800
What's this?

2567
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:35,240
Oh!

2568
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:37,540
Yeah, yeah, hook onto this hook.

2569
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:37,960
Wait.

2570
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:40,080
What?

2571
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:44,600
What are you bringing it?

2572
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:45,400
Oh, no.

2573
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:46,200
Oh, here, here, here.

2574
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:49,460
And then...

2575
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:50,720
I make it go up here?

2576
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:52,540
Oh, my God.

2577
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:53,180
We're so smart.

2578
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:58,520
We're so fucking smart.

2579
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:01,160
Yeah, whoever designed this knew what they were.

2580
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,620
Who designed this?

2581
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:05,560
Oh, shit!

2582
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:07,520
Do I respawn next to you?

2583
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:08,960
Oh, no, I don't.

2584
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,180
I should be able to make it.

2585
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:13,080
Make this jump.

2586
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:13,760
Yay!

2587
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:16,260
You have to do the time thingy over there.

2588
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:16,780
Where?

2589
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:17,280
Oh, here.

2590
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,180
I'm rewinding.

2591
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:21,060
Right, here it is.

2592
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:21,660
Jump.

2593
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:23,880
Not that thingy.

2594
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:24,800
No, it's this.

2595
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:27,340
That's the only thing I can rewind.

2596
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:29,160
No, look over there.

2597
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:29,660
Oh.

2598
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:31,520
Wait, what?

2599
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:31,920
Oh.

2600
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:35,400
I did it.

2601
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,880
Wait, but where do you go?

2602
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:41,300
Oh.

2603
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,060
Yeah, that's the thing.

2604
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:42,760
Where do you go?

2605
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,100
There's a button up there.

2606
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:48,540
I think you jump over there.

2607
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:50,440
Yeah.

2608
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:53,380
And then what?

2609
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:56,020
And then you leave your clone?

2610
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:56,900
Hold on, hold on.

2611
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:00,320
Yeah, let it fall.

2612
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:04,870
Oh!

2613
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:07,650
We did it!

2614
02:12:08,850 --> 02:12:10,410
And then I'll let it go up.

2615
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:11,910
Uh-huh.

2616
02:12:12,610 --> 02:12:12,910
Yeah.

2617
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:16,030
And then you press the button!

2618
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:17,170
Team!

2619
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:21,250
I like how you said we did it, but I figured it out.

2620
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:23,630
Yeah, but you need me to be able to do it.

2621
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:28,250
There's no I in team.

2622
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:34,510
There's no I in marriage, too.

2623
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:37,070
Oh.

2624
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:40,290
There you go.

2625
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:41,270
Fixed it.

2626
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:43,770
What do we do with this?

2627
02:12:43,890 --> 02:12:44,750
Why did you fix it?

2628
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:45,590
Nothing.

2629
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:47,870
Oh, but it looks so beautiful.

2630
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:50,970
We needed this thing.

2631
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:52,550
Oh, this.

2632
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,230
Not this.

2633
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:58,290
I can't...

2634
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:58,630
What?

2635
02:12:59,030 --> 02:13:00,410
There's only one I can pull.

2636
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:02,430
I can't pull the other thing.

2637
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:05,750
Yeah, so I think I have to do this.

2638
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:07,590
Yeah, see?

2639
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:08,630
I told you.

2640
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:11,030
That's what it fixes.

2641
02:13:11,050 --> 02:13:11,910
Oh, the owl made it now.

2642
02:13:12,610 --> 02:13:14,910
And then, boop, we get launched over.

2643
02:13:15,150 --> 02:13:16,570
And then I send you back up.

2644
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:20,130
And then you leave your clone.

2645
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:21,130
And then I go, boop.

2646
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:22,250
And then you clone.

2647
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:23,990
And then I go, boop.

2648
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:25,650
And then you go up.

2649
02:13:26,610 --> 02:13:26,770
See?

2650
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:28,650
I feel like a little rat.

2651
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:30,290
Rat.

2652
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:32,730
We are the rats.

2653
02:13:34,010 --> 02:13:34,710
There we go.

2654
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:39,670
And then we just go here.

2655
02:13:45,740 --> 02:13:46,240
Oh!

2656
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:48,220
I accidentally pressed A.

2657
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:50,260
It's just an accident.

2658
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:51,880
What?

2659
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:55,580
What?

2660
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:56,600
I agreed with you.

2661
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:57,780
I said sure!

2662
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:00,240
God.

2663
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,260
What?

2664
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:02,320
Gaslighting.

2665
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:03,000
Pretty usual.

2666
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,360
I'm gaslighting?

2667
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:06,540
I said sh- I agreed with you.

2668
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:10,360
Why are you pressing?

2669
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,080
Oh, they're like cuckoo clocks.

2670
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:15,840
But you have to leave...

2671
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:16,720
Do you have to leave your clone?

2672
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,680
Wait, you have to leave your clone on one of them, maybe?

2673
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,280
Yeah.

2674
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:24,240
Yeah, because, like, um...

2675
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,640
Yeah, and then you go back.

2676
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:27,400
There you go.

2677
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:28,800
Oh!

2678
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,460
Rewind that shit.

2679
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:32,440
I'm rewinding?

2680
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:34,220
I think...

2681
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:34,960
Yeah, rewinding.

2682
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:35,800
Don't you have to...

2683
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,240
Oh, can you not rewind and stand on it?

2684
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:39,600
No, I think you have to stand on it.

2685
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:59,270
now what the hell whoa this is like scene punk is who built
this i did because no one else is going to take credit i'll

02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:07,050

just said it in a split second i'll be honest if you really

2687
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:09,430

2688
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:16,370
Yeah, because I did it.

2689
02:15:17,870 --> 02:15:18,210
Yeah.

2690
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:21,950
He was just blabbing on and on about time.

2691
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:23,470
Oh, yeah.

2692
02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:25,690
I built his smile.

2693
02:15:26,650 --> 02:15:28,850
Well, it's true.

2694
02:15:29,990 --> 02:15:30,170
Oh.

2695
02:15:30,490 --> 02:15:31,290
You're never at home.

2696
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:33,330
Yeah.

2697
02:15:33,970 --> 02:15:35,250
Why are you not home?

2698
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:35,710
Huh?

2699
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:38,550
Is it because of Jerry at work?

2700
02:15:39,410 --> 02:15:40,310
I don't know.

2701
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:42,890
Who the fuck is Jerry?

2702
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:44,750
What does he have that I don't?

2703
02:15:45,230 --> 02:15:46,130
Not my choice.

2704
02:15:46,570 --> 02:15:47,110
A job.

2705
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:48,990
What do you mean?

2706
02:15:49,610 --> 02:15:52,470
Being a house husband is a job.

2707
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:55,130
How fucking dare you?

2708
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:57,110
I changed your diapers!

2709
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:01,390
I also changed her diapers.

2710
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:02,330
I come home.

2711
02:16:02,450 --> 02:16:04,250
You went to do engineer stuff.

2712
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:06,430
I'm going to work.

2713
02:16:06,610 --> 02:16:07,490
I'm working hard.

2714
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:08,710
I come home.

2715
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:12,410
You're sleeping on the couch and she's doing her homework
alone in the room.

2716
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:13,590
And I still have dishes to do.

2717
02:16:15,230 --> 02:16:25,430

my fault that you use all the dishes like do you really need

2718
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:35,390

leave your clone i think right

2719
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:40,290

2720
02:16:45,710 --> 02:16:46,170
What?

2721
02:16:46,710 --> 02:16:47,830
Why didn't it press it?

2722
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:48,570
No, I did.

2723
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:49,110
We had to wait.

2724
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:52,950
Look at these clock people.

2725
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:55,510
Wait, what's over here?

2726
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:58,470
What the fuck is over here?

2727
02:16:58,570 --> 02:16:59,790
Where's this other area?

2728
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:03,790
This area is fucking...

2729
02:17:03,790 --> 02:17:04,610
Oh, I found it!

2730
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:05,650
I already found the other bell.

2731
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:10,270
I think that was just a regular bell.

2732
02:17:12,590 --> 02:17:14,110
I found the regular bell.

2733
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:17,230
It's actually beautiful.

2734
02:17:21,410 --> 02:17:22,010
Wee!

2735
02:17:22,850 --> 02:17:23,450
Yay!

2736
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:26,670
Game!

2737
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:27,970
Game!

2738
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:28,750
Where is that?

2739
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:30,350
Mom?

2740
02:17:30,810 --> 02:17:32,410
I'm trying to find you right now.

2741
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:33,870
Jesus Christ.

2742
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,430
This is a huge area.

2743
02:17:37,010 --> 02:17:38,010
The hell tower.

2744
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:38,990
Holy fuck.

2745
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:40,810
We taught our kid the word hell?

2746
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:42,930
What the fuck?

2747
02:17:42,990 --> 02:17:44,410
Okay, how do we play this?

2748
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:48,350
Follow the bubbles and reach the finish line.

2749
02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:49,210
What?

2750
02:17:50,910 --> 02:17:55,930
Oh, it's like spiral where we have to follow the thing.

2751
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:04,770
Come on.

2752
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:05,790
This is not fair.

2753
02:18:06,050 --> 02:18:07,810
Why are you faster?

2754
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:11,030
This is not fair.

2755
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,530
This is not fair.

2756
02:18:12,710 --> 02:18:13,610
You gotta hit start.

2757
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:14,810
You gotta hit start.

2758
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:26,630

other reason there's no other reason there's no other reason

02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:51,530
Whoa!

2763
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:53,750
Yeah!

2764
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:57,750
Not a cope anymore, because I was.

2765
02:19:03,230 --> 02:19:04,870
Oh, the artichoke.

2766
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:06,230
Oh, God.

2767
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:07,730
I think I need to eat another tub.

2768
02:19:08,110 --> 02:19:08,690
Not a cope.

2769
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:09,690
Oh, there's another game over here.

2770
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:10,710
There's another game over here.

2771
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:11,410
Follow me.

2772
02:19:12,830 --> 02:19:13,210
Hey.

2773
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,910
Yay.

2774
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,530
Yay.

2775
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:17,990
Wait, where are you, Gumi?

2776
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:20,110
There's a game right over here.

2777
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:22,710
The chickens.

2778
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:24,650
What is this?

2779
02:19:24,710 --> 02:19:25,410
Oh, it's a shooter.

2780
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:26,730
Did you call it a sheep chicken?

2781
02:19:27,310 --> 02:19:29,670
No, there's a chicken next to the horse.

2782
02:19:31,210 --> 02:19:31,770
There you go.

2783
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:33,830
Get on the horse.

2784
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:36,050
I'm ready.

2785
02:19:38,230 --> 02:19:38,870
Oh, God.

2786
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:39,470
Okay.

2787
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:40,930
Crouch.

2788
02:19:41,930 --> 02:19:44,130
Avoid obstacles to reach the finish line.

2789
02:19:44,290 --> 02:19:45,210
Crouch and jump.

2790
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:46,350
Alright.

2791
02:19:48,310 --> 02:19:49,050
How do I crouch?

2792
02:19:49,890 --> 02:19:50,750
Like, is it pressing?

2793
02:19:51,150 --> 02:19:51,690
It said it.

2794
02:19:52,730 --> 02:19:55,030
Oh, it's like this!

2795
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:56,650
Wee-oo!

2796
02:19:57,970 --> 02:19:58,370
Yay!

2797
02:20:00,330 --> 02:20:00,730
Yay!

2798
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:05,150
Oh my god, look how beautiful my horses.

2799
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:07,370
Wee!

2800
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:08,890
Did that be honest?

2801
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:12,070
I like the horses that look like they're wearing socks.

2802
02:20:12,270 --> 02:20:12,890
You know what I mean?

2803
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:14,430
Oh, I know what I mean, yeah.

2804
02:20:15,230 --> 02:20:29,230
really fancy no no it's not fair no what do you mean it's
not fair when i don't win it's not fair because

2805
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:37,860
of your horse your horse comment i got

2806
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:50,940
your horse comment distracted me how are you missing oh no
i'm stupid.

2807
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:00,970
Is this part of the game?

2808
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:02,970
Is this...

2809
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:04,050
What the?

2810
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:05,530
It kind of reminds me of Bayonetta.

2811
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:06,490
Ooh.

2812
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:08,370
It reminds me of that cheap game.

2813
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:09,310
You know that one?

2814
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:09,910
Catherine?

2815
02:21:11,470 --> 02:21:12,810
Oh my god.

2816
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:14,530
I've always wanted to play Catherine.

2817
02:21:14,850 --> 02:21:16,230
I can play Catherine!

2818
02:21:18,690 --> 02:21:21,250
I wonder if a Catherine will be a good game to stream.

2819
02:21:25,310 --> 02:21:27,410
I've always wanted to play that game.

2820
02:21:29,070 --> 02:21:30,750
It's always been, like, super interesting.

2821
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:34,850
Whoa, no!

2822
02:21:36,010 --> 02:21:37,650
I fell on Hell Tower.

2823
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:39,050
Can you do this for...

2824
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:40,470
Wait, do I have to be there?

2825
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:47,100
Can you just...

2826
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:47,500
Can you just...

2827
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:48,000
Oh, I fell.

2828
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:48,900
Oh, okay.

2829
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,020
I thought you could do it for me.

2830
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:52,780
I fell, too.

2831
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:53,620
Oh, my God.

2832
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:54,640
This is truly as hell.

2833
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:55,860
Is this even worth it?

2834
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:57,460
I don't think this is part of the game.

2835
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,920
I feel like this is not mandatory.

2836
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:05,860
There's no way that this is mandatory.

2837
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:11,720
Dude, why is this so hard up there?

2838
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:14,740
Oh my god!

2839
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:16,060
Are we just bad?

2840
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:20,720
Are we just bad video games?

2841
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:22,100
There's no way.

2842
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:23,020
I thought we were gamers.

2843
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:23,640
What happened?

2844
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,360
I'm at the wall jump part.

2845
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:30,680
Okay, I can just...

2846
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:32,460
Okay, I'm scared.

2847
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:36,640
How do we wall jump here?

2848
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:40,820
Oh, God.

2849
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:42,140
No, that was scary.

2850
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:46,300

2851
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:47,440
No!

2852
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:53,820
Do we have to...

2853
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:57,610
Oh, my God.

2854
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,350

02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:14,750
I can't believe that you distracted me.

2859
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:16,990
I did do nothing.

2860
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:18,550
You distracted me.

2861
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:20,890
I can't believe you do this to me.

2862
02:23:21,250 --> 02:23:21,670

2863
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:22,270

Oh, look at that.

2881
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:44,650
I can't even see the fireworks.

2882
02:24:45,670 --> 02:24:47,650
I can't even see it from here.

2883
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:49,930
You have to...

2884
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:50,850

02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:54,710
So beautiful.

2887
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:57,950
I'm the real gamer.

2888
02:24:58,910 --> 02:24:59,290
It's okay.

2889
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:00,570
I caught us some fish.

2890
02:25:01,030 --> 02:25:02,530
Like a good husband.

2891
02:25:04,690 --> 02:25:07,550
I provided food on the table.

2892
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:13,330
The Hell Tower does not provide food.

2893
02:25:13,650 --> 02:25:14,710
That's all I'm saying.

2894
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:17,050
It provides joy.

2895
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:19,830
Something that you didn't bring to the table.

2896
02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:24,150
Whoa, I'm the fun dad.

2897
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:25,530
I built the castle.

2898
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:27,690
Oh, so we need to move the clouds.

2899
02:25:29,150 --> 02:25:30,930
You have to move the clouds somehow.

2900
02:25:32,910 --> 02:25:33,690
How do we move?

2901
02:25:33,710 --> 02:25:34,630
move the clouds.

2902
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:45,010
It must be something you have to do, because I just rerun
time, and then the rain falls down.

2903
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:47,050
Are you guys freaking out?

2904
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:49,330
It sounds like it's your house, right?

2905
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:53,070
This guy is dancing.

2906
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:54,770
Look at him go.

2907
02:25:54,910 --> 02:25:55,370
He's dancing.

2908
02:25:56,090 --> 02:25:56,990
He doesn't care.

2909
02:25:57,730 --> 02:25:58,750
He's dancing.

2910
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:02,270
Where is it?

2911
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:03,530
I don't know.

2912
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:07,710
I have no idea where it could be.

2913
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:08,070
Oh.

2914
02:26:09,150 --> 02:26:10,150
How do you move it?

2915
02:26:10,310 --> 02:26:11,190
No, that's not it.

2916
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:12,670
Oh.

2917
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:14,090

02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:27,710
And then...

2924
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:28,230
There you go.

2925
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:29,150
They're happy now.

2926
02:26:29,150 --> 02:26:30,450
I don't think that person's dancing.

2927
02:26:30,570 --> 02:26:31,950
I think they were asking for help.

2928
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:32,890
No, no, look at him.

2929
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:33,270

Just a little bit.

You don't know that.

2965
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,220
I can smell it.

2966
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:21,880
I have clones.

2967
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:23,320
The secrets of the smaller towers.

2968

You see?

2969
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:26,960
Here's a thought.

2970
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:28,780
The clone doesn't do enough.

2971
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:30,380
Straight away.

2972
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:33,500
Yeah, we need to get back to our real bodies as soon as
possible.

2973
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:35,060
Don't stress me.

2974
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:36,580
Time is an illusion.

2975
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,040
There's only now.

2976
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:40,060
Can't you feel it?

2977
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,520
He thinks I'm right.

2978
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:42,980
I told him time doesn't matter.

2979
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:46,840
Oh my god, hold on.

2980
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:47,540
Did you know?

2981
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:50,020
Not did you know, but like...

2982
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:53,940
My friend has a little sibling.

02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:57,700
Who's, I think, 19 now?

2984
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:00,800
And...

2985
02:30:01,140 --> 02:30:03,360
He, like, leaves.

2986
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:05,700
A little straw with a toothpaste.

2987
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:10,900
Okay, he leaves a little toothpaste on his little sibling's
toothbrush.

2988
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:11,500
Yeah.

2989
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:12,340

2997
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:22,140
What the?

Yeah, I don't think we know the answer yet.

3004
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:38,860
I think we have to figure it out here.

3005
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:40,820
Where's the bees, cat and dog, sun and moon, no?

3006

3027
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:39,300
Sun.

3028
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:41,980
We did it!

3029
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:42,780
Yay!

3030
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:43,780
Yippee!

3031
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:45,300
Yay!

3032
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:46,280
Yay!

3033
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:49,580
Woo!

3034
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:51,680
Hello.

3035
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:54,340
It's your beautiful husband.

3036
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:55,800
What?

3037
02:32:57,640 --> 02:33:00,980
Because you married me for my looks and charm.

3038
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:04,660
We did it!

3039
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:05,020
Wait, what?

3040
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:06,500
How else did you marry me?

3041
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:09,360
We're gonna bomb the castle?

3042
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:12,120
Oh, yeah.

3043
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:15,500
What's wrong with this?

3044
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:18,000
scheming bombs in our little kids place.

3045
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:19,480
They look dangerous.

3046
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,740
I think they're trying to teach us how to make...

3047
02:33:21,740 --> 02:33:22,880
What?

3048
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,260
Is this subliminal messaging?

3049
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:33,680
Suddenly, once low, castles up.

3050
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:38,460
Alright, my bird.

3051
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:41,100
Wee!

3052
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:41,700
Wee!

3053
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:43,920
Don't worry, I'm not on the list.

3054
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:47,600
Because I'm not American.

3055
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:51,720
Alright, I'm here.

3056
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,780
I made it before you did.

3057
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:56,860
But I can't get off my bird.

3058
02:33:56,980 --> 02:33:58,020
My bird won't let me.

3059
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:00,020
How did you get off the bird?

3060
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:01,420
My bird likes me.

3061
02:34:01,740 --> 02:34:02,600
Oh, okay, I did it.

3062
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:04,840
I had to wait for you to get off the bird.

3063
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:07,160
No, you did not.

3064
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:14,340
It's because my bird likes me too much so she doesn't want
me to get off.

3065
02:34:14,900 --> 02:34:17,040
I think it's because I had control of my bird.

3066
02:34:18,980 --> 02:34:26,560
it it's because it's on green now you have to wait oh yeah
see it's yeah you should have waited you should have waited

3067
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:43,540

3069
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:51,600
Yeah.

3070
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:54,180
Because it goes on the red first.

3071
02:34:57,480 --> 02:34:57,940
There.

3072
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:02,460
What did you do?

3073
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:04,580
Oh, you changed it.

3074
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:05,500
Oh, okay.

3075
02:35:08,300 --> 02:35:08,760
Oh, my gosh.

3076
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:09,840
This takes so long.

3077
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:13,140
Wait, oh.

3078
02:35:13,160 --> 02:35:13,600
Oh!

3079
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:15,300
No, why did you do that?

3080
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:17,920
I didn't need you already.

3081
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:20,660

I think it's fully stopped.

3089
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:32,060
Like the thing.

3090
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:36,060

See, jump, jump through it.

3096
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:42,000
What are you doing?

3097
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,040
I don't trust you.

3098
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:45,940
Oh.

3099
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:48,340
Okay.

3100
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:49,480
And then, yeah.

3101
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:50,320
And what are you doing?

3102
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:51,360
You didn't trust me!

3103
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:52,800
I can tell you this.

3104
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:54,620
I didn't trust me there!

3105
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:59,780
There you go.

3106
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:02,820
You're right, I didn't trust you!

3107
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:06,600
Alright.

3108
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:11,440
I'm spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning,
spinning.

3109
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:15,020
Wow!

3110
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:19,240
What the heck is that?

3111
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:19,820
Force field?

3112
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:20,700
Yeah.

3113
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:35,520
Wait, what do we do now?

3114
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:36,980
Where's our crows?

3115
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:40,040
Oh, there we are.

3116
02:37:40,100 --> 02:37:41,000
I would never forget you, pro.

3117
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:42,080
There we are.

3118
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:44,480
Well, you didn't say anything.

3119
02:37:45,940 --> 02:37:46,680
Oh, wow.

3120
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:49,640
Why can't it go through the force field?

3121
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:52,860
Because I don't think we've, like, we didn't force it
enough.

3122
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:56,100
Wait, we have to...

3123
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:57,900
Oh, I know what we have to do.

3124
02:37:58,280 --> 02:37:59,100
What do we have to do?

3125
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:01,360
Let's see what you can do.

3126
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:02,380
Oh!

3127
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:03,660
Wait, we're just...

3128
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:07,560
You get it from the sky, man.

3129
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:09,340
Oh, this guy!

3130
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:11,380
Oh my god!

3131
02:38:11,620 --> 02:38:12,720
He's got one!

3132
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:13,780
I got the bomb.

3133
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:15,760
Aim.

3134
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:18,160
Oh, okay.

3135
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:19,520
I just aim and throw.

3136
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:20,320
Oh, okay.

3137
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:21,860
I figured it out.

3138
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:22,980
The controls.

3139
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:23,860
I killed mine.

3140
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:26,580
I killed mine, too.

3141
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:29,080
I literally see it alive.

3142
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:30,660
I killed mine, too.

3143
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,060
Look, I'm shooting it from here.

3144
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:34,240
See, I told you.

3145
02:38:34,260 --> 02:38:35,060
I killed mine.

3146
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:41,900
I told you I did it.

3147
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:45,560
What the fuck?

3148
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:46,960
Holy shit.

3149
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:50,840
Oh, I'm here.

3150
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:52,080
Yay!

3151
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:56,520
Why are they stuck down there?

3152
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:57,780
I have to rewind.

3153
02:39:00,220 --> 02:39:01,980
Because I need to bring them back up.

3154
02:39:03,540 --> 02:39:04,100
There you go.

3155
02:39:08,510 --> 02:39:09,050
Yay!

3156
02:39:10,570 --> 02:39:12,270
And then... and then what?

3157
02:39:13,390 --> 02:39:14,310
Go in.

3158
02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:16,790
Is there something we have to do?

3159
02:39:23,380 --> 02:39:24,280
What do we have to do?

3160
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:30,220
They need something.

3161
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:35,600
What the fuck?

3162
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:37,580
Oh, maybe?

3163
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:41,840
Oh, you have to get to wall jump the other side.

3164
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:46,100
I like my bird.

3165
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:48,340
You have to wall jump the other side.

3166
02:39:48,740 --> 02:39:50,820
Gumi, I'm literally doing this right now.

3167
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:51,880
I'm not.

3168
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:53,040
I like my bird.

3169
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:55,860
We can take the bird home after.

3170
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:00,360
That's a cool...

3171
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:00,800
I like this.

3172
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:01,780
I like this mechanism.

3173
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:03,740
I like this.

3174
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:05,100
Yay!

3175
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:07,740
I like my

3176
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:11,940
bird.

3177
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:13,820
You are to me.

3178
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:16,060
I don't like that sound.

3179
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:18,060
Do we really have to follow them?

3180
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:18,560
Yes.

3181
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:19,900
We'll never get out of here.

3182
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:20,940
Fine.

3183
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:22,560
Ladies first.

3184
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:24,300
What the fuck?

3185
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:25,260
Ladies first.

3186
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:27,160
I'm a gentleman!

3187
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,480
I'm letting you go first, see?

3188
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:32,900
We both were to drop down anyway.

3189
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:37,560
What?

3190
02:40:37,960 --> 02:40:39,840
Oh shit, I built this.

3191
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:44,340
Why did I build this?

3192
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:48,680
Yeah, you do something!

3193
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:51,320
Someone help!

3194
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:57,640
Wait, what did you do?

3195
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:59,140
I almost thought we wouldn't make it.

3196
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:01,500
I was a genius, that's why.

3197
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:02,660
I know what you did!

3198
02:41:03,740 --> 02:41:06,040
You put a clone on the other side!

3199
02:41:06,580 --> 02:41:07,540
Oh my god, look tiny rats!

3200
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:08,480
Tiny rats!

3201
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:10,240
Oh my god, look at these rats!

3202
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:10,920
Rats!

3203
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:11,800
Rats!

3204
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:13,940
We are the rats!

3205
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:18,540
Okay, time to rewind.

3206
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:20,780
You're playing a soccer night.

3207
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:21,960
A rat.

3208
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:24,340
Where are you opening?

3209
02:41:25,080 --> 02:41:25,940
Oh, we're close.

3210
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:26,760
the door.

3211
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:28,920
No, we're going up.

3212
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:31,100
Yeah, we close the door and go up.

3213
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:33,080
Both things can happen, Gumi.

3214
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:35,140
You can multitask.

3215
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:38,080
Look, there's us.

3216
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:40,480
There's us.

3217
02:41:42,180 --> 02:41:44,040
Oh my god, it's so beautiful.

3218
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:47,980
I did this smile.

3219
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:51,700
This place is beautiful, but it doesn't make any sense.

3220
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:54,840
Why do you always have to make sense of everything?

3221
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:55,440
Yeah.

3222
02:41:56,500 --> 02:42:08,000

3225
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:27,920
Oh, that's supposed to be normal.

3226
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:29,480
It's so normal.

3227
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:36,640
The dad takes you out to have fun and ha- What the fuck?

3228

Wait, where are we supposed to go?

3231
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:48,080
I'm going here.

3232
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:51,320
I don't know where I am.

3233
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:52,180
Go, go.

3234
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:54,000
Where am I?

3235
02:42:57,790 --> 02:42:59,150
Where are you?

3236
02:42:59,810 --> 02:43:01,570
Wait, I think we went on the wrong area.

3237
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:03,910
Okay, I'm going back to you.

3238
02:43:04,670 --> 02:43:07,150
What do you mean we went on the wrong area?

3239
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:09,250
We went on the wrong side.

3240
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:13,750
Oh my god, it's a keyblade.

3241
02:43:15,690 --> 02:43:16,170
Holy.

3242
02:43:17,550 --> 02:43:18,270
I'm here.

3243
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:20,390
Holy what?

3244
02:43:22,610 --> 02:43:23,490
I'm here.

3245
02:43:24,870 --> 02:43:26,270
Whoa, are you okay?

3246
02:43:27,330 --> 02:43:27,590
Whoa.

3247
02:43:31,070 --> 02:43:32,170
I'm heading over.

3248
02:43:33,930 --> 02:43:34,610
Don't worry.

3249
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:37,070
Fun dad's coming.

3250
02:43:39,150 --> 02:43:39,790
Hello, sweetie.

3251
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:41,150
Fun dad is here.

3252
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:43,770
Are we sure this is the right way?

3253
02:43:45,650 --> 02:43:46,230
Are you sure?

3254
02:43:46,410 --> 02:43:47,390
I feel like we're supposed to...

3255
02:43:47,390 --> 02:43:48,090
Revive it!

3256
02:43:48,270 --> 02:43:49,390
I can reach!

3257
02:43:49,450 --> 02:43:49,950
Oh, I could.

3258
02:43:50,210 --> 02:43:50,410
Okay.

3259
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:52,090
Yay.

3260
02:43:58,680 --> 02:43:59,600
There we go.

3261
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,760
And then you have to put your clone.

3262
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:11,580
And then...

3263
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:12,300
Ta-da!

3264
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:15,360
And then we go this way.

3265
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:18,100
And then clone time.

3266
02:44:19,360 --> 02:44:23,500
I'm glad I'm the time person so I can do less work.

3267
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:32,300
I'm glad this is where I'm at.

3268
02:44:36,080 --> 02:44:38,540
Alright, and then...

3269
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:42,600
I think I have to do it higher up here, right?

3270
02:44:46,820 --> 02:44:47,300
Whoop!

3271
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,200
Where does this turn?

3272
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:55,640
Okay, and then where does this turn?

3273
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:00,040
Then where do you have to go?

3274
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:03,160
Where do you have to go from here?

3275
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:05,020
You've turned it.

3276
02:45:05,540 --> 02:45:08,240
I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning.

3277
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:09,780
Oh, I think I turned too fast.

3278
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:11,360
Where are you supposed to go?

3279
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:12,240
Where are you supposed to go to?

3280
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:13,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

3281
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:17,720
Well, at least you don't have to do it all the way.

3282
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:20,080
Where are you?

3283
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:21,900
Oh, you're here.

3284
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:23,120
Okay, I'm gonna...

3285
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:23,960
Oh, I can't see.

3286
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:28,220
I hate this camera angle.

3287
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:30,600
Ready?

3288
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:31,720
Are you ready?

3289
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:33,520
Just drop down.

3290
02:45:37,830 --> 02:45:38,650
Here, see?

3291
02:45:38,970 --> 02:45:40,770
And then I just turn, I just turn.

3292
02:45:41,330 --> 02:45:44,290
You just have to run with the thing and I just turn.

3293
02:45:45,850 --> 02:45:46,470
Okay, then what?

3294
02:45:47,910 --> 02:45:50,090
I've turned the wrong way, sorry.

3295
02:45:51,250 --> 02:45:52,310
That's what I thought.

3296
02:45:54,510 --> 02:45:55,330
Wait, and then what?

3297
02:45:55,390 --> 02:45:56,570
How do you get to the other side?

3298
02:45:58,350 --> 02:45:59,750
I guess that you put your clone?

3299
02:46:01,070 --> 02:46:02,010
You put your clone or something?

3300
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:03,030
Wait!

3301
02:46:03,370 --> 02:46:04,630
Wait, wait, wait, I see it.

3302
02:46:05,870 --> 02:46:08,410
Yeah, but like you have to you can't get there.

3303
02:46:08,910 --> 02:46:21,630
I told you there's no way you can get there You have to put
your clone Put my clone where I don't know somewhere Why do

3304
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:23,630
you turn it without saying anything?

3305
02:46:24,270 --> 02:46:29,950
You can look at the visuals I'm lucky to see how we get
there.

3306
02:46:30,270 --> 02:46:35,030
Okay, I turned it maybe put a clone here Clone where just
where you're standing.

3307
02:46:35,390 --> 02:46:36,870
Yeah Yeah, yeah, and then we turn.

3308
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:39,430
Yeah, see?

3309
02:46:40,650 --> 02:46:42,070
No, not now!

3310
02:46:44,050 --> 02:46:45,470
What do you mean, see?

3311
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:47,750
Okay, just put that here.

3312
02:46:48,510 --> 02:46:50,010
And now I want to keep turning.

3313
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:52,330
Because it gets closer.

3314
02:46:54,050 --> 02:46:55,990
When I turn it, you see that?

3315
02:46:56,130 --> 02:46:57,070
It gets closer.

3316
02:46:57,810 --> 02:47:00,090
I don't think my club moves with it, does it?

3317
02:47:00,630 --> 02:47:02,670
No, like, the thingy turns.

3318
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:04,450
The thingy gets closer.

3319
02:47:06,110 --> 02:47:14,130
So like, okay, so if I turn it all the way to the other
side, it like gets closer.

3320
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:17,630
Like the other thing gets closer.

3321
02:47:19,710 --> 02:47:20,530
Doesn't it?

3322
02:47:22,310 --> 02:47:24,110
You're pissing me off.

3323
02:47:24,290 --> 02:47:25,570
I'm so confused.

3324
02:47:25,910 --> 02:47:26,650
I'm confused.

3325
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:28,130
My brain hurt.

3326
02:47:29,130 --> 02:47:30,810
My brain hurting.

3327
02:47:32,590 --> 02:47:34,370
My brain hurting.

3328
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:37,370
This went the entire time?

3329
02:47:37,930 --> 02:47:40,070
And you just stopped turning it?

3330
02:47:47,090 --> 02:47:48,810

3331
02:47:49,870 --> 02:47:51,290

3332
02:47:52,110 --> 02:47:52,670

3333
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:54,730
Why did you stop turning it?

3334
02:47:57,690 --> 02:48:00,830
Oh my god, we did it!

3335
02:48:01,910 --> 02:48:04,730
I'm so proud of us!

3336
02:48:04,730 --> 02:48:07,910
I thought there was a limit to how much you could turn.

3337
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:09,170
We did it!

3338
02:48:09,910 --> 02:48:09,910
Yay!

3339
02:48:12,550 --> 02:48:12,910

Oh my god.

3345
02:48:29,210 --> 02:48:29,970
Get over here.

3346
02:48:30,010 --> 02:48:32,010
Wait, I thought we had to do the one year.

3347
02:48:35,070 --> 02:48:36,470
Okay, I'll turn the key.

3348
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:37,930
Okay, I'm coming back to turn the key.

3349
02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:41,830
It's time to turn the keyblade.

3350
02:48:43,150 --> 02:48:43,870
There you go.

3351
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:45,250
Hey, come back.

3352
02:48:45,350 --> 02:48:45,870
What are you doing?

3353
02:48:46,810 --> 02:48:47,930
Don't you want to turn the key?

3354
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:50,970
No, I don't want to turn the key.

3355
02:48:51,130 --> 02:48:51,930
Why not?

3356
02:48:52,610 --> 02:48:54,530
But dad does it again!

3357
02:48:54,890 --> 02:48:56,410
Makes fun for everybody.

3358
02:48:56,730 --> 02:48:57,030
See?

3359
02:48:57,750 --> 02:49:02,370
I'm here to make this a fun, enjoyable time for all the kids
to enjoy.

3360
02:49:05,610 --> 02:49:09,170
Oh, I think we have to go back.

3361
02:49:10,010 --> 02:49:11,390
Not here, but like back here.

3362
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:13,510
Because there's another time thing here.

3363
02:49:14,890 --> 02:49:15,450
See that?

3364
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:17,790
And then there's another one here too.

3365
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:20,010
I think I have to do the wall thing here.

3366
02:49:23,170 --> 02:49:24,950
And then I do this.

3367
02:49:26,730 --> 02:49:26,870
Whoa.

3368
02:49:26,950 --> 02:49:28,570
Okay, and then I do this.

3369
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:31,110
Isn't it great?

3370
02:49:31,230 --> 02:49:33,010
I can just sit back and relax.

3371
02:49:34,930 --> 02:49:36,730
Alright, and then...

3372
02:49:37,850 --> 02:49:38,310
Here you go.

3373
02:49:39,470 --> 02:49:40,810
And then...

3374
02:49:40,810 --> 02:49:42,790
Let me know when you're ready to do that.

3375
02:49:43,590 --> 02:49:45,570
Now you have to jump for this.

3376
02:49:46,150 --> 02:49:46,970
Oh, okay.

3377
02:49:48,470 --> 02:49:49,510
Okay, you ready?

3378
02:49:49,630 --> 02:49:50,170
Okay, I'm ready.

3379
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:52,050
Yeah!

3380
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:55,010
Fun Dad does it again!

3381
02:49:55,910 --> 02:49:57,010
There you go.

3382
02:49:58,090 --> 02:49:58,790
Let me know.

3383
02:49:59,030 --> 02:49:59,570
Boom!

3384
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:04,590
And then...

3385
02:50:04,730 --> 02:50:05,410
Burn.

3386
02:50:08,390 --> 02:50:10,570
Wait till I get lower first?

3387
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:12,090
YUM!

3388
02:50:14,550 --> 02:50:15,010
Yeah!

3389
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:16,850
I know we did it.

3390
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:18,730
Oh, what the fuck?

3391
02:50:18,890 --> 02:50:19,530
What happened?

3392
02:50:20,510 --> 02:50:21,430
I just died.

3393
02:50:21,830 --> 02:50:22,350
Remind it.

3394
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:23,030
Remind it.

3395
02:50:23,410 --> 02:50:24,350
I was too close.

3396
02:50:25,030 --> 02:50:25,550
Wait, what?

3397
02:50:28,190 --> 02:50:29,350
I rewind it.

3398
02:50:29,470 --> 02:50:30,830
How do we...

3399
02:50:31,490 --> 02:50:32,810
Have to be under it?

3400
02:50:33,110 --> 02:50:34,290
No, that doesn't seem right.

3401
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:34,610
Yeah.

3402
02:50:34,730 --> 02:50:35,570
It doesn't seem right.

3403
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:37,750
How do we cut this?

3404
02:50:38,650 --> 02:50:39,690
Well, we cut it already.

3405
02:50:39,970 --> 02:50:42,630
Yeah, but how do we get inside?

3406
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:45,070
Oh!

3407
02:50:45,270 --> 02:50:45,550
Wait, wait.

3408
02:50:46,190 --> 02:50:47,190
Bring him back up?

3409
02:50:47,430 --> 02:50:47,770
Yeah.

3410
02:50:50,790 --> 02:50:51,370
Oh!

3411
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:53,190
You're so smart!

3412
02:50:53,950 --> 02:50:54,990
You're so smart.

3413
02:50:55,290 --> 02:50:55,690
Wife.

3414
02:50:57,770 --> 02:50:58,350
Stop!

3415
02:50:58,810 --> 02:50:59,850
Okay, there we go.

3416
02:51:00,070 --> 02:51:00,610
Bring him.

3417
02:51:02,290 --> 02:51:02,870
Wait.

3418
02:51:03,290 --> 02:51:03,710
Yeah.

3419
02:51:04,130 --> 02:51:04,710
Yeah.

3420
02:51:04,730 --> 02:51:06,990
We did it!

3421
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:08,150
See?

3422
02:51:09,210 --> 02:51:09,610
Teamwork!

3423
02:51:10,450 --> 02:51:11,650
Fun dad, fun dad.

3424
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:12,730
Let's go.

3425
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:17,160
Alright.

3426
02:51:19,900 --> 02:51:20,960
What did... No, we...

3427
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:22,380
Oh, do we have to turn it together?

3428
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:23,720
Are that...

3429
02:51:23,720 --> 02:51:24,700
You think so, going?

3430
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:27,540
No, like, we both have to turn one of it together, right?

3431
02:51:27,660 --> 02:51:29,020
Yeah, because I can't.

3432
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:29,900
I'm too weak.

3433
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:32,020
Fun dad is a little flabby.

3434
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:33,580
Oh!

3435
02:51:39,340 --> 02:51:40,320
Where do we...

3436
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:41,680
The key, is this the key?

3437
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:42,700
Oh, and then we...

3438
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:44,560
The other one turns it down.

3439
02:51:47,960 --> 02:51:48,980
Alright, here we go.

3440
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:51,540
Can we do this?

3441
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:53,400
Yay!

3442
02:51:55,480 --> 02:51:56,480
Oh, shit.

3443
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:57,860
We did it!

3444
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:00,240
Who the fuck's making this shit?

3445
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:02,200
How...

3446
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:03,160
We just...

3447
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:05,980
We haven't even finished one chapter yet, I feel like.

3448
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:10,260
We finished the princess cutie chapter.

3449
02:52:10,500 --> 02:52:11,380
That was a chapter?

3450
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:12,860
Yeah.

3451
02:52:13,460 --> 02:52:14,980
Oh my god.

3452
02:52:15,240 --> 02:52:16,280
What is that?

3453
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:17,520
I don't know.

3454
02:52:19,860 --> 02:52:23,080
Oh my god.

3455
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:23,400
Oh my god.

3456
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:23,860
Oh god.

3457
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:24,720
How do we kill this?

3458
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:26,060
Wait, wait, wait.

3459
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:26,920
There's a time in here.

3460
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:27,480
Distract him.

3461
02:52:27,740 --> 02:52:28,100
Distract him.

3462
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:31,080
I don't think the ball cares, Cody.

3463
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:31,980
Oh!

3464
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,140
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3465
02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:36,440
I need you to lead the ball right here.

3466
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:38,120
Lead him right here.

3467
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:46,580

Bro, what the fuck?

3471
02:53:13,050 --> 02:53:15,270
Okay, oh, I don't have to be next to it to do this.

3472
02:53:15,550 --> 02:53:16,310
Put your clone!

3473
02:53:16,610 --> 02:53:17,610
Put your clone over there!

3474
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:20,070
Oh, fuck!

3475
02:53:20,430 --> 02:53:21,350
It's me again.

3476
02:53:23,910 --> 02:53:24,350
Okay.

3477
02:53:24,810 --> 02:53:26,570
You have to put your clone over there.

3478
02:53:28,610 --> 02:53:29,050
Stoogie!

3479
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:29,890
Shut up!

3480
02:53:29,990 --> 02:53:30,890
Shut up!

3481
02:53:33,710 --> 02:53:34,630
Watch out, mate!

3482
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:35,330
Wimpy!

3483
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:36,110
Okay.

3484
02:53:37,290 --> 02:53:38,510
It's okay, he's distracted.

3485
02:53:40,670 --> 02:53:41,950
I got it.

3486
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:43,690
He doesn't see me.

3487
02:53:43,770 --> 02:53:45,810
He doesn't see me.

3488
02:53:46,690 --> 02:53:47,230
Yeah!

3489
02:53:50,570 --> 02:53:51,710
We got him!

3490
02:53:52,110 --> 02:53:52,590
We did it!

3491
02:53:53,390 --> 02:53:54,250
I got it.

3492
02:53:54,550 --> 02:53:57,630
He doesn't see me.

3493
02:53:58,610 --> 02:54:00,110
Guys, I don't think he saw me.

3494
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:05,280
Ow.

3495
02:54:05,580 --> 02:54:06,820
It's okay he didn't see me.

3496
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:07,840
I can stand here.

3497
02:54:12,830 --> 02:54:13,310
Yeah!

3498
02:54:15,030 --> 02:54:15,810
Wait, what?

3499
02:54:17,130 --> 02:54:17,650
Wait, what?

3500
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:22,230
Okay, it's fine.

3501
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:23,690
It's fine.

3502
02:54:24,030 --> 02:54:24,490
It's fine.

3503
02:54:24,770 --> 02:54:25,150
It's fine.

3504
02:54:25,210 --> 02:54:25,890
It's fine.

3505
02:54:26,810 --> 02:54:28,210
Ow, it's fine.

3506
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:31,110
Give me a second.

3507
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:33,330
It's okay.

3508
02:54:33,410 --> 02:54:33,950
I'm okay.

3509
02:54:34,330 --> 02:54:35,230
He doesn't see me.

3510
02:54:36,310 --> 02:54:36,850
Here you go.

3511
02:54:37,190 --> 02:54:38,330
I can stand here.

3512
02:54:40,850 --> 02:54:41,430
Yay!

3513
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:46,130
Bow down!

3514
02:54:46,390 --> 02:54:47,270
He could stand?

3515
02:54:48,070 --> 02:54:49,430
That should have done it!

3516
02:54:49,630 --> 02:54:50,530
Wow, okay.

3517
02:54:51,110 --> 02:54:52,590
Oh, I got body stabbed.

3518
02:54:52,790 --> 02:54:53,790
Why me?

3519
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:56,450
Why me?

3520
02:54:56,810 --> 02:54:57,350
Why me?

3521
02:54:58,450 --> 02:55:00,090
What did I do?

3522
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:03,430
Don't come near me.

3523
02:55:03,670 --> 02:55:04,510
I'm not ready!

3524
02:55:05,330 --> 02:55:07,710
Don't come near me!

3525
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:11,590
I can't even steal!

3526
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:14,730
I did it.

3527
02:55:15,030 --> 02:55:16,250
I mean, it's okay.

3528
02:55:16,510 --> 02:55:17,870
Thank you for the bait.

3529
02:55:19,470 --> 02:55:20,830
You're pissing me off.

3530
02:55:20,870 --> 02:55:22,850
You're like, leave the club there!

3531
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:24,830
I did it.

3532
02:55:24,850 --> 02:55:25,690
It's a tough one.

3533
02:55:26,070 --> 02:55:27,430
Oh, I'm exhausted.

3534
02:55:29,410 --> 02:55:29,430
Yeah.

3535
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:30,490
We better keep moving.

3536
02:55:30,830 --> 02:55:31,330
Come on.

3537
02:55:33,770 --> 02:55:35,230
We did it.

3538
02:55:35,830 --> 02:55:37,750
I'm so proud of us.

3539
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:39,490
Oh, God.

3540
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:41,550
Yay.

3541
02:55:47,330 --> 02:55:49,310
So hard, I know, right?

3542
02:55:51,050 --> 02:55:55,770
Cody understands the hard work of this marriage.

3543
02:55:57,490 --> 02:55:59,210
I wonder if, like, do you know what?

3544
02:55:59,690 --> 02:56:00,510
Oh, you can.

3545
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:01,910
But, like, why would you?

3546
02:56:02,550 --> 02:56:05,630
I think we have to watch watch jump this, right?

3547
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,100
Do we?

3548
02:56:13,380 --> 02:56:14,860
Why else would, like...

3549
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:15,520
I'm so confused.

3550
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:16,580
Why is it like that?

3551
02:56:21,320 --> 02:56:22,440
Hello, wife.

3552
02:56:22,720 --> 02:56:24,460
I need to eat a thumbs.

3553
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:26,380
Hello, wife.

3554
02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:30,120
I don't understand.

3555
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:31,360
What is this?

3556
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:34,220
Okay, okay, okay.

3557
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:38,240
Alright.

3558
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:39,560
I can do it.

3559
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:41,400
Alright?

3560
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:41,960
Alright.

3561
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:43,700
That's why I don't think so.

3562
02:56:45,480 --> 02:56:45,860
What?

3563
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,740
This doesn't make sense.

3564
02:56:55,380 --> 02:56:56,020
What?

3565
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:57,960
What the fuck do we do?

3566
02:57:01,320 --> 02:57:02,920
Okay, I gotta help you wall jump.

3567
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:05,260
How do I help you wall jump though?

3568
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:09,580
All right, Gumi, you ready?

3569
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:11,200
Uh-huh.

3570
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:14,480
Oh!

3571
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:16,340
I get it!

3572
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:18,740
I have to- Stop moving it!

3573
02:57:21,880 --> 02:57:22,780
I'm okay!

3574
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:25,220
Give it closer to you, see?

3575
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:29,980
I'm making it close.

02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,200
Oh, what?

3614
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:22,900
I don't have a good feeling about this.

3615
02:59:23,060 --> 02:59:23,700
Hey, what's this?

3616
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:25,880
Please jump over?

3617
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:28,480
Hey, you're supposed to calm me down.

3618
02:59:28,620 --> 02:59:29,780
I guess we just jump over.

3619
02:59:29,940 --> 02:59:30,520
What if I just...

3620
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:31,760
Oh, don't stand in the center!

3621
02:59:31,940 --> 02:59:33,060
Don't stand on the center!

3622
02:59:34,540 --> 02:59:36,300
I don't think I was planning on it.

3623
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:37,660
It's Mario Party.

3624
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:38,960
It's the jump rope.

3625
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:41,840
It's the jump rope.

3626
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:42,880
Watch this 360.

3627
02:59:43,020 --> 02:59:43,520
Is this hot?

3628
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:46,520
Weeer.

3629
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:46,940
Oh!

3630
02:59:48,140 --> 02:59:48,580
No!

3631
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:49,820
Wait, you died?

3632
02:59:50,640 --> 02:59:52,920
The chest is not even soft there.

3633
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:55,840
What the fuck?

3634
02:59:56,360 --> 02:59:58,560
I was relying on you to say a lie.

3635
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:00,100
so I can fuck around.

3636
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:04,320
But look at this 360 there.

3637
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:04,840
Wow.

3638
03:00:06,340 --> 03:00:08,060

3639
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:11,260

He was and only took breakdance 20 years.

3670
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:36,230
It's just a hobby.

3671
03:02:36,750 --> 03:02:38,110
The wife was bad.

3672
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Okay.

3673
03:02:38,810 --> 03:02:41,890
Damn, I can't believe the daughter lied on the internet on
TikTok.

3674
03:02:43,830 --> 03:02:45,650
I don't know what's going on, man.

3675
03:02:47,390 --> 03:02:49,230
The mom divorced him?

3676
03:02:49,330 --> 03:02:49,890
I don't want to know.

3677
03:02:50,170 --> 03:02:51,350
I just want to get out of here.

3678
03:02:54,530 --> 03:02:56,790
No, wait, I can't believe the daughter lied.

3679
03:02:58,810 --> 03:03:00,190
I can't believe it.

3680
03:03:03,110 --> 03:03:05,370
Anyway, I can't believe I lied on the internet.

3681
03:03:06,490 --> 03:03:07,990
I'm still fucking, like...

3682
03:03:07,990 --> 03:03:11,430
I'm still, like, registering the fact that...

3683
03:03:11,430 --> 03:03:13,210
The daughter lied about his break...

3684
03:03:13,210 --> 03:03:14,430
Her break dancing dad.

3685
03:03:15,630 --> 03:03:17,570
I don't know what's going on.

3686
03:03:17,730 --> 03:03:19,550
I haven't seen the break dancing dad, man.

3687
03:03:19,830 --> 03:03:22,470
Bro, he was on, like, America's Got Talent!

3688
03:03:23,530 --> 03:03:26,410
I don't know if he actually was on America's Got Talent.

3689
03:03:29,230 --> 03:03:32,250
But he apparently freaked out professionally.

3690
03:03:36,310 --> 03:03:37,590
Whoa, bird!

3691
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:53,720
Once again, we're running out of real estate.

3692
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:55,340
I can't believe it.

3693
03:03:55,420 --> 03:03:56,860
People lie on TikTok like that.

3694
03:03:56,880 --> 03:04:05,000
that i'm still registering the fact that brick dancing dad
was never brick dancing dad story was a lie he's a really

3695
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:12,880
good break dancer you should look him up i'm not going to
look up break dancing dad why not he's a good he won like

3696
03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:27,430
trophies you just don't like dads in general are you talking
to me you don't like fun dads you i took hip-hop dance

3697
03:04:27,430 --> 03:04:31,830
classes and cars You just don't like fun, Dads.

3698
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:33,650
You're right.

3699
03:04:34,970 --> 03:04:37,610
Because I think they're overcompensating for something.

3700
03:04:43,710 --> 03:04:47,010
It's not actual fun, it's fake fun.

3701
03:04:47,290 --> 03:04:48,430
It's fun!

3702
03:04:48,690 --> 03:04:51,090
Everybody enjoys jokey, Dad!

3703
03:04:52,590 --> 03:04:53,970
Not everyone.

3704
03:04:56,870 --> 03:04:58,610
This is why this marriage will never be.

3705
03:04:58,630 --> 03:05:08,270
work you don't appreciate fun dad I think that's why I
wanted to force in the first place you used to like fun dad

3706
03:05:08,270 --> 03:05:16,570
you used to love it what happened I don't think I ever liked
fun dad you only became a dad after we had a kid man you

3707
03:05:16,570 --> 03:05:32,130
used to love fun dad it was so fun there was nothing we just

3709
03:05:41,650 --> 03:05:51,050
yeah we don't have to like move too far which is nice I
think they really wanted us to stress out this game we did

3710
03:05:51,050 --> 03:06:13,190
it yay Luigi wins by doing nothing oh well down we go oh
it's like the the Disneyland like the the tower hotel tower

We're rewinding, but to do this again?

3720
03:06:48,430 --> 03:06:52,030
I like how we're just having a casual conversation while we
do this.

3721
03:06:53,030 --> 03:06:54,870

03:07:59,500 --> 03:07:59,940
Really?

3747
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:00,520
Yeah.

3748
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:01,440
With all the ghosties?

3749
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:04,700
Yeah, because like, it's like super creative, like their
costumes.

3750
03:08:06,360 --> 03:08:15,900

3752
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:36,240
i'm very slowly going down Oh, behind you.

3753
03:08:40,660 --> 03:08:41,540
And then...

3754
03:08:41,540 --> 03:08:42,420
Where does this go?

3755
03:08:42,620 --> 03:08:44,520
I already turned it the most it can turn.

3756
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:45,180
Turn it backwards.

3757
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:45,920
Oh, there it is.

3758
03:08:45,960 --> 03:08:46,960
There is your back.

3759
03:08:48,620 --> 03:08:49,820
No, I don't think so.

3760
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:51,600
Is it not?

3761
03:08:52,420 --> 03:08:54,000
Because I didn't...

3762
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,220
Bring it...

3763
03:08:55,220 --> 03:08:56,520
Oh, no.

3764
03:08:56,880 --> 03:08:57,320
No!

3765
03:08:57,840 --> 03:08:58,720
You went!

3766
03:08:58,920 --> 03:09:00,260
How was I supposed to know?

3767
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:02,520
Because I was supposed to stay on it!

3768
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:03,680
Oh, no.

3769
03:09:03,880 --> 03:09:04,140
Okay.

3770
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:06,520
Hello?

3771
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:07,400
Hello?

3772
03:09:07,780 --> 03:09:09,580
I hate this slow-motion jump.

3773
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:12,260
I'm gonna fall soon!

3774
03:09:15,960 --> 03:09:17,020
Oh, no.

3775
03:09:17,480 --> 03:09:17,860
Okay.

3776
03:09:18,140 --> 03:09:18,380
Okay.

3777
03:09:19,580 --> 03:09:21,280
All right, here we go.

3778
03:09:21,640 --> 03:09:22,820
Oh, there it is.

3779
03:09:24,420 --> 03:09:26,400
I do not have much time left.

3780
03:09:31,710 --> 03:09:34,230
Oh, there's something in front of you in front of you.

3781
03:09:34,790 --> 03:09:37,550
I know, I know the camera keeps automatically turning.

3782
03:09:37,810 --> 03:09:39,030
Oh, oh!

3783
03:09:41,270 --> 03:09:43,710
Goodbye, cruel world.

3784
03:09:45,230 --> 03:09:45,250
Goodbye.

3785
03:09:47,450 --> 03:09:48,570
Where are you now?

3786
03:09:49,270 --> 03:09:50,110
Did I go to this one?

3787
03:09:50,570 --> 03:09:51,570
I don't know.

3788
03:09:52,650 --> 03:09:53,930
Is this one or this one?

3789
03:09:57,250 --> 03:09:57,850
Is that one?

3790
03:09:59,110 --> 03:10:00,690
Stop turning my camera!

3791
03:10:01,070 --> 03:10:02,230
I'm not doing anything!

3792
03:10:02,830 --> 03:10:03,850
I'm not talking to you!

3793
03:10:08,750 --> 03:10:10,290
Apparently you went backwards.

3794
03:10:11,230 --> 03:10:11,690
What?

3795
03:10:14,530 --> 03:10:16,500
Apparently you went backwards.

3796
03:10:20,050 --> 03:10:20,630
Here?

3797
03:10:21,490 --> 03:10:21,850
Okay.

3798
03:10:22,790 --> 03:10:24,810
This has to be the right way, yeah?

3799
03:10:27,290 --> 03:10:28,890
Oh, there it is.

3800
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:30,030
Why can't we?

3801
03:10:30,350 --> 03:10:31,710
I'm so fucking dead.

3802
03:10:31,870 --> 03:10:33,730
There's no way I'm gonna live through this.

3803
03:10:35,710 --> 03:10:37,150
There's something below you.

3804
03:10:39,550 --> 03:10:39,970
This?

3805
03:10:45,250 --> 03:10:47,670
Is this everything?

3806
03:10:49,050 --> 03:10:49,750
Where, though?

3807
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:52,910
Are you really almost there, though?

3808
03:10:53,510 --> 03:10:54,150
Like...

3809
03:10:54,150 --> 03:10:55,530
What happened?

3810
03:10:55,550 --> 03:10:56,810
Why would you build it?

3811
03:10:56,910 --> 03:10:57,570
What did you

3812
03:11:01,330 --> 03:11:01,470
do?

3813
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:02,810
Goodbye.

3814
03:11:04,990 --> 03:11:06,250
Goodbye, Koura.

3815
03:11:07,770 --> 03:11:08,890
I don't know.

3816
03:11:10,610 --> 03:11:12,010
I've tried to take you so...

3817
03:11:12,030 --> 03:11:15,550
Where are you?

3818
03:11:15,890 --> 03:11:17,790
Do I move you or what?

3819
03:11:20,050 --> 03:11:21,370
There's a one here.

3820
03:11:23,090 --> 03:11:23,590
There's one here.

3821
03:11:23,930 --> 03:11:24,950
That's not going backwards, is it?

3822
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:25,590
I don't know.

3823
03:11:25,690 --> 03:11:26,570
I can't tell anymore.

3824
03:11:26,810 --> 03:11:27,630
I feel like it is.

3825
03:11:28,990 --> 03:11:30,010
But maybe it's not.

3826
03:11:31,690 --> 03:11:33,350
I can't tell anymore.

3827
03:11:33,750 --> 03:11:34,150
I can't tell.

3828
03:11:34,150 --> 03:11:35,650
This one is the one that goes up.

3829
03:11:38,010 --> 03:11:39,290
Are you going backwards?

3830
03:11:39,410 --> 03:11:40,110
I can't tell.

3831
03:11:42,390 --> 03:11:42,910
Okay.

3832
03:11:43,010 --> 03:11:44,550
No, no, no, this here.

3833
03:11:46,550 --> 03:11:46,730
Okay.

3834
03:11:48,770 --> 03:11:50,710
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3835
03:11:50,910 --> 03:11:51,690
That thingy.

3836
03:11:51,830 --> 03:11:52,670
Oh, there it is.

3837
03:11:52,770 --> 03:11:53,010
Yeah.

3838
03:11:54,170 --> 03:11:54,850
Okay, wait.

3839
03:11:55,510 --> 03:11:56,570
Wait, you're going...

3840
03:11:56,570 --> 03:11:57,690
Are you going backwards?

3841
03:11:57,850 --> 03:11:58,210
I can't tell.

3842
03:11:58,270 --> 03:11:58,850
I think you are.

3843
03:11:59,050 --> 03:11:59,530
No!

3844
03:12:00,150 --> 03:12:01,050
Oh, you're not.

3845
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:01,390
Okay.

3846
03:12:02,130 --> 03:12:03,950
Okay, we're okay, guys.

3847
03:12:04,890 --> 03:12:06,450

3848
03:12:07,090 --> 03:12:08,350
Oh, okay.

3849
03:12:08,350 --> 03:12:10,530

3859
03:13:10,820 --> 03:13:13,380
Equal distribution of effort.

Wait, we're in a clock.

3868
03:14:18,010 --> 03:14:20,090
Why was there like a house in this clock?

3869
03:14:21,470 --> 03:14:26,810
Dude, imagine being rose and your house is slowly falling
apart and your parents won't wake the fuck up.

3870
03:14:27,790 --> 03:14:29,450
Like, who's gonna be making dinner?

3871
03:14:29,610 --> 03:14:30,350
It's working!

3872
03:14:31,350 --> 03:14:33,230
Our cuckoo clock is working again!

03:14:35,130 --> 03:14:36,310

mom and she blames it on herself.

3878
03:15:27,880 --> 03:15:28,930
A child.

3879
03:15:29,210 --> 03:15:31,310
Tell me we don't have to go through four of these sieges.

3880
03:15:32,970 --> 03:15:33,670
Attraction!

3881
03:15:34,270 --> 03:15:35,630
Oh god.

3882
03:15:37,510 --> 03:15:38,630
We don't need attraction.

3883
03:15:38,870 --> 03:15:40,110
We're getting divorced.

3884
03:15:40,510 --> 03:15:40,930
Aha!

3885
03:15:41,570 --> 03:15:43,290
That's because you lost it.

3886
03:15:43,530 --> 03:15:44,470
But don't worry.

3887
03:15:44,870 --> 03:15:47,590
I'll help you find attraction again.

3888
03:15:48,410 --> 03:15:49,650
Oh god.

3889
03:15:54,410 --> 03:15:56,110
Dude, get this guy off my screen.

3890
03:15:57,550 --> 03:15:58,770
This is abuse.

3891
03:16:01,030 --> 03:16:01,790
This is tortured.

3892
03:16:02,070 --> 03:16:02,690
Let me out.

3893
03:16:04,530 --> 03:16:07,770
You can't force someone to like each other again.

3894
03:16:08,690 --> 03:16:09,010
Holy shit.

3895
03:16:09,530 --> 03:16:09,930
Oh, it's a snow level.

3896
03:16:10,510 --> 03:16:11,230
I've seen this level.

3897
03:16:11,230 --> 03:16:13,210
I did not think this game was this long.

3898
03:16:13,850 --> 03:16:16,510
I told you it was a 14 plus hour game.

3899
03:16:16,650 --> 03:16:17,490
What do you mean?

3900
03:16:18,330 --> 03:16:20,550
Dude, I thought that's because people try to get, like,
every secret.

3901
03:16:20,570 --> 03:16:21,570
some shit.

3902
03:16:24,470 --> 03:16:28,210
Attraction is like a magnet, but you need both poles.

3903
03:16:28,510 --> 03:16:31,110
No, Sal, plus, minus.

3904
03:16:31,810 --> 03:16:32,450
Cody, Meg.

3905
03:16:34,170 --> 03:16:35,110
I'm the plus.

3906
03:16:36,210 --> 03:16:37,910
No, he said plus, minus.

3907
03:16:38,730 --> 03:16:39,610
I'm the plus.

3908
03:16:42,830 --> 03:16:45,350
One is plus, one is minus.

3909
03:16:45,550 --> 03:16:45,710
Oh.

3910
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:47,350
That's not how it works.

3911
03:16:47,750 --> 03:16:49,170
Red is minus, blue is plus.

3912
03:16:49,370 --> 03:16:50,130
Who gets blue?

3913
03:16:50,570 --> 03:16:51,290
It's me.

3914
03:16:53,310 --> 03:16:53,750
What?

3915
03:16:55,370 --> 03:16:56,630
Oh, I'm the plus.

3916
03:16:57,470 --> 03:16:57,930
I got.

3917
03:16:58,230 --> 03:17:02,930
And when a negative plus a negative comes together, it makes
me positive.

3918
03:17:03,170 --> 03:17:04,370
Okay, well, we don't have two negatives.

3919
03:17:04,850 --> 03:17:06,390
We have a positive and a negative.

3920
03:17:06,630 --> 03:17:08,450
The negative comes together.

3921
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:10,230
Yes.

3922
03:17:11,010 --> 03:17:13,230
This is where we had our first skiing trip together.

3923
03:17:13,910 --> 03:17:14,090
Oh my god.

3924
03:17:14,210 --> 03:17:15,370
The two first skiing trips.

3925
03:17:15,430 --> 03:17:16,370
Oh my god.

3926
03:17:16,610 --> 03:17:17,450
That's us.

3927
03:17:18,630 --> 03:17:19,350
What the stuff?

3928
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:20,350
Oh, it's a snow globe.

3929
03:17:20,570 --> 03:17:24,150
We're stuck inside that snow globe we bought there.

3930
03:17:24,890 --> 03:17:28,790
Get to the top of the mountain to receive your next piece of
the letter.

3931
03:17:29,370 --> 03:17:32,650
Yeah, what if we freeze to death trying to get there?

3932
03:17:34,050 --> 03:17:38,310
Use your magnet powers and the attraction will warm you up,
baby.

3933
03:17:38,870 --> 03:17:39,890
Oh, God.

3934
03:17:40,510 --> 03:17:41,610
She did not need to...

3935
03:17:41,610 --> 03:17:43,690
Is he like humping the snow globe?

3936
03:17:44,390 --> 03:17:46,750
He did not need to do that.

3937
03:17:47,810 --> 03:17:50,390
I'm going to break the snow globe the moment we get out.

3938
03:17:50,570 --> 03:17:52,410
It's compromised.

3939
03:17:52,590 --> 03:17:54,230
That was so freaking gross.

3940
03:17:54,510 --> 03:17:55,530
That was pretty gross.

3941
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:56,010
Yeah.

3942
03:17:57,030 --> 03:18:00,430
Guys, how much do we have left from this game?

3943
03:18:00,430 --> 03:18:02,070
I sure hope so.

3944
03:18:02,510 --> 03:18:03,070
Wait, what?

3945
03:18:03,490 --> 03:18:04,110
Get stuck.

3946
03:18:05,490 --> 03:18:06,170
Let me try.

3947
03:18:07,350 --> 03:18:08,250
He he.

3948
03:18:12,850 --> 03:18:14,510
You're not blue, man.

3949
03:18:19,390 --> 03:18:21,450
Wait, why can't you open it anymore?

3950
03:18:22,810 --> 03:18:24,570
Oh, it's because of me.

3951
03:18:26,110 --> 03:18:27,850
Wait, how do I do this?

3952
03:18:31,190 --> 03:18:32,630
I did it!

3953
03:18:34,250 --> 03:18:36,010
You're welcome, Malini.

3954
03:18:37,330 --> 03:18:38,090
Oh, God.

3955
03:18:41,550 --> 03:18:42,670
We have four!

3956
03:18:42,890 --> 03:18:44,450
Oh, we have four.

3957
03:18:44,750 --> 03:18:46,810
Okay, you want LG this level?

3958
03:18:51,890 --> 03:18:53,830
All right, nice.

3959
03:18:57,490 --> 03:18:58,950
Yeah, I'll go fuck myself, I guess.

3960
03:18:59,550 --> 03:18:59,870
Wait, what?

3961
03:18:59,970 --> 03:19:00,850
Do you need me?

3962
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:04,810
I can't do anything here.

3963
03:19:05,110 --> 03:19:05,670
Oh, I can.

3964
03:19:08,850 --> 03:19:10,590
I'll leave this one for you.

3965
03:19:11,610 --> 03:19:12,310
All right, nice.

3966
03:19:12,590 --> 03:19:13,730
Oh, like usual.

3967
03:19:14,650 --> 03:19:14,930
Yay!

3968
03:19:16,130 --> 03:19:16,970
What a team.

3969
03:19:18,210 --> 03:19:19,670
Wait, is there something we should do?

3970
03:19:21,250 --> 03:19:22,010
Oh!

3971
03:19:23,470 --> 03:19:24,430
I'm red.

3972
03:19:26,530 --> 03:19:27,530
What the?

3973
03:19:27,730 --> 03:19:28,670
It launched me.

3974
03:19:28,930 --> 03:19:29,490
Wait, what?

3975
03:19:30,970 --> 03:19:32,210
Where am I?

3976
03:19:33,850 --> 03:19:34,290
Ready?

3977
03:19:35,690 --> 03:19:38,790
What are you doing?

3978
03:19:39,170 --> 03:19:39,530
What the hell?

3979
03:19:39,670 --> 03:19:41,610
It launched me off?

3980
03:19:42,010 --> 03:19:43,810
And then it like...

3981
03:19:43,810 --> 03:19:44,490
What?

3982
03:19:46,290 --> 03:19:46,830
Okay.

3983
03:19:47,270 --> 03:19:49,510
Alright, and then I push this.

3984
03:19:50,310 --> 03:19:51,450
Can I not push this?

3985
03:19:51,590 --> 03:19:52,590
What am I supposed to do?

3986
03:19:54,130 --> 03:19:54,870
Let me...

3987
03:19:54,870 --> 03:19:55,950
Let me...

3988
03:19:55,950 --> 03:19:57,510
Oh, you do it!

3989
03:19:57,730 --> 03:19:58,470
But it was red!

3990
03:19:58,690 --> 03:20:00,130
Okay, you do it.

3991
03:20:01,630 --> 03:20:02,190
Because...

3992
03:20:02,190 --> 03:20:02,750
Oh!

3993
03:20:03,190 --> 03:20:04,510
Yeah, but I'm red.

3994
03:20:04,990 --> 03:20:06,310
And now I do this.

3995
03:20:06,370 --> 03:20:07,530
Don't leave me here, Cody!

3996
03:20:07,890 --> 03:20:08,870
Help me get over!

3997
03:20:09,930 --> 03:20:11,010
Let me go.

3998
03:20:13,310 --> 03:20:14,550
I'm doing it.

3999
03:20:15,790 --> 03:20:16,650
Team work!

4000
03:20:16,850 --> 03:20:17,630
Team work!

4001
03:20:20,310 --> 03:20:24,930
Oh, because it's blue and I'm red and with magnets.

4002
03:20:25,990 --> 03:20:26,750
And then the...

4003
03:20:27,470 --> 03:20:29,770
I just learned how to use magnets.

4004
03:20:35,250 --> 03:20:38,490
I just learned how to use magnets, guys.

4005
03:20:38,690 --> 03:20:39,170
I'm learning!

4006
03:20:39,490 --> 03:20:41,570
See, every day I learned something new.

4007
03:20:42,170 --> 03:20:43,550
Every day.

4008
03:20:44,730 --> 03:20:47,430
Hey, remember our first Christmas with Rose?

4009
03:20:47,650 --> 03:20:49,870
You mean when all the Christmas trees were sold out?

4010
03:20:50,310 --> 03:20:50,470
Yeah.

4011
03:20:51,090 --> 03:20:54,510
We snuck into the woods and cut down one ourselves.

4012
03:20:54,870 --> 03:20:56,090
Guys, how do they work?

4013
03:20:56,710 --> 03:21:00,650
When you have two of the same color, you push them away.

4014
03:21:01,130 --> 03:21:06,790
But when you have like opposite colors, you pull them in.

4015
03:21:07,850 --> 03:21:10,770
Kumi should have taught me this instead of me figuring it
out.

4016
03:21:11,670 --> 03:21:13,310
So opposites attract.

4017
03:21:14,050 --> 03:21:16,750
But if you have two of the same kind, do we tell each other?

4018
03:21:17,010 --> 03:21:17,490
Yeah!

4019
03:21:18,310 --> 03:21:18,650
Yeah!

4020
03:21:18,670 --> 03:21:19,230
Yeah!

4021
03:21:20,310 --> 03:21:21,630
Opposite works as well.

4022
03:21:21,990 --> 03:21:23,790
Oh, so it'll push me up.

4023
03:21:25,170 --> 03:21:29,450
Because opposite same thing, people push each other away.

4024
03:21:30,470 --> 03:21:30,810
Okay.

4025
03:21:33,270 --> 03:21:34,750
It's me, because I'm red.

4026
03:21:37,990 --> 03:21:38,770
And what do you do?

4027
03:21:39,470 --> 03:21:40,870
I need you to pull that to...

4028
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:42,590
I need you to pull that, isn't it?

4029
03:21:43,170 --> 03:21:44,330
I feel like you have to pull it.

4030
03:21:45,070 --> 03:21:45,810
I can't pull it.

4031
03:21:48,110 --> 03:21:49,290
Yeah, I don't reach it.

4032
03:21:50,810 --> 03:21:51,570
Oh, wait.

4033
03:21:51,750 --> 03:21:52,570
There's something else here.

4034
03:21:52,670 --> 03:21:53,370
Oh, there's something else here.

4035
03:21:53,390 --> 03:21:54,510
You're supposed to pull that.

4036
03:21:58,730 --> 03:21:59,050
Yo!

4037
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:09,200
I think I have to pull it all the way.

4038
03:22:10,220 --> 03:22:10,980
I'm pretty sure.

4039
03:22:13,040 --> 03:22:13,460
Stop!

4040
03:22:15,100 --> 03:22:15,900
There we go.

4041
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:19,480
And then...

4042
03:22:20,220 --> 03:22:21,960
And then I pull this.

4043
03:22:22,380 --> 03:22:22,700
See?

4044
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:23,760
I pull this.

4045
03:22:24,520 --> 03:22:25,920
And then you go in.

4046
03:22:26,180 --> 03:22:27,080
And I launch you.

4047
03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:32,980
And then you do that.

4048
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:37,320
And then I can pull it now.

4049
03:22:38,360 --> 03:22:38,900
Oh, I can't.

4050
03:22:38,980 --> 03:22:39,280
I can't.

4051
03:22:39,360 --> 03:22:40,220
You gotta push it more.

4052
03:22:41,300 --> 03:22:43,240
It just barely got on my hands.

4053
03:22:44,600 --> 03:22:45,240
I got it.

4054
03:22:46,820 --> 03:22:47,340
Yay.

4055
03:22:51,940 --> 03:22:53,880
I'm coming over, my love.

4056
03:22:58,280 --> 03:22:59,360
That's fucked up.

4057
03:23:01,300 --> 03:23:03,320
That's fucked up, man.

4058
03:23:04,740 --> 03:23:07,080
I gave you my love.

4059
03:23:09,320 --> 03:23:11,580
And the very next day...

4060
03:23:11,580 --> 03:23:12,460
You gave it up.

4061
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:14,460
You pushed me away.

4062
03:23:20,360 --> 03:23:20,580
Okay.

4063
03:23:24,550 --> 03:23:26,170
Don't leave me.

4064
03:23:26,330 --> 03:23:29,610
You can't run away from this handsome, hunk of a man
forever.

4065
03:23:30,390 --> 03:23:30,610
Ew!

4066
03:23:33,390 --> 03:23:33,750
I

4067
03:23:39,830 --> 03:23:41,630
am a catch, okay.

4068
03:23:45,910 --> 03:23:47,710
I am a 10 out of 10.

4069
03:23:49,670 --> 03:23:52,170
Dude, any guy who tells you that...

4070
03:23:52,170 --> 03:23:53,050
I'm a catch!

4071
03:23:53,210 --> 03:23:54,550
I'm a 10 out of 10!

4072
03:23:55,210 --> 03:23:56,450
No, I'm different!

4073
03:23:57,410 --> 03:23:58,490
Okay, that one's off.

4074
03:23:59,890 --> 03:24:01,410
There, here, I gave it to you.

4075
03:24:01,490 --> 03:24:03,030
I literally gave you the thing.

4076
03:24:03,690 --> 03:24:04,970
Why are you pulling that way?

4077
03:24:05,330 --> 03:24:06,710
Because you need to get the blue!

4078
03:24:07,130 --> 03:24:07,890
Do you get closer?

4079
03:24:08,090 --> 03:24:08,890
Oh, wait.

4080
03:24:08,890 --> 03:24:10,470
Yeah, you need to get the...

4081
03:24:10,470 --> 03:24:10,890
Oh, wait.

4082
03:24:11,010 --> 03:24:12,270
Blue repels.

4083
03:24:19,330 --> 03:24:19,990
No.

4084
03:24:22,410 --> 03:24:22,930
Yeah.

4085
03:24:23,970 --> 03:24:24,550
Yeah.

4086
03:24:25,590 --> 03:24:27,690
I learned magnets.

4087
03:24:28,930 --> 03:24:36,790
I know how magnet works.

4088
03:24:37,110 --> 03:24:37,510
Yeah.

4089
03:24:40,870 --> 03:24:44,050
Oh, you're a thingy.

4090
03:24:45,310 --> 03:24:45,590
A lot.

4091
03:24:47,150 --> 03:24:48,030
A thingy.

4092
03:24:48,410 --> 03:24:49,290
Go for it.

4093
03:24:52,750 --> 03:24:53,870
Why did you do that?

4094
03:24:55,830 --> 03:24:56,730
Why did you do that?

4095
03:24:56,770 --> 03:24:57,470
I'm helping!

4096
03:24:57,730 --> 03:24:57,950
Go!

4097
03:24:58,090 --> 03:24:59,550
Wait, why did you get back?

4098
03:24:59,770 --> 03:25:00,810
How did you get back?

4099
03:25:01,090 --> 03:25:04,150
I was trying to launch off of it!

4100
03:25:04,590 --> 03:25:05,250
All right, go, go.

4101
03:25:05,370 --> 03:25:06,190
Go for your blue.

4102
03:25:11,240 --> 03:25:11,960
There you go.

4103
03:25:12,240 --> 03:25:12,600
See?

4104
03:25:13,640 --> 03:25:15,400
Chat, am I a 10 out of 10?

4105
03:25:15,640 --> 03:25:17,820
Any wife would be happy to have me.

4106
03:25:21,640 --> 03:25:21,860
Right?

4107
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:24,400
Anybody would want me as a husband.

4108
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:30,060
See, look at all the people that said yes, and look at all
the people I ignored that said something else.

4109
03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:35,140
That said something else.

4110
03:25:36,380 --> 03:25:38,860
Clearly, the other thing did not matter.

4111
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:45,900
Damn, 100% people thought I am a catch.

4112
03:25:53,060 --> 03:25:53,460
Wee!

4113
03:25:53,500 --> 03:25:54,460
Fast travel.

4114
03:25:56,280 --> 03:25:56,800
What's this?

4115
03:25:58,000 --> 03:25:58,600
Oh, yes!

4116
03:25:59,420 --> 03:26:00,060
Okay, helping.

4117
03:26:00,240 --> 03:26:00,660
I'm helping.

4118
03:26:05,520 --> 03:26:07,100
Wait, how do we...

4119
03:26:07,100 --> 03:26:08,480
We have to do...

4120
03:26:08,480 --> 03:26:09,620
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4121
03:26:09,620 --> 03:26:10,000
Wait, wait.

4122
03:26:10,580 --> 03:26:11,080

4123
03:26:11,160 --> 03:26:11,340
I got it!

4124
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:12,340
Oh, where am I?

4125
03:26:12,520 --> 03:26:13,520
You have to go to that...

4126
03:26:13,520 --> 03:26:14,520
You see that other blue thing?

4127
03:26:14,580 --> 03:26:15,140
You have to go there.

4128
03:26:15,380 --> 03:26:16,540
There's a blue thing over there.

4129
03:26:16,740 --> 03:26:17,600
Wait, where are you?

4130
03:26:17,620 --> 03:26:18,360
Where did I go?

4131
03:26:19,140 --> 03:26:20,180
You literally went backwards.

4132
03:26:20,220 --> 03:26:21,100
I got launched.

4133
03:26:21,280 --> 03:26:22,160
I got launched.

4134
03:26:22,260 --> 03:26:22,880
Wait, have you died?

4135
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:24,560
Maybe you'll respond next to me.

4136
03:26:24,880 --> 03:26:25,500
You think so?

4137
03:26:26,220 --> 03:26:26,620
Yeah.

4138
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:27,260
Oh, my leg.

4139
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:27,640
Oh.

4140
03:26:28,400 --> 03:26:28,900
Yeah, see?

4141
03:26:29,100 --> 03:26:29,820
You're next to it.

4142
03:26:33,140 --> 03:26:33,540
Yo.

4143
03:26:37,430 --> 03:26:37,830
Weaning.

4144
03:26:42,780 --> 03:26:43,180
No.

4145
03:26:43,640 --> 03:26:44,040
Go.

4146
03:26:44,240 --> 03:26:44,380
Go.

4147
03:26:44,380 --> 03:26:44,780
You have to.

4148
03:26:44,800 --> 03:26:46,660
There's a blue thing over there on the other side.

4149
03:26:47,740 --> 03:26:48,120
What do you mean?

4150
03:26:48,200 --> 03:26:48,540
No.

4151
03:26:49,480 --> 03:26:50,440
What do you mean?

4152
03:26:51,320 --> 03:26:51,720
Oh.

4153
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:54,720
Get off.

4154
03:26:54,900 --> 03:26:55,120
I did.

4155
03:26:56,760 --> 03:26:57,240
No.

4156
03:26:57,820 --> 03:26:58,420
What do you mean?

4157
03:26:58,480 --> 03:26:59,540
That's how you do it.

4158
03:27:01,320 --> 03:27:01,700
Do I?

4159
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:03,520
The blue thing repels, no?

4160
03:27:04,100 --> 03:27:05,200
I repel it.

4161
03:27:05,460 --> 03:27:06,940
No, you have to...

4162
03:27:06,940 --> 03:27:09,760
You get on, and then you get to that blue.

4163
03:27:11,340 --> 03:27:12,240
Is that blue over there?

4164
03:27:13,420 --> 03:27:16,820
Yeah, and then I repel the blue, because I repel it.

4165
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:17,940
Wait, huh?

4166
03:27:18,180 --> 03:27:19,500
Then how do we do this?

4167
03:27:21,940 --> 03:27:23,940
Then you do it

4168
03:27:27,630 --> 03:27:29,230
Yeah, you do it.

4169
03:27:29,310 --> 03:27:30,030
How do you do it?

4170
03:27:32,590 --> 03:27:34,410
I have to pull this over here.

4171
03:27:35,030 --> 03:27:35,970
I guess so.

4172
03:27:36,230 --> 03:27:38,830
Oh, oh, what if I like bring it to you?

4173
03:27:39,110 --> 03:27:39,490
Push it a little.

4174
03:27:39,850 --> 03:27:40,150
Push it a little.

4175
03:27:40,510 --> 03:27:42,430
Yeah, I bring it to you and then you do.

4176
03:27:42,970 --> 03:27:45,410
Oh my god, we're so smart We know magnets.

4177
03:27:45,430 --> 03:27:50,530
Why did you keep telling me to go get pulled by blue when
you know why are you jumping?

4178
03:27:54,510 --> 03:27:55,490
what that was.

4179
03:27:58,450 --> 03:28:00,270
I thought it was a box.

4180
03:28:02,830 --> 03:28:05,050
I thought it was a box.

4181
03:28:07,110 --> 03:28:07,630
Oh, God.

4182
03:28:07,890 --> 03:28:08,610
I got to go to sleep.

4183
03:28:08,970 --> 03:28:09,810
I think you're right.

4184
03:28:14,120 --> 03:28:15,940
We're rekindling our love.

4185
03:28:16,740 --> 03:28:17,960
Oh, my God.

4186
03:28:18,680 --> 03:28:20,200
Do I have anything in my pants?

4187
03:28:21,320 --> 03:28:21,580
What?

4188
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:24,980
We're rekindling our love.

There's no way I actually wrote that.

4199
03:29:25,860 --> 03:29:26,200
That's so good.

4200
03:29:26,980 --> 03:29:28,380
There's a guy who...

4201
03:29:28,380 --> 03:29:29,820
There has to be a joke.

4202
03:29:29,880 --> 03:29:35,740
It was a real life story, but the guy was like, my name is
Jarman, and boy do I love breast milk.

The two are completely different schools of thought.

4219
03:31:10,650 --> 03:31:19,310
What did they say?

4220
03:31:20,090 --> 03:31:24,050
They're like, please don't group us together with those who
like milk.

4221
03:31:24,710 --> 03:31:26,970
We're just going to get crazy ideas.

03:31:30,470 --> 03:31:32,490
Oh my god.

And some people like Thaz.

4225
03:31:41,570 --> 03:31:44,170
The ancient ninja rivalry.

4226
03:31:45,250 --> 03:31:46,030
But is it me?

4227
03:31:47,210 --> 03:31:47,710
I don't know.

4228
03:31:47,790 --> 03:31:48,770
Am I supposed to push it?

4229
03:31:49,090 --> 03:31:49,990
Oh, I think you pull it.

03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:51,170
Yeah, it's me.

4231
03:31:52,670 --> 03:31:54,030
Then you have to press this button.

4232
03:31:55,990 --> 03:31:56,890
Wait, what?

4233
03:32:00,510 --> 03:32:01,070
What?

4234
03:32:01,590 --> 03:32:02,950
This opens something.

4235
03:32:04,110 --> 03:32:04,310
Right?

4236
03:32:04,590 --> 03:32:06,990
It lifts this rock up, but...

4237
03:32:06,990 --> 03:32:08,750
But, like, what does that do?

4238
03:32:12,750 --> 03:32:13,190
Confused.

4239
03:32:21,090 --> 03:32:22,550
What are you supposed to do here?

4240
03:32:22,990 --> 03:32:23,330

03:32:42,880 --> 03:32:43,580
Why do you keep doing this?

4250
03:32:45,940 --> 03:32:48,080
Why do you keep doing this?

4251
03:32:55,140 --> 03:32:56,260
Time learning.

4252
03:32:58,040 --> 03:32:59,060
It goes nothing.

03:35:16,720 --> 03:35:17,040
Okay.

4288
03:35:17,780 --> 03:35:18,300
There we go.

4289
03:35:19,400 --> 03:35:19,860
Big.

4290
03:35:20,460 --> 03:35:21,560
Not big anymore.

4291
03:35:22,180 --> 03:35:23,400
Hold on, I need to vote real quick.

4292
03:35:24,040 --> 03:35:24,760
Wait, what do you mean?

4293
03:35:26,020 --> 03:35:27,140
Why do you need a vote?

4294
03:35:28,460 --> 03:35:30,040
Because we're the one that's...

4295
03:35:30,040 --> 03:35:31,690
I'm literally married to you.

4296
03:35:34,980 --> 03:35:35,300
What?

4297
03:35:36,700 --> 03:35:37,920
Why do you need a vote?

4298
03:35:38,040 --> 03:35:39,100
I don't understand.

4299
03:35:43,840 --> 03:35:44,760
Look, see?

4300
03:35:44,920 --> 03:35:46,580
More people think I'm a catch!

4301
03:35:47,040 --> 03:35:49,320
And then the other's opinions don't matter.

4302
03:35:53,620 --> 03:36:09,840
so it's a hundred percent right it's a hundred percent i
knew it i knew it i knew it i think this is how men egos

4303
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:20,720

fuck do you mean i'm a 10 out of 10 What?

4304
03:36:21,080 --> 03:36:24,160
You're the worst husband of I've ever been married to.

4305
03:36:24,700 --> 03:36:26,540
You had multiple husbands?

4306
03:36:27,620 --> 03:36:29,940
I thought you had multiple wives, not husbands.

4307
03:36:30,800 --> 03:36:31,420
Hey, man.

4308
03:36:32,060 --> 03:36:34,260
Have you seen 707 from Mystic Messenger?

4309
03:36:34,820 --> 03:36:35,180
Damn.

4310
03:36:35,960 --> 03:36:36,780
You know what?

4311
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:38,320
I don't know.

4312
03:36:38,460 --> 03:36:41,040
This is exactly why I'm getting a divorce.

4313
03:36:41,580 --> 03:36:47,040
I'm going to find somebody that's going to appreciate me as
a husband.

4314
03:36:49,540 --> 03:36:50,440
What do I do here?

4315
03:36:50,840 --> 03:36:51,420
I don't know.

4316
03:36:51,640 --> 03:36:52,140
Launch off of it.

4317
03:36:52,360 --> 03:36:54,140
But what am I throwing?

4318
03:36:55,060 --> 03:36:55,420
This?

4319
03:36:56,540 --> 03:36:58,740
Oh, I'm giving you magnets!

4320
03:37:00,580 --> 03:37:01,220
Take it.

4321
03:37:06,390 --> 03:37:07,430
Did you fall?

4322
03:37:10,920 --> 03:37:11,660
What are you doing?

4323
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:17,640
You see, my new wife is gonna figure this out faster.

4324
03:37:21,460 --> 03:37:22,180
What are you doing?

4325
03:37:23,580 --> 03:37:25,460
I'm not doing puzzles for us.

4326
03:37:25,660 --> 03:37:26,900

4327
03:37:33,300 --> 03:37:37,020
It's fucked up What the fuck?

4328
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:41,040

4335
03:38:40,060 --> 03:38:42,020
I think I need to cut my hair.

4336
03:38:42,400 --> 03:38:42,920
What?

4337
03:38:44,380 --> 03:38:45,480
I think I need to cut my hair.

4338
03:38:46,860 --> 03:38:50,040

4339
03:38:50,560 --> 03:38:52,720

03:38:55,200 --> 03:38:56,460

4352
03:39:48,140 --> 03:39:48,960

03:39:51,640 --> 03:39:52,600
We're over.

4354
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:56,640
Did you... Did you overdose on the fun?

4355
03:39:57,500 --> 03:39:59,100
Did you just have too much fun?

4356
03:39:59,280 --> 03:39:59,920
I understand.

4357
03:40:01,320 --> 03:40:02,220
No, I don't think so.

4358
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:03,620
I understand.

4359
03:40:03,660 --> 03:40:05,780
Get on the owls and go on the other side.

4360
03:40:07,580 --> 03:40:09,540
I'm on the other side of the tower.

4361
03:40:10,060 --> 03:40:12,260
Like, really other side.

4362
03:40:15,160 --> 03:40:15,920

03:40:18,760 --> 03:40:21,760
I think you're back to being wife number four.

4365
03:40:22,160 --> 03:40:24,600
I was always wife number four.

4366
03:40:24,840 --> 03:40:27,020
You got promoted to wife number two.

4367
03:40:27,080 --> 03:40:27,700
Do you know what?

4368
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:29,700
Now you're wife number five.

4369
03:40:29,820 --> 03:40:30,280
What?

4370
03:40:30,600 --> 03:40:32,040
Why did I get a new one?

4371
03:40:32,680 --> 03:40:34,140
What did I do?

4372
03:40:34,680 --> 03:40:35,320
What did I do?

4373
03:40:35,480 --> 03:40:36,200
Say that again.

4374
03:40:36,760 --> 03:40:37,740
Say that again.

4375
03:40:39,200 --> 03:40:41,440
Say that again.

4376
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:42,740
Say that again.

4377
03:40:44,800 --> 03:40:45,460
Say that again.

4378
03:40:50,620 --> 03:40:53,480
Gonna be back in my white spot right now.

4379
03:40:58,240 --> 03:41:00,580
Okay, for both of us, we need...

4380
03:41:00,580 --> 03:41:01,760
We need to do the puzzle!

4381
03:41:04,300 --> 03:41:05,420
Give it a puzzle!

4382
03:41:06,340 --> 03:41:08,940
You can't hold a hot ass robot forever.

4383
03:41:09,780 --> 03:41:11,260
Alright, I can grab more.

4384
03:41:12,600 --> 03:41:13,480
Come on.

4385
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:15,540
Oh my god, do it a puzzle!

4386
03:41:19,180 --> 03:41:21,000
I got homing missiles.

4387
03:41:21,340 --> 03:41:22,340
This is fucked up.

4388
03:41:22,760 --> 03:41:24,200
This is fucked up.

4389
03:41:28,590 --> 03:41:29,930
Then, what do I have to do?

4390
03:41:31,030 --> 03:41:31,730
Wallchup, man.

4391
03:41:31,770 --> 03:41:32,090
Oh, here.

4392
03:41:32,230 --> 03:41:33,870
I couldn't tell where the walls were.

4393
03:41:35,370 --> 03:41:37,150
What do you mean?

4394
03:41:37,850 --> 03:41:40,270
I can hold on to this for just a little bit.

4395
03:41:41,030 --> 03:41:42,390
I don't think you have to pull.

4396
03:41:42,530 --> 03:41:42,870
Let go.

4397
03:41:44,470 --> 03:41:45,310
Wait, wait, wait.

4398
03:41:45,710 --> 03:41:46,750
Okay, now let go.

4399
03:41:50,170 --> 03:41:50,810
Wait, what?

4400
03:41:52,230 --> 03:41:53,730
Wait, what?

4401
03:41:54,010 --> 03:41:54,330
Okay.

4402
03:41:55,370 --> 03:41:55,890
Stay?

4403
03:41:56,270 --> 03:41:56,690
Yeah.

4404
03:41:59,830 --> 03:42:01,390
Oh, you don't let go.

4405
03:42:01,630 --> 03:42:02,150
Oh, whoops.

4406
03:42:02,910 --> 03:42:03,770
Do you do that again?

4407
03:42:06,430 --> 03:42:09,090
Fun dad, fun dad, yeah.

4408
03:42:10,930 --> 03:42:12,270
Fun dad's here.

4409
03:42:13,390 --> 03:42:15,010
Fun dad, fun dad.

4410
03:42:16,730 --> 03:42:17,830
I'm so fun.

4411
03:42:19,310 --> 03:42:19,770
Oh!

4412
03:42:20,510 --> 03:42:21,890
Why did you...

4413
03:42:22,710 --> 03:42:23,950
I had to do that again.

4414
03:42:25,910 --> 03:42:26,830
Don't worry.

4415
03:42:26,990 --> 03:42:28,810
That means more time for fun dad.

4416
03:42:30,150 --> 03:42:30,710
Come on.

4417
03:42:30,950 --> 03:42:32,050
Get me out of here.

4418
03:42:32,050 --> 03:42:33,610
More time to spend for fun dad.

4419
03:42:33,890 --> 03:42:34,750
Yay!

4420
03:42:36,450 --> 03:42:37,750
Oh, God.

4421
03:42:39,790 --> 03:42:41,470
Oh, my God.

4422
03:42:43,170 --> 03:42:45,350
Longer time before that.

4423
03:42:46,370 --> 03:42:46,810
Yay!

4424
03:42:50,970 --> 03:42:51,410
Woo!

4425
03:42:54,070 --> 03:42:54,970
Okay, I'm ready.

4426
03:42:55,730 --> 03:42:56,990
You have to take me to the other side again.

4427
03:43:03,210 --> 03:43:03,650
Nice.

4428
03:43:04,810 --> 03:43:05,510
I'm here.

4429
03:43:10,190 --> 03:43:10,630
Yeah!

4430
03:43:18,230 --> 03:43:19,110
Oh, God.

4431
03:43:19,430 --> 03:43:20,770
We did it!

4432
03:43:21,590 --> 03:43:22,030
Handcake!

4433
03:43:22,950 --> 03:43:24,910
Oh my God, there's food!

4434
03:43:25,610 --> 03:43:27,330
Can I have- can I borrow like $5?

4435
03:43:28,310 --> 03:43:28,750
No!

4436
03:43:29,470 --> 03:43:30,090
You're right.

4437
03:43:30,290 --> 03:43:31,550
We have- we share a bank account.

4438
03:43:32,450 --> 03:43:35,050
I already cut you off from- It's okay.

4439
03:43:35,730 --> 03:43:36,890
We share a bank account.

4440
03:43:37,230 --> 03:43:37,570
It's okay.

4441
03:43:37,590 --> 03:43:39,930
I moved all the funds back to my personal bank account.

4442
03:43:40,110 --> 03:43:41,310
Wait, that's so fucked up!

4443
03:43:41,350 --> 03:43:42,590
You can't do that legally!

4444
03:43:45,450 --> 03:43:46,770
We're getting divorced.

4445
03:43:47,210 --> 03:43:47,910
We can't.

4446
03:43:47,930 --> 03:43:48,650
We're getting.

4447
03:43:48,990 --> 03:43:51,330
We're not divorced yet.

4448
03:43:51,630 --> 03:43:52,210
Out here?

4449
03:43:53,110 --> 03:43:54,710
I don't trust you with fun.

4450
03:43:55,750 --> 03:43:56,330
What do you mean?

4451
03:43:56,390 --> 03:43:57,310
Don't trust my fun.

4452
03:43:57,470 --> 03:43:58,150
I'm so fun.

4453
03:43:58,230 --> 03:44:00,170
We have to head to the other tower.

4454
03:44:01,530 --> 03:44:02,430
I'm at the other tower.

4455
03:44:03,950 --> 03:44:04,250
Hi.

4456
03:44:04,630 --> 03:44:06,430
We gotta free these guys.

4457
03:44:07,410 --> 03:44:08,250
Free these nuts.

4458
03:44:08,370 --> 03:44:09,330
The big wheels turning.

4459
03:44:09,490 --> 03:44:09,790
Oh, wait.

4460
03:44:11,570 --> 03:44:12,650
Get over here.

4461
03:44:15,390 --> 03:44:17,170
Fun Dad's waiting for the fun.

4462
03:44:19,150 --> 03:44:19,410
Bad move.

4463
03:44:19,490 --> 03:44:22,450
Yeah, if you do that, my lawyer has a case for me.

4464
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:28,730
We signed a prenup.

4465
03:44:29,330 --> 03:44:31,270
No, I did and I forgot to sign it.

4466
03:44:31,510 --> 03:44:33,490
No, you have to go to the other...

4467
03:44:33,490 --> 03:44:34,730
Oh, wait, no, I have to.

4468
03:44:35,510 --> 03:44:37,390
Wait, no, you have to because of tracks.

4469
03:44:44,440 --> 03:44:46,120
Alright, what do you have to do now?

4470
03:44:46,480 --> 03:44:47,360
You need to turn it.

4471
03:44:47,440 --> 03:44:48,160
You need to turn it.

4472
03:44:49,360 --> 03:44:51,360
I turn, I turn, I turn.

4473
03:44:51,500 --> 03:44:52,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4474
03:44:52,220 --> 03:44:53,020
Okay, keep turning.

4475
03:44:53,240 --> 03:44:53,780
I turn.

4476
03:44:56,180 --> 03:44:57,040
Here I am.

4477
03:44:58,400 --> 03:44:59,160
I'm here now.

4478
03:44:59,380 --> 03:44:59,740
Yay!

4479
03:45:01,620 --> 03:45:02,960
I did it!

4480
03:45:04,060 --> 03:45:04,800
I'm up.

4481
03:45:07,620 --> 03:45:08,500
And then...

4482
03:45:08,500 --> 03:45:09,060
Okay.

4483
03:45:14,160 --> 03:45:15,220
Oh my god, we're so smart.

4484
03:45:15,260 --> 03:45:16,340
This is why we're perfect for each other.

4485
03:45:19,380 --> 03:45:20,520
You have to pull this?

4486
03:45:23,480 --> 03:45:26,000
What does the opposite to track mean?

4487
03:45:27,280 --> 03:45:28,680
Yeah, so you pull it down.

4488
03:45:29,580 --> 03:45:31,420
Get on the freaking thing.

4489
03:45:37,660 --> 03:45:39,140
I didn't know that...

4490
03:45:39,140 --> 03:45:39,920
I didn't know that...

4491
03:45:39,920 --> 03:45:40,900
I didn't know that I was on the elevator.

4492
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:43,020
I didn't...

4493
03:45:43,020 --> 03:45:44,760
I didn't know it was an elevator!

4494
03:45:48,720 --> 03:45:50,480
Get on the freaking thing.

4495
03:45:54,200 --> 03:45:55,240
Context clues!

4496
03:45:55,540 --> 03:45:58,080
Where are my explicit context clues?

4497
03:46:02,530 --> 03:46:04,550
Oh, there's a fence wheel!

4498
03:46:04,870 --> 03:46:07,850
Hey, hey, it looks like that gondola lift is working.

4499
03:46:08,110 --> 03:46:09,070
Hurry, let's catch it.

4500
03:46:09,070 --> 03:46:10,250
There's a gondola lift?

4501
03:46:10,910 --> 03:46:11,770
Yeah, over here.

4502
03:46:12,150 --> 03:46:12,490
Oh, it's over there!

4503
03:46:13,230 --> 03:46:14,490
We go to the gondola!

4504
03:46:17,070 --> 03:46:18,830
Whoa, this guy is huge.

4505
03:46:19,270 --> 03:46:19,710
Whoa!

4506
03:46:21,270 --> 03:46:23,210
Wait, I can, like, make this go fast.

4507
03:46:26,010 --> 03:46:27,030
That's the king right, have fun!

4508
03:46:27,030 --> 03:46:28,430
Dude, I love those rides.

4509
03:46:28,650 --> 03:46:30,370
I love those rides at a carnival.

4510
03:46:31,590 --> 03:46:32,270
Fun forever!

4511
03:46:34,690 --> 03:46:37,090
That's right, you're all gonna have fun forever!

4512
03:46:38,490 --> 03:46:39,110
What the hell?

4513
03:46:40,910 --> 03:46:41,990
I'm going to the gondola.

4514
03:46:42,550 --> 03:46:43,530
How do you get to the gondola?

4515
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:49,240
Opposite attract.

4516
03:46:51,200 --> 03:46:52,700
Wait, it won't let me get on.

4517
03:46:53,360 --> 03:46:54,520
How do I- Oh, there it is!

4518
03:46:55,660 --> 03:46:56,580
Are you okay?

4519
03:46:57,780 --> 03:46:58,840
Yeah, that was me stretching.

4520
03:46:59,640 --> 03:47:00,200
I'm heading out.

4521
03:47:00,340 --> 03:47:01,380
I'm getting there.

4522
03:47:01,480 --> 03:47:01,800
Don't worry.

4523
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:02,880
The gondola's working.

4524
03:47:04,520 --> 03:47:06,120
It's a ferris wheel, man.

4525
03:47:06,500 --> 03:47:07,440
No, it's a gondola!

4526
03:47:09,220 --> 03:47:09,520
See?

4527
03:47:12,320 --> 03:47:13,360
And then...

4528
03:47:13,360 --> 03:47:16,760
Why didn't you want to go on the ferris wheel with me?

4529
03:47:17,840 --> 03:47:19,040
And then we go down there.

4530
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:21,820
Because you tried to beat my ass with snowballs.

4531
03:47:22,400 --> 03:47:22,400
Yay!

4532
03:47:22,900 --> 03:47:24,320
You started it!

4533
03:47:25,660 --> 03:47:26,080
What?

4534
03:47:26,480 --> 03:47:27,880
Hey, an aquarium!

4535
03:47:29,020 --> 03:47:29,460
What?

4536
03:47:39,380 --> 03:47:41,620
Yeah, that's right, I said it.

4537
03:47:49,390 --> 03:47:50,690
How do we turn this?

4538
03:47:50,750 --> 03:47:51,590
How did you get it?

4539
03:47:51,650 --> 03:47:53,010
Oh, there's how you get in there.

4540
03:47:57,250 --> 03:47:58,230
I'm pushing.

4541
03:47:58,370 --> 03:48:00,370
Why aren't you pushing?

4542
03:48:02,110 --> 03:48:02,870
Fun?

4543
03:48:03,970 --> 03:48:03,970
Dad?

4544
03:48:08,210 --> 03:48:10,370
Dude, the thing is my character won't move.

4545
03:48:10,930 --> 03:48:12,450
Wait, why are you stuck?

4546
03:48:13,090 --> 03:48:13,810
Just kidding.

4547
03:48:14,630 --> 03:48:16,430
I'm moving now.

4548
03:48:21,250 --> 03:48:23,430
Look, this is a gondola, okay?

4549
03:48:26,690 --> 03:48:28,290
Oh, so that's a mini gondola.

4550
03:48:29,930 --> 03:48:31,350
We made it.

4551
03:48:31,350 --> 03:48:32,510
It's a minigun, right?

4552
03:48:32,530 --> 03:48:33,570
My ears are still ringing.

4553
03:48:35,070 --> 03:48:37,430
Why didn't you want to do the fairy spiel with me?

4554
03:48:37,690 --> 03:48:38,470
It's romantic.

4555
03:48:38,650 --> 03:48:38,870
Me too.

4556
03:48:40,230 --> 03:48:41,070
It's romantic.

4557
03:48:41,310 --> 03:48:43,310
That's the shop where I got your Christmas gift.

4558
03:48:43,350 --> 03:48:44,730
Get away from me.

4559
03:48:44,950 --> 03:48:45,530
What do you mean?

4560
03:48:45,630 --> 03:48:46,610
We're husband and wife.

4561
03:48:46,970 --> 03:48:47,610
Before we got here.

4562
03:48:48,170 --> 03:48:49,010
I wanted a boy.

4563
03:48:50,430 --> 03:48:51,650
Get away from me.

4564
03:48:52,030 --> 03:48:53,370
Give daddy a kiss.

4565
03:48:55,010 --> 03:48:55,110
No!

4566
03:48:55,610 --> 03:48:56,030
No!

4567
03:48:56,430 --> 03:48:56,550
No!

4568
03:48:59,930 --> 03:49:02,250
I can't fit it in my Christmas presents.

4569
03:49:02,290 --> 03:49:03,290
You still like it.

4570
03:49:03,310 --> 03:49:04,190
What happened to the Christmas?

4571
03:49:05,130 --> 03:49:06,330
You still like this.

4572
03:49:09,950 --> 03:49:12,330
I don't want a kiss.

4573
03:49:15,670 --> 03:49:17,290
Run, go on here.

4574
03:49:19,450 --> 03:49:24,130
We can fix this marriage if we just give each other a little
kiss.

4575
03:49:25,150 --> 03:49:26,890
I don't want a kiss.

4576
03:49:28,770 --> 03:49:29,730
That's a party.

4577
03:49:37,310 --> 03:49:39,050
I'm taking his hat.

4578
03:49:39,050 --> 03:49:39,810
Oh, look at me!

4579
03:49:39,970 --> 03:49:40,790
I have this hat!

4580
03:49:40,790 --> 03:49:43,130
This one fits perfectly.

4581
03:49:44,310 --> 03:49:44,790
I haven't.

4582
03:49:44,850 --> 03:49:45,510
Look at my hat.

4583
03:49:45,750 --> 03:49:47,090
I'm not compensating for anything.

4584
03:49:49,190 --> 03:49:51,050
I just think it's a really nice hat.

4585
03:49:55,090 --> 03:49:58,350
Sad for another child that thinks our marriage.

4586
03:50:00,630 --> 03:50:01,810
Why is this guy?

4587
03:50:01,950 --> 03:50:03,330
Oh my god, look at this guy.

4588
03:50:03,450 --> 03:50:03,850
He's T-posing.

4589
03:50:04,150 --> 03:50:04,730
Look at him.

4590
03:50:05,410 --> 03:50:05,930
Oh, look at him.

4591
03:50:05,930 --> 03:50:07,870
Oh, we're gonna be bobsledding.

4592
03:50:08,210 --> 03:50:08,710
Hey, Cody.

4593
03:50:09,250 --> 03:50:10,170
Nice hat.

4594
03:50:10,590 --> 03:50:11,150
Oh, yeah.

4595
03:50:11,750 --> 03:50:12,360
Hey, nice hat.

4596
03:50:18,120 --> 03:50:18,760
That's right.

4597
03:50:18,820 --> 03:50:19,980
I'm a better button masher.

4598
03:50:22,640 --> 03:50:25,420
Can we review the second game?

4599
03:50:25,920 --> 03:50:26,100
Woo!

4600
03:50:28,220 --> 03:50:29,220
So give me go.

4601
03:50:31,340 --> 03:50:31,840
Yeah.

4602
03:50:34,200 --> 03:50:35,380
Dad's winning.

4603
03:50:36,420 --> 03:50:37,680
Because I know how to have fun.

4604
03:50:38,980 --> 03:50:40,560
Let me go.

4605
03:50:46,700 --> 03:50:48,780
I want to take a napie.

4606
03:50:49,260 --> 03:50:50,000
Oh, no, I missed.

4607
03:50:51,160 --> 03:50:52,440
I missed the ride.

4608
03:50:53,540 --> 03:50:54,640
Didn't see it.

4609
03:50:56,560 --> 03:50:57,260
Okay, nice.

4610
03:50:58,000 --> 03:50:58,720
We're going.

4611
03:51:00,660 --> 03:51:02,260
I have racing games experience.

4612
03:51:02,740 --> 03:51:12,900

your poll come on uh-huh

4620
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:36,080
It just means I won't make this marriage to work.

4621
03:52:36,580 --> 03:52:38,940
It means I put more effort in trying to fix this marriage.

4622
03:52:39,020 --> 03:52:41,140
No, it means you're more dependent on my mind.

4623
03:52:41,540 --> 03:52:42,840
It means I'm trying.

4624
03:52:42,840 --> 03:52:45,520
He has killed many the surface.

4625
03:52:47,120 --> 03:52:48,140
I need it.

4626
03:52:48,140 --> 03:52:49,460
And I need it.

4627
03:52:51,060 --> 03:52:51,880
Water level?

4628
03:52:52,980 --> 03:52:54,000
That looks chilly.

4629
03:52:54,600 --> 03:52:55,980
I don't do well in cold water.

4630
03:52:56,240 --> 03:52:57,620
No, not water level.

4631
03:52:58,500 --> 03:53:00,560
Should we put the water level for next time?

4632
03:53:01,240 --> 03:53:01,720
No!

4633
03:53:03,680 --> 03:53:06,640
I don't want to do water level.

4634
03:53:11,580 --> 03:53:14,380
We have to finish this chapter out.

4635
03:53:15,300 --> 03:53:17,360
Not the water level.

4636
03:53:18,660 --> 03:53:19,640
Where do I go?

4637
03:53:20,400 --> 03:53:21,880
I'm already lost.

4638
03:53:23,880 --> 03:53:24,680
I'll have to go to you.

4639
03:53:25,480 --> 03:53:27,340
I wonder how it'll help us get to the top of the island.

4640
03:53:29,640 --> 03:53:31,680
What is that machine?

4641
03:53:32,060 --> 03:53:32,380
Okay.

4642
03:53:32,740 --> 03:53:34,540
Everyone loves water levels.

4643
03:53:34,960 --> 03:53:36,240
Music is so good usually.

4644
03:53:36,660 --> 03:53:39,380
It's the music that's good, but the gameplay fucking sucks.

4645
03:53:40,320 --> 03:53:42,160
Except the Pokemon games.

4646
03:53:43,040 --> 03:53:44,780
That's not really a water level, though.

4647
03:53:44,940 --> 03:53:45,580
What is this?

4648
03:53:45,580 --> 03:53:46,060
I don't know.

4649
03:53:46,320 --> 03:53:51,180
Dude, I kind of missed this, like, old Pokemon games where
you could, like, deep dive into the scene.

4650
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:52,020
Oh, yeah.

4651
03:53:52,240 --> 03:53:53,340

4652
03:53:53,640 --> 03:53:53,820
Yeah.

4653
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:56,040

Oh, he angie.

4656
03:54:12,800 --> 03:54:18,020
Do you imagine being this whack-ass book where you created
these characters and you pretend to talk to them?

4657
03:54:18,640 --> 03:54:19,240
He's just like me.

4658
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:20,420
He's writing his own story.

4659
03:54:21,640 --> 03:54:24,580
He has no one else to talk to, so he makes up imaginary
friends.

4660
03:54:25,420 --> 03:54:26,440
Yeah, just like me in fourth grade.

4661
03:54:28,900 --> 03:54:30,960

Where do we pull it to?

4697
03:56:53,290 --> 03:56:54,290
Where are we pulling it to?

4698
03:56:56,670 --> 03:56:57,070
Nothing.

4699
03:56:57,470 --> 03:56:57,870
No, that.

4700
03:56:59,290 --> 03:56:59,810
I'm pulling it.

4701
03:56:59,810 --> 03:57:00,970
Where are you pulling it to?

4702
03:57:01,430 --> 03:57:02,750
I'm pulling it to you.

03:57:03,450 --> 03:57:04,770

And then we...

4708
03:57:18,390 --> 03:57:19,450

4709
03:57:19,470 --> 03:57:22,070

03:57:25,690 --> 03:57:26,830
Are we doing the wrong one?

4713
03:57:27,390 --> 03:57:27,950
I'm scared.

4714
03:57:29,590 --> 03:57:30,470
Is he coming?

4715
03:57:30,990 --> 03:57:31,970
I don't think so.

4716
03:57:33,070 --> 03:57:34,490
Maybe it's the other way.

4717
03:57:35,650 --> 03:57:36,670
Is it the other way?

4718
03:57:37,390 --> 03:57:40,710

04:03:45,730 --> 04:03:46,510
Wait, what is that?

4823
04:03:48,810 --> 04:03:50,690
Oh, that's so cool.

4824
04:03:52,590 --> 04:03:53,030
Okay.

4825
04:03:53,070 --> 04:03:53,450
Okay.

4826
04:03:54,030 --> 04:03:54,590
Ow.

4827
04:03:57,130 --> 04:03:57,550
Don't worry.

4828
04:03:58,350 --> 04:04:00,550
I'll grab the checkpoint so you can just fall next to me.

4829
04:04:00,630 --> 04:04:02,490
Oh, thank you.

4830
04:04:03,150 --> 04:04:03,670
Don't worry.

4831
04:04:04,470 --> 04:04:05,470
Your boo's got it.

4832
04:04:09,250 --> 04:04:10,450
Did you just call me?

4833
04:04:11,070 --> 04:04:12,330
Or call yourself my boo?

4834
04:04:17,030 --> 04:04:18,210
That's something else.

4835
04:04:19,950 --> 04:04:21,610
What do you mean?

4836
04:04:24,270 --> 04:04:25,390
We're married!

4837
04:04:27,990 --> 04:04:29,250
There's something else.

4838
04:04:30,490 --> 04:04:32,550
That is called the Doki Riz.

4839
04:04:32,750 --> 04:04:34,030
She liked it, guys.

4840
04:04:34,210 --> 04:04:35,210
I think she liked it.

4841
04:04:37,110 --> 04:04:42,810
I felt like that was the equivalent to some random guy at
the bar saying, Hey, what's up, Shwadi?

4842
04:04:44,190 --> 04:04:45,930
She liked it, guys.

4843
04:04:46,730 --> 04:04:50,130
What do we do here?

4844
04:04:50,330 --> 04:04:52,690
Oh, you have to push and then I push and then you push.

4845
04:04:54,450 --> 04:04:55,410
Let's go.

4846
04:04:56,610 --> 04:04:57,570
What are you doing correctly?

4847
04:04:57,890 --> 04:04:58,330
We are.

4848
04:05:02,430 --> 04:05:04,750
Yeah, you miss all the shots you don't shoot.

4849
04:05:06,450 --> 04:05:07,090
Eventually something will...

4850
04:05:07,090 --> 04:05:08,550
Hey, but sometimes you should shoot your shot.

4851
04:05:09,210 --> 04:05:11,830
Sometimes, like, you have to hit it all.

4852
04:05:11,930 --> 04:05:14,170
You have to keep going until it hits.

4853
04:05:14,770 --> 04:05:16,490
Look at that pep.

4854
04:05:16,490 --> 04:05:17,630
Were we supposed to jump up there?

4855
04:05:18,010 --> 04:05:19,010
Only one more to go.

4856
04:05:19,450 --> 04:05:20,070
Yeah, up here.

4857
04:05:24,810 --> 04:05:25,290

4858
04:05:29,730 --> 04:05:41,830

me press x you can go faster Wee They taught you that at the

4859

Oh no.

4863
04:06:01,010 --> 04:06:01,650
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4864
04:06:03,290 --> 04:06:04,370
What the fuck?

4865
04:06:06,170 --> 04:06:06,930
That's okay.

4866
04:06:07,850 --> 04:06:08,090
Woo.

4867
04:06:10,370 --> 04:06:11,050
That's okay.

4868
04:06:12,210 --> 04:06:12,750
That's okay.

4869
04:06:12,910 --> 04:06:13,450
That's okay.

4870
04:06:14,430 --> 04:06:15,590
I'm so fucking right.

4871
04:06:15,590 --> 04:06:15,610
Yeah!

4872
04:06:15,610 --> 04:06:15,830
I'm so fucking fast!

4873
04:06:18,070 --> 04:06:18,950
That's crazy.

4874
04:06:19,110 --> 04:06:21,170
I didn't know you can take the rings in front of me.

4875
04:06:24,350 --> 04:06:25,490
So when I went...

4876
04:06:25,510 --> 04:06:27,470
You would take it.

4877
04:06:27,490 --> 04:06:29,510
It's like the Mario Kart item.

4878
04:06:30,570 --> 04:06:32,550
Should have been so slow.

4879
04:06:36,270 --> 04:06:41,270
If you were a little faster, then you could have taken these
rings.

4880
04:06:42,310 --> 04:06:45,410
Yeah, and that's why I'm divorcing you because you go a
little too fast.

4881
04:06:45,810 --> 04:06:46,290
Whoa!

4882
04:06:48,650 --> 04:06:51,350
What the fuck in front of everybody?

4883
04:06:54,190 --> 04:06:55,490
They had to know the truth.

4884
04:06:55,510 --> 04:06:57,670
I thought I thought we were keeping that private.

4885
04:06:57,790 --> 04:07:00,150
I thought we were keeping that private

4886
04:07:03,330 --> 04:07:13,290
Some people like that You know that yeah, honestly my new
wife would love it I'm planning

4887
04:07:18,870 --> 04:07:34,590
Yes I think you're right You're a sore loser You're a sore
loser Loser Yeah, I'm just gonna say it you're a sore loser.

4888
04:07:34,730 --> 04:07:35,670
Wait, how did you win?

4889
04:07:36,390 --> 04:07:36,570
What?

4890
04:07:37,150 --> 04:07:37,610
I won.

4891
04:07:38,750 --> 04:07:39,990
Wait, what?

4892
04:07:41,330 --> 04:07:42,650
I followed the path properly.

4893
04:07:44,450 --> 04:07:44,830
What?

4894
04:07:45,350 --> 04:07:47,210
I think I got more rings than you.

4895
04:07:47,830 --> 04:07:48,790
How did you win?

4896
04:07:49,730 --> 04:07:51,250
I got more rings than you.

4897
04:07:51,690 --> 04:07:52,810
I'm missing check.

4898
04:07:52,890 --> 04:07:55,450
I'm apparently missing check boy.

4899
04:07:57,510 --> 04:07:58,350
What?

4900
04:08:01,810 --> 04:08:05,890
I didn't even realize I can't, I went too fast.

4901
04:08:06,330 --> 04:08:06,690
I went.

4902
04:08:07,470 --> 04:08:09,190
That's what I'm saying.

4903
04:08:09,550 --> 04:08:12,970
I can't believe you can actually go too fast.

4904
04:08:13,670 --> 04:08:16,030
That's so fucked up.

4905
04:08:16,750 --> 04:08:18,670
I can't believe it.

4906
04:08:19,170 --> 04:08:20,390
Everything's a lie.

4907
04:08:23,630 --> 04:08:25,770
Everything's a fucking lie.

4908
04:08:27,070 --> 04:08:29,070
One day you'll learn your lesson.

4909
04:08:29,950 --> 04:08:31,570
Today might not be that day.

4910
04:08:31,890 --> 04:08:34,310
That's how the candy factory is connected to the lighthouse.

4911
04:08:34,310 --> 04:08:35,350
I'm so sad.

4912
04:08:36,630 --> 04:08:42,250
I need a fucking head to bed and listen to some Lincoln
Park.

4913
04:08:44,830 --> 04:08:45,730
There we go.

4914
04:08:45,850 --> 04:08:46,210
Here?

4915
04:08:47,530 --> 04:08:48,870
Oh, it's back here.

4916
04:08:51,230 --> 04:08:52,730
Where's the last one, though?

4917
04:08:55,730 --> 04:08:57,050
Which one do we do already?

4918
04:08:57,070 --> 04:08:57,930
I can't tell.

4919
04:08:58,710 --> 04:08:59,650
Everything looks the same.

4920
04:09:00,950 --> 04:09:01,890
Which one are we missing?

4921
04:09:03,710 --> 04:09:04,610
This one.

4922
04:09:04,830 --> 04:09:05,350
Oh, it's this one.

4923
04:09:05,410 --> 04:09:06,370
We follow this pipe.

4924
04:09:08,730 --> 04:09:09,710
I see it.

4925
04:09:17,530 --> 04:09:18,870
I feel so empty inside.

4926
04:09:20,710 --> 04:09:21,230
Okay.

4927
04:09:27,190 --> 04:09:29,170
I feel so empty.

4928
04:09:32,270 --> 04:09:32,870
Alright.

4929
04:09:33,590 --> 04:09:36,170
I don't have the seabat rhythm!

4930
04:09:36,390 --> 04:09:37,650
What do you mean?

4931
04:09:40,790 --> 04:09:42,390
That's a good rhythm anyway.

4932
04:09:42,650 --> 04:09:43,610
You guys are just fucking...

4933
04:09:43,610 --> 04:09:44,690
What the fuck are you?

4934
04:09:44,730 --> 04:09:45,290
I don't know.

4935
04:09:45,950 --> 04:09:46,810
I don't know.

4936
04:09:47,690 --> 04:09:48,730
How did you get there?

4937
04:09:58,470 --> 04:10:00,010
How do you get in there?

4938
04:10:01,950 --> 04:10:03,290
What the fuck?

4939
04:10:04,250 --> 04:10:05,250
I'm so confused.

4940
04:10:06,530 --> 04:10:07,390
Where are you?

4941
04:10:08,150 --> 04:10:08,830

04:10:33,820 --> 04:10:40,300

think I have to find the hole.

4945
04:10:41,640 --> 04:10:42,320
I have experience with that.

4946
04:10:42,480 --> 04:10:42,660
Don't worry.

4947
04:10:42,860 --> 04:10:43,280
Watch this.

4948
04:10:44,640 --> 04:10:44,900
Wait.

4949
04:10:48,910 --> 04:10:49,730
Give me a second.

4950
04:10:56,230 --> 04:10:57,450
Oh, it's here!

4951
04:10:57,630 --> 04:10:58,170
It's here!

4952
04:10:58,310 --> 04:10:58,510
It's here!

4953
04:10:58,690 --> 04:10:58,970
It's here!

4954
04:10:59,050 --> 04:10:59,590
Wait, no.

4955
04:11:00,310 --> 04:11:01,250
No, wait.

4956
04:11:02,310 --> 04:11:03,570
Wait, Gumi, I need help.

4957
04:11:03,690 --> 04:11:05,090
What do I do, Gumi?

4958
04:11:05,630 --> 04:11:06,950
I need you to teach me.

4959
04:11:07,150 --> 04:11:07,810
What do I do?

4960
04:11:08,730 --> 04:11:10,370
I felt like you saw it.

4961
04:11:12,070 --> 04:11:13,830
I didn't.

4962
04:11:14,110 --> 04:11:14,910
I didn't.

4963
04:11:14,970 --> 04:11:15,770
What do I do?

4964
04:11:17,390 --> 04:11:18,350
Go find a hole.

4965
04:11:18,890 --> 04:11:21,570
But what if I can't find it?

4966
04:11:23,450 --> 04:11:24,090
Go find a hole.

4967
04:11:24,250 --> 04:11:26,230
Where is the hole?

4968
04:11:27,170 --> 04:11:29,290
Is it here?

4969
04:11:29,970 --> 04:11:30,610
No.

4970
04:11:30,830 --> 04:11:32,370
No, that's not.

4971
04:11:33,830 --> 04:11:35,410
Where is it?

4972
04:11:37,190 --> 04:11:39,110
This is a hole.

4973
04:11:40,130 --> 04:11:40,690
Hole?

4974
04:11:41,590 --> 04:11:43,190
Oh, maybe it's here.

4975
04:11:44,090 --> 04:11:46,810
If no, the hole is the goal.

4976
04:11:49,450 --> 04:11:50,370
Are you divorced yet?

4977
04:11:50,430 --> 04:11:51,070
I wish.

4978
04:11:52,430 --> 04:11:54,210
I'm here, but this is not open.

4979
04:11:54,430 --> 04:11:56,410
Hey, I think I need you to open this one for me.

4980
04:11:56,530 --> 04:11:57,590
Yeah, you need to open this.

4981
04:11:58,710 --> 04:11:59,610
Yeah, see?

4982
04:12:00,410 --> 04:12:02,450
I knew it wasn't me.

4983
04:12:02,870 --> 04:12:04,070
Oh, I can see the generator.

4984
04:12:04,470 --> 04:12:05,070
It's on the opposite side.

4985
04:12:05,070 --> 04:12:09,150
To be fair, I saw it earlier, but I wanted to see if you
would say something.

4986
04:12:12,370 --> 04:12:14,230
It's a group effort.

4987
04:12:15,090 --> 04:12:16,990
It's pretty warm in here.

4988
04:12:17,790 --> 04:12:19,970
Where do we have to take me to?

4989
04:12:20,250 --> 04:12:20,570
Here?

4990
04:12:21,570 --> 04:12:22,930
I don't think so, right?

4991
04:12:24,810 --> 04:12:25,770
Is it here?

4992
04:12:26,750 --> 04:12:27,610
Halfway there.

4993
04:12:28,770 --> 04:12:29,830
So where do we go from here?

4994
04:12:29,990 --> 04:12:31,090
Yeah, we're...

4995
04:12:31,990 --> 04:12:33,590
I don't think it's this way.

4996
04:12:33,850 --> 04:12:35,010
I think you have to go above.

4997
04:12:36,350 --> 04:12:37,410
You turn more or no?

4998
04:12:40,190 --> 04:12:41,390
What do we go from here?

4999
04:12:41,410 --> 04:12:42,190

5000
04:12:46,440 --> 04:13:02,980

5002
04:13:09,260 --> 04:13:17,440
yeah i know it's a bit difficult to rely on me right now I
think I need to go to sleep.

5003
04:13:17,580 --> 04:13:18,660
I think I need to go to sleep.

5004
04:13:24,220 --> 04:13:25,260
I'm doing it!

5005
04:13:25,520 --> 04:13:25,820
Yeah!

5006
04:13:38,830 --> 04:13:40,470

5007
04:13:40,650 --> 04:13:41,170
Yay!

5008
04:13:44,130 --> 04:13:44,650
Yippee!

5009
04:13:44,730 --> 04:13:47,370
Why do I feel like made just a lot of the heavy lifting?

5010
04:13:50,150 --> 04:13:51,070
I don't know.

5011
04:13:51,550 --> 04:13:53,970
I feel like I did an equal amount of work there.

5012
04:13:56,110 --> 04:13:56,630
Ah!

5013
04:14:04,630 --> 04:14:06,710
There's noign marriage.

5014
04:14:08,250 --> 04:14:08,890
Oh, God.

5015
04:14:10,930 --> 04:14:12,790
There is an I in marriage!

5016
04:14:14,490 --> 04:14:15,670
Did you notice that?

5017
04:14:15,710 --> 04:14:19,590
I've been saying that this entire stream, and you didn't
notice.

5018
04:14:19,590 --> 04:14:20,970
No, I didn't even say there's no I and I.

5019
04:14:21,850 --> 04:14:23,250
You didn't notice.

5020
04:14:23,370 --> 04:14:27,210
I said that the entire stream, and now you noticed.

5021
04:14:27,570 --> 04:14:29,710
No, the entire time you've been saying there's no.

5022
04:14:29,730 --> 04:14:33,810
No, I've been saying there's no I in Merritt's this entire
time.

5023
04:14:34,030 --> 04:14:36,490
I've been saying it this entire time.

5024
04:14:36,910 --> 04:14:38,830
And you never noticed until now.

5025
04:14:38,990 --> 04:14:41,630
It took you four hours to catch on.

5026
04:14:44,090 --> 04:14:46,170
I just block you out.

5027
04:14:47,490 --> 04:14:49,890
You say some shit like, oh, teamwork.

5028
04:14:50,170 --> 04:14:51,030
Look, teamwork.

5029
04:14:51,510 --> 04:14:53,310
I just block it out.

5030
04:14:54,130 --> 04:14:57,950
A marriage needs communication, Gumi.

5031
04:14:58,330 --> 04:14:59,710
You need a communication.

5032
04:14:59,730 --> 04:15:02,030
when you feel like it's too much.

5033
04:15:02,510 --> 04:15:07,610
I communicate to you, but you need to start listening to me.

5034
04:15:08,830 --> 04:15:09,870
How do you say something?

5035
04:15:12,690 --> 04:15:13,210
Push.

5036
04:15:17,160 --> 04:15:18,960
I think I need to go make another artichoke.

5037
04:15:20,860 --> 04:15:22,910
Oh, no!

Timer for Falcon!

5051
04:16:43,970 --> 04:16:45,290
You could take Rose to Waterland.

5052
04:16:45,630 --> 04:16:46,990
Yeah, it's a great idea.

5053
04:16:47,970 --> 04:16:50,010
She's been bugging us all summer to take her there.

5054
04:16:50,330 --> 04:16:52,210
And then I'll take her again when it's my turn.

5055
04:16:52,250 --> 04:16:53,250
Yeah, she'll have to go twice.

5056
04:16:53,690 --> 04:16:56,010
Oh my god, we're talking about custody.

5057
04:16:56,570 --> 04:17:01,410
You say something?

5058
04:17:02,130 --> 04:17:03,530
We're talking about the custody.

5059
04:17:04,190 --> 04:17:05,470
You're gonna have full custody, right?

5060
04:17:06,610 --> 04:17:07,410

04:19:20,850 --> 04:19:21,370
But I'm fun.

5090
04:19:21,470 --> 04:19:22,450

04:19:24,250 --> 04:19:24,890
I'm stuck.

5092
04:19:25,250 --> 04:19:25,670
I'm stuck.

5093
04:19:26,810 --> 04:19:28,070
I don't know how to put you out.

5094
04:19:32,390 --> 04:19:32,930
You don't pull.

5095
04:19:33,070 --> 04:19:33,470
You push.

5096
04:19:33,830 --> 04:19:33,830
Remember?

5097
04:19:34,030 --> 04:19:34,450
You push.

5098
04:19:34,930 --> 04:19:35,370
You push.

5099
04:19:35,650 --> 04:19:35,650
You push.

5100
04:19:35,810 --> 04:19:35,810

Yay!

5104
04:19:50,190 --> 04:19:50,610
Magnets!

5105
04:19:51,750 --> 04:19:51,930
Yeah!

5106
04:19:54,230 --> 04:19:55,230
I love magnets.

5107
04:19:59,280 --> 04:20:00,640
Help me, Stepdoki.

5108
04:20:01,000 --> 04:20:02,540
Oh my god, no, and then you're gonna get...

5109
04:20:02,540 --> 04:20:04,440
You're gonna... I'll be like the cool dad.

5110
04:20:04,880 --> 04:20:06,140
And then I fucked up.

5111
04:20:08,380 --> 04:20:09,340
Why did you...

5112
04:20:13,460 --> 04:20:14,660
I think you're supposed to...

5113
04:20:14,660 --> 04:20:15,020
No, it's because...

5114
04:20:15,040 --> 04:20:16,960
you're supposed to take me to the fish hooks over there.

5115
04:20:17,440 --> 04:20:18,220
I didn't fuck up.

5116
04:20:18,260 --> 04:20:20,620
I realized we fucked up together.

5117
04:20:21,940 --> 04:20:24,520
Because I was supposed to go to the fish hooks.

5118
04:20:26,000 --> 04:20:34,820
Yeah, and then when your mom remarries, when Gumi remarries,
you're gonna realize your stepdad is not as cool as me.

5119
04:20:38,950 --> 04:20:46,010
And I'm gonna show up with my badass motorcycle and I'll be
like, oh, is Jerry treating you okay?

5120
04:20:46,370 --> 04:20:46,770
Rose.

5121
04:20:47,630 --> 04:20:48,850
What's with you?

5122
04:20:49,190 --> 04:20:51,230
You're gonna name Jerry, man!

5123
04:20:51,710 --> 04:20:51,870
Hey!

5124
04:20:52,370 --> 04:20:53,470
Check out the hooks above!

5125
04:20:53,790 --> 04:20:56,610
I bet Jerry didn't bring you a pony!

5126
04:21:02,110 --> 04:21:02,710
Alright.

5127
04:21:03,170 --> 04:21:03,870
What is this?

5128
04:21:06,070 --> 04:21:07,330
Oh wait, no?

5129
04:21:07,710 --> 04:21:08,490
What do I do here?

5130
04:21:11,890 --> 04:21:13,390
Alright, pull this down?

5131
04:21:13,950 --> 04:21:14,610
What is this?

5132
04:21:23,960 --> 04:21:26,000
Many times don't have to teach you, old man.

5133
04:21:26,140 --> 04:21:27,900
You're not pulling nothing.

5134
04:21:30,600 --> 04:21:32,560
I'm a little confused.

5135
04:21:34,380 --> 04:21:35,740
How do you get here?

5136
04:21:35,800 --> 04:21:37,040
Did I...

5137
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:38,600
Did I fuck something up?

5138
04:21:39,820 --> 04:21:40,960
No, I couldn't.

5139
04:21:41,080 --> 04:21:41,680
I'm smart.

5140
04:21:42,320 --> 04:21:43,260
No, you're supposed to come here.

5141
04:21:43,400 --> 04:21:44,940
I did a platform for you.

5142
04:21:45,060 --> 04:21:46,020
I made you this.

5143
04:21:46,940 --> 04:21:48,260
Look, I did this.

5144
04:21:52,360 --> 04:21:53,780
I did this.

5145
04:21:55,220 --> 04:21:55,960
You're welcome.

5146
04:21:56,840 --> 04:21:57,920
Shut up.

5147
04:22:01,800 --> 04:22:02,400
Yay!

5148
04:22:05,540 --> 04:22:07,480
Alright, and then you're supposed to do this one.

5149
04:22:07,640 --> 04:22:08,140
Right here.

5150
04:22:08,980 --> 04:22:09,660
No, right here.

5151
04:22:10,100 --> 04:22:11,000
Go next to me.

5152
04:22:12,000 --> 04:22:13,140
I thought you...

5153
04:22:15,480 --> 04:22:16,080
Yeah.

5154
04:22:16,580 --> 04:22:19,700
And then I jump over and you pull it.

5155
04:22:20,760 --> 04:22:21,040
Yay!

5156
04:22:21,060 --> 04:22:23,860
Yeah, we're doing it.

5157
04:22:24,440 --> 04:22:25,920
I'm using my brain.

5158
04:22:27,340 --> 04:22:28,400
I need a water break.

5159
04:22:28,680 --> 04:22:30,780
I'm using 1% of my brain.

5160
04:22:31,260 --> 04:22:31,880
This is it.

5161
04:22:34,620 --> 04:22:34,680
Bumi?

5162
04:22:37,740 --> 04:22:38,020
Bumi?

5163
04:22:38,600 --> 04:22:39,280
Ah.

5164
04:22:40,360 --> 04:22:41,080
Bumi?

5165
04:22:42,080 --> 04:22:43,380
My hand hurty.

5166
04:22:44,520 --> 04:22:44,860
Bumi?

5167
04:22:49,240 --> 04:22:49,960
Huh?

5168
04:22:51,060 --> 04:22:51,580
The hook?

5169
04:22:55,060 --> 04:22:55,920
No, the other one.

5170
04:22:57,580 --> 04:22:58,840
There's one to your right.

5171
04:22:59,340 --> 04:23:00,480
I don't think this is gonna move.

5172
04:23:00,600 --> 04:23:01,480
Yeah, this doesn't move.

5173
04:23:05,570 --> 04:23:06,170
It's okay.

5174
04:23:06,890 --> 04:23:08,150
I know you don't mean that.

5175
04:23:15,370 --> 04:23:16,330
Alright, nice.

5176
04:23:17,070 --> 04:23:19,350
Alright, move me to the other side.

5177
04:23:20,430 --> 04:23:20,710
Yay!

5178
04:23:20,710 --> 04:23:21,610
Say poobies.

5179
04:23:22,910 --> 04:23:24,910
Move me to the other side.

5180
04:23:29,290 --> 04:23:31,730
I don't need to say please, we're already married.

5181
04:23:37,590 --> 04:23:42,010
Gumi, I know you want this game to be over, so you have to
move me to the other side.

5182
04:23:44,010 --> 04:23:48,570
The longer you stay here, the longer we're going to be
playing this game.

5183
04:23:48,970 --> 04:23:50,930
You know, you can't avoid that.

5184
04:23:58,750 --> 04:24:02,510
There you go, I made it.

5185
04:24:08,550 --> 04:24:12,470
The longer you delay this, the longer we stay married.

5186
04:24:17,630 --> 04:24:18,990
Okay, here you go.

5187
04:24:20,570 --> 04:24:21,390
Oh my god, is that bones?

5188
04:24:23,350 --> 04:24:27,370
I'm glad to see you peek out about these things, but I just
hope they hold off.

5189
04:24:27,650 --> 04:24:29,070
Whose bones are these?

5190
04:24:29,070 --> 04:24:29,290
What the fuck is this?

5191
04:24:29,390 --> 04:24:31,870
In the f- Yeah, I know, in the cube!

5192
04:24:32,770 --> 04:24:34,470
Whose bones are these?

5193
04:24:35,630 --> 04:24:37,130
In the snow globe!

5194
04:24:40,610 --> 04:24:41,210
Yay!

5195
04:24:47,750 --> 04:24:50,470
I still can't believe I missed a checkpoint.

5196
04:24:51,490 --> 04:24:53,590
I still can't believe- What did you say?

5197
04:24:53,970 --> 04:24:56,730
I can't believe I missed a checkpoint in that race.

5198
04:24:57,270 --> 04:24:58,730
I can't believe it.

5199
04:25:00,070 --> 04:25:02,650
I got a little more checkpoints muted.

5200
04:25:02,870 --> 04:25:08,050
I thought it was all about going fast and being efficient.

5201
04:25:08,930 --> 04:25:12,050
It was all alive.

5202
04:25:14,110 --> 04:25:15,870
It was all alive.

5203
04:25:17,230 --> 04:25:20,870
I'm still ahead.

5204
04:25:21,690 --> 04:25:23,390
I can't wait to eat another artichoke tonight.

5205
04:25:23,650 --> 04:25:24,210
I'm still ahead.

5206
04:25:26,270 --> 04:25:26,810
No, you're not.

5207
04:25:26,810 --> 04:25:27,390
Wait, what the fuck?

5208
04:25:27,510 --> 04:25:28,810
How did you get the airtime?

5209
04:25:32,770 --> 04:25:34,490

04:26:34,130 --> 04:26:39,170

Stop!

5220
04:26:49,930 --> 04:26:51,330
Shart yourself.

Stop!

04:26:52,930 --> 04:26:55,730
We are mature adults here.

5223
04:26:56,790 --> 04:26:58,170
We are...

5224
04:26:58,170 --> 04:27:00,250
We are mature people!

5225
04:27:01,650 --> 04:27:02,270
We do...

5226
04:27:02,730 --> 04:27:06,070
We do... We do very smart adult jobs.

5227
04:27:06,090 --> 04:27:10,870
Sharks here Shark thyself

5228
04:27:14,090 --> 04:27:17,070
What the fuck are you like dashing in front of me?

5229
04:27:19,290 --> 04:27:21,380
I'm trying to go as fast as I can

5230
04:27:24,970 --> 04:27:28,920
Look at that you're having fun almost dying that's fucked up

5231
04:27:32,290 --> 04:27:36,070
Great I'm here, you know what I'm saying you're like this
true spirit

5232
04:27:40,450 --> 04:27:44,670
You know, Tony Hawk is like almost, wait, he's like 60,
right?

5233
04:27:45,350 --> 04:27:46,470
That's actually crazy.

5234
04:27:47,570 --> 04:27:51,110
He's like somewhere in 50s or 60s now, and he's still
skateboarding.

5235
04:27:54,250 --> 04:27:56,130
That's gotta be me when I'm in my 60s.

5236
04:27:56,570 --> 04:27:57,650
That's a lie.

5237
04:28:05,450 --> 04:28:06,590
Dude, leave us alone.

5238
04:28:06,950 --> 04:28:07,590
Leave us alone.

5239
04:28:08,070 --> 04:28:08,950
This is creepy.

5240
04:28:09,550 --> 04:28:11,270
We can fix our relationship without you.

5241
04:28:11,290 --> 04:28:11,690
Thank you!

5242
04:28:14,810 --> 04:28:18,110
Oh god, we're getting magnetized.

5243
04:28:25,420 --> 04:28:27,940
Jesus, he's still shredding it at 55.

5244
04:28:29,620 --> 04:28:30,540
What the fuck are you doing?

5245
04:28:32,640 --> 04:28:34,160
How do we do this?

5246
04:28:37,260 --> 04:28:38,580
You're free now.

5247
04:28:45,740 --> 04:28:48,120
We can, like, body slam.

5248
04:28:49,640 --> 04:28:52,700
Indeed, the hole is greater than the parts.

5249
04:28:53,560 --> 04:28:55,820
The magnet's attraction is getting stronger.

5250
04:28:57,140 --> 04:28:58,160
Wait, what the fuck?

5251
04:28:58,780 --> 04:29:00,020
It's already choke time!

5252
04:29:00,720 --> 04:29:01,320
Wait, what?

5253
04:29:01,840 --> 04:29:02,140
What?

5254
04:29:04,080 --> 04:29:05,940
What the fuck?

5255
04:29:06,380 --> 04:29:06,740
Be a bat.

5256
04:29:07,040 --> 04:29:08,240
Gooby, what the fuck?

5257
04:29:08,360 --> 04:29:09,700
We're still in this game!

5258
04:29:11,160 --> 04:29:12,360
At least head over!

5259
04:29:13,140 --> 04:29:14,220
Oh my god.

5260
04:29:17,920 --> 04:29:22,480
We're so close to finishing this chapter.

5261
04:29:32,740 --> 04:29:35,960
Oh my god.

5262
04:29:36,320 --> 04:29:37,680
We were so close.

5263
04:29:40,140 --> 04:29:42,480
We were almost there.

5264
04:29:46,080 --> 04:29:46,980
Oh

5265
04:29:51,000 --> 04:29:53,540
Artichoke over joking

5266
04:29:56,740 --> 04:30:01,560
Let me go Why did you pick artichoke?

5267
04:30:05,320 --> 04:30:13,580
They were so close we were so close to finishing this
chapter it was literally right there it was literally right

5270

Look at me.

5271
04:30:49,280 --> 04:30:49,680
Look at this.

5272
04:30:49,680 --> 04:30:51,060
And I fucking love artichokes.

5273
04:30:51,720 --> 04:30:52,780
I can't believe it.

5274
04:30:53,000 --> 04:30:53,200
All right.

5275
04:30:53,300 --> 04:30:55,200
If I was dangling off a cliff.

5276
04:30:55,680 --> 04:30:57,660
But there's an artichoke next to you.

5277
04:30:58,700 --> 04:30:58,900
Huh?

5278
04:31:00,020 --> 04:31:01,380
Get over here.

5279
04:31:02,040 --> 04:31:02,340
Whoops.

5280
04:31:04,080 --> 04:31:05,240
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

5281
04:31:05,420 --> 04:31:06,560
You jump to me.

5282
04:31:07,080 --> 04:31:08,320
You attract over yet, area.

5283
04:31:09,040 --> 04:31:11,840
I can really feel this magnet pulling towards you.

5284
04:31:15,020 --> 04:31:15,780
Damn.

5285
04:31:16,680 --> 04:31:18,720
What does the archer have that I don't have?

5286
04:31:19,800 --> 04:31:20,080
Flavor.

5287
04:31:21,340 --> 04:31:21,340
What?

5288
04:31:21,600 --> 04:31:22,320
What is that?

5289
04:31:24,600 --> 04:31:25,880
Good flavor.

5290
04:31:27,180 --> 04:31:31,480
Good flavor.

5291
04:31:32,540 --> 04:31:33,000
Vegetable.

5292
04:31:33,380 --> 04:31:34,160
I love vegetable.

5293
04:31:37,200 --> 04:31:39,460
I'm not gonna comment anymore.

5294
04:31:40,820 --> 04:31:41,520
I love vegetable.

5295
04:31:41,840 --> 04:31:42,340
Oh,

5296
04:31:45,520 --> 04:31:46,100

5297
04:31:46,540 --> 04:31:47,960
Wait, but, like, how do...

5298
04:31:47,960 --> 04:31:48,700
I'm so confused.

5299
04:31:48,820 --> 04:31:50,560
You have to wait until we're both ready.

5300
04:31:51,120 --> 04:31:52,280
We have to both do at the same time.

5301
04:31:52,820 --> 04:31:54,060
I literally just said that.

5302
04:31:54,400 --> 04:31:55,840
I literally just said that.

5303
04:31:56,260 --> 04:31:57,780
The artichoke said that.

5304
04:31:58,280 --> 04:31:58,940
Okay, go.

5305
04:32:00,900 --> 04:32:01,380
Yeah!

5306
04:32:01,840 --> 04:32:03,000
We did it!

5307
04:32:05,020 --> 04:32:06,180
Did you hear that?

5308
04:32:06,200 --> 04:32:07,140
I love artichoke.

5309
04:32:08,220 --> 04:32:09,920
You love it so much, why don't you marry it?

5310
04:32:10,260 --> 04:32:11,760
We should stay close to each other.

5311
04:32:11,840 --> 04:32:21,820
yeah keep your magnet ready what the fuck are you doing your
magnet i don't know let's move on whoa there's the tower ah

Don't worry, I can grab onto this one.

5315
04:32:47,700 --> 04:32:48,980
I'm going to grab onto this one.

5316
04:32:49,120 --> 04:32:50,060
Follow me!

5317
04:32:51,420 --> 04:32:52,220
Follow me!

5318
04:32:53,240 --> 04:32:55,220
It'd be so funny if I let go right now.

5319
04:32:56,020 --> 04:32:57,620
Oh, man, I really want to eat my artichoke.

5320
04:32:58,620 --> 04:32:59,840
It'd be so funny.

5321
04:33:01,820 --> 04:33:03,520
All right, we got to go to the...

5322
04:33:03,520 --> 04:33:05,180
Oh, I think we can make it to the next blue.

5323
04:33:05,800 --> 04:33:06,640
I think we can make it.

5324
04:33:06,640 --> 04:33:07,260
We can't make it.

5325
04:33:07,320 --> 04:33:08,100
Gotta go to the red.

5326
04:33:08,340 --> 04:33:09,460
I got it.

5327
04:33:09,960 --> 04:33:11,060
Don't worry, I got you.

5328
04:33:12,640 --> 04:33:14,700
Why do you think you've caught me?

5329
04:33:14,940 --> 04:33:16,080
Don't worry, I got you.

5330
04:33:17,000 --> 04:33:18,320
I'm making sure you don't fall.

5331
04:33:20,420 --> 04:33:21,880
In gumming gusks.

5332
04:33:28,900 --> 04:33:30,180
No, get this one!

5333
04:33:30,360 --> 04:33:30,860
Yes!

5334
04:33:31,840 --> 04:33:32,700
I got you!

5335
04:33:34,340 --> 04:33:35,500
Holy God, are you!

5336
04:33:35,540 --> 04:33:38,520
I'm making sure your boots are digging into the snow right
now.

5337
04:33:39,760 --> 04:33:40,800
Shut up.

5338
04:33:44,640 --> 04:33:46,060
What are you doing?

5339
04:33:46,400 --> 04:33:47,400
What are you doing?

5340
04:33:49,480 --> 04:33:51,620
I can't hold the crowd.

5341
04:33:51,880 --> 04:33:53,340
The wind soar reaches here.

5342
04:33:56,160 --> 04:33:57,000
Alright, we're good.

5343
04:33:58,860 --> 04:34:00,200
The wind doesn't reach us here.

5344
04:34:00,940 --> 04:34:03,420
What are you doing?

5345
04:34:05,720 --> 04:34:07,420
What are you doing?

5346
04:34:08,500 --> 04:34:09,920
What the fuck?

5347
04:34:11,840 --> 04:34:12,920
Does it not stop?

5348
04:34:14,280 --> 04:34:15,700
Oh, I don't think it stops.

5349
04:34:15,840 --> 04:34:16,860
I think we have to go to the right.

5350
04:34:17,460 --> 04:34:18,540

5357
04:34:34,240 --> 04:34:35,840

I'm also that spiteful.

5363
04:35:14,000 --> 04:35:15,160

04:35:18,560 --> 04:35:19,400

I wasn't going to work.

5377
04:36:21,270 --> 04:36:22,970

04:36:49,910 --> 04:36:51,430
I'm losing grip!

5389
04:36:52,110 --> 04:36:53,650
I don't need you.

5390
04:36:54,510 --> 04:36:55,630

04:36:57,670 --> 04:36:58,470
I don't need you.

04:37:00,130 --> 04:37:01,470
Yeah, you do it on your own.

5394
04:37:02,130 --> 04:37:02,870
Okay, okay, I need you.

5395
04:37:02,930 --> 04:37:03,370
I need you.

5397
04:37:03,910 --> 04:37:04,370
Get up.

5398
04:37:04,970 --> 04:37:06,630
I'm literally right next to you.

5399
04:37:14,290 --> 04:37:16,390
I can't even get up here.

5400
04:37:16,530 --> 04:37:21,290
You have to let go because I can't even get up here!

5401
04:37:32,870 --> 04:37:35,270
I can't use the magnet!

5402
04:37:41,810 --> 04:37:44,050
I don't know where to go from here.

5403
04:37:47,290 --> 04:37:49,410
Where do we go from here?

5404
04:37:51,050 --> 04:37:52,030
We just...

5405
04:37:52,030 --> 04:37:52,130
Oh!

5406
04:37:52,850 --> 04:37:54,350
Oh, it's a meat in the middle!

5407
04:37:55,490 --> 04:37:55,790
Oh!

5408
04:37:57,170 --> 04:37:59,350
Okay, I'll go on the other side.

5409
04:38:00,390 --> 04:38:01,270
You stay there.

5410
04:38:04,270 --> 04:38:05,630
All right, here we go.

5411
04:38:06,370 --> 04:38:06,990
Are you ready?

5412
04:38:09,230 --> 04:38:11,050
Three, two, one, go.

5413
04:38:12,610 --> 04:38:13,510
We did it.

5414
04:38:14,290 --> 04:38:16,210
Through sheer determination.

5415
04:38:16,810 --> 04:38:17,790
Oh, we did it.

5416
04:38:18,310 --> 04:38:19,030
It says come.

5417
04:38:20,650 --> 04:38:22,230
This is a healthy marriage.

5418
04:38:22,470 --> 04:38:23,410
Look, you're supposed to come.

5419
04:38:24,270 --> 04:38:27,750
Look, look, look, look.

5420
04:38:28,230 --> 04:38:31,110
I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

5421
04:38:31,650 --> 04:38:32,890
I'm closing my eyes.

5422
04:38:33,850 --> 04:38:34,150
Look, look.

5423
04:38:34,610 --> 04:38:35,310
Disconnected.

5424
04:38:36,020 --> 04:38:36,450
Yes!

5425
04:38:36,830 --> 04:38:38,250
That was Kojima.

5426
04:38:38,630 --> 04:38:39,050
Yeah!

5427
04:38:40,630 --> 04:38:43,750
See, this is a healthy relationship.

5428
04:38:44,290 --> 04:38:45,190
I'll see marriage.

5429
04:38:48,190 --> 04:38:50,350
My turn to sit here.

5430
04:38:53,900 --> 04:38:55,640
I think we can finish the game.

5431
04:38:57,300 --> 04:38:58,660
No way.

5432
04:38:58,800 --> 04:39:00,140
There's no way.

5433
04:39:01,500 --> 04:39:03,220
There's no way.

5434
04:39:04,060 --> 04:39:04,980
I think we can finish the game.

5435
04:39:05,400 --> 04:39:09,420
Kumi, Kumi, there's two more chapters, Kumi.

5436
04:39:19,870 --> 04:39:21,010
Hello, Kazu.

5437
04:39:21,690 --> 04:39:22,370
Focus.

5438
04:39:22,590 --> 04:39:23,850
So pretty.

5439
04:39:24,250 --> 04:39:26,250
Oh, the Obororarealis.

5440
04:39:26,670 --> 04:39:26,970
Yeah.

5441
04:39:27,730 --> 04:39:28,890
At this time of day.

5442
04:39:29,370 --> 04:39:31,770
The Obororarealis.

5443
04:39:32,450 --> 04:39:33,350
Ah, yeah.

5444
04:39:33,350 --> 04:39:34,650
At this time of day.

5445
04:39:35,010 --> 04:39:35,870
At this hour.

5446
04:39:36,350 --> 04:39:37,810
Right in this very location.

5447
04:39:37,990 --> 04:39:38,750
The snow globe.

5448
04:39:39,690 --> 04:39:40,330
This is where I...

5449
04:39:40,330 --> 04:39:41,170
Wait, what was it again?

5450
04:39:41,230 --> 04:39:41,590
The what?

5451
04:39:42,290 --> 04:39:43,270
The Oborararealis.

5452
04:39:43,830 --> 04:39:46,730
Oh, my God.

5453
04:39:47,910 --> 04:39:48,430
Aurora?

5454
04:39:48,810 --> 04:39:49,310
Aurora.

5455
04:39:50,010 --> 04:39:50,370
The Oborarealis.

5456
04:39:51,050 --> 04:39:51,430
Really?

5457
04:39:55,150 --> 04:39:58,490
How you forgot your whole speech.

5458
04:39:58,970 --> 04:40:01,250
It was the worst proposal in the history.

5459
04:40:01,270 --> 04:40:02,770
Wait, I proposed to you here?

5460
04:40:02,910 --> 04:40:03,230
I thought you proposed here.

5461
04:40:03,870 --> 04:40:04,970
Yeah, I proposed here.

5462
04:40:05,190 --> 04:40:06,070
Look at the memories.

5463
04:40:06,490 --> 04:40:07,150
You hear about the words.

5464
04:40:08,550 --> 04:40:10,650
It was the way you handled it.

5465
04:40:11,750 --> 04:40:13,950
Without trying to hide how scared you were.

5466
04:40:15,770 --> 04:40:16,410
It was brave.

5467
04:40:17,470 --> 04:40:18,730
I'm a brave boy.

5468
04:40:20,010 --> 04:40:21,970
Mama said I'm a brave boy.

5469
04:40:23,350 --> 04:40:26,290
Why do you keep talking?

5470
04:40:31,070 --> 04:40:31,870
Eww!

5471
04:40:33,230 --> 04:40:35,610
Bro, he ruined the moment!

5472
04:40:36,250 --> 04:40:37,470
Making great progress!

5473
04:40:37,930 --> 04:40:39,010
He ruined the moment!

5474
04:40:39,530 --> 04:40:40,730
Are you ready?

5475
04:40:41,450 --> 04:40:42,810
Let's get going!

5476
04:40:43,270 --> 04:40:46,470
I hate seeing his disfigured tongue in his mouth.

5477
04:41:10,490 --> 04:41:11,830
Oh, is the lights working?

5478
04:41:13,490 --> 04:41:14,210
Wow!

5479
04:41:14,790 --> 04:41:17,160
Woo-wee!

5480
04:41:18,360 --> 04:41:20,740
The lights working again.

5481
04:41:21,860 --> 04:41:22,560
Shake it.

5482
04:41:22,580 --> 04:41:23,820
They're still inside.

5483
04:41:25,760 --> 04:41:26,560
Shake it.

5484
04:41:28,320 --> 04:41:29,540
Dad, Dad, look!

5485
04:41:30,140 --> 04:41:30,180
Look!

5486
04:41:30,180 --> 04:41:31,340
Look at the snow globe!

5487
04:41:31,880 --> 04:41:33,800
You hear the screams in the snow globe.

5488
04:41:37,490 --> 04:41:39,830
Why haven't I ever seen this picture before?

5489
04:41:41,650 --> 04:41:42,530
Look, Dad.

5490
04:41:43,070 --> 04:41:47,670
That's when Daddy and Mommy were last happy before I was
born.

5491
04:41:54,710 --> 04:41:56,410
They're mom and dad.

5492
04:41:56,950 --> 04:41:59,190
Yes, we're thrilled.

5493
04:42:00,870 --> 04:42:03,830
Now, how do you find your purpose in life?

5494
04:42:04,450 --> 04:42:07,490
Through, wait for it, passion.

5495
04:42:07,830 --> 04:42:08,270
Oh god.

5496
04:42:09,030 --> 04:42:09,930
We're gonna have sex.

5497
04:42:10,490 --> 04:42:10,650
What?

5498
04:42:12,450 --> 04:42:15,270
Because you lost your passion, Cody.

5499
04:42:15,930 --> 04:42:17,810
A passion that lights the past.

5500
04:42:17,910 --> 04:42:19,770
to your purpose in life.

5501
04:42:20,110 --> 04:42:22,090
Passion, path, purpose, passion, you know.

5502
04:42:22,610 --> 04:42:23,570
Uh, no.

5503
04:42:24,550 --> 04:42:27,350
Maybe he's talking about you wanting to be a gardener.

5504
04:42:27,470 --> 04:42:28,930
Yeah, it's about gardening.

5505
04:42:29,650 --> 04:42:30,730
God, goomy.

5506
04:42:31,750 --> 04:42:33,470
It's what's about gardening.

5507
04:42:36,450 --> 04:42:38,210
I'm gonna rake your garden.

5508
04:42:39,370 --> 04:42:39,650
What?

5509
04:42:45,860 --> 04:42:48,600
I never really think to appreciate what I did.

5510
04:42:49,760 --> 04:42:59,520
it's my fault you see this is why we can't live together you
see what does she say gotta spread those seeds

5511
04:43:03,140 --> 04:43:09,180

to rake the garden, the actual garden.

5513
04:43:25,680 --> 04:43:29,020
Oh yeah, but everything still looks beautiful.

5514
04:43:30,680 --> 04:43:34,200
And, and all thanks to my painstaking groundwork, I might
add.

5515
04:43:34,780 --> 04:43:35,920
Oh, really?

5516
04:43:36,880 --> 04:43:38,520
Painstaking groundwork, huh?

5517
04:43:38,660 --> 04:43:39,460
Look at this.

5518
04:43:39,560 --> 04:43:40,480
Come on.

5519
04:43:40,760 --> 04:43:42,860
Cousin, did you want to- I didn't plant that.

5520
04:43:42,900 --> 04:43:43,340
What is it?

5521
04:43:43,920 --> 04:43:44,400
Yeah!

5522
04:43:45,240 --> 04:43:46,100
Use your head.

5523
04:43:46,240 --> 04:43:48,320
And you understand soon enough.

5524
04:43:48,560 --> 04:43:49,160
My head.

5525
04:43:50,640 --> 04:43:51,160
Whoa!

5526
04:43:52,320 --> 04:43:52,600
Ew!

5527
04:43:53,720 --> 04:43:54,740
What the fuck?

5528
04:43:55,440 --> 04:43:56,720
That's fucking gross.

5529
04:43:56,880 --> 04:44:00,080
This time you will encourage and support his passion.

5530
04:44:00,100 --> 04:44:00,440
No!

5531
04:44:00,820 --> 04:44:02,200
Support my passion!

5532
04:44:03,480 --> 04:44:04,520
Wait, what is that?

5533
04:44:06,460 --> 04:44:08,280
I think it's a weed killer.

5534
04:44:09,340 --> 04:44:10,760
Alright, are we calling here, right?

5535
04:44:11,200 --> 04:44:12,100
That was...

5536
04:44:12,100 --> 04:44:13,880
That purple thing is blocking our way.

5537
04:44:13,960 --> 04:44:15,440
We can finish this next week.

5538
04:44:16,140 --> 04:44:17,480
There's still three more chapters.

5539
04:44:17,960 --> 04:44:18,820
We need to get rid of it.

5540
04:44:20,380 --> 04:44:25,420
You know, I'm happy to end it here because I ended with my
nice guard and Riz.

5541
04:44:26,860 --> 04:44:27,460
Say uh.

5542
04:44:28,280 --> 04:44:29,000
What?

5543
04:44:30,000 --> 04:44:30,160
No!

5544
04:44:30,520 --> 04:44:31,420
Say uh!

5545
04:44:32,140 --> 04:44:32,420
No!

5546
04:44:33,320 --> 04:44:33,880
No!

5547
04:44:35,140 --> 04:44:35,500
Say uh!

5548
04:44:37,360 --> 04:44:38,900
Get away from me!

5549
04:44:39,480 --> 04:44:40,860
Get away from me!

5550
04:44:41,680 --> 04:44:43,500
What the fuck is that?

5551
04:44:44,600 --> 04:44:44,920
No!

5552
04:44:45,440 --> 04:44:45,800
Stop!

5553
04:44:46,600 --> 04:44:48,240
What is that?

5554
04:44:48,740 --> 04:44:49,460
Say uh.

5555
04:44:49,760 --> 04:44:50,640
I don't want to.

5556
04:44:50,820 --> 04:44:52,260
I don't want to.

5557
04:44:52,380 --> 04:44:53,420
I don't want to.

5558
04:44:53,880 --> 04:44:55,200
I don't want to.

5559
04:45:01,200 --> 04:45:02,400
Oh, GGs.

5560
04:45:03,320 --> 04:45:05,020
Oh my god.

5561
04:45:06,600 --> 04:45:07,680
GGs, man.

5562
04:45:07,900 --> 04:45:09,940

5563
04:45:10,800 --> 04:45:10,960
Yeah.

5564
04:45:11,580 --> 04:45:12,460
Oh my god.

5565
04:45:12,560 --> 04:45:13,380
What a journey.

5566
04:45:13,540 --> 04:45:16,680
I feel like I feel like I aged so much.

5567
04:45:19,760 --> 04:45:22,660
We have a very loving relationship.

5568
04:45:23,420 --> 04:45:25,040
I'm going to go.

5569
04:45:25,660 --> 04:45:33,080
Every second spent with you is like a miracle.

5570
04:45:37,960 --> 04:45:39,800
Why do you keep saying things?

5571
04:45:40,020 --> 04:45:41,460
What do you mean?

5572
04:45:42,560 --> 04:45:43,220
Why?

04:45:44,100 --> 04:45:45,360

Updates, updates, updates Apparently Challenger Circuit has

5583
04:47:12,980 --> 04:47:20,680
been Delayed, there was an update Regarding Challenger
Circuit So, most likely, I might take Saturday as a rest

5584
04:47:20,680 --> 04:47:21,280
day.

5585
04:47:22,220 --> 04:47:25,300
So, Saturday might be a rest day, then.

5586
04:47:25,780 --> 04:47:33,260
Because I decided to use it as a day to just rest up a
little bit and recoup some energy.

5587
04:47:33,960 --> 04:47:35,220
So, that's going to be delayed.

5588
04:47:35,280 --> 04:47:37,920
It's delayed to, like, April, I think.

5589
04:47:39,200 --> 04:47:40,720
April 6th, yeah.

5590
04:47:41,240 --> 04:47:44,680
It's going to be delayed to April 6th.

5591
04:47:44,800 --> 04:47:47,140
They're moving around the schedule to fit the other...

5592
04:47:47,340 --> 04:47:53,920
Uh, tournament that got delayed, so there's like a lot of
stuff that's being moved around, so that's why, that's why,

5593
04:47:54,140 --> 04:47:55,840
that shit is, that got moved.

5594
04:47:57,860 --> 04:47:59,820
Um, and, uh, what else?

5595
04:48:00,080 --> 04:48:00,400
What else?

5596
04:48:01,220 --> 04:48:07,560
Uh, next week, I know I said I wanted to play Dead Rising
next week to start Dead Rising playthrough, but then I

5597
04:48:07,560 --> 04:48:14,700
remember Dead Rising is Majority Escort missions, and then
like, I already went through a lot of escort missions with

5598
04:48:14,700 --> 04:48:15,580
Resident Evil.

5599
04:48:17,340 --> 04:48:21,980
So I decided that we're going to play a different game.

5600
04:48:22,060 --> 04:48:25,080
We're going to start a different game next week.

5601
04:48:26,360 --> 04:48:29,440
Because I want a little break from doing escort missions.

5602
04:48:30,040 --> 04:48:32,940
So those are the updates for today.

5603
04:48:33,660 --> 04:48:34,760
Are you going to call it here?

5604
04:48:35,080 --> 04:48:37,080
Because I do have a lot of behind the scenes to work on.

5605
04:48:37,180 --> 04:48:38,720
As well as preparing for tomorrow's stream.

5606
04:48:39,260 --> 04:48:42,080
