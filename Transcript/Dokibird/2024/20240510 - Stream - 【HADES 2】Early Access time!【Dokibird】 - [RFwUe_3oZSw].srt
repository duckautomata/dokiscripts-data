You have to stream in two minutes.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,360
But now I'm sleepy.

19
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm eepy now.

20
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,180
I was like, no, mom, why didn't you come in the room after
my stream?

21
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,680
Now I'm EP, but now I'm EP because of all the business talk.

22
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,340
Not the EP.

23
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,680
Anyway, so I got some coffee in here at the moment.

24
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,000
Because I need to wake up.

25
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,720
I've been like, there's been like so much work going on.

26
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,000
Like, I don't know.

27
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:53,240
I think I've like conditioned myself to, so that every time
I like have to, I have like fucking work talk going in.

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,560
Like I'm just like, I want to sleep.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,780
It doesn't, it doesn't matter if like I just woke up or
anything.

30
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,160
If I just woke up and I was like, all right, I'm feeling it.

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,060
And then they're like, all right, it's time for business
talk.

32
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,680
And then I'll be like, I want to sleep.

33
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,540
I want to sleep now.

34
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,680
I just, I conditioned myself.

35
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,520
No, this is not good.

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,700
It's not good that I conditioned myself to be EEPI.

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,200
Every time it's like important business talk, important
meeting time.

38
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,940
And then I'm like, important sleep time.

39
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,140
There's only one way to avoid business talk.

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,440
Sleeping.

41
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,040
Gotta lift.

42
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,740
I got conditioned EEPI-ness now, guys.

43
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,460
Anyway, um, I'll.

44
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720
Another news, another news.

45
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,160
There's so many news.

46
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,980
There's so many news coming in.

47
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,040
But yeah, I was like, I was not EP, but now I'm mega EP.

48
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,560
But it's okay.

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,460
Streaming always makes me feel less EP the longer I go.

50
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,880
And the more I stream, the longer I stream, the more less EP
I get.

51
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,020
Anyway, anyway, anyway, lots of...

52
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:26,360
of exciting lots of exciting news coming in uh so um i
didn't realize this until i ended stream last night also

53
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,680
like uh i went to bed really fucking late last night because
like hira and i ended up talking for like i think like three

54
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:43,240
plus hours straight after we ended stream so i think i went
to bed around like five to six a.m because we just kept

55
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:52,000
yapping afterwards um uh so she's a great friend um because
like we were just like hanging out and just talking about

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,400

the stream and after i finished yapping with hiro that um it

greets.

62
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:45,760
So yes, there will be meet and greets well as i think like i
don't know if i can announce it because it's not it's not on

63
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:53,640
the website itself i should have asked to be like hey what
can i say and what can i not say in terms of like what will

64
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:01,480
i be doing at av cod because i don't think uh i don't think
they they wrote down yet they've announced what i will be

65
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:13,060
doing at the the convention i know what i'll be doing at the
So I actually don't know yet.

66
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,680
I should ask first.

67
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,920
But the one thing I can say is the mean and greets.

68
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,160
Because I feel like, you know, even if I shouldn't have, if
I wasn't supposed to spoil it, it's not like it's.

69
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,360
I mean, I did quote retweet it.

70
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,140
So if they're like, oh my God, you shouldn't have said it.

71
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,040
Well, I did quote retweet it.

72
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,420
And they know I quote retweeted.

73
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,440
And they didn't reprimand me for quote retweeting it.

74
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,080
and saying that it's a meet and greet so i think i'll be

I can't believe I replaced a super.

150
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,340
I thought that was really funny because my teammates were
all like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

151
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:13,540
The boys are back and even better because I replaced, I'm
like the fucking replacement for Super.

152
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,340
And they're just like, oh my god, this is the dream team.

153
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,540
You had fun doing a combo.

154
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Congrats, Doki.

155
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,940
You're better than 90% of the FGC.

156
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,340
But then they give us a super chat.

157
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,640
Thank you.

158
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,220
Thank you.

159
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,060
I think the death cradle is so fun because if I hit it, I
don't have to do anything for like 80% of the game.

160
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:44,700
like it's the best because like because like then i can just
spend majority of time just chilling in the cut scene and i

161
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,680
think that's i think that's why i was really into king
because i realized if i hit these grapples if i hit these

162
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,260
like throws i i get to do like 50 less than the rest of the
player base and

163
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:10,520
it's it's a good i get down time exactly like in that
fucking if i hit the rdc i'll have i because like what kind

164
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:20,520
of newbie's gonna learn how to break the rdc anyway like i
don't know how to fuck to break the rdc but anyway it's a

165
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:30,060
good investment learning all the learning all the grapples
and the throws now so like if i get anybody in the rdc i can

166
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,380
literally leave my controller and just go to the bathroom
and then come back and they're still fucking gripped and

167
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:49,860
then i and then i put them into another rdc and i leave my
pc get water and then ko like it's so easy it's like

168
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:56,240
resetting after losing a fight in overwatch who's gonna
learn how to break rdc so he's a girl on team in a team of

169
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,440
only game

170
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:11,940
that's that's why this is why I this is why I picked king
guys not the plan to be break this is why I wanted to play

171
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:23,120
king as my secondary character because king is only merely
just a backup a backup for my actual main character which I

172
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:40,440
will leave as a secret for now he's only he's only the
backup guys and anyway i am super hyped to try out haiti's

173
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:49,540
tour the early access uh so yeah they just dropped this out
of nowhere and was just like hey guys uh you thought this

174
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:57,840
was silk song jokes on you guys we actually completed a game
here's haiti silk i'm sorry i'm sorry that's like silk song

175
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:09,220
does not deserve that random stray hit um anyway uh they
basically dropped Hades 2 out of out of nowhere and um I'm

176
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:19,220
super excited because I very much enjoyed Hades 1 so I'm
very excited to try out hate that hurts toky I'm very um

177
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:27,580
very excited to try out Hades 2 just like every other
streamer out there uh because the FOMO was hitting it real

178
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:35,420
hard the fear of missing out was real hard you guys might i
might be like the 800th and 76th streamer you've watched

179
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:54,520
playing hades 2 um and uh and now i'm gonna be at 877th
streamer to watch me play watch play hades to yeah area i

180
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:02,600
heard it was really good i heard that like uh i heard like
majority of the game was practically finished in terms of

181
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:13,000
like the meat of it and like the only thing they haven't
really added yet was the ending and like some of the visual

182
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,040
assets like some of the like visuals and stuff that hasn't
uh and so yeah there's apparently a lot of content it's not

183
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:30,700
finished yet it's merely early access but people are telling
me that the ending the ending isn't uh done yet and it's

184
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,220
missing a lot of like just visual assets but like the main
game itself like there's a lot story and stuff a lot of like

185
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:44,020
audio and stuff is done uh already so yeah it's gonna be
interesting It's gonna be interesting to see.

186
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,060
What's up?

187
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,420
All right, is Sound Guy on?

188
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,260
Sound Guy!

189
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,860
He's on!

190
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,020
I see you, Sound Guy.

191
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,340
All right, let's go.

192
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,400
We're using mouse and keyboard.

193
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,820
Welcome to Hades 2.

194
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,640
This game is in early access, which means we're actively
working on it based on our plans.

195
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah, see?

196
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,180
Early access.

197
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,860
Good luck killing time.

198
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,800
Whoa, whoa!

199
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,600

once his past caught up with him but gods do not go quietly

You're not like my high school friends that make fun of my
Cantonese.

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:51,980
Trauma.

Whoa, Hades.

What happened?

234
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,780
Damn, Hades.

235
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,120
All right.

236
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,040
I have this.

237
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,300
What's this?

238
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,100
What the fuck did I use?

239
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,220
What is this?

240
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,500
Okay.

241
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:09,840
Okay.

242
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,820
I have no idea what any of these buttons are.

243
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,340
E.

244
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,820
Kronos is the fathers of Hades?

245
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,700
Oh, shit!

246
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,240
Okay.

247
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,060
Sorry.

248
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,020
It's been a while.

249
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,900
Okay.

250
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,800
There we go.

251
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,400
Sorry.

252
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,260
It's been a while.

253
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,740
Forgot what dodging is like.

254
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm already going full king at the moment where it's full
offensive.

255
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,620
No defense.

256
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,200
My favorite.

257
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,640
No knees.

262
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,040
I don't... Wait, who's he?

263
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,600
Who's this guy?

264
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,180
It's just another spell.

265
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,850
Accept this message.

266
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,710
Who is this guy?

267
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,650
Oh, Apollo!

268
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,810
You can't get to the Titan, but if you truly mean to stop
him, then the least I can do is light your way down.

269
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,810
Have I seen Apollo before?

270
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,670
I don't remember anything except for Aphrodite and Poseidon.

271
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,210
the snow grandma who I hated the power-ups from.

272
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,810
Nova's strike.

273
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,450
Hi.

274
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,490
Look, the thing is, they're all, they're gods and goddesses.

275
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:02,850
They're supposed, they're meant to be like the hottest thing
is out there because they're gods and goddesses.

276
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,270
Yeah, they're all supposed to be hot.

277
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,330
Oh, Apollo is new.

278
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,870
Okay.

279
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,010
Let's see.

280
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,330
Your attacks deal more damage.

281
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,170
Your sprint is faster and inflicts daze.

282
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,250
When standing in your cast, gradually restore.

283
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,570
What is the magic required for powerful?

284
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,510
Wait, what should I get, guys?

285
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,170
Blinding Sprint?

286
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,750
Nova Strike?

287
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,190
You guys can't be like, Doki, the game came out.

288
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,250
We don't know what's good yet.

289
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,250
You can't say that.

290
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:36,650
Because Hades 2 has already been grinded and analyzed and,
like, inspected for fucking hours now.

291
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,890
Like, for, like, days.

292
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,530
Everybody knows what's meta.

293
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,850
It's already been inspected.

294
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,250
and analyze and theorize.

295
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,510
All right, let's do the audio.

296
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,550
Let's see.

297
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,950
You put music at 80, sound effects at 90.

298
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,110
Okay, I'll put the music at 70 then.

299
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,670
And then we bring up the overall game.

300
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:07,830
All right.

301
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,250
Okay, maybe I'll turn this down too.

302
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,590
But that's ambience.

303
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,130
Whoops.

304
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,250
All right, let's just put...

305
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,730
Alright, and then we'll adjust the game volume.

306
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:19,950
Yeah!

307
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,170
Alright, here we go.

308
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,530
No roller?

309
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,450
We don't need roller.

310
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,570
We gotta practice M and K for the tournament too.

311
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,630
Because I'm using lever at least.

312
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:30,670
Boop!

313
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,150
There you go, snared.

314
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,590
I don't like this weapon at all.

315
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,330
Not gonna lie.

316
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,670
I missed the...

317
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,270
I missed the gun and the bow.

318
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,330
I think gun and bow was the best.

319
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,070
Not huge fan.

320
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,290
Hoop.

321
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,230
Oh shit.

322
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,910
What are these guys?

323
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,670
What is the story?

324
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,130
Am I not gonna find out the story until I die?

325
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,810
Just like in Hades 1?

326
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,470
I think that was how it happened in Hades 1.

327
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,850
I didn't find out the story until I died.

328
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:02,730
Wait.

329
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,930
Wait, what's that?

330
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,010
What did I get?

331
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,010
Mostly used with incantation involving dispelling and
nullification.

332
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:11,790
Okay.

333
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,230

334
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,570

342
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,290

Oh my god, it's like they named these monsters after
kindergarteners!

345
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,130
Okay.

346
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,350
This is it.

347
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,190

I am trying to have a nice yapping session with my dragoons.

354
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,730

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,470
How does it count?

368
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,910
I looked at chat!

369
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,330
Guys, I looked at chat!

370
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,110
Oh my god, I can put the frogs.

371
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,470
It was ping.

372
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,470
I swear it was the ping, guys.

373
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,610
I swear.

374
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,930
It was the ping.

375
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,830
Oh, is that...

376
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,330

377
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,010
Am I the baby?

378
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,150
This old unfinished painting.

379
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:51,970
Don't look away.

380
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,090
Don't forget all that the titan took.

381
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,750
It doesn't count.

382
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,870
Don't make me restart my game right now and start a new save
file.

383
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,530
You know what?

384

00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,690
Oh my gosh, I can't believe they dropped this early axis.

392
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,810
They dropped this early axis out of nowhere!

393
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,210

Of course they're hot.

417
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,420
They're all supposed to be hot because they're a god.

418
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,980
I need my aid.

419
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,140
Let's see if I need this.

420
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,120
Um, I swear I saw it before.

421
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,280
Yeah, from like the stream you watch before me.

422
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
Because everybody's been playing Hades 2 now.

423
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,940
So of course you've seen him before.

424
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,440
Like, I don't know what you mean.

425
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,500
Okay, let's lock him up here.

426
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,620

Alright, we adjust the volume a little bit too.

429
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,840
We put sound effects down another 10.

430
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,680
Okay, I'll put like 62.

431
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,680

432
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,320
Okay, that means 60.

433
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,520
That means 10.

434
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,920
And then And then we'll bring up the game a little bit more.

435
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,640
All right, let me know.

436
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,580
Okay.

437
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,240
There we go.

438
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,300
That should be good, right?

439
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,620
Oh, shit.

440
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,000
No mistakes.

441
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,660
Oh, my God.

442
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,620
No hit run right here.

443
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,420
First time playing, I already got no hit run.

444
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,820
That's actually crazy.

445
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,100
I'm actually naturally talented at this game.

446
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,780
Wait, what's an ash?

447
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,780
Alright, let's grab this real fast.

448
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
So close to greatness.

449
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,200
Alright, sound guy.

450
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,380
Let me know if this sounds better.

451
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,420
This game is pretty easy for now.

452
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,720
I don't know.

453
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,820
I don't really feeling this weapon, though.

454
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,260
So far.

455
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,520
Oh, still no hit run.

456
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,400
Still a no hit run.

457
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,880
I don't know what your dad's talking about.

458
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,060
There we go.

459
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,080
Nice.

460
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,980
Oh, oh, wait.

461
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,540
No, oh, shit.

462
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,680
How could he touch me like that?

463
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,200
Does not know I'm a god?

464
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,860
I just hit him from here.

465
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,910
I don't think they can hurt me.

466
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,000
Thanks for rewinding this stream.

467
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,140

Oh, shit.

472
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,740

00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,860
Wait, what's this?

474
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,980
I actually don't know this.

475
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,380

481
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,880
The attacks are so slow, so I can literally just spam this.

482
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,800
Okay, and then he gets close to me here.

483
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
Yeah, I can literally just spam this in there.

484
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,740
Okay, give me a sec.

485
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,560
Do not expect him to actually get close to me, though.

486
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,500
That was, like, the one thing that was going to counter me.

487
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,600
Distance.

488
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,680
Yeah, I could literally just spam this forever.

489
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,780
It's so nice.

490
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
And then...

491
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,020
Well, she says that she dies.

492
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,760
What do you mean?

493
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,860
I made it so far for my first try.

494
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,300
Damn, Doki, doing so good.

495
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,720
Not like the streamer I was just watching.

496
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:51,900
Thank you.

497
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,120
Thank you for the super chat.

498
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,590
Thank you.

499
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,240
I wonder who that streamer could be.

500
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,460
Was it Boki Derd?

501
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Yeah, Boki Derd's pretty fucking bad at video games.

502
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,260
What a good girl you are.

503
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,520
And here I was just about to burn this old blasted place to
the ground myself.

504
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,160
Oh, Hestia.

505
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,160
Wait, is this another gilf?

506
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,940
Oh my god.

507
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,500
And she's Scottish, too.

508
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,280
See?

509
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,620
There's a granny for everybody.

510
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
It's like, would you want a Scottish granny?

511
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,980
Or the other one?

512
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,780
She's new.

513
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,820
Yeah, she's new.

514
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:43,120
all right your your cast repeatedly inflict scorch or
restore but you have minus 20 20 no what the your special

515
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:56,740
launches a fiery projectile but uses 10 magic controlled or
i feel like scorch would be better right one wouldn't one be

516
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:04,400
better yeah but then i lose 20 of health a change to your
bad?

517
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,020
Because I lose my health limit and stuff.

518
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,360
I feel like I'm gonna go with one.

519
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,300
Fire damage.

520
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,500
Wait, another scorch.

521
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,380
But then there's a boss.

522
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,760
But then I can have money.

523
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,680
Wait, is this a shop?

524
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,260
This is a shop, right?

525
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,220
How much money do I have?

526
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,780
77.

527
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,160
Alright, left or right?

528
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,600
Money or granny?

529
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,300
Money or granny?

530
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,080
Oh, I lose a shop?

531
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,500
Okay.

532
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,760
Doki Bird is so much better than that last chokin.

533
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,120
Yeah, that sounds like a gamer that fucking sucks.

534
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,360
Sharon.

535
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,780
Oh, hey, there he is.

536
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,980
I'm in your debt, Lord Karan.

537
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,520
These provisions surely shall make all the difference in my
task.

538
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,520
Wait, I don't have money.

539
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,080
Wait, can we actually date him now?

540
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,820
If you date deaf, you can never die.

541
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,220
Pro tip.

542
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,660
I'll just grab the plus one smoldering.

543
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,740
Because you guys fucked me over.

544
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,920
Oh, it's a placeholder.

545
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,180
He just wasn't hot enough.

546
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,540
Sorry, guys.

547
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
They were like, whoa!

548
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,360
Okay, don't be that close to the ring guy.

549
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,220
I figured it out.

550
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,840
I learned.

551
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,700
I need to make sure.

552
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

553
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,620
I got stuck here because I couldn't dash.

554
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,700
Oh!

555
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,120
Okay, that was bullshit.

556
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,000
I actually got hit by everything that was possible.

557
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,160
That was actually crazy.

558
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,300
Like, anything that could hit me, hit me there.

559
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,760
Oh, my God.

560
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,420
Just don't get close.

561
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,220
Just don't get close.

562
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,580
Just don't get close.

563
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,900
Just stay back here.

564
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,300
Safe in your safe space.

565
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,400
There's no way they could catch me now.

566
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,420
I'm safe.

567
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,080
Look at that.

568
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,120
There's no way.

569
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,460
Range them.

570
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,640
This is it.

571
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,700
This is the key.

572
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,300
If I range them, they can never hit me.

573
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,980
Wait, they're arranging me.

574
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,100
Wait, that's illegal.

575
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,500
Wait a minute.

576
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,260
Why are you running away from me?

577
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,920
This was my strat.

578
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,560
They're using my strat against me.

579
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,560
What the fuck is wrong with these freaks?

580
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,460
I'm the main character.

581
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:25,920
Okay.

582
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,520
That's fine.

583
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,000
If I spam this, if I spam right click, they'll never get me.

584
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,560
Nice.

585
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,260
They're better at your strad.

586
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,520
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

587
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,140
Wait, what's this?

588
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,420
What's the time?

589
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,820
There's a time and then there's heart.

590
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,880
I don't remember any of these.

591
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,620
Is that HP?

592
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,920
The god of cheese.

593
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,960
Right side, left or right.

594
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,440
Oh, is this coins?

595
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,580
Oh, they're coins.

596
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,140
They're time coins.

597
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,260
We'll get health.

598
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:20,900
they're like time coins i see oh no guys guys this is a bit
bad just just a little bit just a little bad all right just

599
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:30,060
a little bit i just gotta keep running okay nice and then
they'll just go in the fire and then i'll just be over here

600
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,880
You can't get me if I, like...

601
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,500
Oh, see, they can't get me.

602
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,720
Oh my god, I almost, like, fucking ran into that guy.

603
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,520
Because I assumed he was stunned.

604
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,620
Nice.

605
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,440
Easy.

606
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,660
I got my heart back.

607
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,200
See?

608
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,380
Nothing to worry about for my very first run.

609
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,320
You guys said Ash is the best, right?

610
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,080
Ash is better than whatever the fuck this is.

611
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,000
What is that?

612
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,780
Psych?

613
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,040
To activate more.

614
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,040
More mostly used.

615
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,680
Is ash the best one?

616
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,740
To farm?

617
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,960
That's our god of cheese.

618
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,440
Alright, we'll do more ash.

619
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,300
I love cheesing the game.

620
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,480
As well as built for.

621
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,320
This is why I'm totally not playing king.

622
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,300
Alright, I need to stay back here.

623
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:29,980
It'll be fine.

624
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,100
okay i hate the worms though the worms are actually really
cringe like i can't believe they would like run away from me

625
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:47,260
kind of player are you okay i can stun these guys before
they do anything which is good and i'll just burn these guys

626
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:59,700
real fast and then oh i don't like that whoa stay away from
me stay away before me screamer and then get rid of him and

627
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,840
it will get rid of you.

628
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:01,780
Easy.

629
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,020
They can't use my strut against me.

630
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,520
I copyrighted and trademarked it.

631
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,880
They gotta pay me first.

632
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,340
Wait, what's the purple?

633
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,820
Every time you use my strut, you gotta pay me a 5%
commission fee.

634
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,460
What's the purple?

635
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,100
New.

636
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,920
But is it a good new or a bad new?

637
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,920
Another currency?

638
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,180
What?

639
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Bones are a currency?

640
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,520
Alright, who wants me to... who wants to give me their
bones?

641
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:28,940
Oh!

642
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:29,900
What?

643
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,560
Whoa!

644
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,340
They locked me in.

645
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,900
I thought I could run around here.

646
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,380
That's bullshit.

647
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,380
Oh god, oh, oh wait, I don't like this guy.

648
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,100
Wait, wait, this guy fucking sucks.

649
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,580
All right, nice.

650
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,120
Yeah, they actually rushed me.

651
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,800
Actually, really don't.

652
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,560
Oh wait, he's stuck.

653
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,900
He's actually stuck.

654
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,000
Wait, use the trees against them.

655
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,800
Okay, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

656
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:00,960
Nice.

657
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,360
Oh, the terrain kill kills everybody.

658
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:04,860
Okay, I'm learning.

659
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:06,940
Bones.

660
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,540
What is the bones?

661
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,440
Common reward for clearing.

662
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,520
Most used for trades for most valuable resources.

663
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,940
I guess I won't find out until I die.

664
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,160
It's gonna be hard because I don't die.

665
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,540
Alright, let's see.

666
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,600
The tree is actually so good for destroying stuff.

667
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,300
Your cast snares them, by the way.

668
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,580
Yeah, I noticed that.

669
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,040
Yeah, the banishing is fucking sick.

670
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,240
suck.

671
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:30,940
I hate it.

672
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,080
Alright.

673
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,600
Does it sound better now, Songye?

674
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,060
Okay.

675
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,900
Okay, and then I'll just use this and spam.

676
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,120
Wait, never mind.

677
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,140
I should like this weapon.

678
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,740
This weapon's pretty cool.

679
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
I'd never have to get close to them again.

680
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:55,680
Whoa!

681
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,500
Oh!

682
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,540
I stopped looking at my screen!

683
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,200
Okay, so I actually stopped looking at my screen because I
kept spamming.

684
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,060
It's a very nice cheese weapon.

685
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,040
Oh, shit.

686
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,520
Oh, no.

687
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,460
Oh, no.

688
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,540
Oh, thank God I snared them, though.

689
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,120
Guys, I don't think they like it.

690
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,940
It's okay, I can do it again.

691
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,720
Yeah, just line up for me, guys.

692
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,280

697
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,380
Can I do freeze and fire?

698
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,800
Wait, is it possible to do freeze and fire at the same time?

699
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,100
Oh, but then that's a rare.

700
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,860
Wait, you're right.

701
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,000
Is weed killed here?

702

Good?

703
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,880
Uh, we'll try it, I guess.

704
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,220
Two is the best sprint.

705
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,520
Oh!

706
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,700
They're all good!

707
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,220
She's just to have the worst fucking power-ups, Granny.

708
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,220
What happened?

709
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,440
What happened to me there?

710
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:04,680
Huh?

711
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:09,610
One.

712
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,030
Okay.

713
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,410
Ice and fire.

714
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,610
Three is an early winner.

715
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,330
Why did you not say that?

716
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,570
Why did you not say three is an early win?

717
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,350
Early game.

718
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,790
I would have picked that.

719
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:24,780
No!

720
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,180
Okay, I gain max magic.

721
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:30,700
Okay.

722
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,240
You can never charge attacks, though.

723
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,540
Oh, shit.

724
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,200
Wait, what?

725
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,320
What the fuck was that?

726
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,300
Wait, I could do that?

727
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,840
Oh, my God.

728
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,560
Guys!

729
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,280
Did you guys know you can charge?

730
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,420
Oh, guys.

731
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,620
Did you know you can charge attacks?

732
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,580
Guys, I discovered a new tech.

733
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:55,860
Everybody.

734
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,540
Live, right here on stream, the first person to use this new
tech.

735
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,540
No way.

736
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,860
Turkey, please.

737
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:11,880
Hekate.

738
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,720
Oh, she's my teacher.

739
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,660
Look at her abs.

740
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,920
For all your guidance and the compliment.

741
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,420
In my place, you'd have done the same.

742
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,920
However, now is not the time for pleasant...

743
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,100
I'm pretty sure some of my goons here wanted to get stepped
on by her.

744
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,020
My capability?

745
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,580
My capabilities?

746
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,220
Even though my task has already begun.

747
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,780
Your training shall never be complete.

748
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,700
And I would...

749
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,560
Oh, whoops, sorry, I feel actually finished talking.

750
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,540
What's going on?

751
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,360
What's going on?

752
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,920
Whoa!

753
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,340

00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:55,680
Why?

756
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,180
What the fuck?

757
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,360
I don't like this.

758
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,900

I don't know.

774
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,840
I think I made it pretty far for my first try.

775
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,360
I mean, I got to the boss stage.

776
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:04,700
That was pretty good.

777
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,520
Yeah, that was good for a first run.

778
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,780
Hello, little frog.

forgot to ask you.

00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,280
I forgot to read the chat.

Pale shades.

A fight is just getting started.

00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,270
Holy mom.

Oh, you already ditch Hecatee?

You're not loyal.

816
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,950
Jackoos, you're not loyal.

817
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,650
You're already willing to ditch Hecatee.

818
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,050
You're witch abs.

Wait, what?

00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,750

Let me pet!

831
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:36,990
Guys, to be fair, it makes sense that you're adding, because
this is like...

832
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:44,630
You know, the mythos back then, the Romans and the Greeks
banged everything.

833
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,170
So, like, it makes sense.

834
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,670
There were orgies everywhere.

835
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,550
We're just following the lore.

836
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,810
Had Mistress lent me the Arcana?

837
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,090

I don't even know how much I have.

857
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:38,930

859
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,730

Which is the best one so far for you guys.

866
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:53,770
What do you guys think is the best one?

867
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,710
A battle lost.

868
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,050
But he has a beard?

869
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,230
One and you have many battles yet to come.

870
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,490
The only question is, are you prepared?

871
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,070
to win.

872
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,350
I'm not so sure here, so let's see you give me 20.

873
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,010
Okay.

874
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:11,410
Wait, what?

875
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,530
Okay, and then...

876
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,810
And then press or hold.

877
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:18,690
Oh my god.

878
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,450
I'm running.

879
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,970
Oh, when you hold, you can sprint!

880
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,450
Oh!

881
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,030
Wait, is there a cooldown to sprinting?

882
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:29,550
Let me check.

883
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,330
Wait, there's no cooldown when it comes to sprinting.

884
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:34,050
Hold.

885
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,810
And then...

886
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,710
Special, then hold to release.

887
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:42,210
Alright.

888
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,530
I did it.

889
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,450
Oh, I didn't have to just strike him.

890
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,550
And then...

891
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,790
Guys, I can't believe it.

892
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,170
I could have...

893
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,070
I could have fucking charged this up.

894
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:56,350
Yay!

895
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,850
Wait, what if I kill him?

896
00:59:59,050 --> 00:59:59,570
Alright.

897
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:00,270

01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:33,370

elizium and too risky to stay It's time.

901
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,350
Wait, did I just accidentally started the game?

902
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,110
Oh, no.

903
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,570
It was just lore.

904
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,550
Okay, I'll see it be like, oh, that's awkward.

905

907
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,090
I feel like I'm going to get lost.

908
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,670
Not lost, but like, I feel like I'm going to get more
confused if I just keep running.

909
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,070
That sounds like something what I would do.

910

01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,420
Oh, okay.

1018
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,640
Okay.

1019
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,620
The mana one is actually really good.

1020
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,300
I'll do two then.

1021
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,300
I'll get more mana.

1022
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,360
Oh my, this is beautiful.

1023
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,200
Thank you.

1024
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,500
Oh no.

1025
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,140
No!

1026
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,320
It's okay.

1027
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,000
I have a vampire.

1028
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,520
Did not grab my HP back?

1029
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,540
No!

1030
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,500
I lost a bit of my fucking armor.

1031
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,360
Alright, let's see.

1032
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,400
Well, we need max HP.

1033
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,080
Oh, I'm so sad.

1034
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,480
I'm so sad.

1035
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,220
To your success.

1036
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,080
Okay.

1037
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,220
Oh, gosh.

1038
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,020
Oh, wait, I got my HP back.

1039
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,660

1040
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,540

01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,680

01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,740
We're actually getting better.

1044
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:14,720
And then...

1045
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,760

1054
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,320
I can't believe it.

1055
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:13,200
Every attack just magically hit.

1056
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,780

1063
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:53,860
It's okay.

1065
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:56,540

1069
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,520
Wait, what?

1070
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,000
I don't know.

1071
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,360
I actually don't know what that was.

1072
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,680
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1073
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:12,940
Nope.

1074
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,180
Oh.

1075
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,440
Okay, I thought that would get closer.

1076
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,460
Not gonna lie.

1077
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,360
Okay, and then we'll kill him with this.

1078
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:22,520
It's okay.

1079
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:23,600
It's slowed.

1080
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,420
Now kill him with this.

1081
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,560
And then this.

1082
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,040
And then that should be the last guy.

1083
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,000
Yay!

1084
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,520
That was not the last guy.

1085
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,080
Not yay.

1086
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:35,560
Fine.

1087
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,080
I have mana regen.

1088
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:39,420
Alright.

1089
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,060
Oh god.

1090
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,840
Almost got hit by that.

1091
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,380
Okay.

1092
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,160
Hoop.

1093
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:45,800
Whoa!

1094
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:47,300

1096
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,080
All right.

1097
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,220
That should hit them.

1098
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:56,520
Oh!

1099
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,140
No!

1100
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,860
My honor!

1101
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,820
Oh, I'm ready for HP.

1102
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:01,540
That's fine.

1103
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,680
That's okay.

1104
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,580
I already got my HP back.

1105
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,460
He's up to something, but not even Athena knows what.

1106
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,740
His assaults on Olympus always fail.

1107
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,600
Even if they've kept us occupied.

1108
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,360
What's his next move?

1109
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,720
What is his next move?

1110
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:24,520
okay your attack deals more damage in larger area your
sprint is faster and flick days on nearby foes okay this

1111
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:30,480
would be helpful if i actually used my sprint how you take
damage your foe takes damage and you flick days on wait

1112
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:42,460
wouldn't lights might be good too one your attack deals more
damage okay we'll do one i see more ones in chat oh ash time

01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:47,660

1114
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:49,640
Whoa.

1115
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,940
Okay, I'm going to put this out.

1116
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,980
So, I'm going to put this out.

1117
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,000
If I keep using this, I'll never get close to me to hit me.

1118
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:57,820
See?

1119
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,040
Oh my god, I'm so fucking smart.

1120
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,020
And now I'll just regen.

1121
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,060
And I'll just do this again.

1122
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,260
Count right now.

1123
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,280
Oh, wait.

1124
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,820
What do you mean you can't?

1125
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,360
You can or you won't.

1126
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,340
Alright, nice.

1127
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:11,900
Alright.

01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:13,720
Can't touch me.

1129
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:15,880
Yay.

1130
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,140
I don't need to use charge normal if I can just kill them.

1131
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,540
See, I recharge.

1132
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:29,180
Why would I need to use charge when I can just use charge
normal when I can just do this all the time?

1133
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:30,480
Yay!

1134
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:31,460
Okay.

1135
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,380
Guys, I think I cannot just do this all the time.

1136
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,520
Oh!

1137
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,960
I'm sorry!

1138
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:48,280
Guys, I think I figured out that this game will not Let me
use charge all the time.

1139
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,020
I can't believe it getting punished.

1140
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,980
Say it ain't so.

1141
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,780
Uh, what was this?

1142
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,700
It's upgrade, right?

1143
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,660
Should I get health or upgrades, chat?

1144
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,700
Spam magic feed.

1145
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,540
Like, what would be better?

1146
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,140
Upgrade?

1147
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,140
Alright, upgrade.

1148
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,200
Uh.

1149
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,140
Yay!

1150
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, not yay, not yay.

1151
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,880
Okay, yay.

1152
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,720
It was, in fact, not yay.

1153
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,700
I mean, I can just stay up here.

1154
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,060
Whoa.

1155
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,780
Okay, so then she won't touch me here.

1156
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,780
See, I can cast.

1157
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,180
Normally.

1158
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:37,480
I don't abuse my power-ups.

1159
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,800
No verse strike, geyser ring, Denny's doing that.

1160
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,980
Wait, that's so good.

1161
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,340
Okay, but that's 25, 35.

1162
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,020
Wait, should I get Geyser Ring?

1163
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,060
I feel like Geyser Ring or Attack.

1164
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,140
Yeah, I feel like I'm using Geyser Ring so much.

1165
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:54,740
Yeah.

1166
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,080
Uh, Shop, do I have money?

1167
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,720
I have 182.

1168
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,000
I still don't know what that is, though.

1169
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,320
Alright.

1170
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,160
Shop or whatever the fuck that is.

1171
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,400
I still have no idea.

1172
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,240
Shop?

1173
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,160
All right, shop time.

1174
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,780

1175
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,380

place.

01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,760
Not my armor.

1193
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,480
Oh, this is not good.

1194
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,160
I lost my armor because I was fucking around too much.

1195
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:01,980
Nice.

1196
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,140
And then slow.

1197
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,380
And I'll just keep spamming that here.

1198
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,480
Okay.

1199
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,180
Nice.

1200
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,980
Wait, she has armor.

1201
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,280
That's not fair.

1202
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:15,860
Where's my armor?

1203
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,820
I'm a witch too, aren't I?

1204
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1205
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,880
Okay, and then, oh, this is Toho.

1206
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:24,840
I don't like this.

1207
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,140
I hate Toho.

1208
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,660
I hate- oh, oh, oh, okay.

1209
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,100
I'm not good at Toho, please.

1210
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,020
Why is the first boss Toho?

1211
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,400
It's not fair!

1212
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,500
Oh, I ran out of mana.

1213
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:40,720
Oh god.

1214
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:41,760
Oh!

1215
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,240
Okay, we're fine.

1216
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,020
I have the reaction time.

1217
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,400
It's fine.

1218
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,460
We're halfway there.

1219
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,200
Okay, nice.

1220
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,060
It's just gonna draw back.

1221
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,240
And then, go!

1222
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,640
Alright.

1223
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,740
It's okay, it's okay.

1224
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,240
We're making good progress.

1225
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,360
The moment she talks, I know it's the wrong!

1226
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,500
Fuck, this is so wrong!

1227
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:04,720
This is the real one!

1228
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:05,940
I got the real Hecatee!

1229
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,280
Let's see where they...

1230
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,200
Whoa!

1231
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:08,900
Evaded.

1232
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,400
I don't know, girl.

1233
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,720
I evaded it!

1234
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,140
Okay, I can just do this.

1235
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,060
I can just spam this.

1236
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:20,700
There you go.

1237
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,440

1238
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:40,680

1240
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:57,720
we're okay Wait, if I lose my armor, I don't get my recharge
of mana.

1241
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,870
Why did nobody tell me instead of making me read?

1242
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:17,130
People could have told me this If I knew I wouldn't have
fucked around

1243
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,420
You guys knew that!

1244
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,540
I wouldn't have fucked around!

1245
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,420
With my armor!

1246
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,860
Okay, now I know, though.

1247
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,560
Now I know.

1248
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:42,780
Oh, shit.

1249
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,320
Oh, shit.

1250
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,480
Which one is it, though?

1251
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,360
It's her.

1252
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:47,520
It's her.

1253
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:48,340
Alright.

1254
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,640
That's all I'm seeing.

1255
01:21:51,820 --> 01:22:01,280
If I knew this earlier, I definitely would have not messed
about Turkey Cathery.

1256
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,960
You fought with diligence and with ferocity.

1257
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,320
Surely there is more for you to learn beyond this threshold.

1258
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,000
I did it.

1259
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,980
I look forward to it, headmistress.

1260
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,560
What about you?

1261
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:18,940
Can you not join me?

1262
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,380

1266
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,980
there's a problem there already

1267
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,160
Okay.

1268
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,300
Nice.

01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,140
Does he join my heels?

1271
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:02,900
Oh, nice.

1272
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,320
I got my heels back.

1273
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:05,540
Yay!

1274
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,160
Why won't you and your abs join me?

1275
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,260
What's this?

1276
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,580
The rim of Oceanus?

1277
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,940
It's like an ocean.

1278
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:20,740
Oh, no.

1279
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:21,600
Hello?

1280
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,220
Who are you?

1281
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,280
Strife Incarnate.

1282
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,320
The game?

1283
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,140
The RTS?

1284
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,540
Things took a ton, Aris.

1285
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:34,680
You know how it goes.

1286
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,740
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some urgent business.

1287
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,600
Was that gun?

1288
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,640
They had guns back then?

1289
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,360
Always in such a rush.

1290
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,040
I'd really hate to slow you down.

1291
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,800
Though, let's hang out some time, okay?

1292
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,040
Have a great night.

1293
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,540
Oh, one last thing.

1294
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,260
What did she do to me?

1295
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,220
Blessed by strife?

1296
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,200
Yeah, what did she do to me?

1297
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,100
Uh...

1298
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,080
What did she do?

1299
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,320
Wait, I didn't even say what she did.

1300
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,900
Wait, wait a minute.

1301
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,260
Oh my god!

1302
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:08,700
Okay.

1303
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,260
I still don't know what she did.

1304
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,160
She debuffed me?

1305
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,400
How do I check?

1306
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,060
Whoa!

1307
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,380
Wait, how do I check the debuff?

1308
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,420
Oh my god, they're so strong.

1309
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:27,180
This is actually not fair Press B

1310
01:24:43,660 --> 01:25:01,900
Guys if you guys did not know B does not pause the game Oh
my fucking god I lost so much HP Because I fucking pressed B

1311

1313
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,120
Yeah, totally wasn't you.

1314
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,500
I can't believe it.

1315
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:34,900
I can't believe that.

1316
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,540
Guys fucking me up like this.

1317
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,740
Oh, I'm a streamer.

1318
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,460
Of course I was gonna press B.

1319
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,020
I literally heard press B.

1320
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,780
And I was like, oh, B.

1321
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,020
I wonder what B does.

1322
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,980
If you tell me to press B, First, I'm gonna press it.

1323
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,960
Like, it's just simple.

1324
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,240
Simple button pressing.

1325
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,140
Streamer sees press B.

1326
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,400
She presses.

1327
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,700
No one told.

1328
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,380
Said it was a...

1329
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,040
It's because I looked at it.

1330
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,540
It should be a pause.

1331
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,560
But it should be.

1332
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:21,280
That's why I don't understand why I could not.

1333
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,660
Okay, there you go.

1334
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:24,720
I'll just spatton this.

1335
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:26,280
Yay.

1336
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,340
Oh my god, they're so strong.

1337
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,360
Oh, this is not good.

1338
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,480
Yeah, alright, we're gonna...

1339
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:38,080
We're gonna make sure they don't touch me.

1340
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,860
By shooting them here.

1341
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,280
Oh, this is good.

1342
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,760
My attacks are really strong right now.

1343
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,160
I'll put this here so they don't, like, touch me.

1344
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,240
They don't get close enough to touch me.

1345
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:49,320
Alright.

1346
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,360
Nice.

1347
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,860
And then we'll get that out of the way.

1348
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,340
Woo!

1349
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,460
Alright, we're good.

1350
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:56,700
Good.

1351
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,060
Yay, money!

1352
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:00,440
For me!

1353
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,860
I love money.

1354
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,140
I love money.

1355
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,440
They're so strong, though.

1356
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,260
I have enough for a shop.

1357
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,320
Personal space deployed.

1358
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,040
My five meters.

1359
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:16,380
Wait, what's this?

1360
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:17,740
Oh, that's the shield.

1361
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,160
Do I have enough?

1362
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,480
Wait, I think I have enough.

1363
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,580
I have enough to buy a shield.

1364
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,160
There's sprint forms in Cyclone.

1365
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,460
We enter a location.

1366
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,180
Prime a barrier that absorbs one.

1367
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,980
Wait, there it is!

1368
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,820
There's the weed killer!

1369
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,900
You guys said the weed killer is really good, right?

1370
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:37,460

Okay.

1377
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,160
It's better when it's rare.

1378
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:08,700
Okay, I'll do the sprint then and we'll see what the wait

Is this gonna be my mana regen armor guys?

1380
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,200
Or like is it like a different armor?

Um, I don't want to fight a boss, so I'm going to go to
Poseidon.

1390
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,760
I'm doing the bare minimum.

Wait, what?

1401
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,960
I didn't get max HP.

1402
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:11,980
How could that be?

1403
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,860

Wait, where's my vampire?

1408
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:25,680
Oh, God.

1409
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,780
Oh, my God.

1410
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,660
Oh, gosh.

1411
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:31,300
Oh, no touch.

1412
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:31,800
Oh, no touch.

1413
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,640
No touch.

1414
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,180
Oh, my God.

1415
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:35,760
What?

1416
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:36,440
No.

1417
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:37,800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1418
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,590
Okay.

1419
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:41,330
It's fine.

1420
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:41,770
It's fine.

1421
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:44,810
Oh, this is not fine.

1422
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:45,690
This is not fine.

1423
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,050
This is not fine.

1424
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,930
Only on charge attacks and only on kills.

1425
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:51,510
Okay.

1426
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:53,830
That's that is also fine.

1427
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:55,670
So I'm just gonna make it so.

1428
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:57,050
Okay.

1429
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:01,170
I need to make sure I don't get hit by that.

1430
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,650
No way he can hit me from back here.

1431
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:07,350
I'll just recharge my mana.

1432
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:09,410
Hello, guys.

1433
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:11,430

01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:20,910
Okay, and then I'll just wait until I charge that up.

1437
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:22,930
And I'll wait until I charge that up.

1438
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:24,590
And I should get my HP.

1439
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,070
Wait, it didn't give me the HP.

1440
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:31,190
It's when normal cast doesn't work on specials.

01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:31,670

01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:07,070

01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:10,290

And then that should give me my HP back.

1474
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:20,030

I don't even know what hit me!

1491
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,910
Uh...

1492
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:23,830
Your special hits a force with splash that knocks the attack
deals more damage in a larger area.

1493
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:25,830
Uh...

1494
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:26,810
Those three orbs?

1497
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,780
Oh, it's a debuff!

1498
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:38,100
I forgot Every time I get hit, fucking Ares.

1499
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,320
There's a reason why nobody invites you to anything.

1500
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,580
No one likes you.

1501
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:43,680
Okay.

1502
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:45,640

Wait, that is so good.

1506
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,300
We can have more damage.

1507
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,920
Wait, we got another one.

1508
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,680
We're so lucky.

1509
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,400

1510
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:07,540

Yay, gambling!

1513
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,160

1515
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:21,100

Two?

1519
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:30,620
Nova strikes for me, two.

01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:31,780
Okay, we'll go with two.

1521
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,600

01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:16,220
Okay.

1549
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:17,700
Alright.

1550
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,020
Okay, recharge.

1551
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,400
Let me recharge a little bit.

1552
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,080
These guys are actual, like, griefers.

1553
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:25,920
Not gonna lie.

1554
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,900
They're actual griefers.

1555
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,720
Oh, it's because he's, like, a mini boss.

1556
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,080
That makes sense.

1557
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:32,300
Wait, I can farm him.

1558
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,560
I can stand still and farm him.

1559
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:36,880
Oh, okay.

1560
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:37,300
Nice.

1561
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:37,560
Alright.

1562
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,120
Nice.

1563
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:40,800
Yes!

1564
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:43,060
Got my HP back.

1565
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,260
Okay, this is actually good for me.

1566
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,200
These guys can give me so much HP.

1567
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:53,520
And then I can just, like, put the snare out so they can't
touch me here.

1568
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:55,900
Alright, nice.

1569
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,100
Alright, and then snare.

1570
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,520
Okay, here we go.

1571
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,640
And then I'll just snare them here.

1572
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:06,780
Snare!

1573
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:09,600
Wait, I know the stride now!

1574
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:19,600
okay nice look at that strategy I told you I can use my
brain it's only when it matters and a lot of times it

1575
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,780
doesn't matter

1576
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:32,480
it's not my fault that like I'm always on power save mode
guys it's just because I'm on power save mode doesn't mean I

1577
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:45,500

that's not good though Okay, I just need to make sure they

Slinked down into the underworld, have you?

Beats the pressure trying to make art while all our fans are
watching.

Begging.

1594

Have you even got any left?

1611
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:11,140
This is my new hate.

1612
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,380
I hate this boss.

1613
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:25,160
it's brooding to have this memory of all you lost it stokes
your want for vengeance even now bro i never hated it you

1614
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:33,660

person they just add two more they add like more bosses in a

1615
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:42,460
one boss fight game and like it it's just to like spike the
difficulty i hate that mechanic so much i think that's a

1616
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:50,420
fucking bullshit shit boss battle because you have to pay
attention to three different bosses that have their own

1617
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:56,520
fucking pattern that is randomized because there's no way
that they're gonna walk the state like they're gonna walk

similar together hey a scourge upon your bloodline for

Oh, the culture's ready?

1626
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,580
Last night I dreamt of this.

1627
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,240
Wait, what's this?

1628
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,160
Beta Intervention.

1629
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:46,260
Persuade the wretched broker to peer with whom you may trade
resources for those who know receive.

1630
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:47,400
Wait, I want this!

1631
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,360
Mostly used for unlock.

1632
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,240
Yeah, we want pickaxe.

1633
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,500
Dark of chaos.

1634
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,060
Light of me, pickaxe.

1635
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,540
Heed now my will.

1636
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,740

Oh, I got pickaxe now.

1639
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,280
Okay, and then I guess we can summon him.

1640
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:05,880
I'm ready.

1641
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:10,040
By blood and darkness, let my will be done.

1642
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:11,600
There.

1643
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:12,540

like similar costumes maybe it's because they're both

1646
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:39,080
wearing all black holdings finally purified praise the fates
speaking of which are you as yet considering an invocation

1647
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:48,160
to them i have my doubts that they would listen even now if
there's any chance the three fates shall aid us i'll take it

1648
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:57,560
thank you for preparing things for me though i'm well short
of freshly picked reagents still and offer such reagents if

1649
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:04,500
i could but as you venture past this glade look carefully
along your path aren't they related well one's a witch and

1650
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:15,440
the other one's dead i don't know yes headmistress yay why
are you selling Oh, Ash and Syke.

1651
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,880
Wait, what's Fate Fabric?

1652
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,080
What's Fate Fabric, guys?

1653
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:20,800
I still don't know what the Syke is for.

1654
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:23,340
It hasn't told me what Syke is for.

1655
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,740
What is it?

1656
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,680
Eda-C?

1657
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,280
Or has it?

1658
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,900
Eris has been spotted in the depths along your path.

1659
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,640
Intelligence you likely could have used before.

1660
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:36,880
She made your journey worse for you.

1661
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,200
Apologies, Goddess.

1662
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:39,240
Yeah, fuck her.

1663
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:40,660
Nobody likes her.

1664
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:43,260
Wait, why is she trying to stop me?

1665
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:43,780
Slow me down.

1666
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:45,580
I'm sure she knows too much about our intentions.

1667
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:47,320
What do we do?

1668
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,040
Children of Nix are supposed to be on our side.

1669
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,800
Yeah, I thought we were supposed to be really good friends
and roommates.

1670
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:54,940
Of what we've planned.

1671
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,880
Besides her boredom drives her more than anything.

1672
01:45:58,300 --> 01:45:59,580
Run into her a few more times.

1673
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,260
She'll soon grow sick of it and go away.

1674
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,080
Are you going to keep doing this to me?

1675
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,520
So deems the great tactician.

1676
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,580
Why can't we just tell her to stop?

1677
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:11,540
Somebody tell her to stop.

1678
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,820
It's like, what?

1679
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:31,700
she's a little quirky just slap her be like bad bad Ares oh
so Kronos took over Hades wait so does that mean no one can

1680
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:41,840
die now because there's no no one can die now because
there's no like afterlife we do a little bit of tomfoolery

1681
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,560
wait is there anything Did I miss anything here?

1682
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,580
Guess I'll talk to Hypnos.

1683
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:48,340
No, okay.

1684
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,540
He's just leaping.

1685
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,120
He's just eepey.

1686
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:53,780
Death to Kronos.

1687
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,460
Death to Kronos.

1688
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,760
Yeah, where do we go now?

1689
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,380
Yes and no.

1690
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:00,220
They died.

1691
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,400
They just don't stay dead.

1692
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:02,460
Oh, wait, that's good.

1693
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,780
We should, like, let Kronos still be the house of Hades.

1694
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,040
Well, we need regen.

1695
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:12,300
And then...

1696
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,000
Your new Akina card requires more graphs than you have
available.

1697
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,580
So you cannot be activated.

1698
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,280
Oh, that's what grasp is.

1699
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,260
Top right corner to increase your grasp or do.

1700
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:23,940
Oh!

1701
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,120
Do we not have enough grasp?

1702
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,260
Oh, one more grasp.

1703
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:34,320
Okay, let me...

1704
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,000
Now they turn into a ghost.

1705
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,740
Wait, then that's good.

1706
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:38,920
I get to haunt people.

1707
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,640
I'll be like, you fuck with me.

1708
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,900
I'm now going to haunt you forever.

1709
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:58,140
your rasp is psych psyche wait but i could save for your
fabric firmly grasp it all right let's see just breathe uh

1711
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:14,600
get rid of something I like the moose lower.

1712
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,380
I feel like...

1713
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:16,700
Well, I can't activate anything yet.

1714
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:18,160
I'll just do all these first.

1715
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,980
Sprint is for each night with one death defiance after
every...

1716
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:24,080
Wait, I want to save for a death defiance, actually.

1717
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:27,380
Wait, do I already have it?

1718
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,560
No, I'm too low.

1719
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,000
It's beyond my grasp.

1720
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,320
I could turn this off and put this.

1721
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,560
I feel like if I turn...

1722
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:39,440
Yeah, I'm going to turn this off and then we can have it.

1723
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:40,620
I already have regen.

1724
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,820
Regen seems a lot better.

1725
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,040
Oh,

1726
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:49,960
wait, can I...

1727
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:50,980
Do I have another weapon now?

1728
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,420
I do!

1729
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:54,140
I don't!

1730
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,880
Okay, it's the pick.

1731
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,380
Reveal to me the bounties of the earth.

1732
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:04,420
It just serves you well.

1733
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,840
Alright, nice.

1734
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,880
Do I have it equipped yet?

1735
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:21,120
i do okay i need to find these wait i can upgrade my grasp i
don't have enough i don't have enough psyche for that

1736
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:24,660
strength and wisdom of my predecessors yeah i need 40.

1737
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,600
i have 20.

1738
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:33,360
so i need to start farming psyche now yeah but i want to
save up for the faded fabric i don't know what it is but it

1739
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:40,260
sounds cool there she is again at last why it's the same
thing does he give me

1740
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:47,040
The shadowy denizen of the underworld comes with certain
perks, young one.

1741
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,620
Take, for instance, how, when you dash, nothing can touch
you.

1742
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,020
We are the unseen.

1743
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,460
At one with the darkness.

1744
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:57,060
Yeah, the infinity frames.

1745
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:57,940
I made anything, yes.

1746
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,280
But only for a moment.

1747
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:02,440
And even then, I can't prevail by dodging all night long.

1748
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,580
I'd do it out of time if I was you.

1749
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,940
See the little trail when you dash.

1750
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:10,940
Once it snaps back, you're good to go again.

1751
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,000
Oh, okay.

1752
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,200
That's interesting.

1753
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:24,840
The crossroads training grounds are watched over by fearless
seafarer, Skelemius, famed in death as he was famed in life.

1754
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:28,760
We cannot fail with such a genius on our side.

1755
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:29,240
What's this?

1756
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,240
Oh, restore my magic.

1757
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:31,680
Okay.

1758
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:35,180
Not to look at the scenery again for more lore.

1759
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,900
I'll get through all that gloom somehow.

1760
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,260
Oh, so I have to go through all of this to reach Olympus.

1761
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,200
Am I going to Olympus?

1762
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,060
I assume it's Olympus, right?

1763
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,140
So pretty.

1764
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:51,140
I wonder if this is a placeholder.

1765
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,020
Because I feel like they could definitely improve this one.

1766
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,280
Because I don't know.

1767
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:58,300
It sort of looks like a sketch.

1768
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,220
It does sort of look like a placeholder.

1769
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,620
Alright, down I'll go.

1770
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:15,400
Wait, no, you're right.

1771
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,540
No, down is up.

1772
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,380
Oh, my God.

1773
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:20,260
You two, please.

1774
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,800
Okay, the only other thing I know about Hades too is her,
Aphrodite.

1775
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:26,980
Guys, guys, calm.

1776
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,820
Guys, guys, calm down.

1777
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,280
Guys, let me...

1778
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,660
Guys, calm down.

1779
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:35,740
Calm down, everybody.

1780
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,100
Calm down, everyone.

1781
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,580
Calm down.

1782
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:42,540
Doubtless this one knows hatred, not just love.

1783
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:50,540
It's her.

1784
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:55,220
You look like you can break some hearts even without my aid.

1785
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:57,580
Oh, your brother would be so proud.

1786
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:00,580
Her eyes are up there, chat.

1787
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,580
Her eyes are up there.

1788
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:10,920
Your special deal is more damage to nearby foes.

1789
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:11,460
Your cast.

1790
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:11,940
Whoa!

1791
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:15,920
If you each encounter one foe is always weak, you gradually
restore.

1792
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:19,780
Oh, you're weak foes.

1793
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:20,640
Wait, I like that.

1794
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:21,480
Glamour game.

1795
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,600
Wait, what do you mean?

1796
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,900
What do you mean, Hades II?

1797
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,580
Why do you want to learn more from her?

1798
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,960
Okay, nice.

1799
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,400
I'm just gonna...

1800
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,320
Oh my gosh, the regen is actually so clutch.

1801
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:39,080
Not gonna lie.

1802
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,300
Looks like a new path out.

1803
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:51,160
forget the silver what does the silver look like though like
near all of the near endless pathways and suffocating arabus

1804
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:58,760
oh i see it it has like moon rocks very scarce are those who
can all rocks come from the moon i don't know if you guys

1805
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:08,420
know that to figure out silver but how much can't collect
whoa collecting moon rocks that's where rocks are born chat

1806
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:17,420
the moon like cries and then like the tears are the rocks
that come out of the moon ducks and then it falls on the

1807
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:29,520
earth today i learned is that interesting fact guys i
learned that like i learned that like in elementary school

1808
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:37,280
for my science teacher every time you see a rock just
remember it came from the moon

1809
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:45,420
astronomy with those I definitely need heals.

1810
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,520
I'm, like, 30 HP.

1811
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:48,940
No, what's this?

1812
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:51,160
No, okay, Majora's Mask.

1813
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:51,920
No, no.

1814
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:53,380
Majora's Mask is different.

1815
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:55,780
Majora's Mask, the moon is trying to kill you.

1816
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:02,520
But, like, but, like, in the real world, the moon is just
crying, because it's sad.

1817
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:05,440
It's sad, because it wants to date the earth.

1818
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,740
But the earth, like, always was like, I don't know, man.

1819
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:16,580
Like, I just see you as a real, good friend you know like i
don't know i don't think we can make it work it's just gonna

1820
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:24,540
ruin our friendship all right money or heart i feel like
more heart we don't need money sad moon that's why so then

1821
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:30,780
the moon is like the creepy stalker that wouldn't leave the
earth alone because the moon keeps following them every

1822
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:43,800
every rotation and the earth was like bro come on man Moon
chat god wait the hunt is on who the fuck is hunting me I'm

1823
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,680
here talking about my my earth slash moon fan fiction

1824
01:54:51,620 --> 01:55:02,300
Oh wait Artemis is that Artemis Artemis help me nice Artemis
is she helping me

1825
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:13,680
though yeah she's helping me nice i can continue my earth
slash moon fan fiction and then like so like and then there

1826
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:23,040
was like a mistake that they made one night we're like um
we're like the moon try to make the earth jealous by artemis

1827
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:31,520
by trying to hook up with the sun and they're like wait
let's get some life first it's been too long hello artemis

1828
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:38,620
look at you on your great hunt circumstances but you finally
she's so different know that the family has your back

1829
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:46,580
surprises they are about this no shortage lately of
surprises on olympus or below it's good to see you and your

1830
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:55,620
couple name is eclipse times against us and all that times
an old fool too busy besieging the mountain of the gods to

1831
01:55:55,620 --> 01:56:04,360
sense the threat headed his way go get him all right those
will at least may take critical damage.

1832
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,900
A random foe occasionally becomes marked.

1833
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,960
If it takes critical damage, this repeats.

1834
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:13,800
Fodes in your cast may take critical damage from your
attacks.

1835
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:15,420
Cast?

1836
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,740
Wait, wouldn't that, would lethal snare be good?

1837
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:20,800
Because I'm snaring a lot too, I feel like.

1838
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,340
Or unless we get death warrant.

1839
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:23,900
Two or three.

1840
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:28,840
If random foe occasionally becomes marked, I feel like snare
would be better.

1841
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,560
Just because I'm always snaring.

1842
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:33,480
And then it may take damage.

1843
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:34,780
Yeah, I use snare a lot.

1844
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,500
Alright, we're gonna go with snare.

1845
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:37,800
Goodbye, Artemis.

1846
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:42,600
We're gonna need Sykes so we can grab more.

1847
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:44,220
Why can't she do that all the time?

1848
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:44,900
I don't understand.

1849
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:48,560
She should be helping me all the time, because we're
sisters.

1850
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,360
Black, thank you for the super chat.

1851
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,280
Thank you, thank you.

1852
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,960
And then the Earth has to, like...

1853
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,540
Wait!

1854
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,600

1855

Wait.

1856

I don't have enough money.

01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:52,740
But we'll upgrade, I guess.

1876
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,860
No sign of Hermes yet, my lord.

01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:56,800
Forgive my impatience.

1878
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:01,280
I know infiltrating our enemy's ranks and discovering the
details of his plans to conquer Olympia.

1879
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,560
This is sensitive work.

1880
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:05,000

1883
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:19,460
The boatman, Karam, one-time steward of the dead, now skulls
the rivers of the underworld in aid of those who yet resist

1884
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,680

1885
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,480
Oh, just Kronos the Titan Lord.

1886
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,440
What would we do with that?

1887
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,720

Whoa, what?

1902
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:17,380
Appearances are everything to her.

1903
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:21,440
Whilst, as for me, I'm about hotness of a different sort.

1904
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:24,960
Who's older?

1905
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:26,040
Has she or Aphrodite?

1906
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:29,060
Wait, does that mean Aphrodite is all plastic?

1907
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:40,860

And then...

1922
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,640

Oh, no, this is magic.

1927
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:56,460
Okay, so I'd rather just...

1928

1931
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:03,040
But who cares about that?

1932
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,280
It's all about power-ups.

1933
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:07,060
Uh...

1934
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:13,180

02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:19,120
I know!

1937
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:27,380
I feel like the common enemies are easier, but by fucking
God, the bosses are so difficult now.

1938
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:41,700
I feel like level the first level and the second level
bosses were not as hard as this definitely feels like common

1939
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:54,380
enemies are easy bosses are hard they got through do you
mind your time sunshine the titan thinks he has us pinned

1940
02:02:54,380 --> 02:03:00,500
but we have the situation here under control yeah the titans
are like they might be pre-gods and goddesses but there's a

1941
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:11,240
reason why the titans are all died out all right wait lucid
wait while standing in your cast grab wait what exchange

Oh, he can touch me.

1950
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:43,040
Alright.

1951
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,660

1957
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:56,740

02:03:59,640 --> 02:03:59,880
Nope.

1961
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,600
Alright, and then cast.

1962
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:02,960
Oh, God.

1963
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:03,240
Okay.

1964
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:04,400
Just keep casting.

1965
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:05,700
Oh, my God.

1966
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,380

Okay.

1970
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:10,600
Anyway, I can keep farming this.

1971
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:13,680
Because all I do is just... I do infinite cast.

1972
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:16,280
And then I just farm it inside my cast.

1973
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:16,760
For me.

1974
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,160

02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:27,280
Nope, it's not.

2042
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:28,640
Nope, it's not.

2043
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:29,700
This guy.

2044
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:32,300
Okay.

2045
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:34,120
It's fine.

2046
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:35,500
I can just farm this here.

2047
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:37,780
Oh, nope, I cannot.

2048
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:38,960
Yes, I can.

2049
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:40,080
Nope, I cannot!

2050
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:42,260
Oh, my god.

2051
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:44,900
Guys, I made a mistake.

2052
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:53,680
Guys, I might have made just a little miscalculations.

2053
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,100
Oh, God.

2054
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:57,540
Oh, okay.

2055
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,600
I'll just keep casting right here.

2056
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:02,860
I'll just save my little safe zone.

2057
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:04,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2058
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:06,640
My little safe zone right here.

2059
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:07,740
Come on.

2060
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:10,080
Keep casting in your safe zone.

2061
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:12,480
Oh, God, please.

2062
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:14,180
No, fuck.

2063
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:21,880
Right here Come on, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2064
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:22,420
I threw!

2065
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:24,500
I touched it!

2066
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:32,950
I actually touched it!

2067
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:38,500
I touched it!

2068
02:11:38,860 --> 02:11:41,340
Three, two, one!

2069
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,300
I'm not greedy!

2070
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:47,980
I was like, I got this!

2071
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,660
Where the fuck is this child?

2072
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:51,780
I am a forsaken princess.

2073
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:58,940
I can't believe I dashed into it.

2074
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:01,180
I can't fucking believe it.

2075
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:03,180
It was literally 1 HP.

2076
02:12:03,940 --> 02:12:05,700
It was literally 1 HP.

2077
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:07,700
I can't believe it.

2078
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:09,060
I choked.

2079
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:14,440
The keen-eyed princess finds a set of tracks, suggesting
that her foe...

2080
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:16,080
I can't believe...

2081
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:19,440
I dashed into it and all I got was lore.

2082
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:22,060
Oh my god.

2083
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:38,100
I'm sure if you're going to describe look so fucking hell no
she looks so so like not their child looks so round yeah the

2084
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:46,660
art style is like I guess it's the art style as she
continues on her fateful search the art style looks like

2085
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:48,640
different from like the usual art style

2086
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:54,440
She looks like Steven Universe.

2087
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:58,070
There you are!

2088
02:12:58,510 --> 02:12:59,390

2089
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:00,430

02:13:06,190 --> 02:13:10,410
But I dare say I can escape your clutches yet!

2093

02:13:14,290 --> 02:13:15,270
Wait, she's gone!

2095
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:17,330
Where did you go?

2096
02:13:17,550 --> 02:13:18,690
You'll find her yet.

2097
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:19,670
Odysseus!

2098
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:21,590

Hekate?

2109
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:13,790
Hekate, where are you?

2110
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:14,530
Oh, they're larping.

02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:15,490
Oh, I see.

2112
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:17,830
Ye old ancient larp.

2113
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:20,330
Where did she go?

2114
02:14:20,330 --> 02:14:20,950
Oh, there she is.

2115
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:21,590

2116
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:23,210
Hello, Hekate.

2117
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:34,450
I got you Oh, she is a Titan I thought they were all dead
Except for Kronos Like, gods and goddesses killed off all

2118
02:14:34,450 --> 02:14:44,190
the Titans I've not heard your laughter before Reminded me
of your mother A much preferable sound To that of grief I

2119
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:50,070
promise not to cry again I still get sad sometimes Oh no Why
are you sad?

2120
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:56,190
Your parents are still alive We think Do not make promises
you cannot keep.

2121
02:14:56,970 --> 02:14:58,550
When tears well up, let them...

2122
02:14:58,550 --> 02:15:00,310
Why is she abs?

2123
02:15:01,990 --> 02:15:03,890
Be a witch's hard work, okay?

2124
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:06,530
She did not skip the gym.

2125
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:09,270
But you never cry, Hecatee.

2126
02:15:09,770 --> 02:15:11,790
And I wish to become strong like you.

2127
02:15:12,590 --> 02:15:16,150
So that I might find Kronos and destroy him for what he's
done.

2128
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:17,570
And then...

2129
02:15:17,570 --> 02:15:20,970
And I shall do everything in my power to prepare you.

2130
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:23,570
So that you may succeed where I fail.

2131
02:15:24,590 --> 02:15:27,590
If not, be your family's sake, then be your birthright.

2132
02:15:27,730 --> 02:15:28,870
Like a child actor?

2133
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:31,930
That's me!

2134
02:15:32,450 --> 02:15:34,990
But I thought my brother's gonna inherit the underworld.

2135
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:38,010
What do you mean you failed?

2136
02:15:38,690 --> 02:15:40,350
You tried to beat Kronos yourself.

2137
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:41,790
He hurt you?

2138
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:46,750
Concern yourself with your own pain, not mine.

2139
02:15:47,630 --> 02:15:52,030
Destroying Kronos shall not change the past, and the pain
shall linger.

2140
02:15:53,610 --> 02:16:04,490
less frequently with age but enough of this on the morrow we
shall teach you to hunt greater prey oh my god we're gonna

2141
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:17,510

death to cronos death to cronos oh wait I just I don't have

2142

an arm you're right I just noticed I'm armless let's pet the
frog yeah I don't know where Neal ready, am I?

2143
02:16:26,670 --> 02:16:28,990
Alright guys, I know this is a short, really short stream.

2144
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:31,770
But I'm going to call it here because I'm tired.

2145
02:16:36,470 --> 02:16:38,150
We're going to call it here.

2146
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:41,750
We did stream like two and a half hours today.

2147
02:16:44,210 --> 02:16:47,550
Yeah, I'm like super tired right now.

2148
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:48,730
So we're going to call it here.

2149
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:51,630
I don't want to force myself when I'm like really tired.

2150
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:57,690
But I honestly had a great time playing Hades 2.

2151
02:16:58,090 --> 02:17:00,570
I think like I'm going to play Hades 2.

2152
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:05,630
I'm going to wait until like the game gets out of early
access to keep playing.

2153
02:17:05,970 --> 02:17:08,150
Because I don't want to like spoil myself.

2154
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:11,990
I don't want to spoil myself the full experience.

2155
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:20,230
And then like, and then when the game officially comes out,
I get like, I like, you know, I get bored of it.

2156
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:23,390
So I want to like, the next time I play Hades 2.

2157
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:29,210
i'm gonna wait until it's fully released and then we'll
we'll play back to where it started i don't want to get

2158
02:17:29,210 --> 02:17:35,610
burned out on it uh yeah i don't want to get burned out of
it and like i actually sort of like want to um i want to

2159
02:17:35,610 --> 02:17:44,310
like be able to experience the full story in in the way that
the game wants me to so the next time we're playing hades 2

2160
02:17:44,310 --> 02:17:47,810
we're going to wait until the full game is out.

2161
02:17:48,530 --> 02:17:49,610
Um, but I really enjoyed it.

2162
02:17:50,370 --> 02:17:52,630
Um, I really enjoyed it so far.

2163
02:17:53,010 --> 02:18:00,530
I enjoyed the different power-ups and everything, and um, I
cannot wait to play Hades 2 when it's out of early access.

2164
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:06,130
Uh, I hope, I heard it, like, planning on getting it out of
early access by the end of the year, right?

2165
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:08,330
Or next year, I don't...

2166
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:10,010
We'll see.

2167
02:18:10,570 --> 02:18:11,490
We'll see.

2168
02:18:11,770 --> 02:18:13,450
But yes, I had a great time.

2169
02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:15,550
I'm sorry that it was a really short stream, guys.

2170
02:18:16,150 --> 02:18:23,170
Uh, but honestly I'm like really tired in general at the
moment I think it's also because like uh there was a lot of

2171
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:30,210
stuff going on behind scenes so uh I'm like mentally my
brain is just so exhausted at the moment I might take a nap

2172
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:36,750
right now after this uh after I end stream but I still hope
