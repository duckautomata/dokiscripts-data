1
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,120
Oh my god!

2
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
Hello, hello everyone!

3
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm so tired already!

4
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,400
Oh my god.

5
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:04,280
I just had to... you know like those moments when your mom comes into your room and then talks to you for like 30 minutes?

6
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,360
And I'm just like, I have a stream.

7
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,980
Please, please mom, I have a stream!

8
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,700
Please!

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,900
She came in and she's like, okay we need to talk about business.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,800
I was like, I have a stream mom, please!

11
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,220
No, I don't want to be zoned out before the stream!

12
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,060
I need to hike myself up!

13
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,820
Oh my god, sorry.

14
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,900
That's why I'm like, I'm already like mentally exhausted at the moment.

15
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,680
Yeah.

16
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm like, I'm already like mentally exhausted and zoned out.

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,160
And I'm like...

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,200
And then she left like two minutes before I had to start my stream.

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,600
So I was just like, okay, can you be awake now?

20
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,980
Oh no, I want a nap.

21
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
I want a nap!

22
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,220
I'm just like, no, no Doki!

23
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,280
You have to be awake!

24
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,260
You have to stream in two minutes!

25
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
But now I'm sleeping!

26
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,260
I'm sleepy!

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm eepy now!

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,980
I was like, no mom!

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
Why didn't you come in the room after my stream?

30
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,720
Now I'm eepy!

31
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,940
Now I'm eepy because of all the business talk!

32
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,520
Not the eepy...

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,480
Anyways, so I got some coffee in here at the moment.

34
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,800
Cause I need to wake up.

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,100
I've been like...

36
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,380
There's been like so much work going on.

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,940
Like, I don't know.

38
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,260
I think I've like conditioned myself so that every time I like have to...

39
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,020
I have like fucking work talk going in.

40
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,140
Like, I'm just like, I wanna sleep.

41
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,520
It doesn't matter if like I just woke up or anything.

42
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,000
If I just woke up and I was like, alright, I'm feeling it.

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,760
And then they're like, alright, it's time for business talk.

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,260
And then I'll be like, I wanna sleep.

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,200
I wanna sleep now.

46
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,180
I just, I conditioned myself.

47
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,960
No, this is not good!

48
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,440
It's not good that I conditioned myself to be eepy!

49
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,820
Every time it's like, important business talk, important meeting time.

50
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,380
And then I'm like, important sleep time.

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,740
There's only one way to avoid business talk.

52
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,220
It's sleeping.

53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,860
Gotta lift.

54
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,640
I got conditioned eepiness now, guys.

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,540
Anyway, another news!

56
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,400
Another news!

57
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,840
There's so many news!

58
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,900
There's so many news coming in!

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,980
But yeah, I was like, I was not eepy, but now I'm mega eepy.

60
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,340
But it's okay.

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,340
Streaming always makes me feel less eepy.

62
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
The longer I go.

63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,700
And the more I stream, the longer I stream, the more, the less eepy I get.

64
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,980
Anyway, anyway, anyway, lots of exciting, lots of exciting news coming in.

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
So, I didn't realize this until I ended stream last night.

66
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
Also, like, I went to bed really fucking late last night.

67
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,220
Cause like, Hiro and I ended up talking for like, I think like, 3 plus hours straight after we ended stream.

68
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,320
So I think I went to bed around like, 3.5 hours.

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
So I think I went to bed around like, 5 to 6 AM.

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,360
Cause we just kept yapping afterwards.

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,340
She's a great friend.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,900
Cause like, we were just like, hanging out and just talking about random stuff too.

73
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,960
And, but anyway, I found out after I ended stream, and after I finished yapping with Hiro.

74
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,640
That, it was announced that I will be at AVCon!

75
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,960
AvCon?

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,020
I don't know.

77
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,520
AVCon in Australia Adelaide!

78
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:19,420
So yes, another world tour, world tour spot, Dokie's world tour spot has been announced.

79
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,580
Another convention that I will be showing up is AVCon at Adelaide, Australia!

80
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,040
So I will be down under.

81
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:37,100
Um, and, uh, in AvCon for Australian goons, there will be meet and greets.

82
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,940
So, yes!

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,960
There will be meet and greets as well as, I think like, um, I don't know if I can announce it.

84
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,700
Cause it's not, it's not on the website itself.

85
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,760
I should have asked to be like, hey what can I say and what can I not say?

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,340
In terms of like, what will I be doing at AVCon?

87
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,020
Cause I don't think, uh, I don't think they wrote down yet.

88
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
They've announced what I will be doing at the convention.

89
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
I know what I'll be doing at the convention!

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,900
So, um...

91
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,880
Uh, so, I actually don't know yet.

92
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,200
I should, I should, I should ask first.

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,800
But, uh, the one thing I can say is the meet and greets.

94
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,340
Because like, I feel like, you know, even if I shouldn't have, if I wasn't supposed to spoil it.

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,200
It's not like, it's, uh, I mean I did quote retweet it.

96
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,980
So if they're like, oh my god you shouldn't have said it.

97
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,360
Well, I did quote retweet it and they know I quote retweet it.

98
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,280
And they didn't reprimand me for quote retweeting it.

99
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,180
So, and, and saying that it's a meet and greet.

100
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,940
So I think I'll be fine.

101
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
It's on the website though, wait is it?

102
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,560
Okay, wait let me double check.

103
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
Get involved, okay let's see.

104
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,600
Guest, let me see on the website.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,780
Does it say what I'll be doing?

106
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,660
No, it doesn't say what I'll be doing.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,760
It just says like, it just says like, this is my bio.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,640
What do you guys mean?

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,020
The website doesn't even say what I'll be doing.

110
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,860
It just says like, my biography.

111
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,320
That I co-wrote.

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
You like it?

113
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,140
I co-wrote that.

114
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,900
Guys, you guys almost baited me into saying what I'll be doing there.

115
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,740
You guys, you guys almost, almost baited me there.

116
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,020
But yes, you guys like this?

117
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,740
I wrote this.

118
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,500
Okay, to be fair, I, to be fair, the organizer wrote it and then I edited it.

119
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,240
So technically I wrote this smile.

120
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,540
At first, they included like, at first it was like, oh my gosh, let me, let me not show you guys.

121
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,060
Let me like read off the original draft.

122
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,180
Cause I was, I had to edit it cause I was like, oh no.

123
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:55,820
And they were like, it's known for playing first person shooters, drawing sessions, musical performances, and just chatting sessions.

124
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
And I was like, okay, first off.

125
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,720
Let's, let's get rid of the musical performances.

126
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:03,840
Let's get rid of the musical performances.

127
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,780
Musical performances.

128
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,720
Musical performances.

129
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,300
I was like, I was like, okay, I'm going to get rid of the musical performance part.

130
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,660
And then we changed it to like her tournament performances around the world.

131
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,820
So I like, I edited it a little bit and rewrote some stuff.

132
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:41,360
But yes, if you are going to Adelaide, Australia, if you're planning on going to Australia, you're planning on going to Adelaide.

133
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,580
I will be at AVCon.

134
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,220
And maybe you'll be lucky to get a meet and greet.

135
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,740
And for those people on like, in the different countries around the world, do not worry.

136
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,080
There's more convention announcements coming.

137
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,480
That's going to be coming out soon.

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,660
The more date weeks that pass, the more announcements are going to...

139
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,580
The more weeks that pass that's getting closer to certain conventions, the closer it gets to certain convention announcements.

140
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,840
So you do not, don't have to worry.

141
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,020
Being like, Doki, it's so far away from insert country here.

142
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,420
Do not worry.

143
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,300
There's more conventions that's going to come out soon.

144
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,400
So don't worry.

145
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
Australia is not the last.

146
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,000
Look, the Doki World Tour is not two conventions, guys.

147
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,640
The Doki World Tour is not two conventions, guys.

148
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,540
The Doki World Tour is more than two.

149
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,460
It's not three as well, guys.

150
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,820
Like, it doesn't stop at three.

151
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,220
It's not really a world tour if the tour ends at two.

152
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,380
Technically, it could be a world tour.

153
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,340
Because it's on either side of the world.

154
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,600
So like, you know, one at NA and then the other on the other side of the world.

155
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,860
So technically, it could be a...

156
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,640
You could say it's a world tour.

157
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,900
Just because there's...

158
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
It is on, like...

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,800
It's on the upper hemisphere and the lower hemisphere and then left and right.

160
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,020
The world is only two countries.

161
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,080
Canada and Australia.

162
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,280
We don't know what's in the middle yet, guys.

163
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,800
We haven't discovered what's in the middle of those two countries.

164
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,120
Another announcement.

165
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,040
Another, another, another little announcement.

166
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,100
The...

167
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,080
The SageM Slam 2 team.

168
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,820
I almost forgot.

169
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,500
Sorry.

170
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,600
2 team has been announced.

171
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,560
And apparently, I'll be on...

172
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,660
I was actually really surprised that I got on the fucking content team.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,700
I was very surprised that I got on this team.

174
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,940
I didn't think I was actually gonna get on this team.

175
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,420
But it's gonna be with Brawl Pro, Lazy Mat Man, Slime.

176
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,580
And Kony.

177
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,940
So that's gonna be my Tekken 8 team.

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,540
The Not A King main team.

179
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,160
Exactly.

180
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,120
I can't believe they put me on a team with all these disgusting King players.

181
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,680
Oh my god.

182
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,700
Like, what am I gonna do with this information?

183
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,360
How is he gonna coach me?

184
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,260
On my actual main player play?

185
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm gonna be playing as the playable character, Eddie.

186
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,220
I can't fucking believe it.

187
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,080
They want me to fail.

188
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,320
She uploads a dead Kirito on Twitter.

189
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
Look.

190
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,940
I just did it to see if I could.

191
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
Okay, guys?

192
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,960
I...

193
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
I guess.

194
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,180
I actually...

195
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,400
It was really nice.

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,860
Because I was asking about like...

197
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,480
Oh, hey guys.

198
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:03,960
Like...

199
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,100
Oh, do you guys know...

200
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Do you have any recommendations on like actual...

201
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,920
Like...

202
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,080
Like what controller they use for fighting games?

203
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,060
And...

204
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,920
Oh my gosh.

205
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,640
What were they?

206
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
It was so nice of them.

207
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,500
But the Junk Food Custom Arcades actually like reached out.

208
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,740
They reached out in DMs saying they wanted to send me a free controller.

209
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,420
Like one of their like mini-packs.

210
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,780
I think that's the Loverless mini-box for free.

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,540
I asked.

212
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,920
I was like, oh, that's so cool.

213
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,260
Can...

214
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,880
Would you think it would like arrive in time?

215
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,560
Like arrive in time before they can get some prizes?

216
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,420
Yeah, yeah, they will.

217
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,360
So like they're sending me...

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
I love free stuff.

219
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,500
You know why?

220
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,240
Because like that means money doesn't leave my bank account.

221
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,040
And I still get the item.

222
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,520
Okay.

223
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,200
Okay.

224
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,460
Okay.

225
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,360
A snack box micro.

226
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,640
Isn't that great?

227
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,060
Oh my gosh.

228
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,340
Who doesn't love free stuff?

229
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,140
Yeah.

230
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,540
Free is good.

231
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,300
Who doesn't love free stuff?

232
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,600
So yeah, they're sending me a free snack box.

233
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,720
I think that's what it's called.

234
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,020
A snack box micro.

235
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,940
And so I'm looking forward to trying it out.

236
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,520
But yeah.

237
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,140
Yeah, I feel like people are like, oh my gosh, she did the RDC, but it's not even that difficult to do.

238
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,820
Like, why?

239
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,280
Like, no, I'm actually serious.

240
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,620
Like, I don't think it was, it wasn't that difficult to like, get those buttons, like, done.

241
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,920
I just like, watched one video and because everyone was, I was like, alright.

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,600
I was just like, okay, what are the king combos of a character I wasn't gonna play?

243
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah, it's not difficult.

244
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,740
And then people were like, wow!

245
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,900
The issue is, can I do it at an actual match though?

246
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm just a natural grappler.

247
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,640
What can I say?

248
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,800
The Doki Grav.

249
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,480
The real talent is if I could do it in a real game.

250
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,180
In a real, with a real actual person.

251
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,840
But like, it literally just took me like, five minutes.

252
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,080
Cause like, they're like, okay, you press those buttons.

253
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,220
And I was like, okay, I press those buttons.

254
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,100
And I was like, oh, there it is!

255
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm, whoa!

256
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,480
There it is!

257
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,360
It's actually a fun combo though.

258
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,900
It's, I feel like that's like, the first combo, like, I actually sort of paid attention to.

259
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,360
Do you ever, I do!

260
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:50,900
I actually do!

261
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,460
I actually do remember!

262
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:58,440
It's right, down, slanted, right, and then, uh...

263
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,160
What were my controller buttons?

264
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
Y, X.

265
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,760
And then after Y, X, you press, uh...

266
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,720
You press right, down, slanted, uh...

267
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,680
Uh, fuck.

268
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,520
Okay, give me a sec.

269
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,840
No, no, no!

270
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

271
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,120
No, no, no!

272
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,820
Why?

273
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,500
No, it's...

274
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,900
It's right, down, slanted...

275
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
Right, R3.

276
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,100
Then, right, down, slanted...

277
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,540
Uh, Y, X.

278
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,780
And then, B, B, Y.

279
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,780
Bam!

280
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,360
What is slanted?

281
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,940
I almost forgot.

282
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,980
Look, slanted is...

283
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,880
What?

284
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
It is slanted!

285
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,940
It is slanted!

286
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,520
It is technically slanted!

287
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,800
I am right, it's just that I have my own words.

288
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,040
Look, all I'm saying is that before it was called diagonal, it had no...

289
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,220
People created, invented their own names, okay?

290
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,700
Look, look, let me tell you guys.

291
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,140
The difference between a pioneer and a sheep.

292
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,260
A sheep?

293
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:12,960
Well...

294
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,620
A sheep will follow what other people would say.

295
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,980
A pioneer will invent their own terms.

296
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,500
She's not wrong, though.

297
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,560
I am not a sheep.

298
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,320
I am a pioneer.

299
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,640
I... I fucking invent my own combos.

300
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
My own terminology.

301
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,140
So, I'm super excited...

302
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,040
Uh...

303
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
To play with my team.

304
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,040
I can't believe I replaced a super.

305
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,260
I thought that was really funny.

306
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,740
Because, like, my teammates were all like, Oh my god!

307
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,280
I can't believe it!

308
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,340
The boys are back!

309
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,060
And even better!

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,220
Because I replaced...

311
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,580
I'm like...

312
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,340
The fucking replacement for super.

313
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,400
And they're just like, oh my god, this is the dream team.

314
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
You had fun doing combo?

315
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,160
Congrats, Doki.

316
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,700
You're better than 90% of the FGC.

317
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,220
But then, thank you for the super chat.

318
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,100
Thank you, thank you.

319
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
I think the death cradle is so fun.

320
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,860
Because if I hit it, I don't have to do anything for like 80% of the game.

321
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,680
Like...

322
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,960
It's the best, because like...

323
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,980
Because like, then I can just spend majority of time just chilling in the cutscene.

324
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,540
And I think that's why I was really into King.

325
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:57,280
Because I realized, if I hit these grapples, if I hit these like throws, I get to do like 50% less than the rest of the player base.

326
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,240
And...

327
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,480
It's a good... I get downtime.

328
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,200
Exactly.

329
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,060
Like, in that fucking...

330
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,660
If I hit the RDC, I'll have...

331
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,280
Because like, what kind of newbie is going to learn how to break the RDC anyway?

332
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,720
Like, I don't know how the fuck to break the RDC.

333
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,080
But anyway...

334
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,580
It's a good investment learning all the...

335
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,720
Learning all the grapples and the throws now.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,120
So like, if I get anybody in the RDC, I can literally leave my controller.

337
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,960
And just go to the bathroom and then come back.

338
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,780
And they're still fucking gripped.

339
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,780
And then I...

340
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,060
And then I put them into another RDC.

341
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,740
And then I leave my PC, get water, and then KO.

342
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,480
Like, it's so easy.

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,340
It's like resetting after losing a fight in Overwatch.

344
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,900
Who's gonna learn how to break RDCs?

345
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,560
He's a girl on a team of only King mates.

346
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,560
That's... That's why...

347
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,640
This is why I...

348
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,720
This is why I picked King guys.

349
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,140
Not to plan to P-Break.

350
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,880
This is why I wanted to play King as my secondary character.

351
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,840
Because King is merely just a backup.

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
A backup for my actual main character.

353
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,840
Which I will leave as a secret for now.

354
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,640
He's only...

355
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,020
He's only the backup, guys.

356
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,920
Anyway...

357
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,080
I am...

358
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,740
Super hyped to try out Hades Tour!

359
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,600
The early access!

360
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,240
Uh...

361
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,300
So yeah, they just dropped this out of nowhere.

362
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,680
And was just like, Hey guys!

363
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:48,860
Uh...

364
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,040
You thought this was Silksong?

365
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,240
Joke's on you guys.

366
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,700
We actually completed a game.

367
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,860
Here's Hades Silksong.

368
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,860
I'm sorry.

369
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,680
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,180
That's like...

371
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,280
Silksong does not deserve that random stray hit.

372
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,360
Um...

373
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,180
Anyway...

374
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,900
They basically dropped Hades 2...

375
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,920
Out of...

376
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,200
Out of nowhere.

377
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,140
And...

378
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,900
Um...

379
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm super excited!

380
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,160
Because I very much enjoyed Hades 1!

381
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,780
So I'm very excited to try out...

382
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,080
Hades...

383
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,040
That hurts!

384
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,940
Jokey!

385
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,280
I'm very...

386
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,040
Um...

387
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,420
Very excited...

388
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,500
To try out Hades 2.

389
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,600
Just like every other streamer out there.

390
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,440
Uh...

391
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,780
Because the FOMO was hitting it real hard.

392
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,680
The fear of missing out was real hard.

393
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,720
You guys might...

394
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,720
I might be like the 876th streamer you've watched playing.

395
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:35,900
So...

396
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm going to be playing Hades 2.

397
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,980
Um...

398
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,780
And...

399
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,740
Uh...

400
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,680
And now I'm going to be at 877th streamer to watch me play...

401
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,200
Watch play Hades 2.

402
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,280
Yay!

403
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

404
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,940
There we go.

405
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,240
I heard it was really good.

406
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,280
I heard that like...

407
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,420
Uh...

408
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,900
Uh...

409
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,660
I heard like majority of the game was practically finished.

410
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,780
In terms of like...

411
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,960
The meat of it.

412
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,600
And like...

413
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
The only thing they haven't...

414
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,000
Really added yet...

415
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,500
Was the ending.

416
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,260
And like some of the visual assets.

417
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,540
Like some of the like visuals and stuff that hasn't...

418
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,920
Uh...

419
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,500
And so...

420
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah, there's apparently a lot of content.

421
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,680
It's not finished yet.

422
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,180
It's merely early access.

423
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,960
But people are telling me that the ending...

424
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,540
The ending isn't...

425
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,020
Uh...

426
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,680
Done yet.

427
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,560
And it's missing a lot of like just visual assets.

428
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,160
But like the main game itself.

429
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,380
Like there's a lot of story...

430
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
And stuff.

431
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,980
A lot of like audio and stuff is done...

432
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,620
Uh...

433
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,980
Already.

434
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,840
So yeah.

435
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,800
It's gonna be interesting.

436
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,800
It's gonna be interesting to see.

437
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,800
What's up?

438
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,320
Alright.

439
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,180
Is sound guy on?

440
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,020
Sound guy!

441
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,620
He's on!

442
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
I see you sound guy.

443
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,620
Alright.

444
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,060
Let's go.

445
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,140
Or use mouse and keyboard.

446
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,740
Welcome to Hades 2.

447
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,160
This game is in early access.

448
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,500
Which means we're actively working on it based on our plans.

449
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:57,760
Yeah.

450
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:57,920
See?

451
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,980
Early access.

452
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,540
Good luck killing time.

453
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,660
Whoa.

454
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,600
Whoa!

455
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,440
Whoa.

456
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,220
It's so loud.

457
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,360
Let me...

458
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,380
Bummmmm.

459
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,760
Meep!

460
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,140
Thank you for the 20 gift and chips!

461
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,580
Thank you!

462
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,100
Thank you!

463
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,740
Thank you!

464
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,540
How's the new PC dokey?

465
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,380
Thank you for the super chat!

466
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,760
Thank you!

467
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,240
Thank you!

468
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,100
It's like...

469
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,000
Sitting there.

470
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,220
Like...

471
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,540
You know?

472
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,540
It's...

473
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,780
It's...

474
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,220
This PC feels like he's doing okay.

475
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,520
It's...

476
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,200
There.

477
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,900
It's existing.

478
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,340
It's...

479
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,500
Like...

480
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,560
All right.

481
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,420
Let's see.

482
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,740
Maybe turn down the music.

483
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,300
Let's see.

484
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,700
Oh no!

485
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,660
Sound guy!

486
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,800
What do you think, sound guy?

487
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,580
What do you think?

488
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,580
Display.

489
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,620
V-sync.

490
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,340
Am I full screen or what am I?

491
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,500
50% brightness.

492
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,500
Interface.

493
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,060
Button labels.

494
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,540
Disable screen saver.

495
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,040
Control.

496
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,340
Address.

497
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,700
Attack.

498
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,300
Dash.

499
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,540
Dash.

500
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,040
Q.

501
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,900
Special.

502
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,800
Hex.

503
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,020
What was hex?

504
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,560
Uh...

505
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,420
What else is there?

506
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,580
Rarity.

507
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,680
Statue.

508
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,180
Book of Shadows.

509
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,800
Forget-me-not.

510
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,580
Boon info.

511
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay.

512
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,920
I feel like...

513
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,500
Okay.

514
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,300
Cast.

515
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,240
I want to...

516
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,540
Mouse and keyboard.

517
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,580
So...

518
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,640
Yeah.

519
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,480
Mouse and keyboard.

520
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,160
Oh!

521
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,360
It's hex super move.

522
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,140
Okay.

523
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,300
Hex is super move.

524
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,080
So, hex...

525
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,880
F.

526
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,620
Oh!

527
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,660
Alright.

528
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,060
I think for now...

529
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,620
God mode.

530
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,020
This is what makes you tougher.

531
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,440
More so whenever you fail.

532
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,880
Failure is the greatest...

533
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh!

534
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,500
Aim assist.

535
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,100
I love...

536
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,200
Wait.

537
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,700
Actually, no.

538
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,160
We don't need aim assist.

539
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,320
Did I...

540
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,200
Guys, did I use aim assist last time?

541
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,960
Maybe I do need aim assist.

542
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
Did I use aim assist, guys?

543
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,140
Okay.

544
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,340
Okay.

545
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,000
That's good.

546
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,440
Alright.

547
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:06,800
Let's start.

548
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,300
Empty save slot.

549
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:09,820
See?

550
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
Now you know I didn't play in advance to make myself look good.

551
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:29,920
Oh!

552
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,340
Yeah.

553
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,560
What happened to the first Hades?

554
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh!

555
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,400
It's a Kronos.

556
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,080
Who's Kronos?

557
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,920
Kronos is like time, right?

558
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,080
Dong, thank you for the super chat.

559
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,380
Thank you.

560
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,800
Thank you.

561
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,240
Your Cantonese is excellent.

562
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,020
Thank you.

563
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,360
I really appreciate that.

564
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,360
You're not like my high school friends that make fun of my Cantonese.

565
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,900
Trauma.

566
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,200
Thank you for the super chat.

567
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,680
Thank you.

568
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,240
Thank you.

569
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Whoa, Hades!

570
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,460
What happened?

571
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,280
Damn, Hades!

572
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,760
Alright.

573
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,740
I have this.

574
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,960
What's this?

575
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,540
Oh!

576
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,820
What the fuck did I use?

577
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,000
What is this?

578
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,240
Okay.

579
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,600
I have no idea what any of these buttons are.

580
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,100
E.

581
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,520
Kronos is the father of Hades?

582
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,540
Oh shit!

583
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,080
Okay.

584
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,940
Sorry.

585
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,860
It's been a while.

586
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:27,760
Okay.

587
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,740
There you go.

588
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,260
Sorry.

589
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,120
It's been a while.

590
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,520
Forgot what dodging is like.

591
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,860
I'm already going full king at the moment.

592
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,380
Where it's all full offensive.

593
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,260
No defense.

594
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,100
My favorite.

595
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,400
No one needs to do defense.

596
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,140
Wait.

597
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,240
Does this like go all the way?

598
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,240
Oh, it does!

599
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:44,880
Wait.

600
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,300
Nice.

601
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,920
Okay.

602
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:47,980
Alright.

603
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,220
I'm learning, guys.

604
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,380
Yay!

605
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,080
Boop, boop, boop.

606
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,060
Goodbye.

607
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,140
I have no idea what's going on in this story.

608
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
But that's okay.

609
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,680
Okay.

610
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,380
What does this do?

611
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,600
Do I just like snare them?

612
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,640
Oh, I snare them!

613
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,180
Okay.

614
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,260
Alright.

615
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm figuring it out.

616
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm just gonna go.

617
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,300
Wow!

618
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,580
Nice.

619
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,200
That's fine.

620
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,960
We're okay.

621
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,380
And then snare.

622
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:11,940
Okay.

623
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,780
I don't know the range.

624
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,120
I don't...

625
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,440
Wait.

626
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:17,760
Who's he?

627
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,420
Who's this guy?

628
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,470
Who's this guy?

629
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,010
Apollo!

630
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,070
Have I seen him before?

631
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,590
I don't remember anything except for Aphrodite and Poseidon.

632
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,910
And then the Snow Grandma who I hated the power-ups from.

633
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,270
Nova Strike.

634
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,530
Uh...

635
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,190
Hot.

636
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:53,830
Look.

637
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,970
The thing is they're all...

638
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,430
They're gods and goddesses.

639
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,410
They're supposed...

640
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,690
They're meant to be like the hottest thing that's out there because they're gods and goddesses.

641
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,410
Yeah.

642
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,990
They're all supposed to be hot.

643
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,070
Oh, Apollo is new.

644
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,650
Okay.

645
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:08,870
Let's see.

646
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,150
Your attacks deal more damage.

647
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,070
Your sprint is faster and inflicts daze.

648
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,390
When standing in your cast, gradually restore...

649
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,690
What is the magic required for powerful...

650
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:18,850
Wait.

651
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,190
What should I get, guys?

652
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,890
Blinding sprint.

653
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,590
Nova Strike.

654
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,110
You guys can't be like, Doki, the game came out.

655
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,170
We don't know what's good yet.

656
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:36,370
You can't say that because Hades 2 has already been grinded and analyzed and like inspected for fucking hours now.

657
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,570
Like for like days.

658
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,310
Everybody knows what's meta.

659
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,890
It's already been inspected and analyzed and theorized.

660
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,290
Let's do the audio.

661
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,350
Let's see.

662
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,790
You put music at 80, sound effects at 90.

663
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,490
Okay.

664
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,890
I'll put the music at 70 then.

665
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,270
And then we bring up the overall game.

666
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,550
And... oh.

667
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:07,690
All right.

668
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:08,930
Okay.

669
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,030
Maybe I'll turn this down too.

670
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,410
But that's ambience.

671
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:12,930
Whoops.

672
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,290
All right.

673
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,130
Let's just put...

674
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:16,770
All right.

675
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,450
And then we'll adjust the game volume.

676
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,750
Yeah.

677
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,670
All right.

678
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,010
Here we go.

679
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,370
No roller?

680
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,350
We don't need roller.

681
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,330
We got practice M and K for the tournament too.

682
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,230
Because I'm using leverless.

683
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,610
There we go.

684
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,090
Snared.

685
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,530
I don't like this weapon at all.

686
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,210
Not gonna lie.

687
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,470
I'm not gonna lie.

688
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:37,550
I'm not gonna lie.

689
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,530
I missed the...

690
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,090
I missed the gun and the bow.

691
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,110
I think gun and bow was the best.

692
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,790
Not huge fan.

693
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,010
Oh shit.

694
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,590
Where are these guys?

695
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,470
What is this story?

696
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,870
Am I not gonna find out the story until I die?

697
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,570
Just like in Hades one?

698
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,250
I think that was how it happened in Hades one.

699
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,350
I didn't find out the story until I died.

700
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,570
Wait.

701
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,090
Wait.

702
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:03,630
What's that?

703
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,790
What did I get?

704
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,550
Mostly used with inculcating.

705
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,610
Incantation involving dispelling and nullification.

706
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,610
Okay.

707
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,990
What the fuck is that?

708
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,310
Where are these items?

709
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,610
What?

710
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,090
What did I...

711
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,570
Mostly used for unlocking arcana cards.

712
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,070
Common reward for clearing encounters.

713
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,030
Okay.

714
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,590
That's interesting.

715
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,130
I have no idea what they are.

716
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,470
What is this?

717
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,490
What's more important?

718
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,610
I don't know.

719
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,530
I don't know.

720
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,690
What's more important?

721
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,390
Okay.

722
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,870
You can't say one because I haven't even given them any numbers yet.

723
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,490
That one?

724
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,230
Like...

725
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,490
Do we go with left or right?

726
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:55,790
Neither.

727
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,850
Wait.

728
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,870
What are ashes again?

729
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,330
Is that an ash?

730
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,650
Oh.

731
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:02,850
Okay.

732
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,650
Ashes are important.

733
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,890
Alright.

734
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,190
Spindles.

735
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:07,510
Spindles.

736
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,310
What are spindles?

737
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,690
Oh.

738
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,110
That's what's...

739
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,350
Oh!

740
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,010
Because they spin!

741
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,810
Oh my god!

742
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,010
It's like they named these monsters after kindergartners!

743
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:17,990
Okay.

744
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,050
This is it.

745
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,090
I love it.

746
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:20,390
Like...

747
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,390
I don't know if you guys have ever seen...

748
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,430
There was like a YouTube series where it was like they let...

749
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,930
They try to let kids...

750
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,410
Oh shit!

751
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,670
No!

752
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,650
Excuse me spindles.

753
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,650
I am trying to have a nice yapping session with my dragoons.

754
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,930
Like they're like...

755
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,530
Let a child...

756
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,510
Let a child come up with like a tea.

757
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:37,670
And they're like...

758
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,270
It's supposed to be the most dumb TV show idea.

759
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,530
And it is the most nonsensical thing ever.

760
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,030
Alright.

761
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,170
Simplicity has its best...

762
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,350
Oh!

763
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:45,630
Wait!

764
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,190
That's a...

765
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,190
Is that bone?

766
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,870
I don't remember.

767
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,890
Oh my gosh!

768
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,590
I actually don't remember it.

769
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,650
It's crazy.

770
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,090
I played this game for so long.

771
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,910
But I actually don't remember majority of this...

772
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,790
The visuals.

773
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,450
Oh!

774
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,290
That's right.

775
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,150
Do I have an ult yet?

776
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,510
Nope.

777
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,750
Oh!

778
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,850
No!

779
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,290
Guys!

780
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,910
Guys, I got distracted!

781
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,910
Guys, it doesn't count!

782
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,310
I got distracted!

783
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,090
No!

784
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,990
It doesn't count!

785
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,710
I looked at chat!

786
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,130
Guys, I looked at chat!

787
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,770
Oh my god, I can put the frogs.

788
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,270
It was ping!

789
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,050
I swear it was the ping, guys!

790
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,250
I swear!

791
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,670
It was the ping!

792
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,150
That's me.

793
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:47,830
Am I the baby?

794
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,350
It doesn't count!

795
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,710
Don't make me restart my game right now and start a new save file.

796
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,350
You know what?

797
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,530
Alright, hey guys!

798
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,250
Hey everybody!

799
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,530
So like, I don't know if you heard about Hades 2.

800
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,370
But...

801
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,850
Oh my god!

802
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,210
I can't wait to start Hades 2 with all of you!

803
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,070
I'm so excited!

804
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,430
Oh my gosh, I can't believe they dropped this early access.

805
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,490
They dropped this early access out of nowhere!

806
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,630
I'm so... this is my first time experience.

807
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,790
Whoa!

808
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,690
Where am I?

809
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,490
Is this... wait, I'm a girl now?

810
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,110
Wait, I know Kronos.

811
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,390
Kronos is like the time god, right?

812
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,550
Restore?

813
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,950
Okay, actually that was new.

814
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,550
So natural!

815
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,930
Oh my god, whoa!

816
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,670
Lost souls?

817
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,930
Okay, and then...

818
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,230
What do I... wait, do I... can I not do that?

819
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,670
Oh wait, I can read!

820
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,830
Oh wait, I mean like...

821
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,390
Oh, I don't like that key binding.

822
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,430
Give me a sec guys.

823
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,210
Wow!

824
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,690
What the heck is that key binding?

825
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,830
Let me like fix that real quick.

826
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:21,690
Let me fix that key binding real fast.

827
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,890
My first time using this new key bind.

828
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,430
Okay, I'm a YouTube gamer.

829
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,350
What do you mean?

830
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,470
I'm just giving my first time reaction.

831
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,090
To Hades 2.

832
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,250
Never played this game in the...

833
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,770
This is the first five minutes playing it.

834
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,470
We just had a 40 minutes Zaxxed On chat.

835
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,410
Wait, who is he?

836
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,150
What's this?

837
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,310
Whose god is this?

838
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,930
First impression.

839
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,160
Wait, Apollo?

840
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,860
Has he... has he been in the...

841
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,340
In the Hades one?

842
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,840
Guys?

843
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,640
Whoa!

844
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,640
Hey guys!

845
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,280
Whoa!

846
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,100
Who is that?

847
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,420
Who can be hot guy?

848
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,540
They're all gods and goddesses.

849
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,080
Of course they're hot.

850
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,120
They're all supposed to be hot.

851
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,040
Because they're a god.

852
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,820
I need my aid.

853
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,860
Let's see if I need theirs.

854
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,780
Damn.

855
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,960
I swear I saw him before.

856
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,880
Yeah, from like the streamer you watched before me.

857
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,200
Because everybody's been playing Hades 2 now.

858
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,720
So of course you've seen him before.

859
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,140
Like, I don't know what you mean.

860
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,220
Okay, let's lock him up here.

861
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,420
All right, nice.

862
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,400
Okay, we put...

863
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,540
Wait.

864
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,880
All right, we adjust the volume a little bit too.

865
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,460
We put sound effects down another 10.

866
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,460
Okay, I'll put like 62.

867
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,840
And then we put...

868
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,200
Music down another 5.

869
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,100
Okay, that means 60.

870
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,200
That means 10.

871
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,340
And then...

872
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,580
And then we'll bring up the game a little bit more.

873
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,000
All right, let me know.

874
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Okay.

875
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,160
There we go.

876
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,160
That should be good, right?

877
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,480
Oh, shit.

878
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,760
No mistakes.

879
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,500
Oh my god.

880
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,360
No hit run right here.

881
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,180
First time playing, I already got no hit run.

882
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,500
That's actually crazy.

883
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,820
I'm actually not going to die.

884
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,900
I'm actually talented at this game.

885
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,580
Wait, what's an ash?

886
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,260
All right.

887
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,460
Let's grab this real fast.

888
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,980
So close to greatness.

889
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,040
All right, sound guy.

890
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,260
Let me know if this sounds better.

891
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,280
This game is pretty easy for now.

892
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,640
I don't know.

893
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,620
I'm not really feeling this weapon though.

894
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,000
So far.

895
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,280
Oh, still no hit run.

896
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,220
Still a no hit run.

897
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,640
I don't know what your dad's talking about.

898
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,860
There we go.

899
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:04,880
Nice.

900
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,760
Oh, oh, wait.

901
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,600
No.

902
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,320
Oh, shit.

903
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,320
How could he touch me like that?

904
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,060
It's not no I'm a god.

905
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,580
This.

906
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,580
All right.

907
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,740
I just hit him from here.

908
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,760
I don't think they can hurt me.

909
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,740
Yeah.

910
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,740
Thanks for rewinding this stream.

911
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,040
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

912
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,440
Thank you.

913
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,140
Thank you.

914
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,080
What do you mean rewind?

915
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,500
Oh, shit.

916
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,360
It's rewind time.

917
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,700
Wait, what's this?

918
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:31,800
Oh, it's a super chat.

919
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,740
I actually don't know this.

920
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,140
What's the left side?

921
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,760
No hit run dead.

922
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,560
Oh, shit.

923
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,620
It's rewind time.

924
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:44,960
Left?

925
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,320
Okay.

926
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,280
I have no idea what...

927
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,520
I actually have no idea what this is.

928
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,380
Is this a fire?

929
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,840
Is this a fire god?

930
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,260
Oh, my god.

931
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,840
Spindles.

932
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,520
My first time seeing them.

933
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,200
Whatever they are.

934
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,180
Wait, can I just spam this?

935
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,920
Wait, I can.

936
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,500
Wait, I don't even have to get close to them.

937
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh, my god.

938
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,840
I just be like pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

939
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:07,980
Wait!

940
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,600
This is so broken.

941
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,600
The attacks are so slow, so I can literally just spam this.

942
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,020
Okay.

943
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,560
And then he gets close to me here.

944
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,140
Yeah, I can literally just spam this in there.

945
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,660
Okay.

946
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,620
Give me a sec.

947
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,400
Did not expect him to actually get close to me though.

948
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,380
That was like the one thing that was going to counter me.

949
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,460
Distance.

950
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:29,940
Yeah.

951
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,420
Yeah, I could literally just spam this forever.

952
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,520
It's so nice.

953
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,300
And then...

954
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,900
She stays as she dies.

955
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,460
What do you mean?

956
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,580
I made it so far for my first try.

957
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,220
Damn Doki, doing so good.

958
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,060
Not like the streamer I was just watching.

959
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,000
Thank you for the super chat.

960
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,380
Thank you.

961
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,000
I wonder who that streamer could be.

962
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,320
Was it... was it BokiDurd?

963
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,160
Hahaha!

964
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,480
Yeah, BokiDurd is pretty fucking bad at video games.

965
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,980
Oh, Hestia?

966
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,140
Wait, is this another gilf?

967
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,840
Oh my god!

968
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,180
And she's Scottish too!

969
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,360
Hahaha!

970
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,080
See?

971
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,260
There's a granny for everybody!

972
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,100
It's like, would you want a Scottish granny?

973
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,740
Or the other one?

974
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,720
Uh, she's new.

975
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,540
Yeah, she's new!

976
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,400
Alright.

977
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,780
Your cast repeatedly inflicts scorch or restore, but you have minus 20%...

978
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,460
No, what the fuck?

979
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,900
Your special launches a fiery projectile, but uses 10 magic.

980
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,940
Controlled... or...

981
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,660
I feel like scorch would be better, right?

982
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,720
One?

983
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,940
Wouldn't one be better?

984
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,480
Yeah, but then I lose 20% of re... health.

985
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,600
A change to your life limit.

986
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,080
Yeah.

987
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,180
Wouldn't it be bad?

988
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,820
Because I lose my health limit and stuff.

989
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,980
I feel like I'm gonna go with one.

990
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,040
Fire damage.

991
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,940
Wait, another scorch!

992
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,100
But then there's a boss!

993
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,580
But then I can have money!

994
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,620
Wait, is this a shop?

995
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,140
This is a shop, right?

996
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,080
How much money do I have?

997
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,540
77?

998
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,020
Alright, left or right?

999
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,400
Money or... or granny?

1000
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,040
Money or granny?

1001
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,920
Oh, I lose a chopper.

1002
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,300
Okay.

1003
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,380
Doki bird is so much better than that last streamer, Choki.

1004
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,280
Yeah.

1005
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,520
That sounds like a gamer that fucking sucks.

1006
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,380
Charon.

1007
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,360
Oh hey, there he is!

1008
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,280
Wait, I don't have money.

1009
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,900
Wait, can we actually date him now?

1010
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
If you date dev, you can never die.

1011
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,080
Pro tip.

1012
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,400
I'll just grab the plus one smoldering.

1013
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,260
Because you guys fucked me over.

1014
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,720
Oh, it's a placeholder?

1015
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,740
He just wasn't hot enough.

1016
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,260
Sorry, guys.

1017
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
They were like, wow!

1018
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,220
Okay, don't be that close to the ring guy.

1019
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,020
I figured it out.

1020
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,660
I learned.

1021
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,680
I need to make sure...

1022
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,140
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1023
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,140
I got stuck here because I couldn't dash!

1024
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,180
Oh!

1025
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,980
Okay, that was bullshit.

1026
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,820
I actually got hit by everything that was possible.

1027
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,780
That was actually crazy.

1028
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,060
Like, anything that could hit me, hit me there.

1029
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Oh my god.

1030
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,320
Just don't get close.

1031
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:45,960
Just don't get close.

1032
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Just don't get close.

1033
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,800
Just stay back here.

1034
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,040
Safe in your safe space.

1035
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,200
There's no way they could catch me now.

1036
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,220
I'm safe.

1037
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,920
Look at that.

1038
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,920
There's no way.

1039
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,280
Range them.

1040
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,480
This is it.

1041
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,520
This is the key.

1042
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,160
If I range them, they can never hit me.

1043
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,660
Wait, they're ranging me.

1044
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,740
Wait, that's illegal.

1045
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,420
Wait a minute.

1046
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,300
Why are you running away from me?!

1047
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,760
This was my strat!

1048
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,180
They're using my strat against me!

1049
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,660
What the fuck is wrong with these freaks?!

1050
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,620
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.

1051
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,180
I'm the main character!

1052
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,780
Okay.

1053
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,320
It's fine.

1054
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,800
If I spam this... If I spam right click, they'll never get me.

1055
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,420
Nice.

1056
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,960
They're better at your strat.

1057
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,760
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1058
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,720
Wait, what's this?

1059
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,140
What's the time?

1060
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,660
There's a time and then there's heart.

1061
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,720
I don't remember any of these.

1062
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,360
Is that HP?

1063
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
The god of cheese.

1064
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,820
Right side, left or right?

1065
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,220
Oh, is this coins?

1066
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,260
Oh, they're coins!

1067
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,780
They're time coins.

1068
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,040
We'll get health.

1069
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,400
They're like time coins.

1070
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,420
I see.

1071
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,000
Oh no.

1072
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:09,760
Guys.

1073
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,940
Guys, this is a bit bad.

1074
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,280
Just a little bit.

1075
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,020
Just a little bad.

1076
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,080
Alright.

1077
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,520
Just a little bit.

1078
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,420
I just gotta keep running.

1079
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,180
Okay, nice.

1080
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,900
And then they'll just go in the fire.

1081
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,820
And then I'll just be over here.

1082
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,340
They can't get me if I like...

1083
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,460
Oh, see?

1084
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,260
They can't get me.

1085
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,100
Oh my god.

1086
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,560
I almost like fucking ran into that guy.

1087
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,340
Because I assumed he was stunned.

1088
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,420
Nice.

1089
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,260
Easy.

1090
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,340
I got my heart back.

1091
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:46,980
See?

1092
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,000
Nothing to worry about.

1093
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,200
For my very first run.

1094
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,140
You guys said ash is the best, right?

1095
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,860
Ash is better than whatever the fuck this is.

1096
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,780
What is that?

1097
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,600
Psych?

1098
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,100
To activate more mostly used...

1099
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,440
Is ash the best one?

1100
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,500
To farm?

1101
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,740
That's our god of cheese.

1102
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,140
Alright, we'll do more ash.

1103
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,120
I love cheesing the game.

1104
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,360
That's what I was built for.

1105
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,660
This is why I'm totally not playing king.

1106
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,160
Alright, I think I stay back here.

1107
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,780
It'll be fine.

1108
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,360
Okay, I hate the worms though.

1109
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,160
The worms are actually really cringe.

1110
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,820
Like, I can't believe they would like run away from me.

1111
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,880
What kind of player are you?

1112
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,620
Okay, I can stun these guys before they do anything, which is good.

1113
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,620
And then I'll just burn these guys real fast.

1114
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,420
And then...

1115
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,400
Oh, I don't like that.

1116
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,380
Whoa!

1117
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,940
Stay away from me.

1118
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,300
Stay away from me, screamer.

1119
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,000
And then...

1120
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,280
Get rid of him.

1121
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,440
And it will get rid of you.

1122
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,600
Easy!

1123
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,940
They can't use my strat against me.

1124
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,340
I copyrighted and trademarked it.

1125
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,580
They gotta pay me first.

1126
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,160
Wait, what's the purple?

1127
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,620
Every time you use my strat, you gotta pay me a 5% commission fee.

1128
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,320
What's the purple?

1129
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:17,900
New.

1130
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,680
Is it a good new or a bad new?

1131
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,660
Another currency?

1132
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,020
What?

1133
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,140
Bones are a currency?

1134
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,360
Alright, who wants to give me their bones?

1135
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:28,780
Oh!

1136
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:29,780
Whoa!

1137
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,500
Whoa!

1138
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,920
They locked me in!

1139
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,480
I thought I could run around here.

1140
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,100
That's bullshit.

1141
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,540
Oh god.

1142
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:39,880
Oh!

1143
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,160
Oh, wait, I don't like this guy.

1144
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:42,880
Wait.

1145
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,760
Wait, this guy fucking sucks.

1146
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,280
Alright, nice.

1147
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,880
They actually rushed me.

1148
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,840
Actually, really don't...

1149
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,440
Oh, wait, he's stuck!

1150
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,620
He's actually stuck!

1151
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,480
Wait, use the trees against them!

1152
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,160
Okay.

1153
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,860
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1154
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:00,800
Nice.

1155
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,080
Oh, the terrain kill kills everybody!

1156
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,480
Okay, I'm learning.

1157
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:06,860
Bones.

1158
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,300
What is the bones?

1159
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,080
Common reward for clearing most used for trades for most valuable resources.

1160
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
I guess I won't find out until I die.

1161
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,960
It's gonna be hard because I don't die.

1162
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,340
Alright, let's see.

1163
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,360
The trees are actually so good for destroying stuff.

1164
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,160
Your cast snares them, by the way.

1165
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,300
Yeah, I noticed that.

1166
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,140
Yeah, the banshees fucking suck.

1167
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,780
I hate it.

1168
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:31,900
Alright.

1169
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,380
Does it sound better now, Sound Guy?

1170
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:36,980
Okay.

1171
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,720
Okay, and then I'll just use this and spam.

1172
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,980
Wait, never mind.

1173
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,980
I actually like this weapon.

1174
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,560
This weapon is pretty cool.

1175
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
I'll never have to get close to them again.

1176
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,260
I stopped looking at my screen!

1177
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,680
Okay.

1178
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,000
So, I actually stopped looking at my screen because I kept spamming.

1179
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,780
It's a very nice cheese weapon.

1180
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh, shit.

1181
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,320
Oh, no.

1182
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,380
Oh, no.

1183
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,100
Oh, thank God I snared them though.

1184
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,860
Guys, I don't think they like it!

1185
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,040
It's okay.

1186
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,720
I can do it again.

1187
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,800
Yay!

1188
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,440
Just line up for me, guys.

1189
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,980
Line up for me.

1190
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,400
Oh, it's the other Snow Granny!

1191
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,780
Oh, it's because it's ice and fire!

1192
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,220
Ice and fire!

1193
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:40,700
Ice and fire!

1194
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,380
Ice and fire!

1195
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,280
Ice and fire!

1196
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,220
Please!

1197
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,860
Ice and fire!

1198
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,700
I'll not lose her again!

1199
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,920
Wait, is her mom dead?

1200
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,640
Oh, my God!

1201
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,100
So, it's like, do you want a British Granny or a Scottish Granny?

1202
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,260
The Grandmother!

1203
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,060
Grannies of all flavours!

1204
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,120
That's your Granny!

1205
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,620
Oh, my God.

1206
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,460
Okay.

1207
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:09,980
Grandmother!

1208
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,920
Your special deals more damage.

1209
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,520
And if like freeze...

1210
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,300
Your sprint forms cycle... wait I can sprint?

1211
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,060
Hold to run at top speed.

1212
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,640
Your attack deals more damage but uses... wait...

1213
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,820
Weed killer deals more damage...

1214
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,120
Can I do freeze and fire?

1215
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,380
Wait, is it possible to do freeze and fire at the same time?

1216
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,900
Oh but then that's a rare.

1217
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,660
Wait you're right.

1218
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,940
Is weed killer... good?

1219
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,680
Uh, we'll try it I guess.

1220
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,860
Two is the best sprint.

1221
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,380
They're all good!

1222
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,020
You just had the worst fucking power ups granny!

1223
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,060
What happened?

1224
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,040
What happened to meter?

1225
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,640
One,

1226
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:09,890
okay.

1227
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,190
Ice and fire.

1228
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,450
Three is an early win!

1229
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,970
Why did you not say that?

1230
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,190
Why did you not say three is an early win early game?

1231
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,410
I would have picked that!

1232
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,460
No!

1233
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
Okay I gain max magic.

1234
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,940
Okay nice.

1235
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,940
You can never charge attacks though.

1236
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,960
Oh shit wait what?

1237
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,060
What the fuck was that?

1238
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,020
Wait I could do that?

1239
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,100
Oh my god guys!

1240
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,180
Did you guys know you can charge?

1241
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,140
Guys did you know you can charge attacks?

1242
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,100
Guys I discovered a new tech!

1243
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,540
Everybody!

1244
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,300
Live right here on stream the first person to use this new tech.

1245
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,840
No way!

1246
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,360
Hey hey hey hey hey!

1247
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,980
Hey hey hey hey!

1248
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,440
Turkey please!

1249
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,740
Hecate!

1250
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,400
Oh she's my teacher look at her abs!

1251
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,780
For all your guidance and the compliment.

1252
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,240
In my place you'd have done the same.

1253
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,940
However now is not the time for pleasantries.

1254
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,840
I'm pretty sure some of my goons here wanted to get stepped on by her.

1255
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
My capability.

1256
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,180
My capabilities?

1257
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,560
We don't have to face each other here.

1258
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,740
Even though my task has already begun.

1259
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,540
Your training shall never be complete.

1260
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,400
And I would...

1261
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,320
Oh whoops sorry I feel like she finished talking.

1262
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,280
What's going on?

1263
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,760
What's going on?

1264
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,600
Woah!

1265
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,880
Woah!

1266
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,700
What?

1267
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,480
Woah!

1268
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,540
Why?

1269
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,020
What the fuck?

1270
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,200
I don't like this.

1271
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,100
Oh I don't like this.

1272
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,320
Oh what the fuck?

1273
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,880
She's so difficult!

1274
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,660
Oh I'm so scared.

1275
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,720
I'm actually so scared.

1276
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,760
Okay.

1277
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:11,940
Oh!

1278
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,600
She's so dumb!

1279
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,800
Okay okay okay there's too many things going on in my screen.

1280
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,880
There's too many things going on in my screen.

1281
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,580
I don't like this.

1282
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,220
I don't like it when I don't know what's going on.

1283
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,340
Oh god.

1284
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,580
Oh god.

1285
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,800
That freezer?

1286
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,880
I can't tell.

1287
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:35,740
Oh!

1288
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,280
No no no no no no no no no.

1289
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,860
I can't touch!

1290
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,020
Oh shit!

1291
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:44,660
No!

1292
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:47,640
No!

1293
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,500
Why did I take the epic?

1294
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,240
Expert thank you for the super chat.

1295
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,340
Thank you thank you.

1296
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,640
Holy shit.

1297
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,360
I don't know.

1298
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,700
I think I made it pretty far for my first try.

1299
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,220
I mean I got to the boss stage.

1300
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,440
That was pretty good.

1301
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,880
Yeah that was good for a first run.

1302
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,660
Hello little frog.

1303
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:12,940
Alright.

1304
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,980
How's the sound by the way?

1305
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,060
I remember I asked that earlier for sound guide but I forgot to read the chat.

1306
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,780
This old unfinished painting.

1307
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,680
Don't look away.

1308
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,460
Don't forget all that the Titan took from you.

1309
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,830
Alright so they took my family?

1310
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,630
Wait so I'm like the sister of Hades?

1311
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,810
That's why I'm Hades too!

1312
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:45,330
Cause like his parents was like we can make a better child and then she's Hades too.

1313
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,410
Wait what?

1314
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:49,870
Oh there.

1315
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,890
Who dares disturb my eternal rest?

1316
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,950
You trifle with powers far beyond your comprehension witch.

1317
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,230
Speak!

1318
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,930
That was pretty decent right Mel?

1319
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,630
Maybe pushing it.

1320
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,030
Okay if I call you witch.

1321
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:11,570
Oh she's gonna be the- Dora's gonna be the new Medusa head that everybody wants to fuck.

1322
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,970
Which works for me in context.

1323
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,890
And I saw you haunting more than all Dora.

1324
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,230
But better than me.

1325
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,010
It's the only thing I have to do.

1326
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,450
I'm gonna be the new Medusa.

1327
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,150
Okay here you go.

1328
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:24,830
Then be gone.

1329
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,170
I miss Medusa.

1330
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,850
You guys have Dora now!

1331
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,010
Stand tall and show me your weakness.

1332
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,650
The crossroads.

1333
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:38,430
Come here.

1334
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:38,910
Hello.

1335
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,250
Time forced our hand, Melanoi.

1336
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:48,110
Nereus' soul expected you to slay our enemy last night on her new moon no less.

1337
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:49,290
But...

1338
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,730
I lack such forgiveness for my failure, had Mistress Hecate.

1339
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,130
The Titan yet lives, and Olympus yet burns, while I'm back where I started.

1340
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,130
What is it I accomplished?

1341
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,510
Oh god sorry.

1342
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,290
I meant like Zagreus.

1343
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,230
I forgot the main character's name because his name was so...

1344
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:08,770
like difficult to remember and not easy to the tongue.

1345
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:14,050
So like I kept thinking of Hades as the main- as the little kid, the little punk.

1346
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:19,270
But I still believe that Hades and his wife can be friends.

1347
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,070
And my wife was like, we're gonna have another child who's better than you and that's why it's called Hades 2.

1348
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,670
Zaggy.

1349
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,890
Zaggy my boy.

1350
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,110
We're really close friends.

1351
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,890
That's why I call him Zaggy.

1352
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:39,550
Death to Kronos?

1353
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,010
Is he the one that killed his fa- her family?

1354
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,210
Death to Kronos.

1355
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,670
Sounds like a fucking cult.

1356
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,250
What is this?

1357
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,450
He's being purified?

1358
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,190
Who are you?

1359
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:56,490
Oh!

1360
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,930
O-Odyssey!

1361
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:13,350
Oh my god!

1362
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:19,170
Is he gonna be the new- new Reaper guy that everybody wants to bang?

1363
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:19,610
As well?

1364
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,190
Already hit a wall.

1365
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,810
Knocked your scrawny ass all the way back there.

1366
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,450
Oh my god, she's gonna be the new ex-girlfriend!

1367
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:29,510
It's insane that she's sending you out on foot all on your own.

1368
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,350
Your skepticism's too much.

1369
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:33,830
Mom?

1370
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,550
There's a new ex-girlfriend that everybody wants to bang too!

1371
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,150
Wait, salute.

1372
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,030
Hail shades.

1373
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,090
Our fight is just getting started.

1374
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:48,630
Holy mo- Oh, you already ditch Hecate?

1375
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,070
That's so fast.

1376
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,250
You're not loyal.

1377
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,350
Jackals!

1378
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,710
You're not loyal!

1379
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,110
You're already willing to ditch Hecate!

1380
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,590
You're witch abs!

1381
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,990
What are you, mom number one?

1382
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,870
What about- No!

1383
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,850
Hecate was mom number one!

1384
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,390
Oh hey, she's still alive.

1385
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,810
Hypnos.

1386
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,690
No ditch?

1387
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,290
No.

1388
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,270
Addy!

1389
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,570
No.

1390
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:20,550
Zess.

1391
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:20,770
Oh yeah, you're right.

1392
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:21,630
She's gonna be the new ex-girlfriend.

1393
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,070
This is so much fun.

1394
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:22,630
Oh wait, tree?

1395
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,610
Wait, what?

1396
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,490
Why is dog a statue?

1397
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,110
Let me pet.

1398
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:44,370
Guys, to be fair, it makes sense that you're adding, because this is like- You know, the Mythos back then, the Romans and the Greeks banged everything.

1399
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,050
So it makes sense that you're adding the mythos again.

1400
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,270
There were orgies everywhere.

1401
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,270
We're just following the lore.

1402
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,110
Cat, pet, shit game.

1403
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,770
Exactly.

1404
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,290
While you channel your moves, everything moves slower.

1405
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,350
Ooh, I like that.

1406
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,410
Oh, that's what the ash is for!

1407
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,790
I see.

1408
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:19,250
Do foes, after you exit a location, restore heart or twice that you have no more than 30% deal?

1409
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,930
You know I want to deal 30%.

1410
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,050
Me when I'm actually green.

1411
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,850
Hold to run at top speed.

1412
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:32,670
Gain.

1413
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,430
Wait, I want to gain 20%.

1414
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,370
Is regen actually good?

1415
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,890
Wait, how much do I have?

1416
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,770
I don't even know.

1417
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,590
I don't know how much I have.

1418
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,010
Listen, you're attacking special dealer.

1419
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,110
Take the heal.

1420
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,050
Restore every...

1421
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,910
Ooh, restore magic every one second!

1422
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:51,890
No!

1423
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,610
Am I broke now?

1424
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,570
Do I have six?

1425
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,110
Guys, I think I'm broke now.

1426
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,550
Man, I unlocked a lot of stuff.

1427
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:04,510
That's nice.

1428
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,010
Wait, can I punch this?

1429
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,570
Have they unlocked more than one weapon yet?

1430
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,630
Like in the early access?

1431
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,010
Or like, is it only like one weapon so far?

1432
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,730
Oh wait, no!

1433
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,970
There is other weapons.

1434
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:19,010
Where are you?

1435
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,030
That's me.

1436
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,070
Oh, is that the guy beat up?

1437
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:24,870
It is!

1438
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,770
Now he's like in war armor.

1439
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:32,150
Okay, we can't unlock anything yet.

1440
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,310
Can we?

1441
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,230
We have the witch's staff.

1442
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:38,850
Silver?

1443
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:39,550
How do I unlock that?

1444
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,230
How do I get silver?

1445
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,530
It's him, the skeleton!

1446
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,830
I want to be greeted on those abs like, Jeez, Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

1447
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,930
Thank you, thank you.

1448
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,290
Which is the best one so far for you guys?

1449
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,630
What do you guys think is the best one?

1450
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,850
Oh, he has a beard?

1451
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,030
Okay.

1452
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:11,190
Wait, what?

1453
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:14,190
Okay, and then...

1454
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,690
And then press or hold?

1455
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:18,490
Oh my god!

1456
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,130
I'm running!

1457
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,670
Oh, when you hold, you can sprint!

1458
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,070
Oh!

1459
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,930
Wait, is there a cooldown to sprinting?

1460
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:29,250
Let me check.

1461
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,190
Wait, there's no cooldown when it comes to sprinting!

1462
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:33,990
Hold.

1463
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,490
And then...

1464
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,410
Special, then hold to release.

1465
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:38,950
Okay.

1466
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,170
Watch and learn!

1467
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,030
Alright.

1468
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:42,870
I did it.

1469
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,290
Oh, I just had to strike him.

1470
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,110
And then...

1471
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,710
Guys, I can't believe it.

1472
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:49,470
I could have...

1473
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,710
I could have, like, charged this up.

1474
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:56,210
Yeah!

1475
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,630
Wait, what if I kill him?

1476
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:59,450
Alright.

1477
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,050
Goodbye.

1478
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,650
That just means I'm better.

1479
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,310
Wait, is he dead forever?

1480
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,410
No, he's still alive!

1481
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:09,530
See, he's unkillable.

1482
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:09,830
Killable!

1483
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,270
That means I didn't commit war crimes.

1484
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:13,970
Wait, what's this?

1485
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,750
Do I just leave?

1486
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:31,930
Wait,

1487
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,190
did I just accidentally started the game?

1488
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,350
Oh no, it was just lore.

1489
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,330
Okay, I was gonna be like, oh that's awkward.

1490
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:48,970
That's cool.

1491
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,770
I was supposed to run a lot.

1492
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:52,830
I feel like I'm gonna get lost.

1493
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,030
Not lost, but like...

1494
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,430
I feel like I'm gonna get more confused if I just keep running.

1495
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,830
That sounds like something what I would do.

1496
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,150
I just accidentally like run into the enemy.

1497
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,750
Okay, is that everything?

1498
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,030
Is there anything else?

1499
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:10,170
I'm not sure.

1500
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:10,850
That's everything, right?

1501
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:11,270
Yeah.

1502
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,130
Alright, that's time.

1503
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,670
It's time to go out.

1504
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,190
Wait.

1505
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,750
But there's two doors.

1506
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,090
Go up?

1507
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,290
Or go out?

1508
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:19,750
Go up.

1509
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:21,990
Oh, nevermind.

1510
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:22,570
Go down!

1511
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,090
Oh, now I'm starting!

1512
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:26,790
Okay.

1513
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:30,770
Poseidon!

1514
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,630
Hey, long lost niece!

1515
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:44,310
You live!

1516
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,930
Hello, Posidon!

1517
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:47,130
We thought you were the same great as your father.

1518
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,330
And your mother, and your brother.

1519
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,010
How about we turn the tide.

1520
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:55,430
And extract terrible revenge for poor, old Hades and his kin.

1521
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:01,230
Okay, your attack hits foe with a splash that knocks other foes away.

1522
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,650
You cast Immune Deadness dealing damage and knocking foes away.

1523
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:10,170
After you strike foes with your weapon, a spirit bubble may be activated.

1524
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,750
What the fuck is a spirit bubble?

1525
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,570
There's an ill for everybody.

1526
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,930
Oh my god, isn't that great?

1527
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,450
I guess cast immediately explodes seems really nice.

1528
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,010
Right?

1529
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:34,370
Boom.

1530
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:38,410
Oh, there you go.

1531
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:40,690
Alright.

1532
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,890
I need to remember not to like...

1533
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:50,190
I need to remember not to like accidentally use up all my MP in the beginning.

1534
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,190
Okay, nice.

1535
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:52,810
Cleared.

1536
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,230
Here I go.

1537
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:56,250
One is great?

1538
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:56,710
Well then.

1539
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,450
That's great information to know.

1540
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:02,970
I wish I figured that out sooner.

1541
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,210
Alright, I'll just charge this.

1542
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,190
Wait, spamming is just better.

1543
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:10,410
For now.

1544
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:11,430
Boop.

1545
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,990
Fucking right, you can't touch me.

1546
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:15,390
Yay!

1547
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:19,350
Nice.

1548
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,170
Easy.

1549
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,390
Okay, and then... spam.

1550
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:26,290
Oh!

1551
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:26,590
Wow!

1552
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:27,770
You touched me!

1553
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:28,990
Oh shit, okay.

1554
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:29,770
I'm sorry.

1555
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,570
After I get touched... when I get hit once, I start panicking.

1556
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:34,910
Yay!

1557
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,070
Alright guys, wait.

1558
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,650
Give me a sec.

1559
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,130
Let me mute real quick.

1560
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,610
I gotta check your voicemail.

1561
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,490
Nevermind.

1562
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:09,450
Like, I was getting like spam caught like three times in a row.

1563
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,410
And then I was like, okay, there's a voicemail.

1564
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:16,470
And then I looked up the voicemail and it was like a two second voicemail.

1565
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:18,830
I was like, okay, I guess I'll never know.

1566
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:19,410
I...

1567
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:26,350
I was like, alright, I guess I'll never know.

1568
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,790
I was like, alright...

1569
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,170
Whatever.

1570
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:40,590
Sorry, misclicked three times in a row, guys.

1571
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,330
Sorry about that.

1572
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,250
Do I need to cast this?

1573
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,950
Is the casting like...

1574
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,270
Strong enough?

1575
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,630
Like, is it like...

1576
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,730
To be worth it?

1577
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,110
I don't know.

1578
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,230
I can't tell yet.

1579
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:00,110
I want my two seconds of stream back.

1580
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:06,930
Yeah, I'm back.

1581
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,870
Yeah, she did.

1582
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,630
How could she not send word?

1583
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,190
Because I'm a secret.

1584
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,750
I'm a secret child.

1585
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,070
Alright, your special deals more damage and inflict freeze.

1586
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:26,690
Guys, I was hoping I would get like the rarity...

1587
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,990
The rare special again.

1588
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,870
I take interlocation prime, a barrier that absorbs one...

1589
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,830
Wow, a whole one damage?

1590
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:35,830
Great.

1591
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,250
Wait, is this good?

1592
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:40,430
Two.

1593
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,810
I get to have like my...

1594
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:43,510
Uh...

1595
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,050
I get to regen my magic.

1596
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,290
Oh my god!

1597
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,990
Oh my god, wait, that's so fucking fast.

1598
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:49,630
Holy shit.

1599
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:51,510
Do I need bones?

1600
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:55,330
Do I need bones?

1601
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,730
Or do I need ash more?

1602
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,830
I feel like I haven't used any bones yet.

1603
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,370
Oh, one hit.

1604
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,350
Oh...

1605
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,030
One instance.

1606
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,990
Sorry, English is my first language.

1607
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:07,070
Uh...

1608
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:07,690
Hahaha.

1609
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,250
Hahaha.

1610
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:10,530
Hahaha.

1611
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,850
Okay, nice.

1612
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,330
And we can just do this for now.

1613
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:18,490
Yeah!

1614
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,250
Oh shit.

1615
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,350
Okay, that's not what I expected.

1616
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,810
Woop woop woop woop woop!

1617
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,910
That's also not what I expected.

1618
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,170
So we'll snare them here.

1619
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,730
And then...

1620
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:29,190
Boop!

1621
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:31,570
Exactly.

1622
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:32,190
There.

1623
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,450
Easiest fucking game of my life.

1624
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:36,850
Ash time!

1625
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,690
Taking the flowers!

1626
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,070
Oh wait!

1627
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,170
That upgrades my weapon!

1628
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:46,730
Okay.

1629
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,330
Nice.

1630
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,270
Oh wait, does that slow it down too?

1631
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,390
And then...

1632
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:51,970
Oh shit!

1633
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:53,810
Okay, nice.

1634
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,390
Alright, we're okay.

1635
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:56,590
It's fine!

1636
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:57,730
It's just like three damage.

1637
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:58,770
We'll be fine.

1638
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,550
And then we'll lock him in here.

1639
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,110
So he can't get...

1640
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,230
He can't touch me.

1641
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,170
Alright.

1642
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,190
Guys, we don't need...

1643
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,630
Wait, I really like the slow.

1644
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,930
Cause like...

1645
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:12,910
Now I don't have to...

1646
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,990
I can be even more lazy with my reaction time.

1647
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,650
That's like my favorite part.

1648
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:18,450
Yay!

1649
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:21,670
Alright.

1650
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:22,690
Weapon upgrade.

1651
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,910
Wait!

1652
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:26,770
Vampire!

1653
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,710
I can never die!

1654
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,890
But no longer strikes behind your...

1655
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,030
Wait, I can strike behind me?

1656
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:33,950
Wait!

1657
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,090
Vampire!

1658
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,750
I can never die then!

1659
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,390
Oh my god, everything goes for Doki.

1660
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,550
I'm so happy.

1661
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:41,650
Always.

1662
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,370
Wait, who's this?

1663
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:44,770
Hammer time.

1664
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,400
It was an accident!

1665
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,100
I'm so sorry!

1666
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,260
It was glowing!

1667
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,100
Hello?

1668
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,060
There's a spider!

1669
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:04,980
Oh!

1670
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,700
You're the new Medusa!

1671
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,080
That people wanna bang!

1672
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,900
What are you doing here?

1673
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,100
It's nothing silly.

1674
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,760
I can always make more perfectly good silk.

1675
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,460
I can always see you.

1676
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,180
It's our first time we met.

1677
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,260
Sorry about all this.

1678
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,060
I think we'll soon be seeing...

1679
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,840
Please no.

1680
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,560
Look, if people wanted to bang a snake head, people would bang a fucking spider.

1681
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:30,920
You can't judge.

1682
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:32,840
Truly.

1683
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,780
Why then I'll get out of your hair.

1684
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,500
You have to go.

1685
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,200
But first, you have to try on one of these.

1686
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,380
And don't worry about any wear and tear.

1687
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,880
I have plenty more money.

1688
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,880
What am I trying on?

1689
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,880
What is it?

1690
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,500
Don a 50 plus outfit that makes you restore 2?

1691
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,860
Don a 40 that makes you restore?

1692
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,600
Don that makes you channel?

1693
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,060
Wait!

1694
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,000
Isn't channel better?

1695
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,960
Can I get channel?

1696
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,540
It's 40% faster.

1697
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,180
Or temporary health?

1698
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,680
No?

1699
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,940
Is mana actually better?

1700
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:11,860
I don't know.

1701
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,060
2?

1702
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,220
Oh okay.

1703
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,180
The mana one is actually really good.

1704
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,100
I'll do 2 then.

1705
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,920
I'll get more mana.

1706
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,420
Oh my.

1707
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,120
This is beautiful.

1708
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:27,840
Thank you.

1709
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,400
Oh no.

1710
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:29,900
No!

1711
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,200
It's ok.

1712
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:31,800
I have a vampire.

1713
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,280
Did not grab my HP back?

1714
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,120
No!

1715
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,240
I lost a bit of my fucking armor!

1716
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,120
Alright, let's see.

1717
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,120
Well, we need max HP.

1718
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,780
Oh, I'm so sad.

1719
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm so sad.

1720
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,260
Okay.

1721
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,040
Oh god.

1722
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,780
Oh wait, I got my HP back!

1723
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,500
I did it!

1724
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,240
I got it back!

1725
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,480
Okay, nice.

1726
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,760
We're doing it.

1727
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,560
We're actually getting better.

1728
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,520
And then... I can't believe it!

1729
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,860
Doki actually improving in video games?

1730
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,880
Oh my god, the world truly is ending.

1731
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,880
Okay, nice.

1732
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,520
What even is my special?

1733
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:29,220
Wait, do I not have a special yet?

1734
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,040
I don't think I have a special.

1735
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,640
Alright, 75.

1736
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,360
Apparently I need more ash.

1737
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:37,680
Alright.

1738
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,300
Doki properly using game mechanics.

1739
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,060
What a fucking gamer.

1740
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,680
I really do like the slow though.

1741
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,340
The slow is actually so helpful.

1742
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:48,780
Whoops.

1743
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,000
Oh wait, that hits?

1744
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,840
Oh shit, wait!

1745
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,780
No wonder I could...

1746
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,500
I'm just saying, I'm just naturally talented.

1747
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,100
I can't believe it!

1748
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,940
Every attack just magically hit!

1749
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,420
That's crazy!

1750
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,840
Alright, I'm just gonna be here.

1751
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:21,720
Guys.

1752
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,200
Just be here and then slowly just hitting things up here.

1753
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:27,740
There we go.

1754
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:28,240
Nice.

1755
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,800
Oh shit!

1756
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,420
Okay, I did not expect him to fucking show up next to me.

1757
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,760
It's fine though.

1758
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:35,760
Everything's fine.

1759
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,020
Pew!

1760
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,000
Pew!

1761
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,920
Just sending an orb of death over.

1762
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:41,900
Yay!

1763
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,740
Is that it?

1764
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,240
Just slowly sending an orb of death.

1765
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,720
Just don't touch me.

1766
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,160
Yay!

1767
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:52,500
Yay!

1768
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,400
It's okay, I can recharge.

1769
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,280
Yay!

1770
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,180
Nice.

1771
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,140
Use this game on my fucking life.

1772
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,540
What's this?

1773
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,280
Wait, what?

1774
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,920
I don't know.

1775
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,100
I actually don't know what that was.

1776
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:11,880
Oh, what was that?

1777
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1778
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:12,840
Nope.

1779
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,320
Nope.

1780
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,060
Oh, okay.

1781
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,260
I thought that would get closer.

1782
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,240
Not gonna lie.

1783
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,160
Okay, then we'll kill him with this.

1784
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,360
It's okay.

1785
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,060
It slowed.

1786
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,320
Now kill him with this.

1787
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,200
And then this.

1788
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,840
And then that should be the last guy.

1789
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,080
Yay!

1790
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,420
That was not the last guy.

1791
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,820
Not yay.

1792
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,420
Fine.

1793
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,860
I have mana regen.

1794
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,320
Alright.

1795
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:39,880
Oh god.

1796
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,680
Almost got hit by that.

1797
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,140
Okay.

1798
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,440
Whoa!

1799
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,120
Whoa!

1800
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,280
Fucking fight me like a fucking four-legged beta.

1801
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:54,920
Alright.

1802
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,060
That should hit them.

1803
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:56,300
Oh!

1804
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:56,800
No!

1805
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,660
My honor!

1806
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,680
Oh, I'm ready for HP.

1807
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:01,300
That's fine.

1808
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,480
It's okay.

1809
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,340
I already got my HP back.

1810
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,260
But not even Athena knows what.

1811
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,520
His assaults on Olympus always fail.

1812
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,320
Even if they've kept us occupied.

1813
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,220
What's his next move?

1814
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,480
What is his next move?

1815
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:17,400
Alright.

1816
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,580
Your attack deals more damage in larger area.

1817
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,660
Your sprint is faster and flicks days on nearby foes.

1818
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:23,540
Okay.

1819
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,260
This would be helpful if I actually used my sprint.

1820
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,860
After you take damage, your foe takes damage and you flick days on...

1821
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:30,320
Wait!

1822
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,160
Wouldn't lights might be good too?

1823
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:35,840
One?

1824
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,100
Your attack deals more damage?

1825
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:37,520
Okay.

1826
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:37,960
We'll do one.

1827
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,800
I see more ones in chat.

1828
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,120
Oh, Ashe time!

1829
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:43,880
Okay.

1830
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,100
I can get to the witch again.

1831
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:45,660
You know what?

1832
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,340
I bet you I'm gonna beat the witch right here.

1833
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:49,540
Whoa.

1834
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:50,580
Okay.

1835
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,780
I'm gonna put this out.

1836
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,260
So...

1837
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:53,780
I'm gonna put this out.

1838
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,820
If I keep using this, they'll never get close to me to hit me.

1839
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,040
See?

1840
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:58,740
Oh my god.

1841
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,800
I'm so fucking smart.

1842
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:00,800
And now I'll just regen.

1843
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:02,780
And I'll just do this again.

1844
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,120
Oh, wait.

1845
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,620
What do you mean you can't?

1846
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,180
You can or you won't.

1847
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:10,680
Alright.

1848
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:11,120
Nice.

1849
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:11,740
Alright.

1850
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,380
Can't touch me.

1851
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:15,820
Yay!

1852
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,880
I don't need to use charge normal if I can just kill them.

1853
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:20,700
See?

1854
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,240
I recharge.

1855
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,760
Why would I need to use charge...

1856
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,980
When I can just use charge normal when I can just do this all the time?

1857
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,760
Yay!

1858
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,240
Okay.

1859
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,880
Guys, I think I cannot just do this all the time.

1860
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,560
I'm sorry!

1861
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:47,680
Guys, I think I figured out that this game will not let me use charge all the time.

1862
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,960
I can't believe it.

1863
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,680
Getting punished?

1864
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,480
Say it ain't so!

1865
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,640
What was this?

1866
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,540
It's upgrade, right?

1867
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,400
Should I get health or upgrades, chat?

1868
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,300
Spam magic bead, like...

1869
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,340
What would be better?

1870
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:08,960
Upgrade?

1871
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,160
Alright.

1872
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,000
Upgrade.

1873
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:13,920
Yay!

1874
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,120
Not yay!

1875
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:17,760
Not yay!

1876
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,040
Okay.

1877
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:21,800
Yay!

1878
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,520
It was in fact not yay.

1879
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,560
Maybe I can just stay up here.

1880
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,120
Okay.

1881
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,620
So then she won't touch me here.

1882
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:32,660
See?

1883
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,500
I can cast.

1884
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,160
Normally.

1885
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,280
I don't abuse my power ups.

1886
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,220
Noverstrike, Geyser ring.

1887
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,240
Wait!

1888
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,660
That's so good!

1889
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,020
Okay.

1890
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,080
But that's 25, 35.

1891
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:47,500
Wait.

1892
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,860
Should I get Geyser ring?

1893
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,600
I feel like Geyser... or attack.

1894
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,260
Yeah.

1895
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,020
I feel like I'm using Geyser ring so much.

1896
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:54,560
Yeah.

1897
01:15:58,660 --> 01:15:59,140
Shop.

1898
01:15:59,380 --> 01:15:59,880
Do I have money?

1899
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,440
I have 182.

1900
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,720
I still don't know what that is though.

1901
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:06,140
Alright.

1902
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,940
Shop or whatever the fuck that is.

1903
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,160
I still have no idea.

1904
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,060
Shop?

1905
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,260
Alright.

1906
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:16,800
Shop time.

1907
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,580
I have enough for actual stuff now.

1908
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,220
Hello!

1909
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:23,660
Ooh!

1910
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:24,340
Poseidon.

1911
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:29,810
Poseidon.

1912
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,190
Poseidon.

1913
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:30,790
Poseidon.

1914
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:33,210
Poseidon.

1915
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,450
I mean he was already sort of a smuggler.

1916
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:39,210
I mean he was already sort of a smuggler.

1917
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:39,430
I'll buy you a first place.

1918
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:45,710
Your special hits pose with splash that knocks other foes away.

1919
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,870
After you enter location Prime 30 to reduce any damage you would take.

1920
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:55,550
Whenever you claim a minor fine or similar research a copy may appear.

1921
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,190
I feel like all these are terrible.

1922
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,070
Maybe one?

1923
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:06,550
I think that two and three seems fucking terrible.

1924
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,730
Terrible.

1925
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:13,170
God, you're so hot when you're just a placeholder.

1926
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,410
Good talk, Chiron.

1927
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,070
Alright, Hecate time.

1928
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,210
Hecate time.

1929
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,010
I'm back!

1930
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:39,710
It's seasonably cold.

1931
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,670
Or perhaps it is as Demeter desires.

1932
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,070
She aids you, does she not?

1933
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,370
She does.

1934
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:51,150
I mean, all the gods and goddesses are helping me.

1935
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,950
Have you had opportunity to speak with her about me and all that's transpired?

1936
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:58,390
No.

1937
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:00,350
I've been a bit preoccupied.

1938
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:08,190
At least here, Demeter shall be able to cool her wrath against me for keeping you a secret for so long.

1939
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:11,170
Alright.

1940
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,160
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1941
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:17,900
It's okay.

1942
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,600
There's nothing she can do to me, cause I have...

1943
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,140
Oh, I missed.

1944
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:28,420
There's nothing she can do to me for real, cause I didn't miss!

1945
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:29,640
This time!

1946
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,220
Nice magic.

1947
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,440
Magic time.

1948
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,060
Oh, shit.

1949
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,560
Magic time.

1950
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,260
Oh, shit.

1951
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:36,640
Okay.

1952
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,220
Magic time.

1953
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:39,860
Oh, fuck!

1954
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:40,540
Okay, it's okay.

1955
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:40,960
I have armor.

1956
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:42,560
Nice.

1957
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:43,960
And then...

1958
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:44,900
Magic.

1959
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:46,580
Magic.

1960
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,820
And I'll just keep spamming that and then now I...

1961
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,340
Oh, it's her!

1962
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,240
Because she's talking!

1963
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:52,840
Oh, shit.

1964
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,160
Not my armor.

1965
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,620
Not my armor.

1966
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,260
Oh, this is not good.

1967
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,920
I lost my armor cause I was fucking around too much.

1968
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:01,880
Nice.

1969
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:03,940
And then slow.

1970
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,160
And I'll just keep spamming that here.

1971
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:09,600
Okay.

1972
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,000
Nice.

1973
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,840
Wait, she has armor.

1974
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,060
That's not fair.

1975
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,640
Where's my armor?

1976
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,660
I'm a witch too, aren't I?

1977
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1978
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:21,740
Okay.

1979
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,540
And then...

1980
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,820
Oh, this is Touhou.

1981
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,620
I don't like this.

1982
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I hate Touhou.

1983
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,320
I hate...

1984
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,260
Okay.

1985
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,920
I'm not good at Touhou, please!

1986
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,960
Why is the first boss Touhou?

1987
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,060
It's not fair!

1988
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,320
Oh, I ran out of mana.

1989
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,560
Oh, God.

1990
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:41,680
Oh!

1991
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:42,580
Okay.

1992
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,020
We're fine.

1993
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,820
I have the reaction time.

1994
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,260
It's fine.

1995
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,260
We're halfway there.

1996
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:50,740
Nice.

1997
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,740
Just gonna draw back.

1998
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,020
And then go!

1999
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:57,680
Alright.

2000
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,220
It's okay.

2001
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:58,540
It's okay.

2002
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,020
We're making good progress.

2003
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,140
The moment she talks, I know it's the...

2004
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, fuck!

2005
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:03,320
This is Touhou!

2006
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,540
This is the real one!

2007
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:05,620
I got the real Hecate!

2008
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:06,980
Let's see you with age.

2009
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:07,320
Yes!

2010
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,060
Whoa!

2011
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:08,840
Evaded.

2012
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,260
I don't know, girl!

2013
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,340
I evaded it!

2014
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,020
Okay.

2015
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:15,980
I can just do this.

2016
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,860
I can just spam this.

2017
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,600
There you go.

2018
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,640
What's she gonna do?

2019
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,020
Hit back?

2020
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,240
I can literally just spam this.

2021
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,200
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2022
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,380
That's right!

2023
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,080
Can't touch me now!

2024
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,360
Oh, whoa, wait, wait, wait!

2025
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:34,620
What's that?

2026
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,060
No!

2027
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,400
The sheep!

2028
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:38,200
Okay.

2029
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,600
I'm a sheep now.

2030
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:40,540
Alright.

2031
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,600
That was a little fucking bullshit.

2032
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,400
Not gonna lie.

2033
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,360
I can't even run as a sheep.

2034
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:46,880
Hello?

2035
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,340
No!

2036
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:47,680
No!

2037
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,560
That's not fair!

2038
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:51,720
Okay.

2039
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,460
We're okay.

2040
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:53,980
Wait!

2041
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,380
If I lose my armor, I don't get my recharge of mana?

2042
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:00,740
Why did nobody tell me instead of making me read?

2043
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:02,220
.

2044
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,880
People could have told me this!

2045
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,980
If I knew, I wouldn't have fucked around!

2046
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:25,020
You guys knew that!

2047
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,920
I wouldn't have fucked around!

2048
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,180
With my armor!

2049
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,260
Okay.

2050
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,660
Now I know though.

2051
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,300
Now I know.

2052
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,620
Oh, shit.

2053
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,140
Oh, shit.

2054
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:45,340
Which one is it though?

2055
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,260
It's her.

2056
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,300
It's her.

2057
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,220
Alright.

2058
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,460
That's all I'm seeing.

2059
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:55,000
If I knew this earlier, I would have...

2060
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,580
I definitely would have not messed about.

2061
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,260
Turkey Cathering.

2062
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,000
Yay!

2063
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,600
I did it!

2064
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,100
Yeah!

2065
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,500
What about me?

2066
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,300
Continue now your task.

2067
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,740
I shall await your safe return.

2068
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,420
Wait, I did it!

2069
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:32,380
I told you guys!

2070
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,940
My second run and I already defeated Hecate!

2071
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:35,960
I passed the test.

2072
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,060
I did it!

2073
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,240
Yoki, you stand still.

2074
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,080
You can still regen.

2075
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,240
Yeah, but that requires me to stand still.

2076
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,720
There's a problem there already!

2077
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:51,580
.

2078
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:54,980
.

2079
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:55,120
Okay.

2080
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,120
Nice.

2081
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,820
First try.

2082
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,960
Does this regen my heals?

2083
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,660
Oh, nice.

2084
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,760
I got my heals back.

2085
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,340
Yay!

2086
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,080
Why won't you and your abs join me?

2087
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:13,960
What's this?

2088
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,420
The Rim of Oceanus?

2089
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,740
This is like an ocean.

2090
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:20,460
Hello?

2091
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,560
Who are you?

2092
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,000
You're a long way from the Crossroads, Charlie.

2093
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,640
Strife Incarnate.

2094
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,820
So, this is where the real action is, huh?

2095
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,180
The game?

2096
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:28,960
The RTS?

2097
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:29,880
Or should I still be practicing?

2098
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,400
Things took a turn, Eris.

2099
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,520
You know how it goes.

2100
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,740
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some urgent business to attend to.

2101
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:38,280
What's that gun?

2102
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,400
They had guns back then?

2103
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,080
Always in such a rush.

2104
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,860
I'd really hate to slow you down.

2105
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,640
Though, let's hang out sometime, okay?

2106
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,840
Have a great night.

2107
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,420
Oh, one last thing.

2108
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,260
What'd she do to me?

2109
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,220
Blessed by strife?

2110
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,020
Yeah, what did she do to me?

2111
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,400
Uh...

2112
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:02,940
What did she do?

2113
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,040
Wait, it didn't even say what she did.

2114
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:05,800
Wait.

2115
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:06,780
Wait a minute.

2116
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Oh my god!

2117
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:08,580
Okay.

2118
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,940
I still don't know what she did!

2119
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,960
She debuffed me?

2120
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,180
How do I check?

2121
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,340
Wait, how do I check the debuff?

2122
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,220
Oh my god, they're so strong.

2123
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,660
This is actually not fair.

2124
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,440
Press B?

2125
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,400
Whoa!

2126
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,280
Guys!

2127
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,480
Wait, what the fuck?

2128
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,580
Don't even press B!

2129
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,100
B actually does not...

2130
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:48,680
Guys, if you guys did not know, B does not pause the game.

2131
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,560
Oh my fucking god.

2132
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,220
I lost so much HP!

2133
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,440
Because I fucking pressed B!

2134
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,180
Holy shit.

2135
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,360
Fuck you guys.

2136
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,200
I can't believe it.

2137
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,960
That's my fucking stream, right?

2138
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,040
Okay.

2139
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:17,920
Alright.

2140
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,660
Your phone deals 20% damage.

2141
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:22,640
Okay.

2142
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:23,640
Alright.

2143
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,400
That's fucked up.

2144
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,520
But okay.

2145
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,360
It wasn't me.

2146
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,840
Yeah, totally wasn't you.

2147
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,420
I can't believe it.

2148
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,380
I can't believe you guys fucked me up like this.

2149
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,620
Alright, streamer.

2150
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,100
Of course I was gonna press B!

2151
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,680
I literally heard, press B!

2152
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,400
And I was like, oh, B?

2153
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,500
I wonder what B does!

2154
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:57,580
If you tell me to press B, of course I'm gonna press it!

2155
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,620
Like, it's just simple!

2156
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,900
Simple button pressing!

2157
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:07,060
Streamer sees press B, she presses.

2158
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,040
No one told... said it was a...

2159
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,040
It's cause I looked at it, it should be a pause!

2160
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,180
But it should be!

2161
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,480
That's why I don't understand why it was a pause.

2162
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:20,940
I could not!

2163
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,520
Okay, there we go.

2164
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:24,420
I'll just spam this.

2165
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,040
Yay!

2166
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,000
Oh my god, they're so strong!

2167
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,160
Oh, this is not good.

2168
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,280
Yeah, alright, we're gonna...

2169
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,780
We're gonna make sure they don't touch me.

2170
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,580
By shooting them here.

2171
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,160
Oh, this is good.

2172
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,600
My attacks are really strong right now.

2173
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,000
I'll put this here so they don't, like, touch me.

2174
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,000
They don't get close enough to touch me.

2175
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:49,140
Okay.

2176
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,080
Nice.

2177
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,660
And then we'll get that out of the way.

2178
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,020
Woo!

2179
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,540
Alright, we're good.

2180
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:57,800
Yay, money!

2181
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,080
For me!

2182
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,660
I love money!

2183
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,920
I love money!

2184
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,220
They're so strong though.

2185
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,920
Uh... I have enough for shop.

2186
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,160
Personal space deployed.

2187
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:12,900
My five meters.

2188
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,200
Wait, what's this?

2189
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,520
Oh, that's the shield!

2190
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:18,960
Do I have enough?

2191
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,320
Wait, I think I have enough.

2192
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
I have enough to buy a shield.

2193
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,620
Your sprint forms a cyclone.

2194
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,560
You enter a location.

2195
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,460
Prime a barrier that absorbs one.

2196
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,920
Wait, there it is!

2197
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,620
There's the weed killer!

2198
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,700
You guys said the weed killer is really good, right?

2199
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,200
Yeah.

2200
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,170
Bum, bum.

2201
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,370
Sprint or weed killer, guys.

2202
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:51,030
But this one's not epic.

2203
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:52,770
Oh, so the...

2204
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:53,570
Oh!

2205
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:57,030
And do I do one?

2206
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:01,960
It's better when it's rare?

2207
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,560
Okay, I'll do the sprint then.

2208
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,160
And we'll see.

2209
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:05,780
What the...

2210
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,560
Wait, would this armor be my mana regen armor?

2211
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,620
Is this gonna be my mana regen armor, guys?

2212
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:16,000
Or like, is it like a different armor?

2213
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:16,820
No?

2214
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:18,780
No!

2215
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,820
Why didn't she make me better?

2216
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:21,260
Better armor!

2217
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,720
Oh, we'll just buy power up then.

2218
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,200
Just extra health.

2219
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,500
Alright, we'll just buy power up.

2220
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,020
Nova Strike.

2221
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:28,600
Alright.

2222
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:29,260
Whoa!

2223
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,780
Wait, that's pretty fucking cool.

2224
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:33,880
How do I get to the other side?

2225
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,700
Oh, I dash.

2226
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,060
Sorry, I forgot about like basic stuff.

2227
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:42,440
I don't want to fight a boss, so I'm gonna go to Poseidon.

2228
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,560
I'm doing the bare minimum.

2229
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:48,800
Oh, shit!

2230
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,780
Alright, and then cast!

2231
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:54,820
Whoa!

2232
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,400
Get away from me!

2233
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,120
No touchy!

2234
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:59,740
No touchy!

2235
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,000
Alright, nice.

2236
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,180
And then...

2237
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,080
I want to be max HP, so I'm gonna max this out.

2238
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,080
Oh, wait, they're stuck!

2239
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,640
Wait, what?

2240
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:09,740
I didn't get max HP.

2241
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:11,720
How could that be?

2242
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,780
Where's my...

2243
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:13,960
Oh!

2244
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:14,380
Whoa!

2245
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2246
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:15,960
No!

2247
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,100
No touchy!

2248
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,080
No touchy, guys!

2249
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,140
No touchy, guys!

2250
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:21,820
No touchy, guys!

2251
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:23,540
Wait, where's my vampire?

2252
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:25,600
Oh, God.

2253
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,540
Oh, my God!

2254
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,380
Oh, gosh!

2255
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,100
Oh, no touch!

2256
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,360
No touch!

2257
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:35,060
Oh, my God!

2258
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:35,540
What?

2259
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,100
No!

2260
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,760
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2261
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,450
Okay.

2262
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:41,230
It's fine.

2263
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:41,630
It's fine.

2264
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:44,710
Oh, this is not fine.

2265
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:45,490
This is not fine.

2266
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:46,810
This is not fine.

2267
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,790
Only on charge attacks and only on kills?

2268
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:51,310
Okay.

2269
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:52,310
That's...

2270
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:53,670
That is also fine.

2271
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,730
So I'm just gonna make it so...

2272
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:56,810
Okay.

2273
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:58,450
I need to...

2274
01:29:58,450 --> 01:30:01,030
I need to make sure I don't get hit by that.

2275
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,090
All right.

2276
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:03,450
There.

2277
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:05,450
There's no way he can hit me from back here.

2278
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:07,190
I'll just recharge my mana.

2279
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:09,150
Hello, guys.

2280
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,730
Hello.

2281
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:11,210
Fancy seeing you all here.

2282
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:12,850
And then charge.

2283
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,870
And then I'll just be here.

2284
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:17,770
Okay.

2285
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,730
And then I'll just wait until I charge that up.

2286
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:22,290
And I'll wait until I charge that up.

2287
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,410
And I should get my HP.

2288
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:25,370
Wait.

2289
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:26,750
It didn't give me the HP.

2290
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,650
It's what normal cast doesn't work on special.

2291
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:31,530
Oh.

2292
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:32,990
Guys.

2293
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,130
I learned.

2294
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,350
I finally read the right one.

2295
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:45,710
It only took me a bit, but I read the right one.

2296
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:48,410
The left click.

2297
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:49,310
It's left clicks.

2298
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:52,290
All right.

2299
01:30:52,490 --> 01:31:01,590
After you enter a location, prime, where you claim a minor fine, a similar resource or code, your splash effects from Poseidon also inflict slips on foe.

2300
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:06,770
Oh, they can knock further away after you enter a location.

2301
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:08,130
Two?

2302
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,350
Double up?

2303
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:11,670
Okay.

2304
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:12,210
We'll go with two.

2305
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,010
Ash time.

2306
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:18,330
Okay.

2307
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:19,290
We're going to go with two.

2308
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,410
Shelf act.

2309
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:21,390
Shell backs?

2310
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:23,030
Why bad?

2311
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:27,030
I can just spam this and then.

2312
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,070
Yay.

2313
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,690
Oh, it's because they're in the shell.

2314
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:34,610
That's why bad.

2315
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,530
Yeah, but I can do this.

2316
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:40,230
I mean, I can just do this.

2317
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:41,790
I hold HP now, so I don't care.

2318
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:42,850
Yay!

2319
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:45,790
So easy.

2320
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,870
Easiest fucking game of my life.

2321
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:49,270
Oh.

2322
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,390
Yeah, you can't fucking touch me!

2323
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:53,270
Okay, wait.

2324
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,530
Okay, give me a sec.

2325
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:55,890
I just realized that...

2326
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:57,230
I have no- Oh!

2327
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,090
No no no no no!

2328
01:31:58,150 --> 01:31:58,610
You touched me!

2329
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:00,350
Okay, nope.

2330
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:00,970
This is bad.

2331
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:01,790
I need mana.

2332
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:03,790
Guys, give me a sec.

2333
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:05,370
Please don't hit me.

2334
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:06,790
I'm just gonna get some mana real quick.

2335
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:08,190
Just be a bit.

2336
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:08,950
Alright, nice.

2337
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:11,430
Alright, nice.

2338
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:13,270
I got- Wait, what?

2339
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:13,950
He blocked me!

2340
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:16,990
It's like going into the shell actually blocks damage!

2341
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:17,710
No!

2342
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:18,910
No!

2343
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:19,930
I'm fucking around!

2344
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,750
Okay, I'm not fucking around anymore.

2345
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:25,150
No more- No more fucking around.

2346
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:30,550
Alright guys, I can't fuck around anymore.

2347
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,950
I took too much damage.

2348
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:37,550
Alright, we're gonna stay here.

2349
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:38,950
In this chill.

2350
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:40,970
We're just gonna chill back here.

2351
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:44,190
She jinxed herself.

2352
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:46,950
I realize...

2353
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:49,810
I realize it's not fun in games anymore.

2354
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:52,050
They hit me.

2355
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,030
Yay!

2356
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,670
Oh, ash.

2357
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:58,770
It's right there.

2358
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:00,550
Couldn't find it earlier.

2359
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:01,990
I feel like I don't need coins.

2360
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,710
I build up enough like coins...

2361
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:06,170
from this.

2362
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:06,710
Oh!

2363
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:10,010
Okay, nice.

2364
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:12,390
Alright, we broke this.

2365
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:13,910
So I'm gonna do this here.

2366
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:15,010
And then...

2367
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:15,350
Nope.

2368
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:17,110
And then that should...

2369
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,610
give me my HP back.

2370
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:19,810
Is that it?

2371
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,330
Where are they?

2372
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:23,570
Oh!

2373
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:24,450
He's lost!

2374
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:26,370
All his friends are dead!

2375
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:28,030
Wait, he still has a friend!

2376
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,370
He's not technically lost!

2377
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,310
Okay.

2378
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,410
I really like the...

2379
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:34,850
I really like the snare.

2380
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:36,590
It's actually so convenient.

2381
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:38,950
Yay!

2382
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:40,330
Full HP!

2383
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,030
Okay.

2384
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:44,390
Get away from me.

2385
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:45,590
Get away from me.

2386
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:47,030
Get away from me.

2387
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,490
Okay.

2388
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,070
Wait, wait!

2389
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:48,790
How does that hit me?

2390
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:49,810
Oh!

2391
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:50,110
Oh!

2392
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:50,410
Oh!

2393
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:50,970
It's the arrows!

2394
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,470
It's always the fucking arrows!

2395
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:54,850
Oh!

2396
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:55,230
Okay.

2397
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,510
I got hit by the arrows accidentally.

2398
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,210
What the fuck?

2399
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,030
What?

2400
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,750
How did I lose so much?

2401
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:06,770
What hit me?

2402
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:07,270
Okay.

2403
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,610
Actually, what hit me?

2404
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:09,750
Oh, God.

2405
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:10,210
Oh, God.

2406
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:13,470
Oh, God.

2407
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:15,290
I don't even know what hit me!

2408
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,650
Uh...

2409
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:20,270
Your special hits a force with splash that knocks.

2410
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:23,530
The attack deals more damage in a larger area.

2411
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,490
Uh...

2412
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:26,770
Those three orbs?

2413
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:27,550
There were orbs?

2414
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,210
I couldn't even see it!

2415
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,640
Oh, it's a debuff!

2416
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:35,680
I forgot!

2417
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,300
Every time I get hit...

2418
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:37,900
Fucking arrows!

2419
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:38,600
No more...

2420
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,020
There's a reason why nobody invites you to anything.

2421
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,200
No one likes you!

2422
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:43,520
Okay.

2423
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:45,400
After we...

2424
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,220
Okay, we'll do that.

2425
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,260
Oh, hey!

2426
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:48,740
Double up!

2427
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,080
Wait, that is so good!

2428
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,420
Uh...

2429
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,960
We can add more damage?

2430
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,840
Wait, we got another one!

2431
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,440
We're so lucky!

2432
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:05,560
Um...

2433
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,360
Again?

2434
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,720
Gotcha paid off!

2435
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,100
Yay!

2436
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:11,680
Gambling!

2437
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:12,500
Hahaha!

2438
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:14,740
Hahaha!

2439
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,600
Um...

2440
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:17,460
Okay.

2441
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:17,580
Uh...

2442
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,360
One?

2443
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:20,860
Three?

2444
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,280
Uh...

2445
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,440
Oh my gosh!

2446
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,120
I don't know!

2447
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,340
They all look so good!

2448
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:27,360
Two?

2449
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,120
Nova strikes for me.

2450
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:30,500
Two.

2451
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:30,820
Okay.

2452
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:31,600
We'll go with two.

2453
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:32,660
Alright.

2454
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,420
We'll go with two.

2455
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,060
Okay.

2456
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,040
We're gonna...

2457
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:37,520
Ash time!

2458
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:38,600
Ash!

2459
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2460
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:44,500
Okay.

2461
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:45,420
Maybe...

2462
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,040
No!

2463
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:46,600
Fuck!

2464
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:47,460
Oh, no!

2465
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:47,800
Okay.

2466
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,040
Maybe now?

2467
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:49,940
Nice.

2468
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,700
Gives me a little bit of my HP back.

2469
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:52,740
That's...

2470
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:52,980
Oh!

2471
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2472
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:55,360
No!

2473
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:55,780
No!

2474
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:56,560
Oh, God!

2475
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,220
Oh!

2476
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,340
That is not good!

2477
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,380
That is not good!

2478
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,340
Okay.

2479
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:02,400
No.

2480
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:02,740
Okay.

2481
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,400
I need to stand still.

2482
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:03,800
Please.

2483
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:05,100
Guys, I need to...

2484
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:05,460
No!

2485
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:05,880
Please!

2486
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,660
Let me stand still!

2487
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,160
I need recharge!

2488
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,120
Okay.

2489
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:09,660
Oh, God.

2490
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:10,320
Just a little bit.

2491
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,900
Just a little bit.

2492
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,840
Please, just let me recharge just a little bit.

2493
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:15,820
Oh, thank God.

2494
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:17,680
Okay.

2495
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:19,520
Okay.

2496
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:19,940
Recharge.

2497
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,200
Let me recharge just a little bit.

2498
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,920
These guys are actual, like, griefers.

2499
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:25,700
Not gonna lie.

2500
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,820
They're actual griefers.

2501
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,500
Oh, it's because he's like a mini-boss!

2502
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,840
That makes sense.

2503
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,140
Wait, I can farm him.

2504
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,340
I can stand still and farm him.

2505
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:36,780
Oh, okay.

2506
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,180
Nice.

2507
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:37,500
All right.

2508
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:39,980
Nice.

2509
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:40,600
Yes!

2510
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:42,860
Got my HP back.

2511
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,040
Okay.

2512
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,100
This is actually good for me.

2513
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,000
These guys can give me so much HP.

2514
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:47,460
I'm gonna go back to the base.

2515
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:53,180
And then I can just, like, put the snare out so they can't touch me here.

2516
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,420
All right.

2517
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:55,700
Nice.

2518
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,080
All right.

2519
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,860
And then snare!

2520
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:01,520
Okay.

2521
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,280
Here we go.

2522
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,340
And then I'll just snare them here.

2523
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:06,680
Snare!

2524
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,400
Wait, I know the stride now!

2525
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:11,260
Okay.

2526
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:11,620
Nice.

2527
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,280
Look at that strategy.

2528
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,360
I told you I could use my brain.

2529
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:17,440
Man.

2530
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,500
It's only when it matters.

2531
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,020
And a lot of times it doesn't matter.

2532
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:29,100
It's not my fault that, like, I'm always on power save mode, guys.

2533
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:33,420
Just because I'm on power save mode doesn't mean I don't have a brain.

2534
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,100
Snare is actually so good.

2535
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:38,460
Whoa!

2536
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:40,220
Okay.

2537
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,520
That's not good, though.

2538
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,200
Okay.

2539
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:46,240
I just need to make sure they don't get near me.

2540
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,420
Because they're so good.

2541
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,940
There's so many of these little fucking guys.

2542
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,100
Why are they still existing?

2543
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,360
Holy shit.

2544
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,140
Okay.

2545
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,560
All right.

2546
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,760
I'm just gonna put a snare here so I can be at peace.

2547
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,680
Is it because these are still alive?

2548
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,560
Oh my god.

2549
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,640
There's so many birdfish!

2550
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,140
I felt like I just killed, like, a million of them and now they're, like, an endangered species.

2551
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:17,400
Oh my god.

2552
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:18,040
Easy.

2553
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:19,620
Yay!

2554
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,140
Yeah, there's, like, so many...

2555
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:22,220
Oh!

2556
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:24,880
Gambling!

2557
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:27,180
Uh...

2558
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,440
I think I can do the shop.

2559
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:29,960
Actually, I feel like I need more HP.

2560
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,120
Uh...

2561
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,220
Shop or HP, guys?

2562
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,420
I feel like I might need more HP because, like, uh...

2563
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:41,360
Uh...

2564
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,980
Yeah, we don't have a lot of HP.

2565
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,900
We only had one HP upgrade so far.

2566
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:45,980
Oh my god.

2567
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:46,320
Bonus.

2568
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:46,920
Gambling?

2569
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,020
Aww.

2570
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:48,500
Aww.

2571
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,380
No Gamba.

2572
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,720
No Gamba.

2573
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,480
Alright, we have 162 gold, but no Gamba time.

2574
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,040
Who are these guys?

2575
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:07,660
An ever-present song compels the nightmare-bringing princess ever forward towards the beauty deeper into the abyss.

2576
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,120
Boss 2 already?

2577
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,340
Of course, because I'm a gamer.

2578
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,160
She's not feeding the allegations!

2579
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,400
She's a gamer.

2580
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:17,700
Gamer!

2581
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:21,100
Who's she?

2582
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:22,960
Is it Rockband?

2583
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,480
I'm Hades too.

2584
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,140
Hey!

2585
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:02,740
Hey!

2586
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,780
That means they're really good performers.

2587
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,420
That their fans are willing to die for them.

2588
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,180
Yeah!

2589
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,440
Exactly!

2590
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:14,160
How dare you!

2591
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:20,830
Alright.

2592
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:22,910
Can I cast her?

2593
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:24,010
Okay guys!

2594
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:25,510
Cast does not work on them!

2595
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:27,310
Cast does not work on them!

2596
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:31,270
Okay.

2597
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:34,410
Well, that's good to- OH MY GOD!

2598
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:38,810
WHAT?!

2599
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:41,630
Guys.

2600
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:43,970
Can I kill her?

2601
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:45,190
WHAT?!

2602
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:46,390
Okay.

2603
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:49,490
Does cast work on her?

2604
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,650
Okay, cast works on her!

2605
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:51,730
Alright, that's good.

2606
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:52,170
That's good.

2607
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:52,490
We know.

2608
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,530
Okay, I'll just cast her.

2609
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:56,810
Oh, no!

2610
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,110
Wait, this is a bit difficult.

2611
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:04,390
Wait, this is actually pretty difficult, guys.

2612
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:06,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2613
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:08,930
Wait, wait, I'm fucking dead!

2614
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:10,250
Oh my god!

2615
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:12,590
Okay, I'm so confused.

2616
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:14,270
Oh, I don't like this level.

2617
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:16,630
Guys.

2618
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:17,410
I actually...

2619
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:19,250
Wait, wait, a minute.

2620
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:20,130
Wait, a minute.

2621
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:20,950
Wait a min...

2622
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:23,770
Wait a minute.

2623
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:23,950
Wait a minute.

2624
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:26,250
Oh no.

2625
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:27,190
Oh no!

2626
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:30,030
No!

2627
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:37,490
This boss fucking sucks.

2628
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,600
I had one fucking timing.

2629
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:58,700
No!

2630
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,580
I hate that.

2631
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,960
This is my new hate.

2632
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,100
I hate this boss.

2633
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,140
It's brooding time.

2634
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,440
Bro, I've never hated... You know what?

2635
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:29,640
I hate boss fights where it's not one person.

2636
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:31,340
They just add two more...

2637
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:34,640
They add more bosses in a one boss fight game.

2638
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:38,700
And like... It's... Just to spike the difficulty.

2639
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:41,160
I hate that mechanic so much.

2640
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,240
I think that's a fucking bullshit boss battle.

2641
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:51,220
Because you have to pay attention to three different bosses that have their own fucking pattern.

2642
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:52,560
That is randomized.

2643
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,420
Because there's no way that they're gonna walk the same path.

2644
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,240
They're gonna walk similar together.

2645
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:08,480
Hey Dora.

2646
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,260
Skill issue.

2647
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,800
It's not a skill issue!

2648
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:14,720
It's a hate!

2649
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:19,560
Alright.

2650
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,840
Bye Dora.

2651
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,460
Is he like my friend?

2652
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:27,460
Is she like... Like those like... Familiars?

2653
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,880
Is she like a familiar?

2654
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,540
Oh, the cauldron's ready?

2655
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:36,920
Wait, what's this?

2656
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,720
Beta intervention.

2657
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:43,740
Persuade the retro broker to appear with whom you may trade for various resources.

2658
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,320
For those who know...

2659
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,000
Receive... Wait, I want this!

2660
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,480
Mostly used for unlock... Yeah!

2661
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:50,580
We want pickaxe!

2662
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,240
Dark of chaos.

2663
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:54,000
Light of...

2664
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Give me pickaxe!

2665
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,160
Heed now my will.

2666
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,640
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

2667
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,400
Thank you.

2668
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,060
So might it be.

2669
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,160
Oh!

2670
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,560
I got pickaxe now.

2671
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,060
Okay, and then... I guess we can summon him.

2672
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:05,700
I'm ready.

2673
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,820
By blood and darkness, let my will be done.

2674
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:11,360
Yeah!

2675
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:12,420
Yeah!

2676
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,360
Alright.

2677
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,180
Welcome to the crossroads.

2678
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,620
What is he gonna sell me?

2679
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,560
Okay, let me talk to the placeholder guy.

2680
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:21,860
Salute.

2681
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:22,020
Beware, mistress.

2682
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,540
Oh no, that's Hecate.

2683
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:24,140
I'm just a woman anyway.

2684
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:24,660
Sorry.

2685
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:29,220
I swear the boat guy and her have like similar costumes.

2686
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,200
Maybe it's because they're both wearing all black.

2687
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,220
At least our cauldrons finally purified.

2688
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:34,180
Praise the fates.

2689
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:39,680
Speaking of which, are you as yet considering an invocation to them?

2690
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,680
I have my doubts that they would listen even now.

2691
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,800
If there's any chance the three fates shall aid us, I'll take it.

2692
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,220
Thank you for preparing things for me.

2693
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,000
Though I'm well sure that I will.

2694
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,360
I ought to freshly picked reagents still.

2695
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,120
Mmm.

2696
01:44:55,620 --> 01:45:02,520
I'd offer such reagents if I could, but as you venture past this glade, look carefully along your path...

2697
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:03,180
Aren't they related?

2698
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,380
Well, one's a witch and the other one's dead.

2699
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:06,760
I don't know.

2700
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,260
Yes, headmistress.

2701
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,400
Yay!

2702
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,780
What are you selling?

2703
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:13,420
Hailbroker.

2704
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:13,800
Oh!

2705
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,300
Ash and psych.

2706
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,460
Wait, what's fate fabric?

2707
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:18,840
What's fate fabric, guys?

2708
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,580
I still don't know what the psych is for.

2709
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:20,680
What is this for?

2710
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:23,160
It hasn't told me what psych is for.

2711
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,560
What is it?

2712
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:28,580
E to C?

2713
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,940
Yeah, fuck her!

2714
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,440
Nobody likes her.

2715
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:43,620
Wait, why is she trying to slow me down?

2716
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:53,700
Yeah, I thought we were supposed to be really good friends and roommates.

2717
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:01,920
Why is she gonna keep doing this to me?

2718
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,320
Why can't we just tell her to stop?

2719
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,200
Somebody tell her to stop!

2720
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,560
Like, what?

2721
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,400
She's a little quirky.

2722
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:18,280
Just slap her!

2723
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:20,880
Be like, bad!

2724
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:23,800
Bad, Iris!

2725
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,440
Oh, so Kronos took over Hades.

2726
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,920
Wait, so...

2727
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,120
Does that mean no one can die now?

2728
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,260
Because there's no...

2729
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,540
No one can die now because there's no, like, after life?

2730
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,600
We do a little bit of tomfoolery.

2731
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:44,260
Wait, is there anything... did I miss anything here?

2732
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,420
Can I still talk to Hypnos?

2733
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,220
No, okay.

2734
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,340
He's just leaping.

2735
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:50,860
He's just eepy.

2736
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,600
Death to Kronos.

2737
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,420
Oh yeah, where do we go now?

2738
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,260
Yes and no?

2739
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,240
They died, they just don't stay dead?

2740
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,240
Oh, wait, that's good!

2741
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,780
Then we should, like, let Kronos still be the house of Hades.

2742
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,920
Uh... well, we need regen.

2743
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:11,720
And then...

2744
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:13,380
Let's see, after every...

2745
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,780
Your new Akina card requires more graphs than you have available.

2746
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,440
So you cannot be activated.

2747
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,720
Oh, that's what Grasp is!

2748
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:23,000
Top right corner to increase your Grasp or de...

2749
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,580
Oh!

2750
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:26,940
We're not having a Grasp?

2751
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,200
I want more Grasp.

2752
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,400
Okay, let me...

2753
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,780
Now they turn into ghosts?

2754
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:37,500
Wait, then that's good!

2755
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:38,660
I get to haunt people.

2756
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:42,640
I'll be like, you fuck with me, I'm now gonna haunt you forever.

2757
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,900
Grasp is psyche.

2758
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,420
Wait, but I could save him.

2759
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,040
I'm gonna save him for your Fabra.

2760
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:51,440
Firmly grasp it.

2761
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,620
Alright, let's see.

2762
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,420
Just breathe.

2763
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,840
Uh, gain plus two Grasp.

2764
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,360
Greater Grasp lets you activate more...

2765
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,460
Wait, how much do I need?

2766
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:05,200
Oh, I need 12.

2767
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:07,600
Uh...

2768
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,860
I guess I could...

2769
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:10,940
Can I get rid of something?

2770
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:14,220
I like the move slower.

2771
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,280
I feel like...

2772
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,620
Well, I can't activate anything yet.

2773
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,920
I'll just do all these first.

2774
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,060
Just breathe.

2775
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,900
Each Knight with one Death Defiance after every...

2776
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,820
Wait, I want to save for a Death Defiance actually.

2777
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,200
Wait, do I already have it?

2778
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,300
No, I'm too low.

2779
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,880
It's beyond my Grasp.

2780
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,320
I could turn this off and put this...

2781
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,480
I feel like if I turn...

2782
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:37,400
Yeah, I'm gonna turn this off.

2783
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,320
And then we can have it.

2784
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:40,440
I already have regen.

2785
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,680
Regen seems a lot better.

2786
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:42,920
I'm gonna do...

2787
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:48,900
Where...

2788
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:49,400
Oh, wait.

2789
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:49,880
Can I...

2790
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,760
Do I have another weapon now?

2791
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,300
I do!

2792
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:53,800
I don't!

2793
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:56,480
Okay.

2794
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:57,620
It's the pick.

2795
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:01,560
Alright.

2796
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:06,520
Nice.

2797
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,740
Do I have it equipped yet?

2798
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,680
I do.

2799
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:14,120
Okay.

2800
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,040
I need to find these.

2801
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,240
Wait, I can upgrade my Grasp?

2802
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,480
I don't have enough...

2803
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,800
I don't have enough Psyche for that.

2804
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:24,360
Yeah, I need 40.

2805
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:26,320
I have 20?

2806
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,640
So I need to start farming Psyche now.

2807
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:32,020
Yeah, but I want to save up for the Faded Fabric.

2808
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:34,240
I don't know what it is, but it sounds fucking cool.

2809
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,480
Why is it the same thing?

2810
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:40,680
Does he give me anything new?

2811
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:43,360
No, I just want to talk.

2812
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:46,800
The value of shadowy denizen of the underworld comes with certain perks, young one.

2813
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:51,200
Take for instance how when you dash, nothing can touch you.

2814
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,780
We are the unseen.

2815
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,480
At one with the darkness...

2816
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,740
Yeah, the infinity frames.

2817
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:57,320
... would repeat anything.

2818
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:57,780
Yes.

2819
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:02,280
But only for a moment, and even then, I can't prevail by dodging all night long.

2820
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:05,420
Yeah, I'd do it all the time if I was you.

2821
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:07,720
See the little trail when you dash.

2822
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,620
Once it snaps back, you're good to go again.

2823
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:12,440
Uhh.

2824
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:12,660
Huh?

2825
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:12,900
Okay.

2826
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,060
That's interesting.

2827
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:28,780
What's this?

2828
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,080
Restore my magic.

2829
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:31,520
Okay.

2830
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,000
Do I have to look at the scenery again for more lore?

2831
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,320
Oh, so I have to go through all of this...

2832
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:42,180
to reach Olympus.

2833
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,120
Am I going to Olympus?

2834
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,880
I assume it's Olympus, right?

2835
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:48,800
So pretty.

2836
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,940
I wonder if this is a placeholder.

2837
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,520
Because I feel like they could definitely improve this one.

2838
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:56,120
Because, I don't know.

2839
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,060
It sort of looks like a sketch.

2840
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,060
It does sort of look like a placeholder.

2841
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,560
Alright, down I'll go.

2842
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,280
Wait, no, you're right.

2843
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:16,220
No, down is up.

2844
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:17,140
Guys.

2845
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,860
Oh my god, YouTube, please.

2846
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,680
Okay, the only other thing I know about Hades 2 is her.

2847
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:23,600
Aphrodite.

2848
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,320
Guys!

2849
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,040
Guys, calm...

2850
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,560
Guys, guys, calm down.

2851
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:30,100
Guys, let me...

2852
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,480
Guys, calm down.

2853
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,580
Calm down, everybody.

2854
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:36,920
Calm down, everyone.

2855
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,380
Calm down!

2856
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,420
I doubtless this one knows hatred, not just love.

2857
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,380
And the name of Hades.

2858
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,420
Olympus, accept this message.

2859
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,120
It's her.

2860
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,100
You're gorgeous.

2861
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,720
You look like you can break some hearts even without my aid.

2862
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,280
Oh, your brother would be so proud.

2863
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,360
Her eyes are up there, chat!

2864
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,160
Her eyes are up there!

2865
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:09,360
Your special deals more damage...

2866
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,360
to nearby foes.

2867
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,480
Your cast...

2868
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:11,720
Whoa!

2869
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,940
If you each encounter one foe is always weak, you gradually restore...

2870
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:16,000
Oh!

2871
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:19,700
Near weak foes.

2872
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:20,440
Wait, I like that.

2873
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,160
Glamour gain.

2874
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,260
Wait, what do you mean?

2875
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,660
What do you mean, Hades 2?

2876
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:30,260
Why do you want to learn more from her?

2877
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,140
Okay.

2878
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:32,700
Nice.

2879
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,560
Everyone is gonna...

2880
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,820
Oh my gosh, the regen is actually so clutch, not gonna lie.

2881
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:41,100
Looks like a new path out.

2882
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:42,620
Don't forget the silver?

2883
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,340
What does the silver look like though?

2884
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:46,420
Like...

2885
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:51,060
Near all of the near endless pathways and suffocating Erebus...

2886
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:51,920
Oh, I see it!

2887
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,140
It has like moon rocks!

2888
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,240
...and very scarce are those who can navigate...

2889
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:56,460
All rocks come from the moon.

2890
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,140
I don't know if you guys know that.

2891
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:00,000
...to figure out.

2892
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:01,180
Silver.

2893
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:02,980
But how much can I collect?

2894
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:03,900
Whoa!

2895
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:05,580
Collecting moon rocks!

2896
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,160
That's where rocks are born, chat.

2897
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:17,580
The moon like cries and then like the tears are the rocks that come out of the moon ducts and then it falls on the earth.

2898
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:20,000
Today I learned.

2899
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,960
Is that interesting fact, guys?

2900
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,080
I learned that like...

2901
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:29,260
I learned that like in elementary school.

2902
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,880
From my science teacher.

2903
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:36,680
Every time you see a rock, just remember it came from the moon.

2904
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:37,860
Hahaha!

2905
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:42,060
Astronomy with Doki!

2906
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:43,960
Uh...

2907
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,340
I definitely need heals.

2908
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,320
I'm like 30 HP.

2909
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:48,720
What's this?

2910
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:49,500
No!

2911
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,280
Okay, Majora's Mask...

2912
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:51,860
No, no.

2913
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,240
Majora's Mask is different.

2914
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,520
Majora's Mask, the moon is trying to kill you.

2915
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:57,120
But like...

2916
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,800
But like in the real world...

2917
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,280
The moon is just crying.

2918
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:02,280
Because it's sad.

2919
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:05,240
It's sad because it wants to date the earth.

2920
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,900
But the earth like always was like...

2921
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:08,540
I don't know, man.

2922
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:09,080
Like...

2923
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,820
I just see you as a really good friend, you know?

2924
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:13,480
Like...

2925
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:14,580
I don't know.

2926
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,040
I don't think we can make it work.

2927
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,280
It's just gonna ruin our friendship.

2928
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:18,500
Alright.

2929
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,600
Money or heart?

2930
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:20,460
I feel like more heart.

2931
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,160
We don't need money.

2932
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:22,540
Sad moon!

2933
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,120
That's why...

2934
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:26,220
So then the moon is like the creepy stalker.

2935
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,940
That wouldn't leave the earth alone.

2936
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:30,700
Because the moon keeps following them every...

2937
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:31,780
Every rotation.

2938
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,560
And the earth was like...

2939
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:34,380
Bro, come on, man.

2940
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:34,860
Hahaha!

2941
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:38,240
Moon-chan got...

2942
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,560
Wait, the hunt is on?

2943
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:41,760
Who the fuck is hunting me?

2944
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,140
I'm here talking about my...

2945
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,380
My earth slash moon fanfiction.

2946
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,080
Oh!

2947
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:53,500
Wait, Artemis?

2948
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,220
Is that Artemis?

2949
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:57,880
Artemis, help me!

2950
01:54:59,020 --> 01:54:59,620
Nice.

2951
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:02,060
Artemis, is she helping me?

2952
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,920
Oh, that's nice though.

2953
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:08,300
Yeah, she's helping me!

2954
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:08,720
Nice!

2955
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,040
I can continue my earth slash moon fanfiction.

2956
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,500
And then like...

2957
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:13,140
So like...

2958
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:15,900
And then there was like a mistake that they made one night.

2959
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,080
Where like...

2960
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:17,580
Um...

2961
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:22,120
Where like the moon tried to make the earth jealous by...

2962
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:22,900
Artemis!

2963
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:25,900
By trying to hook up with the sun.

2964
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:27,780
And they're like...

2965
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:29,400
Wait, let's get some light first.

2966
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,240
Hello, Artemis!

2967
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:33,760
Sister?

2968
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:34,560
I'm sorry.

2969
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:34,740
I'm sorry.

2970
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:35,520
I'm coming to see you.

2971
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:36,920
Hey, she's so different.

2972
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:47,600
And her couple name is Eclipse!

2973
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:55,620
Alright.

2974
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:04,080
Ozu, at least, may take critical damage.

2975
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:04,880
Aramiel...

2976
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:09,480
Cast?

2977
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,540
Wait, wouldn't that... would lethal snare be good?

2978
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,140
Because I'm snaring a lot too.

2979
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:20,640
I feel like.

2980
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,120
Or unless we get death warrant.

2981
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:28,680
I feel like snare would be better.

2982
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,440
Just because I'm always snaring.

2983
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:33,320
And then it may take critical damage.

2984
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:34,580
Yeah, I use snare a lot.

2985
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:36,280
Alright, we're gonna go with snare.

2986
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,520
Bye Artemis!

2987
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:42,460
We're gonna need Sykes so we can grab more.

2988
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,040
Why can't she do that all the time?

2989
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:44,680
I don't understand.

2990
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:47,240
She should be helping me all the time.

2991
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:48,160
Because we're sisters.

2992
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,260
Black, thank you for the super chat.

2993
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,100
Thank you, thank you!

2994
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,860
And then the Urf has to like...

2995
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:57,320
Wait!

2996
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:58,240
Armor time!

2997
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:02,180
Wait, not armor time?

2998
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,460
Oh, I found it!

2999
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:07,740
Wait, does that mean...

3000
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:08,420
Wait, that was easy.

3001
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,100
Does that mean these are monsters?

3002
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:14,300
I assume these were monsters, right?

3003
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:14,880
Yeah.

3004
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:15,700
Alright, I did it.

3005
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:19,320
First try!

3006
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,780
Fistball, thank you for the super chat.

3007
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,740
Thank you, thank you!

3008
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,720
The moon orbits the earth, but the Urf orbits the sun.

3009
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,360
Love triangle, thank you for the super chat.

3010
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:31,400
Thank you, thank you!

3011
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:33,300
Lost core, thank you for the super chat.

3012
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,440
Thank you!

3013
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:39,600
The Urf and moon banged once 4.5 billion years ago and learned that they weren't meant for each other.

3014
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,140
It was like a mistake, you know?

3015
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:42,340
So the... and that's...

3016
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:45,620
The earth knew it was a mistake, but he can't let go.

3017
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:48,480
But the moon was like, no, give me one more chance, earth-kun!

3018
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:51,500
Oh, shit!

3019
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,460
I just want more money!

3020
01:57:57,700 --> 01:57:58,320
That's fine.

3021
01:57:58,640 --> 01:57:59,820
I just want more money.

3022
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:02,340
So we're just gonna do this for the...

3023
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,600
It's just for the money, guys!

3024
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,360
Like, I already fucking...

3025
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,260
Oh, guys, why did I do this for the money?!

3026
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:12,260
Okay, this is actually pretty bad.

3027
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:17,920
Okay, I... I realize I don't have vampire...

3028
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,040
No, it does not mean to fucking kill this guy too!

3029
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:21,140
Okay...

3030
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:21,300
Oh!

3031
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:22,960
Shop, shop, shop!

3032
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:23,200
No!

3033
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:24,200
No, no, it's locked!

3034
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:25,120
Okay.

3035
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,820
Okay, this is bad.

3036
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:28,400
This is bad.

3037
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,940
I forgot I don't have vampire.

3038
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:32,520
So, like, this is not as fun.

3039
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:35,840
Alright.

3040
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:36,760
Nice.

3041
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:38,840
We'll go get Psyche.

3042
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,220
Actually, we'll go grab...

3043
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,220
We'll go to the shop.

3044
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,400
Alright.

3045
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:47,880
No!

3046
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:50,460
I don't have enough money!

3047
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,360
But we'll upgrade, I guess.

3048
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:02,380
I recall that his plans to conquer Olympus is sensitive work.

3049
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:08,680
No.

3050
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:14,480
Oh.

3051
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:22,280
Does Corina want to be the Titan Lord?

3052
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,560
Or are we just gonna help him.

3053
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,540
Alright, let's grab the Moon Tears again.

3054
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:27,560
Yay!

3055
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:28,560
Get this.

3056
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:30,700
More Moon Tears!

3057
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:35,840
Okay, let's snare them here so they can't hurt me.

3058
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,560
And then we'll use that.

3059
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:39,540
And then we'll have money.

3060
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,940
And then we're just gonna get them away from us.

3061
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:43,880
Oh, wait.

3062
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,220
That's fine, they're dead anyway.

3063
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:46,760
Yay!

3064
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,120
Oh, he's the weaker one.

3065
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,120
The weaker child.

3066
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:51,960
Nobody loves you because you're weak as fuck.

3067
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,960
We're just gonna get rid of the spinners.

3068
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,240
And then the little guys here.

3069
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:58,540
We'll stun them.

3070
01:59:58,540 --> 01:59:59,080
Unlock them.

3071
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:01,580
Nice.

3072
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:02,280
Wait, what are you doing?

3073
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,040
Why are you watching me?

3074
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:04,080
Go help!

3075
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:06,200
Nice.

3076
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,520
Fire time!

3077
02:00:13,460 --> 02:00:15,700
Woah, what?

3078
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,840
Who's older?

3079
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:25,920
Hestia or Aphrodite?

3080
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:28,860
Wait, does that mean Aphrodite is all plastic?

3081
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:32,080
Is that what she... Is that what Grand...

3082
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,060
Grand Fire is trying to apply?

3083
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:37,220
... but give up one...

3084
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,340
Hestia's like, no fuck her.

3085
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:41,980
Give me...

3086
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,820
Give me your glamour.

3087
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:46,120
Alright.

3088
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:48,600
You cast repeatedly Scorched Foes.

3089
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,980
Your special inflicts foes.

3090
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:56,700
Let's see.

3091
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:58,380
Do I do...

3092
02:00:58,540 --> 02:00:59,440
I use cast a lot.

3093
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,220
We'll use cast.

3094
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,660
Flame of the hearth.

3095
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,380
Ashroq's glamour.

3096
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,440
I feel like I should keep getting more psyche.

3097
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:14,100
Because I feel like I have not been farming psyche and I really need more psyche so I can have more cards to use.

3098
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:16,960
Alright, let's go.

3099
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:19,600
We'll do this.

3100
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:21,240
And bam.

3101
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:25,060
I need to be more careful because like uh...

3102
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:28,500
I definitely don't have vampire anymore.

3103
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:30,020
So like...

3104
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:32,840
So... so like...

3105
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,980
This is actually life or death now.

3106
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:37,860
Alright, nice.

3107
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:40,260
Now we're just gonna get these guys out of the way.

3108
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:42,180
Alright, snare them.

3109
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,200
Alright, nice.

3110
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,740
And then poof.

3111
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:47,860
And then poof.

3112
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:49,940
Easy.

3113
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:50,500
Yeah!

3114
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,140
I still don't know what the...

3115
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:54,000
Oh, this is magic.

3116
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:55,040
Okay, so I rather...

3117
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:55,600
I rather just...

3118
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,780
Wait, does that...

3119
02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:01,300
This makes my max magic stronger.

3120
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,920
But who cares about that?

3121
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,120
It's all about power-ups.

3122
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:06,860
Uh...

3123
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:08,640
Okay...

3124
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,540
And then...

3125
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:12,840
Line this up real fast.

3126
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:15,460
And then line this up.

3127
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:18,960
I don't know.

3128
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:22,440
I feel like the common enemies are easier.

3129
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,980
But by fucking god.

3130
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:27,180
The bosses are so difficult now.

3131
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:29,120
I feel like level...

3132
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:34,100
The first level and the second level bosses were not as hard as this.

3133
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:43,120
Definitely feels like common enemies are easy.

3134
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:45,520
Bosses are hard.

3135
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:57,620
Yeah, the titans are like...

3136
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:02,740
They might be pre-gods and goddesses, but there's a reason why the titans are all died out.

3137
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:04,540
Alright.

3138
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,080
Wait, Lucid... Wait!

3139
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:09,180
While standing in your cast...

3140
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:09,940
Wait, what?

3141
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:10,780
Exchange?

3142
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:12,760
Heroic?

3143
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:13,300
But it's heroic.

3144
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:17,320
While standing in your cast, gradually restores...

3145
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:18,480
What was glamour again?

3146
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,820
Uh, do I get this?

3147
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,640
Okay, I don't need glamour.

3148
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:26,780
Uh...

3149
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,480
Wait, I want this because I want the fabric.

3150
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:33,380
Okay.

3151
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,260
That's good, right?

3152
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:37,120
Oop.

3153
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,360
That's right.

3154
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:39,520
You can't touch me.

3155
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,740
He can touch me.

3156
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:42,900
Alright.

3157
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:44,880
Nice.

3158
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:46,400
So I can just stand here and farm.

3159
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:49,680
I can literally stand here and just farm this, right?

3160
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,440
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3161
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:53,500
Okay, and then...

3162
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,340
Let's see.

3163
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:56,560
I'll cast and then... Oh!

3164
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:57,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3165
02:03:58,860 --> 02:03:59,260
Alright.

3166
02:03:59,420 --> 02:03:59,820
Nope.

3167
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:01,340
Alright, and then cast.

3168
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:02,840
Oh god!

3169
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:03,160
Okay.

3170
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,280
Just keep casting.

3171
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:05,600
Oh my god!

3172
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:06,920
Wait, this... Oh shit!

3173
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:07,620
No!

3174
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:08,380
Okay.

3175
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,400
Anyway, I can keep farming this.

3176
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:16,040
Because all I do is just... I do infinite cast and then I just farm it inside my cast.

3177
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,000
Yeah, I have the regen.

3178
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:21,540
Oh, I need to grab the...

3179
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:23,460
I need to grab the... the...

3180
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:24,360
the thingy.

3181
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:26,460
Uhhhhhh...

3182
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:28,520
I don't need magic anymore.

3183
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:30,960
Because like, I have infinite cast.

3184
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:32,800
Yeah.

3185
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,320
And then I'll just do this.

3186
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:37,180
And then I'll just do this.

3187
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,340
And then I can cast this.

3188
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,300
And I'll just stand here.

3189
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:41,720
And then...

3190
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,020
Wait, how do I lose it?

3191
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:47,340
How did I lose my magic if I'm infinitely charging?

3192
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:48,920
And I do this.

3193
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,120
Fucking easy.

3194
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:53,980
Oh my gosh.

3195
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:55,340
Easiest game of my life.

3196
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,740
Yeah, I can just kill all of them here.

3197
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:01,820
I don't even need a sprint.

3198
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:03,880
I don't even need a sprint.

3199
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,300
Hello granny, I'm back!

3200
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:07,900
Your attack inflicts scorch.

3201
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:11,520
Your fire launches a fiery projectile but uses...

3202
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,460
my special...

3203
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:17,280
Whenever scorched, afflicted foes are slain.

3204
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:18,540
I have scorch, right?

3205
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:19,560
I've cast scorch!

3206
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:20,460
Wait, this is good!

3207
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:23,640
Natural gas with my...

3208
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:24,560
cast.

3209
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:31,230
Uh...

3210
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:32,230
Wasn't it?

3211
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:34,270
Because then I have like...

3212
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:36,870
my cast plus...

3213
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:38,150
Yeah!

3214
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:40,150
Natural gas plus my cast.

3215
02:05:41,670 --> 02:05:44,610
You're not charging special use... Yeah, exactly.

3216
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:47,790
I still don't know how to use my special.

3217
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:50,930
Do I even have a special?

3218
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:54,790
I don't have enough for...

3219
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:56,530
the shop though.

3220
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:58,570
I only have 142.

3221
02:05:59,210 --> 02:06:00,850
So maybe I should go for an upgrade?

3222
02:06:01,690 --> 02:06:03,590
I actually don't have enough for the shop.

3223
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:04,650
I have only 100.

3224
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:05,570
Wait.

3225
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:07,210
Oh, this is my special.

3226
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:08,630
Oh, whoops.

3227
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:10,150
Whoops.

3228
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:12,030
Uh...

3229
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:13,270
I should go fruit.

3230
02:06:15,050 --> 02:06:16,390
Yeah, special is my...

3231
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:18,570
I keep forgetting that special is my range attack.

3232
02:06:20,930 --> 02:06:22,170
Oh my god!

3233
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:23,610
I can make a better heroic!

3234
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:25,030
I'm gonna go with that.

3235
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:27,870
Alright, it's Hecate time.

3236
02:06:33,790 --> 02:06:34,430
Okay!

3237
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:40,290
So I have to kill my...

3238
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:41,770
my... my...

3239
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:43,370
spiritual mom.

3240
02:06:45,810 --> 02:06:46,610
It's me!

3241
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:51,570
You surpassed me before, yet I wonder...

3242
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:54,490
Was it your mastery over our craft?

3243
02:06:54,990 --> 02:06:58,610
Or did the fates themselves perhaps provide a little...

3244
02:06:58,610 --> 02:06:59,130
nudge?

3245
02:07:01,010 --> 02:07:02,050
Come, headmistress.

3246
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:05,770
If I could be provoked that easily, I'd stand no chance at all.

3247
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:06,390
This is easy.

3248
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:07,230
I'm heroic now.

3249
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:11,570
I might not have regen, but I have regen and mana.

3250
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:14,190
... comes to those in no position to receive it.

3251
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:15,810
Show me your victory.

3252
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:16,650
It was not a fluke.

3253
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:17,470
It was all a skill.

3254
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:21,150
Alright, here we go.

3255
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:22,410
See?

3256
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:25,190
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3257
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:27,310
And then I do this.

3258
02:07:28,070 --> 02:07:28,750
Okay!

3259
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:33,390
Okay, that's not fair.

3260
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:38,370
That's not fair!

3261
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:41,010
She doesn't get stuck in my cast!

3262
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:44,290
Oh god.

3263
02:07:44,570 --> 02:07:45,250
Okay.

3264
02:07:45,390 --> 02:07:46,710
And then I'll do this.

3265
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:47,930
And then...

3266
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:49,770
Okay, that is...

3267
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:50,770
No, that's a fake.

3268
02:07:50,910 --> 02:07:51,610
That's a fake!

3269
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:52,870
That's also a fake!

3270
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:54,470
That's real.

3271
02:07:54,610 --> 02:07:55,210
He's real.

3272
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:56,550
He's real!

3273
02:07:56,630 --> 02:07:56,810
No!

3274
02:07:58,370 --> 02:07:59,530
Guys, I think I...

3275
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:01,610
Guys, regen might have been a crutch.

3276
02:08:01,730 --> 02:08:02,410
Just a maybe.

3277
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:03,230
Just a maybe.

3278
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:03,890
I'm not sure yet.

3279
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:04,670
It's a maybe.

3280
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:05,670
Oh!

3281
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:06,630
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3282
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:09,150
We're fine.

3283
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:10,610
I can run.

3284
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:14,150
Okay, and then we're gonna get rid of you.

3285
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:15,970
And...

3286
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:17,250
We're gonna get rid of you.

3287
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:21,390
And then we're gonna get rid of you.

3288
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:23,490
You're weak as hell.

3289
02:08:23,890 --> 02:08:25,050
And then we're gonna get rid of you.

3290
02:08:25,530 --> 02:08:25,890
Easy.

3291
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:29,130
And then you're gonna be over here, right?

3292
02:08:29,730 --> 02:08:30,090
Right?

3293
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:30,790
You're gonna...

3294
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:32,270
You're gonna be over here, right?

3295
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:33,030
Oh no!

3296
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:33,570
No!

3297
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:34,270
No, no, no, no, no!

3298
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:37,030
No!

3299
02:08:38,910 --> 02:08:40,210
Okay, we're fine.

3300
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:40,490
We're fine.

3301
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:40,810
We're fine.

3302
02:08:41,610 --> 02:08:42,050
We're fine.

3303
02:08:44,190 --> 02:08:45,090
I'm trying!

3304
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:49,510
No, that's not the real one.

3305
02:08:49,730 --> 02:08:52,250
Of course I chose the non-real ones!

3306
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:53,630
Of course!

3307
02:08:56,510 --> 02:08:58,130
Alright, just half HP.

3308
02:08:58,370 --> 02:08:59,050
That's good.

3309
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:02,090
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3310
02:09:02,090 --> 02:09:02,670
Let me cast!

3311
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:05,870
Okay, and then... cast!

3312
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,890
Caaast!

3313
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:11,990
Okay, and then we go this way.

3314
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:14,530
Easy.

3315
02:09:15,870 --> 02:09:16,390
Cast.

3316
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:18,170
Cast.

3317
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:22,530
I'll just stay here in my cast circle.

3318
02:09:23,070 --> 02:09:24,130
It's like the...

3319
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:26,570
It's like that circle in Spongebob.

3320
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:27,510
Oh, nice.

3321
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:28,290
There it is.

3322
02:09:30,090 --> 02:09:31,570
It's like the Spongebob circle.

3323
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:33,330
The sand bear can't get me.

3324
02:09:33,770 --> 02:09:34,290
No!

3325
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:37,310
How do I dodge that?

3326
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:39,470
That's not fair!

3327
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:41,850
For the sea bears.

3328
02:09:41,930 --> 02:09:42,910
Sorry, it's the sea bears.

3329
02:09:44,930 --> 02:09:46,730
Like, how do I fucking dodge that?

3330
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:48,290
No!

3331
02:09:48,690 --> 02:09:50,230
Are you fucking kidding me?

3332
02:09:52,230 --> 02:09:53,030
Oh no.

3333
02:09:53,550 --> 02:09:54,330
Oh no.

3334
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,050
I'm 37 HP.

3335
02:09:58,290 --> 02:09:59,050
Oh gosh.

3336
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:00,170
The witch.

3337
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:00,930
Get the last witch.

3338
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:03,550
Alright.

3339
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,470
No, no, no, no, no.

3340
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:06,430
Gotta get rid of all the witches.

3341
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:08,690
Okay.

3342
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:10,010
And then...

3343
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:11,390
Please be over here.

3344
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:13,430
Please be over here.

3345
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:15,670
Please.

3346
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:16,110
Nice.

3347
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:17,370
Nice.

3348
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:18,130
Oh!

3349
02:10:18,230 --> 02:10:19,010
No, no, no, no, no!

3350
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:19,610
No!

3351
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,290
I got stuck!

3352
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:26,080
Is this the right one?

3353
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:27,160
Nope, it's not.

3354
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,500
Nope, it's not.

3355
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:29,560
This guy.

3356
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:32,180
Okay.

3357
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,000
It's fine.

3358
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,360
I can just farm this here.

3359
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:36,540
Oh!

3360
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:37,560
Nope, I cannot.

3361
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:38,780
Yes, I can.

3362
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:39,960
Nope, I cannot!

3363
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:41,340
Oh!

3364
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:42,080
My god!

3365
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,680
Guys, I made a mistake.

3366
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:53,340
Guys, I might have made just a little miscalculations.

3367
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,000
Oh god.

3368
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:56,440
Oh.

3369
02:10:56,980 --> 02:10:57,460
Okay.

3370
02:10:57,860 --> 02:10:59,360
I'll just keep casting right here.

3371
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:02,680
I'll just save my little safe zone.

3372
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:04,440
No, no, no, no, no.

3373
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:06,440
My little safe zone right here.

3374
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,500
Come on!

3375
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,840
Keep casting in your safe zone!

3376
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:11,660
Oh god.

3377
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:12,020
Please!

3378
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:12,480
Please.

3379
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,300
No!

3380
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,020
Fuck!

3381
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:16,840
Right here.

3382
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:19,420
Come on.

3383
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:20,780
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3384
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:22,240
I threw!

3385
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:24,180
I dashed it!

3386
02:11:30,290 --> 02:11:32,530
I actually dashed it!

3387
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:37,720
I dashed it!

3388
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:40,060
No!

3389
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:44,780
I got greedy!

3390
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:47,720
I was like, I got this.

3391
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,260
Who the fuck is this child?

3392
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:58,480
I can't believe I dashed into it.

3393
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:00,920
I can't fucking believe it.

3394
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:02,920
It was literally 1 HP.

3395
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,500
It was literally 1 HP.

3396
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:07,440
I can't believe it.

3397
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:08,940
I choked.

3398
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,980
I can't believe...

3399
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:19,020
I dashed into it and all I got was luck.

3400
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,680
I dashed into the floor.

3401
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,900
Oh my god.

3402
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:24,020
Looks so...

3403
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,860
Fucking... I don't know.

3404
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:28,920
She looks so...

3405
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,100
So like...

3406
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:31,420
Not their child.

3407
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:35,940
Looks so round.

3408
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:36,440
Yeah.

3409
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:38,760
The art style is like...

3410
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,740
I guess it's the art style.

3411
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:40,100
...

3412
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:41,400
...

3413
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:48,420
The art style looks like different from like the usual art style.

3414
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:49,020
... The art style looks like different from like the usual art style.

3415
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:52,380
... The art style looks like different from like the usual art style.

3416
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:53,480
She looks like Steven Universe.

3417
02:12:57,150 --> 02:12:58,670
Hey, I found you.

3418
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:00,230
Got you, Hecate!

3419
02:13:00,450 --> 02:13:01,030
You're dead!

3420
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:10,110
... Got me, you did, ... Got me, you did, ... but I dare say I can escape your clutches yet.

3421
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:11,850
... but I dare say I can escape your clutches yet.

3422
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:12,970
Whoa!

3423
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:15,050
Wait, she's gone!

3424
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:17,010
Where did she go?

3425
02:13:17,010 --> 02:13:17,290
Cool.

3426
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:21,290
Odysseus, where did she go?

3427
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:28,190
Alright.

3428
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:32,550
Yeah, where is she?

3429
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:37,310
Where are you?

3430
02:13:38,470 --> 02:13:39,890
Wait, if I was a... I'm a goddess.

3431
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:40,550
Oh, there she is!

3432
02:13:40,610 --> 02:13:40,950
I see her!

3433
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:43,730
Got you again!

3434
02:13:43,870 --> 02:13:45,930
I'm the best hide and seek finder there is!

3435
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:55,710
Wait, is she also a Titaness?

3436
02:13:56,770 --> 02:13:57,750
Or are they roleplaying?

3437
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:59,730
I thought Hecate was a witch.

3438
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:04,990
Where is she?

3439
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:05,890
Where did she go?

3440
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:09,270
Hello?

3441
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:10,890
Hecate?

3442
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:13,650
Hecate, where are you?

3443
02:14:13,730 --> 02:14:14,470
Oh, they're LARPing.

3444
02:14:14,650 --> 02:14:15,310
Oh, I see.

3445
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:16,910
Ye olde.

3446
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:17,690
Ancient LARP.

3447
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:20,210
Where did she go?

3448
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:20,830
Oh, there she is!

3449
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:21,350
I see her.

3450
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:23,070
Hello, Hecate!

3451
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:28,170
Oh, she is a Titan.

3452
02:14:28,990 --> 02:14:31,210
I thought they were all dead, except for Cronos.

3453
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:34,750
Like, gods and goddesses killed off all the Titans.

3454
02:14:35,090 --> 02:14:36,630
I've not heard your laughter before.

3455
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:39,030
Reminded me of your mother.

3456
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:42,330
A much preferable sound to that of grief.

3457
02:14:43,630 --> 02:14:45,250
I promise not to cry again.

3458
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:46,990
I still get sad.

3459
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:48,230
Oh no.

3460
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:49,750
Why are you sad?

3461
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:52,410
Your parents are still alive, we think.

3462
02:14:58,050 --> 02:14:59,950
Why is she abs?

3463
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:03,670
Be a witch is hard work, okay?

3464
02:15:04,570 --> 02:15:06,250
She did not skip the gym.

3465
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:08,930
But you never cry, Hecate.

3466
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:11,550
And I wish to become strong like you.

3467
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:15,910
So that I might find Cronos and destroy him for what he's done.

3468
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:17,350
And then...

3469
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:20,830
And I shall do everything in my power to prepare you.

3470
02:15:21,170 --> 02:15:23,650
So that you may succeed where I failed.

3471
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:25,590
If not for your family's sake, then for your birthright.

3472
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:26,910
You mean like, curiously through me?

3473
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:28,650
Like a child actor?

3474
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,510
As the princess of the underworld.

3475
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:31,570
That's me!

3476
02:15:32,170 --> 02:15:34,750
But I thought my brother is gonna inherit the underworld.

3477
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:37,770
What do you mean you failed?

3478
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:40,010
You tried to beat Cronos yourself?

3479
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,570
He hurt you?

3480
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:46,570
Concern yourself with your own pain, not mine.

3481
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:46,990
You are the one who is hurting me.

3482
02:15:46,990 --> 02:15:51,850
Destroying Cronos shall not change the past, and the pain shall linger.

3483
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:55,290
That will assert itself less frequently with age.

3484
02:15:56,130 --> 02:15:57,370
But enough of this.

3485
02:15:57,990 --> 02:16:02,070
On the morrow, we shall teach you to hunt greater prey.

3486
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:02,930
Oh, my god!

3487
02:16:03,510 --> 02:16:05,170
We're gonna start killing.

3488
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:08,830
Cause teach a child how to kill.

3489
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:10,910
Kill, kill, kill!

3490
02:16:12,810 --> 02:16:14,230
Death to Cronos.

3491
02:16:14,890 --> 02:16:16,250
Death to Cronos.

3492
02:16:16,270 --> 02:16:16,270
Death to Cronos.

3493
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:16,570
Of wait...

3494
02:16:16,570 --> 02:16:18,110
I don't have an arm, you're right!

3495
02:16:18,330 --> 02:16:20,210
I just noticed that I'm armless.

3496
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:21,730
Let's pet the frog.

3497
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:28,790
Alright guys, I know this is a short, really short stream.

3498
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:31,450
But I'm gonna call it here, because I'm tired.

3499
02:16:36,410 --> 02:16:37,790
We're gonna call it here.

3500
02:16:38,590 --> 02:16:41,170
We did stream like two and a half hours today.

3501
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:47,290
I'm like super tired right now.

3502
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:48,610
So we're gonna call it here.

3503
02:16:48,690 --> 02:16:51,310
I don't want to force myself when I'm like really tired.

3504
02:16:53,670 --> 02:16:57,530
But I honestly had a great time playing Hades 2.

3505
02:16:57,770 --> 02:17:00,390
I think like I'm gonna play Hades 2.

3506
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:05,390
I'm gonna wait until like the game gets out of early access to keep playing.

3507
02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:07,790
Because I don't want to like spoil myself.

3508
02:17:08,490 --> 02:17:11,150
I don't want to spoil myself the full game.

3509
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:11,790
I want to experience.

3510
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:14,890
And then like, and then when the game officially comes out.

3511
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:18,290
I get like, I like, I like, you know.

3512
02:17:18,690 --> 02:17:20,050
I get bored of it.

3513
02:17:20,230 --> 02:17:23,230
So I want to like, the next time I play Hades 2.

3514
02:17:23,390 --> 02:17:25,650
I'm gonna wait until it's fully released.

3515
02:17:25,890 --> 02:17:28,650
And then we'll play back to where it started.

3516
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:29,870
I don't want to get burned out on it.

3517
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:31,450
Yeah, I don't want to get burned out of it.

3518
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:33,490
And like I actually sort of like want to...

3519
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:37,970
I want to like be able to experience the full story.

3520
02:17:38,310 --> 02:17:41,150
In the way that the game wants me to.

3521
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:44,130
So the next time we're playing Hades 2.

3522
02:17:44,310 --> 02:17:47,570
We're going to wait until the full game is out.

3523
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:49,470
But I really enjoyed it.

3524
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:52,410
I really enjoyed it so far.

3525
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:55,610
I enjoyed the different power-ups and everything.

3526
02:17:56,090 --> 02:18:00,270
And I cannot wait to play Hades 2 when it's out of early access.

3527
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:05,950
I hope, I heard they're like planning of getting it out of early access by the end of the year, right?

3528
02:18:06,330 --> 02:18:07,710
Or next year.

3529
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:09,770
We'll see.

3530
02:18:10,410 --> 02:18:11,090
We'll see.

3531
02:18:11,470 --> 02:18:13,150
But yes, I had a great time.

3532
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:15,350
I'm sorry that it was a really short stream, guys.

3533
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:20,570
But honestly, I'm like really tired in general at the moment.

3534
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:24,190
I think it's also because like there was a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.

3535
02:18:24,590 --> 02:18:29,250
So I'm like mentally, my brain is just so exhausted at the moment.

3536
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:32,290
I might take a nap right now after this, after I end stream.

3537
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:35,010
But I still hope you guys had a really fun watching me play Hades 2.

3538
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:39,750
Being the many, the 877 subscribers.

3539
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:40,790
And the streamer you watched today.

3540
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:43,410
In the past week that played this game.

3541
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:46,110
Anyway, everybody.

3542
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:47,350
As always, everyone.

3543
02:18:47,610 --> 02:18:48,570
Stay hydrated.

3544
02:18:49,050 --> 02:18:49,650
Posture check.

3545
02:18:49,790 --> 02:18:51,630
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3546
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:53,650
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3547
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:55,090
Because you deserve it.

3548
02:18:55,230 --> 02:18:56,410
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3549
02:18:57,030 --> 02:18:57,750
Bye, guys.

3550
02:18:58,430 --> 02:18:58,830
Bye.
