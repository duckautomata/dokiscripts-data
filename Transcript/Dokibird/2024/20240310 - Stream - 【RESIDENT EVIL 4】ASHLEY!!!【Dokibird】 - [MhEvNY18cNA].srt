1
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,330
Hello, hello, Ashley is- Dude, what the fuck?

2
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,010
This is the first- Alright, guys.

3
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,810
That is the first thing I read today for my playthrough.

4
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,370
What do you mean?

5
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,010
I am a good babysitter!

6
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,850
For those who don't know, I've told this story before a long time ago.

7
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:21,630
But, um, I actually- I took a- I did an after school club where we learned how to be babysitters.

8
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,590
I've never done it before.

9
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,750
Like, I never took this practice into, like, reality.

10
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,110
But, like-

11
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,550
But, I paid ten dollars for this after school activity.

12
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:47,970
Because after- after the whole duration of this activity that we did after school, um, we had to take a test.

13
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,470
And then get a, uh, a babysitter.

14
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,530
Certificate.

15
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,650
So, I have a babysitter certificate.

16
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,450
Which proves that I am- I can be a good babysitter.

17
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,170
I've never babysat before.

18
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,250
Afterwards.

19
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,050
Like, afterwards, I may have never babysat.

20
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,430
But- But I do have a certificate.

21
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,690
So, that makes me more qualified than anybody else here.

22
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,610
Do you have a babysitter certificate?

23
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,410
I don't think so.

24
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,930
I paid ten dollars for this.

25
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,310
Okay.

26
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,970
I have- I- I don't know where it is.

27
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,690
Because I took this after school activity in middle school.

28
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,490
So, like, I don't even know where the fuck the babysitting certificate is anymore.

29
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,150
Um, no, thank you for the super chat.

30
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:45,770
Thank you, thank you.

31
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,410
Here's ten dollars for your expired certificate.

32
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,610
Um, Bacon, thank you.

33
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,910
Thank you for the Akasufa.

34
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,950
Thank you, thank you.

35
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,310
Ashley's beautiful.

36
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,490
Excuse me.

37
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,490
I know that, like, Ashley is in good hands.

38
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,050
Okay?

39
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,250
I won't like it.

40
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,470
But, like, I wouldn't- She's literally the president's daughter.

41
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,070
Like, why the fuck would I- Like, why would you think that I cannot do it?

42
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,150
I am certified, guys.

43
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,190
Also, speaking of.

44
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,130
Our clips didn't win the best clip.

45
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,510
Guys, you guys lied to me.

46
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,970
So, you know about our deal.

47
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,850
Wait.

48
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,450
I just want you guys to know.

49
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,850
None of our Apex clips won the best clips in the Apex tournament.

50
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,690
Because, apparently, unlike me when I said, don't raid her chat to vote.

51
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,670
Apparently.

52
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,910
Apparently.

53
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,550
Apparently.

54
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,050
Other streamers were campaigning to- To their communities to vote for their clips.

55
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,330
So, like, the clips that won were- People were like, what the fuck?

56
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,530
Look, guys.

57
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,210
No, no, no.

58
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,590
It's good that we didn't raid.

59
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,950
Because now- Because- Because then people would be- Because people would say we rigged it.

60
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,390
Okay?

61
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,930
Now, we're not the ones that rigged it, guys.

62
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,410
It's good.

63
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,890
Because then other people would have said we rigged it.

64
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,670
They would be like, of course the VTuber rigged the- The- The clip awards.

65
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,050
But we didn't.

66
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,350
So, we're good people.

67
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,210
We didn't.

68
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,790
So, we're good people.

69
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,270
We have dignity.

70
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,650
Also.

71
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,310
We also- You guys also promised me something.

72
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,770
I was like, if these clips don't win.

73
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,670
I swear to fucking God.

74
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,830
We are the good guys.

75
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,350
We are the good guys.

76
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,270
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

77
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,610
Thank you.

78
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,070
Thank you.

79
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,950
They have no taste in clips.

80
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,330
Shake my head.

81
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,570
Mara, Doki needs to strut her babysitting skills for Ashley tonight.

82
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,370
Thank you for the super chat.

83
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:08,790
Thank you.

84
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,110
Thank you.

85
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,430
We have the moral high ground.

86
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,130
Because I said no- No rigging.

87
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,590
We lost though.

88
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,770
Because I forgot.

89
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,750
I forgot about- It's like student union.

90
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,970
I'm starting a student council all over again.

91
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,850
People- People will campaign.

92
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,510
It's 1000 dollars.

93
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,370
I forgot about that.

94
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,290
I forgot.

95
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,250
If it's a popular vote.

96
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,490
People would campaign for it.

97
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:40,950
I forgot.

98
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,930
Just like politics.

99
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,110
Anyway.

100
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,310
Alright, here we go.

101
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,930
You know, Resident Evil 4, I've always wanted to...

102
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,730
Well, I've always wanted to finish this game, but like, obviously...

103
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,870
I don't want to go back and play all the way to the beginning.

104
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,090
Because of the original game.

105
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,770
Because like, that was like, a lot.

106
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,290
Because that would require me to...

107
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,170
To deal with OG Ashley.

108
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,410
Who has one of the worst fucking NPC pathways ever.

109
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,290
So...

110
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,170
So...

111
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,870
Because of my hatred of Ashley's NPC movements...

112
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,670
And escort missions...

113
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,470
I've decided to play the remake.

114
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,030
Because at least, I don't have to go through the original...

115
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,790
The original Ashley.

116
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,530
And instead, I can go through with remake Ashley.

117
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,150
Who apparently has better passing now.

118
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,070
So...

119
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:48,930
So...

120
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:50,850
So...

121
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,370
So...

122
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,210
I decided...

123
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,050
For the sake of my sanity...

124
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,710
And not redoing the entire fucking 70% of the game...

125
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,570
I decided to do the remake.

126
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,290
Because at least, like...

127
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,710
It'll still be new to me.

128
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,010
And the pathing would not be as bad.

129
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,370
Like, I don't know.

130
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,730
I just feel like Ashley 2.0 was the way to go.

131
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,050
Alright, here we go.

132
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,310
Okay, adjust the pat...

133
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,890
Until the pat...

134
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,750
Where is the pattern?

135
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,130
Holy shit!

136
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,510
Why is it so bright automatically?

137
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,070
Okay.

138
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,190
Why is it like maxed out?

139
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,790
Um...

140
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,330
DDragon, thank you for the super chat.

141
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:29,990
Thank you, thank you.

142
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,110
If you hate Ashley in any Resident Evil 4, then it's a little skill issue.

143
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,270
Thank you for the super chat.

144
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,190
Thank you, thank you.

145
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,250
I won't say I hate her.

147
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,350
I just...

148
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,810
I just don't want her to exist.

149
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,110
That's...

150
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,570
That's different.

151
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,370
Alright.

152
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,730
Let's see.

153
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,850
Adjust until the pattern is just barely visible.

154
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,770
Okay.

155
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,310
Then I guess...

156
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,450
This?

157
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,290
There we go.

158
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,950
Uh...

159
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,930
Here we go.

160
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,730
Uh...

161
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,950
Adjust under...

162
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,750
Until the image in the center is barely visible.

163
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,850
If the image remains visible, please check your...

164
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,210
Okay.

165
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,230
Just until it is...

166
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,710
Barely...

167
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,790
Okay.

168
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,030
Oh my god.

169
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,790
If I make it so fucking bright, then like it won't be scary anymore.

170
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,530
I'm just saying.

171
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,710
If it's this bright, then like it's not a horror game.

172
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,550
It's just survival.

173
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,990
It's just action.

174
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,330
I can't be scared.

175
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,290
Because no monster is going to show up when it's bright.

176
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,330
Like that's typical horror.

177
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,190
Sassy, thank you for the super chat.

178
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,530
Thank you.

179
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:42,770
Thank you.

180
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,990
We all agree with you.

181
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,370
Nobody likes Ashley in OG Resident Evil 4.

182
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,230
Okay.

183
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,710
Let's see.

184
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,710
I think this is fine.

185
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,150
We'll just make it a little brighter.

186
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,410
Just a...

187
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,610
Just a little bit.

188
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,730
Defying the set.

189
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,210
Okay.

190
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:56,890
Nice.

191
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,270
Adjust the...

192
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,870
I think that's good?

193
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,010
Uh...

194
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,590
Let's see.

195
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,510
Why?

196
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,490
Okay.

197
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,410
I have to pretend to read it.

198
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:08,790
Okay.

199
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,070
Uh...

200
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,450
Whoop.

201
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,910
I did it.

202
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,450
I do not consent.

203
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,750
Okay.

204
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,350
I do not have a Cap...

205
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,510
Do I have a Capcom ID?

206
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,410
If you do not have a Capcom that has been linked to the platform ID that you can check, please select I do not have a...

207
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,950
What the fuck is it?

208
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,210
Okay.

209
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,010
I should have read this.

210
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,110
Uh...

211
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,130
In the company's account service Capcom ID.

212
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,390
Why does every game have an account now?

213
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,490
Like...

214
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,050
Read the...

215
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,250
It's over.

216
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,430
She's not reading the terms of service.

217
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,450
Uh...

218
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,210
No!

219
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,850
Okay.

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm going to...

221
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,330
Um...

222
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,210
All right.

223
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,710
Guys.

224
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,830
What is the Capcom ID?

225
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,070
Do I...

226
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,930
No idea but I hate it?

227
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,230
Okay.

228
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,070
I don't think I have one.

229
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,050
I'm just going to hide the screen just in case like it requires like personal information.

230
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:58,630
I'll just write.

231
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,490
I don't have one.

232
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,410
Your play data can be viewed on...

233
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,890
Why do I need my play data?

234
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,510
They will be sent to the REnet whenever you select quick game from the pause.

235
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,610
Why don't...

236
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,410
The game has an autosave feature.

237
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,030
Okay.

238
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,630
Oh, it doesn't matter.

239
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:12,750
I'm going to...

240
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:12,850
Okay.

241
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,050
All right.

242
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,370
That's cool.

243
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,810
I love it when things don't matter.

244
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,790
All right.

245
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,770
So Capcom ID does not matter, guys.

246
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,650
That's what we learned.

247
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,290
All right.

248
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:23,810
Start game.

249
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,710
Ooh.

250
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,090
Loud.

251
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,130
A new extra game is available to download mercenaries.

252
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,710
Oh, but it's free.

253
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:31,990
No.

254
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,990
Do I need it?

255
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,270
I don't really care.

256
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:34,890
Wait.

257
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,270
Can I like buy skins for Leon online store?

258
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,350
Yes.

259
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,470
This is...

260
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,750
This is...

261
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,950
What the...

262
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,570
All right.

263
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,310
Cosmetics.

264
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,850
All right.

265
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,350
Let's see.

266
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,330
What the fuck is this bundle?

267
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,430
Oh my God.

268
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:51,630
Wait.

269
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,490
There is.

270
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,670
Leon and Ashley.

271
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,150
Okay.

272
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,670
Guys.

273
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,070
Do we need to be immersed?

274
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,590
I just need...

275
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,530
How much...

276
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,550
How much immersion do you guys want?

277
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,390
Like this is very important to how this game is going to be.

278
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,730
How much immersion do you guys want?

279
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,050
What do you mean by that?

280
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,630
I mean, I'm looking at the cosmetics right now.

281
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,590
This is a very important question.

282
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,070
Do you want immersion or...

283
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:25,250
Okay.

284
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:25,790
You guys want...

285
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,950
Okay.

286
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,030
I won't buy anything then.

287
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,110
100.

288
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,350
Thank you for the magenta soup.

289
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,890
Thank you.

290
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,390
Thank you.

291
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,690
The nyanya clip is number one in my mind.

292
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,510
Yeah.

293
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,150
But it's not a winning clip.

294
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,510
All right.

295
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,290
All right, guys.

296
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:38,890
Fine.

297
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:39,770
Fine.

298
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,550
We won't buy any of the...

299
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,730
Oh, my God.

300
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,710
I'm gonna buy all the Leon costumes.

301
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,170
There's literally one where...

302
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,390
Wait.

303
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,350
Is this one where he's like Baldur's Gate-esque?

304
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,130
There's one where you can see his chest.

305
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,110
Guys, it's tempting.

306
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,510
Guys.

307
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,710
I don't know.

308
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,170
Check out.

309
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,650
Guys.

310
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,730
There's a 25% off from the...

311
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,290
Come on!

312
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,390
Wait, is this like goth?

313
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,890
What the fuck?

314
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,390
There's a goth Ashley?

315
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,570
Okay guys, but there's like goth Ashley though.

316
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,510
Actually, you know what?

317
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,350
You know what?

318
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,910
I'm getting the goth Ashley.

319
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,690
We're getting that because no matter what, we don't really care about what Ashley looks like.

320
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,770
So might as well enjoy the ride.

321
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,070
Enjoy the ride of Ashley being goth.

322
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,870
It makes sense why she's like in this village.

323
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,190
Like she wanted to get away from the president.

324
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,530
Like her dad.

325
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,150
Alright, I won't make Leon immersive.

326
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,990
Because this other skin, he doesn't really look like Leon.

327
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,250
He's just like... it's just bald...

328
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,650
You know that vampire dude that everybody likes in Baldur's Gate?

329
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,670
Like he basically looks like this.

330
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,030
And like...

331
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,290
This might be a super hot take.

332
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,790
But I really don't care about that guy.

333
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,150
I don't really give a fuck about...

334
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,290
I don't even know his name.

335
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,570
So like...

336
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,410
I think it might be a super hot take.

337
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,250
Because like...

338
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,410
I swear everybody's obsessed over him.

339
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,430
I think it's the accent.

340
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,710
I honestly think it's not what he looks like.

341
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,670
It's literally like the accent.

342
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,290
It's always the accent.

343
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,330
Okay, I need to restart the game.

344
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,050
Alright, don't worry.

345
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,770
We're putting Goth Ashley in here.

346
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,230
Data, close the game please.

347
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,810
Zachary, thank you for the super chat.

348
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,090
Thank you.

349
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,670
Make this have all the cheese possible.

350
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,830
Alright guys, I am restarting this real fast guys.

351
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,330
Just to make sure...

352
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,910
Just to make sure we have what we want.

353
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,210
Alright, Resident Evil 4.

354
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,010
Alright.

355
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,030
I swear, it's mostly like...

356
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,450
It's like Tumblr guy.

357
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,190
He's the new Tumblr guy.

358
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,870
And there's always a pattern with Tumblr guys.

359
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,530
Like the sexy man Tumblr guys.

360
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,210
They usually have a British accent.

361
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,570
Alright.

362
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,710
Obtain costumes.

363
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,890
I already missed one.

364
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,290
Oh, gee.

365
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,650
Guys, I know there's people who did not like Ashley's newest costume.

366
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,190
Like the remake costume.

367
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,450
Don't pretend.

368
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,270
Here we go.

369
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,790
Alright, we're gonna make Ashley...

370
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,890
Oh my...

371
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,010
I like how this is casual Ashley.

372
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,050
Like this is what she wears casually.

373
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,070
Alright.

374
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,310
This is gonna be Ashley now.

375
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,330
Can I confirm this?

376
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,770
Alright, let's see.

377
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,950
How do I confirm that this is my Ashley?

378
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,250
This is...

379
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,690
Oh, I guess it's like scene... scene girl.

380
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,090
It's more like scene girl punk Ashley.

381
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,570
Alright, and then...

382
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,330
Can I confirm?

383
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,370
Can I confirm her?

384
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,410
Um...

385
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,310
Hahaha.

386
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,070
Alright, let's see.

387
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,450
I mean, it'll make me feel less bad about her like getting kidnapped.

388
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:42,910
Uh...

389
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,490
Wrong menu?

390
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,470
Wait, how do I...

391
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,970
How do I make her my Ashley?

392
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,490
This is my Ashley now.

393
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,310
I don't want to rescue...

394
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,410
Oh, when I start the game?

395
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,930
Okay.

396
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,470
You can now change...

397
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,350
Oh, here it is!

398
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,950
The Ashley fun.

399
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,690
Joy, thank you for the super chat.

400
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,050
Thank you.

401
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,630
Thank you.

402
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,950
Look, just remember.

403
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,930
Joy wanted this.

404
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,410
Joy wanted this, guys.

405
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,950
Hahaha.

406
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,470
Okay.

407
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,250
Yeah, this is...

408
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,870
My Ashley.

409
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,850
Oh, no.

410
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,070
Hot topic content.

411
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,310
Ashley's wardrobe.

412
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,610
Thank you for the super chat, JL.

413
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,130
Thank you.

414
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,730
Thank you.

415
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,810
This is...

416
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,170
This is our Ashley now.

417
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:28,830
Hahaha.

418
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,790
We all paid for this.

419
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,110
Ashley, default, please.

420
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,230
It's too late.

421
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,450
It's too late.

422
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,790
I paid money for this, Ashley.

423
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,890
Please, I beg you.

424
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,590
Guys, it'll make us feel bad when she dies.

425
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,710
Guys, we're...

426
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,290
There's a reason why I paid for this, Ashley.

427
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,110
So I feel less guilt.

428
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,190
Okay?

429
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,230
So I feel less guilt.

430
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,910
What the fuck is this jacket, though?

431
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,270
Okay.

432
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,790
Here we go.

433
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,590
We're fine.

434
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,510
Alright, new game.

435
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:10,070
I'm not doing hard- because this is survival and the thing I hate the most about survival horror is the ammo consumption.

436
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:16,510
So like, I've decided that like, I do not like trying to find ammo.

437
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,630
I really hate finding ammo.

438
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,790
I hate item management.

439
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,810
No, I've always told you guys.

440
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,790
I hate item management the most.

441
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,990
Out of difficulties.

442
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,330
What do you mean?

443
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,250
I hear the game perfectly fine.

444
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,510
They just chopped the guy's head off.

445
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,330
Where is the sound?

446
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,550
Okay, audio though, raise it up.

447
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,310
Thanks to the bio weapons created by Umbrella.

448
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,670
Somehow I made it out, but too many others weren't so lucky.

449
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,650
Oh no.

450
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,070
I was asked later to join a top secret government program.

451
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,850
Is that better now guys?

452
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,910
Not that I had a choice.

453
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,870
That's right.

454
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,490
You never have a choice.

455
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,470
Punishing missions nearly killed me.

456
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,530
At least I kept my mind off everything.

457
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,710
Sam, why aren't you buff?

458
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,530
You look like Captain America.

459
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,830
Pre-Captain America.

460
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,020
Hey, looks like a happy time Leon.

461
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,300
Don't worry.

462
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,400
Surely nothing bad is going to happen in a Resident Evil game.

463
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
That's not my Ashley.

464
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
But who the fuck is this girl?

465
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,660
Who is she?

466
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:56,860
Who is she?

467
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
Who is she?

468
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,200
Who is she?

469
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,360
Not my Ashley.

470
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,060
Oh wait, sound guy is here.

471
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,060
Sound guy, what do you think?

472
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,800
Maybe you did.

473
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,400
You have a strange sense of humor.

474
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,220
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

475
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,100
Just between us.

476
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,560
A lot of people have gone missing around here.

477
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
And it's been that way for a while now.

478
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,200
Should be just another day in the office, right?

479
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,000
Hmm.

480
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
I mean last week there was a search for some missing hikers.

481
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm sure you're- Missing hikers?

482
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,900
Look, the hikers are not important.

483
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,440
Are they the president's daughter?

484
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,020
I don't think so.

485
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

486
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,020
Ashley is like worth 20 missing hikers.

487
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

488
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,890
The president's missing hiker.

489
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,490
The hiking guide.

490
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:25,010
Okay, hiking- The president's hiking guide is worth like half an Ashley.

491
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,850
The president needs to hike.

492
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,170
I'll boost it up a little.

493
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,270
Bro.

494
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,170
Are you watching him pee?

495
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,430
I can't get in there.

496
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,430
That's fucked up.

497
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,850
Oh.

498
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,430
Oh, bro.

499
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,710
Did you pee on a corpse?

500
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,910
Bro.

501
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,310
We are too- No, not me.

502
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:13,890
I looked away.

503
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,730
I respect a man's privacy if he needs to pee.

504
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,650
He sure is taking his time.

505
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,350
Did he fall in?

506
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,180
Better go and take a look.

507
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:33,990
Yes.

508
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,830
You, Leon.

509
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,290
You should go look instead of me.

510
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,850
Ha ha ha ha ha.

511
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,450
Yes.

512
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,870
The guy that doesn't know this place.

513
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,370
You go on first.

514
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,540
I know.

515
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,480
He's in the forest.

516
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,420
Fall into what exactly?

517
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:53,920
Oh, wait.

518
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,520
I can move now.

519
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,920
Chapter one.

520
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,560
Ooh.

521
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,120
Okay.

522
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,440
You now change colored costumes and accessories in the extras.

523
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,240
All right.

524
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
Let's look at the sound.

525
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,420
The audio.

526
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,020
Okay.

527
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,820
Voice volume.

528
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,380
All right.

529
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,780
Voice is already boosted up.

530
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,080
Okay.

531
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,360
That's unfortunate.

532
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,080
Ha ha ha ha ha.

533
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
All right.

534
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:26,740
I'll lower like BGM and like sound effects and then boost up the regular volume a little bit more.

535
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,680
I don't know if sound guy is still up.

536
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
I don't know if sound guy is still here.

537
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,500
But I think that's gonna work.

538
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,700
Okay.

539
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,640
Graphics.

540
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,600
Uh, let's see.

541
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,080
Performance display.

542
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,540
I need to get... if there is motion blur, I need to get that shit off.

543
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,180
Uh, is there motion blur in this game, guys?

544
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,160
Okay.

545
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,260
Camera wobble.

546
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,020
God, no.

547
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,820
Turn the camera wobble for character movement.

548
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,220
No.

549
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,480
I hate that.

550
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,500
No camera.

551
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,440
Oh, okay.

552
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,500
Mouse sensitivity.

553
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,940
I'm gonna turn that.

554
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,300
Low already.

555
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,460
Uh, detail aim when aiming.

556
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,160
Okay.

557
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,600
Controls.

558
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,340
Is it in graphics?

559
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:11,860
Where?

560
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,500
Full HD performance.

561
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,280
Well, there's... that's it.

562
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,680
Oh, wait.

563
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,200
There it is.

564
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,600
Okay.

565
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,020
I just need to scroll.

566
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,360
Okay.

567
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,280
Motion blur off.

568
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,760
All right, guys.

569
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,080
Sorry.

570
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,180
Technical stuff right now to make this a good experience for all of us.

571
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,700
Uh, shadow.

572
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,520
You know what?

573
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:29,900
We're fine.

574
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,680
Let's just hope our PC can handle this.

575
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,520
I swear to God.

576
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm gonna go to the computer.

577
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Oh, my God.

578
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,100
All right.

579
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,920
We should be good.

580
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,340
All right.

581
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,840
Did it save?

582
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh, subtitle size.

583
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,420
Large.

584
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,740
Because we're blind as fuck.

585
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
Uh, I'm just gonna make sure everything's saved.

586
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,300
Motion blur off.

587
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:47,840
There we go.

588
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,080
Oh, is the FPS capped?

589
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,020
No, we don't need that.

590
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,100
Okay.

591
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,720
All right.

592
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,140
That's good.

593
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:55,980
Oh!

594
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,260
I don't like that.

595
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,020
I should...

596
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,340
I knew I should have fucking made this brighter.

597
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,380
Thank you, Super Chat.

598
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:03,740
Thank you.

599
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,340
Thank you.

600
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,520
Chapter one to watch a Doki bird.

601
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,760
I knew it.

602
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,000
I knew I should have made the fucking screen brighter.

603
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,100
Oh, this is way too dark.

604
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,240
I don't like this.

605
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't fucking like this.

606
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,580
Ashley, where are you?

607
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,320
They really do.

608
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,800
I don't understand why they put motion blur in games.

609
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,700
Yeah, I'm reaching for the Super Chat.

610
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,020
Thank you.

611
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,460
Thank you.

612
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,640
I guess it's for like console to hide.

613
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,200
I don't like the low frames and stuff, but like, that should be off on default.

614
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,700
Oh, hey, there's a deer.

615
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,200
Free food.

616
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,190
Oh, okay.

617
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,650
That's it.

618
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,790
All right.

619
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,110
I'll pack one for the ride.

620
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,830
Oh, crouch is E?

621
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,050
What the fuck is controller?

622
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,490
Okay.

623
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,050
What the fuck?

624
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,310
Okay.

625
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,230
I need to know what is controller.

626
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,790
Control...

627
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,010
Command Ashley!

628
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,870
Okay, we're gonna put this as control and command Ashley is E.

629
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,970
Okay, I swear is there another control?

630
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,170
Toggle HUD.

631
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,470
What?

632
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,030
Okay, that's on the menu.

633
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,450
Okay.

634
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,290
Mayhem mode?

635
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,470
What?

636
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,410
What the fuck is mayhem mode?

637
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,910
Okay, I guess...

638
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,630
Well, I guess...

639
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,030
Apparently, this is very important.

640
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:48,250
So I guess... I guess we'll put this back to here because it conflicts with mayhem mode.

641
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,730
Whatever the fuck mayhem mode is.

642
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,950
Oh, it's mercenaries only?

643
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,770
Okay.

644
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:55,330
Yeah.

645
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,890
Okay back to...

646
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,010
We're gonna change that back then because that's dumb.

647
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,490
I can't I cannot handle it.

648
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,910
I can't... Ashley does not deserve this at that point.

649
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,650
Ashley...

650
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,330
Ashley, you are not important enough for this.

651
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,750
Where is it?

652
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,270
Where... where the fuck is it?

653
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,550
Where's the... where's control Ashley?

654
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,390
Where are you?

655
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,790
Confirm menu reset.

656
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,150
Zoom mayhem mode.

657
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,610
Where the fuck did Ashley go?

658
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,490
I went past it.

659
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,050
Okay, Ashley control...

660
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,350
Command Ashley.

661
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:38,910
There you go.

662
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,930
Command Ashley.

663
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:46,170
Okay, you're gonna be E and then you're gonna be control because that is dumb as fuck.

664
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,070
Okay, there you go.

665
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,730
There you go.

666
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,450
Control E crouch stand and evade.

667
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,230
Evade?

668
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,830
You have been bound to the same action return without applying...

669
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,390
God, oh God!

670
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,590
Can I just get rid of this?

671
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,890
Oh, shit.

672
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,530
Oh shit.

673
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,470
Uh... delete.

674
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,490
...

675
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,290
Where is my delete button?

676
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:12,750
Fuck!

677
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,650
Okay, I need to grab my other keyboard!

678
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,190
I apparently don't have a delete button on my fucking 60%.

679
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,150
Do I have a delete button on this one?

680
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,630
Where the fuck is delete?ما Alright!

681
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,650
Where's my other keyboard?

682
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,770
I don't have a delete button on this keyboard too?

683
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,150
This is a mess.

684
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:36,990
Okay.

685
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,350
It's a... guys I don't have a delete...

686
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,790
Guys!

687
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,330
I don't have a keyboard that has a delete button!

688
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,010
This is so bad!

689
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,150
Okay, this is awkward.

690
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,130
We'll just make this E.

691
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,110
That should be fine.

692
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,170
Alright, good.

693
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,910
You guys are smart.

694
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,390
This is why I have you guys here.

695
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,710
You can make decisions for me.

696
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,430
Alright.

697
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,610
We should be fine.

698
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,490
Good.

699
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,950
Okay, now we can crouch.

700
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,490
Good.

701
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,090
Oh, thank god.

702
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,990
We're figuring this out together.

703
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,630
Alright.

704
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,610
Knock knock!

705
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,490
Hello?

706
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,650
Are you in here?

707
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,610
Police officer?

708
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,450
Were you trying to find the toilet?

709
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,470
Even though we saw you pee outside?

710
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,750
Oh, I don't like this.

711
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,870
Oh, I don't like this.

712
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,690
Oh!

713
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,810
I do not like this at all.

714
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,190
Oh!

715
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,830
Yay.

716
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,070
Ummm...

717
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,290
Ummm...

718
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,230
We'll just go through the first door.

719
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,550
Hello, sorry for barging in.

720
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,550
But I'm a cop.

721
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,950
Is there anything I can steal?

722
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,130
Is there anything I can steal?

723
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,950
I mean, not steal.

724
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,490
Borrow.

725
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,990
What's this?

726
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,670
Judgment is nigh.

727
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,190
Crude charm.

728
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,630
Okay.

729
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,630
Obtain file.

730
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,310
Don't worry.

731
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,630
A cop would never steal.

732
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,570
We're here to borrow.

733
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,850
We'll return things eventually.

734
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,750
That's what the taxpayers money is for!

735
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,610
We'll pay you back with your own taxes!

736
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,210
We'll pay you back with your own taxes!

737
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,290
We'll pay you back with your own taxes!

738
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,430
Oh...

739
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,490
When the time...

740
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,470
Never mind.

741
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,350
I do miss OG.

742
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,530
I miss OG Resident Evil now.

743
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,570
I wish this was the OG Resident Evil 4.

744
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,050
This was less scary back in the original.

745
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,930
The graphics made it silly.

746
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,410
Oh!

747
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,530
Bro, are you okay?

748
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,280
Sorry to barge in like this.

749
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,880
Bro, you okay, sir?

750
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,620
Those eyes don't look healthy.

751
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,380
Those eyes don't look healthy.

752
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,960
What are you doing in your own house?

753
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,040
What are you doing in your own house?

754
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,640
Wait, that's him.

755
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,120
That's Mario.

756
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,840
That's Mario!

757
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,660
Sir!

758
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,050
What are you doing in your own house?

759
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,550
Oh, fuck.

760
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,090
Okay.

761
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,550
Self-defense.

762
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,190
They can't arrest me.

763
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,050
It's self-defense.

764
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,690
It's not my fault.

765
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,110
It's not my fault, guys.

766
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,790
He attacked me in his own house.

767
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,770
So I...

768
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,770
He attacked me in his own house.

769
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:04,930
And...

770
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,170
It's self-defense.

771
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,090
Even though it's his house.

772
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,430
Just remember.

773
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,190
Okay, can I keep this?

774
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:15,950
Ooh.

775
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,550
Is that cat?

776
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,190
What the fuck?

777
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,550
Okay, we have a key here.

778
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,870
Oh, we can't go this way anymore.

779
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,470
Wait, did he lock the door?

780
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,730
Just let me move.

781
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,390
Move the fucking wood.

782
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,760
Oh wait, no.

783
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,660
This is the door.

784
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,180
Whoops.

785
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,140
Oh, why did this get scarier?

786
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:46,970
Hello.

787
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,810
Oh no.

788
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,030
This is a cult.

789
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,850
This is a cult.

790
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,450
Oh no.

791
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,970
Oh no.

792
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:57,530
Ooh.

793
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,790
Sensitivity is way too low.

794
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,730
Let me move up the sense a little bit higher.

795
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,470
Where's the sense?

796
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,210
When aiming.

797
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:06,950
Okay.

798
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,010
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

799
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:10,830
Okay, nevermind.

800
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,350
This was better.

801
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,370
The original.

802
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,350
They knew what I liked.

803
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,210
Alright.

804
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,710
Hello?

805
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,170
Ooh.

806
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:18,990
Rats.

807
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,870
Where's the guy that he killed?

808
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:23,890
Hello?

809
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,170
Hello?

810
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,970
This is not a home invasion.

811
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,890
I have my rights.

812
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,100
MicroDrive.

813
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,940
Thank you for the super chat.

814
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,240
Thank you.

815
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,760
Thank you.

816
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,480
Breaking news.

817
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,460
VTuber Tomato Doki Berry breaks into house and kills...

818
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,780
No!

819
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
Self-defense!

820
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,380
I legally entered his home!

821
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,980
I read you.

822
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,080
What's your situation?

823
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,180
What's your situation?

824
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,560
Leon, I don't think he's okay.

825
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,180
Leon, I don't think he's okay.

826
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,800
I don't know.

827
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,560
That sounded... He sounded very scared.

828
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,220
I don't know.

829
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,220
That sounded...

830
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,220
He sounded very scared.

831
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,740
Oh no.

832
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,280
Escape from the hunter's lodge.

833
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:09,680
Oh no.

834
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Escape from the hunter's lodge.

835
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,400
Okay.

836
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,720
Oh, I can shoot now.

837
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,560
Oh, I don't like this.

838
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,060
Oh, I don't like this.

839
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,220
Okay.

840
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,120
If I have my gun now, I'll be ready for anything.

841
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,020
Hello?

842
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,760
Hello?

843
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,620
I'm legally allowed to shoot you if you scare me.

844
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:33,840
Oh!

845
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,600
No fucking way.

846
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,320
How do you headshot if he has no head...

847
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,040
If his head is already...

848
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,130
What?

849
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,500
How do you headshot if his head is already off?

850
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
How do you headshot if his head is already off?

851
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:05,800
How do you headshot if his head is already off?

852
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,480
Oh no.

853
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh no.

854
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,780
How do I...

855
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,180
How do I knife?

856
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,700
Okay.

857
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

858
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,380
Okay, space bar.

859
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,260
Space bar is knife when they get too close.

860
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,000
When they get too close.

861
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
Space bar is knife.

862
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,700
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

863
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,340
Okay, there you go.

864
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,560
I just need to get my reflexes going on here.

865
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,800
Okay.

866
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:26,860
Alright.

867
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,920
Okay.

868
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,560
Alright.

869
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
There's a guy right there.

870
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,700
Maybe he's gonna walk back.

871
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,220
Sir?

872
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,120
Are you gonna walk back?

873
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,500
Sir?

874
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,660
Can you walk back so I have a longer...

875
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,480
So I don't have to turn around?

876
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,380
Oh no.

877
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,900
Fuck.

878
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,260
Okay.

879
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,120
Sir!

880
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,240
Please!

881
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,360
Please walk back!

882
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,090
Do I go up?

883
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,390
Guess I go up.

884
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,550
I don't know.

885
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,710
Maybe there's stuff up here.

886
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,490
I know this is not...

887
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,630
considered getting out, but maybe there's...

888
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,250
stuff here.

889
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,080
What the fuck?

890
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,760
What's this?

891
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,640
Also, how's the volume so far?

892
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,980
Yeah, escape by going up.

893
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah, escape by going up.

894
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,960
Okay, so it makes sense.

895
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,260
This is Gondor One.

896
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,180
Hunnigan here.

897
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,920
What's your sitrep?

898
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,320
President's daughter, Baby Eagle.

899
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,480
It's likely she's in this village.

900
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,340
Our intel was correct then.

901
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,100
Well done.

902
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,800
Need a location on a nearby lake.

903
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,420
She may have been taken there.

904
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,500
Copy that.

905
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,000
I'll see what I can find.

906
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,300
Where is the president's daughter?

907
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,400
Please!

908
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,260
Dad wants to apologize for saying it's a phase!

909
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:00,520
Dad wants to apologize for saying it's a phase!

910
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,680
Oh no.

911
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,380
How does this game get harder now?

912
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,060
Oh, that is way too many people!

913
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,520
Oh, thank god!

914
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't have to shoot them.

915
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,780
Okay, I'm out of the house.

916
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Now they have no legal rights to kill me.

917
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,840
Because I'm not doing a home invasion anymore.

918
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,520
I have my rights.

919
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,260
I'm not in this house anymore.

920
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,500
So now, the only thing I can do is...

921
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
They can't kill me!

922
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,460
Because I'm not breaking any rules!

923
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,500
I'm not trespassing!

924
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:51,840
Exactly!

925
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,280
I'm not trespassing anymore.

926
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,640
Alright.

927
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,660
I'm so scared.

928
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,140
I'm so scared.

929
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,300
I'm getting so scared.

930
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,440
Okay.

931
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,960
Hello?

932
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,140
Is anybody here?

933
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,400
Does anyone have spirit?

934
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:11,660
Do you have your ammo?

935
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,740
Ooh!

936
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,120
Ask and you shall receive.

937
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,060
Nice.

938
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,060
I knew it!

939
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,660
I knew somebody kept ammo somewhere.

940
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,760
You win this time!

941
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,540
Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

942
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,340
Thank you, thank you.

943
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,960
Oh my god!

944
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,860
They painted it yellow!

945
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,040
For stupid people like me!

946
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
You guys didn't know.

947
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,740
Early on in game testers...

948
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,780
People wouldn't do anything with the barrels...

949
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,980
until you painted it yellow.

950
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,940
And then people realized... wow!

951
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,160
Wow!

952
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,000
Yellow means I can break it!

953
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,900
We can customize my case?

954
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:49,940
Aww!

955
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,640
I only have one case.

956
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,620
Okay, nice.

957
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,060
Alright.

958
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,500
My knife is like...

959
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,920
so fucked up though.

960
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,700
Can we use to craft ammo?

961
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,640
Okay, craft.

962
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,280
I don't have enough.

963
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,380
Okay.

964
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,780
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

965
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,720
Thank you, thank you.

966
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,660
Freedom America!

967
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,000
Woo!

968
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Baby!

969
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,540
Super chat sent by a real American.

970
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,780
Real.

971
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,380
Okay.

972
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,400
Wait.

973
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,420
Did I just go backwards?

974
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,720
I did.

975
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,360
Thank you for the super chat.

976
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,600
Thank you.

977
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,220
Save 10 bucks each time my dumb ass co-worker said something stupid out of pocket.

978
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,540
Decide part of it should go to the best tomato round.

979
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,140
Thanks for everything.

980
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,760
Thank you.

981
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,080
Thank you.

982
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,820
Thank you for the acasupa.

983
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,400
Thank you.

984
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
I really appreciate it.

985
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,300
I hear some angry Spanish to my right.

986
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,800
Should I go left?

987
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,800
No!

988
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,240
Dog!

989
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,440
That's a waste of good food.

990
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,240
I don't think I want to go to the right right now.

991
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,100
I'm scared.

992
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,220
Oh, more ammo.

993
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,840
Nice.

994
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,160
More ammo for me to whiff.

995
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,840
Okay.

996
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,360
Crouch.

997
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,880
Nice.

998
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,480
Thank god.

999
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,380
Oh.

1000
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,960
Oh.

1001
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,840
Hello?

1002
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,040
Anybody?

1003
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,520
I will shoot!

1004
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,420
Wait.

1005
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,640
Wait.

1006
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:17,860
Wait.

1007
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,420
Yes!

1008
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,420
Yes!

1009
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,960
I did say I would shoot!

1010
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,920
Give me a sec!

1011
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,620
I said I would shoot!

1012
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
I said self-defense!

1013
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,240
Here we go.

1014
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,520
Wait.

1015
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:36,780
What?

1016
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,220
Wait a minute.

1017
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,660
He's not dying.

1018
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,720
He's not dying!

1019
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,600
What is this?

1020
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,560
Okay.

1021
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,180
That is a waste of ammo.

1022
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,160
Okay.

1023
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,740
So when they are human...

1024
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,220
When they are human...

1025
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,140
I shoot the head!

1026
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
And then when they become...

1027
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,140
Whatever the fuck that was...

1028
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,160
I shoot the knees.

1029
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,800
Okay.

1030
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,220
That's good.

1031
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,280
That's good.

1032
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,840
Ice skating style.

1033
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,780
You understand that reference?

1034
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,340
I don't even know if I can say that.

1035
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,260
I'm not...

1036
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,800
Thank you for the 20 gifted chips.

1037
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,760
Thank you.

1038
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,460
Thank you.

1039
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,960
Okay.

1040
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,120
What the fuck?

1041
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,860
What the fuck?

1042
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,280
What the fuck?

1043
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,600
No!

1044
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,790
Okay.

1045
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,870
I was like right in front of it for so long.

1046
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,970
Not to look at bear trap.

1047
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,170
Bear trap?

1048
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,410
Bear trap?

1049
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:44,410
Okay.

1050
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,430
Okay.

1051
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,270
I hate this.

1052
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,570
Alright.

1053
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,170
I need to heal.

1054
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:50,930
Okay.

1055
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,670
Flash grenades.

1056
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:53,930
Alright.

1057
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,270
Okay.

1058
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,410
Let's see.

1059
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,670
Oh fuck.

1060
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,110
Okay.

1061
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,030
You can set your weapon to a shortcut.

1062
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,130
Good thing we don't have anything else right now.

1063
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,130
Good thing we don't have anything else right now.

1064
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,390
Her... Her gun... It cannot be used by itself.

1065
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:08,810
Well.

1066
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,370
Do I heal?

1067
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,210
What's my HP?

1068
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,990
How fucked am I?

1069
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,950
Okay guys.

1070
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,970
What is my HP right now?

1071
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,290
I can't tell.

1072
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,170
Oh there it is.

1073
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,790
I'm half HP.

1074
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,890
It's okay Leon.

1075
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,270
If you're half HP you can survive.

1076
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,190
American healthcare is still very expensive.

1077
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,170
We gotta give you...

1078
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,270
We gotta give you medicine when you're just about to die.

1079
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:37,670
Alright.

1080
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,480
Okay.

1081
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,660
Knock knock.

1082
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,260
Knock knock.

1083
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,100
Hello?

1084
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,300
Don't worry.

1085
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,560
The fuck is that?

1086
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,840
A head?

1087
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,860
Oh that is a head.

1088
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,980
Don't worry.

1089
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,400
The spray bottles can heal a broken leg.

1090
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh.

1091
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,420
Remember when I like...

1092
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,380
was so fucking stupid and killed everybody?

1093
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,600
In this town?

1094
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,340
I wasn't supposed to kill everybody?

1095
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,000
Alright.

1096
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,900
And wasted all that ammo?

1097
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,890
Alright.

1098
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,060
We can do that again.

1099
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,300
It would.

1100
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,100
It wouldn't hurt to do that again right?

1101
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,160
Hello.

1102
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,450
Okay.

1103
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,340
There is the police officer.

1104
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,320
Oh shit.

1105
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,700
That sucks bro.

1106
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,000
That fucking sucks.

1107
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,660
Wait can I put him out of his misery?

1108
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,480
Don't worry!

1109
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,320
Don't worry!

1110
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,320
I'll put you- oh he's dead.

1111
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,940
Sorry I was a bit too late.

1112
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,040
Sorry.

1113
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,600
I could- sorry I watched a little bit too long.

1114
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,620
I could have shot you first before all of that.

1115
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,000
Alright.

1116
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,040
There was an attempt.

1117
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,540
Yes.

1118
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't know.

1119
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,160
Maybe I should just kill them all.

1120
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,380
You know what guys?

1121
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,120
I think I can kill all of them.

1122
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:18,880
Guys?

1123
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,340
No I have ten bullets.

1124
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:21,960
Nevermind.

1125
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,460
I just realized how much ammo I have.

1126
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,540
Um.

1127
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,400
Shit.

1128
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:25,760
Okay.

1129
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,020
Can I just run back?

1130
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,320
Okay.

1131
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,200
Alright here we go.

1132
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,340
Sneak around first?

1133
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,280
Guys do you think they will see me if I just walk like this?

1134
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,460
Nah.

1135
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,600
Oh wait.

1136
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,400
No they won't.

1137
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,880
Oh my gosh you're right.

1138
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,280
Wait what's this?

1139
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,580
Oh that requires Ashley.

1140
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,500
Wait there's grass here.

1141
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,860
I'll get my grass real fast.

1142
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,700
This.

1143
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,380
They won't know.

1144
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:10,830
Wait.

1145
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,330
There she is.

1146
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,630
Hello there granny.

1147
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,030
I'm here to take you to a better home.

1148
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:22,930
You'll be okay.

1149
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,650
Don't worry.

1150
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,610
You're just going to go to a farm downstate.

1151
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,010
She's okay.

1152
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,850
It was a tranquilizer.

1153
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,190
She's okay it was a tranquilizer guys.

1154
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,670
What do I do here?

1155
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,530
Where the fuck are people here?

1156
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,430
A very long tranquilizer.

1157
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:47,710
Oh.

1158
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,910
Where the fuck do I go from here?

1159
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,510
Okay give me a sec.

1160
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,350
I need to figure this out.

1161
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,230
Oh I can combine.

1162
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,510
Craft.

1163
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,090
Mix herb.

1164
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,090
What does this do?

1165
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,330
Restore three times as much health.

1166
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:07,890
Oh okay.

1167
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,350
Now where do I go?

1168
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,570
Follow the path.

1169
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,250
What path?

1170
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,330
That?

1171
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,350
Is that a path?

1172
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,510
Okay.

1173
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,920
There's no way he sees me.

1174
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,960
There's no fucking...

1175
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,900
No you don't see me!

1176
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,620
What the fuck?

1177
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,300
Okay.

1178
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,200
Oh I fucked up guys!

1179
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,200
I fucked up!

1180
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,780
Oh!

1181
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,400
Is that a door?

1182
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,680
Oh fuck!

1183
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,080
Wrong door!

1184
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,860
Guys!

1185
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,620
That was the wrong door!

1186
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,640
Oh shit!

1187
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,200
Don't wait!

1188
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:00,740
Oh!

1189
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,940
Don't worry!

1190
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,460
Wrong door!

1191
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,520
Wrong door!

1192
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,480
It's okay!

1193
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,680
Apparently I don't have a stamina meter!

1194
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,720
It's okay!

1195
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,300
We've learned!

1196
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,420
Okay.

1197
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,400
There we go.

1198
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,840
Wrong door!

1199
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,340
Wrong door!

1200
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:19,840
Wrong door!

1201
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,340
I'll just keep running backwards!

1202
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,040
We've learned how to do this!

1203
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,500
I ran to the dead end!

1204
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,440
Nothing has changed.

1205
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,580
Nothing has changed for me!

1206
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,660
Oh god!

1207
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,060
Oh god!

1208
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,240
It's okay!

1209
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,520
Nothing has changed!

1210
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,680
My knife is stronger!

1211
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,760
Leon please!

1212
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,080
You're so strong Leon!

1213
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,960
That's great!

1214
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:58,760
Go!

1215
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,460
Go!

1216
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,160
Go!

1217
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,300
Nothing has changed for me!

1218
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,300
Okay!

1219
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,300
Alright!

1220
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,900
Let's go get some heals real fast!

1221
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,720
It's just like old times!

1222
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,240
It's just like old times!

1223
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,800
Okay.

1224
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,450
Oh please don't tell me he's over here.

1225
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,970
Oh my god!

1226
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:29,350
Hey guys!

1227
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,670
Oh fuck!

1228
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,290
Bye guys!

1229
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:33,630
Okay it's fine!

1230
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,050
It's fine!

1231
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,430
It's fine!

1232
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,770
I'm reloading!

1233
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,190
It's fine!

1234
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,090
It's just like old times!

1235
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,510
Never forget!

1236
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:45,790
Woo!

1237
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,590
But I couldn't make it in time!

1238
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,250
Okay.

1239
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:54,730
Okay.

1240
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,150
Woo!

1241
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,950
What the fuck are you doing here?

1242
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,530
Don't worry.

1243
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,710
I can run.

1244
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:03,290
I cannot run around but I can run down here.

1245
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:05,290
Don't worry!

1246
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:05,510
Kick!

1247
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,750
Oh please leave me alone!

1248
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:08,770
Oh!

1249
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,070
Oh!

1250
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:11,530
Kick!

1251
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,330
Woo!

1252
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,050
Shit!

1253
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,690
Okay!

1254
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:18,090
Oh!

1255
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,730
Guys!

1256
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,910
Okay it's fine!

1257
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,990
Three bullets and a dream!

1258
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,210
Three bullets and a dream!

1259
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,470
It's okay!

1260
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,470
I have a friend!

1261
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,650
Alright!

1262
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,170
Nothing has changed!

1263
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,870
Nothing has changed!

1264
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,390
If you close your eyes!

1265
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,330
Ba da da da!

1266
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,070
Ba ma!

1267
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,110
Ba ba ba ba ba dum!

1268
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,010
If you close your eyes!

1269
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:39,850
Woo!

1270
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,150
Thank you!

1271
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,410
Just keep running!

1272
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:46,530
What?

1273
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,070
Shit!

1274
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:47,450
Okay!

1275
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,890
Okay!

1276
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:49,930
Just keep running!

1277
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,070
Don't kill the friends!

1278
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,370
Oh my god!

1279
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:54,970
Granny please!

1280
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:55,990
Woo!

1281
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,350
Seraphine!

1282
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,150
I ran out of ammo!

1283
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,610
Unlike last time!

1284
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,350
I don't remember where all the ammo is!

1285
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,290
Oh!

1286
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,650
My knife is broken too!

1287
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,510
Okay!

1288
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,010
It's fine!

1289
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,570
It's fine!

1290
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,050
I know!

1291
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,310
There's a... I'll get it when everybody's dead!

1292
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,050
Guys!

1293
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,690
I'll grab the shotgun when people are dead!

1294
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,090
But at the moment!

1295
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,490
We don't have that!

1296
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:23,650
Ah!

1297
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:24,290
Shit!

1298
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:24,970
It's okay!

1299
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:25,470
She missed!

1300
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,310
Wee!

1301
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,030
It's just run!

1302
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,690
Guys!

1303
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,270
I don't have the mental portent to grab the shotgun right now!

1304
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,410
I don't know where it is!

1305
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,010
It's totally fine!

1306
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,290
There's so many houses!

1307
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,570
Which is the right house?

1308
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:39,790
Oh!

1309
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,130
Thank god!

1310
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,450
Okay!

1311
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,250
I did it!

1312
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,570
Now I can go through the houses!

1313
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:01,960
Oh!

1314
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,060
I survived!

1315
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,600
Oh!

1316
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,220
I did it!

1317
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,820
Carl!

1318
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,820
Thank you for the super chat!

1319
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,180
Thank you!

1320
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,600
Thank you!

1321
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,400
Here lies Doki!

1322
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,980
Her knife broke and she ran out of bullets!

1323
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,700
Here we go!

1324
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,580
First try!

1325
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,580
First try!

1326
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,750
Say the line Leon!

1327
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,730
Say the line!

1328
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,040
Leon!

1329
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,710
Where's everyone going?

1330
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:54,930
Bingo?

1331
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:55,990
Wooo!

1332
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,050
He said the line!

1333
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,900
Resident Evil 4!

1334
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:13,950
Holy fuck!

1335
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,190
We did it!

1336
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,650
Alright!

1337
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,090
Let's go find out how to get the axe!

1338
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,490
Or the shotgun!

1339
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,250
Please stop talking to me!

1340
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,590
I need to get the fucking shotgun!

1341
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,250
Windmill!

1342
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,110
Copy that!

1343
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,650
And be careful!

1344
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:29,890
First out!

1345
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,610
Copy and ninja!

1346
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,530
Thank you for the super chat!

1347
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:33,950
Thank you!

1348
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:34,470
Thank you!

1349
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:35,470
Okay!

1350
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,770
Let's go grab some ammo!

1351
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:40,990
Alright!

1352
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,410
Oh!

1353
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:41,730
Nice!

1354
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:43,030
We can craft stuff here!

1355
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,200
He set the thing guys!

1356
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,040
He did it!

1357
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,240
Can I open this?

1358
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:51,780
Okay!

1359
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:54,940
Oh!

1360
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,420
Okay!

1361
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,820
That...

1362
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,380
I mean!

1363
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,060
Good thing I didn't find it!

1364
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,640
I didn't find these guys!

1365
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,480
Or I would have wasted it all on this mission!

1366
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:04,900
Guys!

1367
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,320
Just remember!

1368
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,600
I could have wasted that!

1369
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,780
If I found all these items!

1370
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,820
Instead of...

1371
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,620
It's a good thing I wasted my inferior regular handgun bullets!

1372
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,600
Instead of my...

1373
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,660
Instead of my shotgun ammo!

1374
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,300
I'm big braining it guys!

1375
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,560
This is all...

1376
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,840
This is all big brain!

1377
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,600
Okay!

1378
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,240
Where the fuck is the...

1379
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,560
Shotgun at?

1380
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,140
Shotgun?

1381
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,320
I'm so confused!

1382
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,800
I'm already lost!

1383
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,440
What is that?

1384
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,140
What is this?

1385
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:41,620
Oh!

1386
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,620
Gap in the wall!

1387
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:47,790
Where?

1388
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:48,130
Yeah!

1389
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,190
It's all part of the plan!

1390
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,750
Guys!

1391
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,050
It's all part of the plan!

1392
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,230
I would have wasted it!

1393
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,710
I would have wasted my...

1394
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,150
My shotgun ammo!

1395
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,450
On something inferior!

1396
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:00,710
Okay!

1397
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,250
That nice handgun ammo!

1398
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:05,930
We needed that!

1399
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,930
Where the fuck could the...

1400
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,690
That?

1401
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:14,650
Over there?

1402
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,430
Now I vault over this?

1403
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:17,930
Nice!

1404
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:18,330
I can't...

1405
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:18,690
Oh shit!

1406
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,210
There's stuff here!

1407
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,730
From all the people I killed!

1408
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:22,410
Money!

1409
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:25,430
Mius!

1410
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,270
Thank you for the super chat!

1411
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:26,590
Thank you!

1412
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,170
Thank you!

1413
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,950
He said the thing!

1414
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,550
Chainsaw guy would have...

1415
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:32,710
Yeah!

1416
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,210
But no...

1417
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,970
But no... I was never gonna kill him!

1418
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,230
There was no way!

1419
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,390
Is it... Okay!

1420
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,450
I don't know if you guys think I will actually remember the layout!

1421
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:47,110
I like how you guys think I remember this layout!

1422
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,810
It's been two years!

1423
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,450
There's a key... here.

1424
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,330
Oh shit!

1425
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,360
Oh shit!

1426
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,410
Okay!

1427
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:06,870
Alright!

1428
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,310
Nice!

1429
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:07,650
Okay!

1430
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,370
He just gave me five bullets!

1431
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,650
I mean...

1432
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:12,970
Five hundred dollars!

1433
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:14,350
That's alright!

1434
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:15,890
Surprise!

1435
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:19,650
Where the fuck could...

1436
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,010
Yeah!

1437
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,070
I can't believe it!

1438
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:22,690
He's not praying!

1439
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,370
What the fuck is he doing?

1440
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,170
How...

1441
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:30,310
How did he...

1442
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:30,890
What the... Where am I?

1443
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:31,870
How dare he!

1444
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:35,650
Oh my god!

1445
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,190
The church is not gonna like this!

1446
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,150
Found a man not praying!

1447
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:42,710
Oh nice!

1448
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,450
First aid spray!

1449
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,170
I missed a yellow barrel!

1450
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,410
Is it back there?

1451
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:49,750
Guys!

1452
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,310
It just wasn't yellow enough I guess!

1453
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,790
Where I killed him?

1454
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,150
Oh he's... Oh there it is!

1455
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:00,690
Boop!

1456
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,050
Nice!

1457
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:02,510
Money!

1458
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:04,690
Alright!

1459
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:05,650
Off I go!

1460
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,150
Okay!

1461
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,050
Thank god Ashley is still not here!

1462
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:15,330
I don't... I don't think how it would have gone very well!

1463
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,090
I like... I'm just getting PTSD of the Ashley missions!

1464
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,390
Oh there's the shotgun!

1465
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:23,870
Nice!

1466
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,070
Okay!

1467
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:27,910
Oh nice!

1468
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:29,670
And then...

1469
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:30,830
I'm gonna steal...

1470
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,390
I'm gonna borrow this real quick!

1471
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,250
And then...

1472
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:35,690
Oh what's this?

1473
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,230
Nice shotgun ammo!

1474
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,070
Okay!

1475
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:40,750
Can I jump out?

1476
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,290
Can I jump out?

1477
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,150
Oh now you don't wanna jump out the window!

1478
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,310
Oh okay!

1479
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,330
Oh is there items here?

1480
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,370
Could be anything here?

1481
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:53,830
Any items?

1482
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:55,290
Any loot?

1483
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,630
Am I done looting?

1484
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,330
I can't tell!

1485
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,650
I'm already lost!

1486
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,470
Not that one!

1487
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,910
Why can't he pick and choose what window?

1488
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,130
This is life or death!

1489
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,130
It shouldn't matter!

1490
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:10,970
I got here?

1491
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,570
Yeah I did!

1492
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:12,950
Did I loot everything?

1493
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,850
I can't tell I'm so fucking lost!

1494
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,450
I can't tell!

1495
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,790
Everything looks the same to me!

1496
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,810
Okay this is just an empty area.

1497
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,030
Anything here?

1498
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:30,470
Oh!

1499
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,130
Herb!

1500
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,830
Left my grass!

1501
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:34,750
Shoot the chicken?

1502
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,650
Does the chicken give me loot?

1503
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,090
Chicken do you give me loot?

1504
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,580
Guys that was a perfectly good bullet!

1505
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,340
I can't believe it!

1506
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,280
Guys!

1507
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,750
This is exact...

1508
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,680
Thank fucking god I'm not playing on hard mode!

1509
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,340
That would've been my last bullet!

1510
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,980
Wait what's this?

1511
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,700
Oh it's a locked drawer!

1512
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,480
Knowing you guys!

1513
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,840
That would 100% been my last bullet!

1514
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,520
If I was on hardcore mode!

1515
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,460
I missed the ammo right here.

1516
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,400
Alright there is a...

1517
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,120
Oh there it is!

1518
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,220
Nice!

1519
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,580
Thank fucking god!

1520
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:27,940
Oh!

1521
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,380
Let's see.

1522
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,820
Alright let's see...

1523
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,740
The ladder here!

1524
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,020
Wait what's the ladder for?

1525
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,780
Oh my god that's a ladder!

1526
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,300
I didn't even realize that was a ladder.

1527
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,160
I thought it was just interior.

1528
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,500
Herb!

1529
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,020
I'll need this...

1530
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,000
AHH!!

1531
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,200
I don't have a knife!

1532
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,820
I broke it!

1533
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,420
What do you mean!

1534
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,200
You have a knife.

1535
00:59:59,380 --> 00:59:59,680
Deadpool!

1536
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,040
I broke my knife!

1537
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,140
Go back to the chicken and pull the bullet out.

1538
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,420
Because I don't know if you guys know how guns work.

1539
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,320
But I'm pretty sure that's not how guns work.

1540
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,000
What's in here?

1541
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,820
Oh, ruby!

1542
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:21,820
That's right.

1543
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,160
Your family heirloom is mine now.

1544
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,180
There's also a house here.

1545
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,720
Nice.

1546
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,300
More ammo.

1547
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,650
Doki, you don't understand.

1548
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,110
If you throw it really, really hard...

1549
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,390
Maybe it'll pierce that guy's skin.

1550
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:45,470
Open!

1551
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,470
I swear.

1552
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,310
I need to be careful of bear traps now.

1553
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,030
Knowing me, I might step into all of it.

1554
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:59,650
Wait, what?

1555
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,190
That house?

1556
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:03,750
You mean there it is?

1557
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,450
Here?

1558
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:05,390
That far?

1559
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,330
I already miss OG.

1560
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,690
I already miss OG Resident Evil 4.

1561
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,110
It was definitely a lot less scarier.

1562
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,410
It was campier.

1563
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,630
Which meant I wasn't as scared.

1564
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,570
When can I customize my case?

1565
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:32,430
If I craft two greens...

1566
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,690
That's twice as much.

1567
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:36,450
Then...

1568
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,610
Might as well make more shotgun ammo.

1569
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,630
Yeah, shotgun shells.

1570
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,830
Time to play Tetris.

1571
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,010
No, no, don't discard it.

1572
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:52,310
I honestly would not be surprised if I accidentally discard this.

1573
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,610
Okay, let me save again.

1574
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,170
Friend, thank you for the magenta soup.

1575
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:00,490
Thank you, thank you.

1576
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,090
You got this.

1577
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:01,810
I believe you.

1578
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,310
For the bloodline, Doki.

1579
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,550
For the bloodline!

1580
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,310
Think about the bloodline, Leon!

1581
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:11,570
Chicken.

1582
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,030
Is that fresh water?

1583
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,910
Oh, there's a cow!

1584
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:16,370
Shoot.

1585
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,450
Ask questions later.

1586
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,680
Oh, he has two headshots.

1587
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,420
Okay, there you go.

1588
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,300
There you go.

1589
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:33,820
We're fine.

1590
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,060
Oh, hello, lady!

1591
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,440
I remember you...

1592
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:38,940
Oh, fuck!

1593
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:39,260
Okay!

1594
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,720
Lady, lady, lady!

1595
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,480
Give me a sec!

1596
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,040
Give me a sec!

1597
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,460
Okay, there you go.

1598
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,040
Give me a sec.

1599
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,060
I'm charging up my gun!

1600
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,220
There we go.

1601
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,720
Oh, fuck!

1602
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,560
Um...

1603
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:51,760
Nice.

1604
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,840
Cow just chill?

1605
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,780
No, that cow's dead.

1606
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,120
Wait, there...

1607
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,540
Nice.

1608
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:01,760
Okay.

1609
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,300
Wait, you have eggs?

1610
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,140
What the fuck?

1611
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,360
What am I gonna do with an egg?

1612
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,600
Can be used...

1613
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,300
Oh my god!

1614
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,320
You wanted me to kill the chickens?

1615
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,100
They give you unlimited heals!

1616
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,460
They have eggs!

1617
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,620
Brown chicken egg?

1618
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,460
Is that better?

1619
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,600
Oh my god!

1620
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,100
The brown chicken eggs are better!

1621
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,360
Ow.

1622
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,720
Did that chicken fucking hit me?

1623
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,980
Okay, maybe I'll kill this chi...

1624
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,780
It's... Oh, it's a male.

1625
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,060
I can kill this chicken.

1626
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:34,720
It's a rooster.

1627
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,640
He wasn't gonna be providing any eggs.

1628
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,020
It's okay, guys!

1629
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,180
It was a male rooster!

1630
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,940
Let's see...

1631
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:59,300
I need to make sure... Okay, farm here...

1632
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,260
No, no...

1633
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,660
Freddy, thank you for that 50 gift of chips!

1634
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,860
Thank you, thank you!

1635
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,000
I really appreciate it!

1636
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,720
Thank you so much!

1637
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:07,800
Wait, the pig... Okay.

1638
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,080
To be fair, pigs are carnivores, though.

1639
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,640
They like...

1640
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,300
They eat anything.

1641
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,480
Like, that's what they say.

1642
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:25,580
People say like if you just like throw a body at a pig, like it's like one of the best ways to like hide the bodies because they'll just eat the body.

1643
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,180
That's why like pigs can even eat their own cows.

1644
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:35,140
If they like... If the pigs got cut or something, the pigs will smell the blood and will be like, ooh!

1645
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,920
Yeah, pigs eat everything.

1646
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,320
Will I ever use the grenades?

1647
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,100
Let's see...

1648
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,660
Well, to be fair, any animal eats their own babies.

1649
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,040
It's not just pigs.

1650
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,620
That's a dead point!

1651
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,220
Thank you for the five gift of chips!

1652
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,100
Thank you, thank you!

1653
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,300
It's not like a pig thing.

1654
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,920
Every animal eats their own babies because it's like survival of the fittest.

1655
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:15,020
So if they think a baby is not worth like taking care of, they'll just eat it because they're like it's not worth it.

1656
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,040
Okay, I need a key for that.

1657
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,500
Because they're like, I'm not gonna take care of this baby.

1658
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,840
That's too many babies.

1659
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,640
So then they'll just eat it to like...

1660
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,480
What the fuck?

1661
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,840
I heard somebody.

1662
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,800
Who said that?

1663
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:32,480
Hello?

1664
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,420
Hello?

1665
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,800
Where are you?

1666
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,900
Are you trying to open a door?

1667
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:42,940
Where is she?

1668
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,600
That her?

1669
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,340
I hear you.

1670
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
She's inside.

1671
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:55,520
Hello?

1672
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,520
Oh, ma'am, there you are!

1673
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,760
Where did you come from?

1674
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,900
Can you get a little bit closer?

1675
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:03,920
Thank you.

1676
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,820
Thank you, that's a lot easier.

1677
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,600
Can you get a little bit closer?

1678
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:08,400
There we go.

1679
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,840
Can you turn around?

1680
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,300
Alright, here you go.

1681
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,400
Nice.

1682
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,300
Where did she come from?

1683
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,680
Wait, where did she come from?

1684
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,840
There's no entrances here.

1685
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:23,420
Hello?

1686
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,040
Where did you come from?

1687
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,080
Alright, time to open the door.

1688
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:40,420
Boop.

1689
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,580
No good.

1690
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,100
Oh.

1691
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:42,980
Oh.

1692
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,880
How the fuck did she get there?

1693
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:46,660
Medallion?

1694
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,900
Where's the medallion?

1695
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,400
I already walked, looked through everything.

1696
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,340
Where did she come from?

1697
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,220
Where did she go?

1698
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,000
The chickens?

1699
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,880
Watch the chickens?

1700
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:00,800
What do you mean?

1701
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,560
They seem like...

1702
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,240
They seem like good chickens.

1703
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:04,300
What do you mean?

1704
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,300
They seem like good chickens.

1705
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,960
Oh, you mean this thing?

1706
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,260
This thing?

1707
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:09,900
Do I shoot this?

1708
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,660
I forgot if I shoot this.

1709
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,380
Oh, I do.

1710
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,180
Okay.

1711
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,760
I remember now.

1712
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,760
Oh, there's another one.

1713
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,360
Right here.

1714
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,940
What a waste of perfectly good bullets though.

1715
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:28,880
There you go.

1716
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,140
Two.

1717
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,280
Wait, what happens if I find all five?

1718
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,340
This is new.

1719
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,420
I don't know.

1720
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,080
Or maybe it's not.

1721
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,400
I never was an achievement hunter.

1722
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,400
Maybe it wasn't new.

1723
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,720
I just don't ever realize.

1724
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:47,970
It's worth it.

1725
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,170
If only I have a knife.

1726
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:50,650
I know!

1727
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,090
If only the chainsaw guy didn't fucking fuck me up.

1728
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh, there's one.

1729
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,660
Where's the last two?

1730
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,440
Are all of them in this village?

1731
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,800
Wait, they're on the map too?

1732
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,340
They are?

1733
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,420
Liar!

1734
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,100
Hahaha!

1735
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,200
What the fuck do you mean?

1736
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,580
The blue paper?

1737
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,680
Wait, is the blue paper considered?

1738
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:30,020
You can take on tasks by collecting the blue request notes.

1739
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,880
View the requests you've taken.

1740
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,580
The love of god with some, please get rid of blue medallions.

1741
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,660
Those religious lunatics left hanging around.

1742
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:38,820
Rewards.

1743
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:39,940
Finale 3.

1744
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,540
Wait, what the fuck is this?

1745
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,000
What the fuck is a spinel?

1746
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,080
Oh, there it is!

1747
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,240
Oh, I should have taken the blue paper first.

1748
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,220
Wait, how do I get that?

1749
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,260
I can't even get there.

1750
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:53,660
Oh!

1751
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,100
Okay, that other one I can get to easily.

1752
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,040
That one's here.

1753
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:02,840
That's...

1754
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,040
Wow!

1755
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:03,660
Chicken!

1756
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,740
Okay, now I know why people said watch out for the chickens.

1757
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,100
Medallion here?

1758
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,060
Okay.

1759
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,340
Where?

1760
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,280
I don't see any blues.

1761
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,220
Where the fuck is that blue?

1762
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:21,800
What?

1763
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,300
Oh, gamers don't look up.

1764
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,020
Oh my god.

1765
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,500
Of course.

1766
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:31,900
Always.

1767
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,480
It's always up.

1768
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,960
Okay, how do I get there though?

1769
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,240
I think I need a key.

1770
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,880
Blues clues.

1771
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,400
Fucking wacky ass blues clues shit.

1772
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,400
Like, how do I?

1773
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,140
I can't open this door.

1774
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,420
From the window?

1775
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,220
Can't get up.

1776
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,470
How do I get up there?

1777
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:03,410
Windmill?

1778
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,850
There's a windmill?

1779
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,350
Here?

1780
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,430
Oh, there is!

1781
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:10,790
Hello?

1782
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,630
Oh, that's a bomb.

1783
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:17,570
Okay.

1784
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,190
Can I just?

1785
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,070
Okay, I'm just gonna walk under it.

1786
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:28,390
Wait, can I disable it?

1787
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:29,590
Oh, I can!

1788
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:30,070
Nice.

1789
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,050
Okay, thank god.

1790
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,950
I almost thought that was gonna fuck me over.

1791
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,590
Hello?

1792
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:39,030
Anybody here?

1793
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,890
Grab this yellow herb.

1794
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:44,790
Hello?

1795
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,710
Anybody up top?

1796
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,250
I feel like there's somebody up top.

1797
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,590
There's always somebody up top.

1798
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:50,810
I'm coming up, guys!

1799
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:55,690
I'm gonna announce my... I'm gonna announce my appearance!

1800
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,880
Oh, what's this?

1801
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,260
A puzzle?

1802
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,700
God, what happened to the repair people here?

1803
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,700
My god!

1804
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,800
If I was an inspector...

1805
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:18,280
If I was an inspector, I would close all of this down.

1806
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,100
There you go.

1807
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:20,460
Five.

1808
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,580
I did it!

1809
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,120
Where's my spinel?

1810
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,920
Okay, red herb handgun.

1811
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,360
Nice.

1812
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,080
Can I go through here?

1813
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:30,900
Nice!

1814
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,040
Free loot!

1815
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,800
Free loot!

1816
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,640
Wait a minute.

1817
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,240
Hello?

1818
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,740
Wait, who the fuck is that?

1819
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,180
Who the fuck is that?

1820
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:51,840
Who's that?

1821
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:53,240
Who's he?

1822
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:54,860
Who's he?

1823
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:55,680
Who's he?

1824
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:57,840
Okay,

1825
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,570
I'll just shoot you in the head now!

1826
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,880
Oh, it's you!

1827
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:36,460
I'm sorry!

1828
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,460
I'm trespassing again!

1829
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:40,580
Oh, shit.

1830
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,760
Please don't climb up the ladder.

1831
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:42,040
Please.

1832
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,340
Please, I'm reloading.

1833
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,700
Okay, thank god.

1834
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,460
Here we go.

1835
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:49,760
We're good.

1836
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,260
It's fine.

1837
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,500
Are you guys dead?

1838
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,980
Oh, I don't have a knife.

1839
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,300
I'm just gonna shoot you in the legs then.

1840
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,240
Alright, here you go.

1841
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,300
I have to shoot you in the legs because I don't have a knife.

1842
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,260
Are you dead?

1843
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,100
Are you dead?

1844
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,320
He's dead.

1845
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,800
Oh, thank god for ladders!

1846
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,840
Thank god!

1847
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,800
Saved by the ladder!

1848
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,460
Nice.

1849
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,560
We did it.

1850
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,640
Oh, thank god!

1851
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,260
A kitchen knife!

1852
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,040
That would have been so helpful earlier.

1853
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,020
Oh, nice ruby too.

1854
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,140
Alright, we did it.

1855
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:43,840
We got the...

1856
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,180
Saved by ladders.

1857
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,260
I love it.

1858
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,640
You won because the ladder buffed.

1859
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,060
I wish I could have taken that guy's fucking hammer though!

1860
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,940
The hammer seemed pretty fucking neat!

1861
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,560
Alright, what the...

1862
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,700
Okay, cannot be used.

1863
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,120
I combine the hands of your...

1864
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,180
You know, I'm just gonna...

1865
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,920
I'm gonna come craft.

1866
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,320
I'll mix the red and the yellow.

1867
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,040
What does it do?

1868
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,980
It'll increase my maximum...

1869
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,360
Oh, wait!

1870
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,220
That's good!

1871
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,360
Should I just eat it now?

1872
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,820
Or the throwing axe, yeah.

1873
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,880
Red, yellow, green.

1874
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:27,920
I'm not gonna throw it.

1875
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,640
I might as well just eat it now.

1876
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,260
I don't need the heals at the moment.

1877
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,700
Yeah, but I don't need the full heal.

1878
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,460
I feel like that's a waste.

1879
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,520
I might as well just heal this.

1880
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,080
Get this.

1881
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,000
Wait when you...

1882
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,560
Fine!

1883
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,360
Fine!

1884
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,100
I'll wait until I...

1885
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,680
Fine, I'll combine it with the green.

1886
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:50,940
Fine.

1887
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,140
Okay.

1888
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,100
Tetris.

1889
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:54,260
Nice.

1890
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,080
God, for the fucking high ground shit though.

1891
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,460
Did I get the thing automatically?

1892
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,900
Where's my... whatever the fuck that was?

1893
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:04,900
Here.

1894
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,760
Can I claim it?

1895
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,580
I destroyed it all.

1896
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,360
Does it automatically go to me?

1897
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,240
I'm confused.

1898
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,700
Confused doki right now.

1899
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,440
Oh, at the merchant!

1900
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,020
Okay.

1901
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,820
I have to visit him.

1902
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,240
Okay.

1903
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,160
Is the merchant the only sane person in this village?

1904
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,280
Why doesn't Leon take the weapons?

1905
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,860
Is he stupid?

1906
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,100
Thank you in the super chat.

1907
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:38,600
Thank you.

1908
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,260
Thank you.

1909
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,180
A knife made for cooking its edge.

1910
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,520
Alright, well, this is apparently my knife now.

1911
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,680
Well, can I fix this?

1912
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,200
I guess like I have to send it to the merchant to fix it.

1913
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,540
What is this?

1914
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,520
For selling only.

1915
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,080
2000.

1916
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,000
What the fuck?

1917
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,400
The ruby is more expensive.

1918
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,240
Wait, actually...

1919
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:01,640
I don't know.

1920
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,080
Wait, there's like a place I haven't gone here.

1921
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:06,740
Alright.

1922
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,440
Yeah, my fucking kitchen knife.

1923
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:09,820
Be...

1924
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:10,880
Be scared.

1925
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,000
I have a kitchen knife now.

1926
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:16,500
Woooo.

1927
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,180
Woooo.

1928
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,700
Nice money.

1929
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,620
Open?

1930
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,300
Is that the...

1931
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:29,860
What?

1932
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,060
What is this?

1933
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:31,620
Oh, it's a...

1934
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,280
You're buying treasures, you can view the treasures.

1935
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,380
Some treasures are going to be sold by fitting them.

1936
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,980
What the fuck is this?

1937
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:44,470
OK.

1938
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:47,030
I just put...

1939
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,630
Can I make this more expensive?

1940
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:55,570
If I put two rubies, do I make this more expensive?

1941
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:00,030
Oh.

1942
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:01,670
Oh!

1943
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:04,970
Now, ruby number two.

1944
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:05,210
Two!

1945
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:07,030
Okay.

1946
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,990
Ruby number two.

1947
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,870
Oh, plus 3000!

1948
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:14,830
Wait, but like, it's already... wait.

1949
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:16,950
But if I sell it, it's already 3000.

1950
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,210
Like, what?

1951
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,830
Okay, two gems.

1952
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:23,890
Oh, one times two!

1953
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,550
I feel like I might as well... it gives you a bonus.

1954
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:35,190
Well, I can only combine two right now, so I might as well just combine the double.

1955
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,410
Oh!

1956
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:37,550
Oh!

1957
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:39,450
Quick maths.

1958
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:40,970
Barrels.

1959
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,270
I want all this money.

1960
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,010
Come on.

1961
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:46,910
Yes.

1962
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:49,910
Okay.

1963
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:51,510
Wait, can I kick this too?

1964
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,590
No lock can contain these thighs!

1965
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,890
Neil, thank you for the super chat!

1966
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:03,650
Thank you, thank you!

1967
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,930
I'm not sure if merchant even is.

1968
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,790
I'm just one person, considering his magical...

1969
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:08,010
That's just his twin brother.

1970
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,030
Or triplets.

1971
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,590
Or like, I don't know, he just... comes from a very big family!

1972
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:12,370
You don't understand!

1973
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,270
It's like Nurse Joy's!

1974
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,750
The Nurse Joy's and Officer Jenny's...

1975
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,590
They're all just like one big, giant family.

1976
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,490
They're like the merchant family.

1977
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:24,670
Alright.

1978
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:28,010
I'm gonna save my game.

1979
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,190
I don't trust myself.

1980
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:32,910
Get out of the way, pigs.

1981
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:35,170
I'm gonna save my game.

1982
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:38,290
I'm gonna save my game and use the bathroom real quick.

1983
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,030
Wait, where's... it's over here.

1984
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,270
Where it all started.

1985
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,070
I'll be right back guys.

1986
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:48,550
I saved the game.

1987
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,600
Alright, I'm back.

1988
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,200
I'm back guys.

1989
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,440
It's okay.

1990
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,020
We saved our game.

1991
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,660
Nothing bad is gonna happen to us now.

1992
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,620
That's how it goes.

1993
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,080
Alright, up I go.

1994
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,040
There we go.

1995
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,460
Where the fuck am I?

1996
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,160
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot where I was.

1997
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,200
I didn't show you.

1998
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:30,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1999
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,200
Thank you.

2000
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:31,660
Thank you.

2001
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,100
Irene, thank you for the super chat.

2002
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:33,420
Thank you.

2003
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,060
Thank you.

2004
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,120
Thank you for the super.

2005
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:35,980
Irene.

2006
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,680
Oh no, not here.

2007
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,920
Bro, not the chainsaw man.

2008
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,240
Do I have shotgun M?

2009
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,200
Okay, three.

2010
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,460
Let me...

2011
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,540
Let me reload real quick.

2012
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:54,980
Alright.

2013
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,960
Here we go.

2014
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,400
Alright.

2015
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,860
I remember this place.

2016
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,120
Deja vu.

2017
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,460
What's this?

2018
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,640
Can I push this?

2019
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,580
Do I push this now or later?

2020
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,920
Oh, maybe this isn't.

2021
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,620
Is this it?

2022
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,740
Is this the place?

2023
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:17,900
Okay.

2024
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,320
Oh, you're right.

2025
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,640
I have the grenades too.

2026
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,220
Don't worry.

2027
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,700
I'm very prepared this time.

2028
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:25,460
Wait, what?

2029
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,300
What's over here?

2030
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,380
Maybe there's something here.

2031
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,540
Jesus Christ, Leon.

2032
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,540
These fucking thighs.

2033
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,350
I'm worried.

2034
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,890
I'm always worried.

2035
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,310
Shredding off the path now.

2036
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,830
I feel like anything's gonna get me.

2037
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:55,410
Leon's never skipped leg day.

2038
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:58,050
Alright.

2039
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:00,850
Do I have to go up here?

2040
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,270
I mean, I could just go this way.

2041
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,290
What if I don't go up to that house?

2042
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,210
I could just go this way instead.

2043
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,490
I mean, it wouldn't hurt.

2044
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,060
Nothing can hurt me if I go this way.

2045
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:25,640
I'm gonna go this way.

2046
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:25,780
I'm gonna go this way.

2047
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:33,560
Even if Ashley is over there, maybe it won't matter.

2048
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,360
Maybe it won't matter.

2049
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:36,640
Maybe it won't matter.

2050
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:38,580
Maybe it won't matter.

2051
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:39,680
Hello?

2052
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,660
Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.

2053
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,100
I couldn't fucking open the door.

2054
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:44,880
What the fuck, guys?

2055
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,020
It doesn't matter.

2056
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,960
I couldn't even open the door.

2057
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:51,480
Alright.

2058
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,220
It's fine.

2059
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:55,680
It was not...

2060
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,880
It was not even loot anyway.

2061
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,820
There wasn't even loot there.

2062
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,500
Liars!

2063
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,840
The illusion of choice.

2064
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,920
Okay, are there any fucking traps?

2065
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,160
No traps.

2066
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:09,580
Okay.

2067
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,240
Thank god.

2068
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:10,680
Okay.

2069
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,040
Oh my god!

2070
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:19,420
My thighs!

2071
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,080
Those thighs saved me yet again!

2072
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,600
Good job, Leon!

2073
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,520
Uh oh...

2074
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,480
The double illusion of choice.

2075
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,260
I love the double illusion of choice...

2076
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,560
... out there.

2077
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,220
Let's see.

2078
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:41,940
Nice money!

2079
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,660
The power of thighs saved me yet again.

2080
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:47,900
Save me yet again!

2081
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,500
I knew you had it in you, Leon...

2082
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:49,780
I knew you had it in you, Leon...

2083
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:52,500
Those thighs will never...

2084
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,400
Those thighs will never...

2085
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,600
Oops, still locked.

2086
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,860
What the fuck?

2087
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,680
Where do I go then?

2088
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,600
Where do I go?

2089
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,680
Do I go back on the back?

2090
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,110
Maybe do I drop down from here?

2091
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:19,740
No?

2092
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,150
Was it the right way?

2093
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:28,250
Oh, they didn't block the path?

2094
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,950
Oh my god, I thought they blocked it!

2095
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,890
I just thought it was blocked!

2096
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,250
Okay, let me go back then.

2097
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:38,610
Oh no!

2098
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,290
Fucking rocks fell down!

2099
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:42,450
I didn't know Leon could climb!

2100
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:45,230
I mean, he couldn't fucking climb before!

2101
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:48,170
Oh, it was just logs.

2102
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:48,830
Okay.

2103
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:53,550
Oh shit!

2104
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:54,470
Oh, oh!

2105
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,190
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

2106
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,990
That's not cool.

2107
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,410
Guys, I can shoot through this, right?

2108
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:01,590
Oh, I can.

2109
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:02,890
Grab the needle.

2110
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,680
I love cheese!

2111
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,460
Okay, where's the other guy?

2112
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,200
Where is the other guy?

2113
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,420
Wait, where is the other guy?

2114
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,620
Oh, he's over here.

2115
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,060
Okay.

2116
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:32,540
I love cheese.

2117
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:33,720
Wait.

2118
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:35,960
I killed them.

2119
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,800
There's loot over there.

2120
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,400
I killed them though.

2121
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,180
Right.

2122
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:41,980
I'm up here?

2123
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,700
Why is the tree shooting?

2124
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:47,300
Oh!

2125
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,160
Sorry.

2126
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,060
Gamers don't look anywhere but straight.

2127
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:53,680
Nice.

2128
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:55,920
So easy.

2129
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:59,520
Okay, can the granny get a little bit closer?

2130
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,000
Granny, I need you to get closer so I can hit the head.

2131
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,480
Thank you, granny.

2132
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,180
Granny, can you run a little bit closer?

2133
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,300
Thank you, granny.

2134
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,060
Granny, you're just...

2135
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,040
You're almost there, granny.

2136
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,340
So I don't have to run too far.

2137
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,500
Okay, there you go.

2138
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,180
Thank you, granny.

2139
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,880
It saves...

2140
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,380
Look, these thighs...

2141
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,980
These thighs need to break right now.

2142
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,820
These thighs need a break.

2143
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,780
I need her to get closer so I don't have to run too much for loot.

2144
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,360
And I need to make sure I don't fucking step on bear traps too.

2145
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,320
I feel like Doki's gonna grenade herself instead of...

2146
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:41,560
Yes.

2147
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:42,900
100%.

2148
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,860
That should not even be a question.

2149
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,140
Thank you for the super chat.

2150
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:47,580
Thank you.

2151
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,800
Look, there has to be like maintenance on these thighs.

2152
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,440
You can't like overuse it.

2153
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,700
Where the fuck is my flashlight?

2154
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,220
How do I ping my flashlight to be used?

2155
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,320
It is clearly dark, Leon!

2156
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,640
Turn on your flashlight!

2157
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:07,720
Okay.

2158
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,760
Oh, hello.

2159
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,280
F?

2160
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,060
It's not F.

2161
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:15,820
I tried.

2162
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,660
Thank you for the super chat.

2163
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:17,980
Thank you.

2164
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:18,460
Thank you.

2165
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:22,380
Hello?

2166
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:24,600
Hello, guys.

2167
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,360
Oh, there's granny.

2168
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,360
Who are they?

2169
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,220
Try that.

2170
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:32,380
No!

2171
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,260
No, no, no, no, no.

2172
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,620
Wait.

2173
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,480
Wait, where is he?

2174
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,760
Oh my gosh, where are they?

2175
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,780
I hear the bomb!

2176
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,480
Oh, okay.

2177
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,320
Okay, he blew himself up.

2178
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:47,640
Okay.

2179
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's like, I hear it.

2180
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:52,680
Hello?

2181
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,000
I know granny is over here.

2182
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:56,740
Granny?

2183
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,040
Oh.

2184
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,040
Granny?

2185
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:01,700
Granny?

2186
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:03,860
Oh.

2187
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,620
Oh, there it is.

2188
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:11,180
Hello?

2189
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:15,940
What?

2190
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,880
That's a hit!

2191
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:18,940
There we go.

2192
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,420
Oh, no.

2193
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:22,500
Died?

2194
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,000
That's five.

2195
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:24,540
Oh, many!

2196
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:25,160
Nice!

2197
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:25,860
Big thighs!

2198
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:26,880
Save lives.

2199
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:29,820
Okay.

2200
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:34,390
Oh, no.

2201
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,270
Oh, shit.

2202
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:35,970
Big thighs!

2203
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:36,870
Oh!

2204
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:37,570
Oh!

2205
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:40,470
No!

2206
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:41,410
No!

2207
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:41,550
No!

2208
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:44,410
Okay.

2209
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:45,790
Okay.

2210
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:48,690
I'm just gonna deal with this gap first.

2211
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,370
Oh, shit!

2212
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:50,830
Okay.

2213
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,190
Give me a sec.

2214
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:53,970
Gotta reload.

2215
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:57,470
Give me a sec.

2216
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,100
Oh, give me a sec.

2217
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:03,740
Whoa!

2218
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,620
Oh, shit.

2219
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,140
Oh, shit.

2220
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:06,960
Oh, shit.

2221
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,880
Oh, my God!

2222
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,400
Oh, my God!

2223
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,500
Okay, that's good.

2224
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,680
That is good.

2225
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:14,460
Oh!

2226
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,240
There are more!

2227
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:17,760
God, shit!

2228
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:18,680
Oh!

2229
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,260
Ho!

2230
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:19,380
Ho!

2231
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:19,560
Ho!

2232
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,060
Don't hurt me.

2233
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,320
I'm in my suitcase.

2234
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,620
Do not hurt me!

2235
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:30,700
Oh, God.

2236
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,520
Okay, thank you.

2237
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,720
It's fine.

2238
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,640
Everything is fine.

2239
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,260
Wait, what?

2240
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,640
Where did she throw that?

2241
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:48,840
Where is she?

2242
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,320
Time out!

2243
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,120
Time out!

2244
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:52,800
Time out!

2245
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,120
Ma'am?

2246
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,320
Ma'am!

2247
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:03,460
Where are you?

2248
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:04,180
Ma'am!

2249
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,000
Where is she?

2250
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,300
Where is the invisible granny?

2251
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:14,880
Ma'am!

2252
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,880
I don't like this.

2253
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,700
I don't know where the invisible granny is.

2254
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,420
Is she up there?

2255
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,260

2256
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:24,760
Please!

2257
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:26,740
Come down!

2258
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,700
I won't hurt you!

2259
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,780
I'm just gonna take you to a farm downstate!

2260
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:31,940
I swear!

2261
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,780
Granny, please come down!

2262
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,080
Your family's worried about you!

2263
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,500
This is a tranquilizer gun!

2264
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:41,720
There we go.

2265
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:44,980
I hope she's not gonna turn.

2266
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:45,920
Is she gonna morb?

2267
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:47,880
No, she's fine.

2268
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,880
I just need her head to poke up for like one second.

2269
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:52,260
There we go.

2270
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,320
Oh no, she's fucking turning.

2271
01:30:58,680 --> 01:30:59,200
Shit!

2272
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,980
Jesus Christ!

2273
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,000
Please!

2274
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:06,380
Granny!

2275
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:07,780
I have the power!

2276
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:09,060
It's alright.

2277
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,840
I'm just gonna wait a little bit.

2278
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:11,540
There we go.

2279
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,280
Okay, is she gonna...

2280
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,700
NO!

2281
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:21,520
I hate these bear traps so much.

2282
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,020
God damn it, these stupid fucking bear traps.

2283
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,660
How do I, okay.

2284
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,100
How do I disable this?

2285
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,180
I see you.

2286
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,500
I acknowledge your existence.

2287
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,740
How do I disable?

2288
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:46,140
I acknowledge it's a- oh knife, okay.

2289
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:47,340
Okay.

2290
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:52,420
What do I do?

2291
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:53,560
Why?

2292
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,080
Oh!

2293
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,240
Oh thank god, I thought I like stepped on it.

2294
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:59,460
Oh thank fucking god.

2295
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:02,060
I honestly thought I just stepped on it.

2296
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,700
Oh thank god.

2297
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,140
Alright.

2298
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,020
Thank god I didn't step on it guys, there's hope.

2299
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:20,120
Wait how do I...

2300
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,280
How do I get in?

2301
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:22,940
Oh.

2302
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,260
I hear something here.

2303
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,440
Oh there's a crystal.

2304
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:36,630
What is that?

2305
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,370
What is that sound?

2306
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:40,290
I don't like this.

2307
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:45,210
What the fuck is that sound?

2308
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,130
A collectible?

2309
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,650
Oh it's above me!

2310
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:49,510
I see it!

2311
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,370
How do I get it?

2312
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,290
Do I just shoot it?

2313
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:55,010
Oh I do.

2314
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:55,650
Okay.

2315
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:58,150
Alright.

2316
01:32:58,610 --> 01:32:59,370
I do.

2317
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:03,030
Alright that will be the only collectible I get in this entire run.

2318
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:08,770
Alright.

2319
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:11,510
That should be...

2320
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:15,630
I swear to god if there's another fucking bear trap...

2321
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,110
I swear to fucking god.

2322
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:21,550
Okay.

2323
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:23,990
Uhhhh...

2324
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:26,850
Just making sure I didn't miss anything.

2325
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,790
Alright, we can go this way then.

2326
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:31,230
Did we miss anything?

2327
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:32,190
No we didn't.

2328
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:34,470
Alright.

2329
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,990
Reload.

2330
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:35,530
Reloading.

2331
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:37,770
Wait there's more?

2332
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:40,710
Oh there is more.

2333
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:44,750
Sir.

2334
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:45,410
Please.

2335
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:46,490
Get away.

2336
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,230
Oh no.

2337
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,590
I have to... Oh no he's...

2338
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:51,570
Okay he's not... He didn't... He didn't turn.

2339
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:52,870
Oh thank god.

2340
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:56,350
I thought I had to like fucking knife... knife him with my kitchen knife.

2341
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:57,410
I didn't have to...

2342
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:01,950
Oh it's... Hey guys remember this?

2343
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:03,130
Hahaha.

2344
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:03,550
Hahaha.

2345
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:08,050
Wait before I shoot the lake...

2346
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,830
Is there a save point anywhere?

2347
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,870
Is there a save point?

2348
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:17,810
Guys!

2349
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:23,690
Please tell me I don't have to restart my entire game!

2350
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,050
Oh this is the wrong... Oh thank god.

2351
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:30,050
This is the wrong part of the lake.

2352
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,070
Okay we're just gonna admire the scenery.

2353
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,150
Alright that's... Thank god.

2354
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,510
Okay.

2355
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,450
Okay that's good.

2356
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:38,730
That's good.

2357
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:40,530
It's the wrong part of the lake.

2358
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,230
I hear people inside.

2359
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,790
Can I go over here?

2360
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,170
No.

2361
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:47,850
Can't.

2362
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:49,810
There's people inside though.

2363
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:50,670
I'm ready.

2364
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:51,670
I reloaded my gun.

2365
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:53,350
I'm ready to shoot whoever is in there.

2366
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:55,490
Self defense.

2367
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:58,190
I swear to god if there's a bear trap.

2368
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:58,570
Okay.

2369
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:00,730
Oh I don't like this.

2370
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:01,330
Oh.

2371
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,210
Which way do I go?

2372
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,390
Hello?

2373
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:09,850
Oh.

2374
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:10,650
Oh.

2375
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:12,210
Don't like that.

2376
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:13,350
Oh.

2377
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:17,990
Oh somebody's inside there.

2378
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,810
That's very angy.

2379
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:22,150
Hello?

2380
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:25,710
Hello?

2381
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:28,830
There's a la...

2382
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:29,830
Yeah I know but like...

2383
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:30,770
I wanna know like...

2384
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:32,090
If I could go inside...

2385
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:32,870
Oh there it is.

2386
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:33,230
Okay.

2387
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:34,770
Okay.

2388
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:35,850
Give me a sec.

2389
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,050
Oh my god.

2390
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:39,630
Please Leon.

2391
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,240
Leon please.

2392
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:52,720
Leon.

2393
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,140
Leon please.

2394
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,280
Please Leon.

2395
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,440
I don't understand.

2396
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:00,880
I knifed him.

2397
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,740
I don't understand.

2398
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,960
I don't understand the mechanism.

2399
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,100
I fucking hate hunting.

2400
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,240
Alright nice.

2401
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,520
At least I got ammo.

2402
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,080
It's fine.

2403
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:21,060
I got ammo.

2404
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,300
This was all I wanted.

2405
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,100
I don't need a crouch.

2406
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:25,460
Okay.

2407
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:26,740
That's good to know.

2408
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:28,660
Alright.

2409
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:29,760
Where do I go?

2410
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:29,920
Oh.

2411
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,400
Door with an insignia.

2412
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,180
I don't have that.

2413
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,100
How do I get to there?

2414
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,160
All those years of training.

2415
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,440
The police academy didn't train me for this.

2416
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:45,280
The house?

2417
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,860
Do I try to go back into the house?

2418
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,500
How do I get in the house?

2419
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:49,360
Oh there's a door.

2420
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,340
Sorry.

2421
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,260
That one thing I didn't see.

2422
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,220
Let me in!

2423
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,340
I have a warrant!

2424
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,760
But please don't check it!

2425
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:03,600
Hello?

2426
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:05,660
Hello?

2427
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,460
Hello?

2428
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,080
I don't like this.

2429
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,460
I don't like this.

2430
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,540
I feel like...

2431
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,340
I feel like there's definitely somebody up top.

2432
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:23,860
God damn it.

2433
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,620
Everything needs keys.

2434
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,320
What?

2435
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,720
Why do you need keys for?

2436
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:27,500
What?

2437
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,380
I thought you guys were a safe town.

2438
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:30,980
So safe.

2439
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,100
Can I shoot these?

2440
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:48,760
Can I shoot these guys?

2441
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,940
Sure I brought...

2442
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:57,440
Okay, look.

2443
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,840
They should not be scared about people stealing stuff.

2444
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,940
There's less things to worry about right now.

2445
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,960
That should be the least of their worries.

2446
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:05,900
People stealing.

2447
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,240
I mean I'm not stealing.

2448
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,300
I'm a government worker.

2449
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,100
I'm a government worker.

2450
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,600
That doesn't count.

2451
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:13,840
I'm a government worker.

2452
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,960
Let's see...

2453
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:23,900
Oh, I don't know.

2454
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,780
I feel like there might be somebody over here.

2455
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:31,080
Aim but with knife equipped then use knife to stab.

2456
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,100
Okay, you guys see it as if it's so easy.

2457
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,300
They're not innocent.

2458
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,060
Oh, fuck.

2459
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,140
Oops, sorry.

2460
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,260
Wait, what?

2461
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:50,040
Why am I...

2462
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:50,800
What?

2463
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,260
Why am I instantly aiming?

2464
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,020
What the fuck?

2465
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,060
No, my two bullets!

2466
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,160
What?

2467
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:59,180
Why did I shot?

2468
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,600
I just right clicked.

2469
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,380
What happened?

2470
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,740
I right clicked, guys.

2471
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:10,220
I swear.

2472
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:10,720
I swear.

2473
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,740
Wait, what?

2474
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,180
What's going on?

2475
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:18,280
I can't...

2476
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,140
How do I...

2477
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:20,280
My third bullet!

2478
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:21,160
How do I...

2479
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,980
How do I get rid of it?

2480
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:27,580
Okay.

2481
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,240
Okay.

2482
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:30,560
Okay, I fixed it.

2483
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,060
Okay, that was weird.

2484
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,120
That was...

2485
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:34,800
Oh, oh, oh!

2486
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,120
Hello?

2487
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:37,960
Can I...

2488
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,880
I'm gonna stab him with my butter knife.

2489
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,880
Oh, okay, never mind.

2490
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:43,700
Whoa!

2491
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:44,660
Shit!

2492
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,000
Okay.

2493
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:47,520
Don't worry.

2494
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,140
Thick thighs save lives!

2495
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:51,860
Nice.

2496
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,740
How the fuck...

2497
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,700
Oh, yeah, my...

2498
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,320
You know what?

2499
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,840
No, my thighs are like really...

2500
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,580
My thighs...

2501
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:01,060
My legs are just that strong.

2502
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,920
I was gonna say, how the fuck was he not able to cut it with his...

2503
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,300
fucking axe, but I can like stomp it?

2504
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,080
I was like, what?

2505
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:14,240
He had an axe!

2506
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,780
That's just Leon's power.

2507
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,840
Oh, now I have my flashlight.

2508
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,360
The skill diff right there.

2509
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,880
I was like so confused.

2510
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,820
Wait, oh, is that Ashley?

2511
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,720
Yeah, that's Ashley.

2512
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,380
I can't shoot it.

2513
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,780
I had to make sure.

2514
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,800
You're not Ashley!

2515
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,920
Oh, you're the other guy!

2516
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,380
You're the guy people wish Leon was.

2517
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:49,740
I'm sorry.

2518
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:50,160
I didn't want to talk.

2519
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,760
How observant, senor.

2520
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,660
Now, say, you got a smoke?

2521
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,560
And all those things will kill you.

2522
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:59,320
Oh, well, maybe just untie me then, huh?

2523
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,420
Oh, no, it's a chainsaw man.

2524
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:06,500
Wait, who are you?

2525
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,160
Stop right there.

2526
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,180
Oh!

2527
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,640
Oh, God!

2528
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,120
Please!

2529
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,260
Not the legs!

2530
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,480
Only torso up!

2531
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,460
Torso up, please!

2532
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:20,320
Torso up!

2533
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,280
Oh, shit.

2534
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,360
Pro lives.

2535
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:28,440
Oh, shit.

2536
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:28,500
Oh, shit.

2537
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:28,920
Oh, shit.

2538
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,620
Chapter end!

2539
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:31,780
Nice!

2540
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,980
Okay, what's my results?

2541
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:36,740
I got...

2542
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,660
I performed a stealth kill.

2543
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:39,640
Oh, I did all of that!

2544
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,300
Appearance that everything changes.

2545
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,820
Oh, I did everything.

2546
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,360
Nice.

2547
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:48,260
Okay.

2548
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,580
Shift.

2549
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:51,800
Save game.

2550
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:56,700
Okay.

2551
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:57,660
Nice.

2552
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,280
It's okay.

2553
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,240
I need someone better than Ashley.

2554
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:12,340
Who the fuck are you?

2555
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:18,260
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say he looked like...

2556
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,380
Queen Elizabeth II's husband.

2557
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,300
May he rest in peace.

2558
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,860
I like how everyone was like, Adam Sandler.

2559
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,540
Not expecting that.

2560
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,380
It was like, Adam Sandler?

2561
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,620
And then I'm like...

2562
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:52,880
Him.

2563
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,060
No, no.

2564
01:42:59,240 --> 01:42:59,740
That's good.

2565
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,480
The jacket's gone.

2566
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:01,740
Now he can see my games.

2567
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,660
Wait, his name is actually Adam Sandler?

2568
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,560
Whoa, that's awfully close, man.

2569
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:14,800
We're bros, right?

2570
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,980
Bro, it's just... Whoa!

2571
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:35,300
Oh!

2572
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,300
It's okay, bro.

2573
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,080
Oh my god!

2574
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,640
Bro, are we like best friends now?

2575
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:48,660
Oh my god, bro.

2576
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,580
Do you feel this?

2577
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,160
Do you feel this chemistry right now, bro?

2578
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,000
Oh shit!

2579
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:02,080
That's how fast male friendships go.

2580
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,300
Bro.

2581
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,860
I know like male best... like...

2582
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:09,660
Male friends is basically like...

2583
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,680
You don't know any details about their personal lives...

2584
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,060
But they're there for you, bro.

2585
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,560
When guys are best friends...

2586
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,420
And then they're like...

2587
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:21,800
You know...

2588
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,860
What's his family life now, right now?

2589
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,340
And you're like...

2590
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:24,940
I don't know, bro.

2591
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,780
But we're gonna be playing some fucking Call of Duty later on on Friday.

2592
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:31,860
True, bro.

2593
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,900
It's like, what's his job?

2594
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:36,300
Bro, I don't fucking know.

2595
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,980
But his IGN is like...

2596
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:38,280
Uh...

2597
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:40,940
Major Hawk.

2598
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:46,980
Bro, so true.

2599
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:55,480
Yo, my stuff!

2600
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:57,700
I hoarded so many items!

2601
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,560
Don't know who their names are.

2602
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,360
They're just my bro.

2603
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:10,260
Wait, I should take this chain and like...

2604
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,540
And then use the chain as a fucking whip.

2605
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:12,660
I don't know.

2606
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,400
Wait, where's my bro?

2607
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:15,520
Bro, he already left me, bro?

2608
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:17,220
Bro!

2609
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,300
It's fucked up, bro.

2610
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:24,720
At least I have my herbs.

2611
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:26,460
Oh, no.

2612
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:29,780
Bro, he already left me?

2613
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,400
What the fuck?

2614
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:33,740
I thought we're homies!

2615
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:39,800
I didn't know the real name of one of my friends until two years later...

2616
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,000
Because everyone called him by his nickname.

2617
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:42,960
Bro.

2618
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:45,260
Thank you for the super chat.

2619
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,440
Thank you, thank you, Alan.

2620
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,580
Bro, left me.

2621
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,420
Yo, not the stealth, bro.

2622
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:54,820
Oh, nice.

2623
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:55,640
My kitchen knife.

2624
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:58,760
You can perform a wide swinging slash.

2625
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:02,020
You can also do quick slash with space.

2626
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:02,860
Okay.

2627
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:04,900
I'll be like...

2628
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:05,520
Ha ha!

2629
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:06,500
Wait.

2630
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:07,080
Ha.

2631
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:07,580
Wait.

2632
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:08,280
Ha.

2633
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:08,640
Ha!

2634
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,820
Okay, there you go.

2635
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:10,580
Thanks, bro.

2636
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,840
I hate this.

2637
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:12,760
Why did they make this stuff?

2638
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:13,180
Was this...

2639
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:14,460
Was this in the original game?

2640
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:16,280
I don't remember this.

2641
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,160
Khan, thank you for the tent.

2642
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:20,840
Give the ships.

2643
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:21,180
Thank you.

2644
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:21,760
Thank you.

2645
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:24,960
This sucks.

2646
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:30,600
I must have like deleted this portion from my mind.

2647
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:34,220
Bro.

2648
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:38,640
I definitely don't remember this.

2649
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:42,500
Okay.

2650
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,860
If you sneak behind...

2651
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:44,840
Oh, I've already done that before.

2652
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:46,540
Hello.

2653
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,400
Shh.

2654
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:51,240
Shh.

2655
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,080
I'm trying to find my bro.

2656
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,220
Nice.

2657
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,920
Another kitchen knife.

2658
01:46:58,020 --> 01:46:59,440
Have you seen him?

2659
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,240
What's this?

2660
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,280
That's my stuff!

2661
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,820
Where's my stuff?

2662
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:08,540
Where's my jacket.

2663
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:09,480
Oh, my.

2664
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,260
What the fuck?

2665
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,100
I should be wearing shorts.

2666
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:20,040
Oh, look, turn around.

2667
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:24,160
Oh, he did not turn around, guys.

2668
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,280
Guys, I don't think he turned around.

2669
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:32,600
Nice.

2670
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,140
I did it.

2671
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,680
Nice, you did it.

2672
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:48,220
Yay!

2673
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:50,240
Oh, wait.

2674
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:50,900
Okay.

2675
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,300
You have a knife.

2676
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,180
You're British now!

2677
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:02,060
London Simulator, Jesus Christ.

2678
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:03,480
You have a knife.

2679
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:03,760
Wow!

2680
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,500
Well, I never needed to know that, apparently.

2681
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:08,920
You have a knife.

2682
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,500
You can parry an attack with space.

2683
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:14,060
When a prompt appears in the bottom right corner, you can successfully...

2684
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,080
parry if you press it before the prompt appears.

2685
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,640
Time it right and an enemy will be...

2686
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:21,640
Wow, that was...

2687
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:22,920
That would have been good to know earlier.

2688
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:24,600
Um, well...

2689
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:25,820
I beat him.

2690
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,380
I killed him.

2691
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,520
So, it's fine.

2692
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,780
Okay, even if you press it before the prompt, time it right and then...

2693
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:34,000
Okay.

2694
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,040
Okay.

2695
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,860
You need to time this right.

2696
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:38,100
Okay.

2697
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,960
How do I do this?

2698
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:43,840
Okay.

2699
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,320
Oh, I did it.

2700
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,800
Oh my god, I'm learning.

2701
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:50,760
Oh my fucking god.

2702
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,420
Can't open this.

2703
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:54,180
No!

2704
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:55,820
My gear!

2705
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:57,980
Leon!

2706
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,080
Kick him with your fucking legs!

2707
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,020
You used this...

2708
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:03,480
Oh, wait.

2709
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,120
Can I kill this rat?

2710
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:06,120
Okay.

2711
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,440
Walk on it.

2712
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,420
Nice and more kitchen dives.

2713
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:13,000
What I've always wanted.

2714
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,880
How the fuck do I get my shit?

2715
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,000
Give me my stuff!

2716
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,720
Give it to me!

2717
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,480
Let me in!

2718
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:38,580
Let me in!

2719
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,820
Okay, I can't get it.

2720
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:48,470
Did I get caught?

2721
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:49,690
Don't worry, I have this window.

2722
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:53,910
I don't think I got caught, there's no way.

2723
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:55,990
There's no way.

2724
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,810
He's just talking to his friend.

2725
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:02,150
There's no way, I have this window.

2726
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:05,470
See, I told you, I didn't get caught!

2727
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,360
Okay, where is he?

2728
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:13,560
Oh, there he is.

2729
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,000
There's no way he's gonna turn around.

2730
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:22,060
Turn around, ba da da da da da da da da da.

2731
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,640
Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet!

2732
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:37,980
Okay, nice.

2733
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,260
Alright, thank you for the money.

2734
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:43,980
Just gonna mug him real quick.

2735
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:47,060
Alright.

2736
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:48,640
Open.

2737
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,340
Okay, nothing here.

2738
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,220
Oh, I can open this.

2739
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,040
Hello.

2740
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,160
My gun!

2741
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,600
I'll never use a knife ever again.

2742
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,480
Oh god.

2743
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:05,660
Oh god.

2744
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:07,040
I gotta go fast.

2745
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,400
Please Leon!

2746
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:11,160
Your legs!

2747
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:14,940
Leon!

2748
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:16,320
Oh god.

2749
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,080
Nice!

2750
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,200
Okay, I got all my stuff.

2751
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,980
I'll never have to use my knife ever again.

2752
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,060
I'll be taking these back.

2753
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:25,940
Nice.

2754
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:27,380
Okay.

2755
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,620
And then unlock here.

2756
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,800
And I don't have a key.

2757
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:34,400
Where the fuck are the keys?

2758
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:38,880
Where are the keys?

2759
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:41,500
Okay, let's craft this real quick.

2760
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:42,380
Wait, actually...

2761
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:46,460
I'm just gonna put this...

2762
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:47,280
Wait, what?

2763
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:47,920
What's this?

2764
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,160
Is this my storage?

2765
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:50,900
What is this?

2766
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:52,780
What is this?

2767
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:56,840
What is this?

2768
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,120
Is that storage?

2769
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,120
I don't know what this is.

2770
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,100
This is trash?

2771
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:04,780
Okay.

2772
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,220
That's the ground?

2773
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,100
Okay.

2774
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:10,600
Why the fuck does it look like a case?

2775
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:12,600
How was I supposed to know that?

2776
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:14,220
Crap.

2777
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,360
I need shotgun shells.

2778
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:16,720
Bye, god.

2779
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,140
Alright, yeah, it's more space.

2780
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:20,600
Let's put this here.

2781
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,780
Tetris.

2782
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,400
Whoa!

2783
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:36,680
Friend!

2784
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:40,680
Hello?

2785
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,220
Mr. Merchant?

2786
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:43,220
Stranger.

2787
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,580
Who's that?

2788
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,400
That's your new best friend!

2789
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,040
Your new bro!

2790
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,520
Let's do some business then.

2791
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:55,200
What's this?

2792
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:56,900
Get rid of the rats that take...

2793
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,320
We don't know they're carrying any beret...

2794
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:58,800
Oh, hey!

2795
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,760
Wait, I can go back and get rid of the rats.

2796
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,140
I should have got rid of the rats earlier.

2797
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:07,220
Guys, I could have got rid of them earlier.

2798
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,640
I know there's one of you right here.

2799
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:12,260
Come on, get over here.

2800
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,120
Get over here.

2801
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:14,640
Come on.

2802
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:15,320
Come on.

2803
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:15,880
I'm gonna shank you.

2804
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:16,600
Come on.

2805
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:17,780
Let me shank you.

2806
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:19,920
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

2807
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,700
Fuck, I think I need to shoot it.

2808
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:25,480
He's too fast.

2809
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,460
He's too fast.

2810
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:28,820
Oh my god.

2811
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:30,120
Oh my god, look at him go!

2812
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:31,100
Please.

2813
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,040
Walk into my crosshair.

2814
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:33,720
Bro!

2815
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,820
Bro, he's so fast!

2816
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,380
Okay, he's gonna tire himself out.

2817
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:42,720
There we go.

2818
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,080
I should have just done that.

2819
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:47,380
I should have just laid for him to tire himself out.

2820
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,700
I should have just laid for him to tire himself out.

2821
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:50,260
There you are.

2822
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,680
Okay, let me walk away from you.

2823
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:54,320
Where are you?

2824
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,780
Alright, tire yourself out.

2825
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,980
Come on, tire yourself out.

2826
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:58,780
There we go.

2827
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,200
Where's the last rat?

2828
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:00,900
Oh, there you are.

2829
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:03,720
Alright.

2830
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,340
Alright, come on!

2831
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,880
You're gonna waste up all your energy!

2832
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,320
That sugar's gonna die down!

2833
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:09,040
There you go.

2834
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:09,800
Nice.

2835
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:10,220
Yes.

2836
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:14,540
Yeah.

2837
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,660
New York experience!

2838
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:19,000
Alright, done.

2839
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,160
I got the rats.

2840
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:23,800
Yeah, I did.

2841
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,760
What are you selling?

2842
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,100
Trading?

2843
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,220
But you didn't say the thing!

2844
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,000
Merchant request.

2845
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:37,480
Once you've completed a task received from blue request note, you can claim the reward by talking to the merchant.

2846
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:38,960
Yeah!

2847
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,780
You've proven yourself reliable.

2848
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,020
I did it!

2849
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:44,700
Yeah!

2850
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,460
I swear to God, the bullets were more...

2851
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,480
That's not...

2852
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:54,660
He didn't say the thing.

2853
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:57,260
He didn't say the thing.

2854
01:54:57,580 --> 01:55:00,200
He didn't say the thing.

2855
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,720
Wait, but he didn't say the thing.

2856
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,460
Wait, but he didn't say the thing.

2857
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:05,560
Oh, I need to fix my knife.

2858
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:05,760
Yeah.

2859
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:08,120
$4000?!

2860
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:10,520
Bro!

2861
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:11,300
Bro!

2862
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,560
Who gives a fuck about my knife?!

2863
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,920
I'm gonna sell shit right now.

2864
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,720
He has a no large can be sold.

2865
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,560
Bro!

2866
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,020
I'm just...

2867
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,700
I'll just use my kitchen knife!

2868
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,460
Why should I fucking...

2869
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:36,320
Bro, why should I fix it when I have perfectly good kitchen knives?

2870
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:42,920
It'll be worth it.

2871
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:43,440
It'll be worth it.

2872
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,860
Okay, let me sell this first.

2873
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,700
Okay, I'm gonna sell these two.

2874
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:48,600
And...

2875
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,200
I don't need this, right?

2876
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:50,780
Yeah.

2877
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,620
That is not usable anymore.

2878
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:55,700
It's not the same.

2879
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,500
It's not the same.

2880
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,240
Welcome to capitalism.

2881
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:06,300
I'm gonna sell some of my fucking kitchen knives.

2882
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:06,900
Alright.

2883
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:09,500
Can I sell this key now?

2884
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,200
I don't remember.

2885
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:14,860
The racking will be the most discheesed with you.

2886
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:18,720
Airway Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

2887
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,520
Thank you, thank you.

2888
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:24,880
I won't need a parry if I have my gun!

2889
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,080
Alright, so I think I got everything I need.

2890
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:31,220
Boop!

2891
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:34,180
Okay, two... FINE!

2892
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,200
God, that was a lot of money.

2893
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:36,280
I'm gonna sell this.

2894
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:38,540
Okay.

2895
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:41,440
Durability?

2896
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:42,320
Right?

2897
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,760
You want me to...

2898
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,520
You want me to increase the durability?

2899
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,920
Okay, this is time.

2900
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,120
This is time for you to shine.

2901
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,240
This is backseat time.

2902
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:55,440
Durability?

2903
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,780
Okay, durability.

2904
01:56:59,160 --> 01:56:59,740
What else?

2905
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:01,400
What else do we need, guys?

2906
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,520
What else should we...

2907
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,280
There's durability?

2908
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:06,300
Oh, I thought that was my fucking gun.

2909
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,380
I was like, there's no fucking way there's durability on gun.

2910
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:10,320
Case upgrade?

2911
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:11,140
Okay.

2912
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,000
Where is case upgrade?

2913
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:14,740
Bye?

2914
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,320
Okay, case upgrade.

2915
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,740
I have enough money for that.

2916
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:19,320
Alright, case upgrade.

2917
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:21,620
Alright, what else?

2918
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,460
What else do I need to upgrade, guys?

2919
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:28,940
Wait, I can trade the spinels?

2920
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,260
What do I trade it for?

2921
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:32,560
Oh!

2922
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:32,920
Oh!

2923
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,020
Get the Punisher?

2924
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,600
How have we procured these curiosities?

2925
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:40,700
Do I need that?

2926
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,300
I don't need that.

2927
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,060
I have you guys.

2928
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,240
The rifle?

2929
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,160
Do you get the scope free with the rifle?

2930
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:47,160
Is the rifle that good?

2931
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:49,860
This one?

2932
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:53,360
I don't have space for it.

2933
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,080
Is it that good?

2934
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,720
Is it actually that good?

2935
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,300
No, I meant the rifle.

2936
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,480
Is this the rifle?

2937
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:00,920
Yeah.

2938
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:01,920
Yes?

2939
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:02,400
Okay.

2940
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:02,820
Fine.

2941
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:03,500
I'll do it.

2942
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:04,420
Okay, let me like...

2943
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:06,500
I need to fix up my suitcase first.

2944
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,180
Give me a sec.

2945
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,360
I need to fix up my suitcase.

2946
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,520
Let me... Let me fix this up.

2947
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:13,500
Okay, storage.

2948
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,440
Okay, we can...

2949
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,240
Okay, let's put away...

2950
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:20,080
How do I put away this?

2951
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:20,620
Shift?

2952
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:22,060
Uhhh...

2953
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:23,080
Shit.

2954
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:23,400
Okay.

2955
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:24,380
Get in.

2956
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:28,660
No!

2957
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:30,280
Fuck!

2958
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,700
Okay!

2959
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:31,980
I didn't realize...

2960
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:32,980
I didn't realize that I was dragging it!

2961
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:34,020
No!

2962
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,260
My green herbs!

2963
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:40,660
Okay, I learned that dragging it turns it into...

2964
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:44,980
Dragging it turns it into like... Yeah, I learned that today.

2965
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,780
I wonder if this fits...

2966
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:48,580
Does this fit?

2967
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:50,520
Does this fit?

2968
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:53,020
I don't... How big is that fucking...

2969
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,500
How big is it?

2970
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:55,840
How big is it?

2971
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,580
Customized case.

2972
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,420
How do I take you to the storage?

2973
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,540
How do I take you to the storage?

2974
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:04,900
Oh, auto sort?

2975
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:07,660
No, what does the auto sort do?

2976
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:09,400
Oh...

2977
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:12,220
Just buy and use auto sort.

2978
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:12,540
Okay.

2979
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:13,720
Alright.

2980
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,520
I'm gonna buy now.

2981
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,080
Okay.

2982
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,060
I should have enough.

2983
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,020
Just make sure...

2984
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:22,180
Just make your space...

2985
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:23,100
Okay.

2986
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:25,080
Okay.

2987
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,980
This is awkward.

2988
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:27,980
Okay, I can...

2989
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:28,900
I figured this out.

2990
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,700
Oh, I can... Oh, I know!

2991
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:31,600
I know.

2992
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:33,120
Okay.

2993
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,280
Oh, what the fuck?

2994
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:34,900
This is easy!

2995
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:36,140
I'll just put this up here.

2996
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:38,700
Wait, what?

2997
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,720
I can't drag this?

2998
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:42,300
Oh, okay.

2999
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:43,220
God damn it.

3000
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:44,040
I'm so stupid.

3001
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,960
I can't read.

3002
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:51,520
God, how do I function as a person sometimes?

3003
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,160
Look at all my kitchen knives though.

3004
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:57,340
There you go.

3005
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:57,640
Yay!

3006
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,380
Ba-da-dum.

3007
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:05,200
Ba-dum-bum-bum-bum.

3008
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:06,400
Do I have ammo for this gun?

3009
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:07,680
Wait a minute.

3010
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:09,820
Yes!

3011
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,160
I did it!

3012
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,520
Pull it straight through their heads!

3013
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,060
Yeah, we do not have ammo.

3014
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:20,400
Oh!

3015
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,700
Thank you!

3016
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:22,540
I got a scope!

3017
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,180
Yes.

3018
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:29,540
Thank you.

3019
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:31,220
That's how you keep your customers!

3020
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,460
Alright, I have no money now.

3021
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:34,420
Now I'm actually broke.

3022
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:36,360
Can I like, buy ammo?

3023
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,140
Do you have ammo for me?

3024
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,840
I don't know if he has ammo.

3025
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,040
No, he does not.

3026
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,200
Okay.

3027
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,160
What's both?

3028
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,080
Losing resources and...

3029
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:47,760
No, I don't.

3030
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,160
Guys, he doesn't have ammo, guys.

3031
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:51,240
He does not have ammo.

3032
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:55,240
I don't have... Do I have money for the...

3033
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:55,780
Oh, wait.

3034
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:56,120
This one?

3035
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:58,340
Alright.

3036
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:01,680
Okay.

3037
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,520
Our map is updated now.

3038
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:05,380
Oh!

3039
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:07,120
I see!

3040
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:10,060
Locked drawer, treasure, treasure.

3041
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,300
Okay, I see.

3042
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:12,780
Nice.

3043
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:13,080
Oh!

3044
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:13,600
Free ammo!

3045
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:16,580
Dino, thank you for the super chat!

3046
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,280
Thank you, thank you!

3047
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:20,360
Also defeats the purpose of a Tetris inventory system.

3048
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:21,700
Think of the principles!

3049
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:24,420
Good thing I couldn't figure it out!

3050
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:27,020
Because I didn't realize it was hold, alt.

3051
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:28,260
Hahaha!

3052
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:31,360
That's your streamer!

3053
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,480
I didn't figure out you were supposed to hold alt key!

3054
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:35,620
Hahaha!

3055
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:39,500
So I had to do it the real way!

3056
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:43,440
You know you can trade this to another to receive as a reward for valuable goods?

3057
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,760
Oh, that's cool!

3058
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:47,320
There we go.

3059
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:50,000
Nice.

3060
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:51,580
Alright.

3061
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:52,320
What's this?

3062
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:55,540
Hexagon shaped slot, treasure...

3063
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,260
Which way do I go?

3064
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:56,700
Okay.

3065
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,840
Oh my god, it's all...

3066
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:00,980
The objective is all over there!

3067
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:05,020
The eagle...

3068
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:07,940
When will I ever need to use...

3069
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:09,660
I guess I'll use my rifle for bosses.

3070
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,840
And the little guys...

3071
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:13,540
The little guys will be used for...

3072
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:15,380
That's my streamer!

3073
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:15,920
Hahaha!

3074
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:18,380
I'll use the pistol for the little guys.

3075
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,740
There's no way I'm using...

3076
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,800
Wait a minute.

3077
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:25,800
There's no way I'm using the rifle...

3078
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:26,240
I'm using the pistol.

3079
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,420
Oh, we have to attach the scope?

3080
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:28,560
Where the fuck... Oh, I do!

3081
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:31,180
Bam.

3082
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:32,480
There we go.

3083
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,080
Attached.

3084
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:40,600
Get closer!

3085
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:42,440
Get closer!

3086
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:43,380
That's right!

3087
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:44,980
There we go.

3088
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,560
Get closer!

3089
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:48,580
I don't want you to waste my legs!

3090
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,280
Oh shit, I accidentally...

3091
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:51,440
Get closer!

3092
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:52,140
There we go.

3093
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:53,340
Nice!

3094
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:54,200
Come on!

3095
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:54,900
You're almost there!

3096
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,520
Nice, I don't have to waste my knife on you.

3097
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:01,620
Nice, I don't have to waste my knife on you.

3098
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:02,120
That's good.

3099
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:03,160
Thank you, Granny!

3100
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,500
Are there any bear traps?

3101
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:06,260
No bear traps.

3102
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:07,300
Oooh!

3103
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:09,040
I don't like this.

3104
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:12,200
This doesn't seem very stable!

3105
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:15,720
Oh, what's that?

3106
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,400
What's that?

3107
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:19,240
What's that?

3108
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,200
Okay, I'm gonna go down.

3109
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:26,020
Hey guys!

3110
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:30,280
I don't know if this is stable or not.

3111
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:33,220
Oh, look at all these grannies!

3112
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,580
Look at all these grannies over there!

3113
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:39,600
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3114
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,780
It's okay, they don't know where I am.

3115
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:43,320
Right?

3116
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,100
Okay, that's fucked up that I missed.

3117
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:46,940
No, he doesn't know!

3118
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:47,200
See?

3119
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:48,600
He's so confused!

3120
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:50,240
Oh!

3121
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:51,540
Goodbye!

3122
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:53,900
Look at them!

3123
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:54,920
Goodbye, Granny!

3124
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,000
Thank you, Granny!

3125
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,500
Don't worry!

3126
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:59,000
There's like inflatable balloons down there!

3127
02:03:59,200 --> 02:03:59,340
Don't worry!

3128
02:03:59,340 --> 02:03:59,340
There's like inflatable balloons down there!

3129
02:03:59,340 --> 02:03:59,880
It's like up!

3130
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:04,960
Can you walk down the stairs for me?

3131
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:05,340
Can you walk down the stairs for me?

3132
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:07,980
Oh my god, not that slow though.

3133
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:09,120
It's okay.

3134
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:11,520
There you go.

3135
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:12,640
Easy.

3136
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,160
Wait, are they not gonna walk up to me?

3137
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:18,040
Why would I use rifles?

3138
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:20,620
Rifles are so expensive ammo!

3139
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:25,000
If I can shoot them with a handgun like this, If I can shoot them with a handgun like this, I don't need the rifle.

3140
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:27,940
Okay, not like that though.

3141
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,880
Oh, now I missed!

3142
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:39,320
I hit every single shot earlier.

3143
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:43,120
But now that I get a little cocky, I start missing.

3144
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,240
I see...

3145
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,620
Oh, fuck you!

3146
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:54,200
Okay, where is...

3147
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,580
I need a fucking...

3148
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,160
Let me equip...

3149
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:59,900
Register this as a shortcut real fast.

3150
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:01,840
Alright, I've had enough.

3151
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:04,740
I've had enough.

3152
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,960
Alright, dude, fuck this guy though.

3153
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:09,940
There you go.

3154
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:12,520
Alright.

3155
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,480
Okay, I don't need to use the rifle on her though.

3156
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:19,440
Watch.

3157
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,520
Alright, here you go.

3158
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:26,300
There, see?

3159
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:28,180
I can do this.

3160
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,400
I'm not wasting my fucking ammo.

3161
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:32,780
I'm not wasting my fucking ammo.

3162
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:34,180
Guys, I can...

3163
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:34,800
Look, see?

3164
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:38,440
For some reason, that guy didn't work.

3165
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:40,080
But first...

3166
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:43,020
Oh my god, that was like the only person I missed shots on.

3167
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:44,860
Everybody else I've hit.

3168
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:53,660
Guys, pistol ammo isn't wasting ammo!

3169
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:56,340
They're so fucking...

3170
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:58,740
It's so easy to find pistol ammo!

3171
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:02,300
Why is the wind so big now?

3172
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,740
Is it because I killed everybody?

3173
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:05,980
Are they mad?

3174
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:09,600
Why is the wind mad at me?

3175
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:13,380
Why is the wind mad at me?

3176
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:16,780
What did I do?

3177
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:18,980
Alright.

3178
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,340
Why is there boss music?

3179
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:23,960
Guys, what did I do?

3180
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:25,340
I don't want to drop down.

3181
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:29,120
The wind god is angry at you.

3182
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,320
There's nobody up top though.

3183
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:32,960
Oh, okay.

3184
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:33,580
The wind stopped.

3185
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:35,920
I don't want to go down.

3186
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:36,520
I'm scared.

3187
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,400
What the fuck were you?

3188
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:43,440
Bro, he just ran at me.

3189
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:51,410
Okay, there.

3190
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:52,870
Oh!

3191
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:53,210
Shit.

3192
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:54,570
There you go.

3193
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:56,570
Nice.

3194
02:06:58,130 --> 02:06:59,290
I don't like this.

3195
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:00,870
I don't like this.

3196
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:02,450
Oh, what the fuck!

3197
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:07,020
Oh shit, I didn't realize there were more!

3198
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:08,620
Oh!

3199
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:12,240
There are so many!

3200
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:14,260
What?

3201
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:18,740
Okay.

3202
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:20,860
No wonder the wind gods were mad.

3203
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:22,900
Okay.

3204
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:24,920
Okay.

3205
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:28,280
That's a good casualty.

3206
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:30,420
Oh god.

3207
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:31,040
This is fine.

3208
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:32,800
This is fine.

3209
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,920
This is so fine.

3210
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,280
Did you see that though?

3211
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:39,380
Okay.

3212
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:43,260
Oh shit!

3213
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:44,620
Oh shit!

3214
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:46,220
No!

3215
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,260
Now they're grabbing me!

3216
02:07:48,580 --> 02:07:49,360
Please let me go!

3217
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:50,660
Okay.

3218
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:52,440
Here we go.

3219
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:55,460
There we go.

3220
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,240
Okay, it's fine.

3221
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:57,720
We're fine.

3222
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:58,180
We're fine.

3223
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:58,640
We're fine.

3224
02:07:58,660 --> 02:07:59,100
We're fine.

3225
02:07:59,120 --> 02:07:59,540
Woo!

3226
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:00,740
That's fine.

3227
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:04,640
We're fine.

3228
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,000
We're fine.

3229
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:09,210
It's fine.

3230
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:12,870
There we go.

3231
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:13,130
See?

3232
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:13,990
Not a waste!

3233
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:14,770
Not a waste!

3234
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,510
Not a waste!

3235
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,630
I got my ammo back.

3236
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,710
I got my ammo back, guys.

3237
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:20,930
It's not a waste.

3238
02:08:22,030 --> 02:08:23,330
Please, let me in.

3239
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:24,110
Woo!

3240
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:27,190
Please don't tell me this is never ending.

3241
02:08:27,890 --> 02:08:28,610
Please don't tell me this is never ending.

3242
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:33,410
Guys, I swear to god, is this...

3243
02:08:33,410 --> 02:08:34,250
Guys, I swear to god, is this...

3244
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:35,750
I swear, does this end?

3245
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:36,630
Does this end?

3246
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,390
Does this end?

3247
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:44,150
I hear a lot.

3248
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:45,070
I hear a lot.

3249
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:49,970
This is never ending?

3250
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:50,610
This is

3251
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:54,630
never ending?

3252
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:55,770
What do you mean?

3253
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:57,870
Let me in.

3254
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:58,770
Let me in.

3255
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:00,010
Let me in.

3256
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:00,690
Oh, hey, but...

3257
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:03,130
Let me in.

3258
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:04,230
Let me in.

3259
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:09,840
Let me in.

3260
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:14,440
I didn't realize this is never ending!

3261
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:18,300
I didn't realize this is never ending!

3262
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:18,820
I wasted so much!

3263
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:22,920
Please.

3264
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:23,720
Please.

3265
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:24,900
Oh, god.

3266
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:26,380
Oh, god.

3267
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,800
Where am I?

3268
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:29,500
Ah!

3269
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:30,640
Good.

3270
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:32,560
God damn it!

3271
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,220
Okay, I'm okay!

3272
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:36,800
Ah!

3273
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,480
You were too fast!

3274
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:41,960
My knife!

3275
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:46,380
It's okay.

3276
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:48,480
Everything is fine!

3277
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:50,900
Fuck off.

3278
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:54,800
Oh, god.

3279
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:55,440
Oh, god.

3280
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:56,000
Thighs.

3281
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:56,380
Thighs.

3282
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,380
Your... toes.

3283
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,260
Fucking fuck me up now!

3284
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:02,140
It's fine.

3285
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:02,620
We're fine.

3286
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,080
We're fine.

3287
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:03,520
We're fine.

3288
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:03,920
We're fine.

3289
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:04,300
We're fine.

3290
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:04,760
We're fine.

3291
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:05,700
We're fine.

3292
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:06,160
We're fine.

3293
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:06,600
We're fine.

3294
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,860
Where's the ladder?

3295
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:10,780
Wait!

3296
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:12,240
There's no ladder here?

3297
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:17,620
Guys, I didn't realize there was no ladder.

3298
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:19,400
I thought there was.

3299
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:24,380
Guys, you think this is a choice?

3300
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,260
With me running in circles?

3301
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:27,780
With me running in circles?

3302
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:28,780
I'm literally panicking!

3303
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:33,820
Alright, that's fine.

3304
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:34,460
We're okay.

3305
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:36,060
We're okay.

3306
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:40,580
Oh, god.

3307
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:43,020
Oh, god.

3308
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:46,560
There's so many!

3309
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:47,680
Oh!

3310
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:50,020
Sheik!

3311
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:50,660
Sheik!

3312
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:51,560
Sheik!

3313
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,040
Sheik!

3314
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:52,300
Sheik!

3315
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:53,560
Oh, no!

3316
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:54,620
Oh, no!

3317
02:10:58,760 --> 02:10:59,460
Oh, god!

3318
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:01,000
Okay, we're fine.

3319
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:01,580
We're fine.

3320
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:02,820
We're fine.

3321
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:03,360
We're fine.

3322
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:03,920
We're fine.

3323
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:04,820
We're fine.

3324
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:07,160
Everything is fine.

3325
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:10,340
Oh, god.

3326
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:12,280
Oh, god.

3327
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:12,280
Oh!

3328
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:12,400
Nice!

3329
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:14,900
Did you guys see that parry, though?

3330
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:15,680
Did you guys see that parry, though?

3331
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:19,340
It's okay.

3332
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:20,140
It's okay.

3333
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,080
It's okay.

3334
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:21,880
It's okay.

3335
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:24,460
Woooo!

3336
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:26,960
Where am I?

3337
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:30,040
Drop down, Leon!

3338
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:32,100
Drop down!

3339
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:39,800
Please!

3340
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:43,500
Alright.

3341
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:48,000
Alright, here we go.

3342
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:55,760
Okay, up top we go, up top we go, up top we go!

3343
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:59,060
And then... we just shoot them off the ladder.

3344
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:02,140
Who has it?

3345
02:12:03,820 --> 02:12:04,680
Okay, it's fine.

3346
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,600
It's okay.

3347
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:10,320
Is there anybody on the ladder?

3348
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:11,800
Here we go.

3349
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:13,800
Guard the ladder!

3350
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:15,580
Guard the ladder!

3351
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:17,740
The ladder's shot!

3352
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:22,520
Guard the ladder!

3353
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,080
It's fine.

3354
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,640
They can't get me up on the ladder!

3355
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:36,840
It's the ladder shot!

3356
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:42,710
They can't get up!

3357
02:12:42,770 --> 02:12:44,010
There's one ladder!

3358
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:49,190
I only have four bullets.

3359
02:12:49,330 --> 02:12:50,450
Oh no, they're getting up!

3360
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:51,970
They're getting up, guys!

3361
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:53,430
I fucked up!

3362
02:12:59,270 --> 02:12:59,830
Okay.

3363
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:02,930
It's fine.

3364
02:13:06,510 --> 02:13:08,570
I... It's not fine, guys.

3365
02:13:09,570 --> 02:13:11,990
This is... Is it fine?

3366
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:13,630
Are we good now?

3367
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:15,670
Are we...

3368
02:13:15,670 --> 02:13:17,470
Are we okay?

3369
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:20,410
Are... Are we...

3370
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:22,930
Are we okay?

3371
02:13:25,370 --> 02:13:26,130
Guys!

3372
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:27,110
It's okay!

3373
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:28,370
We don't need the pistol!

3374
02:13:28,590 --> 02:13:29,550
It's okay!

3375
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:32,370
It's fine!

3376
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:34,690
It's fine.

3377
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:35,390
We...

3378
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:38,470
This is exactly why we don't play hardcore.

3379
02:13:38,890 --> 02:13:41,570
This is exactly why.

3380
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:44,690
This is exactly why.

3381
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:49,170
There we go.

3382
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:52,130
This is one of the big reasons.

3383
02:13:56,390 --> 02:14:02,530
This is exactly why Doki cannot do hardcore.

3384
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:05,650
Okay, here we go.

3385
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:06,510
We're going to grab...

3386
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:10,470
The amount of resources that I took.

3387
02:14:11,950 --> 02:14:12,830
Boom.

3388
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:13,490
Boom.

3389
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:14,290
Boom.

3390
02:14:14,290 --> 02:14:14,670
Boom.

3391
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:15,250
Alright.

3392
02:14:15,370 --> 02:14:15,850
We're good.

3393
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:17,410
Everything is fine now.

3394
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,670
We...

3395
02:14:18,670 --> 02:14:20,090
We survived.

3396
02:14:20,510 --> 02:14:21,190
It...

3397
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:23,730
So it wasn't never ending.

3398
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:25,050
So that was a lie!

3399
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:27,490
That was a fucking lie!

3400
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:30,270
Whoever said this was never ending!

3401
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:31,870
There was an end!

3402
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:35,050
There was...

3403
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:37,450
Thank fucking god there was an end!

3404
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:41,490
Alright.

3405
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:41,970
Hello.

3406
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:43,710
Is there any loot here?

3407
02:14:45,410 --> 02:14:45,990
Hello?

3408
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:47,790
I went through so much.

3409
02:14:48,370 --> 02:14:50,310
God, I went through so much.

3410
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:52,590
Guys, please, where are the loot?

3411
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:54,450
Boof.

3412
02:14:54,770 --> 02:14:55,350
Boof.

3413
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:56,370
Okay.

3414
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:59,130
Just gonna make sure I...

3415
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:02,590
Make sure all these doors can be opened.

3416
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:04,050
Whoop.

3417
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:05,090
Hello?

3418
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:06,950
Oh hey!

3419
02:15:07,130 --> 02:15:08,710
There's a little chest here!

3420
02:15:09,410 --> 02:15:10,470
Oh there's a key!

3421
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:12,050
What does this key do?

3422
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:15,890
Okay, I can go up though.

3423
02:15:16,930 --> 02:15:17,950
Open the locker?

3424
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:19,670
Alright, get jumpscared in 3, 2, 1.

3425
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,870
Oh.

3426
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:21,350
Okay.

3427
02:15:23,210 --> 02:15:23,890
That's cool.

3428
02:15:25,890 --> 02:15:27,090
Alright, thank god.

3429
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:31,610
Missing...

3430
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:34,310
Hexagon.

3431
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:35,850
Oh, I got the hexagon emblem.

3432
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:39,030
The item that I was supposed to get.

3433
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:40,830
Okay.

3434
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:44,650
Where the fuck is the key supposed to go?

3435
02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:46,850
More lockers?

3436
02:15:47,110 --> 02:15:48,210
Did I miss out more?

3437
02:15:49,450 --> 02:15:51,090
Is there more lockers down there?

3438
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,510
Oh.

3439
02:15:52,510 --> 02:15:53,390
Oh there is.

3440
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:55,150
Jumpscare in 3, 2, 1.

3441
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:56,790
See?

3442
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:58,310
Look at that guys!

3443
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:02,070
It's like I didn't waste all my handgun ammo.

3444
02:16:02,950 --> 02:16:03,470
See?

3445
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:06,750
See?

3446
02:16:10,070 --> 02:16:11,270
Alright, let's see.

3447
02:16:11,310 --> 02:16:11,730
Oh there's more.

3448
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:12,130
See?

3449
02:16:12,270 --> 02:16:12,830
There's more!

3450
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,950
I didn't get punished!

3451
02:16:19,370 --> 02:16:20,210
Look at that!

3452
02:16:21,370 --> 02:16:22,410
Not punished.

3453
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:24,490
Got more handgun ammo.

3454
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:25,450
Look at that!

3455
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:28,210
Wait, what?

3456
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:30,270
I heard somebody over there?

3457
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:33,630
What?

3458
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:35,550
Hey, did you guys see that?

3459
02:16:36,470 --> 02:16:37,050
Where?

3460
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:41,070
What the fuck?

3461
02:16:41,090 --> 02:16:42,330
Where did you come from?

3462
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:47,740
Where did you come from lady?

3463
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:53,070
All your fucking family's dead!

3464
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:56,750
Where did you come from?

3465
02:16:56,810 --> 02:16:56,990
No!

3466
02:16:57,090 --> 02:16:57,770
The fire!

3467
02:16:57,950 --> 02:16:58,930
My ambience!

3468
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:05,610
Bro, she's late to the party!

3469
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:08,350
Her husband died like 10 minutes ago!

3470
02:17:11,870 --> 02:17:12,470
Bro!

3471
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:14,510
She's so fashionably late!

3472
02:17:16,890 --> 02:17:17,770
What the fuck?

3473
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:19,370
Where did she come from?

3474
02:17:19,530 --> 02:17:20,590
Oh shit!

3475
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:24,490
Where did she come from?

3476
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:27,210
Jeez!

3477
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:30,950
Thanks for lighting that though.

3478
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:33,090
Nice, we got the ruby.

3479
02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:33,710
Did I use the key?

3480
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:36,550
Wait, did I just use the key?

3481
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:37,750
For that?

3482
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:38,890
I did, right?

3483
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:43,190
That was the key, right guys?

3484
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:46,370
No?

3485
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:48,990
She was also sleeping in.

3486
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:54,390
The key is for the small drawers?

3487
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:55,630
Where is the key though?

3488
02:17:55,790 --> 02:17:56,690
Where do I use it?

3489
02:17:58,490 --> 02:18:00,110
I already opened everything here.

3490
02:18:01,470 --> 02:18:02,430
Uh, yeah.

3491
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:03,150
Got everything.

3492
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:04,890
I need to loot her body though.

3493
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:06,930
Let me climb up that ladder.

3494
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:10,470
A small locked drawer?

3495
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:11,770
Where the fuck is that?

3496
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:12,510
There were so many.

3497
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:14,530
Oh my gosh, thank god.

3498
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:16,350
I got the ammo I wanted.

3499
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:17,530
I wasted on those two ladies.

3500
02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:22,210
I passed by money?

3501
02:18:22,530 --> 02:18:22,890
No.

3502
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:24,930
No, we can't let that happen.

3503
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:32,470
Back at the- Oh no, I have to fucking go all the way back there?

3504
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:38,560
Alright, I did it.

3505
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:40,020
I killed everybody in the village.

3506
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,280
It's alright guys.

3507
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:44,340
I did a good thing today.

3508
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:45,980
Hello.

3509
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:47,200
Take a look.

3510
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:49,560
Save game.

3511
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:56,900
Alright.

3512
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,640
I think I can afford to- Oh, I cannot.

3513
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:00,380
I'm so broke.

3514
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:00,900
Nevermind.

3515
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,140
Wait, I can!

3516
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:03,780
Okay.

3517
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:04,600
Guys.

3518
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:08,880
I feel like I can upgrade my gun.

3519
02:19:15,380 --> 02:19:17,120
Guys, not gonna lie.

3520
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:19,660
But like, I don't know.

3521
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:20,520
What do you think?

3522
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:23,080
The investment on the power of my weapon.

3523
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:23,540
My pistol.

3524
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:24,820
Yeah?

3525
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,340
Is it worth it?

3526
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:30,120
No, I actually need actual advice.

3527
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:31,860
Is it actually worth it?

3528
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:32,600
Yeah?

3529
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:33,480
Okay.

3530
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:35,180
It's worth it?

3531
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:35,700
Okay, power.

3532
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:36,100
Alright.

3533
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:37,480
I mean, I've been fucking using that.

3534
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:40,320
I've been fucking shooting people in the head.

3535
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:42,280
There is a better one?

3536
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:43,220
There is a better one?

3537
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,500
What do you mean?

3538
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:47,600
There's a better free gun?

3539
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:51,500
Not worth it long run?

3540
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:51,820
Okay.

3541
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:52,660
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

3542
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:53,820
Okay.

3543
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:55,120
Do I just not do it?

3544
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:56,840
Wait until we get a better free gun?

3545
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:58,580
I can sell it better?

3546
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:00,240
Not seeing anything you like, stranger.

3547
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:02,960
Okay, but when do I get the better pistol?

3548
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:03,500
What chapter?

3549
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:04,440
Okay.

3550
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,440
Guys, I need to know.

3551
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:09,680
What chapter do I get the better free gun?

3552
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:18,720
Worth it now?

3553
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:19,080
Okay.

3554
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:21,640
People are saying it's worth it now.

3555
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:22,900
In like two...

3556
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:25,120
Okay, I'm fucking investing in this.

3557
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:27,440
I'm investing this.

3558
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,600
You guys said in one to three.

3559
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:31,540
In like chapter three or four.

3560
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:32,300
And I'm like, yeah.

3561
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:34,140
No, we're fucking investing this.

3562
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:35,140
You guys don't even know.

3563
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:39,500
That's way later.

3564
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:40,360
Exactly.

3565
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:43,760
Okay, we're gonna fucking open up the chest.

3566
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,920
Wherever that is.

3567
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:46,460
What is this?

3568
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:46,740
Here?

3569
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:47,440
The lock...

3570
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:47,880
Oh, there it is.

3571
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:48,340
The locked drawer.

3572
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:49,360
Yeah, there it is.

3573
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:52,500
Nice.

3574
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:53,580
Boom.

3575
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:57,560
What's this?

3576
02:20:57,820 --> 02:20:58,520
It's a mask.

3577
02:20:58,860 --> 02:20:59,920
Can I sell this?

3578
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:03,220
This is also...

3579
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:06,060
There must be another treasure over there too.

3580
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:09,180
Okay.

3581
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:10,680
It's okay.

3582
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:11,700
I can make my money back.

3583
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,780
There's a treasure right here.

3584
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:18,660
Right?

3585
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:20,480
Like here?

3586
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,640
Oh, I did open this.

3587
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:24,280
Nice.

3588
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:25,000
There's a sapphire.

3589
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:30,760
We might be able to find another of those like pots thing that we can use to double the value.

3590
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:32,840
Nice.

3591
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:35,340
Yeah, we need to find the pot though.

3592
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:37,520
So we can double the value of this.

3593
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:42,300
All right.

3594
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:43,820
So...

3595
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,760
Oh, I can add it on the mask.

3596
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:47,940
Nice.

3597
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:48,460
All right.

3598
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:51,180
Key items.

3599
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,400
I'll just do it now.

3600
02:21:53,620 --> 02:21:54,100
Anything...

3601
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:54,700
Gems.

3602
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:55,140
Okay.

3603
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:57,300
Red, blue, yellow.

3604
02:21:57,400 --> 02:22:00,120
If I find red, blue, yellow, I can get one point.

3605
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:00,460
Okay.

3606
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:03,240
I'm going to see what gems I can get before I add it.

3607
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:04,020
Yeah.

3608
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:05,560
I'm going to see what gems I can get.

3609
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:07,660
All right.

3610
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:08,180
Save.

3611
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:09,140
Daniel!

3612
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:10,860
Welcome to the tomato farm!

3613
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:11,500
Welcome, welcome!

3614
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:14,520
All right.

3615
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:16,020
Put that eagle in.

3616
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:18,760
Oh, I have to rotate it?

3617
02:22:20,620 --> 02:22:21,440
I don't know.

3618
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:27,230
Oh.

3619
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:31,100
Oh.

3620
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:32,460
Oh!

3621
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:34,560
Oh!

3622
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:35,520
I see!

3623
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:39,650
Oh!

3624
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:41,050
Okay.

3625
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:42,870
There you go.

3626
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:44,970
I didn't realize I could turn it around.

3627
02:22:45,310 --> 02:22:45,590
Okay.

3628
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:45,950
I see.

3629
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:47,090
I can see it now.

3630
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:48,030
I see.

3631
02:22:49,930 --> 02:22:51,950
I definitely see.

3632
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:54,250
There you go.

3633
02:22:57,580 --> 02:22:58,860
Open sesame.

3634
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:00,040
Okay.

3635
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:00,400
Okay.

3636
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:00,500
Okay.

3637
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:00,560
Okay.

3638
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:01,940
I can see it now.

3639
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:02,840
Where's Ashley?

3640
02:23:03,220 --> 02:23:03,640
Oh.

3641
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:04,420
Wait.

3642
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:05,560
I can stealth now.

3643
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:07,100
My kitchen knife.

3644
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:08,700
This is it.

3645
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:12,140
This is what my kitchen knife is for.

3646
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:14,240
Stop walking.

3647
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:15,640
Stop walking.

3648
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:16,900
Stop walking.

3649
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,240
Stop walking.

3650
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:18,500
There.

3651
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:19,060
Oh!

3652
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,200
What the fuck was that?

3653
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:21,300
Oh!

3654
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:22,400
Oh!

3655
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,040
Oh!

3656
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:23,760
Oh!

3657
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:25,280
Shit!

3658
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:25,940
Okay.

3659
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:27,200
Okay.

3660
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:28,800
That's awkward.

3661
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,520
Where did this man come from?

3662
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:34,520
Oh!

3663
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:36,340
Oopsie!

3664
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:40,180
No, ma'am.

3665
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:41,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

3666
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:44,460
That was a little awkward though.

3667
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:45,920
That was...

3668
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:46,160
Whoops!

3669
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:48,560
Hey, don't turn.

3670
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:49,020
Don't turn.

3671
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:49,460
Don't turn.

3672
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:49,800
Nice.

3673
02:23:49,940 --> 02:23:50,220
Oh!

3674
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:50,480
No!

3675
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:51,060
Fuck!

3676
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,780
I just saw it.

3677
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:55,160
God damn it!

3678
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:57,120
Okay.

3679
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:57,520
It's fine.

3680
02:23:57,660 --> 02:23:58,140
It's fine.

3681
02:23:58,180 --> 02:23:58,620
It's just...

3682
02:23:58,620 --> 02:23:58,780
Oh!

3683
02:23:58,800 --> 02:23:59,920
Just a little flesh wound.

3684
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:01,640
Just a little...

3685
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:02,240
God damn it!

3686
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:03,920
Thank you for the 50 gifted chests!

3687
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:04,480
Thank you!

3688
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:05,100
Thank you!

3689
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:06,660
I appreciate it!

3690
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:07,480
Thank you so much!

3691
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:08,860
It was worth it.

3692
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:10,320
It was worth it.

3693
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:13,820
Can't believe crouch was E.

3694
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:15,520
It's okay.

3695
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:19,580
Man, I think with all these areas, I was definitely supposed to stealth.

3696
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:21,140
Whoops.

3697
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:23,140
Does this work?

3698
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:23,860
Oh, nice.

3699
02:24:24,140 --> 02:24:24,660
Sapphire.

3700
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:25,500
Wait.

3701
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:28,780
Do I have two sapphires?

3702
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,620
Okay.

3703
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:31,800
What was the combo?

3704
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:32,680
Okay.

3705
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:36,960
Oh, if I had two gemstones of the same color.

3706
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:38,600
Oh.

3707
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:41,880
Oh, okay.

3708
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:42,620
Never mind.

3709
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:43,660
If I had three...

3710
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:44,140
Wait.

3711
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,660
Three of the same color though.

3712
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:47,040
Let me find another blue gem.

3713
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:50,540
Let me find another blue sapphire.

3714
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,040
Oh!

3715
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:51,620
Resource.

3716
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:58,280
Who the fuck crouches with some sick fuck that thinks actually it's important?

3717
02:24:58,420 --> 02:24:58,760
Oh, okay.

3718
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:01,960
I'm not sure.

3719
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:03,960
Let me make sure.

3720
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,380
Oh, I missed out on the bullets.

3721
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:06,680
Oh, my bullets.

3722
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,480
Ammo!

3723
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,100
Where's the ammo?

3724
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:11,840
Where is it?

3725
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:12,920
Ammo?

3726
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:14,000
Oh, there it is.

3727
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:14,920
Nice!

3728
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:18,420
Okay.

3729
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:19,540
I need a...

3730
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:24,360
Let me like craft some ammo real quick.

3731
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:26,020
Oh!

3732
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:26,580
Okay.

3733
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:27,960
We need rifle ammo.

3734
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:28,760
That's pretty cool.

3735
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:28,960
For sure.

3736
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:31,040
And then do we have enough for shotgun?

3737
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:31,920
No.

3738
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:32,560
Okay.

3739
02:25:33,220 --> 02:25:35,360
Let's just put this here.

3740
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:37,400
And then...

3741
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:40,500
Just Tetris this just a little bit.

3742
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:41,280
It's fine.

3743
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:43,180
Let me just eat an egg.

3744
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,100
A small amount.

3745
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:45,900
You know what?

3746
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:47,520
One egg wouldn't hurt.

3747
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,440
Alright.

3748
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:50,100
We're good.

3749
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:53,360
We're gonna find more eggs anyway.

3750
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:54,460
What if I shoot a crow?

3751
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:57,220
Can I get like a bonus?

3752
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:59,160
Oh my god!

3753
02:25:59,220 --> 02:25:59,840
Crows get loot!

3754
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:02,480
Oh my god!

3755
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:06,380
A hundred dollar... a hundred and fifty dollars.

3756
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:08,020
That's like an AKKA right there.

3757
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:09,580
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

3758
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:10,440
Thank you, thank you!

3759
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:12,200
That's right.

3760
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,080
I know you have money inside you now.

3761
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:23,980
Now I know no bird is safe anymore.

3762
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:26,620
No crow is safe.

3763
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:30,700
The money crow.

3764
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:32,120
The legends were true!

3765
02:26:32,660 --> 02:26:33,880
The money crow!

3766
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,060
Wait, where's your money?

3767
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:36,620
What the fuck?

3768
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:37,840
How come you don't have money?

3769
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:40,400
I got scammed.

3770
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,900
One bullet is very expensive.

3771
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:46,900
The fuck was my money crow?

3772
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:49,420
Oh god.

3773
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:53,460
Oh okay.

3774
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:57,560
Nice.

3775
02:26:57,620 --> 02:26:58,420
Okay, not a waste.

3776
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:00,020
Herb.

3777
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:02,620
The influence is not what it once was.

3778
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:04,120
Destroy the wine up doll.

3779
02:27:04,220 --> 02:27:06,040
Do not forgive those aristocrats.

3780
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:06,540
Oh no.

3781
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,180
Bourgeoisie versus the potterette.

3782
02:27:10,580 --> 02:27:11,100
Wait.

3783
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:12,700
Is that what they're called?

3784
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:19,840
It's been a while since university.

3785
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:22,740
Okay.

3786
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:24,560
Boop!

3787
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:26,340
Alright.

3788
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:30,900
Spin over.

3789
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:31,580
Oh gunpowder.

3790
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:32,140
We need that.

3791
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:33,020
Wait, I can make the shotgun!

3792
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:34,120
Right?

3793
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:35,140
Is it 12?

3794
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:37,380
Oh no, it's 12.

3795
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:38,400
I cannot make it.

3796
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:42,540
They got everything?

3797
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,140
No, there's so much loot here.

3798
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:46,460
What else is there?

3799
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:47,200
Treasure?

3800
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:49,940
Where's the treasure?

3801
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:52,600
Do I shoot this?

3802
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:56,040
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah!

3803
02:28:00,340 --> 02:28:01,280
No, they don't.

3804
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:02,180
What do you mean?

3805
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:03,840
There's nobody behind me.

3806
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:04,260
Okay.

3807
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:06,060
Wait a minute.

3808
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:06,380
Woah!

3809
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:07,320
Wait, is that Chasel?

3810
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:08,260
Is that Chasel?

3811
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:09,160
Is that...

3812
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:09,360
Oh!

3813
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:10,100
Fuck!

3814
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:10,520
Okay.

3815
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:11,380
It's okay.

3816
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:14,660
This is what it's for.

3817
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:17,460
This way.

3818
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,440
Can I kill him?

3819
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:20,800
Can he be...

3820
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:21,060
Okay.

3821
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:22,740
Guys, before I waste more ammo.

3822
02:28:23,020 --> 02:28:24,220
Can he be killed?

3823
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:25,640
Can he be killed?

3824
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:26,920
Can he be killed?

3825
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:29,100
Can he be killed?

3826
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:29,700
Can he be killed?

3827
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,540
Okay, that's good enough.

3828
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:35,900
Chainsaw Man, please!

3829
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:36,880
I need a reload!

3830
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,180
Chainsaw Man!

3831
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:41,000
Okay.

3832
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:43,760
Okay, that's good.

3833
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:44,820
That's good.

3834
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:49,260
Oh, thank god.

3835
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:50,200
Okay, there we go.

3836
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,540
There we go.

3837
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:54,060
Yes, we did it!

3838
02:28:56,580 --> 02:28:57,700
Oh, we did it.

3839
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:58,460
Alright, that's good.

3840
02:28:58,460 --> 02:28:59,260
That's good.

3841
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:03,880
Thank god for them stopping to let me check my chat.

3842
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,840
Okay, we should be able to make this now, right?

3843
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,400
Yeah!

3844
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,880
Alright, nice.

3845
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:12,340
And then here.

3846
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:13,980
And then here.

3847
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:15,140
What?

3848
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:17,840
What?

3849
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:19,760
What?

3850
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:22,320
Oh, it's circular.

3851
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,300
I'm so fucking stupid.

3852
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:24,700
Yellow.

3853
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:26,960
Not the...

3854
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:28,080
Guys.

3855
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:31,180
The square shape goes in the...

3856
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,720
Okay, sorry.

3857
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:38,260
I don't know my shapes as well, guys.

3858
02:29:39,560 --> 02:29:41,300
I'm just a little special.

3859
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:43,400
I don't know my shapes.

3860
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:44,600
Where is that?

3861
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:47,440
There's like loot somewhere here.

3862
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,920
See that?

3863
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:51,180
I'm standing where loot is.

3864
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:57,090
I'm looking up.

3865
02:29:58,860 --> 02:29:59,450
To this?

3866
02:30:01,930 --> 02:30:02,430
Oh!

3867
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:04,810
God, I'm so smart.

3868
02:30:05,450 --> 02:30:06,770
I looked up, guys.

3869
02:30:08,470 --> 02:30:09,830
Guys, I looked up.

3870
02:30:11,470 --> 02:30:13,010
Okay, we got it.

3871
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:15,830
Oh, close the hatch?

3872
02:30:15,970 --> 02:30:16,090
What?

3873
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:16,670
You can do that?

3874
02:30:17,670 --> 02:30:18,170
Oh.

3875
02:30:24,190 --> 02:30:27,090
How was I supposed to know you can close this?

3876
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:31,620
It's okay.

3877
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:32,460
It's still money.

3878
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,760
Now you got your circle.

3879
02:30:36,180 --> 02:30:36,600
No!

3880
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:37,960
It's ruined!

3881
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:42,460
It's okay.

3882
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:43,300
It's okay.

3883
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:43,740
Just...

3884
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:45,180
It's okay.

3885
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,180
Just a little mistake.

3886
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:48,960
It's fine.

3887
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:51,020
Alright, let me...

3888
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:52,480
Is this Ashley?

3889
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:54,320
Ashley?

3890
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:56,340
It definitely made this longer.

3891
02:30:56,340 --> 02:31:00,100
I swear it did not take this long to fucking find Ashley.

3892
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:05,460
They definitely made this game much longer than the first original.

3893
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:07,880
Wait.

3894
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:09,580
This trap is being used.

3895
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:10,940
Reload the save.

3896
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,740
I'm not gonna reload the save.

3897
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:13,600
Chat.

3898
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:16,480
Girl, thank you.

3899
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:17,240
The super chat.

3900
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:17,620
Thank you.

3901
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:19,840
Take the loot.

3902
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,820
Just don't shoot me.

3903
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:21,540
It's too late.

3904
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:22,640
It's too late.

3905
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:24,520
Now that I know you have money inside.

3906
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:25,940
It's too late.

3907
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:27,460
What if you fucking...

3908
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:28,680
What if you're like...

3909
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:31,160
Holding out on me, huh, crew?

3910
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:37,410
What if you try to hold out on me?

3911
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:40,470
Facts.

3912
02:31:40,690 --> 02:31:41,810
Thank you for the super chat.

3913
02:31:41,870 --> 02:31:42,150
Thank you.

3914
02:31:42,170 --> 02:31:42,690
Thank you.

3915
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:46,410
I don't like this.

3916
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:48,970
Can I go from outside?

3917
02:31:50,050 --> 02:31:50,870
Oh, I need a key.

3918
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:55,710
Maybe I can like...

3919
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:57,030
Set these back.

3920
02:31:57,070 --> 02:31:57,370
No?

3921
02:31:57,970 --> 02:32:00,270
Why are some traps like on and some aren't?

3922
02:32:00,590 --> 02:32:01,110
It's weird.

3923
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:06,490
Okay, I've learned.

3924
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:11,780
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3925
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:13,040
You can't catch me this time.

3926
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:14,860
That's fucking right.

3927
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,520
I figured it out.

3928
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,880
You can't catch me now.

3929
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:21,380
Oh my god, that scared me for some reason.

3930
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:23,200
Hello?

3931
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:24,880
Hello?

3932
02:32:24,980 --> 02:32:25,700
Any bear traps?

3933
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:27,560
Boop.

3934
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:30,240
Any bear traps?

3935
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:32,220
Any bears?

3936
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:34,320
Okay, there's two...

3937
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:36,480
There's two treasures inside.

3938
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:39,500
Thank you for the five gift of ships.

3939
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:39,860
Thank you.

3940
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:40,420
Thank you.

3941
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:41,840
I really appreciate it.

3942
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:43,880
Hello?

3943
02:32:48,670 --> 02:32:49,410
I'm sorry.

3944
02:32:49,710 --> 02:32:50,390
It's the

3945
02:32:57,520 --> 02:32:58,200
toilet...

3946
02:32:58,900 --> 02:32:59,520
Oh, no.

3947
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:02,400
Chainsaw man 2.0.

3948
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:05,560
Lord Kurosu, thank you for the Akasupa.

3949
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:06,200
Thank you.

3950
02:33:06,220 --> 02:33:06,880
Thank you.

3951
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:08,220
Toilet bed.

3952
02:33:08,380 --> 02:33:09,400
We meet again.

3953
02:33:10,700 --> 02:33:12,560
It's like things never change.

3954
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:16,180
Wait, you meant crows were holding out on you?

3955
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:17,900
Oh, well, take my money anyway.

3956
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:19,700
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3957
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:20,240
Thank you.

3958
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:20,820
Thank you.

3959
02:33:21,580 --> 02:33:22,760
I'm not too shabby.

3960
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:25,760
Someone has shown up their neighbors.

3961
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:28,520
Just like... just like before.

3962
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:32,720
Oh, what's wrong with...

3963
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:33,900
Why did you scratch their faces?

3964
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:36,000
It's messed up.

3965
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,360
I'll rotate the other way though.

3966
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:41,620
Oh, I can't look at the back?

3967
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:42,120
Okay.

3968
02:33:42,320 --> 02:33:43,560
I guess I didn't want to.

3969
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:46,200
This is...

3970
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:46,580
Key!

3971
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:48,140
Nice.

3972
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:50,100
Got my key.

3973
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:52,560
What's this treasure?

3974
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:55,740
Oh?

3975
02:33:56,940 --> 02:33:57,420
Okay.

3976
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:01,340
Oh, Q and E?

3977
02:34:01,820 --> 02:34:02,300
Okay.

3978
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:03,960
No, I can just spin it.

3979
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:06,260
No, I meant turn it.

3980
02:34:06,340 --> 02:34:08,200
I want to turn the photo to the back.

3981
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:08,340
Okay.

3982
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:14,520
It's nice to know Toilet Man is still there.

3983
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:15,320
Oh.

3984
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,500
Um...

3985
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,420
What is this puzzle?

3986
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:22,320
What the fuck is this puzzle?

3987
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:25,940
Is it from this one photo?

3988
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:29,540
Is this...

3989
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:30,800
Oh, there it is!

3990
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,620
It's left click!

3991
02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:34,960
God, this is the worst though.

3992
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:38,620
At last, flesh of our flesh, blood of our blood.

3993
02:34:38,620 --> 02:34:39,940
Give thanks and rejoice.

3994
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:41,180
Okay.

3995
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:42,380
That was useless anyway.

3996
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:46,060
Alright.

3997
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:48,960
Where do we do this puzzle?

3998
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:51,660
Oh!

3999
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:52,380
Oh!

4000
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:53,560
Wait.

4001
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:54,760
Let me reread that.

4002
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:55,520
Sorry.

4003
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:56,960
My memory is not that great.

4004
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:01,100
I'm only good at remembering parking spaces.

4005
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:03,200
Like where we park and stuff.

4006
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,160
What is it?

4007
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:07,060
Flesh of our flesh, blood of our blood.

4008
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:07,700
Oh, I see.

4009
02:35:08,220 --> 02:35:09,980
Give thanks and rejoice.

4010
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:13,020
Wait.

4011
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:13,320
What?

4012
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:15,660
Flesh of our flesh, blood of our...

4013
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:15,960
Oh, sorry.

4014
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:18,440
Can I just like kick the thing like always?

4015
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:21,340
That doesn't make sense.

4016
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:24,240
Flesh of our flesh, blood of our blood?

4017
02:35:24,820 --> 02:35:25,780
This is not a clue.

4018
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:26,720
That's not the clue.

4019
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:28,200
I need to keep looking.

4020
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:29,520
Oh, it's here.

4021
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:30,940
Oh, it's a hand grenade.

4022
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:32,080
I can barely see it.

4023
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:34,740
Where did we find the clue?

4024
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:38,000
Oh.

4025
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:38,200
I found it.

4026
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:39,920
Let's see if I can find a clue.

4027
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:40,580
Oh, doesn't matter.

4028
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:41,160
Gunpowder.

4029
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:42,620
Alright.

4030
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:44,400
Craft shotgun ammo.

4031
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:45,880
I need that for sure.

4032
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:51,720
Oh, that doesn't matter.

4033
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:54,560
Howie...

4034
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:55,360
Who does...

4035
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:56,280
Puzzle...

4036
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:58,320
The other photos?

4037
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:01,400
That photo doesn't make sense.

4038
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:01,740
Wait.

4039
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:02,620
Isn't that the...

4040
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:03,900
Oh, I thought that was the...

4041
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:06,760
Oh, it's upstairs.

4042
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:07,360
Okay.

4043
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:08,160
Okay.

4044
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:11,560
Make sure there's nothing here.

4045
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,780
Nice, chicken egg.

4046
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,420
Is that in the oven?

4047
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:19,500
Why is there a chicken egg in the oven?

4048
02:36:20,220 --> 02:36:21,000
Ma'am!

4049
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:23,900
I'm not gonna judge you, but ma'am!

4050
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:25,660
Alright, hello?

4051
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:29,080
I think my bro is up here.

4052
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:31,400
I'm pretty sure.

4053
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:32,320
Oh, herbs!

4054
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:34,160
I can combine this.

4055
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:35,420
Nice.

4056
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,340
Okay, safe.

4057
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:44,180
Alright, here we go.

4058
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:04,780
Oh, that's it!

4059
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:06,040
Wait, what was it?

4060
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:08,300
Sorry.

4061
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:09,440
Crop pig baby.

4062
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:11,260
Okay, we got this.

4063
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:13,600
Crop pig baby.

4064
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:16,280
Crop pig...

4065
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:17,260
Wait, why am I saying that loud?

4066
02:37:17,360 --> 02:37:17,980
You guys can tell me.

4067
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:23,180
Crop... pig...

4068
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:23,960
baby.

4069
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:26,180
Nice.

4070
02:37:28,120 --> 02:37:29,120
Ooh, what's this?

4071
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:30,680
Crystal marble.

4072
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:31,800
That's it?

4073
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:36,420
I should be able to steal all these other things inside the drawer and sell it to the...

4074
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:37,700
Sell it to the...

4075
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:38,360
Fucking...

4076
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,220
Let's see...

4077
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:44,740
Wow!

4078
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:45,900
Zap!

4079
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:46,460
Zap!

4080
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:46,940
Zap!

4081
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:47,280
Zap!

4082
02:37:49,290 --> 02:37:50,450
Oh, shit!

4083
02:37:50,730 --> 02:37:51,670
My kitchen knife!

4084
02:37:53,470 --> 02:37:56,770
Okay, I thought... I didn't realize he was the mutated guy.

4085
02:37:57,170 --> 02:37:58,650
I didn't realize.

4086
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:00,950
It's okay, I have so many kitchen knives.

4087
02:38:02,970 --> 02:38:03,530
Hey...

4088
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:04,870
No, that's not the poop man.

4089
02:38:05,050 --> 02:38:05,690
That can't be!

4090
02:38:06,130 --> 02:38:07,150
There's no way!

4091
02:38:07,150 --> 02:38:07,230
Hey!

4092
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:09,470
Did the poop man mutate?

4093
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:12,950
Is that actually you?

4094
02:38:13,150 --> 02:38:13,990
Oh my god!

4095
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:14,730
It's the poop man!

4096
02:38:15,230 --> 02:38:16,210
Is that gold?

4097
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:18,530
It is him!

4098
02:38:20,410 --> 02:38:22,530
I knew I should have double shanked.

4099
02:38:25,830 --> 02:38:26,890
God damn it.

4100
02:38:26,970 --> 02:38:27,910
My one mistake.

4101
02:38:28,310 --> 02:38:29,610
I didn't double tap.

4102
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:32,010
Okay, save.

4103
02:38:32,910 --> 02:38:35,610
I'm just gonna be paranoid saving this entire time.

4104
02:38:38,190 --> 02:38:38,950
Alright, hello!

4105
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:42,890
Oh, it was... I can't sell this.

4106
02:38:45,030 --> 02:38:45,850
Wait, what?

4107
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:48,130
Oh.

4108
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:50,070
I hate this though.

4109
02:38:50,530 --> 02:38:52,370
I hate this so much.

4110
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:52,950
There we go.

4111
02:38:53,090 --> 02:38:53,890
Should be it.

4112
02:38:53,970 --> 02:38:54,450
Wait, what?

4113
02:38:54,630 --> 02:38:55,350
This should be it.

4114
02:38:55,890 --> 02:38:56,710
No, it's not.

4115
02:38:56,870 --> 02:38:57,330
Okay.

4116
02:38:58,490 --> 02:38:59,550
I hate this.

4117
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:02,050
Wait, this should be it.

4118
02:39:04,910 --> 02:39:05,370
Right?

4119
02:39:05,470 --> 02:39:05,590
Oh, I'm gonna die.

4120
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:06,450
No.

4121
02:39:07,310 --> 02:39:07,830
No.

4122
02:39:07,830 --> 02:39:08,930
I hate this.

4123
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:09,430
What?

4124
02:39:09,850 --> 02:39:11,590
This is so sad.

4125
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:14,870
Okay.

4126
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:18,490
Okay, this should be it.

4127
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:19,790
Oh, this should be it!

4128
02:39:20,250 --> 02:39:21,050
There we go.

4129
02:39:22,810 --> 02:39:23,330
Nice.

4130
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:25,350
I'm smarter than a child.

4131
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:30,190
October 10th.

4132
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:32,030
The weather has been strange of late.

4133
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:34,790
The wheat withers and the cows grow thin.

4134
02:39:35,610 --> 02:39:36,670
December 8th.

4135
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:37,910
There are signs of famine.

4136
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:39,090
It is true.

4137
02:39:39,370 --> 02:39:41,590
We lack the means to work the fields.

4138
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:44,070
But Lord Saddler's orders are absolute.

4139
02:39:45,630 --> 02:39:46,950
January 30th.

4140
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:49,070
Thirty people have starved to death.

4141
02:39:49,450 --> 02:39:51,570
Five cows will be slaughtered.

4142
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:53,370
March 11th.

4143
02:39:53,370 --> 02:39:55,870
The patriarchs gather to cast lots.

4144
02:39:55,930 --> 02:39:58,870
Six more chosen for Lord Saddler.

4145
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:02,330
April 8th.

4146
02:40:02,330 --> 02:40:02,950
More today.

4147
02:40:03,310 --> 02:40:04,270
Four more today.

4148
02:40:04,270 --> 02:40:05,950
Eleven more today.

4149
02:40:06,910 --> 02:40:10,170
Two outsiders got lost and wandered into the village.

4150
02:40:10,370 --> 02:40:12,430
We took them to the altar for the ritual.

4151
02:40:12,790 --> 02:40:14,550
No need to cast lots today.

4152
02:40:15,430 --> 02:40:16,030
Oh.

4153
02:40:16,030 --> 02:40:16,630
Alright.

4154
02:40:16,910 --> 02:40:18,390
So it's like the lottery system.

4155
02:40:19,030 --> 02:40:19,630
Yay!

4156
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:22,990
Oh, there he is.

4157
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:23,830
Aww.

4158
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:28,890
Oh, I thought he would like fucking show up.

4159
02:40:30,970 --> 02:40:31,570
Okay.

4160
02:40:31,630 --> 02:40:32,750
Oh, the insignia key!

4161
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:34,090
What's that for?

4162
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:34,430
No!

4163
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:35,610
I forgot to take the bullets!

4164
02:40:35,890 --> 02:40:36,270
No!

4165
02:40:37,410 --> 02:40:38,370
Bring me back!

4166
02:40:38,410 --> 02:40:39,010
Bring me back!

4167
02:40:41,650 --> 02:40:42,210
No!

4168
02:40:42,210 --> 02:40:42,770
No!

4169
02:40:42,770 --> 02:40:43,690
My handgun!

4170
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:51,460
No!

4171
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:57,260
Oh!

4172
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:04,350
Bro?

4173
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:06,530
Oh wait!

4174
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,090
Ada?

4175
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:12,820
That's not my bro.

4176
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:14,220
Not my bro.

4177
02:41:27,910 --> 02:41:29,570
I can't believe it.

4178
02:41:30,830 --> 02:41:32,010
Where's my bro?

4179
02:41:34,830 --> 02:41:36,330
Where's my best friend?

4180
02:41:40,250 --> 02:41:40,930
Alright.

4181
02:41:40,930 --> 02:41:42,010
Chapter results.

4182
02:41:42,510 --> 02:41:43,590
Oh, we got a lot.

4183
02:41:44,410 --> 02:41:45,090
Yay!

4184
02:41:45,230 --> 02:41:45,670
Money!

4185
02:41:47,670 --> 02:41:48,350
Nice.

4186
02:41:49,550 --> 02:41:51,730
81% accuracy.

4187
02:41:52,310 --> 02:41:53,230
You guys are good.

4188
02:41:53,330 --> 02:41:54,670
I think that's pretty good.

4189
02:41:54,730 --> 02:41:54,930
I think that's pretty good.

4190
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:56,910
I'm pretty sure you guys are like, not 100%.

4191
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:58,030
Not my streamer.

4192
02:42:00,410 --> 02:42:01,710
Not my gamer.

4193
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:08,810
I've got that intel you requested on Louis Serra.

4194
02:42:08,910 --> 02:42:11,630
It seems he used to be a researcher for Umbrella.

4195
02:42:12,110 --> 02:42:12,550
Umbrella?

4196
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:15,310
I should have left him in that bag to rot.

4197
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:18,150
I'm sending you the details.

4198
02:42:18,690 --> 02:42:19,470
Take a look.

4199
02:42:19,710 --> 02:42:23,530
I saw a mod where you can like change Leon into Wesker.

4200
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:24,070
You can play...

4201
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:26,090
You can just play as Wesker.

4202
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:27,710
Please.

4203
02:42:27,790 --> 02:42:29,470
When will I see Ashley?

4204
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:31,530
That's all I want.

4205
02:42:33,990 --> 02:42:34,610
What's this?

4206
02:42:35,850 --> 02:42:36,290
Ashley?

4207
02:42:44,570 --> 02:42:45,010
Okay.

4208
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:45,710
What's this?

4209
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:47,150
Oh, I guess I can look at him again.

4210
02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:49,190
Alright.

4211
02:42:50,170 --> 02:42:50,610
Wait.

4212
02:42:51,310 --> 02:42:52,370
Did I grab all these?

4213
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:53,270
I did, right?

4214
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:53,970
Oh yeah, I did.

4215
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:54,330
Okay.

4216
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:55,430
I'm gonna go up then.

4217
02:42:56,170 --> 02:42:56,610
Alright.

4218
02:42:57,210 --> 02:42:58,730
Oh, I don't have Ashley.

4219
02:42:58,910 --> 02:42:59,630
Okay, never mind.

4220
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:00,370
That doesn't matter.

4221
02:43:00,630 --> 02:43:01,010
Okay.

4222
02:43:02,330 --> 02:43:04,510
Okay, apparently I can't jump.

4223
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:05,550
Leon?

4224
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:11,230
Apparently, you can't fucking jump and grab onto this ladder.

4225
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:12,830
But that's okay.

4226
02:43:16,530 --> 02:43:17,430
That's okay.

4227
02:43:17,550 --> 02:43:20,050
I don't care that much, I guess.

4228
02:43:21,690 --> 02:43:22,790
I'm scared now.

4229
02:43:23,230 --> 02:43:24,710
I feel like I'm just gonna meet someone.

4230
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:26,110
Leon can't jump.

4231
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:30,110
At the end of chapter four?

4232
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:33,710
When did Ashley take this long to get?

4233
02:43:34,370 --> 02:43:35,510
I swear.

4234
02:43:35,610 --> 02:43:38,130
I'm pretty sure that they made this game longer.

4235
02:43:39,410 --> 02:43:42,190
They definitely made this game longer.

4236
02:43:42,330 --> 02:43:45,770
I wanted to see my fucking Hot Topic Ashley.

4237
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:54,410
Okay.

4238
02:43:58,200 --> 02:43:58,860
Hello?

4239
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:01,460
Hello?

4240
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:03,340
Hello?

4241
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:03,520
Hello?

4242
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:05,800
I don't know.

4243
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:06,460
I don't trust this.

4244
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:08,700
I don't trust this!

4245
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:12,640
Hello?

4246
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:14,820
Oh my god.

4247
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:15,900
I don't trust this at all.

4248
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:17,560
I hear a dog.

4249
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:19,200
Dog?

4250
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:22,180
No, dog!

4251
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:24,600
Don't worry, dog!

4252
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:25,780
I help you!

4253
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:30,720
Don't worry!

4254
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:35,040
It's okay.

4255
02:44:35,140 --> 02:44:35,840
I'll spray it.

4256
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:38,700
Wait!

4257
02:44:40,180 --> 02:44:41,620
You're supposed to give me XP!

4258
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:42,840
Or gold!

4259
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:45,640
Alright.

4260
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:46,980
Well, goodbye, dog.

4261
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:51,700
Okay, Insignia is like behind me.

4262
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:52,580
Alright.

4263
02:44:53,180 --> 02:44:55,020
The fuck was my gold?

4264
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:56,700
The crows gave me gold.

4265
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:01,500
Alright, here I go.

4266
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:03,400
Use.

4267
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:05,920
We saved dad.

4268
02:45:07,140 --> 02:45:07,660
Alright.

4269
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:08,680
Where's my bro?

4270
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,500
I take my bro or Ashley.

4271
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:14,260
Oh, I don't like this.

4272
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:14,600
Ooh.

4273
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:16,080
Turn on your flashlight.

4274
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:20,020
I don't like how he doesn't turn on his flashlight instantly when it's dark.

4275
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:21,620
I don't like that.

4276
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:24,120
It's dark!

4277
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:28,320
Okay, is this safe?

4278
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:28,960
No?

4279
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:31,000
Just a random shed here?

4280
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:31,680
Oh.

4281
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:34,800
What did I do with this random shed?

4282
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:37,700
Alright.

4283
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:40,160
Too dark.

4284
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:41,240
Too dark.

4285
02:45:42,140 --> 02:45:43,320
I don't like this.

4286
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:46,200
This is way too dark.

4287
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:48,980
Turn on your flashlight.

4288
02:45:49,060 --> 02:45:49,720
Leon, please!

4289
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:52,960
Leon!

4290
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:56,300
I'm gonna fucking turn... fucking bring out my shotgun at this rate.

4291
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:00,520
Like...

4292
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:00,680
Like...

4293
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:01,660
Like...

4294
02:46:01,660 --> 02:46:03,140
I don't like this.

4295
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:03,340
Oh.

4296
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:03,920
Wait.

4297
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:04,840
There he is.

4298
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,020
Wait, there's a villager.

4299
02:46:09,460 --> 02:46:10,100
Hello?

4300
02:46:11,020 --> 02:46:11,660
Hello?

4301
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:14,300
Oh, that's another village.

4302
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:16,600
This is another village I'm gonna slaughter?

4303
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:20,420
Because I don't know what stealth is?

4304
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:22,840
I guess it is.

4305
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:24,860
Hello, villagers!

4306
02:46:25,660 --> 02:46:28,060
I come here to kill all of you!

4307
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:30,000
I come here to kill all of you!

4308
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,100
I come here to kill all of you!

4309
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:33,880
What kind of stealth?

4310
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:40,940
Hello?

4311
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:42,840
Where are the villagers?

4312
02:46:48,490 --> 02:46:49,290
Another village.

4313
02:46:49,990 --> 02:46:50,950
Another slaughter.

4314
02:46:53,290 --> 02:46:53,690
Hello?

4315
02:46:54,090 --> 02:46:55,370
Oh wait, this is the first village.

4316
02:46:58,620 --> 02:46:59,740
Oh wait, I've been here.

4317
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:01,020
This is the first village.

4318
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:03,160
Alright.

4319
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:05,040
Let's see... I should be able to get this drawer now.

4320
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:05,380
Yeah.

4321
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:09,440
And there's a treasure here too.

4322
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:12,360
Wait, I can't be able to... where's the objectives?

4323
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:15,160
How the fuck do I get over here?

4324
02:47:16,420 --> 02:47:16,900
What?

4325
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,740
How the fuck do I... Jesus Christ, what is this map?

4326
02:47:22,480 --> 02:47:24,620
Alright, let's grab... I don't like this.

4327
02:47:27,100 --> 02:47:27,580
Hello?

4328
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:31,820
Hello guys?

4329
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:37,240
Alright, let's open this door for... aww, come on.

4330
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:39,760
Who set this trap back?

4331
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:40,380
Huh?

4332
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:43,540
Hello?

4333
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:46,900
I don't like this.

4334
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:49,440
I don't like this at all.

4335
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:51,880
I'm so nervous.

4336
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:57,160
Yeah, why is this village so fucking quiet?

4337
02:47:58,860 --> 02:47:59,480
Mmm.

4338
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:01,320
Mmmmm.

4339
02:48:05,190 --> 02:48:05,870
Hello?

4340
02:48:08,050 --> 02:48:10,870
Quiet village doesn't make me happy.

4341
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:13,050
Where do I go?

4342
02:48:13,770 --> 02:48:15,850
Do I go all the way back?

4343
02:48:20,790 --> 02:48:22,870
Because they're playing bingo.

4344
02:48:23,070 --> 02:48:25,390
True, they're still playing bingo right now.

4345
02:48:28,030 --> 02:48:28,710
AHHHHH!

4346
02:48:30,730 --> 02:48:31,710
What's going on?

4347
02:48:31,810 --> 02:48:32,650
What's going on?

4348
02:48:33,490 --> 02:48:35,190
What the fuck?

4349
02:48:35,350 --> 02:48:36,530
There's bad wolves!

4350
02:48:37,730 --> 02:48:38,390
There's bad...

4351
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:39,690
There's bad wolves!

4352
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:40,690
There's bad wolves!

4353
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:41,850
There's bad wolves!

4354
02:48:44,210 --> 02:48:44,830
There's bad wolves!

4355
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:45,050
Nooooo!

4356
02:48:51,240 --> 02:48:52,840
Oh god, oh god.

4357
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:54,040
There's bad wolves!

4358
02:48:54,360 --> 02:48:55,700
There's bad wolves!

4359
02:49:01,350 --> 02:49:02,230
That's fucking right.

4360
02:49:02,690 --> 02:49:03,910
Nooo, shit!

4361
02:49:06,150 --> 02:49:07,630
Shit, shit, okay, okay.

4362
02:49:07,710 --> 02:49:08,230
I'm gonna heal.

4363
02:49:11,350 --> 02:49:12,230
Please reload.

4364
02:49:12,730 --> 02:49:13,290
Please!

4365
02:49:14,330 --> 02:49:14,890
Okay.

4366
02:49:14,890 --> 02:49:15,130
Oh god.

4367
02:49:15,290 --> 02:49:16,370
Oh god.

4368
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:27,010
Oh my god, my fucking shotgun.

4369
02:49:28,460 --> 02:49:29,590
Holy shit.

4370
02:49:29,810 --> 02:49:32,310
I can't believe there were bad wolves.

4371
02:49:33,400 --> 02:49:36,370
If evil, why bad of a wolf?

4372
02:49:36,370 --> 02:49:39,070
What happened to the karma system?

4373
02:49:39,370 --> 02:49:40,990
I save wolf!

4374
02:49:41,450 --> 02:49:43,250
I get reward!

4375
02:49:46,690 --> 02:49:49,150
The karma system was a lie.

4376
02:49:49,290 --> 02:49:50,870
This is why you never do good things.

4377
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:54,690
Wait, what?

4378
02:49:54,970 --> 02:49:56,270
Is that more wolves?

4379
02:49:57,110 --> 02:50:01,070
This is exactly why you don't do any good thing ever again.

4380
02:50:05,050 --> 02:50:07,190
It was never worth it.

4381
02:50:08,770 --> 02:50:12,890
Why save wolves when wolves still evil?

4382
02:50:13,250 --> 02:50:16,010
How the fuck do I use this map?

4383
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:18,590
Guys, I'm fucking stupid.

4384
02:50:19,330 --> 02:50:20,670
I guess the ladder?

4385
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:23,590
Ah, fucking hell!

4386
02:50:25,690 --> 02:50:26,390
Alright.

4387
02:50:31,830 --> 02:50:34,610
Oh hey, I should take this herb though.

4388
02:50:35,410 --> 02:50:36,590
Might as well.

4389
02:50:37,930 --> 02:50:39,030
I guess ladder?

4390
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:42,210
Where is this?

4391
02:50:44,010 --> 02:50:44,530
Oh!

4392
02:50:46,850 --> 02:50:48,270
Oh, I don't like this.

4393
02:50:49,630 --> 02:50:52,110
Oh, I don't like this at all.

4394
02:50:56,360 --> 02:50:56,880
Hello?

4395
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:00,500
Hello?

4396
02:51:04,290 --> 02:51:05,410
I'm just gonna...

4397
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:07,410
shoot some boxes.

4398
02:51:08,690 --> 02:51:09,210
Hello?

4399
02:51:09,950 --> 02:51:10,950
Hello, is that rat?

4400
02:51:12,610 --> 02:51:13,330
That's a rat.

4401
02:51:13,450 --> 02:51:13,670
Okay.

4402
02:51:14,470 --> 02:51:15,670
Okay, that was just a rat.

4403
02:51:15,810 --> 02:51:15,950
Okay.

4404
02:51:16,350 --> 02:51:17,450
I'm just gonna...

4405
02:51:17,450 --> 02:51:18,090
I'm gonna...

4406
02:51:18,670 --> 02:51:19,730
Just gonna...

4407
02:51:19,730 --> 02:51:21,630
fucking destroy your barrels.

4408
02:51:22,170 --> 02:51:24,570
Alright, nothing to be scared of.

4409
02:51:25,730 --> 02:51:27,430
Oh, what is this?

4410
02:51:27,430 --> 02:51:28,590
What is this?

4411
02:51:29,530 --> 02:51:30,090
Oh...

4412
02:51:30,810 --> 02:51:31,130
Oh!

4413
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:33,710
Oh!

4414
02:51:36,050 --> 02:51:38,190
Honestly, I thought they would just come out of the trash.

4415
02:51:39,610 --> 02:51:40,970
Lowkey thought they were gonna...

4416
02:51:40,970 --> 02:51:41,390
Oh, hey there.

4417
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:44,370
Oh, fuck.

4418
02:51:45,130 --> 02:51:45,570
Thighs!

4419
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:47,430
Save me now!

4420
02:51:47,890 --> 02:51:48,030
Oh!

4421
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:50,730
There you go!

4422
02:51:51,790 --> 02:51:52,450
Sick thighs!

4423
02:51:52,950 --> 02:51:53,410
Let's go.

4424
02:51:53,490 --> 02:51:54,670
Wait, wait, is that a chainsaw?

4425
02:51:55,090 --> 02:51:56,250
No, that was not a chainsaw.

4426
02:51:56,370 --> 02:51:56,650
Okay.

4427
02:52:00,050 --> 02:52:01,670
I'm happy for my thighs.

4428
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:04,470
Nice.

4429
02:52:05,850 --> 02:52:06,910
Hey, we're good.

4430
02:52:07,570 --> 02:52:08,510
Oh, we're good.

4431
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:08,970
We're okay.

4432
02:52:10,510 --> 02:52:11,710
Thighs saves lives.

4433
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:12,750
Yeah, that's right.

4434
02:52:12,810 --> 02:52:13,810
This life, too.

4435
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:13,890
Two.

4436
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:19,410
I'm gonna make sure... did I get everything here?

4437
02:52:21,030 --> 02:52:22,030
Let's see...

4438
02:52:22,580 --> 02:52:25,050
How to go to the door with the insignia...

4439
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:26,630
Yeah, there's nothing here.

4440
02:52:27,570 --> 02:52:29,770
I think there's nothing here for me to loot.

4441
02:52:29,830 --> 02:52:32,090
So I can go to the church now.

4442
02:52:34,010 --> 02:52:34,510
Boop!

4443
02:52:37,970 --> 02:52:38,470
Hello!

4444
02:52:41,650 --> 02:52:42,150
Hello?

4445
02:52:44,330 --> 02:52:45,030
What's that?

4446
02:52:45,310 --> 02:52:45,710
AHH!

4447
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:48,590
What the fuck was that?!

4448
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:50,870
Bad snake!

4449
02:52:53,150 --> 02:52:54,250
Oh, I got a snake.

4450
02:52:54,530 --> 02:52:54,810
Nice.

4451
02:52:55,130 --> 02:52:56,230
Can I sell this?

4452
02:52:59,510 --> 02:53:00,090
Nice.

4453
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:02,850
Oh my god, my favorite fucking kitchen knife.

4454
02:53:05,790 --> 02:53:07,430
That's definitely what I need.

4455
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:13,620
Ooh...

4456
02:53:14,130 --> 02:53:15,280
Is this their church?

4457
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:17,180
Where the fuck...

4458
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:18,440
What kind of church is this?

4459
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:23,280
Okay, I don't need to look at this man's face for the fifth time.

4460
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:27,760
What kind of church is this?

4461
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:29,640
That's a giant skull!

4462
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:32,980
That's...

4463
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:34,540
Yeah, where the...

4464
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:35,820
What the fuck?

4465
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:38,160
How did they get that?

4466
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:41,360
Sleep well and flourish, dear child.

4467
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:46,280
As your body grows, your mother shall sew new small clothes.

4468
02:53:46,280 --> 02:53:51,740
As seven quintal of wheat and half a bowl a day, you have outgrown your pen.

4469
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:58,020
Flourish, dear child, for the sake of your brothers and sister who cannot...

4470
02:53:58,740 --> 02:54:00,740
That's a John-ass fucking skull.

4471
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:03,980
Whose head is that?

4472
02:54:07,610 --> 02:54:09,370
Whose fucking head is that?

4473
02:54:11,610 --> 02:54:13,370
Oh my god, that boy grew!

4474
02:54:15,010 --> 02:54:16,130
That's a big boy.

4475
02:54:17,410 --> 02:54:19,450
I think I'm running out of inventory space.

4476
02:54:22,270 --> 02:54:23,550
That is a lot of heads.

4477
02:54:24,390 --> 02:54:26,670
Okay, the smell in this place must not be great.

4478
02:54:26,830 --> 02:54:27,990
Not gonna lie.

4479
02:54:28,690 --> 02:54:31,050
This is not the best smelling place.

4480
02:54:34,810 --> 02:54:35,290
Merchant?!

4481
02:54:37,510 --> 02:54:37,990
Nice.

4482
02:54:39,130 --> 02:54:39,810
That's good.

4483
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:41,110
That means I'm safe.

4484
02:54:41,330 --> 02:54:41,390
That means I'm safe.

4485
02:54:43,570 --> 02:54:44,250
What's this?

4486
02:54:44,470 --> 02:54:44,930
What's this?

4487
02:54:44,930 --> 02:54:46,110
Sick of constantly running out of everything.

4488
02:54:46,130 --> 02:54:46,710
I'm gonna go buy some ammo.

4489
02:54:46,750 --> 02:54:48,130
Well, I got a treat for you.

4490
02:54:48,270 --> 02:54:50,370
The bolt through is something else, mate.

4491
02:54:50,510 --> 02:54:52,390
It's a bolt that can be retrieved and reused.

4492
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:54,270
So you can keep shooting forever.

4493
02:54:54,750 --> 02:54:59,750
Also, don't forget to buy the bolt recipe to turn your extra knives into, well, bolts.

4494
02:55:00,150 --> 02:55:02,090
Nothing to worry about ammo again.

4495
02:55:02,310 --> 02:55:03,490
And that's not all.

4496
02:55:03,670 --> 02:55:06,230
You can fix the bolts with attachable mines.

4497
02:55:07,290 --> 02:55:08,230
Skip ad.

4498
02:55:12,030 --> 02:55:15,670
Merchant, if you are telling me to buy your bolts...

4499
02:55:16,130 --> 02:55:17,010
That means...

4500
02:55:17,010 --> 02:55:18,310
That means it's a scam.

4501
02:55:18,510 --> 02:55:20,030
You have too much in stock.

4502
02:55:20,130 --> 02:55:21,150
You can't fool me.

4503
02:55:21,510 --> 02:55:22,850
I used to...

4504
02:55:23,490 --> 02:55:25,190
I've told this story before.

4505
02:55:25,450 --> 02:55:27,230
But for those who are new here...

4506
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:30,270
Back when I was in, like, middle school...

4507
02:55:30,270 --> 02:55:31,930
And I used to live in Asia...

4508
02:55:31,930 --> 02:55:38,950
I used to sell, like, overpriced, like, anime shit to, like, people in America on eBay.

4509
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:47,560
I used to run an eBay store.

4510
02:55:48,260 --> 02:55:49,800
You can't fool me, merchant.

4511
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:51,520
You can't...

4512
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:54,420
I was a fast lay.

4513
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:58,760
So in middle school, I opened up an eBay.

4514
02:55:59,020 --> 02:56:00,680
And I just sold, like...

4515
02:56:01,460 --> 02:56:02,300
Oh my god.

4516
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:05,600
One of them was, like, Italia trading cards.

4517
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:06,720
And, like...

4518
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:11,720
Because, like, when I bought the trading cards, like, they were, like, you know, they were, like, super cheap when I was in Asia.

4519
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:16,080
But then, like, people in America, they were trying to get, like, collectible cards from Italia.

4520
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:17,440
Like, the most...

4521
02:56:17,440 --> 02:56:18,740
The collectible ones.

4522
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:21,660
So then I sold individual cards on eBay.

4523
02:56:22,980 --> 02:56:25,180
The rare cards I had.

4524
02:56:26,380 --> 02:56:27,780
So it was you!

4525
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:28,680
I...

4526
02:56:29,350 --> 02:56:29,620
I...

4527
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:30,820
I did that.

4528
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:34,820
And I also sold, like, anime posters from, like, magazines.

4529
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:36,580
Because, like, you can get, like, the...

4530
02:56:36,580 --> 02:56:40,320
You know, like, those anime magazines where you can get, like, posters and stuff?

4531
02:56:41,140 --> 02:56:41,680
It's...

4532
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:42,180
It's...

4533
02:56:42,180 --> 02:56:42,300
Okay.

4534
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:43,020
Okay.

4535
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:45,360
It wasn't a scam when people...

4536
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:47,420
People back then could not do it.

4537
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:47,740
They couldn't get it.

4538
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:48,660
Like...

4539
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:52,840
It's not a scam!

4540
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:55,900
I was your only way to get these items!

4541
02:56:58,020 --> 02:56:58,760
And then...

4542
02:56:58,760 --> 02:57:06,680
So, like, you know, in, like, magazines, those anime magazines that has, like, posters of, like, anime characters and it's, like, exclusively only in these magazines?

4543
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:12,320
So I bought those magazines and then I would sell the posters within the magazines.

4544
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:15,120
Because, like, people really wanted them.

4545
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:20,380
So you can't fool me, merchant!

4546
02:57:20,900 --> 02:57:22,160
You can't fool me!

4547
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:24,320
That's something I would do.

4548
02:57:24,460 --> 02:57:25,240
I'd be like, hey guys.

4549
02:57:25,420 --> 02:57:26,640
You should buy this.

4550
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:27,320
The world!

4551
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:28,660
Very exclusive!

4552
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:31,920
You can't fool me!

4553
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:33,160
Look, I was in middle school.

4554
02:57:33,580 --> 02:57:34,140
Okay.

4555
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:35,100
I gotta hustle.

4556
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:36,160
Okay.

4557
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:43,920
Look, it was...

4558
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:45,620
It was tough, guys.

4559
02:57:45,700 --> 02:57:46,920
Being in middle school.

4560
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:48,200
We're trying to make money.

4561
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:49,100
Yay!

4562
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:52,640
It's supply and demand, bro!

4563
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:53,320
Exactly!

4564
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:55,080
Supply and demand!

4565
02:57:55,940 --> 02:57:57,220
Is there anything I can sell?

4566
02:57:59,060 --> 02:58:00,380
For sell... oh wait.

4567
02:58:00,460 --> 02:58:02,620
Is there any of them that are like...

4568
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:04,340
that need gems?

4569
02:58:04,580 --> 02:58:05,140
No, okay.

4570
02:58:05,380 --> 02:58:06,260
We're gonna sell.

4571
02:58:07,020 --> 02:58:07,580
Sell...

4572
02:58:08,320 --> 02:58:10,620
We need to sell the...

4573
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:14,320
Velvet blue, the vintage, the pearl.

4574
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:17,460
Uh...

4575
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:19,340

4576
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:21,700

4577
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:21,940
Oh!

4578
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:23,960
Do I sell this now or later?

4579
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:26,240
Do I sell this now or later?

4580
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:29,020
Yeah, but if I find a yellow sap...

4581
02:58:29,020 --> 02:58:30,560
If I find a yellow one...

4582
02:58:31,060 --> 02:58:32,300

4583
02:58:32,620 --> 02:58:35,720
But wouldn't... wait, actually, I'm gonna sell these three first.

4584
02:58:36,080 --> 02:58:37,380
Do I sell the Viper now?

4585
02:58:37,580 --> 02:58:38,060

4586
02:58:39,380 --> 02:58:40,760
Or when I find...

4587
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:43,220

4588
02:58:43,220 --> 02:58:44,100

Okay.

02:58:48,140 --> 02:58:49,100
Alright, I'll sell now.

4592
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:52,120
Okay.

4593
02:58:52,220 --> 02:58:52,540
Alright.

4594
02:58:52,660 --> 02:58:53,380
I'll sell it now.

4595
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:54,340
I'll just sell these for now.

4596
02:58:54,480 --> 02:58:55,640
And then I'll do the others.

02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:14,820
Uh, so...

4608
02:59:14,820 --> 02:59:16,060
Buy my fucking mask.

Nice.

4610
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:19,400
Nice.

4611
02:59:19,580 --> 02:59:20,760
Ooh, that is a lot.

4612
02:59:20,880 --> 02:59:21,300
Alright, guys.

4613
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:24,500
Should I buy anything or should I...

4614
02:59:24,500 --> 02:59:25,980
Guys, should I buy anything?

4615
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:28,440
Or... uh...

4616
02:59:28,440 --> 02:59:30,240
Or do I upgrade?

4617
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:31,980
Guys, what do I do?

4618
02:59:33,140 --> 02:59:35,560
Stop chat telling me wrong things!

4619
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:39,640
Upgrade?

4620
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:40,400
Okay, I'll upgrade.

4621
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:40,920
What do I upgrade?

4622
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:44,300
Uh, what should I upgrade?

4623
02:59:45,720 --> 02:59:46,160
Uh...

4624
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:48,860
Tune up the knife?

4625
02:59:49,100 --> 02:59:51,380
Guys, I'm mostly using my kitchen knife though.

4626
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:54,440
The nitro ability, sis?

4627
02:59:56,240 --> 02:59:57,180
Go get the...

4628
02:59:57,180 --> 02:59:59,040
Why would I need the TMP?

4629
02:59:59,800 --> 03:00:01,740
I don't think I need the TMP.

4630
03:00:02,980 --> 03:00:03,460
Guys...

4631
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:05,300
I don't need it!

4632
03:00:05,300 --> 03:00:06,320
I have the pistol!

4633
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:11,720
Guys, I don't need it.

4634
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:12,800
I have the pistol.

4635
03:00:15,260 --> 03:00:16,900
Okay, I'll do the two.

4636
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:18,060
I'll do the durability of my knife.

4637
03:00:18,280 --> 03:00:18,780
I'll do that.

4638
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:20,680
And then...

4639
03:00:22,780 --> 03:00:23,480
Rifle upgrade?

4640
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:24,560
Should I upgrade my rifle?

4641
03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:26,360
I can!

4642
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:27,460
What do I upgrade?

4643
03:00:31,360 --> 03:00:31,800
Um...

4644
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:33,340
Do I get power?

4645
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:35,480
Or...

4646
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:37,260
Do I get power?

4647
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:38,520
Power?

4648
03:00:38,600 --> 03:00:39,320
Okay, I'll do power.

4649
03:00:40,060 --> 03:00:41,820
Okay, I have enough money.

4650
03:00:42,220 --> 03:00:43,980
I can also power...

4651
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:46,260
No, actually, I can... what do I do?

4652
03:00:46,900 --> 03:00:47,740
I have 20k.

4653
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:49,880
Do I put all in on power?

4654
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:52,180
All in?

4655
03:00:52,940 --> 03:00:54,240
Better snipers ahead?

4656
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:54,880
Okay.

4657
03:00:54,920 --> 03:00:58,680
Power and reload speed.

4658
03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:01,140
Power and...

4659
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:02,540
Capacity.

4660
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:04,540
Okay, capacity or reload speed?

4661
03:01:04,880 --> 03:01:05,340
Reload?

4662
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:07,280
Okay, I don't know, guys.

4663
03:01:07,460 --> 03:01:09,000
I have enough for either...

4664
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:09,680
All in.

4665
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:13,640
Oh, better sniper in...

4666
03:01:13,640 --> 03:01:14,100
Castle.

4667
03:01:14,180 --> 03:01:14,820
That's a long way.

4668
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:15,080
Okay.

4669
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:16,260
Absolutely.

4670
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:18,020
I'll max power this then.

4671
03:01:19,460 --> 03:01:19,980
Alright.

4672
03:01:19,980 --> 03:01:21,160
I'll max power this.

4673
03:01:22,420 --> 03:01:23,420
Just for bosses.

4674
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:24,700
Just for bosses.

4675
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:26,880
Ultimate power.

4676
03:01:27,960 --> 03:01:28,560
Oh, wait.

4677
03:01:28,580 --> 03:01:28,880
What's this?

4678
03:01:29,240 --> 03:01:29,840
A girlfriend?

4679
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:31,220
Oh, this is the snakes!

4680
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,040
Delicious vipers.

4681
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:35,600
Is there a snake charmer willing to...

4682
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:36,720
Okay, this is the snake thing.

4683
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:38,160
Alright.

4684
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:39,320
Let's go.

4685
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:43,820
Yeah, they 100% made this fucking long.

4686
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:46,760
Yeah, they 100% made this fucking long.

4687
03:01:46,760 --> 03:01:48,480
I would have met my bro by now.

4688
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:53,120
I would have met my bro by now.

4689
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:53,840
I would have saw my bro!

4690
03:01:54,320 --> 03:01:55,000
I would have saw my bro!

4691
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:55,660
Oh, there he is.

4692
03:01:57,740 --> 03:01:58,220
Nice.

4693
03:01:58,300 --> 03:01:59,280
Oh, I can sell this again.

4694
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:02,180
Hello, stranger.

4695
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:02,700
Hello.

4696
03:02:03,340 --> 03:02:04,920
I need you to buy my...

4697
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:06,000
Hello, stranger.

4698
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Hello.

4699
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:06,080
I need you to buy my...

4700
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:06,420
Nice.

4701
03:02:09,080 --> 03:02:10,040
I'm gonna...

4702
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:12,440
save again just so... just in case.

4703
03:02:14,660 --> 03:02:16,160
I had to get the treasure!

4704
03:02:16,460 --> 03:02:17,680
What do you mean wrong way?

4705
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:19,360
There was treasure over there.

4706
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,700
There was treasure over there.

4707
03:02:20,700 --> 03:02:22,140
The lighting is so weird sometimes.

4708
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:27,840
I'm learning.

4709
03:02:28,020 --> 03:02:29,780
This game is teaching me to look up.

4710
03:02:30,540 --> 03:02:30,860
I'm learning.

4711
03:02:30,860 --> 03:02:30,860
This game is teaching me to look up.

4712
03:02:31,340 --> 03:02:31,860
Hello?

4713
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:33,880
Hello?

4714
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:35,480
Hello?

4715
03:02:37,180 --> 03:02:38,000
Who's there?

4716
03:02:38,940 --> 03:02:39,460
Whoa.

4717
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:42,640
I made it!

4718
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:44,960
Bro, are you here?

4719
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:45,200
Bro?

4720
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:48,340
Bro?

4721
03:02:50,320 --> 03:02:50,720
Oh.

4722
03:02:51,940 --> 03:02:52,340
Hmm.

4723
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:54,440
Okay.

4724
03:02:55,120 --> 03:02:55,520
Wait.

4725
03:02:55,720 --> 03:02:56,880
I might be able to stealth this.

4726
03:02:57,500 --> 03:02:58,760
He won't turn around, right?

4727
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:01,380
Yeah?

4728
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:03,080
Yeah?

4729
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:03,880
Yeah.

4730
03:03:04,020 --> 03:03:04,660
There's you go.

4731
03:03:05,060 --> 03:03:05,460
Nice.

4732
03:03:07,100 --> 03:03:08,660
We let him dig his own grave.

4733
03:03:08,980 --> 03:03:09,260
Nice.

4734
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:10,140
Thank you for the money.

4735
03:03:10,580 --> 03:03:12,900
Honestly, I'm just killing them for the money at this point.

4736
03:03:12,980 --> 03:03:13,760
Like, that's more important.

4737
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:19,160
It's all about the money.

4738
03:03:20,540 --> 03:03:21,440
It's all about the money.

4739
03:03:21,460 --> 03:03:22,520
Oh shit!

4740
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:23,220
Whoa!

4741
03:03:23,720 --> 03:03:24,220
Bro!

4742
03:03:26,140 --> 03:03:26,640
Okay.

4743
03:03:26,780 --> 03:03:27,440
It dies.

4744
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:29,260
Nice.

4745
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:31,080
Wait, did I alert people?

4746
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:33,280
Hey guys, did you guys hear that?

4747
03:03:33,500 --> 03:03:34,100
No, right?

4748
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:35,600
Oh no.

4749
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:36,380
Okay, that's good.

4750
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:37,780
Nobody heard that.

4751
03:03:39,140 --> 03:03:39,900
Thank god.

4752
03:03:41,480 --> 03:03:42,440
What the fuck?

4753
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:43,940
That's a random coffin over there.

4754
03:03:44,060 --> 03:03:44,840
What the fuck?

4755
03:03:44,840 --> 03:03:44,840
That's a random coffin over there.

4756
03:03:44,840 --> 03:03:44,840
Resources.

4757
03:03:45,320 --> 03:03:45,600
Nice.

4758
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:47,520
That's okay.

4759
03:03:47,740 --> 03:03:48,980
His life didn't matter.

4760
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:50,280
Thank fucking god.

4761
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:54,020
It's alright.

4762
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:56,300
Nobody knew.

4763
03:03:57,280 --> 03:03:57,940
We're fine.

4764
03:03:59,820 --> 03:04:01,700
People didn't like this guy anyway.

4765
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:03,400
Nobody liked him!

4766
03:04:03,740 --> 03:04:04,840
Alright, will he have money?

4767
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:06,080
Let's find out.

4768
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:08,300
I knew it!

4769
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:11,720
I knew you were holding out on me, you crows!

4770
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:15,300
I knew you were holding out on me, you crows!

4771
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:17,480
I'm fucking out!

4772
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:19,360
I'm the loan shark.

4773
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,700
I'm here to collect my pay.

4774
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:22,940
I fucking knew those crows were holding out.

4775
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:24,240
I knew it!

4776
03:04:28,560 --> 03:04:30,700
They can't get away from me!

4777
03:04:33,140 --> 03:04:35,340
I knew they were holding out.

4778
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:41,120
My money!

4779
03:04:41,940 --> 03:04:43,640
It's our money now.

4780
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:47,900
It's our money now.

4781
03:04:47,900 --> 03:04:49,200
The church is sealed up.

4782
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:50,360
And baby eagle?

4783
03:04:51,100 --> 03:04:51,620
Negative.

4784
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:52,420
Nothing yet.

4785
03:04:52,920 --> 03:04:55,300
But they sure do have this place locked up tight.

4786
03:04:55,940 --> 03:04:56,720
I see.

4787
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:59,480
I can think of one reason they'd want to do so.

4788
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:00,700
Who would unlock it?

4789
03:05:01,300 --> 03:05:02,960
I'm perfectly safe!

4790
03:05:03,280 --> 03:05:03,740
I'll find a way in.

4791
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:06,300
I'm a police officer!

4792
03:05:07,620 --> 03:05:09,300
Okay, we need like an emblem.

4793
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:11,620
Climb over the...

4794
03:05:11,620 --> 03:05:13,720
I don't think we're climbing over anything on that.

4795
03:05:14,060 --> 03:05:17,060
I don't think so, guys.

4796
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:17,880
I don't think so, guys.

4797
03:05:17,900 --> 03:05:19,400
There's some treasures here.

4798
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:20,620
There's more treasures.

4799
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:22,220
Can I go through here?

4800
03:05:23,220 --> 03:05:24,320
No, it's locked.

4801
03:05:25,160 --> 03:05:26,920
Alright, we're gonna go through here.

4802
03:05:28,160 --> 03:05:28,820
Wham!

4803
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:30,340
Okay.

4804
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:31,440
Hello?

4805
03:05:35,140 --> 03:05:35,800
Hello?

4806
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:41,200
What's this?

4807
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:43,800
A pressed fro.

4808
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:45,580
He out-sit has come.

4809
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:46,580
What the fuck?

4810
03:05:47,900 --> 03:05:51,280
The key... I'll be held in the cave on the side.

4811
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:53,360
The monster will...

4812
03:05:53,360 --> 03:05:55,060
Okay, the key... okay, I...

4813
03:05:55,700 --> 03:05:56,680
Cross the lake.

4814
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:57,440
Okay, there we go.

4815
03:05:59,020 --> 03:06:01,120
That took me a while to comprehend.

4816
03:06:01,820 --> 03:06:02,940
Is this... is that Ashley?

4817
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:04,100
Ashley!

4818
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:05,620
What are you doing?

4819
03:06:06,140 --> 03:06:08,880
Keep her locked in the church until the appointed time.

4820
03:06:09,100 --> 03:06:11,080
This is not the outfit we picked for you!

4821
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:13,640
Oh, no, not this.

4822
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:14,440
Words.

4823
03:06:15,980 --> 03:06:17,880
That was a little difficult to understand.

4824
03:06:17,900 --> 03:06:18,300
I'm gonna read, okay?

4825
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:23,020
Can I open this?

4826
03:06:24,260 --> 03:06:25,040
Oh, I can!

4827
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:27,020
Okay, where do we go?

4828
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:30,720
I'm gonna go outside first?

4829
03:06:30,900 --> 03:06:32,220
Cause there's something over here.

4830
03:06:36,180 --> 03:06:37,680
Ooh, I like this.

4831
03:06:37,740 --> 03:06:38,200
This is spooky!

4832
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:45,220
I don't like that spooky scary it's giving me!

4833
03:06:48,360 --> 03:06:49,300
Okay, what's this?

4834
03:06:49,300 --> 03:06:54,640
The traitorous twins should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult.

4835
03:06:54,820 --> 03:06:59,440
Wait, someone destroyed the emblems engraved upon their tombstones.

4836
03:07:00,340 --> 03:07:01,220
Oh, okay.

4837
03:07:01,380 --> 03:07:04,000
I just need to, like, destroy their graves.

4838
03:07:04,460 --> 03:07:04,960
Yeah.

4839
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:06,260
That's something I can do.

4840
03:07:06,740 --> 03:07:07,860
Elegant headdress.

4841
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:08,900
The fuck is that?

4842
03:07:09,440 --> 03:07:10,980
Oh my god, there is no space.

4843
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:14,460
Oh, I need to craft, uh, shotgun shells.

4844
03:07:15,440 --> 03:07:16,820
Wait, is that small?

4845
03:07:17,060 --> 03:07:18,100
Okay, I can... yeah.

4846
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:19,280
Always make shotgun shells.

4847
03:07:20,680 --> 03:07:21,480
Uh...

4848
03:07:21,480 --> 03:07:22,500
Wait...

4849
03:07:23,080 --> 03:07:23,920
Craft... fuck!

4850
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:24,580
I should...

4851
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:27,660
I forgot I had these guys too.

4852
03:07:28,980 --> 03:07:30,560
Can I combine them?

4853
03:07:30,780 --> 03:07:32,380
I cannot... okay.

4854
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:35,220
Okay, this is...

4855
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:37,140
I have a lot of grenades.

4856
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:39,000
I have...

4857
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:39,660
Woo!

4858
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:41,420
Grave desecration!

4859
03:07:41,420 --> 03:07:42,120
Let's go!

4860
03:07:44,220 --> 03:07:45,840
Let's fucking go!

4861
03:07:47,060 --> 03:07:49,260
Let's hope there's nobody back there.

4862
03:07:49,280 --> 03:07:49,480
There!

4863
03:07:52,920 --> 03:07:53,420
Alright.

4864
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:54,040
Woo!

4865
03:07:56,360 --> 03:07:56,860
Alright.

4866
03:07:57,040 --> 03:07:57,840
Oh, I can stash?

4867
03:07:59,240 --> 03:08:00,240
Oh, nevermind.

4868
03:08:00,320 --> 03:08:01,700
I thought I can, like...

4869
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:03,280
Where are the twins?

4870
03:08:04,540 --> 03:08:05,680
What if I just...

4871
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:07,120
Destroy every grave?

4872
03:08:07,240 --> 03:08:07,700
Does it matter?

4873
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:10,000
It shouldn't matter.

4874
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:13,400
What the...

4875
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:15,080
It shouldn't...

4876
03:08:15,860 --> 03:08:17,600
It shouldn't matter, right?

4877
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:18,300
Yeah.

4878
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:23,700
Yeah, it doesn't matter if I just destroy everybody's graves.

4879
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:24,820
Yeah, it doesn't matter if I just destroy everybody's graves.

4880
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:26,300
Like, who cares?

4881
03:08:26,500 --> 03:08:26,620
Like, who cares?

4882
03:08:26,620 --> 03:08:27,400
They're dead already.

4883
03:08:28,660 --> 03:08:30,020
Go for it.

4884
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,140
Who's gonna fucking stop me?

4885
03:08:35,240 --> 03:08:35,920
Their parents?

4886
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:37,340
Who's already dead?

4887
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:41,060
Cause I'm pretty sure I've already killed everybody here.

4888
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:41,780
Cause I'm pretty sure I've already killed everybody here.

4889
03:08:41,780 --> 03:08:43,140
Or eventually will.

4890
03:08:43,400 --> 03:08:44,240
There we go, we got one.

4891
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:45,100
There we did it.

4892
03:08:45,820 --> 03:08:46,340
Yay.

4893
03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:47,800
You know what?

4894
03:08:47,900 --> 03:08:48,900
Just for good luck.

4895
03:08:49,080 --> 03:08:49,480
Boom.

4896
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:54,940
Just for good luck.

4897
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:55,780
There we go, we did it.

4898
03:08:56,940 --> 03:08:57,460
Yay!

4899
03:08:58,200 --> 03:08:59,480
Thank you for the super chat.

4900
03:08:59,560 --> 03:09:00,440
Thank you, thank you.

4901
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:02,440
Grave robber Doki.

4902
03:09:04,140 --> 03:09:05,340
We did it.

4903
03:09:07,940 --> 03:09:09,500
Yeah, who's gonna stop me?

4904
03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:10,020
Nobody!

4905
03:09:10,460 --> 03:09:12,080
I already killed everybody in this village.

4906
03:09:14,100 --> 03:09:15,100
I'm too powerful.

4907
03:09:16,380 --> 03:09:18,540
I don't know if I should be going up or down.

4908
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:20,860
Oh, up for sure for the extra loot, I guess.

4909
03:09:22,420 --> 03:09:23,180
Flash grenades.

4910
03:09:23,800 --> 03:09:26,000
Do I have space still?

4911
03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:27,000
I do.

4912
03:09:28,460 --> 03:09:29,540
This is like...

4913
03:09:29,540 --> 03:09:31,220
This is gonna be an issue.

4914
03:09:31,720 --> 03:09:32,580
For sure.

4915
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:38,500
This is definitely gonna be an issue later on down the line.

4916
03:09:39,740 --> 03:09:40,260
Hey, I'm gonna get you.

4917
03:09:41,060 --> 03:09:41,580
I'm gonna get you.

4918
03:09:41,580 --> 03:09:41,620
I'm gonna get you.

4919
03:09:41,620 --> 03:09:41,660
I'm gonna get you.

4920
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:43,840
Hey guys, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

4921
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:44,800
Thank you, thank you.

4922
03:09:46,260 --> 03:09:46,680
No!

4923
03:09:47,800 --> 03:09:49,560
I don't need an auto-sort.

4924
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,240
That's for pussies.

4925
03:09:52,020 --> 03:09:52,880
I'm a gamer.

4926
03:09:53,720 --> 03:09:54,240
Oh, hey.

4927
03:09:54,380 --> 03:09:55,720
Wait, no, I don't have the key for that.

4928
03:09:56,540 --> 03:09:58,340
Now I can go downstairs.

4929
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:02,520
How do I put this in my storage?

4930
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:04,560
Or is that...

4931
03:10:05,140 --> 03:10:07,660
How do I move this to my storage?

4932
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:09,040
This is like...

4933
03:10:09,700 --> 03:10:10,800
Is this a storage?

4934
03:10:12,080 --> 03:10:12,780
Or like...

4935
03:10:14,480 --> 03:10:16,060
Can I put stuff in here?

4936
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:17,180
Or do I have to use it?

4937
03:10:19,900 --> 03:10:21,340
Oh, only weapons!

4938
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:22,500
Oh!

4939
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:25,620
Oh, oh wait.

4940
03:10:25,700 --> 03:10:26,940
I can put sprays, right?

4941
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:28,460
Can I put sprays?

4942
03:10:30,860 --> 03:10:31,380
Someone?

4943
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:33,880
Someone let me put my sprays.

4944
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:35,060
Where do I put that?

4945
03:10:36,520 --> 03:10:37,040
Shift.

4946
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:37,740
Go in.

4947
03:10:39,140 --> 03:10:40,580
Oh, certain items only?

4948
03:10:42,680 --> 03:10:43,680
Oh, click it.

4949
03:10:43,800 --> 03:10:44,820
Oh, okay.

4950
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:46,700
Yeah, I don't need my sprays.

4951
03:10:47,020 --> 03:10:48,040
Okay, that's good.

4952
03:10:48,180 --> 03:10:49,600
I have way too many.

4953
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:50,940
Thank you.

4954
03:10:50,980 --> 03:10:52,440
This is why I need back-seaters.

4955
03:10:52,780 --> 03:10:53,760
Okay, there you go.

4956
03:10:54,280 --> 03:10:57,040
I have way too fucking many sprays.

4957
03:10:58,780 --> 03:11:00,420
Thank you for the super chat.

4958
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:00,840
Thank you.

4959
03:11:02,620 --> 03:11:03,800
They're already dead!

4960
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:06,220
There's no brain going in there!

4961
03:11:06,700 --> 03:11:07,840
There's already brain dead!

4962
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:10,840
There!

4963
03:11:10,840 --> 03:11:12,180
And also, they're in graves now.

4964
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:20,200
They're either consumed by the parasite or they're in the graves.

4965
03:11:20,500 --> 03:11:21,660
So it doesn't matter.

4966
03:11:24,460 --> 03:11:26,220
Can I open this door side?

4967
03:11:29,100 --> 03:11:29,740
Whoo!

4968
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:33,120
Yeah, they're already dead or they're dead-dead.

4969
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:33,720
Exactly.

4970
03:11:34,940 --> 03:11:36,340
Wait, what?

4971
03:11:37,840 --> 03:11:38,720
I opened it that way, okay.

4972
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:43,060
Yeah, there's already fucking food for worms!

4973
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:46,560
There's like- oh, that's like the unlock.

4974
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:49,160
Oh my god, it's all the way there.

4975
03:11:49,280 --> 03:11:51,160
The church key is there?!

4976
03:11:51,880 --> 03:11:53,980
The sub of- what the fuck?

4977
03:11:55,080 --> 03:11:55,520
Okay.

4978
03:11:57,240 --> 03:11:57,680
Jesus.

4979
03:11:57,680 --> 03:11:58,760
Jesus Christ!

4980
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:01,460
Guys, okay, give me a sec.

4981
03:12:01,620 --> 03:12:04,180
How- I- I didn't look up how long this game is.

4982
03:12:04,180 --> 03:12:07,000
I'm actually curious.

4983
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:10,020
Okay.

4984
03:12:10,200 --> 03:12:15,500
How long is Resident Evil 4 Remake?

4985
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:19,240
Okay, 15- okay, original.

4986
03:12:19,700 --> 03:12:21,440
For original.

4987
03:12:21,480 --> 03:12:22,700
15 and a half.

4988
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:25,360
Wait, the original was longer?!

4989
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:27,800
Wait, really?!

4990
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:30,460
It says the original was longer!

4991
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:35,490
What?!

4992
03:12:36,950 --> 03:12:37,280
Bro!

4993
03:12:37,420 --> 03:12:39,260
I- they padded this chapter!

4994
03:12:44,980 --> 03:12:46,380
There's no way!

4995
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:47,100
Oh, hey.

4996
03:12:47,680 --> 03:12:49,240
Can you come downstairs?

4997
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:50,540
Come down.

4998
03:12:51,100 --> 03:12:52,280
Oh shit!

4999
03:12:53,020 --> 03:12:54,260
Oh shit!

5000
03:12:54,320 --> 03:12:54,560
Okay!

5001
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:57,180
I guess I'm fucking- won't be...

5002
03:12:57,180 --> 03:12:58,720
Did he come down yet?

5003
03:12:58,760 --> 03:12:59,460
I can't tell.

5004
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:03,320
There you go.

5005
03:13:05,340 --> 03:13:06,000
Alright, nice.

5006
03:13:07,580 --> 03:13:08,440
We did it!

5007
03:13:08,820 --> 03:13:09,260
Yay!

5008
03:13:09,960 --> 03:13:10,820
Oh shit!

5009
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:12,160
There was more.

5010
03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:15,800
Alright, it's fine.

5011
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:17,860
That's fine.

5012
03:13:18,040 --> 03:13:22,880
I- maybe I should not have waste- guys, maybe I should not have wasted the ammo- the barrel there.

5013
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:26,220
I didn't know there were like four more people coming in.

5014
03:13:29,460 --> 03:13:29,640
Oh!

5015
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:30,820
Oh!

5016
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:32,600
Okay.

5017
03:13:34,840 --> 03:13:35,780
Okay, it's fine.

5018
03:13:38,400 --> 03:13:39,000
That's fine.

5019
03:13:39,380 --> 03:13:39,820
Nice.

5020
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:44,400
Wait, there's more of you?!

5021
03:13:44,400 --> 03:13:45,060
Get over here.

5022
03:13:45,680 --> 03:13:48,060
It's okay, I have a lot of pistol bullets.

5023
03:13:49,980 --> 03:13:51,460
God, thank you for the super chat.

5024
03:13:51,560 --> 03:13:52,440
Thank you, thank you.

5025
03:13:53,160 --> 03:13:53,600
No!

5026
03:13:53,820 --> 03:13:54,480
My loot!

5027
03:14:00,520 --> 03:14:01,240
My- what?

5028
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:02,780
What did you say, Leo?

5029
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:05,860
What do you want- Alright.

5030
03:14:08,140 --> 03:14:08,160
Oh!

5031
03:14:10,100 --> 03:14:10,660
Nice.

5032
03:14:11,240 --> 03:14:12,100
Oh shit!

5033
03:14:12,300 --> 03:14:12,540
Ah!

5034
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:14,320
Shake!

5035
03:14:14,460 --> 03:14:14,840
Shake!

5036
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:15,340
Shake!

5037
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:15,900
Shake!

5038
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:16,300
Shake!

5039
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:20,320
Okay.

5040
03:14:20,320 --> 03:14:21,160
We're okay.

5041
03:14:21,400 --> 03:14:22,160
We're okay.

5042
03:14:22,460 --> 03:14:23,280
We're okay.

5043
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:23,860
We're okay.

5044
03:14:25,740 --> 03:14:26,800
Oh my god.

5045
03:14:26,940 --> 03:14:27,600
It's alright.

5046
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:28,960
I figured it out.

5047
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:31,700
I figured it out.

5048
03:14:32,780 --> 03:14:33,240
It's okay.

5049
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:38,020
You really earned that stabbing.

5050
03:14:39,860 --> 03:14:42,140
Wait, where the fuck was he throwing at?

5051
03:14:43,560 --> 03:14:44,920
Maybe I should've just started shanking.

5052
03:14:45,640 --> 03:14:47,500
Maybe I should've upgraded the power.

5053
03:14:47,680 --> 03:14:48,220
What the fuck?

5054
03:14:49,640 --> 03:14:52,680
I clearly- Wait, what the fuck?

5055
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:56,100
I clearly chose the wrong thing to upgrade.

5056
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:57,740
Do you want me to shank you?

5057
03:14:58,180 --> 03:15:00,180
Do I- wait, there's more of you?!

5058
03:15:00,980 --> 03:15:02,060
Okay, that's fine.

5059
03:15:03,420 --> 03:15:03,960
It's fine.

5060
03:15:04,020 --> 03:15:04,820
I can shank you later.

5061
03:15:05,280 --> 03:15:05,680
Alright.

5062
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:06,560
And she's burning.

5063
03:15:06,660 --> 03:15:07,040
That's good.

5064
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:07,820
More loot for me.

5065
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:09,860
That's good!

5066
03:15:10,900 --> 03:15:12,460
Doki the shanker.

5067
03:15:13,740 --> 03:15:15,440
This is what I've been waiting for.

5068
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:17,740
Finally a game for me!

5069
03:15:19,820 --> 03:15:20,220
Okay.

5070
03:15:20,360 --> 03:15:21,900
I got back all the ammo too.

5071
03:15:24,400 --> 03:15:25,260
That's good too.

5072
03:15:25,280 --> 03:15:26,320
I got all my ammo back.

5073
03:15:28,700 --> 03:15:29,520
And the money!

5074
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:33,520
Thank you for the super chat!

5075
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:34,460
Thank you, thank you!

5076
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:39,900
Actually, the original needed two GameCube CDs because it was so heavy to store in one CD.

5077
03:15:40,620 --> 03:15:42,640
The game is stored in the CDs.

5078
03:15:45,260 --> 03:15:46,240
Jesus Christ.

5079
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:53,840
No, I'm pretty sure- Like, I'm surprised that the original is longer than the remake.

5080
03:15:57,720 --> 03:15:59,100
I'm so surprised!

5081
03:15:59,460 --> 03:16:02,840
I felt like I like fucking got to Ashley already.

5082
03:16:03,620 --> 03:16:04,220
The original!

5083
03:16:05,640 --> 03:16:06,160
Wooo!

5084
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:06,680
Shit!

5085
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:08,120
This is worth it!

5086
03:16:10,640 --> 03:16:11,160
Alright.

5087
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:11,680
Nice.

5088
03:16:14,920 --> 03:16:15,440
Alright.

5089
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:15,760
Good.

5090
03:16:15,980 --> 03:16:16,700
Wait, that's it?

5091
03:16:16,980 --> 03:16:17,780
I killed two!

5092
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:18,500
Wooo!

5093
03:16:18,520 --> 03:16:18,980
Shit!

5094
03:16:21,360 --> 03:16:21,880
Shake!

5095
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:22,380
Shake!

5096
03:16:22,500 --> 03:16:22,800
Shake!

5097
03:16:24,200 --> 03:16:24,720
Okay.

5098
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:25,240
Nice.

5099
03:16:25,300 --> 03:16:25,640
We're good.

5100
03:16:26,120 --> 03:16:27,920
Holy shit, where are they coming from?

5101
03:16:29,100 --> 03:16:31,300
Where the fuck are these people coming from?

5102
03:16:31,880 --> 03:16:32,820
Did I get everything?

5103
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:33,600
No, there's nothing.

5104
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:34,800
There's a treasure somewhere.

5105
03:16:35,740 --> 03:16:37,080
Wait, I missed out on- Oh!

5106
03:16:37,100 --> 03:16:37,400
Oh!

5107
03:16:37,400 --> 03:16:37,780
Right here!

5108
03:16:37,880 --> 03:16:38,540
I see it.

5109
03:16:40,020 --> 03:16:41,120
How do I get it though?

5110
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:43,240
Where the fuck do I get downstairs?

5111
03:16:46,600 --> 03:16:47,040
Uhhh...

5112
03:16:47,960 --> 03:16:48,400
Alright.

5113
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:57,660
Where do I- Where the hell do I get downstairs?

5114
03:16:59,200 --> 03:16:59,640
Huh?

5115
03:17:00,620 --> 03:17:01,480
Oh, later!

5116
03:17:01,780 --> 03:17:02,040
Okay.

5117
03:17:02,360 --> 03:17:02,800
Later.

5118
03:17:04,320 --> 03:17:04,840
Alright.

5119
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:05,780
I might get there later.

5120
03:17:07,940 --> 03:17:09,460
I've been thinking for the super chat.

5121
03:17:09,540 --> 03:17:09,820
Thank you.

5122
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:10,380
Thank you.

5123
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:12,720
Why doesn't Leon call stars for help?

5124
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:13,720
Is he stupid?

5125
03:17:14,200 --> 03:17:16,880
Thank you for this- Look, this is his promotion, okay?

5126
03:17:17,240 --> 03:17:22,400
If he- If he can't protect the president's daughter, then what's the point?

5127
03:17:22,600 --> 03:17:24,920
He might as well fucking get fired.

5128
03:17:26,480 --> 03:17:29,460
He might as well go home, guys.

5129
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:35,400
This is like- This is like his like- Job to get promoted.

5130
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:37,320
Do you not want him to get promotion?

5131
03:17:38,020 --> 03:17:38,900
Where am I?

5132
03:17:40,240 --> 03:17:42,240
Like I'm just like, where am I all the time?

5133
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:44,680
It's about pride!

5134
03:17:45,060 --> 03:17:45,620
Exactly!

5135
03:17:47,940 --> 03:17:53,140
If he comes back without the president's daughter, they're just gonna laugh at him!

5136
03:17:56,360 --> 03:17:58,420
They're gonna make fun of him!

5137
03:18:03,710 --> 03:18:04,910
Okay, let's go up.

5138
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:14,680
He wants to show stars that he's not just a pretty boy!

5139
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:18,420
That he's more than just th- What is this?

5140
03:18:18,920 --> 03:18:20,540
Oh no, not this guy.

5141
03:18:20,760 --> 03:18:21,880
Oh my gosh, it's a giant.

5142
03:18:22,140 --> 03:18:23,380
It's a giant.

5143
03:18:23,980 --> 03:18:26,480
That he's more than just the thighs.

5144
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:29,600
Is there anyone who can destroy these blue medallions?

5145
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:32,600
The air is polluted by their presence and I can't bear it.

5146
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:34,940
Okay, query to the fish farm.

5147
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:36,280
Okay.

5148
03:18:36,740 --> 03:18:38,320
Where are all- Where is all of them?

5149
03:18:38,420 --> 03:18:39,220
One- Jesus!

5150
03:18:39,660 --> 03:18:43,240
What the f- Okay, there's like three here, one here.

5151
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:44,140
Alright.

5152
03:18:44,420 --> 03:18:45,600
Peta, thank you for the five!

5153
03:18:45,660 --> 03:18:46,180
Give the ships!

5154
03:18:46,280 --> 03:18:47,100
Thank you, thank you!

5155
03:18:48,040 --> 03:18:49,260
Thank you for the super chat!

5156
03:18:49,320 --> 03:18:50,040
Thank you, thank you!

5157
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:52,300
Is this what it takes to be promoted?

5158
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:53,960
I'd rather be homeless.

5159
03:18:55,060 --> 03:18:56,720
Okay, look, they don't really have a lot.

5160
03:18:57,280 --> 03:18:57,680
That's right.

5161
03:18:59,200 --> 03:18:59,840
That's right.

5162
03:19:00,280 --> 03:19:02,540
You ain't fucking- Oh shit, not the wolves!

5163
03:19:07,890 --> 03:19:09,610
There are more than just them?

5164
03:19:10,210 --> 03:19:11,110
Where are the other wolves?

5165
03:19:14,270 --> 03:19:14,950
It's okay.

5166
03:19:15,710 --> 03:19:17,110
Where is the good wolf!

5167
03:19:17,850 --> 03:19:19,770
Oh my god, this wolf is so fast!

5168
03:19:19,970 --> 03:19:21,950
I'd swear to god, okay.

5169
03:19:22,410 --> 03:19:23,750
Where's the good wolf!

5170
03:19:23,870 --> 03:19:25,450
I did my fucking good deed!

5171
03:19:27,830 --> 03:19:28,690
Nice money.

5172
03:19:34,050 --> 03:19:35,210
Can't believe it.

5173
03:19:35,870 --> 03:19:38,670
This game has taught me that good deeds mean nothing!

5174
03:19:41,830 --> 03:19:43,550
Means fucking nothing!

5175
03:19:43,650 --> 03:19:44,090
What are you saying?

5176
03:19:47,220 --> 03:19:48,380
Oh, that's true!

5177
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:51,000
Wait, actually Bacon, that is so fucking true.

5178
03:19:51,140 --> 03:19:51,720
Wait, you're right.

5179
03:19:52,400 --> 03:19:54,100
He doesn't love his daughter enough!

5180
03:19:55,160 --> 03:19:55,860
You're right!

5181
03:19:56,740 --> 03:20:01,420
Bacon, if the president really wanted his daughter back, I'm sure he would have sent that more than one guy.

5182
03:20:01,500 --> 03:20:03,400
Oh no, that's where the troll is.

5183
03:20:03,960 --> 03:20:04,860
Wait a minute.

5184
03:20:06,380 --> 03:20:08,600
Wait a minute, that's the troll man.

5185
03:20:09,600 --> 03:20:11,340
I don't wanna pay no toll.

5186
03:20:12,200 --> 03:20:13,240
Oh, get up there.

5187
03:20:15,560 --> 03:20:15,940
That's right.

5188
03:20:16,040 --> 03:20:18,740
He wanted his daughter to never come back.

5189
03:20:24,480 --> 03:20:25,920
Oh my god.

5190
03:20:26,460 --> 03:20:27,520
This man.

5191
03:20:27,740 --> 03:20:29,380
This man knows what's up.

5192
03:20:30,260 --> 03:20:32,960
You're right, he would have sent two guys.

5193
03:20:33,860 --> 03:20:38,040
It was just... he knew Leon didn't have it in him.

5194
03:20:38,380 --> 03:20:39,660
Where is this?

5195
03:20:40,080 --> 03:20:41,480
Do I have to look up again?

5196
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:43,200
Dude, I fucking knew it.

5197
03:20:45,560 --> 03:20:46,900
I always knew I had to look up.

5198
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:52,280
Okay, there's a medallion here somewhere.

5199
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:54,640
I'm looking.

5200
03:20:55,900 --> 03:20:56,660
I'm looking.

5201
03:20:57,580 --> 03:20:59,420
Where the fuck is this medallion?

5202
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:02,820
Wait, where is this medallion?

5203
03:21:03,320 --> 03:21:03,800
Wait!

5204
03:21:04,340 --> 03:21:05,160
It's up top?

5205
03:21:06,600 --> 03:21:07,680
Is it up there?

5206
03:21:12,490 --> 03:21:13,490
Always look up.

5207
03:21:13,530 --> 03:21:14,190
Is it up there?

5208
03:21:14,470 --> 03:21:15,630
Up all the way there?

5209
03:21:17,010 --> 03:21:17,990
It's very high?

5210
03:21:18,130 --> 03:21:18,870
Okay, I don't have to care.

5211
03:21:19,730 --> 03:21:20,390
Thank god.

5212
03:21:22,050 --> 03:21:23,410
Go back to the yard?

5213
03:21:23,670 --> 03:21:24,590
It's outside?

5214
03:21:27,590 --> 03:21:28,910
Where the fuck is it?

5215
03:21:28,970 --> 03:21:29,850
Oh, there it is!

5216
03:21:30,010 --> 03:21:30,590
There it is.

5217
03:21:31,150 --> 03:21:31,850
There you go.

5218
03:21:34,310 --> 03:21:35,810
Dark, thank you for the super chat.

5219
03:21:35,870 --> 03:21:36,650
Thank you, thank you.

5220
03:21:36,790 --> 03:21:39,390
Hey Doki, currently recovering from... Oh god.

5221
03:21:39,550 --> 03:21:41,370
From any like type of teeth thing.

5222
03:21:41,510 --> 03:21:42,230
This fucking sucks.

5223
03:21:42,870 --> 03:21:44,990
Uh, pro tip, don't have bad gums.

5224
03:21:45,050 --> 03:21:46,150
Wait, can I open this?

5225
03:21:46,490 --> 03:21:46,930
No.

5226
03:21:47,590 --> 03:21:48,550
The surgery sucks.

5227
03:21:48,790 --> 03:21:49,310
Great stream.

5228
03:21:49,350 --> 03:21:49,710
So... fuck.

5229
03:21:49,710 --> 03:21:50,790
Holy shit.

5230
03:21:50,950 --> 03:21:52,130
That fucking sucks, bro.

5231
03:21:55,010 --> 03:21:59,110
Anything related to like teeth surgery stuff is... fucking sucks.

5232
03:21:59,350 --> 03:21:59,950
In general.

5233
03:22:02,610 --> 03:22:03,870
Oh, now I can climb.

5234
03:22:06,550 --> 03:22:07,130
Nice.

5235
03:22:07,950 --> 03:22:09,530
I need like one more snake.

5236
03:22:10,150 --> 03:22:11,050
Get over here.

5237
03:22:11,990 --> 03:22:12,570
Snake.

5238
03:22:14,690 --> 03:22:15,870
I mean, I'll take money.

5239
03:22:16,710 --> 03:22:17,290
Merchant?

5240
03:22:17,490 --> 03:22:18,270
There's your thing.

5241
03:22:20,010 --> 03:22:21,490
Is this where the merchant is?

5242
03:22:23,330 --> 03:22:23,850
Merchant?

5243
03:22:24,570 --> 03:22:25,430
That's your flame.

5244
03:22:25,770 --> 03:22:26,570
Is it not?

5245
03:22:29,250 --> 03:22:30,210
What are you selling?

5246
03:22:30,710 --> 03:22:31,770
What are you selling?

5247
03:22:32,750 --> 03:22:33,910
What are you selling?

5248
03:22:34,170 --> 03:22:35,470
What are you selling?

5249
03:22:35,910 --> 03:22:36,430
Yeah.

5250
03:22:38,890 --> 03:22:39,410
Nice.

5251
03:22:39,950 --> 03:22:40,770
Wait, what's this?

5252
03:22:43,710 --> 03:22:44,230
Alright.

5253
03:22:44,790 --> 03:22:45,850
I'm gonna grab this.

5254
03:22:46,010 --> 03:22:48,730
Instead of letting your unused guns collect dust...

5255
03:22:48,730 --> 03:22:51,330
Why not sell them and spend the extra cash?

5256
03:22:51,650 --> 03:22:53,850
To upgrade a weapon you do use.

5257
03:22:54,210 --> 03:22:54,650
Okay.

5258
03:22:54,830 --> 03:22:56,490
Oh, I get almost all my money back.

5259
03:22:56,690 --> 03:22:57,190
Oh my god.

5260
03:22:57,190 --> 03:22:58,410
You're not gonna scam people?

5261
03:22:58,850 --> 03:23:00,970
You're better than regular merchants.

5262
03:23:05,830 --> 03:23:07,450
Alright, let me sell this.

5263
03:23:08,650 --> 03:23:11,290
A headdress with ra- Oh, this is where we put stones.

5264
03:23:11,430 --> 03:23:13,350
I don't think I have enough stones yet for this.

5265
03:23:13,630 --> 03:23:15,810
I need three- I need like one more ruby.

5266
03:23:17,070 --> 03:23:17,510
Uh...

5267
03:23:17,510 --> 03:23:18,830
I'm gonna sell you first.

5268
03:23:19,050 --> 03:23:19,950
I'm gonna sell you two.

5269
03:23:20,510 --> 03:23:22,970
And then I need to grab more guns.

5270
03:23:23,210 --> 03:23:23,570
Okay.

5271
03:23:24,810 --> 03:23:25,250
Uh...

5272
03:23:26,330 --> 03:23:28,810
Wait, can I- I cannot buy.

5273
03:23:30,310 --> 03:23:30,750
Oh!

5274
03:23:31,210 --> 03:23:34,610
Technically, I can trade for- I feel like I'm gonna wait until I find another ruby.

5275
03:23:36,850 --> 03:23:37,290
Uh...

5276
03:23:38,610 --> 03:23:39,410
More guns?

5277
03:23:40,390 --> 03:23:42,430
None of these guns are worth it though.

5278
03:23:42,870 --> 03:23:43,910
I don't think so.

5279
03:23:44,110 --> 03:23:45,310
None of these guns are worth it.

5280
03:23:45,350 --> 03:23:46,170
I'm gonna wait.

5281
03:23:46,670 --> 03:23:49,970
Do I- Upgrade the power of my knife?

5282
03:23:50,130 --> 03:23:51,010
Or shanky?

5283
03:23:51,810 --> 03:23:53,350
God damn it, Chris!

5284
03:23:54,990 --> 03:23:55,470
Chris!

5285
03:23:57,110 --> 03:23:58,070
Please hurry!

5286
03:23:58,430 --> 03:24:00,230
The bloodline is fading!

5287
03:24:01,330 --> 03:24:03,210
Chris, thank you for the super chat.

5288
03:24:03,310 --> 03:24:04,110
Thank you, thank you.

5289
03:24:04,390 --> 03:24:06,990
Don't- Okay, I will- I will save my money for now.

5290
03:24:07,450 --> 03:24:09,170
Where the fuck is the other typewriter?

5291
03:24:10,390 --> 03:24:10,870
Yeah.

5292
03:24:11,070 --> 03:24:11,550
Yes.

5293
03:24:13,030 --> 03:24:14,530
Wait, do I take the elevator?

5294
03:24:15,030 --> 03:24:15,910
Wait, what's the elevator?

5295
03:24:15,910 --> 03:24:17,990
Oh my god, there's so many things around me.

5296
03:24:18,470 --> 03:24:19,210
What's this?

5297
03:24:20,230 --> 03:24:21,110
Hexagon piece.

5298
03:24:21,490 --> 03:24:22,370
What's that for?

5299
03:24:23,010 --> 03:24:24,150
Oh, the church!

5300
03:24:25,730 --> 03:24:27,550
Oh my god, there's so many places.

5301
03:24:28,070 --> 03:24:29,470
Where do I go first?

5302
03:24:30,070 --> 03:24:30,610
Guys!

5303
03:24:31,530 --> 03:24:32,950
There's too many choices!

5304
03:24:34,810 --> 03:24:36,330
What is the elevator?

5305
03:24:38,030 --> 03:24:38,570
Minigame?

5306
03:24:39,250 --> 03:24:39,790
This?

5307
03:24:41,810 --> 03:24:43,010
That's a minigame?

5308
03:24:43,030 --> 03:24:43,830
Do I get anything?

5309
03:24:44,390 --> 03:24:45,770
Is this the mercenary?

5310
03:24:46,910 --> 03:24:48,730
Welcome, stranger.

5311
03:24:49,290 --> 03:24:50,190
Wait, I just gotcha!

5312
03:24:51,850 --> 03:24:52,810
Three or...

5313
03:24:52,810 --> 03:24:54,670
Is this your first time access?

5314
03:24:56,400 --> 03:24:56,940
What's this?

5315
03:25:00,680 --> 03:25:02,760
Destroy the pirates and shoot for the high score.

5316
03:25:02,960 --> 03:25:03,600
Are limited.

5317
03:25:03,820 --> 03:25:06,240
Each token based on the score for a chance to win.

5318
03:25:06,340 --> 03:25:07,080
Oh, that's easy!

5319
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:10,200
Destroy several targets by shooting nearby diamonds.

5320
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:11,580
Be careful when shooting a sailor.

5321
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:12,040
Okay.

5322
03:25:12,340 --> 03:25:14,480
Some targets cannot be destroyed with one shot.

5323
03:25:14,560 --> 03:25:16,720
Shoot as many shots until they break.

5324
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:18,180
Asserting conditions are met.

5325
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:19,080
Bonus targets...

5326
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:19,520
Oh, okay.

5327
03:25:21,060 --> 03:25:22,160
That sounds fun.

5328
03:25:28,300 --> 03:25:28,860
Alright.

5329
03:25:29,940 --> 03:25:31,000
We can do this.

5330
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:33,120
Reward.

5331
03:25:34,460 --> 03:25:36,000
We'll do the pistol first.

5332
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:36,360
Okay.

5333
03:25:36,460 --> 03:25:37,700
100% obtained.

5334
03:25:37,840 --> 03:25:39,600
At least 7000.

5335
03:25:39,860 --> 03:25:40,640
At least...

5336
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:43,760
What do the pirates and the sailors look like though?

5337
03:25:44,680 --> 03:25:45,240
Okay.

5338
03:25:46,020 --> 03:25:47,060
We can do this.

5339
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:49,080
Okay, we know...

5340
03:25:50,620 --> 03:25:51,480
Oh, shit!

5341
03:25:52,140 --> 03:25:53,560
I didn't see the fucking...

5342
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:57,480
Okay.

5343
03:25:58,540 --> 03:25:59,020
Reloading.

5344
03:25:59,620 --> 03:26:00,340
Oh, God.

5345
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:01,200
Oh, God.

5346
03:26:01,260 --> 03:26:01,820
I hate this.

5347
03:26:02,020 --> 03:26:03,020
I'm so anxious.

5348
03:26:04,980 --> 03:26:06,720
Does it matter if it's a headshot?

5349
03:26:07,860 --> 03:26:09,560
Oh, it matters if there's a skull.

5350
03:26:11,620 --> 03:26:12,680
I'm fucking up!

5351
03:26:20,440 --> 03:26:20,920
Reloading!

5352
03:26:24,870 --> 03:26:25,350
No!

5353
03:26:25,590 --> 03:26:26,730
I'm fucking...

5354
03:26:29,170 --> 03:26:30,690
I fucked up!

5355
03:26:30,790 --> 03:26:32,250
I got... No!

5356
03:26:32,550 --> 03:26:35,190
Okay, okay, okay, I understand now.

5357
03:26:35,270 --> 03:26:35,630
I understand.

5358
03:26:36,070 --> 03:26:36,950
I understand.

5359
03:26:37,450 --> 03:26:40,810
I was... I understand now.

5360
03:26:40,970 --> 03:26:41,490
Okay.

5361
03:26:43,370 --> 03:26:45,290
Guys, I figured it out.

5362
03:26:46,170 --> 03:26:46,930
Okay.

5363
03:26:48,990 --> 03:26:50,090
Okay, there we go.

5364
03:26:50,150 --> 03:26:50,810
Reload.

5365
03:26:50,810 --> 03:26:51,570
Reloading.

5366
03:26:51,930 --> 03:26:52,690
Reloading.

5367
03:26:53,010 --> 03:26:53,770
Okay.

5368
03:26:53,770 --> 03:26:53,930
Okay.

5369
03:26:57,550 --> 03:27:00,270
There's like a... There's like a need.

5370
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:07,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5371
03:27:07,060 --> 03:27:07,640
Get over here.

5372
03:27:09,900 --> 03:27:10,340
Okay.

5373
03:27:10,340 --> 03:27:10,920
We're good.

5374
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:11,280
We're okay.

5375
03:27:20,330 --> 03:27:21,410
What's the bonus time?

5376
03:27:24,700 --> 03:27:26,120
There's falloff!

5377
03:27:39,960 --> 03:27:41,320
Okay, 4 out of 6.

5378
03:27:41,440 --> 03:27:42,000
Okay, nice.

5379
03:27:42,740 --> 03:27:43,500
Gold token.

5380
03:27:43,580 --> 03:27:44,020
Nice.

5381
03:27:44,100 --> 03:27:44,440
Okay.

5382
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:45,480
We're good.

5383
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:46,860
We're okay.

5384
03:27:46,860 --> 03:27:47,060
Okay.

5385
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:48,200
100%!

5386
03:27:48,220 --> 03:27:50,520
Okay, we're gonna get that 100%.

5387
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:51,400
Okay.

5388
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:55,620
We're gonna get that 100%.

5389
03:27:55,620 --> 03:27:57,140
We can do this.

5390
03:28:00,810 --> 03:28:01,810
Oh god.

5391
03:28:01,930 --> 03:28:02,770
That was close.

5392
03:28:03,130 --> 03:28:04,950
That was a thing close.

5393
03:28:05,770 --> 03:28:06,670
Oh god.

5394
03:28:12,350 --> 03:28:12,990
No!

5395
03:28:16,410 --> 03:28:17,050
No!

5396
03:28:19,670 --> 03:28:21,710
I can't believe I fucked up!

5397
03:28:35,320 --> 03:28:36,840
I already ruined it.

5398
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:38,080
I already ruined it.

5399
03:28:40,280 --> 03:28:41,540
It's already gone!

5400
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:45,260
No!

5401
03:28:53,100 --> 03:28:53,600
No!

5402
03:28:55,640 --> 03:28:56,840
We were so close!

5403
03:28:57,280 --> 03:28:58,120
Okay, this time.

5404
03:28:58,260 --> 03:28:58,460
This time.

5405
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:00,500
I figured it out.

5406
03:29:00,520 --> 03:29:01,040
I'm in the groove.

5407
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:03,320
I'm in the groove now.

5408
03:29:08,960 --> 03:29:09,720
Oh god.

5409
03:29:09,800 --> 03:29:10,260
That was close.

5410
03:29:10,600 --> 03:29:11,560
That was close.

5411
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:12,700
I'm in the groove.

5412
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:13,600
I'm in the groove!

5413
03:29:17,080 --> 03:29:17,720
Oh god.

5414
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:20,180
Oh god.

5415
03:29:20,780 --> 03:29:21,200
No.

5416
03:29:22,200 --> 03:29:22,620
No!

5417
03:29:22,740 --> 03:29:23,740
No no no no no no no!

5418
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:24,000
Please!

5419
03:29:28,250 --> 03:29:28,670
Oh.

5420
03:29:28,670 --> 03:29:29,470
Don't rush it!

5421
03:29:29,510 --> 03:29:30,110
Don't rush it!

5422
03:29:30,150 --> 03:29:31,150
Don't you- Don't rush it!

5423
03:29:35,180 --> 03:29:36,100
Don't rush it!

5424
03:29:36,220 --> 03:29:37,200
You don't need to rush!

5425
03:29:44,640 --> 03:29:45,480
Come on.

5426
03:29:47,620 --> 03:29:48,040
No!

5427
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:48,960
Oh!

5428
03:29:50,720 --> 03:29:51,100
Okay.

5429
03:29:51,500 --> 03:29:52,420
Come on.

5430
03:29:54,680 --> 03:29:55,440
No!

5431
03:29:59,900 --> 03:30:01,660
I give up.

5432
03:30:01,780 --> 03:30:03,620
I wanted to try the other one.

5433
03:30:03,880 --> 03:30:05,400
I give up.

5434
03:30:05,800 --> 03:30:07,180
Oh my god.

5435
03:30:08,820 --> 03:30:10,100
This is so sad.

5436
03:30:10,520 --> 03:30:12,200
This is so sad.

5437
03:30:12,840 --> 03:30:14,080
Someone please.

5438
03:30:16,060 --> 03:30:17,200
Someone please.

5439
03:30:17,200 --> 03:30:17,460
Someone please.

5440
03:30:17,780 --> 03:30:19,640
Play the saddest violin.

5441
03:30:21,400 --> 03:30:23,180
The saddest violin.

5442
03:30:27,820 --> 03:30:31,320
It truly is the saddest thing.

5443
03:30:32,020 --> 03:30:33,500
Oh, I can collide?

5444
03:30:34,320 --> 03:30:35,400
Bro, what?

5445
03:30:35,940 --> 03:30:37,420
I didn't know I can collide this.

5446
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:40,140
Oh, fuck!

5447
03:30:40,280 --> 03:30:41,460
I didn't see it!

5448
03:30:44,610 --> 03:30:46,850
I didn't see the fucking skull.

5449
03:30:47,750 --> 03:30:49,870
Oh no, are you ser- NO!

5450
03:30:50,010 --> 03:30:51,110
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

5451
03:30:53,550 --> 03:30:54,530
There's 10?

5452
03:30:55,630 --> 03:30:57,410
Where the fuck was the others?

5453
03:30:58,250 --> 03:31:00,830
I guess like the bonus ones, right?

5454
03:31:02,710 --> 03:31:03,690
Okay, wait wait.

5455
03:31:03,810 --> 03:31:04,810
This one I can do.

5456
03:31:09,370 --> 03:31:11,990
I didn't realize there was a collide.

5457
03:31:15,860 --> 03:31:16,460
Okay.

5458
03:31:17,700 --> 03:31:22,240
We don't need the fucking- We don't need a zoom in!

5459
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:25,240
We don't need a zoom in guys!

5460
03:31:25,440 --> 03:31:26,520
It's so close!

5461
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:28,360
We already have the scope!

5462
03:31:28,720 --> 03:31:28,900
Okay.

5463
03:31:31,660 --> 03:31:32,180
Whoop!

5464
03:31:32,180 --> 03:31:32,580
Collat!

5465
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:33,900
Okay.

5466
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:36,100
Whoop!

5467
03:31:36,120 --> 03:31:36,540
Collat!

5468
03:31:37,560 --> 03:31:38,080
Alright.

5469
03:31:39,140 --> 03:31:40,560
Alright, we figured this out.

5470
03:31:41,680 --> 03:31:42,280
Come on.

5471
03:31:43,660 --> 03:31:44,180
Okay.

5472
03:31:44,840 --> 03:31:47,840
I gotta make sure he doesn't have a fucking skull on him.

5473
03:31:48,120 --> 03:31:48,840
No no no.

5474
03:31:48,920 --> 03:31:49,400
Yes!

5475
03:31:49,500 --> 03:31:49,760
No!

5476
03:31:49,760 --> 03:31:50,140
No!

5477
03:31:54,300 --> 03:31:55,940
That was a hit!

5478
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:59,000
That was a fucking hit!

5479
03:31:59,100 --> 03:32:01,780
I swear that was a hit!

5480
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:05,720
That was 100% a hit.

5481
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:07,500
God damn it.

5482
03:32:08,200 --> 03:32:10,760
That was 100% a hit, man.

5483
03:32:11,720 --> 03:32:12,500
This is...

5484
03:32:14,200 --> 03:32:15,200
I hate this.

5485
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:15,980
I hate it here.

5486
03:32:16,580 --> 03:32:16,840
I...

5487
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:18,360
What?

5488
03:32:19,080 --> 03:32:19,940
Oh, it's over here.

5489
03:32:20,040 --> 03:32:20,720
I couldn't see him.

5490
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:21,880
Oh.

5491
03:32:22,960 --> 03:32:24,300
I hate it here.

5492
03:32:24,400 --> 03:32:25,440
I can't believe it.

5493
03:32:25,560 --> 03:32:27,380
I can't believe it.

5494
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:30,620
My trigger finger.

5495
03:32:30,700 --> 03:32:31,680
I'm getting old.

5496
03:32:31,900 --> 03:32:33,260
I'm getting old.

5497
03:32:38,020 --> 03:32:40,260
Alright, I'm too lazy to grab the...

5498
03:32:40,590 --> 03:32:42,900
I'm too lazy to grab the sniper.

5499
03:32:44,980 --> 03:32:45,680
Unless...

5500
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:46,420
Boom!

5501
03:32:46,540 --> 03:32:48,120
What the...

5502
03:32:48,120 --> 03:32:49,220
No!

5503
03:32:49,220 --> 03:32:49,620
No!

5504
03:32:52,590 --> 03:32:53,190
No!

5505
03:32:53,890 --> 03:32:54,570
I'm sorry!

5506
03:32:55,750 --> 03:32:57,750
I'm sorry, sailor!

5507
03:32:58,370 --> 03:33:00,590
Alright, that was not my best...

5508
03:33:00,590 --> 03:33:01,330
Okay, I'm done.

5509
03:33:01,570 --> 03:33:02,390
I'm done.

5510
03:33:02,430 --> 03:33:03,770
That was not my best one.

5511
03:33:03,910 --> 03:33:05,610
That was not my best one.

5512
03:33:06,630 --> 03:33:07,230
Um...

5513
03:33:07,230 --> 03:33:09,850
A gold can exchange all the shooting...

5514
03:33:09,850 --> 03:33:10,670
Can I do this?

5515
03:33:11,410 --> 03:33:12,350
What do I get?

5516
03:33:13,730 --> 03:33:14,330
Yay!

5517
03:33:14,330 --> 03:33:15,350
What is this?

5518
03:33:16,430 --> 03:33:18,910
I got 40% off resources.

5519
03:33:18,910 --> 03:33:19,590
Oh!

5520
03:33:22,050 --> 03:33:23,010
That's nice.

5521
03:33:23,650 --> 03:33:24,290
Okay.

5522
03:33:24,470 --> 03:33:25,710
What do I get from this?

5523
03:33:29,460 --> 03:33:30,100
I got 40% off resources.

5524
03:33:31,160 --> 03:33:35,900
20% magnum ammo craft bonus frequencies.

5525
03:33:35,940 --> 03:33:36,100
20% magnum ammo craft bonus frequencies.

5526
03:33:36,100 --> 03:33:36,620
I like that!

5527
03:33:36,920 --> 03:33:37,920
What is this?

5528
03:33:38,680 --> 03:33:38,720
What is this?

5529
03:33:42,150 --> 03:33:43,030
That's yellow!

5530
03:33:43,550 --> 03:33:46,450
40% ammo resell value.

5531
03:33:46,870 --> 03:33:47,890
Wait, what does that mean?

5532
03:33:48,810 --> 03:33:50,870
I don't know how to put the charms on.

5533
03:33:52,250 --> 03:33:54,090
Okay, but how do I put it on?

5534
03:33:54,530 --> 03:33:56,010
I didn't like...

5535
03:33:57,770 --> 03:33:58,770
Do I...

5536
03:33:58,770 --> 03:34:00,110
How do I put that on?

5537
03:34:00,330 --> 03:34:00,690
Do I...

5538
03:34:00,690 --> 03:34:02,390
It just on me this entire time?

5539
03:34:03,230 --> 03:34:04,150
Do I...

5540
03:34:04,150 --> 03:34:05,250
Oh, sell...

5541
03:34:05,250 --> 03:34:06,410
Sell ammo.

5542
03:34:08,510 --> 03:34:09,030
Typewriter!

5543
03:34:09,250 --> 03:34:10,010
Oh, okay.

5544
03:34:10,910 --> 03:34:12,490
Alright, we'll go to the typewriter.

5545
03:34:16,920 --> 03:34:17,440
Hmm.

5546
03:34:19,220 --> 03:34:20,100
Alright, nice.

5547
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:21,080
Thank you, backseaters.

5548
03:34:21,760 --> 03:34:22,280
Oh!

5549
03:34:24,500 --> 03:34:24,900
Customize.

5550
03:34:24,980 --> 03:34:25,160
Oh!

5551
03:34:25,580 --> 03:34:26,980
Wait, can I only put one?

5552
03:34:28,600 --> 03:34:29,240
Equip left.

5553
03:34:30,140 --> 03:34:31,460
Oh, I can equip everything!

5554
03:34:33,660 --> 03:34:34,500
Look at them!

5555
03:34:35,360 --> 03:34:35,960
Look at...

5556
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:37,900
I don't remember what they were, but look at them!

5557
03:34:38,500 --> 03:34:39,220
What were they?

5558
03:34:42,600 --> 03:34:43,400
Can I...

5559
03:34:43,400 --> 03:34:45,080
Can I see what they are?

5560
03:34:45,220 --> 03:34:45,820
Oh, there we go.

5561
03:34:45,940 --> 03:34:46,420
It's there.

5562
03:34:46,520 --> 03:34:46,800
Nevermind.

5563
03:34:46,940 --> 03:34:48,300
40% off resources.

5564
03:34:49,240 --> 03:34:50,740
40%... Okay, there we go.

5565
03:34:50,800 --> 03:34:51,520
We figured it out.

5566
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:54,000
Now we're gaming.

5567
03:34:54,340 --> 03:34:55,760
Yeah, I figured it out.

5568
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:57,540
I was like, what were they again?

5569
03:34:58,740 --> 03:34:59,140
Okay.

5570
03:35:01,620 --> 03:35:02,160
Let's see.

5571
03:35:02,380 --> 03:35:03,580
10,000...

5572
03:35:04,680 --> 03:35:07,200
We don't need to upgrade anything yet, so we can just chill.

5573
03:35:07,340 --> 03:35:08,280
We can chill for now.

5574
03:35:08,640 --> 03:35:10,820
Do we go downstairs or through the door?

5575
03:35:11,660 --> 03:35:13,460
I think through the door is the troll.

5576
03:35:15,420 --> 03:35:16,660
Backseater save the...

5577
03:35:16,660 --> 03:35:17,300
Oh, wait, did I just save?

5578
03:35:17,380 --> 03:35:18,060
I don't remember what I saved.

5579
03:35:18,140 --> 03:35:18,620
I'm gonna save again.

5580
03:35:19,920 --> 03:35:20,680
Repair a knife?

5581
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:21,440
Oh, shit.

5582
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:22,640
Did I not repair it?

5583
03:35:23,900 --> 03:35:24,700
Tune up.

5584
03:35:25,320 --> 03:35:25,960
Let's see.

5585
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:28,160
It's alright.

5586
03:35:28,400 --> 03:35:29,800
It has a lot of HP.

5587
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:34,280
Alright.

5588
03:35:34,960 --> 03:35:36,220
Do we go downstairs?

5589
03:35:36,500 --> 03:35:37,500
Or through the door?

5590
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:42,080
I hear very conflicting answers, so I went downstairs.

5591
03:35:48,470 --> 03:35:48,990
Okay.

5592
03:35:52,970 --> 03:35:54,310
Shoot the lake?

5593
03:35:54,590 --> 03:35:55,450
Okay, guys.

5594
03:35:55,510 --> 03:35:56,270
This is it.

5595
03:35:56,670 --> 03:35:57,470
This is it.

5596
03:35:58,370 --> 03:35:59,350
I can shoot this.

5597
03:36:01,770 --> 03:36:02,530
This is it.

5598
03:36:02,690 --> 03:36:03,490
Are we here?

5599
03:36:07,110 --> 03:36:08,650
Oh, not this lake?

5600
03:36:08,730 --> 03:36:09,870
God damn it.

5601
03:36:12,370 --> 03:36:13,330
Wrong lake.

5602
03:36:13,430 --> 03:36:16,670
I am just listening to what you guys are telling me, guys.

5603
03:36:17,430 --> 03:36:18,890
Wait, but then what's through the door?

5604
03:36:21,290 --> 03:36:22,050
Oh, wait.

5605
03:36:22,630 --> 03:36:23,030
This is just loot.

5606
03:36:23,110 --> 03:36:23,410
Nice.

5607
03:36:24,270 --> 03:36:24,910
That's good.

5608
03:36:25,110 --> 03:36:25,870
It's just loot.

5609
03:36:26,050 --> 03:36:26,610
What the fuck?

5610
03:36:26,690 --> 03:36:27,250
What's that sound?

5611
03:36:28,470 --> 03:36:30,010
Is there any more loot in there?

5612
03:36:30,810 --> 03:36:31,250
Loot?

5613
03:36:32,730 --> 03:36:33,550
No more loot.

5614
03:36:35,810 --> 03:36:38,350
Guys, one day we'll get to the right lake, guys.

5615
03:36:38,470 --> 03:36:39,530
It's just not today.

5616
03:36:40,230 --> 03:36:42,330
We just haven't made it to the right lake.

5617
03:36:46,490 --> 03:36:46,930
Collectible?

5618
03:36:46,930 --> 03:36:48,150
Oh, I didn't even hear that.

5619
03:36:49,350 --> 03:36:50,330
Guys, there's so...

5620
03:36:50,330 --> 03:36:52,230
Oh, that's the sound I was hearing!

5621
03:36:55,150 --> 03:36:56,990
I was like wondering what that sound was.

5622
03:37:02,120 --> 03:37:03,080
Oh, there he is.

5623
03:37:03,160 --> 03:37:04,220
Oh my god, how did I miss?

5624
03:37:04,680 --> 03:37:05,420
There he is.

5625
03:37:06,500 --> 03:37:07,540
That's what it was.

5626
03:37:09,100 --> 03:37:10,560
It was just a loot detour.

5627
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:10,780
Yeah.

5628
03:37:11,080 --> 03:37:12,500
I got my tangerines!

5629
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:13,600
Let's go!

5630
03:37:16,740 --> 03:37:17,180
Alright.

5631
03:37:17,280 --> 03:37:18,340
Is it time to fight?

5632
03:37:18,440 --> 03:37:18,960
Okay, fine.

5633
03:37:19,420 --> 03:37:19,860
Fine!

5634
03:37:20,160 --> 03:37:21,100
I'll repair it.

5635
03:37:21,180 --> 03:37:21,900
I have enough money.

5636
03:37:23,060 --> 03:37:23,740
Alright, guys.

5637
03:37:23,840 --> 03:37:24,240
It's time!

5638
03:37:24,980 --> 03:37:25,960
It's troll time!

5639
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:28,900
I need to make sure I reload everything.

5640
03:37:29,820 --> 03:37:32,400
I need to make sure everything is reloaded.

5641
03:37:32,720 --> 03:37:33,480
Okay, let me see.

5642
03:37:33,580 --> 03:37:34,840
Do I have... Oh, I have enough to craft.

5643
03:37:35,040 --> 03:37:35,540
Okay, nice.

5644
03:37:35,580 --> 03:37:36,240
Okay, craft.

5645
03:37:37,180 --> 03:37:37,640
Rifle.

5646
03:37:38,060 --> 03:37:39,340
You need a rifle anyway.

5647
03:37:40,100 --> 03:37:40,560
Okay.

5648
03:37:40,800 --> 03:37:43,160
Put that here.

5649
03:37:44,080 --> 03:37:45,780
Do I have enough to craft another one?

5650
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:48,700
It's time.

5651
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:50,820
It's craft time.

5652
03:37:52,720 --> 03:37:53,560
Here we go.

5653
03:37:54,520 --> 03:37:55,960
It's time for the troll!

5654
03:37:57,440 --> 03:37:58,260
Wait, is it?

5655
03:38:01,320 --> 03:38:02,560
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

5656
03:38:02,660 --> 03:38:03,260
Oh, it's this way.

5657
03:38:03,360 --> 03:38:03,600
Whoops.

5658
03:38:04,760 --> 03:38:05,200
Sorry.

5659
03:38:06,260 --> 03:38:07,700
Sorry, it was this way.

5660
03:38:07,880 --> 03:38:08,480
Never mind!

5661
03:38:08,580 --> 03:38:09,580
It's not troll time!

5662
03:38:10,760 --> 03:38:12,120
It's not troll time!

5663
03:38:12,620 --> 03:38:13,680
It's fish time!

5664
03:38:14,940 --> 03:38:15,800
Fish this early?

5665
03:38:18,940 --> 03:38:19,380
Hello.

5666
03:38:20,180 --> 03:38:20,920
Oh, it is!

5667
03:38:27,290 --> 03:38:29,230
When will I meet my bro again?

5668
03:38:29,590 --> 03:38:30,450
Wait, who is he throwing?

5669
03:38:31,050 --> 03:38:32,190
Wait, is that the...

5670
03:38:32,190 --> 03:38:33,090
Wait, who?

5671
03:38:33,990 --> 03:38:34,730
Who is he?

5672
03:38:35,790 --> 03:38:37,470
Oh, it's the first cop!

5673
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:47,920
Where's our friend?

5674
03:38:49,100 --> 03:38:50,280
That's our best friend.

5675
03:38:53,790 --> 03:38:54,570
Is that loot?

5676
03:38:54,810 --> 03:38:55,590
Okay, loot.

5677
03:38:56,630 --> 03:38:57,070
Loot.

5678
03:38:58,470 --> 03:38:59,910
Oh my god, look at all this loot.

5679
03:39:00,090 --> 03:39:01,150
That I'm definitely not gonna...

5680
03:39:01,150 --> 03:39:02,370
Wait, can I shoot the loot here?

5681
03:39:03,090 --> 03:39:04,930
This is a good use of my rifle ammo.

5682
03:39:11,960 --> 03:39:13,000
I feel like...

5683
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:14,460
Wait, will I be able to shoot the loot?

5684
03:39:17,480 --> 03:39:18,320
Shoot it.

5685
03:39:18,420 --> 03:39:19,200
It's not...

5686
03:39:19,200 --> 03:39:20,260
It was not worth it, guys.

5687
03:39:20,320 --> 03:39:22,000
The rifle ammo takes a while.

5688
03:39:25,300 --> 03:39:26,260
Guys, guys.

5689
03:39:26,360 --> 03:39:28,040
It was one rifle...

5690
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:29,420
Wait, for 1k?

5691
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:31,640
Oh my god, it's worth it!

5692
03:39:32,200 --> 03:39:33,060
Holy shit!

5693
03:39:33,160 --> 03:39:33,440
Okay.

5694
03:39:33,660 --> 03:39:34,520
Okay, 1k.

5695
03:39:35,900 --> 03:39:37,480
Yo, bro, it's worth it, guys.

5696
03:39:38,800 --> 03:39:39,280
Okay.

5697
03:39:40,880 --> 03:39:42,140
Oh my god!

5698
03:39:43,020 --> 03:39:43,800
It's okay!

5699
03:39:43,940 --> 03:39:45,160
It's so worth it!

5700
03:39:45,440 --> 03:39:46,680
Where's the other one?

5701
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:49,120
This is so worth it.

5702
03:39:49,260 --> 03:39:50,220
Where are the others?

5703
03:39:50,740 --> 03:39:52,680
Wait, hope I can get those later.

5704
03:39:55,080 --> 03:39:59,240
Bro, wait, can I get this later?

5705
03:39:59,880 --> 03:40:01,500
Did I just waste my money?

5706
03:40:02,120 --> 03:40:02,780
I just...

5707
03:40:02,780 --> 03:40:05,340
Bro, one bullet is practically 1k.

5708
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:06,320
Not gonna lie.

5709
03:40:07,400 --> 03:40:08,800
That's a shit note.

5710
03:40:11,120 --> 03:40:12,960
Oh, I get them for... whoops!

5711
03:40:13,680 --> 03:40:15,160
Whoops, that's awkward.

5712
03:40:18,300 --> 03:40:19,700
That's fucking awkward.

5713
03:40:20,400 --> 03:40:22,980
I thought it was never gonna be free.

5714
03:40:24,480 --> 03:40:25,080
Whoopsie.

5715
03:40:25,800 --> 03:40:26,660
Oh well.

5716
03:40:27,420 --> 03:40:28,860
It's good to know now!

5717
03:40:29,160 --> 03:40:34,520
The boat fuel is stored with the generator fuel inside the processing building at the fish farm.

5718
03:40:34,980 --> 03:40:36,640
Take only what you need.

5719
03:40:37,340 --> 03:40:37,940
Dab.

5720
03:40:40,440 --> 03:40:41,900
Well, it's good to know now.

5721
03:40:42,540 --> 03:40:43,580
I know now, guys.

5722
03:40:44,220 --> 03:40:44,700
What's this?

5723
03:40:44,820 --> 03:40:45,340
Is this a puzzle?

5724
03:40:48,100 --> 03:40:49,060
Oh, I need to find more.

5725
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:53,800
Alright.

5726
03:40:54,060 --> 03:40:55,380
Is this the lake, guys?

5727
03:40:55,440 --> 03:40:56,520
Did we find the lake?

5728
03:40:58,360 --> 03:41:00,240
Did we finally make...

5729
03:41:00,240 --> 03:41:01,100
Oh wait, there's some...

5730
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:02,520
Where is it?

5731
03:41:03,100 --> 03:41:03,860
There's one here.

5732
03:41:05,560 --> 03:41:07,380
Where the fuck is that blue medallion?

5733
03:41:11,170 --> 03:41:13,090
There's a blue medallion here somewhere.

5734
03:41:13,310 --> 03:41:14,390
Oh, I'm not looking at it.

5735
03:41:14,430 --> 03:41:15,510
The right direction?

5736
03:41:18,450 --> 03:41:19,250
Question mark?

5737
03:41:20,590 --> 03:41:21,690
Is it in here?

5738
03:41:26,320 --> 03:41:27,620
Okay, I'm not gonna do it.

5739
03:41:27,640 --> 03:41:29,620
Do it now because I feel like...

5740
03:41:29,620 --> 03:41:31,100
Alright, we're gonna shoot the lake.

5741
03:41:32,060 --> 03:41:32,540
Hello.

5742
03:41:33,380 --> 03:41:34,720
Just like old times.

5743
03:41:36,360 --> 03:41:37,660
Just like old times.

5744
03:41:39,200 --> 03:41:40,040
What the fuck?

5745
03:41:40,120 --> 03:41:40,980
Oh, wait, what?

5746
03:41:43,440 --> 03:41:43,920
Oh!

5747
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:47,360
Okay.

5748
03:41:47,500 --> 03:41:48,540
Just like old times.

5749
03:41:53,140 --> 03:41:53,620
Yeah!

5750
03:41:53,780 --> 03:41:55,320
I did the whole thing again!

5751
03:41:58,060 --> 03:41:59,180
When did I save?

5752
03:42:01,540 --> 03:42:03,000
Did I do this?

5753
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:05,480
Guys, I don't remember when I last saved.

5754
03:42:08,360 --> 03:42:09,900
When was my last save?

5755
03:42:10,740 --> 03:42:11,220
When?

5756
03:42:13,460 --> 03:42:14,440
Okay, I have to do this.

5757
03:42:14,460 --> 03:42:14,800
I have to do this again.

5758
03:42:15,080 --> 03:42:17,520
I don't remember.

5759
03:42:18,260 --> 03:42:20,560
Now I have to do this again.

5760
03:42:22,420 --> 03:42:23,740
Oh my god.

5761
03:42:24,300 --> 03:42:24,940
Boop.

5762
03:42:27,360 --> 03:42:29,740
I thought they would autosave me earlier.

5763
03:42:30,040 --> 03:42:31,280
But I was wrong.

5764
03:42:32,580 --> 03:42:34,780
The autosave was not that.

5765
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:37,100
It was not there.

5766
03:42:37,840 --> 03:42:38,260
It was not there.

5767
03:42:38,260 --> 03:42:38,560
It was not there.

5768
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:40,080
I already shoot him?

5769
03:42:40,220 --> 03:42:40,880
I already did.

5770
03:42:42,240 --> 03:42:43,580
Oh my god.

5771
03:42:44,460 --> 03:42:45,880
Did I repair my knife?

5772
03:42:46,420 --> 03:42:47,480
Okay, well, no.

5773
03:42:47,520 --> 03:42:49,520
But if I repaired my knife...

5774
03:42:50,680 --> 03:42:51,420
Okay, wait.

5775
03:42:51,480 --> 03:42:51,900
Let's see.

5776
03:42:52,260 --> 03:42:53,500
Did I repair it?

5777
03:42:54,120 --> 03:42:55,100
I didn't.

5778
03:42:56,720 --> 03:42:57,760
Oh god.

5779
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:59,060
Okay, let's...

5780
03:43:00,240 --> 03:43:02,060
Okay, I customized the case.

5781
03:43:02,100 --> 03:43:02,780
Okay, that's good.

5782
03:43:03,280 --> 03:43:04,240
That's good.

5783
03:43:06,840 --> 03:43:07,360
Okay.

5784
03:43:07,660 --> 03:43:09,680
I customized the case.

5785
03:43:10,100 --> 03:43:10,780
That's good.

5786
03:43:10,860 --> 03:43:11,320
We're okay.

5787
03:43:11,320 --> 03:43:12,000
We're okay.

5788
03:43:13,320 --> 03:43:14,720
Case has been customized.

5789
03:43:14,840 --> 03:43:16,420
I don't have to worry about that.

5790
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:17,480
Alright.

5791
03:43:17,980 --> 03:43:19,480
I already have it.

5792
03:43:19,480 --> 03:43:20,260
I already have everything.

5793
03:43:21,580 --> 03:43:22,060
Alright.

5794
03:43:22,900 --> 03:43:24,020
Back here we go.

5795
03:43:24,200 --> 03:43:26,200
It's time to look at the fish again.

5796
03:43:27,520 --> 03:43:28,200
It's okay.

5797
03:43:28,260 --> 03:43:30,020
I saved my rifle ammo.

5798
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:32,740
It's okay.

5799
03:43:32,800 --> 03:43:33,760
We can watch this again.

5800
03:43:33,800 --> 03:43:34,200
Our friend.

5801
03:43:39,330 --> 03:43:41,350
Yeah, we didn't waste any ammo, guys.

5802
03:43:41,630 --> 03:43:42,930
That's the best part.

5803
03:43:43,630 --> 03:43:44,490
We did it.

5804
03:43:44,610 --> 03:43:45,230
We did it.

5805
03:43:46,010 --> 03:43:46,830
We did it.

5806
03:43:48,210 --> 03:43:48,690
Nice.

5807
03:43:49,590 --> 03:43:50,070
Goodbye.

5808
03:43:50,310 --> 03:43:50,790
Wait, I can skip?

5809
03:43:50,990 --> 03:43:51,710
Oh, I can skip.

5810
03:43:52,070 --> 03:43:53,450
No, we won't watch this again.

5811
03:43:53,710 --> 03:43:54,090
Yay.

5812
03:43:55,430 --> 03:43:56,550
Goodbye, fish.

5813
03:43:58,470 --> 03:43:58,950
Goodbye.

5814
03:43:59,690 --> 03:44:02,490
Yeah, that was my first death because of the fucking fish.

5815
03:44:03,370 --> 03:44:04,270
Where's the castle?

5816
03:44:04,550 --> 03:44:05,670
It's almost like look at the castle.

5817
03:44:05,890 --> 03:44:06,330
Oh, I can.

5818
03:44:06,650 --> 03:44:06,970
Damn.

5819
03:44:08,610 --> 03:44:10,490
He's like Lord Farquaad.

5820
03:44:10,630 --> 03:44:11,570
He's compensating.

5821
03:44:12,530 --> 03:44:13,890
Oh yeah, he's just...

5822
03:44:14,610 --> 03:44:15,710
He's as short as him too.

5823
03:44:16,710 --> 03:44:18,870
He is just like Lord Farquaad.

5824
03:44:22,350 --> 03:44:23,550
I'm not gonna shoot the water.

5825
03:44:25,330 --> 03:44:27,650
We've already established the water.

5826
03:44:28,310 --> 03:44:28,490
We've already established the water.

5827
03:44:31,930 --> 03:44:33,530
Gotta get the money.

5828
03:44:34,370 --> 03:44:35,310
The money.

5829
03:44:36,830 --> 03:44:39,390
Alright, let's put this guy in.

5830
03:44:39,610 --> 03:44:40,550
We need like two more.

5831
03:44:41,930 --> 03:44:42,490
Uh...

5832
03:44:42,490 --> 03:44:43,050
Hello.

5833
03:44:45,290 --> 03:44:45,850
Arrows.

5834
03:44:46,370 --> 03:44:46,930
Nice.

5835
03:44:47,050 --> 03:44:47,690
Got our loot.

5836
03:44:48,590 --> 03:44:49,910
And some herbs.

5837
03:44:50,550 --> 03:44:52,130
And another kitchen knife.

5838
03:44:52,990 --> 03:44:54,390
Good old kitchen knife.

5839
03:44:55,050 --> 03:44:56,110
I'm not gonna...

5840
03:44:56,110 --> 03:44:57,550
Guys, I'm not looting this again.

5841
03:45:00,110 --> 03:45:01,990
Can't make me loot this again.

5842
03:45:03,650 --> 03:45:05,010
Wait, is there an egg in here?

5843
03:45:06,290 --> 03:45:07,130
Oh, ammo.

5844
03:45:07,270 --> 03:45:08,650
That's even better than an egg.

5845
03:45:10,850 --> 03:45:11,450
Ammo.

5846
03:45:11,670 --> 03:45:12,790
That's even better.

5847
03:45:13,270 --> 03:45:16,010
And I saved my two rifle ammo from earlier.

5848
03:45:16,330 --> 03:45:17,530
Alright, we're not gonna...

5849
03:45:17,530 --> 03:45:19,870
We're not gonna shoot the lake again.

5850
03:45:20,830 --> 03:45:21,890
Uh... Oh yeah.

5851
03:45:22,050 --> 03:45:24,290
Wait, we need to figure out where the medallion is.

5852
03:45:25,130 --> 03:45:26,530
Guys, where is the medallion?

5853
03:45:27,230 --> 03:45:28,090
It's like...

5854
03:45:28,090 --> 03:45:28,770
Somewhere here.

5855
03:45:30,190 --> 03:45:31,250
It's not...

5856
03:45:31,250 --> 03:45:32,750
Up above?

5857
03:45:33,530 --> 03:45:35,250
Wait, where is the medallion?

5858
03:45:39,260 --> 03:45:39,860
Under?

5859
03:45:40,680 --> 03:45:41,280
Here?

5860
03:45:43,580 --> 03:45:44,760
I don't see it.

5861
03:45:44,900 --> 03:45:45,420
I don't see it.

5862
03:45:46,260 --> 03:45:47,480
Wait, where is it?

5863
03:45:49,020 --> 03:45:50,640
Where the fuck is the medallion?

5864
03:45:51,720 --> 03:45:53,020
Where the fuck is the medallion?

5865
03:45:53,280 --> 03:45:54,240
Guys, I don't know.

5866
03:45:54,400 --> 03:45:55,020
Let's go back.

5867
03:45:56,120 --> 03:45:58,480
Guys, I don't know.

5868
03:45:58,600 --> 03:45:59,420
I don't feel so good.

5869
03:46:01,180 --> 03:46:02,600
Oh, there it is.

5870
03:46:02,880 --> 03:46:03,660
Thank god.

5871
03:46:05,660 --> 03:46:06,600
Oh, thank god.

5872
03:46:06,680 --> 03:46:06,920
Okay.

5873
03:46:07,500 --> 03:46:08,860
I got scared.

5874
03:46:09,080 --> 03:46:10,800
I actually got scared.

5875
03:46:12,400 --> 03:46:12,760
I don't know.

5876
03:46:12,780 --> 03:46:14,480
I don't really want to go back there, guys.

5877
03:46:16,180 --> 03:46:17,420
There's like something above.

5878
03:46:20,140 --> 03:46:20,880
Like here?

5879
03:46:23,300 --> 03:46:24,560
There's something back there.

5880
03:46:24,620 --> 03:46:26,760
Do I go back there?

5881
03:46:27,340 --> 03:46:27,800
Or...

5882
03:46:29,240 --> 03:46:31,160
I don't know if I should go back here.

5883
03:46:35,150 --> 03:46:37,810
I'm worried this is gonna advance the...

5884
03:46:38,470 --> 03:46:41,270
Okay, this is gonna advance stuff.

5885
03:46:43,890 --> 03:46:44,610
There's the bed.

5886
03:46:44,610 --> 03:46:46,210
Oh, do I click the boat?

5887
03:46:48,090 --> 03:46:49,150
Yeah, check the boat.

5888
03:46:49,210 --> 03:46:49,850
I'm gonna check the boat.

5889
03:46:51,770 --> 03:46:53,530
It's like there was a boat there too.

5890
03:46:53,850 --> 03:46:54,650
I swear to god.

5891
03:46:54,690 --> 03:46:56,550
If the fucking fish eats me while I look at the boat.

5892
03:46:56,770 --> 03:46:58,250
I swear to fucking god.

5893
03:46:58,310 --> 03:46:58,530
Okay.

5894
03:46:59,630 --> 03:47:00,030
Okay.

5895
03:47:00,990 --> 03:47:03,610
Oh, it's the gas thing.

5896
03:47:03,730 --> 03:47:04,670
It's the gas mission.

5897
03:47:05,550 --> 03:47:06,330
Oh, thank god.

5898
03:47:06,370 --> 03:47:06,610
Okay.

5899
03:47:06,970 --> 03:47:08,910
I swear to god.

5900
03:47:08,970 --> 03:47:11,870
If I check the boat and the fish comes out.

5901
03:47:11,870 --> 03:47:13,110
I swear to fucking god.

5902
03:47:14,610 --> 03:47:15,670
I'm not gonna...

5903
03:47:15,670 --> 03:47:16,770
I shot the lake.

5904
03:47:16,890 --> 03:47:18,410
I already shot the lake.

5905
03:47:18,590 --> 03:47:20,130
I'm not doing that again.

5906
03:47:21,350 --> 03:47:21,830
Alright.

5907
03:47:22,090 --> 03:47:22,510
Hello?

5908
03:47:25,290 --> 03:47:25,770
No!

5909
03:47:26,390 --> 03:47:26,510
No!

5910
03:47:27,510 --> 03:47:28,410
Oh, oh.

5911
03:47:28,470 --> 03:47:29,330
Okay, okay, okay.

5912
03:47:29,490 --> 03:47:30,550
The fish can't be here.

5913
03:47:30,710 --> 03:47:31,890
It's too fucking...

5914
03:47:31,890 --> 03:47:33,430
It's not deep enough.

5915
03:47:37,700 --> 03:47:38,960
Oh, wait a minute.

5916
03:47:39,640 --> 03:47:40,560
It's him again.

5917
03:47:40,760 --> 03:47:41,480
Oh, shit.

5918
03:47:41,540 --> 03:47:42,300
Okay, that scared me.

5919
03:47:42,340 --> 03:47:43,540
I thought like I got shot at.

5920
03:47:43,720 --> 03:47:44,180
I thought I got shot at myself.

5921
03:47:45,740 --> 03:47:46,180
Okay.

5922
03:47:49,200 --> 03:47:49,640
Woo!

5923
03:47:52,980 --> 03:47:53,420
Okay.

5924
03:47:53,880 --> 03:47:55,020
Granny, get out of here.

5925
03:47:55,120 --> 03:47:56,100
Oh, granny, please.

5926
03:47:56,280 --> 03:47:56,700
Get st...

5927
03:47:56,700 --> 03:47:58,180
Oh, I can't get there in time.

5928
03:47:58,540 --> 03:48:00,000
I can't get there in time.

5929
03:48:00,240 --> 03:48:00,680
Granny!

5930
03:48:01,040 --> 03:48:02,120
Oh, oh, wait.

5931
03:48:02,360 --> 03:48:03,440
Wait, he's pretty big.

5932
03:48:10,800 --> 03:48:11,680
Oh, no.

5933
03:48:12,280 --> 03:48:14,240
Oh, no, he's gonna turn, but I don't have time.

5934
03:48:14,420 --> 03:48:15,600
I don't have time.

5935
03:48:16,420 --> 03:48:17,680
I don't have time.

5936
03:48:21,970 --> 03:48:23,250
Oh, shit.

5937
03:48:24,910 --> 03:48:26,410
Okay, that hit her head.

5938
03:48:26,690 --> 03:48:29,590
That was not what I wanted to do, but that's fine.

5939
03:48:35,620 --> 03:48:37,560
Jesus Christ, that took so long.

5940
03:48:38,300 --> 03:48:38,760
Alright.

5941
03:48:38,760 --> 03:48:39,460
That's okay.

5942
03:48:39,860 --> 03:48:40,340
It's okay.

5943
03:48:40,400 --> 03:48:41,080
I still lived.

5944
03:48:42,140 --> 03:48:44,440
That scared the shit out of me, but I still lived.

5945
03:48:46,520 --> 03:48:49,080
It hit her head, but it still worked.

5946
03:48:49,440 --> 03:48:49,900
Okay?

5947
03:48:50,440 --> 03:48:51,720
It still worked.

5948
03:48:51,740 --> 03:48:52,760
That's all that mattered.

5949
03:48:52,760 --> 03:48:52,800
That's all that mattered.

5950
03:48:54,720 --> 03:48:56,520
The fucking ricochet there.

5951
03:48:58,100 --> 03:48:58,840
Wait, what?

5952
03:48:58,960 --> 03:48:59,720
I heard a snake.

5953
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:01,780
That's fucking right.

5954
03:49:02,160 --> 03:49:03,800
You can't get away from me.

5955
03:49:04,280 --> 03:49:05,460
I need that money.

5956
03:49:06,520 --> 03:49:07,340
Okay, hand grenade.

5957
03:49:09,380 --> 03:49:10,520
I think that...

5958
03:49:10,520 --> 03:49:11,980
That was such a waste of a grenade.

5959
03:49:13,980 --> 03:49:17,280
I did not need to fucking do that.

5960
03:49:18,400 --> 03:49:19,680
Okay, high ground.

5961
03:49:21,600 --> 03:49:22,080
Okay.

5962
03:49:22,240 --> 03:49:23,400
We'll take the high ground.

5963
03:49:24,800 --> 03:49:26,700
I'm already lost, by the way.

5964
03:49:28,140 --> 03:49:29,100
I am...

5965
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:30,200
Did I come from here?

5966
03:49:30,300 --> 03:49:31,440
I came from here, right?

5967
03:49:31,540 --> 03:49:32,380
No, I did not.

5968
03:49:33,740 --> 03:49:34,620
Wait a minute.

5969
03:49:35,560 --> 03:49:36,040
Whoa!

5970
03:49:36,220 --> 03:49:37,140
What's that sound?

5971
03:49:39,920 --> 03:49:40,400
Arrows?

5972
03:49:42,660 --> 03:49:43,140
Someone...

5973
03:49:43,600 --> 03:49:44,540
shot an arrow?

5974
03:49:48,080 --> 03:49:49,200
I don't see anybody.

5975
03:49:50,360 --> 03:49:51,300
Am I safe?

5976
03:49:52,720 --> 03:49:53,740
I think I'm good.

5977
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:54,200
Right?

5978
03:49:55,700 --> 03:49:56,620
Down I go.

5979
03:49:58,040 --> 03:49:59,680
We need our map emote back.

5980
03:50:03,500 --> 03:50:06,040
I'll just photoshop a map on top of my dog.

5981
03:50:07,620 --> 03:50:08,420
Wait, wait!

5982
03:50:08,420 --> 03:50:09,400
There is an arrow!

5983
03:50:10,320 --> 03:50:11,760
I'm a better sniper than you though.

5984
03:50:13,700 --> 03:50:14,480
There you go.

5985
03:50:15,080 --> 03:50:15,520
Headshot.

5986
03:50:17,520 --> 03:50:18,060
That's right.

5987
03:50:18,120 --> 03:50:19,040
I don't need no flames.

5988
03:50:22,160 --> 03:50:22,620
Okay.

5989
03:50:22,760 --> 03:50:23,840
Is there anything I'm missing?

5990
03:50:24,280 --> 03:50:25,780
There's one more medallion here.

5991
03:50:28,080 --> 03:50:29,980
I'm gonna make sure I kill everybody first.

5992
03:50:30,620 --> 03:50:31,520
Wait, where's that?

5993
03:50:31,780 --> 03:50:32,540
Oh, there he is.

5994
03:50:33,340 --> 03:50:34,340
Wrong way, sucker.

5995
03:50:35,400 --> 03:50:35,860
Loser.

5996
03:50:37,540 --> 03:50:38,460
Wrong way.

5997
03:50:40,840 --> 03:50:41,340
Come on.

5998
03:50:42,700 --> 03:50:43,720
That's sucking right.

5999
03:50:44,120 --> 03:50:44,980
Please don't turn.

6000
03:50:45,100 --> 03:50:45,660
Please don't turn.

6001
03:50:45,840 --> 03:50:46,420
Oh, thank god.

6002
03:50:46,760 --> 03:50:47,560
Oh, shit!

6003
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:49,640
That's fine.

6004
03:50:51,080 --> 03:50:51,780
That's fine.

6005
03:50:53,980 --> 03:50:54,500
Easy.

6006
03:50:54,800 --> 03:50:55,720
Oh, oh!

6007
03:50:58,460 --> 03:50:59,200
There you go.

6008
03:50:59,880 --> 03:51:00,940
Wait, you're still alive?

6009
03:51:02,100 --> 03:51:02,880
There you go.

6010
03:51:05,100 --> 03:51:06,360
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

6011
03:51:06,540 --> 03:51:07,700
I heard beep, beep, beep, beep!

6012
03:51:07,920 --> 03:51:08,580
Oh, shit!

6013
03:51:09,320 --> 03:51:09,840
Head!

6014
03:51:10,020 --> 03:51:10,920
Oh, shit!

6015
03:51:14,620 --> 03:51:16,020
I heard beeps!

6016
03:51:16,300 --> 03:51:16,640
Woo!

6017
03:51:17,020 --> 03:51:17,540
Oh, shit!

6018
03:51:18,420 --> 03:51:18,900
No!

6019
03:51:19,160 --> 03:51:19,780
I think the one!

6020
03:51:22,060 --> 03:51:22,780
Oh, shit!

6021
03:51:25,620 --> 03:51:27,080
Oh, there's so many of you!

6022
03:51:27,240 --> 03:51:27,760
Oh, shit!

6023
03:51:27,800 --> 03:51:28,260
Oh, god!

6024
03:51:28,440 --> 03:51:29,180
Oh, shit!

6025
03:51:29,280 --> 03:51:29,900
My kitchen knife!

6026
03:51:30,020 --> 03:51:30,600
Kitchen knife!

6027
03:51:32,260 --> 03:51:32,740
Please!

6028
03:51:33,020 --> 03:51:33,500
Please!

6029
03:51:33,540 --> 03:51:34,100
Kitchen knife!

6030
03:51:34,880 --> 03:51:35,760
Oh, my god.

6031
03:51:36,820 --> 03:51:37,300
There.

6032
03:51:38,320 --> 03:51:38,620
Ah!

6033
03:51:38,800 --> 03:51:39,120
Shit!

6034
03:51:39,180 --> 03:51:39,860
Kitchen knife!

6035
03:51:40,400 --> 03:51:41,120
Kitchen knife!

6036
03:51:45,360 --> 03:51:45,840
Whoop.

6037
03:51:45,940 --> 03:51:46,420
Okay.

6038
03:51:47,080 --> 03:51:48,340
Oh, my god!

6039
03:51:49,400 --> 03:51:49,940
That was worth it!

6040
03:51:52,020 --> 03:51:52,700
There you go.

6041
03:51:53,400 --> 03:51:54,620
It was so worth it.

6042
03:51:56,060 --> 03:51:56,500
Wait.

6043
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:57,620
Oh, no.

6044
03:51:57,660 --> 03:51:58,040
He's dead.

6045
03:51:58,620 --> 03:51:59,060
Alright.

6046
03:51:59,120 --> 03:51:59,500
We're fine.

6047
03:51:59,600 --> 03:51:59,880
We're fine.

6048
03:51:59,960 --> 03:52:01,040
You saw the parries, though?

6049
03:52:01,260 --> 03:52:01,620
Dude!

6050
03:52:01,640 --> 03:52:02,780
That parry, though!

6051
03:52:03,660 --> 03:52:05,660
That was some sick parry!

6052
03:52:06,800 --> 03:52:07,240
Alright.

6053
03:52:07,340 --> 03:52:08,000
Let's see.

6054
03:52:08,180 --> 03:52:08,900
We gotta...

6055
03:52:08,900 --> 03:52:10,320
We can eat our eggs now.

6056
03:52:10,640 --> 03:52:12,240
You know, we can...

6057
03:52:12,240 --> 03:52:13,820
We can eat our... Look!

6058
03:52:13,880 --> 03:52:14,020
See!

6059
03:52:14,080 --> 03:52:14,440
Look at that!

6060
03:52:14,540 --> 03:52:15,540
Nothing to worry about!

6061
03:52:15,800 --> 03:52:16,940
We ate our eggs.

6062
03:52:17,760 --> 03:52:19,240
Nothing to worry about!

6063
03:52:20,640 --> 03:52:21,160
Guys!

6064
03:52:22,800 --> 03:52:23,840
So calm!

6065
03:52:25,960 --> 03:52:27,100
Where is that?

6066
03:52:28,680 --> 03:52:29,520
Where the fuck?

6067
03:52:29,620 --> 03:52:30,620
Oh, the beeping was here.

6068
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:32,040
Okay.

6069
03:52:32,120 --> 03:52:34,080
I almost ran into that.

6070
03:52:34,260 --> 03:52:34,440
Okay.

6071
03:52:34,540 --> 03:52:34,540
I almost ran into that.

6072
03:52:34,540 --> 03:52:34,880
Thank god.

6073
03:52:37,320 --> 03:52:39,260
Thank god I heard the beeps in time.

6074
03:52:39,600 --> 03:52:40,000
Thank god I heard the beeps in time.

6075
03:52:40,440 --> 03:52:40,960
Okay.

6076
03:52:40,960 --> 03:52:41,360
Barrel.

6077
03:52:42,640 --> 03:52:43,160
Nice.

6078
03:52:43,160 --> 03:52:43,420
Oh!

6079
03:52:43,440 --> 03:52:44,020
More money!

6080
03:52:44,860 --> 03:52:45,820
That's what I like.

6081
03:52:48,800 --> 03:52:49,420
Okay.

6082
03:52:49,540 --> 03:52:50,600
There's a treasure here.

6083
03:52:51,500 --> 03:52:53,360
There's like two more medallions.

6084
03:52:54,920 --> 03:52:56,180
Where could they be?

6085
03:52:58,020 --> 03:52:58,640
Woop!

6086
03:53:00,220 --> 03:53:02,240
Where could the medallions be?

6087
03:53:03,300 --> 03:53:05,780
I think I hate finding the medallions the most!

6088
03:53:05,820 --> 03:53:07,500
They're so fucking...

6089
03:53:07,500 --> 03:53:08,840
Oh my god.

6090
03:53:09,160 --> 03:53:10,580
They're so annoying.

6091
03:53:12,180 --> 03:53:12,800
Yeah!

6092
03:53:13,620 --> 03:53:14,240
Pipe!

6093
03:53:18,900 --> 03:53:19,520
Fuck.

6094
03:53:19,520 --> 03:53:19,540
Oh, no.

6095
03:53:19,560 --> 03:53:19,640
Oh my god.

6096
03:53:19,640 --> 03:53:20,180
Where do I go?

6097
03:53:22,480 --> 03:53:23,440
This way?

6098
03:53:24,020 --> 03:53:24,700
Loot!

6099
03:53:25,500 --> 03:53:26,760
Love me my loot!

6100
03:53:27,940 --> 03:53:28,620
Fish!

6101
03:53:30,160 --> 03:53:30,840
Oh.

6102
03:53:31,460 --> 03:53:32,140
What?

6103
03:53:33,280 --> 03:53:34,200
Can I sell this?

6104
03:53:34,880 --> 03:53:35,560
Oh!

6105
03:53:35,780 --> 03:53:36,840
I can eat it!

6106
03:53:37,620 --> 03:53:39,100
Oh, there it is!

6107
03:53:39,380 --> 03:53:40,060
Nice.

6108
03:53:41,240 --> 03:53:41,580
Okay.

6109
03:53:41,600 --> 03:53:42,460
One more.

6110
03:53:43,700 --> 03:53:45,840
We need one more medallion.

6111
03:53:46,180 --> 03:53:47,380
It's like over here?

6112
03:53:47,700 --> 03:53:48,960
Over here?

6113
03:53:52,080 --> 03:53:52,640
Oh!

6114
03:53:53,500 --> 03:53:54,520
Thank god!

6115
03:53:55,240 --> 03:53:55,820
Okay.

6116
03:53:55,880 --> 03:53:56,360
That was close.

6117
03:53:56,780 --> 03:53:58,420
That was so fucking close.

6118
03:53:58,680 --> 03:53:59,600
Where's the last one?

6119
03:54:00,220 --> 03:54:02,660
It's like here somewhere?

6120
03:54:03,900 --> 03:54:04,800
Who said that?

6121
03:54:07,080 --> 03:54:07,660
What?

6122
03:54:10,860 --> 03:54:12,140
Where's the medallion?

6123
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:14,180
Where is it?

6124
03:54:15,420 --> 03:54:16,000
Like...

6125
03:54:16,000 --> 03:54:17,040
I'm like on it.

6126
03:54:20,470 --> 03:54:22,110
We already have three snakes.

6127
03:54:22,850 --> 03:54:23,430
We already have three snakes.

6128
03:54:24,630 --> 03:54:25,070
Where?

6129
03:54:27,090 --> 03:54:27,530
Medallion?

6130
03:54:28,950 --> 03:54:29,810
Oh, is it below?

6131
03:54:30,190 --> 03:54:30,790
Oh, okay.

6132
03:54:31,370 --> 03:54:33,530
Okay, I'm gonna get that barrel first and I'll go below.

6133
03:54:34,450 --> 03:54:35,290
Below me.

6134
03:54:36,790 --> 03:54:37,670
Not here.

6135
03:54:37,790 --> 03:54:38,950
So it's on the other side.

6136
03:54:39,250 --> 03:54:41,670
Alright, we're gonna grab this barrel and then we'll...

6137
03:54:41,670 --> 03:54:42,790
We'll head over.

6138
03:54:43,670 --> 03:54:44,110
Nice.

6139
03:54:44,510 --> 03:54:46,170
Wait, how do I get that?

6140
03:54:47,510 --> 03:54:48,150
It's important.

6141
03:54:49,570 --> 03:54:50,410
Can I make this?

6142
03:54:50,510 --> 03:54:51,150
I can make this.

6143
03:54:53,530 --> 03:54:54,090
Okay.

6144
03:54:54,450 --> 03:54:55,010
Okay.

6145
03:54:56,590 --> 03:54:57,730
Alright, Leon.

6146
03:54:57,970 --> 03:55:00,030
Alright, Leon.

6147
03:55:00,510 --> 03:55:01,070
Sorry.

6148
03:55:01,350 --> 03:55:03,070
Leon, even though...

6149
03:55:03,070 --> 03:55:05,410
Leon's thighs are thick as fuck...

6150
03:55:05,770 --> 03:55:07,110
They can't be jumping.

6151
03:55:08,530 --> 03:55:10,710
They're not for jumping, clearly.

6152
03:55:11,110 --> 03:55:11,330
They're not for jumping, clearly.

6153
03:55:11,330 --> 03:55:14,030
Those thighs were not meant to be doing any jumping.

6154
03:55:14,650 --> 03:55:15,230
Those thighs were not meant to be doing any jumping.

6155
03:55:15,290 --> 03:55:16,890
Where do I get the other side?

6156
03:55:17,030 --> 03:55:17,650
Oh, it's over here.

6157
03:55:19,070 --> 03:55:19,790
Oh, nice.

6158
03:55:19,890 --> 03:55:20,130
Okay.

6159
03:55:21,470 --> 03:55:21,990
Yay!

6160
03:55:24,050 --> 03:55:24,870
Oh, nice.

6161
03:55:24,930 --> 03:55:25,950
Another hexagon piece.

6162
03:55:28,870 --> 03:55:30,730
Here's something on the other side that dropped.

6163
03:55:34,150 --> 03:55:35,010
There's the snake.

6164
03:55:35,070 --> 03:55:35,510
You know what?

6165
03:55:35,770 --> 03:55:36,550
Extra money.

6166
03:55:39,910 --> 03:55:40,550
That's right.

6167
03:55:40,710 --> 03:55:41,270
You ain't...

6168
03:55:42,550 --> 03:55:44,130
You didn't pay your loans, crow.

6169
03:55:45,190 --> 03:55:46,330
That's fucking right.

6170
03:55:46,730 --> 03:55:47,250
Hahaha.

6171
03:55:47,250 --> 03:55:47,410
Hahaha.

6172
03:55:49,610 --> 03:55:51,710
Don't think I forgot about you.

6173
03:55:52,110 --> 03:55:52,730
Hahaha.

6174
03:55:53,650 --> 03:55:53,990
Hahaha.

6175
03:55:57,310 --> 03:55:58,410
Let me in!

6176
03:55:58,630 --> 03:55:59,550
Let me in!

6177
03:56:01,410 --> 03:56:03,810
Gotta make sure nobody else is here.

6178
03:56:05,290 --> 03:56:06,310
Yeah, that's right.

6179
03:56:06,610 --> 03:56:07,970
Don't think I forgot.

6180
03:56:09,430 --> 03:56:10,450
Oh, another egg.

6181
03:56:11,110 --> 03:56:12,630
Oh, there's the spiel.

6182
03:56:13,310 --> 03:56:15,570
That's what we needed.

6183
03:56:16,610 --> 03:56:17,230
Oh, there's the spiel.

6184
03:56:17,230 --> 03:56:18,330
Yeah.

6185
03:56:19,310 --> 03:56:21,150
There can only be one bird.

6186
03:56:21,770 --> 03:56:22,330
Hahaha.

6187
03:56:23,050 --> 03:56:25,430
There can only be one bird in this game.

6188
03:56:27,010 --> 03:56:28,210
That's fucking right.

6189
03:56:29,090 --> 03:56:30,510
You didn't pay your rent.

6190
03:56:31,110 --> 03:56:34,010
All birds have to pay rent to Doki Bird.

6191
03:56:34,350 --> 03:56:36,950
I trademarked bird.

6192
03:56:37,270 --> 03:56:37,850
I trademarked bird.

6193
03:56:41,090 --> 03:56:42,370
That's fucking right.

6194
03:56:42,450 --> 03:56:43,050
That's right.

6195
03:56:43,110 --> 03:56:43,790
I did it.

6196
03:56:43,790 --> 03:56:45,990
I trademarked bird.

6197
03:56:46,170 --> 03:56:48,850
You all have to pay for the trademark now.

6198
03:56:49,650 --> 03:56:50,390
Let's see.

6199
03:56:50,470 --> 03:56:50,950
Craft.

6200
03:56:51,150 --> 03:56:54,030
I think I always need shotgun ammo.

6201
03:56:54,130 --> 03:56:54,630
Not gonna lie.

6202
03:56:55,290 --> 03:56:57,250
I should have craft rifle ammo.

6203
03:56:57,730 --> 03:57:01,250
And then I'll craft other stuff later.

6204
03:57:02,190 --> 03:57:02,830
And then I'll craft other stuff later.

6205
03:57:06,470 --> 03:57:07,110
Oh!

6206
03:57:07,430 --> 03:57:08,070
Whoa!

6207
03:57:08,730 --> 03:57:10,450
I almost got baited.

6208
03:57:10,450 --> 03:57:11,090
Holy shit.

6209
03:57:11,830 --> 03:57:14,030
I almost got baited by the money.

6210
03:57:15,590 --> 03:57:16,770
The bird tax.

6211
03:57:18,210 --> 03:57:19,370
The bird tax.

6212
03:57:19,370 --> 03:57:20,430
That was so close.

6213
03:57:21,590 --> 03:57:22,070
Wait.

6214
03:57:22,250 --> 03:57:23,450
Oh, I can stay on high ground.

6215
03:57:23,550 --> 03:57:23,890
That's okay.

6216
03:57:26,890 --> 03:57:28,250
I can stay on high ground.

6217
03:57:29,890 --> 03:57:31,010
That's fucking right.

6218
03:57:31,910 --> 03:57:32,950
They can't get me.

6219
03:57:34,850 --> 03:57:35,610
Where's the others?

6220
03:57:37,610 --> 03:57:38,410
Where are they?

6221
03:57:38,570 --> 03:57:39,190
Oh shit!

6222
03:57:39,230 --> 03:57:40,270
She has a... Oh fuck!

6223
03:57:41,170 --> 03:57:41,570
What?

6224
03:57:44,230 --> 03:57:45,030
Oh fuck!

6225
03:57:45,110 --> 03:57:45,570
What the fuck?

6226
03:57:45,630 --> 03:57:46,390
Where did you come from?

6227
03:57:48,770 --> 03:57:49,570
Oh no.

6228
03:57:50,010 --> 03:57:50,590
Oh no.

6229
03:57:50,710 --> 03:57:50,770
Okay.

6230
03:57:50,870 --> 03:57:51,550
I don't have to stab.

6231
03:57:51,670 --> 03:57:51,870
Okay.

6232
03:57:52,190 --> 03:57:53,050
What the fuck?

6233
03:57:53,070 --> 03:57:54,470
Where did she come from?

6234
03:57:54,570 --> 03:57:56,510
How did she get there that fast?

6235
03:57:59,270 --> 03:58:00,110
You kill them all?

6236
03:58:00,910 --> 03:58:01,310
Nice.

6237
03:58:03,590 --> 03:58:03,990
Nice.

6238
03:58:06,190 --> 03:58:07,910
I'm not bird bite playing them.

6239
03:58:07,950 --> 03:58:10,470
Guess I have to pay for them since I can't.

6240
03:58:10,470 --> 03:58:12,730
Thank you for the super channeling.

6241
03:58:12,730 --> 03:58:13,110
Thank you.

6242
03:58:13,110 --> 03:58:13,710
Thank you.

6243
03:58:14,730 --> 03:58:15,210
Ella?

6244
03:58:15,410 --> 03:58:15,850
Wait.

6245
03:58:15,930 --> 03:58:16,730
What the fuck?

6246
03:58:16,750 --> 03:58:18,170
Where did you come from?

6247
03:58:21,110 --> 03:58:21,590
Whoops.

6248
03:58:24,550 --> 03:58:25,030
Nice.

6249
03:58:28,170 --> 03:58:28,650
Nice.

6250
03:58:28,650 --> 03:58:29,010
Nice.

6251
03:58:29,010 --> 03:58:29,710
I need to shank you.

6252
03:58:29,790 --> 03:58:31,110
Oh, got back my ammo too.

6253
03:58:32,230 --> 03:58:34,370
Don't you love it when you get back your ammo?

6254
03:58:34,710 --> 03:58:35,190
Nice.

6255
03:58:35,190 --> 03:58:36,090
And gunpowder.

6256
03:58:37,410 --> 03:58:38,310
That's everything.

6257
03:58:39,990 --> 03:58:40,430
Money.

6258
03:58:40,950 --> 03:58:41,850
Where's that money?

6259
03:58:42,870 --> 03:58:43,490
Where's that?

6260
03:58:46,490 --> 03:58:46,930
Nice.

6261
03:58:46,950 --> 03:58:48,970
Almost missed out on the money.

6262
03:58:52,330 --> 03:58:54,250
All these people late for the party.

6263
03:58:54,830 --> 03:58:56,590
We had a set schedule, sir.

6264
03:58:58,530 --> 03:58:59,630
Up we go.

6265
03:58:59,970 --> 03:59:02,590
Do I need to save before I fight the fish?

6266
03:59:03,790 --> 03:59:04,790
I swear to god.

6267
03:59:04,830 --> 03:59:06,870
If I die, I'll have to do this part all over again.

6268
03:59:07,090 --> 03:59:08,230
I swear to fuck.

6269
03:59:12,610 --> 03:59:14,490
I need to know right now, guys.

6270
03:59:15,210 --> 03:59:17,990
Do I need to save before I fight this fucking fish?

6271
03:59:18,830 --> 03:59:19,270
Yes?

6272
03:59:19,270 --> 03:59:20,350
Okay, I'm going back.

6273
03:59:20,630 --> 03:59:21,390
All right, fish.

6274
03:59:21,810 --> 03:59:22,750
Give me a sec.

6275
03:59:23,110 --> 03:59:24,590
I'm going back to the merchant.

6276
03:59:24,610 --> 03:59:25,250
I might as well.

6277
03:59:25,430 --> 03:59:26,910
I have so much stuff to sell anyway.

6278
03:59:29,350 --> 03:59:29,930
All right.

6279
03:59:30,850 --> 03:59:31,610
Intermission time.

6280
03:59:32,330 --> 03:59:33,430
Be right back, fish.

6281
03:59:35,790 --> 03:59:36,550
Intermission time.

6282
03:59:37,850 --> 03:59:38,290
I'm going to the merchant.

6283
03:59:38,310 --> 03:59:39,150
Okay.

6284
03:59:39,990 --> 03:59:40,510
Nice.

6285
03:59:41,550 --> 03:59:42,330
Got this.

6286
03:59:43,310 --> 03:59:45,210
Can I trade for anything better now?

6287
03:59:45,310 --> 03:59:45,790
Not yet.

6288
03:59:46,010 --> 03:59:46,270
Okay.

6289
03:59:46,490 --> 03:59:47,210
Let's see.

6290
03:59:48,050 --> 03:59:49,010
Antique pipe.

6291
03:59:49,190 --> 03:59:50,990
Okay, we can sell that now.

6292
03:59:51,070 --> 03:59:52,050
We can sell these two.

6293
03:59:52,510 --> 03:59:54,470
And then we can sell our vipers.

6294
03:59:54,630 --> 03:59:56,350
Ooh, we have so much money.

6295
03:59:58,870 --> 03:59:59,390
Yay!

6296
04:00:02,550 --> 04:00:03,070
Okay.

6297
04:00:04,670 --> 04:00:07,850
What should we do with our money right now?

6298
04:00:09,750 --> 04:00:14,450
The laser sight keeps your pistol at full charge all the time?

6299
04:00:14,590 --> 04:00:14,710
The laser sight keeps your pistol at full charge all the time?

6300
04:00:14,710 --> 04:00:15,850
Wait, that's so good!

6301
04:00:16,670 --> 04:00:18,010
I don't want... they don't have it.

6302
04:00:18,070 --> 04:00:18,390
Never mind.

6303
04:00:19,930 --> 04:00:21,070
That's so good!

6304
04:00:21,430 --> 04:00:22,490
But they don't have it.

6305
04:00:26,050 --> 04:00:27,910
Fine, I'll repair the knife.

6306
04:00:29,030 --> 04:00:30,290
Fine, I'll repair the knife.

6307
04:00:31,390 --> 04:00:31,850
Trade.

6308
04:00:32,530 --> 04:00:33,270
Oh, it's on the trade?

6309
04:00:33,650 --> 04:00:35,470
Oh, wait, do I have enough?

6310
04:00:36,270 --> 04:00:37,210
Is it worth it?

6311
04:00:38,310 --> 04:00:38,530
Trade.

6312
04:00:39,370 --> 04:00:40,470
Is it worth it, guys?

6313
04:00:41,270 --> 04:00:42,150
Or should I save?

6314
04:00:43,250 --> 04:00:44,570
Do I do it or save money?

6315
04:00:47,930 --> 04:00:48,330
Yeah?

6316
04:00:48,470 --> 04:00:49,270
Okay, we're getting it.

6317
04:00:50,050 --> 04:00:50,450
Alright.

6318
04:00:50,930 --> 04:00:51,770
What should we upgrade?

6319
04:00:52,470 --> 04:00:53,630
Should we upgrade the shotgun?

6320
04:00:54,070 --> 04:00:54,470
Guys?

6321
04:00:55,350 --> 04:00:56,450
Should we upgrade the power?

6322
04:01:00,030 --> 04:01:01,150
Is it worth it?

6323
04:01:04,710 --> 04:01:05,970
Is that worth it?

6324
04:01:05,970 --> 04:01:06,510
Nope.

6325
04:01:06,710 --> 04:01:07,810
Okay, that's one guy.

6326
04:01:08,010 --> 04:01:08,530
So I'm...

6327
04:01:08,530 --> 04:01:11,150
The one guy I'm not gonna listen to.

6328
04:01:15,910 --> 04:01:17,570
And I'll save the rest.

6329
04:01:17,750 --> 04:01:18,030
Alright.

6330
04:01:19,150 --> 04:01:19,910
Here we go.

6331
04:01:20,830 --> 04:01:21,550
He's like...

6332
04:01:21,550 --> 04:01:23,850
He's not gonna be the only one, guy!

6333
04:01:24,070 --> 04:01:25,490
I'm coming in too!

6334
04:01:30,090 --> 04:01:32,410
Let me make sure I reload everything.

6335
04:01:34,430 --> 04:01:35,850
Let me make sure I reload everything.

6336
04:01:37,530 --> 04:01:38,050
Alright.

6337
04:01:38,170 --> 04:01:38,490
Alright.

6338
04:01:38,610 --> 04:01:39,710
I should have enough.

6339
04:01:40,030 --> 04:01:40,890
Okay, let's see.

6340
04:01:42,010 --> 04:01:45,050
Uh... I'm just gonna eat this egg right now and be full HP.

6341
04:01:45,610 --> 04:01:46,690
There's no point.

6342
04:01:46,790 --> 04:01:47,930
Okay, and then...

6343
04:01:47,930 --> 04:01:48,970
Parts.

6344
04:01:49,190 --> 04:01:50,870
Put that on my pistol.

6345
04:01:51,450 --> 04:01:54,410
I'm gonna put my fucking kitchen knife in here.

6346
04:01:55,430 --> 04:01:55,950
Yeah!

6347
04:01:57,070 --> 04:02:05,750
Bum-ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum Bum-ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum Bum-ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum Alright.

6348
04:02:06,150 --> 04:02:06,770
Here we go.

6349
04:02:07,090 --> 04:02:07,950
Fish time!

6350
04:02:08,090 --> 04:02:08,610
Fish time!

6351
04:02:09,610 --> 04:02:11,330
Got my fucking rifle!

6352
04:02:13,430 --> 04:02:14,130
Oh wait.

6353
04:02:14,310 --> 04:02:15,210
Forgot the puzzle.

6354
04:02:16,050 --> 04:02:17,170
Forgot the puzzle!

6355
04:02:17,310 --> 04:02:17,750
Puzzle!

6356
04:02:20,890 --> 04:02:21,410
Alright.

6357
04:02:21,990 --> 04:02:23,570
I'm a keeper for food.

6358
04:02:23,870 --> 04:02:25,070
What if I need it?

6359
04:02:25,350 --> 04:02:26,630
Wait, can I do the puzzle now?

6360
04:02:27,990 --> 04:02:28,510
No?

6361
04:02:28,770 --> 04:02:30,070
Oh, I need one more then.

6362
04:02:30,450 --> 04:02:31,770
I'm not gonna shoot the fish!

6363
04:02:31,870 --> 04:02:32,670
I already shot the fish!

6364
04:02:34,730 --> 04:02:36,590
I'm not shooting the fish!

6365
04:02:36,950 --> 04:02:37,410
I'm not shooting the fish!

6366
04:02:37,790 --> 04:02:40,030
We already shot the fish!

6367
04:02:45,690 --> 04:02:46,670
Alright, here we go.

6368
04:02:48,210 --> 04:02:49,010
Here we go.

6369
04:02:49,170 --> 04:02:50,110
Back into the lake.

6370
04:02:50,150 --> 04:02:51,410
I forgot how this boss fight goes.

6371
04:02:52,490 --> 04:02:55,730
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die here.

6372
04:02:56,050 --> 04:02:56,990
I already forgot.

6373
04:03:01,490 --> 04:03:04,850
I remember I was so confused when we did this.

6374
04:03:09,100 --> 04:03:10,040
Yeah, it's equipped.

6375
04:03:10,160 --> 04:03:10,940
I equipped it instantly.

6376
04:03:12,280 --> 04:03:16,940
I just remember being so fucking confused I just remember being so fucking confused doing this boss fight.

6377
04:03:33,070 --> 04:03:34,250
Stab the water!

6378
04:03:34,550 --> 04:03:36,030
It's so easy, Doki!

6379
04:03:36,130 --> 04:03:38,090
Just fucking shake the water!

6380
04:03:39,670 --> 04:03:41,010
Shake the fish!

6381
04:03:41,330 --> 04:03:42,430
OH SHIT!

6382
04:03:42,430 --> 04:03:42,990
I'M SORRY!

6383
04:03:44,870 --> 04:03:46,490
I didn't mean it!

6384
04:03:49,830 --> 04:03:51,010
How do I play this?

6385
04:03:53,570 --> 04:03:54,730
Shake it!

6386
04:03:57,170 --> 04:03:58,090
Wait, what?

6387
04:03:59,030 --> 04:04:00,270
Stab the fish?

6388
04:04:02,510 --> 04:04:03,730
Stab the fish!

6389
04:04:03,970 --> 04:04:04,610
Oh my god!

6390
04:04:04,690 --> 04:04:05,750
It is shake the fish!

6391
04:04:05,930 --> 04:04:07,050
Shake the fish!

6392
04:04:07,390 --> 04:04:08,650
Shake the fish!

6393
04:04:09,210 --> 04:04:10,490
Shake the fish!

6394
04:04:15,690 --> 04:04:17,170
We're doing it!

6395
04:04:21,210 --> 04:04:22,810
We're shaking the fish!

6396
04:04:22,990 --> 04:04:23,450
We're shaking the fish!

6397
04:04:23,450 --> 04:04:23,470
We're shaking the fish!

6398
04:04:23,470 --> 04:04:24,170
I knew it!

6399
04:04:26,190 --> 04:04:28,530
I knew we were gonna shake the fish.

6400
04:04:28,990 --> 04:04:29,890
I knew we were gonna shake the fish.

6401
04:04:29,890 --> 04:04:30,530
I fucking knew it.

6402
04:04:30,710 --> 04:04:31,090
I fucking knew it.

6403
04:04:33,170 --> 04:04:33,730
Alright.

6404
04:04:34,690 --> 04:04:36,050
Where the fuck is he?

6405
04:04:40,020 --> 04:04:40,580
Nice.

6406
04:04:40,580 --> 04:04:42,300
Wait, let me get my thousand dollars.

6407
04:04:43,900 --> 04:04:45,440
This is important!

6408
04:04:47,340 --> 04:04:48,300
Wait, what?

6409
04:04:48,360 --> 04:04:49,880
Think you can swallow me whole, huh?

6410
04:04:54,390 --> 04:04:54,930
Oh!

6411
04:04:56,190 --> 04:04:56,730
Oh!

6412
04:04:56,990 --> 04:04:57,530
What?

6413
04:04:57,930 --> 04:04:59,650
Oh wait, that doesn't count.

6414
04:05:00,130 --> 04:05:01,330
Got my thousand!

6415
04:05:03,130 --> 04:05:04,170
Oh shit!

6416
04:05:04,210 --> 04:05:04,650
What?

6417
04:05:05,310 --> 04:05:06,890
That was a headshot!

6418
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:08,490
That's bullshit!

6419
04:05:08,890 --> 04:05:09,750
Oh wait, whoops.

6420
04:05:10,310 --> 04:05:11,470
That was bullshit.

6421
04:05:11,590 --> 04:05:13,730
That was 100% a headshot.

6422
04:05:13,930 --> 04:05:14,830
Right there.

6423
04:05:15,470 --> 04:05:16,950
That was fucking bullshit!

6424
04:05:19,250 --> 04:05:20,330
So check the bots!

6425
04:05:21,250 --> 04:05:22,470
Check the fucking bots!

6426
04:05:26,290 --> 04:05:29,530
Alright, where is he gonna go?

6427
04:05:32,910 --> 04:05:33,550
Alright, where is he gonna go?

6428
04:05:33,550 --> 04:05:33,770
Alright, come on.

6429
04:05:34,410 --> 04:05:34,850
Alright, come on.

6430
04:05:34,850 --> 04:05:35,070
Come on.

6431
04:05:35,630 --> 04:05:37,010
Come on, I know you wanna come over.

6432
04:05:37,190 --> 04:05:37,550
Come on.

6433
04:05:38,510 --> 04:05:39,130
I'm waiting.

6434
04:05:42,890 --> 04:05:43,530
Where'd you go?

6435
04:05:43,890 --> 04:05:44,290
Where'd you go?

6436
04:05:45,510 --> 04:05:45,950
What?

6437
04:05:49,910 --> 04:05:50,130
Oh!

6438
04:05:50,410 --> 04:05:51,190
Oh, I have

6439
04:05:54,760 --> 04:05:55,260
a plan!

6440
04:05:58,040 --> 04:05:59,800
Alright, we're so fucking dead.

6441
04:05:59,920 --> 04:06:00,900
I got confused.

6442
04:06:02,380 --> 04:06:03,020
Woo!

6443
04:06:03,660 --> 04:06:04,860
I got confused.

6444
04:06:04,900 --> 04:06:05,540
We're so fucked.

6445
04:06:05,820 --> 04:06:07,140
We're so fucked, guys.

6446
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:08,400
Guys.

6447
04:06:09,060 --> 04:06:10,440
I got confused.

6448
04:06:11,000 --> 04:06:17,540
I got a little bit confused.

6449
04:06:17,540 --> 04:06:17,780
Phew!

6450
04:06:20,700 --> 04:06:21,460
It's okay.

6451
04:06:21,940 --> 04:06:24,580
I wish I know what his HP is though.

6452
04:06:24,880 --> 04:06:28,560
I really wish I know how fucking low this fish is.

6453
04:06:28,800 --> 04:06:29,340
I really wish I know how fucking low this fish is.

6454
04:06:29,740 --> 04:06:33,260
I really wish I know how fucking low this fish is.

6455
04:06:33,260 --> 04:06:33,840
It's here!

6456
04:06:35,220 --> 04:06:36,520
Guys, GG's.

6457
04:06:38,000 --> 04:06:38,600
GG's!

6458
04:06:41,420 --> 04:06:42,180
GG's, guys.

6459
04:06:42,500 --> 04:06:42,840
GG's, guys.

6460
04:06:42,840 --> 04:06:44,440
We had a good run!

6461
04:06:44,760 --> 04:06:46,100
We had a good run!

6462
04:06:46,900 --> 04:06:47,360
No!

6463
04:06:47,360 --> 04:06:47,580
No!

6464
04:06:47,580 --> 04:06:48,000
Wait!

6465
04:06:48,220 --> 04:06:48,580
What?

6466
04:06:49,000 --> 04:06:49,820
Oh no.

6467
04:06:51,260 --> 04:06:52,240
Guys, it's okay.

6468
04:06:52,580 --> 04:06:54,320
We got 20k though!

6469
04:06:57,160 --> 04:06:59,080
It was a good run.

6470
04:07:01,180 --> 04:07:03,220
It was such a good run.

6471
04:07:07,860 --> 04:07:09,180
Oh my god.

6472
04:07:09,300 --> 04:07:10,960
This fucking fight.

6473
04:07:11,300 --> 04:07:11,900
Man.

6474
04:07:13,680 --> 04:07:14,860
Wait, we did it!

6475
04:07:14,860 --> 04:07:16,280
1 HP!

6476
04:07:17,940 --> 04:07:19,180
1 HP!

6477
04:07:20,380 --> 04:07:21,360
Oh, please.

6478
04:07:23,240 --> 04:07:24,320
No way.

6479
04:07:28,580 --> 04:07:29,340
First try.

6480
04:07:30,180 --> 04:07:31,640
We did it, guys.

6481
04:07:31,940 --> 04:07:33,520
We shanked the fish.

6482
04:07:36,820 --> 04:07:38,700
1 HP in our dream.

6483
04:07:40,380 --> 04:07:41,980
How does she do it?

6484
04:07:44,040 --> 04:07:46,300
How does she always kill the fish?

6485
04:07:46,320 --> 04:07:47,580
She kills the bosses with 1 HP.

6486
04:07:48,420 --> 04:07:49,400
Oh, jeez.

6487
04:07:49,500 --> 04:07:50,540
That's a lot of blood.

6488
04:07:57,360 --> 04:07:59,120
Actually, first try.

6489
04:07:59,420 --> 04:07:59,900
Yay!

6490
04:08:01,960 --> 04:08:02,560
Nice.

6491
04:08:02,800 --> 04:08:03,800
We did pretty good.

6492
04:08:03,840 --> 04:08:04,840
85% accuracy.

6493
04:08:05,020 --> 04:08:05,720
That's pretty good.

6494
04:08:06,280 --> 04:08:07,860
That's pretty good, guys.

6495
04:08:08,540 --> 04:08:09,620
Alright, save.

6496
04:08:13,100 --> 04:08:13,920
Here we go.

6497
04:08:17,640 --> 04:08:19,180
We're in London now, motherfucker.

6498
04:08:25,800 --> 04:08:27,560
Leon's body is the most sacred body?

6499
04:08:27,740 --> 04:08:29,320
That's why he's going to continue to bloodline.

6500
04:08:41,480 --> 04:08:42,140
Oh god.

6501
04:08:43,000 --> 04:08:43,880
The parasite.

6502
04:08:50,800 --> 04:08:51,680
I'm sadly...

6503
04:09:02,810 --> 04:09:05,510
Just teaching him about the birds and the bees...

6504
04:09:07,090 --> 04:09:08,190
Just teaching him about the birds and the bees...

6505
04:09:08,190 --> 04:09:09,430
It's okay, I have my rifle.

6506
04:09:12,390 --> 04:09:15,270
It's okay, I'll just shoot it with my rifle.

6507
04:09:18,970 --> 04:09:20,190
Still no Ashley.

6508
04:09:20,950 --> 04:09:23,150
Still no Ash- It's okay, you know what?

6509
04:09:23,270 --> 04:09:23,730
I'm happy.

6510
04:09:24,270 --> 04:09:26,430
I don't really want to see Ashley right now.

6511
04:09:39,090 --> 04:09:41,170
Just trying to see if I can see any barrels from here.

6512
04:09:45,590 --> 04:09:46,370
Alright, whoop!

6513
04:09:47,590 --> 04:09:48,390
Nice handgun.

6514
04:09:51,750 --> 04:09:53,810
Wait, where- What the fuck, where are we?

6515
04:09:56,030 --> 04:09:58,790
Find the key to the church- Oh, I'm like all the way here!

6516
04:10:00,950 --> 04:10:02,150
Hey, there's somebody's hat!

6517
04:10:03,170 --> 04:10:03,810
Nice hat!

6518
04:10:04,170 --> 04:10:05,150
Hey, that's like my hat!

6519
04:10:06,170 --> 04:10:07,650
Do I look at this guy's face again?

6520
04:10:09,550 --> 04:10:10,670
Is there anything in here?

6521
04:10:10,950 --> 04:10:11,810
Oh, resources!

6522
04:10:12,870 --> 04:10:14,890
Oh no, that's just the Holy Mary.

6523
04:10:15,570 --> 04:10:16,650
Is there a ladder?

6524
04:10:16,870 --> 04:10:17,550
No, no ladder.

6525
04:10:18,890 --> 04:10:19,930
Hello, everybody!

6526
04:10:21,430 --> 04:10:23,230
Oh, it's night time?

6527
04:10:25,570 --> 04:10:27,890
Oh, I do not like this.

6528
04:10:29,510 --> 04:10:31,970
Alright guys, we're gonna call it here!

6529
04:10:35,150 --> 04:10:38,170
Okay, I think this is a good time to call it.

6530
04:10:38,190 --> 04:10:40,310
After seeing it being night time.

6531
04:10:41,790 --> 04:10:42,270
Yeah!

6532
04:10:44,450 --> 04:10:45,790
I was like y'know what?

6533
04:10:45,890 --> 04:10:49,590
No, no this is a good time to call it there.

6534
04:10:49,770 --> 04:10:51,030
We did four hours.

6535
04:10:51,390 --> 04:10:55,970
We got a boss, but let's just, we'll do the other chapter another time...

6536
04:10:56,570 --> 04:10:57,690
There's like, night time.

6537
04:10:57,830 --> 04:11:00,710
Oh, it's like, oh, it's the horror part of the horror game.

6538
04:11:00,990 --> 04:11:02,630
I'm good, I'm good.

6539
04:11:06,370 --> 04:11:07,170
That's okay.

6540
04:11:07,450 --> 04:11:10,910
I think that's a good time to stop now.

6541
04:11:14,170 --> 04:11:16,710
Brother, thank you for the aca aca aca sopa!

6542
04:11:17,110 --> 04:11:17,470
Thank you!

6543
04:11:18,230 --> 04:11:21,190
Well guys, I hope you guys had a great time for part one!

6544
04:11:21,490 --> 04:11:25,130
Everybody, I had a great time playing today.

6545
04:11:26,190 --> 04:11:30,290
It's great to play Resident Evil 4 again, playing the remake for the first time.

6546
04:11:31,510 --> 04:11:34,150
Definitely enjoyed it a lot so far.

6547
04:11:34,370 --> 04:11:35,890
I really enjoyed the game so far.

6548
04:11:36,070 --> 04:11:42,370
The controls are less... you know, since it's a newer game, the controls are definitely less scuffed.

6549
04:11:45,890 --> 04:11:50,450
It's definitely easier to control compared to the OG Resident Evil 4.

6550
04:11:50,690 --> 04:11:53,350
So that's what I like the most.

6551
04:11:53,550 --> 04:11:53,870
But yeah!

6552
04:11:54,050 --> 04:11:55,070
I had a great time!

6553
04:11:55,510 --> 04:11:56,410
I hope you guys...

6554
04:11:58,210 --> 04:12:00,270
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

6555
04:12:00,290 --> 04:12:00,770
I hope you guys enjoyed it too.

6556
04:12:01,750 --> 04:12:02,110
Everybody...

6557
04:12:03,250 --> 04:12:07,950
I think I read a lot of super chats coming in so there wasn't really much to catch up on.

6558
04:12:08,090 --> 04:12:11,850
So I'm gonna call it here because we did do a very long stream today.

6559
04:12:12,710 --> 04:12:15,510
Also Mr. Mad messaged me and was like, Oh hey, are you free today?

6560
04:12:15,690 --> 04:12:16,470
I was like, I'm streaming.

6561
04:12:17,870 --> 04:12:21,550
Mr. Mad messaged me in the middle of my stream and was like, Hey, are you free right now?

6562
04:12:21,650 --> 04:12:22,930
I was like, no, I'm streaming.

6563
04:12:24,570 --> 04:12:26,610
And he was like, oh okay, after the stream we usually...

6564
04:12:26,610 --> 04:12:29,390
I wanted to tell you something about something.

6565
04:12:30,290 --> 04:12:30,750
And I was like, alright!

6566
04:12:31,110 --> 04:12:32,190
Alright, anyway guys.

6567
04:12:32,610 --> 04:12:33,370
I'm gonna call it here.

6568
04:12:33,410 --> 04:12:35,390
Tomorrow is a rest day for me.

6569
04:12:35,470 --> 04:12:36,630
I usually take Sundays off.

6570
04:12:36,830 --> 04:12:37,870
So like usually...

6571
04:12:37,870 --> 04:12:40,930
Unless there's like an event or a tournament or something on Sunday.

6572
04:12:41,150 --> 04:12:44,110
But majority of the time, Sunday is my off day.

6573
04:12:44,690 --> 04:12:48,290
So don't worry if you're like, Oh my god, what is your schedule with me for tomorrow?

6574
04:12:48,490 --> 04:12:50,130
Sunday usually is my rest day.

6575
04:12:50,390 --> 04:12:51,090
Anyway everybody!

6576
04:12:51,650 --> 04:12:53,530
I had a great time playing part 1.

6577
04:12:53,630 --> 04:12:55,490
Definitely gonna be doing part 2 of Resident Evil 4.

6578
04:12:55,770 --> 04:12:57,710
I might make a long session for part 2.

6579
04:12:57,710 --> 04:12:59,730
Because it is a 15 hour game.

6580
04:13:00,030 --> 04:13:01,330
So I might do a...

6581
04:13:01,870 --> 04:13:05,170
A longer session than usual for Resident Evil 4.

6582
04:13:05,170 --> 04:13:06,790
For Resident Evil 4 part 2.

6583
04:13:07,150 --> 04:13:10,150
So I might start at like 12.30 or something.

6584
04:13:10,190 --> 04:13:10,790
PM, PST.

6585
04:13:11,890 --> 04:13:13,190
When I do long sessions.

6586
04:13:13,510 --> 04:13:14,270
But anyway guys.

6587
04:13:14,410 --> 04:13:15,450
As always everybody.

6588
04:13:15,710 --> 04:13:16,430
Stay hydrated.

6589
04:13:16,750 --> 04:13:17,190
Poster check.

6590
04:13:17,250 --> 04:13:18,810
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6591
04:13:18,990 --> 04:13:20,050
And if you stay up for me.

6592
04:13:20,190 --> 04:13:20,850
Head to bed.

6593
04:13:20,990 --> 04:13:22,170
Cause you deserve it!

6594
04:13:22,350 --> 04:13:23,670
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6595
04:13:24,150 --> 04:13:24,870
Bye guys!

6596
04:13:25,570 --> 04:13:26,050
Bye!

6597
04:13:27,710 --> 04:13:28,510
Thanks for watching!
