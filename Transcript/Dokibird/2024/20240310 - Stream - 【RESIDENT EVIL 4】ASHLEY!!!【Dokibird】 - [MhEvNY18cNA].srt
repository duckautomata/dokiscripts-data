1
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,070
Hello, hello, Ashley.

2
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,410
Dude, what the fuck?

3
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,170
This is the first.

4
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,290
All right, guys.

5
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,930
That is the first thing I read today for my playthrough.

6
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,830
What do you mean?

7
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,170
I am a good babysitter.

8
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,090
For those who don't know, I've told this story before a long
time ago.

9
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:21,770
But I actually, I took a, I did an after school club where
we learned how to be babysitters.

10
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,750
I've never done it before.

11
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,910
Like, I never took this practice into, like, reality.

12
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:43,830
but like but I paid uh $10 for this after school activity
because after after the whole duration of this activity that

13
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:55,430
we did after school um we had to take a test and then get a
uh a babysitter certificate so I have a babysitter

14
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,610
certificate which proves that I am, I can be a good
babysitter.

15
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,570
I've never babysat before, afterwards.

16
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:15,750
Like, afterwards, I may have never babysat, but I do have a
certificate.

17
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,930
So, that makes me more qualified than anybody else here.

18
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,410
Do you have a babysitter certificate?

19
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,610
I don't think so.

20
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,110
I pay $10 for this.

21
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:39,010
takes it okay i have i i don't know where it is because i
took this after school activity in middle school so so like

22
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:45,490

is anymore um no thank you for the super chat thank you

the apex tournament because apparently Unlike me when I said

28
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:54,250

streamers were campaigning to To their communities to vote

29
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,330
for their clips.

30
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:08,830
So like the clip that one where people were like what the
fuck look guys no no no it's good that we didn't raid

31
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:17,490

people would say we rigged it okay now we're not the ones

32
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:25,230
that rigged it guys it's good because then other people
would have said we rigged it they would be like of course

33
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,850
the vtuber rigged the the clip awards but we didn't so we're

37
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,350
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

38
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,650
Thank you.

39
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,130
Thank you.

40
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,210
They have no tastes in clips.

41
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,510
Shake my head.

42
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,690
Mario Doki needs to straw her babysitting seals for Ashley
tonight.

43
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,530
Thank you for the super chat.

44
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:08,810
Thank you.

45
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,190
Thank you.

46
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,750
We have the moral high ground.

47
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,370
Because I said no, no rigging.

48
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,850
We lost though.

49
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,970
Because I forgot.

50
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,850
I forgot about it.

51
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,210
It's like student council all over again.

52
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:27,010
people will campaign it's a thousand dollars

53
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:43,190
I forgot about that I forgot like if it's a vote on if it's
a popular vote people would campaign for it I forgot just

54
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:54,830
like politics anyway all right here we go resident evil 4
I've always wanted to um well i always wanted to finish this

55
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:02,430
game but like obviously um i don't want to go back and play
all the way to the beginning because of the original game

56
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:12,650
because like that was like a lot because that would require
me to to deal with og ashley who has one of the worst

57
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:29,190
fucking um npc pathways ever so so um because of my hatred
of Ashley's NPC movements and escort missions I've decided

58
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:39,310
to play the remake because at least I don't have to go
through the original Ashley and instead I can go through

59
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:55,790
with remake Ashley who apparently has better passing now so
I decided it for the sake of my sanity uh and not redoing

60
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:05,490
the entire fucking 70 of the game um i decided to do the
remake because at least like it'll still be new to me and

61
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:15,270
the pathing would not be as bad like i don't know i just
feel like ashley 2.0 was the way to go all right here we go

62
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:23,330
okay adjust the pattern until the pat where is the pattern
holy shit why is it so bright automatically Okay.

63
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,650
Why is it like maxed out?

64
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,710
D-Dragon, thank you for the Super Chat, thank you.

65
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,290
If you hate Ashley and any Resident Evil 4, then it's a
little skill issue.

66
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,310
Thank you for the Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

67
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,650
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

68
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,490
I won't say I hate her.

69
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,110
I just don't want her to exist.

70
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,750
That's different.

71
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,690
All right.

72
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,850
Let's see.

73
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,010
Just until the pattern is just...

74
00:09:52,030 --> 00:10:07,110
barely visible okay then i guess this there you go uh here
you go uh adjust under until the image in the center is

75
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:15,670
barely visible if the image remains visible please check
your okay just until it is very oh my god if i make it so

76
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,110
bright then like it won't be scary anymore

77
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:34,110
I'm just saying if it's this bright then like it's not a
horror game it's just survival it's just action I can't be

78
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:42,290
scared because no monster's gonna show up when it's bright
like that's typical horror uh sassy thank you the super chat

79
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:49,990
thank you thank you we all agree of you nobody like Ashley
and OG Resident Evil 4 okay let's see I think this is fine

80
00:10:49,990 --> 00:11:00,790

following me said okay nice adjust the i think that's good

I have one.

86
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,250
I'm just gonna hide the screen just in case like it requires
like personal information.

87
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,630
I'll just write, I don't have one.

88
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,530
Your play data can be viewed on, why do I need my play date
data?

89
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,710
They will be sent to the RE net whenever you select quick
game from the pause.

90
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,690
But I don't, the game has an auto save feature.

91
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,290
Okay.

92
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,790
Oh, it doesn't matter.

93
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,790
All right, that's cool.

94
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,090
I love it when things don't matter.

95
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:19,930
All right.

96
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,970
So Capcom ID does not matter, guys.

97
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,830
That's what we learn.

98
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,410
All right, start game.

99
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,390
Ooh, loud.

100
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,290
A new extra game is available to download mercenaries.

101
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,850
Oh, but it's free.

102
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,210
No.

103
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,170
Do I need it?

104
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,430
I don't really care.

105
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,330
Wait, can I, like, buy skins for Leon?

106
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,570
Online store.

107
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,710
Yes.

108
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,530
Are you cosmetics?

109
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,430
All right, let's see.

110
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,550
What the fuck is this Bunda?

111
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,790
Oh my god, wait.

112
00:12:52,030 --> 00:13:07,510
is Leon and Ashley okay guys do we need to be immersed I
just need how much how much immersion do you guys want like

113
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:17,770
this is very important to how this game is gonna be how much
immersion do you guys want what do you mean by that I mean

114
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,730
I'm looking at this cosmetics right now this is question.

115
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,870
Do you want immersion or... Okay, you guys want...

116
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,910
Okay, I won't buy anything.

117
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,990
Hunjoys, thank you for the magenta soup, but thank you.

118
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:30,530
Thank you.

119
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,850
The Nyaya clip is number one in my mind.

120
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,490
Yeah, but it's not a winning clip.

121
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,570
Alright.

122
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,530
Alright, guys.

123
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,170
Fine.

124
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:39,970
Fine.

125
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,970
We won't buy any of the Leon costumes.

126
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,410
We won't... There's literally one where... Wait, is this one
where it's like Baldur's Gate-esque?

127
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,430
There is one where you can see his chest.

128
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,630
Guys, it's tempting.

129
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,830
Ha ha ha ha ha.

130
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,370
Guys, I don't know.

131
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,330
Check out.

132
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,970
Guys, there's a 25% off for shirtless Leon.

133
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,630
Come on.

134
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,390
Wait, is this like goth?

135
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,030
What the fuck?

136
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,670
There's a goth, Ashley?

137
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,770
Okay, guys, but there's, like, goth Ashley, though.

138
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,730
Actually, you know what?

139
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,530
You know what?

140
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,070
I'm getting the goth, Ashley.

141
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,030
I'm getting...

142
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,110
We're getting that.

143
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,870
Because no matter what, we don't really care about what
Ashley looks like.

144
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,050
So might as well enjoy the ride.

145
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,190
Enjoy the ride of Ashley being goth.

146
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,010
It makes sense why she's, like, in this village.

147
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,810
Like, she wanted to get away from the president, like her
dad.

148
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:03,270
Alright, I won't make Leon immersive, because this other
skin, he doesn't really look like Leon.

149
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,890
He's just, it's just bald, like, you know that vampire dude
that everybody likes in Baldur's Gate?

150
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,070
Like, he basically looks like that.

151
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,990
And, like, um, this might be a super hot take, but I really
don't care about that guy.

152
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,270
I don't really give a fuck about...

153
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,530
I don't even know his name.

154
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,570
So, like, I think it might be a super hot take.

155
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,690
Because, like, I swear everybody's obsessed over him.

156
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,590
I think it's the accent.

157
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,850
I honestly think it's not what he looks like.

158
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,870
It's literally, like, the accent.

159
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,610
It's always the accent.

160
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,570
Okay, I need to restart the game.

161
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,150
Alright, don't worry.

162
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,950
We're putting Goth Ashley in here.

163

216
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,090

Guys, there's a reason why.

218
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,430

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:16,670
consumption so like i've decided that like i do not like
Like trying to find ammo.

222
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,990
I really hate finding ammo.

223
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,010
I hate item management.

224
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,030
No, I've always told you guys.

225
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,050
I hate item management the most.

226
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,950
Out of difficulties.

227
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,450
What do you mean?

228
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,510
I hear the game perfectly fine.

229
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,610
They just chop the guy's head up.

230
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,570
Where is the sound?

231
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,290
September 30th, 1998.

232
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,970
Today, I'll never forget.

233
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,190
Okay.

234
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,070
Audio, though.

235
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,650
Ways it up.

236
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,390
That night, Raccoon City was wiped out thanks to the
bio-weapons created by umbrella.

237
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,810
Somehow I made it out, but too many others weren't so lucky.

238
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,870
Oh, no.

239
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,290
I was asked later to join a top-secret government program.

240
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,030
Is that better now, guys?

241
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,090
I thought that I had a choice.

242
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,090
That's right.

243
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,670
You never have a choice.

244
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,330
Damn,

245
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,870
why aren't you buff?

246
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,310
You look like Captain America, pre-Captain America.

247
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,030
This time, it can be different.

248
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,220
It has to.

249
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,400
Hey, it looks like a happy time, Leon.

250
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,620
Don't worry.

251
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,680
That's gonna happen in a Resident Evil game.

252
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,640
That's not my Ashley.

253
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,120
But who the fuck is this girl?

254
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,540
Who's she?

255
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,600
Not my Ashley.

256
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,000
The chief gave the orders himself.

257
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,560
Help him, he said.

258
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,120
I'm sure your boys didn't come all the way out here to roast
marshmallows.

259
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,280
Oh, wait.

260
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,160
Sound guy's here.

261
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,200
Sound guy, what do you think?

262
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,900
Maybe he did.

263
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,600
You have a strange sense of humor.

264
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

265
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,500
Just between us.

266
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,820
A lot of people have gone missing around here.

267
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,880
And it's been that way for a while now.

268
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,340
Should be just another day in the office, right?

269
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,380
Hmm.

270
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,320
I mean, last week there was a search for some missing
hikers.

271
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm sure you're...

272
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,860
Missing hikers?

273
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,180
Look, the hikers are not important.

274
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,700
Are they the president's daughter?

275
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,940
I don't think so.

276
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,420
So...

277
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,540
Ashley is like worth 20 missing hikers.

278
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,770
Nature calls, huh?

279
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,670
I'll be right back.

280
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,070
The president's missing hiker.

281
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,650
The hiking guide.

282
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,230
Okay, the president's hiking guide is worth like half an
Ashley.

283
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,070
The president needs to hike.

284
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,510
I'll look I'll boost it up a little

285
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,430
Bro Are you watching him pee?

286
00:22:52,830 --> 00:23:00,990
That's fucked up Oh Oh bro Did you pee on a corpse?

287
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,230
Bro

288
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:18,350
We are too No not me I looked away I respect a man Van's
privacy if he needs to pee.

289
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,010
He sure is taking his time.

290
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,670
Did he fall in?

291
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,340
Better go and take a look.

292
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,950
Yes, you Leon.

293
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,670
You should go look instead of me.

294
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,110
Yes, the guy that doesn't know this place.

295
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,730
You go on first.

296
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,640
I know, he's in the forest.

297
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,640
Fall into what exactly?

298
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,740
Oh wait, I can move now.

299
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,200

Shadow, you know what, we're fine.

Let's just hope our PC can handle this.

442
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,480

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,000

00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,740

Space bar.

462
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,460
Space bar is knife when they get too close.

463
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,080
When they get too close.

464
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,000
Space bar is knife.

465
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,780
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

466
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,540
Okay, there you go.

467
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,680
I just need to get my reflexes going on here.

468
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,980
Okay.

469
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,040
Alright.

470
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,180
Okay.

471
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,780
All right, there's a guy right there.

472
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,940
Maybe he's going to walk back.

473
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,460
Sir, are you going to walk back?

474
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,620
Sir?

475
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,080
Can you walk back so I have a longer...

476
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,780
So I don't have to turn around?

477
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,580
Oh, no.

478
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,400
Fuck, okay.

479
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,600
Sir, please.

480
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,660
Please walk back.

481
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,250
Do I go up?

482
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,550
Yes, I go up.

483
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,650
I don't know.

484
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,870
Maybe there's stuff up here.

485
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,450
I know this is not considered getting out, but maybe there's
stuff here.

486
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,260
What the fuck?

487
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,140
What's this?

488
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,120
Also, how's the volume so far?

489
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,300
Yeah, escape by going up.

490
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,480
Okay, so it makes sense.

491
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,440
This is Condor 1.

492
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,320
Hunnigan here.

493
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,020
What's your sit-rep?

494
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,440
The president's daughter, Baby Eagle.

495
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,620
It's likely she's in this village.

496
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,460
Our intel was correct then.

497
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,260
Well done.

498
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,900
Need a location on a nearby lake.

499
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,960
She may have been taken there.

500
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:50,700
Copy that.

501
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,020
I'll see what I can find.

502
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,600
Where is the president's daughter?

503
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,520
Please!

504
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,500

So far.

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,720
Oh, thank God.

511
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,200

We guys didn't know.

520
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:39,180
Early on in game testers, people wouldn't do anything with
the barrels until you painted it yellow.

521
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,440
And the people realized, Wow.

522
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,400
Yellow means I can break it.

523
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,160
When I can customize my case?

524
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,960
Oh, I only have one case.

Well, I hear some angry Spanish to my right.

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,080
Should I go left?

539
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,620
No, dog!

540
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,940
That's a waste of good food.

541
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,460
I don't think I want to go to the right right now.

542
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,440
I'm scared.

543
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,380

Ice skating style.

You understand that reference?

553
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,660
I don't even know if I can allow to say that.

554
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,100
No, I'm not thinking of the 20 gifted ships.

Oh, what the fuck?

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,000
No!

560
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:32,350
Okay, I was like right in front of it for so long, too.

561
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,310
a bear trap?

562
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,490
Ah!

563
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,590
Okay.

564
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,670
Okay.

565
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,510
I hate this.

566
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:48,650
All right.

567
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:49,330
I need a heal.

568
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,030
Okay.

569
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,090
Flash grenades.

570
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,150
All right.

571
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,450
Okay.

572
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,550
Let's see.

573
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,910
Oh, fuck.

574
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,230
Okay, you can set your weapon to a shortcut.

575
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,170
Good thing we don't have anything else right now.

576
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,610
Uh, her gunfight, it cannot be used by itself.

577
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:08,990
Well!

578
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,510
Do I heal?

579
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,430
What's my HP?

580
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,310
How fucked am I?

581
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,150
Okay, guys.

582
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,270
What is my HP right now?

583
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,430
I can't tell.

584
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,250
Oh, there it is.

585
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:22,910
I'm half HP.

586
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,050
It's okay, Leon.

587
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,630
If you're half HP, you can survive.

588
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,550
American healthcare is still very expensive.

589
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,530
We gotta give you medicine when you're just about to die.

590
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:37,890
All right.

591
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,340
Yeah.

592
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,620
Knock, knock.

593
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,800
Knock, knock.

594
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,640
Don't worry.

595
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,800
What the fuck is that?

596
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:55,940
A head?

597
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,020
Oh, that is a head.

598
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,660
Don't worry, the spray bottles can heal a broken leg.

599
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,920
Oh, remember when I, like, was so fucking stupid and killed
everybody in this town?

600
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,340
I wasn't supposed to.

601
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,800
to kill everybody.

602
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:18,700
Alright.

603
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,180
And wasted all that ammo?

604
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:23,520
Alright.

605
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,360
We can do that again.

606
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,480
It would.

607
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,320
It wouldn't hurt to do that again, right?

608
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,380
Hello.

609
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,640
Okay, there is the police officer.

610
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,480
Oh shit.

611
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,900
That sucks, bro.

612
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,300
That fucking sucks.

613
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,860
Wait, can I put him out of his misery?

614
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,700
Don't worry.

615
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,640
Don't worry.

616
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,820
I'll put you...

617
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,480
Oh, he's dead.

618
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,060
Sorry, I was a bit too late.

619
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,400
Um...

620
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,880
Sorry.

621
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,040
I couldn't...

622
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,680
Sorry, I washed a little bit too long.

623
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,780
I could have shot you first before all of that.

624
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,240
Alright.

625
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,300
There was an attempt.

626
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:10,780
Yes.

627
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,120
I don't know.

628
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,400
Maybe I should just kill them all.

629
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,580
You know what, guys?

630
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,320
I think I can kill all of them.

631
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,580
No, I have 10 bullets.

632
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,080
Never mind.

633
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,640
I just realized how much ammo I have.

634
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,560
Um, shit.

635
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay.

636
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,360
Can I just run back?

637
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,480
Okay.

638
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,380
Alright, here we go.

639
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,920
Alright, okay.

640
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,540
Sneak around first.

641
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,820
Guys, do you think they will see me if I just walk like
this?

642
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,380
Okay.

643
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,540
Nah.

644
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,540
Oh wait, no they won't.

645
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,100
Oh my gosh, you're right.

646
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,440
Wait, what's this?

647
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,820
Oh, that requires Ashley.

648
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,900
Wait, there's grass here.

649
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,620
We'll get my grass real fast.

650
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:01,960
This.

651
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,480
Oh.

652
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,740
They won't know.

653
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:10,970
Wait.

654
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,690
There she is.

655
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,850
Hello there, granny.

656
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,350
I'm here to take you to a better home.

657
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,150
You'll be okay.

658
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,030
Don't worry.

659
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,930
You're just going to go to a farm down state.

660
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,330
She's okay.

661
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,070
It was a tranquilizer.

662
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:33,870
She's okay.

663
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,590
It was a tranquilizer, guys.

664
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,870
What do I do here?

665
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,730
Where the fuck are people here?

666
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:46,730
Tranquilizer.

667
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,270
Where the fuck do I go from here?

668
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,690
Okay, give me a sec.

669
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,510
I need to figure this out.

670
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,530
Oh, I can combine.

671
00:46:59,370 --> 00:46:59,890
Craft.

672
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,470
Mix herb.

673
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,290
What does this do?

674
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,470
Restore three times as much health.

675
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,090
Oh, okay.

676
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,650
Now where do I go?

677
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,070
Okay.

678
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,670

It's okay.

690
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,880
Apparently I don't have a stamina meter.

691
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:12,900
It's okay!

692
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,660

701
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:58,920
Go!

702
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,240
Go!

703
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,500
Nothing has changed for me!

704
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,180
Okay, alright, let's go get some heals real fast.

705
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,280
It's just like old times!

706
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,520
It's just like old times!

707
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:20,960
Okay.

708
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,650
Oh, please don't tell me he's over here.

709
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,590
Oh my god, hey guys!

710
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,630
Oh fuck, bye guys!

711
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,570
Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine!

712
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,490
I'm reloading, it's fine!

713
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,430
It's just like old times!

714
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,010
Never forget!

715
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,110
Woo!

716
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,010
But I couldn't make it at you in time!

717
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:54,910
Okay, okay.

718
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:55,430
Woo!

719
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,210
What the fuck are you doing here?

720
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:58,710
Don't worry.

721
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,850
I can run.

722
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,650
I cannot run around, but I can run down here.

723
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,770
Don't worry, kick!

724
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,210
Oh, please leave me alone!

725
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,070
Oh!

726
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:11,810
Kick!

727
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:14,610
Woo!

728
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,190
Shit!

729
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:15,930
Okay.

730
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,030
Guys, okay, it's fine.

731
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,210
Three bullets in a dream.

732
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,510
Three bullets in a dream.

733
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,630
It's okay.

734
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:26,830
I have a friend.

735
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,850
All right, nothing else changed.

736
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,110
Nothing else changed.

737
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,890
If you close your eyes.

738
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,430
If you close your eyes.

739
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,890
Woo, thank you.

740
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,670
Just keep running.

741
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,210
Oh, shit.

742
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:47,610
Okay.

743
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,150
Okay, just keep running!

744
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,370
They'll kill their friends!

745
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,750
Oh my god, Granny please!

746
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,150
Woo!

747
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:58,790
Seraphity!

748
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,350
I ran out of ammo!

749
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,650
Unlike last time, I don't remember where all the ammo is!

750
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,950
Oh, my knife is broken too!

751
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,230
Okay, it's fine.

752
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,890
It's fine.

753
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,610
I know there's a- I'll get it when everybody's dead!

754
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:14,990
Guys!

755
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,870
I'll grab the shotgun when people are dead.

756
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,150
But at the moment, we don't have that.

757
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,810
Shit, it's okay, she missed.

758
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,310
It's just run.

759
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,370
Guys, I don't have the mental fortitude to grab the shotgun
right now.

760
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,750
I don't know where it is.

761
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,290
It's totally fine.

762
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,490
There's so many houses.

763
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,670
Which is the right house?

764
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,230
Oh, thank God.

765
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:43,910
Luck.

766
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:56,750

00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:27,860
Okay.

789
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,360
Where the fuck is the shotgun?

00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,620
I'm so confused.

791
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,140
I'm already lost.

792
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,700
What is that?

793
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,380
What is this?

794
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, Gap in the wall.

Yeah, it's all part of the plan.

796
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,130
Guys, it's all part of the plan.

797
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,570
I would have wasted it.

798
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,770
I would have wasted my shotgun ammo on something inferior.

799
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,010
Okay.

800
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,390
That nice handgun ammo.

801
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,130
We needed that.

802
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:08,630

From all the people that I killed.

812
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:22,570

00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,510
Chainsaw guy would have... Yeah, but no, but...

818
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,070
I was never gonna kill him.

819
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,490
There was no way.

820
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,510
Is it... Okay.

821
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,310
I don't know if you guys think I will actually remember the
leg.

822
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:47,370
I like how you guys think I remember this layout.

823
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,250
It's been two years

824
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,810

825
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,410
Okay, all right nice.

00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,770
What the fuck is he doing?

831
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,990
How... Where am I?

832
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,290
How dare he?

833
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:35,930
Oh my god.

834
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,730
The church's not gonna like this.

835
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,370
Found a man not praying.

836
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,650
Ooh, nice first aid spray.

837
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,370

Oh, there's the shotgun.

00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,070
Nice.

843
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,230

00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,410
Nice shotgun ammo.

850
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:39,210
Okay.

851
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:40,970
Can I jump out?

852
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,410
Can I jump out?

853
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,350
Oh, now you don't want to jump out the window.

854
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:46,470
Oh, okay.

855
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,490
Oh, is there items here?

856
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,570
There might be anything here?

857
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,050
Any items?

858
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,510
Any loot?

859
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:57,770
Am I done looting?

860
00:57:58,770 --> 00:57:59,550
I can't tell.

861
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:00,950
I'm already lost.

862
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,570
Not that would.

863
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,950
Why can't he pick and choose what window?

864
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,370
Does his life or death?

865
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,490
It shouldn't matter.

866
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,110
I got here?

867
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:11,710
Yeah, I did.

868
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,210
I loot everything?

869
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,090
Can't tell I'm so fucking lost.

870
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:30,310
I can't tell everything looks the same to me Okay, this is

00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,960
hard mode.

875
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,720
That would have been my last bullet.

876
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,320
Wait, what's this?

877
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,900
Oh, it's a locked drawer.

878
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,340
Knowing you guys, that would 100% been my last bullet.

879
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,000
If I was on hardcore mode.

880
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,720
I missed the ammo right here.

881
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,700

00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,420
Nice.

884
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,820
Thank fucking God.

885
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,620
Alright, let's see.

886
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,940
The ladder here.

887
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,220
Wait, what's the ladder for?

888
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,880
Oh my god, that's a ladder!

889
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,420
I didn't even realize that was a ladder.

890
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,460
I thought it was just interior.

891
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,500
Erb.

892
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:48,920
I'll need this.

893
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,300
I don't know.

894
00:59:52,720 --> 01:00:01,360
have a knife i broke it what do you mean you have a knife
dead poor i broke my knife

895
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:14,620
go back to the chicken and pull the bullet out because i
don't know if you guys know how guns work but uh i'm pretty

896
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:24,900
sure that's not how guns work what's in here oh ruby that's
right you're I'm the heirloom is mine now.

897
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,320
There's also a house here.

898
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:29,800
Nice.

899
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,780
More ammo.

900
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,890
Toki, you don't understand.

901
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:42,650
If you throw it really, really hard, maybe it'll pierce that
guy's skin.

902
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:45,630
Open.

903
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,550
I swear.

904
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,550
I need to be careful of bear traps now.

905
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,090
Knowing me, I might step into all of it.

906
01:00:59,130 --> 01:00:59,750
Wait, what?

907
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:00,410
That house?

908
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,190
I mean, there it is.

909
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:04,650
Here?

910
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:05,610
That far?

911
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,530
I already missed OG.

912
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,770
I already missed OG Resonant before.

913
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,410
It was definitely a lot less scarier.

914
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:24,010
It was campier, which meant I wasn't as scared.

915
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,810
When can I customize my case?

916
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:32,410
If I quaffed, Cool greens.

917
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,170
It's twice as much.

918
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,210
Then...

919
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,010
Might as well make more shotgun ammo.

920
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,010
Yeah, shotgun shells.

921
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,070
Time to play Tetris.

922
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,290
Nope, nope, don't discard it.

923
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,590
I honestly would not be surprised if I accidentally discard
this.

924
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,070
Okay, let me save again.

925
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:58,970
Friend, thank you for the magenta.

926
01:01:59,090 --> 01:01:59,510

Give me a sec.

937
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:43,580
Okay, there we go.

938
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,120
Give me a sec.

939
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,280
I'm charging up my gun.

940
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,500
There we go.

941
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:48,920
Oh, fuck.

942
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,900
Um, nice.

943
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:54,980
Cow's just chilling?

944
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,040
No, that cow's dead.

945
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,080
Wait, there.

946
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:01,600
Nice.

947
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:01,940
Okay.

948
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,320
Wait, do you have eggs?

949
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,360
What the fuck?

950
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,580
What am I gonna do with an egg?

951
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:10,580
Can be used.

952
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,560
Oh my god!

953
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,540
You wanted me to kill the chickens?

954
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,340
They give you unlimited heals!

955
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,880
They have eggs!

956
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,840
Brown chicken egg?

957
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,640
Is that better?

958
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,360
Oh my god, the brown chicken eggs are better!

959
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:27,620
Ow.

960
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,880
Did that chicken fucking hit me?

961
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,000
Okay, maybe I'll kill this chicken.

962
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,940
Oh, it's a male.

963
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,160
I can kill this chicken.

964
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:34,840
It's a rooster.

965
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,800
He wasn't going to be providing any eggs.

966
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,380
It's okay, guys.

967
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,440
It was a male rooster.

968
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,840
Let's see.

969
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,740
I need to make sure.

970
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,000
Okay, far, I'm here.

971
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,980
Freddie, thank you for that 50.

972
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:02,920
Get the chance.

973
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,320
Thank you.

974
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,160
Thank you.

975
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,080
I really appreciate it.

976
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,080
Thank you so much.

977
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,300
Wait, the pig... Okay, to be fair, pigs are carnivores,
though.

978
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,600
They, like, uh...

979
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,500
They eat anything.

980
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,620
Like, that's what they say.

981
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:23,680
People say, like, if you just, like, throw a body at a pig,
like, it's, like, one of the best ways to, like, hide the

982
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,780
bodies, because they'll just eat the body.

983
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,500
That's why, like, pigs can even eat their own kind.

984
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,480
If they, like, if the pigs got cut or something, the pigs
will smell the blood and will be like, ooh!

985
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,740
yeah pigs eat everything will I ever use the grenades

986
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:58,700
see well to be fair any animal eats their own babies it's
not just pigs that's a dead boy they give me one of five

987
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:07,820
give this shit thank you thank you it's not like a pig thing
every every animal eats their own babies because it's like

988
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:14,120
survival the fittest so if they think a baby is not worth
like taking care of they'll just just eat it because they're

989
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:22,200
like it's not worth it okay I need a key for that because
they're like I'm not gonna take care of this baby that's too

990
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:36,780
many babies so then they'll just eat it to like what the
fuck I heard somebody who said that hello hello where are

991
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,040
you are you trying to open a door

992
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,860
Is that her?

993
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,800
I hear you.

994
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,700
She's inside.

995
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,760
Hello?

996
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,840
Oh, ma'am.

997
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:58,680
There you are.

998
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,200
Where did you come from?

999
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,220
Can you get a little bit closer?

1000
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,040
Thank you.

1001
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,120
Thank you.

1002
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,020
That's a lot easier.

1003
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:07,740
Get a little bit closer?

1004
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,740
There we go.

1005
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,120
Can you turn around?

1006
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,160
All right, here you go.

1007
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,640
Where did she come from?

1008
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,840
Wait, where did she come from?

1009
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,280
There's no entrances here.

1010
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:23,640
Hello?

1011
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,380
Where did you come from?

1012
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,420
All right, time to open the door.

1013
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:40,640
Boop.

1014
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:41,760
No good.

1015
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:42,240
Oh.

1016
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,040
How the fuck did she get there?

1017
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:46,860
Medallion?

1018
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,100
Where's the medallion?

1019
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,760
I already looked through everything.

1020
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,480
Where did she come from?

1021
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:55,700
Where did she go?

1022
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,200
The chickens watch the chickens?

1023
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:00,880
What do you mean?

1024
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,960
They seem like...

1025
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,600
They seem like good chickens.

1026
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,440
Blue?

1027
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,180
Oh, you mean this thing?

1028
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,340
This thing?

1029
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,220
Do I shoot this?

1030
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,840
I forgot if I shoot this.

1031
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,640
Oh, I do!

1032
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,360
Okay.

1033
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,080
I remember now.

1034
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,980
Oh, there's another one!

1035
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,780
Right here!

1036
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,140
What a waste of perfectly good bullets, though.

1037
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,360
There you go, two.

1038
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,640
Wait, what happens if I find all five?

1039
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,500
This is new.

1040
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,180
I don't know, or maybe it's not.

1041
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,620
I never was an achievement hunter.

1042
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,500
Maybe it wasn't new.

1043
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,960
I just don't ever realize.

1044
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:48,150
It's worth it.

1045
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,270
If only I have a knife.

1046
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:50,810
I know!

1047
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:54,390
If only the chainsaw guy didn't fucking fuck me up.

1048
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,240
Oh, there's one.

1049
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:02,840
Where's the last two?

1050
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,740
Are all of them are in this village?

1051
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,960
Wait, they're on the map too?

1052
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:08,620
They are?

1053
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,760
Liar!

1054
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,360
What the fuck do you mean?

1055
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,800
The blue paper?

1056
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,040
Wait, is the blue paper considered?

1057
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,220
You can take on tasks by collecting the blue request notes.

1058
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,080
View the request you've taken.

1059
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,520
The love of God with some.

1060
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,720
Please get rid of blue medallions.

1061
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,020
Those religious lunatics left hanging around.

1062
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:38,960
Rewards.

1063
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,180
Spinell 3.

1064
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Wait, what the fuck is...

1065
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,180
What the fuck is a Spinell?

1066
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,380
Oh, there it is!

1067
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,480
Oh, I should have taken the blue paper first.

1068
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,460
Wait, how do I get that?

1069
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,420
I can't even get there.

1070
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,860
Huh?

1071
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,360
Okay, that other one I can get to easily.

1072
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,280
That one's here.

1073
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,880
Wow, chicken!

1074
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,060
Okay, now I know why people said, watch out for the
chickens.

1075
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,400
Some dally in here?

1076
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:12,620
Where?

1077
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,500
I don't see any blues.

1078
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,420
Where the fuck is that blue?

1079
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,020
What?

1080
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:22,420
What?

1081
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,400
Oh, gamers don't look up.

1082
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,160
Oh, my God.

1083
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:27,880
Fucking it.

1084
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:28,780
Of course.

1085
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,140
Always.

1086
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,740
It's always up.

1087
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,180
How do I get there, though?

1088
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,560
I think I need a key.

1089
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,200
Blues clues.

1090
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,940
Fucking wacky-ass blues clues shit.

1091
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,740
Like, how do I...

1092
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,400
I can't open this door.

1093
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,560
From the window?

1094
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,880
Can't get up.

1095
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,030
Can't get up there.

1096
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,670
Windmill?

1097
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:05,510
There's a windmill here?

1098
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,810
Oh, there is.

1099
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:10,970
Hello?

1100
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,970
Oh, that's a bomb.

1101
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:17,710
Okay.

1102
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,850
Can I just...

1103
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,330
Okay, I'm just gonna walk under it.

1104
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:28,630
Wait, can I disable it?

1105
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:29,790
Oh, I can.

1106
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:30,230
Nice.

1107
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:32,250
Okay, thank God.

1108
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,170
I almost thought that was gonna fuck me over.

1109
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,210
Hello?

1110
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,250
Anybody here?

1111
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:43,150
Grab this yellow herb.

1112
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:44,950
Hello?

1113
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:45,950
Anybody up top?

1114
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,350
I feel like there's somebody up top.

1115
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:48,770
There's always somebody up top.

1116
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,250
I'm coming up, guys!

1117
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,130
I'm gonna announce my...

1118
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:56,010
I'm gonna announce my appearance!

1119
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,020
Oh, what's this?

1120
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:01,500
A puzzle?

1121
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,120
Gotta fix everything myself.

1122
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,080
God, what happened to the repair people here?

1123
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,060
My God.

1124
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,120
If I was an inspector...

1125
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,620
If I was an inspector, I would close all of this down.

1126
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,200
There you go.

1127
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:20,560
Bye.

1128
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,020
I did it.

1129
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,320
Where's my spindle?

1130
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,020
A red herb handgun.

1131
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:27,460
Nice.

1132
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,300
Can I go through here?

1133
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,360
Free loot!

1134
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,040
Free loot!

1135
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,820
Wait a minute.

1136
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,920
Wait, who the fuck is that?

1137
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,560
Who the fuck is that?

1138
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,040
Who's that?

1139
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,520
Who's he?

1140
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,100
Who's he?

1141
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,100
No!

1142
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:16,840
Off the ladder!

1143
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:22,770
Are you dead?

1144
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,020
Okay, I'll just shoot you in the head now.

1145
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,160
Oh, it's you!

1146
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,860
I'm sorry, I'm trespassing again!

1147
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,160
Oh shit, please don't climb up the ladder, please.

1148
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,540
Please, I'm reloading.

1149
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:44,940
Okay, thank God.

1150
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,660
Here we go.

1151
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:49,980
We're good.

1152
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,500
It's fine.

1153
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,800
Are you guys dead?

1154
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,400
Oh, I don't have a knife.

1155
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,640
I'm just going to shoot you in the legs then.

1156
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,220
Alright, heal.

1157
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,280
I have to shoot you in the legs because I don't have a...

1158
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,040
I don't have a knife.

1159
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,600
Are you dead?

1160
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,500
Are you dead?

1161
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,720
He's dead.

1162
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,100
Oh, thank God for ladders.

1163
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,140
Thank God!

1164
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,100
Saved by the ladder!

1165
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:31,580
Nice.

1166
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:32,820
We did it.

1167
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,480
Oh, they got a kitchen knife!

1168
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,400
That would have been so helpful earlier.

1169
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,360
Oh, nice Ruby, too.

1170
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,220
Alright, we did it.

1171
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,440
We got the...

1172
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,340
Saved by ladders.

1173
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,450
I love it.

1174
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,700
You want me because the ladder buffed.

1175
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,320
I wish I could have taken that guy's fucking hammer, though.

1176
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,260
Hammer seemed pretty fucking neat.

1177
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,860
Alright, what the...

1178
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:01,880
Okay, can I not be used?

1179
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,300
Can I combine the hands other...

1180
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,460
You know what, I'm just gonna...

1181
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,280
I'm gonna come craft.

1182
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,540
I'll mix the red and the yellow.

1183
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,280
What does it do?

1184
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,060
I'm gonna increase my maximum...

1185
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:15,580
Oh, wait!

1186
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,620
That's good!

1187
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,620
Should I just eat it now?

1188
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,720
Or the throwing axe?

1189
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,020
Yeah.

1190
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,040
Red, yellow, green.

1191
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,800
I might as well just eat it now.

1192
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,380
I don't need the heals at the moment.

1193
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,820
Yeah, but I don't need the full heal.

1194
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,500
I feel like that's a waste.

1195
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,840
I might as well just heal this.

1196
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,360
Get this.

1197
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:43,330
Wait when you...

1198
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:43,890
Fine.

1199
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:44,690
Fine.

1200
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:47,390
I'll wait until I...

1201
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:48,330
Fine.

1202
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,050
I'll combine it with the green.

1203
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:51,330
Fine.

1204
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:52,290
Okay.

1205
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:53,290
Tetris.

1206
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:54,390
Nice.

1207
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:58,230
God for the fucking high ground shit, though.

1208
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,830
Did I get the thing automatically?

1209
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:02,710
Where's my...

1210
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,230
Whatever the fuck that was.

1211
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:05,050
There.

1212
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:05,970
Can I claim it?

1213
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,850
I destroyed it all.

1214
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,610
Does it automatically go to me?

1215
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,610
I'm confused.

1216
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,050
Confused, jokie, right now.

1217
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,650
Oh, at the merchant!

1218
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,170
Okay.

1219
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,010
I have to visit him.

1220
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:22,410
Okay.

1221
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:26,410
Is the merchant the only same person in this village?

1222
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,940
Okay.

1223
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,520
Why doesn't Leon take the weapons?

1224
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,220
Is he stupid?

1225
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,540
Thank you, it's a super chat thing.

1226
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:39,440
Thank you.

1227
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,320
A knife made for cooking its edge.

1228
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,860
All right, well, this is apparently my knife now.

1229
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,840
Well, can I fix this?

1230
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,480
I guess, like, I have to send it to the merchant to fix it.

1231
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,800
What is this?

1232
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,680
For selling only.

1233
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,540
2,000.

1234
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,100
What the fuck?

1235
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,780
The ruby is more expensive.

1236
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,620
Wait, actually...

1237
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:01,940
Wait, there's...

1238
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,420
There's, like, a place I haven't gone here.

1239
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:06,860
Alright.

1240
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,620
Yeah, my fucking kitchen knife.

1241
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,120
Be scared.

1242
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,680
I have a kitchen knife now.

1243
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:16,700
Woo.

1244
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:19,940
Woo.

1245
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:23,940
Nice money.

1246
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:27,720
Open?

1247
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,700
Is that the...

1248
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,020
What?

1249
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,260
What is this?

1250
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,220
Buying treasures.

1251
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,560
You can view the treasures.

1252
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,640
Some treasures can be sold out of by fitting them.

1253
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,400
What the fuck is this?

1254
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:44,710
Okay.

1255
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,770
I just put...

1256
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:49,870
Can I make this more expensive?

1257
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,810
If I put two rubies, do I make this more expensive?

1258
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:00,370
Ooh.

1259
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:05,190
Now ruby number two.

1260
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:08,230
Ruby number two.

1261
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,410
Oh, it plus 3,000.

1262
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,730
Wait, but like, it's already...

1263
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:14,990
Wait.

1264
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,390
But if I sell it, it's already 3,000.

1265
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,410
Like, what?

1266
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:22,910
Okay, two gems.

1267
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,330
Oh, one times two!

1268
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:25,250
Oh!

1269
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,470
I feel like I might as well...

1270
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,730
It gives you a bonus.

1271
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:35,290
Well, I can only combine two right now, so I might as well
just combine the double.

1272
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:36,930
Oh!

1273
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,830
quick maths.

1274
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:41,150
Oh, barrows.

1275
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,510
I want all this money.

1276
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:46,190
Come on.

1277
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,130
Yes.

1278
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:50,090
Okay.

1279
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:51,790
Wait, can I kick this too?

1280
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:52,830
Ugh.

1281
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:53,810
Ugh.

1282
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,170
No lock can contain these thighs.

1283
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,990
Neil, they give us a super chat.

1284
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:03,270
Thank you.

1285
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:03,690
Thank you.

1286
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:06,770
I'm not sure Merchant even is a person considering his
magical.

1287
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:08,190
That's just his twin brother.

1288
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,850
Or triplets or like, I don't know, he just comes from a very
big family.

1289
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,690
You don't understand.

1290
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,410
It's like Nurse Joy's.

1291
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,770
The Nurse Joy's and Officer Jenny's.

1292
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:19,890
They're all just like one big giant family.

1293
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,830
They're like the merchant family.

1294
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:24,850
Right.

1295
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,130
I'm gonna save my game.

1296
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,510
I don't trust myself.

1297
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,250
Get out of the way, pigs.

1298
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,630
I'm gonna save my game.

1299
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,350
I'm gonna save my game and lose the bathroom real quick.

1300
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,250
Wait, where's this over here?

1301
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,630
Where it all started.

1302
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:47,290
I'll be right back, guys.

1303
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:48,790
I saved the game.

1304
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:05,740
Alright, I'm back.

1305
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,380
I'm back, guys.

1306
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,600
It's okay.

1307
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:10,280
We saved our game.

1308
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,860
Nothing bad's gonna happen to us now.

1309
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:14,940
That's how it goes.

1310
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,200
Alright, up, I'll go.

1311
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,180
There we go.

1312
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,840
Where the fuck am I?

1313
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,820
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot where I was.

1314
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,960
And then Shady, thank you for the super chat.

1315
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:31,700
Thank you, thank you.

1316
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,220
Irene, thank you for the super chat.

1317
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,180
Thank you, thank you.

1318
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,400
Thank my first super.

1319
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,380
Irene.

1320
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,200
Oh, no, not here.

1321
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,320
Bro, not the chainsaw, man.

1322
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,380
Do I have shotgun M?

1323
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,380
Okay, three.

1324
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,360
Let me...

1325
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,360
Let me reload.

1326
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,060
real quick.

1327
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,460
All right.

1328
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,320
Here we go.

1329
01:20:59,120 --> 01:20:59,860
All right.

1330
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,240
I remember this place.

1331
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,400
Seeshavu.

1332
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:07,720
What's this?

1333
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:08,840
Can I push this?

1334
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,780
Wait, do I push this now or later?

1335
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,980
Oh, maybe this isn't.

1336
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:14,800
Is this it?

1337
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,060
Is this the place?

1338
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,080
Okay.

1339
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,500
Oh, you're right.

1340
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,740
I have the grenades too.

1341
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,400
Don't worry.

1342
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,000
I'm very prepared this time.

1343
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:25,660
Wait, what?

1344
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,620
What's over here?

1345
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,620
Maybe there's something here.

1346
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,640
Jesus Christ, Leon.

1347
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,980
These fucking thighs.

1348
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:40,570
I'm worried.

1349
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,570
I'm always worried straying off the path now.

1350
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:50,430
I feel like anything's gonna get me.

1351
01:21:53,410 --> 01:22:09,030

Ashley is over there.

1355
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,100
Maybe it won't matter.

1356
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:38,820
Alright.

1357
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:39,860
Hello?

1358
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,780
Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.

1359
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,160
I couldn't fucking open the door.

1360
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,220
What the fuck, guys?

1361
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,140
It doesn't matter.

1362
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,200
I couldn't even open the door.

1363
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:51,820
Alright, there.

1364
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,480

1365
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,040

01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,280
Nice money.

01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,340
The power thighs.

01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,000
Save me yet again.

1373
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,680
I knew you had it in you, Leon.

1374
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,740
Those thighs will never...

1375
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,620
Thick thighs save lives.

1376
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,800
Well, still locked.

1377
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,920
What the Fuck, where do I go then?

1378
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:05,840
Where do I go?

1379
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,940
I go back on the back?

1380
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,340
Maybe do I drop down from here?

1381
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:19,920
No?

1382
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,390
Was it the right way?

1383
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:28,590
Oh, they didn't block the path?

1384
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,250
Oh my god, I thought they blocked it!

1385
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:35,210
I just thought it was blocked!

1386
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,430
Okay, let me go back then.

1387
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,690
Hell no, fucking rocks fell down.

1388
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,650
I didn't know Leon could climb.

1389
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,550
I mean, he couldn't fucking climb before.

1390
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,530
Oh, it was just logs.

1391
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:53,630
Oh, shit.

1392
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:56,410
Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1393
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:57,210
That's not cool.

1394

Guys, I can shoot through this, right?

1395
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:01,850
Oh, I can.

1396
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,030

1429
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,740
I didn't think of the super chat.

1430
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:18,040
Thank you.

1431
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:18,640
Thank you.

1432
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:22,600
Hello?

1433
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:24,740
Hello, guys.

1434
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:25,560
Oh, there's Granny.

1435
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,120
Who are they trying to...

1436
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:33,640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1437
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:34,740
Wait.

1438
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,100
Wait, where is he?

1439
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,980
Oh my gosh, where are they?

1440
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,020
I hear the bomb!

1441
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:45,680
Oh, okay.

1442
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,440
Okay, he blew himself up.

1443
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,320
It's like, I hear it.

1444
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:52,900
Hello?

1445
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:55,380
I know Granny is over here.

1446
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,000
Granny?

1447
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,400
Oh.

1448
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:01,280
Granny?

1449
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,120
Oh.

1450
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,820
Oh, there it is.

1451
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,480
Whoop.

1452
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:12,880
Hello.

1453
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:16,140
What?

1454
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,120
That's a hit!

1455
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,260
There we go.

1456
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:20,580
Oh no.

1457
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,100
That's five.

1458
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,700
Oh, melee!

1459
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:25,360
Nice!

1460
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:26,000
Thick thighs!

1461
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,280
Save lives.

1462
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:29,940
Okay.

1463
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:35,390
Oh shit.

1464
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:36,190
Thick thighs!

1465
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:37,010
Oh!

1466
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,370
No!

1467
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:40,810
No!

1468
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:48,890
Okay, I'm just gonna deal with this gap first.

1469
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,490
Oh, shit!

1470
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:51,010
Okay.

1471
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:54,430
Give me a sec, gotta reload.

1472
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:57,630
Give me a sec.

1473
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,280
Oh, give me a sec.

1474
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,180
Oh, my god.

1475
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,700
Okay, that's good.

1476
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:13,960
That is good.

1477
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,520
Oh, there are more.

1478
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:17,980
Oh, shit!

1479
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:18,880
Oh!

1480
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,340
Don't hurt me.

1481
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,640
I'm in my suitcase.

1482
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,880
Do not hurt me.

1483
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,620
Oh, God.

1484
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,900
Okay, thank you.

1485
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:40,820
It's fine.

1486
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,880
Everything is fine.

1487
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:43,980
Wait.

1488
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:44,600
What?

1489
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,860
Where did she throw that?

1490
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,160
Where is she?

1491
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,380
Time out, time, time out!

1492
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,100
Huh?

1493
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,300
Ma'am?

1494
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,480
Ma'am!

1495
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,560
Where are you, ma'am?

1496
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,200
Where is she?

1497
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,580
Where's the invisible granny?

1498
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,140
Ma'am!

1499
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,100
I don't like this.

1500
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,820
I don't know where the invisible granny is.

1501
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:21,720
Is she up there?

1502
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,400
Grandma!

1503
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:25,080
Please!

1504
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,920
Come down, I won't hurt you!

1505
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,060
I'm just gonna take you to a farm downstate!

1506
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,200
I swear!

1507
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,860
Granny, please come down!

1508
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,740
Your family's worried about you!

1509
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,880
This is a tranquilizer gun!

1510
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:41,960
There we go.

1511
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:44,120
Bye.

1512
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,180
I hope she's not going to turn.

1513
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:45,960
Is she going to morb?

1514
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,080
No, she's fine.

1515
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,980
I just need her head to poke up for like one second.

1516
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:52,440
There you go.

1517
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,340
Oh, no.

1518
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,720
She's fucking turning.

1519
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,860
Oh, oh, shit.

1520
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,320
Jesus Christ.

1521
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:05,300
Please.

1522
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:06,700
Granny.

1523
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,200
It's alright.

1524
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,960
We're just going to wait a little bit.

1525
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:11,760
There we go.

1526
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,460
Okay, is she going to...

1527
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:13,820
No!

1528
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,680
Fuck!

1529
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:18,380
Fuck!

1530
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,900
I hate these bear traps so much.

1531
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:24,940
God damn it.

1532
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:27,720
These stupid fucking bear traps.

1533
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:30,560
How do I...

1534
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,380
Okay, how do I disable this?

1535
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,380

1536
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,900
I acknowledge your existence.

1537
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,340
How do I disable this?

1538
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,380
I acknowledge it's...

1539
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:45,920

Alright, that will be the only collectible I get in this

01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:09,060
Alright.

01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:15,400
I swear to god, if there's another fucking bear trap.

1555
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:21,270
I swear to fucking god.

1556
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:21,810
Okay.

1557
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,150
Just making sure I didn't miss anything.

1558
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:29,950
Alright, we didn't go this way then.

1559
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,470
Did we miss anything?

1560
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:32,290
No, we did.

1561
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:33,970
Alright.

1562
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,150
Reloading.

1563
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:36,530
Reloading.

1564
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,030
Wait, there's more?

1565
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:40,930
Oh, there is more.

1566
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:45,710
Sir, please.

1567
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:46,730
Get away.

1568
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,330
Oh, no.

1569
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:48,910
I have to...

1570
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,850
Oh, no, he's...

1571
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:50,750
Okay, he's not...

1572
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:51,690
He didn't turn.

1573
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:52,950
Oh, thank God.

1574
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:56,650
I thought I had to, like, fucking knife him with my kitchen
knife.

1575
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,950
I didn't necessarily...

1576
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:00,210
Oh, it's...

1577
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:00,890
Hey, guys.

1578
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:02,530
Remember this?

1579
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:11,210
Wait, before I shoot the lake, is there a safe point
anywhere?

1580
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:14,010
Is there a safe point?

1581
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:18,410
Guys!

1582
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:22,930
Please tell me I don't have to restart my entire...

1583
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:23,770
again!

1584
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:30,170
Oh, this is the wrong, oh thank God, this is the wrong part
of the lake.

1585
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,390
Okay, we're just gonna admire the scenery.

1586
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,730
Alright, that's, thank God, okay.

1587
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:37,630
Okay, that's good.

1588
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,830
That's good.

1589
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:40,710
It's the wrong part of the lakes.

1590
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,670
I hear people inside.

1591
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:46,890
Can I go over here?

1592
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:47,970
No, I can't.

1593
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:49,970
People inside, though.

1594
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:50,770
I'm ready.

1595
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:51,750
I reloaded my gun.

1596
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,610
I'm ready to shoot whoever is in there.

1597
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:55,830
Self-defense.

1598
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:58,370
I swear to God if there's a bear trap.

1599
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:01,150
Oh, I don't like this.

1600
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:01,650
Oh.

1601
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:05,530
Which way do I go?

1602
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:07,630
Hello?

1603
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:09,970
Oh.

1604
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:10,790
Oh.

1605
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:12,730
Something like that.

1606
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:13,530
Oh.

1607
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:16,450
Oh.

1608
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:18,390
Somebody's inside there.

1609
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,190
That's very angie.

1610
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:22,470
Hello?

1611
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:25,850
Hello?

1612
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:32,050
Yeah, I know, but like, I want to know, like, if I could go
inside.

1613
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,010
Oh, there it is.

1614
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:33,390
Okay.

1615
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:34,870
Okay.

1616
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:36,270
Give me a sec.

1617
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,150
Oh, my God.

1618
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:39,830
Please, Leon.

1619
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:42,970
Leon,

1620
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:46,620
please.

1621
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,320
Leon, please.

1622
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,400
Please, Lee.

1623
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,680
I don't understand.

1624
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,260
I knifed him!

1625
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,040
I don't understand.

1626
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:11,300
I don't understand the mechanism.

1627
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,400
I fucking hate hunting.

1628
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,520
Alright, nice.

1629
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,780
At least I got ammo.

1630
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,280
It's fine.

1631
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,220
I got ammo.

1632
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,440
This was all I wanted.

1633
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,640
I don't need a crouch, okay?

1634
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:27,000
That's good to know.

1635
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:27,400
Oh.

1636
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,020
Alright.

1637
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,160
Where do I go?

1638
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,220
Again.

1639
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,480
Door with insignia.

1640
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,520
I don't have that.

1641
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,380
How do I get to there?

1642
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,280
All those years of training.

1643
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:42,660
The police academy didn't train me for this.

1644
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,440
The house?

1645
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,120
Did I try to go back into the house?

1646
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:48,620
Where did I get in the house?

1647
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,680
Oh, there's a door.

1648
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:50,540
This is the place.

1649
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,480
Sorry.

1650
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,460
That one thing I didn't see.

1651
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,120
Let me.

1652
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,440
I have a warrant, but please don't check it.

1653
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,000
Hello?

1654
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:08,700
Hello?

1655
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,300
I don't like this.

1656
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:16,760
I don't like this.

1657
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,620
I feel like...

1658
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:22,540
I feel like there's definitely somebody up top.

1659
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:24,980
God damn it, everything needs keys.

1660
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:25,440
What?

1661
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:26,880
Why do you need keys for?

1662
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:27,720

1663
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:28,260

That doesn't count.

1670
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,140
I'm a government worker.

01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:19,850

Oh, I don't know.

1673
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:27,310
I feel like there might be somebody over here.

1674
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:31,230
Aim by with knife equipped, then use knife to stab.

1675
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:34,410
Okay, you guys see it as if it's so easy.

1676
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:36,890

1678
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:43,590

01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,050
You're not, Ashley.

1709
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,430
Oh, you're the other guy.

1710
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:49,730
You're the guy people wish Leon was.

1711
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:50,350
You want to talk.

1712
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:51,930
How observant, Señor.

1713
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:54,870
Now, say, you got to smoke?

1714
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:56,790
And all those things will kill you.

1715
01:40:57,330 --> 01:40:59,470

1728
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:30,890
Chapter end.

1729
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:31,950
Nice.

1730
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,230
Okay, what's my results?

1731
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:36,730
Oh god.

1732
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:38,810
I performed a stealth kill.

1733
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:40,010
Oh, I did all of that.

1734
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,430
Appearance at everything changes.

1735
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:44,150
Ooh, I did everything.

1736
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:48,550
Okay.

1737
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:50,730
Shift.

1738
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,190
Save game.

1739
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:56,950
Alright.

1740
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:57,910
Nice.

1741
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:03,430
It's okay.

1742
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:05,470
We saved someone better than Ashley.

1743
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:10,590
You will receive our most sacred body.

1744
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:12,550
What the fuck are you?

1745
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:18,390
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say he looked like

1746
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:24,730
Queen Elizabeth the second's husband.

1747
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:27,010
May he rest in peace?

1748
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:27,470
Stop it.

1749
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:33,490
Leon.

1750
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,540
I'm doing Sarah.

1751
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,080
Guess you, me.

1752
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,900
I like how everyone was like Adam Sandler not expecting me.

1753
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,520
Stop.

1754
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:50,540
He was like, Adam Sandler?

1755
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,100
And then I'm like, him.

1756
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,100
Bet you've been in spots like this before.

1757
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,860
No, no, that's good.

1758
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:00,580
The jacket's gone.

1759
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:01,980
Now that he can see my gains.

1760
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,140
One more guess.

1761
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:04,980
Maybe.

1762
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,840
Wait, his name is actually Adam Sandler?

1763
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,860
Whoa, that's awfully close, man.

1764
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,980
We're bros, right?

1765
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:28,400
chatter about moving a seniorita moving here where who knows

01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:35,880

Oh, shit!

1771
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,340
That's how fast male friendships go.

1772
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:03,540

01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,200

1777
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,060
True, bro.

1778
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:35,020

1779
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:41,160
Bro, I don't fucking know, but his IGN is like, uh, Major
Hawk.

1780
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:44,460
I heard it from this guy I met.

1781
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:46,660
Said his name is Luis Serra.

1782
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,240
Bro, so true.

1783
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,420
There's something fishy about him.

1784
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,840
I need you to run a background check.

1785
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:53,460
We'll call Condor 1.

1786
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:54,720
I'll see what I can find.

1787
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:55,800
No, my stuff!

1788
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,040
I hoarded so many items!

1789
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:58,640
Right.

1790
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:01,220
I'm probably due for confession anyway.

1791
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:02,660
Condor 1.

1792
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:03,120

01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:56,060

01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,680

01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,400
Oh, I thought that was my fucking gun.

01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:09,640

Do you get the scope free with the rifle?

2014
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,440
Is the rifle that good?

2015
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,160

2016
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:53,540

Okay, I see.

2082
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:12,860

Thank you, thank you.

2086
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:20,580
All sorts of feats the purpose of a Tetris inventory system.

2087
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:21,880
Think of the principles.

2088
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:27,220
Good thing I couldn't figure it out because I didn't realize
it was hold alt.

2089
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,540
That's your streamer.

2090
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,880
I didn't figure out you were supposed to hold alt key.

2091
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:39,920
So I had to do it the real way.

2092
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:43,700
You know, you traded this to Nels here, Steve, reward for
valuable goods.

2093
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:44,960
Oh, that's cool.

2094
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:47,860
There we go.

02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:52,580
Alright, what's this?

2096
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,200
Exagon-shaped slot.

2097
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:55,260
Treasure.

2098
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:56,380
Which way do I go?

2099
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:57,100
Okay.

2100
02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:01,940
Oh my god, it's all... The objective is all over there!

2101
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,200
The eagle.

2102
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:08,000
When will I ever need to use...

2103
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,700
I guess I'll use my rifle for bosses and the little guys.

2104
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:12,380

You're closer.

2111
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:48,860
I don't want to waste my legs.

2112
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:49,960
Oh, shit.

2113
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:51,480

I don't have to waste my knife on you.

2121
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:02,420
That's good.

2122
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,460
Thank you, Granny.

2123
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:05,680
Are you learning bear traps?

2124
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,540
No bear traps.

2125
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:07,640
Ooh.

2126
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:09,380
I don't like this.

2127
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:12,380
This doesn't seem very stable.

2128
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,180
Oh.

2129
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:16,140
Oh, what's that?

2130
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:17,640
Who's that?

2131
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:19,520
Who's that?

2132
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:21,380
Okay, I'm gonna climb.

2133
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:26,380
Hey, guys.

2134
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:30,580

02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,440
Oh, look at all these grannies.

2136
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:38,020

2139
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:42,860
They don't know where I am.

2140
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:43,460
Right?

2141
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:44,420
Right?

2142
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,300
Okay, that's fucked up that I missed.

2145
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:49,080

02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:51,780
Oh, goodbye.

2147
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:54,060
Look at them.

2148
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,140
Goodbye, Granny.

2149
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:56,720
Don't worry.

2150
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,300
There's, like, inflatable balloons down there.

2151
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,220
It's, like, up.

2152
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:05,200
Can you walk down the stairs for me?

2153
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,000
Oh, my God.

2154
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:08,160
Not that slow, though.

2155
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:09,340
It's okay.

2156
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,680
There you go.

2157
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:12,820
Easy.

2158
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,340
Wait, are they not gonna walk up to me?

2159
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:18,280
Why would I use rifles?

2160
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,040
Rifles are so expensive ammo!

2161
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:25,180
If I can shoot them with a handgun like this, like, I don't
need the rifle.

2162
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,160
Okay, not like that, though.

2163
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:32,180
Oh, now I miss!

2164
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:43,500
I hit every single shot earlier, but now that I get a little
cocky, I start missing.

2165
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:50,200
I see, I see, oh, fuck you.

2166
02:04:52,740 --> 02:05:00,140
Okay, where is, I need a fucking, let me equip, register
this as a shortcut real fast.

2167
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:02,120
All right, I've had enough.

2168
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:04,940
I had enough.

2169
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:07,220
All right, dude, fuck this guy, though.

2170
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:10,060
There we go.

2171
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:30,160
all right okay i don't need to use the rifle on her though

2172
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:41,380
wasting my fucking ammo guys i can look see for some reason
that guy didn't work but first oh my god that was like the

2173
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:43,180
only person I missed shots on.

2174
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:45,180
Everybody else I've hit.

2175
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:54,080
Guys, pistol ammo isn't wasting ammo.

2176
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,500
They're so fucking...

2177
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,080
It's so easy to find pistol ammo.

2178
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:02,500
Why is the wind so big now?

2179
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:04,060
It's because I killed everybody?

2180
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,280
Are they mad?

2181
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:09,820
Why is the wind mad at me?

2182
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:13,700
Why is the wind mad at me?

2183
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:17,100
What did I do?

2184
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:19,140
Alright.

2185
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:22,800
Why is there boss music?

2186
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:24,200
Guys, what did I do?

2187
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:25,800
I don't want to drop down.

2188
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:29,280
The wind god is angry at you.

2189
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,580
There's nobody up top, though.

2190
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:33,800
Oh, okay, the wind stopped.

2191
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,080
I don't want to go down.

2192
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:36,860
I'm scared.

2193
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:39,600
What the fuck are you?

2194
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,640
Bro, he just ran at me.

2195
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:51,660
Okay, there.

2196
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:53,280
Oh, shit.

2197
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:54,720
There you go.

2198
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:56,740
Nice.

2199
02:06:58,220 --> 02:06:59,540
I don't like this.

2200
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:01,060
I don't like this.

2201
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:02,760
Oh, what the fuck?

2202
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:05,900
Oh, shit.

2203
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,300
I didn't realize there were more.

2204
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,370
Oh, what the fuck?

2205
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:12,690
There are so many!

2206
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:16,850
What?

2207
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:21,170
Okay, no wonder the wind gods were mad.

2208
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:21,770
Whoa!

2209
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:25,070
Okay, okay.

2210
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,970
It's okay.

2211
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:26,630
That's fine.

2212
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:28,550
That's a good casualty.

2213
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:30,550
Oh, God.

2214
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:31,250
This is fine.

2215
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:33,050
This is fine.

2216
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,030
This is so fine.

2217
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:36,590
Oh, did you see that though?

2218
02:07:38,930 --> 02:07:39,490
Okay.

2219
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:43,310
Oh, shit.

2220
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:44,750
Oh, shit.

2221
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:46,470
Oh, no!

2222
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:48,470
No, don't grab me!

2223
02:07:48,710 --> 02:07:49,710
Please, let me go!

2224
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:50,770
Okay.

2225
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:53,290
Alright, here we go.

2226
02:07:54,850 --> 02:07:55,610
There we go.

2227
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,330
Okay, it's fine.

2228
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,790
We're fine.

2229
02:07:57,990 --> 02:07:58,250
We're fine.

We're fine.

We're fine.

2237
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:09,440
It's fine.

2276
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,540
Wait, there's no ladder here?

2277
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:17,700
Guys, I didn't realize there was no ladder.

2278
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,600
Guys, I didn't realize there was no ladder.

2279
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,700
You think this is a choice with me running in circles?

2280
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:29,200
I'm literally panicking!

2281
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,980

Okay, up top we go, up top we go, up top we go.

2301
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:59,200
And then we just shoot them off the ladder.

2302
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,380

02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:07,780
It's okay.

2305
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:10,460
Is there anybody on the ladder?

2306
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:12,400
There we go.

2307
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:14,000
Just guard the ladder!

02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:37,160
It's the ladder strat!

It's okay.

It's fine.

2326
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,720
This is exactly why we don't play hardcore.

2327
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:41,900
This is exactly why.

2328
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:44,200
...

2329
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:44,680
...

2330
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:46,200
...

2331
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:49,520
There we go.

2332
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,460
This is one of the big reasons.

2333
02:13:53,460 --> 02:14:02,840
This is exactly why Doki cannot do hardcore.

2334
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:05,720
Okay, here we go.

2335
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:10,760
We're going to grab the amount of resources that I took.

2336
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:14,420
Boom, boom, boom.

2337
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:15,980
All right, we're good.

2338
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:17,620
Everything is fine now.

2339
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,420
We survived.

2340
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:24,020
So it wasn't never ending.

2341
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,340
So that was a lie.

2342
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:27,980
That was a fucking lie.

2343
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:30,540
Whoever said this was never ending.

2344
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:32,140
There was an end.

2345
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:35,080
There was.

2346
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:37,700
Thank fucking God there was an end.

2347
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:41,720
All right.

2348
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,260
Was there any loot here?

2349
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:46,360
Any loot?

2350
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,900
I went through so much.

2351
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:51,080
God, I went through so much, guys.

2352
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:52,860
Please, we're on the loot.

2353
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:54,360
Boom.

2354
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:55,360
Boom.

2355
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:56,560

It's fine.

2522
02:23:58,370 --> 02:24:00,130
It's just a little flesh wound.

02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:01,550
Just a little.

2524
02:24:01,870 --> 02:24:02,250

Chainsaw Man 2.0.

02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:08,420
I want to turn the photo to the back.

2711
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:14,860

02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:03,400
Like, where we park and stuff.

2721
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:04,520
What is it?

2722
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:05,800
Flesh of our flesh.

2723
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:07,320
Blood of our blood.

2724
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:10,380
Give thanks and rejoice.

2725
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:13,480
Wait, what?

2726
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:14,960
Flesh of our flesh.

2727
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:15,660
Blood of our...

2728
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:16,160
Oh, sorry.

2729
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:18,680
I just, like, kicked the thing, like, always.

2730
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:21,660
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

2731
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:22,820
Flesh of our flesh.

2732
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:24,440
Blood of our blood.

2733
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:25,900
This is not a clue.

2734
02:35:26,020 --> 02:35:26,820
That's not the clue.

2735
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,600
And they keep looking.

2736
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:29,740
Oh, it's here.

2737
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:31,120
Oh, it's a hand grenade.

2738
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:32,660
I can barely see it.

2739
02:35:33,740 --> 02:35:34,980
Can we find the clue?

2740
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:38,100
Oh.

2741
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:40,680
Oh, doesn't matter.

2742
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:41,300
Gunpowder.

2743
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:44,600
Alright, craft shotgun ammo.

2744
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,160
I need that for sure.

2745
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:48,720
Oh.

2746
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:50,920
Oh.

2747
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:52,160
Oh, that doesn't matter.

2748
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:54,600
How are we?

2749
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:56,100
Who does puzzle?

2750
02:35:57,060 --> 02:35:58,740
The other photos?

2751
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:01,600
That photo doesn't make sense.

2752
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:02,860
Wait, isn't that the...

2753
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:04,740
Oh, I thought that was the...

2754
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:07,000
Oh, it's upstairs?

2755
02:36:07,240 --> 02:36:07,540
Okay.

2756
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:11,980
Make sure there's nothing here.

2757
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:14,220
Nice.

2758
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:14,900
Chicken egg.

2759
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:17,560
What... Is that in the oven?

2760
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:19,680
Why is there a chicken egg in the oven?

2761
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:21,240
Ma'am!

2762
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:22,880
I'm not gonna judge you.

2763
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:24,060
But ma'am!

2764
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:25,940
Alright, hello?

I think my bro is up here.

2766
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:31,580

2767
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:32,520
Oh, herbs.

2768
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:34,400

2769
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:35,540
Nice.

Alright, here we go.

2772
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:53,010
In great veneration of their master, the people offer up
their most prized possessions.

2773
02:36:54,090 --> 02:37:03,970
The old farmer, his finest crop, the slight swine head, his
stoutest pig, The beggarly grandam her own beloved babe the

2774
02:37:03,970 --> 02:37:04,190

Okay, we got this.

Crop pig baby.

2780
02:37:15,670 --> 02:37:16,210
Crop pig.

2781
02:37:16,390 --> 02:37:17,390
Wait, why am I saying that loud?

2782
02:37:17,490 --> 02:37:18,570
You guys can tell me.

2783
02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:20,550
Crop.

2784
02:37:21,950 --> 02:37:24,090

02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:53,260
There we go.

2802
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:54,020
Should be it.

2803
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:54,640
Wait, what?

2804
02:38:54,760 --> 02:38:55,540
This should be it.

2805
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:56,900
No, it's not.

2806
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:57,540
Okay.

2807
02:38:58,580 --> 02:38:59,720

I hate this.

2814
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:11,880
That's so sad.

2815
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:15,080
Okay.

2816
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:18,760

Oh, this should be it!

2818
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:21,380

October 10th.

2822
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:32,240
The weather has been strange of late.

2823
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:35,140
The wheat withers, and the cows grow thin.

2824
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:38,120
December 8th, there are signs of famine.

2825
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:39,360
It is true.

2826
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,720
They lack the means to work the fields.

2827
02:39:42,220 --> 02:39:44,500
But Lord Sadler's orders are absolute.

2828
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:49,240
January 30th, 30 people have starved to death.

2829
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:51,960
Five cows will be slaughtered.

2830
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:59,080
March 11th, the patriarchs gathered to cast lots of six more
chosen for Lord Sadler.

Oh, I don't like this.

2869
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:16,240
Ooh, yeah, turn on your flashlight.

2870
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:20,220
I don't like how he doesn't turn on his flashlight instantly
when it's dark.

2871
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:21,840
I don't like that.

2872
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:24,460
It's dark.

2873
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:28,520
Okay, is it safe?

2874
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:29,100
No?

2875
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:31,440
Just a random shed here?

2876
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:35,120
What do I do with this random shed?

2877
02:45:37,480 --> 02:45:37,900
Alright.

2878
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:40,340
Too dark.

2879
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:41,480
Too dark.

2880
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:43,580
I don't like this.

2881
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:46,380
This is way too dark.

2882
02:45:48,280 --> 02:45:49,040
Turn on your flash.

2883
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:50,160

2884
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:53,120

2885
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:56,460
I'm gonna fucking bring out my shotgun at this rate.

2886
02:45:56,860 --> 02:45:57,200
Okay.

2887
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:02,020
Like...

2888
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:03,260
I don't like this.

2889
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:04,060
Oh, wait.

2890
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:05,060
There he is.

2891
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:06,080
Wait, there's a villager.

2892
02:46:09,670 --> 02:46:10,270
Hello.

2893
02:46:11,450 --> 02:46:11,890
Hello?

2894
02:46:13,290 --> 02:46:14,670
Oh, that's another village.

2895
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:16,890
This is another village I'm gonna slaughter.

2896
02:46:18,470 --> 02:46:20,790
Because I don't know what stealth is.

2897
02:46:21,690 --> 02:46:23,490
I guess it is.

2898
02:46:24,170 --> 02:46:25,310
Hello, villagers!

2899
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:28,350
Come here to kill all of you!

2900
02:46:29,490 --> 02:46:30,090
Oh!

2901
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:34,570
Because I don't know how to stealth!

2902
02:46:40,630 --> 02:46:41,150
Hello?

2903
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:43,170
Where are the villagers?

2904
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:49,760
Oh, another village.

2905
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:51,240
Another slaughter.

2906
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:53,960
Hello?

2907
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:54,520
Oh, wait.

2908
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:55,640
This is the first village.

2909
02:46:58,860 --> 02:46:59,280
Oh, wait.

2910
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:00,040
I've been here.

2911
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:01,360
This is the first village.

2912
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:03,780
Alright, let's see.

2913
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:04,200
I should be able to go.

2914
02:47:04,220 --> 02:47:05,260
I get this drawer now.

2915
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:09,900
And there's a treasure here, too.

2916
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:11,680
Wait, I can be able to...

2917
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:12,720
Wait, where's the objectives?

2918
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:15,500
What the fuck do I get over here?

2919
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,140
Like, what?

2920
02:47:19,100 --> 02:47:20,400
How the fuck do I...

2921
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,100
Jesus, Chris, what is this map?

2922
02:47:22,780 --> 02:47:23,900
Alright, let's grab...

2923
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:24,860
I don't like this.

2924
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:27,760
Hello?

2925
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,280
Hello, guys.

2926
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:34,200
Alright.

2927
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:36,420
Let's open this door for...

2928
02:47:36,420 --> 02:47:37,820
Oh, come on.

2929
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:40,040
Who set this trap back?

2930
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:40,520
Huh?

2931
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:43,700
Hello?

2932
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:47,080
I don't like this.

2933
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:49,700
I don't like this at all.

2934
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:52,320
I'm so nervous.

2935
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:57,440
Yeah, why is this village so fucking quiet?

2936
02:47:59,360 --> 02:47:59,780
Hmm.

2937
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:01,580
Hmm.

2938
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:05,940
Hello?

2939
02:48:07,820 --> 02:48:16,180
quiet village doesn't make me happy where do i go i go all
the way back

2940
02:48:20,350 --> 02:48:25,770
because they're playing bingo true they're still playing
bingo right now

2941
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:40,790

wolves there's bad There's bad wolves, there's bad wolves,

2942
02:48:40,930 --> 02:48:42,430

2943
02:48:44,490 --> 02:48:45,170
No!

2944
02:48:51,250 --> 02:48:56,050
Oh god, oh god, there's bad wolves, there's bad wolves!

2945
02:49:01,810 --> 02:49:03,030
That's fucking right...

2946
02:49:03,030 --> 02:49:03,490
No!

2947
02:49:03,870 --> 02:49:04,070
Shit!

2948
02:49:05,890 --> 02:49:06,570
Don't!

2949
02:49:06,730 --> 02:49:06,890
Shit!

2950
02:49:07,030 --> 02:49:08,350
Shit, okay, okay, I'm gonna heal.

Oh my god, my fucking shotgun.

2954
02:49:29,230 --> 02:49:29,830
Holy shit.

2955
02:49:30,410 --> 02:49:32,670
I can't believe there were bad wolves.

2956
02:49:33,790 --> 02:49:36,350
If evil, why bad evil?

2957
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:39,390
What happened to the karma system?

2958
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:41,330
I saved wolf.

2959
02:49:42,050 --> 02:49:43,810
I get reward.

2960
02:49:46,850 --> 02:49:49,310
The karma system was a lie.

2961
02:49:49,450 --> 02:49:51,110
This is why you never do good things.

2962
02:49:53,770 --> 02:49:54,770
Wait, what?

2963
02:49:54,790 --> 02:49:56,470
Is that for Woos?

2964
02:49:57,530 --> 02:50:01,510
This is exactly why you don't do any good thing ever again.

2965
02:50:04,930 --> 02:50:07,430
It was never worth it.

2966
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:13,270
Why save Woos when Woos still evil?

2967
02:50:13,930 --> 02:50:16,510
How the fuck do I use this map?

2968
02:50:17,450 --> 02:50:19,030
Guys, I'm fucking stupid.

2969
02:50:20,110 --> 02:50:20,870
It's the ladder?

2970
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:23,610
Oh, fucking...

2971
02:50:25,910 --> 02:50:26,890
All right.

2972
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:34,860
Oh, hey, I mean, I should take this herb, though.

2973
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:36,880
Might as well.

2974
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:39,360
I guess ladder?

2975
02:50:41,700 --> 02:50:42,580
Where's this?

2976
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:45,100
Oh!

2977
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:48,540
Oh, I don't like this.

2978
02:50:49,720 --> 02:50:52,640
Oh, I don't like this at all.

2979
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:57,150
Hello?

2980
02:50:57,670 --> 02:50:57,970
Hello?

2981
02:51:00,130 --> 02:51:00,730
Hello?

2982
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:07,680
I'm just gonna shoot some boxes.

2983
02:51:10,340 --> 02:51:11,120
Hello, is that rat?

2984
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:13,460
That's a rat.

2985
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,780
Okay, that was just a rat.

2986
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:16,120
Okay.

2987
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:17,800
I'm just gonna...

2988
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:18,520
I'm gonna...

2989
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:20,780
I'm just gonna...

2990
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:21,760
Fucking destroy your barrels.

2991
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:24,960
Alright, nothing to be scared of.

2992
02:51:25,820 --> 02:51:27,780
Oh, what is this?

2993
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:29,020
What is this?

2994
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:30,200
Oh...

2995
02:51:30,800 --> 02:51:31,200
Oh.

2996
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:33,820
Oh.

2997
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:38,500
Honestly, I thought they would just come out of the trash.

2998
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:41,060
Low-key thought they were gonna...

2999
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:42,360
Oh, hey there.

3000
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:45,700
Thies!

3001
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:47,780
Save me now!

3002
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:50,020
Ah!

3003
02:51:50,380 --> 02:51:51,180
There we go!

3004
02:51:52,060 --> 02:51:52,760
Sick thighs!

3005
02:51:53,240 --> 02:51:53,560
Let's go!

3006
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:53,800
Let's go!

3007
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:54,100
Wait, wait.

3008
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:54,720
Is that a chainsaw?

3009
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,360
No, that was not a chainsaw.

3010
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:56,760
Okay.

3011
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:00,320
I'm...

3012
02:52:00,320 --> 02:52:02,040
happy for my thighs.

3013
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:04,560
Nice.

3014
02:52:05,780 --> 02:52:05,960
Alright.

3015
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:07,020
We're good.

3016
02:52:08,100 --> 02:52:08,600
Oh, we're good.

3017
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:09,160
We're okay.

3018
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:12,080
Guys saves lives.

3019
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:12,880
Yeah, that's right.

3020
02:52:13,060 --> 02:52:14,340
This life, too.

3021
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:18,280
I'm gonna make sure.

3022
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:19,600
Did I get everything here?

3023
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:21,920
Let's see.

3024
02:52:22,560 --> 02:52:24,900
How do I go to the door with the insignia?

3025
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:26,780
Yeah, there's nothing here.

3026
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:29,860
I think there's nothing here for me to loot.

3027
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:32,320
We can go to the church now.

3028
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:34,720
Boop!

3029
02:52:41,900 --> 02:52:42,280

As your body grows, your mother shall sew new small clothes.

3043
02:53:47,080 --> 02:53:52,200
At seven quenches of wheat and half a bowl a day, you have
outgrown your pen.

3044
02:53:53,860 --> 02:53:57,800
Flourish, dear child, for the sake of your brothers and
sister who cannot.

knives into, well, bolts.

And that's not all.

3061
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:06,630
You can fix the bolts with detachable mines.

3062
02:55:07,530 --> 02:55:08,490

03:04:18,490 --> 03:04:19,470
I'm the lone shark.

3214
03:04:19,610 --> 03:04:20,790
I'm here to collect my pay.

3215
03:04:21,010 --> 03:04:23,130
I fucking knew those crows were holding out.

3216
03:04:23,550 --> 03:04:24,490
I knew it.

3217
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:27,650
I'm...

3218
03:04:28,850 --> 03:04:31,090
They can't get away from me!

3219
03:04:33,610 --> 03:04:35,850
I knew they were holding out.

3220
03:04:42,140 --> 03:04:44,500
It's our money now.

3221
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:48,200
Mushy Mushy.

3222
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:49,500
The church is sealed up.

3223
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:50,480
And baby eagle?

3224
03:04:51,220 --> 03:04:51,540
Negative.

3225
03:04:52,220 --> 03:04:52,560
Nothing yet.

3226
03:04:53,400 --> 03:04:55,480
But they sure do have this place locked up tight.

3227
03:04:56,460 --> 03:04:56,840
I see.

3228
03:04:57,300 --> 03:04:59,640
I can think of one reason they'd want to do so.

3229
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:00,960
How would they lock it?

3230
03:05:01,460 --> 03:05:03,120
I'm perfectly safe.

3231
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:06,660

I don't think we're climbing over anything on that.

3235
03:05:14,340 --> 03:05:17,380
I don't think so, guys.

3236
03:05:18,020 --> 03:05:19,540

Guys, maybe I should not have wasted the ammo, the barrel

3374
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:26,340
I didn't know there were, like, four more people coming in.

3390
03:14:01,810 --> 03:14:02,050
What?

3391
03:14:02,050 --> 03:14:02,150

3392
03:14:02,170 --> 03:14:03,070

3393
03:14:04,370 --> 03:14:05,370
Why do you went puh?

3394
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:07,650
Right.

3395
03:14:08,550 --> 03:14:08,690
Oh!

3396
03:14:10,530 --> 03:14:11,090

3400
03:14:15,770 --> 03:14:15,930

3401
03:14:16,050 --> 03:14:16,050

3402
03:14:16,370 --> 03:14:16,490
Shake!

3403
03:14:19,510 --> 03:14:20,070
Okay.

3404
03:14:20,610 --> 03:14:21,190
We're okay.

3405
03:14:21,350 --> 03:14:21,770
We're okay.

3406
03:14:21,970 --> 03:14:22,350
We're okay.

3407
03:14:22,930 --> 03:14:23,410
We're okay.

3408
03:14:23,730 --> 03:14:24,010
We're okay.

3409
03:14:25,930 --> 03:14:26,930
Oh my god.

3410
03:14:27,290 --> 03:14:27,830
That's alright.

3411
03:14:28,090 --> 03:14:29,150
I figured it out.

3412
03:14:30,310 --> 03:14:31,870
I figured it out.

3413
03:14:32,570 --> 03:14:33,430
It's okay.

3414
03:14:35,330 --> 03:14:38,190
You really heard that stabbing.

3415
03:14:40,290 --> 03:14:42,430
Wait, where the fuck was he throwing at?

3416
03:14:43,650 --> 03:14:45,090
Maybe I should just start shanking.

3417
03:14:46,050 --> 03:14:47,670
Maybe I should have upgraded the power.

3418
03:14:47,790 --> 03:14:48,470
What the fuck?

3419
03:14:50,810 --> 03:14:51,850

3420
03:14:51,850 --> 03:14:52,770
Wait, what the fuck?

3421
03:14:52,910 --> 03:14:56,350
I clearly chose the wrong thing to upgrade.

3422
03:14:57,090 --> 03:14:57,930
Do I need to shank you?

3423
03:14:58,610 --> 03:15:00,070
Wait, there's more of you?

3424
03:15:01,090 --> 03:15:02,150

Exactly.

3471
03:17:48,550 --> 03:17:53,670
If he comes back without the president's daughter, they're
just gonna laugh at him.

3472
03:17:56,530 --> 03:17:58,870
You're gonna make fun of him.

03:18:03,860 --> 03:18:05,090
Okay, let's go up.

3474
03:18:11,480 --> 03:18:15,000
He wants to show stars that he's not just a pretty boy.

03:18:16,360 --> 03:18:17,840
That he's more than just that.

It's a giant.

03:18:24,380 --> 03:18:26,800
That he's more than just the thighs.

3481
03:18:27,580 --> 03:18:29,700
Is there anyone where you can destroy these blue medallions?

3482
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:32,880
The air is polluted by their presence, and I can't bear it.

03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:43,800
It means fucking nothing.

3493
03:19:47,700 --> 03:19:48,500
Oh, that's true.

3494
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:51,140
Wait, actually, Bacon, that is so fucking true.

3495
03:19:51,280 --> 03:19:51,840
Wait, you're right.

3496
03:19:52,540 --> 03:19:54,380
He doesn't love his daughter enough.

3497
03:19:55,460 --> 03:19:56,140
You're right.

3498
03:19:56,920 --> 03:20:01,500
Bacon, if the president really wanted his daughter back, I'm
sure he would have sent that more than one guy.

3499
03:20:01,620 --> 03:20:03,720
Oh, no, that's where the troll is.

3500
03:20:04,140 --> 03:20:05,080
Wait a minute.

3501
03:20:06,560 --> 03:20:07,400
Wait a minute.

3502
03:20:07,620 --> 03:20:08,960
That's the troll, man.

3503
03:20:09,740 --> 03:20:11,680
I don't want to pay no toll.

3504
03:20:12,620 --> 03:20:13,560
Oh, get up there.

3505
03:20:15,540 --> 03:20:16,100
That's right.

3506
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:19,120
He wanted his daughter to never come back.

3507
03:20:24,620 --> 03:20:26,180
Oh my god.

3508
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:27,840
This man.

3509
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:29,680
This man knows what's up.

3510
03:20:30,460 --> 03:20:31,040
You're right.

3511
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:33,340
He would have said two guys.

3512
03:20:34,480 --> 03:20:35,280
It was just a...

3513
03:20:35,280 --> 03:20:38,260
He knew Leon didn't have it in him.

3514
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:39,720
Where is this?

3515
03:20:39,740 --> 03:20:41,680
Do I have to look up again?

3516
03:20:41,920 --> 03:20:42,400

3517
03:20:42,580 --> 03:20:43,380

3518
03:20:45,620 --> 03:20:47,040
I always knew I had to look up.

3519
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:52,660

03:20:56,200 --> 03:20:56,980

03:21:12,620 --> 03:21:13,580

That fucking sucks, bro.

3537
03:21:55,420 --> 03:22:00,120
Anything related to, like, teeth seed surgery stuff is
fucking sucks in general.

3538
03:22:02,980 --> 03:22:04,120
Oh, now I can clap.

3544
03:22:17,300 --> 03:22:17,380
Merchant?

3545
03:22:17,900 --> 03:22:18,500
There's a thing.

3546
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:21,760
Is this where the merchant is?

3547
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:24,000
Merchant?

3548
03:22:24,820 --> 03:22:25,720
That's your flame!

3549
03:22:26,280 --> 03:22:26,800
Is it not?

3550
03:22:29,240 --> 03:22:30,420

3551
03:22:31,140 --> 03:22:31,940

What's this?

3556
03:22:41,260 --> 03:22:43,140
There are enough weapons here to get a party going.

3557
03:22:44,040 --> 03:22:46,040
Alright, I'm gonna grab this.

3558
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:53,580
Instead of letting your unused guns collect dust, why not
sell them to spend the extra cash to upgrade a weapon you do

3559
03:22:53,580 --> 03:22:54,140
use?

3560
03:22:54,540 --> 03:22:54,780
Okay.

3561
03:22:55,180 --> 03:22:56,680
Oh, I get almost all my money back.

3562
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:58,700
Oh my god, you're not gonna scam people?

3563
03:22:59,200 --> 03:23:01,380
You're better than regular merchants.

3564
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:07,740
Alright, let me sell this.

3565
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:10,000
A headdress with red...

3566
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:11,420
Oh, this is where we put stones.

3567
03:23:11,500 --> 03:23:13,500
I don't think I have enough stones yet for this.

3568
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:14,540
I need three.

3569
03:23:14,740 --> 03:23:16,020
I need like one more ruby.

3570
03:23:17,320 --> 03:23:19,060
Uh, I'm gonna sell you first.

3571
03:23:19,280 --> 03:23:20,140
I'm gonna sell you two.

3572
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:23,220
And then I need to grab more guns.

3573
03:23:23,720 --> 03:23:23,720
Okay.

3574
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:27,540
Wait, can I?

3575
03:23:28,020 --> 03:23:29,280
I cannot buy.

3576
03:23:30,520 --> 03:23:32,740
Oh, technically I can trade for it.

3577
03:23:32,780 --> 03:23:34,880
I feel like I'm gonna wait until I find another ruby.

3578
03:23:37,140 --> 03:23:37,580
Uh.

3579
03:23:38,880 --> 03:23:39,760
More guns?

3580
03:23:40,720 --> 03:23:42,680
None of these guns are worth it, though.

3581
03:23:42,940 --> 03:23:43,900
I don't think so.

3597
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:43,100

03:25:06,440 --> 03:25:07,440
Oh, that's easy.

3607
03:25:08,640 --> 03:25:10,340
Destroy several targets by shooting nearby diamond.

3608
03:25:10,520 --> 03:25:11,680
Be careful when shooting a sailor.

3609
03:25:11,960 --> 03:25:12,160
Okay.

3610
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:14,600
Some targets cannot be destroyed with one shot.

3611
03:25:14,660 --> 03:25:16,820
Shoot as many shots until they break.

3612
03:25:16,840 --> 03:25:24,880

I'm so anxious.

3621
03:26:05,520 --> 03:26:06,900
Does it matter if it's a headshot?

3622
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:09,700
Oh, it matters if there's a skull.

3623
03:26:11,540 --> 03:26:13,080
I'm fucking up!

3624
03:26:20,010 --> 03:26:21,290

03:27:11,190 --> 03:27:11,450
We're okay.

3639
03:27:20,620 --> 03:27:21,600
What's the bonus time?

3640
03:27:25,150 --> 03:27:26,230
There's fallout!

3641
03:27:40,010 --> 03:27:40,550
Okay.

3642
03:27:40,810 --> 03:27:41,410
4 out of 6.

3643
03:27:41,550 --> 03:27:42,230
Okay, nice.

3644
03:27:42,790 --> 03:27:43,750

We're good.

3648
03:27:46,230 --> 03:27:46,990
We're okay.

3649
03:27:47,450 --> 03:27:48,290
A hundred percent.

3650
03:27:48,370 --> 03:27:50,590
Okay, we're gonna get that hundred percent.

3651
03:27:50,830 --> 03:27:56,250
Okay, we're going to get that 100%.

3652
03:27:56,250 --> 03:27:57,430
We can do this.

3653
03:28:01,380 --> 03:28:01,980
Oh, God.

3654
03:28:02,300 --> 03:28:03,100
That was close.

3655
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:05,340
That was too close.

3656
03:28:06,420 --> 03:28:06,920

I already ruined it.

3661
03:28:37,100 --> 03:28:38,240

3662
03:28:39,780 --> 03:28:40,580
Okay.

3663
03:28:40,600 --> 03:28:42,280
It's already gone.

3664
03:28:44,820 --> 03:28:45,340
No!

3665
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:53,860

3666
03:28:55,740 --> 03:28:57,160
We were so close!

3667
03:28:57,700 --> 03:28:58,820
Okay, this time, this time.

3668
03:28:59,820 --> 03:29:00,520

03:29:10,840 --> 03:29:11,800
That was close.

3674
03:29:12,120 --> 03:29:12,800
I'm in the groove.

3675
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:13,720

The saddest violin.

3693
03:30:28,050 --> 03:30:29,930
It truly is.

3694
03:30:29,950 --> 03:30:31,650
What is the saddest thing?

3695
03:30:32,690 --> 03:30:33,710
Oh, I can collide?

3696
03:30:34,890 --> 03:30:35,670
Bro, what?

3697
03:30:36,270 --> 03:30:38,170

3698
03:30:39,490 --> 03:30:41,670
Oh, fuck, I didn't see it!

3699

I didn't realize there was a collab.

3708
03:31:16,250 --> 03:31:16,590
Okay.

3709

03:33:47,250 --> 03:33:48,090
Wait, what does that mean?

3746
03:33:49,450 --> 03:33:51,170
How do I put the charms on?

3747
03:33:52,690 --> 03:33:54,250
Okay, but how do I put it on?

3748
03:33:57,630 --> 03:33:58,230
Like...

3749
03:33:58,230 --> 03:33:59,050
Do I...

3750
03:33:59,050 --> 03:34:00,290
How do I put that on?

3751
03:34:00,490 --> 03:34:00,850
Do I...

3752
03:34:00,850 --> 03:34:02,750
It's just on me this entire time?

3753
03:34:03,410 --> 03:34:04,450
Do I...

3754
03:34:04,450 --> 03:34:05,710
Oh, sell...

3755
03:34:05,710 --> 03:34:06,550
Sell ammo.

3756
03:34:06,550 --> 03:34:07,770
Oh, you sell ammo!

3757
03:34:08,590 --> 03:34:09,190
Typewriter!

3758
03:34:09,310 --> 03:34:10,250
Oh, okay.

3759
03:34:11,190 --> 03:34:12,650
All right, or go to a typewriter.

3760
03:34:17,570 --> 03:34:17,670
Hmm.

3761
03:34:19,430 --> 03:34:20,290
All right, nice.

03:34:20,550 --> 03:34:21,290

03:34:28,650 --> 03:34:29,530
Equip left.

3767
03:34:30,410 --> 03:34:31,950
Oh, I can equip everything!

3768
03:34:33,810 --> 03:34:34,890
Look at them.

3769
03:34:35,630 --> 03:34:36,010
Look at...

3770
03:34:36,010 --> 03:34:38,230
I don't remember what they were, but look at them.

3771
03:34:38,810 --> 03:34:39,470

3775
03:35:07,830 --> 03:35:08,570
We didn't chill for now.

3776
03:35:09,150 --> 03:35:11,050
Do we go downstairs or through the door?

3777
03:35:12,090 --> 03:35:14,130
I think through the door is the troll.

3778
03:35:15,670 --> 03:35:16,710
Backseat is saved though.

3779
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:17,390
Oh wait, did I just save?

3780
03:35:17,470 --> 03:35:18,130
I don't remember what I saved.

3781
03:35:18,310 --> 03:35:18,930
I'm gonna save again.

3782
03:35:20,110 --> 03:35:20,850
Repair a knife.

3783
03:35:21,070 --> 03:35:21,630
Oh shit.

3784
03:35:21,950 --> 03:35:23,190
Did I not repair it?

3785
03:35:24,070 --> 03:35:24,870
Tune up.

3786
03:35:25,390 --> 03:35:26,130
Let's see.

3787
03:35:27,590 --> 03:35:28,390
It's alright.

3788
03:35:28,750 --> 03:35:29,970
It has a lot of HP.

3789
03:35:34,010 --> 03:35:34,450
Alright.

3790
03:35:35,310 --> 03:35:38,790
Do we go downstairs or through it downstairs or through the
door.

3791
03:35:39,470 --> 03:35:42,590
I hear very conflicting answers, so I went downstairs.

3792
03:35:53,610 --> 03:35:54,490
Shoot the lake.

3793
03:35:54,990 --> 03:35:55,610
Okay, guys.

3794
03:35:55,930 --> 03:35:56,410
This is it.

3795
03:35:57,090 --> 03:35:57,770
This is it.

3796
03:35:58,790 --> 03:35:59,630
I can shoot this.

3797
03:36:01,730 --> 03:36:02,730
This is it.

3798
03:36:03,050 --> 03:36:04,090
Are we here?

3799
03:36:07,150 --> 03:36:08,770
Oh, not this lake.

3800
03:36:08,790 --> 03:36:10,350
God damn it.

3801
03:36:12,530 --> 03:36:13,490
Wrong lake.

3802
03:36:13,910 --> 03:36:17,050
I am just listening to what you guys are telling me, guys.

3803
03:36:17,850 --> 03:36:19,110
Wait, but then what's through the door?

3804
03:36:21,430 --> 03:36:22,130
Oh, wait.

3805
03:36:22,230 --> 03:36:23,130
Downstairs is just loot.

3806
03:36:24,490 --> 03:36:25,070
That's good.

3807
03:36:25,450 --> 03:36:25,990
It's just loot.

3808
03:36:26,210 --> 03:36:26,710
What the fuck?

3809
03:36:26,770 --> 03:36:27,450
What's that sound?

3810
03:36:28,910 --> 03:36:30,190
Is there any more loot in there?

3811
03:36:31,110 --> 03:36:31,350
Loot?

3812
03:36:32,770 --> 03:36:33,730
No more loot.

3813
03:36:35,890 --> 03:36:38,570
Guys, one day we'll get to the right lake, guys.

3814
03:36:38,790 --> 03:36:39,810
It's just not today.

3815
03:36:40,630 --> 03:36:42,570
We just haven't made it to the right lake.

3816
03:36:46,530 --> 03:36:46,830
Collectible.

3817
03:36:47,310 --> 03:36:48,410
Oh, I didn't even hear that.

3818
03:36:49,650 --> 03:36:50,430
Guys, there's so...

3819
03:36:50,430 --> 03:36:52,570
Oh, that's the sound I was hearing.

3820
03:36:55,390 --> 03:36:57,270
That's like wondering what that sound was.

3821
03:37:02,280 --> 03:37:03,180
Oh, there he is.

3822
03:37:03,240 --> 03:37:03,720
Oh, my God.

3823
03:37:03,780 --> 03:37:04,440
How did I miss?

3824
03:37:04,820 --> 03:37:05,620
There he is.

3825
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:07,940
That's what it was.

3826
03:37:09,220 --> 03:37:10,600
It was just a loot detour.

3827
03:37:11,260 --> 03:37:12,560
I got my tangerines.

3828
03:37:13,800 --> 03:37:14,760
Let's go.

3829
03:37:17,620 --> 03:37:18,440
Is it time to fight?

3830
03:37:18,620 --> 03:37:19,320
Okay, fine.

3831
03:37:19,620 --> 03:37:20,080
Fine!

3832
03:37:20,440 --> 03:37:21,240
I'll repair it.

3833
03:37:21,400 --> 03:37:22,060
I have enough money.

3834
03:37:23,420 --> 03:37:23,920
Alright, guys.

3835
03:37:24,040 --> 03:37:24,560
It's time!

3836
03:37:25,200 --> 03:37:26,240
It's troll time!

3837
03:37:27,420 --> 03:37:29,120
Can you make sure I reload everything?

3838
03:37:30,300 --> 03:37:32,680
I need to make sure everything is reloaded.

3839
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:33,600
Okay, let me see.

3840
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:35,020
Do I have... Oh, I have enough to craft.

3841
03:37:35,160 --> 03:37:35,640
Okay, nice.

3842
03:37:35,900 --> 03:37:36,640
Okay, craft.

3843
03:37:37,360 --> 03:37:37,840
Rifle.

3844
03:37:38,400 --> 03:37:39,580
We need rifle anyway.

3845
03:37:40,380 --> 03:37:40,700
Okay.

3846
03:37:41,060 --> 03:37:41,480
Boop.

3847
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:43,520
here.

3848
03:37:44,720 --> 03:37:45,960
Maybe that's your craft another one?

3849
03:37:48,060 --> 03:37:48,940
It's time.

3850
03:37:49,860 --> 03:37:51,260
It's craft time.

3851
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:53,800
Here we go.

3852
03:37:54,960 --> 03:37:56,200
It's time for the troll.

3853
03:37:57,720 --> 03:37:58,720
Wait, is it?

3854
03:38:01,280 --> 03:38:02,680
Wait, that goes the wrong way?

3855
03:38:02,780 --> 03:38:03,400
Oh, it's this way.

3856
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:03,760
Whoops.

3857
03:38:04,820 --> 03:38:05,280
Sorry.

3858
03:38:06,260 --> 03:38:06,900
It's sorry.

3859
03:38:07,020 --> 03:38:07,960
It was this way.

3860
03:38:08,160 --> 03:38:08,640
Never mind.

3861
03:38:08,740 --> 03:38:10,040
It's not troll time.

3862
03:38:10,960 --> 03:38:12,640
It's not troll time.

3863
03:38:13,060 --> 03:38:14,380
It's fish time!

3864
03:38:15,440 --> 03:38:16,060
Fish this early?

3865

Don't remember.

3926
03:42:18,780 --> 03:42:20,820
Now I have to do this again.

3927
03:42:22,760 --> 03:42:24,140
Oh, my God.

3928
03:42:27,280 --> 03:42:31,540
I thought they would auto save me earlier, but I was wrong.

3929
03:42:33,120 --> 03:42:34,940
The auto save was not that.

3930
03:42:35,240 --> 03:42:37,300
It was not there.

3931
03:42:39,020 --> 03:42:40,240
I already shoot him?

3932
03:42:40,400 --> 03:42:41,100
I already did.

3933
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:43,920
Oh my god.

3934
03:42:44,660 --> 03:42:46,100
Did I repair my knife?

3935
03:42:46,680 --> 03:42:49,500
Okay, well no, but if I repaired my knife.

3936
03:42:50,900 --> 03:42:52,060
Okay, wait, let's see.

3937
03:42:52,780 --> 03:42:53,920
Did I repair it?

3938
03:42:54,040 --> 03:42:55,160
I did it.

3939
03:42:56,880 --> 03:42:58,480
Oh god, okay.

3940
03:42:59,320 --> 03:42:59,630
Let's...

3941
03:43:00,260 --> 03:43:02,160
Okay, I customized the case.

3942
03:43:02,280 --> 03:43:02,900
Okay, that's good.

3943
03:43:03,300 --> 03:43:04,460
That's good.

3944
03:43:07,220 --> 03:43:08,480
Okay, I customized the case.

3945
03:43:08,500 --> 03:43:09,920
Customize the case.

3946
03:43:10,240 --> 03:43:10,880
That's good.

3947
03:43:11,100 --> 03:43:11,520
We're okay.

3948
03:43:11,840 --> 03:43:12,360
We're okay.

3949
03:43:13,900 --> 03:43:15,000
Case has been customized.

3950
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:16,800
I don't have to worry about that.

3951
03:43:17,300 --> 03:43:17,640
Alright.

3952
03:43:18,240 --> 03:43:19,500
No, I already have it.

3953
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:20,560
I already have everything.

3954
03:43:21,980 --> 03:43:22,200
Alright.

3955
03:43:22,880 --> 03:43:24,260
Back here we go.

3956
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:26,500
It's time to look at the fish again.

3957
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:28,340
It's okay.

3958
03:43:28,380 --> 03:43:30,380
I saved my rifle ammo.

3959
03:43:32,380 --> 03:43:32,840
It's okay.

3960
03:43:32,860 --> 03:43:34,380
We can watch this again, our friend.

3961
03:43:39,590 --> 03:43:41,650
Yeah, we didn't waste any ammo, guys.

3962
03:43:41,790 --> 03:43:43,650
That's the best part.

3963
03:43:43,990 --> 03:43:45,710
We always travel.

3964
03:43:48,990 --> 03:43:49,310
Nice.

3965
03:43:50,410 --> 03:43:50,910
Wait, I can skip?

3966
03:43:51,270 --> 03:43:51,970
Oh, I can skip.

3967
03:43:52,470 --> 03:43:53,710
No, we won't watch this again.

3968
03:43:54,290 --> 03:43:54,390
Yay.

3969
03:43:56,030 --> 03:43:56,910
Goodbye, fish.

3970
03:43:58,670 --> 03:43:59,110
Goodbye.

3971
03:44:00,070 --> 03:44:02,670
Yeah, that was my first death because of the fucking fish.

3972
03:44:03,610 --> 03:44:04,410
Where's the castle?

3973
03:44:04,710 --> 03:44:05,790
So I was like, look at the castle.

3974
03:44:06,070 --> 03:44:06,570
Oh, I can.

3975
03:44:06,850 --> 03:44:07,150
Damn.

3976
03:44:08,990 --> 03:44:10,650
He's like Lord Farquad.

3977
03:44:10,810 --> 03:44:11,630
He's compensating.

3978
03:44:12,550 --> 03:44:16,070
Oh, yeah, he's just, he's just as short as him, too!

3979
03:44:16,870 --> 03:44:19,470
He is just like Lord Farquad.

3980
03:44:22,110 --> 03:44:23,670
I'm not gonna shoot the water.

3981
03:44:25,430 --> 03:44:27,850
We've already established the water.

3982
03:44:31,450 --> 03:44:31,710
Okay.

3983
03:44:32,270 --> 03:44:33,690
Gotta get the money.

3984
03:44:34,610 --> 03:44:35,550
The money.

3985
03:44:37,230 --> 03:44:39,570
Alright, let's put this guy in.

3986
03:44:39,810 --> 03:44:40,750
We need, like, two more.

3987
03:44:42,390 --> 03:44:43,430
Uh, hello.

3988
03:44:45,530 --> 03:44:46,050
Sparrows.

3989
03:44:47,390 --> 03:44:47,850
Got our loot.

3990
03:44:49,090 --> 03:44:50,210
Just some herbs.

3991
03:44:51,030 --> 03:44:52,350
And another kitchen knife.

3992
03:44:53,390 --> 03:44:54,630
Good old kitchen knife.

3993
03:44:55,570 --> 03:44:56,270
I'm not gonna...

3994
03:44:56,270 --> 03:44:57,930
Guys, I'm not looting this again.

3995
03:45:00,230 --> 03:45:02,310
Can't make me loot this again.

3996
03:45:03,970 --> 03:45:05,190
Wait, is there an egg in here?

3997
03:45:06,690 --> 03:45:07,310
Oh, ammo.

3998
03:45:07,510 --> 03:45:08,790
That's even better than an egg.

3999
03:45:10,990 --> 03:45:11,510
Ammo.

4000
03:45:11,790 --> 03:45:13,010
That's even better.

4001
03:45:13,890 --> 03:45:16,230
And I saved my two rifle ammo from earlier.

4002
03:45:16,990 --> 03:45:17,690
Alright, we're not gonna...

4003
03:45:17,690 --> 03:45:20,130
We're not gonna shoot the lake again.

4004
03:45:21,130 --> 03:45:22,030
Uh, oh yeah.

4005
03:45:22,410 --> 03:45:24,570
Wait, we need to figure out where the medallion is.

4006
03:45:25,590 --> 03:45:26,650
Guys, where is the medallion?

4007
03:45:27,510 --> 03:45:29,250
It's like somewhere here.

4008
03:45:30,690 --> 03:45:31,970
It's not...

4009
03:45:31,970 --> 03:45:32,970
Up above?

4010
03:45:33,930 --> 03:45:35,510
Wait, where's the medallion?

4011
03:45:39,400 --> 03:45:40,040
Under?

4012
03:45:40,980 --> 03:45:41,420
Here?

4013
03:45:43,240 --> 03:45:45,360
I don't see it.

4014
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:47,780
Wait, where is it?

4015
03:45:49,220 --> 03:45:51,440
Where the fuck is the medallion?

4016
03:45:53,620 --> 03:45:54,360
Guys, I don't know.

4017
03:45:54,580 --> 03:45:55,160
Let's go back.

4018
03:45:55,540 --> 03:45:56,620
I don't...

4019
03:45:57,220 --> 03:45:58,580
Guys, I don't know.

4020
03:45:58,660 --> 03:45:59,600
I don't feel so good.

4021
03:46:01,540 --> 03:46:02,820
Oh, there it is.

4022
03:46:03,280 --> 03:46:03,820
Thank God.

4023
03:46:05,620 --> 03:46:06,700
Oh, thank God.

4024
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:07,160
Okay.

4025
03:46:07,540 --> 03:46:09,100
I got scared.

4026
03:46:09,300 --> 03:46:11,120
I actually got scared.

4027
03:46:11,420 --> 03:46:12,800
I was like, guys, I don't know.

4028
03:46:12,880 --> 03:46:14,820
I don't really want to go back there, guys.

4029
03:46:16,280 --> 03:46:17,800
There's, like, something above.

4030
03:46:20,420 --> 03:46:21,220
Like, here?

4031
03:46:23,440 --> 03:46:24,680
There's something back there.

4032
03:46:24,760 --> 03:46:27,080
Do I go back there?

4033
03:46:29,200 --> 03:46:29,600
Or...

4034
03:46:29,600 --> 03:46:31,420
I don't know if I should go back here.

4035
03:46:35,350 --> 03:46:38,270
I'm worried this is going to advance the...

4036
03:46:38,270 --> 03:46:41,490
Okay, this is going to advance stuff.

4037
03:46:43,990 --> 03:46:45,030
There's the boat.

4038
03:46:45,570 --> 03:46:46,390
Do I click the boat?

4039
03:46:48,350 --> 03:46:49,210
Yeah, check the boat.

4040
03:46:49,290 --> 03:46:49,990
I'm gonna check the boat.

4041
03:46:51,930 --> 03:46:53,850
It's like there was a boat there too.

4042
03:46:54,370 --> 03:46:56,670
I swear to God, the fucking fish eats me while I look at the
boat.

4043
03:46:57,330 --> 03:46:58,330
I swear to fucking God.

4044
03:46:58,530 --> 03:46:58,650
Okay.

4045
03:46:59,050 --> 03:46:59,750
Come on.

4046
03:46:59,970 --> 03:47:00,210
Okay.

4047
03:47:01,650 --> 03:47:03,770
Oh, it's a gas thing.

4048
03:47:03,950 --> 03:47:04,910
It's a gas mission.

4049
03:47:05,850 --> 03:47:06,730
Oh, thank God, okay.

4050
03:47:07,210 --> 03:47:13,350
I was gonna be like, I swear to God, if I check the boat and
the fish comes out, I swear to fucking God.

4051
03:47:14,630 --> 03:47:16,890
I'm not gonna- I shot the lake.

4052
03:47:17,150 --> 03:47:18,550
I already shot the lake.

4053
03:47:19,010 --> 03:47:20,610
I'm not doing that again.

4054
03:47:21,770 --> 03:47:22,090
All right.

4055
03:47:22,850 --> 03:47:22,850
Hello?

4056
03:47:25,670 --> 03:47:26,190
Oh!

4057
03:47:26,190 --> 03:47:26,710
No!

4058
03:47:27,630 --> 03:47:29,490
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4059
03:47:29,790 --> 03:47:30,690
The fish can't be here.

4060
03:47:31,030 --> 03:47:33,650
It's too fucking- it's not deep enough.

4061
03:47:38,000 --> 03:47:39,180
Oh, wait a minute!

4062
03:47:39,960 --> 03:47:40,760
It's him again!

4063
03:47:41,040 --> 03:47:41,560
Oh, shit.

4064
03:47:41,620 --> 03:47:42,360
Okay, that scared me.

4065
03:47:42,400 --> 03:47:44,200
I thought like I got shot at myself.

4066
03:47:46,160 --> 03:47:46,600
Okay.

4067
03:47:49,380 --> 03:47:49,820
Woo!

4068
03:47:53,110 --> 03:47:53,550
Okay.

4069
03:47:54,090 --> 03:47:55,090
Granny, get out of here.

4070
03:47:55,450 --> 03:47:56,310
Oh, Granny, please.

4071
03:47:56,590 --> 03:47:56,750
Get stuck.

4072
03:47:56,850 --> 03:47:58,310
Oh, I can't get there in time.

4073
03:47:59,090 --> 03:48:00,170
I can't get there in time.

4074
03:48:01,410 --> 03:48:02,230
Oh, oh, wait.

4075
03:48:02,750 --> 03:48:03,710
Wait, he's pretty big.

4076
03:48:04,870 --> 03:48:05,150
Oh!

4077
03:48:11,150 --> 03:48:11,950
Oh, no.

4078
03:48:12,630 --> 03:48:12,870
Oh, no.

4079
03:48:12,870 --> 03:48:14,410
He's gonna turn, but I don't have time.

4080
03:48:14,810 --> 03:48:15,910
I don't have time.

4081
03:48:16,690 --> 03:48:18,010
I don't have time!

4082
03:48:22,310 --> 03:48:23,470
Oh, shit!

4083
03:48:25,090 --> 03:48:26,110
Okay, that hit her.

4084
03:48:26,130 --> 03:48:26,590
her head.

4085
03:48:27,170 --> 03:48:29,950
That was not what I wanted to do, but that's fine.

4086
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:37,850
Jesus Christ, that took so long.

4087
03:48:38,490 --> 03:48:39,630
Alright, that's okay.

4088
03:48:40,030 --> 03:48:40,430
It's okay.

4089
03:48:40,490 --> 03:48:41,250
I still lived.

4090
03:48:42,470 --> 03:48:44,610
Not scared the shit out of me, but I still lived.

4091
03:48:46,330 --> 03:48:49,210
It hit her head, but it still worked.

4092
03:48:49,730 --> 03:48:50,070
Okay?

4093
03:48:50,750 --> 03:48:51,810
It still worked.

4094
03:48:51,890 --> 03:48:52,890
That's all that mattered.

4095
03:48:54,890 --> 03:48:56,810
The fucking ricochet there.

4096
03:48:58,390 --> 03:48:58,950
Wait, what?

4097
03:48:59,230 --> 03:48:59,930
I heard a snake.

4098
03:49:01,210 --> 03:49:02,030
That's like you're right.

4099
03:49:02,730 --> 03:49:04,010
You can't get away from me.

4100
03:49:04,870 --> 03:49:05,650
I need that money.

4101
03:49:06,770 --> 03:49:07,630
You had a grenade.

4102
03:49:09,970 --> 03:49:10,670
I think that...

4103
03:49:10,670 --> 03:49:12,230
That was such a waste of a grenade.

4104
03:49:13,930 --> 03:49:14,450
I...

4105
03:49:14,450 --> 03:49:17,530
I did not need it to fucking do that.

4106
03:49:18,750 --> 03:49:20,010
Get high ground.

4107
03:49:22,030 --> 03:49:22,290
Okay.

4108
03:49:22,550 --> 03:49:23,610
We'll take the high ground.

4109
03:49:24,870 --> 03:49:26,830
I'm already lost, by the way.

4110
03:49:28,210 --> 03:49:29,210
I am...

4111
03:49:29,230 --> 03:49:30,330
Did I come from here?

4112
03:49:30,510 --> 03:49:31,570
I came from here, right?

4113
03:49:31,710 --> 03:49:32,690
No, I did not.

4114
03:49:33,410 --> 03:49:34,790
Oh, wait a minute.

4115
03:49:35,970 --> 03:49:37,530
Whoa, what's that sound?

4116
03:49:40,070 --> 03:49:40,590
Arrows?

4117
03:49:43,010 --> 03:49:44,710
Someone shot an arrow?

4118
03:49:48,240 --> 03:49:49,500
I don't see anybody.

4119
03:49:50,800 --> 03:49:51,500
Am I safe?

4120
03:49:52,760 --> 03:49:54,360
I think I'm good, right?

4121
03:49:55,780 --> 03:49:56,880
Down I go.

4122
03:49:58,320 --> 03:49:59,960
We need our map emote back.

4123
03:50:03,480 --> 03:50:06,480
I'll just photoshop a map on top of my dog.

4124
03:50:07,680 --> 03:50:09,620
Wait, wait, there is an arrow!

4125
03:50:10,620 --> 03:50:12,160
I'm a better sniper than you, though.

4126
03:50:14,060 --> 03:50:14,680
There you go.

4127
03:50:15,300 --> 03:50:15,740
Headshot.

4128
03:50:17,760 --> 03:50:19,400
That's right, I don't need no flames.

4129
03:50:22,480 --> 03:50:24,060
Okay, is there anything I'm missing?

4130
03:50:24,340 --> 03:50:26,100
There's one more medallion here.

4131
03:50:28,120 --> 03:50:30,420
Okay, I'm gonna make sure I kill everybody for before.

4132
03:50:31,160 --> 03:50:31,740
Wait, where's that?

4133
03:50:32,100 --> 03:50:32,940
Oh, there he is.

4134
03:50:33,860 --> 03:50:34,540
Wrong way, sucker.

4135
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:36,140
Loser.

4136
03:50:37,700 --> 03:50:38,820
Wrong way.

4137
03:50:41,040 --> 03:50:41,600
Man.

4138
03:50:43,020 --> 03:50:43,860
That's sucking right.

4139
03:50:44,440 --> 03:50:45,080
Please don't turn.

4140
03:50:45,240 --> 03:50:45,820
Please don't turn.

4141
03:50:46,100 --> 03:50:46,580
Oh, thank God.

4142
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:47,740
Oh, shit!

4143
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:49,800
That's fine.

4144
03:50:51,400 --> 03:50:51,920
That's fine.

4145
03:50:54,160 --> 03:50:54,720
Easy.

4146
03:50:55,280 --> 03:50:56,520
Oh, oh.

4147
03:50:58,520 --> 03:50:59,240
There we go.

4148
03:50:59,960 --> 03:51:01,660
You're still alive?

4149
03:51:02,420 --> 03:51:07,960
There you go Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I hear it beep beep
beep beep.

4150
03:51:08,280 --> 03:51:09,960
Oh shit head.

4151
03:51:10,680 --> 03:51:16,260
Oh shit I heard beeps.

4152
03:51:17,100 --> 03:51:17,700
Where?

4153
03:51:18,920 --> 03:51:19,940
No, I'm not the one.

4154
03:51:22,470 --> 03:51:22,930
Oh shit.

4155
03:51:23,530 --> 03:51:27,370
Jotunate Oh, there's so many people.

4156
03:51:27,690 --> 03:51:28,450
Oh shit.

4157
03:51:28,450 --> 03:51:28,450

4160
03:52:01,690 --> 03:52:03,050
Dude, that Perry's out.

4161
03:52:04,030 --> 03:52:05,790
That was some sick Perry.

4162
03:52:06,930 --> 03:52:08,250
All right, let's see.

4163
03:52:08,490 --> 03:52:10,590
We got to, we can eat our eggs now.

4164
03:52:11,090 --> 03:52:14,670
You know, we can, we can eat our, look, see, look at that.

4165
03:52:14,790 --> 03:52:15,890
Nothing to worry about.

4166
03:52:16,250 --> 03:52:17,290
We ate our eggs.

4167
03:52:18,270 --> 03:52:19,710
Nothing to worry about.

4168
03:52:21,150 --> 03:52:21,630
Guys.

4169
03:52:22,710 --> 03:52:24,250
Woo, so calm.

4170
03:52:26,190 --> 03:52:27,330
Where is that?

4171
03:52:29,030 --> 03:52:29,590
Where the fuck?

4172
03:52:29,670 --> 03:52:30,470
Oh, the beeping was.

4173
03:52:30,490 --> 03:52:30,870
here.

4174
03:52:32,010 --> 03:52:34,290
Okay, I almost ran into that.

4175
03:52:34,550 --> 03:52:35,110
Thank God.

4176
03:52:37,690 --> 03:52:39,490
Thank God I heard the beeps in time.

4177
03:52:40,990 --> 03:52:41,550
Okay, Barrel.

4178
03:52:43,070 --> 03:52:43,250
Nice.

4179
03:52:43,390 --> 03:52:44,210
Oh, more money!

4180
03:52:45,270 --> 03:52:46,030
That's what I like.

4181
03:52:49,050 --> 03:52:51,130
Okay, there's a treasure here.

4182
03:52:51,970 --> 03:52:53,610
There's like two more medallions.

4183
03:52:55,390 --> 03:52:56,590
Where could they be?

4184
03:53:00,490 --> 03:53:02,610
Where could the medallions be?

4185
03:53:03,710 --> 03:53:06,050
I think I hate finding the medallions the most.

4186
03:53:06,170 --> 03:53:08,070
They're so fucking...

4187
03:53:08,070 --> 03:53:09,130
Oh my god.

4188
03:53:09,730 --> 03:53:10,850
They're so annoying.

4189
03:53:12,750 --> 03:53:13,110
Yeah!

4190
03:53:13,890 --> 03:53:14,430
A pipe.

4191
03:53:19,280 --> 03:53:20,460
God, where do I go?

4192
03:53:22,640 --> 03:53:23,820
This way?

4193
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:24,700
Loot!

4194
03:53:25,960 --> 03:53:26,900
Love me my loot.

4195
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:28,760
Fish.

4196
03:53:30,580 --> 03:53:30,940
Oh.

4197
03:53:31,620 --> 03:53:32,300
What?

4198
03:53:32,500 --> 03:53:32,820
What?

4199
03:53:33,100 --> 03:53:34,520
Can I sell this?

4200
03:53:35,500 --> 03:53:37,320
Oh, I can eat it.

4201
03:53:37,940 --> 03:53:39,340
Oh, there it is.

4202
03:53:39,580 --> 03:53:40,180
Nice.

4203
03:53:41,420 --> 03:53:42,720
Okay, one more.

4204
03:53:44,180 --> 03:53:46,180
We need one more medallion.

4205
03:53:46,320 --> 03:53:47,780
It's like over here?

4206
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:54,680
Oh, thank God.

4207
03:53:55,660 --> 03:53:56,600
Okay, that was close.

4208
03:53:57,240 --> 03:53:58,620
That was so fucking close.

4209
03:53:58,860 --> 03:53:59,800
There's the last one.

4210
03:54:00,560 --> 03:54:02,980
It's like here somewhere.

4211
03:54:04,360 --> 03:54:04,940
Who said that?

4212
03:54:07,100 --> 03:54:07,780
What?

4213
03:54:10,840 --> 03:54:12,240
Where's the medallion?

4214
03:54:13,500 --> 03:54:14,640
Where is it?

4215
03:54:15,560 --> 03:54:17,520
Like, I'm like on it.

4216
03:54:20,970 --> 03:54:22,390
We already have three snakes.

4217
03:54:27,070 --> 03:54:27,630
Medallion?

4218
03:54:29,090 --> 03:54:30,030
Oh, is it below?

4219
03:54:30,510 --> 03:54:30,950
Oh, okay.

4220
03:54:31,670 --> 03:54:33,730
Okay, I'm gonna get that barrel first, then I'll go below.

4221
03:54:34,710 --> 03:54:35,530
Below me.

4222
03:54:36,990 --> 03:54:39,210
Not here, so it's on the other side.

4223
03:54:39,730 --> 03:54:43,150
Alright, we're gonna grab this barrel and then we'll head
over.

4224
03:54:44,830 --> 03:54:46,450
We always need... Wait, how do I get that?

4225
03:54:47,510 --> 03:54:48,330
It's important.

4226
03:54:49,910 --> 03:54:50,530
Can I make this?

4227
03:54:50,590 --> 03:54:51,690
I can make this.

4228
03:54:53,790 --> 03:54:54,230
Okay.

4229
03:54:56,750 --> 03:54:57,890
Alright, Leon.

4230
03:55:00,730 --> 03:55:01,830
Sorry, Leon.

4231
03:55:02,210 --> 03:55:07,430
Even though Leon's thighs are thick as fuck, they can't be
jumping.

4232
03:55:09,050 --> 03:55:10,930
They're not for jumping, clearly.

4233
03:55:11,630 --> 03:55:14,270
Those thighs were not meant to be doing any jumping.

4234
03:55:15,770 --> 03:55:17,030
Where do I get to the other side?

4235
03:55:17,110 --> 03:55:18,050
Oh, it's over here.

4236
03:55:19,450 --> 03:55:19,970
Oh, nice.

4237
03:55:20,090 --> 03:55:20,250
Okay.

4238
03:55:20,850 --> 03:55:21,390
Did it.

4239
03:55:21,950 --> 03:55:22,370
Yay!

4240
03:55:24,170 --> 03:55:24,990
Oh, nice.

4241
03:55:25,050 --> 03:55:26,270
Another hexagon piece.

4242
03:55:29,170 --> 03:55:31,010
Here's something on the other side that dropped.

4243
03:55:34,250 --> 03:55:35,110
There's the snake.

4244
03:55:35,210 --> 03:55:35,690
You know what?

4245
03:55:36,010 --> 03:55:36,730
Extra money.

4246
03:55:39,890 --> 03:55:40,730
That's right.

4247
03:55:41,090 --> 03:55:44,310
You didn't pay your loans, Crow.

4248
03:55:45,570 --> 03:55:46,770
That's fucking right.

4249
03:55:50,230 --> 03:55:52,290
Don't think I forgot about you.

4250
03:55:57,290 --> 03:55:58,630
Let me in!

4251
03:55:59,030 --> 03:55:59,830
Let me in!

4252
03:56:01,510 --> 03:56:03,950
I'll make sure nobody else is here.

4253
03:56:05,830 --> 03:56:06,550
Yeah, that's right.

4254
03:56:06,890 --> 03:56:08,310
Don't think I forgot.

4255
03:56:09,770 --> 03:56:10,650
Oh, another egg.

4256
03:56:11,770 --> 03:56:12,770
Oh, there's the spool.

4257
03:56:13,770 --> 03:56:14,890
This is what I'm talking about.

4258
03:56:15,050 --> 03:56:15,950
That's what we needed.

4259
03:56:18,330 --> 03:56:18,390
Okay.

4260
03:56:19,830 --> 03:56:21,310
There can only be one bird.

4261
03:56:23,570 --> 03:56:25,790
There can only be one bird in this game.

4262
03:56:27,330 --> 03:56:28,390
That's fucking right.

4263
03:56:29,330 --> 03:56:30,690
You didn't pay your rent.

4264
03:56:31,610 --> 03:56:34,270
All birds have to pay rent to dokeybird.

4265
03:56:34,870 --> 03:56:36,870
I trademarked bird.

4266
03:56:41,150 --> 03:56:42,510
That's fucking right.

4267
03:56:42,850 --> 03:56:43,130
That's right.

4268
03:56:43,230 --> 03:56:44,150
I did it.

4269
03:56:44,910 --> 03:56:46,150
I trademarked bird.

4270
03:56:46,310 --> 03:56:49,250
You all have to pay for the trademark now.

4271
03:56:50,370 --> 03:56:50,970
Let's see, craft.

4272
03:56:52,130 --> 03:56:54,150
I think I always need shotgun ammo.

4273
03:56:54,390 --> 03:56:54,930
Not gonna lie.

4274
03:56:55,930 --> 03:56:57,610
I shall craft rifle ammo.

4275
03:56:58,350 --> 03:57:01,570
And then I'll craft other stuff later.

4276
03:57:07,330 --> 03:57:10,530
Oh, whoa, whoa, I almost got baited.

4277
03:57:10,850 --> 03:57:11,310
Holy shit.

4278
03:57:12,530 --> 03:57:14,250
I almost got baited by the money.

4279
03:57:15,970 --> 03:57:17,090
The bird tax.

4280
03:57:19,430 --> 03:57:20,790
That was so close.

4281
03:57:22,190 --> 03:57:23,530
Wait, oh, I can stay on high ground.

4282
03:57:23,710 --> 03:57:24,030
That's okay.

4283
03:57:27,270 --> 03:57:28,390
I can stay on high ground.

4284
03:57:30,150 --> 03:57:31,210
That's fucking right.

4285
03:57:32,030 --> 03:57:33,310
They can't get me.

4286
03:57:34,930 --> 03:57:35,770
Where's the others?

4287
03:57:38,010 --> 03:57:38,550
Where are they?

4288
03:57:38,890 --> 03:57:40,450
Oh shit, she has a- oh fuck!

4289
03:57:41,250 --> 03:57:41,610
What?

4290
03:57:44,330 --> 03:57:45,650
Oh fuck, what the fuck?

4291
03:57:45,790 --> 03:57:46,630
Where did you come from?

4292
03:57:47,010 --> 03:57:49,650
Oh no.

4293
03:57:50,350 --> 03:57:51,650
Oh no, okay, I don't have to stab.

4294
03:57:51,790 --> 03:57:51,950
Okay.

4295
03:57:52,310 --> 03:57:53,170
What the fuck?

4296
03:57:53,350 --> 03:57:54,690
Where did she come from?

4297
03:57:54,750 --> 03:57:55,750
How did she get there?

4298
03:57:56,050 --> 03:57:56,990
That fast!

4299
03:57:59,010 --> 03:58:00,270
You kill them all?

4300
03:58:01,010 --> 03:58:01,450
Nice.

4301
03:58:03,790 --> 03:58:04,230
Nice.

4302
03:58:06,210 --> 03:58:08,010
I'm not a bird bite playing them.

4303
03:58:08,230 --> 03:58:10,870
Guess I have to pay for them since I can't.

4304
03:58:10,870 --> 03:58:11,630
Because they can't.

4305
03:58:11,630 --> 03:58:12,830
Thank you for the super channelings.

4306
03:58:13,050 --> 03:58:13,170
Thank you.

4307
03:58:13,250 --> 03:58:13,850
Thank you.

4308
03:58:15,090 --> 03:58:15,330
Ella?

4309
03:58:15,770 --> 03:58:16,810
Wait, what the fuck?

4310
03:58:16,930 --> 03:58:18,330
Where did you come from?

4311
03:58:21,270 --> 03:58:21,710
Whoops.

4312
03:58:24,730 --> 03:58:25,170
Nice.

4313
03:58:28,150 --> 03:58:28,590
Nice.

4314
03:58:29,130 --> 03:58:29,810
I need a shank you.

4315
03:58:29,870 --> 03:58:31,230
Oh, got back my ammo too.

4316
03:58:32,230 --> 03:58:34,610
Don't you love it when you get back your ammo?

4317
03:58:35,530 --> 03:58:36,250
And gunpowder.

4318
03:58:37,570 --> 03:58:38,690
That's everything.

4319
03:58:40,430 --> 03:58:40,610
Money.

4320
03:58:41,250 --> 03:58:42,030
Where's that money?

4321
03:58:43,210 --> 03:58:43,710
Where's that?

4322
03:58:46,450 --> 03:58:47,010
Nice.

4323
03:58:47,430 --> 03:58:49,110
Almost missed out on the money.

4324
03:58:52,330 --> 03:58:54,490
All these people late for the party.

4325
03:58:55,210 --> 03:58:56,730
We had a set schedule, sir.

4326
03:58:58,790 --> 03:58:59,910
Up we go.

4327
03:59:00,370 --> 03:59:01,450
Do I need a save?

4328
03:59:01,570 --> 03:59:02,850
before I fight the fish?

4329
03:59:04,170 --> 03:59:09,150
I swear to God, if I die and have to do this part all over
again, I swear to fucking God.

4330
03:59:12,970 --> 03:59:14,810
I need to know right now, guys.

4331
03:59:15,630 --> 03:59:18,210
Do I need to save before I fight this fucking fish?

4332
03:59:18,970 --> 03:59:19,390
Yes?

4333
03:59:19,510 --> 03:59:20,610
Okay, I'm going back.

4334
03:59:21,090 --> 03:59:21,670
Alright, fish.

4335
03:59:22,070 --> 03:59:22,950
Give me a sec.

4336
03:59:23,410 --> 03:59:24,690
I'm going back to the merchant.

4337
03:59:24,830 --> 03:59:25,430
I might as well.

4338
03:59:25,570 --> 03:59:27,230
I have so much stuff to sell anyway.

4339
03:59:29,670 --> 03:59:30,110
Alright.

4340
03:59:31,010 --> 03:59:31,450
Intermission.

4341
03:59:31,570 --> 03:59:31,970
time.

4342
03:59:32,830 --> 03:59:33,710
Be right back, fish.

4343
03:59:36,290 --> 03:59:37,650
Intermission time.

4344
03:59:40,590 --> 03:59:40,690
Nice.

4345
03:59:42,150 --> 03:59:42,650
Got this.

4346
03:59:43,790 --> 03:59:45,370
Can I trade for anything better now?

4347
03:59:45,490 --> 03:59:45,990
Not yet.

4348
03:59:46,470 --> 03:59:46,470
Okay.

4349
03:59:46,950 --> 03:59:47,530
Let's see.

4350
03:59:48,310 --> 03:59:49,190
Antique pipe.

4351
03:59:49,810 --> 03:59:51,130
Okay, we can sell that now.

4352
03:59:51,250 --> 03:59:52,210
We can sell these two.

4353
03:59:53,010 --> 03:59:54,510
And then we can sell our vipers.

4354
03:59:54,950 --> 03:59:56,790
Ooh, we have so much money!

4355
03:59:58,830 --> 03:59:59,510
Yay!

4356
04:00:01,650 --> 04:00:02,930
Nice work.

4357
04:00:04,370 --> 04:00:08,310
Uh, what should we do with our money right now?

4358
04:00:08,670 --> 04:00:10,490
Your weapons are in good hands.

4359
04:00:10,490 --> 04:00:14,630
The laser sight keeps your pistol at full charge all the
time.

4360
04:00:14,770 --> 04:00:16,270
Wait, that's so good.

4361
04:00:16,990 --> 04:00:17,450
I don't know.

4362
04:00:17,450 --> 04:00:18,130
They don't have it.

4363
04:00:18,330 --> 04:00:18,630
Never mind.

4364
04:00:20,090 --> 04:00:21,410
That's so good.

4365
04:00:21,710 --> 04:00:22,870
But they don't have it.

4366
04:00:25,830 --> 04:00:26,470
Fine.

4367
04:00:26,810 --> 04:00:28,250
I'll repair the knife.

4368
04:00:29,170 --> 04:00:29,810
Okay.

4369
04:00:31,990 --> 04:00:32,430
Trade.

4370
04:00:32,670 --> 04:00:33,570
Oh, it's on the trade?

4371
04:00:34,410 --> 04:00:35,590
Oh, wait, do I have enough?

4372
04:00:36,630 --> 04:00:37,410
Is it worth it?

4373
04:00:37,910 --> 04:00:38,510
Oh, it's the trade.

4374
04:00:39,550 --> 04:00:40,630
Is it worth it, guys?

4375
04:00:41,630 --> 04:00:42,290
Or should I save?

4376
04:00:43,470 --> 04:00:44,790
Do I do it or save money?

4377
04:00:48,030 --> 04:00:48,470
Yeah?

4378
04:00:48,670 --> 04:00:49,530
Okay, we're getting it.

4379
04:00:50,530 --> 04:00:50,970
Alright.

4380
04:00:50,970 --> 04:00:51,990
What should we upgrade?

4381
04:00:52,490 --> 04:00:53,790
Should we upgrade the shotgun?

4382
04:00:54,310 --> 04:00:54,670
Guys?

4383
04:00:55,630 --> 04:00:56,710
Should we upgrade the power?

4384
04:00:57,770 --> 04:01:01,290
Is it worth it?

4385
04:01:01,570 --> 04:01:03,210
between life and dead.

4386
04:01:04,970 --> 04:01:06,190
Is that worth it?

4387
04:01:06,470 --> 04:01:06,670
Nope.

4388
04:01:07,050 --> 04:01:07,990
Okay, that's one guy.

4389
04:01:08,370 --> 04:01:11,350
So I'm the one guy I'm not gonna listen to.

4390
04:01:15,810 --> 04:01:17,790
And I'll save the rest.

4391
04:01:19,550 --> 04:01:20,230
Here we go.

4392
04:01:20,810 --> 04:01:24,210
He's like he's not gonna be the only one guy.

4393
04:01:24,510 --> 04:01:25,970
I'm coming in too.

4394
04:01:26,770 --> 04:01:27,370
Alright,

4395
04:01:31,010 --> 04:01:33,050
let me and make sure I reload everything.

4396
04:01:35,490 --> 04:01:36,090
Open up.

4397
04:01:37,630 --> 04:01:38,230
Alright.

4398
04:01:39,130 --> 04:01:39,990
I should have enough.

4399
04:01:40,210 --> 04:01:41,150
Okay, let's see.

4400
04:01:42,370 --> 04:01:45,250
I'm just gonna eat this egg right now and be full HP.

4401
04:01:45,550 --> 04:01:46,810
Like, there's no point.

4402
04:01:47,010 --> 04:01:48,950
Okay, and then parts.

4403
04:01:49,490 --> 04:01:50,970
Put that on my pistol.

4404
04:01:51,810 --> 04:01:54,770
I'm gonna put my fucking kitchen knife in here.

4405
04:01:57,210 --> 04:01:59,110
Bump, bada-dump, bada-dump.

4406
04:01:59,310 --> 04:01:59,870
Bada-dump.

4407
04:02:00,110 --> 04:02:00,510
Bada-dump.

4408
04:02:01,190 --> 04:02:05,690
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

4409
04:02:05,910 --> 04:02:07,090
All right, here we go.

4410
04:02:07,710 --> 04:02:08,990
Fish time, fish time.

4411
04:02:09,950 --> 04:02:11,530
Got my fucking rifle.

4412
04:02:13,750 --> 04:02:14,270
Oh, wait.

4413
04:02:14,630 --> 04:02:15,290
I forgot the puzzle.

4414
04:02:16,370 --> 04:02:17,370
I forgot the puzzle.

4415
04:02:17,770 --> 04:02:18,050
Puzzle.

4416
04:02:21,170 --> 04:02:21,650
All right.

4417
04:02:22,170 --> 04:02:23,770
No, I'm going to keep her for food.

4418
04:02:24,290 --> 04:02:25,230
What if I need it?

4419
04:02:25,570 --> 04:02:26,810
Wait, can I do a puzzle now?

4420
04:02:28,050 --> 04:02:28,570
No?

4421
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:30,230
Oh, I need one more then.

I equipped it instantly.

Stab the water.

4430

It's so easy, Doki.

4431
04:03:36,270 --> 04:03:38,270
Just fucking shake the water.

04:03:39,790 --> 04:03:41,190
Shake the fish.

I knew it!

4451
04:04:26,330 --> 04:04:28,650
I knew we were going to shake the fish.

Leon's body is the most sacred body.

That's why he's going to continue the bloodline.

Oh, no, that's just the Holy Mary.

4536
04:10:16,140 --> 04:10:16,820
Is there a ladder?

4537
04:10:17,020 --> 04:10:17,820
No, no ladder.

4538
04:10:19,340 --> 04:10:20,220
Hello, everybody.

4539
04:10:21,760 --> 04:10:23,620
Oh, it's night time?

4540
04:10:25,660 --> 04:10:28,300
Oh, I do not like this.

4541
04:10:29,860 --> 04:10:30,580
All right, guys.

Okay.

4544
04:10:36,200 --> 04:10:40,620
I think this is a good time to call it after seeing it being
night time.

4545
04:10:42,000 --> 04:10:42,480
All right.

4546
04:10:44,360 --> 04:10:45,940

4548
04:10:47,760 --> 04:10:49,840
No, this is a good time to call it there.

4549
04:10:50,080 --> 04:10:51,240
We did four hours.

4550
04:10:51,760 --> 04:10:53,120
We got a boss fight.

4551
04:10:53,260 --> 04:10:53,660

4552
04:10:53,660 --> 04:10:55,800

4553
04:10:56,860 --> 04:10:57,860

4554
04:10:57,940 --> 04:11:00,980

I think we're...

4559
04:11:08,820 --> 04:11:11,440

04:11:14,360 --> 04:11:16,800

it's great to play resident evil 4 again playing the remake

4566
04:11:29,520 --> 04:11:37,960
for the first time um definitely enjoyed it a lot so far i
didn't enjoy the game so far like the controls are less you

4567
04:11:37,960 --> 04:11:48,400
know since it's a newer game the controls are definitely
less scuffed it's it's definitely easier to control compared

4568
04:11:48,400 --> 04:11:53,520
to the og at resident evil 4 so That's what I like the most.
