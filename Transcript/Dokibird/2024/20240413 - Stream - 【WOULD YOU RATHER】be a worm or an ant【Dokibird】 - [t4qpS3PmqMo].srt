42
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:53,510
thought I was just unmarketable like I legitimately thought
I legitimately thought I was just you know I say my mind too

43
00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:02,990
much or like I'm just unmarketable I'm not cute enough or
like I'm not the cute anime girl that like that fits the

44
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,850
mold or like I thought I was like just unmarketable and like
I was like oh I didn't try hard enough but like it's

45
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:19,070
actually crazy but there's been so many like sponsors and so
many like conventions that have like reached out to me and

46
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:28,590
was like we've always wanted to work with you and like and
i'm like really me i thought i thought i was just

47
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:37,410
unmarketable i did like we've always wanted to work with you
doki and like it's crazy there were so many there are so

48
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:48,230
many and i was me i was so surprised conventions i was like
wait what really you want to be to be there i'm like and

49
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:54,250
then like okay because so like they need you need to charge
like we charge when you're doing appearance fees we charge

50
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,390

gonna survive like

52
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:18,890
so like um they're like how much is your appearance fees for
like conventions and i was like oh it's this much is it too

53
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:28,330
expensive i hope it's enough like i was like i hope it's not
too expensive i was told by my i was told by my manager that

54
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:36,570
this is like that should be like the general range for
appearance fees and then and then like one of my friends

55
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:45,590
who's um who's one of my friends who stuff, she was like
telling me, she was scolding me and was like, your PSVs are

56
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,710
too cheap.

57
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,910
And then I was like, I don't know

58
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,070

59
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,670

60
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,050
And then my friend was like, you're too cheap.

61
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,730
What the fuck?

62
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,390
Like, you need to charge more for your PSVs.

63
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,150
They all want you right now.

64
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,170
You need to charge more.

65
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,270
You're way too cheap.

66
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,930
And I'm like, I, I don't know.

67
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:28,010
I was like I just I just want to I just wanted to go to
conventions and like meet dragons I don't know what my price

68
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:41,930
is so yeah I'm like every day every day I'm like oh no don't
worry I'm it's US dollars because I was like bro the US

69
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:50,810
dollar right now is so fucking good at the moment compared
to like any other country i saw this thing it was so sad i

70
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,790
was like so sad because like i don't know you guys saw the
twitter post but i don't remember which japanese twitter was

71
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,150
but there was like a japanese twitter that was like trying
to be like it was that was like oh please please buy our

72
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:08,950
stuff like on twitter because apparently the yen is so bad
right now that they're trying to get like americans to like

73
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:15,610
buy stuff in their store because of how bad the yen was
because it's crashing apparently and they're like they're

74
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:22,630
like please uh please use the us dollar right now it's like
because it's just a lot us dollars like really really good

75
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:29,630
at the moment and so they're like asking people in the
states to order stuff in japan just because of how bad the

76
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,710
yen is yeah it's actually crazy so that's why like when
they're like do you want to want us to pay the appearance be

77
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,850
in US dollars or Canadian dollars I would like US

78
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:53,150
I'm just like US dollars please no matter what US dollar
because I have a US bank like one of my bank accounts

79
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:59,990
accepts US dollars because I have separate US and Canadian
so like I'm like if the Canadian dollar crashes at least

80
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,490
like you know I can just convert my US dollars to Canadian

81
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:15,750
because even you know even the canadian dollar is pretty
fucking garbage right now so i'm just like yeah i would a u

82
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,470
.s please

83
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:27,690
no betty thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i
kick violently in my sleep i injured my cousin once i get my

84
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:35,310
own bed now right i scream in my sleep thank you for the
super chat thank you thank you um but yeah that's why like

85
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:42,930
oh, my calendar is getting more and more packed every day
because like I've been getting a lot of like offers to do

86
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,970
like conventions or like events and stuff like that.

87
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,490
And I'm like, yes, yes, yes.

88
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,490
I was like, it was like, oh my God, I did like check my
calendar.

89
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,090
I was like, do I have an event?

90
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,250
I was like, oh my God, does this overlap with this other
event that I'm doing across the world?

91
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,350
Because obviously it's all like virtual.

92
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,910
So I'm like, okay, we're good.

93
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,610
And I'll is the day this is going to be the date before the
other convention so i can do both technically and i'll be

94
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:21,650
like yes um the reason why i'm taking a lot is because i
never had the opportunity and i don't know if obviously you

95
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,830
know i don't know if the next year i'll be i'll have the
same chances again i'll have the same chance i'll have the

96
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:34,090
same opportunity to be able to do a lot of these conventions
to have like so many fans from around the world uh

97
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,230
supporting me and so like i don't know next year obviously
you know next year i don't know what i'm gonna my popularity

98
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:48,430
is gonna be like next year you know i don't know if like you
know people uh if like i'll have the same opportunity um as

99
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:55,930
i do this year so that's why i'm just trying to like take as
many chance opportunities as i can before you know before

100
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:04,070
we'll see what next year is gonna be next year doki is gonna
be so uh so that's why i'm trying to take as many chances to

101
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,710
meet as many dragoons around the world as possible um uh and
like just to have these opportunities because you know they

102
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,850
still need to be able to you know sell the tickets and like
be able to you know have enough people for the venue so i'm

103
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:23,330
like oh my god what if next year i don't have enough
dragoons to fill up this venue oh and then they'll be like

104
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:32,290
sorry doki we can't get you because you can't fill up this
venue so i'm like okay i gotta do it now i gotta i gotta use

105
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,130
the Because maybe, now I have enough dragoons now.

106
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,690
So, I will always have imposter syndrome.

107
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,330
I know.

108
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,610
I'll never change.

109
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,070
I'll always have imposter syndrome.

110
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,390
So, I'm so scared.

111
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,650
I'm so scared.

112
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,310
Anyway.

113
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,570

gonna have to use a code word so like it was going okay Like
it was it was going okay.

145
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:50,050
I received some really cute plushies and stuff like in like
Um artwork but then oh I opened one package and when I

146
00:16:50,050 --> 00:17:00,170
opened it up It was like I'm gonna use a code word because I
don't want to get in trouble So when I opened it up, it was

147
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:07,710
like a bag of grass and I was freaking out because I've
never seen that before.

148
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:15,090
I've never seen like I've never like seen it before like
like ever because I you know I

149
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:27,850
I don't like that was freaking out because I was like what
the fuck What?

150
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,370
I was like, did my address, my PO box get leaked?

151
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,710
I was freaking out.

152
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,710
I was like, oh my god, did my, who sent this?

153
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,550
Did my PO box get leaked?

154
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,590
Like, why is there, why is the bag of grass heat?

155
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,750
I was like, oh my god.

156
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,850
I was fucking freaking out because I was like, wow, I was
like, what is it?

157
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:10,410
And then, and then we saw the, we looked at the package, and
then apparently someone else used to rent this PO box, but

158
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,390
they didn't change the address.

159
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,930
So, so it got, so it got delivered to me because it's my PO
box now.

160
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:27,130
But I, I was so scared because I legitimately thought that
someone actually sent me a, I don't know.

161
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:37,650
that someone leaked my ad my PO box address and then sent it
to me because I don't fucking know and I was like oh my god

162
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:45,950
and then my mom was like laughing at me because like it was
just so ridiculous it was so fucking ridiculous I was I was

163
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,010
just like holy fuck I was like oh my god am I going to go to
jail

164
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:05,490
um so so that that happened to me like a couple of days ago
i didn't want to tell the story i didn't want to tell this

165
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:15,710
story on like the collab because i was like oh no that's
gonna be too awkward that's gonna be so awkward um um but

166
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:25,950
yeah that i literally i literally thought someone leaked my
address i was freaking out and anyway um but yes anyway for

167
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,890
the i buy power the Hyatt custom PC.

168
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:36,810
It's been in the works for like a while now regarding like
the custom PC itself.

169
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,290
By the way, this is like a custom, one of a kind PC made
just for me.

170
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:56,430
And, but, but like I said on the tweet, look forward to
future special announcements that may or may not be related

171
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,990
To, like, a PC.

172
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,170
So, if you're thinking, oh, man.

173
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:13,330
Should I save my money for, I don't know, something related
to, like, I don't know, PC stuff?

174
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,350
I don't know.

175
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,670
Maybe.

176
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,190
It might be.

177
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,450
Might be a hard...

178
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:24,850
Maybe.

179
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,230
I don't know.

180
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,050
I'll confirm or deny anything at the moment.

181
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,210

play the first three gears of wars uh as a little as a

210
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:45,670
little dokey so i really wanted to experience it myself i
heard the new fallout show was really good uh i was like

211
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:52,950
reading i was planning on watching the new fallout show

sorry uh jimbo's done it again uh but he like recommended on
he recommended on twitter every time he recommends stuff on

213
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,390
twitter he's i don't know it's usually been like pretty
accurate and like when he doesn't like something when he

214
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,130
doesn't like a show he'll just be like i watch this show but
if he does like it he'll just be like oh my god it was

215
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:25,730
pretty good i just love like his reviews because it's so
obvious when he doesn't like anything he just be like i

216
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:37,610
watch it and but then if it's something he enjoyed he'd be
like oh my god it's so good like the actress was pretty

pure cinema thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

219
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:04,690
uh but yes anyway as i guess i just realized we did like a
fucking 23 minute like catch up zatsu without actually doing

220
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,730
the game uh but for those who don't know this game is called
would you rather and basically it's like will you press the

221
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:18,150
button it's like all the uh these are like basically like
stream games type deal because they were super popular back

222
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:25,490
in the day like back with like let's players so like will
you press the button uh would you rather uh what's the other

223
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:34,730
one ask the genie guy i forgot his name i and then it was a
higher or lower stuff like that anyway i was i realized oh

224
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:44,690
my god i can finally do would you rather uh and so basically
they gave us two choices uh would you rather and then you

225
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:52,850
when you pick a choice you get to see who is like the
majority pick like oh which side of people uh want to pick

226
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,510
and stuff like that so you know if you're like the majority
you're like the you're like a sheep or like you know you you

227
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:04,090
have your own way of thinking you think outside the box and
everything so it's like basically like the walking dead shit

228
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,230
so you know there'll be like your choices oh here are the
people who made the same choice as you stuff like that but

229
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:22,130
and yet but this one's more like would you rather um anyway
so would you rather scream loudly while for the first 30

230
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:30,990
minutes after waking up i would honestly choose scream
loudly while you're asleep because i feel like you know how

231
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,730
like there's like those like uh like those like sleep
deprivation tanks what's this like no sensory deprivation

232
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:43,290
sorry not sleep deprivation sensory um those like sensory
deprivation tanks and then when you go into like those

233
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:50,170
sensory tanks you like fucking like go insane you can the
longer you spend in there the the more insane you get

234
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:59,850
because when you have your senses like you turn crazy or
something so i feel like if this happens to me every day i

235
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:08,550
think i go crazy i i feel like like 30 minutes of just
nothingness by myself i feel like i just go insane in

236
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:18,800
general and i feel everything i don't want to feel stuff
better i feel like because then like you can't hear or see

237
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,540
right but that doesn't stop your fucking inner demon demons
or your imagination so i feel like your inner demons and

238
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:33,920
your imagination would go fucking wild because you know for
the first 30 minutes because you're trying to like invent

239
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:40,460
something in your head especially if you have like a super
active imagination and stuff so i'm just like that doesn't

240
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,400
sound fun and i don't want to like feel something more
intensely too because like you know what you can't what's

241
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:58,580
that thing where you can't see or like hear your other
senses start improving more and I don't like that my my

242
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:08,100
other senses don't need to improve anymore I don't want to
feel stuff more I'm okay I'm okay with the current amount of

243
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:19,320
feeling so so so I rather I just cuz like screaming loudly
while you're asleep.

244
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,220
It just happens when you're asleep.

245
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,920
So, like, it only affects other people.

246
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,280
It affects my neighbor.

247
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,620
That's fine.

248
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,860
Fuck my neighbors.

249
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,280
Like, who cares about what they think?

250
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,620
Call me.

251
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,420
Thank you for the super chat.

252
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:32,720
Thank you.

253
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,220
Thank you.

254
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,700
Scream loudly while sleeping because I'm not the one
being... Yeah, exactly.

255
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,980
It's not affecting me.

256
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,820
Like, who cares about...

257
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,240
It's not affecting me.

258
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm going to need I may be okay someone made a good point it
will affect my throat but like what if like but what if like

259
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:11,140
you know I I just like tape my mouth shut so be like
silently screaming so um like is less work than ah so in the

260
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,800
end in the end it wouldn't I'll just I'll just drink a lot
of

261
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,500
Okay, maybe I'll sleep.

262
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,260
I'll do like, you know, maybe I'll do like, like what are
those like intense naps?

263
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,660
Like there's like a sleep cycle where you only sleep like
every certain interval.

264
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,160
So if I sleep, if I change my sleep schedule in a way where
I only sleep like particular intervals, like REM sleep,

265
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,100
what's like power naps and stuff like that, the REM cycle,
then I'll be fine.

266
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,260
That'll be fine.

267
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:02,340
productive some people say it you think it's not healthy but
then but you don't you think it's not healthy but how would

268
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:09,420
you know that have you ever tried yeah check me don't try
this by the way don't sleep in normal sleep schedule only if

269
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:19,060
you have scream loudly while you're asleep anyway anyway I
think scream loudly while you're asleep is the way to go oh

270
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:37,120
well those people don't know what they're talking about
they're fucking sheep nice they're just sheep they don't

271
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:47,080
they're not cultured enough they're not smart enough that 39
I don't know was it 31 that 31% is like those it's like you

272
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:59,260
know how they're like you need to be smart up to understand
brick and morning it's like being the one percent chat I was

273
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:12,720
being the one percent guys because I know what I'm talking
about all right be able to explore the universe or be able

274
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,020
to explore the unknown of the earth.

275
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,540
Okay, I'm not even gonna make a poll.

276
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,680
I was gonna make a poll, but like, I don't even have to
debate.

277
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,000
I'll be the universe.

278
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,940
Because usually, the explore the unknowns of the earth is
just like primitive stuff.

279
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,320
Like, you know, just be like, here's a forest.

280
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,420
Like, here's the forest that's never been explored before.

281
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,940
I don't care.

282
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,520
Like, you know what lives in the forest?

283
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,020
Fucking insects and bugs.

284
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,980
You know what lives in the fucking universe?

285
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,860
Like, We don't know about this in the universe.

286
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,000
There could be aliens.

287
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,160
To be fair, we're going to be the aliens if we're exploring
the universe.

288
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,340
But like, one is obvious the choice.

289
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,220
Like, what kind of question is that?

290
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,680
Like, 39%?

291
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,700
Like, oh my god.

292
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,900
Those guys are stupid.

293
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,880
Now, those guys are definitely stupid.

294
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,960
Be stranded in the jungle or be stranded.

295
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,600
Oh my god.

296
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,900
Okay.

297
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,340
I don't even need to make a pull out of this either.

298
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,300
Of course, the jungle.

299
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,560
The desert has no water.

300
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,520
The jungle?

301
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,200
I can charge.

302
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:20,140
a coconut like there's more chances to die in the desert
from dehydration and hunger than there is to the jungle and

303
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,720
also sunburn dude fuck the sun uh but don't fuck the sun uh

304
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:38,240
exactly the desert has nothing the junk yes the jungle has
wild animals that i can kill and then eat guys the animals

305
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:48,620
in the jungle are food so easy oh what about the poisonous
frogs what about the poisonous scorpions and snakes snakes

306
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:59,320
exist in both like what the fuck do you mean there's snakes
in the desert too you can't avoid them they're everywhere

307
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:07,560
kaz yeah but there's always water in your sand like you said
right it's all one big beach eventually but i don't have a

308
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:17,380
horse to find the water kaz look So that's why I'm saying
like there's already scorpions and snakes in the desert and

309
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:28,860
also the jungle At least the jungle has like animals I can
eat and also water I can drink easily Lots of predators.

310
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,140
There's lots of predators in the desert too.

311
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,620
You just don't there's a lot of predators in the desert too
It's just that they wait for you to die and eat you instead

312
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:50,300
because it's just easier you die by the jungle like you die
by the by the whole ecosystem of the desert first before any

313
00:31:50,300 --> 00:32:01,320
predators fucking comes in to eat you like all right i bet
you i'm the majority here i swear see look you're the 16 and

314
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:09,100
that's not the special like lower percent like i was in the
beginning that was the that was the you are wrong percentage

315
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,140
all right spend your entire okay this what I'll make a pull.

316
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
I'll make a pull for this.

317
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,120
She's right, guys.

318
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,800
Exactly!

319
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,900
Of course I'm right.

320
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,440
Summer at beach versus summer in mountains.

321
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,080
Oh my god, no, fuck the beach.

322
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,980
There's no way I'm gonna choose the beach.

323
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,220
The beach fucking sucks.

324
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,020
Dark Blade, thank you for the super chat.

325
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,840
Thank you, thank you.

326
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,220
Okay, here's why.

327
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:47,240
Here's the reason why the beach okay but like what is the
scope of the mountains though like how tall is the mountain

328
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,180
is it like is it so tall that i can't breathe like i need
like an oxygen tank to breathe like or is it like it's like

329
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:01,300
mount everyone's type type of mountain or is it just a
regular mountain like a hill is a hill a mountain or is hill

330
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:10,040
like a baby mountain anyway no fuck the beach no matter what
i don't like beaches i hate the i hate the sand i hate sand

331
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:19,880
and then i the ocean because the ocean is just like nature's
bathroom and like the you know like the sewers eventually

332
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:30,140
lead to the ocean you guys know that right the sewer the
sewers sewages eventually leads to the ocean and like if you

333
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:41,200
think about it the ocean is not just filled with just the
natures it's not just a nature's toilet it's everybody's

334
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:49,880
toilet it's everywhere and that is why i would never pick
the beach that's why like ever since like the realization of

335
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,900
me um ever since like the real oh yeah and microplastics by
the way ever since the realization when i was like younger

336
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:05,600
that i was like wait fishes poop and pee in the ocean i've
never been to the like i've never like touched the ocean

337
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,440
water since

338
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,640
because like you can't be like oh I'll just like I'll just
close my mouth and not breathe the like not like have the

339
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,900
water in my the water is going to be in your body no matter
what like

340
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:30,340
the the water is gonna be you're gonna taste the water no
matter what and ever since then I just Don't want to touch

341
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:37,600
the ocean ever since that part Fletch top thank you for the
super chat.

342
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:37,900
Thank you.

343
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,620
Thank you.

344
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,380
Sudoku, you rather go hiking?

345
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,140
Remember the last time you went hiking?

346
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,040
Thank you for the super chat.

347
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,320
Thank you.

348
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,660
Thank you.

349
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,220
Okay, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be hiking in the
mountains.

350
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,940
What if it's a fucking city on the mountain?

351
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,400
You don't know that.

352
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,860
It never said anything regarding hiking.

353
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,740
There could be literally an apartment built onto this
mountain.

354
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,820
And I just never go outside.

355
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,220
Like, you heard of, like, cabin in the woods.

356
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
This could be, like, apartment on the mountain.

357
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,140
Like, it could have been a cool-ass resort.

358
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,560
You don't know that.

359
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,980
Same for the beach.

360
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,540
Yes, but the beach still has the fucking sand and the ocean.

361
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,080
The mountains doesn't have sand.

362
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,120
Um.

363
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,460
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

364
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:25,760
Thank you.

365
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,380
Thank you.

366
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,040
The ocean salty because of the baby salt.

367
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,200
Fish me, no!

368
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,300
Oh my god, no!

369
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,880
You know what's in the ocean?

370
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
Trash island!

371
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,520
You all remember trash island?

372
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
That's in the ocean!

373
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,620
There's not just one trash island!

374
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,160
There's several trash islands!

375
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,700
You know what's not on the mountains?

376
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,000
Trash island!

377
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,060
There, checkmate.

378
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,580
Chin, I feel like any physical activity Dokeywood.

379
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,220
That is not true.

380
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,280
I am a very good hiker.

381
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,360
I just choose not to hike because it's a terrible
experience.

382
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,620
Thank you for the super chat.

383
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,080
Thank you.

384
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:09,800
Thank you.

385
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,800
Anyway, so yes, I am going to choose spend the entire summer
in the mountains.

386
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,260
People who choose a beach are not aware about the ocean's
toilet.

387
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,880
Or, sorry, nature's toilet.

388
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,820
Okay, you guys are fucking idiots.

389
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,360
God!

390
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,320
Oh!

391
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,620
I'm so...

392
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:42,190
I don't feel comfortable answering this question.

393
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,130
Okay.

394
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,750
Sorry, I did not feel comfortable debating this.

395
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:22,310
okay um all right cowardless bro stop being a coward it's
god it's god ethics everyone has everyone has a code of

396
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,410
ethics that was my line

397
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:48,810
that was my line okay um okay okay burnt food versus bite
tongue i would honestly say uh i would vote oh my gosh but

398
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:54,390
how hard would you bite your tongue because it's never you
just got your tongue's gonna get like scarred up and shit

399
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:01,830
and yeah they both okay like i don't is it true that eating
burnt food gives you cancer because that's what my mom would

400
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:10,810
always tell me i i don't know if it's like one of those like
what like those like mom stories you know mom lies and stuff

401
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:20,950
so like i can't tell if it's like mom lies uh but yes like
i've ever because like i always like burned food okay but

402
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:27,690
like not okay not like oh i'll always eat burnt food but
like i always like the the crunch of burnt food so like you

403
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:33,210
know like the burnt crust and stuff like not like super
burnt crust but like you know a little bit of burnt stuff

404
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:39,230
like and then like of the crunch and then my mom will always
be like don't eat burnt food you're gonna get cancer so then

405
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:48,730
so i don't know but then there's like a lot of like those
mom lies um the mom lies that like they say it because like

406
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:54,330
a lot of moms would say it because like you know parents
love to do scare tactics for children to not do the things

407
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:00,910
they want to do so they'll be like don't eat this or you're
gonna get cancer don't eat that or you're gonna get cancer

408
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:11,030
don't do this or you're gonna get cancer like um it's always
um it's always something related to cancer uh because

409
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:17,930
another thing the mom lies you know like oh don't put your
phone too near your near your head you're gonna get cancer

410
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:23,050
from the radiation you know the radiation rays from the
fucking phone

411
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:37,750
so so like uh yeah the 5g's are gonna get you're gonna cause
cancer in your brain um and stuff you put your phone if you

412
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:46,370
like if you you like fall asleep with the phone in your bed
so i don't know if that's true also because i'm fucked out

413
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,710
of way because you know i go to you know i fucking play with
my phone when I sleep so

414
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:09,550
um so I don't know actually but I still do it so well we'll
see how lucky I am uh okay anyway but like how burnt is that

415
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:19,090
food though um and I feel like biting your tongue is like
not great because like it's not a great experience and And,

416
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:25,450
uh, and like, you know, biting your tongue is never, and
like, you know, having that fucking, uh, you know, like when

417
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:33,150
you, that, the tongue starts getting swollen at the part
where it, you bit and stuff, it's not really nice

418
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,070
experience.

419
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:43,630
Um, and it's every time you eat, it's every day, your
fucking tongue is gonna get so scarred up and, like, beefed

420
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,490
out, because, like, you know, it's gonna be, like, resilient
to more bites.

421
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,070
Exactly.

422
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,010
Someone was like, Kira was like, thank you, thank you, thank
you.

423
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,630
I was like, you'll get an infection.

424
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,290
So at that point, I won't die from cancer.

425
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,990
I'll just die from, like, infections.

426
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,690
I mean, they're both terrible.

427
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,390
I won't die from the burn food that caused cancer.

428
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,610
I'll just die from a fucking infection.

429
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:13,530
Because eventually, my odds are not with me at that point,
because it's every time I eat.

430
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,990
So, like, an infection will get there somehow.

431
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,030
What if I want to eat, like, Like, I don't know.

432
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,370
What if I want to eat something that's a little raw?

433
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,810
Like, that's gonna fucking suck.

434
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,270
So I'm gonna go with burnt food.

435
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,790
Because I don't know how burnt it is.

436
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,090
Um.

437
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,690
And my mod said it doesn't cause cancer.

438
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,470
Clearly my moderator knows what's up.

439
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,610
So I'm gonna.

440
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,670
I'm gonna go with burnt food.

00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,050
There's one, there has to be a food that, like, bypasses the
burnt laws.

453
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,550
Okay, sing versus dance.

454
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,310
Oh, 100% sing.

455
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,750
Like, you can make more money singing than dancing.

456
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,030
I am so sorry.

457
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:25,370
I feel like, I feel like, like profit-wise, and like, um,
and just like, in general, singing is just the easiest way.

458
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,530
Like, I can make a million fucking covers in original songs.

459
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,270
Like, albums and stuff.

460
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:36,850
People will, more people will buy albums and songs than
fucking dance videos and stuff.

461
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:44,070
Like, a singer can, can, don't have to be a dancer, but a
dancer, if they want to be, like, a famous dancer, They'll

462
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:50,730
have to also sort of be a singer because like, you know,
there's like lots of dance covers like or be in a dance

463
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:57,950
group I feel like the only way you can sort of be famous as
a dancer is if you're like in a dance group or you're just a

464
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:06,310
coach of a famous singer Like because you know singers need
to hire dance coaches So I feel like the only way that you

465
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:13,670
can like make money as a dancer It's just to be like a dance
coach of some like someone famous or like be on a reality TV

466
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:20,190
show show for dancers like so you think you can dance do you
remember so you think you can dance that and more with the

467
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:28,710
celebrities and stuff and then what's her name that mom that
had eight kids uh what was it six kids the six tuplets um

468
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:37,290

you can dance does that still exist in any way i remember

469
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:44,210

where it was just oh my god what was it was it like like a

470
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:52,170
weeb version of so you think you can dance oh my god i'm
trying to remember there was like there was a viral clip

471
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:59,510

made a reference to like anime culture like don't remember

little bit yeah yeah and you're like i can't remember what

473
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:15,680
thing you were referencing though i don't think it was an
american version it was like some other fucking country it

474
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:28,040
um honestly i think reality tv show is dying though uh there
hasn't been like actual good reality tv in a long ass time

475
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:41,040
uh because like ethically it's like you know because people
realize people realize now that like watching these things

476
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:54,340
on reality tv is not and ethically it was never good if you
think of because people were like wait a minute is it there

477
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:02,700
people are like oh my god is it really bad to like uh watch
these little children do beauty contests and then show the

478
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:12,520
world how fucked up the uh like how fucked up kids pageants
are but like but like frame it as a good thing because i

dokey i watched like diamond tiaras a lot and i didn't

480
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:36,280

481
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:45,980
yeah sorry toddlers and tiaras toddlers and tiaras um
because for those who've never watched toddlers Basically,

482
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,140
like, a reality TV show following around, like, real people,
by the way.

483
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,800
They're not, like, celebrities or anything.

484
00:46:52,220 --> 00:47:00,080
They're real people, real children, um, who do, like, beauty
pageants, like, kids, doing beauty pageants.

485
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,600
And then they talk about, like, you know, the stuff they
have to do, the sacrifices they have to make.

486
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,800
The parents who feed them a lot of sugar.

487
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,620
Like, those, like, pixie sticks, where it's just sugar.

488
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,440
And then they'll be, like, oh.

489
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,600
Oh, you're tired?

490
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,300
You're like, oh my God, my daughter's tired.

491
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,600
Don't worry.

492
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,380
Here's three sticks of pixie sticks so you can stay awake
for the rest of the patch.

493
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,560
And it's so bad.

494
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:47,860
And then, um, and then also, you know, like, and then also,
like, you know, if they don't win, the child would be like,

495
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,240
am I ugly?

496
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:58,300
And then, you know, like, oh my god, wow, the children are
gonna think they're like fucking ugly their entire, like the

497
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,820
rest of their life because they didn't win this pageant and
because it's a beauty pageant.

498
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,920
And it was so, it's so bad.

499
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:14,920
But I was just like, oh, she did, like, you know, Lil Doki
would just be like, oh she didn't work hard enough to win

500
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:22,420
there was just someone that was just better and then now i'm
like oh my god this is so fucked up so these little kids are

501
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:31,760
gonna these little kids grew up to be so fucked up like with
like their own perception of like who they are as a person

502
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,940
and because they didn't because of beauty pageants um i want
to know what happened to these traumatized kids that is so

503
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:48,100
easy to look look for just look at honey boo boo um oh my
god like i think like because of what happened with the

504
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:55,860
whole honey boo boo shit because like i know like their
parents got divorced and stuff right after um because like

505
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:03,400

thing and like you know the mom was like this made us famous

506
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,520
what are you talking about uh yeah the kids

507
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:19,320
after that um and then like honey boo apparently was like

508
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:29,640
interview being like oh yeah like oh i got like super
depressed and stuff um and yeah it's actually so fucked up

509
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,860
anyway we realize now that reality tv

510
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:50,280
was actually pretty messed up it was entertaining but then
it got it was like it was entertaining like in like you know

511
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:58,520
if you don't look past it but then when you think about what
the fuck is going on we're like whoa you know maybe this is

512
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:05,500
pretty fucked up maybe maybe the shit was pretty

513
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:21,160
um um and then what else what else oh yeah and there was
also like uh oh my gosh i think like have you guys ever read

514
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:30,440
that article when you know the pandemic started and then the
people in big brother had to had to like stop filming and

515
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:38,700
they had to let them go like they had to stop filming and
then the contestants on big brother was like just found out

516
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:48,000
everything that was going on regarding the pandemic like at
once so fucked up so everyone's like what the fuck you're

517
00:50:48,000 --> 00:51:00,800
talking about dokey so big brother um big brother is a
reality tv show where they grab a bunch of contestants they

518
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,860
could be like you know internet famous people or
semi-reality stars um and everything or like they'll just be

519
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:17,740
regular people and then they locked them in a they locked
them in a house in a mansion and then they don't let them

520
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:27,800
see anything on the internet like no news on tv nothing like
no media like they're just locked like actual quarantine but

521
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:36,240
before the quarantine existed so it was basically like big
brother had a quarantine but there was no pandemic but then

522
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,040
You know, the pandemic happened.

523
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,400
And then, but the people in Big Brother didn't know what the
fuck was going on.

524
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,200
They did not know.

525
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,600
They didn't know what was going on in the outside world.

526
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,820
They had zero idea what the fuck was happening.

527
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:08,920
And then they were like, and then obviously they couldn't
continue filming because you know the production people need

528
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,680
to be quarantined you know they're like we can't keep doing
this like the production people are like we can't keep doing

529
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,860
this like you know they have to like maintain the house as
well you know like the like they have to like take out the

530
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:27,220
trash and everything but the production people are like we
don't say feel safe keep doing this any longer we need to

531
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:34,320
tell them we we need to tell them that the world is going is
exploding right now

532
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:46,480
and and then but yeah like they had to let them they had to
like give them a reality check and while it was while the

533
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:57,540
pandemic started getting really bad i was like bro that must
have been fucking terrible holy shit that was been so like

534
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:08,040
they're like oh i can't wait for big brother i can't wait
after big brother when like i get to go home family and not

535
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:16,380
have to worry about the toilet paper shortage and so yeah so
then there and then there's like a clip of there was a clip

536
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:23,920
of stuff of like giving them the news and stuff about like
being like yeah um while you were being filmed in big

537
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:35,400
brother some shit was going on in the outside world and then
the contestants were just shocked they were like this is

538
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:45,560
this of the show like they were just like the contestants
were just like is this um is this part of the show are we

539
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:59,120
are we really like no that can't be real that can't be real
so they went from one quarantine to another quarantine right

540
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:10,400
after it's like is this a bit like oh my god it was so
Anyway, I don't know how I got to reality TV talking about

541
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,080
singing and dance.

542
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,660
Oh, yeah, dancing with the stars.

543
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:19,380
But, yeah, anyway, I would choose singing because I feel
like I could do more with the singing than I can with the

544
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,180
dancing if I had to choose one or the other.

545
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,700
Actual, yes, they're acting, right?

546
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,040
Yeah, acting.

547
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,220
Ooh.

548
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,880
Yeah, I figured.

549
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,600
I figured.

550
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,020
Name a famous dancer.

551
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,240
Name five famous dancers.

552
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:44,020
on the top of your head I bet you can't I bet you can name
like one or two but I bet you can't name five and they're

553
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:51,000
like only dancers not like singing dancers it's just dancers
all right pants I thank you for that they get the shins

554
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,640
thank you thank me no you can't say Michael Jackson because
that's a singer and dancer you can't say that it has to be

555
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:06,740
like dancers like they're they're famous because of dancing
not because of singing you can't say Michael Jackson was

556
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,020
famous in the Jackson 5 and he was like a singer in Jackson
5.

557
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,380
It's not because of like the dancing back then.

558
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,720
But I can name five famous singers on the top of my head.

559
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,920
Always have the best hair.

560
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,560
Always have the best neither.

561
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:27,960
I don't fucking... Actually best outfit.

562
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,400
No.

563
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,580
Okay.

564
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:42,300
I'm thinking like design wise I think like okay design wise
I feel like outfit matters more than hair I think because

565
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:50,780
you can have a generic hair style but if you have a really
good outfit to match a lot it's memorable so I would say

566
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:59,940
best outfit because I feel like best also it's more comfy
too like the better the outfit the more comfy it is as well

567
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,020
So I'd rather go with...

568
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,620
I'm not even going to do a poll for this because I want to
skip this question.

569
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,680
I will do best outfit.

570
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,020
What did I get for best outfit?

571
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,620
Oh yeah, nice 60%.

572
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,980
I knew I was the majority.

573
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:11,800
Alright.

574
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,060
Make 350k a year robbing innocent people.

575
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,320
Make 40k a year helping people in...

576
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:18,560
No.

577
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,280
How innocent are they?

578
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,240
They can't be full on innocent.

579
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,420
Come on.

580
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,760
Okay, 350k versus 40k.

581
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,960
I'd be like, But Doki, what about the content?

582
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,480
This is the content.

583
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,860
Look, look.

584
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,220
It can be sort of like Robin Hood, you know?

585
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,640
I robbed from the rich to give to the poor.

586
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,380
I'm the one that's, you know, the more, sorry, not poor.

587
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,900
Rob from the rich to give to the less fortunate.

588
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,820
I am the less fortunate.

589
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,040
I am Lord Kurosus.

The outfit.

594
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,540
You can be bald and a good suit still looks great.

595
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,060
Totally not expecting from experience.

596
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,820
Thank you for the super chat.

597
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:18,980
Thank you.

598
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,180
Exactly.

599
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,180
That's actually what I thought.

600

some billionaires out there That are definitely not innocent
Zach, thank you for the super chat Thank you, thank you We

614
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:47,300
all know Guys, we all know There were a lot of billionaires
out there That might have got that billions of dollars Via

615
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:57,800
unethical means There's no way you can make a billion
dollars Doing stuff the right way Yeah No, don't say that no

616
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,360
billionaires.

617
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,420
Don't say that other than the fact that Bill Gates sort of
cheated, but like don't

618
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:13,620
Why did Bill Gates divorce with his fucking wife for after
being married for so fucking long a lot of people forgot the

619
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:19,720
reason why they divorced was because Bill Gates cheated on
his wife Like I feel like a lot of people forgot about that

620
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:30,380
Like it would be like oh, but Bill Gates but But Bill Gates,
he's just like a lovable grandpa.

621
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,700
Like, he's just, he's just like a lovable grandpa.

622
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:45,380
But then, like, uh, but then people forgot the reason why
he, you know, isn't married to his wife anymore.

623
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,900
Who's, who he's been together with for, for decades.

624
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,100
People never forgot about that.

625
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,100
So I was like, I didn't even know he was.

626
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:09,400
married yeah yeah he was he was married also what's his name
amazon guy also the uh amazon guy as well you know like his

627
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:18,460
wife basically like supported him uh his wife basically
supported him to start amazon so like jeff bezos i can't

628
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:26,200
believe forgot his name mr bezos but basically like when
jeff Bezos um was like you know oh I started I started

629
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:35,080
Amazon off of my garage I quit my job and started this
passion project of the fucking garage thing uh people forgot

630
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:50,520
that like the part of the story that people don't remember
is that his wife had a high paying job his wife was like had

631
01:00:50,520 --> 01:01:00,300
a high and basically supported him when he was when he was
doing the Amazon thing out of the garage so it's not because

632
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:07,640
of like the whole you know oh my god he did because like you
know how people are like I'm gonna drop out of school and um

633
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:15,600
I'm gonna drop out of school uh and like become the next
Facebook creator you know stuff like that they're like oh

634
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:22,160
Mark Zucker like like Mark Zuckerberg I'm going to be just
like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos and become a billionaire

635
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,720
because all they did was follow their dreams.

636
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:40,160
The thing is, a lot of those people, a lot of these people
have, also like, you're not, your university's not Harvard.

637
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,300
There's also that too.

638
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,320
You're not a Harvard dropout.

639
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,560
There's that as well.

640
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:55,900
Because no matter what, Being Harvard dropout Still fucking
brings you clout Because you made it into Harvard But yeah

641
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:05,060
But anyway They had a lot of resources They weren't poor
They were They got They It's either their parents were super

642
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:16,340
fucking rich And they gave them a loan Or like they were
actually supported By They were also like supported By like

643
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:25,360
spouses and stuff like they'll be like it's okay sweetie you
can go to do your dream project i'm gonna still go to my job

644
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:31,600
support you anyway what was this tangent jeff bezos divorced
his wife too

645
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:53,080
that was where my tangent so not oh i don't think any
billionaire in the world is I don't think you need it Yeah,

646
01:02:53,560 --> 01:03:02,040
Mr. Bay There was a whole thing about it There was a whole
thing Because like The wife didn't sign a prenup So she

647
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:11,360
basically took 50% of Bezo's stuff And Bezo was so fucking
angry He was so mad Because like, you know They didn't sign

648
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,320
a prenup Because when he got married He wasn't rich yet

649
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:29,180
He, he wasn't rich yet, so, so, like, she actually got 50%
of everything, um, uh, Maggie, thank you for the magenta

650
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:36,900
soup, but thank you, thank, and he's so very rich, even if
he got, like, 50% of everything, he's so very rich, you

651
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:44,040
know, like, there's, he's gonna die, and he's still be a
billionaire, there's no way, there's nothing, he can go, he

652
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:52,640
can, Like, spend, he can spend, like, I don't know, 50% of
what he, 50% of what he makes, and he's still going to be a

653
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,000
billionaire.

654
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:59,160
His wife took 50% of his fucking, like, his, like, his wife
took 50% of everything he makes.

655
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,120
He's still a fucking billionaire.

656
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,320
It doesn't matter.

657
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,540
Like, he can spend 98%.

658
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,660
Yeah, that guy.

659
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:23,740
He can spend 98% of his entire net worth and he'll still die
fucking more rich than like 98% of us

660
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:45,440
that's how that's how like just like the reality of things
uh anyway anyway sorry that was a long ass tangent that is a

661
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:54,600
long-ass tangent I remember there was a website there's a
there's a website that okay I like how I went through that

662
01:04:54,600 --> 01:05:07,420
entire tangent anyway I will rob innocent people if those
innocent people were billionaires because like they don't

663
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:16,340
care or millionaires you know what some there's some like
there's some actual innocent millionaires anyway this just

664
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:28,960
this justifies me robbing the rich because they don't care
they don't they don't care that's nothing to them 350 000 is

665
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:36,760
nothing to a billionaire and a millionaire it's just like
it's what they make in one day It's literally what they make

666
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:48,340
it one day So they'll not even realize it's God It says
innocent Look There has to be innocent millionaires in there

667
01:05:48,340 --> 01:06:01,360
I believe there is innocent millionaires in there It's so
wrong Look Look If you think about it My wrong turns into a

668
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:11,440
right I can literally rob just one innocent millionaire or
billionaire and they won't notice.

669
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,100
I'll just rob one of them and they won't notice at all.

670
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,460
I'll rob a baby.

671
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,160
A billionaire's child.

672
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,340
They have to be innocent by then.

673
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,740
Because, like, you know, it's not their fault if they're,
like, super, like, greedy.

674
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,100
It's not the child's fault if they're super spoiled.

675
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:42,560
They were just raised to be like that So I'll just rob I'm
pretty sure when the baby is born they instantly become a

676
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:49,960
millionaire So I'll rob the baby and then the billion the
billionaire will just give them back the money They'll just

677
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:57,840
be like oh child like what if like the child is holding like
you know a sack of money And it's 350,000 I'll just steal

678
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:04,160
that sack of money and then would be like, oh sweetie, don't
cry.

679
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,680
Here's another million dollars for you to fucking sleep on.

680
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,160
I don't know.

681
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,100
I don't know what they do.

682
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,020
I don't know what those kids do.

683
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,520
Celeste, thank you for the super chat.

684
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:17,820

Thank you.

686
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:22,620
Are you at point-slope formula because you keep giving us
all the tangents?

687
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:23,780
Thank you for the super chat.

688
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:24,140
Thank you.

689
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:24,900
Thank you.

690
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:34,780
Look, all I'm saying is that it won't be that bad if I,
like, steal from one innocent baby because they won't notice

691
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:49,380
it's gone they they will not notice it's gone that's all i'm
saying oh those people are those people are fucking stupid

692
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:58,000
they are not thinking at the level i'm thinking right now uh
what the fuck am i gonna do with math i'm sorry we're not

693
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,220
voting What would you do with math?

694
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,480
You have a phone.

695
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,800
What will help you?

696
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,020
What will help you in math?

697
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,660
You're going to fucking calculate the time it's going to
take from you to drive from one end to another.

698
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,060
You know what's not going to help?

699
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,580
You know what else can help you with that?

700
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,040
Fucking Google Maps.

701
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,780
Learn engineering.

702
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,960
Just don't be an engineer.

703
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:35,960
If you're If you're already pursuing engineering as a
degree, you don't need to be proficient in math because

704
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,720
you're already proficient in math.

705
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,900
I need math to be cider, man.

706
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:49,560
Guys, if you're already proficient in math, you're already
trying to be an engineer.

707
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,860
You're already proficient in math because why the fuck would
you go towards being an engineer?

708
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,020
How does that make sense?

709
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,180
What do you mean?

710
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,820
How does that make sense?

711
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,420
Taxes, just pay someone and fucking figure out your...

712
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:06,900
Oh, wait.

713
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:14,020
I just realized, like, not a lot of people have the
opportunity to do that.

714
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,520
I'm so sorry.

715
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,260
Sorry.

716
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,100
Some people...

717
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:22,720
Sorry.

718
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:27,360
I have to have someone to do my taxes because I'm, like, I
can't do math.

719
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,420
And also, like, I can afford...

720
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:50,640
I'm fortunate enough to be able to be able to afford an
accountant to pass forward an accountant to check through my

721
01:09:50,640 --> 01:10:03,040
taxes for me okay um celeste thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you i'm an engineer and an accountant and a

722
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,620
former math teacher and i took that personally thank you for
super chat thank you but it's because you're already good at

723
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:18,740
math celeste you're already good at math you don't need to
be proficient you already have that skill you chose that

724
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:29,980
career because you have that There's a reason why I'm not a
math teacher or an accountant or an engineer before I had

725
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:33,000
the before I had the money to afford an accountant.

726
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,680
Do you know who does my taxes?

727
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,240

I am still very stupid.

730
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:51,120
I'm so I I don't want to trust me with numbers because I
don't trust myself with numbers.

731
01:10:51,980 --> 01:11:00,940
I'm just that dumb i just need you guys to know when i did
the ib program when i did the international baccalaureate um

732
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:07,840
you have to like do suggestions and stuff like like you have
to give like what classes are you gonna take so for those

733
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:13,820
who don't know the international baccalaureate is one of the
hard i don't know if it still is but back when i took the

734
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:20,580
international baccalaureate it's one of the hardest uh
courses you can take in high school for so like if you pass

735
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:29,160
the ib program um it's basically like a higher tier than ap
so it's like a higher it's like one of the highest tiers for

736
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:42,100
like uh school like for schooling and um if you pass it if
you pass the ib program um you basically you can get college

737
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:49,420
credit for free like you can get like uh you can get like
bonus college credit so you can like graduate like one to

738
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:56,660
two years early basically so i did IB program and I passed
the IB program and I got like college credit so I could

739
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:06,220
graduate early um but if you can if you get like really good
scores um it's like almost guarantee Ivy League unless you

740
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:13,820
fail the interview because we had I remember there was like
a student like she was oh I told the story a long time ago

741
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:24,580
but there was this girl I know in the IB program and like A
lot of people were like scared of her because she would wear

742
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:33,020
like a fanning pack She would wear like a fanning pack
around and like she had like like knives in that fanning

743
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:45,980
pack And like her like she would say like her dream is to be
a yandre

piss i didn't like i wanted to be her friend because she was

746
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:15,800
like super she's like incredibly smart and i didn't want to
piss her off because one of my friends told me that someone

747
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:25,920
like pissed her off one time became friends with her like uh
one of my my other friends told me was like don't piss her

748
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:39,400
off because she got suspended was because she pulled a knife
on somebody and so i was like gotcha i'm gonna be good

749
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,800
friends with her

750
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:57,680
okay anyway Anyway, so, so, but anyway, she got a perfect
score in the IB program.

751
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:06,700
Like, she got, like, a full marks, basically, in IB, like,
which is, like, really, really fucking good.

752
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:14,140
Like, it's, like, almost impossible to get, like, it's
almost, like, it's very, very, it's, like, the 1%.

753
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:18,940
It's basically the 1% to get a perfect score, like, the
perfect 45.

754
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:34,620
that and her first choice her first choice was harvard and
and she got waitlisted from harvard because of her interview

755
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:48,620
because usually when you get a perfect score that when you
get a perfect score uh you it's almost guaranteed ivy like

756
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:58,120
guaranteed first choice pick in any Ivy League school
because it's that difficult to get in but because like she

757
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:08,860
was very intimidating I'll just say she was like incredibly
intimidating a person no she did not get into Harvard she

758
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:19,060
got into what is that MIT she got into MIT because she
wanted to be an engineer so like She chose MIT after getting

759
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,240
waitlisted to Harvard.

760
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,220
Anyway.

761
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,200
That was not the story.

762
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,100
My story was that.

763
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:40,480
My story was that basically when you're supposed to give
your class choices, there's like three levels of math.

764
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,480
It's standard level, higher level, or baby level.

765
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,000
Studies.

766
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:45,920
Math studies.

767
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,260
Math studies is like...

768
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:55,660
baby level math and then there's standard level and then
there's and then there's like higher level um the counselor

769
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:07,720
the academic counselor was like i think dohi should do
studies after after i put standard level i put standard

770
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:16,800
level but the counselor looked at my list and was like you
should do studies and then and then i told my parents that

771
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:25,160
they're like oh they want me to do math studies and then my
parents were mad and was like she is not doing math studies

772
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:35,760
we will get her tutors so she can do standard she will have
math tutors almost every other day so she can do standard

773
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:47,900
level so then the counselor was like okay the reason why was
because they didn't they were afraid the counselor was

774
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:56,320
afraid that if i like because the reason why is because this
is the school the school was one of those things where like

775
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:03,140
obviously the grades really mattered because they always
like post up like oh our school got the average rating the

776
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:11,760
average like ib score is this so they try to convince a lot
of like they try to convince people who they think are too

777
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:19,840
dumb to take IB to do the lower ring pro to do the other
program because they don't want them to affect the average

778
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,460
IB score that the school has.

779
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:28,700
So they'll be like, they'll be like, oh, we don't think you
should take IB.

780
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,900
You should take that one instead.

781
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,160
It will be so much better for you.

782
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,260
So they don't, they don't want them to like affect the
average.

783
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,080
They don't want down.

784
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,300
Like they were trying to tamper the stats and stuff.

785
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,380
So that's why they were like, we think Doki should take
studies.

786
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,880
So, because they were afraid.

787
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:58,000
They were afraid that my math score was going to lower the
fucking IB score.

788
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,640
They were so scared.

789
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,460
So they were trying to convince my parents and I to take
studies.

790
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:04,720
Anyway.

791
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,680
Anyway, that is why this entire tangent

792
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:21,540
why is why I was not born to do math that is that's
basically it this took me like 20 minutes to explain but

793
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:27,940
that was the story I should not be in charge of anything
math related it got to the point where even the counselor

794
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,680
was like I don't think she should be in this level

795
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:45,780
anyway would you rather supposed to i think they were they
were they were 100 i was so down to do math studies by the

796
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:52,640
way but it was all an ego thing for my parents because they
didn't want a child to do math studies because like that's a

797
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:59,880
little i i guess that's a little embarrassing because
everybody else is like standard level and then like me i

798
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,960
would be in the studies level which is basically being like
she can't do fucking math

799
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:19,360
um um okay be able to walk on water okay obviously fire we
don't even need a pool you all know my opinion about the

800
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:29,840
water like why the fuck would i need a bro what the fuck i
would rather just like okay water i'll just have like a

801
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,140
fucking what's it called those little lifesavers i just put
on those little lifesavers or those life jackets why do i

802
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:40,760
need that i could just touch fire you fire.

803
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,560
So, like, you need to have so much protection.

804
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,580
And, like, and like, what if somebody's drowning?

805
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,100
What can I do?

806
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:53,080
I can't go in the water and, like, fucking save them.

807
01:19:53,500 --> 01:20:00,120
But if somebody is, like, on fire, if a building is on fire,
and then there's no firefighters around, and I'm walking

808
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:04,300
around, and then there's buildings on fire, I can go in and
save the person.

809
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:10,460
I can literally run into that building and save whoever's in
that building and be a hero.

810
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,400
If somebody's drowning, they still drown.

811
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,740
They'll still fucking drown.

812
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:19,600
What can I do?

813
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,080
Watch them drown at a closer spot?

814
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:27,920
That's easy.

815
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,220
Fire also.

816
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,400
Okay, we're not talking about the oxygen here.

817
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:40,440
Maybe they're like, you know, what if they're just like in
the i just like get like do like the movies because movies

818
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:48,300
are so accurate uh i'll just get like a shirt and then like
cover my my face like this and then i'll be fine the oxygen

819
01:20:48,300 --> 01:21:00,040
the fire won't kill me i can breathe through my shirt just
like the movies why would more people want to what do i mean

820
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:11,020
jesus what the fuck would more people like just want to be
jesus or something oh my god i wouldn't be scared about like

821
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:31,800
oil burns because like that's like a mini fire what the what
are these questions um this is just uncomfortable i feel

822
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,360
like for like anybody this is just uncomfortable

823
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:48,760
no no legit though like that is that is just incredibly
uncomfortable like why the fuck would you want that like

845
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:22,050
Okay.

846
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:23,990
Uh.

847
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,010
All right.

848
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:29,410
Be an elder sibling.

849
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:30,890
Be a younger sibling.

850
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:36,550
I feel like younger is the best option because I'm an only
child.

851
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:47,170
I'm in, I'm an only child and like, uh, and like, I don't
know what it's like to be either of these, but from movies

852
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:50,210
and TV shows, you know, because they're always accurate.

853
01:25:53,690 --> 01:26:02,310
I feel like the eldest sibling is like the the guinea pig
you know where they test out what works and what doesn't

854
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:10,410
work and then like you know when they're like oh shit that
doesn't work I won't be doing that to the younger sibling so

855
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:17,170
like obviously all the if they try to do some stuff that
clearly didn't work and cause trauma for the elder sibling

856
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:26,590
the younger they learned that younger sibling they'll be
like oh yeah it's like the older sibling would be like the

857
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:33,350
trial run the test child and then the next one would be like
okay we realized what worked and what didn't work so we're

858
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:41,290
gonna uh we're gonna like try not to do that and then but
you want to be the youngest because obviously they'll be

859
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:48,730
like um the second child they'll be like all right that
didn't work they're like the second child is where you test

860
01:26:48,730 --> 01:27:02,010
out the theories to see if it was true so like so you test
out the theories that you tried out on the eldest and then

861
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:08,950
you try to be like okay the middle child middle child we're
gonna try all these other theories and see what work what is

862
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:15,550
definitely working or not and then finally the third child
is where they're like we perfected it

863
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:26,990
Where you perfect the whole racing kids thing and was like
we figured it out for real

864
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:39,090
So middle child has to be the worst I feel like because then
the eldest obviously you know They were born first and then

865
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:47,170
the youngest they are like oh, I'm gonna spoil you because
you're the youngest now And so I would say youngest also the

866
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:54,970
reason why the younger sibling it's because like Like, the
older your siblings are, the more likely they're going to

867
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:55,670
get married.

868
01:27:56,170 --> 01:28:00,410
So when they get married, they have to give you the
unmarried person.

869
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,710
Red pocket money.

870
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:06,010
So then if you're the youngest, the eldest has to give you
money.

871
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,670
Because they get married.

872
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:13,950
Just think of it that way.

873
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:19,710
True, not the red pocket.

874
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:29,410
Just think of it that way Because the eldest Will have to
eventually And eventually have to get married And like how

875
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:41,350
someone's like, girl, I'm white Like this only applies To
certain people I'm sorry Anyway, I feel like being the

876
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:51,590
youngest sibling Is the best option Let's see Good, thank
you for the Super chat, thank you, thank you As the eldest

877
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:54,330
of six, oldest kid is the test drive model.

878
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,210
Youngest is pampering and spoiled.

879
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:57,490
Middle kids are normal.

880
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:58,430
Thank you for the super chat.

881
01:28:58,630 --> 01:28:59,110
Thank you, thank you.

882
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,550
Yeah, thank you, super chat.

883
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,250
Thank you, thank you.

884
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:05,270
As an elder sibling, you get to form the rules based on what
works for you.

885
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:08,790
If you play your cards right, thank you for the super chat.

886
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:09,770
Thank you, thank you.

887
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,610
Anyway, I'm going to be the younger sibling.

888
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:16,010
I didn't make a poll for this because I thought, oh my God,
it was a 50-50.

889
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,650
People who were on the fence were only child.

890
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,630
that you couldn't think as smart as I did.

891
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:24,370
Lose your sense of touch.

892
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:26,190
Lose your sense of sight.

893
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,490
I would lose my... No.

894
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,150
Oh my god.

895
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:31,010
This is actually... This is difficult.

896
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:34,030
This is actually difficult.

897
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:37,530
No touch versus no sight.

898
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:42,410
I swear this song has been playing on repeat.

899
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:46,030
I'm going crazy right now.

900
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:47,510
Like...

901
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:48,970
I swear.

902
01:29:49,590 --> 01:30:00,770
This song has been playing for like 16 minutes I'm skipping
this I was like I swear I've been listening to this BGM for

903
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:21,970
16 for like forever oh my god um let's see alright lose your
sense of touch or sight actually really difficult.

904
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:24,050
I don't know.

905
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:30,730
I'm thinking, like, what are, like, the benefits for either
or...

906
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,870
Both of these are awful.

907
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,870
Yeah, they're all pretty fucking bad.

908
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:37,490
That's why I was like, I don't know.

909
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:39,210
They're all fucking terrible.

910
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,910
They're all pretty fucking bad.

911
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,730
So it's such a difficult choice.

912
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:58,610
I feel like, okay, no touch means you picking up your body.

913
01:30:58,810 --> 01:30:59,310
That's true.

914
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:00,210
That's true.

915
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:03,090
No one believed this story when I first told it.

916
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:09,170
But, like, there's like this girl in the UK who doesn't feel
anything.

917
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:11,870
She doesn't feel anything at all.

918
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:12,750
She's, like, a kid.

919
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:14,950
So, like, she doesn't feel anything at all.

920
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:19,390
And then, like, the thing is, though, you know, she gets
hurts a lot.

921
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:24,510
She gets hurt a lot, but she doesn't feel anything so she
has she's always like getting hurt and stuff but she doesn't

922
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:32,970
feel anything because she doesn't feel pain uh oh my god

923
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:41,490

that she can survive getting hit by a car because okay it

924
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:54,290
depends on like the speed of the car but but there was a
story with her get injured from getting hit by a car because

925

she has zero fear she has zero fear because she doesn't feel

926
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:13,610

guess I don't know I feel like if I can't see I can't play

948
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:52,530

949
01:33:56,190 --> 01:34:06,510
How would I How would I play video games Though So I don't
know I feel like I rather lose my sense of touch You can

950
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:17,290
Yeah but like It's not It's harder It's gonna It'll be so
much harder To play video games I think I can live with no

951
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:31,790
touch As a gamer I need my eyes Guys, think of it this way
I'm already lost enough I'm already lost enough With eyes

952
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:44,990
How the fuck am I getting Now think What's gonna happen with
no eyes If even with Eyes and a map I get I'm like

953
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:55,410
directionless True I feel like that's even worse I'm gonna
say sense of touch yeah yeah no one chose that thank god

954
01:34:55,410 --> 01:35:10,090
people who debated for like lose okay fast why why why would
anyone pick this we're skipping bro who is the 15 percent

955
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:20,010
what the fuck is wrong like what the fuck is the ring thank
you for the akasupa thank you thank you who is the 50 that

956
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:31,870
that like what the are you okay that's all I could think
like are you okay um marry your crush but you will slowly

957
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:47,430
become oh my god enemies to lovers the perfect trope because
like that's worse you You know, things you like like about

958
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:55,470
the person and then you slowly hate them more and more and
more that's terrible I feel like it makes the lovers real

959
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:07,410
But how slow is slowly how so like 90 years still like on
the diet like on the deathbed and you're like a fuck bro bro

960
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:27,690
I know we got married for like for like the green card, but
bro you bro I think that's romantic too it's just normal

961
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:42,810
marriage bro bro okay we're gonna we're gonna go with we're
gonna go with this no pull this is to there's no way yeah

962
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:54,900
why like you're eventually be stuck outside all year be
stuck okay that's just a pandemic that's that's just a

963
01:36:54,900 --> 01:37:05,480
pandemic we've already inside no pull for this no debate why
why would you want to be with nature how is i don't

964
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:12,000
understand the reason why we went outside is the reason why
the pandemic lasted that

965
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,720
Like, what the fuck?

966
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,440
Alright.

967
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:31,860
Um, living forever versus versus 10 more years.

968
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,460
Forever 10.

969
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,780
Ooh, this is like such a...

970
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:38,360
What's it called?

971
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,380
It's such a philosophical...

972
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:44,000
Like, I guess like a philosophical-esque question.

973
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,340
Like, there's no right or wrong for this.

974
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:45,740
Okay.

975
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:47,700
Honestly, I choose Forever.

976
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:48,980
Okay, no, no, okay.

977
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:49,920
Okay, it depends.

978
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,360
It really depends.

979
01:37:51,740 --> 01:38:01,180
Because, like, I think, like, forever, um, I feel like
forever, more so than 10 more years, but forever is, like,

980
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,460
pretty fucking rough.

981
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,100
I need, okay, actually, no.

982
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,700
It depends on how, how this is gonna be.

983
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:10,900
Will I age along with forever?

984
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,140
Can I say young?

985
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:26,420
Because, like, What if like, you know, I'm like 350 years
old and I am, you look at me and you're like, yeah, she's

986
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:29,300
350 years old.

987
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:39,540
Like, I'm just thinking, I won't be able to walk clearly as
350 years old.

988
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,700
I won't be able to eat for myself or use them.

989
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:47,400
I have to wear like fucking the elderly diapers and stuff
like that.

990
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:54,800
like that because you gotta admit when you're that old I
don't think you can control much about your body so I'm just

991
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:11,980
thinking I'm just thinking I don't want to be like I don't
want to look like I'm 350 so also like I'm scared about like

992
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:22,880
what the world's gonna be after 350 years later I'm a little
scared so so I just think maybe 10 more years is better

993
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:39,380
because I'm worried about what are the conditions of forever
um because like what happens when the sun explodes I don't

994
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:47,120
know you guys know this but like the sun is alive
technically um well not really alive but like it will have

995
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,900
the The sun will eventually die because it's a giant ass
star.

996
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,240
And like stars eventually die.

997
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,060
So like when the sun explodes.

998
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,580
What's going to happen to me?

999
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,160
How am I surviving that?

1000
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,760
I can't breathe in.

1001
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,640
I can't breathe in space.

1002
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:07,200
Yes.

1003
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,540
Eventually the sun will die.

1004
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,940
And like what the fuck am I going to do when the sun dies?

1005
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,260
Like I'm just going to float in space until I land on
another planet.

1006
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:17,180
Like.

1007
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,760
because I live forever.

1008
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,220
elsewhere.

1009
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:29,240
I guess by the time the sun explodes, we would have the
technology to move to another planet.

1010
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:29,940
You live.

1011
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,360
Hopefully no dimension.

1012
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:32,740
That too, Jonathan.

1013
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:33,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1014
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,480
Thank you.

1015
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:34,640
Thank you.

1016
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:35,920
So I'm going to choose 10 more.

1017
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,120
There's too many variables.

1018
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,220
I can't control, but forever.

1019
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,700
I don't know if I'm going to be young forever.

1020
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:53,060
I don't know if I'm going to be young forever, or I'm going
to be the age of which am forever of so so 10 more years i'm

1021
01:40:53,060 --> 01:41:01,900
gonna pick 10 more years i feel like yeah i'm in a majority
there okay have to walk on all fours where you have to hop

1022
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:11,800
on one foot what if you just don't go anywhere i feel like
you trip more with this though i feel like i don't want to

1023
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:20,280
make a pull for this i feel like you there's more chances to
trip more but then you you looked so okay you both of these

1024
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:35,320
options you look so fucking stupid like no matter what both
of these options you look so fucking stupid yes but then

1025
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:43,900
your hand's gonna touch like unless you wear hand shoes i
guess like by then i'll invest in hand shoes though so like

1026
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:54,860
you know my hands won't be like touching like the gross
stuff But oh my god Well, you walking what if you drive good

1027
01:41:54,860 --> 01:42:07,780
quick question this says walk Sorry, glove Sorry in other
words gloves.

1028
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:09,740
That's what I meant gloves

1029
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:25,580
I could just wear gloves so I won't have to like oh my gosh
this is difficult but if I never that's so difficult because

1030
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:34,060
it's like what if like okay like okay here's what I'm
thinking what if I like go to a buffet I have to walk to a

1031
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:39,880
thing where do and then when I have to walk back to the
buffet area like it doesn't work for me i guess i'll have

1032
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:49,680
someone else to hold my tray because like how the am i gonna
like how am i going to fucking i'll just never be able to go

1033
01:42:49,680 --> 01:43:02,880
to buffets anymore hold the plate in your mouth i'll never
be able to do buffets anymore i don't just don't go don't

1034
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:07,500
keep there's a very simple answer to this don't go to the
buffet.

1035
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,900
But what if I want to?

1036
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:21,060
I'd like to have the choice of being able to go to the
buffet.

1037
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:28,760
I want to have, it's like, okay, it's like, you know, like,
I would never do this, but I'd like to have the choice to do

1038
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,120
it.

1039
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:36,480
Like, like, I would not want to commit murder, But I
would...

1040
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,830
If the choice comes...

1041
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:43,080
You know, it's sort of relatable.

1042
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,400
It's sort of something you can compare.

1043
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:47,600
Um...

1044
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,220
Anyway, I think I'd choose...

1045
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:51,760
I feel like...

1046
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,920
Um...

1047
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,060
I feel like hopping on one foot causes more accidents.

1048
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:58,740
Um...

1049
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:02,460
Over, like, walking all fours, wherever you go.

1050
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:03,440
So I'm gonna...

1051
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,040
I'm gonna go with all fours.

1052
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:05,800
Anyway, I'm gonna...

1053
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:08,020
to go with all fours, guys.

1054
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:09,700
Alright.

1055
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,960
There's more people with hopping on...

1056
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,360
Why?

1057
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,160
Guys, who wants to hop on one foot?

1058
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,400
Give me your why.

1059
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,320
I need you guys to explain your reasons.

1060
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:20,580
Who is like the normies?

1061
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:21,740
Who are the normies here?

1062
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,120
Who's the normies?

1063
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:28,700
Why would you want to hop on one foot over like on using all
fours?

1064
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,960
All fours is the furry answer.

1065
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,200
I need no

1066
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:53,960
okay anyway um when the lottery but lose all your friends i
mean that's basically what actually happens remain broke but

1067
01:44:53,960 --> 01:45:03,640
keep your friends okay just don't okay but like people on
the internet won't know that like what you can't make

1068
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:18,300
internet friends as well like where this is go uh so two is
staying normal okay no friends but money versus no money

1069
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:36,740
friends okay money no no friends yeah like can i just make
new friends yeah i'll just make new friends I'm just saying,

1070
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:46,260
like, I mean, winning the, also, I like how dated this is
because winning the lottery doesn't even mean you, like, a

1071
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,840
golden ticket anymore because of taxes.

1072
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:54,620
Apparently, a lot of, like, lottery winners don't know,
especially, like, if they're, like, they come from, like,

1073
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,480
not a lot of money.

1074
01:45:55,780 --> 01:46:00,900
They think winning the lottery immediately automatically
means you have money forever.

1075
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:08,000
And a lot of lottery winners do not know that when you win
the lottery, a lot of that money like it was like a 1

1076
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:16,880
million jackpot a lot of that money is just going to be gone
from taxes so mostly you yeah taxes take like 60% of the

1077
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:23,560
million and then you're left with I don't know like 60% of
that and then after but then they'll be like oh I'm gonna

1078
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:32,840
quit my job and like my entire family is gonna sustain with
uh I'm entire lottery is gonna sustain with just the

1079
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:38,180
winnings and then they end up using all their money after
like five years

1080
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:48,800
and then and then they're broke again and then they're broke
and um and then they go back they have to fucking get a job

1081
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:59,800
again or or another thing that happens is that a lot of
people don't want their names uh don't want their names to

1082
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:08,800
be public uh to be public and winning the lottery because
after winning the lottery you have to a lot of your family

1083
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:15,460
and friends and relatives will try to contact you to be like
oh my god congratulations cannot borrow some of that money

1084
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:21,080
and then apparently apparently a lot of them try to stay
anonymous and stuff because they don't want like they don't

1085
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:30,300
want that to happen to them and at one point like i don't
know i read like An article that one family, like the

1086
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:34,720
parents got divorced and stuff, and they're like, The
lottery ruined our lives!

1087
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,120
It ruined our lives!

1088
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:41,220
I wish I would never won the lottery!

1089
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:48,280
I read there was like one guy that won the lottery, and he
came over to pick it up with like, with a mascot, and he

1090
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,560
never told his family that he won.

1091
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:53,440
He just like kept it in like some trust or something.

1092
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:55,460
He was like, yeah, I'm not telling anybody.

1093
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:57,900
That's so smart.

1094
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:58,980
That's so smart.

1095
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:01,060
So, it's like an emergency fund.

1096
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,860
Like, he just kept doing his job.

1097
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:06,040
He just, like, kept working the same job.

1098
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,360
Pretending that he never won the lottery.

1099
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,200
I think he, like, wore a gorilla mask or some shit.

1100
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:18,340
Yeah, a lot of divorces happen and stuff, too, because of
the lottery.

1101
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,060
T-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you, thank you.

1103
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:25,720
Apparently, winning the lottery in Canada needs you to do a
math problem to receive the money.

01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:34,120
option one is not viable for a toky thank you for the super

1121
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:13,320
I'm your trust system.

1122
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,560
I'm your bank.

1123
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,980
We were branded.

1124
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:21,500
If you were part of the old bank, do not worry.

1125
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,900
We've just rebranded.

1126
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,200
It's the Doki Bank now.

1127
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,520
same interest rates.

1128
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,280
Your accounts are still here, by the way.

1129
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,680
The Doki bank account is still here.

1130
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,760
Your bank accounts are still safe here.

1131
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:37,340
The Bank of Doki is still very safe.

1132
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:38,620
Very good loans.

1133
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,220
Very good interest rates.

1134
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:45,440
So just if you ever win the lottery, just open an account in
the Bank of Doki.

1135
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,000
Anyway, I'd rather win the lottery but lose all my friends.

1136
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:49,480
What?

1137
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:50,040
Really?

1138
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:51,320
Why would you want to

1139
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,240
Broke but keep all my friends.

1140
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:02,740
They've never been poor before Like Thank you.

Thank you.

1147
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:16,340
Like Like I'm just saying I don't think they understand what
the concept of being broke is.

1148
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:16,920
Yeah

1149
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:29,930
Like I'm just thinking like I don't think They understand,
like, what broke really is.

1150
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:31,730
I think they're just like, oh, that's just me.

1151
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:38,430
Um, all right.

1152
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:41,250
Get piercings everywhere possible.

1153
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:42,890
Tongue, I...

1154
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:45,230
Well, I can, like, remove the piercings, right?

1155
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:47,010
All right.

1156
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:48,390
Let's see.

1157
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:51,390
They say broke while still eating food.

1158
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:55,410
Like, I'm just saying, like, when you're broke, you can't
afford, like...

1159
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:56,130
Like, you can't...

1160
01:51:56,630 --> 01:52:12,170
be really strategic on how the fuck like on how to survive
day to day like um okay let's see piercings versus tattoos

1161
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:22,670
piercings tattoos but if your friend is a million thank you
for the super chat jp thank you thank you i mean if you're

1162
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:30,290
already broke and you're saying your friends are really a
But you're still broke like it's the same problem like like

1163
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:39,670
that different like I'm just saying like it's Then you
wouldn't be broke You're like my friend's a millionaire, but

1164
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:44,730
you still have the same problem about being broke You're so
then you still have that problem

1165
01:52:48,730 --> 01:53:03,050
Um Um Anyway, I would say, okay, I don't know, okay, okay,
the thing is, but, like, does the head count as the tattoos?

1166
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:10,990
Because if it's just, like, the rest of my body, but not the
head, so then I could just cover it up for, like, if I have

1167
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:17,710
a real job, that's not streaming, and, like, I have to go to
the office, and I have to cover everything up, I guess,

1168
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:21,950
like, is the head, okay, but tattoos on the head, on the
face, Face?

1169
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,310
I don't know.

1170
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:24,710
Face tattoos?

1171
01:53:25,150 --> 01:53:28,110
In my, this is my personal opinion.

1172
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:29,690
Face tattoos?

1173
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:31,030
Just not it.

1174
01:53:31,450 --> 01:53:33,470
Like, I just...

1175
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:37,710
Just not it.

1176
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:38,710
Face tattoos.

1177
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:41,050
Just, this is my own opinion.

1178
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:45,530
But yeah, face tattoos just not hitting it for me.

1179
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:50,430
I feel like...

1180
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:51,250
I don't know.

1181
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:54,090
I just find face tattoos just...

1182
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:54,450
Yeah.

1183
01:53:57,450 --> 01:54:02,070
Like for piercings, I can at least remove the piercings,
right?

1184
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,850
Like I can get the piercings.

1185
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:06,590
And then I can just remove it later.

1186
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:08,370
So it's not like...

1187
01:54:08,370 --> 01:54:10,350
It's just like places you can pierce.

1188
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:13,930
This is all pretty bad.

1189
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:16,470
I don't think I can get like a normal job.

1190
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:18,570
I didn't either.

1191
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:30,650
Like, like, thinking about it, I'm just like, I can
definitely not get a normal job in either of these

1192
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:31,330
scenarios.

1193
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:39,630
Like, um, oh, and like, my skin can heal, right?

1194
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:42,810
Like, it doesn't mean I have to keep my piercings.

1195
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:47,170
It's like when you get your ears pierced, and then it heals
in the end, right?

1196
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:55,790
So, like, I feel like, you know, I could just get these
piercings once And then the skin will just heal later on If

1197
01:54:55,790 --> 01:55:00,890
I don't, like, keep it going That's just cheating It
doesn't, there was no What do you mean?

1198
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:07,910
It's not cheating because it literally doesn't tell me the
terms and conditions I make up the terms and conditions Here

1199
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:10,090
Does she know?

1200
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:11,590
Wait, what do you mean if I know?

1201
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:15,210
You would What the fuck?

1202
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:27,490
tattoo isn't permanent yes they are what do you mean these
are like unless you're talking about like temporary tattoos

01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:27,750
Okay, they're both painful, too.

1235
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:33,250
Because, like, there's, like, parts of your body for tattoos
that's, like, super painful to get.

1236
01:58:33,910 --> 01:58:35,030
Oh, they're so terrible.

1237
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:36,030
They're both such terrible.

1238
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:37,850
What do you think is the pick from?

1239
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:39,870

01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:41,650
I guess I'll go tattoos.

1241
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:43,330
I'll just never go outside.

1242
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:53,170
I guess I'll get tattoos and I'll also be on Ripley's
Believe In Or Not and the Guinness Book of Records.

1243
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:54,330
I'll just do that.

1244
01:58:54,570 --> 01:59:00,010
There's like people who get like, oh my gosh, the body
modification stuff is actually wild.

1245
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:02,450
It's fucking wild now.

1246
01:59:02,570 --> 01:59:09,330
Like I remember back then, because back then as a little
dokey, I would collect like Ripley's Believe In Or Not.

1247
01:59:09,870 --> 01:59:12,450
and like Guinness Book of Records and stuff like that.

1248
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:17,690
And like there was some fucking wild shit where people would
get like, yeah, Lizard Man.

1249
01:59:17,790 --> 01:59:22,950
There was like Lizard Man and like that guy that had like
the whole skull thing.

1250
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:28,970
You know, like the, the, the, the, he tattooed himself so
that he looked like some fucking skull kid or whatever.

1251
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:35,550
And they're like, I'm just like thinking like you can get
some, there's like one person who tried to get plastic

1252
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:39,430
surgery to look like a Ken doll or a Barbie girl.

1253
01:59:39,870 --> 01:59:44,030
And like, it's fucking, oh my god, is this the same song?

1254
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:46,370
I swear to god, am I listening?

1255
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:48,590
It's the same one.

1256
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:55,030
Why does it keep going back to this?

1257
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:57,170
Oh my god.

1258
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:59,210
Okay, I'm not going to do shuffle anymore.

1259
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:02,830
It keeps going back to that one song.

1260
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:08,410
Oh my god, we're going to go crazy here.

1261
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:09,110
All right.

1262
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:21,170
I know like people have been doing some fucking weird ass
body modifications.

1263
02:00:22,110 --> 02:00:22,310
All right.

1264
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:25,250
Return every non-essential item you've ever bought.

1265
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:28,490
Never be able to buy anything non-essential again.

1266
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:30,910
Wait.

1267
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:32,670
That just means like I'll...

1268
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:34,130
That's just this but worse.

1269
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:35,590
Wait.

1270
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:40,470
Isn't that just this, but worse?

1271
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:43,130
Like, I have to return everything, right?

1272
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:45,230
Because that means I can buy more.

1273
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:46,950
Oh, then get it back.

1274
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:48,650
Oh, okay.

1275
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:49,930
Then I can just buy it back.

1276
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:50,950
Then that's fine.

1277
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:53,250
Like, non-essential items?

1278
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:54,430
I can't buy toilet...

1279
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:56,250
Wait, is toilet paper considered non-essential?

1280
02:00:57,110 --> 02:00:57,370
Right?

1281
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:02,330
Is toilet paper considered non-essential?

1282
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:05,390
Because, like, you don't really need toilet paper.

1283
02:01:05,450 --> 02:01:07,070
You can just get, like, a bidet.

1284
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:22,790
That's, that's the, I guess like, uh, you can just use the
shout, like, let's see, essential if no bidet, bidet is

1285
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:29,650
better, um, I remember there was like the South Park episode
where like the toilet paper company is like, NA is like one

1286
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:38,170
of the only places where bidet is not common, but bidet is
actually healthier for your skin.

1287
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:45,690
as well because like the paper the toilet paper like
actually is not good for your skin and stuff like bidet is

1288
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:53,010
actually better but the fucking toilet paper companies i'm
pretty sure the toilet paper company just has a huge

1289
02:01:53,010 --> 02:02:05,130
monopoly yeah no it's true if you use like dry toilet paper
it's actually worse for your skin um and like you have to

1290
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:17,570
use like baby wipes or because like you have the paper has
to be wet it's actually really bad for your butt like i'll

1291
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:23,690
just i'll just say that toilet paper is actually pretty bad
for your butt

1292
02:02:26,830 --> 02:02:39,650
so so um it's actually better to use like bidets or like
baby wipes but baby wipes is also really bad for I think

1293
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:47,510
like I think like they say like baby wipes is really bad for
um the pipes and stuff uh but yeah like it's actually

1294
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:57,230
healthier to use a bidet um and and I just wish bidets were
popular more popular in NA I just wish bidets were more

1295
02:02:57,230 --> 02:03:03,710
popular in NA I miss bidets so much ever since like you know
when you go to Japan and you have a bidet and then you go

1296
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:04,630
back and then you're

1297
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:21,990
I fucking feel like a caveman every time I come back like
yeah do not flush baby wipes it's very bad for your pipes by

1298
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:39,070
the way it's it's very bad um um but yeah I just god I'm
gonna say this one i'm not gonna make a pose for this

1299
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:46,030
because i feel like that's so fucked up if i can't buy
anything non-essential again break into a stranger's home

1300
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:54,470
and stay for two days without them knowing stay why the fuck
would why why would i go outside bro i'm not gonna debate

1301
02:03:54,470 --> 02:04:08,190

know it's like i was never there exactly they leave after

1302
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:19,730

literally break into one of Bill Gates vacation homes stay

1304
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:34,790
there for two days and then leave how would they know not
even need a poll I don't need a vote for this all right what

1305
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:39,810
the fuck we want these people just love Drink cold drinks.

1306
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:40,550
Not gonna debate.

1307
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:42,310
I already do this anyway.

1308
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:46,550
Um I already do this anyway.

1309
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:48,170
Like I don't care.

1310
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:53,610
Hot drinks in summer feels so much worse than cold drinks in
winter.

1311
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:56,150
Um, I just choose cold drinks in winter.

1312
02:04:56,350 --> 02:04:57,950
I feel like this is fucking terrible.

1313
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:03,710
I could be inside and drink cold drinks.

1314
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:05,730
Tell your best friend all your secrets.

1315
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:06,910
Tell your parents all.

1316
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:07,970
Oh, oh.

1317
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:11,470
Either of them can weaponize it.

1318
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:19,090
Oh, that is difficult.

1319
02:05:20,590 --> 02:05:22,290
That is actually difficult.

1320
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:23,350
Parents.

1321
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:24,770
Secret.

1322
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:31,050
Okay, best friend secrets versus parents.

1323
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:34,110
Best friend.

1324
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:36,190
Parents.

1325
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:38,490
Both suck.

1326
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:38,970

All right.

1331
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:48,250
I feel parents.

1332
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:50,930
He has best friend.

1333
02:05:51,970 --> 02:05:52,170
Okay.

1334
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:52,410

Doki, he lives in a bill-gated community.

1339
02:05:56,930 --> 02:05:58,710

1340
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:00,590

Thank you.

1343
02:06:01,490 --> 02:06:08,150
I could be Bill Gates like, like long lost cousin five times
removed.

1344
02:06:08,330 --> 02:06:09,030
You don't know that.

1345
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:12,130
You don't know that you don't know my genetics.

1346
02:06:12,290 --> 02:06:13,650
Thank you for the super chat.

1347
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:14,010
Thank you.

1348
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:22,990
Thank you I feel like parents because I feel like wait if
you if you tell your best friend all your secrets And then

1349
02:06:22,990 --> 02:06:35,690
they're no longer your best friend you're fucked You're so
fucked like Because like you can lose friends Much more

1350
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:44,790
easily than parents like I feel like like you can you know I
mean for parents you could be like um what's that word

1351
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:53,230
ex-communicated from your parents but like there's a higher
chance that you're you would lose your best friend over like

1352
02:06:53,230 --> 02:07:02,270
being ex like getting kicked out by your parents it's almost
like you're Asian what does that matter even if I get like

1353
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:11,890
disowned from my parents it's less likely um it's less
likely that happened versus getting like losing your best

1354
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:22,550
friend like it's easier to lose friends than to be disowned
like what if i tell like the best friend something so fucked

1355
02:07:22,550 --> 02:07:29,990
up that they're like i can't be your best friend anymore and
then they tell people about that fucked up secret like if i

1356
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:39,690
tell my parents okay something super fucked up it was like i
murdered somebody they'll be like how do we You can be like,

1357
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:41,130
but best friends will do that too.

1358
02:07:41,190 --> 02:07:44,570
Best friends will, you can say best friends will help you
hide the body.

1359
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:49,830
But will they really, will they, would, it's so easy to say
that.

1360
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:55,290
It's so easy for a friend who's not related to you to say
that.

1361
02:07:55,650 --> 02:07:57,570
But will they really do it?

1362
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:04,410
The thing is, they can, they don't have to hide the body
because they'll be like, well, if I just pretend I never

1363
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:05,930
knew you, I won't be involved.

1364
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:16,090
If you kill somebody, they need to help you because her
reputation is connected to you Because they don't want to be

1365
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:18,810
the parents of the daughter who committed murder

1366
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:30,690
They their reputation is on the line Because they'll also be
in the articles too They'll be like oh my god How could this

1367
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:40,910
parent raise a monster who murdered like five people Like so
they have to hide the body for you because they don't want

1368
02:08:40,910 --> 02:08:48,650
that to be on the line but then your best friend if you kill
somebody they'll be like holy fuck i'm gonna call the police

1369
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:54,610
because i don't want to be like because they'll have to go
to trial they'll have to go to trial and like they'll have

1370
02:08:54,610 --> 02:09:00,610
to go to jail for being involved and they're not even
related to me why would they want to hide the body they're

1371
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:09,990
not related to me they cannot even have to they won't have
to be in trial for anything or like be in every day

1372
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:20,150
everything so i'll tell the parents you guys will tell your
best friend all your secrets like really why would you guys

1373
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:26,750

might have a secret like if you're like it's like all your

super chat thank you thank you I trust a friend do you okay

1376
02:09:47,510 --> 02:10:08,790
you can't be fully clean come on I got no secrets that would
send me okay I'm just saying I'm just saying because I don't

1377
02:10:08,790 --> 02:10:11,770
want my parents to know what I watch at the night.

1378
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:13,910
Thank you for the super chat.

1379
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:14,730
Thank you.

1380
02:10:14,990 --> 02:10:15,730
Thank you.

1381
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:20,170
I have no enemies.

1382
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:23,450
I mean, my friend won't judge me as much.

1383
02:10:23,870 --> 02:10:25,310
I guess you could say that.

1384
02:10:25,410 --> 02:10:28,550
Your friend won't judge, but then what if you're not friends
anymore?

1385
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:30,530
What if you're not friends anymore?

1386
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:32,690
And they know all of that.

1387
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:38,030
My friend, I like how someone's like, don't worry.

1388
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:51,090
My friend has done way worse stuff than me so I'm fine with
that if my parents knew everything I would disappear okay

1389
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:56,450
unimportant thank you super chat thank you thank you I
changed my mind if I have friends they'll probably be as

1390
02:10:56,450 --> 02:11:04,950
weird as me my parents said they would my parents said they
would go to the police you don't know that it's all like

1391
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:13,850
figuratively you know deep down your parents do not want to
the parents of a of a son or daughter that murdered somebody

1392
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:25,550
they say that but you know deep down they don't want to be
in the article as a parent that raised a monster they don't

1393
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:32,410
my dad is a cop

1394
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:41,730
um Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

1395
02:11:42,070 --> 02:11:42,190
Thank you.

1396
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:51,370
Thank you As long as you know what felonies your friends are
committed, you'll always part ways Thank you for the super

1397
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:51,670
chat.

1398
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:52,090
Thank you.

1399
02:11:52,090 --> 02:11:53,210
Thank you.

1400
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:55,910
My parents were in it with pride.

1401
02:11:56,630 --> 02:12:00,310
Okay, I guess I was like my parents are very good at
avoiding accountability.

1402
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:02,390
They'll still be in the articles!

1403
02:12:03,130 --> 02:12:04,990
Don't be fucking in the articles.

1404
02:12:05,170 --> 02:12:10,910
Be like, these are the parents that raised a child who
murdered five people in five different states.

1405
02:12:11,370 --> 02:12:12,970
It'll still be in the article.

1406
02:12:14,610 --> 02:12:16,930
They will be like, that's the best friend.

1407
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:23,750
No one cares about that's the best friend who was the friend
of the murderer that murdered five people in five different

1408
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:24,170
states.

1409
02:12:24,490 --> 02:12:25,570
No one would say that.

1410
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:27,610
Everyone would always mention the parents.

1411
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:31,090
Is this a kid?

1412
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:32,190
No, this is all.

1413
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:33,930
No, guys, it's all figuratively.

1414
02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:35,550
It's like, what if I did

1415
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:47,390

1416
02:12:47,390 --> 02:12:55,050

1417
02:12:55,050 --> 02:13:04,950
my parents all my secrets I do that it's all hypothetical
situation this is all hypothetical really I'm the 35 percent

1418
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:10,170
you guys you guys just don't understand me.

1419
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:10,690
All right.

1420
02:13:11,730 --> 02:13:13,970
Always have a random taste in your mouth.

1421
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:16,490
Be unable to have taste in your mouth.

1422
02:13:17,070 --> 02:13:18,470
Oh, they all suck.

1423
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:20,610
I hate either of these options.

1424
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:24,590
I hate either of these.

1425
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:26,610
They all fucking suck.

1426
02:13:28,850 --> 02:13:33,730
I feel like, damn, Dragoons be busy with all these murders.

1427
02:13:34,130 --> 02:13:35,390
Mark, thank you for the super chat.

1428
02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:35,710
Thank you.

1429
02:13:35,770 --> 02:13:36,430
Thank you.

1430
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:37,930
Dark Blade.

1431
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:39,030
Thank you for the super chat.

1432
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:39,370
Thank you.

1433
02:13:39,590 --> 02:13:39,750
Thank you.

1434
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:43,570
I don't know if I want my parents to find out how much I
spent on but is that a secret?

1435
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:46,370
How is that deep dark secret dark blade?

1436
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:48,090
Thank you for the super chat.

1437
02:13:48,370 --> 02:13:48,550
Thank you.

1438
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:57,290
Thank you Um, one is always oh my god Why are you ashamed
dark blade?

1439
02:13:57,650 --> 02:14:01,870
How dare how could you be ashamed dark blade?

1440
02:14:02,890 --> 02:14:09,590
Um, I don't know they're all terrible of them.

1441
02:14:09,670 --> 02:14:18,210
I feel I'm not making a poll for this one but I feel like I
guess I guess I'll like get used to it.

1442
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:20,270
It could be a random good taste.

1443
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:21,250
Yeah it's gotcha.

1444
02:14:21,550 --> 02:14:22,830
You know life is wild.

1445
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:25,890
Life is fucking wild.

1446
02:14:26,110 --> 02:14:27,050
It's like gotcha.

1447
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:33,430
Face a zombie apocalypse or face a robot.

1448
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:34,950
Okay this one's interesting.

1449
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:38,690
Zombies versus robots.

1450
02:14:39,970 --> 02:14:40,570
Zombies.

1451
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:42,710
Robots.

1452
02:14:43,650 --> 02:14:45,050
I'd say like...

1453
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:47,090
I'd say one.

1454
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:48,690
I'd say zombies.

1455
02:14:49,730 --> 02:14:52,570
I write fan fiction already have no taste.

1456
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:54,230
Tom, thank you for the super chat.

1457
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:54,990
Thank you, thank you.

1458
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:57,490
I'd say zombies over robots.

1459
02:14:57,930 --> 02:15:00,730
Because robots, you can't use any technology ever again.

1460
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:03,070
Because robots would just like use it.

1461
02:15:03,190 --> 02:15:05,790
You know, like robots will like take over all sense of...

1462
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:07,030
It's just Y2K.

1463
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:09,030
Okay.

1464
02:15:09,050 --> 02:15:14,010
It's literally what if Y2K happened and the robots just take
over the world.

1465
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:19,230
And, like, I feel like robots having that much power is a
lot worse than zombies.

1466
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:21,170
Because zombies are brainless in the end.

1467
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:22,450
And they're easier to kill.

1468
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:25,390
Robots, you can shoot your gun at a robot.

1469
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:27,130
It doesn't mean they're fucking dead.

1470
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:29,370
You have to, like, fry their circuits or something.

1471
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:31,010
Or, like, SkyNet.

1472
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:33,050
Yeah, it's, like, SkyNet and Y2K.

1473
02:15:33,650 --> 02:15:37,390
And, honestly, what if the robots aren't hot?

1474
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:38,790
If evil, why hot?

1475
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:45,030
you for the super chat thank you thank you there can be hot
zombies what happened to that warm bodies remember that

1476
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:56,230
fucking zombie zombie uh romantic movie about like having a
zombie boyfriend like they're they can both be hot

1477
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:10,170
what warm bodies that was a thing warm bodies was a thing
people wanted to fuck the Zombie boyfriend.

1478
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:12,270
I saw it.

1479
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:13,390
It was on Tumblr.

1480
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:14,530
I saw it.

1481
02:16:14,830 --> 02:16:17,670
People are so obsessed with the zombie boyfriend thing.

1482
02:16:21,970 --> 02:16:22,630
I would say.

1483
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:24,010
Also, Chris, thank you for the super chat.

1484
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:24,310
Thank you.

1485
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:24,930
Thank you.

1486
02:16:25,190 --> 02:16:29,090
A true dragon always sacrifices your wallet for the greater
good.

1487
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:30,950
Thank you for the super chat.

1488
02:16:31,470 --> 02:16:32,230
Thank you.

1489
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:35,630
I would say.

1490
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:37,790
I would definitely say zombie apocalypse.

1491
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:38,630
I feel like.

1492
02:16:39,050 --> 02:16:43,210
Okay, a robot apocalypse, eventually, they can...

1493
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:48,710
Okay, the thing is, a robot apocalypse, they can just
rebuild more robots.

1494
02:16:49,190 --> 02:16:49,850
That's the thing.

1495
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:51,430
Like, that's endless.

1496
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:54,770
Zombies, they just need to turn other people to zombies.

1497
02:16:55,290 --> 02:17:00,990
So, like, by then, you can find a cure for the zombie
apocalypse.

1498
02:17:01,430 --> 02:17:04,430
I don't think you can find a cure for a robot apocalypse.

1499
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:07,550
It's more endless, because they can just rebuild themselves.

1500
02:17:09,050 --> 02:17:21,250
but they require bodies they require bodies um but like a
robot apocalypse they'll just keep building robots there's

1501
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:29,810
more of a chance to yeah you can say emp but like what if
you there's always a possibility that that like a robot

1502
02:17:29,810 --> 02:17:37,310
apocalypse will come back like you can never trust
technology again i don't like that i want to be able to use

1503
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:45,630
the internet while i'm in apocalypse Oh my god Think of the
YouTube content You can get

1504
02:17:51,950 --> 02:18:07,790
Day 55 On the search for supplies Like okay I feel like If
we had a zombie apocalypse Now In the current day There's

1505
02:18:07,790 --> 02:18:13,890
going to be YouTube tutorials of people like giving like
youtube tutorials on like how to survive zombie apocalypse

1506
02:18:13,890 --> 02:18:21,090
assuming that the internet still works you know assuming
that the servers and the internet are still all available

1507
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:28,010
because i'm just thinking like okay i'm just thinking you
know like the youtube headquarters with all the servers with

1508
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:33,970
all the internet servers and stuff for youtube like what are
the zombies gonna do they're not gonna destroy the servers

1509
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:39,710
they're fucking brainless all they want to do is just eat
other other people so like the servers are gonna to be safe

1510
02:18:39,710 --> 02:18:46,050
it just needed to be powered up you know like the youtube
servers and like you know we already have the experience

1511
02:18:46,050 --> 02:18:53,930
with like the pandemic so we can work at home we don't have
to be at the office to work on the youtube servers so then

1512
02:18:53,930 --> 02:19:03,810
we can um how would they destroy electricity they don't have
fucking any neural neuron like neurological like like

1513
02:19:03,810 --> 02:19:10,630
craving to destroy the electricity who's maintaining the
power grid i don't know just build a fucking fort around the

1514
02:19:10,630 --> 02:19:18,330
power grid i feel like you can be like really rich in
supplies if you're people who can't live about the internet

1515
02:19:18,330 --> 02:19:25,430
will give so much supplies to the person who runs the power
grid like

1516
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:37,330
they'll be like here's my they'll be like treated like gods
it's like what's it called what's that called Mad Max.

1517
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:40,630

This is too much work.

1536
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:15,000
Broadway is way too much work.

1537
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:17,060
Like, this film done.

1538
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:18,060
This is too much.

1539
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:23,180
Also, you're not really famous when you're a Broadway star.

1540
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,120
Always be lonely.

1541
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:28,700
This is so sad.

1542
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:30,740
Bro, this is too much.

1543
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:33,040
But this is also so sad.

1544
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:34,380
This is...

1545
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:35,680
Bro, I don't want to answer this.

1546
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:42,300
Oh, as an introvert, this is Way too much as an introvert.

1547
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:43,280
I hate it.

1548
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:46,080
But this is way too little.

1549
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:48,820
I feel, I'm not going to debate about this.

1550
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,860
I'm going to say surrounded by others.

1551
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,840
Because then I can always have collabs.

1552
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:55,640
Toki.

1553
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:58,440
Stop thinking about the content.

1554
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:01,720
But then, like, I can always have, like, collabs if I want.

1555
02:23:01,820 --> 02:23:03,640
Like, it'll be easier to get collabs.

1556
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:04,400
All right.

1557
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:06,840
Okay.

1558
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:10,140
I'm going to do, like, two more questions.

1559
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:12,500
Chat, I'm going to do two more than we'll call it here.

1560
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,940
The streamer mindset.

1561
02:23:15,740 --> 02:23:16,040
All right.

1562
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:20,700
Video game versus movie.

1563
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:22,140
All right.

1564
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:24,340
Video game.

1565
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:26,180
Movie.

1566
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:27,980
I say video game.

1567
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:30,340
Okay, it depends if I'm the main character.

1568
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:32,320
Because I can have respawn.

1569
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:34,260
I can respawn.

1570
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,300
In the favorite, I feel like video game.

1571
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:40,100
It depends on what video game it is.

1572
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:43,080
So, it depends on what video game.

1573
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:48,600
But I feel like if I was in my favorite video game, I can
always respawn.

1574
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:50,700
Oh, wait.

1575
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:52,660
My favorite is, like, Professor Layden.

1576
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:53,680
So, like, I'm fine.

1577
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,540
I can be Luke!

1578
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,120
Luke, my boy.

1579
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:57,800
Professor?

1580
02:23:58,340 --> 02:23:59,040
Yeah, I'm going to do.

1581
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:00,840
My favorite movie?

1582
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:03,000
I don't even know what my favorite movie is.

1583
02:24:03,620 --> 02:24:04,120
Professor!

1584
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:12,040
All right, I'll say video game.

1585
02:24:12,140 --> 02:24:12,540
I don't even know.

1586
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:14,640
I don't think I have a favorite movie.

1587
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:16,000
I don't think so.

1588
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:18,040
So I'll go ahead and go with a video game.

1589
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,300
This is not really a debate.

1590
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:19,760
What?

1591
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:21,320
I guess normies.

1592
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,320
Fucking normies.

1593
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:26,840
All right, I'm refreshing.

1594
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:27,880
This question sucks.

1595
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:29,800
This is not gonna be my last question.

1596
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:31,420
I'm refreshing this.

1597
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:33,820
This is a bad would you rather.

1598
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:34,580
All right.

1599
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:38,360
I'm gonna try and get a good one.

1600
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:40,000
Uh...

1601
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:43,080
Let's see.

1602
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:45,740
Oh my god, this was terrible.

1603
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:51,620
Okay.

1604
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:52,480
Alright.

1605
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:54,140
Okay, I'm going to...

1606
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:55,120
That's not going to be my...

1607
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:01,440
We're ending it with this.

1608
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:03,320
This is like debate club.

1609
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:07,460
We're going to end it with this one.

1610
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:18,700
Oh my god, we're gonna end it with this one.

1611
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:21,680
Alright, alright.

1612
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:31,740
Okay, this is so easy for me, but no matter what choice we
make, we're all horrible people.

1613
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:32,660
Because like...

1614
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:39,680
Because like, a lot of people are like cancer, but then
someone's like, bro, world hunger kills more people.

1615
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:49,580
But like, but, okay, but cancer, but if we cure cancer, my
mom can't be like, this food can cause cancer anymore.

1616
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:55,120
She can't, like, my parents can't lie and be like, don't do
this, it'll cause cancer.

1617
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:57,100
Don't do that, it'll cause cancer.

1618
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:01,040
If I cure cancer, that won't be an excuse anymore.

1619
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:08,220
I like how someone's like, I rather save kids than adults.

1620
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:17,200
too well they're already suffering through many things at
least we'll get rid of one okay if we solve you can't say

1621
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:27,280
cancer patients are already are starving too because they'll
die from one or the other like we say cure world hunger but

1622
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:35,120
they're still gonna fucking suffer from cancer like what
kind of fucking question is that what kind of fucking answer

1623
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:42,600
is that eventually we will You don't cure world hunger.

1624
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:44,060
You just...

1625
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:46,460
You don't cure world hunger.

1626
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,280
It's just that...

1627
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:51,320
It's just that we don't provide...

1628
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,100
We don't have...

1629
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:55,260
Like, we don't provide food to, like, end up...

1630
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:58,920
Like, we are not good at providing food to people,
apparently.

1631
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:04,960
Because there's already a cure to world hunger, and it's
just food.

1632
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:07,920
It's literally just food.

1633
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:09,560
There's no cure.

1634
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:19,940
the cure we're just not applying the cure um charles thank
you the super chat thank you thank you cancer is harder real

1635
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:28,200
hunger is more of a district yeah exactly it's a
distribution issue we have the cure and it's just food but

1636
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:35,020
we don't provide the food we don't provide we don't
distribute the food we don't know what the cure is for

1637
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:43,580
cancer yet i'm so right we're always being like we are in
the cure for cancer but we still haven't fucking cured

1638
02:27:43,580 --> 02:28:00,360
cancer yet um world hunger god equals lesser crime equals
lesser death but cancer is terrible okay anyway meanwhile us

1639
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:07,000
wasting cuts okay i feel like some of that part is so fucked
up but like there's literally nothing we can do about it the

1640
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:14,260
wasting food part because it's like it's like there's a lot
of like supermarkets and a lot of bakeries and a lot of like

1641
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:21,740
um a lot of like uh like food making places where if there's
like an excess amount of excess amount of food they don't

1642
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:28,980
donate the food they just throw it out because it's a legal
issue because what if somebody gets sick off of the food you

1643
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:39,140
donated um they have the legal means to sue you and like in
america everybody loves to sue people like everyone loves to

1644
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:46,540
pursue lawsuits so people don't they're like we have to
throw it away because they don't want to be liable to they

1645
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:57,720
don't want to be liable to be to they don't want to be
liable for it too i know that's like one of the reasons i

1646
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,180
don't know what the other reasons were as to why they don't

1647
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:10,860
um um but i don't i don't remember why there was like
another reason why they don't donate the food but it's like

1648
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:15,500
this is like one of the main reasons because they don't want
to be liable for a lawsuit if somebody gets sick off of the

1649
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,680
food you donated

1650
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:31,940
if you give it to a food bank then you wave all liability
that's a myth oh my god i believe that for so long.

1651
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:35,560
It's like the whole McDonald's thing all over again.

1652
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:37,940
They can write off the losses.

1653
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:39,640
Oh, it's all about taxes, man.

1654
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:43,540
It's always... Why does this always come back to taxes?

1655
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:46,840
Why does this always come back?

1656
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:53,160
Why does this always come back to taxes, man?

1657
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:05,480
It's just like the McDonald's coffee thing all over again
where they fucking tell you that was true and then you find

1658
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:16,500
all this did you guys know super size me apparently we were
lied to about the movie super size me because apparently the

1659
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:26,220
guy who made that movie who made super size me embellished
it so much that like apparently like a lot of the movies

1660
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:29,040
from Super Size Me is a fucking lie.

1661
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:33,500
I watched that movie in class at least four times.

1662
02:30:34,480 --> 02:30:35,180
It was terrible.

1663
02:30:35,380 --> 02:30:42,200
I fucking watched Super Size Me at least three to four times
because our teachers were always like, let's watch something

1664
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:43,100
educational.

1665
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:47,600
Super Size Me regarding like the health and the fast food
industry.

1666
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:55,340
What Super Size Me is about some dude that fucking binged
himself with McDonald's and got like incredibly unhealthy.

1667
02:30:55,500 --> 02:31:05,360
His wife divorced him after I shouldn't laugh about this But
like it's because I don't know if it's his wife or his

1668
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:09,340
Girlfriend but like his Girlfriend's vegan so

1669
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:23,440
It's either Like his girlfriend or his wife But like his
girlfriend Or wife like left Him because like she's vegan

1670
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:29,720
And then he could never stop eating And he was also, like,
vegetarian slash vegan.

1671
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:30,660
I don't remember which one.

1672
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:34,540
He was apparently, like, vegan slash vegetarian.

1673
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:38,780
And he did the whole Super Size Me stuff.

1674
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:44,960
And then, like, he couldn't go back.

1675
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:47,240
He couldn't stop eating meat.

1676
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,420
Like, he couldn't stop.

1677
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:55,480
And then, also, like, he was complaining about...

1678
02:31:55,500 --> 02:32:04,540
like the health issues but also he was a full-on vegan and
you cannot go straight into fast food after being vegan for

1679
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:14,540
so long like your body is not fucking your body cannot
handle that if you used to be vegan and you suddenly decided

1680
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:29,160
to just eat fast food like when like there's like shit like
Anyway, Super Size Me was apparently a fucking lie.

1681
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:32,280
I couldn't believe it when I found out.

1682
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:33,960
It, like, broke my world.

1683
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:37,600
It actually, like, ruined reality for me.

1684
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:42,520
Because I was, like, I saw that movie so many times at
school.

1685
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:48,280
And then people were like, by the way, Super Size Me was so
embellished.

1686
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:50,240
Like...

1687
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:55,160
Like...

1688
02:32:56,280 --> 02:33:04,520
all right anyway anyway a super size though i think the
super size though like for those who didn't know mcdonald's

1689
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:15,160
used to used to like um have a size called super size and it
was like fucking crazy i still i do think the super size

1690
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:27,420

i would fucking give them that regarding super size like And

1691
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:37,220
an American portion is so funny I was watching a short about
like fast food portions And it was like it was like like

1692
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:47,620
here are American fast food portions versus like Asia fast
food portions And I'm like Jesus fucking Christ Like I think

1693
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:55,360
it was like a Japan large was like an American like medium
or something And I was like Jesus fucking Christ

1694
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:02,820

1695
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:09,620
Like the soda cups are just crazy insane.

1696
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:11,260
Anyway, I'd cure cancer.

1697
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:12,360
I'd cure.

1698
02:34:12,520 --> 02:34:13,880
It's a rough decision.

1699
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:21,080
I think this is like a good place to end it.

1700
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:24,040
The cure cancer versus world hunger.

1701
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:31,940
