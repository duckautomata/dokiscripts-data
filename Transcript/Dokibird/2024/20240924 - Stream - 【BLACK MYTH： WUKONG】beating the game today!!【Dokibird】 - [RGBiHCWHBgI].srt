1
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,300
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,700
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,740
Oh my god, today has been so busy for me.

4
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,260
I have been in meetings the whole day.

5
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,580
I have some good news!

6
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,640
I finally have my new company bank account!

7
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Yay!

8
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,240
I felt so fucking stupid talking to the banker.

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,280
I made the appointment last week, but the earliest they could do was today.

10
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,500
I made the appointment and I felt so fucking stupid.

11
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,320
She was like, do you have a credit line?

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,100
I was like, credit line?

13
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,840
Does this bank account, does your other bank account have a credit line?

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm like, I'm sorry, what's a credit line?

15
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
She's like, does it or does it not have?

16
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,260
And I'm like, I don't know what the credit line is!

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,220
I don't know!

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,860
I felt so fucking stupid.

19
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,440
And she was like, how the fuck did you open your other bank account?

20
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,540
How do you not know?

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,980
And then they...

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,900
They were asking so many questions!

23
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
And I was like, I don't know.

24
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,020
I was like, I'm sorry, I don't...

25
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,340
Can you rephrase that?

26
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,620
Like, what does that mean?

27
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,130
Anyway, she said other things too.

28
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,290
But like, I...

29
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,110
I was like, I don't know, I'm sorry.

30
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,870
And she's like...

31
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,450
And I was like, oh, can I have a...

32
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,290
Can I have a credit card with...

33
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,590
Open for this account too?

34
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,050
And she was like, oh, you have to apply for it.

35
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,350
And I was like, okay.

36
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,090
And then she's like, okay, how much are you willing...

37
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,090
Are you asking for?

38
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,030
I was like, I don't know.

39
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,590
Like, what are the options?

40
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,270
And she's like, well, there's no options.

41
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,570
It's basically, give me a number amount.

42
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,250
I was like, there's no...

43
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,110
I don't know.

44
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,810
I don't know how much I'm gonna use this credit card.

45
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,390
I just...

46
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,790
I just wanted a credit card.

47
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,690
I didn't know.

48
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,390
And she's like, it can either get accepted or rejected.

49
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,610
Depending on how much you're asking for.

50
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,870
I was like, what is considered high?

51
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,010
What is considered high?

52
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,270
What is considered low?

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,970
And I was like, 3000.

54
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,150
I just said a random number.

55
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,790
I was like...

56
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,290
I'll have 3000 for my credit card, please.

57
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,690
Because I don't know.

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,830
And I was like...

59
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,210
Because they can raise the credit.

60
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,950
The...

61
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,350
It's so...

62
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,250
I don't know.

63
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,250
I was under pressure.

64
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,770
She didn't give me any options.

65
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,070
She...

66
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,390
I didn't know.

67
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,230
I was like...

68
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,370
I was like...

69
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,310
I'll take $3000 as the credit card.

70
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,090
And she's like, 3000.

71
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,950
I was like, yes.

72
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,750
And I was like, okay.

73
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,670
And she's like, okay.

74
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,390
And then she just wrote 3000.

75
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,490
I was like...

76
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,250
I was so confused.

77
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,690
I was so confused.

78
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,530
You don't understand.

79
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,570
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,990
I got a message from Ellen.

81
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,390
He's like, can you join this game right now?

82
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,290
And I'm just like, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,430
I just started my stream.

84
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,190
I'm beating...

85
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,210
I'm beating Wukong finally.

86
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,290
Oh my God.

87
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,470
Oh my God.

88
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,890
Sorry.

89
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,430
Anyway...

90
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,110
I know what the fuck feather party is.

91
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,010
I think like, wait.

92
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,970
Wait, let me double check.

93
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,870
What is this?

94
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,990
What is this?

95
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,830
What is he streaming real quick?

96
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,230
Is this?

97
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,190
Oh, my God.

98
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,150
Oh, that's a lot of people.

99
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,610
Oh, I would have been so scared.

100
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,770
It's a lot of hard hitters there, too.

101
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:02,810
What

102
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,200
do you mean?

103
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,000
I need to play Wukong.

104
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,140
What the fuck do you mean?

105
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,380
We need to fucking beat this game, chat.

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,160
We need to beat this game, guys.

107
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,520
It's been a whole entire month, chat.

108
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,040
Today is the day.

109
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Where we beat Wukong.

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,600
Anyway, as I was saying...

111
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,340
As I was saying, I was so fucking...

112
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,380
Oh, my God.

113
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,260
I was...

114
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,360
I was so fucking...

115
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,860
Nervous and everything.

116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,840
Because, like I said, I...

117
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,720
I was just like, I don't know.

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
There's so many...

119
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,120
There's so many questions.

120
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,820
And I'm like, I don't know how to answer this.

121
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,240
And I feel like I could tell she was like, how...

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,700
I could...

123
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,640
I could tell that the lady was, like, really annoyed.

124
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,080
Because she's like, how do you not know?

125
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,020
And I'm just like, I'm sorry.

126
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,800
Because I have another bank account.

127
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,740
She's like, how did you open this bank account?

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,340
We can't...

129
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,040
We can't answer these questions.

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,100
How do you have these many credit cards?

131
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,220
And you can't...

132
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,800
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,740
I'm...

134
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,460
I'm doing this for the first time.

135
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,180
With no help.

136
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,100
This is...

137
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,440
This is my first time.

138
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,920
But, like, we...

139
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,160
We're okay.

140
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,580
Everything is fine.

141
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,380
Everything is...

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,940
Fine.

143
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,200
Lunar means thank you for the magenta soupa.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,600
Thank you.

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,860
That's my first day.

146
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,860
Anyway.

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,080
And also, like, when she, like...

148
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
I don't know what's going on.

149
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,080
But, like, she was in the phone call.

150
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,220
I was like, oh, can you...

151
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,440
Can you send me the form?

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,220
Can you let me know what my routing number and account number is?

153
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,340
So I can accept wire transfers from, like, companies and spots.

154
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,480
And stuff like that.

155
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,740
And she was like, yeah, yeah, after you sign all of this after the call, I'll send it to you.

156
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,000
And I was like, yeah, thank you so much.

157
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,420
It's like, because I don't know.

158
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,580
I don't know.

159
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,300
I don't know what my Y routing number is.

160
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,360
And then after I sign everything, I was like, I wrote an email.

161
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,420
I was like, hey, so where's the form?

162
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,300
And then she was like, oh, go to your branch.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
Go to your, go to your bank's branch and ask them.

164
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:17,700
And I'm like, I was like, but you said go

165
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,860
to my bank's branch.

166
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,680
What do you mean?

167
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,920
Anyway, I have my new bank account, but I have to go to the bank tomorrow.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,920
I have to go to the bank tomorrow.

169
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,480
So I can figure out what my routing and account number is.

170
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,380
I mean, I have my account number in the documents.

171
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,040
It says what my account number is.

172
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,120
But like, I don't know what like the other stuff is, though.

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,860
Like, I don't know what I don't know what my routing number is, which is very unfortunate.

174
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,540
Because like I said, I need I need my routing number to be.

175
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,640
I need my routing number.

176
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,220
To like know, to like know how to do wire transfers or like how to get paid by other companies.

177
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,540
So I got to figure that out.

178
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,220
I have online banking.

179
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,540
No, because they're like, not yet, because it because it can't it doesn't go instantly.

180
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:36,400
They're like, oh, you have to you have to wait until you receive your debit card.

181
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,500
And then.

182
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:47,160
And then when you get your debit card, it should have like a password to to open your online banking account.

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,640
And then and then, well, not just the routing, though, but a transit number, too.

184
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,600
And was it the like, just numbers?

185
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,940
There's so many numbers.

186
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,940
There's so many numbers.

187
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,300
Why the fuck even Saikudo was like, Saikudo just messaged me.

188
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,860
He's like, Fender party right now.

189
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,460
I'm like, I'm sorry.

190
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,990
I told I told him I can't.

191
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm really beating Wukong today.

192
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:29,450
I just started my own stream and I need to be right.

193
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,590
I promise to beat Wukong.

194
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,690
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,930
I'm so sorry.

196
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,730
I'm so sorry.

197
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,770
I would love to.

198
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,590
But I can't spin off.

199
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,810
I want to be a month.

200
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,130
OK, anyway.

201
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,130
Speedrun Toki, you can feed it to Marr.

202
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,690
Guys, No, we are going to beat Wukong.

203
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,170
I'm not going to delay Wukong to another weak chat.

204
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:07,890
I.

205
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,750
I did.

206
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,570
I was like, are you serious?

207
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,090
I did.

208
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,770
I said no.

209
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,930
Are you proud of me?

210
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,370
Are you proud of me?

211
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,930
I actually said no.

212
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,450
Oh my god.

213
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,250
I fucking did it, guys.

214
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,010
I actually said no.

215
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,510
Anyway, what was I saying?

216
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,890
What the fuck?

217
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:39,590
Oh, is fetter party like... Oh, fetter party is like pummel party, but like with fetters.

218
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,530
Anyway, what was I saying?

219
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:42,970
Oh, yeah.

220
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,650
So, I have to go to the bank tomorrow to like...

221
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,190
And someone was like, what about your checkbook?

222
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,850
Guys, I literally just opened my account today on the phone.

223
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm not getting anything.

224
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:04,510
I literally opened my bank... like I had the bank account opened literally this morning.

225
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,570
It was like an hour and a half phone call.

226
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,250
Yeah, on the phone.

227
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,570
Because...

228
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,370
Because they can only do it on the phone.

229
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,190
I was like...

230
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,170
And they were like...

231
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,410
Oh my god.

232
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,830
They're like, you can only do it by phone.

233
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,830
I was like, can I do it by PC or like at the branch?

234
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,390
And they're like, no, you can't do it at the branch.

235
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,590
You have to...

236
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,170
You have to do it on the phone.

237
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,310
I'm like, okay.

238
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:40,020
I was booking an appointment online to see if I could book it at my branch.

239
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,740
And they're like, no, it can only be done on the phone.

240
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,160
And I'm like, what?

241
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm just like, what?

242
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,600
And I was like...

243
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,540
And I called them.

244
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,000
Because like on the internet, that's what it said when I was trying to book an appointment.

245
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,080
And then...

246
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,680
And then I called them, like called the customer support.

247
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,840
And I was like, hey, can I get an appointment with my branch to open my own business account?

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,940
And they're like, well, we don't do it by branch.

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,300
Sorry.

250
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,660
We got to do it by phone.

251
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,500
I'm like, what?

252
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,600
By phone?

253
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,460
But you can...

254
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,380
I mean, I give you my documents anyway.

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,580
So, by phone it is.

256
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,320
By phone it was.

257
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,420
And well, it's opened.

258
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,440
It's...

259
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,980
It's...

260
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,560
It's...

261
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,720
It's...

262
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,020
It's open.

263
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,120
At least now.

264
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,060
But yeah, that was...

265
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,280
And then they're like, no, you can't do it by phone.

266
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,980
And then I had another meeting I had to go to.

267
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,380
I had a separate other meeting that I had to go to.

268
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
It's a secret meeting.

269
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,340
So I can't say what it was.

270
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
But yeah, that was my day.

271
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,380
It was just full of meanings and like sadness.

272
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,420
And then right after that, my friends made me watch them play deadlock.

273
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,720
And so that was more sad.

274
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,400
.

275
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,020
.

276
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,160
.

277
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,500
The pain train never ends.

278
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,560
They're like...

279
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
They're like, do I play?

280
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,580
I was like, no, that's okay.

281
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,400
I'll just...

282
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,060
I'll just watch.

283
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,040
I'll just watch.

284
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,980
I know, guys.

285
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,480
I know I said I'll never...

286
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,700
I won't touch deadlock until it releases...

287
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,020
Until it publicly releases.

288
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,460
But sure, Fort Peer pressured me.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,020
I was talking to him and he was like, no.

290
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,120
No, Doki.

291
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,160
It's going to be the next big game.

292
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,220
He's like, I swear it's going to be the next big game.

293
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,800
Everybody is going to be playing it when it comes out.

294
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,380
It's going to be the next shooter game.

295
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,360
And he was like, there was 150 concurrent...

296
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,580
150,000 concurrent players yesterday.

297
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,080
And it's still on invitation only.

298
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,460
And it's the second most wishlist game.

299
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920
So you should really learn it.

300
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,040
It's really worth it.

301
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,760
And then I was like...

302
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,280
And then I'm just like, okay.

303
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,780
And he was like, you don't play MOBAs, right?

304
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,520
I was like, no.

305
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,780
And he was like, yeah, the moment you learn the MOBA mechanics, it'll be so easy.

306
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,740
You would love it so much.

307
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,320
And you'll get addicted to it.

308
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,260
I'm like, okay.

309
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,520
Okay.

310
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,250
I'm like, what are you...

311
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,670
Are you fucked?

312
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,530
I'm just like...

313
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,510
And you know, my expression is just like, okay.

314
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,470
Okay.

315
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,530
Okay.

316
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,890
Okay.

317
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,250
Okay.

318
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,770
Okay.

319
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,330
Okay.

320
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:53,650
Okay.

321
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,750
Okay.

322
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,790
I'm learning... I'm learning deadlock today.

323
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,530
Not today.

324
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,710
On Saturday.

325
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,430
And we'll see how it goes.

326
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,310
We'll see how long I last on deadlock.

327
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,450
It's just because I have no MOBA experience.

328
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,810
That's like the worst part.

329
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,370
I didn't grow up with MOBAs at all.

330
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,530
So it's like it's so hard to understand for me.

331
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:25,970
It's so hard because like sometimes it's either the games go... like nothing happens for like 15 to 20 fucking minutes.

332
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,490
Because like I played one game with my friends.

333
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,490
I think like three... two to three days ago.

334
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,030
I played one game with my friends two to three days ago.

335
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:46,150
And then like... and then like I was in the lane with one of them and literally nothing happened in that lane for 15 to 20 minutes.

336
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,210
We stayed there for...I... I swe cows I felt like I was going fucking crazy.

337
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,670
Like, all we did was just poke the enemy.

338
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,770
They don't do anything.

339
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,770
We can't do anything.

340
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,910
Because the moment we try to engage, they run away.

341
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,690
The moment they try to engage us, we run away.

342
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,730
And it's...

343
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,710
And I'm just like... I'm like I don't fucking know.

344
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,090
I was like I'm so bored.

345
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,470
I..

346
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,050
I was like...

347
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,150
I was like...

348
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,130
I'm so bored.

349
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,590
And like nothing happened.

350
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,470
Oh my god.

351
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,170
I swear I almost, I almost de-seed.

352
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,010
I almost like right click quit right there.

353
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,970
I like, I was so, oh my god.

354
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,290
And then we were at the same area.

355
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,910
The same fucking area for 15 to 20 minutes.

356
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,490
And I was like, I'm going fucking crazy.

357
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:52,130
I was literally gonna tab and right click and close.

358
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,090
I would have done it.

359
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,610
I was going fucking crazy.

360
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,410
Nothing was happening.

361
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,890
We literally fucking shot the same thing for so long.

362
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,310
I felt like I was a cog in the machine.

363
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:16,150
And then I hear my two, my two other friends fucking talking about the kills they're getting.

364
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,850
And how they're like, yeah, good job.

365
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,890
And I'm like, you guys are getting kills?

366
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,790
Like stuff is happening in your side?

367
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,990
What the fuck is going on on my side?

368
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:26,750
Why?

369
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,210
Like, I just, cause we're on, we're in a call.

370
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,390
We were force stacking.

371
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,450
And I'm like, you got kills?

372
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,210
What the fuck are we doing?

373
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,250
And I'm just like talking to my other friend, like the friend that was laying with me.

374
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,030
I'm like, what the fuck?

375
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,570
Why are they getting kills?

376
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,870
What are we doing?

377
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,430
I'm so fucking, I'm so confused.

378
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,690
Anyway, anyway.

379
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,890
And then after like we lost.

380
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,510
Um, my friends were just like, uh, yeah, you just didn't, you just didn't have the right build.

381
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,790
And I'm like, I don't fucking...

382
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,590
You just didn't have the right build.

383
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,230
And you didn't understand, you didn't farm enough.

384
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,390
And I'm like, what the fuck do you mean I didn't farm enough?

385
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,650
What do you...

386
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,310
I'm like, what does that mean?

387
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,350
What does it mean?

388
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,770
What does

389
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,680
that mean?

390
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm literally just shooting.

391
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,980
I'm literally the minion slash creep, whatever you call it.

392
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,700
Like, I just, I'm just...

393
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,240
How do I farm more?

394
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,960
How do I farm correctly?

395
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,080
I just...

396
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,020
I don't even know.

397
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't, I don't know.

398
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,840
Anyway, maybe Saturday will be better, guys.

399
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,680
Maybe, maybe Saturday will be like...

400
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,920
Maybe, maybe Saturday...

401
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Saturday will be different.

402
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,740
Yeah.

403
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,780
So yeah, that was...

404
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,120
That was...

405
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,980
That was my last couple of days.

406
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,680
Maybe, you know, maybe I'll Stockholm Syndrome my way into Deadlock by then.

407
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,600
By the time Deadlock fully comes out, maybe the Stockholm Syndrome will fully hit at that point.

408
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,380
Like...

409
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
Or like...

410
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,820
I would finally understand MOBAs.

411
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,620
Like, that's...

412
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,340
That's like honestly what I hope for.

413
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,020
Anyway...

414
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,980
Today we're gonna try and beat Wukong.

415
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,220
A lot of people are saying that that might not be impossible.

416
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,080
Because it's like the two hardest bosses in the game today.

417
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,160
So like...

418
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,000
This is gonna be a bit rough.

419
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,780
This is...

420
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,600
I mean, if I was able to beat Orphan of Cause...

421
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,500
Okay.

422
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,100
Is it more difficult than Orphan of Cause?

423
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,120
Or like...

424
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,580
Similar?

425
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,240
I need to know.

426
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
Is it similar?

427
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,860
Or like...

428
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,620
More?

429
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,060
Or like...

430
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,780
Less?

431
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,060
Or easier?

432
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,340
I just...

433
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,920
It's easier?

434
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,820
Okay, we're fine.

435
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,040
Then it won't take me six hours.

436
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,420
If it's...

437
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,960
I didn't even learn to parry, guys.

438
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,900
In Bloodborne.

439
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,180
I never learned to parry.

440
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,060
So...

441
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,320
So like...

442
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,720
It should be fine at that point.

443
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,000
If I never learned to parry...

444
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,520
For Orphan of Cause in Bloodborne...

445
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,440
I don't need to learn here.

446
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,460
I don't...

447
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,240
I...

448
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,600
I don't need...

449
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
I don't...

450
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
I don't need to learn here.

451
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,080
Okay.

452
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,980
Let's go.

453
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,740
Put it on...

454
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,500
Okay.

455
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,200
We'll see how this goes.

456
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,620
Chat.

457
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,260
Or...

458
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,580
Anyway.

459
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:09,940
We're...

460
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,840
We're gonna try and beat Wukong today.

461
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,900
That is our goal.

462
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,520
Actually, I didn't pay $60 to block.

463
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,120
Oh, I also bought the new Mickey...

464
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,520
The...

465
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,840
The remastered Mickey game.

466
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,380
Yes, I watched State of Play.

467
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,800
My opinion...

468
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,860
The only thing...

469
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,660
The only good announcement they did was Dynasty Warriors.

470
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,640
And even then, it's gonna be around...

471
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,020
I have to wait next year for it.

472
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,040
So, like, what's the point in life?

473
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,620
Other than that, it was pretty mediocre.

474
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,560
It was, like, 200,000 remasters.

475
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
As always.

476
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Oh, my God.

477
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,960
I forgot this area is so fucked.

478
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,620
I forgot.

479
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,640
I forgot.

480
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,960
This is the fucked area, too.

481
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,420
Okay.

482
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
What do I want?

483
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,060
I realized I never upgraded any of my stuff.

484
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,440
My stances.

485
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,700
Should I actually start?

486
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,660
Should I actually start upgrading my stances?

487
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,480
Nah.

488
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,710
Where the fuck are these?

489
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,210
Okay.

490
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,970
I don't know.

491
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,670
I don't know.

492
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,370
Hmm.

493
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,930
Oh, yeah.

494
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,610
The pole dance.

495
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,450
We don't want that.

496
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,620
Let's see.

497
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,640
Okay.

498
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,320
Okay.

499
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,910
I feel like...

500
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,390
I don't know if I actually need...

501
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,030
Do I need any...

502
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,570
I need to, like, upgrade any stances, though.

503
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,450
I personally like thrust.

504
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,570
Many say smash dance is good.

505
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,490
I haven't used the smash one in so fucking long.

506
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,770
Let's see.

507
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,310
Upon seeing and hitting the enemy with Resolute Strike.

508
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,090
When charging, perfect dodges.

509
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,170
Okay.

510
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,050
I don't know.

511
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,350
Because, like, I never actually had to use it in a way.

512
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,470
So, like, hmm.

513
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,270
It was never useful to me.

514
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,750
Yeah.

515
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,910
It's, like, the least mobile, too.

516
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,710
Why am I...

517
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,270
Okay.

518
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:24,490
Wait.

519
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,110
Wait.

520
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,670
Let me...

521
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,830
Let me double check real fast.

522
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,770
Let me double check.

523
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,230
I'm just...

524
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,570
I'm just double checking how fucked up I am right now.

525
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,410
Real quick.

526
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,430
Just...

527
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,690
Just double checking how...

528
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,670
If I'm okay at the moment.

529
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,470
I'm okay.

530
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,030
Like, I don't understand.

531
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,890
Like, I don't...

532
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,070
Okay.

533
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,470
Let me...

534
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,330
Give me a sec.

535
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,550
I'm gonna disappear a little bit real quick.

536
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,310
Oh, my God.

537
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,290
This is so annoying.

538
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,110
I don't know if it's because of the area.

539
00:25:59,450 --> 00:25:59,790
I...

540
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,310
Oh, I...

541
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,410
I closed the game.

542
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,130
My bad.

543
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,370
My bad.

544
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,270
I accidentally closed the game.

545
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,290
That's...

546
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,610
That's my bad.

547
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,010
I right-clicked close.

548
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,570
But...

549
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,390
No way.

550
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,870
We're off to a good start, chat.

551
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,410
We're...

552
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,230
We're...

553
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,490
We're off to a really good start right now.

554
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,230
Okay.

555
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,190
Things are...

556
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,730
Things are slowly getting better.

557
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,990
Things are slowly getting better.

558
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,230
Okay.

559
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,090
Let's see.

560
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,850
Okay.

561
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,410
Okay.

562
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,610
All right.

563
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,050
This should be fine.

564
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,090
Right?

565
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,290
Are you a-okay?

566
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,790
Are you a-okay, me?

567
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,670
All right.

568
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,110
Here we go.

569
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,530
Okay.

570
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,770
I should show up soon.

571
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,150
There we go.

572
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,170
All right.

573
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,030
Okay.

574
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,890
Where was I?

575
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,910
Brain melted already?

576
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,910
When you have, like, an one-hour-plus talk with the fucking bank?

577
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,310
Yeah.

578
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,110
Yeah.

579
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,390
Yeah.

580
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,670
No.

581
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,410
No.

582
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,190
The one hour plus talk with the bank really... really took me out of it.

583
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,950
Nothing happening for 50 minutes, isn't that Apex?

584
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:21,410
Oh, but at least... no, Apex it's like three to four minutes at least.

585
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,270
But like, no, the 15 minutes for...

586
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,430
Because at least like, when you see the enemy, somebody dies.

587
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,370
When I see the enemy, we just... we just fucking...

588
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,530
Like, fucking, I don't know, blow bubbles at each other.

589
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,090
Like, I swear.

590
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,090
Like, we fucking... we fucking blow bubbles at each other.

591
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,430
And then... and then... nothing.

592
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,550
That's how I feel.

593
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,270
Okay, let's see.

594
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,270
I have four, but I don't...

595
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,350
I have four, but I don't...

596
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,350
I have four, but I don't know.

597
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:05,630
I have four, but I don't...

598
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:05,630
I don't know.

599
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:05,930
I have four, but I don't know.

600
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,290
What to use?

601
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,370
I don't know.

602
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,390
After successful hit, performs this, unleashes a tactical retreat.

603
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,250
Let's see, the thrust stance.

604
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,170
Heavy...

605
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,930
S1 leverage is following, grants a massive focus upon hitting the enemy with Resolute Strike.

606
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,090
I don't know.

607
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,990
I'm just gonna grab this.

608
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,330
I'll grab this.

609
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,810
Wait, with significantly reduced damage.

610
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,650
Oh shit!

611
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,030
No!

612
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,490
Wait!

613
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,210
I'm getting rid of that.

614
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:51,550
Sorry, I didn't read the... I didn't read the last part.

615
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,810
I was like, whoa!

616
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,610
And then significantly reduced...

617
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,410
No, I don't want that.

618
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,130
I don't want that.

619
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,030
Get that out of here.

620
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,430
Reclaim.

621
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,730
I don't want that.

622
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,830
Yeah, but it like reduces the damage.

623
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,650
I love damage, chat.

624
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,890
Oh no.

625
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,690
Maybe I don't.

626
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,950
Maybe I just... I just don't.

627
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,470
I don't feel like I don't need to upgrade these.

628
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,950
Yeah, fuck it.

629
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,390
I tried to read a little bit, but I realized reading was a mistake.

630
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,710
There was no need to.

631
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,430
There was no need to keep reading.

632
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,010
Okay, critical hit.

633
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,910
I'll grab critical hit.

634
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,450
Each talent level significantly increases.

635
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,910
Each talent level significantly reduces.

636
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,570
Let's see.

637
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,930
I still have a lot, so...

638
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,150
I feel like I don't need to get that.

639
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,490
Immobilize.

640
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,570
You know what?

641
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,570
Maybe I'll grab more immobilize.

642
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,430
Yeah, I'll grab more immobilize.

643
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,610
And then that should be good.

644
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,950
Yeah, fuck it.

645
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,890
We'll go with that.

646
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,010
I think it's the area I'm in.

647
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,750
I think the area is just too pretty.

648
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,650
I'm pretty sure it's the area I am right now.

649
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,350
The area... There's too much stuff going on in this area.

650
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,250
There's no other reason.

651
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,290
I don't like how I did it.

652
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,410
There's no other reason.

653
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,390
It has to...

654
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:38,970
What?

655
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,350
How did it reset itself?

656
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,500
What?

657
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,040
When did this reset itself?

658
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,140
Okay, it's not... Okay, we figured it out.

659
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,140
We figured it out.

660
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Holy fuck.

661
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,380
I was like, man, why is this so fucked up?

662
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,220
It had to be, like, just today.

663
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,860
I was like, there's no way.

664
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,380
It was fine.

665
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,840
It was so fine last time.

666
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,440
No, this was literally today that it reset itself.

667
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,420
I don't even remember what my settings were.

668
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,020
I don't remember what my settings were, chat.

669
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't...

670
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,780
When did this happen?

671
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,720
When?

672
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,860
There was a patch today?

673
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,940
Oh, my God.

674
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,340
There was a patch.

675
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,120
I was like, what the fuck?

676
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,360
What happened?

677
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,840
Okay, what... I don't remember what was low.

678
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,860
I can't remember.

679
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,440
God, it makes so much more sense now.

680
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,680
It actually made so much more...

681
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,000
I was like, there's no way.

682
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Okay, now we should be better.

683
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,080
Okay.

684
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,200
Okay,

685
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,080
we're not better yet.

686
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,260
We're not better yet.

687
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,580
Guys, does anyone remember what our...

688
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,720
Oh, you need to restart it?

689
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,560
Okay.

690
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay, we're gonna restart it.

691
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,200
I was like, that's so fucking weird.

692
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,280
Because, like...

693
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,080
I was like, there's something wrong.

694
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,700
Because, like, the game was...

695
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,580
Last stream, we weren't lagging at all.

696
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,680
Third time's the charm, chat.

697
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,760
Guys, we're beating Wukong today.

698
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,940
We're beating...

699
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,400
Guys, we're beating Wukong today.

700
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,400
We're...

701
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,240
Hahaha.

702
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,420
Hahaha.

703
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,600
Hahaha.

704
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
Today's the day!

705
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,640
We just gotta figure out...

706
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,320
We are...

707
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,580
We just gotta figure out the...

708
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,700
The first...

709
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,460
The first difficulty is just fixing the settings.

710
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,380
Fixing the settings.

711
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,340
Guys, look, we're beating...

712
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,120
The moment we beat the hardest boss today, which is fixing the settings, it's over.

713
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,520
Guys, it's over for everybody.

714
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,500
Like...

715
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,840
Like, we win.

716
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,060
In the moment we fix the settings.

717
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,500
We fucking win.

718
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,600
The true final boss.

719
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah, the true final boss.

720
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,060
The goddamn settings.

721
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,500
This is it, guys.

722
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,500
This is it!

723
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,720
We will win when we fix this!

724
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,620
Okay.

725
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,580
Okay, this should be better now.

726
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,880
This...

727
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,420
This...

728
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,480
Okay.

729
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,320
There was no change.

730
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,200
Hahaha.

731
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,600
But...

732
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,960
I mean, it's a little better.

733
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:03,760
It's...

734
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,400
It's...

735
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,460
It's a little better, guys.

736
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,520
Okay, what were my other settings, guys?

737
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,400
What was it?

738
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:11,900
Hahaha.

739
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,900
What was it?

740
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,180
Was 70...

741
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,140
DLSS was 75%.

742
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,280
Okay, we got that.

743
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,560
Okay.

744
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,140
Okay, and then what?

745
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,180
Medium everything?

746
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,240
No, it was...

747
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,560
We had some that was medium.

748
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,300
I remember.

749
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,660
Um...

750
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,120
Alright.

751
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,280
Guys...

752
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,200
Guys, we need to fix the settings first!

753
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,100
Okay, turn down reflection.

754
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,900
Was it...

755
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,300
Was it reflection quality?

756
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,740
Okay, we'll put medium there.

757
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,220
And then...

758
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,920
Was it vegeta...

759
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,600
I don't remember.

760
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,360
Was it visual?

761
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,740
No, visual effects was alright.

762
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,360
Link, thank you for the super chat.

763
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you, thank you.

764
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,300
Welcome to tomato farm.

765
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,040
Welcome, welcome.

766
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,760
Alright.

767
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,960
What else?

768
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,140
Uh...

769
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,160
Was it shadow?

770
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,360
Well, yeah, we didn't care about shadows, right?

771
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:57,840
Okay.

772
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,720
Alright.

773
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,740
This is...

774
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,080
Uh...

775
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,620
This is...

776
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,480
I think that's good.

777
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,260
What is this?

778
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,620
Slightly increases attack?

779
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,000
I mean, that's pretty good.

780
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,380
Consider it deals damage to surrounding enemies upon considerably increasing...

781
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,880
Increases critical hit.

782
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,060
Um...

783
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,200
To avoid the next fatal blow.

784
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,780
Okay.

785
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,720
We like that.

786
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,400
Uh...

787
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,660
Guess we get...

788
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,520
Use the new item?

789
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,300
Uh...

790
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,020
Yeah.

791
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,340
Okay.

792
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,120
Uh...

793
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,080
Vegetation was low?

794
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,200
Was it?

795
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,920
I remember I wasn't high for the quality.

796
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,520
Um...

797
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,640
Let's see.

798
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,900
For the fatal blow to work?

799
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,380
Uh...

800
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,720
Okay.

801
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,180
Okay.

802
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,620
Alright.

803
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,440
So, I guess I'll put vegetation quality medium then.

804
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,140
And then that should be fine.

805
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,620
We should be okay now.

806
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,900
Oh, I set vegetation to low?

807
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,820
I'm pretty sure I set it to medium.

808
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,680
Because I was like, bro...

809
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,180
It's...

810
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,960
It looked so ugly if I did it.

811
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,580
I...

812
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,300
Okay.

813
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,980
I mean, if...

814
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,060
We don't use that, right?

815
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,800
I use the...

816
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,000
Increase attack then.

817
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,680
Increase experience.

818
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,180
Increase chance of obtaining weapons.

819
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,480
Increasing materials.

820
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,220
Uh...

821
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,620
Damage reductions for all burn.

822
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,580
Alright.

823
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,220
That's fine.

824
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,540
Oh, okay.

825
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:26,840
Now...

826
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,080
Okay.

827
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,620
We did it.

828
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,620
We did it, guys.

829
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,060
We fucking did it.

830
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,060
Oh my god.

831
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,760
We fucking did it, guys.

832
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,340
Let's fucking go.

833
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,820
We fixed it.

834
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,120
Can we fix it?

835
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,400
Oh, where do I go?

836
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,620
Oh my god.

837
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,680
We're finally playing the fucking video game.

838
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,160
Oh my god.

839
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh my god!

840
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,060
Team!

841
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
This is it.

842
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,380
It only took us thirty minutes.

843
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,480
But we're finally fixing...

844
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,140
We fixed it.

845
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,780
Oh, here's baby Buddha.

846
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,000
It's Buddha.

847
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,040
Hello Buddha.

848
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,920
We fixed...

849
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,160
Guys!

850
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,080
We beat the final boss.

851
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,540
Baby Buddha, why do you have so many polygons?!

852
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,940
Polygons!

853
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,680
What is that?

854
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,740
Oh no, not the snow!

855
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,180
That's more polygons!

856
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,380
My frames!

857
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,580
Every piece of snow takes more one of my frames!

858
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,280
The more snow it falls, the more frames I lose!

859
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,440
The particles!

860
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,540
Not the particles!

861
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
Alright, here we go.

862
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,340
Every snowflake is a unique model.

863
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,960
Okay, alright.

864
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,900
Oh my god.

865
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,820
Oh my god, I forgot how fucked up the snow was.

866
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,040
I forgot.

867
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,220
Holy shit.

868
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,200
What the fuck?

869
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,440
Oh, why is there so many of them?

870
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,520
Guys, sorry, we have not beat the final pause yet.

871
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,700
Guys, is that visual effect quality?

872
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,700
What is the snow?

873
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,460
What is the snow?

874
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,840
What is the snow?

875
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,700
Yeah, okay, I'm turning that to low.

876
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,460
Oh, my face.

877
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,980
We're at phase two of the boss fight.

878
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,620
Oh my god, get this fucking snow out of my fucking screen.

879
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,320
Oh my god.

880
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,660
That's phase two of the stupid snow particles.

881
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,020
Okay.

882
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,740
Alright, let's go.

883
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,200
Okay, it's a lot better.

884
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,740
See guys, when the snow disappears, we can actually move.

885
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,360
Alright, nice.

886
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,500
Why did they have to make each individual snow unique, a unique model?

887
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,780
That's so fucked.

888
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,200
That's so fucked.

889
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,220
Woo!

890
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,340
Okay.

891
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,600
I just need to remember how to play this game again.

892
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,780
Alright.

893
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,060
Wukong went west and finally arrived in Canada.

894
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,500
We're making it to Canada, guys!

895
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,140
We're making it!

896
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,020
Okay, we'll travel over.

897
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,480
Alright, here we go.

898
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,320
Oh my god, please.

899
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,920
I swear to god, every little snow my little monkey feet touches is fucking me up.

900
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,860
It's fucking me up.

901
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,060
Hello?

902
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,280
Oh, it's you!

903
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,980
Please.

904
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,520
I know you're beautiful, but please spare me some fucking frames.

905
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,460
Like, I...

906
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:37,680
I know you're supposed to be like one of the beautiful guys out there, but please, I really need my frames, Erlang.

907
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,640
I really...

908
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,160
I really need my frames.

909
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,180
Please stop taking them away.

910
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,200
Maybe that's the only way.

911
00:40:59,620 --> 00:40:59,660
Maybe that's the only way.

912
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,240
He has no choice.

913
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,620
I...

914
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,280
Oh, shit.

915
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,780
Wait, what?

916
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,960
Oh, shit!

917
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,020
Please!

918
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,200
Please!

919
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,860
Oh, fuck!

920
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,140
I can't...

921
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,620
My frames!

922
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,620
My frames!

923
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,100
Erlang, please!

924
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,300
Oh my god, wait!

925
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,240
Okay, we're gonna play...

926
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,380
Okay, phase three.

927
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,280
Okay, low.

928
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,720
I can't...

929
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,900
I can't see anything!

930
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,400
I literally can't even fucking...

931
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,100
Oh my god, I can't process anything!

932
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,180
Wait...

933
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,120
Oh my god!

934
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,120
Was it...

935
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,280
No, we're fine.

936
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,420
Oh my god, okay, we don't need to see their beautiful hair.

937
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,640
Okay, things are fine now.

938
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,900
Things should be fine now.

939
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,440
That's fucking right.

940
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,900
What you gonna do now?

941
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,760
That's fucking right.

942
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,880
That's fucking right!

943
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,280
Get over here!

944
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,880
Get your ass over here!

945
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,540
Oh, shit!

946
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm so sorry!

947
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,900
I'm so sorry!

948
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,320
I did not mean to do that, but I guess I'll whip you now.

949
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,760
I'm gonna whip!

950
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,620
Whip!

951
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,920
Whip it real good!

952
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,700
Whip!

953
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,020
Wait, why are you attacking?

954
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,140
Hey, you can transform too?!

955
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,540
Wait, that's not fair!

956
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,160
Oh, shit!

957
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,720
Oh, shit!

958
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,800
Okay, that's fine.

959
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,100
Whoa!

960
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,180
Whoa!

961
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,720
Fucking big baby time!

962
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,640
That's right!

963
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,560
Big baby time!

964
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,880
Oh, fuck!

965
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,360
Okay!

966
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,320
Okay!

967
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,340
Stance!

968
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,940
Okay, nice.

969
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,100
Oh, that's fine!

970
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,200
That's fine!

971
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,540
Oh, that's a lot of tigers!

972
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,520
That is a lot of tigers!

973
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,040
I mean, wolves!

974
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,740
Oh my god!

975
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,280
What?!

976
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,700
Sorry, but like...

977
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:26,900
What?!

978
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,260
What?!

979
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,720
He doesn't... Okay...

980
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,500
He can immobilize too?!

981
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,200
Alright, that's cheating, actually.

982
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,520
Alright, that's cheating, actually.

983
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,600
That's actually cheating.

984
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,040
That should not be allowed.

985
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,120
Wait, what?

986
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,480
Is that a grab?!

987
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,300
Oh my god, Erlang, please!

988
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,640
My frames are dying because of...

989
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,260
Like, I'm...

990
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,100
I don't know if you guys can notice it, but...

991
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,820
My frames are actually dying because of this fucker!

992
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,580
I...

993
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,500
I...

994
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,220
I...

995
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,840
What the fuck is that?!

996
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,160
And I dodged it!

997
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,140
Fuck!

998
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,060
Okay, that's out.

999
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,620
Okay!

1000
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,300
That hurts me?!

1001
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:17,920
Okay!

1002
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,960
Alright!

1003
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,800
Immobilize doesn't do jack shit, apparently.

1004
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,420
Now I know.

1005
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,180
Now I know.

1006
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,380
Alright.

1007
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,580
At least I know that now.

1008
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,160
Fuck you, Erlang.

1009
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,960
I know you won like 300 of our battles before, but like, this time it'll be...

1010
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,520
Guys, no!

1011
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
You don't understand.

1012
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,320
This time, I'm gonna win.

1013
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,400
But like, not this round, though.

1014
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,140
Not this round!

1015
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,180
Not this ta- Wait, he transforms when I tra- WHAT?!

1016
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,440
He transforms when I transform!

1017
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:54,880
Wait!

1018
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,880
That should be illegal!

1019
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,300
Oh my god, Erlang, please!

1020
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Do not make me play this- Play this fight in like- Guys, I'm actually- I might actually play this fight in low quality.

1021
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,200
Like- Like, at this point!

1022
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:25,260
That could not- It's just not- I can't see anything!

1023
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:36,020
Like- Like- Like- I can't- The phrase for this is- Okay.

1024
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:37,800
What?

1025
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,560
Like, I actually might have to.

1026
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,320
I- You know, I might actually have to.

1027
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,680
At this rate.

1028
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, fuck.

1029
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,980
Every time he parries me!

1030
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,320
That's right, not pretty anymore when you're fucking low quality, fish.

1031
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,120
That's fucking- Are you serious?!

1032
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,300
Please stop.

1033
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,100
I'm sorry.

1034
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,460
I'm so sorry.

1035
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,800
I'm so sorry.

1036
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,560
I didn't know you could do all that.

1037
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,020
Oh, haha!

1038
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,400
You missed, bitch!

1039
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

1040
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,400
I'm so sorry.

1041
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,320
Whoa!

1042
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,240
Whoa!

1043
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,900
That's alright.

1044
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,000
I got Cloud Step.

1045
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,820
And I'm fine with that.

1046
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,440
Oh!

1047
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,180
Okay.

1048
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,360
Guys, I just want you to know it's actually so difficult right now!

1049
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,540
Oh, that's fucking- Oh, I missed it!

1050
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,060
It's in real!

1051
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,380
Fuck, okay.

1052
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,720
Oh, no, I didn't mean to heal!

1053
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,520
This is so bad!

1054
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,940
I pressed the- I pressed the wrong button!

1055
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,000
Shoot!

1056
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,320
Okay.

1057
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,480
Yeah, that's right.

1058
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,140
Interrupt this, bitch.

1059
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,040
Interrupt this, you fucker.

1060
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,080
Fucking right!

1061
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,880
Interrupt this, and then big baby!

1062
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,640
Oh, oh no.

1063
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,500
Oh, what is that?

1064
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,900
What is that?

1065
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,360
What is that?

1066
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,860
What is that?

1067
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:08,860
What is that?

1068
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,380
Reload.

1069
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,940
I don't know what that is.

1070
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,220
What is that?

1071
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,620
Oh, Cloud Step!

1072
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,820
I don't know what that is.

1073
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,440
I don't know what- That hits me?!

1074
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,020
No!

1075
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,540
Oh, God.

1076
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,920
That's right.

1077
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,980
You can't transform when I'm here now.

1078
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,320
You can't transform now.

1079
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,720
Oh, he- Guys, he transformed.

1080
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,920
He transformed, guys!

1081
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,600
That's JP Liga!

1082
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,340
That's right.

1083
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,740
Can you transform this?

1084
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,220
Everybody deserves to get whipped!

1085
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,160
That's fucking rare life!

1086
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,360
It's whipping time!

1087
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,500
It's whipping time!

1088
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,760
Oh, my God.

1089
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,300
But I still am gonna start whipping!

1090
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,300
But I still am gonna start whipping!

1091
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,440
Goodbye.

1092
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,160
Cool.

1093
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,360
I'm running out of heals, guys!

1094
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,920
I'm running out of heals!

1095
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,420
No!

1096
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,400
That was such a good run!

1097
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,000
You know what?

1098
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,200
For first try, I think that was pretty decent.

1099
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,280
For first try, I think that was pretty decent.

1100
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,120
Okay.

1101
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,380
We're gonna do this fight at like the lowest graphic possible.

1102
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,940
I don't know what is wrong with him.

1103
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,980
But he actually takes up so much.

1104
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,920
Oh, my God.

1105
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,140
Okay, I need to make sure.

1106
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,300
Okay, let me make sure that I'm also on.

1107
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,280
Okay, I am on.

1108
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,760
I am on 280.

1109
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,440
Okay.

1110
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh, my God.

1111
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,900
It's a boss fight.

1112
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,340
Guys, I don't know if you guys could tell.

1113
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,800
But it was so fucking rough.

1114
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,580
Like...

1115
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,200
It was so rough, chat.

1116
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,460
It was so rough fighting this fucker.

1117
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,500
It was so rough fighting this fucker.

1118
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,860
I felt like I was fighting.

1119
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,160
With like...

1120
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,460
I have to predict the future.

1121
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,360
With like...

1122
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:35,580
With like...

1123
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,140
Oh, my God.

1124
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:40,920
Okay.

1125
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,120
Alright, here we go.

1126
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,120
No, no, guys.

1127
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:47,960
You don't understand.

1128
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,880
It was so fucking rough.

1129
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,320
Guys, you don't understand.

1130
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
You need vegetation on low.

1131
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:55,720
Okay.

1132
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,140
Is it not on low?

1133
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,560
He's just too beautiful, guys.

1134
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,400
Like...

1135
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,600
Guys.

1136
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,900
He's just too beautiful.

1137
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,880
Like, we gotta turn down these graphics, guys.

1138
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,820
Like...

1139
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,480
He's...

1140
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,000
He's too handsome, guys.

1141
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,480
Like...

1142
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,160
Majority of my frames went to boost up his...

1143
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,440
His fucking looks.

1144
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,260
Alright.

1145
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,280
Too beautiful for him to be rendered at this point.

1146
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:27,420
Too beautiful for him to be rendered at this point.

1147
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:27,480
Yeah.

1148
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,760
Okay, but what if I go first?

1149
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,260
I...

1150
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,580
That's fucked, bro.

1151
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:40,840
That's...

1152
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,100
That's...

1153
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,340
That's... Oh, wait.

1154
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,120
I still have it.

1155
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,400
Good.

1156
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,380
Okay.

1157
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,140
Now...

1158
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,160
Okay, I was gonna say it.

1159
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,460
That is so fucked.

1160
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,700
That is so...

1161
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,140
That is so...

1162
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,000
When he ran past the tornado?

1163
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,200
That should be illegal.

1164
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,620
That should be illegal.

1165
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:01,840
Here.

1166
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,540
It's time.

1167
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,960
It's time, guys!

1168
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,360
Guys!

1169
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,740
This is it!

1170
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,600
We gotta do this work together, monkeys!

1171
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,500
Work together!

1172
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,220
We gotta work together!

1173
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,800
We gotta work together!

1174
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,300
Get this out!

1175
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,680
Oh, shit.

1176
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,820
Okay, phase two.

1177
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,900
Oh, god.

1178
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,800
I run.

1179
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,560
I run.

1180
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,160
I run.

1181
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,700
I run.

1182
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,520
I run.

1183
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,480
Monkey together strong.

1184
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,840
Monkey together so strong.

1185
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,180
Can I use this?

1186
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,660
What?!

1187
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:46,940
Okay.

1188
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,180
You know what?

1189
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,960
Fuck you.

1190
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
It's whipping time.

1191
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,060
Okay, I just need to dodge this.

1192
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,900
That's right!

1193
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,440
I stay!

1194
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,880
Oh, wait.

1195
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,200
What?

1196
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,460
Wait, wait a minute.

1197
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,200
That's right.

1198
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,800
I'm gonna stay a horse.

1199
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,880
Of course!

1200
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,840
That's... oh, wait, again?

1201
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,840
Wait, that's not fair.

1202
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,880
Wait, what?

1203
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,080
You get to do that twice?

1204
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,640
I can only transform once!

1205
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,040
Whip!

1206
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,520
Whip!

1207
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,600
Whip!

1208
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,160
It doesn't matter if you're part of the heavenly court.

1209
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,400
Even politicians need to get whipped.

1210
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,100
Oh, shit.

1211
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,380
You think I don't know?

1212
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,500
You think I don't know about the secret whippings?

1213
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,600
I'm... okay, I'm sorry.

1214
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,640
Sorry.

1215
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,640
I'm so sorry.

1216
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,680
I'm so sorry!

1217
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,960
Okay.

1218
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,280
There's no way he sees me.

1219
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:43,820
Haha!

1220
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,160
You didn't see.

1221
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,120
He dodged Big Baby!

1222
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,860
Oh!

1223
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,800
He dodged Big Baby!

1224
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:54,780
How?!

1225
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,920
How am I doing worse?

1226
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,820
Oh my god, how am I doing worse?!

1227
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,700
Oh, shit!

1228
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,140
Okay.

1229
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,780
I don't understand.

1230
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,120
He has so many new movesets.

1231
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,540
It's... I'm off my groove!

1232
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,140
It's so...

1233
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,080
Oh, god.

1234
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,820
Oh, no!

1235
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:19,680
Oh, god.

1236
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:19,900
Okay.

1237
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,860
No, not again!

1238
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,340
Please don't grab me!

1239
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,380
I'm just a monkey!

1240
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,660
You have everything!

1241
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,840
You got the logs and everything!

1242
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,920
It's not fair!

1243
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,960
And now he's a bird?!

1244
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,020
It's not fair!

1245
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,920
Why do they give you so many moves?!

1246
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,680
Get grappled!

1247
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,320
I thought they nerfed grapplers!

1248
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,360
So not fair.

1249
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,380
They should not be allowed to do that.

1250
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,740
What the fuck?

1251
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,080
Okay.

1252
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,860
Guys, I don't think this is the right guys.

1253
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,220
Like, he does...

1254
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,060
Like, I can't, guys!

1255
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,510
Jesus Christ.

1256
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,970
Guys, this is my...

1257
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:15,210
Guys, I don't know why my first run was the best one out of all of this.

1258
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,230
Like, it got sidestepped.

1259
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:21,850
How?!

1260
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:22,450
HOW?!

1261
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,540
No, it's over.

1262
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,280
It's so over.

1263
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,540
It's so over.

1264
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:36,100
My first run was the best out of everything.

1265
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,660
This is not fair.

1266
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,100
He has so many cool moves, and I have, like... I'm just a monkey.

1267
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,840
I'm just...

1268
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,560
I'm just a fucking monkey.

1269
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,540
I don't understand.

1270
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,400
How do I dodge that?!

1271
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,340
That had to be fucking perfect!

1272
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,220
I'm not perfect like you!

1273
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,300
I'm sorry!

1274
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,200
That's my last heal!

1275
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,840
You fucker!

1276
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,240
I can't be perfect!

1277
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,140
Look at you!

1278
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,580
You take my friends!

1279
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,620
You take everything!

1280
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,060
What more do you want from me?!

1281
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,860
What more do you want?!

1282
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,760
You already have everything!

1283
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,020
I can't live with it!

1284
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,900
Oh my god.

1285
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,260
He took my frames!

1286
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,180
He took my graphics!

1287
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,320
He took my immobilized!

1288
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,800
What more does he want?!

1289
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,860
He wants your HP.

1290
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,480
Rose trash talking you.

1291
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,300
You're not him.

1292
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,540
It's time to show pretty boy you really are.

1293
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,540
We're not even the same species!

1294
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,920
Content warning.

1295
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,400
Thank you with the super chat.

1296
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,940
Thank you.

1297

Thank you.

1298
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,380
We're not...

1299
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,380
We're not even the same species!

1300
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,500
How can I be him when I'm not even him?!

1301
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,720
I'm over here.

1302
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,400
Where did my...

1303
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,640
Where's my tornado going?!

1304
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,380
It's over now.

1305
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,600
I'm gonna go in there and go home.

1306
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,120
I... I forgot to lock in from... from my misery.

1307
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,280
Bro, just bring- Bro, please, just get this over with.

1308
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:57,720
Bro, please, please, why are you fucking- Why are you playing with your food?!

1309
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,720
That's so... the fact that he like looked at me too after.

1310
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,900
Why did he have to play with the food after too, Chaos?

1311
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,280
Thank you for the five kiboshibs.

1312
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,720
Thank you.

1313
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,900
Okay, this time.

1314
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,360
This time it will be different.

1315
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,460
This time it will be different, guys.

1316
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,760
Okay.

1317
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,380
Okay, this time it doesn't count.

1318
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,640
This is the real third try.

1319
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,060
Okay, now.

1320
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,560
I locked in.

1321
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,620
Come on, head over.

1322
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,860
That's fucking right.

1323
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,740
I know you want to.

1324
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,700
That's fucking right, you bitch, you whore.

1325
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,180
God, that's right.

1326
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,120
That's fucking right here.

1327
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,240
Now what you gonna do, you whore?

1328
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,740
That's fucking right.

1329
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,680
You might be beautiful, but you have 20,000 versions of you?

1330
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,640
I don't think so.

1331
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,900
That's right.

1332
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,060
It's not just about the looks.

1333
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,300
The ladies also want 300 versions of me.

1334
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,200
That's right.

1335
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,660
I can compensate via other means.

1336
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:23,980
Great.

1337
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,960
Great.

1338
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,220
What I learned is I just keep running.

1339
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,580
Just keep running.

1340
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,400
Oh, nice.

1341
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:30,800
Okay.

1342
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,600
Alright, that's fine.

1343
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,760
It's fine.

1344
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,200
Big baby!

1345
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,560
That's fucking right!

1346
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,860
Big baby works!

1347
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,040
Now it's whip time!

1348
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,520
I don't care about your fucking giant axe.

1349
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,260
Okay, I care about that, though.

1350
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,600
That tiger is scary, though.

1351
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,240
But I still don't care about your giant axe.

1352
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,880
Get over here!

1353
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,700
Fucking unchanged right now!

1354
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
That's right!

1355
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:58,980
That's...

1356
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,400
Oh, ow.

1357
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,780
Okay.

1358
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,620
I'm gonna...

1359
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,960
Electricity.

1360
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,560
It's time for your appointment, Erlon.

1361
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,440
It's time for your fucking appointment!

1362
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:19,240
Just because you think you are too beautiful for this, nobody is too beautiful for the fucking whip!

1363
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,800
Okay, we're fine.

1364
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
Oh, nice.

1365
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,920
Okay, nice.

1366
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,440
We dodged that.

1367
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:27,960
Oh, shit!

1368
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,760
Okay, we almost dodged that.

1369
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:30,820
How?!

1370
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,560
Alright.

1371
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:32,980
Let's follow here.

1372
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,160
I'll reload.

1373
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,040
Okay, I...

1374
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,400
I don't know how I could miss that because it was right in front of me.

1375
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,700
But it's alright.

1376
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,660
Not everybody was born like him.

1377
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,980
Okay, there's no way he can sidestep this.

1378
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,640
I...

1379
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,540
There is a way, guys.

1380
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,380
There...

1381
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,000
There is a way and he proved it just now.

1382
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,640
He proved it just now.

1383
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,920
Okay, nice.

1384
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,260
Oh, fuck.

1385
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:04,720
Not nice.

1386
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:07,740
How?!

1387
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,380
How?!

1388
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,320
There we go.

1389
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,820
Ha, you didn't see that, did you?

1390
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,660
Oh, alright.

1391
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:18,820
I saw that, though.

1392
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,540
Okay, that's good.

1393
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:20,900
That's good.

1394
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,380
We're okay.

1395
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,480
Dodged.

1396
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:23,680
Oh.

1397
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,780
Okay, he...

1398
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,940
He didn't need to dodge that.

1399
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,360
He absolutely didn't need to dodge that, but that's okay.

1400
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,300
Alright, nice.

1401
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,820
He didn't parry!

1402
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,920
He didn't parry!

1403
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,540
That's right, you're not perfect!

1404
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,240
He can bleed!

1405
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,620
He's...

1406
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,080
He's not as perfect as you think he is!

1407
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,500
Thank God!

1408
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,480
Okay.

1409
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,480
Yeah.

1410
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:51,940
There you go.

1411
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,080
There you go.

1412
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:53,980
Okay.

1413
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:54,360
He...

1414
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,180
He did the thing again.

1415
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,360
That's okay.

1416
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,560
I don't know what to do when he does that, but that's okay.

1417
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,340
Whoa!

1418
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,540
Whoa!

1419
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,040
Maybe go run up to them?

1420
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,700
So, like, he can't look down?

1421
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,200
Haha!

1422
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,400
You can't look down if I'm behind you!

1423
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,340
That's right!

1424
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:09,820
Where am I?

1425
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,200
I'll never tell!

1426
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,060
Oh.

1427
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,520
Wait.

1428
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,760
Wait, wait, wait.

1429
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,660
Wait, wait, wait.

1430
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,220
What do I do here?

1431
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,240
What do I do here?

1432
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:16,560
Ah!

1433
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:17,860
No!

1434
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:19,760
Ah!

1435
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,550
I did it!

1436
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,790
I did it!

1437
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:29,170
I did it!

1438
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:29,490
I did it!

1439
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,050
I did it!

1440
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:30,310
Oh, yeah.

1441
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:30,930
Staff spin.

1442
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,130
The move I never use.

1443
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,930
It's been...

1444
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,470
Finally, after 20 years.

1445
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:35,930
We...

1446
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:40,290
After 20 years, we can finally use the staff spin.

1447
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,030
We...

1448
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,150
I forgot this move existed.

1449
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,810
Not gonna lie.

1450
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,770
Chat forgot about this move's existence.

1451
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,370
All right.

1452
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,790
Alright, okay, we figured it out.

1453
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,790
We figured it out.

1454
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,750
The sun is a powerful laser.

1455
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,270
Alright.

1456
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,130
We figured it out, guys.

1457
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,190
We figured it out.

1458
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,670
It's time.

1459
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,090
Pornado!

1460
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,910
I locked on too, so he's gonna...

1461
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:12,630
Come on.

1462
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,570
That's fucking right.

1463
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,790
I know you wanna walk into this.

1464
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,430
That's right, bitch.

1465
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:16,950
Bitch.

1466
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:19,630
That's right.

1467
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,030
That's fucking right.

1468
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,070
Here!

1469
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,410
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

1470
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,070
That's... Monkeys, please.

1471
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,070
Please be faster.

1472
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:30,970
Monkeys, I need...

1473
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,350
Monkeys, please.

1474
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:37,270
I need you to... Monkeys, I see one of you just standing there!

1475
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:38,610
Why are you healing?

1476
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,470
He didn't even hit you back!

1477
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,090
The whisper.

1478
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,530
I saw it, then what if I'm healing?

1479
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,670
But it's like, why do you need a heal?

1480
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,250
But it's like, why do you need a heal?

1481
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,450
Wait, where did he go?

1482
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,410
He didn't even hit back yet!

1483
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,230
So there was no point in healing there!

1484
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:57,770
So there was no point in healing there!

1485
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,490
There's actually no point...

1486
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:03,450
There's no way to side...

1487
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,110
Alright, there is a way sometimes for him to sidestep.

1488
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,670
And I figured out...

1489
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:12,890
There was a way for him to do it.

1490
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,050
Okay, nice.

1491
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,030
Oh, nope.

1492
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,730
Haha, whatcha gonna do now?

1493
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:19,830
Now that I am a...

1494
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,750
Now that I'm a horse?

1495
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,570
Now that he's also a...

1496
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:24,930
No!

1497
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,170
Oh, there we go!

1498
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:28,890
That's fucking right.

1499
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,410
Get over here.

1500
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:31,090
Untransform now!

1501
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,110
That's right.

1502
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:34,830
That's right.

1503
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,390
Untransform now!

1504
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,910
Oh, you think I'm scared of you?

1505
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,310
That's right.

1506
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:42,590
I'm hot too now.

1507
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:44,810
Oh, okay.

1508
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,670
But like, he still hits really hard.

1509
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:49,990
That's right.

1510
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,690
Now the ladies find me hot as well.

1511
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,250
Oh, shit.

1512
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:56,670
It's fine.

1513
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,150
We're fine.

1514
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,490
Everything is...

1515
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:58,990
Okay.

1516
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,870
I think I can do hits here.

1517
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:02,210
Woo!

1518
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,350
It's okay.

1519
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,770
Oh, not okay!

1520
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:06,850
Not okay!

1521
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:08,610
Okay.

1522
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,410
There we go.

1523
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:12,290
We're fine.

1524
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,850
We're not fine.

1525
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,510
Oh, pow!

1526
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:16,950
Pow!

1527
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:17,670
No!

1528
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:19,830
No!

1529
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,270
Please!

1530
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,370
Please, I'm lazy!

1531
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:22,970
Oh, god.

1532
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,070
Okay.

1533
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,790
We gotta hydrate.

1534
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,590
Okay, I know like...

1535
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,430
He parries if I hit too much.

1536
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,850
So I'm gonna try to make sure not to parry.

1537
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:32,390
No!

1538
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,150
It stuck his spear in me!

1539
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:39,010
Come on!

1540
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,850
Oh, it's somebody's birthday!

1541
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:42,950
Guys, give me a sec!

1542
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:45,090
When I die, I'll sing you happy birthday!

1543
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,130
Cause we all know we're not winning this fight!

1544
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:47,950
We all...

1545
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,350
I can tell this...

1546
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,610
We're not winning this one.

1547
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:54,690
This round.

1548
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,190
I can so tell.

1549
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,890
I don't know his patterns fully yet too.

1550
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,950
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1551
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:06,150
Oh, yeah.

1552
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,790
No, this is not the it.

1553
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,210
I'm still trying to download him.

1554
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,310
Oh, my god!

1555
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,350
I don't know his attack patterns!

1556
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,610
It's so fucking weird!

1557
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:20,970
No!

1558
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:25,870
His what?!

1559
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,810
I knew he isn't!

1560
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,110
His pattern is such a fucking weird pattern!

1561
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,330
There's no way!

1562
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,310
Okay, there is a Okay.

1563
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,930
That's fucking right.

1564
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,370
What?!

1565
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,670
You don't have a shield!

1566
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:49,870
That's illegal!

1567
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:53,870
You're just gonna...

1568
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:54,330
Okay!

1569
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,490
Where are they?

1570
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,290
Oh, there you go.

1571
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:02,290
Okay, I was like, where the fuck are they?

1572
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,290
Like, okay.

1573
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,370
Okay.

1574
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,930
Alright, he's gonna do that thing.

1575
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,150
What's the...

1576
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,710
Okay.

1577
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,350
I'm fucking...

1578
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:19,130
I let go my finger!

1579
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,050
I...

1580
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,610
I let go!

1581
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,060
I fucking...

1582
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,660
I let go for one frame!

1583
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,300
That's actually crazy!

1584
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,060
I can't believe!

1585
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,020
Okay.

1586
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,300
RainbowCloud, thank you for the super chat!

1587
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,380
Thank you, thank you!

1588
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,140
Today is my birthday!

1589
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,180
Can I get a song, please?

1590
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,780
And thank you, of course, Rainbow!

1591
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,880
Thank you for your favorite super chat!

1592
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,760
Thank you, thank you!

1593
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,880
Happy birthday to you!

1594
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,300
Happy birthday to you!

1595
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,700
Happy birthday, dear Rainbow!

1596
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,860
Happy birthday to you!

1597
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,460
Yeah!

1598
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:16,640
I can't believe I let go I let go like one second, and then I accidentally like fucking...

1599
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,520
I...

1600
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,060
Oh my god!

1601
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,960
I'm so fucking stupid!

1602
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,420
I...

1603
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,080
Holy shit!

1604
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:33,080
That's actually crazy that just happened!

1605
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,840
I can't believe it!

1606
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:38,920
Why?

1607
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:39,720
Why am I...

1608
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,000
Why am I like this?

1609
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:42,820
Why?

1610
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,340
Oh my god!

1611
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,380
Oh my god!

1612
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:49,740
Wow!

1613
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,660
How did you... I'm the real monkey!

1614
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,300
There's like 200 of us!

1615
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,450
Where is he?

1616
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:02,730
Okay.

1617
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,150
That's right.

1618
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,930
That's right, I run straight.

1619
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:06,990
You guys can't get me.

1620
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,670
That's fucking right.

1621
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,050
Oh yeah!

1622
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,450
I got the horse again!

1623
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,750
Now, nay for me, Erlang!

1624
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:17,790
Oh!

1625
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:21,370
Okay, now, nay for me, Erlang!

1626
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,650
You think I'm scared of you?

1627
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,670
The ladies love me just as much as they love you now!

1628
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,270
Oh shit!

1629
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:31,910
Hey, that's not fair!

1630
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,010
That's fucking right!

1631
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,270
I have the power of electricity on my side!

1632
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:41,010
Erlang!

1633
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:48,370
You might have won 90% of the fights in Journey to the West, but this time it'll be different.

1634
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:53,070
Because this time I have a monkey and a horse by my side.

1635
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:54,590
Okay.

1636
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:55,410
That's good.

1637
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,330
It's gonna be different, guys.

1638
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,270
Okay, not now.

1639
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,850
Now it's gonna be different, guys.

1640
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,610
Now it's gonna be different!

1641
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,330
Now it's gonna be different!

1642
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:09,310
Right here!

1643
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:09,590
Right here!

1644
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,590
Oh!

1645
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,130
Not here yet!

1646
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,670
But like, right here!

1647
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,410
Right here!

1648
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:18,750
It's gonna be different here.

1649
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,010
What the fuck!

1650
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:24,730
Oh shit!

1651
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,050
Okay.

1652
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:27,210
What?!

1653
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,550
That's illegal.

1654
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,890
That was an illegal move, right?

1655
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,850
That is such an illegal move!

1656
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,830
I refuse to believe that is a...

1657
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:42,250
that the referee didn't see that.

1658
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:44,310
Like, I'm pretty sure...

1659
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,270
I'm pretty sure he bribed the ref...

1660
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,210
WHAT?!

1661
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,230
I'm pretty sure he bribed the ref.

1662
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,350
There's no fucking way.

1663
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,290
In the rules, he's not allowed to do that.

1664
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,030
And he turns into an eagle!

1665
01:09:58,450 --> 01:09:59,010
Okay.

1666
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,910
And he pokes!

1667
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:02,190
And he pokes!

1668
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:02,190
Okay.

1669
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:06,190
It's not in the regulations!

1670
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:10,830
I literally need... what?!

1671
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,770
I literally need wood!

1672
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:12,910
Erlon, please!

1673
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,270
Oh my god...

1674
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,730
He's...he's killing me right now isn't he?

1675
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,570
Oh my god.

1676
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:22,010
Okay.

1677
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,170
Okay, but like, there's no way he dodges this.

1678
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,510
Yeah.

1679
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,410
Okay, thank God.

1680
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,250
Okay.

1681
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:28,890
Okay.

1682
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:28,890
Okay, thank God.

1683
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:28,890
Okay.

1684
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:28,890
Okay.

1685
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:28,970
Okay.

1686
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:31,330
Thank god, I was going to be worried that he was going to die.

1687
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,530
It felt like he was.

1688
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:34,910
At that point.

1689
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,930
Sometimes I don't know when I can use...

1690
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,530
Okay.

1691
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,190
Oh no, it's happening again.

1692
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:44,690
It's happening again.

1693
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:47,270
Okay.

1694
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,490
It's happening again, guys!

1695
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,290
It's happening again!

1696
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:54,810
Okay.

1697
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:56,950
Where is he?

1698
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:58,670
Wait.

1699
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,150
Oh, that was an accident.

1700
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,790
Where is he?

1701
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:03,530
Oh.

1702
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,450
Oh, this is bad.

1703
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:06,230
I ran...

1704
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:11,820
This is so bad.

1705
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,760
I had a feeling it was going to be bad.

1706
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,440
I had a feeling.

1707
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:16,940
Horse time!

1708
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,200
What?

1709
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,100
Oh, we transformed!

1710
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,180
That's fucking right!

1711
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,860
I still have the power of the horse!

1712
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,400
Alright.

1713
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,640
Oh, thank god for the invincibility frames on horseman.

1714
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,420
Thank god.

1715
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,480
What the fuck, though?

1716
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,120
What the fuck?

1717
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,440
Stop!

1718
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,320
Stop!

1719
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,260
Just stop!

1720
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,680
Stop doing what you're doing!

1721
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,560
No way.

1722
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,080
There's no way.

1723
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,800
No way.

1724
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,200
God damn it.

1725
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,540
What does this do?

1726
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,720
I forgot what that does, guys!

1727
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,880
I forgot what that does!

1728
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:09,760
Okay.

1729
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,480
Okay!

1730
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,820
Oh god, okay.

1731
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:19,720
No!

1732
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:27,250
Wait!

1733
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,650
What does this do?!

1734
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,270
I swear!

1735
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,030
Are you fucking...

1736
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:34,850
Fucking...

1737
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,850
Oh my god!

1738
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,530
It just never stops!

1739
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:41,930
It just...

1740
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:43,010
It just...

1741
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,270
That's the fun secret, Doki!

1742
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,370
It never fucking stops!

1743
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:48,830
You...

1744
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:52,030
No way!

1745
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,790
No way!

1746
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,110
No way!

1747
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,150
No fucking way!

1748
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:00,330
No fucking way!

1749
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:04,010
No fucking way!

1750
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,010
Please.

1751
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:08,790
Oh, thank god.

1752
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,630
God had mercy on me today.

1753
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:19,010
God actually gave me mercy today.

1754
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,730
It was like...

1755
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,990
The dread.

1756
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,470
And I'm like, you finally answered my call.

1757
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,230
Jesus Christ!

1758
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,530
Oh my god!

1759
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,170
Are you fucking kidding me?

1760
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:38,570
Are you fucking kidding me?

1761
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:39,750
Oh my god!

1762
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,790
I hate him so much!

1763
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,190
I hate him so much!

1764
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:44,850
Oh!

1765
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,610
Oh please!

1766
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,030
You have twenty hundred swords!

1767
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,850
How much more do you want?!

1768
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,670
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it here.

1769
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,070
It's over.

1770
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:57,770
It's over.

1771
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,030
It's so over.

1772
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,050
I...

1773
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,270
No more heals, guys!

1774
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,870
Goodbye!

1775
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:08,390
What a way to go!

1776
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:11,850
What a way to go!

1777
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,650
What a way to go!

1778
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,330
A bit more.

1779
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:22,430
Oh my god!

1780
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,470
It was so close!

1781
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:25,930
Okay.

1782
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,530
I think...

1783
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,670
I have more chi, I think.

1784
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,150
To power up my...

1785
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:33,610
Wait, okay.

1786
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,770
What gives more chi, guys?

1787
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:39,570
What gives more chi?

1788
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,330
I think we need...

1789
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:44,590
Okay, we don't need immobilize.

1790
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,210
Immobilize fucking sucks.

1791
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,410
Oh my god.

1792
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:54,410
Okay.

1793
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,190
Uh...

1794
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,450
I'm gonna get rid of immobilize.

1795
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:00,870
That fucking sucks.

1796
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,790
I'm gonna fucking get rid of all of you.

1797
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,250
Okay.

1798
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,990
Uh...

1799
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,230
I wanna use...

1800
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,250
Launcher's...

1801
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,290
Strike...

1802
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,130
What gives chi?

1803
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,210
I need a no.

1804
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:21,870
I need to get it so I can have the fan.

1805
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,630
My fan is building up too slow.

1806
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,770
Is there anything that gives me more?

1807
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:34,910
Rock parry spell?

1808
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:35,830
Does that...

1809
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,650
Guys, I'm not gonna parry.

1810
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:38,590
Guys!

1811
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:42,330
Guys, I'm...

1812
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,670
You know damn well I'm not gonna parry, guys.

1813
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,170
What if I put it all in critical hit?

1814
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,290
Critical hit.

1815
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:49,750
Okay, critical hit.

1816
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,870
And then attack.

1817
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:54,810
Okay.

1818
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,470
Critical hit and attack.

1819
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,110
There we go.

1820
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:58,850
And then...

1821
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,990
Someone said there's like...

1822
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:04,370
Uh...

1823
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:06,910
Let's see...

1824
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:10,530
And the chi spirit.

1825
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,570
Chi spirit.

1826
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:12,110
What is that?

1827
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:15,390
Someone said the golden...

1828
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:15,710
Okay.

1829
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:21,250
Upon critical hits, defeat and defeats grants a small amount of chi.

1830
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:22,170
I need all four.

1831
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:22,850
No!

1832
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,030
But my...

1833
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,090
My armor is so cool!

1834
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,630
But my armor is so cool!

1835
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,110
My armor is so cool!

1836
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,070
It's like, look at how little defense this is!

1837
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:42,510
It's like, look at how little defense this is!

1838
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,770
Look how little defense!

1839
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:48,030
Look how little defense!

1840
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,690
We need time to use...

1841
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:55,590
Say goodbye to the trip.

1842
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:56,170
Say goodbye to the trip.

1843
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:00,310
Wait, my critical rate is 4%?

1844
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,410
So your point... Are you serious?

1845
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,130
How do I up my critical hit?

1846
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,320
How do I up my critical hit?

1847
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,960
It's drip or drown.

1848
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,560
It's drip or drown.

1849
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,320
Wait, how do I up my critical hit?

1850
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,480
Wait, how do I up my critical hit?

1851
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:17,940
Oh, drinks?

1852
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:18,580
Okay.

1853
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,860
Oh, drinks?

1854
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:20,860
Okay.

1855

01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:05,600
Don't I?

1870
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,580

01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:10,100
There's a crit chance in talents.

1872

01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:16,740
Nothing can be prettier than me.

1876
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:23,140
We can't let the pretty boy win.

1877
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,260
There's only one pretty monkey here.

1878

01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,240
B mountain.

1891
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:56,820
Okay.

1892
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,360

1895
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,620
And then, is there a critical hit?

1896
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,200
Oh, there you go!

1897
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,020

01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,540
There's none.

1901
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,300

1905
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,380
I don't think I have that.

1906
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,140
Tiger relic.

01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,260
Tiger tea.

1916
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,680

01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:12,860
I thought you meant it's in game.

1920
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,780
I was like...

1921
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,640

1922
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:20,860

1941
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,360
know what else to do.

1942
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,940
He has everything.

1943
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,260
He even has the celestial core.

1944
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:16,220
He even has the celestial core.

1945
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,980
He took everything from me.

1946
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,000
He took everything from me.

1947
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000

01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,920
I don't want to upgrade this.

1954
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:56,660

01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,620
Wait, how come I can't get this?

1958
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,870
What the fuck?

01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,430
How can I get this?

1960
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:16,890
Can I craft this?

1961
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,270

And then we craft this.

1971
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,580
Alright, here we go.

01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,160
Guys, what do I not need?

2043
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,460
What do I not need?

2044
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,920
I don't know what I don't need, guys.

2045
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,040
I don't know what I don't need, guys.

2046
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,280
I don't know.

2047
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,700
I mean, I don't have anything on either of these.

2048
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,440
I mean, I don't have anything on either of these.

2049
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,700
Take off the thrust stance?

2050
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,460
Wait, somebody said thrust is good.

2051
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:16,240
Wait, somebody said thrust is good.

2052
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,620
Thrust or smash.

2053
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,220
Okay, we're gonna go with...

2054
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,980
We're gonna go with thrust in.

2055
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,200
Wait, I need to go back.

2056
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,300
I forgot I can't do it here.

2057
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,660
Okay, where's my stride?

2058
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:35,520
There it is.

2059
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,500
Alright, cut.

2060
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:40,000
What happened to you, Wukong?

2061
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,580
You had such good drip.

2062
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,960
You had such good drip.

2063
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,800
Do you wanna win or not?

2064
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,080
Do you wanna win or not?

2065
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,480
Alright, let's see.

2066
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,880
Yeah, but I wanna look cool while I'm winning.

2067
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:02,180
Yeah, but I wanna look cool while I'm winning.

2068
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:02,840
Cool though.

2069
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,060
Okay.

2070
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,520
I don't have enough.

2071
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,360
So I'll take it off this and put it in here.

2072
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:12,820
There we go.

2073
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:13,660
Alright.

2074
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:16,680
There we go.

2075
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,020
I wanna look cool.

2076
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,540
But I'm gonna beat him up.

2077
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,220
Alright, here we go.

2078
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:27,840
This is it.

2079
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,240
Like, he has everything.

2080
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,600
All I had was my drip.

2081
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,540
Now I have nothing.

2082
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,980
Stop it.

2083
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,160
All I had were my cool-ass drip.

2084
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,640
And now...

2085
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,700
Now I don't have either.

2086
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:53,520
Stop it.

2087
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,000
What the fuck?

2088
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,260
How did you run away from that?

2089
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,140
What?

2090
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,240
I should have hit him.

2091
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:01,300
Why did I hit him?

2092
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:07,240
He actually fucking ran away from my tornado.

2093
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,420
That's not fair.

2094
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,720
How did he do that?

2095
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,700
How the fuck did he do that?

2096
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,200
Okay, that's fine.

2097
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,420
Oh shit.

2098
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:29,680
Shit.

2099
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,560
Alright.

2100
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,900
Now I know what...

2101
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,920
Oh my god, bro.

2102
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,640
I didn't...

2103
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,320
I didn't realize he was done.

2104
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,940
What the fuck?

2105
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,940
Horse time.

2106
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:55,520
Horse.

2107
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,240
Horse.

2108
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:57,880
Whip.

2109
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,360
That's fucking right.

2110
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,440
Oh, you bring a tiger?

2111
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,360
That's right, you missed.

2112
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:04,700
Bitch!

2113
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,800
You can't miss a whip, though!

2114
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,460
You can't miss a whip!

2115
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:15,280
Yeah?

2116
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,900
That's fucking right.

2117
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,840
Five o'clock appointment.

2118
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,800
And your six o'clock appointment.

2119
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,040
You booked the whole night, man.

2120
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,040
Man, you seem fucking stressed.

2121
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,240
Booking the whole night?

2122
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:30,780
Okay.

2123
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,800
I still don't know when to time this.

2124
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:34,120
Okay.

2125
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,900
I don't know how to time that.

2126
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm sorry, guys.

2127
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,060
I'm so confused.

2128
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,600
Guys, can you tell I'm confused?

2129
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,800
Can you tell?

2130
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,800
Is it noticeable?

2131
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,240
Is it noticeable?

2132
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,260
Oh, my God.

2133
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,500
Win!

2134
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:00,980
Shit!

2135
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,160
Yes, that's freaking right!

2136
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,220
Oh, thank God.

2137
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:05,660
Oh, thank God.

2138
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,700
I'm so happy.

2139
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,240
I'm so happy.

2140
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,040
I got the win.

2141
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,920
I got the...

2142
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,520
Never mind.

2143
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:16,200
No win, more win.

2144
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,040
He said no win.

2145
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,100
I was like, you're right.

2146
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,720
You're so right.

2147
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,540
You're so... Oh, my God.

2148
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,160
You're so right.

2149
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,540
How dare I thought.

2150
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,260
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2151
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:32,700
I don't know what to do.

2152
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,660
Oh, you can sidestep my poke?

2153
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,000
Okay.

2154
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:42,620
Okay, there you go.

2155
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:42,900
We're fine.

2156
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,740
Okay, I need a heal, though.

2157
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,540
So I'm not that fine, though.

2158
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,060
Spin, spin, spin.

2159
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,580
Okay.

2160
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,080
Someone said spin, but I don't know if it's actually working.

2161
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,560
I don't know.

2162
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,240
Oh, my God.

2163
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:58,800
Okay.

2164
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:00,480
Okay.

2165
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,240
I don't know if it's actually working, guys.

2166
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:05,860
I don't know if it's actually working, guys.

2167
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,960
Oh, no.

2168
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,220
Please stop.

2169
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:14,700
That's right.

2170
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,640
Baby.

2171
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,400
Oh.

2172
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:19,920
Oh, no.

2173
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,960
Now it's the children.

2174
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,920
Now it's two of them.

2175
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:24,900
Whoo.

2176
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:26,500
Whoo.

2177
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,260
Whoo.

2178
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:33,380
If I'm underneath him, he can't see me, but I also can't see anything, too.

2179
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,980
It's so weird.

2180
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:37,700
Wait.

2181
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,360
Am I spinning?

2182
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,360
Am I spinning?

2183
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,240
I am.

2184
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:42,600
Okay.

2185
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:43,940
Poke.

2186
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,040
Oh, okay.

2187
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:48,780
I didn't poke anything.

2188
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,200
Okay.

2189
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,220
Okay.

2190
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,620
That's fine.

2191
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:55,900
That's fine.

2192
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,000
I don't need to poke anything, I guess.

2193
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,460
Oh, my God.

2194
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,280
Please.

2195
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,900
Please give me time.

2196
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:05,800
Please.

2197
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:09,920
Win.

2198
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,900
That's right, bitch.

2199
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:17,320
I'm the kid you made fun of in high school.

2200
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,040
Oh, what?

2201
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:21,940
What?

2202
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:24,840
Oh.

2203
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,560
Okay.

2204
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,500
Bye.

2205
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,320
That's right.

2206
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,580
You're gonna regret this.

2207
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,220
I'm gonna regret this.

2208
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,940
I'm gonna regret this.

2209
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:38,980
You're right.

2210
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,400
How dare I?

2211
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,300
Okay.

2212
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,760
You can fight.

2213
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,240
Oh, my God.

2214
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,800
No, please.

2215
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,540
Let me heal at least, and then you can do whatever the fuck you want.

2216
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:58,980
Okay.

2217
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,180
Okay, nice.

2218
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:01,640
Nice dodge.

2219
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,840
Oh, shit.

2220
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:04,500
That's fine.

2221
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,900
That is a-okay.

2222
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,080
I have this.

2223
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,200
And I can do...

2224
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,840
Oh, I cannot do that.

2225
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:12,880
He's...

2226
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,500
He can stop.

2227
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:16,800
I...

2228
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,960
Why?

2229
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,540
I guess not.

2230
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,500
You're right.

2231
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:27,000
Oh, you're so right.

2232
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,400
You're so fucking right.

2233
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:35,560
Oh, please.

2234
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,540
I don't know.

2235
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:38,260
I don't know.

2236
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:40,380
Win.

2237
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:42,980
No!

2238
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:44,280
Please!

2239
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,900
You have everything!

2240
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,520
Let me have this!

2241
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,940
Let me!

2242
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,440
Oh!

2243
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:52,560
Okay.

2244
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,620
Okay.

2245
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,660
Let me have this!

2246
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,360
You literally have everything you ever wanted in life!

2247
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,660
They love you!

2248
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,440
Oh, my God!

2249
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:22,120
I don't have magic anymore, guys!

2250
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,180
I can't immobilize him!

2251
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,020
Oh, my God!

2252
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:35,100
I can't immobilize him!

2253
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,700
I don't have enough magic!

2254
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,960
My thing only increases my chi!

2255
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,420
Oh!

2256
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,620
Oh, my God!

2257
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,420
Oh, my God!

2258
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,500
Oh, my God!

2259
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,960
The fuck?

2260
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:51,180
The Apramana Bat Spirit?

2261
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,140
Okay.

2262
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,340
I know I could just walk back.

2263
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,320
I did that!

2264
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:58,200
You serious?

2265
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,120
Okay.

2266
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,540
I know I could walk back, guys.

2267
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,320
Okay.

2268
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:06,540
Alright.

2269
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:08,740
I need... What?

2270
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,460
You should check if you have the Bat Spirit.

2271
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:11,900
I do have it.

2272
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,980
Okay.

2273
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,480
What is it?

2274
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,620
Where is he called?

2275
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:19,720
Aquamarine?

2276
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:22,980
That's a rock.

2277
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,980
Turtle Treasure?

2278
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,900
The fuck is it?

2279
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,180
Where is he?

2280
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,040
Oh, there he is!

2281
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:35,860
This guy?

2282
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:37,960
Okay.

2283
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,760
Reduces the cost.

2284
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,020
This guy?

2285
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,420
Oh, Apramarine.

2286
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:47,720
Sorry.

2287
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,160
Apramana.

2288
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,240
Sorry, I said it wrong.

2289
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,040
Okay.

2290
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,300
Alright, it's time.

2291
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:01,620
I have so much money anyway.

2292
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,640
I have so much money anyway.

2293
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,080
Never mind.

2294
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,800
I'm sorry, baby.

2295
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,020
I know you're...

2296
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,140
I'm sorry, baby.

2297
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,780
You've been with me since the beginning, but everyone's telling me to ditch your ass.

2298
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,120
Everyone...

2299
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,560
Everyone is telling me to ditch your ass, but you've been with...

2300
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,700
Just know that I didn't...

2301
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,800
I didn't...

2302
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,180
I didn't mean it.

2303
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,060
Just know that I didn't want to.

2304
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,000
I...

2305
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,900
Just know that I didn't want to, baby.

2306
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,640
I did it out of...

2307
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,720
Not consensually swapped off you.

2308
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,200
I was peer pressured because I'm weak.

2309
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,360
Just know that it was peer pressured.

2310
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:08,700
Oh, shit!

2311
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,640
How the fuck do I use this thing?

2312
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:19,360
I didn't enjoy it.

2313
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,820
I cried when I...

2314
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:24,140
A tear fell down when I had to swap it.

2315
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,280
And Oh,

2316
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,220
shit.

2317
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:32,720
It's not...

2318
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,420
God damn it.

2319
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:34,540
I forgot to rest up.

2320
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,340
Don't worry, I'll bring back Big Baby.

2321
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:54,560
I'll bring him back in the final boss.

2322
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,240
We just gotta beat up Erlon.

2323
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,060
Just had it too good for too long.

2324
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,240
He's had it too good for too long!

2325
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:09,800
He has everything!

2326
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,780
I have to!

2327
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,660
Big Baby, I just had to!

2328
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,590
There's no way he hits me.

2329
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,070
I need to figure out the range.

2330
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,590
Okay, okay, restart.

2331
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:40,190
Please!

2332
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,330
Stop playing with your foot!

2333
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:43,890
Just get this over with!

2334
01:38:44,530 --> 01:38:45,210
Please!

2335
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,430
Stop taunting me!

2336
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:53,990
He fucking taunted me!

2337
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:55,070
That's so fucked!

2338
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:56,890
That's so fucked!

2339
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,010
I can't believe he did that.

2340
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:05,710
He had to monologue.

2341
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:07,970
Alright, here we go.

2342
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:09,810
He took my frames.

2343
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:11,090
He took my drip.

2344
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:13,250
And now he took the baby!

2345
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:16,650
What more does he want?

2346
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:22,270
He even took the baby, chat!

2347
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:25,350
He fucking took the child!

2348
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,830
Okay, now this has to be the range.

2349
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:33,970
This has to be the range, right?

2350
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:35,810
Here we go.

2351
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:35,870
Here we go.

2352
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:40,770
Okay.

2353
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,430
Oh my god, it is.

2354
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:44,610
It's actually the range.

2355
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:46,070
Then what, do this?

2356
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,570
Why do I spin so slow?

2357
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:53,390
Shit.

2358
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:54,870
Okay.

2359
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,170
Is this a skill shot?

2360
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:57,930
Oh, I did it!

2361
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,240
Yes!

2362
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:08,640
Yeah!

2363
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:08,960
Oh!

2364
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,360
Oh, I had to walk forward?

2365
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,480
I had to move too!

2366
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,800
Eya, why did you take so much?

2367
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,020
Oh my god, you used that already?

2368
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,180
I can't believe he would make me walk.

2369
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,500
That's so fucked.

2370
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,040
Oh god, okay.

2371
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,600
He would also make me walk too.

2372
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,540
Alright, there you go.

2373
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:41,200
Oh, I win again.

2374
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,800
That's so good for me.

2375
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,360
Where is he?

2376
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,260
Oh shit, there he is.

2377
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:49,400
No way.

2378
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:51,720
I...

2379
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,440
Okay, thank god.

2380
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,140
Okay, I was gonna...

2381
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,400
I was gonna be so sad.

2382
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,440
Oh shit.

2383
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:58,960
Getting hit by the wind.

2384
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,200
Nice.

2385
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,200
There you go.

2386
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,380
What more do you want from me?

2387
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:08,620
What more do you want from me?

2388
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,200
What more do you want from me?

2389
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,220
Okay.

2390
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,260
Now I have to do cardio because of you!

2391
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,080
Fuck you!

2392
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,360
He forced me to do cardio!

2393
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,160
Okay.

2394
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:32,980
Oh my god.

2395
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:33,320
No, no!

2396
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:34,240
I accident drank!

2397
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:35,680
No!

2398
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,220
Oh no!

2399
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:41,480
Oh my god!

2400
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:42,680
Oh my god!

2401
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,760
I'm stopped!

2402
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:48,160
Oh fuck!

2403
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:53,840
What you gonna do?

2404
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,400
I'm a fucking rock now.

2405
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,700
What you gonna do?

2406
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:58,520
I'm the slowest fucking rock.

2407
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,440
That's fucking right!

2408
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,560
What you gonna do?

2409
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:04,600
Does he not acknowledge me as a person when I'm a rock?

2410
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,700
That's so fucked!

2411
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:07,920
Wait.

2412
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:11,280
He doesn't see me as a person.

2413
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,100
He doesn't see me as a person!

2414
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,520
That's so messed up!

2415
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,800
It's just a rock!

2416
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,760
Not real to him!

2417
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:26,500
Win!

2418
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:31,600
That's so fucked.

2419
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,840
He hates rocks.

2420
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,280
Wait, what?

2421
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,140
What the fuck?

2422
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,020
Skill!

2423
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,560
That's fucking... Wait, wait, it doesn't... Okay.

2424
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,360
Okay, it didn't work.

2425
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,020
Guys, how come it stopped working?

2426
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:53,120
Guys, why did it stop?

2427
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,460
Guys, I thought...

2428
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:01,800
Okay.

2429
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:03,620
I missed?!

2430
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:04,560
That's...

2431
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,540
What do you mean I missed?!

2432
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:12,920
Oh god.

2433
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,300
Oh, he doesn't like it.

2434
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:18,420
He gets increased resistance?!

2435
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:21,800
What more does he want?!

2436
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:26,660
What do you mean he gets increased resistance?!

2437
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,780
Oh my god.

2438
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,180
Okay.

2439
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:32,540
Okay.

2440
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:37,410
I don't know how to dodge that yet!

2441
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:38,570
I don't know how to dodge my whole thing!

2442
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:43,070
That's so fucked.

2443
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:43,570
He like...

2444
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:46,430
He's basically like the golden child!

2445
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:49,710
He's him.

2446
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:53,210
Win cannot be like him!

2447
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:56,410
I wanna be him too!

2448
01:43:59,290 --> 01:44:00,250
Oh no.

2449
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:01,810
Oh no.

2450
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:02,390
What is that?

2451
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:03,530
Oh, it's the doubles!

2452
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:07,550
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna heal.

2453
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,290
I'm just gonna be here.

2454
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:13,270
Yay!

2455
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:14,530
He doesn't see me!

2456
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:17,090
Okay.

2457
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:18,650
Alright.

2458
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:21,390
I don't know when to actually spin so I'm just gonna do this now.

2459
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:22,170
Just in case.

2460
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:24,510
Oh god.

2461
01:44:24,610 --> 01:44:24,730
Oh!

2462
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:26,970
Spin!

2463
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:27,350
Spin!

2464
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,250
No, I don't heal!

2465
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:30,430
Oh god, you fucking idiot!

2466
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:32,990
You fucking...

2467
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:35,550
You fucking idiot!

2468
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:41,090
You fucking idiot!

2469
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:43,110
That was a mistake, guys.

2470
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:46,230
I... I did not mean to do that.

2471
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:48,690
No!

2472
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:52,830
No, no!

2473
01:44:52,930 --> 01:44:54,030
Oh, he grabbed me!

2474
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:56,490
What?!

2475
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:03,470
I don't have... I don't have it anymore.

2476
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:03,930
No!

2477
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:05,530
Rock!

2478
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,710
Guys, it's over.

2479
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,050
I mean, what is he gonna do?

2480
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:09,730
Shoot me?

2481
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:10,610
Okay, he...

2482
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:12,230
Your thing sucks.

2483
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,750
Your thing fucking sucks.

2484
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:17,050
Look at that.

2485
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:18,910
It does nothing to me.

2486
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:20,890
Big rocks coming over.

2487
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:22,530
That's fucking right.

2488
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:24,650
Big rock is coming over.

2489
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:27,150
That's fucking right.

2490
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:30,270
This is what you get.

2491
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:33,430
No, I'm definitely... I'm dead.

2492
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,430
I'm so dead.

2493
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:40,610
I... I'm literally like... I'm literally one HP, guys.

2494
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:43,510
He fucking dodged everything.

2495
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:48,950
It's actually crazy how much he dodged.

2496
01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:50,930
Oh!

2497
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:54,850
There's no point in me trying to fucking play this.

2498
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:58,070
I'm literally one.

2499
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:02,210
Oh, my God!

2500
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:04,870
Oh, God!

2501
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:06,610
Oh, and he sidestepped that.

2502
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:07,610
Yeah, fuck me, I guess.

2503
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:14,530
Oh, my God.

2504
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:18,810
This is the closest we've ever got, though.

2505
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:22,130
Is that fair?

2506
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:26,850
How come I keep missing, he can't?

2507
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:29,550
Why is he mom's favorite child?

2508
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,570
I wouldn't be a favorite child.

2509
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,410
He has... he has the frames.

2510
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:38,690
He has the looks.

2511
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:39,650
He has the power.

2512
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:40,930
He has a tiger.

2513
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,850
He has an eagle.

2514
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:43,290
He has the drip.

2515
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:44,970
Like, what do I have?

2516
01:46:45,290 --> 01:46:46,850
I don't even have shoes.

2517
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:48,390
I...

2518
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,770
I don't even have shoes!

2519
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:56,370
He's just him.

2520
01:46:57,190 --> 01:47:01,430
I don't even know the range for this stupid-ass ability.

2521
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:06,810
Oh, my God, he's literally so low!

2522
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:11,150
Okay.

2523
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:15,150
There's no way.

2524
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:18,230
There's no way he sidesteps this bitch.

2525
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:23,010
There's no fucking way you sidestep this, you fucking bitch.

2526
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:23,990
You whore!

2527
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:27,110
You're such a whore!

2528
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:30,170
Wow!

2529
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:30,910
Wow!

2530
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:53,750
I have to use the wind again!

2531
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:58,490
Because I didn't get the second phase!

2532
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:00,750
I hate you.

2533
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:01,850
I hate you.

2534
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:03,910
Nobody loves you.

2535
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,310
Nobody fucking loves you!

2536
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,330
Hi!

2537
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:10,070
Hi!

2538
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:11,230
Hehehe!!

2539
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:17,710
Stop calling me small monkey!

2540
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:21,070
I'm almost the same age as you!

2541
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:24,510
I don't actually think so, but like, I like to think I am.

2542
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:31,670
Oh, my God, it's so fa... Oh, my God, he fucking resisted it!

2543
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:35,050
Okay...

2544
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:39,250
I could have used the rock.

2545
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:40,270
I just realized that.

2546
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,670
You're right.

2547
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:42,070
I'm sorry.

2548
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:42,710
I'm special.

2549
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:47,350
I'm sorry.

2550
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:50,090
So bad at reading instructions.

2551
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:00,130
All right.

2552
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:03,890
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee spin!

2553
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:08,890
What you mean he absorbs it?

2554
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:11,350
Let him absorb it!

2555
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:13,970
Weeeeeeeeee!

2556
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,330
Weeeee!

2557
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:21,310
The bee fucking spin on you!

2558
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:21,930
Get over here!

2559
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:22,690
Oh shit!

2560
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:23,810
Okay, he doesn't like that.

2561
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:24,250
Whoa!

2562
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,710
Okay, that's fine.

2563
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:27,870
Poke!

2564
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:29,390
Here we go.

2565
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,070
Weeeeee!

2566
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:40,090
Eh!

2567
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:40,770
What?!

2568
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,410
It's not fair!

2569
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:47,190
Is anything fair in this world anymore?

2570
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:52,710
I'll just wait.

2571
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:55,990
You can just stay there, I don't fucking care anymore.

2572
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:57,310
SPIDE!

2573
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:01,950
Get over here!

2574
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:07,670
Guys,

2575
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:14,090
I don't know.

2576
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:14,890
Guys, I don't know.

2577
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:17,170
I feel... I feel very...

2578
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:19,810
I feel very fucking vulnerable right now.

2579
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,370
Spin... spin... spin!

2580
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:26,530
Spin!

2581
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,950
Shit, okay!

2582
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,790
Okay, it doesn't matter!

2583
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:33,390
Wow, he doesn't know where to breathe!

2584
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:33,790
That's right!

2585
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:37,470
Okay.

2586
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:39,090
That's fine.

2587
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:41,670
Spin...

2588
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:45,630
Shit, okay.

2589
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,710
That's fine.

2590
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:50,030
Oh, you bitch.

2591
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:51,570
You're a bitch.

2592
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:53,830
But he loves you.

2593
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,250
Oh, fuck!

2594
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:58,930
He only likes you for your looks.

2595
01:50:58,990 --> 01:50:59,430
That's right.

2596
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:01,230
I have a personality at least.

2597
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:05,890
Everybody only talks about your looks.

2598
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:06,350
But no...

2599
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:07,490
I'm sorry!

2600
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:10,990
Fuck!

2601
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:17,800
Okay, we're okay.

2602
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:19,980
We're okay.

2603
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,240
Oh my god.

2604
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,960
Jesus Christ, bro.

2605
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,620
Please let me...

2606
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:32,600
Please let me...

2607
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,240
Okay, that's fine.

2608
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:37,940
Come on!

2609
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:39,420
Please let me poke you!

2610
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,080
Yes!

2611
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:40,840
Thank you!

2612
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:43,700
I really appreciate that one thing you gave me!

2613
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:44,940
I know!

2614
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:47,440
Oh god.

2615
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:51,360
Oh god.

2616
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,340
Okay, but what if I do this?

2617
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:55,800
And he absorbs it.

2618
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,340
That's what...

2619
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:58,060
That's fucking right.

2620
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,040
It's rock time!

2621
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:03,960
You might not acknowledge me as a person!

2622
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:07,400
But I shall SMASH!

2623
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,600
SMASH!

2624
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,240
SMASH!

2625
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:12,920
Get over here!

2626
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,060
That's fucking right.

2627
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,400
Whoops, sorry.

2628
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,480
I got a little finger hungry there.

2629
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:20,740
Smash!

2630
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,060
I'm rolling over!

2631
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:25,800
SMASH!

2632
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:26,920
Alright.

2633
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,460
And then the last smash.

2634
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,940
That's fucking right.

2635
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:34,440
Win!

2636
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,720
Oh, why am I using win?

2637
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:36,300
I'm sorry!

2638
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:36,760
I'm sorry!

2639
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:37,540
Oh god, okay.

2640
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:39,360
Guys, I don't know why I used win.

2641
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,580
I got so fucking excited.

2642
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:42,780
Guys, you don't understand.

2643
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,440
I actually got...

2644
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,080
I got way too excited.

2645
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,500
Oh shit.

2646
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:55,740
Guys, that was a mistake.

2647
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:56,480
I wasn't...

2648
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,160
I didn't mean to actually use the win.

2649
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:58,700
I...

2650
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:00,780
I got so excited.

2651
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,380
I got lost in the sauce.

2652
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,080
I got so lost.

2653
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:07,820
I saw...

2654
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:10,560
I was like, whoa, I have the attack now?

2655
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:12,500
And then I was like, whoa, I'm gonna use that.

2656
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,040
It's gonna be so funny.

2657
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:17,680
Everybody will think it's so fucking funny when I use it.

2658
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:19,800
Oh...

2659
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:20,780
Oh!

2660
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:21,820
It's fine.

2661
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,460
I'll just...

2662
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:23,480
heal.

2663
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,120
Alright, nice.

2664
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:27,940
Whoa!

2665
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:28,800
Wow!

2666
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:29,800
Wow!

2667
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:31,340
Wow!

2668
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:34,900
Guys, I don't feel so good.

2669
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,620
Well, I wanna poke too.

2670
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:41,260
Oh shit!

2671
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,140
Okay, never mind.

2672
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,200
I guess I don't poke.

2673
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:44,620
Wow!

2674
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:48,840
Slowest fucking axe through of his fucking life.

2675
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:51,720
Okay, nice.

2676
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:54,400
Oh fuck, not nice.

2677
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,600
Not nice, not nice.

2678
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:57,700
Not nice at all.

2679
01:53:58,180 --> 01:53:59,320
Okay, but what is it?

2680
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:01,960
Are you serious?

2681
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:03,600
How does that not hit?

2682
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,700
How does he absorb every fucking...

2683
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:07,820
Okay.

2684
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:09,800
Alright.

2685
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:10,940
It's fine.

2686
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:15,640
Oh!

2687
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,920
Guys, I don't know anymore.

2688
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:19,420
I don't...

2689
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:21,660
Oh my god!

2690
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,040
I don't know anymore!

2691
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,200
He's doing lots of...

2692
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,560
There we go.

2693
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,600
Alright, there we go.

2694
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:29,000
That's fine.

2695
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:29,560
That's fine.

2696
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:30,040
That's fine.

2697
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:31,300
That's fine.

2698
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:34,260
It's fine.

2699
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:34,800
He's just...

2700
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,660
We're just gonna watch...

2701
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:36,780
We're gonna watch him a little bit.

2702
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,280
And then...

2703
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:41,820
Oh, he moved away!

2704
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:47,120
Guys, it's not fair when he moves away, guys.

2705
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,360
I hate...

2706
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,260
Oh god, he wants me to spin again.

2707
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,160
Spin, spin, spin, spin.

2708
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:56,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2709
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:58,480
Okay.

2710
01:54:58,700 --> 01:54:59,340
Whoa!

2711
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,500
I'm so scared.

2712
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,740
I'm so scared!

2713
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:07,880
What?!

2714
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,440
Okay.

2715
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,440
Rock time!

2716
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,400
It's rock time!

2717
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:15,240
That's right!

2718
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,100
I have right to win!

2719
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,700
Me too!

2720
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,040
I have my rock rights!

2721
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:27,640
You might not see me as a real person!

2722
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:30,160
But my chat does!

2723
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:38,060
He's just laughing at you.

2724
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:40,880
What?!

2725
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:41,500
How do I not?

2726
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:41,880
Okay!

2727
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,860
I don't know how that...

2728
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,600
didn't fucking work, though.

2729
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:52,380
Oh god.

2730
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:56,280
Oh my god!

2731
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:56,620
Okay!

2732
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,220
Shit, I'm dead.

2733
01:55:59,260 --> 01:55:59,740
I'm so dead.

2734
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:04,400
Oh my god, he healed again!

2735
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,320
This is my last healing!

2736
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:06,180
No!

2737
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,320
It's over!

2738
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:11,840
It's over!

2739
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,500
Okay.

2740
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,980
Oh shit!

2741
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:21,540
No!

2742
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:22,100
God!

2743
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,060
Stop!

2744
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:34,410
No!

2745
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,330
We were so close!

2746
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:36,850
It was the closest we've ever been!

2747
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:40,490
Gaming, thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

2748
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:41,190
Thank you!

2749
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:44,310
We were so close!

2750
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:47,070
Okay, we got the strat down.

2751
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:50,690
We got the strat down, guys.

2752
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:51,590
Alright, it's time!

2753
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:53,850
This is what we've been saving for!

2754
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:57,310
This is it!

2755
01:56:58,310 --> 01:57:00,050
Okay, where is the...

2756
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:01,030
Okay.

2757
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:03,370
Guys, this is it.

2758
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:08,770
This is exactly what we have been saving for this entire time.

2759
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:11,130
This is it!

2760
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:12,790
We've been saving!

2761
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:14,130
This is our moment!

2762
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:23,590
This is our moment!

2763
01:57:23,790 --> 01:57:25,090
We figured it out!

2764
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:26,150
We...

2765
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:29,670
It gives me back my mana!

2766
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:32,970
I want my mana!

2767
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:35,350
Where's my mana?

2768
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:37,930
Okay, this is it.

2769
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:40,990
I'm gonna take all the drugs.

2770
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:45,070
Wait, do I even have revive?

2771
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:49,830
There's no mana restored!

2772
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:52,010
Okay, that's fine.

2773
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:52,870
We'll just have...

2774
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:55,970
The one medicine we're gonna take would be this.

2775
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:57,910
This is the one!

2776
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:01,890
Alright.

2777
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:04,550
It never existed.

2778
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:06,210
Okay, this is it.

2779
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:10,490
We've hoarded for this one moment in life.

2780
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:12,170
This is what we've hoarded.

2781
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:15,470
Alright, let's see.

2782
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:19,910
Upon use, instantly recovers full HP!

2783
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:21,630
This is it.

2784
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:24,790
This is exactly what we've been waiting for!

2785
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:29,510
Okay, is it this?

2786
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:31,670
Okay.

2787
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:32,910
Alright.

2788
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:35,450
Do I have to drink this before I go in?

2789
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:41,980
Okay.

2790
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:42,580
No.

2791
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,300
We'll save this.

2792
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,120
I'm still hoarding that.

2793
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:51,640
I'm gonna hoard this one last time.

2794
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,540
I'm gonna hoard that.

2795
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,120
Alright, there we go.

2796
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,640
We'll drink all of this.

2797
01:58:59,180 --> 01:58:59,780
Okay.

2798
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,420
What did I use?

2799
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:05,420
Okay, long aura amplification.

2800
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:09,000
Alright.

2801
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,820
You don't understand.

2802
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,020
What have I needed for Wukong 2?

2803
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:15,280
You don't understand!

2804
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:18,600
This is gonna be so important, guys.

2805
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:19,340
This is it.

2806
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:21,400
This is it.

2807
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,700
This is finally it.

2808
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:26,840
This is finally it.

2809
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:31,320
We've hoarded our drinking pills for this exact time.

2810
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:34,080
This exact moment in time.

2811
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:37,780
Okay, this is... Okay, I'm gonna drink this now.

2812
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:42,200
And then I'll drink this.

2813
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:43,660
And then...

2814
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:44,860
Boom.

2815
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:46,700
There we go.

2816
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,240
Wait, I fucked up.

2817
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,040
Wait, I... Oh, I fucked it up.

2818
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:51,860
I was healing.

2819
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:57,640
I pressed R!

2820
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,020
I pressed R!

2821
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,800
My face!

2822
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:03,900
My face!

2823
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:04,120
I can't.

2824
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:05,420
Please stop talking.

2825
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:06,080
I need a reset.

2826
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,600
I... I...

2827
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:11,280
I pressed R and I missed the tornado.

2828
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:15,080
Everything that went wrong went wrong.

2829
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:17,400
I...

2830
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:20,400
I drank twice.

2831
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:23,360
I was so used to pressing R, guys.

2832
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:24,300
You don't understand.

2833
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:27,020
You don't understand.

2834
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,700
Okay.

2835
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:30,020
Okay, now...

2836
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:31,960
Now thank god I didn't eat the...

2837
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:34,440
Thank god I didn't eat the pills yet.

2838
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:36,880
Okay.

2839
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:37,940
Alright.

2840
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,040
I didn't waste it, guys.

2841
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:41,940
Because I didn't even use it.

2842
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:43,500
I didn't even...

2843
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:45,420
I pressed R instead of Q.

2844
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,100
Oh my god.

2845
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:50,160
I pressed R and drank my heals instead.

2846
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,780
But this time...

2847
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,780
This time it'll be different.

2848
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:56,300
That's fucking right.

2849
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,280
Hurricane time.

2850
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:05,740
That's fucking right, you...

2851
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:06,520
bitch.

2852
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,220
You fucking whore.

2853
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:09,460
That's fucking right.

2854
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,400
That's fucking right.

2855
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,820
I'm gonna spin!

2856
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,900
Yeah, what you gonna do?

2857
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:24,820
Nothing!

2858
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:27,300
I'm fucking heading over and spinning again!

2859
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:28,900
Spin!

2860
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:32,250
Spin!

2861
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:33,030
That's how you go!

2862
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:33,330
Okay.

2863
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:34,250
Alright, we're fine.

2864
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:35,370
We're fine.

2865
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:37,250
Everything is fine.

2866
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:42,010
We're gonna keep spinning.

2867
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:44,450
We're gonna keep spinning!

2868
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:46,490
Where is he?

2869
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:47,450
Where is he?

2870
02:01:47,490 --> 02:01:47,630
No!

2871
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:49,030
He fucking hit me!

2872
02:01:49,170 --> 02:01:49,490
That's okay.

2873
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:51,130
I still... I move first.

2874
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:54,070
Oh my god, I still move first.

2875
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:55,170
Thank god.

2876
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:56,190
Thank god.

2877
02:01:56,430 --> 02:01:57,630
Thank god.

2878
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:00,630
That's... Thank god.

2879
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:01,150
Spin!

2880
02:02:01,930 --> 02:02:05,590
Oh, thank god!

2881
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:05,830
Okay.

2882
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:07,690
Okay, everything is okay.

2883
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:09,710
But he's so far, but I can still spin.

2884
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:11,590
I can still spin to win.

2885
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:12,710
I can... Oh!

2886
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:14,070
It's okay.

2887
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:15,410
I can still spin to win.

2888
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:17,830
He doesn't know where I am.

2889
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:21,070
Spin!

2890
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,190
Keep spinning!

2891
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:25,890
No!

2892
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,510
Okay, we're fine.

2893
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:31,230
We're fine.

2894
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:32,630
Everything will be fine.

2895
02:02:32,770 --> 02:02:34,230
I don't remember what that does.

2896
02:02:35,170 --> 02:02:35,690
Okay.

2897
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:38,690
Oh no, he absorbed it.

2898
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:39,390
That's so fast.

2899
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:40,950
That's so fucked.

2900
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:42,350
That's so...

2901
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:44,090
Okay.

2902
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:44,850
Where is he?

2903
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:45,610
Okay, he's right here.

2904
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:46,570
What the fuck?

2905
02:02:46,590 --> 02:02:48,050
This is the first time it's ever hit me!

2906
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:50,270
Oh, he's hacking as well!

2907
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:56,170
I've never had an issue with this before!

2908
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:57,410
Okay.

2909
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:00,030
Okay.

2910
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,430
Oh god.

2911
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:05,130
That was so close.

2912
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:06,670
That was actually...

2913
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:08,550
Spin.

2914
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:09,030
Spin.

2915
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:10,210
Okay.

2916
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:12,930
Okay.

2917
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:13,910
That's fine.

2918
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:15,350
That's fine.

2919
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:17,550
That's so fine.

2920
02:03:17,670 --> 02:03:18,910
We're so okay.

2921
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:20,650
We're so okay.

2922
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:24,790
Freeze!

2923
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:26,790
Spin!

2924
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:29,570
Spin like your life means anything!

2925
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:31,170
Wukong!

2926
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:32,690
You matter!

2927
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:33,090
Oh!

2928
02:03:33,930 --> 02:03:34,650
Rock!

2929
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:35,050
Whoa!

2930
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:36,570
Whoa!

2931
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:38,570
Please, Wukong!

2932
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:39,630
You so matter!

2933
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,170
Oh god!

2934
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:43,410
Rock!

2935
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:44,430
Rock!

2936
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:46,130
Oh!

2937
02:03:46,270 --> 02:03:47,090
Okay, that's fine.

2938
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:47,890
I'll just stay here.

2939
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:50,730
That's fine.

2940
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:51,350
I'll just...

2941
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:53,710
I guess I'll just stay here.

2942
02:03:55,110 --> 02:03:55,630
That's...

2943
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,490
That's okay.

2944
02:03:59,130 --> 02:03:59,930
I'll just...

2945
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:02,910
I'll just AFK until it's over.

2946
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:04,930
It's my turn, bitch.

2947
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:06,570
It's fucking my turn.

2948
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:08,590
That's fucking right.

2949
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:11,350
That's my turn, you whore.

2950
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:13,530
You think you're handsome?

2951
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:17,290
Not so handsome now as I bash your head in.

2952
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:20,210
That's fucking right!

2953
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:24,230
No plastic surgery's gonna save you now!

2954
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:25,890
Oh god.

2955
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:28,130
Oh, please.

2956
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:29,950
This is not fair.

2957
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:32,550
This is not fair.

2958
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:33,830
Wow!

2959
02:04:35,950 --> 02:04:36,670
Wow!

2960
02:04:38,030 --> 02:04:39,130
Little monkey!

2961
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:39,870
No!

2962
02:04:40,190 --> 02:04:41,810
How could you tell?

2963
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:42,610
How far can you go?

2964
02:04:43,330 --> 02:04:44,510
Oh shit!

2965
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:45,770
Okay, that was my bad.

2966
02:04:45,870 --> 02:04:46,930
I got cocky there.

2967
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:47,730
I admit.

2968
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:49,650
I actually got way too cocky there.

2969
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:52,130
I definitely...

2970
02:04:52,130 --> 02:04:53,750
Oh my god.

2971
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:54,930
No!

2972
02:04:56,110 --> 02:04:56,830
No!

2973
02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:58,930
Okay.

2974
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:01,350
Oh, thank god.

2975
02:05:01,370 --> 02:05:01,950
He's monologuing.

2976
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:03,010

Okay.

2983
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:19,350
Okay, that's fine.

2984
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:21,510
Oh, that is not fine.

2985
02:05:21,610 --> 02:05:22,850
That is not fine now, guys.

2986
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:24,150
Wow!

2987
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:27,790
Oh god.

Okay.

2989
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:31,790
Okay, but what if I drink the damage reduction?

2990
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:32,670
Whoa!

2991
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:33,630
Alright, we're fine.

2992
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:36,250
Oh, he can't do shit now.

2993
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:39,770
Oh god.

2994
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:40,330

2996
02:05:45,230 --> 02:05:45,670
Wow!

2997
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:47,130
I didn't see him!

2998
02:05:47,570 --> 02:05:48,790
I'm so stupid.

2999
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:49,850
I'm so stupid!

3000
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:53,690
Okay, I didn't see him.

3001
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:55,290
He came out of nowhere!

3002
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:01,290
Why you look at chat?

3003
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:01,810
How did you know?

3004
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:04,690
How did you know I looked at chat?

3005
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:09,710
It was an accident.

3006
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,770
I swear to god it didn't mean to.

3007
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:16,330
Oh shit.

3008
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:20,110

Okay.

3011
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:27,530
He's doing so many acrobats!

3012
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:29,050
Like he should join the Olympics!

3013
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:31,230
Oh fuck.

3014
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:32,610
Okay.

3015
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:33,970
That's fine.

3016
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:34,390
That's fine.

3017
02:06:34,450 --> 02:06:35,390
We're okay.

3018
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:37,630
We're okay.

3019
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:39,750
We are actually not okay, but like...

3020
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:42,290

3021
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:44,630

3022
02:06:49,670 --> 02:06:51,750
Oh, are you serious?

3023
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:54,110

3024
02:06:56,590 --> 02:06:58,670
Oh, come on!

This is actually so messed up.

3032
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:23,470
It's so messed up, Erlang.

3033
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:26,610
Why are you like this?

3034
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:29,250
Who fucking made you like this?

3035
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:31,390
Like, does nobody love you?

3036
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:34,670
Like, nobody actually loves you?

3037
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:36,830
You fucking whore.

3038
02:07:36,830 --> 02:07:38,530
You fucking whore.

You're actually a terrible person.

3044
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:50,390
You're...

3052
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:09,130
I couldn't heal!

3053
02:08:09,470 --> 02:08:13,810

3054
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:15,490
I tried!

3055
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:16,630
I was pressing Q!

3056
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:18,990
I was spamming Q and everything!

3057
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:21,210
No!

3058
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:26,150
I was spamming Q!

3059
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:28,530
Oh my god!

3060
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:32,750
Okay, we got the strat.

02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:35,070
We got the strat.

3063
02:08:35,210 --> 02:08:35,730
This is it.

3064
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:36,330
This is...

3065
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:38,370
No, we still have it!

3066
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:40,390
We still have it!

3067
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:43,350
Stop looking at us!

3068
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:44,790
How do I still have the pill?

3069
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:46,650
Okay.

3070
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:49,350
Okay, here we go.

3071
02:08:52,070 --> 02:08:53,050
That's fucking right.

3072
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:56,530
Win.

3073
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:00,010
Oh, I can pause?

3074
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:03,370
Oh, it's still... Okay.

3075
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:04,030

Okay, that's good.

3079
02:09:06,670 --> 02:09:07,330
That's good.

3080
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:10,150
I thought I fucked it up.

3081
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:12,030

3082
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:13,890
Thank god.

3083
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:15,170

3085
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:18,250
That's good.

3086
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:19,490
That's good.

02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:23,070
Thank god.

3089
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:26,590
I thought I actually fucked it up, guys, but...

3090
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:27,810
I thought I actually fucked it up, guys, but...

3091
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:28,850
I didn't actually...

3092
02:09:28,850 --> 02:09:29,690
Guys.

3093
02:09:31,710 --> 02:09:33,890
I didn't actually fuck it up, guys.

3094
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:34,230
I didn't actually fuck it up, guys.

3095
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:34,510
Thank god.

3096
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:36,150
Thank god.

3097
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:39,570
Okay.

3098
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:41,270
Okay, this is fine.

3099
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:41,610
Okay.

3100
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:41,610
Okay, this is fine.

3101
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:45,570
This is so fine.

3102
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:47,590
It's not, but like, I'm just...

3103
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:49,210
It's not, but like...

3104
02:09:49,210 --> 02:09:51,790
I need somebody to believe in me.

3105
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:59,290
I need somebody to believe in me.

3106
02:09:59,290 --> 02:09:59,290
Okay.

3107
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:00,730
Get over here.

3108
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:02,650
Get over here.

3109
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:05,750
Alright.

3110
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:09,190
Alright.

3111
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:10,730
Spin time.

3112
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:11,450
Spin!

3113
02:10:12,350 --> 02:10:13,150
Spin!

3114
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:15,330
Okay, guys.

3115
02:10:15,570 --> 02:10:17,910
Spin again!

3116
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:19,790
Keep spinning!

3117
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:21,670
We just never...

3118
02:10:21,790 --> 02:10:22,330
Stop spinning!

3119
02:10:25,010 --> 02:10:25,610
Shit!

3120
02:10:26,030 --> 02:10:26,390
Okay.

3121
02:10:26,610 --> 02:10:27,090
Okay.

3122
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:29,810
What if I...

3123
02:10:29,810 --> 02:10:30,630
You think I hit those?

3124
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:33,810
Okay, I don't, but I have this.

3125
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:37,850
Okay.

3126
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:38,770
He's an eagle.

3127
02:10:39,550 --> 02:10:41,230
He's an eagle.

3128
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:41,810
Okay.

3129
02:10:41,910 --> 02:10:43,370
I guess we don't have that.

3130
02:10:43,470 --> 02:10:43,850
I guess.

3131
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:44,690
Alright.

3132
02:10:46,610 --> 02:10:48,410
Goodbye, tornado.

3133
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:51,030
Goodbye, tornado.

3134
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:58,170
Fuck it...

3135
02:10:58,170 --> 02:11:03,230
Fuck it...

3136
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:07,710
How did he dodge?

3137
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:12,870
How did he Dodge all that?

3138
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:13,570
How did he Dodge all that?

3139
02:11:13,570 --> 02:11:14,810
I don't understand!

3140
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:19,110
How did he Dodge?

3141
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,250
How did he turn into a fucking eagle?

3142
02:11:23,190 --> 02:11:26,230
Who let him turn into a fucking eagle?

3143
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:31,270
That's actually cheating!

3144
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:33,670
He fucking cheated!

3145
02:11:37,110 --> 02:11:38,150
I didn't lock it!

3146
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:38,810
Oh, I locked it.

3147
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:39,550
Okay, there we go.

3148
02:11:39,790 --> 02:11:47,210
I can't believe it!

3149
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:49,390
He turned into a fucking eagle!

3150
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,010
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

3151
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:54,690
I'm so sorry!

3152
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:55,610
I'm so sorry!

3153
02:11:57,790 --> 02:11:58,670
Oh, what?!

3154
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:02,190
Okay.

3155
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:04,750
I lost my magic for that, but that's fine.

3156
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:06,950
That's fine.

3157
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:07,390
That's fine.

3158
02:12:07,410 --> 02:12:07,850
That's fine.

3159
02:12:07,870 --> 02:12:08,290
That's fine.

3160
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:08,730
That's fine.

3161
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:11,410
Okay.

3162
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:12,330
That's fine.

3163
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:12,830
That's fine.

3164
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:13,990
And then I got this again.

3165
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:16,310
And then I got this again.

3166
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:17,230
And then spin!

3167
02:12:18,490 --> 02:12:19,370
Keep spinning!

3168
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:22,070
Spin like it matters!

3169
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:22,390
Spin like it matters!

3170
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:26,830
Okay, we're fine.

3171
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:30,390
Okay, this is okay.

3172
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:31,010
This is okay.

3173
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,070
Everything is okay.

3174
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:34,090
Whoa!

3175
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,810
Where is he?

3176
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:37,830
Oh, fuck!

3177
02:12:37,930 --> 02:12:38,570
Every time!

3178
02:12:39,290 --> 02:12:40,450
Please don't attack me.

3179
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:40,890
Please.

3180
02:12:43,230 --> 02:12:43,750
What?!

3181
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:45,370
Me in the wind!

3182
02:12:47,950 --> 02:12:48,670
Okay, nice.

3183
02:12:50,230 --> 02:12:50,750
Nice.

3184
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:53,890
Okay.

3185
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:55,030
Spin.

3186
02:12:55,810 --> 02:12:56,370
Spin.

3187
02:12:57,190 --> 02:12:58,170
Keep spinning!

3188
02:13:00,970 --> 02:13:01,770
Okay, nice.

3189
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:06,910
Okay, nice.

3190
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:07,170
Nice.

3191
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,830
Nice.

3192
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:10,250
Every time.

3193
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:13,950
Every time he does that, I just... I don't know.

3194
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:16,150
I don't know.

3195
02:13:16,370 --> 02:13:17,470
I don't know.

3196
02:13:18,450 --> 02:13:19,530
I don't know.

3197
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:22,490
I don't know.

3198
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:25,050
Spin time.

3199
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:26,370
Spin.

3200
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,110
Okay.

3201
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:30,530
That was so close.

3202
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:33,690
Rock, rock, rock, rock!

3203
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:35,950
Turned into a fucking rock!

3204
02:13:35,990 --> 02:13:40,130
Okay, it's fine.

3205
02:13:41,050 --> 02:13:41,730
Okay, it's fine.

3206
02:13:41,970 --> 02:13:43,690
He is so racist against rocks.

3207
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:47,410
He is so racist against rocks.

3208
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:49,510
He is so racist against rocks.

3209
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:50,190
Alright, nice, alright.

3210
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:51,390
We're walking over.

3211
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:53,670
We're slowly walking over.

3212
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:56,330
Still haven't changed, Erlan.

3213
02:13:56,790 --> 02:13:58,710
Still hate rock people.

3214
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:00,630
Thank god.

3215
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,830
Haven't changed a single bit.

3216
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:10,270
Get over here.

3217
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:12,070
Get over here.

3218
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:16,820
Okay.

3219
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:18,800
Oh, I'm scared.

3220
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:19,460
Please.

3221
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:21,140
I'm so scared.

3222
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:22,980
What?!

3223
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:24,720
Okay, alright.

3224
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,660
I had to do that.

3225
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:26,560
I don't know what happened.

3226
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,740
It just stopped working.

3227
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:31,640
I don't know what...

3228
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:32,320
Okay.

3229
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,660
Nothing is working out for me right now.

3230
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:37,300
Nothing is working out for me!

3231
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:39,740
Please.

3232
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:42,120
Please don't look at me like this.

3233
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:45,140
Okay, that's fine.

3234
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:53,000
Oh, god.

3235
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:53,820
Oh, thank god.

3236
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:54,100
Okay.

3237
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:55,560
Spin.

3238
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:56,580
Just keep spinning.

3239
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:57,540
Just keep spinning.

3240
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:59,100
Something will work.

3241
02:14:59,240 --> 02:14:59,480
Whoa!

3242
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:01,920
Just keep spinning.

3243
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:02,360
Whoa!

3244
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:02,820
Okay.

3245
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:04,600
Okay, we're fine.

3246
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:05,220
We're fine.

3247
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:06,480
Whoa!

3248
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,220
We're fine.

3249
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,520
We're...

3250
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,440
We're not fine.

3251
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:11,640
But like I like to say that we're fine even though I know we're not.

3252
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:14,420
Does it hit?

3253
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:15,240
No!

3254
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,220
It hits but it doesn't matter!

3255
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,300
It never matters!

3256
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:27,910
Oh, my god.

3257
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:29,050
I can't see the sword.

3258
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:30,350
Oh, shit!

3259
02:15:30,430 --> 02:15:30,630
Okay.

3260
02:15:34,370 --> 02:15:34,890
No!

3261
02:15:35,070 --> 02:15:35,350
Okay.

3262
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:37,310
Oh, okay.

3263
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:39,230
No, it doesn't matter either.

3264
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:42,430
Why are you like this?

3265
02:15:44,950 --> 02:15:47,390
I feel like you have so much in life.

3266
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:49,010
I'm just a little monkey.

3267
02:15:49,670 --> 02:15:51,670
I'm just a little monkey.

3268
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:57,510
No!

3269
02:15:57,610 --> 02:15:58,070
Armor

3270
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:02,090
ready!

3271
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:09,320
Just a fucking monkey!

3272
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:12,840
Okay.

3273
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:14,340
That's good.

3274
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:14,980
I got it.

3275
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:16,500
I got it.

3276
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:17,980
But I need a heal.

3277
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:20,460
And then just...

3278
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:21,340
Win!

3279
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,400
Are you serious?

3280
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,380
Are you okay?

3281
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:29,920
Okay.

3282
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:31,380
Okay.

3283
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:33,940
Okay.

3284
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:35,460
Okay.

3285
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,760
That's actually not fair.

3286
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:40,060
I'm not gonna lie.

3287
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:40,820
Like...

3288
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:44,740
That should not have been fair.

3289
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:49,020
Okay, who hits first?

3290
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:49,240
Me.

3291
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,420
That's fucking where I'm coming over.

3292
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:56,700
I'm coming over.

3293
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:59,060
I'm coming over to spin.

3294
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,720
That's fucking right!

3295
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:05,380
Oh, shit!

3296
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:07,760
No!

3297
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:09,260
Spin!

3298
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,120
Oh, shit!

3299
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:15,080
We didn't need it, but like...

3300
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:16,480
I...

3301
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:17,780
I was scared.

3302
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,940
I know...

3303
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:23,520
I know we didn't need it, but...

3304
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:24,880
You don't understand.

3305
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:26,000
I was so scared.

3306
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:26,920
You don't...

3307
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:28,600
You don't understand.

3308
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:29,780
You don't understand.

3309
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:30,300
You don't understand.

3310
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:33,240
You don't understand.

3311
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:34,820
You don't understand.

3312
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:36,240
That's right!

3313
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:36,920
Look it!

3314
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,560
You're gonna die now, bitch!

3315
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,800
That's fucking right!

3316
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:43,960
What!

3317
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,600
What!

3318
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:50,320
Are you fucking...

3319
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:54,540
There's no way.

3320
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:56,640
There's actually no way.

3321
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:58,020
There's no way...

3322
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:59,540
There's no way he just did that...

3323
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:12,940
Guys,

3324
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:26,760
there's no name.

3325
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,120
Guys, there's a face too.

3326
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:29,240
There was no name.

3327
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:34,040
No name showed up.

3328
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:40,360
I can't bel- now he decides it was time to fucking not be racist.

3329
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:45,420
Like, what a character development.

3330
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:48,960
What a fucking character development.

3331
02:18:57,580 --> 02:18:59,120
Oh my god.

3332
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:01,580
What happened to me?

3333
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:03,380
Last time I threw people.

3334
02:19:03,500 --> 02:19:04,320
Oh, Zizu.

3335
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:04,980
Zizu.

3336
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,180
Hanzo, thank you for the super chat.

3337
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:08,360
Thank you.

3338
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:12,220
Oh shit, I'm fucking huge.

3339
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,500
I'm a big monkey.

3340
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:17,120
Did I do it?

3341
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:18,700
But I'm still in a fight!

3342
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:22,560
Oh, it's Kaiju.

3343
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:24,200
Oh my god.

3344
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:26,340
Wait, that's him!

3345
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:27,200
No!

3346
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:27,600
Yes!

3347
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:29,580
I knew you were ugly on the inside!

3348
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:32,940
I knew it!

3349
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,040
I knew it!

3350
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:36,120
You were ugly on the inside, you bitch!

3351
02:19:36,660 --> 02:19:38,360
At least I look the same!

3352
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:40,600
At least I look the same!

3353
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:42,820
Oh, you've been thinking of me?

3354
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:44,320
Bro, what the fuck?

3355
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:46,240
Is this a bromance?

3356
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,780
Why isn't that my king?

3357
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:50,300
Why isn't that my king?

3358
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:53,320
Oh my god.

3359
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:54,760
He's been thinking of me, guys.

3360
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:59,280
It's the inside that counts.

3361
02:19:59,360 --> 02:19:59,700
Exactly.

3362
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:02,340
My inside was the same as my outside.

3363
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:05,300
His inside was so fucking ugly.

3364
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:08,300
I knew he was compensating.

3365
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:13,000
What?

3366
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:20,560
Here comes the four guys.

3367
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:21,240
Can I die?

3368
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:23,560
I can die!

3369
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,760
Guys, I get an

3370
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:31,550
attack!

3371
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:32,370
Boom!

3372
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:33,090
Boom!

3373
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:35,410
That's fucking right.

3374
02:20:35,410 --> 02:20:36,630
Oh, that's...

3375
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:37,690
Oh, it's that!

3376
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:38,270
Okay.

3377
02:20:41,010 --> 02:20:41,990
Okay, that's right.

3378
02:20:42,130 --> 02:20:43,090
Get over here!

3379
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:44,750
Get your ass over here!

3380
02:20:44,890 --> 02:20:45,430
Don't worry!

3381
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:46,530
That's right!

3382
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:48,610
You were just playing the instrument!

3383
02:20:48,910 --> 02:20:49,950
Beat your ass!

3384
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:55,030
I like how that guy was literally just trying to play on his guitar.

3385
02:20:55,230 --> 02:20:56,230
Get over here!

3386
02:20:57,210 --> 02:21:00,210
You think you can just play on your guitar like that?

3387
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:01,590
You really think?

3388
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:03,110
That's right.

3389
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:04,650
No music allowed!

3390
02:21:07,390 --> 02:21:09,690
No fucking music allowed!

3391
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:12,950
That's fucking right!

3392
02:21:16,170 --> 02:21:17,270
He's the bard!

3393
02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:18,670
Where's the bard?

3394
02:21:19,410 --> 02:21:20,370
Get over here!

3395
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:21,690
I'm fucking gonna beat up the bard!

3396
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:23,570
No fuzz!

3397
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:24,830
No fuzz for you!

3398
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:25,510
Oh, I killed him!

3399
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:27,370
No more bard for you!

3400
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:29,070
No more music!

3401
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:30,870
Oh, you're gonna run away?

3402
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:31,850
No.

3403
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:34,310
I'm gonna target you specifically!

3404
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,110
That's me!

3405
02:21:41,710 --> 02:21:43,550
No music for you!

3406
02:21:47,110 --> 02:21:49,790
No more music in this game!

3407
02:21:54,330 --> 02:21:55,070
That's right!

3408
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:57,490
He's fucking dead!

3409
02:21:57,670 --> 02:21:58,730
Where's the music, man?

3410
02:21:58,990 --> 02:22:00,010
Get over here!

3411
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:02,370
That's right!

3412
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:04,950
Use the music, man!

3413
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:06,950
You're fucking next!

3414
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:08,670
You're next!

3415
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:10,570
I'm canceling the music program!

3416
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:13,590
I'm gonna cancel the music program!

3417
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:17,370
Nobody deserves music in this classroom!

3418
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:19,330
He's running!

3419
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:22,790
Get out!

3420
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:25,550
I'm gonna beat your ass with your own fucking lute!

3421
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:26,530
Yeah!

3422
02:22:27,090 --> 02:22:28,670
Music is cancelled!

3423
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:33,670
He just wants to play the guitar!

3424
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:35,270
Leave him alone!

3425
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:38,190
Music has now been cancelled, chat!

3426
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:43,790
He's fucking dead!

3427
02:22:45,570 --> 02:22:47,030
That's fucking right!

3428
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:48,630
Bro, he's a dragon now?

3429
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:49,450
Holy shit!

3430
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:50,150
No!

3431
02:22:50,250 --> 02:22:53,210
He wanted to play the music donkey!

3432
02:22:54,250 --> 02:22:54,970
No!

3433
02:22:56,810 --> 02:23:00,090
Why would you do that to him?

3434
02:23:00,190 --> 02:23:02,510
He just wants the fuck to play music!

3435
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:06,030
That's fucking right!

3436
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:10,910
Oh my god, the last...

3437
02:23:10,910 --> 02:23:11,970
What the fuck?

3438
02:23:13,210 --> 02:23:14,390
Oh, he's gone.

3439
02:23:16,730 --> 02:23:17,330
What's he doing?

3440
02:23:19,130 --> 02:23:20,490
What the fuck?

3441
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:24,050
Oh, you thought that would stop me?

3442
02:23:24,970 --> 02:23:26,830
I was born from a fucking rock!

3443
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:28,050
Get out!

3444
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:30,050
You can't break rocks!

3445
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:31,030
We become sand!

3446
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:34,550
And then we'll get into your lungs!

3447
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:35,610
And then you'll die!

3448
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:39,910
That's right!

3449
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:40,990
Oh, the last guy.

3450
02:23:41,350 --> 02:23:43,910
Oh, I'm gonna use my special ability on you.

3451
02:23:43,970 --> 02:23:44,810
I don't know what this is.

3452
02:23:45,370 --> 02:23:46,550
Oh, that's what it is.

3453
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:47,350
That's fucking right.

3454
02:23:47,470 --> 02:23:48,110
Get over here.

3455
02:23:48,530 --> 02:23:49,210
Yeah, that's right.

3456
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:59,780
The last dragon in Asia.

3457
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:06,440
Now all dragons are extinct.

3458
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:09,220
I killed the final dragon in China.

3459
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:12,540
Only monkeys allowed.

3460
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:28,520
Wait, what?

3461
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:30,960
I have to do another boss fight?

3462
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:33,540
What you gonna do?

3463
02:24:33,620 --> 02:24:35,520
You have no fucking music anymore.

3464
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:38,640
You have no more music, Erlang!

3465
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:41,260
What the fuck are you gonna do?

3466
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:44,420
That's fucking right, Erlang!

3467
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:45,340
Look at you!

3468
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:48,360
Trying to pretend to be a skinny boy!

3469
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:50,920
Look at you!

3470
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:52,800
You're so ugly in the outside!

3471
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:53,900
Wait, I can die.

3472
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:55,140
Wait, wait a minute.

3473
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:55,820
Wait a minute.

3474
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,520
Wait a minute.

3475
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,020
Wait a minute.

3476
02:24:58,100 --> 02:24:59,140
I think I can actually die.

3477
02:24:59,280 --> 02:24:59,860
Wait a minute.

3478
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:00,140
Oh, wait.

3479
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:00,560
No, I healed.

3480
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:01,380
Oh, thank god.

3481
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:01,700
Okay.

3482
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:04,500
Oh my god.

3483
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:05,460
Wait, my HP.

3484
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:09,440
My HP is not going so well, guys.

3485
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:14,640
I got a little worried there.

3486
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:16,460
I got a little worried, guys.

3487
02:25:20,220 --> 02:25:20,580
Okay.

3488
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:22,380
Freeze!

3489
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:24,780
Wait, what?

3490
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,080
What the fuck?

3491
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:31,480
Get down here!

3492
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:32,060
Oh, shit!

3493
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:33,460
Oh, what?

3494
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:38,780
Guys, this is why I don't... Guys, this is what I meant by, like, I don't use, like...

3495
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:40,760
I don't use the rock parry thing.

3496
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:43,860
Guys, I don't think I should be a parrier, guys.

3497
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:49,180
I can't parry!

3498
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,120
I can't parry, guys!

3499
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:52,100
I don't know how!

3500
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,860
I don't know how to parry, guys!

3501
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:57,820
I don't know how to parry everybody!

3502
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:02,520
How do you parry?

3503
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:04,940
I don't know!

3504
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:08,000
Anyway...

3505
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:11,200
Holy shit.

3506
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:13,240
Why are you so fucking tanky?

3507
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:15,580
Oh, now you don't have a sword.

3508
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:18,820
Become rock when he hits.

3509
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:22,480
Look at you.

3510
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:27,360
You couldn't have learned today.

3511
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:30,120
I missed.

3512
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:34,040
Guys, I never parried in fucking Bloodborne.

3513
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:35,480
I'm never parrying here.

3514
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:39,220
I think I hit, like, one parry throughout this entire fight.

3515
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,460
Like, I'm pretty sure.

3516
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,180
What the fuck?

3517
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,700
He has another sword?

3518
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:47,400
Where's... I have hands!

3519
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,580
This is actually bullshit.

3520
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,780
I literally have hands.

3521
02:26:55,940 --> 02:26:56,380
Like...

3522
02:26:58,100 --> 02:26:59,200
What the fuck?

3523
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:01,560
This is so bullshit!

3524
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:03,900
All I have are hands!

3525
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:10,340
Parrying is a crutch.

3526
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,580
I beat Orphil Cosmo with no parry.

3527
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:15,820
It's not like... I'm not trying to brag or anything.

3528
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,760
I'm just... I just don't know how to play the game.

3529
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,200
Oh!

3530
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:25,400
Okay, it's fine.

3531
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:29,580
Oh, god!

3532
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,260
Okay, it's fine.

3533
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:35,020
Guys, I'm trying to turn it into a rock, but it won't let me!

3534
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,640
I'm trying to turn it into a rock, but it's not letting me, guys!

3535
02:28:06,350 --> 02:28:07,790
You liars!

3536
02:28:08,030 --> 02:28:10,370
You fucking liars!

3537
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:13,710
You told me you can't die!

3538
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:17,290
I fucking played as if I...

3539
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:23,130
I fucking played as if I was damn invincible!

3540
02:28:23,130 --> 02:28:23,310
damn invincible!

3541
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:27,130
Oh my god!

3542
02:28:28,090 --> 02:28:30,410
Oh my god!

3543
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:38,250
I fought as if I was... I thought I thought... because I fought the guys about death or die, guys!

3544
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:41,990
I mean, that's my OG.

3545
02:28:42,730 --> 02:28:45,650
I didn't realize you could actually die!

3546
02:28:51,010 --> 02:28:53,650
I thought I was invincible!

3547
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:55,390
I...

3548
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:59,090
I legitimately thought I could be...

3549
02:28:59,090 --> 02:29:01,730
I could be invincible!

3550
02:29:02,410 --> 02:29:03,950
Now I have to try?

3551
02:29:06,650 --> 02:29:08,490
What do you mean?

3552
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:12,390
I have to try now?

3553
02:29:16,690 --> 02:29:17,650
No!

3554
02:29:20,750 --> 02:29:22,930
You never felt it, friend!

3555
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:26,070
No!

3556
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:27,330
No!

3557
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:27,930
No!

3558
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:34,750
You're the only person I'm that special, guys.

3559
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:37,950
What can I say?

3560
02:29:38,050 --> 02:29:39,310
I'm so special.

3561
02:29:39,690 --> 02:29:41,170
What can I say?

3562
02:29:41,470 --> 02:29:43,690
Now I actually have to try.

3563
02:29:46,090 --> 02:29:47,810
Oh my god, help!

3564
02:29:48,830 --> 02:29:52,790
I'm damn prepared in my fucking life or life!

3565
02:29:54,510 --> 02:29:58,410
Why do you do this to me?!

3566
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:02,930
Why do you force me to learn?!

3567
02:30:02,930 --> 02:30:05,270
I don't wanna learn!

3568
02:30:05,670 --> 02:30:07,550
That's why I'm a streamer!

3569
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:15,790
You gotta learn, but I don't wanna learn!

3570
02:30:23,050 --> 02:30:24,710
You're supposed to have...

3571
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:31,110
Guys, I don't know if you've noticed this, but the moment I heard that, like, I don't die, I was definitely not paying attention.

3572
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:34,090
I just kept trying to... I just was left-clicking.

3573
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:35,890
Literally!

3574
02:30:37,650 --> 02:30:42,030
I was just left-clicking the entire time because I was like, woo!

3575
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:45,630
I don't need...

3576
02:30:45,790 --> 02:30:46,410
I can't die!

3577
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:47,930
That's what the...

3578
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:51,410
I parry.

3579
02:30:54,130 --> 02:30:56,690
Click the other buttons too.

3580
02:30:56,790 --> 02:30:58,610
I was like, eventually he'll die.

3581
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:01,390
Alright.

3582
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:02,450
Ice tab.

3583
02:31:02,990 --> 02:31:06,650
Oh fuck, I thought he was gonna do that thing, you know?

3584
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:09,470
The whip!

3585
02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:11,790
Hey, who gave him the whip?!

3586
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:14,830
There we go.

3587
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:16,810
Now I'm parrying!

3588
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:19,290
Now I'm actually parrying, guys!

3589
02:31:21,790 --> 02:31:24,730
Now I'm actually parrying, guys!

3590
02:31:25,790 --> 02:31:29,870
Now that I know that you can actually die!

3591
02:31:33,970 --> 02:31:35,870
Character development.

3592
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:38,130
Right here.

3593
02:31:38,830 --> 02:31:40,630
Actual character development.

3594
02:31:40,870 --> 02:31:42,610
Not by choice too.

3595
02:31:46,150 --> 02:31:47,970
Not by fucking choice.

3596
02:31:48,350 --> 02:31:50,210
Not by fucking choice.

3597
02:31:50,210 --> 02:31:50,610
Not by fucking choice.

3598
02:31:50,850 --> 02:31:52,050
Not by fucking choice.

3599
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:53,290
The character art.

3600
02:31:53,450 --> 02:31:53,590
The character art.

3601
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:55,110
I can't believe it.

3602
02:31:55,550 --> 02:31:57,510
I can't believe it, Earl.

3603
02:31:57,590 --> 02:31:58,290
I hate you.

3604
02:31:58,450 --> 02:31:59,690
I fucking hate you.

3605
02:31:59,690 --> 02:32:01,130
You forced me to learn to parry.

3606
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:06,030
She's learning at the end of the game.

3607
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:08,610
Wait, what?

3608
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:10,150
What the fuck?

3609
02:32:10,150 --> 02:32:10,930
What the fuck?

3610
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:11,870
What the fuck?

3611
02:32:18,430 --> 02:32:18,990
Oh!

3612
02:32:19,170 --> 02:32:19,950
Oh my god!

3613
02:32:19,970 --> 02:32:20,590
I'm so badass!

3614
02:32:21,290 --> 02:32:22,830
I was scripted!

3615
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:23,910
I was scripted!

3616
02:32:24,350 --> 02:32:26,510
Are you fucking serious?

3617
02:32:30,810 --> 02:32:33,110
Oh thank god I was scripted.

3618
02:32:33,110 --> 02:32:36,630
I was gonna be so mad if it was not scripted.

3619
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:39,190
I was gonna be so mad, Earl.

3620
02:32:39,210 --> 02:32:40,090
You don't understand.

3621
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:41,610
You don't understand.

3622
02:32:42,010 --> 02:32:43,150
You don't wanna make me mad.

3623
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:45,690
You don't wanna make me mad, Earl.

3624
02:32:45,730 --> 02:32:48,650
You don't fucking wanna make me mad.

3625
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:50,550
Get over here.

3626
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:52,450
I'm gonna use...

3627
02:32:52,450 --> 02:32:54,190
Oh, I can't even use ice.

3628
02:32:54,450 --> 02:32:55,630
Oh my god, it doesn't even matter.

3629
02:32:55,690 --> 02:32:56,950
You're so fucking weak now.

3630
02:32:57,710 --> 02:32:58,730
That's fucking right.

3631
02:32:58,890 --> 02:32:59,890
Life steal.

3632
02:33:00,850 --> 02:33:02,570
I'm gonna life steal.

3633
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,270
That's right.

3634
02:33:05,270 --> 02:33:06,850
You can't do jack shit!

3635
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:08,890
I had to learn!

3636
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:13,690
I had to fucking learn how to play this game!

3637
02:33:13,810 --> 02:33:15,170
At the last moment!

3638
02:33:17,650 --> 02:33:21,590
It only took the final chapter to learn!

3639
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:24,670
She's killing it.

3640
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:29,970
I evolved.

3641
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:32,630
Let's fucking go!

3642
02:33:33,590 --> 02:33:34,830
That's right!

3643
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:36,370
That's right!

3644
02:33:36,670 --> 02:33:38,250
You can't do shit!

3645
02:33:38,350 --> 02:33:39,950
You can't do shit!

3646
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:40,890
Another heavy!

3647
02:33:41,950 --> 02:33:42,910
And another!

3648
02:33:45,150 --> 02:33:46,090
Oh yeah!

3649
02:33:46,350 --> 02:33:46,890
Yeah!

3650
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:48,030
You took my frames!

3651
02:33:48,210 --> 02:33:49,170
You took the baby!

3652
02:33:50,510 --> 02:33:53,450
You took everything I ever loved about this game!

3653
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:57,230
I had to spare!

3654
02:33:57,510 --> 02:33:59,170
I had to parry!

3655
02:34:01,630 --> 02:34:04,250
I can't use magic anymore!

3656
02:34:05,750 --> 02:34:07,010
There we go, we did it.

3657
02:34:07,590 --> 02:34:08,210
Nice.

3658
02:34:08,570 --> 02:34:09,190
That's right.

3659
02:34:10,090 --> 02:34:11,790
You took my drips!

3660
02:34:12,370 --> 02:34:16,210
I had to wear such ugly clothes because of you!

3661
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:19,490
You made me learn!

3662
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:25,250
You made me learn!

3663
02:34:25,950 --> 02:34:27,410
Synapses are firing!

3664
02:34:27,410 --> 02:34:28,570
You were so back!

3665
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:31,090
Thank you for the super chat!

3666
02:34:31,150 --> 02:34:31,630
Thank you!

3667
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:34,790
You made me unfashionable!

3668
02:34:34,990 --> 02:34:36,690
I didn't look hip anymore!

3669
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:48,560
Oh shit!

3670
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:50,620
Oh shit!

3671
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,340
What the fuck?

3672
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:53,300
What is this fight?

3673
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:55,440
I'm just Bunga Bunga Smash!

3674
02:34:58,700 --> 02:35:00,100
Phase 4!

3675
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:01,140
Phase 4!

3676
02:35:01,140 --> 02:35:01,400
What?

3677
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:10,780
Oh shit!

3678
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:12,000
Oh shit!

3679
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:15,040
Okay, that's badass!

3680
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,800
Okay, that's badass!

3681
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:17,460
Badass!

3682
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:35,880
Just stab his third eye out.

3683
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:39,860
That's right Erlong.

3684
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:44,280
And now that I know that you're ugly on the inside.

3685
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:47,800
Now I know I'm...

3686
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:49,900
Now I know you mean nothing.

3687
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,980
Your words don't hurt anymore.

3688
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:54,500
Oh!

3689
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:54,580
Oh!

3690
02:35:58,680 --> 02:36:01,100
At least I...

3691
02:36:01,770 --> 02:36:04,620
Just how I look on the inside too.

3692
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:17,990
Oh?

3693
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:23,890
Hey, that's me!

3694
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:26,930
Where'd my subtitles go?

3695
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:31,470
That's me though!

3696
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:37,570
Oh!

3697
02:36:39,310 --> 02:36:41,050
Forced Doki to learn pairing.

3698
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:42,170
Game of the year.

3699
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:43,110
Hahaha!

3700
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:51,350
Come out!

3701
02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:52,990
Come out!

3702
02:36:54,030 --> 02:36:55,030
These are his memories!

3703
02:36:55,550 --> 02:36:56,630
It's from the...

3704
02:36:57,250 --> 02:36:57,530
Yeah!

3705
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:00,370
And that's the real Wukong.

3706
02:37:00,510 --> 02:37:02,530
I'm also the real Wukong too, guys!

3707
02:37:02,830 --> 02:37:03,390
Like...

3708
02:37:04,690 --> 02:37:06,650
We're both Wukongs!

3709
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:10,950
He even stole my voice?!

3710
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:11,530
He even stole my voice?!

3711
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:12,870
Erlong, what the fuck?!

3712
02:37:12,870 --> 02:37:13,490
Hahaha!

3713
02:37:18,090 --> 02:37:20,910
He even stole my fucking voice!

3714
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:22,650
Hahaha!

3715
02:37:23,430 --> 02:37:24,150
Hahaha!

3716
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:24,190
Hahaha!

3717
02:37:26,650 --> 02:37:29,630
Are we bros now?

3718
02:37:29,910 --> 02:37:30,590
Hahaha!

3719
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:33,550
Hahaha!

3720
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:41,830
Hahaha!

3721
02:37:57,170 --> 02:37:58,470
Are we bros now?

3722
02:38:00,350 --> 02:38:03,970
Oh my god!

3723
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:07,370
He's been helping me this entire time?!

3724
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:11,530
But why the fuck you made me change my outfit?!

3725
02:38:11,530 --> 02:38:11,830
But why the fuck you made me change my outfit?!

3726
02:38:11,850 --> 02:38:12,550
Didn't you like...

3727
02:38:13,710 --> 02:38:14,510
Doki, you don't understand.

3728
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:15,710
You have to make it look real.

3729
02:38:16,310 --> 02:38:16,690
Hahaha!

3730
02:38:17,890 --> 02:38:19,230
Doki, you don't understand.

3731
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:20,810
You have to make it look real.

3732
02:38:21,070 --> 02:38:23,030
So that people won't suspect.

3733
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:29,330
I needed to learn.

3734
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:29,830
Hahaha!

3735
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:43,170
I can't figure it out.

3736
02:38:43,170 --> 02:38:45,870
It's just that Qian Yin doesn't know enough.

3737
02:38:46,830 --> 02:38:47,450
I can't figure it out.

3738
02:38:48,190 --> 02:38:51,090
In this world, there's no one who can't figure it out.

3739
02:38:51,090 --> 02:38:53,850
Why is Baby Buddha so fucking many polygons?!

3740
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:56,190
Why is Baby Buddha so fucking many polygons?!

3741
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:57,310
I swear, every time!

3742
02:38:57,590 --> 02:39:01,410
Every time the baby shows up, he takes up all my frames.

3743
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:03,890
Like, first it's Erlong, now it's the baby.

3744
02:39:04,410 --> 02:39:05,010
Like...

3745
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:13,870
We need more polygons.

3746
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:14,350
We need more polygons.

3747
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:18,410
The head must be around.

3748
02:39:19,150 --> 02:39:19,770
The head must be around.

3749
02:39:19,770 --> 02:39:20,590
We did it!

3750
02:39:21,170 --> 02:39:22,390
We did it!

3751
02:39:22,390 --> 02:39:25,790
He fucking did all that just to teach me how to parry!

3752
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:27,110
That's so messed up!

3753
02:39:28,990 --> 02:39:30,910
Transform into stone money.

3754
02:39:31,010 --> 02:39:32,890
Gaining immunity to shock and poison.

3755
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:34,290
Absorb.

3756
02:39:34,590 --> 02:39:35,630
Retain axes.

3757
02:39:35,750 --> 02:39:36,290
Destined one.

3758
02:39:36,310 --> 02:39:38,130
Convert any pre-formation...

3759
02:39:38,130 --> 02:39:38,910
Is this a good spell?

3760
02:39:39,230 --> 02:39:40,170
What does it take over?

3761
02:39:41,330 --> 02:39:41,950
Okay.

3762
02:39:44,350 --> 02:39:45,370
Transform is OP.

3763
02:39:45,790 --> 02:39:46,270
Okay.

3764
02:39:49,570 --> 02:39:50,970
What a homie.

3765
02:39:51,330 --> 02:39:53,250
Taught me how to transform!

3766
02:39:58,450 --> 02:40:01,950
I can't believe he taught me how to fucking transform.

3767
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:06,430
Wait, do I have it?

3768
02:40:06,470 --> 02:40:07,050
Oh, I have it now.

3769
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:09,270
I was trying to craft it.

3770
02:40:09,610 --> 02:40:12,790
The game's like, you have it already, Doki.

3771
02:40:12,910 --> 02:40:14,190
What the fuck are you doing?

3772
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:17,090
I couldn't tell.

3773
02:40:17,310 --> 02:40:19,390
I've been through so much, guys.

3774
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:21,650
I've been through so much.

3775
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:23,190
I can't tell anymore.

3776
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:24,270
Alright.

3777
02:40:25,130 --> 02:40:25,730
Okay.

3778
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:26,970
Alright.

3779
02:40:27,730 --> 02:40:28,930
Oh my god.

3780
02:40:29,170 --> 02:40:30,830
That was fucking hell.

3781
02:40:32,630 --> 02:40:33,230
Okay.

3782
02:40:34,970 --> 02:40:36,570
Okay, where is my...

3783
02:40:36,570 --> 02:40:38,530
Okay, we got that.

3784
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:39,790
Oh my god, thank god.

3785
02:40:39,890 --> 02:40:41,210
Now I can look cool.

3786
02:40:42,090 --> 02:40:43,630
Now I can look cool again.

3787
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:48,110
Thank god.

3788
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:49,330
Thank god.

3789
02:40:49,330 --> 02:40:50,170
I'm back, baby.

3790
02:40:50,510 --> 02:40:52,050
I'm cool again, guys.

3791
02:40:52,370 --> 02:40:53,090
Forgive me.

3792
02:40:54,350 --> 02:40:54,910
Okay.

3793
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:56,590
What do I want?

3794
02:40:56,850 --> 02:40:58,670
What do I want to put back?

3795
02:40:58,850 --> 02:40:59,510
Oh yeah, immobilize.

3796
02:40:59,950 --> 02:41:01,950
I need to put back immobilize, guys.

3797
02:41:04,130 --> 02:41:06,070
Oh no, what was my thing?

3798
02:41:09,210 --> 02:41:10,330
My thing...

3799
02:41:10,970 --> 02:41:12,390
My thing looks...

3800
02:41:12,390 --> 02:41:13,730
My thing is so messy.

3801
02:41:14,350 --> 02:41:15,530
I don't even remember what I had.

3802
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:16,230
I don't...

3803
02:41:19,350 --> 02:41:20,630
I don't even...

3804
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:21,030
I don't even...

3805
02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:22,330
This looks so fucking messy.

3806
02:41:22,870 --> 02:41:24,050
It's a mess.

3807
02:41:24,370 --> 02:41:26,530
We don't need staff spin anymore, guys, right?

3808
02:41:26,610 --> 02:41:27,870
Yeah, we don't need that anymore.

3809
02:41:28,730 --> 02:41:29,750
We don't need that.

3810
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:32,730
Guys, we don't need that.

3811
02:41:34,750 --> 02:41:35,230
Okay.

3812
02:41:36,610 --> 02:41:37,090
Uh...

3813
02:41:37,090 --> 02:41:41,110
I don't need a spin anymore, chat.

3814
02:41:41,410 --> 02:41:43,910
I don't need a spin anymore, chat.

3815
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:45,710
Okay.

3816
02:41:46,570 --> 02:41:47,810
No more spin.

3817
02:41:48,370 --> 02:41:49,410
And then...

3818
02:41:49,410 --> 02:41:50,210
Thrust.

3819
02:41:50,330 --> 02:41:50,630
Okay.

3820
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:52,070
We have to get all of thrust?

3821
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:57,320
No spin.

3822
02:41:57,440 --> 02:41:58,000
No mana.

3823
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,320
No spin.

3824
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:01,620
We are supposed to play immobilize!

3825
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:02,600
Okay, fuck.

3826
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:02,980
Okay.

3827
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:04,500
We don't need smash either.

3828
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:07,900
We don't need any of these.

3829
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:10,280
We can have immobilize again.

3830
02:42:10,660 --> 02:42:11,880
Okay, we need three.

3831
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:13,880
Um...

3832
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:14,120
Um...

3833
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:17,520
Uh... What do we not need?

3834
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:19,320
Okay, we can get rid of one of this.

3835
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:22,280
And then we can put it in immobilize.

3836
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:24,560
Okay, there we go.

3837
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:26,480
Alright.

3838
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:28,680
Okay, there we go.

3839
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:29,580
Now we can thrust.

3840
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:30,940
And now we can pluck.

3841
02:42:32,740 --> 02:42:33,140
Uh...

3842
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:34,400
Oh, yeah.

3843
02:42:34,660 --> 02:42:37,160
Apparently the transform is good.

3844
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:38,980
Which one is it?

3845
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:39,200
Is this?

3846
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:40,940
What am I?

3847
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:42,040
The fuck?

3848
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:42,700
Oh, that's me!

3849
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:47,080
Transform into monkey gaining immunity.

3850
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:48,040
Okay, nice.

3851
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:51,160
Build up focus and cast a variety of spells.

3852
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:52,020
Heavy attack.

3853
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:53,840
Okay.

3854
02:42:55,060 --> 02:42:56,440
Now I'm rock monkey.

3855
02:42:57,240 --> 02:42:57,740
Nice.

3856
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:00,280
Alright, now that we have that...

3857
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:02,320
What if...

3858
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:04,540
Big baby.

3859
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:06,240
Never forget.

3860
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:08,300
Don't worry, big baby.

3861
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:09,820
I told you I'll bring you back.

3862
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:14,340
I told you I'll bring you back, big baby.

3863
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:16,340
Hahaha.

3864
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:17,940
Hahaha.

3865
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:21,660
It was just this one time, big baby.

3866
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:22,820
I swear to God.

3867
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:25,140
It was just this one time.

3868
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:26,780
Big baby.

3869
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:32,060
Yeah, that build was... That build was pretty good.

3870
02:43:32,980 --> 02:43:34,520
That build was pretty good.

3871
02:43:34,580 --> 02:43:35,460
I spinned.

3872
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:38,440
Okay, I wanna grab...

3873
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:39,420
I want the mana.

3874
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:41,660
Uh...

3875
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:43,560
We'll have the mana again.

3876
02:43:44,060 --> 02:43:44,660
Okay.

3877
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:46,440
Nice.

3878
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:46,600
See?

3879
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:47,420
Look, this is how...

3880
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:49,640
This is how cool I actually was, okay?

3881
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:50,360
This is...

3882
02:43:51,580 --> 02:43:53,240
This is how Erlan's fought.

3883
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:01,780
We got custody back.

3884
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:05,720
After Erlan was like, haha, JK.

3885
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:06,500
It was all a test.

3886
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:09,020
Um, we re-adopted the baby.

3887
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:14,530
He gave me back the kids.

3888
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:18,150
He was like, JK, I never wanted this kid anyway.

3889
02:44:18,210 --> 02:44:19,190
It was just to fuck with you.

3890
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:21,050
And then he gave me back the baby.

3891
02:44:23,630 --> 02:44:25,810
Didn't Erlan make us kill our wife's friend?

3892
02:44:26,570 --> 02:44:28,470
Look, like, it was just a prank.

3893
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:30,470
And, like, as a bro, like, I...

3894
02:44:31,430 --> 02:44:36,010
You know, like, you know, as a bro, sometimes, you know, bros like to prank you.

3895
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:36,890
You know?

3896
02:44:38,070 --> 02:44:41,670
Wow, this is an open area.

3897
02:44:41,990 --> 02:44:43,770
I wonder what's gonna happen here.

3898
02:44:44,290 --> 02:44:44,650
Hahaha.

3899
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:52,160
Yeah, as a bro, that happens sometimes, you know?

3900
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:57,400
Sometimes, they're like, wouldn't it be funny if you, like, kill your friend's wife?

3901
02:44:58,340 --> 02:45:00,760
And then he's like, bro, I didn't actually mean it.

3902
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:01,540
It was just a joke.

3903
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:02,300
But, like, whatever.

3904
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:03,800
That was pretty funny.

3905
02:45:06,620 --> 02:45:08,040
Oh, shit, it's guy with hair!

3906
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:11,980
You nasty slut.

3907
02:45:12,100 --> 02:45:13,160
Bro, he doesn't even have a mouth.

3908
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:14,200
How could he slander you?

3909
02:45:15,620 --> 02:45:16,820
You're gonna die today!

3910
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:26,700
We love a guy with a hand!

3911
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:29,280
Wait, is he actually gonna help me?

3912
02:45:30,060 --> 02:45:30,960
Okay, let's see.

3913
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:34,080
Smash!

3914
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:36,060
Poke!

3915
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:37,440
Oh, my God!

3916
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:38,540
You see that poke?

3917
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:39,760
Big Baby!

3918
02:45:39,860 --> 02:45:40,160
Oh!

3919
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:40,800
Oh!

3920
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:42,780
Boy, Big Baby does a lot of damage.

3921
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:43,420
What the fuck?

3922
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:46,900
That's actually a lot of damage.

3923
02:45:46,980 --> 02:45:47,920
Holy shit.

3924
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:49,240
That's crazy.

3925
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,260
Oh, my God!

3926
02:45:50,300 --> 02:45:50,780
That's also crazy.

3927
02:45:51,080 --> 02:45:51,260
Okay.

3928
02:45:53,060 --> 02:45:53,980
Oh, fuck.

3929
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:54,340
Okay.

3930
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,760
Um, I'll just do Rock Monkey time.

3931
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:58,300
I mean, I have to learn anyway.

3932
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:01,180
That's fucking right.

3933
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:01,640
Smash!

3934
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:03,780
Wait, where are you?

3935
02:46:04,860 --> 02:46:05,340
Smash!

3936
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:09,360
That's fucking right.

3937
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:11,620
Oh, my God, there's so many wheels.

3938
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:14,500
But, wait, where did, where did Drewbucka go?

3939
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:15,440
Again!

3940
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:19,200
Wait, where did he go again?

3941
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:22,180
What the fuck do you mean?

3942
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:27,540
What the?

3943
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:27,920
What?

3944
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:28,520
How did he?

3945
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:28,900
Okay.

3946
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:30,020
Okay.

3947
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:31,140
That's bullshit.

3948
02:46:31,440 --> 02:46:33,020
He left me again?

3949
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:35,700
Doki, it's just a prank on you.

3950
02:46:38,700 --> 02:46:39,340
Oh, yeah.

3951
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:39,920
He's like...

3952
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,700
He's just pranking you, too.

3953
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:44,380
Wait, does this work?

3954
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:45,160
On him?

3955
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:47,420
Spin!

3956
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:48,260
Oh, it does!

3957
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:49,540
Nice.

3958
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:51,900
It also works on him, too.

3959
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:53,740
Guys, I'm on fire right now.

3960
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:54,700
That's fine.

3961
02:46:59,080 --> 02:46:59,760
That's right!

3962
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:01,820
Okay.

3963
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:03,860
Just parry, bro!

3964
02:47:05,220 --> 02:47:06,900
Bro, why does he always leave?

3965
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:09,900
This is fine.

3966
02:47:09,940 --> 02:47:10,280
This is fine.

3967
02:47:10,340 --> 02:47:10,900
I can heal here.

3968
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:13,620
Wait, there's a wheel.

3969
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:15,660
Wait, everything is on fire.

3970
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:17,080
Wait a minute.

3971
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:18,080
This is not good.

3972
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:21,240
Okay, nice.

3973
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:23,180
Haha, you thought that was me?

3974
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:24,400
JK.

3975
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:26,320
Oh, shit.

3976
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,300
That's fine.

3977
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:29,120
Oh, shit.

3978
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:30,100
Okay, that's not fine.

3979
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:33,260
Thrust!

3980
02:47:33,700 --> 02:47:34,180
Nice!

3981
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:37,580
Oh, please let me get that heal.

3982
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:37,840
No!

3983
02:47:38,380 --> 02:47:39,820
Please let me get that... No!

3984
02:47:40,860 --> 02:47:42,600
Please let me get this heal!

3985
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:43,700
Oh!

3986
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:44,800
Guys!

3987
02:47:49,060 --> 02:47:51,400
I don't want to use my life-saving pallet!

3988
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:54,960
Oh, shit!

3989
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:56,500
This is okay.

3990
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:57,140
We're fine.

3991
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:01,860
Oh, we're not okay.

3992
02:48:05,470 --> 02:48:06,710
What the fuck is he doing?

3993
02:48:08,450 --> 02:48:09,410
Oh, shit!

3994
02:48:11,730 --> 02:48:12,210
Poke!

3995
02:48:14,130 --> 02:48:15,030
Come on, you solo!

3996
02:48:16,370 --> 02:48:17,050
Come on!

3997
02:48:17,090 --> 02:48:18,470
We just need one, two hits!

3998
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:19,330
Three hits!

3999
02:48:19,990 --> 02:48:20,650
Three hits!

4000
02:48:21,370 --> 02:48:21,870
Five hits!

4001
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:22,530
Six!

4002
02:48:22,590 --> 02:48:23,170
Okay, nice.

4003
02:48:23,170 --> 02:48:23,610
He's dead.

4004
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:26,890
We just need seven hits, guys.

4005
02:48:29,050 --> 02:48:29,810
That's okay.

4006
02:48:29,890 --> 02:48:30,510
We got...

4007
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:34,050
Oh, shit.

4008
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:34,630
I'm flying.

4009
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:36,370
I got to be a bird now.

4010
02:48:38,490 --> 02:48:40,830
I swear, Chibaka is so fucking useless.

4011
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,610
He always leaves me.

4012
02:48:42,710 --> 02:48:43,630
Oh, my God!

4013
02:48:43,810 --> 02:48:45,710
Did I break his fucking hand?

4014
02:48:47,450 --> 02:48:48,910
Oh, now you're...

4015
02:48:48,910 --> 02:48:49,530
Okay.

4016
02:48:51,370 --> 02:48:52,790
I got my cloud!

4017
02:48:53,450 --> 02:48:55,090
I got

4018
02:48:58,860 --> 02:48:59,420
my ride!

4019
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:02,520
I broke his wrist.

4020
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:02,740
Yeah!

4021
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:16,460
Bro, we could have got the cloud together after we killed the guy.

4022
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:18,740
You didn't...

4023
02:49:18,740 --> 02:49:21,320
You didn't have to go off and find it.

4024
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:22,540
We could have found it together.

4025
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:26,660
We could have gotten it in time.

4026
02:49:28,180 --> 02:49:31,740
We could have done this in 15 minutes.

4027
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:35,780
I still got it!

4028
02:49:35,860 --> 02:49:38,440
Okay, we still got this.

4029
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:45,160
Okay, this is...

4030
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:46,160
We got this.

4031
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:46,780
We got this.

4032
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:49,200
He's gonna...

4033
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:50,740
I got this.

4034
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:51,700
I can call the clouds now.

4035
02:49:53,820 --> 02:49:56,660
Okay, nice.

4036
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:58,980
Nice, I can ride the cloud.

4037
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:00,380
Is there anything else here?

4038
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:01,640
Let's see.

4039
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:02,880
Oh my god, fine, go thread.

4040
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,300
The one thing I've always wanted.

4041
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:07,120
Wait, where's my curios?

4042
02:50:07,960 --> 02:50:09,660
How did I lose all of it?

4043
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:11,360
What the fuck?

4044
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:14,720
Oh, there.

4045
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:15,580
Okay, it bugged out.

4046
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:18,740
I was gonna say, how did I just lost all my curios?

4047
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:20,980
Like, what happened?

4048
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:24,640
I'm like, did I lose it all?

4049
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:27,280
Do I go?

4050
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:32,100
Just go forward?

4051
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:35,320
What the fuck?

4052
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:37,620
The fuck is that?

4053
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:39,560
Guess I'll go over there.

4054
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:44,660
Supreme Celestial Inspector.

4055
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:45,740
Oh, it's him.

4056
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:47,380
He's that guy.

4057
02:50:49,100 --> 02:50:50,380
It's a guy I killed.

4058
02:50:56,290 --> 02:50:57,410
Reset my graphics.

4059
02:50:57,550 --> 02:50:57,910
You guys want...

4060
02:50:57,910 --> 02:51:01,550
Oh yeah, since Erlon is dead, we can have better graphics again.

4061
02:51:05,810 --> 02:51:10,970
Since he's dead, we can at least enjoy this.

4062
02:51:11,810 --> 02:51:13,270
Let's put this back.

4063
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:18,730
Not dead, since we beat him up, we can have this back.

4064
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:22,530
Like, since he... we passed his test.

4065
02:51:25,530 --> 02:51:26,470
Guys, JK.

4066
02:51:32,170 --> 02:51:33,210
Guess not.

4067
02:51:33,450 --> 02:51:35,790
I guess not, guys.

4068
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:38,330
I guess the game was like, no.

4069
02:51:40,410 --> 02:51:42,170
There's a boss to get to the final.

4070
02:51:42,250 --> 02:51:45,270
And for the cricket, you should use the item that reduces fire damage.

4071
02:51:45,490 --> 02:51:45,950
Okay.

4072
02:51:47,870 --> 02:51:48,890
Where is it?

4073
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:49,290
This one?

4074
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:52,110
Never mind.

4075
02:51:53,950 --> 02:51:54,810
Never mind.

4076
02:51:55,030 --> 02:51:55,590
Guys.

4077
02:51:57,330 --> 02:51:58,770
Guys, which one was it?

4078
02:51:59,710 --> 02:52:00,270
Guys.

4079
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:04,670
There's too many trees.

4080
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:08,030
There's too many trees, guys.

4081
02:52:08,210 --> 02:52:09,290
So, never mind.

4082
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:13,710
The trees are too intense, guys.

4083
02:52:14,310 --> 02:52:14,870
Okay.

4084
02:52:17,990 --> 02:52:18,550
Okay.

4085
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:21,070
Guys, I don't remember what we had.

4086
02:52:21,310 --> 02:52:22,010
I know.

4087
02:52:22,070 --> 02:52:25,030
I mean, the trees are too intense, chat.

4088
02:52:26,630 --> 02:52:29,750
We gotta chop down the trees.

4089
02:52:30,150 --> 02:52:35,170
We gotta chop down the trees so we can have our graphics back.

4090
02:52:36,190 --> 02:52:38,610
Get our frames back, chat.

4091
02:52:39,370 --> 02:52:41,810
We gotta get the frames back!

4092
02:52:44,410 --> 02:52:45,010
Okay.

4093
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:47,490
I don't remember what we had.

4094
02:52:47,490 --> 02:52:49,630
I don't remember.

4095
02:52:49,790 --> 02:52:54,370
I don't remember what we did.

4096
02:52:54,970 --> 02:52:56,890
Guys, what did we do?

4097
02:52:59,340 --> 02:53:00,250
Oh, there he goes.

4098
02:53:02,590 --> 02:53:04,470
What was it?

4099
02:53:04,470 --> 02:53:05,230
What was it before?

4100
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:08,310
I don't

4101
02:53:11,790 --> 02:53:11,930
remember.

4102
02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:13,730
I don't remember.

4103
02:53:14,390 --> 02:53:16,790
View distance was low.

4104
02:53:20,190 --> 02:53:22,070
And then illumination down.

4105
02:53:22,390 --> 02:53:22,770
Okay.

4106
02:53:23,370 --> 02:53:23,890
Okay.

4107
02:53:24,090 --> 02:53:24,770
What's this?

4108
02:53:27,970 --> 02:53:28,490
Okay.

4109
02:53:30,870 --> 02:53:31,970
Okay, there we go.

4110
02:53:32,670 --> 02:53:33,530
There we go.

4111
02:53:33,570 --> 02:53:34,170
We fixed it.

4112
02:53:35,430 --> 02:53:42,350
Guys, I know, I know it doesn't look the best, guys, but like... Oh my god, look at my cloud!

4113
02:53:42,690 --> 02:53:45,330
Look at my cloud!

4114
02:53:46,310 --> 02:53:47,230
Look at my cloud!

4115
02:53:48,350 --> 02:53:50,130
Look at my pixelated cloud!

4116
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:52,190
Holy fuck!

4117
02:53:52,410 --> 02:53:53,230
Okay, let's go.

4118
02:53:55,350 --> 02:53:57,810
Okay, what the fuck happened to my cloud?

4119
02:53:58,370 --> 02:54:00,050
Wait, where did the cricket go?

4120
02:54:00,690 --> 02:54:01,930
Where did he go?

4121
02:54:02,010 --> 02:54:04,330
It's a PNG cloud.

4122
02:54:04,830 --> 02:54:07,270
What the fuck happened to the cloud?

4123
02:54:08,230 --> 02:54:10,410
What the fuck did the cricket...

4124
02:54:11,970 --> 02:54:15,030
The 8-bit nemesis.

4125
02:54:15,090 --> 02:54:18,670
I was too busy fixing the graphics that I don't know where he went.

4126
02:54:20,270 --> 02:54:22,970
What happened to the cloud?

4127
02:54:23,230 --> 02:54:25,890
I want to just fix the cloud in general.

4128
02:54:28,210 --> 02:54:29,010
Um...

4129
02:54:29,010 --> 02:54:29,730
Like...

4130
02:54:30,770 --> 02:54:33,010
What made it like this?

4131
02:54:33,290 --> 02:54:35,270
What made it like this?

4132
02:54:38,430 --> 02:54:42,490
He saw the cloud.

4133
02:54:42,930 --> 02:54:46,810
Okay, we'll keep... We'll stand on our PNG cloud.

4134
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:50,590
The fucking 144p cloud!

4135
02:54:51,050 --> 02:54:52,730
Holy shit!

4136
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:55,970
My 144p cloud.

4137
02:54:56,330 --> 02:54:58,770
It looks like a sensor.

4138
02:54:59,210 --> 02:55:01,370
Jesus Christ, okay.

4139
02:55:02,170 --> 02:55:04,790
Um, this place... Where did the cricket go?

4140
02:55:05,670 --> 02:55:06,590
Like...

4141
02:55:11,690 --> 02:55:15,790
Where did the cricket even go?

4142
02:55:18,430 --> 02:55:20,450
I gotta chase him?

4143
02:55:20,570 --> 02:55:22,230
Okay, I think he went this way.

4144
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:25,530
Oh my god.

4145
02:55:28,290 --> 02:55:28,950
Guys...

4146
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:31,750
Guess there's just too many foliage, guys.

4147
02:55:31,830 --> 02:55:33,110
There was a lot of trees.

4148
02:55:33,370 --> 02:55:34,250
It's like...

4149
02:55:35,310 --> 02:55:36,330
The cricket.

4150
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:38,870
Somebody right-click deleted the cricket.

4151
02:55:39,890 --> 02:55:41,390
Where is he?

4152
02:55:48,340 --> 02:55:50,780
Which path did he walk to?

4153
02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:53,940
You hear chirps?

4154
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:58,800
I don't hear jack shit.

4155
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:04,900
Everything is so blurry.

4156
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:07,940
Sorry, that's my low view distance right there.

4157
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:09,140
Wait, maybe I can fix...

4158
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:11,940
Sorry, this is like phase five of the graphics boss.

4159
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:13,000
This is...

4160
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:20,120
Phase five of the graphics boss.

4161
02:56:24,380 --> 02:56:26,300
He walked a different direction.

4162
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:29,440
Guys, I was so busy trying to fix my fucking graphics.

4163
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:33,660
Cricket lives in high gra...

4164
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:36,560
I was so busy trying to fix it.

4165
02:56:36,700 --> 02:56:38,680
Okay, is there another boss that's close?

4166
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:43,060
Guys, is there another boss that's close by?

4167
02:56:46,790 --> 02:56:48,570
I feel so lost here.

4168
02:56:49,190 --> 02:56:49,750
This?

4169
02:56:51,330 --> 02:56:52,910
Is that boss over there?

4170
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:56,310
I mean, it's an open area.

4171
02:57:02,250 --> 02:57:03,570
I assume so.

4172
02:57:03,730 --> 02:57:04,350
It is open.

4173
02:57:07,010 --> 02:57:09,150
Oh, I lost a little bit damage there.

4174
02:57:09,410 --> 02:57:10,310
I mean, the...

4175
02:57:10,310 --> 02:57:11,330
Oh, lang...

4176
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:11,930
Ball ball?

4177
02:57:12,150 --> 02:57:12,830
Oh, no!

4178
02:57:12,970 --> 02:57:13,390
Not yet!

4179
02:57:14,070 --> 02:57:14,670
No!

4180
02:57:15,470 --> 02:57:16,070
No!

4181
02:57:17,790 --> 02:57:18,450
It's him!

4182
02:57:20,430 --> 02:57:20,990
No!

4183
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:22,410
He's back!

4184
02:57:23,910 --> 02:57:24,510
No!

4185
02:57:25,390 --> 02:57:26,850
Not so far!

4186
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:30,110
No!

4187
02:57:31,010 --> 02:57:31,810
Not so far!

4188
02:57:31,830 --> 02:57:32,370
Oh, not there!

4189
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:32,670
final frog...

4190
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:33,910
Wait, are you helping me?

4191
02:57:35,370 --> 02:57:36,830
Wait, are you helping me?

4192
02:57:37,270 --> 02:57:38,010
Wait, what?

4193
02:57:38,330 --> 02:57:39,650
Why are they helping me?

4194
02:57:41,790 --> 02:57:42,550
That's right.

4195
02:57:43,510 --> 02:57:45,750
Yeah, I didn't expect them to fucking help me.

4196
02:57:45,810 --> 02:57:46,590
I mean, I'll take it.

4197
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:49,070
The last frog.

4198
02:57:49,230 --> 02:57:51,050
They hate frogs too.

4199
02:57:51,430 --> 02:57:53,190
Finally, we can relate!

4200
02:57:54,890 --> 02:57:57,890
We can finally relate to each other.

4201
02:57:57,890 --> 02:58:00,050
We all hate frogs here.

4202
02:58:02,770 --> 02:58:03,970
Oh shit.

4203
02:58:05,210 --> 02:58:05,810
Okay.

4204
02:58:05,910 --> 02:58:06,530
Oh my god.

4205
02:58:06,550 --> 02:58:07,050
He's a rock.

4206
02:58:07,530 --> 02:58:08,690
That's fucking right.

4207
02:58:08,750 --> 02:58:11,830
I'm gonna... we're gonna send more minions in now.

4208
02:58:13,790 --> 02:58:16,750
Oh shit, we're gonna send all of them over.

4209
02:58:18,850 --> 02:58:19,450
No!

4210
02:58:23,290 --> 02:58:23,890
Bang!

4211
02:58:23,890 --> 02:58:25,210
Just keep banging.

4212
02:58:25,710 --> 02:58:27,250
It'll eventually work.

4213
02:58:28,030 --> 02:58:29,250
Bro, what the fuck?

4214
02:58:31,350 --> 02:58:32,450
Oh shit.

4215
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:35,530
Okay,

4216
02:58:38,590 --> 02:58:39,750
I gotta heal.

4217
02:58:40,270 --> 02:58:43,250
I just hear a boom, boom, boom, boom.

4218
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:46,670
No, I just keep hitting the rock.

4219
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:51,110
It just keeps hitting it.

4220
02:58:54,390 --> 02:58:55,770
Jeez, the frog.

4221
02:58:57,890 --> 02:59:02,590
I'm just fucking... I... I just keep hitting the fucking...

4222
02:59:02,590 --> 02:59:03,330
Oh god.

4223
02:59:04,010 --> 02:59:04,650
Yay!

4224
02:59:04,950 --> 02:59:06,090
I did it!

4225
02:59:06,510 --> 02:59:07,750
All me!

4226
02:59:09,310 --> 02:59:10,590
All me.

4227
02:59:11,010 --> 02:59:11,830
Thanks, man.

4228
02:59:12,010 --> 02:59:14,170
I'm glad we both hate frogs too.

4229
02:59:14,750 --> 02:59:17,230
I'm glad we're both prejudiced against frogs.

4230
02:59:19,850 --> 02:59:20,490
Nice.

4231
02:59:20,570 --> 02:59:21,770
And I stole his kids.

4232
02:59:23,910 --> 02:59:24,850
First try.

4233
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:25,450
All me.

4234
02:59:27,890 --> 02:59:28,270
Nice.

4235
02:59:28,330 --> 02:59:30,230
At last, we have something in common.

4236
02:59:31,070 --> 02:59:34,810
Like, you know, killing the monkeys, the other monkeys, was not cool, bro.

4237
02:59:34,970 --> 02:59:35,690
But frogs?

4238
02:59:35,930 --> 02:59:36,410
That's fine.

4239
02:59:37,330 --> 02:59:40,690
Frogs is like, free... free real estate.

4240
02:59:42,190 --> 02:59:43,750
Is there any, like...

4241
02:59:43,750 --> 02:59:45,990
He's got all his children now.

4242
02:59:48,270 --> 02:59:49,910
Nobody can have babies.

4243
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:54,830
Now where do I find the other bosses?

4244
02:59:56,030 --> 02:59:57,470
Oh, that has to be a boss.

4245
02:59:57,590 --> 02:59:58,630
It's a giant hippo.

4246
03:00:01,110 --> 03:00:03,070
Okay, I need to find a shrine, though.

4247
03:00:04,410 --> 03:00:06,670
On my PNG pixelated cloud.

4248
03:00:07,010 --> 03:00:07,670
On my...

4249
03:00:08,210 --> 03:00:09,150
I can't.

4250
03:00:09,490 --> 03:00:11,330
I... I can't.

4251
03:00:11,370 --> 03:00:13,530
This fucking PNG cloud.

4252
03:00:22,770 --> 03:00:23,690
Where's the thunder?

4253
03:00:23,830 --> 03:00:25,570
Okay, there has to be a shrine here, right?

4254
03:00:27,490 --> 03:00:28,890
My sensing cloud.

4255
03:00:29,010 --> 03:00:30,130
It's just so good.

4256
03:00:31,090 --> 03:00:31,910
Where's the shrine?

4257
03:00:34,810 --> 03:00:36,430
This doesn't look like there's a shrine.

4258
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:37,930
It just looks like there's a lot.

4259
03:00:38,290 --> 03:00:40,190
It looks great if you squint.

4260
03:00:43,530 --> 03:00:44,910
Yeah, but is there a shrine here?

4261
03:00:45,390 --> 03:00:46,390
Oh, there is.

4262
03:00:46,650 --> 03:00:47,550
It's just...

4263
03:00:47,550 --> 03:00:48,610
Oh, there it is.

4264
03:00:48,710 --> 03:00:50,170
It was, like, right next to me.

4265
03:00:52,390 --> 03:00:53,030
All right.

4266
03:00:53,310 --> 03:00:55,730
Let's go to the crocodile or hippo.

4267
03:00:58,050 --> 03:00:58,830
Okay, rest.

4268
03:01:01,770 --> 03:01:02,470
All right.

4269
03:01:02,510 --> 03:01:03,670
We go to the...

4270
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:06,350
We go to the hippo.

4271
03:01:06,350 --> 03:01:07,370
I assume the hippo.

4272
03:01:09,190 --> 03:01:10,110
Walk forward?

4273
03:01:10,210 --> 03:01:11,990
But there's a boss behind me.

4274
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:16,740
Where is he?

4275
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:21,160
Yeah, but I want to kill the hippo first.

4276
03:01:21,300 --> 03:01:22,460
Oh, the hippo is just a mob?

4277
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:25,320
I can't believe it.

4278
03:01:25,380 --> 03:01:27,280
Not even a real fucking boss.

4279
03:01:34,010 --> 03:01:35,930
Oh, he looks so handsome.

4280
03:01:36,850 --> 03:01:37,750
Oh, never mind.

4281
03:01:37,850 --> 03:01:38,970
He opened his eyes.

4282
03:01:39,010 --> 03:01:40,390
Now he looks a little silly.

4283
03:01:47,310 --> 03:01:48,350
A hippo grip.

4284
03:01:48,470 --> 03:01:50,270
No, it's like a moose gripping.

4285
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:52,570
Oh, it's a deer.

4286
03:01:53,390 --> 03:01:54,710
Wait, it's... No, no!

4287
03:01:54,850 --> 03:01:55,610
My friends!

4288
03:01:57,250 --> 03:01:58,170
That's fucking right.

4289
03:01:58,190 --> 03:01:58,930
Get over here.

4290
03:01:59,130 --> 03:02:00,790
Get your ass over here.

4291
03:02:01,950 --> 03:02:03,130
That's fucking right.

4292
03:02:03,830 --> 03:02:04,450
That's right.

4293
03:02:04,470 --> 03:02:05,410
Now I'm poking your ass.

4294
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:07,890
That's right.

4295
03:02:08,930 --> 03:02:09,410
Poke.

4296
03:02:09,470 --> 03:02:10,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

4297
03:02:10,670 --> 03:02:11,790
I did not mean to poke you.

4298
03:02:12,870 --> 03:02:13,830
Oh, JK.

4299
03:02:15,610 --> 03:02:16,430
Monkey time.

4300
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:19,150
Monkey smash.

4301
03:02:20,530 --> 03:02:21,470
Monkey smash.

4302
03:02:22,450 --> 03:02:23,890
Monkey smash.

4303
03:02:25,210 --> 03:02:27,410
Get over here so I can keep smashing.

4304
03:02:28,630 --> 03:02:30,650
Monkey will always smash.

4305
03:02:33,530 --> 03:02:36,030
Oh, you're going to start tornadoes?

4306
03:02:36,090 --> 03:02:38,010
That doesn't matter to me.

4307
03:02:39,550 --> 03:02:41,790
Because I'll still punch you.

4308
03:02:41,990 --> 03:02:43,810
I'll punch you in the ass.

4309
03:02:44,790 --> 03:02:46,270
That's fucking right.

4310
03:02:47,130 --> 03:02:48,770
You think I care?

4311
03:02:49,150 --> 03:02:49,790
Whoa.

4312
03:02:50,910 --> 03:02:51,630
It's fine.

4313
03:02:54,270 --> 03:02:55,210
Oh, shit.

4314
03:02:55,290 --> 03:02:57,710
Guys, I forgot to change my relic thing.

4315
03:02:57,950 --> 03:03:00,330
I just realized I forgot to change it.

4316
03:03:00,410 --> 03:03:00,890
Whoa!

4317
03:03:01,710 --> 03:03:02,230
Okay.

4318
03:03:03,470 --> 03:03:03,990
What?

4319
03:03:04,950 --> 03:03:06,070
What did he do?

4320
03:03:07,850 --> 03:03:08,470
That's right.

4321
03:03:08,610 --> 03:03:09,590
I'm going to do this now.

4322
03:03:10,270 --> 03:03:13,350
Now my monkeys are going to fight you instead.

4323
03:03:16,210 --> 03:03:17,370
That's fucking right.

4324
03:03:17,370 --> 03:03:18,650
Oh, no.

4325
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:19,430
Oh, no.

4326
03:03:19,470 --> 03:03:19,770
That's fine.

4327
03:03:20,930 --> 03:03:22,070
Oh, that's so good.

4328
03:03:22,510 --> 03:03:23,570
Good job, monkeys.

4329
03:03:25,110 --> 03:03:26,250
Monkeys strong together.

4330
03:03:29,510 --> 03:03:31,130
Monkeys are so strong together.

4331
03:03:32,570 --> 03:03:34,290
Monkeys, I need you to hit him.

4332
03:03:35,770 --> 03:03:36,490
Wait, what?

4333
03:03:37,150 --> 03:03:37,930
Wait, what?

4334
03:03:37,990 --> 03:03:39,130
There's a phase two?

4335
03:03:40,790 --> 03:03:41,270
What?

4336
03:03:42,410 --> 03:03:44,070
There's a phase two?

4337
03:03:44,070 --> 03:03:45,730
What does that...

4338
03:03:48,590 --> 03:03:52,050
What do you mean there's a phase two?

4339
03:03:54,450 --> 03:03:55,070
That's...

4340
03:03:55,070 --> 03:03:56,650
Wait, is that you, Buckeye?

4341
03:03:56,890 --> 03:03:58,390
Wait, where did you come from?

4342
03:04:01,970 --> 03:04:04,930
Oh, now he's going to help me.

4343
03:04:05,050 --> 03:04:08,510
Like, I'm just like, where was he before?

4344
03:04:09,190 --> 03:04:09,810
Like...

4345
03:04:12,190 --> 03:04:13,450
I mean, all right.

4346
03:04:13,450 --> 03:04:14,710
I'm not going to complain.

4347
03:04:16,870 --> 03:04:18,730
I'm just like, where was he before?

4348
03:04:19,090 --> 03:04:20,670
When did he show up?

4349
03:04:20,970 --> 03:04:22,770
Oh, now he wants to fucking help.

4350
03:04:23,250 --> 03:04:27,310
Like, after I've been, like, crying at him to help me this entire time.

4351
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:31,550
Okay, I need to heal here.

4352
03:04:31,710 --> 03:04:33,050
Because I'm poisoned anyway.

4353
03:04:35,770 --> 03:04:36,470
That's fine.

4354
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:38,430
That's fine.

4355
03:04:38,490 --> 03:04:39,050
I shouldn't complain.

4356
03:04:39,290 --> 03:04:40,810
He's, like, at least here now.

4357
03:04:41,190 --> 03:04:42,910
He's at least here.

4358
03:04:43,870 --> 03:04:44,430
He's...

4359
03:04:44,430 --> 03:04:46,190
Don't complain, Doki.

4360
03:04:46,450 --> 03:04:48,390
He could have never came back.

4361
03:04:49,750 --> 03:04:52,090
At least he finally came back.

4362
03:04:53,050 --> 03:04:54,870
Oh, is there another phase?

4363
03:04:55,030 --> 03:04:56,150
Oh, thank god!

4364
03:04:56,770 --> 03:04:58,910
Oh, you want the help or not?

4365
03:05:00,570 --> 03:05:02,390
Where the fuck was he with the frog?

4366
03:05:07,390 --> 03:05:09,330
Seppo, wait this time!

4367
03:05:09,370 --> 03:05:10,410
The glory's...

4368
03:05:10,410 --> 03:05:12,870
You were not even there for phase one!

4369
03:05:14,830 --> 03:05:17,190
Why did it rip its skin?

4370
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:19,850
Giga, thank you for the super chat.

4371
03:05:19,950 --> 03:05:20,750
Thank you, thank you.

4372
03:05:24,430 --> 03:05:27,450
The frog was not important enough.

4373
03:05:27,450 --> 03:05:29,470
He got the last hit, Doki.

4374
03:05:29,570 --> 03:05:29,930
It's his.

4375
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:34,770
Fucking kill stealer.

4376
03:05:38,420 --> 03:05:39,300
Oh, shit.

4377
03:05:39,420 --> 03:05:41,260
My feet is glowing now.

4378
03:05:44,820 --> 03:05:45,400
They're so red!

4379
03:05:52,350 --> 03:05:53,770
Oh my god.

4380
03:05:55,030 --> 03:05:56,510
Oh, look at his hands.

4381
03:05:57,270 --> 03:05:57,870
What's with the tears?

4382
03:05:59,450 --> 03:06:00,710
He smoothed out the blood and the blood.

4383
03:06:01,250 --> 03:06:01,890
I don't need them anymore.

4384
03:06:01,890 --> 03:06:01,930
I know.

4385
03:06:01,930 --> 03:06:02,310
He's in the middle of the room.

4386
03:06:02,690 --> 03:06:03,290
He's...

4387
03:06:03,290 --> 03:06:03,450
I thought there was more to this.

4388
03:06:03,990 --> 03:06:04,890
He's dead.

4389
03:06:06,330 --> 03:06:08,570
Oh, shit!

4390
03:06:08,770 --> 03:06:08,830
Oh, shit!

4391
03:06:08,870 --> 03:06:09,470
Nice!

4392
03:06:12,390 --> 03:06:14,430
Oh, I get new armor every boss!

4393
03:06:14,750 --> 03:06:15,670
Oh, that's sick!

4394
03:06:15,710 --> 03:06:16,170
Oh, shit!

4395
03:06:17,030 --> 03:06:20,570
Okay, that's good because the shoes are better than what I had before, I'm pretty sure.

4396
03:06:20,850 --> 03:06:24,710
The lotus silk cloud treaters.

4397
03:06:24,870 --> 03:06:25,570
Splendid, splendid.

4398
03:06:25,870 --> 03:06:27,850
Okay, so there's four main bosses then.

4399
03:06:28,170 --> 03:06:29,630
So I can get four outfits.

4400
03:06:32,450 --> 03:06:35,990
That's nice that I don't have to walk too far because I have my cloud.

4401
03:06:36,770 --> 03:06:38,570
Oh yeah, what about the frog armor?

4402
03:06:38,810 --> 03:06:40,510
Was the frog not imported enough?

4403
03:06:41,710 --> 03:06:46,330
I put on this fucking fire relic and it never mattered.

4404
03:06:46,550 --> 03:06:48,730
Time to collect the monkey drip.

4405
03:06:48,850 --> 03:06:50,390
Thank you for the super chat, Marvin.

4406
03:06:50,550 --> 03:06:50,910
Thank you.

4407
03:06:52,190 --> 03:06:54,030
Okay, I'm going to rest up.

4408
03:06:55,090 --> 03:06:56,530
I can't believe it.

4409
03:06:56,830 --> 03:07:01,250
Frogs deserve rights to be... Frogs deserve being main bosses, guys.

4410
03:07:04,350 --> 03:07:06,670
Where's the frog union to demand that?

4411
03:07:11,370 --> 03:07:12,970
Where's the frog union?

4412
03:07:15,710 --> 03:07:17,170
Oh my god, 72?

4413
03:07:17,690 --> 03:07:18,970
That's actually pretty good.

4414
03:07:20,310 --> 03:07:22,010
What curios did I got?

4415
03:07:22,250 --> 03:07:23,330
Wait, what was the curios?

4416
03:07:25,530 --> 03:07:26,450
What curios?

4417
03:07:26,650 --> 03:07:27,210
Oh wait, what is this?

4418
03:07:27,370 --> 03:07:29,990
Ignores the enemies for being resistance?

4419
03:07:32,260 --> 03:07:35,630
I killed the entire frog union.

4420
03:07:38,030 --> 03:07:39,110
You know that?

4421
03:07:39,110 --> 03:07:40,790
I still have their kids.

4422
03:07:41,810 --> 03:07:43,050
That's not true.

4423
03:07:43,890 --> 03:07:45,290
I have their children.

4424
03:07:50,790 --> 03:07:51,690
It's not true.

4425
03:07:51,990 --> 03:07:56,490
If their kids are in my hand, we can always restart the frog union.

4426
03:07:56,710 --> 03:07:58,970
We can always bring it back.

4427
03:08:02,810 --> 03:08:06,830
I'm going to put visual effect quality and see if that's the thing.

4428
03:08:08,350 --> 03:08:09,110
Oh, okay.

4429
03:08:09,190 --> 03:08:11,230
At least we can have visual effect back.

4430
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:16,200
Okay.

4431
03:08:18,580 --> 03:08:20,060
Where do we go?

4432
03:08:23,590 --> 03:08:25,630
Are you going to raise the frogs?

4433
03:08:26,110 --> 03:08:27,890
No, but like...

4434
03:08:29,310 --> 03:08:30,550
Like, I don't know.

4435
03:08:30,850 --> 03:08:31,570
Okay, no.

4436
03:08:31,630 --> 03:08:32,850
Actually, maybe...

4437
03:08:36,650 --> 03:08:39,310
I don't know why I keep playing God.

4438
03:08:40,430 --> 03:08:42,970
I know what placement this is.

4439
03:08:49,310 --> 03:08:50,690
Wait, there's no God.

4440
03:08:50,790 --> 03:08:51,310
There's no one.

4441
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:53,010
There's nobody here.

4442
03:08:54,810 --> 03:08:56,150
The cricket disappeared.

4443
03:09:02,620 --> 03:09:04,120
Where the fuck are things?

4444
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:09,260
Yeah, but I want to fight the mini-bosses.

4445
03:09:11,380 --> 03:09:13,020
Wait, what's this guy over here?

4446
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:15,000
There's a guy over here sitting there.

4447
03:09:16,520 --> 03:09:17,620
Is he a boss?

4448
03:09:17,960 --> 03:09:19,280
Or is he just chilling?

4449
03:09:20,480 --> 03:09:20,960
Hello?

4450
03:09:22,620 --> 03:09:23,520
There he is!

4451
03:09:23,660 --> 03:09:24,440
There he is!

4452
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:25,320
Oh, my God.

4453
03:09:25,340 --> 03:09:25,960
I swear to God.

4454
03:09:26,020 --> 03:09:27,460
I swear to fucking God.

4455
03:09:27,540 --> 03:09:29,380
I swear to fucking God.

4456
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:31,640
If you run away, I swear to God.

4457
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:32,420
I'm going to...

4458
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:34,420
I'm going to fucking...

4459
03:09:34,420 --> 03:09:35,780
Where do I hit?

4460
03:09:38,320 --> 03:09:38,800
Like...

4461
03:09:39,780 --> 03:09:40,260
What?

4462
03:09:43,020 --> 03:09:43,940
Where's your weak spot?

4463
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:46,900
I have to go on top of it?

4464
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:48,320
Please, please don't move.

4465
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:49,180
Please, no!

4466
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:50,700
Please, please, no!

4467
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:51,680
Please!

4468
03:09:55,830 --> 03:09:57,150
Oh, my God.

4469
03:09:57,270 --> 03:09:58,510
I didn't know!

4470
03:10:00,510 --> 03:10:02,350
I was so confused.

4471
03:10:03,450 --> 03:10:05,930
I was like, where is this weak point?

4472
03:10:06,670 --> 03:10:07,810
Okay, now I know.

4473
03:10:08,230 --> 03:10:09,350
Now I know.

4474
03:10:10,410 --> 03:10:10,890
Clutch.

4475
03:10:11,690 --> 03:10:12,510
Clutch your kick.

4476
03:10:15,330 --> 03:10:16,230
Oh, shit.

4477
03:10:16,290 --> 03:10:16,610
Whoa.

4478
03:10:16,870 --> 03:10:18,630
Maybe I should have had fire resistance.

4479
03:10:20,730 --> 03:10:21,630
Oh, okay.

4480
03:10:21,710 --> 03:10:22,150
I just hold.

4481
03:10:23,490 --> 03:10:24,090
What?

4482
03:10:27,090 --> 03:10:28,650
What the fuck happened?

4483
03:10:30,010 --> 03:10:31,950
I let go for one second.

4484
03:10:32,290 --> 03:10:38,230
I actually accidentally lit.

4485
03:10:42,400 --> 03:10:44,220
Are you serious?

4486
03:10:45,220 --> 03:10:47,240
Oh, my God.

4487
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:48,220
I...

4488
03:10:49,160 --> 03:10:51,420
For one second.

4489
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:54,360
That is so bullshit.

4490
03:10:54,660 --> 03:10:55,760
Oh, my God.

4491
03:10:55,840 --> 03:10:56,960
I just...

4492
03:10:59,000 --> 03:10:59,740
I...

4493
03:10:59,740 --> 03:11:01,400
I freaked out.

4494
03:11:02,220 --> 03:11:04,620
I freaked out.

4495
03:11:09,630 --> 03:11:10,320
Go there?

4496
03:11:10,480 --> 03:11:10,820
Where?

4497
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:12,280
Oh, my God.

4498
03:11:12,340 --> 03:11:13,260
Guys, you don't understand.

4499
03:11:13,380 --> 03:11:14,260
I'm so lost.

4500
03:11:14,640 --> 03:11:15,220
I...

4501
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:17,900
I'm so lost.

4502
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:20,080
You don't understand.

4503
03:11:20,300 --> 03:11:21,680
I'm so confused.

4504
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:27,140
Oh, there was a shrine next to me.

4505
03:11:27,240 --> 03:11:28,060
I heard the .

4506
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:30,900
Okay, let's see if we can first try.

4507
03:11:37,300 --> 03:11:38,220
Oh, there's dead...

4508
03:11:38,220 --> 03:11:39,980
Dead celestial court here.

4509
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:42,760
That means we can be best friends.

4510
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:44,320
We both hate the celestial court.

4511
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:44,660
You told me to be the best friend.

4512
03:11:44,700 --> 03:11:46,320
I hate the celestial court.

4513
03:11:58,560 --> 03:11:59,680
Oh shit!

4514
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:00,940
Wait, he's gold.

4515
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:04,440
I can use him for... I can use him for good armor.

4516
03:12:09,660 --> 03:12:11,400
Gold armor Rhino.

4517
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:15,280
Alright, time to poach this Rhino.

4518
03:12:15,780 --> 03:12:18,320
There's no way he's the last of his kind, right guys?

4519
03:12:19,740 --> 03:12:20,580
Wait, what?

4520
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:22,060
What?

4521
03:12:22,680 --> 03:12:24,620
Oh, what the fuck?

4522
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:28,060
What do I hit?

4523
03:12:30,700 --> 03:12:31,700
What the fuck?

4524
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:33,300
Oh, his stomach.

4525
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:34,120
Okay, that's five.

4526
03:12:34,940 --> 03:12:37,900
Oh my god, I have to like not be like in his head.

4527
03:12:38,320 --> 03:12:41,040
We gotta smack his butt like last time, guys.

4528
03:12:41,380 --> 03:12:43,120
We just gotta smack his butt.

4529
03:12:44,880 --> 03:12:45,600
Butt smack!

4530
03:12:46,480 --> 03:12:47,000
Okay.

4531
03:12:48,120 --> 03:12:49,100
Alright, there you go.

4532
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:53,500
Get over here!

4533
03:12:53,620 --> 03:12:55,460
Get your ass over here!

4534
03:12:55,620 --> 03:12:56,840
How am I supposed to smack you?

4535
03:12:57,120 --> 03:12:57,120
Oh!

4536
03:13:00,880 --> 03:13:01,980
That's fucking right.

4537
03:13:02,480 --> 03:13:02,960
Smack!

4538
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:06,520
You're frozen!

4539
03:13:08,160 --> 03:13:09,280
Okay, nice.

4540
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:09,900
Okay, smack.

4541
03:13:11,420 --> 03:13:12,300
Alright, that's good.

4542
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:13,680
That's good.

4543
03:13:13,780 --> 03:13:18,140
I'm gonna heal and I'm gonna let my bros smack them for me.

4544
03:13:18,460 --> 03:13:19,860
Alright, bros, it's your turn.

4545
03:13:20,940 --> 03:13:22,420
It's your turn bros.

4546
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:25,500
Don't worry, I'm gonna charge it up.

4547
03:13:30,400 --> 03:13:31,900
Oh, he's getting closer guys.

4548
03:13:32,420 --> 03:13:34,000
He's getting us so close.

4549
03:13:40,340 --> 03:13:47,800
This is a joke by the way, I love animals, but also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make his fucking horn into gear like

4550
03:13:54,700 --> 03:14:00,080
Guys poaching is wrong guys Don't joke about the frogs though.

That's illegal.

That's actually legal!

4562
03:14:44,650 --> 03:15:03,530
Oh shit, okay Guys I have more important things to do right now As much as we would love for me to try the cricket again, I literally have to fucking beat up a giant rhino Are you fucking?

4563
03:15:03,630 --> 03:15:27,610

Nice, alright.

03:15:38,310 --> 03:15:40,530
Just imagine if it hits.

4567
03:15:44,630 --> 03:15:45,150
Nice.

4568
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:48,630
Gryffindor, Doki.

4569
03:15:49,170 --> 03:15:50,830
Joshua, thank you for the super chat.

4570
03:15:50,910 --> 03:15:51,930
Thank you, thank you.

4571
03:15:52,610 --> 03:15:53,930
Firmly grasp it.

4572
03:15:54,390 --> 03:15:55,870
Ooh, what did I get?

4573
03:15:58,910 --> 03:16:00,910
Oh, it's like my original outfit!

4574
03:16:05,260 --> 03:16:06,360
Poaching successful.

4575
03:16:18,030 --> 03:16:21,150
Guys, it's not poaching when it originally belonged to me.

4576
03:16:21,510 --> 03:16:25,190
If anything, the Rhino stole it by existing.

4577
03:16:35,290 --> 03:16:37,390
The Rhino stole it by existing.

4578
03:16:37,570 --> 03:16:41,090
Technically, it's mine.

4579
03:16:41,250 --> 03:16:41,590
Exactly.

4580
03:16:41,790 --> 03:16:44,150
Technically, it belongs to me.

4581
03:16:44,350 --> 03:16:47,770
It's not my fault that he had to exist.

4582
03:16:48,470 --> 03:16:51,570
How dare the Rhino exist.

4583
03:16:54,490 --> 03:16:55,950
I know, right?

4584
03:16:56,090 --> 03:16:58,630
Fucking stealing my armor and everything.

4585
03:17:03,300 --> 03:17:04,360
Where's the cricket?

4586
03:17:04,360 --> 03:17:05,720
Oh, he's gone?

4587
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:06,820
Oh, okay.

4588
03:17:08,720 --> 03:17:09,560
He's gone.

4589
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:13,080
See?

4590
03:17:14,960 --> 03:17:18,840
Yeah, we may not realize that even his... we cannot feel pain when injured.

4591
03:17:21,360 --> 03:17:25,040
A heart of gold, lungs of silver, a head of copper, an iron body.

4592
03:17:25,260 --> 03:17:26,520
Yeah, I acquired it!

4593
03:17:30,880 --> 03:17:31,400
Exactly.

4594
03:17:33,060 --> 03:17:34,940
It was mine in the first place.

4595
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:37,480
Oh, yeah.

4596
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:39,580
I forgot to get to the shrine.

4597
03:17:39,760 --> 03:17:40,960
Where the fuck is the shrine?

4598
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,720
Oh, there it is.

4599
03:17:46,420 --> 03:17:50,720
I don't know if this one is better or my... the bull upgrade is better.

4600
03:17:54,700 --> 03:17:56,260
Thank you for the super chat.

4601
03:17:56,360 --> 03:17:56,680
Thank you.

4602
03:17:56,720 --> 03:17:57,360
Thank you.

4603
03:17:57,640 --> 03:17:59,120
Killing animals and bugs.

4604
03:17:59,260 --> 03:18:01,480
Animal protection center might think it's abuse.

4605
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:03,200
Thank you for the super chat.

4606
03:18:03,340 --> 03:18:03,800
Thank you.

4607
03:18:03,820 --> 03:18:04,660
Thank you.

4608
03:18:04,660 --> 03:18:06,840
It was mine originally!

4609
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:10,640
It belonged to me!

4610
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:18,720
Yeah, but like, I look cooler.

4611
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:23,960
Yeah, Bull King's one is cooler, guys.

4612
03:18:25,420 --> 03:18:28,200
We don't need the... guys, we don't need the critical hit.

4613
03:18:28,340 --> 03:18:32,460
We don't... we don't need... we don't... guys, we don't need the critical hit.

4614
03:18:32,460 --> 03:18:33,520
We don't need it.

4615
03:18:33,520 --> 03:18:34,840
We don't need it.

4616
03:18:37,640 --> 03:18:41,240
Guys, we don't need it.

4617
03:18:42,340 --> 03:18:42,900
Guys.

4618
03:18:43,160 --> 03:18:46,800
Yeah, but it... but... but look how cool I am.

4619
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:48,360
Like... like this, though.

4620
03:18:49,220 --> 03:18:50,720
Look how cool this is.

4621
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:52,460
Look at this drip.

4622
03:18:54,980 --> 03:18:55,840
Oh, my God.

4623
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:56,380
There you are.

4624
03:18:56,460 --> 03:18:57,300
There you are.

4625
03:18:57,380 --> 03:18:58,320
There you are.

4626
03:18:58,400 --> 03:19:00,200
I knew you would come back.

4627
03:19:00,200 --> 03:19:04,080
I knew you would come back.

4628
03:19:04,280 --> 03:19:06,440
I fucking knew it.

4629
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:07,480
Okay.

4630
03:19:07,620 --> 03:19:08,700
I did this.

4631
03:19:09,160 --> 03:19:09,840
Okay.

4632
03:19:10,020 --> 03:19:11,000
There we go.

4633
03:19:18,820 --> 03:19:24,560
Also, I'm pretty sure... I'm pretty sure there's only one of them.

4634
03:19:24,820 --> 03:19:25,660
I know!

4635
03:19:27,720 --> 03:19:28,660
I'm holding.

4636
03:19:30,180 --> 03:19:31,460
I'm still holding.

4637
03:19:31,780 --> 03:19:32,960
I'm still holding.

4638
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:38,110
Let go.

4639
03:19:38,310 --> 03:19:40,830
I didn't... I... I didn't realize.

4640
03:19:41,070 --> 03:19:43,230
I... I didn't realize!

4641
03:19:43,730 --> 03:19:48,330
I didn't... I... I... I thought my stamina...

4642
03:19:48,330 --> 03:19:48,850
Guys!

4643
03:19:51,620 --> 03:19:52,960
My stamina's...

4644
03:19:57,110 --> 03:19:59,490
I thought... I thought I could let go.

4645
03:20:04,410 --> 03:20:04,930
Recharge.

4646
03:20:05,170 --> 03:20:07,230
I was like, oh, my stamina's going down.

4647
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:08,830
Maybe I should recharge it.

4648
03:20:08,950 --> 03:20:09,330
No!

4649
03:20:09,450 --> 03:20:10,850
My life saving...

4650
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:29,540
My life has been saved.

4651
03:20:29,800 --> 03:20:30,180
Yay!

4652
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:32,140
Oh, I still have it.

4653
03:20:32,200 --> 03:20:33,560
Oh, I still have it.

4654
03:20:33,560 --> 03:20:34,480
Thank fucking God.

4655
03:20:35,540 --> 03:20:36,960
There it goes.

4656
03:20:39,500 --> 03:20:42,860
I thought... I thought it was...

4657
03:20:42,860 --> 03:20:44,040
Oh, my God.

4658
03:20:44,100 --> 03:20:46,680
I thought... I thought it's like, you know...

4659
03:20:46,680 --> 03:20:48,920
You hold it, but like...

4660
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:49,560
But...

4661
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:52,620
But like, you wait for it to recharge.

4662
03:20:54,240 --> 03:20:55,080
It's okay.

4663
03:20:55,280 --> 03:20:55,680
It's okay.

4664
03:20:55,720 --> 03:20:57,100
Everything is okay, guys.

4665
03:21:00,300 --> 03:21:00,840
Alright.

4666
03:21:05,540 --> 03:21:06,080
Okay.

4667
03:21:07,760 --> 03:21:08,940
What is this guy?

4668
03:21:09,140 --> 03:21:10,760
I just want to know who he is.

4669
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,040
Is he a friendly guy?

4670
03:21:13,400 --> 03:21:13,940
Hello.

4671
03:21:15,560 --> 03:21:16,540
Is he friendly?

4672
03:21:17,400 --> 03:21:19,020
Is he just watching me?

4673
03:21:19,560 --> 03:21:19,980
Oh!

4674
03:21:23,420 --> 03:21:23,980
Okay.

4675
03:21:25,460 --> 03:21:26,360
He's a tree.

4676
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:27,900
He's a tree anyway.

4677
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:29,420
I hate trees.

4678
03:21:31,480 --> 03:21:32,240
That's right.

4679
03:21:32,480 --> 03:21:33,380
What you gonna do?

4680
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:35,060
That's right.

4681
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:35,980
This is your fault.

4682
03:21:36,480 --> 03:21:38,120
This is literally your fault.

4683
03:21:38,520 --> 03:21:41,000
He was just chilling.

4684
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:47,360
Doki, he's not even a mandatory boss.

4685
03:21:47,820 --> 03:21:48,720
He was just...

4686
03:21:48,720 --> 03:21:50,100
Yeah, but he witnessed everything.

4687
03:21:50,100 --> 03:21:51,380
He saw it.

4688
03:21:52,620 --> 03:21:53,180
Guys.

4689
03:21:54,080 --> 03:21:54,360
Guys.

4690
03:21:54,880 --> 03:21:56,820
He saw the cricket incident.

4691
03:21:57,400 --> 03:21:58,500
No witnesses.

4692
03:21:59,600 --> 03:22:00,720
No fucking...

4693
03:22:01,300 --> 03:22:03,740
Guys, we can't have any witnesses, guys.

4694
03:22:03,880 --> 03:22:05,160
He saw it all.

4695
03:22:05,680 --> 03:22:07,040
I know he did.

4696
03:22:08,980 --> 03:22:11,220
You can't fucking trick me.

4697
03:22:11,300 --> 03:22:12,140
I know you saw it.

4698
03:22:12,220 --> 03:22:13,900
I know you saw the whole thing.

4699
03:22:14,120 --> 03:22:15,660
I know he saw it.

4700
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:16,680
He literally saw it.

4701
03:22:23,150 --> 03:22:24,430
He was there.

4702
03:22:26,590 --> 03:22:28,510
I can't let them know.

4703
03:22:28,650 --> 03:22:30,470
No witnesses, chat.

4704
03:22:31,030 --> 03:22:32,750
No fucking witnesses.

4705
03:22:37,590 --> 03:22:38,590
We're awesome.

4706
03:22:38,670 --> 03:22:39,810
For now.

4707
03:22:41,310 --> 03:22:42,550
For now.

4708
03:22:47,290 --> 03:22:48,610
He was clapping.

4709
03:22:48,650 --> 03:22:48,890
He was clapping.

4710
03:22:48,890 --> 03:22:50,530
He made fun of me, chat.

4711
03:22:50,790 --> 03:22:52,930
He fucking made fun of me too.

4712
03:22:54,910 --> 03:22:57,050
He's just a little cat.

4713
03:22:57,650 --> 03:22:59,670
I saw him make fun of me.

4714
03:23:02,470 --> 03:23:03,070
Okay.

4715
03:23:03,530 --> 03:23:05,510
He was clapping.

4716
03:23:05,910 --> 03:23:11,510
I don't think he was clapping because he was thinking I was a fool.

4717
03:23:11,850 --> 03:23:13,190
Now who's a fool?

4718
03:23:13,890 --> 03:23:14,010
Fuck.

4719
03:23:14,770 --> 03:23:15,150
Fuck.

4720
03:23:15,790 --> 03:23:16,390
Fuck.

4721
03:23:17,650 --> 03:23:21,410
There's a shrine on the other side of the rock that he was next to.

4722
03:23:22,430 --> 03:23:23,450
Where is it?

4723
03:23:24,710 --> 03:23:27,610
He thought I was the fool, but look who's alive.

4724
03:23:31,900 --> 03:23:34,600
Behind the stone in some other area.

4725
03:23:34,900 --> 03:23:36,620
He was happy for you.

4726
03:23:37,040 --> 03:23:37,620
Lies.

4727
03:23:37,800 --> 03:23:39,900
He saw me fumble twice.

4728
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:41,400
Lies.

4729
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:48,280
He saw me fumble twice.

4730
03:23:49,400 --> 03:23:50,100
Lies.

4731
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:59,240
I guess there was a fucking shrine here.

4732
03:24:03,390 --> 03:24:04,770
I didn't succeed.

4733
03:24:04,910 --> 03:24:06,550
So why was he clapping?

4734
03:24:08,430 --> 03:24:09,850
Why did he clap?

4735
03:24:13,130 --> 03:24:13,830
Huh?

4736
03:24:14,770 --> 03:24:16,230
Why did he clap?

4737
03:24:20,820 --> 03:24:23,740
Oh, there's a shrine here because fun.

4738
03:24:24,060 --> 03:24:26,580
That's exactly why he's not alive.

4739
03:24:27,420 --> 03:24:29,920
There's nothing funny about it.

4740
03:24:34,360 --> 03:24:36,600
That's exactly why.

4741
03:24:40,150 --> 03:24:42,180
That's why baby is no more.

4742
03:24:49,860 --> 03:24:51,130
Alright, where the fuck?

4743
03:24:53,010 --> 03:24:54,030
Wait, what's this?

4744
03:24:57,250 --> 03:24:58,210
What is this?

4745
03:24:59,870 --> 03:25:01,190
Water curtain cave?

4746
03:25:05,830 --> 03:25:06,910
Should I go up here?

4747
03:25:09,330 --> 03:25:10,950
Oh, that's the go here last.

4748
03:25:11,210 --> 03:25:11,630
Oh, okay.

4749
03:25:13,170 --> 03:25:14,530
Alright, we go here last.

4750
03:25:15,210 --> 03:25:16,910
Yeah, I was gonna say this looks like my house.

4751
03:25:22,420 --> 03:25:24,160
Is the cricket back yet, guys?

4752
03:25:24,260 --> 03:25:25,380
Is he back now?

4753
03:25:26,060 --> 03:25:27,400
Guys, where the fuck is he?

4754
03:25:27,400 --> 03:25:27,840
Where is the cricket?

4755
03:25:32,200 --> 03:25:35,000
Guys, how is the cricket the hardest part of this game?

4756
03:25:35,560 --> 03:25:36,860
Like, am I stupid?

4757
03:25:37,200 --> 03:25:37,600
I am.

4758
03:25:37,700 --> 03:25:38,400
Don't answer that.

4759
03:25:38,480 --> 03:25:39,400
I already know the answer.

4760
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:40,700
I already...

4761
03:25:42,880 --> 03:25:44,320
Guys, I already know the answer.

4762
03:25:44,380 --> 03:25:45,460
You don't have to answer it.

4763
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:48,600
Wait,

4764
03:25:55,490 --> 03:25:55,990
I hear the cricket.

4765
03:25:56,470 --> 03:25:57,410
I hear him.

4766
03:26:01,620 --> 03:26:02,640
I hear him.

4767
03:26:06,100 --> 03:26:06,940
Where is he?

4768
03:26:09,440 --> 03:26:10,160
I heard...

4769
03:26:10,160 --> 03:26:11,020
There he is.

4770
03:26:11,180 --> 03:26:12,400
There is this fucker.

4771
03:26:12,500 --> 03:26:13,860
So, when do I let go?

4772
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:15,440
Do I just hold it in forever?

4773
03:26:16,020 --> 03:26:16,980
Wait, where is he gonna jump?

4774
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:19,680
Cause like, what about my stamina?

4775
03:26:26,230 --> 03:26:27,110
Just hold?

4776
03:26:33,110 --> 03:26:34,710
Okay, he has to jump.

4777
03:26:35,450 --> 03:26:36,630
I know you wanna jump.

4778
03:26:36,690 --> 03:26:38,410
Me and my fucking 144p...

4779
03:26:38,410 --> 03:26:39,510
44p cloud.

4780
03:26:41,310 --> 03:26:42,630
Where he jump to?

4781
03:26:43,270 --> 03:26:44,490
Okay, this is it.

4782
03:26:47,490 --> 03:26:48,510
This is it.

4783
03:26:50,200 --> 03:26:50,790
This is it.

4784
03:26:50,990 --> 03:26:52,830
Now that I know...

4785
03:26:53,550 --> 03:26:55,490
that I just have to hold.

4786
03:26:56,490 --> 03:26:58,410
Now that I know...

4787
03:27:01,140 --> 03:27:02,690
Now that I know...

4788
03:27:02,690 --> 03:27:05,550
nothing can stop me now.

4789
03:27:05,550 --> 03:27:05,910
Wow!

4790
03:27:07,750 --> 03:27:09,190
That's fucking right!

4791
03:27:14,870 --> 03:27:15,650
I'm holding.

4792
03:27:16,190 --> 03:27:17,050
I'm holding.

4793
03:27:17,970 --> 03:27:18,790
This is it.

4794
03:27:19,450 --> 03:27:20,330
This is it.

4795
03:27:20,470 --> 03:27:21,850
I should have enough stamina.

4796
03:27:23,850 --> 03:27:24,870
Oh my god.

4797
03:27:24,930 --> 03:27:26,590
Thank fucking god it's over.

4798
03:27:27,470 --> 03:27:29,310
Oh thank god it's over.

4799
03:27:29,590 --> 03:27:30,510
Is it over?

4800
03:27:34,810 --> 03:27:35,910
Is it over?

4801
03:27:36,390 --> 03:27:37,690
Do I keep holding?

4802
03:27:42,250 --> 03:27:42,870
What?

4803
03:27:47,640 --> 03:27:48,480
I'm dead.

4804
03:27:49,900 --> 03:27:51,080
I'm gonna die.

4805
03:27:55,360 --> 03:27:56,380
Wait, I'm alive.

4806
03:27:59,800 --> 03:28:01,080
Oh my god!

4807
03:28:01,180 --> 03:28:03,860
I was like, do I just burn to death?

4808
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:10,520
Wait.

4809
03:28:10,520 --> 03:28:12,020
Wait, what the fuck?

4810
03:28:17,110 --> 03:28:17,770
That's it!

4811
03:28:24,280 --> 03:28:27,840
That's the fucking...

4812
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:31,600
Oh my god.

4813
03:28:33,400 --> 03:28:34,880
That was it.

4814
03:28:34,980 --> 03:28:38,360
That was literally all I had to do.

4815
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:39,740
Oh my god.

4816
03:28:40,900 --> 03:28:43,420
Oh my god.

4817
03:28:43,420 --> 03:28:45,040
That was the hardest boss in the game.

4818
03:28:48,480 --> 03:28:50,160
Oh my god.

4819
03:28:50,500 --> 03:28:52,840
That's literally the hardest boss.

4820
03:28:53,980 --> 03:28:55,180
Holy shit.

4821
03:28:57,560 --> 03:28:59,200
Guys, no you can't say that already.

4822
03:28:59,280 --> 03:29:00,300
I fucked it up twice.

4823
03:29:00,360 --> 03:29:02,120
It was the hardest boss in this game.

4824
03:29:02,540 --> 03:29:03,340
Oh my god.

4825
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:05,580
Oh my god.

4826
03:29:06,320 --> 03:29:06,640
Oh my god.

4827
03:29:08,480 --> 03:29:12,620
That was the hardest boss in the entire game, guys.

4828
03:29:12,780 --> 03:29:13,400
That was the hardest boss in the entire game, guys.

4829
03:29:15,300 --> 03:29:15,780
Alright.

4830
03:29:15,960 --> 03:29:17,740
The Fintail General.

4831
03:29:18,720 --> 03:29:20,360
Gosh, thank you for the super chat.

4832
03:29:20,480 --> 03:29:21,420
Thank you, thank you.

4833
03:29:21,540 --> 03:29:24,320
Guys, I'm gonna... Thank you for the very first super chat.

4834
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:27,300
Okay, let's... alright.

4835
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:29,620
No, I wanna look badass.

4836
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:33,840
I don't need my armor.

4837
03:29:34,100 --> 03:29:36,240
Guys, it's not about the past.

4838
03:29:36,300 --> 03:29:37,720
It's about the future.

4839
03:29:38,100 --> 03:29:38,580
It's...

4840
03:29:40,560 --> 03:29:42,160
I'm here for the future.

4841
03:29:44,520 --> 03:29:45,860
Alright, here we go.

4842
03:29:48,840 --> 03:29:50,240
Go back to the swamp?

4843
03:29:50,440 --> 03:29:51,600
Where the fuck was the swamp?

4844
03:29:55,820 --> 03:29:57,100
Alright, let's see.

4845
03:29:58,460 --> 03:29:59,800
The Swamp Shrine?

4846
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:01,620
Oh, okay.

4847
03:30:05,060 --> 03:30:06,500
Where did the shrine go?

4848
03:30:10,920 --> 03:30:11,480
I...

4849
03:30:12,900 --> 03:30:14,020
This map...

4850
03:30:14,020 --> 03:30:15,660
This fucking...

4851
03:30:15,660 --> 03:30:17,980
Guys, I can't even find the shrine.

4852
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:18,680
Oh, there it is.

4853
03:30:18,800 --> 03:30:20,800
It blends in!

4854
03:30:21,620 --> 03:30:23,860
It literally...

4855
03:30:23,860 --> 03:30:26,120
Guys, you can't judge me.

4856
03:30:26,140 --> 03:30:27,820
It literally blends in.

4857
03:30:27,820 --> 03:30:29,580
It blends in so much.

4858
03:30:31,820 --> 03:30:33,880
Edsel, welcome to the tomato farm.

4859
03:30:34,160 --> 03:30:35,320
Welcome, welcome.

4860
03:30:35,960 --> 03:30:38,160
It blends in so much.

4861
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:39,100
You don't understand.

4862
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:42,980
Alright, where is the other boss?

4863
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:53,660
Where is Chupacar?

4864
03:30:55,020 --> 03:30:56,400
Oh, is that him?

4865
03:30:56,640 --> 03:30:57,860
Oh, there he is!

4866
03:30:58,040 --> 03:30:58,480
Woah!

4867
03:30:59,880 --> 03:31:01,880
I really gotta puff off my cloud.

4868
03:31:09,270 --> 03:31:10,970
What the fuck is that?

4869
03:31:23,930 --> 03:31:25,110
It's so tiny.

4870
03:31:28,630 --> 03:31:29,270
Woah!

4871
03:31:30,990 --> 03:31:31,630
Chupacar!

4872
03:31:31,630 --> 03:31:32,170
Chupacar!

4873
03:31:32,870 --> 03:31:33,510
Chupacar!

4874
03:31:34,170 --> 03:31:34,810
Chupacar!

4875
03:31:34,950 --> 03:31:35,590
Chupacar!

4876
03:31:35,590 --> 03:31:35,630
Chupacar...

4877
03:31:35,630 --> 03:31:36,770
Chupacar!

4878
03:31:36,770 --> 03:31:36,930
Chupacar!

4879
03:31:48,990 --> 03:31:54,570
Why the fuck was he trying to kill him?

4880
03:31:54,610 --> 03:31:56,110
He was just minding his own business.

4881
03:31:58,830 --> 03:32:00,230
Wait, am I going to kill him?

4882
03:32:00,790 --> 03:32:02,190
Are you serious?

4883
03:32:03,950 --> 03:32:05,950
I didn't even consent to this!

4884
03:32:06,590 --> 03:32:07,130
Why?

4885
03:32:08,970 --> 03:32:11,170
He turned me into a cicada!

4886
03:32:14,290 --> 03:32:15,710
Oh my god,

4887
03:32:20,880 --> 03:32:26,380
this guy is slashing!

4888
03:32:28,380 --> 03:32:29,820
Oh my god, I got bored.

4889
03:32:30,800 --> 03:32:35,040
Bro, this is your fucking fault.

4890
03:32:38,520 --> 03:32:40,920
He's just trying to chill.

4891
03:32:41,960 --> 03:32:43,160
This is your fault!

4892
03:32:44,200 --> 03:32:46,160
Oh, I forgot to change my relic again.

4893
03:32:46,520 --> 03:32:47,300
God damn it.

4894
03:32:47,400 --> 03:32:53,220
I keep forgetting to change my relic.

4895
03:32:56,600 --> 03:32:57,180
Okay.

4896
03:32:58,320 --> 03:32:58,900
Minions!

4897
03:32:59,040 --> 03:33:00,460
Go mini me!

4898
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:02,340
That's right!

4899
03:33:02,540 --> 03:33:03,440
Oh shit.

4900
03:33:03,760 --> 03:33:04,720
Wait, that was it?

4901
03:33:04,940 --> 03:33:05,580
Phase 2?

4902
03:33:10,540 --> 03:33:11,460
Wait, what is he?

4903
03:33:11,520 --> 03:33:13,260
He's sharpening his fucking hand?

4904
03:33:15,240 --> 03:33:16,580
Get bored, bozo.

4905
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:18,340
Thank you for the super chat, John.

4906
03:33:18,440 --> 03:33:18,720
Thank you.

4907
03:33:18,780 --> 03:33:19,240
Thank you.

4908
03:33:20,620 --> 03:33:23,980
Oh, he's using the stomach acid to make it acidic.

4909
03:33:26,820 --> 03:33:29,580
Now it's gonna like, poison me or burn me.

4910
03:33:32,760 --> 03:33:35,140
Wait, why don't I put my sword into the stomach acid?

4911
03:33:35,280 --> 03:33:36,100
It should be the same thing.

4912
03:33:36,220 --> 03:33:37,520
Where did my little monkeys go?

4913
03:33:37,660 --> 03:33:39,080
Where did my little monkeys go?

4914
03:33:39,240 --> 03:33:40,080
Where did...

4915
03:33:43,980 --> 03:33:45,840
What do you mean?

4916
03:33:46,140 --> 03:33:48,320
They just disappeared!

4917
03:33:49,980 --> 03:33:50,100
Like...

4918
03:33:50,100 --> 03:33:55,480
Wait, but he got cutscenes.

4919
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:56,040
No!

4920
03:33:56,240 --> 03:33:59,620
It's one of those fucking live, like, live cutscenes.

4921
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:00,860
That's so fucked.

4922
03:34:01,340 --> 03:34:02,820
That's so fucked.

4923
03:34:02,840 --> 03:34:05,180
I got live cutscenes, guys.

4924
03:34:05,440 --> 03:34:07,500
I can't believe it.

4925
03:34:07,880 --> 03:34:10,060
I can't believe I got live cutscenes.

4926
03:34:10,060 --> 03:34:10,060
That's so fucked.

4927
03:34:10,060 --> 03:34:10,060
That's so fucked.

4928
03:34:10,060 --> 03:34:10,060
I got live cutscenes, guys.

4929
03:34:10,060 --> 03:34:10,940
I can't believe I got live cutscenes.

4930
03:34:15,300 --> 03:34:16,700
Oh my god.

4931
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:17,960
That's messed up.

4932
03:34:18,140 --> 03:34:19,740
That's so messed up.

4933
03:34:22,560 --> 03:34:24,700
This is fucked up, bro.

4934
03:34:25,160 --> 03:34:27,080
This is actually so fucked up.

4935
03:34:27,240 --> 03:34:27,580
No!

4936
03:34:28,240 --> 03:34:30,160
My first sentence!

4937
03:34:30,420 --> 03:34:31,960
I'm distracted here!

4938
03:34:33,840 --> 03:34:35,940
They're on a lunch break.

4939
03:34:38,280 --> 03:34:40,040
They're on a lunch break.

4940
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:40,740
I'm on a face-tail.

4941
03:34:41,760 --> 03:34:43,540
I died to a bug.

4942
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:44,400
No!

4943
03:34:44,600 --> 03:34:46,320
I'm gonna fucking go in your mouth again!

4944
03:34:46,400 --> 03:34:47,700
Just spawn me in your mouth!

4945
03:34:48,000 --> 03:34:49,480
Spawn me in your fucking mouth!

4946
03:34:49,720 --> 03:34:50,080
Just...

4947
03:34:50,080 --> 03:34:51,120
Oh, no.

4948
03:34:51,200 --> 03:34:52,480
I gotta get eaten again.

4949
03:34:53,320 --> 03:34:55,700
He's like, alright, get in my mouth.

4950
03:34:55,900 --> 03:34:56,440
Oh, no.

4951
03:34:56,980 --> 03:34:58,560
No, you fuck god.

4952
03:34:58,640 --> 03:34:58,960
No.

4953
03:35:05,520 --> 03:35:07,020
This is not fair.

4954
03:35:07,160 --> 03:35:10,280
I did... No, I forgot to change my fucking thing again!

4955
03:35:10,280 --> 03:35:13,340
I forgot to change my relic again.

4956
03:35:13,560 --> 03:35:14,920
God damn it.

4957
03:35:15,380 --> 03:35:16,420
Not again.

4958
03:35:17,620 --> 03:35:18,940
God damn it.

4959
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:21,760
And then he ran away.

4960
03:35:21,980 --> 03:35:23,560
This fucker, honestly.

4961
03:35:24,420 --> 03:35:29,520
I can't believe I got... I can't believe I got live cutscenes.

4962
03:35:29,980 --> 03:35:31,940
That's actually so bullshit.

4963
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:37,500
That's so bullshit.

4964
03:35:37,940 --> 03:35:39,760
That should not be a thing.

4965
03:35:49,230 --> 03:35:51,470
Okay, now I summon my monkeys.

4966
03:35:52,870 --> 03:35:55,070
I didn't know it was gonna be a phase two!

4967
03:35:55,570 --> 03:35:57,930
I thought I was gonna fucking rail his ass!

4968
03:35:59,710 --> 03:36:00,250
Raising.

4969
03:36:01,830 --> 03:36:02,650
Okay, now.

4970
03:36:03,110 --> 03:36:04,790
Go in, my minions.

4971
03:36:06,510 --> 03:36:07,290
Go in.

4972
03:36:08,890 --> 03:36:09,770
You know what?

4973
03:36:09,910 --> 03:36:10,990
I'm gonna go...

4974
03:36:10,990 --> 03:36:12,430
Big monkey tube.

4975
03:36:12,830 --> 03:36:13,550
That's right!

4976
03:36:13,830 --> 03:36:15,810
There's so many of us now!

4977
03:36:17,370 --> 03:36:18,950
That's fucking right!

4978
03:36:19,930 --> 03:36:21,750
What you gonna do now?

4979
03:36:22,730 --> 03:36:24,430
There's so many of us!

4980
03:36:25,630 --> 03:36:26,690
Wait, where are you?

4981
03:36:27,650 --> 03:36:30,110
There's so many of us, I'm losing track.

4982
03:36:32,850 --> 03:36:33,630
Oh, shit.

4983
03:36:35,710 --> 03:36:36,690
Oh, fuck, okay.

4984
03:36:37,090 --> 03:36:38,210
Gotta get out of here.

4985
03:36:39,530 --> 03:36:41,030
Oh, we gotta get out.

4986
03:36:41,150 --> 03:36:41,950
We gotta get out.

4987
03:36:42,790 --> 03:36:44,270
Whoa, he's so fast!

4988
03:36:45,430 --> 03:36:46,230
Oh, shit.

4989
03:36:46,750 --> 03:36:47,650
Oh, fuck.

4990
03:36:47,710 --> 03:36:48,630
Okay, he's so fast.

4991
03:36:49,430 --> 03:36:49,890
Whoa!

4992
03:36:50,250 --> 03:36:53,010
He has 700 movesets!

4993
03:36:55,150 --> 03:36:55,610
Nozai!

4994
03:36:55,870 --> 03:36:56,650
Thank you for...

4995
03:36:56,650 --> 03:36:57,830
Welcome to the tomato farm!

4996
03:36:57,950 --> 03:36:58,410
Welcome...

4997
03:36:58,410 --> 03:36:59,850
He has 200 million...

4998
03:36:59,850 --> 03:37:00,750
Okay, now I remember.

4999
03:37:01,150 --> 03:37:02,850
He has so much damage!

5000
03:37:04,050 --> 03:37:05,250
Oh, my God!

5001
03:37:06,890 --> 03:37:07,950
Okay, more time.

5002
03:37:08,010 --> 03:37:08,190
I'm like...

5003
03:37:08,190 --> 03:37:08,310
Oh, my God.

5004
03:37:08,590 --> 03:37:08,810
Yeah.

5005
03:37:09,670 --> 03:37:12,450
Now I remember to change the thing!

5006
03:37:13,710 --> 03:37:14,230
Okay.

5007
03:37:15,870 --> 03:37:17,970
Which one should I do?

5008
03:37:19,830 --> 03:37:20,350
Maybe...

5009
03:37:20,350 --> 03:37:21,190
Maybe this.

5010
03:37:21,430 --> 03:37:21,890
I don't know.

5011
03:37:21,950 --> 03:37:22,550
Which one's better?

5012
03:37:22,690 --> 03:37:24,870
The needle or the fan?

5013
03:37:28,760 --> 03:37:29,280
Fan?

5014
03:37:29,500 --> 03:37:30,520
Okay, we'll try the fan.

5015
03:37:31,140 --> 03:37:32,660
All right, tornado time.

5016
03:37:32,880 --> 03:37:33,860
Okay, vortex...

5017
03:37:33,860 --> 03:37:36,380
Guys, I'm not dying because I enjoyed this, guys.

5018
03:37:36,580 --> 03:37:39,840
I know every other boss, it was so easy.

5019
03:37:39,840 --> 03:37:41,440
Guys, this is not because...

5020
03:37:41,440 --> 03:37:43,060
I'm not purposely throwing, guys.

5021
03:37:43,280 --> 03:37:45,800
Like, he's just very strong.

5022
03:37:46,180 --> 03:37:48,380
I swear to God.

5023
03:37:50,260 --> 03:37:52,400
I'm not dying on purpose, please.

5024
03:37:52,700 --> 03:37:57,500
I swear to God, this is not on purpose, guys.

5025
03:37:59,600 --> 03:38:01,320
I swear to God.

5026
03:38:01,380 --> 03:38:02,740
This is not on purpose.

5027
03:38:02,940 --> 03:38:04,460
He's just really strong.

5028
03:38:05,220 --> 03:38:08,260
Guys, he's actually very difficult.

5029
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:09,200
What?

5030
03:38:09,200 --> 03:38:09,380
What?

5031
03:38:09,380 --> 03:38:09,820
He's like this.

5032
03:38:14,270 --> 03:38:15,510
Oh my god.

5033
03:38:15,690 --> 03:38:16,270
Okay.

5034
03:38:18,870 --> 03:38:19,870
Nice, okay.

5035
03:38:20,370 --> 03:38:21,290
Phase two.

5036
03:38:24,790 --> 03:38:26,310
Guys, please.

5037
03:38:27,370 --> 03:38:30,610
Please, I swear to god, this is not intentional.

5038
03:38:31,210 --> 03:38:33,950
I swear to god.

5039
03:38:36,210 --> 03:38:37,790
Can I get this off in time?

5040
03:38:40,270 --> 03:38:41,970
No guys, he's so fast.

5041
03:38:42,090 --> 03:38:42,410
I cannot.

5042
03:38:43,990 --> 03:38:44,730
Unless...

5043
03:38:46,220 --> 03:38:48,110
Oh, I don't even have it.

5044
03:38:48,110 --> 03:38:49,090
I forgot to rest!

5045
03:38:50,310 --> 03:38:54,890
Guys, not purposely throwing.

5046
03:38:55,030 --> 03:38:57,930
I just didn't know I forgot to rest.

5047
03:38:58,230 --> 03:39:04,390
I actually forgot to rest.

5048
03:39:09,370 --> 03:39:10,110
Smash.

5049
03:39:10,730 --> 03:39:11,470
Please.

5050
03:39:11,650 --> 03:39:13,650
I need you to keep smashing.

5051
03:39:15,350 --> 03:39:26,730
Oh my god, I still can't believe I forgot to rest after swapping!

5052
03:39:28,230 --> 03:39:28,730
No!

5053
03:39:34,050 --> 03:39:35,670
Whoa, whoa!

5054
03:39:36,350 --> 03:39:36,850
Whoa!

5055
03:39:38,030 --> 03:39:39,030
Whoa!

5056
03:39:39,030 --> 03:39:39,890
Whoa.

5057
03:39:39,890 --> 03:39:41,870
Whoa, that's not cool, bro.

5058
03:39:42,030 --> 03:39:44,490
That was not cool.

5059
03:39:44,690 --> 03:39:47,370
That was not cool at all.

5060
03:39:47,410 --> 03:39:48,350
That was not cool at all.

5061
03:39:48,350 --> 03:39:49,470
That is not cool at all.

5062
03:39:49,770 --> 03:39:51,010
Oh my god!

5063
03:39:54,690 --> 03:39:55,170
Okay.

5064
03:39:56,170 --> 03:39:57,490
There we go, we did it guys.

5065
03:39:57,730 --> 03:39:58,530
I told you guys.

5066
03:40:00,070 --> 03:40:01,730
We fucking did it.

5067
03:40:02,070 --> 03:40:03,130
We fucking did it.

5068
03:40:03,130 --> 03:40:04,950
Oh, that should be my chest piece.

5069
03:40:05,810 --> 03:40:07,770
Oh, that should be my chest piece.

5070
03:40:07,770 --> 03:40:08,850
See, I didn't need the tornado.

5071
03:40:09,390 --> 03:40:09,490
See, I didn't need the tornado.

5072
03:40:13,650 --> 03:40:15,430
Oh my god, is he gonna throw me up?

5073
03:40:15,430 --> 03:40:15,630
Ugh!

5074
03:40:17,030 --> 03:40:19,210
At least I didn't expand on him.

5075
03:40:19,970 --> 03:40:21,950
Oh nice, I got my shoulder pads.

5076
03:40:22,650 --> 03:40:23,890
Or my braces.

5077
03:40:25,930 --> 03:40:27,610
Or my braces.

5078
03:40:32,680 --> 03:40:34,680
Okay, I must not smell good.

5079
03:40:35,100 --> 03:40:35,360
Okay, I must not smell good.

5080
03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:36,120
Okay, I must not smell good.

5081
03:40:36,200 --> 03:40:38,480
Okay, I must not smell good.

5082
03:40:40,720 --> 03:40:42,520
Not me either?

5083
03:40:42,700 --> 03:40:44,240
That's a fucking lie.

5084
03:40:44,360 --> 03:40:45,960
I know you're not a vegetarian.

5085
03:40:47,380 --> 03:40:48,180
Or vegan.

5086
03:40:48,240 --> 03:40:48,740
Wait, is he?

5087
03:40:49,560 --> 03:40:52,540
No, but like, in the shows he ate meat.

5088
03:40:52,820 --> 03:40:52,820
No,

5089
03:40:56,320 --> 03:40:57,100
but like, in the shows he ate meat.

5090
03:40:57,100 --> 03:40:57,620
No, but like, in the shows he ate meat.

5091
03:40:57,620 --> 03:40:58,200
He is vegan?

5092
03:40:58,860 --> 03:41:00,320
Wait, but in the shows!

5093
03:41:01,080 --> 03:41:01,940
Wait, but in the shows!

5094
03:41:01,940 --> 03:41:02,060
Okay.

5095
03:41:05,060 --> 03:41:07,060
He is now?

5096
03:41:07,420 --> 03:41:08,480
Oh, he became one!

5097
03:41:08,580 --> 03:41:09,120
Oh, okay.

5098
03:41:09,320 --> 03:41:12,160
I didn't realize he became one.

5099
03:41:12,320 --> 03:41:13,240
I guess because he's a monk.

5100
03:41:13,400 --> 03:41:14,140
Yeah, you're right.

5101
03:41:14,140 --> 03:41:16,160
The show is a lie!

5102
03:41:18,420 --> 03:41:20,500
But the shows are wrong!

5103
03:41:23,160 --> 03:41:23,760
Alright.

5104
03:41:31,350 --> 03:41:32,550
Let's see...

5105
03:41:32,550 --> 03:41:35,750
No, this is okay because that's stronger than the red one.

5106
03:41:42,990 --> 03:41:44,490
Where do we go?

5107
03:41:44,590 --> 03:41:45,930
Is there another optional boss?

5108
03:41:50,740 --> 03:41:52,940
Wait, wait, I want to kill all the optional bosses!

5109
03:41:58,590 --> 03:41:59,470
Alright, let's...

5110
03:42:02,210 --> 03:42:03,690
I want to do all of them!

5111
03:42:03,750 --> 03:42:04,470
Where are the rest?

5112
03:42:05,230 --> 03:42:09,050
If I beat up that giant rock child, I'm going to beat up everybody else.

5113
03:42:14,930 --> 03:42:17,450
Okay, no, I'll change the armor during the final.

5114
03:42:17,670 --> 03:42:19,230
But like, now that I'm here.

5115
03:42:24,050 --> 03:42:25,190
I killed the frog.

5116
03:42:25,510 --> 03:42:25,570
I killed the frog.

5117
03:42:32,990 --> 03:42:33,850
There's three more.

5118
03:42:34,350 --> 03:42:35,930
I thought the hippo was...

5119
03:42:35,930 --> 03:42:37,630
I thought the hippo was just a mob.

5120
03:42:40,330 --> 03:42:41,730
There's an optional boss here.

5121
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:49,580
SHK, what?

5122
03:42:56,260 --> 03:42:57,080
Yeah, I have...

5123
03:42:57,080 --> 03:42:58,800
form, feeling, and choice.

5124
03:42:59,420 --> 03:43:00,440
Is that all of them?

5125
03:43:02,740 --> 03:43:03,600
I have three.

5126
03:43:03,800 --> 03:43:05,040
How do I get the other two?

5127
03:43:11,240 --> 03:43:12,980
Oh, there's a small whirlpool.

5128
03:43:16,980 --> 03:43:17,500
There's a whirlpool.

5129
03:43:17,500 --> 03:43:18,120
There's a whirlpool.

5130
03:43:19,280 --> 03:43:20,080
That's just...

5131
03:43:20,080 --> 03:43:20,900
Oh, there it is!

5132
03:43:21,040 --> 03:43:22,760
That has to be a boss right here.

5133
03:43:23,960 --> 03:43:25,160
That's right, I know you're alive.

5134
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:29,120
That's right, I know you're here.

5135
03:43:33,870 --> 03:43:34,350
Okay.

5136
03:43:34,570 --> 03:43:35,870
You're such a fucker.

5137
03:43:37,330 --> 03:43:39,470
You're actually such a fucker.

5138
03:43:43,830 --> 03:43:45,510
Oh, they'll not show...

5139
03:43:45,510 --> 03:43:46,590
She will know.

5140
03:43:47,830 --> 03:43:48,450
She won't know.

5141
03:43:48,750 --> 03:43:50,430
How will she know?

5142
03:43:50,710 --> 03:43:56,850
How is she gonna find out?

5143
03:43:58,110 --> 03:44:01,590
Actually, what a fucker.

5144
03:44:02,870 --> 03:44:05,190
Trying to bait me there.

5145
03:44:05,550 --> 03:44:07,430
Your ass deserves this.

5146
03:44:07,610 --> 03:44:10,250
Your ass fucking deserves this, bitch.

5147
03:44:14,410 --> 03:44:15,170
You.

5148
03:44:20,250 --> 03:44:20,930
You.

5149
03:44:21,410 --> 03:44:21,630
You.

5150
03:44:24,450 --> 03:44:27,270
My hand was like on the wrong...

5151
03:44:27,830 --> 03:44:28,230
move.

5152
03:44:28,630 --> 03:44:29,910
Oh my god.

5153
03:44:30,830 --> 03:44:32,190
Fuck this.

5154
03:44:33,070 --> 03:44:35,710
Yeah, this is overkill, but I don't care anymore.

5155
03:44:36,470 --> 03:44:38,030
I don't care.

5156
03:44:38,250 --> 03:44:40,770
I don't care if this is overkill.

5157
03:44:40,810 --> 03:44:41,850
Fuck you.

5158
03:44:42,930 --> 03:44:43,610
Actually...

5159
03:44:45,110 --> 03:44:47,370
I'm fucking gonna beat your ass.

5160
03:44:49,370 --> 03:44:50,690
That's like you, right?

5161
03:44:51,930 --> 03:44:53,250
Get over here.

5162
03:44:53,370 --> 03:44:55,370
Get your ass over here.

5163
03:44:55,470 --> 03:44:57,710
Get your ass over there.

5164
03:44:57,850 --> 03:44:58,510
You.

5165
03:44:59,390 --> 03:45:00,350
That's right.

5166
03:45:01,150 --> 03:45:02,150
Fuck you.

5167
03:45:04,110 --> 03:45:07,810
I pulled out everything when he was like 1 HP.

5168
03:45:08,230 --> 03:45:09,370
Alright, he's dead.

5169
03:45:10,950 --> 03:45:12,510
He's fucking dead.

5170
03:45:14,970 --> 03:45:18,390
He did not deserve to be alive after that.

5171
03:45:19,490 --> 03:45:20,750
He did not deserve to be alive after that.

5172
03:45:24,570 --> 03:45:25,550
And got the cloud.

5173
03:45:25,590 --> 03:45:27,270
Dropped it directly down into the...

5174
03:45:27,270 --> 03:45:27,630
Oh, okay.

5175
03:45:27,810 --> 03:45:28,430
I'll get that.

5176
03:45:29,290 --> 03:45:30,570
What if I just jump down?

5177
03:45:30,870 --> 03:45:32,110
I can't believe he won't let me jump.

5178
03:45:33,210 --> 03:45:34,170
Wait, where am I?

5179
03:45:34,690 --> 03:45:35,710
How did I get here?

5180
03:45:38,570 --> 03:45:39,750
Oh, there it is.

5181
03:45:39,830 --> 03:45:41,990
I was like, how the fuck did I get here?

5182
03:45:42,350 --> 03:45:43,530
Oh, there it is.

5183
03:45:46,240 --> 03:45:46,640
I was like, how the fuck did I get here?

5184
03:45:46,640 --> 03:45:48,060
Instant transmission.

5185
03:45:48,260 --> 03:45:49,540
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

5186
03:45:49,680 --> 03:45:50,580
And then I'm gonna...

5187
03:45:51,720 --> 03:45:54,480
I'm gonna find the other...

5188
03:45:54,480 --> 03:45:54,940
The lizard.

5189
03:47:07,980 --> 03:47:09,080
And I'm back.

5190
03:47:09,340 --> 03:47:10,040
Or am I?

5191
03:47:10,420 --> 03:47:10,940
Okay.

5192
03:47:12,140 --> 03:47:12,660
Bite!

5193
03:47:12,700 --> 03:47:13,100
Ginger!

5194
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:15,220
Nippers!

5195
03:47:15,220 --> 03:47:15,740
Cosmic!

5196
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:16,280
John!

5197
03:47:16,880 --> 03:47:17,800
Duck and Alan!

5198
03:47:17,880 --> 03:47:18,940
Thank you for the super chat!

5199
03:47:19,100 --> 03:47:19,320
Thank you!

5200
03:47:19,980 --> 03:47:21,840
Okay, it was like...

5201
03:47:22,460 --> 03:47:24,040
It was in the path here.

5202
03:47:24,340 --> 03:47:25,280
This should be it.

5203
03:47:27,800 --> 03:47:29,060
What additional bosses do we have left?

5204
03:47:30,060 --> 03:47:30,680
Guys.

5205
03:47:37,330 --> 03:47:39,110
What key items do I have?

5206
03:47:39,270 --> 03:47:40,090
I have...

5207
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:44,970
I have choice, healing, and form.

5208
03:47:46,730 --> 03:47:47,930
I have three.

5209
03:47:50,370 --> 03:47:50,990
Yeah.

5210
03:47:59,370 --> 03:48:02,030
One really big rock, dude.

5211
03:48:02,230 --> 03:48:03,650
Where did I get that?

5212
03:48:06,810 --> 03:48:07,850
It's this way.

5213
03:48:09,290 --> 03:48:10,670
Why the fuck did I get...

5214
03:48:10,670 --> 03:48:11,930
Chapter 3?

5215
03:48:12,030 --> 03:48:13,470
The last one is in Chapter 3?

5216
03:48:13,810 --> 03:48:15,110
How did I miss that?

5217
03:48:18,690 --> 03:48:19,950
Alright, we go this way.

5218
03:48:20,290 --> 03:48:21,170
It's like down here?

5219
03:48:25,210 --> 03:48:26,310
Is it down here?

5220
03:48:31,500 --> 03:48:34,980
Is it here?

5221
03:48:38,860 --> 03:48:39,420
No?

5222
03:48:43,320 --> 03:48:44,900
Where did that come from?

5223
03:48:45,660 --> 03:48:47,340
Oh, keep going forward.

5224
03:48:47,440 --> 03:48:47,740
Okay.

5225
03:48:53,890 --> 03:48:55,130
Oh my god, where am I?

5226
03:48:56,510 --> 03:48:57,670
I'm so lost.

5227
03:49:00,610 --> 03:49:01,490
Oh, up the cliff.

5228
03:49:01,530 --> 03:49:01,730
Okay.

5229
03:49:02,510 --> 03:49:03,470
Guys, I'm sorry.

5230
03:49:03,550 --> 03:49:04,850
I'm so fucking lost.

5231
03:49:11,870 --> 03:49:12,750
Holy shit.

5232
03:49:16,130 --> 03:49:17,010
Now down.

5233
03:49:17,370 --> 03:49:18,250
Oh, it must be here.

5234
03:49:21,880 --> 03:49:22,320
Here?

5235
03:49:26,600 --> 03:49:27,860
Where is it?

5236
03:49:35,730 --> 03:49:37,010
Where is it?

5237
03:49:37,050 --> 03:49:37,150
Where is he?

5238
03:49:37,150 --> 03:49:38,750
Where's this stupid lizard?

5239
03:49:40,570 --> 03:49:41,370
Lizard.

5240
03:49:42,210 --> 03:49:42,750
Oh!

5241
03:49:44,190 --> 03:49:44,990
Bro.

5242
03:49:45,350 --> 03:49:47,530
Oh my god.

5243
03:49:47,570 --> 03:49:49,190
Oh my god.

5244
03:49:49,450 --> 03:49:50,090
Fuck.

5245
03:49:50,410 --> 03:49:52,830
Why are they all like this?

5246
03:49:53,110 --> 03:49:57,880
Are you fucking kidding me?

5247
03:49:58,020 --> 03:50:00,720
Why are they all like this?

5248
03:50:04,160 --> 03:50:06,380
Oh my god!

5249
03:50:06,900 --> 03:50:07,820
Oh my god!

5250
03:50:07,820 --> 03:50:08,020
That's...

5251
03:50:08,020 --> 03:50:10,160
Holy shit!

5252
03:50:15,060 --> 03:50:16,140
Holy...

5253
03:50:16,140 --> 03:50:16,240
Holy...

5254
03:50:16,240 --> 03:50:16,580
Holy...

5255
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:17,560
What's hitting me?

5256
03:50:20,340 --> 03:50:23,560
Like actually, what's hitting me?

5257
03:50:24,240 --> 03:50:26,600
Holy shit!

5258
03:50:27,380 --> 03:50:27,500
Holy shit!

5259
03:50:27,500 --> 03:50:28,580
Holy shit!

5260
03:50:28,580 --> 03:50:30,180
Jesus Christ!

5261
03:50:30,820 --> 03:50:31,580
Jesus Christ!

5262
03:50:34,260 --> 03:50:35,420
I can't...

5263
03:50:36,480 --> 03:50:37,640
I can't...

5264
03:50:37,640 --> 03:50:37,720
I...

5265
03:50:37,720 --> 03:50:38,520
I don't know...

5266
03:50:38,520 --> 03:50:40,980
Okay, that looked cool though at least, you know?

5267
03:50:41,020 --> 03:50:42,220
At least that looked cool.

5268
03:50:42,760 --> 03:50:43,340
Like...

5269
03:50:43,340 --> 03:50:44,460
At least...

5270
03:50:47,000 --> 03:50:50,000
You know, at least that looked cool, you know?

5271
03:50:52,520 --> 03:50:54,780
Like, holy fuck!

5272
03:50:55,600 --> 03:50:56,920
Like, holy fuck!

5273
03:50:58,020 --> 03:50:59,860
What the fuck was I supposed to...

5274
03:50:59,860 --> 03:51:02,160
What the fuck was I supposed to...

5275
03:51:02,160 --> 03:51:03,760
You have two tails?

5276
03:51:04,040 --> 03:51:05,040
That's not possible!

5277
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:05,900
That's not possible!

5278
03:51:08,380 --> 03:51:09,540
Animation team!

5279
03:51:09,640 --> 03:51:10,380
What's going on?

5280
03:51:14,620 --> 03:51:17,560
What the fuck is this animation team?

5281
03:51:18,140 --> 03:51:19,940
What the fuck is this?

5282
03:51:21,900 --> 03:51:25,160
Where did three fucking tails come from?

5283
03:51:25,420 --> 03:51:28,800
Please tell me those other two of those were your tails.

5284
03:51:29,000 --> 03:51:30,460
You're not a hedgehog.

5285
03:51:30,780 --> 03:51:32,080
Oh, nevermind.

5286
03:51:32,160 --> 03:51:34,200
Nevermind, some lizards...

5287
03:51:34,200 --> 03:51:35,140
Nevermind, you're right.

5288
03:51:35,400 --> 03:51:37,880
Some lizards have more than three tails.

5289
03:51:37,960 --> 03:51:38,720
Two in the front.

5290
03:51:42,260 --> 03:51:44,200
It's not his tail.

5291
03:51:47,800 --> 03:51:49,040
Sorry, I meant echidnas.

5292
03:51:50,580 --> 03:51:51,860
I meant echidnas.

5293
03:51:52,360 --> 03:51:54,140
Alright, where's the next boss?

5294
03:51:54,820 --> 03:51:55,500
Go left?

5295
03:51:57,080 --> 03:51:58,220
Where did I come from?

5296
03:51:58,260 --> 03:51:58,940
I came from here.

5297
03:51:59,060 --> 03:51:59,300
Okay.

5298
03:52:02,300 --> 03:52:04,640
Alright, let's go find the other bosses first.

5299
03:52:04,720 --> 03:52:06,100
That's a normal hippo.

5300
03:52:08,760 --> 03:52:10,320
That's just a normal hippo.

5301
03:52:14,060 --> 03:52:15,480
Oh, on the mountain.

5302
03:52:19,990 --> 03:52:21,970
Okay, back to the mountain we go.

5303
03:52:22,170 --> 03:52:22,990
You mean this way?

5304
03:52:27,170 --> 03:52:28,590
Oh, where the deer was.

5305
03:52:28,730 --> 03:52:28,970
Okay.

5306
03:52:30,990 --> 03:52:31,470
Alright.

5307
03:52:33,110 --> 03:52:34,070
Instant transmission.

5308
03:52:35,030 --> 03:52:35,470
Pew!

5309
03:52:45,810 --> 03:52:46,250
Alright.

5310
03:52:47,170 --> 03:52:48,570
Where I killed the deer.

5311
03:52:52,480 --> 03:52:52,920
Alright.

5312
03:52:53,060 --> 03:52:53,500
Travel.

5313
03:52:55,820 --> 03:52:56,460
Deer sight.

5314
03:52:56,540 --> 03:52:57,000
There it is.

5315
03:53:01,240 --> 03:53:03,320
Yeah, just a bunch of regular hippos.

5316
03:53:03,740 --> 03:53:06,700
I make sure they're alive so they know that I can show mercy.

5317
03:53:09,900 --> 03:53:10,960
Alright, where do we go?

5318
03:53:12,820 --> 03:53:15,600
Up to the right of the mountain from the deer.

5319
03:53:15,820 --> 03:53:16,740
So right here.

5320
03:53:17,900 --> 03:53:18,540
Here.

5321
03:53:19,680 --> 03:53:20,320
Right?

5322
03:53:21,460 --> 03:53:22,460
This mountain?

5323
03:53:29,180 --> 03:53:31,140
Such a kind soul.

5324
03:53:34,160 --> 03:53:36,160
Look for a clearing.

5325
03:53:39,440 --> 03:53:40,540
Oh, there it is.

5326
03:53:41,900 --> 03:53:43,080
There's a fucking...

5327
03:53:43,080 --> 03:53:44,340
Oh, that's...

5328
03:53:44,910 --> 03:53:45,200
Yeah.

5329
03:53:46,640 --> 03:53:49,300
Guys, that rock does not look like...

5330
03:53:49,300 --> 03:53:50,160
Okay, I should...

5331
03:53:50,160 --> 03:53:52,380
Yeah, guys.

5332
03:53:52,640 --> 03:53:53,580
Yeah, that rock.

5333
03:53:56,380 --> 03:53:57,220
Yeah, that's...

5334
03:53:57,220 --> 03:53:57,820
Oh, okay.

5335
03:53:58,180 --> 03:53:59,240
Fuck me, I guess.

5336
03:53:59,660 --> 03:54:01,020
Okay, cool.

5337
03:54:01,260 --> 03:54:02,160
Maybe win?

5338
03:54:03,940 --> 03:54:04,520
Okay.

5339
03:54:09,500 --> 03:54:10,980
Nothing works, I guess.

5340
03:54:11,240 --> 03:54:11,820
Alright.

5341
03:54:14,020 --> 03:54:14,940
I guess...

5342
03:54:14,940 --> 03:54:17,480
I guess just nothing works.

5343
03:54:17,700 --> 03:54:21,920
I guess nothing works.

5344
03:54:24,680 --> 03:54:26,600
I guess I'll just miss everything.

5345
03:54:26,780 --> 03:54:27,300
That's fine.

5346
03:54:27,540 --> 03:54:28,160
That's fine.

5347
03:54:29,360 --> 03:54:31,260
That's absolutely fine, guys.

5348
03:54:35,080 --> 03:54:36,720
It's just life at this point.

5349
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:37,980
What's three?

5350
03:54:38,300 --> 03:54:39,540
What is the three magic?

5351
03:54:40,960 --> 03:54:42,000
What did I do?

5352
03:54:43,080 --> 03:54:44,160
I can have multiple?

5353
03:54:44,900 --> 03:54:45,960
No, it's just one.

5354
03:54:46,260 --> 03:54:46,980
Never mind.

5355
03:54:47,060 --> 03:54:48,000
It's me and my bro.

5356
03:54:49,340 --> 03:54:50,920
It's me and my...

5357
03:54:52,080 --> 03:54:52,740
That's fine.

5358
03:54:52,800 --> 03:54:53,500
You know, that's fine.

5359
03:54:54,020 --> 03:54:55,520
Two is pretty cool, too.

5360
03:54:56,400 --> 03:54:57,400
Just the two...

5361
03:54:57,880 --> 03:54:59,000
It's me and my bro.

5362
03:54:59,140 --> 03:54:59,920
Me and my clone.

5363
03:55:02,700 --> 03:55:03,140
Okay.

5364
03:55:04,980 --> 03:55:05,420
Ice!

5365
03:55:05,460 --> 03:55:06,240
Oh, shit.

5366
03:55:06,300 --> 03:55:06,780
Never mind.

5367
03:55:06,820 --> 03:55:07,160
No ice.

5368
03:55:07,500 --> 03:55:07,940
Okay.

5369
03:55:08,780 --> 03:55:09,860
You go do your thing.

5370
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:10,680
I'm just gonna watch.

5371
03:55:11,280 --> 03:55:12,240
Oh, never mind.

5372
03:55:12,300 --> 03:55:12,940
I guess we both...

5373
03:55:13,080 --> 03:55:14,560
fucking despot.

5374
03:55:14,740 --> 03:55:15,680
I guess.

5375
03:55:16,000 --> 03:55:18,060
I guess we could... You know what?

5376
03:55:18,220 --> 03:55:19,500
We'll do it again.

5377
03:55:19,720 --> 03:55:21,180
That's fucking right.

5378
03:55:21,860 --> 03:55:22,900
Go me!

5379
03:55:23,080 --> 03:55:23,680
Oh, shit.

5380
03:55:23,800 --> 03:55:24,480
Go me!

5381
03:55:26,980 --> 03:55:28,080
Guys, please.

5382
03:55:30,180 --> 03:55:32,060
What the fuck?

5383
03:55:32,620 --> 03:55:35,580
That was three fucking poisons.

5384
03:55:35,800 --> 03:55:36,840
Not poison.

5385
03:55:37,820 --> 03:55:39,540
Wait, they're all dead?

5386
03:55:39,760 --> 03:55:40,140
How?

5387
03:55:40,140 --> 03:55:40,460
How?

5388
03:55:42,040 --> 03:55:42,780
What?

5389
03:55:48,770 --> 03:55:49,140
Damn.

5390
03:55:54,400 --> 03:55:57,280
Is that what happened to the other monkeys?

5391
03:55:59,280 --> 03:56:00,760
Holy shit.

5392
03:56:01,200 --> 03:56:05,860
I don't have to know what happened to the other monkeys.

5393
03:56:06,320 --> 03:56:08,180
Oh my god.

5394
03:56:08,800 --> 03:56:09,540
Wait,

5395
03:56:12,640 --> 03:56:14,120
that tree doesn't look right.

5396
03:56:15,300 --> 03:56:16,260
Oh, no.

5397
03:56:16,320 --> 03:56:17,440
It's just a regular tree.

5398
03:56:17,560 --> 03:56:17,880
Sorry.

5399
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:21,140
That's like how it's gonna beat up a tree.

5400
03:56:25,220 --> 03:56:28,120
I can't believe that was insta-kill.

5401
03:56:28,180 --> 03:56:29,580
That's so bullshit.

5402
03:56:30,460 --> 03:56:32,920
That was actually bullshit.

5403
03:56:35,320 --> 03:56:35,920
Win.

5404
03:56:37,520 --> 03:56:38,380
Fuck this.

5405
03:56:38,660 --> 03:56:39,920
I learned my lesson.

5406
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:43,760
I fucking learned my lesson.

5407
03:56:43,940 --> 03:56:47,020
Fuck you and your stupid stupid bombs.

5408
03:56:47,880 --> 03:56:48,760
Now I know.

5409
03:56:50,260 --> 03:56:51,500
Now I fucking know.

5410
03:56:51,580 --> 03:56:52,260
Now I know.

5411
03:56:52,340 --> 03:56:53,080
Now I know.

5412
03:56:53,760 --> 03:56:55,440
You don't got me this time.

5413
03:56:55,640 --> 03:56:58,200
You don't got me this time, bitch.

5414
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:00,440
Yeah.

5415
03:57:01,500 --> 03:57:02,060
That's fine.

5416
03:57:02,100 --> 03:57:02,560
We know now.

5417
03:57:04,420 --> 03:57:05,540
We know now, chat.

5418
03:57:06,980 --> 03:57:08,340
You don't got me this time.

5419
03:57:09,240 --> 03:57:10,460
That's fucking right.

5420
03:57:11,020 --> 03:57:11,800
You know what?

5421
03:57:11,880 --> 03:57:13,740
I don't even need that.

5422
03:57:15,540 --> 03:57:16,980
I did it just cause.

5423
03:57:17,100 --> 03:57:19,720
And now, big monkey.

5424
03:57:21,020 --> 03:57:21,720
That's right.

5425
03:57:21,740 --> 03:57:25,140
I swear to god, if you guys die again, I swear to god, guys.

5426
03:57:25,380 --> 03:57:25,920
Guys.

5427
03:57:26,920 --> 03:57:29,320
You guys can't die again, guys.

5428
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:32,740
Another big monkey.

5429
03:57:32,920 --> 03:57:34,140
All the monkeys.

5430
03:57:35,320 --> 03:57:35,880
Yeah.

5431
03:57:38,040 --> 03:57:40,220
Let all the monkeys roam.

5432
03:57:41,220 --> 03:57:41,720
Nice.

5433
03:57:41,720 --> 03:57:43,320
I got my cold iron leaves.

5434
03:57:43,880 --> 03:57:44,360
Alright.

5435
03:57:45,240 --> 03:57:45,720
Okay.

5436
03:57:48,740 --> 03:57:49,220
Nice.

5437
03:57:50,080 --> 03:57:51,100
Monkey two together.

5438
03:57:51,240 --> 03:57:51,620
Strong.

5439
03:57:54,120 --> 03:57:54,600
Alright.

5440
03:57:54,960 --> 03:57:57,580
How many more optional bosses do we have left, chat?

5441
03:57:58,220 --> 03:57:59,120
How many more?

5442
03:58:01,960 --> 03:58:02,920
The homies.

5443
03:58:02,980 --> 03:58:03,900
Me and the homies.

5444
03:58:05,600 --> 03:58:07,880
We love cold iron leaves.

5445
03:58:10,540 --> 03:58:11,240
Two more?

5446
03:58:11,640 --> 03:58:12,620
What are the other two?

5447
03:58:16,460 --> 03:58:17,880
We already got the frog.

5448
03:58:18,000 --> 03:58:18,460
We already got the frog.

5449
03:58:22,980 --> 03:58:24,920
What's the other one that we don't need?

5450
03:58:26,360 --> 03:58:28,100
Oh, I like this music though.

5451
03:58:28,240 --> 03:58:29,780
This music is fucking jamming.

5452
03:58:32,920 --> 03:58:33,600
Ooh.

5453
03:58:33,720 --> 03:58:34,280
Ooh.

5454
03:58:34,320 --> 03:58:35,840
My PNG cloud.

5455
03:58:38,040 --> 03:58:39,060
Big rock?

5456
03:58:39,800 --> 03:58:40,420
Big rock?

5457
03:58:40,420 --> 03:58:41,140
There's big rock?

5458
03:58:41,260 --> 03:58:42,480
Really big rock?

5459
03:58:42,880 --> 03:58:45,000
How many rocks are there?

5460
03:58:45,740 --> 03:58:46,360
Oh, no.

5461
03:58:46,420 --> 03:58:47,920
We killed the clapping rock baby.

5462
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:48,480
Don't worry.

5463
03:58:48,640 --> 03:58:51,000
That was like one of the first optional bosses we got.

5464
03:59:00,590 --> 03:59:01,230
Don't worry.

5465
03:59:01,370 --> 03:59:02,130
I made sure.

5466
03:59:02,190 --> 03:59:03,170
He looked at me weird.

5467
03:59:10,070 --> 03:59:10,510
Okay.

5468
03:59:10,510 --> 03:59:13,270
We got the clapping rock.

5469
03:59:13,570 --> 03:59:14,710
We got the clapping rock.

5470
03:59:14,850 --> 03:59:16,410
We got the hippo.

5471
03:59:16,430 --> 03:59:17,530
We got the lizard.

5472
03:59:17,710 --> 03:59:19,430
And we got the sleeping rock.

5473
03:59:20,670 --> 03:59:22,930
Those are all the optional bosses, right?

5474
03:59:24,470 --> 03:59:24,990
Those are all the optional bosses, right?

5475
03:59:25,550 --> 03:59:27,010
I'm gonna kill a mountain?

5476
03:59:29,310 --> 03:59:29,830
I'm gonna kill a mountain?

5477
03:59:29,830 --> 03:59:30,050
Okay.

5478
03:59:30,150 --> 03:59:30,770
How do we...

5479
03:59:30,770 --> 03:59:31,130
Okay.

5480
03:59:31,130 --> 03:59:31,130
How do we...

5481
03:59:31,130 --> 03:59:32,190
How do we get the missing...

5482
03:59:32,190 --> 03:59:34,630
How do we get the missing item again?

5483
03:59:34,930 --> 03:59:35,550
We travel.

5484
03:59:40,990 --> 03:59:41,510
Wait.

5485
03:59:41,570 --> 03:59:41,990
Dragon?

5486
03:59:42,110 --> 03:59:42,410
Oh, yeah.

5487
03:59:42,470 --> 03:59:42,590
Yeah.

5488
03:59:42,630 --> 03:59:43,090
The lizard.

5489
03:59:43,350 --> 03:59:44,230
The big lizard.

5490
03:59:44,750 --> 03:59:45,730
Chapter 3.

5491
03:59:50,170 --> 03:59:51,810
Who the fuck is this guy?

5492
03:59:55,510 --> 03:59:56,270
New West?

5493
03:59:56,490 --> 03:59:56,810
Okay.

5494
03:59:57,650 --> 03:59:58,490
Oh, it's this?

5495
03:59:58,670 --> 03:59:59,010
New West.

5496
03:59:59,110 --> 03:59:59,330
Okay.

5497
04:00:00,650 --> 04:00:03,410
Mindfulness Cliff Keeper Shrine.

5498
04:00:04,430 --> 04:00:05,350
Which one is that?

5499
04:00:05,450 --> 04:00:05,830
Oh, here.

5500
04:00:07,970 --> 04:00:08,890
That's chapter 2.

5501
04:00:08,950 --> 04:00:09,790
Sorry I can't count.

5502
04:00:14,180 --> 04:00:15,540
Creeper, thank you for the super chat.

5503
04:00:15,620 --> 04:00:15,920
Thank you.

5504
04:00:15,940 --> 04:00:16,580
Thank you.

5505
04:00:16,580 --> 04:00:17,200
The monkey.

5506
04:00:19,380 --> 04:00:21,820
Go forth and drop off the wooden bridge.

5507
04:00:22,060 --> 04:00:22,500
Okay.

5508
04:00:23,400 --> 04:00:24,800
That should be the last one.

5509
04:00:27,460 --> 04:00:28,440
Oh, I see it!

5510
04:00:28,620 --> 04:00:29,220
Oh, I see it!

5511
04:00:29,220 --> 04:00:30,440
I see the instructions.

5512
04:00:32,140 --> 04:00:32,540
Okay.

5513
04:00:32,540 --> 04:00:33,740
So we drop off here.

5514
04:00:38,510 --> 04:00:39,930
And then we grab this.

5515
04:00:40,230 --> 04:00:41,490
Cause that's a heal.

5516
04:00:42,170 --> 04:00:43,370
That's some money.

5517
04:00:43,530 --> 04:00:44,530
Even though we don't need it.

5518
04:00:45,990 --> 04:00:47,510
We don't need it, but like...

5519
04:00:47,510 --> 04:00:48,650
I still want it.

5520
04:00:49,730 --> 04:00:50,630
And then we go up.

5521
04:00:50,690 --> 04:00:51,330
Oh, there it is!

5522
04:00:54,090 --> 04:00:54,730
Oh my god.

5523
04:00:54,750 --> 04:00:55,710
How weak are they now?

5524
04:00:56,910 --> 04:00:57,310
Wait.

5525
04:00:57,350 --> 04:00:57,910
They're not weak.

5526
04:00:58,510 --> 04:00:58,810
Wait, what?

5527
04:00:59,650 --> 04:01:00,550
Oh wait, no.

5528
04:01:00,570 --> 04:01:00,890
They are.

5529
04:01:00,950 --> 04:01:02,130
They literally took like...

5530
04:01:02,130 --> 04:01:04,570
They literally took like one combo.

5531
04:01:06,310 --> 04:01:07,550
Now follow the path.

5532
04:01:08,330 --> 04:01:09,250
Fuck you!

5533
04:01:10,250 --> 04:01:11,230
I'm angry.

5534
04:01:12,510 --> 04:01:15,090
So I take my anger out of you guys.

5535
04:01:15,450 --> 04:01:16,310
That's right.

5536
04:01:16,710 --> 04:01:17,870
Oh shit!

5537
04:01:20,210 --> 04:01:21,910
That doesn't stop me.

5538
04:01:22,570 --> 04:01:24,470
Two people to be angry at.

5539
04:01:24,610 --> 04:01:25,570
What a bargain.

5540
04:01:26,510 --> 04:01:26,970
Alright.

5541
04:01:29,130 --> 04:01:29,590
Nice.

5542
04:01:31,670 --> 04:01:32,130
Okay.

5543
04:01:32,250 --> 04:01:32,490
Wait.

5544
04:01:32,550 --> 04:01:32,830
Which path?

5545
04:01:32,950 --> 04:01:33,710
Oh, there's a path here.

5546
04:01:35,330 --> 04:01:36,190
A cycle.

5547
04:01:37,150 --> 04:01:38,410
Never break the cycle.

5548
04:01:41,510 --> 04:01:43,350
Just gonna get rid of them for now.

5549
04:01:44,750 --> 04:01:48,190
Oh my god.

5550
04:01:48,210 --> 04:01:49,370
Stop blocking the pathway!

5551
04:01:49,690 --> 04:01:51,010
This is why I killed you!

5552
04:01:53,190 --> 04:01:54,430
Yeah, they're very annoying.

5553
04:01:54,710 --> 04:01:55,270
You know what?

5554
04:01:55,570 --> 04:01:57,590
It was overkill, but like...

5555
04:01:59,030 --> 04:01:59,470
Like...

5556
04:02:00,730 --> 04:02:02,970
It might be overkill, but like...

5557
04:02:02,970 --> 04:02:04,090
Look, he was in the way!

5558
04:02:04,270 --> 04:02:05,230
It was self-defense!

5559
04:02:06,290 --> 04:02:07,230
He shot first.

5560
04:02:09,190 --> 04:02:10,550
You can tell he shot first.

5561
04:02:12,350 --> 04:02:13,190
Is this the item?

5562
04:02:14,650 --> 04:02:15,890
No, that's just a gourd.

5563
04:02:18,970 --> 04:02:20,210
Why don't you try... Wait.

5564
04:02:21,870 --> 04:02:22,310
Hello?

5565
04:02:23,030 --> 04:02:23,750
A rat?

5566
04:02:24,470 --> 04:02:25,890
I thought I killed all the rats!

5567
04:02:26,070 --> 04:02:26,770
What are you doing here?

5568
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:30,070
Oh shit, this is it!

5569
04:02:34,320 --> 04:02:36,000
Yeah, self doesn't exist for you.

5570
04:02:36,080 --> 04:02:36,540
Oh, there you go.

5571
04:02:36,640 --> 04:02:37,080
The thought.

5572
04:02:40,300 --> 04:02:41,840
Oh, and then we get back to the shrine.

5573
04:02:44,320 --> 04:02:44,760
Nice.

5574
04:02:46,440 --> 04:02:48,060
The last survivor!

5575
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:50,080
How did you live?

5576
04:02:50,780 --> 04:02:52,660
You were all supposed to die.

5577
04:02:53,820 --> 04:02:54,920
Wait, do I have five?

5578
04:02:55,100 --> 04:02:56,140
I have four, I think.

5579
04:02:56,780 --> 04:02:57,500
Let me go check.

5580
04:02:59,480 --> 04:03:00,640
One, two, three, four.

5581
04:03:00,840 --> 04:03:01,200
Okay.

5582
04:03:01,900 --> 04:03:02,660
Does this count?

5583
04:03:03,820 --> 04:03:04,220
No.

5584
04:03:04,340 --> 04:03:06,000
No, we're missing one more.

5585
04:03:08,080 --> 04:03:09,660
Oh, it's from chapter six?

5586
04:03:10,880 --> 04:03:12,700
Oh, I only need four.

5587
04:03:12,760 --> 04:03:12,960
Okay.

5588
04:03:14,500 --> 04:03:14,900
Alright.

5589
04:03:18,360 --> 04:03:18,760
Um...

5590
04:03:19,640 --> 04:03:21,860
Okay, we just gotta figure out how to get to...

5591
04:03:26,200 --> 04:03:26,640
Alright.

5592
04:03:28,500 --> 04:03:35,100
If you fly backwards to the mountain behind it, you'll find a free armor set by the tree.

5593
04:03:35,620 --> 04:03:39,200
Okay, but first I want to beat up the... I want to beat up the...

5594
04:03:39,200 --> 04:03:40,980
I want to beat up the giant mountain.

5595
04:03:42,040 --> 04:03:44,200
I will be the only rock remaining.

5596
04:03:44,960 --> 04:03:46,460
The only sentient rock.

5597
04:03:50,490 --> 04:03:50,930
Alright.

5598
04:03:51,030 --> 04:03:53,030
What looks like a giant mount... Oh, there he is!

5599
04:03:53,090 --> 04:03:53,570
I see him.

5600
04:03:55,170 --> 04:03:55,450
Is that him?

5601
04:03:57,490 --> 04:03:59,210
No, that's just a regular mountain.

5602
04:04:00,390 --> 04:04:01,410
I thought that was him.

5603
04:04:03,170 --> 04:04:04,190
No, that is him.

5604
04:04:04,690 --> 04:04:05,630
Wait, that is him.

5605
04:04:07,690 --> 04:04:09,070
This is where I beat up the rock baby.

5606
04:04:09,250 --> 04:04:10,670
He was sitting there looking at me from here.

5607
04:04:11,290 --> 04:04:11,650
Yeah.

5608
04:04:13,710 --> 04:04:14,250
I remember.

5609
04:04:15,110 --> 04:04:17,010
He literally sat there and looked at me.

5610
04:04:19,290 --> 04:04:20,250
This is where he sat.

5611
04:04:20,470 --> 04:04:21,050
Right here.

5612
04:04:23,670 --> 04:04:24,030
Here?

5613
04:04:36,140 --> 04:04:36,820
Where?

5614
04:04:38,920 --> 04:04:39,460
Where?

5615
04:04:39,560 --> 04:04:40,220
Oh, there.

5616
04:04:41,620 --> 04:04:43,180
I'm so lost.

5617
04:04:47,920 --> 04:04:49,300
It's too open.

5618
04:04:49,420 --> 04:04:51,660
I can't figure out my direction.

5619
04:04:53,580 --> 04:04:55,900
Okay, thank god I have the cloud.

5620
04:04:56,240 --> 04:04:58,600
I'm so lost.

5621
04:05:01,140 --> 04:05:01,820
Here we go.

5622
04:05:02,740 --> 04:05:05,300
I was like, is it... Oh, there.

5623
04:05:05,460 --> 04:05:05,680
There it is.

5624
04:05:05,800 --> 04:05:07,560
Holy fuck!

5625
04:05:07,680 --> 04:05:08,100
Okay.

5626
04:05:08,380 --> 04:05:10,100
Alright, let's do this.

5627
04:05:11,060 --> 04:05:15,260
I shall be the only sentient rock in this world.

5628
04:05:15,460 --> 04:05:15,700
Oh!

5629
04:05:17,100 --> 04:05:19,120
What the fuck that?

5630
04:05:19,300 --> 04:05:21,020
Okay, I...

5631
04:05:21,020 --> 04:05:22,920
Guys, I...

5632
04:05:23,460 --> 04:05:25,600
I think I might...

5633
04:05:25,600 --> 04:05:26,680
Guys...

5634
04:05:27,900 --> 04:05:28,660
Okay.

5635
04:05:29,100 --> 04:05:31,780
Guys, I think I was a little...

5636
04:05:31,780 --> 04:05:32,180
Whoa.

5637
04:05:32,180 --> 04:05:38,820
Guys, I think maybe I was just a little too overzealous.

5638
04:05:39,280 --> 04:05:41,640
I think...

5639
04:05:46,240 --> 04:05:47,980
Guys, when you said...

5640
04:05:47,980 --> 04:05:52,160
Guys, when you said he's a giant fucking rock mountain, I...

5641
04:05:52,160 --> 04:05:55,060
You know, I thought it was a tiny mountain.

5642
04:05:55,480 --> 04:05:58,200
This is not a tiny mountain.

5643
04:05:58,200 --> 04:06:03,600
Guys, This is absolutely... this is not a tiny mountain, the guy.

5644
04:06:07,480 --> 04:06:11,200
This is... this is a very big mountain.

5645
04:06:11,620 --> 04:06:14,920
Guys, my minions are just as confused as to where to go.

5646
04:06:15,160 --> 04:06:17,060
They... they don't know where to go.

5647
04:06:17,220 --> 04:06:18,480
Like, why did I summon them?

5648
04:06:18,540 --> 04:06:19,420
We're all so confused.

5649
04:06:19,720 --> 04:06:22,160
We're all... we're actually so...

5650
04:06:22,160 --> 04:06:26,880
Like, we're... we're doing smack.

5651
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:29,660
We're all... where are they going?

5652
04:06:30,320 --> 04:06:32,900
Where... where are they going?

5653
04:06:34,520 --> 04:06:37,480
Okay, now I know to not summon anything.

5654
04:06:37,940 --> 04:06:43,120
Okay, do not summon the... do not summon the little rock baby.

5655
04:06:46,080 --> 04:06:48,880
Do not... do not summon them.

5656
04:06:49,140 --> 04:06:51,780
That was a waste of time and magic.

5657
04:06:52,640 --> 04:06:55,260
Monkey see monkey lies.

5658
04:06:56,880 --> 04:06:58,480
They were so lost.

5659
04:06:58,860 --> 04:07:00,560
That was the worst part.

5660
04:07:00,920 --> 04:07:01,520
But...

5661
04:07:03,540 --> 04:07:04,140
Crushed!

5662
04:07:06,140 --> 04:07:08,500
Okay, we got... we don't have the shrine.

5663
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:15,720
Like, I got splashed.

5664
04:07:16,100 --> 04:07:17,860
Like, I thought...

5665
04:07:17,860 --> 04:07:22,880
You know, we all saw how big the other rock babies... all the rock people were.

5666
04:07:22,920 --> 04:07:24,200
I thought it'd be different.

5667
04:07:25,880 --> 04:07:27,500
Like, I thought it would...

5668
04:07:27,500 --> 04:07:28,200
Okay, clearly...

5669
04:07:28,740 --> 04:07:30,140
Okay, wait, I got an idea.

5670
04:07:30,380 --> 04:07:34,300
I don't think the fan will be useful here because I don't think I'm gonna...

5671
04:07:34,300 --> 04:07:35,960
I don't think...

5672
04:07:37,020 --> 04:07:39,880
I don't think the fan's gonna be useful.

5673
04:07:43,380 --> 04:07:43,860
Okay.

5674
04:07:44,420 --> 04:07:45,740
A blue rock?

5675
04:07:47,680 --> 04:07:48,760
There's a blue rock?

5676
04:07:48,840 --> 04:07:50,300
Okay, this is where I killed the child.

5677
04:07:51,620 --> 04:07:52,620
The rock child.

5678
04:07:54,200 --> 04:07:55,020
This is where...

5679
04:07:55,020 --> 04:07:57,060
He literally laughed at me, guys.

5680
04:07:58,940 --> 04:08:00,940
I have to teach him my lesson.

5681
04:08:02,300 --> 04:08:02,820
Okay.

5682
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:05,300
And then we go straight.

5683
04:08:10,010 --> 04:08:11,350
Where's the shrine though?

5684
04:08:17,270 --> 04:08:18,910
You all saw him clapping.

5685
04:08:19,070 --> 04:08:20,590
He was clapping and laughing.

5686
04:08:23,010 --> 04:08:25,130
What was he laughing about then, huh?

5687
04:08:26,170 --> 04:08:26,690
Chat?

5688
04:08:27,170 --> 04:08:29,890
What was he laughing about if it wasn't at me?

5689
04:08:32,230 --> 04:08:33,230
Explain that.

5690
04:08:34,710 --> 04:08:36,450
Not at you.

5691
04:08:36,970 --> 04:08:38,270
Then who was it?

5692
04:08:39,360 --> 04:08:41,590
He was really brave.

5693
04:08:49,240 --> 04:08:50,140
Where's the shrine?

5694
04:08:52,640 --> 04:08:53,740
He was laughing.

5695
04:08:53,840 --> 04:08:55,800
The cricket was dead and yet he was still laughing.

5696
04:09:00,550 --> 04:09:01,470
Where's the shrine?

5697
04:09:03,750 --> 04:09:04,370
No.

5698
04:09:04,550 --> 04:09:04,970
No!

5699
04:09:09,940 --> 04:09:11,980
This is not fair!

5700
04:09:12,440 --> 04:09:12,580
I...

5701
04:09:14,100 --> 04:09:14,440
Um.

5702
04:09:16,040 --> 04:09:16,720
What?!

5703
04:09:16,720 --> 04:09:20,460
What the fuck happened!

5704
04:09:20,760 --> 04:09:21,920
I already...

5705
04:09:21,920 --> 04:09:22,800
I already...

5706
04:09:22,800 --> 04:09:24,500
What the fuck!

5707
04:09:24,980 --> 04:09:27,120
What happened to me?

5708
04:09:27,640 --> 04:09:28,320
What...

5709
04:09:29,140 --> 04:09:29,820
What...

5710
04:09:29,820 --> 04:09:30,000
What...

5711
04:09:30,000 --> 04:09:31,240
What happened to me?

5712
04:09:31,300 --> 04:09:32,800
I already lost two...

5713
04:09:35,220 --> 04:09:36,820
Guys, this is bullshit.

5714
04:09:36,940 --> 04:09:38,360
I was trying to find the shrine.

5715
04:09:38,660 --> 04:09:39,280
I'm sorry guys.

5716
04:09:39,280 --> 04:09:42,300
I'm trying to find the fucking stride.

5717
04:09:42,480 --> 04:09:44,640
This is actually bullshit.

5718
04:09:44,660 --> 04:09:46,700
I'm lagging, dude.

5719
04:09:46,840 --> 04:09:49,760
Nothing is going right for Doki.

5720
04:09:52,900 --> 04:09:55,120
Oh my god, he's so far.

5721
04:09:55,740 --> 04:09:56,540
Wow!

5722
04:09:58,900 --> 04:10:01,060
When is he gonna show his hand?

5723
04:10:02,840 --> 04:10:05,000
When is he gonna show his hand?

5724
04:10:05,200 --> 04:10:07,060
I wanna fucking play.

5725
04:10:07,060 --> 04:10:07,360
I wanna play.

5726
04:10:08,480 --> 04:10:11,780
When is the hand gonna get closer?

5727
04:10:13,520 --> 04:10:13,960
Whoa!

5728
04:10:15,660 --> 04:10:16,100
Whoa!

5729
04:10:16,680 --> 04:10:18,100
Please get closer.

5730
04:10:18,200 --> 04:10:18,640
Please!

5731
04:10:19,260 --> 04:10:19,700
Please!

5732
04:10:28,200 --> 04:10:28,880
Is that?

5733
04:10:30,160 --> 04:10:30,860
This is it.

5734
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:31,360
This is it.

5735
04:10:31,360 --> 04:10:31,880
This is it.

5736
04:10:31,880 --> 04:10:32,380
This is it.

5737
04:10:32,400 --> 04:10:32,900
This is it.

5738
04:10:33,520 --> 04:10:34,600
This is not it.

5739
04:10:34,920 --> 04:10:35,620
This is it.

5740
04:10:35,620 --> 04:10:36,000
This is it.

5741
04:10:36,020 --> 04:10:36,440
This is it.

5742
04:10:36,440 --> 04:10:36,900
This is it.

5743
04:10:37,640 --> 04:10:39,100
You can't be in there.

5744
04:10:40,220 --> 04:10:41,200
It doesn't matter.

5745
04:10:42,400 --> 04:10:43,120
It doesn't.

5746
04:10:44,460 --> 04:10:45,180
Baby, please.

5747
04:10:47,480 --> 04:10:48,220
This is fine.

5748
04:10:48,320 --> 04:10:48,720
This is fine.

5749
04:10:48,760 --> 04:10:49,360
Okay, I get it.

5750
04:10:49,400 --> 04:10:50,120
I get it now, guys.

5751
04:10:50,240 --> 04:10:51,040
I figured it out.

5752
04:10:51,980 --> 04:10:53,340
Guys, I figured it out, guys.

5753
04:10:55,440 --> 04:10:56,340
Oh my god!

5754
04:10:56,360 --> 04:10:57,320
I figured it out!

5755
04:10:57,780 --> 04:10:58,640
Oh my god!

5756
04:10:58,680 --> 04:10:59,620
This is so easy!

5757
04:11:01,440 --> 04:11:02,160
Holy shit!

5758
04:11:02,200 --> 04:11:03,020
This is so easy!

5759
04:11:04,080 --> 04:11:05,020
And then I run.

5760
04:11:08,000 --> 04:11:08,800
And then I run.

5761
04:11:08,820 --> 04:11:10,260
He can't reach me now, bitch.

5762
04:11:10,260 --> 04:11:11,580
That's fucking right.

5763
04:11:11,620 --> 04:11:12,880
I know where your edge is.

5764
04:11:15,080 --> 04:11:15,860
That's right.

5765
04:11:16,080 --> 04:11:16,780
You know what?

5766
04:11:16,900 --> 04:11:17,460
Oh.

5767
04:11:19,340 --> 04:11:21,440
I thought it would...

5768
04:11:21,440 --> 04:11:23,140
I thought it would...

5769
04:11:23,140 --> 04:11:25,780
I thought...

5770
04:11:25,780 --> 04:11:28,120
I thought when I was so...

5771
04:11:28,800 --> 04:11:29,620
It would...

5772
04:11:29,620 --> 04:11:31,460
It would go over there, but I guess not.

5773
04:11:31,760 --> 04:11:35,820
I thought he would...

5774
04:11:35,820 --> 04:11:38,580
I thought the thing would head over, but...

5775
04:11:38,580 --> 04:11:39,580
But...

5776
04:11:40,660 --> 04:11:42,640
I might have wasted that.

5777
04:11:44,080 --> 04:11:46,140
Nito is also lost.

5778
04:11:46,780 --> 04:11:48,760
Nito doesn't know where to go.

5779
04:11:49,020 --> 04:11:50,460
Okay, goodbye, Nito.

5780
04:11:53,560 --> 04:11:54,800
I thought...

5781
04:11:54,800 --> 04:11:55,680
I thought...

5782
04:11:55,680 --> 04:11:59,220
I thought the Nito would go after I did that.

5783
04:11:59,860 --> 04:12:01,260
I thought the Nito would go after I did that.

5784
04:12:01,260 --> 04:12:02,780
But he was like...

5785
04:12:02,780 --> 04:12:04,000
No, that's the wrong...

5786
04:12:04,760 --> 04:12:05,520
Wrong...

5787
04:12:06,240 --> 04:12:07,040
Wrong story.

5788
04:12:10,340 --> 04:12:11,160
I thought...

5789
04:12:11,160 --> 04:12:13,760
I thought my Nito would just fucking run over there.

5790
04:12:16,180 --> 04:12:16,740
Alright.

5791
04:12:18,000 --> 04:12:18,840
Double smash!

5792
04:12:19,060 --> 04:12:20,220
Just double smash!

5793
04:12:24,200 --> 04:12:25,160
Double smash!

5794
04:12:26,540 --> 04:12:27,680
Oh, double smash.

5795
04:12:27,700 --> 04:12:28,300
He's double smashing.

5796
04:12:28,460 --> 04:12:29,620
He heard me.

5797
04:12:30,380 --> 04:12:31,640
He actually heard me.

5798
04:12:31,720 --> 04:12:32,720
I'm heading over.

5799
04:12:32,920 --> 04:12:33,960
I'm heading over.

5800
04:12:34,840 --> 04:12:35,920
I'm heading over.

5801
04:12:36,680 --> 04:12:37,860
I'm almost there.

5802
04:12:38,500 --> 04:12:39,720
I'm so close.

5803
04:12:41,240 --> 04:12:41,980
Here we go.

5804
04:12:42,620 --> 04:12:43,420
We did it.

5805
04:12:44,440 --> 04:12:45,340
We made it.

5806
04:12:46,220 --> 04:12:47,760
This is gonna take forever.

5807
04:12:47,960 --> 04:12:48,820
But, like, we're here.

5808
04:12:51,320 --> 04:12:52,640
Oh, the metal!

5809
04:12:58,140 --> 04:12:59,420
Oh my god.

5810
04:12:59,740 --> 04:13:00,660
Oh my god.

5811
04:13:00,660 --> 04:13:03,260
We could've smashed the blue parts of his head.

5812
04:13:08,200 --> 04:13:09,900
Guys, now we know.

5813
04:13:10,280 --> 04:13:11,160
Now, fuck.

5814
04:13:11,220 --> 04:13:12,800
Okay, now we know, guys.

5815
04:13:13,440 --> 04:13:14,740
Now we know.

5816
04:13:17,440 --> 04:13:20,100
I know you guys all yelled at me about the blue part.

5817
04:13:20,320 --> 04:13:21,740
But I just... I saw arms.

5818
04:13:24,480 --> 04:13:25,680
What is he gonna do?

5819
04:13:30,850 --> 04:13:31,390
Hello?

5820
04:13:36,710 --> 04:13:37,570
Yeah, that's right.

5821
04:13:38,030 --> 04:13:40,810
Yeah, that's right.

5822
04:13:40,810 --> 04:13:41,590
What you gonna do?

5823
04:13:42,610 --> 04:13:43,890
You just gonna watch?

5824
04:13:48,050 --> 04:13:48,530
Okay.

5825
04:13:50,010 --> 04:13:51,150
Haha, that's right.

5826
04:13:51,210 --> 04:13:51,750
You can't...

5827
04:13:51,750 --> 04:13:53,150
You can't reach me.

5828
04:13:53,370 --> 04:13:54,470
That's fucking right.

5829
04:13:54,550 --> 04:13:55,290
Yeah, that's right.

5830
04:13:55,790 --> 04:13:57,090
Yeah, what you gonna do?

5831
04:13:58,810 --> 04:13:59,470
That's right.

5832
04:13:59,510 --> 04:14:01,810
Get out of your fucking hole and fight me!

5833
04:14:02,990 --> 04:14:03,790
Oh, shit.

5834
04:14:03,930 --> 04:14:04,390
Okay.

5835
04:14:04,530 --> 04:14:06,990
I didn't wanna get, like, you know, crushed again.

5836
04:14:09,650 --> 04:14:10,930
And what you gonna do, huh?

5837
04:14:11,070 --> 04:14:11,310
And what you gonna do, huh?

5838
04:14:11,310 --> 04:14:11,790
That's right.

5839
04:14:11,830 --> 04:14:13,430
You have no range, you bitch.

5840
04:14:14,570 --> 04:14:15,270
That's right.

5841
04:14:15,730 --> 04:14:16,910
No range, ass.

5842
04:14:18,050 --> 04:14:18,490
Okay.

5843
04:14:18,510 --> 04:14:19,090
Wait, what?

5844
04:14:19,390 --> 04:14:19,830
Oh.

5845
04:14:19,950 --> 04:14:20,710
Okay, I forgot.

5846
04:14:21,170 --> 04:14:22,270
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

5847
04:14:22,350 --> 04:14:23,070
The blue crystals.

5848
04:14:23,090 --> 04:14:23,770
The blue hands.

5849
04:14:24,010 --> 04:14:24,930
The blue hands.

5850
04:14:25,830 --> 04:14:26,510
There we go.

5851
04:14:26,690 --> 04:14:27,650
Guys, we learned!

5852
04:14:28,510 --> 04:14:29,950
We learned about the blue!

5853
04:14:30,810 --> 04:14:32,210
Oh, I used the wrong stance.

5854
04:14:32,330 --> 04:14:32,570
Whoops.

5855
04:14:32,890 --> 04:14:33,330
Hahaha.

5856
04:14:35,710 --> 04:14:36,610
Big baby!

5857
04:14:36,990 --> 04:14:37,550
No!

5858
04:14:38,350 --> 04:14:39,970
You son of...

5859
04:14:43,970 --> 04:14:45,090
Oh, no.

5860
04:14:45,210 --> 04:14:45,590
Oh, no.

5861
04:14:45,670 --> 04:14:46,110
No!

5862
04:14:46,530 --> 04:14:47,090
No!

5863
04:14:48,170 --> 04:14:49,470
Sorry, I freaked out.

5864
04:14:49,750 --> 04:14:50,830
I freaked out.

5865
04:14:52,530 --> 04:14:53,610
Wait, is he dead?

5866
04:14:54,810 --> 04:14:55,690
Oh, he's dead.

5867
04:14:55,790 --> 04:14:56,090
Nice.

5868
04:14:56,590 --> 04:14:57,150
Okay.

5869
04:14:57,590 --> 04:14:58,150
Okay.

5870
04:14:58,410 --> 04:14:58,970
That's...

5871
04:14:59,630 --> 04:15:00,670
He just dies?

5872
04:15:02,630 --> 04:15:03,190
Okay.

5873
04:15:04,710 --> 04:15:05,270
Alright.

5874
04:15:06,330 --> 04:15:07,430
I mean, okay.

5875
04:15:07,550 --> 04:15:07,990
Nice.

5876
04:15:09,330 --> 04:15:10,950
It's my mountain now.

5877
04:15:11,050 --> 04:15:13,250
I will be the last remaining rock child.

5878
04:15:14,090 --> 04:15:15,650
Oh, it was a bamboo!

5879
04:15:16,970 --> 04:15:18,210
I mean, bamboo.

5880
04:15:18,410 --> 04:15:19,950
I mean...

5881
04:15:19,950 --> 04:15:20,850
Yeah.

5882
04:15:28,460 --> 04:15:29,060
Bamboo!

5883
04:15:33,220 --> 04:15:34,840
It was a bamboo.

5884
04:15:35,160 --> 04:15:35,760
Sorry.

5885
04:15:36,200 --> 04:15:37,560
What is she doing?

5886
04:15:37,980 --> 04:15:39,760
Oh my gosh, she's grabbing the eye!

5887
04:15:40,460 --> 04:15:41,060
Oh!

5888
04:15:41,540 --> 04:15:41,620
Oh!

5889
04:15:52,210 --> 04:15:53,450
What the fuck?

5890
04:15:55,930 --> 04:15:57,010
She's a murderer.

5891
04:16:01,980 --> 04:16:03,200
What is she doing?

5892
04:16:07,720 --> 04:16:09,320
What the fuck is she doing?

5893
04:16:11,500 --> 04:16:12,560
Oh, for me?

5894
04:16:15,680 --> 04:16:16,320
Nice.

5895
04:16:16,320 --> 04:16:16,520
Nice.

5896
04:16:22,120 --> 04:16:22,720
Nice.

5897
04:16:22,720 --> 04:16:23,400
Yeah, but my...

5898
04:16:23,400 --> 04:16:24,500
I had intentions.

5899
04:16:27,220 --> 04:16:27,820
My...

5900
04:16:27,820 --> 04:16:29,880
My murder was fueled by...

5901
04:16:30,500 --> 04:16:30,520
My...

5902
04:16:32,160 --> 04:16:33,000
My murder was fueled by...

5903
04:16:33,000 --> 04:16:35,180
was fueled by my goal of being the only...

5904
04:16:35,180 --> 04:16:35,340
was fueled by my goal of being the only...

5905
04:16:35,340 --> 04:16:36,640
the only sentient rock.

5906
04:16:36,940 --> 04:16:37,900
That's different.

5907
04:16:41,580 --> 04:16:42,600
That's different.

5908
04:16:45,380 --> 04:16:48,220
Like, I have intentions for my murder.

5909
04:17:01,240 --> 04:17:02,220
Yeah, exactly.

5910
04:17:02,220 --> 04:17:04,260
There can only be one sentient rock.

5911
04:17:05,740 --> 04:17:07,140
I did it.

5912
04:17:07,240 --> 04:17:08,880
I got the consciousness.

5913
04:17:11,760 --> 04:17:12,620
Who is he?

5914
04:17:13,360 --> 04:17:14,980
Oh, the mandrill's chief.

5915
04:17:23,890 --> 04:17:24,730
Oh, wait!

5916
04:17:24,870 --> 04:17:25,850
She knows me!

5917
04:17:29,110 --> 04:17:31,210
I just went back and became a stone.

5918
04:17:31,410 --> 04:17:32,370
Yeah, that sounds like me.

5919
04:17:37,670 --> 04:17:38,190
Oh!

5920
04:17:38,190 --> 04:17:40,750
She wanted to cure me!

5921
04:17:42,090 --> 04:17:46,910
And then I'm just like, you did all that work, and I'm alive.

5922
04:17:51,170 --> 04:17:55,250
She did all that, but I was alive in the end.

5923
04:17:58,370 --> 04:17:59,770
Yeah, she's my mom!

5924
04:18:04,320 --> 04:18:04,840
Alright.

5925
04:18:06,920 --> 04:18:09,460
The dog will turn them into buffs.

5926
04:18:09,600 --> 04:18:10,180
Oh, okay.

5927
04:18:12,720 --> 04:18:13,240
Nice.

5928
04:18:13,240 --> 04:18:13,560
Alright.

5929
04:18:15,540 --> 04:18:19,540
Let me go back to the... I like how I got this and it didn't matter.

5930
04:18:20,600 --> 04:18:21,280
Oh, nice.

5931
04:18:21,340 --> 04:18:21,760
We did it.

5932
04:18:23,380 --> 04:18:23,900
Yay!

5933
04:18:24,220 --> 04:18:25,500
Okay, instant transmission.

5934
04:18:30,890 --> 04:18:33,050
Alright, we gotta go back to do final upgrades.

5935
04:18:35,110 --> 04:18:37,330
Alright, let's max out our armor, too.

5936
04:18:37,990 --> 04:18:40,130
Since we're at the final boss, it's time.

5937
04:18:40,290 --> 04:18:42,430
I'm sorry, I know I look so fucking cool.

5938
04:18:44,470 --> 04:18:46,710
God, now I have to relive the past.

5939
04:18:47,130 --> 04:18:49,850
I'm a... I'm my own monkey!

5940
04:18:51,190 --> 04:18:52,810
I'm my own monkey, though.

5941
04:18:52,930 --> 04:18:54,890
I looked so cool before it.

5942
04:18:55,150 --> 04:18:56,550
Oh, I can't max it?

5943
04:18:58,030 --> 04:19:00,510
Oh my god, I ordered all this for no reason?

5944
04:19:00,510 --> 04:19:01,510
Don't say that.

5945
04:19:01,570 --> 04:19:01,870
No.

5946
04:19:01,990 --> 04:19:02,770
No, no.

5947
04:19:02,770 --> 04:19:04,130
Wukong 2, the DLC.

5948
04:19:04,390 --> 04:19:05,610
The DLC, guys.

5949
04:19:06,110 --> 04:19:08,990
You mean I could've upgraded the gold armor?

5950
04:19:11,390 --> 04:19:15,070
You mean I could've upgraded the gold armor?

5951
04:19:15,410 --> 04:19:18,970
And took fire early on and never had to...

5952
04:19:23,170 --> 04:19:24,910
Oh, that's awkward.

5953
04:19:25,410 --> 04:19:27,250
That's so awkward.

5954
04:19:30,510 --> 04:19:31,490
That's so fucked.

5955
04:19:31,670 --> 04:19:33,290
That's actually...

5956
04:19:33,290 --> 04:19:34,210
Okay.

5957
04:19:35,370 --> 04:19:36,930
Oh my god.

5958
04:19:37,230 --> 04:19:39,250
I'm so sad now.

5959
04:19:41,550 --> 04:19:43,190
I'm so sad.

5960
04:19:43,710 --> 04:19:49,750
Yeah, but I'll just... Oh, hello.

5961
04:19:50,650 --> 04:19:51,730
Alright, hello.

5962
04:19:52,070 --> 04:19:52,790
Magic.

5963
04:19:53,330 --> 04:19:54,770
Alright, let's see.

5964
04:19:57,430 --> 04:19:58,850
Oh, goodbye.

5965
04:20:05,270 --> 04:20:06,490
Let's see.

5966
04:20:08,130 --> 04:20:08,930
Let's see.

5967
04:20:08,970 --> 04:20:11,250
Well, where am I going?

5968
04:20:12,410 --> 04:20:12,670
Let's see.

5969
04:20:22,650 --> 04:20:24,790
Oh, yeah, here.

5970
04:20:25,770 --> 04:20:26,570
I have it.

5971
04:20:26,850 --> 04:20:27,310
Well, where am I going?

5972
04:20:27,310 --> 04:20:27,590
The us.

5973
04:20:35,560 --> 04:20:36,250
Woah!

5974
04:20:39,790 --> 04:20:42,890
What does it do?

5975
04:20:47,320 --> 04:20:50,330
Made to increase multiple attributes?

5976
04:20:51,710 --> 04:20:53,850
Or just eat- Oh!

5977
04:20:57,310 --> 04:20:58,570
Oh, now I have everything!

5978
04:21:01,110 --> 04:21:01,590
Okay.

5979
04:21:02,110 --> 04:21:04,130
Alright, we have 17!

5980
04:21:04,590 --> 04:21:06,070
Okay, we'll do one of everything.

5981
04:21:08,190 --> 04:21:11,690
Do we need stamina recovery rate chat or are we good?

5982
04:21:11,990 --> 04:21:12,630
Should we?

5983
04:21:17,870 --> 04:21:19,310
HP, I'll just do HP.

5984
04:21:19,390 --> 04:21:20,330
I'll do one of everything.

5985
04:21:21,130 --> 04:21:23,290
Okay, I'll do one of everything then.

5986
04:21:25,670 --> 04:21:26,970
Yeah, I can afford it.

5987
04:21:30,890 --> 04:21:32,770
Okay, max out health and mana?

5988
04:21:33,050 --> 04:21:34,550
I mean, how much do I need?

5989
04:21:35,390 --> 04:21:36,890
It's the final boss time.

5990
04:21:38,090 --> 04:21:40,150
5, 3, 2, 1.

5991
04:21:40,270 --> 04:21:42,470
Is it worth it to max it out?

5992
04:21:45,110 --> 04:21:45,610
Oh.

5993
04:21:46,870 --> 04:21:47,630
Oh, no.

5994
04:21:48,850 --> 04:21:49,350
No.

5995
04:21:51,890 --> 04:21:53,150
Okay, I'll do two.

5996
04:21:53,690 --> 04:21:56,990
I'll do two for health and two for mana.

5997
04:22:00,350 --> 04:22:02,330
You need to max it out?

5998
04:22:02,470 --> 04:22:02,950
Okay.

5999
04:22:04,230 --> 04:22:04,710
Okay.

6000
04:22:05,430 --> 04:22:05,910
Okay.

6001
04:22:06,170 --> 04:22:07,170
Whoa, okay.

6002
04:22:09,810 --> 04:22:10,290
Okay.

6003
04:22:14,280 --> 04:22:15,720
Okay, I guess...

6004
04:22:16,580 --> 04:22:18,260
I guess I'll max it out.

6005
04:22:21,360 --> 04:22:23,020
And I still have...

6006
04:22:24,680 --> 04:22:26,440
I don't think I can max this out.

6007
04:22:26,500 --> 04:22:27,000
I'll do...

6008
04:22:29,340 --> 04:22:31,040
Make it so that they're the same.

6009
04:22:39,100 --> 04:22:39,660
Okay.

6010
04:22:39,740 --> 04:22:39,980
Okay, mana.

6011
04:22:42,960 --> 04:22:47,000
Okay, and then we'll put the rest on HP.

6012
04:22:48,320 --> 04:22:50,860
I guess we'll put the rest on HP then.

6013
04:22:51,660 --> 04:22:52,220
Right?

6014
04:22:57,600 --> 04:23:01,140
Or should we put some on defense and stamina?

6015
04:23:02,700 --> 04:23:03,860
Is it worth it?

6016
04:23:03,920 --> 04:23:04,500
I don't know.

6017
04:23:07,780 --> 04:23:09,620
I don't know if I should put some in...

6018
04:23:16,300 --> 04:23:18,460
Maybe I'll do one defense.

6019
04:23:18,620 --> 04:23:20,360
Oh, but then I can't max out HP.

6020
04:23:22,520 --> 04:23:23,040
Defense?

6021
04:23:23,480 --> 04:23:24,440
Okay, I'll do...

6022
04:23:26,440 --> 04:23:28,380
I'll do three on defense.

6023
04:23:28,720 --> 04:23:30,380
And then...

6024
04:23:35,860 --> 04:23:37,760
Oh, no need for defense?

6025
04:23:38,120 --> 04:23:39,660
Okay, then I'll put it all on HP.

6026
04:23:39,940 --> 04:23:40,580
All right, all in.

6027
04:23:41,300 --> 04:23:42,020
All in!

6028
04:23:43,080 --> 04:23:44,440
You have no choice but to face the punishment.

6029
04:23:45,140 --> 04:23:46,520
All right, we're all in.

6030
04:23:47,580 --> 04:23:48,680
Okay, here we go.

6031
04:23:52,540 --> 04:23:53,600
Now we're poor.

6032
04:23:53,820 --> 04:23:54,380
Take the medicine!

6033
04:23:54,420 --> 04:23:55,200
Take the medicine!

6034
04:23:55,940 --> 04:23:58,180
I can't believe I didn't upgrade my armor.

6035
04:23:58,340 --> 04:23:59,220
I'm so sad.

6036
04:23:59,580 --> 04:24:00,260
I didn't...

6037
04:24:00,830 --> 04:24:04,800
I can't believe it.

6038
04:24:05,620 --> 04:24:08,340
I can't believe I didn't...

6039
04:24:08,750 --> 04:24:12,200
I could've upgraded my Cold Armor.

6040
04:24:24,980 --> 04:24:26,500
Okay, let's see.

6041
04:24:29,000 --> 04:24:30,320
Okay, we traveled.

6042
04:24:31,900 --> 04:24:36,080
I don't remember where the water... Oh wait, I've lost two of my left.

6043
04:24:36,400 --> 04:24:37,340
I remember now.

6044
04:24:37,400 --> 04:24:38,220
It's where I killed the baby.

6045
04:24:40,020 --> 04:24:41,640
This is like where I remember things.

6046
04:24:41,820 --> 04:24:43,360
Where did I kill the rock baby?

6047
04:24:45,920 --> 04:24:47,720
It's like I'm figuring out the direction.

6048
04:24:49,540 --> 04:24:55,000
I find where I killed the rock baby and then I know where I am.

6049
04:24:55,380 --> 04:24:59,020
I don't know why, but that's where I killed him.

6050
04:24:59,120 --> 04:25:00,360
Right over there, you see that?

6051
04:25:00,560 --> 04:25:01,840
That's where I killed him.

6052
04:25:02,020 --> 04:25:03,740
He was looking at me right there.

6053
04:25:08,900 --> 04:25:11,180
Okay, let's go here.

6054
04:25:11,360 --> 04:25:12,480
Oh, it glitched out again.

6055
04:25:12,820 --> 04:25:13,340
Okay.

6056
04:25:13,360 --> 04:25:13,880
Um...

6057
04:25:15,780 --> 04:25:16,220
Okay.

6058
04:25:19,320 --> 04:25:20,180
Do I have it?

6059
04:25:20,300 --> 04:25:21,260
I'm wearing everything, right?

6060
04:25:21,320 --> 04:25:21,560
Yeah.

6061
04:25:22,540 --> 04:25:23,980
Why is it not five?

6062
04:25:24,240 --> 04:25:25,020
What do you mean five?

6063
04:25:26,100 --> 04:25:26,900
This is four!

6064
04:25:27,800 --> 04:25:29,240
Oh, is it my staff?

6065
04:25:31,820 --> 04:25:32,980
How is it five?

6066
04:25:34,160 --> 04:25:37,900
Oh, it's the last... Do I... I can't use Erdon's staff?

6067
04:25:39,140 --> 04:25:39,580
No!

6068
04:25:39,580 --> 04:25:40,860
Can I not use it?

6069
04:25:41,600 --> 04:25:43,020
Oh, I'm about to get it.

6070
04:25:46,620 --> 04:25:49,640
Yeah, but like, I'm not gonna change into that armor though.

6071
04:25:49,800 --> 04:25:51,360
Like, is it worth getting the armor?

6072
04:26:04,250 --> 04:26:04,690
Okay.

6073
04:26:10,810 --> 04:26:11,690
Absolutely okay.

6074
04:26:13,030 --> 04:26:13,470
Alright.

6075
04:26:19,100 --> 04:26:20,060
Alright, here we go.

6076
04:26:20,220 --> 04:26:21,580
Back to my house.

6077
04:26:31,200 --> 04:26:31,640
Alright.

6078
04:26:31,640 --> 04:26:32,480
Where is it?

6079
04:26:34,880 --> 04:26:35,540
Knock knock!

6080
04:26:36,040 --> 04:26:37,060
Wait, why am I knocking?

6081
04:26:37,140 --> 04:26:38,040
This is where I live.

6082
04:26:40,740 --> 04:26:41,800
Home sweet home!

6083
04:26:41,940 --> 04:26:43,640
Wait, who light the fire here?

6084
04:26:44,060 --> 04:26:44,960
Wait a minute.

6085
04:26:46,100 --> 04:26:47,060
Who fucking...

6086
04:26:47,060 --> 04:26:49,040
Who fucking broke into my home?

6087
04:26:51,660 --> 04:26:56,120
Somebody light the fire here and it wasn't me because I still don't have my memory yet.

6088
04:26:59,020 --> 04:27:00,500
Who broke into my home?

6089
04:27:03,940 --> 04:27:05,240
Oh, I can use it.

6090
04:27:05,260 --> 04:27:06,900
No, not to use my stupid legs.

6091
04:27:10,580 --> 04:27:12,220
No, not my legs.

6092
04:27:14,020 --> 04:27:16,840
Not to walk like a fucking regular monkey.

6093
04:27:22,500 --> 04:27:23,700
Oh, that's my staff!

6094
04:27:24,680 --> 04:27:25,940
I made it big!

6095
04:27:27,700 --> 04:27:28,600
Oh, that's cool.

6096
04:27:29,160 --> 04:27:30,500
That's my staff right there.

6097
04:27:42,970 --> 04:27:44,090
Is he gonna say anything?

6098
04:27:45,550 --> 04:27:46,810
I have to...

6099
04:27:46,810 --> 04:27:50,870
Oh, that's my fucking tiger pelt shit.

6100
04:27:51,630 --> 04:27:52,690
That I sometimes have.

6101
04:27:57,180 --> 04:27:58,400
Bro, what the fuck?

6102
04:27:59,160 --> 04:27:59,840
Disrespectful.

6103
04:28:01,520 --> 04:28:03,220
Where did you come from?

6104
04:28:03,660 --> 04:28:05,060
I am a monkey from the Great Sheng.

6105
04:28:05,940 --> 04:28:07,640
I am just a normal monkey.

6106
04:28:10,520 --> 04:28:12,900
Your face is so ugly.

6107
04:28:13,280 --> 04:28:14,800
You look like a pile of thunder.

6108
04:28:16,620 --> 04:28:19,260
This is a monster that doesn't come out.

6109
04:28:26,740 --> 04:28:28,780
Oh, he's reliving memories.

6110
04:28:34,460 --> 04:28:40,420
This is like GTA RP, but like Wukong's own server.

6111
04:28:45,620 --> 04:28:49,440
Yeah, he's reliving the memories he had with Wukong.

6112
04:28:49,680 --> 04:28:50,360
Yeah, he's reliving the memories he had with Wukong.

6113
04:28:50,360 --> 04:28:51,060
Yeah, he's reliving the memories he had with Wukong.

6114
04:28:51,060 --> 04:28:53,000
I haven't been here in a long time.

6115
04:28:54,360 --> 04:28:57,340
I don't think it's still the same.

6116
04:29:02,110 --> 04:29:03,550
Back in the day, he was sitting on this chair.

6117
04:29:05,430 --> 04:29:07,190
And he was pressing me against his head.

6118
04:29:10,390 --> 04:29:11,710
What happened to him?

6119
04:29:12,970 --> 04:29:15,510
Look, there was a lot of spoilage.

6120
04:29:17,630 --> 04:29:18,070
Look, guys.

6121
04:29:21,510 --> 04:29:23,470
There was a lot of things going on.

6122
04:29:23,490 --> 04:29:24,150
In the background.

6123
04:29:24,890 --> 04:29:26,710
There was a lot of physics.

6124
04:29:38,340 --> 04:29:38,840
Oh.

6125
04:29:39,640 --> 04:29:40,780
Put it in my ear.

6126
04:29:53,180 --> 04:29:53,680
Wait.

6127
04:29:54,900 --> 04:29:56,500
It's supposed to go in my ear.

6128
04:29:57,440 --> 04:29:58,280
Oh, you don't know?

6129
04:29:58,360 --> 04:29:59,860
He hides the staff in his ear.

6130
04:30:02,540 --> 04:30:03,440
I don't know why.

6131
04:30:03,700 --> 04:30:04,080
But like...

6132
04:30:04,080 --> 04:30:05,520
I mean like...

6133
04:30:05,520 --> 04:30:07,060
He could literally just hold it.

6134
04:30:07,060 --> 04:30:07,980
But like...

6135
04:30:09,520 --> 04:30:10,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6136
04:30:10,660 --> 04:30:11,520
For those who don't know.

6137
04:30:11,740 --> 04:30:13,820
In the story, he puts this in his ear.

6138
04:30:14,120 --> 04:30:16,140
So like, people will think he's not armed.

6139
04:30:16,360 --> 04:30:18,880
And then he'll be like, Oh, you think I'm not armed?

6140
04:30:18,960 --> 04:30:20,180
And then he takes it out of his ear.

6141
04:30:24,160 --> 04:30:25,400
He just likes it like that.

6142
04:30:25,500 --> 04:30:25,680
Yeah.

6143
04:30:33,480 --> 04:30:35,380
Wait, it was the back of his ear?

6144
04:30:37,340 --> 04:30:39,580
I always thought it was in his ear.

6145
04:30:40,560 --> 04:30:44,080
Because it always seems like it goes in his ear every time.

6146
04:30:55,500 --> 04:30:56,720
Yeah, I thought it was inside.

6147
04:30:59,600 --> 04:31:00,420
Yeah, I'm correct!

6148
04:31:00,500 --> 04:31:01,440
I knew I was correct!

6149
04:31:01,720 --> 04:31:04,100
I was like, no, it clearly was inside his ear.

6150
04:31:07,040 --> 04:31:07,800
Oh, shit.

6151
04:31:07,840 --> 04:31:08,260
I'm worthy.

6152
04:31:10,000 --> 04:31:10,840
I knew it.

6153
04:31:10,920 --> 04:31:12,060
I was like, there's no way.

6154
04:31:12,200 --> 04:31:14,240
I'm pretty sure it's in his ear.

6155
04:31:14,420 --> 04:31:16,040
But yeah, I don't know why he did.

6156
04:31:16,180 --> 04:31:16,540
I don't know.

6157
04:31:16,720 --> 04:31:17,680
I guess it's like...

6158
04:31:17,680 --> 04:31:19,160
People don't know he's armed.

6159
04:31:19,340 --> 04:31:21,240
But then, like, when you see Wukong...

6160
04:31:21,240 --> 04:31:22,500
When you see Xu Menghong...

6161
04:31:22,500 --> 04:31:24,860
And he's wearing the band on his head.

6162
04:31:24,980 --> 04:31:26,280
Like, you know he's fucking armed.

6163
04:31:26,340 --> 04:31:28,540
He's literally a fucking monkey with armor.

6164
04:31:33,300 --> 04:31:34,620
It's just very heavy.

6165
04:31:36,120 --> 04:31:37,900
I mean, he could just...

6166
04:31:51,760 --> 04:31:52,380
Let's go!

6167
04:31:52,380 --> 04:31:53,820
We got it!

6168
04:31:53,860 --> 04:31:54,540
We got his staff!

6169
04:32:00,000 --> 04:32:01,120
Try hard...

6170
04:32:01,880 --> 04:32:03,760
Try and hold for... Okay, let's see.

6171
04:32:04,400 --> 04:32:04,860
Whoa!

6172
04:32:05,220 --> 04:32:06,340
Look at my arm!

6173
04:32:06,680 --> 04:32:07,600
Oh wait, you guys can't see it.

6174
04:32:08,100 --> 04:32:08,660
Alright.

6175
04:32:11,700 --> 04:32:13,260
Oh, that looks strong.

6176
04:32:14,260 --> 04:32:15,820
Wait, that shit looks strong.

6177
04:32:18,640 --> 04:32:20,120
I'm finally him, guys.

6178
04:32:21,640 --> 04:32:22,160
I'm him.

6179
04:32:23,580 --> 04:32:24,600
Where do I go?

6180
04:32:25,480 --> 04:32:26,080
Let's go.

6181
04:32:26,920 --> 04:32:27,660
This way?

6182
04:32:31,550 --> 04:32:32,430
Oh, this way.

6183
04:32:33,070 --> 04:32:33,870
Where's the hole?

6184
04:32:36,730 --> 04:32:40,250
Guys, is the hole right in the giant hole in front of us?

6185
04:32:43,950 --> 04:32:45,010
I'm him now.

6186
04:32:48,860 --> 04:32:50,600
Oh my god, where could it be?

6187
04:32:50,760 --> 04:32:51,540
It could never...

6188
04:32:52,210 --> 04:32:55,580
Oh my god, could it be the giant hole that's right in front of us?

6189
04:32:55,620 --> 04:32:56,440
Guys, no way.

6190
04:32:56,440 --> 04:32:57,480
Let's go.

6191
04:33:00,940 --> 04:33:01,420
Okay.

6192
04:33:02,800 --> 04:33:03,760
Oh, I just did.

6193
04:33:03,820 --> 04:33:04,540
No, I saw it.

6194
04:33:04,600 --> 04:33:05,440
It was fucking insane.

6195
04:33:05,820 --> 04:33:07,940
That looked like a lot of damage.

6196
04:33:11,720 --> 04:33:12,680
Oh, I can craft?

6197
04:33:15,940 --> 04:33:17,080
This is the one I have.

6198
04:33:17,580 --> 04:33:18,720
What can I craft?

6199
04:33:19,680 --> 04:33:20,440
This one?

6200
04:33:20,500 --> 04:33:21,180
The 30?

6201
04:33:21,920 --> 04:33:27,900
Like, I'm just like wondering, was it trying to make me craft the one that says 30?

6202
04:33:29,000 --> 04:33:30,260
Like, Jesus.

6203
04:33:34,000 --> 04:33:35,700
Oh, that wasn't four?

6204
04:33:41,290 --> 04:33:43,650
Oh, I don't have focus point four.

6205
04:33:45,070 --> 04:33:47,010
Wait, can I go beyond four?

6206
04:33:47,410 --> 04:33:48,990
What the fuck happened?

6207
04:33:56,060 --> 04:33:57,300
No, I'm just vibrating.

6208
04:33:58,140 --> 04:33:59,440
I only had three.

6209
04:34:01,060 --> 04:34:01,740
Woo!

6210
04:34:02,740 --> 04:34:03,420
Yeah.

6211
04:34:07,860 --> 04:34:08,740
All right.

6212
04:34:08,780 --> 04:34:09,080
Okay.

6213
04:34:09,080 --> 04:34:09,540
I'm going to try this.

6214
04:34:10,540 --> 04:34:10,960
Please.

6215
04:34:11,560 --> 04:34:11,960
Please.

6216
04:34:12,840 --> 04:34:13,260
Okay.

6217
04:34:13,380 --> 04:34:14,140
I can't do the thing.

6218
04:34:14,880 --> 04:34:15,300
Yeah.

6219
04:34:15,380 --> 04:34:16,900
I don't have the fourth focus point.

6220
04:34:20,900 --> 04:34:22,180
No, I have enough.

6221
04:34:22,280 --> 04:34:23,700
I hoarded it just for that.

6222
04:34:25,880 --> 04:34:26,300
Okay.

6223
04:34:26,400 --> 04:34:27,560
I don't have 20, guys.

6224
04:34:28,240 --> 04:34:28,440
All right.

6225
04:34:33,500 --> 04:34:34,340
Number five.

6226
04:34:34,620 --> 04:34:35,260
What's that?

6227
04:34:35,420 --> 04:34:35,840
Okay.

6228
04:34:36,540 --> 04:34:36,960
Okay.

6229
04:34:36,960 --> 04:34:37,680
That's awkward.

6230
04:34:37,920 --> 04:34:38,340
Okay.

6231
04:34:38,520 --> 04:34:38,940
Okay.

6232
04:34:38,940 --> 04:34:39,060
Okay.

6233
04:34:41,820 --> 04:34:42,280
Wait.

6234
04:34:42,400 --> 04:34:43,980
I don't need my stances then, right?

6235
04:34:45,960 --> 04:34:48,060
Technically, I don't need my stances, right?

6236
04:34:52,060 --> 04:34:52,860
I do?

6237
04:34:54,420 --> 04:34:55,760
Where do I put it on?

6238
04:34:58,120 --> 04:34:58,580
Okay.

6239
04:34:58,800 --> 04:35:01,120
I guess I'll put...

6240
04:35:05,760 --> 04:35:06,220
Okay.

6241
04:35:06,220 --> 04:35:06,780
Health stats.

6242
04:35:09,100 --> 04:35:10,020
I'll take...

6243
04:35:12,120 --> 04:35:14,200
Which one do I take it off?

6244
04:35:14,240 --> 04:35:14,280
Okay.

6245
04:35:14,300 --> 04:35:14,720
I'll take that.

6246
04:35:22,800 --> 04:35:23,680
Remove mana.

6247
04:35:24,040 --> 04:35:24,480
Okay.

6248
04:35:24,920 --> 04:35:25,800
I'll do...

6249
04:35:25,800 --> 04:35:26,940
I need to go to the shrine.

6250
04:35:27,240 --> 04:35:27,820
Give me a sec.

6251
04:35:27,980 --> 04:35:28,640
Give me a sec.

6252
04:35:29,020 --> 04:35:29,880
Give me a sec.

6253
04:35:30,000 --> 04:35:31,140
I'll be right back, guys.

6254
04:35:31,460 --> 04:35:32,780
I'll be right back, Tupac.

6255
04:35:33,100 --> 04:35:34,100
I'll be right back.

6256
04:35:38,260 --> 04:35:39,360
I'll be right back.

6257
04:35:42,380 --> 04:35:43,140
Let's see.

6258
04:35:43,260 --> 04:35:44,360
He'll be fine, right?

6259
04:35:45,880 --> 04:35:47,280
Oh, should I use spellbinding?

6260
04:35:48,180 --> 04:35:48,620
Is that a thing?

6261
04:35:49,460 --> 04:35:50,100
For this?

6262
04:35:50,320 --> 04:35:50,560
Okay.

6263
04:35:52,260 --> 04:35:54,060
I mean, we don't need spin.

6264
04:35:56,020 --> 04:35:57,060
We don't need spin.

6265
04:35:57,200 --> 04:35:58,240
We don't need a spin, guys.

6266
04:36:01,930 --> 04:36:03,270
Okay, we should have it now.

6267
04:36:11,000 --> 04:36:11,780
There we go.

6268
04:36:17,120 --> 04:36:18,280
Spell is binary strong?

6269
04:36:18,600 --> 04:36:19,500
Alright, it's time.

6270
04:36:23,520 --> 04:36:24,880
It's time then.

6271
04:36:25,460 --> 04:36:26,420
It's time.

6272
04:36:26,840 --> 04:36:27,300
Okay.

6273
04:36:29,620 --> 04:36:31,000
Okay, let's grab...

6274
04:36:31,000 --> 04:36:33,160
Wait, why did you guys make me increase mana?

6275
04:36:34,540 --> 04:36:35,800
What the fuck?

6276
04:36:40,990 --> 04:36:44,050
Guys, why did you make me waste it on the mana?

6277
04:36:49,760 --> 04:36:50,300
Okay.

6278
04:36:50,500 --> 04:36:51,860
Oh, mana makes it stronger.

6279
04:36:52,160 --> 04:36:52,460
Okay.

6280
04:36:52,620 --> 04:36:54,300
More mana, more damage.

6281
04:36:54,400 --> 04:36:54,720
Okay.

6282
04:36:54,900 --> 04:36:55,580
Thank god.

6283
04:36:55,700 --> 04:36:55,980
Okay.

6284
04:36:56,340 --> 04:36:58,740
I was gonna be very mad.

6285
04:36:59,080 --> 04:37:01,960
I was gonna be very mad.

6286
04:37:05,340 --> 04:37:07,960
I was gonna be like, what the fuck?

6287
04:37:08,440 --> 04:37:09,860
What was the point?

6288
04:37:12,880 --> 04:37:16,300
Okay, there we go.

6289
04:37:16,320 --> 04:37:17,040
We got spellbinder.

6290
04:37:17,280 --> 04:37:20,320
And I guess we'll get rid of monkeys too.

6291
04:37:22,320 --> 04:37:23,480
We'll get rid of monkeys.

6292
04:37:27,460 --> 04:37:28,940
Okay, we're gonna do this.

6293
04:37:34,300 --> 04:37:36,400
And then we'll...

6294
04:37:37,340 --> 04:37:37,820
Sprint.

6295
04:37:38,940 --> 04:37:39,420
Defense.

6296
04:37:40,820 --> 04:37:41,540
There we go.

6297
04:37:46,840 --> 04:37:48,040
We still have...

6298
04:37:48,040 --> 04:37:48,680
two more.

6299
04:37:53,220 --> 04:37:53,960
There we go.

6300
04:37:55,540 --> 04:37:56,340
Oh, you're right.

6301
04:37:56,500 --> 04:37:58,260
Why am I not maxing out my mana?

6302
04:38:00,600 --> 04:38:01,400
There we go.

6303
04:38:04,550 --> 04:38:05,770
I think we're good.

6304
04:38:07,350 --> 04:38:08,070
We're okay.

6305
04:38:11,330 --> 04:38:12,550
Is he still fighting?

6306
04:38:13,410 --> 04:38:14,230
Is he still fighting?

6307
04:38:14,250 --> 04:38:16,190
I was gonna say, is he still fighting?

6308
04:38:16,310 --> 04:38:16,930
Did I left?

6309
04:38:21,160 --> 04:38:21,880
Alright, let's see.

6310
04:38:23,280 --> 04:38:23,640
One.

6311
04:38:24,560 --> 04:38:24,920
Two.

6312
04:38:26,020 --> 04:38:26,380
Three.

6313
04:38:27,900 --> 04:38:28,260
Four.

6314
04:38:30,960 --> 04:38:31,680
Oh, shit!

6315
04:38:32,820 --> 04:38:33,480
Oh, shit!

6316
04:38:33,520 --> 04:38:34,060
What the fuck?

6317
04:38:34,340 --> 04:38:34,820
Don't worry.

6318
04:38:35,880 --> 04:38:37,140
I can move while doing this.

6319
04:38:37,220 --> 04:38:37,640
Okay, nice.

6320
04:38:39,380 --> 04:38:40,080
Give me a sec.

6321
04:38:40,180 --> 04:38:40,520
Give me a sec.

6322
04:38:40,600 --> 04:38:40,960
I'm gonna go ahead.

6323
04:38:43,300 --> 04:38:45,980
Look, it was really nice of him to let me like...

6324
04:38:47,080 --> 04:38:48,040
Let me...

6325
04:38:48,040 --> 04:38:50,020
Let me move out.

6326
04:38:50,260 --> 04:38:52,260
That was really nice of him.

6327
04:38:52,300 --> 04:38:52,880
Not gonna lie.

6328
04:38:55,380 --> 04:38:58,180
I really appreciate it, guys.

6329
04:38:58,320 --> 04:38:59,840
That really means a lot.

6330
04:39:00,240 --> 04:39:02,440
That you guys let me just, you know, walk over.

6331
04:39:02,780 --> 04:39:04,780
I forgot to set the spell on there.

6332
04:39:04,840 --> 04:39:05,400
Oh my god.

6333
04:39:05,460 --> 04:39:06,380
Okay, give me a sec.

6334
04:39:07,260 --> 04:39:08,220
Sorry, Chupacay.

6335
04:39:09,080 --> 04:39:10,380
Sorry for the detour.

6336
04:39:12,580 --> 04:39:13,060
Sorry.

6337
04:39:17,850 --> 04:39:18,990
Okay, let's see.

6338
04:39:20,050 --> 04:39:21,150
Let's set spells.

6339
04:39:23,830 --> 04:39:24,310
Spellbinder.

6340
04:39:24,370 --> 04:39:25,050
There we go.

6341
04:39:28,460 --> 04:39:29,340
Alright, here we go.

6342
04:39:30,420 --> 04:39:31,240
We got it.

6343
04:39:31,320 --> 04:39:31,940
We're fine.

6344
04:39:32,640 --> 04:39:33,620
What do I need?

6345
04:39:34,700 --> 04:39:35,700
Up big baby.

6346
04:39:35,800 --> 04:39:37,340
Yeah, big baby has been there from the beginning.

6347
04:39:37,420 --> 04:39:38,540
I never changed big baby.

6348
04:39:41,000 --> 04:39:42,260
Alright, up we go.

6349
04:39:43,420 --> 04:39:44,920
Up we fucking go.

6350
04:39:53,210 --> 04:39:54,770
Up we fucking go.

6351
04:39:56,330 --> 04:39:57,390
Okay, whatever.

6352
04:40:00,620 --> 04:40:06,370
You guys see the tiny, the very, very tiny...

6353
04:40:06,370 --> 04:40:07,850
Okay, alright.

6354
04:40:08,010 --> 04:40:10,750
If I heal, there we go.

6355
04:40:11,010 --> 04:40:16,570
The very, the very fucking tiny little speck.

6356
04:40:18,340 --> 04:40:20,250
That's actually bullshit.

6357
04:40:20,590 --> 04:40:22,890
Holy shit.

6358
04:40:23,110 --> 04:40:26,710
The very, very tiny little speck.

6359
04:40:30,890 --> 04:40:32,770
Oh my god.

6360
04:40:32,890 --> 04:40:35,190
That's actually bullshit.

6361
04:40:35,570 --> 04:40:38,110
That's actually bullshit.

6362
04:40:40,790 --> 04:40:41,530
Alright.

6363
04:40:41,950 --> 04:40:43,250
Don't worry, we're okay.

6364
04:40:46,420 --> 04:40:48,170
It's cause I maxed out my mana.

6365
04:40:48,510 --> 04:40:50,590
It's cause I maxed out my mana.

6366
04:40:50,590 --> 04:40:52,470
It's from the mana max.

6367
04:40:54,770 --> 04:40:56,290
Oh my god.

6368
04:40:57,570 --> 04:40:58,070
I...

6369
04:40:58,740 --> 04:41:00,190
Oh god, Chewbacca.

6370
04:41:04,160 --> 04:41:04,660
Nice.

6371
04:41:05,640 --> 04:41:07,720
They're still alive, but like, you know, it's a...

6372
04:41:07,720 --> 04:41:09,080
It looked cool though.

6373
04:41:09,300 --> 04:41:10,820
Bro, it looked so cool.

6374
04:41:10,920 --> 04:41:15,060
It might have done like nothing, but it looked so cool, bro.

6375
04:41:16,200 --> 04:41:16,920
It's alright.

6376
04:41:17,340 --> 04:41:18,320
It's okay, bro.

6377
04:41:18,840 --> 04:41:20,560
As long as it looked cool.

6378
04:41:23,720 --> 04:41:26,900
As long as it looked so fucking cool.

6379
04:41:29,600 --> 04:41:30,440
It's okay.

6380
04:41:30,820 --> 04:41:33,040
I have Spellbinder on chat.

6381
04:41:35,880 --> 04:41:38,780
He didn't max out his mana.

6382
04:41:41,620 --> 04:41:44,700
You could have run... I thought I was supposed to fight them.

6383
04:41:45,160 --> 04:41:46,120
Am I not?

6384
04:41:52,280 --> 04:41:52,900
No.

6385
04:41:52,900 --> 04:41:53,900
No rest.

6386
04:41:54,880 --> 04:41:55,880
Just fight.

6387
04:41:58,480 --> 04:41:59,280
Just fight.

6388
04:42:01,740 --> 04:42:03,600
Why rest when I can fight?

6389
04:42:04,800 --> 04:42:05,560
Free XP.

6390
04:42:06,980 --> 04:42:08,860
Yeah, it's cooler if I fight them.

6391
04:42:12,480 --> 04:42:12,880
Alright.

6392
04:42:12,880 --> 04:42:13,720
Are they all dead?

6393
04:42:19,650 --> 04:42:20,810
Yeah, I want the XP.

6394
04:42:21,990 --> 04:42:23,490
No rest, only fight.

6395
04:42:24,430 --> 04:42:27,770
I thought he was gonna kill them, you know, when he ran at them, but that's alright.

6396
04:42:28,230 --> 04:42:28,830
You know what?

6397
04:42:28,870 --> 04:42:29,450
Maybe you're right.

6398
04:42:29,510 --> 04:42:30,530
Maybe if I just run.

6399
04:42:30,710 --> 04:42:31,770
Like, what are they gonna do?

6400
04:42:31,930 --> 04:42:33,390
Oh, they're so slow.

6401
04:42:35,670 --> 04:42:38,070
Wait, they're so... look at these guys.

6402
04:42:38,230 --> 04:42:40,230
And they're from the Celestial Core?

6403
04:42:40,810 --> 04:42:41,830
My god.

6404
04:42:42,270 --> 04:42:43,410
Bro, what the fuck?

6405
04:42:43,450 --> 04:42:45,410
You guys are from the Celestial Core?

6406
04:42:46,130 --> 04:42:46,690
Like...

6407
04:42:48,790 --> 04:42:52,170
Look at these guys.

6408
04:42:52,370 --> 04:42:53,210
Look at them.

6409
04:42:53,270 --> 04:42:54,270
Look at these guys.

6410
04:42:54,730 --> 04:42:57,070
They can't even run up properly.

6411
04:42:58,110 --> 04:42:59,590
Oh, he's coming for me.

6412
04:42:59,770 --> 04:43:01,910
He's coming for me.

6413
04:43:01,930 --> 04:43:02,290
He's coming for me.

6414
04:43:04,010 --> 04:43:04,450
Okay.

6415
04:43:05,050 --> 04:43:05,590
We're fine.

6416
04:43:06,970 --> 04:43:07,870
Oh, we made it.

6417
04:43:08,490 --> 04:43:09,430
This looks safe.

6418
04:43:13,790 --> 04:43:14,810
Wait, which way do I go?

6419
04:43:14,930 --> 04:43:15,190
Oh, this way.

6420
04:43:15,550 --> 04:43:16,910
This looks so safe.

6421
04:43:17,150 --> 04:43:17,970
Are they still...

6422
04:43:17,970 --> 04:43:18,770
Okay, they're just gone.

6423
04:43:21,070 --> 04:43:23,610
Wait, my stamina is not going down.

6424
04:43:24,830 --> 04:43:26,070
Is it because of this level?

6425
04:43:27,030 --> 04:43:28,310
I just realized that.

6426
04:43:33,940 --> 04:43:35,080
Oh, through the...

6427
04:43:35,080 --> 04:43:36,340
through the crevices.

6428
04:43:38,900 --> 04:43:40,040
That's because I'm cool.

6429
04:43:45,340 --> 04:43:46,020
Hello?

6430
04:43:46,320 --> 04:43:47,800
It's so calm now.

6431
04:43:51,040 --> 04:43:51,720
Oh.

6432
04:43:54,160 --> 04:43:56,820
A loading screen crevice.

6433
04:44:01,180 --> 04:44:02,060
I'm him.

6434
04:44:03,680 --> 04:44:04,560
That's me.

6435
04:44:05,320 --> 04:44:06,180
That's right.

6436
04:44:08,640 --> 04:44:09,140
Oh.

6437
04:44:09,420 --> 04:44:11,200
Oh, I thought we were still loading.

6438
04:44:11,520 --> 04:44:12,740
I thought...

6439
04:44:12,740 --> 04:44:15,740
I thought something was going to happen.

6440
04:44:15,900 --> 04:44:17,980
I don't know.

6441
04:44:18,120 --> 04:44:19,720
I thought something was going to happen there.

6442
04:44:21,380 --> 04:44:23,020
Can we get the graphics back?

6443
04:44:23,260 --> 04:44:24,800
Okay, do you think it'll be okay?

6444
04:44:25,120 --> 04:44:27,480
Do you think it'll be...

6445
04:44:28,300 --> 04:44:28,800
Alright.

6446
04:44:29,500 --> 04:44:31,300
We'll see when we make it.

6447
04:44:31,340 --> 04:44:33,080
Guys, there's a lot of grass everywhere.

6448
04:44:33,080 --> 04:44:34,720
Guys, I don't know about it.

6449
04:44:34,760 --> 04:44:35,120
Not now.

6450
04:44:35,600 --> 04:44:42,640
Not now yet.

6451
04:44:42,720 --> 04:44:45,680
There's a lot of stuff going around us.

6452
04:44:46,340 --> 04:44:47,980
Look at the trees.

6453
04:44:48,340 --> 04:44:50,980
Look at all these leaves over here.

6454
04:45:00,180 --> 04:45:02,800
A lot of vegetation, exactly.

6455
04:45:02,880 --> 04:45:06,000
There's a lot of vegetation right now.

6456
04:45:09,140 --> 04:45:09,880
Alright.

6457
04:45:10,220 --> 04:45:11,440
Up we go.

6458
04:45:13,120 --> 04:45:14,300
Up we go.

6459
04:45:15,480 --> 04:45:16,640
Oh, that's me!

6460
04:45:18,380 --> 04:45:19,320
That's me!

6461
04:45:19,680 --> 04:45:20,880
That's my egg!

6462
04:45:21,120 --> 04:45:22,540
My monkey egg!

6463
04:45:27,540 --> 04:45:29,020
Wake up!

6464
04:45:32,710 --> 04:45:33,360
Wake up!

6465
04:45:36,180 --> 04:45:37,560
My rock egg!

6466
04:45:39,340 --> 04:45:40,200
That's me!

6467
04:45:41,120 --> 04:45:42,000
Look at me!

6468
04:45:42,160 --> 04:45:43,280
I'm like a little fetus.

6469
04:45:43,280 --> 04:45:44,080
Where am I?

6470
04:45:44,400 --> 04:45:46,320
Wait a minute.

6471
04:45:53,900 --> 04:45:54,420
Obsession.

6472
04:45:54,920 --> 04:46:00,820
A remnant worldly ties and transforms the unfinished aspirations into spaces both tangible and ethereal.

6473
04:46:01,380 --> 04:46:02,640
Real and illusionary.

6474
04:46:02,700 --> 04:46:04,800
Through certain objects, one can navigate these spaces.

6475
04:46:05,780 --> 04:46:07,340
It all comes back to rock.

6476
04:46:07,440 --> 04:46:08,280
It's where I was born!

6477
04:46:14,350 --> 04:46:16,930
Wait, what are you doing in my fucking egg fetus?

6478
04:46:17,550 --> 04:46:18,070
Wait, what are you doing in my fucking egg fetus?

6479
04:46:18,630 --> 04:46:19,350
In my yolk!

6480
04:46:20,450 --> 04:46:21,990
What is he doing in my yolk?

6481
04:46:22,750 --> 04:46:23,010
Hm.

6482
04:46:23,630 --> 04:46:24,130
I'm here.

6483
04:46:24,450 --> 04:46:25,470
Get on the boat.

6484
04:46:27,330 --> 04:46:28,630
I say, old man.

6485
04:46:28,830 --> 04:46:32,210
If you get on this boat, you won't be able to turn back, right?

6486
04:46:36,910 --> 04:46:39,130
There's no such thing as a boat in this world.

6487
04:46:39,790 --> 04:46:43,970
If you don't get on my boat, do you think you'll be able to turn back?

6488
04:46:45,150 --> 04:46:46,470
Oh, that's deep.

6489
04:46:47,130 --> 04:46:48,310
That's very deep.

6490
04:46:51,250 --> 04:46:52,850
Back into the rock.

6491
04:46:52,890 --> 04:46:54,550
Back into the rock.

6492
04:46:54,550 --> 04:46:55,530
Thank you for the super chat.

6493
04:46:55,670 --> 04:46:55,930
Thank you.

6494
04:46:56,630 --> 04:46:57,150
Guys,

6495
04:47:05,060 --> 04:47:05,660
you can tell...

6496
04:47:06,280 --> 04:47:09,980
You can tell the graphics quality is hitting that old monkey hard right now.

6497
04:47:12,820 --> 04:47:18,600
You can tell it's hitting him really hard.

6498
04:47:24,220 --> 04:47:25,620
That's me!

6499
04:47:27,040 --> 04:47:28,320
That's me.

6500
04:47:28,320 --> 04:47:29,080
Wait, why am I naked?

6501
04:47:42,780 --> 04:47:45,340
That's me.

6502
04:47:45,580 --> 04:47:46,540
That's me.

6503
04:47:46,560 --> 04:47:51,120
That's me.

6504
04:47:51,120 --> 04:47:53,700
Kings don't get... no, non-kings don't get clothes.

6505
04:48:01,640 --> 04:48:03,760
They were killing the other monkeys!

6506
04:48:07,060 --> 04:48:09,560
Yeah, because they discriminated me!

6507
04:48:11,700 --> 04:48:12,940
What the fuck?

6508
04:48:14,160 --> 04:48:14,760
What?

6509
04:48:18,760 --> 04:48:21,500
You're either king and clothed or not and naked.

6510
04:48:28,460 --> 04:48:29,940
What the fuck?

6511
04:48:29,940 --> 04:48:30,740
You're a monkey too!

6512
04:48:31,140 --> 04:48:33,340
You should be fighting for my monkey rights!

6513
04:48:35,840 --> 04:48:38,200
You wanna be treated like trash?

6514
04:48:40,340 --> 04:48:42,080
He just said we're like rats!

6515
04:48:49,080 --> 04:48:51,900
Can't believe he compared us to rats!

6516
04:49:01,400 --> 04:49:08,080
Can't believe he compared us to rats!

6517
04:49:08,080 --> 04:49:12,920
Can't believe he compared us to rats!

6518
04:49:16,160 --> 04:49:17,480
This part is a lot of narration.

6519
04:49:17,880 --> 04:49:20,140
Are you only reading the syllabus or do you understand them?

6520
04:49:20,180 --> 04:49:24,780
I can understand a bit of it, but then they get like super poetic or like super deep.

6521
04:49:24,860 --> 04:49:30,600
Like the way some of the dialogue is like really complicated that I don't know the words of.

6522
04:49:31,700 --> 04:49:32,840
Thank you for the super chat!

6523
04:49:32,960 --> 04:49:33,280
Thank you!

6524
04:49:33,540 --> 04:49:33,980
Thank you!

6525
04:49:34,420 --> 04:49:36,660
I really appreciate it.

6526
04:49:42,300 --> 04:49:43,420
You're welcome!

6527
04:49:43,420 --> 04:49:45,880
Like when they get like... There's like some old...

6528
04:49:45,880 --> 04:49:50,680
Some like... like what's the word?

6529
04:49:51,000 --> 04:49:52,800
Like there's some words I don't know.

6530
04:49:57,420 --> 04:49:59,980
Yeah that's the double meanings and metaphors.

6531
04:50:00,000 --> 04:50:00,240
Yeah.

6532
04:50:00,580 --> 04:50:02,340
Why's the monkey so bright?

6533
04:50:02,620 --> 04:50:03,180
Um...

6534
04:50:07,060 --> 04:50:08,520
Why am I lagging?

6535
04:50:36,660 --> 04:50:37,020
My good friend.

6536
04:50:37,700 --> 04:50:38,900
My good friend?

6537
04:50:39,700 --> 04:50:40,260
Who?

6538
04:50:43,980 --> 04:50:45,640
Yeah, but most of them are dead.

6539
04:50:45,900 --> 04:50:47,100
Why is that?

6540
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:54,120
Yeah, same.

6541
04:50:54,720 --> 04:50:56,360
Most of my friends are fucking dead.

6542
04:50:58,840 --> 04:50:59,900
Yeah, where are they?

6543
04:50:59,940 --> 04:51:00,860
Who killed them?

6544
04:51:03,280 --> 04:51:06,080
I wonder who fucking killed them.

6545
04:51:06,660 --> 04:51:10,560
I wonder who fucking killed them.

6546
04:51:20,640 --> 04:51:27,900
Why the fuck is that tree monkey?

6547
04:52:19,990 --> 04:52:20,630
Why the fuck is that tree monkey?

6548
04:52:20,630 --> 04:52:20,950
Are we here?

6549
04:52:21,050 --> 04:52:21,870
Are we there yet?

6550
04:52:26,790 --> 04:52:28,430
What the fuck?

6551
04:52:30,390 --> 04:52:31,410
What is this paradox?

6552
04:52:35,510 --> 04:52:37,030
Wait, what the fuck?

6553
04:52:37,270 --> 04:52:38,530
Wait, what the fuck?

6554
04:52:38,610 --> 04:52:40,150
Oh, that's me.

6555
04:52:43,290 --> 04:52:44,810
You're mine.

6556
04:52:45,590 --> 04:52:46,170
Yeah.

6557
04:52:47,570 --> 04:52:48,530
That's me.

6558
04:52:48,570 --> 04:52:49,610
That has to be me, right?

6559
04:52:57,750 --> 04:52:58,950
I'm the mine.

6560
04:52:58,970 --> 04:53:00,030
It's me, isn't it?

6561
04:53:00,270 --> 04:53:03,230
It's not me.

6562
04:53:06,430 --> 04:53:07,370
It's him.

6563
04:53:08,650 --> 04:53:12,630
Bro, just because he's old doesn't mean he's wise.

6564
04:53:13,990 --> 04:53:14,530
Bro, just because he's old doesn't mean he's wise.

6565
04:53:15,470 --> 04:53:16,350
I'm literally...

6566
04:53:16,350 --> 04:53:17,510
I told you, I'm him.

6567
04:53:18,010 --> 04:53:20,850
I like how he thought it was the older monkey just because he's old.

6568
04:53:21,470 --> 04:53:22,950
I like how he thought it was the older monkey just because he's old.

6569
04:53:25,050 --> 04:53:26,310
Bro, I'm right here.

6570
04:53:26,430 --> 04:53:27,890
Like, I literally look like him.

6571
04:53:29,570 --> 04:53:31,990
Like, I'm just like...

6572
04:53:31,990 --> 04:53:35,270
I literally look like him and he was like, Oh, it's the old monkey.

6573
04:53:37,750 --> 04:53:39,350
Like, that's so fucked.

6574
04:53:39,350 --> 04:53:39,650
Yeah, but I'm here.

6575
04:53:39,650 --> 04:53:40,130
you fucked.

6576
04:53:40,130 --> 04:53:41,010
He Club.

6577
04:53:41,150 --> 04:53:41,410
He Club.

6578
04:53:41,410 --> 04:53:42,310
he Club.

6579
04:53:46,770 --> 04:53:48,410
he club.

6580
04:53:48,730 --> 04:53:50,470
He was fucked.

6581
04:53:50,470 --> 04:53:52,670
heチャンネル Emil waves He was fucked.

6582
04:53:52,670 --> 04:54:01,790
gor richie How beautiful.

6583
04:54:04,170 --> 04:54:05,730
He's bright.

6584
04:54:05,990 --> 04:54:09,330
I was too young for that.

6585
04:54:15,970 --> 04:54:19,410
I mean, he's like 8 times immortal.

6586
04:54:21,210 --> 04:54:23,850
So I'm like basically the reincarnation of him.

6587
04:54:29,570 --> 04:54:33,210
I never even had a name!

6588
04:54:37,070 --> 04:54:40,390
Bro, even though I'm like his reincarnation...

6589
04:54:40,390 --> 04:54:45,650
He could at least give me a name.

6590
04:54:47,050 --> 04:54:48,870
I'm just a monkey.

6591
04:54:53,290 --> 04:54:55,270
I didn't even look like him!

6592
04:54:55,550 --> 04:54:56,190
He's dead!

6593
04:54:57,350 --> 04:55:00,130
Bro, okay, the side play is like, he's long gone.

6594
04:55:00,350 --> 04:55:02,510
He was like, he's fucking dead!

6595
04:55:03,210 --> 04:55:05,970
Fuck, I like that so fucked up!

6596
04:55:06,870 --> 04:55:07,470
Bro!

6597
04:55:08,030 --> 04:55:12,290
Like, the whole monkey was like, he's fucking dead!

6598
04:55:16,450 --> 04:55:20,190
I like how the subtitle was like, bro, he's god.

6599
04:55:24,970 --> 04:55:28,210
What he actually said was so much more mean.

6600
04:55:31,030 --> 04:55:33,610
It was so mean.

6601
04:55:35,780 --> 04:55:37,410
You gotta let go.

6602
04:55:39,870 --> 04:55:40,810
He's dead.

6603
04:55:47,050 --> 04:55:49,630
Bro, he's hella dead.

6604
04:55:51,130 --> 04:55:52,550
Bro, he's hella dead.

6605
04:55:52,550 --> 04:55:52,830
Bro, he's hella dead.

6606
04:55:52,830 --> 04:55:55,470
Bro, he's hella dead.

6607
04:56:01,190 --> 04:56:01,730
Yeah, he's dead.

6608
04:56:01,730 --> 04:56:04,510
Wait, what is he then, if I'm the mind, is that the body?

6609
04:56:08,910 --> 04:56:11,890
Yeah, that's the body, it got merged with him.

6610
04:56:19,490 --> 04:56:22,110
Why the fuck we needed a boat!

6611
04:56:22,470 --> 04:56:22,930
Hahaha!

6612
04:56:29,270 --> 04:56:31,850
We couldn't walk blocked.

6613
04:56:32,710 --> 04:56:39,810
Yeah, it's another test.

6614
04:56:39,990 --> 04:56:40,970
Another test?

6615
04:56:43,770 --> 04:56:46,490
Underwater was deeply...

6616
04:56:48,570 --> 04:56:52,110
We put a barrier?

6617
04:56:53,010 --> 04:56:58,160
We put a barrier?

6618
04:56:58,160 --> 04:56:59,380
I'm literally him!

6619
04:57:06,610 --> 04:57:08,290
The final test.

6620
04:57:14,390 --> 04:57:16,370
This is my destiny.

6621
04:57:18,110 --> 04:57:19,590
Oh god, okay.

6622
04:57:19,790 --> 04:57:20,270
That's fine.

6623
04:57:20,610 --> 04:57:22,390
I forgot to use my abilities.

6624
04:57:22,630 --> 04:57:23,550
Okay, this is not fine.

6625
04:57:25,070 --> 04:57:28,470
Guys, I already forgot to use my abilities.

6626
04:57:30,170 --> 04:57:33,630
I can't believe I already forgot to use my abilities.

6627
04:57:33,990 --> 04:57:34,670
Whoops.

6628
04:57:35,550 --> 04:57:36,590
That's awkward.

6629
04:57:38,150 --> 04:57:39,670
I forgot they existed.

6630
04:57:42,470 --> 04:57:44,450
I forgot my abilities.

6631
04:57:44,770 --> 04:57:45,910
I forgot my...

6632
04:57:45,910 --> 04:57:47,390
What the fuck?

6633
04:57:48,110 --> 04:57:48,790
Okay.

6634
04:57:49,310 --> 04:57:50,930
What the fuck?

6635
04:57:50,990 --> 04:57:51,670
Okay.

6636
04:57:52,230 --> 04:57:52,910
Okay.

6637
04:57:53,750 --> 04:57:54,610
It's fine.

6638
04:57:57,490 --> 04:57:58,470
What is he doing?

6639
04:57:58,490 --> 04:58:01,130
Okay, I need to jump more.

6640
04:58:02,690 --> 04:58:03,170
Okay.

6641
04:58:03,510 --> 04:58:04,130
It's fine.

6642
04:58:04,810 --> 04:58:05,970
Oh, that's not fine.

6643
04:58:06,470 --> 04:58:07,890
I don't know his stuff.

6644
04:58:08,230 --> 04:58:09,690
Oh, I don't know what...

6645
04:58:10,270 --> 04:58:10,750
Please.

6646
04:58:12,050 --> 04:58:14,250
I don't know what he's doing sometimes.

6647
04:58:15,670 --> 04:58:16,470
Oh, fuck.

6648
04:58:16,510 --> 04:58:16,730
No!

6649
04:58:17,310 --> 04:58:17,790
What?

6650
04:58:23,140 --> 04:58:24,000
What is that?

6651
04:58:24,020 --> 04:58:25,820
Okay, I tried to jump, guys.

6652
04:58:25,860 --> 04:58:27,300
But it didn't work.

6653
04:58:27,300 --> 04:58:29,480
No, it did not work.

6654
04:58:29,680 --> 04:58:31,520
Oh, my God.

6655
04:58:31,580 --> 04:58:33,180
I swear to God, guys.

6656
04:58:34,000 --> 04:58:35,420
I tried to jump.

6657
04:58:40,310 --> 04:58:41,690
You are him.

6658
04:58:41,690 --> 04:58:42,550
Just win.

6659
04:58:45,330 --> 04:58:46,630
Wait, now he's...

6660
04:58:46,630 --> 04:58:48,270
Now he's rock monkey?

6661
04:58:48,750 --> 04:58:49,390
Okay.

6662
04:58:49,850 --> 04:58:52,770
Oh, okay.

6663
04:58:52,870 --> 04:58:54,690
I don't reset my thing.

6664
04:58:54,850 --> 04:58:56,890
That's very good to know.

6665
04:58:56,890 --> 04:58:57,750
Okay, now that...

6666
04:58:58,790 --> 04:58:59,330
All right.

6667
04:59:03,450 --> 04:59:04,390
Oh, my God.

6668
04:59:04,410 --> 04:59:05,510
I didn't get the timing for that.

6669
04:59:05,710 --> 04:59:06,070
No!

6670
04:59:06,390 --> 04:59:06,750
No!

6671
04:59:07,450 --> 04:59:07,810
Okay.

6672
04:59:17,480 --> 04:59:18,060
All right.

6673
04:59:18,200 --> 04:59:18,580
It's fine.

6674
04:59:21,360 --> 04:59:22,220
Okay, that's good.

6675
04:59:22,260 --> 04:59:23,120
I got the timing for that.

6676
04:59:25,300 --> 04:59:25,660
Even...

6677
04:59:25,660 --> 04:59:26,060
No!

6678
04:59:28,420 --> 04:59:29,820
Oh, he's picking up a rock!

6679
04:59:36,270 --> 04:59:36,990
Every time.

6680
04:59:39,690 --> 04:59:40,550
Come on.

6681
04:59:40,550 --> 04:59:40,710
Come on.

6682
04:59:40,710 --> 04:59:42,430
Use my giant ability!

6683
04:59:43,970 --> 04:59:44,770
There's two!

6684
04:59:47,450 --> 04:59:48,450
That's not fair!

6685
04:59:53,490 --> 04:59:54,990
That's so not fair, bro.

6686
04:59:56,030 --> 04:59:56,710
No!

6687
04:59:56,710 --> 04:59:57,010
Bro!

6688
04:59:57,110 --> 04:59:57,490
Bro!

6689
04:59:57,490 --> 04:59:57,750
Bro!

6690
04:59:57,830 --> 04:59:58,070
Bro!

6691
04:59:59,890 --> 05:00:01,250
Oh, no!

6692
05:00:02,510 --> 05:00:03,190
Damn!

6693
05:00:03,490 --> 05:00:03,830
Fuck!

6694
05:00:03,970 --> 05:00:04,650
Damn!

6695
05:00:07,390 --> 05:00:08,070
Okay.

6696
05:00:08,070 --> 05:00:08,750
Okay.

6697
05:00:09,750 --> 05:00:11,190
Oh, I need to figure out how to do the jumps.

6698
05:00:11,350 --> 05:00:12,610
No first try, guys.

6699
05:00:15,470 --> 05:00:17,170
Two is a bit too much.

6700
05:00:17,170 --> 05:00:18,550
Two is a bit...

6701
05:00:19,210 --> 05:00:19,650
Okay.

6702
05:00:19,850 --> 05:00:20,250
Okay.

6703
05:00:20,290 --> 05:00:21,750
Oh, now we have the shrine.

6704
05:00:23,910 --> 05:00:24,550
All right.

6705
05:00:25,190 --> 05:00:25,630
Two...

6706
05:00:27,990 --> 05:00:29,470
Monkey to get a shrine.

6707
05:00:29,550 --> 05:00:30,150
Where did they go?

6708
05:00:30,550 --> 05:00:31,450
Wait, they left!

6709
05:00:33,130 --> 05:00:33,570
Wait!

6710
05:00:33,650 --> 05:00:34,270
They left!

6711
05:00:38,500 --> 05:00:39,180
That's right!

6712
05:00:39,180 --> 05:00:41,180
Monkey versus monkey!

6713
05:00:41,740 --> 05:00:42,680
That's right!

6714
05:00:42,960 --> 05:00:45,520
Monkey versus monkey time!

6715
05:00:46,660 --> 05:00:47,580
If you...

6716
05:00:47,580 --> 05:00:49,180
Oh, now it's my turn!

6717
05:00:49,220 --> 05:00:50,300
You have two monkeys!

6718
05:00:51,100 --> 05:00:52,160
That's right!

6719
05:00:52,240 --> 05:00:53,480
It's my turn!

6720
05:00:54,080 --> 05:00:56,080
It's fucking my turn!

6721
05:00:56,400 --> 05:00:57,400
That's right!

6722
05:01:00,200 --> 05:01:01,200
My turn!

6723
05:01:01,260 --> 05:01:02,080
You have two monkeys!

6724
05:01:02,860 --> 05:01:04,880
I'm just gonna wait for my other monkey to hit him more.

6725
05:01:05,320 --> 05:01:06,720
Might as well.

6726
05:01:06,720 --> 05:01:06,960
Oh, no.

6727
05:01:12,690 --> 05:01:13,730
Fuck it.

6728
05:01:13,730 --> 05:01:14,650
I'm just gonna beat him up.

6729
05:01:18,950 --> 05:01:19,470
Baby!

6730
05:01:21,630 --> 05:01:22,150
Fed!

6731
05:01:24,630 --> 05:01:25,150
Nice.

6732
05:01:25,630 --> 05:01:26,890
And now...

6733
05:01:27,770 --> 05:01:29,170
Now I have this.

6734
05:01:29,410 --> 05:01:30,350
That's right.

6735
05:01:31,070 --> 05:01:32,550
I got the pattern!

6736
05:01:35,890 --> 05:01:38,250
I got the pattern going in!

6737
05:01:40,350 --> 05:01:41,890
Okay, now I can't...

6738
05:01:41,890 --> 05:01:42,830
I don't have anything else now.

6739
05:01:42,990 --> 05:01:44,430
I don't have it.

6740
05:01:44,970 --> 05:01:46,730
I got first phase is easy.

6741
05:01:47,790 --> 05:01:50,270
I don't know how many phases this monkey has.

6742
05:01:50,590 --> 05:01:52,170
But I assume it's a lot.

6743
05:01:53,110 --> 05:01:53,630
Woo!

6744
05:01:54,970 --> 05:01:55,490
Woo!

6745
05:01:56,790 --> 05:01:57,250
Woo!

6746
05:01:58,930 --> 05:01:59,450
Woo!

6747
05:01:59,550 --> 05:02:01,250
No, I mistimed that.

6748
05:02:01,350 --> 05:02:02,570
No, I mistimed that!

6749
05:02:04,090 --> 05:02:04,850
Oh, god.

6750
05:02:05,050 --> 05:02:05,530
Okay.

6751
05:02:06,390 --> 05:02:08,230
This phase is weird.

6752
05:02:08,950 --> 05:02:10,510
It's very weird, guys.

6753
05:02:10,630 --> 05:02:11,510
It's so weird.

6754
05:02:11,750 --> 05:02:12,650
I don't know.

6755
05:02:15,930 --> 05:02:16,870
Oh, god.

6756
05:02:16,930 --> 05:02:18,750
I'm just gonna let him do that thing.

6757
05:02:20,130 --> 05:02:20,690
Nice.

6758
05:02:20,710 --> 05:02:20,950
Okay.

6759
05:02:21,210 --> 05:02:21,950
That's fine.

6760
05:02:22,750 --> 05:02:23,310
No!

6761
05:02:23,510 --> 05:02:24,230
It's not fine!

6762
05:02:26,350 --> 05:02:27,830
Guys, it was not fine.

6763
05:02:27,910 --> 05:02:28,210
JK.

6764
05:02:31,490 --> 05:02:32,050
What?

6765
05:02:32,350 --> 05:02:34,130
That was behind you!

6766
05:02:35,530 --> 05:02:36,870
He was literally behind you!

6767
05:02:38,030 --> 05:02:38,830
That's fucked.

6768
05:02:39,850 --> 05:02:40,670
Oh, no!

6769
05:02:40,750 --> 05:02:41,950
He did rock parry!

6770
05:02:42,210 --> 05:02:43,270
How did you do...

6771
05:02:43,270 --> 05:02:43,450
No!

6772
05:02:43,570 --> 05:02:44,750
He grabbed me!

6773
05:02:45,050 --> 05:02:45,530
No!

6774
05:02:49,470 --> 05:02:50,290
Teleporting rock!

6775
05:02:51,090 --> 05:02:51,610
Please!

6776
05:02:53,270 --> 05:02:54,910
I'm just trying to...

6777
05:02:54,910 --> 05:02:55,690
What?

6778
05:02:56,830 --> 05:02:57,350
No!

6779
05:02:58,070 --> 05:02:58,830
Oh, no!

6780
05:02:58,890 --> 05:02:59,810
I didn't mean to do that!

6781
05:02:59,990 --> 05:03:00,610
Oh, whatever.

6782
05:03:00,890 --> 05:03:01,370
It's fine.

6783
05:03:04,010 --> 05:03:05,090
We're here anyway.

6784
05:03:08,230 --> 05:03:10,410
We might as well be here.

6785
05:03:10,550 --> 05:03:10,870
We might as well be here.

6786
05:03:12,890 --> 05:03:13,850
Oh, god.

6787
05:03:13,950 --> 05:03:14,150
No!

6788
05:03:15,970 --> 05:03:16,770
Oh, god.

6789
05:03:17,950 --> 05:03:19,050
Oh, shit!

6790
05:03:19,210 --> 05:03:19,650
Okay.

6791
05:03:20,050 --> 05:03:20,750
That's fine.

6792
05:03:21,730 --> 05:03:22,430
That's fine.

6793
05:03:25,850 --> 05:03:26,850
I'm just gonna...

6794
05:03:27,530 --> 05:03:28,070
I'm just gonna...

6795
05:03:29,750 --> 05:03:30,670
Oh, it's gonna...

6796
05:03:30,670 --> 05:03:31,270
What?

6797
05:03:31,830 --> 05:03:33,130
Where did he go?

6798
05:03:33,470 --> 05:03:33,950
What?

6799
05:03:37,570 --> 05:03:38,710
I hate this.

6800
05:03:38,750 --> 05:03:39,650
I hate two.

6801
05:03:40,070 --> 05:03:41,150
I hate two.

6802
05:03:41,570 --> 05:03:43,530
Two is fucking me up, guys.

6803
05:03:47,790 --> 05:03:49,350
Two is way too many.

6804
05:03:51,690 --> 05:03:52,210
No.

6805
05:03:52,550 --> 05:03:53,470
Oh, thank god.

6806
05:03:57,090 --> 05:03:57,610
Okay.

6807
05:03:57,610 --> 05:03:58,330
That's fine.

6808
05:03:58,990 --> 05:03:59,910
That's not fine.

6809
05:04:00,290 --> 05:04:02,470
Guys, it's not fine.

6810
05:04:02,470 --> 05:04:04,770
It's actually not fine, guys.

6811
05:04:07,670 --> 05:04:08,810
Oh, thank god.

6812
05:04:08,850 --> 05:04:09,250
It's one.

6813
05:04:09,590 --> 05:04:10,850
One monkey now.

6814
05:04:14,240 --> 05:04:15,130
Oh, thank god.

6815
05:04:15,150 --> 05:04:16,230
It's one monkey now.

6816
05:04:17,730 --> 05:04:19,290
That's not fair!

6817
05:04:22,410 --> 05:04:23,570
That's actually...

6818
05:04:23,570 --> 05:04:24,110
No!

6819
05:04:25,810 --> 05:04:26,970
You cheater!

6820
05:04:30,130 --> 05:04:30,610
What?

6821
05:04:31,990 --> 05:04:33,310
How did he know?

6822
05:04:35,590 --> 05:04:37,090
Oh, fucking hell.

6823
05:04:37,310 --> 05:04:38,890
Why can't I do that?

6824
05:04:38,970 --> 05:04:40,910
If I'm him, I should be able to do all of that.

6825
05:04:41,950 --> 05:04:43,250
Like, not gonna lie.

6826
05:04:44,110 --> 05:04:49,150
All I'm saying is that if I'm supposed to be him, All I'm saying is that if I'm supposed to be him, I should be allowed to do...

6827
05:04:49,150 --> 05:04:50,150
Oh, my god.

6828
05:04:50,170 --> 05:04:52,010
I should be allowed to do all of this.

6829
05:04:52,190 --> 05:04:53,330
Oh, my god.

6830
05:04:53,330 --> 05:04:53,490
I should be allowed to do all of this.

6831
05:04:53,490 --> 05:04:54,710
You're not him.

6832
05:04:55,590 --> 05:04:56,110
But...

6833
05:04:56,590 --> 05:04:58,470
He literally said I am!

6834
05:04:58,850 --> 05:05:01,990
Are you trying to tell me the old man was lying?

6835
05:05:02,930 --> 05:05:04,350
There's no way he's old.

6836
05:05:04,450 --> 05:05:05,410
He can't lie to me.

6837
05:05:05,710 --> 05:05:07,270
He's supposed to be wise.

6838
05:05:07,910 --> 05:05:08,430
Jeez.

6839
05:05:11,710 --> 05:05:14,170
Oh, I hate this guy so much.

6840
05:05:14,270 --> 05:05:14,910
I hate him.

6841
05:05:18,210 --> 05:05:19,110
Oh, god.

6842
05:05:19,230 --> 05:05:20,190
Okay, I dodged it.

6843
05:05:21,730 --> 05:05:23,750
Oh, I didn't dodge that, though.

6844
05:05:24,110 --> 05:05:24,610
I...

6845
05:05:24,610 --> 05:05:25,490
Oh,

6846
05:05:29,630 --> 05:05:30,270
I accidentally dragged two.

6847
05:05:30,350 --> 05:05:30,550
No.

6848
05:05:31,210 --> 05:05:31,710
No.

6849
05:05:34,950 --> 05:05:36,070
Are you serious?

6850
05:05:36,290 --> 05:05:37,030
Are you serious?

6851
05:05:37,170 --> 05:05:37,630
Oh, he missed.

6852
05:05:37,770 --> 05:05:39,390
He grabs twice!

6853
05:05:39,650 --> 05:05:41,030
He grabs twice!

6854
05:05:43,970 --> 05:05:45,850
The Celestial Court hates you!

6855
05:05:45,990 --> 05:05:47,110
I hate me too!

6856
05:05:50,630 --> 05:05:51,630
No wonder...

6857
05:05:52,710 --> 05:05:53,070
I don't know why.

6858
05:05:56,350 --> 05:05:57,530
Now I know.

6859
05:05:58,550 --> 05:05:59,350
Please!

6860
05:05:59,410 --> 05:05:59,770
Oh!

6861
05:05:59,970 --> 05:06:01,290
Phase three.

6862
05:06:01,470 --> 05:06:03,230
Phase fucking three.

6863
05:06:17,210 --> 05:06:20,170
Because he is the grappler.

6864
05:06:24,500 --> 05:06:25,720
Did I do it?

6865
05:06:25,820 --> 05:06:27,140
My stick!

6866
05:06:28,580 --> 05:06:29,140
That's right.

6867
05:06:32,060 --> 05:06:32,520
Nice!

6868
05:06:34,680 --> 05:06:35,380
I'm him.

6869
05:06:36,800 --> 05:06:38,440
You might have more experience.

6870
05:06:38,820 --> 05:06:40,380
But I'm basically you.

6871
05:06:42,220 --> 05:06:43,140
Oh, shit.

6872
05:06:52,660 --> 05:06:54,540
Wait, I didn't even have to take off my hair.

6873
05:07:00,070 --> 05:07:00,670
That's right.

6874
05:07:02,630 --> 05:07:05,090
I don't even need to pluck my hair now.

6875
05:07:07,510 --> 05:07:07,970
Oh!

6876
05:07:14,740 --> 05:07:15,860
Oh, shit!

6877
05:07:20,190 --> 05:07:21,130
That's right.

6878
05:07:22,110 --> 05:07:23,090
I'm you.

6879
05:07:23,250 --> 05:07:25,170
I'm the better version of you.

6880
05:07:25,370 --> 05:07:27,130
I'm iPhone 15.

6881
05:07:27,150 --> 05:07:29,170
And you're iPhone 14.

6882
05:07:29,330 --> 05:07:31,550
What number iPhone we are on now?

6883
05:07:34,710 --> 05:07:36,730
I come in pink now.

6884
05:07:37,570 --> 05:07:38,730
We're on 16.

6885
05:07:38,830 --> 05:07:39,110
Sorry.

6886
05:07:39,350 --> 05:07:39,910
Whoa!

6887
05:07:40,070 --> 05:07:40,530
Wait!

6888
05:07:40,650 --> 05:07:41,370
You're me!

6889
05:07:43,450 --> 05:07:45,130
That's iPhone 16.

6890
05:07:46,130 --> 05:07:47,430
Oh, no!

6891
05:07:47,570 --> 05:07:49,790
The iPhone 16 just came out!

6892
05:07:50,150 --> 05:07:50,630
No!

6893
05:07:52,810 --> 05:07:53,310
No!

6894
05:07:54,970 --> 05:07:57,090
That's iPhone 16!

6895
05:07:57,470 --> 05:07:58,810
I'm 16!

6896
05:08:00,830 --> 05:08:01,710
Nice!

6897
05:08:01,810 --> 05:08:02,690
Oh,

6898
05:08:06,550 --> 05:08:06,910
no!

6899
05:08:11,300 --> 05:08:13,300
My own moveset!

6900
05:08:13,300 --> 05:08:14,360
You know I have not.

6901
05:08:14,680 --> 05:08:17,480
You know I have not mastered my own movesets, guys.

6902
05:08:19,100 --> 05:08:20,160
Guys, no!

6903
05:08:20,340 --> 05:08:22,680
He is iPhone 16!

6904
05:08:23,260 --> 05:08:24,220
He's spinning!

6905
05:08:27,900 --> 05:08:28,860
Holy shit!

6906
05:08:29,600 --> 05:08:30,560
He's spinning!

6907
05:08:30,640 --> 05:08:32,000
He actually knows how to spin!

6908
05:08:37,740 --> 05:08:38,900
He dodged too!

6909
05:08:39,820 --> 05:08:40,200
Oh, my God!

6910
05:08:40,220 --> 05:08:41,300
He's thrusting!

6911
05:08:44,360 --> 05:08:45,380
Oh, my God!

6912
05:08:45,800 --> 05:08:46,880
Oh, my God!

6913
05:08:47,000 --> 05:08:47,440
Oh, my God!

6914
05:08:47,440 --> 05:08:48,680
He has so many combos!

6915
05:08:49,020 --> 05:08:51,340
I didn't know they existed until now!

6916
05:08:52,700 --> 05:08:53,540
So many!

6917
05:08:53,820 --> 05:08:56,220
I haven't seen some of these combos before!

6918
05:08:56,560 --> 05:08:57,040
I haven't seen some of these combos before!

6919
05:08:57,040 --> 05:08:57,660
Not gonna lie!

6920
05:08:59,820 --> 05:09:02,020
Some of these combos, I didn't even know they existed!

6921
05:09:05,800 --> 05:09:06,640
Oh, my God!

6922
05:09:09,760 --> 05:09:10,540
Oh, shit!

6923
05:09:10,620 --> 05:09:11,280
Okay, I dodged it.

6924
05:09:11,300 --> 05:09:11,740
Just in time.

6925
05:09:12,980 --> 05:09:13,540
Oh!

6926
05:09:15,360 --> 05:09:17,120
I'm gonna full heal, just in case.

6927
05:09:17,140 --> 05:09:18,080
Like, I don't trust myself.

6928
05:09:18,340 --> 05:09:18,780
Not gonna lie.

6929
05:09:19,580 --> 05:09:21,320
What the fuck?!

6930
05:09:22,880 --> 05:09:24,220
That's actually cheating!

6931
05:09:24,560 --> 05:09:25,860
Holy shit!

6932
05:09:27,160 --> 05:09:29,780
Did he actually cheat with that?

6933
05:09:29,860 --> 05:09:30,740
Oh, my God!

6934
05:09:31,120 --> 05:09:32,240
That's crazy!

6935
05:09:35,880 --> 05:09:36,700
Full healing.

6936
05:09:36,860 --> 05:09:37,500
Just in case.

6937
05:09:37,720 --> 05:09:39,400
I don't trust myself.

6938
05:09:39,800 --> 05:09:41,080
Guys, you don't understand.

6939
05:09:41,200 --> 05:09:42,420
I don't trust myself.

6940
05:09:45,140 --> 05:09:46,060
I don't trust myself.

6941
05:09:46,060 --> 05:09:47,820
He is iPhone syrup.

6942
05:09:51,380 --> 05:09:53,380
Wait, Phase 4?!

6943
05:09:53,380 --> 05:09:54,780
I fucking full...

6944
05:09:54,780 --> 05:09:56,980
I deceased!

6945
05:09:57,320 --> 05:09:58,100
I crashed!

6946
05:09:58,980 --> 05:10:05,080
I actually crashed!

6947
05:10:05,400 --> 05:10:11,200
I saw Phase 4, and I was gone.

6948
05:10:11,200 --> 05:10:13,740
I thought I was fucking gone.

6949
05:10:14,820 --> 05:10:28,880
I thought I was supposed to be the soul.

6950
05:10:29,880 --> 05:10:31,260
Let's give me a sec guys.

6951
05:10:31,380 --> 05:10:34,260
Oh please don't fucking fight yet.

6952
05:10:34,340 --> 05:10:35,800
I'm trying to get back in.

6953
05:10:39,730 --> 05:10:40,570
Oh no.

6954
05:10:41,050 --> 05:10:42,050
I'm back in.

6955
05:10:42,350 --> 05:10:43,250
I'm back in.

6956
05:10:44,510 --> 05:10:47,090
I think I should be back in.

6957
05:10:47,190 --> 05:10:48,490
Wait why am I not out there yet?

6958
05:10:49,170 --> 05:10:49,910
Wait what?

6959
05:10:52,510 --> 05:10:54,970
He's at 17 left.

6960
05:10:55,490 --> 05:10:57,090
What the fuck?

6961
05:10:59,710 --> 05:11:01,210
Wait he's being cocky.

6962
05:11:03,470 --> 05:11:05,530
Did he get back his memories too?

6963
05:11:06,110 --> 05:11:07,590
Like did you absorb me?

6964
05:11:08,510 --> 05:11:10,070
I was supposed to absorb you.

6965
05:11:10,270 --> 05:11:11,610
That's not how it's supposed to go.

6966
05:11:14,730 --> 05:11:16,890
I said I was supposed to absorb you.

6967
05:11:18,570 --> 05:11:19,770
No that's right.

6968
05:11:19,870 --> 05:11:22,630
You thought you might know how to parry.

6969
05:11:22,990 --> 05:11:24,110
Oh shit.

6970
05:11:24,230 --> 05:11:25,190
Okay and that too.

6971
05:11:25,310 --> 05:11:27,670
Wait I can't do the other stances anymore.

6972
05:11:28,750 --> 05:11:30,510
He took it away from me.

6973
05:11:31,050 --> 05:11:32,750
Oh shit ring of fire.

6974
05:11:32,950 --> 05:11:34,690
I've never seen that before.

6975
05:11:37,910 --> 05:11:38,430
Guys.

6976
05:11:38,430 --> 05:11:40,110
He's using ring of fire.

6977
05:11:40,110 --> 05:11:41,810
We've never seen.

6978
05:11:41,830 --> 05:11:43,330
No we cannot let him pluck.

6979
05:11:43,550 --> 05:11:45,470
We cannot let him pluck guys.

6980
05:11:47,290 --> 05:11:49,370
Does that move exist?

6981
05:11:50,810 --> 05:11:54,030
What are these moves that he's doing?

6982
05:11:55,820 --> 05:11:57,550
Does that thing exist?

6983
05:12:01,070 --> 05:12:02,110
Okay nice.

6984
05:12:04,970 --> 05:12:05,710
No!

6985
05:12:06,030 --> 05:12:06,750
How did you?

6986
05:12:06,750 --> 05:12:07,250
Okay.

6987
05:12:10,110 --> 05:12:11,070
That's actually bullshit.

6988
05:12:11,390 --> 05:12:12,450
Not gonna lie.

6989
05:12:13,150 --> 05:12:14,810
Oh my god.

6990
05:12:18,210 --> 05:12:19,550
Oh I'm dead.

6991
05:12:19,730 --> 05:12:20,870
I don't have guys.

6992
05:12:22,910 --> 05:12:24,310
Oh goodbye.

6993
05:12:24,730 --> 05:12:25,650
What if I just.

6994
05:12:25,730 --> 05:12:26,990
Goodbye everybody.

6995
05:12:27,310 --> 05:12:28,230
Phase 4.

6996
05:12:35,590 --> 05:12:38,110
He stole my focus.

6997
05:12:40,490 --> 05:12:41,850
Oh my god.

6998
05:12:42,230 --> 05:12:43,530
No Gordon.

6999
05:12:43,690 --> 05:12:44,430
A dream.

7000
05:12:47,730 --> 05:12:48,330
Wait.

7001
05:12:48,630 --> 05:12:49,770
Oh my god I have a checkpoint.

7002
05:12:50,150 --> 05:12:51,130
Oh thank god.

7003
05:12:51,210 --> 05:12:52,210
That means I can do it.

7004
05:12:52,310 --> 05:12:53,610
I can do my thing again.

7005
05:12:54,990 --> 05:12:56,550
That's fucking right.

7006
05:12:58,790 --> 05:12:59,670
That's right.

7007
05:13:00,050 --> 05:13:01,930
Now I'm mountain monkey.

7008
05:13:02,870 --> 05:13:04,870
Now I'm mountain monkey.

7009
05:13:05,170 --> 05:13:06,670
That's fucking right.

7010
05:13:07,290 --> 05:13:08,450
Oh shit.

7011
05:13:08,630 --> 05:13:09,590
You do so much.

7012
05:13:09,690 --> 05:13:10,090
What the fuck.

7013
05:13:10,090 --> 05:13:10,330
What the fuck.

7014
05:13:11,390 --> 05:13:12,470
What the fuck.

7015
05:13:13,070 --> 05:13:14,290
Oh my god.

7016
05:13:14,370 --> 05:13:15,230
What the fuck.

7017
05:13:15,270 --> 05:13:15,550
Okay.

7018
05:13:15,570 --> 05:13:16,230
That's fine.

7019
05:13:16,570 --> 05:13:17,270
I guess.

7020
05:13:18,550 --> 05:13:19,030
Okay.

7021
05:13:19,150 --> 05:13:19,630
Did I.

7022
05:13:19,750 --> 05:13:20,530
I did not hit.

7023
05:13:20,630 --> 05:13:21,070
But that's.

7024
05:13:21,470 --> 05:13:21,950
Okay.

7025
05:13:22,510 --> 05:13:22,990
Alright.

7026
05:13:23,170 --> 05:13:24,090
Give me a sec.

7027
05:13:27,990 --> 05:13:28,470
Okay.

7028
05:13:28,950 --> 05:13:29,430
Alright.

7029
05:13:29,850 --> 05:13:30,330
Bro.

7030
05:13:30,630 --> 05:13:31,110
Bro.

7031
05:13:31,110 --> 05:13:31,450
Bro.

7032
05:13:31,510 --> 05:13:31,790
Wait.

7033
05:13:33,670 --> 05:13:34,630
Oh thank god.

7034
05:13:34,690 --> 05:13:34,890
Okay.

7035
05:13:34,970 --> 05:13:35,390
I got it.

7036
05:13:36,050 --> 05:13:36,990
Thank god.

7037
05:13:37,530 --> 05:13:38,170
Oh wait.

7038
05:13:38,290 --> 05:13:38,770
One.

7039
05:13:39,330 --> 05:13:40,130
Here we go.

7040
05:13:41,990 --> 05:13:42,690
Here we go.

7041
05:13:43,410 --> 05:13:44,470
We have this.

7042
05:13:46,650 --> 05:13:47,370
Thank god.

7043
05:13:48,410 --> 05:13:49,750
I can do this now.

7044
05:13:50,770 --> 05:13:51,730
Oh shit.

7045
05:13:51,810 --> 05:13:52,490
Ring of fire.

7046
05:13:53,910 --> 05:13:54,590
That's illegal.

7047
05:13:55,590 --> 05:13:57,390
I've never used ring of fire.

7048
05:13:59,890 --> 05:14:01,650
You're supposed to be also me.

7049
05:14:01,810 --> 05:14:03,230
But I don't use ring of fire.

7050
05:14:05,210 --> 05:14:06,010
Oh nice.

7051
05:14:06,170 --> 05:14:06,370
Alright.

7052
05:14:09,430 --> 05:14:12,270
How are you me if you use moves I don't use.

7053
05:14:12,610 --> 05:14:14,090
That doesn't make sense.

7054
05:14:18,540 --> 05:14:20,870
It's time to update the iOS.

7055
05:14:21,470 --> 05:14:23,550
All I'm saying is that.

7056
05:14:23,730 --> 05:14:28,110
How is he me if he uses moves that I never use.

7057
05:14:31,290 --> 05:14:33,170
Oh not the ring of fire.

7058
05:14:33,270 --> 05:14:33,490
Bro.

7059
05:14:34,910 --> 05:14:37,450
He went out the ring of fire.

7060
05:14:41,130 --> 05:14:42,970
I thought that doesn't exist.

7061
05:14:44,090 --> 05:14:45,830
How did you get out of it?

7062
05:14:47,850 --> 05:14:48,590
Oh okay.

7063
05:14:50,930 --> 05:14:51,370
Okay.

7064
05:14:51,470 --> 05:14:52,170
I just need to be sure.

7065
05:14:53,330 --> 05:14:53,770
Okay.

7066
05:14:53,850 --> 05:14:54,130
Nice.

7067
05:14:55,530 --> 05:14:56,350
Oh shit.

7068
05:14:59,290 --> 05:14:59,730
Alright.

7069
05:14:59,850 --> 05:15:01,170
I'm backing out so I can heal.

7070
05:15:01,970 --> 05:15:03,630
Not because I'm scared of you.

7071
05:15:04,710 --> 05:15:05,510
It's not fair.

7072
05:15:05,590 --> 05:15:07,650
You like took my all my stance stuff too.

7073
05:15:08,030 --> 05:15:08,470
I.

7074
05:15:08,530 --> 05:15:08,970
Okay.

7075
05:15:11,250 --> 05:15:11,770
That's.

7076
05:15:12,530 --> 05:15:13,430
That's fucked.

7077
05:15:13,690 --> 05:15:15,130
What he just did.

7078
05:15:15,370 --> 05:15:17,090
Was actually so toxic.

7079
05:15:17,370 --> 05:15:18,190
Not gonna lie.

7080
05:15:19,750 --> 05:15:21,610
That was so toxic.

7081
05:15:24,010 --> 05:15:27,050
He actually was the most toxic piece of shit.

7082
05:15:27,150 --> 05:15:28,270
What the fuck.

7083
05:15:28,810 --> 05:15:29,330
Okay.

7084
05:15:30,310 --> 05:15:30,830
Alright.

7085
05:15:31,130 --> 05:15:31,850
That's fine.

7086
05:15:31,950 --> 05:15:32,550
I don't need it.

7087
05:15:33,550 --> 05:15:34,650
I don't need it.

7088
05:15:34,690 --> 05:15:35,750
I don't need it at all.

7089
05:15:35,850 --> 05:15:36,270
I don't.

7090
05:15:36,270 --> 05:15:37,030
I don't need you.

7091
05:15:37,590 --> 05:15:38,110
Oh.

7092
05:15:38,670 --> 05:15:39,190
Oh.

7093
05:15:39,190 --> 05:15:40,190
That's fine.

7094
05:15:41,310 --> 05:15:42,430
That's also fine.

7095
05:15:44,570 --> 05:15:45,490
Oh my god.

7096
05:15:45,510 --> 05:15:46,570
I forgot other stances.

7097
05:15:46,570 --> 05:15:46,850
Guys.

7098
05:15:47,050 --> 05:15:48,350
It's been so long.

7099
05:15:48,470 --> 05:15:50,150
I forgot other stances existed.

7100
05:15:51,960 --> 05:15:52,250
Guys.

7101
05:15:52,250 --> 05:15:54,890
I actually forgot other stances existed.

7102
05:15:55,110 --> 05:15:55,690
Guys.

7103
05:15:58,250 --> 05:15:59,810
I've been using.

7104
05:16:00,490 --> 05:16:01,070
Nons.

7105
05:16:03,170 --> 05:16:03,750
God.

7106
05:16:08,020 --> 05:16:08,660
You bitch.

7107
05:16:08,740 --> 05:16:10,380
I was trying to do that.

7108
05:16:15,000 --> 05:16:16,460
You actual bitch.

7109
05:16:16,800 --> 05:16:17,360
No.

7110
05:16:19,580 --> 05:16:20,140
No.

7111
05:16:27,520 --> 05:16:28,820
I'll bonk you first.

7112
05:16:28,960 --> 05:16:29,260
No.

7113
05:16:30,920 --> 05:16:31,480
Okay.

7114
05:16:33,840 --> 05:16:34,960
God damn it.

7115
05:16:36,240 --> 05:16:36,800
No.

7116
05:16:37,540 --> 05:16:38,100
No.

7117
05:16:38,100 --> 05:16:39,260
I don't know your pattern.

7118
05:16:39,640 --> 05:16:40,520
You're mean.

7119
05:16:40,600 --> 05:16:42,180
But you use moves I never use.

7120
05:16:45,120 --> 05:16:45,680
Like.

7121
05:16:45,820 --> 05:16:47,160
How is this fairway.

7122
05:16:47,180 --> 05:16:48,180
I never use any moves.

7123
05:16:48,180 --> 05:16:48,540
I don't even know how many of these.

7124
05:16:52,880 --> 05:16:53,580
Here we go.

7125
05:16:55,080 --> 05:16:55,880
Oh god.

7126
05:16:55,920 --> 05:16:56,840
Not the ring of fire.

7127
05:16:57,160 --> 05:16:58,700
Not the ring of fire.

7128
05:17:03,820 --> 05:17:04,320
What.

7129
05:17:04,900 --> 05:17:06,600
He can fight on the cloud.

7130
05:17:10,870 --> 05:17:12,410
That's actually fucked.

7131
05:17:13,650 --> 05:17:15,830
He can fight on the cloud too.

7132
05:17:16,230 --> 05:17:16,730
Like.

7133
05:17:17,050 --> 05:17:19,630
He has everything I've ever wanted in this game.

7134
05:17:22,130 --> 05:17:24,290
I bet I can't even do that in a new game.

7135
05:17:24,310 --> 05:17:24,550
Please.

7136
05:17:24,550 --> 05:17:24,750
God damn it.

7137
05:17:24,750 --> 05:17:25,590
Nons that's the worst part.

7138
05:17:25,790 --> 05:17:27,390
That's the worst part.

7139
05:17:28,410 --> 05:17:28,810
No.

7140
05:17:35,520 --> 05:17:37,940
I actually first killed.

7141
05:17:38,520 --> 05:17:40,780
But he wouldn't let me.

7142
05:17:40,940 --> 05:17:42,940
I even scrolled to it.

7143
05:17:43,120 --> 05:17:46,840
I even scrolled to it too.

7144
05:17:50,420 --> 05:17:52,800
I can't believe it.

7145
05:17:52,840 --> 05:17:56,260
I scrolled to this and it didn't register.

7146
05:17:57,020 --> 05:17:57,820
Nons.

7147
05:17:57,820 --> 05:18:01,940
Oh my god, that's so messed up.

7148
05:18:03,020 --> 05:18:05,720
I'm just gonna use baby first just because he's sitting down.

7149
05:18:09,200 --> 05:18:11,420
Because he's sitting down, I'll use it first.

7150
05:18:14,820 --> 05:18:15,300
Jesus.

7151
05:18:15,920 --> 05:18:17,700
Okay, that's fine.

7152
05:18:20,000 --> 05:18:20,700
That's fine.

7153
05:18:24,080 --> 05:18:25,600
I need my heals back.

7154
05:18:25,840 --> 05:18:26,740
Get over here.

7155
05:18:27,320 --> 05:18:28,620
Get over here, me.

7156
05:18:30,240 --> 05:18:32,000
That's where I'll lock you in this corner.

7157
05:18:32,860 --> 05:18:34,740
When I- okay, when I get this hit on.

7158
05:18:35,440 --> 05:18:35,880
Okay.

7159
05:18:38,600 --> 05:18:41,660
I'll still punch you until you're dead!

7160
05:18:43,280 --> 05:18:44,260
Oh, come on!

7161
05:18:44,300 --> 05:18:45,000
Get over here!

7162
05:18:46,800 --> 05:18:47,720
Get over here!

7163
05:18:48,460 --> 05:18:49,800
Oh, you're gonna use ring of fire?

7164
05:18:49,940 --> 05:18:51,520
You think I care about ring of fire?

7165
05:18:51,640 --> 05:18:53,600
I'm fucking walking into the ring of fire.

7166
05:18:53,820 --> 05:18:55,960
I'm gonna keep walking into the ring of fire.

7167
05:18:57,940 --> 05:18:59,100
That's fucking right.

7168
05:19:00,360 --> 05:19:02,780
Okay, and now I'll use this- NO, I DIDN'T!

7169
05:19:02,800 --> 05:19:03,560
I MADE THE FAN!

7170
05:19:03,740 --> 05:19:04,980
Fuck, okay, nevermind.

7171
05:19:05,180 --> 05:19:07,420
Alright, we're gonna- Okay, this is bad.

7172
05:19:07,560 --> 05:19:08,560
I was supposed to use the fan.

7173
05:19:09,640 --> 05:19:10,560
This is bad.

7174
05:19:11,480 --> 05:19:12,480
This is a little bad.

7175
05:19:12,620 --> 05:19:13,400
I fucked up already.

7176
05:19:13,780 --> 05:19:18,160
I was supposed to use- It's okay.

7177
05:19:19,920 --> 05:19:20,520
It's okay.

7178
05:19:21,320 --> 05:19:26,700
Sometimes, we're here to make it a little bit harder for ourselves, because we like- We like it.

7179
05:19:26,720 --> 05:19:27,200
We like- We like the challenge.

7180
05:19:27,560 --> 05:19:30,000
We really like the challenge.

7181
05:19:30,660 --> 05:19:32,160
That's just it.

7182
05:19:34,660 --> 05:19:35,960
It's fun.

7183
05:19:36,220 --> 05:19:37,400
It's so fun.

7184
05:19:39,360 --> 05:19:40,400
Okay.

7185
05:19:40,580 --> 05:19:41,940
My turn.

7186
05:19:43,720 --> 05:19:44,240
BAM!

7187
05:19:45,620 --> 05:19:47,740
Sounds like... oh.

7188
05:19:50,660 --> 05:19:52,980
We're just challenge enjoyers.

7189
05:19:58,960 --> 05:20:00,020
Oh my god.

7190
05:20:00,120 --> 05:20:03,000
This... this move is so bullshit.

7191
05:20:06,180 --> 05:20:06,600
Okay.

7192
05:20:07,760 --> 05:20:08,180
Okay.

7193
05:20:08,300 --> 05:20:11,340
I need to like focus on dodging his attacks.

7194
05:20:12,180 --> 05:20:12,600
Okay.

7195
05:20:12,700 --> 05:20:12,960
Nice.

7196
05:20:13,560 --> 05:20:13,980
Okay.

7197
05:20:14,920 --> 05:20:15,340
Okay.

7198
05:20:15,400 --> 05:20:15,700
Nice.

7199
05:20:15,820 --> 05:20:17,540
I figured out the pattern, I think.

7200
05:20:17,740 --> 05:20:17,880
Oh.

7201
05:20:18,100 --> 05:20:19,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

7202
05:20:19,080 --> 05:20:19,500
No!

7203
05:20:21,000 --> 05:20:23,480
This is the first time I hit the rock!

7204
05:20:25,180 --> 05:20:26,400
Bro, what the fuck?

7205
05:20:26,420 --> 05:20:27,300
You're just standing there.

7206
05:20:27,320 --> 05:20:27,640
What?

7207
05:20:27,800 --> 05:20:28,060
Bro!

7208
05:20:28,200 --> 05:20:28,900
Oh, thank you.

7209
05:20:29,240 --> 05:20:30,580
Thank you for the stick.

7210
05:20:30,680 --> 05:20:31,660
Thank you, sir.

7211
05:20:31,840 --> 05:20:32,580
Thank you.

7212
05:20:34,520 --> 05:20:36,380
Thank you for the stick, sir.

7213
05:20:38,360 --> 05:20:38,900
Okay.

7214
05:20:39,380 --> 05:20:40,580
Oh, no.

7215
05:20:42,340 --> 05:20:42,880
Okay.

7216
05:20:42,960 --> 05:20:43,700
I dodged in time.

7217
05:20:45,780 --> 05:20:46,600
My turn.

7218
05:20:52,220 --> 05:20:53,480
He can do that?

7219
05:20:55,980 --> 05:20:57,780
Why can't I do that?

7220
05:21:00,840 --> 05:21:04,240
He can just grab my stick?

7221
05:21:04,800 --> 05:21:07,640
He can freeze me too?

7222
05:21:10,120 --> 05:21:11,740
Guys, this is not fair.

7223
05:21:12,100 --> 05:21:12,440
What?

7224
05:21:13,800 --> 05:21:15,480
My hands are off the keyboard.

7225
05:21:15,760 --> 05:21:16,220
This is...

7226
05:21:16,220 --> 05:21:18,300
When did he start doing all of these moves?

7227
05:21:19,240 --> 05:21:19,840
When?

7228
05:21:20,100 --> 05:21:20,700
When?

7229
05:21:21,080 --> 05:21:21,680
When?

7230
05:21:21,680 --> 05:21:23,100
When did he learn...

7231
05:21:23,100 --> 05:21:23,320
Whoa!

7232
05:21:24,360 --> 05:21:24,960
When?

7233
05:21:25,120 --> 05:21:27,760
When did he learn how to do all these moves?

7234
05:21:27,760 --> 05:21:29,320
I don't understand!

7235
05:21:29,700 --> 05:21:30,040
I...

7236
05:21:34,240 --> 05:21:36,700
Why did he do these before?

7237
05:21:39,460 --> 05:21:40,140
I...

7238
05:21:40,140 --> 05:21:41,900
Why did he...

7239
05:21:41,900 --> 05:21:44,500
Why did he do any of these moves?

7240
05:21:44,540 --> 05:21:45,420
I don't understand.

7241
05:21:49,040 --> 05:21:49,720
There's...

7242
05:21:49,720 --> 05:21:52,640
There's so many new moves that I've never seen before.

7243
05:21:54,040 --> 05:21:54,720
There's...

7244
05:21:54,720 --> 05:21:56,560
There's so many...

7245
05:21:56,560 --> 05:21:57,740
Oh, he's just gonna do all these moves.

7246
05:21:57,740 --> 05:21:58,160
SHIT!

7247
05:21:58,820 --> 05:22:00,040
EVERYTHING IS NEW!

7248
05:22:02,170 --> 05:22:03,620
OH MY GOD!

7249
05:22:05,070 --> 05:22:06,400
Goodbye, cruel world.

7250
05:22:06,560 --> 05:22:06,920
Goodbye.

7251
05:22:07,320 --> 05:22:10,320
I'm just gonna... just get this over with.

7252
05:22:11,260 --> 05:22:12,040
Like,

7253
05:22:16,620 --> 05:22:19,540
he can fucking grab the stick?!

7254
05:22:23,930 --> 05:22:28,960
What do you... What do you mean he can just grab the stick?!

7255
05:22:32,160 --> 05:22:33,480
What do you mean?!

7256
05:22:33,480 --> 05:22:37,020
What do you mean he can just grab it?!

7257
05:22:42,640 --> 05:22:44,820
I didn't know he could do that!

7258
05:22:46,040 --> 05:22:48,000
Oh, someone should just do this.

7259
05:22:48,880 --> 05:22:50,180
Oh my god, you're right.

7260
05:22:50,240 --> 05:22:51,180
This is smart.

7261
05:22:52,860 --> 05:22:54,300
And then I could just do that.

7262
05:22:55,700 --> 05:22:57,260
Oh shit, you're right!

7263
05:22:58,900 --> 05:23:00,180
Now it's big baby time.

7264
05:23:01,360 --> 05:23:02,340
Yeah, that's right.

7265
05:23:02,460 --> 05:23:04,020
And now it's fan time.

7266
05:23:04,460 --> 05:23:06,780
Okay, now it's fan time.

7267
05:23:09,820 --> 05:23:10,820
What are you gonna do?

7268
05:23:10,980 --> 05:23:11,940
Oh, okay.

7269
05:23:12,040 --> 05:23:12,860
Thank god.

7270
05:23:12,900 --> 05:23:13,720
Okay, I was gonna say...

7271
05:23:15,340 --> 05:23:17,000
I don't need monkey.

7272
05:23:17,040 --> 05:23:18,160
I don't need...

7273
05:23:18,160 --> 05:23:20,520
I don't need to use my fucking...

7274
05:23:21,060 --> 05:23:22,060
Uh, what's it called?

7275
05:23:22,680 --> 05:23:24,240
I have this now.

7276
05:23:25,380 --> 05:23:26,240
Oh god.

7277
05:23:26,340 --> 05:23:26,880
Oh god.

7278
05:23:29,080 --> 05:23:30,100
Nice, I dodged it.

7279
05:23:32,020 --> 05:23:33,900
Okay, he dodged it too, but that...

7280
05:23:33,900 --> 05:23:35,160
Oh, he dodged everything.

7281
05:23:35,380 --> 05:23:35,820
That's okay.

7282
05:23:38,440 --> 05:23:39,020
That's okay.

7283
05:23:40,160 --> 05:23:40,920
Stuff happens.

7284
05:23:42,640 --> 05:23:43,220
That's fine.

7285
05:23:45,780 --> 05:23:46,660
Oh, that's fine.

7286
05:23:48,420 --> 05:23:50,220
That is not fine, but that's okay.

7287
05:23:50,300 --> 05:23:50,760
I dodged that.

7288
05:23:50,800 --> 05:23:52,040
That is not fine, but it's okay.

7289
05:23:52,080 --> 05:23:52,520
I dodged that.

7290
05:23:58,580 --> 05:23:59,340
All right.

7291
05:23:59,940 --> 05:24:01,560
Okay, we figured this out.

7292
05:24:02,800 --> 05:24:06,980
Oh my god.

7293
05:24:07,100 --> 05:24:08,380
I keep fucking that up.

7294
05:24:08,500 --> 05:24:10,820
I keep forgetting he can do that and I...

7295
05:24:11,520 --> 05:24:13,040
Because he took me in.

7296
05:24:13,420 --> 05:24:16,880
He absorbed me and I keep forgetting he can actually do that now.

7297
05:24:19,020 --> 05:24:20,800
Oh my god, did you see that?

7298
05:24:21,260 --> 05:24:23,020
I dodged it!

7299
05:24:23,520 --> 05:24:25,160
Okay, that was cool.

7300
05:24:25,440 --> 05:24:28,400
You have to admit, that was actually cool.

7301
05:24:28,400 --> 05:24:28,680
You have to admit, that was actually cool.

7302
05:24:29,540 --> 05:24:30,520
You have to admit, that was actually cool.

7303
05:24:34,220 --> 05:24:34,620
Okay.

7304
05:24:36,000 --> 05:24:36,900
That's Ricky, right?

7305
05:24:38,120 --> 05:24:39,760
Oh, he didn't grab it this time.

7306
05:24:40,060 --> 05:24:40,780
Thank god.

7307
05:24:40,900 --> 05:24:42,220
Oh no, not the ring of fire.

7308
05:24:42,420 --> 05:24:43,740
No, not that too!

7309
05:24:44,180 --> 05:24:45,580
No, not that too!

7310
05:24:49,860 --> 05:24:51,200
Okay, I dodged it.

7311
05:24:52,520 --> 05:24:52,920
Okay.

7312
05:24:54,140 --> 05:24:54,820
Full focus.

7313
05:24:54,940 --> 05:24:55,340
Full focus.

7314
05:24:55,980 --> 05:24:56,900
Okay, full focus.

7315
05:24:57,540 --> 05:24:58,860
You gotta focus more.

7316
05:24:59,080 --> 05:24:59,900
No, don't grab this.

7317
05:25:00,000 --> 05:25:00,400
Oh, thank god.

7318
05:25:00,440 --> 05:25:00,680
Okay.

7319
05:25:01,380 --> 05:25:03,100
I'm always so scared he's gonna grab.

7320
05:25:05,700 --> 05:25:06,100
Okay.

7321
05:25:09,240 --> 05:25:09,760
Dodged it.

7322
05:25:10,260 --> 05:25:10,760
That's good.

7323
05:25:13,840 --> 05:25:15,420
Okay, I grabbed, dodged it too.

7324
05:25:15,560 --> 05:25:16,080
I think.

7325
05:25:16,120 --> 05:25:17,020
I don't think I grabbed.

7326
05:25:17,200 --> 05:25:17,980
Dodged it, guys.

7327
05:25:19,340 --> 05:25:20,260
Wait, what did he do?

7328
05:25:21,760 --> 05:25:22,560
I just...

7329
05:25:23,500 --> 05:25:23,900
Okay.

7330
05:25:24,440 --> 05:25:25,420
Oh, he did that.

7331
05:25:25,720 --> 05:25:26,940
I was like, what was that?

7332
05:25:28,500 --> 05:25:29,120
Fine!

7333
05:25:33,150 --> 05:25:33,460
Ah!

7334
05:25:41,680 --> 05:25:42,920
Oh noo.

7335
05:25:43,200 --> 05:25:44,820
My poor body!

7336
05:25:46,940 --> 05:25:49,180
He fucking confused it!

7337
05:25:49,940 --> 05:25:51,040
Oh, thank god.

7338
05:25:51,340 --> 05:25:57,080
Every day I'm worried that he's gonna grab it Ever since he did that one move.

7339
05:25:57,340 --> 05:26:02,340
I'm so paranoid that he's just gonna grab my stick now So...

7340
05:26:04,900 --> 05:26:05,600
Oh, God.

7341
05:26:07,480 --> 05:26:08,440
Oh, thank God.

7342
05:26:13,680 --> 05:26:14,540
Please don't grab.

7343
05:26:16,320 --> 05:26:17,000
Thank God.

7344
05:26:17,040 --> 05:26:17,220
Okay.

7345
05:26:18,680 --> 05:26:20,460
Guys, you don't understand.

7346
05:26:20,620 --> 05:26:22,840
As long as he doesn't grab it, I'm okay.

7347
05:26:25,080 --> 05:26:28,000
Okay, but what if I do this?

7348
05:26:29,760 --> 05:26:30,200
Oh.

7349
05:26:32,520 --> 05:26:33,160
Oh, no.

7350
05:26:33,600 --> 05:26:34,040
No!

7352
05:26:35,760 --> 05:26:36,200

I missed!

7354
05:26:37,780 --> 05:26:38,600
Come on, reload.

7355
05:26:38,740 --> 05:26:39,180
Reload.

7356
05:26:39,340 --> 05:26:39,780
Okay.

7357
05:26:43,020 --> 05:26:43,600
Come on.

7358
05:26:44,720 --> 05:26:45,640
Okay, thank God.

7359
05:26:45,800 --> 05:26:46,140
Okay.

7360
05:26:46,520 --> 05:26:47,180
Oh, no.

7361
05:26:48,120 --> 05:26:48,720
Last... No!

7362
05:26:50,120 --> 05:26:50,560
Okay.

7363
05:26:50,760 --> 05:26:51,400
Hail Mary.

7364
05:26:52,520 --> 05:26:53,200
Hail Mary.

7365
05:26:57,340 --> 05:26:58,780
This is my Hail Mary attempt.

7366
05:27:03,760 --> 05:27:04,600
Oh, God.

7367
05:27:04,720 --> 05:27:05,060
No!

7368
05:27:06,640 --> 05:27:07,080
No!

7369
05:27:07,360 --> 05:27:07,800
Okay.

7370
05:27:11,450 --> 05:27:12,030
Oh, God.

7371
05:27:12,930 --> 05:27:14,390
Oh, God.

7372
05:27:18,800 --> 05:27:20,160
Are you serious?

7373
05:27:24,430 --> 05:27:28,770
Oh, he fucking... Okay, I don't know where that was supposed to go, but that's fine.

7374
05:27:30,930 --> 05:27:33,090
Guys, I don't think this is the run.

7375
05:27:34,010 --> 05:27:34,450
No!

7376
05:27:36,210 --> 05:27:36,650
No!

7377
05:27:40,570 --> 05:27:42,210
Wait, is there another phase?

7378
05:27:52,330 --> 05:27:52,770
Please.

7379
05:28:01,340 --> 05:28:01,780
Please.

7380
05:28:01,960 --> 05:28:02,940
There's no way.

7381
05:28:03,420 --> 05:28:04,820
The name didn't show up.

7382
05:28:09,440 --> 05:28:10,440
There's no way.

7383
05:28:12,520 --> 05:28:14,800
This is why I don't change my phone.

7384
05:28:14,860 --> 05:28:15,800
iPhone 15.

7385
05:28:16,640 --> 05:28:18,100
Oh, my God.

7386
05:28:18,220 --> 05:28:21,060
I don't need the upgrade to iPhone 16.

7387
05:28:21,100 --> 05:28:21,560
Let's go.

7388
05:28:22,220 --> 05:28:24,100
I don't need that pink iPhone.

7389
05:28:32,740 --> 05:28:34,320
Oh, it's coming back.

7390
05:28:41,240 --> 05:28:42,360
My memory's...

7391
05:29:21,050 --> 05:29:22,610
Oh...你們一定都听过关于他的故事有人说他帮唐僧取到了真经封了斗战圣佛从此留在了灵山 Thank you for the super chat.

7392
05:29:22,690 --> 05:29:33,190
Thank you.也有人说也有人说 No, the one who became a Buddha is not him at all.

7393
05:29:33,630 --> 05:29:39,110
The real him has long died on the path of enlightenment.

7394
05:29:40,850 --> 05:29:43,590
And some people say that I am him.

7395
05:29:43,590 --> 05:29:44,290
I am him.

7396
05:30:05,750 --> 05:30:08,810
So he is...

7397
05:30:09,280 --> 05:30:10,530
He is...

7398
05:30:10,530 --> 05:30:10,630
The...

7399
05:30:12,610 --> 05:30:13,410
The binds.

7400
05:30:23,750 --> 05:30:24,310
Wait, what?

7401
05:30:26,310 --> 05:30:27,270
The circlet, yeah.

7402
05:30:29,130 --> 05:30:30,170
You are iPhone.

7403
05:30:33,430 --> 05:30:35,210
Wait, no, get that shit away from me.

7404
05:30:35,250 --> 05:30:35,810
What the fuck?

7405
05:30:44,120 --> 05:30:44,860
What the fuck?

7406
05:30:44,920 --> 05:30:45,260
Get away!

7407
05:31:36,400 --> 05:31:37,560
This is when I died.

7408
05:32:00,500 --> 05:32:03,580
Oh, this is when I became... when I finished my journey.

7409
05:32:09,740 --> 05:32:11,660
No, I killed my own car.

7410
05:32:15,190 --> 05:32:15,480
Yeah.

7411
05:32:15,800 --> 05:32:17,760
This is... that was the ending.

7412
05:32:18,040 --> 05:32:19,900
This is us heading to the journey.

7413
05:32:21,500 --> 05:32:26,740
I'm happy that we never saw that other guy in the group.

7414
05:32:30,320 --> 05:32:30,900
Oh, yeah.

7415
05:32:30,900 --> 05:32:31,720
Oh, yeah.

7416
05:32:31,720 --> 05:32:32,900
Oh, yeah.

7417
05:32:34,500 --> 05:32:35,220
Oh, yeah.

7418
05:32:35,220 --> 05:32:36,180
Oh, yeah, this is in reverse.

7419
05:32:36,540 --> 05:32:38,620
This is the whole story in reverse, is it?

7420
05:32:40,800 --> 05:32:42,360
Yeah, I never saw Sandy.

7421
05:32:43,140 --> 05:32:44,360
I never saw him.

7422
05:32:44,460 --> 05:32:45,200
To be fair, he...

7423
05:32:45,200 --> 05:32:46,860
I personally think like...

7424
05:32:46,860 --> 05:32:49,020
I don't think he's anyone's favorite character.

7425
05:32:49,560 --> 05:32:51,780
But like, unless, you know, sorry.

7426
05:32:52,340 --> 05:32:53,860
I always forget him.

7427
05:32:53,980 --> 05:32:56,300
I know what he looks like, but I always forget his name.

7428
05:33:10,540 --> 05:33:11,720
He's just there.

7429
05:33:13,060 --> 05:33:13,760
Okay, everyone.

7430
05:33:13,860 --> 05:33:15,500
Yeah, because nobody really...

7431
05:33:15,500 --> 05:33:17,040
...hears about him.

7432
05:33:19,460 --> 05:33:23,320
Everyone always talks about Chupacca, Shrimpong, and Sifu.

7433
05:33:23,520 --> 05:33:25,880
But no one talks about the other guy.

7434
05:33:28,560 --> 05:33:31,500
Oh, this is when I was like mad about the thing.

7435
05:33:33,740 --> 05:33:34,860
I care.

7436
05:33:37,820 --> 05:33:40,260
He was... yeah, he was there to carry the bags.

7437
05:33:41,800 --> 05:33:45,200
Poor Finn!

7438
05:33:45,300 --> 05:33:45,840
There he is!

7439
05:33:47,280 --> 05:33:50,460
The horse is more famous than Spock!

7440
05:33:51,500 --> 05:33:53,400
I didn't say that.

7441
05:34:00,280 --> 05:34:01,600
Oh my

7442
05:34:09,120 --> 05:34:23,080
god, this is my iconic outfit with the tiger pelt!

7443
05:34:23,790 --> 05:34:24,460
Or Jack...

7444
05:34:25,100 --> 05:34:27,380
I'm celebrating, because I'm about...

7445
05:34:27,380 --> 05:34:27,820
Oh wait, no.

7446
05:34:27,860 --> 05:34:29,180
This is when he crushes me.

7447
05:34:30,880 --> 05:34:33,060
When the Buddha hand crushes me.

7448
05:34:39,400 --> 05:34:40,380
Wait, it's him!

7449
05:34:40,700 --> 05:34:42,360
Or it's the little... little kid.

7450
05:34:45,560 --> 05:34:47,680
Oh, this is me fighting the Celestial Court.

7451
05:34:48,160 --> 05:34:50,040
Because I was like, monkey deserves rights.

7452
05:34:51,340 --> 05:34:53,140
The Celestial Court was like, no.

7453
05:34:53,940 --> 05:34:54,820
Which is fucked.

7454
05:34:55,100 --> 05:34:55,700
Yeah, Neza.

7455
05:34:57,840 --> 05:34:58,880
The wheel kid.

7456
05:34:59,680 --> 05:35:01,040
The fire wheel kid.

7457
05:35:01,980 --> 05:35:04,840
It's me telling my... my brother and my bros.

7458
05:35:04,840 --> 05:35:05,760
My sworn brothers.

7459
05:35:06,260 --> 05:35:08,620
Being like, guys, don't worry, we're totally gonna win, guys.

7460
05:35:08,840 --> 05:35:09,920
No one's gonna die.

7461
05:35:14,660 --> 05:35:15,580
I'm like, bro, guys.

7462
05:35:15,840 --> 05:35:18,020
No one's gonna die, guys, I swear.

7463
05:35:22,380 --> 05:35:24,740
Yeah, this is when he removes the name off the book, yeah.

7464
05:35:26,120 --> 05:35:26,580
See?

7465
05:35:26,720 --> 05:35:27,560
I told you!

7466
05:35:27,680 --> 05:35:29,260
I fucking told you!

7467
05:35:29,440 --> 05:35:31,380
He removes it from his ear!

7468
05:35:32,260 --> 05:35:34,180
That's not behind his ear!

7469
05:35:34,180 --> 05:35:36,380
I fucking told you!

7470
05:35:43,760 --> 05:35:45,840
I fucking do it.

7471
05:35:46,000 --> 05:35:48,680
No, that's his... I told you, he puts it in his ear!

7472
05:35:48,760 --> 05:35:50,320
This is the front of his...

7473
05:35:50,320 --> 05:35:52,560
You were right, we were wrong.

7474
05:35:52,780 --> 05:35:55,160
We didn't vindication!

7475
05:35:58,000 --> 05:35:59,960
That's totally in his ear.

7476
05:36:03,340 --> 05:36:04,780
Oh, this is a nice song.

7477
05:36:06,520 --> 05:36:08,500
Oh my god, we finally did it.

7478
05:36:08,520 --> 05:36:09,800
We finally...

7479
05:36:09,800 --> 05:36:14,200
No more will people be like, Doki, you're still playing Wukong.

7480
05:36:15,660 --> 05:36:18,700
No, cause I finally beat it today!

7481
05:36:22,200 --> 05:36:26,460
No more will people ask me about this.

7482
05:36:31,380 --> 05:36:32,180
No more will people ask me about this.

7483
05:36:32,180 --> 05:36:34,420
Black, thank you for the super chat.

7484
05:36:34,520 --> 05:36:35,320
Thank you, thank you.

7485
05:36:35,380 --> 05:36:36,480
Congrats on beating the game.

7486
05:36:36,580 --> 05:36:39,900
By the way, Wukong was supposed to freeze and steal your gourd after healing.

7487
05:36:40,040 --> 05:36:44,340
But you somehow impulse dodged his immobilize after sipping your...

7488
05:36:44,340 --> 05:36:44,900
Wait, did I?

7489
05:36:47,780 --> 05:36:50,200
I never saw... it never happened!

7490
05:36:52,200 --> 05:36:53,080
That's crazy.

7491
05:36:59,320 --> 05:37:00,580
That's actually insane.

7492
05:37:06,980 --> 05:37:08,440
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

7493
05:37:08,560 --> 05:37:09,260
Thank you, thank you.

7494
05:37:09,300 --> 05:37:10,420
Congratulations, Doki.

7495
05:37:10,520 --> 05:37:12,000
There was one more moment where he freezes you.

7496
05:37:12,100 --> 05:37:12,380
Oh yeah!

7497
05:37:13,360 --> 05:37:14,520
Yeah, DC comes out.

7498
05:37:14,600 --> 05:37:16,040
Hope you return to becoming monkey.

7499
05:37:16,300 --> 05:37:18,580
Maybe Sandy will actually be in the DC DLC.

7500
05:37:20,120 --> 05:37:22,920
I can't believe they didn't include Sandy.

7501
05:37:23,960 --> 05:37:25,920
Till the very end of the book.

7502
05:37:25,920 --> 05:37:27,640
Like in the ending scene.

7503
05:37:29,020 --> 05:37:30,500
Let me give you the super chat.

7504
05:37:30,820 --> 05:37:31,380
Sandy...

7505
05:37:33,020 --> 05:37:35,120
Even the horse was there.

7506
05:37:41,540 --> 05:37:42,740
Oh my god.

7507
05:37:43,360 --> 05:37:44,140
The who?

7508
05:37:44,680 --> 05:37:46,480
Guys, for those who don't know.

7509
05:37:46,980 --> 05:37:49,520
The bros is like...

7510
05:37:49,520 --> 05:37:51,120
There's like four of them.

7511
05:37:51,320 --> 05:37:51,960
It's him.

7512
05:37:52,140 --> 05:37:53,440
Five including the horse.

7513
05:37:53,580 --> 05:37:54,080
It's him.

7514
05:37:54,080 --> 05:37:54,700
Chupacay.

7515
05:37:55,420 --> 05:37:55,740
Sifu.

7516
05:37:55,760 --> 05:37:56,380
And Sandy.

7517
05:37:56,500 --> 05:37:57,140
And the horse.

7518
05:38:00,960 --> 05:38:02,800
But no one really talked about it.

7519
05:38:02,820 --> 05:38:04,360
No one talked about him in the game.

7520
05:38:06,860 --> 05:38:08,240
Thank you for the Akasupa.

7521
05:38:08,480 --> 05:38:09,420
Thank you, thank you.

7522
05:38:09,540 --> 05:38:10,040
Bite size.

7523
05:38:11,440 --> 05:38:12,340
Congrats on being in game.

7524
05:38:12,480 --> 05:38:14,240
I know that you don't really like doing long playthroughs.

7525
05:38:14,240 --> 05:38:15,920
But it's so much fun to watch you play this game.

7526
05:38:16,040 --> 05:38:17,300
Thank you for the great stream, Doki.

7527
05:38:17,420 --> 05:38:18,460
I will miss monkey.

7528
05:38:18,820 --> 05:38:19,940
Thank you for the Akasupa.

7529
05:38:20,080 --> 05:38:21,000
Thank you, thank you.

7530
05:38:21,380 --> 05:38:21,980
That's so cute.

7531
05:38:22,800 --> 05:38:23,120
Because...

7532
05:38:23,120 --> 05:38:25,120
Because we finished monkey...

7533
05:38:25,780 --> 05:38:27,880
It's time to go back to boy.

7534
05:38:31,200 --> 05:38:32,380
Dad of boy.

7535
05:38:33,280 --> 05:38:34,280
Next week though.

7536
05:38:34,360 --> 05:38:35,340
That's for next week though.

7537
05:38:35,500 --> 05:38:38,120
So finally next week we'll go back to God of War.

7538
05:38:38,300 --> 05:38:40,400
And people won't be like, where's God of War?

7539
05:38:43,080 --> 05:38:44,360
It's so many people.

7540
05:38:44,860 --> 05:38:49,520
It's either you still play Wukong or where's God of War.

7541
05:38:53,640 --> 05:38:54,860
God of Boy.

7542
05:38:56,460 --> 05:38:57,780
But this time.

7543
05:38:58,080 --> 05:38:58,680
Finally.

7544
05:39:00,320 --> 05:39:04,520
Next week we're finally going to play God of War.

7545
05:39:04,620 --> 05:39:06,400
We're going back to God of War.

7546
05:39:10,000 --> 05:39:13,060
I actually don't remember the controls.

7547
05:39:13,400 --> 05:39:15,280
So we're going to figure that out later.

7548
05:39:17,200 --> 05:39:18,600
This is a really good song.

7549
05:39:20,800 --> 05:39:21,400
This is a really good song.

7550
05:39:21,780 --> 05:39:23,100
This is a really good song.

7551
05:39:27,700 --> 05:39:29,300
I really enjoyed the game.

7552
05:39:29,400 --> 05:39:31,780
The game has been...

7553
05:39:32,720 --> 05:39:34,020
It's been so fun.

7554
05:39:34,580 --> 05:39:35,900
It's actually been...

7555
05:39:35,900 --> 05:39:38,240
This is actually one of my favorite games of the year.

7556
05:39:38,460 --> 05:39:38,940
Honestly.

7557
05:39:41,180 --> 05:39:41,660
And...

7558
05:39:42,660 --> 05:39:43,520
I hope it...

7559
05:39:43,520 --> 05:39:45,420
I don't know if the music is overpowering me.

7560
05:39:45,500 --> 05:39:46,780
I don't know if you guys can actually hear me.

7561
05:39:47,320 --> 05:39:49,280
Because the music is really loud.

7562
05:39:51,200 --> 05:39:52,120
Fun fact.

7563
05:39:52,120 --> 05:39:52,800
This song is...

7564
05:39:52,800 --> 05:39:53,080
Alright.

7565
05:39:53,980 --> 05:39:54,460
This...

7566
05:39:54,460 --> 05:39:56,780
Clearly we're not getting ad revenue off of this.

7567
05:40:00,640 --> 05:40:02,300
Well, we're not getting ad revenue.

7568
05:40:10,800 --> 05:40:11,280
So...

7569
05:40:12,700 --> 05:40:14,220
So I hope you guys...

7570
05:40:14,220 --> 05:40:15,660
I'll turn this song down a little bit.

7571
05:40:16,020 --> 05:40:18,880
But I hope you guys enjoyed watching this playthrough.

7572
05:40:19,100 --> 05:40:19,680
I had...

7573
05:40:19,680 --> 05:40:20,380
Honestly...

7574
05:40:21,060 --> 05:40:23,440
I had a lot of fun playing it in general.

7575
05:40:23,660 --> 05:40:25,300
And I'm glad to finally beat it.

7576
05:40:25,420 --> 05:40:25,880
And...

7577
05:40:26,480 --> 05:40:27,280
Show my...

7578
05:40:27,280 --> 05:40:28,080
I don't know.

7579
05:40:28,160 --> 05:40:29,400
Quote-on-quote gamer skills.

7580
05:40:31,760 --> 05:40:33,660
Doug, thank you for the Akasupa.

7581
05:40:33,840 --> 05:40:34,160
Thank you.

7582
05:40:34,180 --> 05:40:34,580
Thank you.

7583
05:40:34,760 --> 05:40:36,240
Congrats on beating Wukong.

7584
05:40:36,340 --> 05:40:37,020
40 hours.

7585
05:40:37,100 --> 05:40:39,060
And it was so much fun to watch the entire journey.

7586
05:40:39,340 --> 05:40:41,080
This was my first experience with the story.

7587
05:40:41,120 --> 05:40:43,380
And I'm so glad I got to experience it with all you dragons.

7588
05:40:43,660 --> 05:40:44,920
Thank you for the Akasupa.

7589
05:40:44,960 --> 05:40:45,360
Thank you.

7590
05:40:45,380 --> 05:40:45,760
Thank you.

7591
05:40:45,760 --> 05:40:52,700
Well, if you really enjoyed the Wukong story, I highly recommend checking out the TV and movie adaptations of Wukong.

7592
05:40:52,820 --> 05:40:53,980
There's a lot of classic ones.

7593
05:40:54,580 --> 05:40:54,980
And...

7594
05:40:54,980 --> 05:40:55,200
And...

7595
05:40:55,200 --> 05:40:55,340
And...

7596
05:40:55,340 --> 05:40:55,740
And...

7597
05:40:57,100 --> 05:40:58,740
I really recommend...

7598
05:40:58,740 --> 05:41:01,240
A lot of the adaptations are really, really good in general.

7599
05:41:01,460 --> 05:41:06,820
I think my favorite ones are the TVB version and the CCTV version.

7600
05:41:07,200 --> 05:41:07,980
Wait, it's not...

7601
05:41:11,600 --> 05:41:12,640
I'm sorry.

7602
05:41:13,040 --> 05:41:14,560
I forgot the...

7603
05:41:14,560 --> 05:41:14,860
Is it?

7604
05:41:15,080 --> 05:41:15,480
Yeah, yeah.

7605
05:41:15,820 --> 05:41:17,760
It's the CCTV version too.

7606
05:41:17,900 --> 05:41:18,100
Yeah.

7607
05:41:19,200 --> 05:41:20,980
I was going to say, is it that version?

7608
05:41:21,140 --> 05:41:21,300
Yeah.

7609
05:41:21,700 --> 05:41:25,060
And the Zhao Xingti movies.

7610
05:41:25,200 --> 05:41:25,720
The...

7611
05:41:25,740 --> 05:41:26,500
The Zhao Xingti movies.

7612
05:41:26,560 --> 05:41:28,560
Steven Chao movies are my favorite adaptations.

7613
05:41:31,720 --> 05:41:32,320
So...

7614
05:41:32,920 --> 05:41:35,800
And I know a lot of them are actually on...

7615
05:41:36,920 --> 05:41:37,520
On...

7616
05:41:37,520 --> 05:41:39,080
For free on YouTube.

7617
05:41:39,180 --> 05:41:40,440
So it's very interesting.

7618
05:41:40,660 --> 05:41:41,740
It's a very fun story.

7619
05:41:43,580 --> 05:41:44,180
Yeah.

7620
05:41:44,280 --> 05:41:47,160
The Steven Chao movies are really good as well.

7621
05:41:50,040 --> 05:41:51,240
But yeah.

7622
05:41:51,360 --> 05:41:52,880
I'm so happy to play...

7623
05:41:52,880 --> 05:41:54,640
I'm really happy that...

7624
05:41:54,640 --> 05:41:55,520
That...

7625
05:41:55,520 --> 05:41:55,720
That...

7626
05:41:55,740 --> 05:41:56,760
The...

7627
05:41:57,520 --> 05:42:01,120
I'm just really, really happy that the...

7628
05:42:01,740 --> 05:42:05,420
That it was such a nice adaptation of...

7629
05:42:06,300 --> 05:42:07,380
Of the...

7630
05:42:07,380 --> 05:42:08,560
The story in general.

7631
05:42:08,700 --> 05:42:09,220
It's act...

7632
05:42:09,220 --> 05:42:09,860
It's such a...

7633
05:42:09,860 --> 05:42:10,860
It's such a...

7634
05:42:10,860 --> 05:42:11,990
It's such a good...

7635
05:42:12,440 --> 05:42:14,060
It's just such a good show.

7636
05:42:14,860 --> 05:42:16,200
It's just such a good show.

7637
05:42:16,300 --> 05:42:17,280
A really good show.

7638
05:42:17,380 --> 05:42:18,360
A really good...

7639
05:42:19,760 --> 05:42:20,840
Good series.

7640
05:42:20,960 --> 05:42:22,440
A really good...

7641
05:42:23,380 --> 05:42:24,740
Like the original...

7642
05:42:24,740 --> 05:42:25,720
The original show.

7643
05:42:25,740 --> 05:42:26,120
Like...

7644
05:42:26,120 --> 05:42:26,520
Not show.

7645
05:42:26,600 --> 05:42:26,720
Sorry.

7646
05:42:26,780 --> 05:42:27,540
The original book.

7647
05:42:28,660 --> 05:42:29,140
The...

7648
05:42:29,140 --> 05:42:29,640
I was like...

7649
05:42:29,640 --> 05:42:30,060
Yes.

7650
05:42:30,160 --> 05:42:30,640
The show.

7651
05:42:30,860 --> 05:42:31,280
Sorry.

7652
05:42:31,360 --> 05:42:33,300
The original book as well.

7653
05:42:33,340 --> 05:42:34,480
The original book is like...

7654
05:42:34,480 --> 05:42:35,320
A lot of...

7655
05:42:36,340 --> 05:42:37,260
Very deep.

7656
05:42:37,320 --> 05:42:37,780
In general.

7657
05:42:39,180 --> 05:42:39,820
But yeah.

7658
05:42:39,920 --> 05:42:42,480
I highly recommend checking out the lore of everything.

7659
05:42:42,660 --> 05:42:43,620
And the adaptations.

7660
05:42:43,760 --> 05:42:44,840
And the original story.

7661
05:42:46,340 --> 05:42:46,820
And...

7662
05:42:46,820 --> 05:42:47,140
Yeah.

7663
05:42:48,060 --> 05:42:48,540
Yeah.

7664
05:42:48,580 --> 05:42:50,080
It's 2,000-ish pages.

7665
05:42:50,200 --> 05:42:50,800
By the way.

7666
05:42:50,860 --> 05:42:51,660
I read Journey...

7667
05:42:51,660 --> 05:42:53,120
I read Journey to the West.

7668
05:42:53,280 --> 05:42:54,840
And Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

7669
05:42:55,080 --> 05:42:55,720
And like...

7670
05:42:55,740 --> 05:42:58,380
Obviously, I don't remember everything.

7671
05:42:58,980 --> 05:43:00,360
In the story...

7672
05:43:00,360 --> 05:43:01,660
Guys, it was very long.

7673
05:43:01,980 --> 05:43:02,120
Like...

7674
05:43:04,320 --> 05:43:06,680
Because I read Journey to the West.

7675
05:43:06,880 --> 05:43:07,360
And...

7676
05:43:07,360 --> 05:43:08,880
I read Journey to the West.

7677
05:43:08,940 --> 05:43:10,320
And Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

7678
05:43:10,320 --> 05:43:10,960
Back to back.

7679
05:43:11,180 --> 05:43:11,900
So like...

7680
05:43:11,900 --> 05:43:13,640
Obviously, I don't remember everything.

7681
05:43:13,980 --> 05:43:14,320
Like...

7682
05:43:14,320 --> 05:43:15,800
I don't...

7683
05:43:15,800 --> 05:43:18,060
I don't remember everything in the stories.

7684
05:43:18,700 --> 05:43:20,480
But it's still really good.

7685
05:43:20,620 --> 05:43:20,820
Yeah.

7686
05:43:22,980 --> 05:43:23,520
No.

7687
05:43:23,620 --> 05:43:23,980
Okay.

7688
05:43:24,080 --> 05:43:25,320
I'll show you how long...

7689
05:43:25,320 --> 05:43:25,720
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is.

7690
05:43:28,200 --> 05:43:28,980
It's like...

7691
05:43:28,980 --> 05:43:30,880
I remember when I bought that book.

7692
05:43:31,020 --> 05:43:31,780
And I was like...

7693
05:43:31,780 --> 05:43:33,340
The thickness of that book.

7694
05:43:35,560 --> 05:43:36,040
Like...

7695
05:43:37,340 --> 05:43:37,820
Okay.

7696
05:43:37,920 --> 05:43:38,380
I'll show you.

7697
05:43:38,460 --> 05:43:38,700
Okay.

7698
05:43:38,740 --> 05:43:39,400
Here's the...

7699
05:43:39,880 --> 05:43:40,740
Oh, my God.

7700
05:43:40,780 --> 05:43:42,200
I know like which one I had.

7701
05:43:42,380 --> 05:43:42,740
But like...

7702
05:43:42,740 --> 05:43:43,940
I need to show you guys how...

7703
05:43:43,940 --> 05:43:45,960
How thick the book is.

7704
05:43:47,120 --> 05:43:49,940
And the text was so tiny, too.

7705
05:43:50,040 --> 05:43:51,580
I read it in middle school.

7706
05:43:51,980 --> 05:43:53,380
Because I just love...

7707
05:43:53,380 --> 05:43:54,560
I love like...

7708
05:43:54,560 --> 05:43:55,080
Um...

7709
05:43:55,080 --> 05:43:55,260
Like...

7710
05:43:55,260 --> 05:43:55,280
Like...

7711
05:43:55,280 --> 05:43:55,360
Like...

7712
05:43:55,360 --> 05:43:55,720
Like...

7713
05:43:55,720 --> 05:43:57,080
I just love the books.

7714
05:43:57,180 --> 05:43:57,600
Or like...

7715
05:43:57,600 --> 05:43:58,920
I love the story behind it.

7716
05:43:58,980 --> 05:43:59,460
Even though like...

7717
05:43:59,460 --> 05:44:01,160
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is technically...

7718
05:44:01,160 --> 05:44:01,980
Well, it's like...

7719
05:44:01,980 --> 05:44:03,040
Romanticized history.

7720
05:44:03,540 --> 05:44:04,300
That's why it's like...

7721
05:44:04,300 --> 05:44:05,340
Romance of the...

7722
05:44:05,340 --> 05:44:06,240
But like...

7723
05:44:06,240 --> 05:44:08,720
This is how thick Romance of the Three Kingdoms is.

7724
05:44:08,880 --> 05:44:09,240
Like...

7725
05:44:12,360 --> 05:44:13,160
It's like...

7726
05:44:16,220 --> 05:44:17,280
And I was like...

7727
05:44:17,280 --> 05:44:17,520
This was...

7728
05:44:17,520 --> 05:44:17,880
This is...

7729
05:44:17,880 --> 05:44:19,400
Book one, by the way.

7730
05:44:19,600 --> 05:44:20,240
By the way...

7731
05:44:20,240 --> 05:44:20,700
This is...

7732
05:44:20,700 --> 05:44:21,720
Book one.

7733
05:44:22,420 --> 05:44:22,820
Um...

7734
05:44:22,820 --> 05:44:23,460
This is...

7735
05:44:23,460 --> 05:44:23,960
Book...

7736
05:44:23,960 --> 05:44:25,520
Because book two is also that thick.

7737
05:44:25,580 --> 05:44:25,700
Um...

7738
05:44:25,700 --> 05:44:27,200
So, you can see the one here.

7739
05:44:27,400 --> 05:44:29,140
You can see the one.

7740
05:44:29,660 --> 05:44:30,540
Book one.

7741
05:44:33,540 --> 05:44:33,980
Yeah.

7742
05:44:39,200 --> 05:44:39,640
Um...

7743
05:44:39,640 --> 05:44:40,180
And I read...

7744
05:44:40,180 --> 05:44:41,040
I read it in middle school.

7745
05:44:42,560 --> 05:44:43,000
Um...

7746
05:44:43,000 --> 05:44:43,860
But it's very...

7747
05:44:44,440 --> 05:44:44,880
It's...

7748
05:44:44,880 --> 05:44:45,580
It's really...

7749
05:44:45,580 --> 05:44:46,480
It's a really good read.

7750
05:44:46,680 --> 05:44:47,120
Um...

7751
05:44:47,120 --> 05:44:48,680
If you really enjoyed like...

7752
05:44:48,680 --> 05:44:50,380
History and like...

7753
05:44:50,380 --> 05:44:51,160
Um...

7754
05:44:51,160 --> 05:44:51,620
Um...

7755
05:44:51,620 --> 05:44:52,340
Samgozi.

7756
05:44:52,520 --> 05:44:53,420
Or just like...

7757
05:44:53,420 --> 05:44:54,100
Just...

7758
05:44:54,100 --> 05:44:55,680
It's just a really good read.

7759
05:44:55,700 --> 05:44:56,420
That's all I can say.

7760
05:44:56,580 --> 05:44:56,860
Like...

7761
05:44:58,560 --> 05:44:59,440
And it's...

7762
05:44:59,440 --> 05:45:00,100
Um...

7763
05:45:00,100 --> 05:45:00,960
That's a break.

7764
05:45:01,100 --> 05:45:03,260
Thank you for the super chat, Giga.

7765
05:45:03,320 --> 05:45:03,700
Thank you.

7766
05:45:03,700 --> 05:45:04,320
Thank you.

7767
05:45:04,700 --> 05:45:05,140
Uh...

7768
05:45:05,140 --> 05:45:05,520
But yeah.

7769
05:45:05,720 --> 05:45:06,120
Um...

7770
05:45:06,120 --> 05:45:07,420
Highly recommend checking it out.

7771
05:45:09,340 --> 05:45:09,780
Uh...

7772
05:45:09,780 --> 05:45:10,340
Uh...

7773
05:45:10,340 --> 05:45:11,320
Anyway, guys.

7774
05:45:11,560 --> 05:45:12,000
Uh...

7775
05:45:12,000 --> 05:45:12,260
But yeah.

7776
05:45:12,300 --> 05:45:13,620
Check out Journey to the West, too.

7777
05:45:13,700 --> 05:45:15,040
It's also really good, too.

7778
05:45:15,620 --> 05:45:16,060
Um...

7779
05:45:16,060 --> 05:45:16,420
Uh...

7780
05:45:16,420 --> 05:45:16,920
Anyway, guys.

7781
05:45:17,100 --> 05:45:17,500
Uh...

7782
05:45:17,500 --> 05:45:18,300
As always, every...

7783
05:45:18,300 --> 05:45:19,080
I'm gonna call it here.

7784
05:45:19,340 --> 05:45:20,580
We have a very long week.

7785
05:45:20,660 --> 05:45:21,680
So, I wanna make sure...

7786
05:45:22,380 --> 05:45:22,820
Uh...

7787
05:45:22,820 --> 05:45:24,560
I'm gonna make sure that...

7788
05:45:24,560 --> 05:45:25,060
Like...

7789
05:45:25,060 --> 05:45:25,940
I rest my voice.

7790
05:45:26,060 --> 05:45:27,500
Because we did a lot of screaming and yelling.

7791
05:45:30,920 --> 05:45:31,960
And so...

7792
05:45:31,960 --> 05:45:32,540
Um...

7793
05:45:32,540 --> 05:45:34,460
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

7794
05:45:34,760 --> 05:45:36,660
And I'm happy to finally beat Wukong.

7795
05:45:36,780 --> 05:45:38,360
And my PC can finally rest.

7796
05:45:38,740 --> 05:45:39,260
Um...

7797
05:45:39,260 --> 05:45:41,020
Can finally rest after...

7798
05:45:41,800 --> 05:45:42,320
After...

7799
05:45:43,440 --> 05:45:44,480
Mid-dying.

7800
05:45:45,040 --> 05:45:46,820
In the middle of the play-through.

7801
05:45:47,820 --> 05:45:50,260
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

7802
05:45:50,620 --> 05:45:51,240
Posture check.

7803
05:45:51,320 --> 05:45:52,800
Get up and move around to get that blood.

7804
05:45:52,820 --> 05:45:54,640
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7805
05:45:54,720 --> 05:45:55,860
Because you deserve it.

7806
05:45:55,920 --> 05:45:57,540
I'll read, like, two more Super Chats, by the way.

7807
05:45:58,000 --> 05:45:58,100
Uh...

7808
05:45:58,100 --> 05:45:59,160
Medi, thank you for the Super Chat.

7809
05:45:59,240 --> 05:45:59,520
Thank you.

7810
05:45:59,520 --> 05:46:00,060
Thank you.

7811
05:46:00,160 --> 05:46:01,620
I bought the Three Kingdoms book.

7812
05:46:01,740 --> 05:46:02,740
Three volumes because of you.

7813
05:46:02,780 --> 05:46:04,060
And I'll do the same with Journey to the West.

7814
05:46:04,100 --> 05:46:04,920
You won't regret it.

7815
05:46:04,980 --> 05:46:06,060
It's a very interesting...

7816
05:46:06,060 --> 05:46:07,520
It's a very interesting read.

7817
05:46:07,700 --> 05:46:08,580
And, um...

7818
05:46:08,580 --> 05:46:11,580
If you like the story from the game, you'll enjoy the story from the book.

7819
05:46:11,720 --> 05:46:12,300
And I highly...

7820
05:46:12,300 --> 05:46:15,780
Like I said, I highly recommend checking the TV show and the movie adaptations, too.

7821
05:46:16,140 --> 05:46:16,460
Um...

7822
05:46:16,460 --> 05:46:17,380
The movies are really...

7823
05:46:17,380 --> 05:46:19,920
If you watch the Steven Chao movies, they're really funny.

7824
05:46:20,120 --> 05:46:22,800
And you'll understand, like, the lore behind it, too.

7825
05:46:22,800 --> 05:46:26,280
If you understand the background behind Wukong, like, you'll really...

7826
05:46:26,280 --> 05:46:27,160
You'll enjoy it a lot more.

7827
05:46:28,080 --> 05:46:28,520
Um...

7828
05:46:28,520 --> 05:46:28,820
Um...

7829
05:46:28,820 --> 05:46:29,160
But, yeah.

7830
05:46:29,400 --> 05:46:29,800
Uh...

7831
05:46:29,800 --> 05:46:30,440
Thank you for the Super Chat.

7832
05:46:30,520 --> 05:46:30,780
Thank you.

7833
05:46:30,820 --> 05:46:31,360
Thank you.

7834
05:46:32,500 --> 05:46:32,940
Um...

7835
05:46:32,940 --> 05:46:34,180
Joah, thank you for the Super Chat.

7836
05:46:34,240 --> 05:46:34,560
Thank you.

7837
05:46:34,580 --> 05:46:35,220
Thank you.

7838
05:46:36,000 --> 05:46:36,440
Uh...

7839
05:46:36,440 --> 05:46:37,080
Uh...

7840
05:46:37,080 --> 05:46:39,300
Is that 2,000 page even longer in English?

7841
05:46:39,380 --> 05:46:39,640
Is...

7842
05:46:39,640 --> 05:46:40,200
Uh...

7843
05:46:40,200 --> 05:46:41,460
Well, that's...

7844
05:46:41,460 --> 05:46:42,380
I believe...

7845
05:46:42,380 --> 05:46:42,680
I...

7846
05:46:42,680 --> 05:46:43,960
Isn't that the...

7847
05:46:43,960 --> 05:46:45,620
I don't remember how long, actually.

7848
05:46:45,940 --> 05:46:47,300
Journey to the West.

7849
05:46:47,660 --> 05:46:49,900
How many pages in English?

7850
05:46:50,040 --> 05:46:51,520
It depends on the publisher.

7851
05:46:51,840 --> 05:46:52,780
It is...

7852
05:46:52,800 --> 05:46:53,520
Ooh.

7853
05:46:53,740 --> 05:46:54,160
Wow.

7854
05:46:55,520 --> 05:46:57,320
It depends on the book, honestly.

7855
05:46:57,480 --> 05:46:58,760
Just buy the book and see how...

7856
05:46:59,280 --> 05:47:02,680
It depends on, like, the publisher and how tiny the text is.

7857
05:47:03,140 --> 05:47:03,340
Um...

7858
05:47:03,340 --> 05:47:04,040
I read it in English.

7859
05:47:04,100 --> 05:47:05,020
I can't read Chinese.

7860
05:47:06,060 --> 05:47:07,440
I can't read Chinese.

7861
05:47:07,480 --> 05:47:08,220
I read it in English.

7862
05:47:08,460 --> 05:47:09,600
Anyway, thank you for the Super Chat.

7863
05:47:09,680 --> 05:47:10,020
Thank you.

7864
05:47:10,060 --> 05:47:10,660
Thank you.

7865
05:47:10,860 --> 05:47:13,040
So, it depends on how tiny the texts are.

7866
05:47:13,220 --> 05:47:14,200
And, like...

7867
05:47:14,200 --> 05:47:14,600
Um...

7868
05:47:14,600 --> 05:47:15,340
How big...

7869
05:47:15,340 --> 05:47:15,700
How...

7870
05:47:15,700 --> 05:47:16,060
How...

7871
05:47:16,060 --> 05:47:17,100
Who the publishers are.

7872
05:47:17,600 --> 05:47:18,040
Uh...

7873
05:47:18,040 --> 05:47:18,900
Our last...

7874
05:47:18,900 --> 05:47:20,080
Last Super Chat for today.

7875
05:47:20,700 --> 05:47:21,100
Uh...

7876
05:47:21,560 --> 05:47:21,960
Noriko.

7877
05:47:22,320 --> 05:47:22,720
Noriko.

7878
05:47:22,900 --> 05:47:23,800
Thank you for the Super Chat.

7879
05:47:23,880 --> 05:47:24,160
Thank you.

7880
05:47:24,180 --> 05:47:24,680
Thank you.

7881
05:47:25,040 --> 05:47:25,440
Uh...

7882
05:47:25,440 --> 05:47:25,940
Toki.

7883
05:47:27,240 --> 05:47:27,640
Uh...

7884
05:47:27,640 --> 05:47:28,080
Oh, wait.

7885
05:47:28,200 --> 05:47:28,680
Oh, wait.

7886
05:47:28,700 --> 05:47:29,000
So, sorry.

7887
05:47:29,080 --> 05:47:29,260
Sorry.

7888
05:47:29,280 --> 05:47:30,620
That is from, uh...

7889
05:47:31,420 --> 05:47:31,820
Maoyoko.

7890
05:47:32,200 --> 05:47:33,440
But I meant...

7891
05:47:33,440 --> 05:47:35,700
Who needs revenue when you have Super Chats?

7892
05:47:35,760 --> 05:47:35,960
Yes.

7893
05:47:36,000 --> 05:47:36,620
Five dollars.

7894
05:47:36,760 --> 05:47:37,980
Thank you for the Super Chat.

7895
05:47:38,060 --> 05:47:38,400
Thank you.

7896
05:47:38,440 --> 05:47:39,020
Thank you.

7897
05:47:39,100 --> 05:47:41,420
I really appreciate it.

7898
05:47:42,140 --> 05:47:42,540
Yeah.

7899
05:47:42,740 --> 05:47:44,420
We don't need our revenue, guys.

7900
05:47:44,540 --> 05:47:45,040
We have...

7901
05:47:45,040 --> 05:47:46,280
We have Super Chats.

7902
05:47:49,660 --> 05:47:51,620
But I do appreciate it, guys.

7903
05:47:51,720 --> 05:47:52,240
I really do.

7904
05:47:52,840 --> 05:47:53,240
Um...

7905
05:47:54,020 --> 05:47:54,420
Um...

7906
05:47:54,420 --> 05:47:54,800
But, yeah.

7907
05:47:54,820 --> 05:47:55,320
It was great.

7908
05:47:55,500 --> 05:47:56,300
It was great, everybody.

7909
05:47:56,680 --> 05:47:57,080
Uh...

7910
05:47:57,080 --> 05:47:58,340
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

7911
05:47:58,760 --> 05:47:59,500
Bye, guys.

7912
05:48:00,560 --> 05:48:00,960
Bye.

7913
05:48:01,840 --> 05:48:03,740
Thank you all for the Super Chats, everybody.

7914
05:48:03,920 --> 05:48:05,260
I really appreciate it.

7915
05:48:05,540 --> 05:48:06,240
Bye-bye.

7916
05:48:06,820 --> 05:48:07,220
Bye.

7917
05:48:07,220 --> 05:48:07,420
Bye.

7918
05:48:07,820 --> 05:48:08,220
Bye.

7919
05:48:08,220 --> 05:48:08,360
Bye.
